<h2><a name="ch1"></a>CHAPTER ONE</h2>

<p class="first">THE rector got up from his writing table and
laying his pipe down, stood a moment as though collecting his
thoughts. A distinguished-looking man of around forty was John
Avery, with his tall spare figure, his clever, scholarly face. He
was frowning as he absent-mindedly straightened a yellow china
jar on the corner of the mantelshelf. Then he returned to his
knee-hole table, and, taking an apple from a plate which always
stood on the corner, began slowly to eat it, still with a look of
abstraction on his face, still with some inner discomfort marking
a frown on his fine forehead.

<p>The apple automatically disposed of, he drew out his watch and
looked at it. Four o'clock. His sister-in-law would probably be
in her own sitting-room.</p>

<p>Stepping out into the rectory's big hall-lounge, he went up
the stairs, broad and curving, and with a gentle preliminary
knock opened a door giving on a room of blue and white harmonies.
The rector's sister-in-law&mdash;Doris Avery, whom most of her
circle, including the rector, voted a very beautiful
woman&mdash;sat writing at one of the windows the strong light
struck flaming gleams from the burnished hair that grew in a
lovely crescent around her smooth white forehead. Otherwise,
however, her features were just averagely good; the hazel eyes of
no particular size or shape, their shade dependent, like most
eyes of that colour, on the mood of the moment, and the mouth
similarly neutral in its general placidity, though the mobile
lips looked ready to smile on the least occasion. Her seated
figure, too, revealed a length of slender limbs that bespoke her
tallness and fine proportions when up on her smartly-shod
feet.</p>

<p>As she caught sight of him, she gave an exclamation of pleased
surprise. "Why, John! I thought of you as still a captive in
Damascus&mdash;or was it Ephesus? But since you're free&mdash;try
this chair."</p>

<p>The cheery invitation, although he seated himself in
accordance with it, failed to dissipate the troubled expression
on John Avery's face as he said with evident reluctance: "My dear
Doris, I'm afraid you'll think me unpardonably impertinent for
what I've come up to say to you. But I feel it a friendly no less
than a conscientious duty."</p>

<p>At her glance of inquiry he said in a low but firm voice:
"It's about Anthony. Revell." Adding gravely, as her raised
eyebrows and puzzled expression continued to silently question
his meaning, "Are you being quite fair to him, Doris? I know your
devotion to Dick, of course. But Revell may not realise it so
fully. It's not the first time that something in his voice and
look, when talking with you, has given me the same anxious fear
that he may possibly misunderstand your quick sympathies. But it
has nerved me to say frankly that I think it would be well for
him to see less of you, my dear."</p>

<p>Doris Avery had a very charming laugh. It rang out now. Then
she stifled it to exclaim: "My dear John! How deliciously
flattering! But you should say it to Olive Hill. Not to me."</p>

<p>"Olive Hill?" he repeated blankly.</p>

<p>"She <i>would</i> be pleased at your tone!" Doris spoke with a
spice of malice in her own. "Yes, Olive Hill. But don't say a
word yet, or you'll choke him off. He has intervals of qualms.
Olive may yet be sacrificed&mdash;but he is tempted."</p>

<p>The rector got up. His handsome face was all alight now. Gone
was the touch of austerity which showed when he was grave.</p>

<p>"I confess I never thought of that simple explanation." He did
not add that it had never occurred to him that any man would fall
in love with Olive Hill when Doris Avery was before his eyes.
Though Olive had an interesting face and really fine eyes. Olive
was his sister Grace's companion. A slender brown-haired girl
whose quietness had won her the nickname of "Mousie" as a child.
She was an orphan. Her father had been a colonel in an Indian
cavalry regiment and her mother a friend of Grace Avery's mother.
Except for certain set duties, Olive was treated at the rectory
exactly as a member of the family.</p>

<p>Grace came in now and sank into a chair with some compliment
to Doris on how charming her room always looked.</p>

<p>"Wait till it gets its new covers," Doris said to that.
"Olive's engineering them. Blue taffetas with black and white
embroideries here and there. Awfully smart. By the way, Grace,
I've just been confiding to John's well-known discretion&mdash;as
now to your own&mdash;that Olive's the magnet responsible for
Anthony Revell's increasingly frequent calls."</p>

<p>Grace looked perturbed. The news seemed unwelcome. "Surely
you're mistaken, Doris," she said slowly, but was silenced by the
smiling assurance: "I have it from Anthony himself, my dear. Only
just now he was asking me whether I thought he had a chance with
her. But this is in absolute confidence, remember, please. The
secret's between us three until he musters up the courage to
declare himself openly. But tell me how you like my new covers,
John?"</p>

<p>The rector was, however, thinking only of Anthony Revell.
Smart, well-groomed Anthony Revell, with a very large fortune and
a beautiful old house.</p>

<p>"You really think he's in earnest," he queried doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Olive <i>would</i> be pleased to hear you," Doris answered
dryly. "Oh, yes; he's very much in earnest, though I don't say
I'm for nothing in the affair. He's a shocking flirt, of course.
We all of us know his deserved reputation in that respect. But
I've made it plain to him that he's gone too far, now, for
further&mdash;"</p>

<p>The rector's attention was suddenly caught by a door slightly
ajar. It led into a sort of nondescript room which used to be one
of the schoolrooms. Avery clearly remembered that this door had
been quite shut when he began speaking to Doris just now. He was
a man of shrewd perceptions and the wind was blowing from the
other side of the house. As the door had opened, therefore, it
had been opened by a human hand. Stepping to it, he flung it
suddenly wide.</p>

<p>At the other side of the farther room stood a young woman
doing something to a jar of flowers. But the tassel ends of a
cushion between her and the door were still swinging. Evidently
set in motion by her swift movement backwards.</p>

<p>Olive Hill&mdash;for it was she, looked round in
well-simulated surprise.</p>

<p>"Do you want me?" she asked with her faint surface smile, her
eyes glittering as she turned them on the rector.</p>

<p>"There's a book on the hall table that's just come for you,"
he answered gravely.</p>

<p>"Really? Oh, thanks, I'll run down and get it." And with
another artificial smile she left the room by its opposite door.
On which the rector turned back to Doris, shutting its nearer
door firmly behind him.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid Miss Hill overheard us," he warned her as he did
so. But Doris only laughed carelessly. There was a hard streak in
her, as the rector knew. It was a pity. But, in his eyes, her
devotion to his brother Richard outweighed it.</p>

<p>"She ought to feel flattered to learn that I'm trying to nerve
a wavering lover." Mrs. Richard Avery lit a fresh cigarette. "For
it will be my good deed when it comes off. I love
matchmaking!"</p>

<p>"Then why not make one between him and Mrs. Green?" Grace
asked, with a world of meaning in her tones.</p>

<p>The rector's face stiffened. He detested scandal, and there
was a lot of talk about Anthony Revell and the woman artist
staying at The Causeway who was painting his portrait and
decorating his study for him.</p>

<p>Doris laughed.</p>

<p>"If you heard Anthony talk about her, Grace, you would realise
that he looks on her as a sister."</p>

<p>"If you want to engineer a husband for Mousie," Grace went on
obstinately, "though I think she is far better off as she is,
then why not Mr. Byrd? He and she are mutually attracted and
would make an eminently suitable match. While Anthony With his
grandfather's fortune now in his hands there isn't a family into
whom he might not marry! You let Mousie and Mr. Byrd manage their
own love affairs."</p>

<p>"Mr. Byrd doesn't approve of marriage," Doris said coldly. "He
goes about saying so. And I don't think that he's the least bit
really in love with Olive. But surely that's enough discussion of
her matrimonial possibilities," she finished with a rueful
laugh.</p>

<p>Grace gave a nod that signified her complete agreement on that
point as she rose and left her brother and sister-in-law to their
own conclusions.</p>

<p>Doris's glance went to the table in front of her. "I'm just
writing to Dick," she said, tapping the paper softly as though
the messages it carried made it precious. "I wish he weren't so
mysterious about when he's coming home. It makes me dreadfully
afraid that he's once more going to spend his leave out there.
The Gold Coast isn't the health resort he tries to make me
believe it. And oh! I do miss him so frightfully!"</p>

<p>Mr. Avery laid a sympathising hand on her shoulder. He was
very fond of his sister-in-law who had kept house for him now for
nearly two years. He hoped that Richard really was making his
fortune, as he had hinted that he was doing in a letter to
himself nearly a month ago. Richard was a clever chap with many
irons in West African fires. He had written in the highest
spirits of one of his investments. A banana-grove that he had
bought from a tired owner, and still more, some ore samples
uncovered when a torrential rain had washed away a whole
hillside, promised a bonanza. But, he added, it was too soon to
write with assurance. Which was why he was not letting Doris in
for a disappointment. But if his hopes were realised, that month-old
letter had said that Richard would be back with Doris very
shortly. And with money enough to stay in England and comfort for
the rest of his life.</p>

<p>"Patience!" the rector encouraged her, therefore, before
saying that he must get back to Ephesus.</p>

<p>"To 'the Street called Straight?'" she asked. "The street
where you certainly belong, Jack," Doris said gratefully as she
turned to resume her letter-writing.</p>

<p>Descending the stairs thoughtfully, the rector caught sight of
Olive below. She was standing by the table on which lay the book
that he had mentioned to her, and he looked at her with new eyes.
If she married Anthony Revell she would become a prominent member
of his parish. The Causeway, Revell's house, lay quite close; and
his father, the Admiral, had been a friend of the Averys for
years before he died. Anthony had a privileged place in the
community.</p>

<p>Studying his sister's companion with these considerations as
he came down, Avery was struck by the intensity of the still
figure. Will-power, concentration, leashed-in energy, all were
expressed by it. She suggested a tautly-drawn bow, as she stood
arched slightly forward over her hands, spread out across the
book. A drawn bow? Or? Well, with a humorous twist of his lips
the rector privately thought that at this moment Miss Hill was
much more like a "Pussy" than a "Mousie." Her eyes were staring
straight ahead of her with a very curious light in their depths.
A light which the rector did not think had anything to do with
the beauty of the bed of Anchusas and Sidalceas lying directly in
their line of vision.</p>

<p>Without speaking he went on into his study, and back to his
beloved books, with a feeling that whether it was pussy or mousie
just outside the study door, the lines had indeed fallen in
pleasant places for all within the rectory; until he remembered
Grace's suggestion that Olive was in love with Byrd. A most
disquieting suggestion.</p>

<p>For Byrd represented to the rector the very spirit of evil in
his parish. Byrd&mdash;Captain Byrd, to give him the rank which
was his when he had retired on a full disability pension of
thirty shillings a week&mdash;was a "Red" of the most vivid
shade. He was not merely an atheist. Avery could have forgiven
that. He was an "anti-God;" zealously and potently stable and
quick-witted in debate, he was an ever-present thorn in the side
of the Churchman. And the idea that, even though only through his
sister's companion, his rectory could be linked to that man was
intolerable.</p>

<p>Then he reflected that Grace might have no foundation for
Olive's supposed sentiments. Doris did not take the assertion
seriously, he had seen. Also&mdash;(and here the rector reached
for his fountain-pen) also, Doris, it appeared, had set her heart
on strengthening Anthony's errant fancy for Miss Hill into an
actual engagement. And what Doris set her heart on, she usually
obtained. So that Olive's own happiness might be confidently
hoped for, to the rector's relief on all scores.</p>

<p>Four days later a telegram came for Doris from her sister.
Their mother, who lived with this married sister, was seriously
ill. So ill that her life was in danger. Doris was off within the
hour, leaving very careful instructions with Olive as to the
running of the house. Such detailed instructions that she had
rather the air of the Matron of a Home for the Feeble-Minded,
when leaving one of her charges perforce in command. Mousie,
however, listened with her usual air of careful silent attention.
Her post as "companion" was now tacitly exchanged for that of
housekeeper, with special regard for the order to take Mike,
Doris's Irish terrier, for daily walks; though "jumps" would have
more accurately described his favourite exercise.</p>

<p>The walks seemed invariably to end up by Mike's joyous
incursion into the gardens of The Causeway. And as this
necessitated catching him and leading him out on the detested
leash, the chase was apt to finish by his dash into the house by
any open door or french window.</p>

<p>All of which, of course, compelled Miss Hill to follow
apologetically for the truant's capture. This once entailed
explaining things to Mrs. Green on one of these precipitate
irruptions into a room where the artist stood palette in hand,
talking to her literally "model" host, young Anthony Revell. An
arrestingly handsome man, with dark well-cut features, brilliant
eyes and a merry smile.</p>

<p>Anthony gave the intruder a laughing welcome. But not so the
annoyed artist, for Mrs. Green sharply shook her brushes at him.
The dog's sensitive nose received some of the biting turpentine
drops. Such an agonised howl followed that Olive's apologies were
cut short by her cry of sympathy. While the victim's yelping dad'
into the open, whence he streaked for home, was instantaneously
followed by Anthony's rush after the dog in a vain impulse to
apply some comforting first aid.</p>

<p>As the two women were thus left momentarily alone, Mrs. Green
said tartly: "Serve him right! That will teach him not to come
barging in here again in a hurry!"</p>

<p>"But the dog didn't harm anything!" Olive protested. "And he
does so love coming here!" To which the answer was a sardonically
significant:</p>

<p>"<i>He</i> loves to come?" With an insolent stress on the
pronoun that emphasised the personal implication.</p>

<p>Mrs. Green looked about thirty-five years old. Dark, too, like
Anthony, but with a vividly feminine face, capable of exerting
profound attraction. Perfectly dressed, clever, amusing if not
actually witty, Mrs. Green was considered to be a social
acquisition to the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>She had appeared in the district about four months ago,
sending in her card to Lady Revell at The Flagstaff, and asking
whether she might be allowed to copy the "Revell Morley." Lady
Revell had given permission at once, had met her later at her
work, and been struck by it and by her. A commission followed to
paint a ceiling for the Chinese room, Lady Revell's pride. Mrs.
Green's terms were ridiculously low, but she had explained, with
seeming frankness, that she had been ordered by her doctor away
from the North of Ireland where she lived, to the milder climate
of England, and that the idea of idle hours filled her with
horror. The two women had become very friendly. Lady Revell had
insisted on her putting up at The Flagstaff, and there Mrs. Green
had met Anthony on one of his infrequent calls on his mother.
Anthony, twelve years older than Gilbert Revell who was his
mother's idol, had been left a very large fortune when a boy of
ten by his grandfather, between whom and himself there had been
one of those warm affections that sometimes run between children
and old people. Along with the fortune had gone The Causeway, a
large house where Anthony had lived since coming down from
Oxford. Mrs. Green, the well-read, the widely travelled, the
splendid artist, had at once offered to paint some panels in his
study for him. In other words, she had fallen head over heels in
love with him, said local gossip, adding that she would not have
been the first woman to find his very unusually good looks
irresistible. Anthony flattered, and very much attracted, had at
once closed with the offer. Mrs. Green had installed herself at
The Causeway. Lady Revell had made no comment, though she had
lent Mrs. Green her own maid to stay with her there. Anthony must
marry some day, the wonder was that he had not done so before.
Mrs. Green was a widow, evidently of independent means, and might
carry it off, though Lady Revell thought her foolish to risk a
slip, for she did not think Anthony was at all in love with the
artist; but that, Lady Revell decided, was the woman's own
look-out, and certainly Mrs. Green was both keen-eyed and clever,
though a good deal older than Anthony.</p>

<p>This was the woman then who now faced Olive with an appraising
glance which was faintly ironic.</p>

<p>Olive said nothing, only looked at the little picture nearest
her. Even she recognised the quality of the work being done.</p>

<p>"You're painting the steeple tile by tile," was her only
comment. "It'll take a very long time at that rate, won't it,"
she added sweetly, "but I suppose you won't mind that."</p>

<p>This was the third time that the two had met. The other times
Mrs. Green had shown an apparent friendliness, which Olive felt
was but skin deep&mdash;if that.</p>

<p>Anthony came back now. He looked a mere lad, tall and rangy,
though handsome as few lads are, as he jumped through the window
on to the rug by Olive.</p>

<p>"Mike refuses to hear my explanations," he said, "you've
wounded his feelings deeply, Mrs. Green. Outraged all his notions
of hospitality. His last word was that he wouldn't come here
again! Ever!"</p>

<p>"But that's the idea," Olive said brightly, "Mrs. Green
doesn't like his coming. But, Mr. Revell, will you look out for
me a good book on Euripides. You spoke of a Life of
his&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope not," came from Anthony in mock horror. He had
taken a First in Classics. "When? Where?"</p>

<p>Olive only laughed, and had him take her to the big library.
There she started him on his favourite Greek authors, and from
them to philosophies of life in general. She talked amazingly
well, he thought, rather revolutionary ideas&mdash;unexpectedly
so&mdash;but very charming, and how charming too she looked. How
her large eyes shone...She was so keen on hearing what he had to
say&mdash;what he thought&mdash;especially about modern
problems&mdash;</p>

<p>The time flew&mdash;as it had flown before when talking with
her, Anthony recollected. He said as much when begging her to use
the library. She had just explained that she could not go to the
rector's fine collection of books, as he so often needed to
consult them himself. It was in the middle of his ideas on how to
help unemployment, ideas which were like and yet interestingly
different to those held, or at least talked of, by her, that she
said she must be back in the rectory. They walked home there
together. Anthony struck anew by some of the things that she
said; things, had he but known it, that Mr. Byrd proclaimed at
his weekly talks to any who liked to drop in at his little
cottage which he had named, with his characteristic
bluntness&mdash;The Hut. It too was not far from The Causeway,
but on the other side from The Flagstaff.

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER TWO</h2>

<p class="first">THREE weeks passed, and still Doris was not able
to leave her mother, but Olive managed her affairs quite nicely
without her aid, so nicely that one afternoon Anthony hurried
after her as she was leaving The Causeway. He had been out when
she had arrived "to return a book."</p>

<p>"I hope Mrs. Green didn't really annoy you," he said
earnestly.</p>

<p>Anthony had not heard what the trouble had really been, he had
only come on Mrs. Green looking quite flushed, and on Olive
facing her with a look as though she were a little girl being
scolded by her governess.</p>

<p>"She hates me," Olive now said. "She adores you," she
added.</p>

<p>"Not adores," he said uncomfortably. "She's a very
warm-hearted woman, and, well&mdash;very great friends at first
sight&mdash;almost&mdash;" He plodded on, but Olive was not
listening&mdash;apparently. Her face upturned to the trees, she
was content to be now in the sunshine, now in the
shade&mdash;apparently.</p>

<p>And then Anthony told her how he loved her, how he had fallen
in love with her when he had seen her in Mrs. Richard Avery's
sitting-room at the rectory only three weeks ago, and how he
would never love any one else all his life.</p>

<p>"I wish I could say that I never had loved any one before,"
Anthony went on, "though in a way I can. That's the worst of not
falling in love&mdash;true love&mdash;early. Had I met you
before&mdash;other things wouldn't have happened. Couldn't have
happened. But I can swear that from now on you'll be the only
woman in my life. Had I known what love is, I wouldn't have been
deceived by its counterfeit. Not I. But now"&mdash;and Anthony's
arms went round her&mdash;"I love you, and you only, and do you
love me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she murmured, letting him kiss her. Suddenly she drew
away. "There's some one over there. I saw a shadow slip behind
those bushes. They must have been behind this tree and heard
every word we've been saying!"</p>

<p>"Who cares," he replied; and again forgot the world and other
people.</p>

<p>Quite half an hour later, Anthony overtook Mr. Avery as he was
walking home.</p>

<p>"I want you to be the first to know," Anthony began, and with
that he went on to tell him of his engagement that afternoon to
Olive. ". We're keeping it to ourselves until I come back from my
annual fortnight's rock climbing," he wound up.</p>

<p>Was the delay in order to get Mrs. Green to leave The
Causeway, the rector wondered.</p>

<p>"And what about Mrs. Green?" he now asked gravely.</p>

<p>Anthony turned and faced him. "I told you before, Padre, that
there was nothing between us&mdash;except friendship. I can
repeat that. Honestly. She's a lonely woman," Revell went on, "a
most charming friend. Very affectionate. But she might be a
hundred, for all the love-making there's ever been between us.
And on her side as well as mine," he added earnestly. "I know
what people are saying, and she can be frightfully tiresome with
her airs of&mdash;well&mdash;proprietorship," he flushed, "but
it's only friendship, Padre. Only."</p>

<p>"Will the friendship extend to Olive?" Avery asked quietly. He
was a man of few words, but he could cut in with the one question
that went to the root of the matter under discussion.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not," Revell said, "no, I'm afraid not. It's
comical, but she doesn't think Olive good enough for me. Olive
<i>Mel</i> Me, why, I'm not worthy to breathe the same air with
Olive!"</p>

<p>The rector liked the lover's hyperbole. He had had a romance
of his own once.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Green's leaving The Causeway in any case," Anthony went
on. "The paintings are finished, and jolly fine little things
they are."</p>

<p>"So I'm told. Fairy tales from Grimm, I understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes. They're painted so as to seem just emerging from
dreamland. Little house where the Seven Bears lived. Church, to
which the hero rides for his marriage to the princess. Mountain
peaks and bits of a blue lake far below, as seen from the window
of the Sleeping Beauty. Landscape, such as Red Riding Hood ran
through&mdash;all that sort of thing, but they're not nursery
stuff. They're rather wonderful. Olive agrees about that."</p>

<p>"And your own portrait?" Avery had heard that Mrs. Green was
painting one.</p>

<p>Anthony laughed. The rector liked his laugh. It was still
boyish and unspoiled.</p>

<p>"That's too awful for words. Only equalled by the awfulness of
the lines of the dinner-jacket in it. I've come out as a cross
between Shelley. Byron, and the picture of Bubbles that hung in
Gilbert's nursery."</p>

<p>"Olive seen it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She thinks it stands for Mrs. Green's dream of what I
ought to look like." And both men laughed.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Green's moving to my mother's. You know&mdash;apart from
to-day, there was a horrid row yesterday," and suddenly he burst
out. Mr. Avery had always been a sort of father confessor to
Anthony. The two liked each other sincerely.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Green was infernally rude to Olive. She has been near
enough to the line before, but she stepped over it
yesterday&mdash;with both feet. Olive had dropped in to borrow
books from my library. She's keen on books. Uncommonly well read,
as I don't doubt you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>The rector did not know.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Green seems to have taken a dislike to her&mdash;a quite
ridiculous dislike "&mdash;Anthony looked furious&mdash;but also
sheepish. "Every time Olive has come in about books, Mrs. Green
made herself a fearful nuisance, and yesterday, as I say, we had
it out. I told her she would have to apologise to Olive.
She&mdash;she&mdash;oh, she was insufferable. Burst into tears
and flung her arms around my neck&mdash;" Poor Anthony looked so
miserable that the rector stifled a smile with difficulty.</p>

<p>"One of the penalties of youth," he could not resist saying.
"When you're my age, no one wants to throw her arms around your
neck."</p>

<p>But Anthony was not listening.</p>

<p>"She's gone back to my mother's to finish a ceiling she's
painting in the Chinese room there. And The Causeway will be shut
up till I get back." There fell another silence. "Though, mind
you, till this happened, Mrs. Green has been the most delightful
friend a man could find She told me in the beginning that I
reminded her of a son she had, who died years ago."</p>

<p>The rector made no comment. The Mrs. Green whom he had met did
not look in the least motherly. Exquisitely dressed, charmingly
pretty, with her air of ease and poise, she was the kind of woman
who, the rector thought, played the part of friend to a handsome
young man like Anthony at her own risk.</p>

<p>He asked Anthony to dinner, and the latter accepted with
pleasure. Though he would have to leave rather early afterwards
as he had a long-standing engagement in town which he could not
break. He would be off next morning, in any case, for his
fortnight's holiday in Derbyshire.</p>

<p>Olive showed a charming side of her at dinner that night. The
rector had no idea there was so much hidden in Mousie. It was as
well she filled the canvas, he thought, for Grace was no use at
all. She kept glancing from one to the other of the young couple,
but she talked very little.</p>

<p>When dinner was over and Anthony had had very reluctantly to
tear himself away, she stepped into the rector's study, and stood
a moment watching him fill his pipe.</p>

<p>"I haven't told you!" he said with a cheerful grin. "I haven't
said a word!"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's plain enough. And yet, but for Doris's meddling,
Olive would have married that horrid Byrd man, and I needn't have
had this talk with you. Olive mustn't marry Anthony, Jack." Grace
spoke with vigour&mdash;and anger.</p>

<p>The rector waited in surprise. He had to wait some time.</p>

<p>"That must be stopped," she said at last in a low voice, "for
I've a dreadful thing to tell you. I suspect now that Olive had
been pilfering from my things ever since she came," were her next
and most unexpected words. "I can't otherwise
understand&mdash;there's no other way of explaining&mdash;what
has become of things that seem to vanish. Real lace&mdash;I had
yards of it that I never wore&mdash;trinkets that I don't
use&mdash;that gold-fitted dressing-case that you gave me. It was
a frightfully handsome affair, but heavy as sin. They have all
gone. I never thought of its being Olive till yesterday, when two
one-pound notes were taken out of my purse&mdash;and could only
have been taken by Olive. The purse was lying on a table in my
sitting-room where I sat reading. She was in and out several
times, and as it happened I counted the notes over when I picked
up the purse, just as, by chance, I had when I laid it on the
table, for I was half minded to ask you to give me a couple of
five-pound notes for the lot. When I counted them the second
time, I was two pounds short."</p>

<p>"You are absolutely certain it couldn't have been any one
else. Or that you didn't make a mistake?" he asked very
gravely.</p>

<p>"Absolutely." Grace's tone was very distressed. "I haven't
spoken to her, for I don't know what to do about it." She looked
as though she did not. "It's a dreadful position. I loved her
mother. I owe her a tremendous debt for her help when my mother
died. And besides being Gertie's child, Olive is so quiet in all
her ways, so amusing&mdash;always contented&mdash;marvellous
memory&mdash;as a companion she's irreplaceable. But she mustn't
marry Anthony. You see how impossible that has become!"</p>

<p>The rector said nothing for a full minute.</p>

<p>Grace was his half-sister really. Born when he had been at
Winchester, they had grown up with the unbridgeable distance of
years between them. She had married the year that he returned to
his father's rectory as a curate. It was only on her husband's
death a couple of years ago that she had made the rectory her
home&mdash;at least for the summer. She always spent her winters
out of England. He did not really know her much better than he
knew Olive, he was reflecting uncomfortably. Was this that she
had just told him to be taken literally, or was it exaggerated?
Was she so vexed at losing a companion that she had&mdash;the
rector hesitated over the right word. He was aghast at what she
had told him. Much too much so to talk the matter over at the
moment. It would require the most careful thought...a sudden
remembrance of some incident in her childhood came back to him. A
nurse had maintained then that little Gracie had deliberately
lied in order to get a governess whom she disliked out of the
rectory. This extraordinary accusation, or series of
accusations&mdash;made just now&mdash;the rector felt the ground
underfoot to be very yielding.</p>

<p>"You must prevent the marriage," she said again. "It's
absolutely impossible. Mr. Byrd&mdash;yes. He's always talking
about people having no right to money and things they don't need,
but not young Revell. The old Admiral would turn in his grave at
such a daughter-in-law at The Causeway."</p>

<p>"But why have you left it so late to bring the accusation?"
Avery asked, his face very grave.</p>

<p>"I hadn't an idea that Olive could get him," Grace said.
"She's in love with Mr. Byrd really. I thought it was just some
notion of Doris's."</p>

<p>"Doris's notions generally have something solid behind them,"
the rector spoke to gain time. "As for what you tell me about
Olive&mdash;we must think out the best thing to do. The best
thing for Olive as well as for Anthony. And meanwhile, not a word
to any one else, Grace!"</p>

<p>"No one else, of course," she agreed, "though Lucy-May Witson
or Mrs. Green would rejoice to know about it. Fortunately Anthony
is going away for a fortnight. What <i>is</i> to be done?"</p>

<p>"No one must be told one word of it," the rector said sternly.
"No one!"</p>

<p>Avery spoke with a sternness he rarely showed. He had great
personality under all his sweetness. Where he thought the
question one of right or wrong, he could crack the whip, and if
need be use it.</p>

<p>Grace promised to say nothing to any one until they should
talk the matter over&mdash;before Anthony's return from his
holiday.</p>

<p>"And meanwhile keep your things under lock and key," he said.
"Do not be the one 'by whom offence cometh.'"</p>

<p>She looked shocked.</p>

<p>"If only she can be cured. It must be kleptomania! I'm really
deeply attached to her, but&mdash;However, I shall say nothing to
her or to any one for the present."</p>

<p>She left him, and the rector smoked his pipe and tried to see
how to combine justice and mercy&mdash;that as yet unsolved
problem. He had not solved it when next day Doris arrived back at
the rectory. She was looking very fagged, and told him that
though there was no immediate danger she might be summoned again
to her mother's bedside at any time. There could be no question
of any permanent improvement.</p>

<p>"But to talk of something happier," she went on. "I hear that
Anthony and Olive have come to an understanding."</p>

<p>"Who has been indiscreet?" he questioned in his turn.</p>

<p>"I think it was Miss Jones when I stopped at the post office
for some stamps. Or no. I believe it was Harmsworth the
tobacconist&mdash;I was out of cigarettes."</p>

<p>The rector laughed at the idea of keeping anything from his
villagers.</p>

<p>"I'm going up to have a word with Olive," Doris went on. "I do
hope you will let the marriage take place from here, Jack?"</p>

<p>He made some non-committal reply at which she opened her eyes
a little. Then she was gone and the rector heard her merry laugh
overhead, and Olive's rather throaty voice replying.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon he had to go some distance to see a sick
parishioner.</p>

<p>He walked back by the oak wood whose last outcrop ran from The
Flagstaff past The Causeway. There was there a glade that was
none too easy to find, in which he loved to linger when he had
the time to spare. Strolling through it he pondered on what could
be done about Olive Hill. Her face rose before his mind. Rather
pale, heart-shaped, with big black eyes that could look like
pieces of jet, or like rounds of velvet. It was not a sly
face&mdash;exactly. Or was it? Subtle it certainly was. Trying to
sum her up, the rector to his dismay realised that he had no
fixed ideas at all about her. Yet he could not help her if he
could not reach her. And you cannot reach a land whose latitude
and longitude are unknown to you.</p>

<p>He walked on, his light footsteps inaudible on the thick soft
turf. Suddenly he stopped. In a natural recess which nearly
enclosed them stood two figures. Avery recognised the trim slight
figure of Byrd by the erect carriage and the challenging tilt of
the square chin, in the same instant he saw that the slighter,
shorter figure beside Byrd was Olive Hill. Both had their backs
turned to him. From her attitude, she was talking earnestly. Byrd
was listening with head bent, poking the earth with the cane that
he always carried. Something about his attitude suggested anger,
but as he turned his face slightly, the light was on it, and
Avery saw Byrd was smiling that saturnine, malicious smile of
his. Meeting it, Olive threw back her head and with a quick
farewell nod slipped on out of sight. Byrd stood a full minute
before he took the same path, one which led on past The Causeway
to his own little cottage farther down the road.</p>

<p>Avery was slightly disturbed. There had been a suggestion of
intimacy&mdash;of secretiveness&mdash;in the place. But at any
rate this meeting was no lovers' talk...there had been something
very unpleasant in Byrd's smile...Pondering earnestly on the
right course to take about his sister's surprising companion, the
rector made for his home by a short cut. He finally decided to do
nothing for two more days. Then there would have to be a thorough
clearing up of the position. But by that time he hoped to have
come to some definite decision.

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER THREE</h2>

<p class="first">NEXT morning, Friday, the rector was in his study
before breakfast. The waiting that he had imposed on himself was
a strain. It did not seem fair to Olive either. She and Doris
were making plans for the wedding&mdash;Grace had very sensibly
gone away for the time being to stay with a friend who lived
nearby, but who was tied to her room as the result of a car
accident. She would come back on the Monday when, the rector had
told her, he and she could thrash out what had best be done.</p>

<p>Doris had taken it for granted that Olive was no longer a
companion, but was merely staying on at the rectory as a guest.
This put the rector in a most uncomfortable position. But he
could not alter it at the moment.</p>

<p>He pulled some papers towards himself, and took up his pen. He
was busy bringing out a <i>Life of Saint</i> Paul. In another
moment the machine began to work, the wheels to turn, the wings
to lift, and then he was up and away; far away from the problems
of ordinary life. In short, he was that enviable thing a writer
in full swing.</p>

<p>Fraser, the butler, came into the study, and stood in the door
which led into the library. The two rooms opened out of each
other.</p>

<p>"Major Weir-Opie to see you, sir."</p>

<p>Major Weir-Opie was the Chief Constable of the county. He and
the rector were old friends.</p>

<p>"Put them on the writing table," murmured Avery without
looking up, "and I hope they're riper than the last lot."</p>

<p>"It's not fresh apples, sir, it's Major Weir-Opie to see you,
and I've shown him into the study."</p>

<p>Avery came to earth. Rising, he went into the next room and
greeted a short, thick-set, straight-backed, man warmly.
Weir-Opie had a red face with keen eyes, and a business-like
expression.</p>

<p>"I've called on very tragic business," he said at once, "but I
wanted to let you know immediately, and I hoped to find you
alone. Anthony Revell has just been found shot dead at The
Causeway. Apparently he had an accident with his revolver. It was
lying under his fingers."</p>

<p>Mr. Avery was profoundly shocked.</p>

<p>"But I thought&mdash;we thought&mdash;that he was away in
Derbyshire."</p>

<p>Weir-Opie agreed. "We thought so too. We had entered the name
of The Causeway on the list of houses on which to keep an eye
during the owner's absence. Well, he evidently returned late last
night.</p>

<p>"One of our constables patrolled all round the house at ten
last night and it was shut up then, he says. Yet a milkman, who
called there at half-past seven this morning for some bottles
that the cook had promised to put out when she left, and which he
hadn't had time to fetch before, saw that one of the ground floor
windows was standing wide open. He went to the back, to ask if he
should leave any milk, and got no reply. He tapped on the open
window and got none either. Meeting P.C. Marsh a little later, he
spoke about it to him. The constable went to investigate, and
found Revell's sports car in the garage, and his dead body
stretched out in the drawing-room."</p>

<p>Avery was astounded. Why had Revell returned home without a
word to any one, or had it been without a word?</p>

<p>The other continued:</p>

<p>"He lay in the drawing-room beside a table on which was a box
of cartridges. Close to one hand was the revolver, beside the
other a cleaning cloth. He must have been cleaning the revolver
and possibly caught the cloth in it. The shot went through his
temple&mdash;the right temple. Death must have been
instantaneous. Absolutely."</p>

<p>"What a dreadful affair," Avery repeated slowly, "does Lady
Revell know yet?"</p>

<p>"She heard of it with fortitude," Weir-Opie said rather dryly.
"I went there before coming here. Gilbert is now the heir, I
suppose, and he has always been his mother's idol."</p>

<p>"What about that lady artist&mdash;Mrs. Green, though I
understood that she wouldn't be at The Causeway any more."</p>

<p>"Nothing to keep her there, you mean?" Weir-Opie asked in the
same tone. "No, she was with Lady Revell. Returned Monday
evening, it seems. Gilbert spoke of fetching her to hear the
news. Lady Revell sensibly shut him up. She says she has no idea
why Anthony was at The Causeway. We think that he came back for
something forgotten, heard some one prowling around; we've had a
good few housebreaking jobs lately that we can't account
for&mdash;opened his drawing-room window so as to hear or see
better&mdash;got out his revolver, he bought one some months ago
for just that purpose, and then as nothing happened and time
began to drag, he began to tinker with his revolver&mdash;was
careless and killed himself. The doctor thinks he must have shot
himself around about one o'clock."</p>

<p>The telephone rang beside them.</p>

<p>"That'll probably be for me. I told my men I should come in
here next."</p>

<p>It was for Weir-Opie, who listened, murmured "Good!" and hung
up.</p>

<p>"We've got into touch with the couple with whom Revell was
climbing. They say that he told them early yesterday morning that
he must go back to London to see his dentist about an aching
tooth. He drove off around nine. That accounts for his being able
to drop in at his home last night. He evidently came on here
after having had his teeth attended to, to fetch something he
wanted while away. Now to the next step, Padre. Lady Revell told
me that she had just had a letter from Anthony&mdash;she's been
away till Tuesday and so didn't see him when he left&mdash;saying
that he was engaged to a Miss Olive Hill, who, she tells me, is
Miss Avery's companion, and that she was on the point of coming
over to see Miss Hill and get up a dinner-party for her, when I
brought her the news of this. That's why I came on at once from
The Flagstaff to you. It's a terrible thing to have happened. Is
the young lady in?"</p>

<p>The words were a fresh shock. Avery had forgotten Olive for
the moment. What an appalling piece of news for her. Whatever her
faults, what a dreadful blow!</p>

<p>Avery rose and with a word of excuse went up to Doris's
sitting-room. Some one was on a couch, her head buried in the
cushions. As he stood a moment he heard a sound as of an animal
in agony. It was too late to withdraw. Doris, for it was she, had
sensed a presence in the room. She sat up with a jerk.</p>

<p>"I locked my door," she began in a harsh sort of whisper.</p>

<p>"My dear Doris!" came from the doorway. It was Grace just
entering. "I had no idea that you cared for poor Anthony like
this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Anthony?" came from Doris in a sort of screech. "Who cares
about Anthony It's Richard!" There was no mistaking the lack of
affection in the one case, the agony in the second.</p>

<p>"But what's happened?" Grace was aghast as Doris staggered to
her feet.</p>

<p>"I've had no letter, and I told him I should count the days,"
Doris said wildly.</p>

<p>"But there <i>was</i> a letter for you that came yesterday. I
sent Olive to you with it at once. She wanted to ask you about
some dress or other." Grace was speaking to Doris.</p>

<p>"She didn't give it to me. I haven't had a line for
ages&mdash;I thought&mdash;I thought&mdash;" Without finishing,
Doris, with a travesty of her usual grace, fairly swept the two
from her room under the plea of a frightful headache.</p>

<p>Grace stepped into her own.</p>

<p>"She's been worrying lately. Something that Violet-May Witson
said started it, I think," Grace whispered.</p>

<p>Lady Witson was a dreadful gossip as they both knew. And one
of her brothers was a fellow Commissioner out in West Africa.</p>

<p>"But what does she mean about not having had Dick's last
letter? As I met Olive running down with some patterns that Doris
had promised to help her with yesterday, I handed her the letter.
She went on straight into the room, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"Well, we can't ask about it now," remarked the rector.</p>

<p>Grace nodded and gave him a meaning look. "No need to worry
about telling poor Anthony now, and you would have had to tell
him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How did you know that something had happened to him?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"The milkman, of course! He told cook. Cook told Margery who
brings in my tea. Well, I wanted the engagement broken off, as
you know, but hardly like this I <i>can't</i> understand it! Poor
Anthony!"</p>

<p>She stopped as Doris, looking herself again, came in.</p>

<p>"Where's Olive?" she asked. "I want that letter from Dick that
you gave her, Grace."</p>

<p>"And John wants to break some bad news to her."</p>

<p>"Bad news? Is Anthony ill? Was that what you meant just now?
I'm afraid I was too wrapped up about Dick to care what had
happened to any one else." She was facing the rector.</p>

<p>"It'll be a shock to you too, though," he said now. "Revell is
dead, Doris."</p>

<p>She stared at him open-mouthed.</p>

<p>"It seems that he has accidentally shot himself," he
explained. "Weir-Opie has just told me. He thinks Anthony was
cleaning his revolver and did something awkward&mdash;a bullet
went through his temple."</p>

<p>"How awful!" breathed Doris. "What will that poor girl do?
What a dreadful thing for her!"</p>

<p>"I want to tell her at once. Weir-Opie wonders if she knew
that Anthony was back last night."</p>

<p>"Back? But he's away rock-climbing surely. How could he be
back! You don't mean&mdash;" her tone grew more shocked still
"&mdash;that it happened at The Causeway?"</p>

<p>He nodded gravely. "In the drawing-room there. I don't know
more myself."</p>

<p>"I'll find her," Doris volunteered. "And I'll let the letter
stand over for the time being."</p>

<p>For a moment the rector wished that he could also let her
break the news to Olive. But with all her attractiveness, Doris
was not a religious woman at all. And in moments such as this,
the only consolation was that which religion had to offer. It
might, probably would, fail, but there was no other.</p>

<p>The two women left him, and a minute later Olive came in,
looking very confident and smiling.</p>

<p>Avery stepped forward and took her hand.</p>

<p>"My dear girl," he said in a very kind voice, for after all
she was engaged to the dead boy. After all a smile and a pat, or
even a jarring laugh might mean little. "Prepare yourself for bad
news. Very bad news. Sit down here&mdash;" and then he told her
just what the Chief Constable had told him. It seemed to turn her
to stone. Before her pallid silence Avery was at a loss, for it
had some unexpected quality in it that he felt, but could not
name. Of personal grief, as he expected to meet it, there was
practically none.</p>

<p>Had she not loved Anthony then? Had she only accepted him as
what he was, in one sense, a marvellous stroke of luck? The
rector had had his doubts on that score since yesterday, but he
had told himself that it was not fair to probe too deeply into
her motives.</p>

<p>"Major Weir-Opie wonders whether you would let him ask you a
few questions," he went on.</p>

<p>She made for the door without a word. The Major turned at her
entry with some apprehension. But a glance at her tearless face
relieved him. He looked at her with secret curiosity. Anthony
Revell was a young man who could have married any one, and he had
chosen this girl, Olive Hill, a companion here at the rectory.
True, Anthony Revell had always seemed quite unconscious of his
position as fortune's favourite, a country life and books had
always seemed to attract him more than the smart world, but even
so, he was a prize in the matrimonial market, and this
white-faced girl had won it. She was, he saw, quite pretty, but
still&mdash;and then she raised her eyes.</p>

<p>"Anything's possible with those eyes," he thought, meeting
them full on. They were so intelligent. They seemed to be asking
something of him...or trying to suggest something to him...The
Major felt touched. He expressed his sincere sympathy with her in
her great loss. Then he asked if she knew about Revell's return
to his house some time last night after ten o'clock?</p>

<p>She said that she only knew what the others knew, that Anthony
was joining a friend and his sister rock-climbing, as the three
had arranged months before. Anthony's engagement to her was to be
publicly announced on his return. The delay in doing this was her
wish.</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Hill," the Chief Constable went on, "had he any
valuables in the house? Anything that would especially attract
thieves?"</p>

<p>"He had lots of cups," she said, after a long silence.</p>

<p>He cocked his head to one side. Cups nowadays, with silver at
the price it was&mdash;not much temptation, besides Major
Weir-Opie had an idea that Revell sent his silver to the bank when he
left his house for any length of time, and he was leaving for a
fortnight, wasn't he?</p>

<p>Except for the cups, Olive seemed to have no suggestion to
make.</p>

<p>"You're wearing no ring," he went on a little anxiously. Tears
must be near, he did not want to start the flood. "I wondered
whether by any chance he would have the ring he meant to give you
at the house? Would that be possible?"</p>

<p>She said that she did not think it likely. He intended to
bring her the ring on his return. A London firm was setting
it.</p>

<p>And then, since she could not apparently help him with any
information, Major Weir-Opie left. Olive, palely composed, held
out a hand which he found icy to the touch. She turned at once
and went up to her room, locking herself in.</p>

<p>Weir-Opie hurried away.</p>

<p>The rector walked up and down his study. No need now to raise
the question of Grace's terrible accusation. No need for him to
prevent the marriage now. He felt the sincerest pity for Olive,
and yet she baffled him.</p>

<p>He had his car sent round; he must call at once on Lady
Revell. But when nearly at the flagstaff he had his man take the
turning to The Causeway, where the tragedy had happened. The
house, a large one, lay isolated but for one cottage on the
winding road, the cottage where lived the unsatisfactory Captain
Byrd, or Mr. Byrd as he preferred to be called.</p>

<p>The door of The Causeway was standing open. A policeman rose
from his chair in the hall and saluted as the rector stepped in.
Jamieson, the young butler whom Byrd had got Anthony to try, and
who was doing well, came forward, his face working.</p>

<p>"They sent word," he explained. "I came up at once,
sir&mdash;not that I can do anything now&mdash;but at least I'm
here."</p>

<p>"The other servants?"</p>

<p>"No need for them to come back, the Major says, till the
inquest to-morrow, sir."</p>

<p>The rector stepped into the room, the drawing-room which had
been turned by Jamieson and the gardeners into a sort of chapel.
It had a raised part at one end and there, on a draped bed, lay a
long, motionless figure covered with a beautiful Chinese rug.</p>

<p>The rector spent a quarter of an hour beside the dead boy,
then he let himself out and continued along the road to The
Flagstaff. This was a big house which stood behind high walls. It
had, unlike the homely Causeway, regular entrance gates, and a
lodge beside them. There was quite a sweep up to the front door,
of a size that suggested that nothing under a Rolls or a Bentley
could ever stop here. There were footmen. There was a butler.
There was a general air of exalting the fussiness of life, that
had always amused the rector, for the Admiral had considered
anything less than a dozen servants as squalor. Small wonder that
Gilbert lent a discreet ear&mdash;when his mother was out of the
way&mdash;to some of Byrd's stinging words, Byrd whose theory was
that no man should serve another, except the latter were a
cripple or over the age of ninety. Anthony, with the excuse of
attachment to his grandfather, had early escaped to The Causeway,
where life was more to his liking.</p>

<p>Lady Revell, dressed in pale blue, rose to receive the rector.
She flung her cigarette into the fire and motioned him to a seat
beside her. Her face wore its usual thick coating of white, on
which level black eyebrows were beautifully drawn above her eyes,
which were small and close-set.</p>

<p>She had strange eyes, had Lady Revell. Green as the sea, and
of an infinite melancholy unless she were laughing, when they
could glitter like cut glass.</p>

<p>"I was just thinking, as you came in, Mr. Avery," she said in
her rich deep voice, a voice with an enormous amount of verve and
'go' in it, "that one doesn't trust Providence half enough."</p>

<p>The rector was surprised. Piety had not been a quality which
he had ever found in Lady Revell.</p>

<p>"I've been a pig to Anthony," she continued in a remorseful
tone, "because Gilbert was so obviously better fitted to have all
that money that it made me wild. And, after all, in the end, its
Gilbert, and not Anthony, who is to have it."</p>

<p>She had been a pig indeed. The rector knew how the elder boy
had felt the frost that seemed to grow harder and more severe
with each year after Gilbert was born. Lady Revell might well
feel remorse now. She had acted as though she hated Anthony
because his grandfather had left him his vast fortune. But for
the genuine sweetness of Anthony's nature she might have ruined
his temper. As it was, she had saddened the lad. Still, it was
something to find that the mother had come again to the surface,
the mother who used to be so fond of little Anthony, before
Gilbert came to sweep all her affection up to himself.</p>

<p>They talked a while of the death. Lady Revell asked warmly
about Olive, and, just as Anthony had thought, did not seem
opposed to the match. "She might have steadied him," she said
finally, "and he needed steadying. His looks were too much for
most women. I know of two at least around here who would have
gone any length."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Green for one," murmured Gilbert, who had just come in.
"The silly woman was really off her chump about him."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Green for one," agreed Lady Revell. "But scandal bores
the rector;" and they talked of the dreadful accident
instead.</p>

<p>Gilbert was only eighteen years old, and though to the rector,
as to his father and grandfather, he had none of the charm of
Anthony, Anthony the sunny who never lost his temper, never
complained, never blamed others, Gilbert was not without his
friends. Spoiled he was, but he had unexpected grit in him which
had refused to let his mother turn him into a pet. He had
insisted on going to Rugby, and that breezy and robust school had
liked him, while Anthony was a true son of Eton. The two brothers
had been fond of each other, which spoke well for both. And now
all that had been meant for the one would go to the other, with
probably a good slice for Lady Revell. She was Irish, a sailor's
daughter, and had no settlements, the rector knew, and from
certain signs at The Flagstaff he was sure that she was hard
pressed for money lately. The Admiral had had no idea of
retrenchment, and there were hair-raising tales told of the
extravagance that still went on in the servants' hall.</p>

<p>The rector drove away feeling that his dislike of Lady Revell
had been mistaken, that in spite of her biting tongue to Anthony,
she had really loved her first-born.

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4"></a>CHAPTER FOUR</h2>

<p class="first">LUNCH next day was a painful meal. Olive sent
word that she was going for a long walk, and would not be back
till late in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The rector seemed to see still before him that handsome young
face which had turned to him at this very table so short a time
ago.</p>

<p>Grace had returned and was very silent.</p>

<p>"When is the inquest on Anthony to be held?" Doris asked after
a long interval of silence.</p>

<p>"This afternoon," Mr. Avery said. "It's a foregone
conclusion&mdash;the verdict I mean. Poor Anthony, I should have
thought, was the last man to be awkward in handling anything, let
alone a gun!"</p>

<p>"I suppose it couldn't have been suicide?" Grace asked in a
low voice. The sweet was on the table and the servants were
gone.</p>

<p>"Suicide!" Doris stopped helping her sister-in-law to the
tart. "What on earth?"</p>

<p>"What put that idea into your head, Grace?" the rector asked
gravely, "or rather what made you say it." He wondered if Grace
were developing a tendency to wild statements.</p>

<p>"Well, it's all so funny," Grace said irritably. "Olive was
out last night; no one knows this of course, but it's a fact. I
went to her room for some toothache drops I knew were in that
wall cupboard in there, and she wasn't there. That was nearly
midnight. Her bed hadn't been slept in. She says she was up on
the roof watching the stars, as she does at times. But I'm
wondering whether she met Anthony and told him that she didn't
want to be engaged to him&mdash;that she didn't love
him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But she did!" broke in Doris imperiously.</p>

<p>"You chose to think she did," was the tart reply, "and so
engineered that ridiculous engagement, but Olive didn't care for
him. That was her charm for Anthony, I think. Such a contrast to
most of the women he'd met. No, Doris, you spoilt a girl who was
in most ways one of the best companions I shall ever have and all
to no purpose. She was quite happy here with me."</p>

<p>Doris helped her brother-in-law to apple tart, and passed him
the cream with an expression that said that she considered
Grace's words not worth a reply.</p>

<p>"What do you say?" he now asked turning to her.</p>

<p>"Of course she was in love with Anthony!" she said with
certainty. "Why, the two were all eyes and sighs for weeks past.
Violet-May suspected Anthony of being in love with Grace," she
said maliciously&mdash;Doris could say very cutting things in her
light easy way&mdash;"<i>you</i> believed he wanted to flirt with
me," she added as Grace's face flushed&mdash;"but it was Olive
all the time&mdash;from first to last."</p>

<p>"Except when it was Mrs. Green!" Grace said.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Green!" scoffed Doris. "Mrs. Green is an artist, Grace.
She adored Anthony's good looks and she liked him personally as
well. But as to the garbage that people talk about her being in
love with him&mdash;" Doris made a sweep of the sugar sifter do
duty for her opinion of that.</p>

<p>Remembering Anthony's own words about how irksome he had
himself found Mrs. Green when Olive came into his life, the
rector felt uncomfortable, but the two young women were not
looking at him.</p>

<p>"You're bound to take that view, as you engineered the whole
affair," Grace said in a very unconvinced voice.</p>

<p>"No, Cupid did that," laughed Doris. "I simply arranged with
you to let me get Olive to design and engineer those chair covers
for me," and Doris, with an excuse to the two, rose from the
table with her usual air of swift decision, which suggested the
brisk alert mind which she turned to everything. Just as Grace's
slow languid way of getting out of her chair suggested the
uncertainty that was an integral part of her nature too.</p>

<p>The inquest was soon over. At no time was it interesting
except to the local people who crowded the room. Lady Revell,
looking almost indecently cheerful, was there with Gilbert who
wore a very sober expression. Near them sat Mrs. Green. Some of
those present refused at first to recognise the middle-aged,
badly dressed woman with the deep pockets under her eyes.</p>

<p>"If that really is Mrs. Green and not her mother, she must
have made-up well up to now," was the general spoken or unspoken
comment.</p>

<p>First came the evidence of identification, which, as the
Coroner was also the Revells' family solicitor, was purely
perfunctory. Then came the evidence of the police as to how the
body had been found.</p>

<p>Then came the evidence of Anthony's manservant, who spoke of
his master's high spirits before he left and coyly admitted, when
pressed, that he had told him, Jamieson, about his coming
engagement to Miss Hill. He identified the revolver found on the
table as one which Mr. Revell had bought a month or so ago, when
there were so many cases of housebreaking around them, saying
that as The Causeway was so isolated and so hidden in trees, it
might be as well to have one in the house. The revolver was kept
in an unlocked drawer in Mr. Revell's bedroom. He had no idea, he
said, as to what brought his master home last night. Mr. Revell
had apparently touched nothing in the house but some mixed
biscuits and the whisky and soda. As to why he should have gone
to the drawing-room&mdash;Mr. Revell liked that room of an
evening. But as to why he should have had his revolver with him,
the servant professed to have no idea=beyond the obvious one of
Mr. Revell having seen some suspicious person loitering about, or
heard footsteps.</p>

<p>The doctor gave evidence next. He described the wound which
had been made by the entry of the bullet in the right ear. The
scorch marks showed that the weapon must have been practically
touching the head, and the passage of the bullet had been on a
dead level; it looked to him as though Revell had had his head
turned sidewise down over the revolver, as though to look along
the table top at the moment when the fatal shot was fired. Dr.
Black did not insist that he shot himself in that position, but
the course of the bullet suggested it. Dr. Black went on to say
that Revell was a most casual young man, and while holding the
revolver in his right hand, might very easily have made some
incautious movement with the cloth in his left hand which had
sent a bullet through his head. The doctor showed just what he
meant. He thought that Anthony had been about eight hours dead
when he was found. Which meant that he had been killed around one
o'clock in the morning. Black was a young man, also a Cambridge
graduate, and he and Revell had been very friendly. He spoke of
his certainty that there was no reason whatever for Revell to
have taken his own life. He too had been told of the engagement
which was to be announced on his return from the climbing
holiday. The doctor had happened to pass him on the road as he
started off, and Revell had said that he was the happiest man in
the world.</p>

<p>The two friends with whom Anthony had been climbing were
called next. They were a brother and sister of the name of
Gartside. The latter, a plain-faced, very resolute-looking young
woman of around thirty to thirty-five, the former a little older,
with a taciturn expression. Both were very short in their
replies, but both told how on Thursday morning, two days after
they had started their climbs, Revell, who seemed in excellent
spirits, came down to breakfast with a very worried look and said
he that must go back to London at once to his dentist to have a
tooth put right that was worrying him badly. He expected to be
back on Friday in the afternoon. Revell had suffered agonies from
toothache once before when climbing a rock exposed to the east
wind.</p>

<p>In answer to a question by the foreman, the jury learnt that
the dentist to whom Revell usually went, was away on holiday just
then, but the secretary said that at least two
people&mdash;men&mdash;had rung up Thursday in the late
afternoon, and on hearing that he was away had declined to make
any appointment. Revell might have been one of these.</p>

<p>The police gave further evidence of the undisturbed appearance
of the body, the room, the house and the garage, of Revell's
fingerprints on the revolver, and, in answer to a question of the
Coroner said that they had no reason to think that death was
other than due to misadventure.</p>

<p>The jury brought in a verdict accordingly, and expressed their
profound sympathy with the family and friends of the deceased.
The inquest was over.</p>

<p>The funeral would be next day. Gartside and his sister were
staying for it.</p>

<p>The little group from the rectory had listened with the
closest attention. Seeing how white Olive looked, the rector told
himself that he must be wrong. That she must have loved Anthony,
but that her feelings were evidently of the kind that burrow
deep. And yet, as he met her eyes on helping her into his car
when it was over, he was struck by their expression, so secretive
and yet so fierce. Again he felt sure that here there was no
grief as he knew it. A strange girl this...</p>

<p>As Doris put her foot on the step a telegraph boy jumped off
his bicycle and handed her a cable.</p>

<p>"From Las Palmas," Doris murmured as she tore it open. She
read a few lines and gave a cry of joy. Without speaking, quite
heedless of the others, she turned and set off for the rectory at
a pace that suggested a desire to be alone.</p>

<p>Grace, unlike her brother, had no clue to Las Palmas, but
Avery guessed that Richard had already started for home. He had
written him that he would probably fly from Ashanti&mdash;his
nearest town&mdash;to Las Palmas, there to wait for a friend with
some papers which would need signing before he could proceed to
England.</p>

<p>Lady Revell came out towards her own car. She stopped and gave
Olive a warm handclasp. The rector thought that but for the
ramrod stiffness of the girl she would have kissed her. "I want
you to come to us," Lady Revell said softly, "I want you to come
and stay at The Flagstaff, Olive, and let us get to know each
other. Gilbert here feels just as I do&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, rather!" said Gilbert awkwardly, but with emphasis. His
eyes were very friendly as he looked at the girl who, but for
this unexpected tragedy, would have been his sister-in-law. Olive
did not look at either mother or son.</p>

<p>"I don't think I can...I can't leave Miss Avery at
once&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lady Revell was very sweet and soothing, and let the
invitation drop for the moment as she moved away to speak to a
very smartly-turned-out young woman, thin as a rail, whose
expensive perfume filled the air, whose paint lay like plaster on
her cheeks, and yet Lady Witson was good-looking in her own way,
with a very intelligent face under all its make-up. And she was
quite young&mdash;well under thirty.</p>

<p>As for Grace and her brother, they drove to the rectory in
silence, each busy with their own thoughts.</p>

<p>On the rectory steps, they heard Doris's laugh floating out
through the open window. Joyous and happy. Free and clear.
Looking into the morning-room Grace and the rector came on Doris
radiant, hugging a letter to her heart.</p>

<p>"I've found it behind the hall table. And the cable is its
postscript. He's coming home! He's left the Service He's going to
buy a place near you, Jack! He's at Las Palmas!&mdash;" Doris was
almost incoherent with sheer joy.</p>

<p>"You sound happy&mdash;" Grace said almost reprovingly. "It's
not a very happy day for most of us&mdash;" she looked after
Olive who had run on up the stairs.</p>

<p>"I know! I know!" Doris's tone was remorseful for a second
only, "But I'm too happy to live!"</p>

<p>The rector thought of Anthony's words to Doctor Black. He
could not but be pleased at the joy shown by Doris after her
agony of Thursday morning. It might not indicate a high degree of
unselfishness, so to forget Anthony and Olive, but who could be
vexed with a wife looking as Doris looked now at hearing that her
husband was on his way home?</p>

<p>"Well," Grace said, closing the door, "did you think that
Olive acted to Lucy Revell as to her all-but mother-in-law? You
can see now that I was right. Olive didn't care for
Anthony&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have no way of guessing what goes on inside Olive Hill's
heart," the rector said, "presumably she has one, but only
presumably."</p>

<p>"I think it's given to young Byrd."</p>

<p>The rector frowned. "You said that before. I hope not, I
sincerely hope not. How could she have got to know him
sufficiently. I should have thought that you would have seen to
it that Olive did not see much of him," the rector said in a tone
of some warmth. "She's in your charge. An orphan girl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear Jack&mdash;" Grace only called him that when she was
very annoyed, "you know as well as I do that Olive has all along
done what she liked&mdash;apart from her set duties I mean, and
whom she saw, or when she saw them, are things no one knows but
herself."</p>

<p>"Then what makes you persist in thinking&mdash;" began the
rector.</p>

<p>"I saw her kissing Byrd about a fortnight ago. Lost to the
world, my dear."</p>

<p>"A good-bye perhaps," the rector said shortly.</p>

<p>"Oh, probably," Grace agreed, "Olive is very thorough. She
would never try to play a double game. But that's what I meant by
wondering if Anthony might not have shot himself. He was spoilt,
passionate, and really immensely in love. And if she told him
that after all she loved Byrd&mdash;and he knew he had lost
her&mdash;she's a most fascinating person, John."</p>

<p>"Really?" he asked dryly.</p>

<p>"Oh, quite inexplicably so. You notice her absence, you notice
her all the time. I don't know what she's going to do
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I hope not marry Byrd," the rector said gravely. "Putting
aside what you told me about her, you must do your best to
prevent that. Byrd has no standards, no health, no morals, no
desire to work&mdash;nothing that would mean happiness if he had
to provide for two. His temper is proverbial&mdash;it's won him
the nickname, of Blackbird. As for the rest, he told me that he
had thirty shillings a week to live on and not a hope of a penny
more. He bought that cottage he has called The Hut with money he
won on a bet. He can just manage to live on his lordly
income&mdash;somehow. But a wife?"</p>

<p>"Funny," Grace now said, "I was just thinking that no one
seems to care much for Anthony's death, and yet a month ago one
would have said that every one would be awfully grieved. I except
that artist woman&mdash;she is all in."</p>

<p>"And you can except me, and yourself too, and Gilbert, and
Lady Revell, and many many other people, Grace," the rector said
firmly. "But as a matter of fact, I don't think that most of us
can realise yet that Anthony is gone. That we shall never see his
handsome face again&mdash;nor hear his eager voice&mdash;" and
real emotion made the rector stop for a moment, before going on
to his study.</p>

<p>On the Monday, Doris woke with a vague feeling that some sound
in her room had wakened her. She sat up and looked at the clock
beside her bed. It was only a little past five, when as a rule
she was in her soundest sleep. Could the cat have got in? Bending
lithely over her bed, she called it. Nothing stirred. Then she
saw that one of her slippers was lying on its side and had
evidently been stepped on. Not by Doris. She had put them as
usual side by side ready to thrust her feet into. That was what
had wakened her. She lay back and tried to think out what it
meant. She had nothing in her room worth stealing. Nothing of any
interest to any one. Yet some one had stepped on her slipper,
which meant that they must have been very near her bed, been
bending over it, or over her...But she was very sleepy and,
turning over, she fell asleep again on the instant.</p>

<p>After breakfast, Olive stepped into the morning-room. She
wanted to know whether Doris could use her services as a
secretary "or anything of that sort." From things Doris had said,
Olive thought that there might be a great deal to do just now,
before her husband got back home...</p>

<p>Doris was puzzled. It seemed to her an odd request. What about
Grace? she asked, for since Olive's engagement the three women
called each other by their Christian names.</p>

<p>"I want to get work as a secretary rather than a companion,"
Olive said, "and I can't do that without having a reference for
my work. If I could stay with you for a while&mdash;it would be a
help&mdash;"</p>

<p>Doris fuzzled the cat's ear and thought hard. Something lay
behind this request, or rather this plan. What? Curiosity was
always strong in Doris.</p>

<p>"But you have to know shorthand to be a secretary," she said
finally.</p>

<p>"I'm fairly good at it," Olive replied, "I've been having
lessons in it. I've taken down the rector's last sermons quite
easily. He speaks fairly slowly of course, but I shall improve, I
know."</p>

<p>Doris laughed. "So that's why you have taken to coming to
church, is it?" she said easily. "I wondered at it when I heard
you had been there. Grace and I have to go, of course, in common
decency whenever the rector himself preaches, but I
wondered&mdash;" She had thought that Olive had merely gone to
show that she knew what would be expected of her after her
marriage.</p>

<p>So, Olive had only gone to practise her shorthand. But surely,
as Revell's wife, Olive would not have needed shorthand. Doris's
eyes spoke for her. Olive read them correctly.</p>

<p>"I began to learn shorthand months ago. And I always hate to
lose anything I have learnt how to do, don't you?"</p>

<p>Doris agreed that she did. But it was odd...just as it was odd
being wakened this morning by some one tripping over her slipper.
Doris was puzzled by Olive. She wondered what she was up to.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you rather go quite away for a while," she asked in
a kindly voice.</p>

<p>Olive shook a decided head. "It would make it worse. I would
very much like to stay on here until I can make up my mind what
to do next."</p>

<p>"If you've really made up your mind to leave Grace, and if she
doesn't grudge me you," Doris said in her pretty and flattering
way, "I shall be only too glad to have your help," and on that
Olive went on up to her own room. Doris looked in on Grace, and
told her of what had just been arranged.</p>

<p>"That is, if you don't mind?" she wound up.</p>

<p>"Now perhaps you'll believe me that she's in love with Byrd?"
Grace said, laying down a letter she was reading.</p>

<p>"I confess I'm beginning to think you may be right&mdash;about
whom it was she really cared for. Though, mind you, all I was
certain of was that Anthony was in love with her. I never
pretended to be sure about her feelings."</p>

<p>Grace let this pass. She looked very uncertain about
something.</p>

<p>"She wants to earn a good reference for her work," Doris said
after a little pause. "Rather pathetic considering how near she
was to being a wealthy woman."</p>

<p>"I understand Lady Revell and Gilbert intend to settle The
Causeway on her for life, and a sufficient income to keep it up,"
Grace said.</p>

<p>"Yes. And Violet-May says that Mrs. Green is doing her best to
put a spoke in that wheel. She wants to buy The Causeway herself
it seems."</p>

<p>Doris did not pay any attention to any speeches of Lady
Witson's. She was notoriously inaccurate, to put it politely,
though there were those who called her plainly an awful liar.</p>

<p>"You have no objection to my taking on Olive?" she asked,
"frankly she would be a tremendous help just now. It would save
my having to find a secretary who knows my ways, and is as clever
as Olive is."</p>

<p>"She's very clever," Grace said hesitatingly, "very capable.
You never have to tell her anything twice. And her loss makes one
terribly sorry for her. I mean merely her loss of position and
wealth. I really don't know what to say, Doris. Try her by all
means&mdash;but&mdash;I'm not sure whether I ought not&mdash;"
she stopped uncertainly. "You might ask John&mdash;" she
suggested.</p>

<p>Doris was glancing at some letters. She had only heard the
first words. She looked up.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll try Olive, partly because I want to see what's her
object in staying on in the house. Oh, I know what she says. But
what's behind her words?"</p>

<p>"To be near Byrd," was Grace's confident reply. "I don't think
that you understood the position at all, Doris. Anthony may have
been in love with Olive, but she was, and is, in love with Byrd,
who in his turn doesn't care in the least for her. To make the
circle complete, of course, he ought to be in love with Mrs.
Green," she wound up regretfully.</p>

<p>Downstairs in his study the rector was talking to Mr. Smith,
the Coroner.</p>

<p>"I was sorry you weren't at the reading of the will this
morning," Mr. Smith was saying. "We couldn't get it out of the
bank in time on Saturday." He had invited the rector to be
present. "Everything was left to Gilbert. Bar a few legacies.
There was one for you. I've dropped in to tell you of it."</p>

<p>"His stamp collection?" Avery asked.</p>

<p>"No, his Vauxhall. Insurance paid to the end of the year. A
very lively car apparently, judging from the time he drove her
here from Derbyshire the day before yesterday, stopping in at
town on the way too. I understand she does a hundred in the
shade. Anyway, it's his fastest car."</p>

<p>"It was a kind thought," the rector said gratefully. "My own
car is very slow. He told me years ago that he was going to leave
me one of his cars in his will, but I thought that that was only
a joke. Who gets his stamp collection?"</p>

<p>"It's not mentioned specifically. The Gartsides may, since
they're to choose as souvenirs any four articles which are in his
house at the time of his death&mdash;bar furniture or family
portraits. Is his stamp collection a good one?"</p>

<p>"Not as far as I know. But he was talking of it when he dined
here a week ago&mdash;only a week ago, Smith!&mdash;I have some
boys in the clubs I run who collect&mdash;what they can. Unwanted
stamps are always welcome therefore, and he said he'd let me have
his albums to distribute when he got back, as he'd given up
collecting years ago. As a matter of fact, the very last thing he
did was to leave some stamps that he had mentioned, here at the
door, before he drove on up to town."</p>

<p>The two talked very kindly of the dead young man.</p>

<p>"I suppose," Smith said finally rising and reaching for his
hat, "I suppose&mdash;eh&mdash;you were at the
inquest&mdash;eh&mdash;strange affair, that death!"</p>

<p>"Terribly," Avery said.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith still lingered, pinching the crown of his felt hat
in quite a spiteful way. Then he seemed to decide that there was
nothing more to be said, and held out his hand. He himself looked
rather troubled as he walked away after telling the rector that
the car would be sent around when certain formalities were
completed, which would probably be in about a month's time.</p>

<p>Grace looked in on her brother when he was alone.</p>

<p>"Olive wants to become a secretary, and Doris is willing to
try her out. I haven't said anything. I've missed nothing more. I
don't know what's the right thing to do?</p>

<p>"Olive's to have a fresh chance? Good," said Avery kindly. "I
sometimes think that interesting work could cure any criminal,
Grace. And a companion's life is not a normal one for a
girl...We'll see how she shapes with Doris."</p>

<p>The rector did not add that there would be no question of
stolen articles not being instantly missed by Doris. Olive must
know this. Supposing Grace to have made no mistake&mdash;of which
the rector did not feel at all sure&mdash;it looked as
though&mdash;if a pilferer in the past&mdash;Olive meant to go
straight now, or she would not have asked to work for keen-eyed,
business-like Mrs. Richard Avery, who had no old ties of
friendship to blind her.

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5"></a>CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

<p class="first">Two weeks passed and apparently left no trace of
their going except that by a tacit agreement Anthony Revell was
rarely mentioned. His ending was too sad for his name to be
spoken easily, and the result was that to a stranger it was as
though he had never been. The Causeway still belonged to a
Revell, only the first name of the owner was Gilbert instead of
Anthony. But Mrs. Green never came to paint in it, and Olive
avoided it after a week of daily visits. It was when coming away
from the last of these, that she almost walked into Mrs. Green,
who was standing by a stile with folded hands staring straight
before her. At Olive's startled exclamation, she turned slowly,
and looked at her from between narrowed lids.</p>

<p>"Some one told me to-day that there is and always has been
some talk of 'your marrying Mr. Byrd," she began. Her voice was
harsh and threatening.</p>

<p>"There is no question whatever of my marrying any
one&mdash;now," Olive said tersely. "Don't agitate yourself
again&mdash;needlessly."</p>

<p>Mrs. Green's face worked. Then she continued with at least
outward calm. "In that case, I should agitate myself, as you call
it, and not needlessly. For I know something that I haven't told
the police, nor the Coroner, about the death of Anthony. But I
will tell it you now. I know that you met Anthony Thursday night,
the night that he&mdash;died."</p>

<p>"Never!" burst vehemently from Olive.</p>

<p>Mrs. Green looked as though she could have rent her limb from
limb. "He told me so himself. I met him driving into The Causeway
late that night. I wanted to get a sketch of the house by
moonlight, and had no idea he was anywhere near. He told me that
he had hurried home to see you about something tremendously
important&mdash;to you. And he was never seen alive again! I
don't claim to understand your motive. If I had, I should have
told the police my story at once. You never loved him,
never!"</p>

<p>"Told them what? That you were up, and at The Causeway the
night that he was shot?" Olive asked, and there was venom in her
tone too. "They <i>would</i> have been interested, Mrs. Green,
much more so than in the ridiculous story you are telling me. It
was not to my interest to shoot Anthony, whether I loved him or
not. I didn't as it happened. You're right there. But he loved
me. And that would be quite enough to make a revengeful woman who
wouldn't believe that he was not attracted to her, shoot him
rather than let him marry some one else. Or rather than let him
finish telling her what his real opinion of her was!"</p>

<p>Olive stopped. Mrs. Green looked as though she were fainting,
but jerking herself away from Olive's very perfunctorily
steadying hand she gave her a terrible look, and turned down the
lane beside them. For a long moment Olive hesitated. She looked
worried and undecided. Then with a very unmouselike set to her
jaw she walked on back to the rectory. She went no more to The
Causeway.</p>

<p>By the end of fifteen days it was shut up, with the butler in
charge as caretaker. Lady Revell still spoke occasionally of
offering it to Olive Hill, since Gilbert said that he would never
live in it himself, but nothing was done in the matter. As for
Lady Revell, she refused point-blank to go over it with the
solicitor.</p>

<p>One Saturday, a month after the inquest, Major Weir-Opie was
sitting in his comfortable bachelor quarters talking to Chief
Inspector Pointer of New Scotland Yard. A pleasant though very
reserved-looking man was the Chief Inspector, with something in
the gaze of the fine grey eyes that was unusually unemotional,
lucid, and resolute. It suggested a very well-balanced mind
behind it, and yet there was that about the mouth and chin that
spoke of a secret store of dynamic energy. It was a rather stern,
very grave face, but the eyes could twinkle, and the face could
change in the instant into a really merry one.</p>

<p>He had come down in person to make some inquiries about a
missing girl, and the deductions made by him from a couple of
seemingly idle facts as supplied by Superintendent Shilling had
just resulted in the swift finding of the damsel in question, and
her restoration to her family, much to her own indignation.
Pointer had but this moment had a telephone talk with the mother,
and blandly agreed with her that no matter what the doctors said,
darling Gertrude evidently had quite lost her memory as the
result of a recent attack of influenza.</p>

<p>"This finishes the job," Pointer said contentedly. But the
Chief Constable promptly asked him to stay on over the week-end
none the less, promising him some good trout fishing. Pointer
cheerfully agreed to borrow his host's fishing tackle and relaxed
in his arm-chair with the air of a man enjoying a slice of
unusual good luck.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I had better warn you, though, that I'm due to dine
at the rectory to-night," Weir-Opie said suddenly. "Shall you
mind coming too? The rector, Mr. Avery, is the most delightful of
hosts. I'll ask if I may bring you."</p>

<p>He picked up the telephone, and in a moment a warm invitation
was extended to Pointer. Weir-Opie hung up with an affectionate
smile, and then he and his guest talked shop for a solid
hour.</p>

<p>"And now about a spot of lunch, and then we'll have a try for
a fat old trout, whose continued existence is a disgrace to us
fishermen," suggested the Major. "It looks like rain," he added
gleefully.</p>

<p>They spent a wet but cheerful afternoon, which "the fat old
trout" enjoyed as much as they did, till finally, with some
younger members of his family whom the old gentleman, fanning
himself with his fins at the bottom of his favourite pool,
thought could very well be spared, Weir-Opie and Pointer
presented themselves at the rectory at eight punctually.</p>

<p>The dinner was a pleasant affair. Olive was not present, but
Mrs. Richard Avery was the gayest of hostesses. Her beauty shone
like a lamp lighting up the room and all in it. Grace Avery too
was a handsome addition to the board, if rather a quiet one. But
there was a cut to her mouth which made the Chief Inspector think
that when really roused, she could be as "alive" as her slender,
laughing sister-in-law.</p>

<p>The next morning, rather to the Major's surprise, Pointer
accompanied his host to church, where the Major went, as usual,
from a feeling of duty.</p>

<p>"I will say that for Byrd, he's made us join up our ranks.
He's a ruddy 'Red' who lives down here. Though, mind you, Mr.
Avery's a capital preacher," he said as they drove off.</p>

<p>The little church showed a mellow growth. A tablet to a
crusader, a Tudor window, Stuart carving, Hanoverian organ
pipes...The choir sang well. The congregation, far larger than it
would have been if any other than the rector himself was to
preach, followed valiantly.</p>

<p>Mr. Avery mounted the pulpit and gave out the text in his
clear resonant voice. "The third verse of the second chapter of
the First Book of Samuel.</p>

<p>"'Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogance come
out of your mouth: for the Lord is a God of knowledge, and by Him
actions are weighed.'" He opened his own pocket Bible at a place
marked by a folded paper, repeating again the second half of the
text, "'For the Lord is a God of knowledge, and by Him actions
are weighed.'"</p>

<p>Pointer was all interest. This sounded a verse after his own
heart. His mother was a crofter's daughter from the Hebrides, and
a good sermon delighted the Scotland Yard man. Mr. Avery had now
opened up the paper, he always jotted down the headings for his
sermon on a half-sheet of letter paper, and beginning "Our text
to-day&mdash;" suddenly stopped. His eyes were riveted on the
slip of paper. He bent forward, reading it with an attention that
seemed breathless. All colour left his face, he stretched out a
hand, not in rhetoric, but to catch hold of the pulpit edge.</p>

<p>Then he looked around and down at the puzzled attentive faces
and once more he repeated, "For the Lord is a God of knowledge,"
in a strange, awestruck whisper. He replaced the slip of paper,
folded up as before, in his own Bible and laid them both on one
side. Then, for a long minute, he stood in what was evidently
silent prayer. His hands which were clasped tightly in front of
him, trembled as Pointer saw.</p>

<p>Then only did he begin his sermon. Never had any of those
present heard a better. Pointer doubted if they ever could. It
was short, not quite ten minutes, but no one shifted an eye from
the speaker, no one noticed the time, until Mr. Avery, with a
deep sigh let his head fall a moment on his breast, and then
turned to the East. The sermon was finished.</p>

<p>"Well," the Major said as they left the church, "I was afraid
at first that Avery was unwell, but if that sermon is the result
of ill-health I'm afraid few of us who heard it will want him
well again. Magnificent!"</p>

<p>Pointer nodded in silence.</p>

<p>"And extempore," the Major continued getting into his car.
"Evidently some mix-up occurred, and he had come off with notes
that didn't fit the text. He looked very ill for a moment before
he got really started. I thought he was going to have to leave
the pulpit. He may have got a chill driving back from Sir Hubert
Witson's&mdash;I happened to meet him late last night just
leaving there&mdash;" Weir-Opie went on to talk of chills and his
own rheumatism.</p>

<p>There followed a silence. Apparently Pointer was not
interested in Avery, thought the Chief Constable, when the other
suddenly asked him:</p>

<p>"Have you had many cases sent up to the Assizes from here of
late? I don't seem to remember any."</p>

<p>"Not for months and months," agreed the Major.</p>

<p>"And the magistrates' bench?" Pointer rambled on, "any
difficult cases? I mean ones that seemed as though they weren't
quite as plain sailing as the accused made out?"</p>

<p>"No, nothing interesting. But there was a funny little affair
of a purser and his extra wife&mdash;" and the Major launched
himself into this story with gusto.</p>

<p>It was duly laughed over, and capped, and recapped, and then
Pointer asked whether lately there had been any mysterious
happenings or unsolved mysteries in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>"Mysterious? Unsolved? What, are you a psychic investigator?
No. Nothing whatever."</p>

<p>After dinner that evening, the two played chess. Very much to
Weir-Opie's surprise, for he had played with Pointer before, he
won the first game.</p>

<p>"Your mind wandering to the fair damsel you've sent home to
her parents?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I was thinking of the sermon this morning," Pointer said
truthfully. "Mr. Avery didn't preach to-night, or I'd have gone
to hear him make half his congregation uneasy again."</p>

<p>Weir-Opie grinned. "Fine effort. By the way, I phoned him up
this afternoon before we went fishing again to ask if he is all
right again. He said he was&mdash;quite. But he seemed in a great
hurry, and hung up before he had really finished. Very unusual. I
guessed he must have a bit of a throat coming on," and with that
the two settled down to another game of chess. Pointer finally
won it, for he gave his mind to it, deciding that the&mdash;to
him&mdash;significant affair in the pulpit was none of his
business.</p>

<p>Next morning Pointer was down to breakfast at eight. Weir-Opie
had to be off very early about a missing car, and the Chief
Inspector had to get up to town as soon as possible, and report
for duty.</p>

<p>The two talked of their fishing, and the Major was just
recounting how he had first missed Colonel Spots, the trout in
question, when the telephone rang. The Major still talking, still
with his mouth full of devilled kidneys, reached for it. As he
listened, the amused reminiscent look was wiped away as though by
a magic sponge, and his face grew rigid. His eyes told Pointer as
they lighted on him that what he heard concerned him too, but he
hung up before he turned to his guest.</p>

<p>"The rector's been found dead in his study about two minutes
ago. That was Dr. Rigby on the telephone. He lives almost next
door. A case of toadstool poisoning, he thinks. Care to dash
along with me? Unofficially? It's not likely to be anything but a
genuine accident. Avery hadn't an enemy in the world. Avery! Best
of parsons I Best man I ever met!"</p>

<p>A quick affirmative, and Pointer ran upstairs three steps at a
time for the small attach-case which he always had with him. The
Chief Constable sent word to his Superintendent to be at the
Rectory to meet him, then he hurried out to his car. Pointer
joined him, and the two were off at top speed.</p>

<p>"About the likelihood of its being a case of toadstool
poisoning," Weir-Opie began at once, "I must explain that. Some
months ago three children in the village died from eating what
they thought were mushrooms. The parents nearly went mad with
grief: The rector was with the children when they died, and
brooded on it a bit. Finally, he got the idea that it might be
possible to find out something which if cooked with the damned
things would make them harmless. We have a very clever chemist
called Ireton who believes he can do the trick. The rector
is&mdash;was&mdash;tremendously keen on it." The Major could not
immediately get used to speaking of John Avery in the past. "He's
financing it. As Ireton's a family man with half a dozen kids,
the toadstools are boiled down at the rectory, and Ireton fetches
the resulting extract in a bottle whenever he needs some fresh
stuff for his experiments. Here we are. There's Shilling on the
steps!"</p>

<p>A moment more, and the three stepped into a large sunny room
beside the front door.</p>

<p>There on a couch that ran across one corner from wall to wall,
lay the twisted, contorted figure of the rector. His face was
dreadful to look at, bearing as it did every sign of his having
died in torment. The doctor looked shaken as he straightened up
and nodded to the two newcomers.</p>

<p>"Been dead for some hours. About eight, at least, I should
guess. Just as I think I can guess what happened." His eyes
rested for a minute on a door facing the one by which the Chief
Constable and Pointer had entered. "People were saying only last
Saturday that Ireton had found what he was after&mdash;the
antidote, or rather the nullifying agent. I hope the rector
didn't believe this too implicitly, and try it on himself with
this result."</p>

<p>The three police officers, to include Pointer in a section
where he did not strictly belong, had moved away from the body to
a tray on a table by a window. On the tray was a plate with
remnants of cold beef and smears of dark brown liquid on it. A
bottle half full, marked as a well-known brand of mushroom
ketchup, stood beside the plate. There was, besides, some bread
and butter, what looked like the remains of some sort of a sweet,
and an empty quarter-bottle of a good Australian wine.</p>

<p>The doctor came over and looked down at it too. "That stuff on
the plate must be toadstool extract. See how it has blackened the
fork? That wouldn't be true of the ketchup. However, plate and
bottle will be analysed, of course. Not that it will bring Avery
back to life! He'll be terribly missed. Terribly And to have died
in such torment! I can't think why he didn't ring one of the
bells in here."</p>

<p>The Chief Constable went to the mantel and lightly touched
both. Two distinct rings could be heard.</p>

<p>"Now I must see to the housemaid who found him. She's had a
shock, poor girl! That face will give her nightmares for weeks!"
The doctor went on out.</p>

<p>Pointer stepped into a room that opened out of the study. The
library as he saw that it was. It had no other entrance or exit.
Going to the fireplace, he touched the bells there with his
gloved finger. Nothing happened.</p>

<p>"Don't they ring?" asked the Chief Constable who had followed
him in.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir, they ring all right," came the voice of Fraser
who had been summoned by the study bells.</p>

<p>Pointer pressed again.</p>

<p>"That's queer!" The butler was surprised. "They rang all right
yesterday afternoon. All the other bells are all right. Must have
these two seen to," and then his automatic, professional interest
dropped away, and he turned back to the other room and the body
of his master. Weir-Opie and Pointer followed him.</p>

<p>"What about the ladies? Are they up yet?" Weir-Opie asked.</p>

<p>To his relief he heard that the early morning cups of tea had
only just been brought them. Breakfast at the rectory was at
nine.</p>

<p>"Too bad that Mr. Richard Avery isn't back yet," murmured the
major. "But failing him, I ought to see Miss Avery first."</p>

<p>Fraser, a shortish man with an honest and conscientious face,
just now pale and tremulous-looking, only nodded.</p>

<p>"The rector! To think of him being gone!" he said, staring in
horror at the couch.</p>

<p>"I know!" Major Weir-Opie said sympathetically, "it's a
terrible business. But now tell me exactly how he was found."</p>

<p>"Margaret, the second housemaid, came in to open up the room
as usual, sir. I was outside having a look at the front door
varnish when I heard her scream. I rushed in to find she'd
fainted dead away&mdash;she had touched the rector, sir. Cold and
stiff and all screwed up as he is. I carried her out into the
lounge and telephoned for the doctor. He got here before I had
more than hung up. Then I took her downstairs to my pantry and
told cook and the maids to stay that side of the baize door. I
locked the door as well, in case&mdash;and I've just let the
doctor through&mdash;and locked it again."</p>

<p>"Quite right, Fraser," Weir-Opie said approvingly, "though the
ladies must be told shortly, of course."</p>

<p>"What was it, sir? He looks awful!" Weir-Opie and Shilling had
covered up the body on the sofa with a rug. "Maggie thinks it's
heart," the butler said "but I know that it's worse than that
from the questions the doctor asked me."</p>

<p>"Let it be thought to be heart at first," Major Weir-Opie
ordered, "it won't be such a shock to the ladies that way. But
between ourselves, the doctor thinks he may have eaten some of
those toadstools of his by mistake. Who brought in that tray
there?"</p>

<p>He learned that Fraser himself had. The rector, every now and
then, liked to work late at his writing, in which case he would
skip the regular dinner, and have a tray instead.</p>

<p>After he had brought in the tray Fraser had as usual on Sunday
gone off for a walk, got back by ten, and went to bed, after
locking up at eleven.</p>

<p>Had he looked in on the rector? asked Shilling. Fraser had
not. As usual, he had taken every care not to disturb him, for
the rector was writing in the library. He had closed the shutters
both in the library and the study when he brought in the tray. He
had opened them this morning after telephoning for the doctor. In
reply to a question of Pointer's he said that no bells had rung
after ten last night, or he could not have failed to hear them.
No, he would not have heard the rector calling, not if the study
door had been shut, but he would at once have heard the opening
of the door in question, as, unless done with the utmost caution,
it jarred the house, and he slept on the ground floor, at the
back of another wing.</p>

<p>"Were the lights on?" Shilling asked him.</p>

<p>"No, they had been turned off, or I should have noticed them
this morning, for the study door shows a ridge of light under it.
The rector must have turned them out so as not to dazzle his eyes
when he felt queer, and lay down on that sofa," the man
volunteered.</p>

<p>Fraser answered all the questions put to him very carefully
and helpfully. Pointer, for instance, learnt among other things
that the rector kept the library exclusively for religious
work&mdash;even to the talks in there, even to every book and
paper in the drawers of his writing-table. Worldly&mdash;in which
he included friendly&mdash;affairs were transacted in the study,
where he wrote all letters that came under that heading. Fraser
said that the dead man did not like him to come into the library
with a message, let alone with a tray. In short, the library was
really consecrated ground to the rector, a sort of chapel, but
one in which he wrote on religious subjects.</p>

<p>Weir-Opie's nod said he knew of this, but he let Fraser talk
on, to give Shilling time to think out his questions for the
servants' hall. Then he cut the butler short, and told him to
prepare the women servants.</p>

<p>"The Superintendent and I will come down to the hall now and
see the housemaid, and cook, and so on, and ask questions about
that tray. Remember, Fraser, that indigestion often leads to
heart attacks.</p>

<p>"Care to come with us?" Weir-Opie asked Pointer. The latter
said that he would prefer to stay where he was, and look about
him. "Much obliged if you will," said the Major, "for I don't
like to leave the body&mdash;though as things are, I'm sorry I
bothered you to come. Distressing sight, and nothing to be done.
By the way, before we have our talk to the servants, I'll show
you where that toadstool-stuff was brewed."</p>

<p>The Major and Shilling opened a door opposite to the one by
which they had entered the study. It led into what had evidently
once been a small fernery. But it now held a fitted basin, and a
small kitchen table on which stood a gas-ring, the gas turned
down to the merest sparks. On it was a covered red-enamelled
saucepan, half full of what looked like brown rags which gave out
an acrid smell even though the ventilators in the roof were wide
open. A funnel stood beside the saucepan, and four bottles which
had once held some sort of sauce, but on each of which a label
had been pasted showing a skull and cross-bones and the word
POISON in capitals. Around the neck of each a small bell, such as
is used for kittens, was fastened with a wire. Even in the dark
the bottles could not be mistaken for anything else. There was
further a small trowel, and garden fork, and a basket half filled
with repulsive toadstools beside which lay a thick pair of
gardening gloves. A door&mdash;locked&mdash;led down into the
garden by a couple of steps.</p>

<p>"And the rector always locked the one into his study when he
was out of the house, I know, for he told me so," Shilling added.
"Very careful always he was."</p>

<p>"And Ireton and he were the only persons to have a key to this
garden door." Major Weir-Opie looked with a shudder at the
toadstool basket. "That was so that Ireton could come in for
fresh material any time."</p>

<p>The Major wheeled as the door of the study opened. It was the
doctor. He came across to them.</p>

<p>"Those toadstools weren't worth the rector. Not by a million
miles. Nothing was worth losing him. You'll let the Coroner know,
of course. I've given the girl a sedative," and with that the
doctor hurried away&mdash;before Grace and Mrs. Richard Avery
would have to be told of the tragedy.</p>

<p>The Chief Constable and Shilling left the room for the
servants' quarters.</p>

<p>Pointer went back to the study. Standing in front of the
closed door into the lounge, he studied the room. Going round the
walls, clockwise, there was first a table with books on it, then
the couch on which the dead man lay. At his foot was the
fireplace with a wide marble mantelshelf on which stood a clock
in the middle, and a bunch of honesty in a white alabaster jar at
the end nearest to the couch. Then the wall continued with the
door into the library. Then, facing Pointer, was the east wall
with a big window in it and, where another window to match would
be expected, was the door into the little glass-roofed fernery
where now stood the apparatus for the toadstool broth. Then came
the south wall with two big windows in it, one of which was
beside the front doorsteps, and then the wall with the door where
Pointer was standing. Besides many easy-chairs, there was a table
by the east window, on which stood the tray brought in by the
butler. Apparently it was a table used for books and oddments.
Between the two south windows stood a kneehole writing-table,
like one in the library itself. It was tidy and seemed to be used
for occasional writing, Pointer fancied. There were several
bookshelves and a few more occasional tables. It was a cheery
room, with its light cream walls, parquet floor and green covers
and hangings. The library beyond was very like it, except that
Mr. Avery had completely covered its door into the lounge with
fitted bookshelves. So that there was only the one door into, or
out of, the two rooms. On its writing-table lay the small Bible
which the rector had taken into the pulpit yesterday morning. But
neither in it, nor beside it, was the folded half-sheet of paper
which had so disturbed him.

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER SIX</h2>

<p class="first">IN about a quarter of an hour Major Weir-Opie
stepped back into the study with a "Well, that's done. Nothing
fresh learnt. I've left Shilling taking it all down. Now there's
nothing to detain us after I've had a word with the
family&mdash;" He stopped and looked hard at Pointer.</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector, when on the hunt, was <i>a</i>
formidable-looking man. The swiftness of decision, strength of
will, and powers of endurance that were integral parts of him at
all times showed then.</p>

<p>"What have you found?" Weir-Opie asked sharply.</p>

<p>"For one thing, why those bells in the library didn't
ring."</p>

<p>Pointer led the way into the inner room, and stepping to the
fireplace again, still wearing the gloves that he had not pulled
off, unscrewed the bell-cover. He showed the puzzled Major a
scrap of paper inside, slipped in where it would break the
contact.</p>

<p>"This has the same," he unscrewed the bell on the other side
of the fireplace.</p>

<p>Weir-Opie looked puzzled. "Odd," he agreed. "Apparently the
rector didn't want them to ring&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's a sheet missing from yesterday's <i>Observer.</i> The
rest is lying by the waste-paper basket <i>in</i> the other
room," Pointer said quietly. "These two scraps are torn from the
missing front page. See these bits of the name? That means that
these bells weren't put out of action before yesterday morning at
the earliest."</p>

<p>Major Weir-Opie's face altered. It stiffened. He gave Pointer
a long steady look.</p>

<p>"You suggest that the rector's death wasn't an accident?" he
said slowly.</p>

<p>"Come back into the other room and look at what's recorded on
the door in there," was Pointer's reply.</p>

<p>The Major watched while Pointer puffed some fingerprint powder
over the panels. He took the little rubber puffer from his
attach-case to do so. For a moment the Major was puzzled at the
semicircular marks that came up first. These weren't prints of
fingers at all...Then he gave an exclamation under his breath. He
saw what they were. The marks of where a man had pounded on the
door with the sides of his clenched hands. One palm had a deep
cicatrix in it. The right hand. Just such a scar as showed on the
right hand of the dead man on the sofa.</p>

<p>Pointer was now busy around the doorknob. Fingerprints
innumerable showed there. Among them were long, dragging prints
as though hands had groped and missed, had fumbled, and fallen
away.</p>

<p>"His?" the Major asked with a backward sweep of his head
towards the couch.</p>

<p>"They are," was the reply. Pointer now was working on the
lower panels. He was puffing his powder almost at the ground
level. The Major looked inquiringly at him.</p>

<p>"Sunk to the ground," was the reply, "on his knees here,
groping for the handle and not able to get it. Then here, fallen
full length&mdash;still trying to open the door&mdash;which had
been locked on the outside, I'll swear."</p>

<p>The two looked at each other. Each tried to keep an official
mask of composure over his own private feelings, each face was
the face of a man who was seeing red.</p>

<p>"But the bells rang in here&mdash;" muttered the Major
thickly.</p>

<p>"I'm sure they didn't!" came from Pointer. "Only, in their
case, the murderer, male or female, single or plural, remembered
to take out the bits of paper that they had slipped in. Though,
even so, they screwed the covers on only half, and that half
crooked. They didn't remember the ones in the other room, the
room that hasn't been searched. Whatever they were after, they
knew, or felt certain, was in this room. For this room, sir, has
been hunted over until they had no time to tidy the cupboards
again, as I'll show you."</p>

<p>"But Avery! What on earth did he own that could be worth a
hunt, let alone a murder?" Weir-Opie asked the question half of
himself.</p>

<p>Pointer looked at his shoe-tips. He saw, not them, but a
man&mdash;John Avery&mdash;staring in horror at a folded slip of
paper that he had just taken from his Bible.</p>

<p>"Did they get away with whatever they were after?" the major
asked.</p>

<p>"I don't think so, sir," Pointer said promptly. "More and more
desperate, as the time passed, less and less careful. For
instance, the rector's pockets have all been searched."</p>

<p>Weir-Opie, who was no detective, looked his question.</p>

<p>"He isn't lying on anything&mdash;keys, money, papers
pocket-knife, note-book," Pointer explained. "All are free of the
body."</p>

<p>"Which wasn't the case when he dropped down on that couch,"
agreed Weir-Opie.</p>

<p>"Yet everything was replaced with the greatest care so as to
look natural, and, I fancy, into the pockets from which they
came. Time was taken to do it all very neatly. After his body,
the obvious places in the room where papers would be kept were
taken next. That bureau&mdash;this writing-table. With them, too,
everything was taken out, even to the lining paper of each
drawer, and put back again very much as it had been&mdash;only a
lot tidier. But when they got to those cupboards under the
windows,"&mdash;Pointer looked at the cupboards along the south,
the front wall of the room&mdash;"time was running short, and
more and more the contents were thrust back 'anyhow, in a
desperate hurry&mdash;but everything was taken out all the same,
to the last corner. Which is what makes me hope that they didn't
find what they wanted."</p>

<p>"I hope to God you're right, and that they slipped up on it!"
breathed the Major, and no prayer was ever more fervent.</p>

<p>Pointer now stood looking down at the writing-table. A
fountain-pen lay there poised on a spectacle-case.</p>

<p>"Anything here?" asked Weir-Opie hopefully.</p>

<p>"That's just the trouble, I fancy. Nothing is here now, but
that fountain-pen looks to me as though the rector had written
something, some accusation, some explanation, and left it here on
the table. When he was so ill&mdash;found himself locked
in&mdash;when no bell rang."</p>

<p>"Yes," Weir-Opie said at last, "certainly the rector would
keep his senses about him to the last, if any man could. But of
course if he did write anything down, it's been taken and
destroyed. Look here, Pointer, I shall insist on the Yard letting
you take on this job. You <i>must</i> take it on! Shilling's a
good fellow, but he's not a trained detective, or he'd have been
wasted here all these years."</p>

<p>Pointer said promptly what was so ardently expected of him, to
wit that, if it was turned over to him, he would certainly do his
best.</p>

<p>"And damned good that best is!" replied the Major, drawing a
deep breath of relief. "My hat, to think I saw nothing out of the
way here; that Shilling saw nothing out of the way! Any other
discoveries?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. But I can't properly search the room till the
fingerprints and photographs have been taken."</p>

<p>They stepped into the fernery. Pointer puffed some grey powder
over its door also Similar marks to those on the door into the
hall came up, but the upper ones were smudged and blurred.
Pointer examined them through his magnifying glass.</p>

<p>"Some are the light smears made by contact with the shoulders
of any of us just now, but these marks&mdash;I think Mr. Avery
tried hard to burst this door open with his shoulder after
pounding on it." Pointer looked slowly around him, and at the
floor. "I take it that the murderer&mdash;there may have been
more than one, and 'he' may have been 'she'&mdash;didn't dare
lock the door in between the study and this, for fear of the
rector noticing it, but relied on what I think happened, that he
wouldn't try this outer one and notice that the key was gone from
it, until too late, or even if he did notice it, would think that
the chemist, Mr. Ireton, had taken it by mistake. Mr. Avery hoped
to break it down and get out. I wonder why he didn't succeed."
Pointer opened the door, hardly touching the knob, though he had
his gloves on.</p>

<p>"Nothing like locking the stable door&mdash;" murmured the
Chief Constable. Both he and Shilling had used that knob several
times since they had come, and neither of them wore gloves.</p>

<p>Pointer stepped outside. Three shallow steps led down to the
gravel path, on the other side of which was a line of shrubbery
hiding the east wall of the garden. There was a small railing,
too, for a handhold in slippery weather. An ugly affair
originally, creepers twined around its close-set uprights had
turned it into a low and quite decorative green wall. But Pointer
was chiefly interested in the outer side of the door itself.</p>

<p>"See those marks, sir?" he pointed to two places, and then
looked down at the base of the creeper-clad railing. "And these
two places where the branches have been badly pinched? That door
was wedged with two planks of the kind gardeners use when working
on flower-beds, I fancy." He stepped down on to the gravel and
went round the nearest corner. There leaning against the side of
the house he found what he was looking for. Carrying the two
boards, he and Weir-Opie tried them. They fitted exactly. Pointer
initialled them and leant them against the railing.</p>

<p>"They can be taken away when the stretcher comes." The Chief
Inspector thought that that was the best chance of getting the
boards away without being noticed.</p>

<p>He closed the door again, he had scrutinised the floor of the
fernery before. There was some gravel on it, which the rector
himself might have brought in yesterday during the morning or
afternoon. Speaking literally, the planks were of course an
outside job, and obviously done after dark. That meant now, in
early June, about ten at the earliest.</p>

<p>Doris Avery waked from a profound sleep with the feeling that
a hand had touched her face. With a suppressed scream she sat up,
and peered around her room. No one was to be seen. A tea-tray
stood on the table beside her bed. The curtains were drawn back.
It was just past eight. It could not have been the maid. Then who
had been in the room? Why had some one been so close to her? She
was very drowsy, but she forced herself out of bed. After dipping
her face in cold water she was able to look about her carefully.
Her things were still folded up as neatly as when she had left
them, and Doris was exquisitely tidy, but they were not in the
order she liked to place them. Her keys lay on the dressing-table,
not exactly where she had left them. She unlocked a
Wellington in the window. Every single drawer, she thought, had
been searched, even to under the white lining paper. She dressed
quickly and went downstairs. The morning-room looked at sixes and
sevens. The breakfast table was but half-laid. She rang the bell
peremptorily. There was no such immediate answer as a ring in
that well-ordered house usually received. After a moment, as she
was about to ring again, Fraser came in. His face as composed as
he could make it.</p>

<p>"Madam, I've something dreadful to tell you," he began, going
across to her.</p>

<p>She interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Hampson's given notice? After having upset all the rest of
the staff," she suggested in a tone of worried conviction.</p>

<p>"It's the rector, ma'am," he said in a low voice.</p>

<p>"The rector!" she repeated in a tone of incredulity, "how can
it be the rector, Fraser? <i>He</i> never interferes in the
housekeeping&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop, madam!" he almost shouted at her.</p>

<p>"He's"&mdash;he choked&mdash;"had an accident&mdash;" he
finished wildly.</p>

<p>Within two seconds she got it out of him. Rushing to the study
she burst in.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! NO!" she caught sight of the covered body on the
couch and put her hand to her mouth as though to check a further
cry. "Was it in his sleep? Was it his heart?"</p>

<p>"Yes, heart failure," said Weir-Opie promptly. "As to seeing
his face, I wouldn't, Mrs. Avery," he counselled kindly. "He
evidently died in great agony. Evidently. The doctor wonders
whether it's possible that he made some mistake about that
toadstool extract of his."</p>

<p>She turned mutely and surveyed the table in the window with a
look of horror.</p>

<p>"I told him it was frightfully risky, but he was certain there
could be no danger since he was the only one to touch it. Is the
doctor still here? Is it certain?" she faltered, her hand half
outstretched towards the couch.</p>

<p>"Quite," said Weir-Opie sadly. "And I can't say how sorry I am
at this tragedy."</p>

<p>"And you think his heart may have been affected?" she asked
again.</p>

<p>"The doctor hasn't settled that for certain," the Major said
at once&mdash;and meaningly.</p>

<p>"Ah!" Doris went pale. You couldn't look at Doris's beautiful
crescent of a forehead without realising the logic that had
shaped it so smooth and so white. You could not look into her
ardent eyes without seeing that she had a character that could
withstand shocks. "Of course! The autopsy!" she murmured under
her breath. "And to-day of all days I overslept!"</p>

<p>A bell could be heard pealing through the house.</p>

<p>"Will you let me have a word with you in another room?"
Weir-Opie asked.</p>

<p>Shilling coming up at that moment stayed in the room.</p>

<p>Pointer caught sight of Fraser and spoke a word aside to him
in the lounge. As he did so, something made Pointer look up. He
saw a slender, dark-haired girl looking down on them.</p>

<p>Now yesterday in church Pointer's attention had been attracted
by the faces of three women in the congregation. All looked as
though the sermon to which they were listening held for them some
special and terrible meaning. This was one of the three.</p>

<p>He now guessed her, rightly, to be Olive Hill. Quite a pretty
little thing. Then he met her eyes. For a long second they stared
into his, and Pointer realised that there was will-power in those
eyes. Something in their depths suggested&mdash;to him&mdash;that
there was very little their owner would shrink from, once she had
made up her mind to attain a certain object or goal. There was a
hard kernel to this young woman. Cold, clever, hard.</p>

<p>Then she turned and, instead of coming on down, disappeared
with a noiselessness and a speed that spoke of muscles in good
training.</p>

<p>Pointer went into the room where Weir-Opie was asking Mrs.
Richard Avery about any visitors at the rectory yesterday
evening. He learnt that a young couple quite well known locally
had been in to dinner and stayed till about ten o'clock or
later.</p>

<p>No, the rector was not at dinner, he never was of a Sunday
night unless particular friends of his own were in the house. He
had had a tray sent in to his study. Had any of the visitors of
last night had a talk with him? No, they had not asked for him.
In the afternoon the rector had had some parish calls to make. On
his return he had been in his study all the time. Was that
unusual? It would have been, but for the fact that he was very
keen indeed on finishing his <i>Life of Saint Paul</i> as soon as
possible; it was very much overdue. She knew, they all knew, that
the church magazine in which it was being published had begged
him to let them have the next part as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The bell rang again. A deafening peal this time. Doris put her
hand to her head, a very unusual gesture with her, as Pointer
rightly guessed, and said she must now tell her sister-in-law the
dreadful news&mdash;"and there's Miss Hill, of course," she went
on. "And I must have a moment to myself to realise&mdash;to
grasp." Doris squared her shoulders quite unconsciously, with the
air of one girding herself up for a piece of work, unpleasant but
necessary, and therefore to be done promptly.</p>

<p>But before she left them Weir-Opie asked her when she had last
seen Mr. Avery. She said that she had stepped in after her
visitors had left to read him some bits out of a letter which she
had received from her husband. That was around a quarter-past
ten, but he had been deep in his writing, and after staying
perhaps a quarter of an hour helping him with some references
which he wanted looked up, she had gone on up to bed. Before
falling asleep&mdash;about an hour later&mdash;she had heard his
voice as though talking to some one in the study which was below
her bedroom.</p>

<p>Again the bell rang. She moved to the door. "I must let Miss
Avery know&mdash;" and this time she left the room.</p>

<p>The ambulance came a few minutes later. The stretcher was
swiftly carried into the rectory and as swiftly out again, this
time covered, and the ambulance drove off immediately with the
two planks inside as well. They were all glad to get that part
over without attracting notice. That horrible part&mdash;Weir-Opie
set his teeth as John Avery had to be virtually smuggled out
of the home which owed everything to him&mdash;to his great
heart, to his scholar's brain.</p>

<p>Pointer went in search of Fraser, and found him as requested
in his pantry with the door shut, fairly holding a tray in his
arms, a tray on which stood a silver coffee-pot, a milk jug,
demerara and white crystal sugar, and some half-dozen used
coffee-cups of different colours and patterns.</p>

<p>"Not washed yet? Good!" Pointer felt relieved.</p>

<p>"The rector didn't use these, sir," explained Fraser
needlessly, "he didn't have any coffee last night. When I took in
the supper tray he said as he wouldn't be wanting it."</p>

<p>"Even if the rector didn't drink any of this, I think the
Major would like it saved," Pointer said, and taking a cardboard
box large enough to hold it all, set the tray inside, and corded
it, carrying it himself into the study and writing on it that the
cups were to be especially analysed for any narcotic.</p>

<p>As he passed through the lounge he met Olive Hill full on.
Pointer could have sworn that she knew what he was carrying so
carefully, more, that she knew why he was carrying it&mdash;to
find out if any coffee had been drugged last night. She had
speaking eyes, had Miss Hill.</p>

<p>In the study he found Shilling, who was listening to what the
Major had to tell him.</p>

<p>"Of course, it's unofficial yet," Weir-Opie was saying, "but I
think we can take it that the Yard will let Pointer carry on what
he has begun so well&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Begun so well!" Shilling gave Pointer a congratulatory look.
"Though I don't say that we would have taken the death of the
rector lying down. I felt something was wrong, but I couldn't
light on what. To have let him die in here like a dog! But what's
to be done first, sir? Mr. Madden, of Madden and Weybridge,
claims that their shop was broken into last night and then fired.
Arson, they report. Now shall I send Inspector Green&mdash;?"</p>

<p>The two were lost for a moment in names and numbers.</p>

<p>"You'd better go yourself, Shilling," was the final
recommendation. "Send up a couple of men here, one of them Tracy.
Tell him to bring his fingerprint powder, we'll wait for him.
Who's to analyse this stuff on the plate? Ireton, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Send it with the other things to be tested to Hendon,"
Pointer said promptly. "One swab to Mr. Ireton, if you think he's
safe, but not more."</p>

<p>"Ireton had nothing to do with any hanky-panky that's gone on
here," Weir-Opie said firmly, "he thought the rector a saint from
heaven. But have it as you think best, by all means."</p>

<p>A few minutes later first one policeman and then another, and
then another, slipped unobtrusively into the rectory. One was to
stay on duty in the study itself. One was the photographer and
one the local fingerprint expert.</p>

<p>"Now that's all well under way," Weir-Opie went on, "suppose
you and I go back to my house for breakfast. I can't get into
touch with the Yard yet, but I probably can before that's
finished. I must just look in on Madden with Shilling
here&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pointer wanted a word with the gardeners. He found that there
was only one, a youngish man with a careworn honest face, of the
name Higgins. After expressing his sorrow at the dreadful news
about the rector, and his opinion that you couldn't be too
careful with a weak heart, he let Pointer lead the talk to the
planks. Evidently they had been standing where the Chief
Inspector found them, on and off for the best part of a week, as
Higgins had been setting out some Canterbury bells to fill up a
few unexpected gaps in the borders.</p>

<p>Pointer asked Higgins where he lived, and learnt that it was
in the village; that being so, for the moment he was of no
further interest to Pointer, for Higgins said he had not been
near the rectory since he stopped work on Saturday till he came
this morning at nine.</p>

<p>Shilling was to investigate the whereabouts of the rectory
servants last night, and look into their characters. The
superintendent had said that he was sure that the latter would
all prove to be of the best if they had been engaged since Mrs.
Richard Avery had taken over the reins, a matter of four years
now, for she had promptly put an end to the rector's way of
helping down-and-outs to start afresh.</p>

<p>Pointer had finished at the rectory for the moment, until he
had a regular position in the inquiry, and until the doctors were
absolutely and officially certain of the cause of the rector's
death. He walked on now to the Chief Constable's house, and as he
strode along, lithe and erect, he thought over the case as a
whole. Taking the doctor's certainty as justified that the rector
had been poisoned, then he wondered if a clue to the crime might
not lie concealed in the sermon that he had heard yesterday
morning.</p>

<p>Mr. Avery had preached to Pointer's ears not so much a sermon
as an exordium to some member or members of the congregation to
realise that no deception would avail them at the last, that they
might have hoodwinked men but not their own souls. It went much
further than that, it seemed to Pointer to be a pleading to some
one not to mind the judgments of men, but to come forward at
once, to speak out now. And the night after preaching that sermon
the preacher was dead&mdash;poisoned. Shut away in a locked
study, where no bell would ring, where no cry of his had brought
help.</p>

<p>Pointer thought it very likely that Mrs. Richard Avery, who
had her rooms over the study and the library, had had her coffee
drugged, so as to ensure her sleeping through any sounds from
below; the height of the rooms on the ground floor of the rectory
would also have helped to deaden the rector's moans, but as she
had recognised his voice she might otherwise have heard them.</p>

<p>And that folded paper that had, Pointer believed, caused the
sermon to take that particular course, was possibly, he thought,
the object that had been hunted for so desperately, and
apparently so fruitlessly. That folded paper!...Avery's almost
perfunctory glance at it had changed to a look which Pointer had
thought, even then, to be one of sheer horror. But if that folded
paper stood for the centre of this puzzle, then it looked as
though, even so, Mr. Avery had not quite grasped its character,
nor the character of the persons whom he had tried to reach in
his sermon.</p>

<p>The rector, Pointer thought, had had in his mind some one who
had kept silence&mdash;who had concealed&mdash;who had lied
possibly, but Mr. Avery had not realised that the paper which he
had seen was not so much a link as a proof. But if he, Pointer,
was right in his ideas, then whoever it was at whom the sermon
was especially directed had known better, had known at once that
both that paper, and the rector because he had seen it, must
cease to exist.</p>

<p>Pointer roused himself from his deep reverie as to what that
paper could have been...Some crime committed in the past for
which the wrong person had been punished?...Or some unguessed
crime?...</p>

<p>He was on the steps of the Chief Constable's house.</p>

<p>He shook himself, and rang the bell.

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7"></a>CHAPTER SEVEN</h2>

<p class="first">THE breakfast was a silent meal. Weir-Opie was
beginning to feel the shock of his old friend's death as a
personal, not merely as a professional matter.</p>

<p>Pointer was secretly amused when, half-way through, who should
be shown in but Superintendent Shilling.</p>

<p>"I've left Inspector Green to carry on, sir," he said with
defensive speed as he came towards the table. "Uncommonly good is
Green. Deserves a chance to work a thing out on his own!"</p>

<p>Weir-Opie looked at him in silence for a minute, then with a
twinkle in his eye, he invited him to join them, and as Shilling
had had but the merest sketch of a breakfast, he was only too
glad to shove his long legs under the board.</p>

<p>"Do you think this affair at the rectory was an inside affair,
Pointer?" asked Shilling.</p>

<p>Pointer thought that it was impossible to say so
far&mdash;with that door into the garden. The rector might have
given some one an invitation to come in by it and see him last
night.</p>

<p>"There was no second tray, so, if so, it would be some one the
rector wouldn't expect to have eat with him?" queried Weir-Opie.</p>

<p>Pointer thought one could not tell. It might be a member of
his own household who had already dined, or it might be a friend
of whom the same was true.</p>

<p>"Now as to the women at the rectory, what did you think of
them?" asked the Chief Constable with interest.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Richard Avery seemed a radiantly happy woman, and that
is not the description of a murderess as a rule. Miss
Avery&mdash;I took her to be a woman hard to stir but capable of
being as selfish and as energetic, when really roused, as her
sister-in-law, which I fancy is saying a good deal. Who is Mr.
Richard Avery, by the way, sir?"</p>

<p>"He's an Assistant Commissioner in Nigeria who's just struck
something lucky, left the service, and is coming home to live.
Mrs. Richard is in the seventh heaven as you noticed, at the idea
of his joining her so soon. Nice chap Richard, rather like the
rector."</p>

<p>"What did you think of Miss Hill?" asked Shilling with
interest. "Or haven't you come across her yet?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;from a distance. I thought her very keen on seeing
all there was to see this morning," Pointer said. He did not add
that he had a strong impression of some purpose, some very
absorbing purpose in her; and Shilling, who had been about to
tell him of the tragic end to the man to whom she had been
engaged, forgot to pass on that piece of information as his eyes
followed the Chief Inspector's stare at Weir-Opie's
mantelshelf.</p>

<p>"I wonder if anything stood there," Pointer said quickly. "I
meant to ask before. In the rectory study," he explained, "there
are only two things on the mantelshelf. The clock in the middle,
and on the left-hand end, a white jar of honesty. Did anything
usually stand on the right-hand end?"</p>

<p>Weir-Opie thought back. "Yes. Bright orange tobacco jar.
Empty. I tried to dip into it once, and the rector said it had
too clumsy a lid for everyday use, but he liked the colour and
shape. The study tobacco jar&mdash;a wooden barrel&mdash;stands
on his writing-table."</p>

<p>Pointer remembered it.</p>

<p>"Then where's the orange jar?" he asked. "I didn't see it in
either room.</p>

<p>"It had no real value," Weir-Opie said. "I take it it's been
put somewhere else."</p>

<p>He stopped at that, for just then the telephone bell for which
they were all waiting rang. The Major had asked the Yard to let
him know as soon as the Assistant Commissioner should have
arrived. A brisk conversation now took place over the wire.
Weir-Opie found it none too easy to get his way, but in the end the
Assistant Commissioner promised him the loan of the Chief
Inspector, provided the latter could make time to come up for a
couple of important meetings due this week. Pointer then received
his orders over the telephone which would be confirmed later. He
was to stay down, officially to advise the local police, but in
reality to take the real, if not nominal, command of the
case.</p>

<p>The little party broke up. Weir-Opie himself had to drive off
to a neighbouring town, as well as drop in for a word with
Inspector Green, and for the moment Shilling had to accompany
him, however much the superintendent pleaded that it was only
fair to Green to leave him an absolutely free hand.</p>

<p>"What will be the first thing you do on returning to the
rectory?" asked Shilling, as Pointer stood up ready to go.</p>

<p>"Question the butler more closely about the tray, about
yesterday's visitors, and find out if anything fresh has been
shown by the photographing of the fingerprints."</p>

<p>"What! Before you look for the missing tobacco jar?" chaffed
Weir-Opie. Then he looked keenly at the other. "I believe you've
got some sort of an idea in the back of your mind," he said at
once. "I mean, about the rector's death. You have an idea what
papers the murderers were looking for in his study."</p>

<p>"I have just an idea," Pointer agreed.</p>

<p>"But what papers could the rector have that were of any
interest to any one but himself?" Shilling asked of the world in
general.</p>

<p>"Were you at morning service yesterday?" was Pointer's counter
query.</p>

<p>The superintendent shook his head. "My wife went. Never misses
the rector's sermon, she doesn't," he said proudly.</p>

<p>"Did she say anything about the sermon?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>Shilling considered. He was a young man for his post, with a
fine crop of red hair, keen blue eyes, and a tight-lipped mouth.
He might be lacking in imagination, but he would have great
driving power, and looked as keen as mustard.</p>

<p>"You mean about the rector's having brought the wrong notes
for it?" he said shrewdly. "Yes, she said he seemed to get a
fearful jolt when he opened his slip of paper and evidently found
he'd brought one that didn't fit his text, but she said he went
on from memory and did better than ever. She came home quite full
of it. As to the mistake, he was short-sighted, and without his
reading glasses couldn't tell any one paper from any other."</p>

<p>Shilling broke off to stare at Pointer, as his superior was
doing.</p>

<p>"But surely you don't think the murderer was after the
original notes!" came in a tone of stupefaction from the Chief
Constable.</p>

<p>"Notes for a sermon?" Shilling echoed his tone. "The rector
was a wonderfully learned man, we all know that, but surely a
sermon can't be valuable!"</p>

<p>Pointer was amused at the way in which both had gone off the
rails.</p>

<p>"I don't think they were after notes for any sermon," he
explained, "but I think it's just possible, barely possible, that
they were after that folded slip of paper which the rector had
thrust into his Bible in mistake for his notes, and which was
something quite different, as he knew the moment his eyes fell on
it in the pulpit. I thought at the time that its contents stunned
him."</p>

<p>"Gosh!" was Shilling's contribution to the argument.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" came in a breathless whisper from the Chief
Constable. "When you said last night that you were thinking about
his sermon did you expect this?"</p>

<p>"Not murder, no, sir," was the instant and truthful reply.
"But I thought it suggested some trouble in the place. I thought
that that folded slip of paper had been picked up by him, or
handed him by some mistake, and that it referred to, or meant,
something shady coming off in the future, or threw some light on
something in the past."</p>

<p>"And you think the rector's death&mdash;?" Weir-Opie was
groping his way.</p>

<p>"Looks to me, sir, as though the rector may have been mistaken
in thinking that whoever it was only needed a little bracing up
to speak out. That would suggest that the whole affair was much
more serious than the rector guessed. And that the person
concerned, or persons, knew that he or she couldn't come forward,
and also realised that if that paper were to be shown to some one
else, or passed on, his or her fate would be sealed.
Irrevocably."</p>

<p>"And pass it on the rector would have," muttered Weir-Opie,
"if it was the right thing to do. Nothing could have turned him
from his duty. There was steel under all his kindness. Finest
character I ever came across, or ever shall." Then the Chief
Constable heard a clock striking somewhere and grasped Shilling
as though he were a straw about to be swept out of reach by his
interest in what Pointer was saying. "Later, Shilling, later!"
commanded his superior, but in a tone that suggested there would
be a hereafter for himself too, and with a wave to Pointer they
jumped into a waiting car and were off.</p>

<p>At the rectory, Pointer found that the ladies were upstairs in
their own rooms, but on the ground floor Tracy, the local
fingerprint expert, was just finishing his work. He was looking
at a tumbler on the tray which had held water and was quite
empty.</p>

<p>"They're his, sir. Pretty well the last he made, I fancy. The
glass was slipping from his grasp as he set it down. Poor Mr.
Avery!" Tracy's voice shook a little. "Very different prints from
those on the dessert knife, sir," he hurried on, "there the grip
was firm, however many times he handled it. But this
tumbler&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pointer too saw the loose streaks half around the sides of the
glass that showed where it had almost fallen out of the fingers
so loosely holding it.</p>

<p>As for the bottle on the tray marked "Mushroom Ketchup" which
they thought had last night held pure toadstool extract for a
time, the marks were very smudged, but many of them were
undoubtedly Mr. Avery's. The same was true of the bottle in the
fernery from which in all probability it had been filled, one of
the bottles with bells on it, a bottle marked POISON which was
almost empty.</p>

<p>"Tremendous number of prints on that," Tracy said, following
Pointer's eyes. "But the last were Mr. Avery's, though very
smudged. Very smudged indeed.'</p>

<p>"By another hand which was wearing a glove?" Pointer asked
meaningly.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Tracy, "that's just it, sir, isn't it!" Which
apparently meaningless string of words was received with an
emphatic nod. After which Pointer had him cover the inside of the
door with sheets of paper. The photographs might not be as Clear
as the real prints of Mr. Avery's hands. Then the Chief Inspector
allowed himself a free hand in examining the room, or rather
rooms, for he went first into the inner room, the library, where
Tracy had found only Mr. Avery's fingerprints and those of
Fraser. On the writing-table was a manuscript page half-filled by
the beautiful handwriting which Pointer by now knew as Mr.
Avery's. The last sentence of all was one in which the writer
deplored the lack of space which would not let him linger over
that most difficult phrase to translate, "Through a glass
darkly"&mdash;</p>

<p>He turned away. Yes, Mr. Avery had apparently seen things
through a glass darkly. If he had seen clearer...</p>

<p>Pointer looked around him. He had never been in a room which
so suggested peace and freedom from the friction of daily life.
He went over it inch by inch, then he stepped back into the
study, and did the same there, beginning with the couch. When he
came to the books, he felt sure that they had been searched
already, by the same hands probably that had turned over the
papers in the writing-table drawers and cupboards. Suddenly he
stooped. He was beside the east window, the one near the door
into the library. From a novel lying on its side he lifted up a
stamp. It was Italian, very faded and thin, and apparently quite
old. He and Tracy hunted for others but found none.</p>

<p>He passed on to the window seat beside it. Lifting the frill
he saw something lying like a glittering snake. It was a necklace
of oxidised silver with hand-cut beads of crystal. Fastened, it
would hang down to the waist of the wearer. The catch itself
opened easily, he saw, and was not strong enough for anything so
heavy as this necklace. Two of the links were sharply bent almost
at right angles.</p>

<p>He now helped Tracy to pack up the "exhibits," not including
the necklace, as such things should be packed. Nothing amused
Pointer, and incidentally Tracy, more than the light-hearted way
in which amateur detectives in books stowed away, in pocket or
bag, articles with fingerprints on them. These ones were each
wrapped in special paper, slung in special rubber slings and
carried as though the cases contained bombs.</p>

<p>Tracy finally got into a police-car, and the various boxes
were stacked around him. He was going straight to Hendon with
them. Just then, a short, pleasant-faced, middle-aged man came up
the drive. He hurried up to Tracy. People were saying that the
rector had died in his sleep&mdash;heart failure&mdash;was there
any truth in the dreadful rumour? he asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>"It's quite true, Mr. Ireton," Tracy said, and then introduced
him to Pointer.</p>

<p>Ireton was quite overcome, now that the report was confirmed.
Pointer could get little from him at the moment, but that little
bore out what he had heard about the way in which the chemist
obtained fresh supplies of the boiled-down toadstool brew. Mr.
Ireton had been in only yesterday afternoon around three o'clock
for some. He had filled a small bottle which he brought, and had
left the bottle in the "fernery" as he still called it, half
full. The bottle was undone for him to see, and he stared at
it.</p>

<p>"Have you spilled some out, or what?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We're wondering whether he took some to try, trusting too
much to your having found an antidote or whatever you call it,"
Major Weir-Opie said from the rear. He and Shilling had just got
back.</p>

<p>As Ireton stared in horror, the Major continued:</p>

<p>"It's said that you told the rector you had found something
which would cancel out the poison in the toadstools, if cooked
with them."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> say such a thing? Never! I'm on the way&mdash;yes.
But I haven't got there yet&mdash;not yet! You see it's a new
line, quite different from Pasteur's antiphallinic serum which
they use in France."</p>

<p>"Could the rector have misunderstood you?"</p>

<p>"Impossible!" Ireton poured forth a flood of details showing
how impossible it would have been for Mr. Avery, informed of
every step in the search, to have jumped to any such error.</p>

<p>Pointer asked if Mr. Avery was ever absent-minded in handling
the stuff.</p>

<p>Ireton said the rector was exceedingly careful. He looked
quite overcome at the turn the questions were taking. How could
there be any idea that the toadstools were responsible for Mr.
Avery's death, he asked, with tears on his cheeks which he was
too agitated to wipe away.</p>

<p>Weir-Opie reminded him that until the autopsy brought more
definite knowledge, every question that could clear up such a
death had to be at least talked over.</p>

<p>They let him open the side door and go in as usual. Nothing in
the little room was altered, he said, except for the absence of
the bottle that Tracy had with him.</p>

<p>"Did you go into the study at all yesterday afternoon?"
Pointer asked.</p>

<p>No, Ireton said that he had not. He had walked up the drive
with Byrd about three o'clock. He had overtaken him by the gate.
Byrd had gone on to the front door. He thought that he heard his
voice later on in the study, but he had only stayed in the little
fernery long enough to fill his bottle. He could not say if the
door between had been locked or not. That would depend on whether
the rector was in. He always locked the door and took the key if
he were going out.</p>

<p>With that Ireton was allowed to go home. He looked quite ill.
As well he might. As far as opportunity went, he was in the first
rank of suspects.</p>

<p>The three returned to the study and rang for the butler.</p>

<p>"When did Mr. Byrd call yesterday?" Pointer asked him.</p>

<p>"Around three, sir. Just after Mr. Gartside and his
sister."</p>

<p>"Gartside!" echoed the Chief Constable, and Pointer noticed
that Shilling wheeled about as though he too were particularly
interested in that name.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, Mr. Gartside and his sister both called to see the
master yesterday afternoon. I showed them in here first, then Mr.
Byrd.</p>

<p>"But the rector had a call to make which kept him out all
afternoon."</p>

<p>"Mr. Byrd knows the Gartsides, doesn't he?" Shilling
asked.</p>

<p>Fraser said that the three had shaken hands and chatted as
though they did.</p>

<p>"He climbed once for a week with Revell and them," Weir-Opie
said, "two years ago."</p>

<p>Fraser went on to say that the three visitors had left
together, after waiting only a very few minutes.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gartside and his sister are staying at Hamble's farm,"
the butler added. "I heard them say as much as they went out.
Come down here to see about something that Mr. Revell had left
them in his will&mdash;like the car he left the master, which the
rector only got on Saturday, and only drove it Saturday evening,
and now won't want ever any more!" At this point emotion overcame
Fraser.</p>

<p>Pointer gave him a moment in which to recover himself, then he
asked for a list of all the people who had visited the rectory
yesterday. Fraser said that, apart from Mrs. Richard's friends
who had come in to dinner, and stayed until a little after
ten&mdash;he had been back when they left&mdash;there were only
the three visitors of the afternoon, and Lady Revell, who came
about nine. She had telephoned in the afternoon asking if she
could have a word with the rector, who, when at last he had got
home about six, had told Fraser to ring her up and ask her if
nine o'clock would be too late. Lady Revell had said that nine
would suit her perfectly. She had not yet arrived when Fraser had
brought in the tray, as he had reminded Mr. Avery, who said that
he was on no account to wait in for her or hurry back, as he
would be on the lookout for her himself. Fraser did not know when
she had left, but she must have been gone by ten, as he did not
hear the front door open after he shut it on Mrs. Richard's
friends.</p>

<p>For the moment, Pointer asked no further questions about the
standing of the visitors. Instead he inquired as to what had
happened to whatever it was that stood on the end of the
mantelshelf nearest to the window.</p>

<p>Fraser looked at the mantel and then round the room. "The
orange tobacco jar with the stamps in it?" he spoke as though
greatly puzzled. "The rector must have taken it into the library,
though I never knew him to do that before..." They went through
into the inner room, but the jar for which they were looking was
not to be seen, as Pointer knew.</p>

<p>"The rector liked a wooden one for tobacco," explained Fraser,
"but he used to drop any stamps he got into the china one, till
he had time to put them in his albums."</p>

<p>"Did he collect stamps?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"Not himself, sir, but he had lots of boys at his dubs who
did. I'll see if I can find the jar."</p>

<p>"Don't worry any one with questions about it," Pointer said,
"use your eyes, but don't ask about it. Some people might think
it heartless, under the circumstances."</p>

<p>"Leave it to me, sir," Fraser said promptly, and vanished.</p>

<p>Weir-Opie looked puzzled. Pointer showed him the stamp that he
had found, and where he had picked it up. Weir-Opie and Shilling
looked still more puzzled.</p>

<p>As for the necklace, the Chief Constable felt pretty sure that
he had seen Lady Revell with just such a thing hanging round her
neck when he had dropped in a week or so ago. "Lady Revell," he
began, but stopped as Fraser came back to say that he had looked
everywhere for the jar without seeing it, and adding that he knew
it had been in its customary place last night, as he had all but
knocked it off with the end of his tray.</p>

<p>"What stamps were kept in it, do you know at all?" asked the
Major.</p>

<p>"Some Mr. Revell left for the master the very last time I ever
saw Mr. Revell, sir," the butler said solemnly. "Some people
would say ill-luck went with that gift, wouldn't they?"</p>

<p>"Revell?" the Major repeated curiously, and Pointer noticed
the quick intake of Shilling's breath beside him. "When was that?
And how did Mr. Revell come to be interested in stamps? I never
heard he was a collector."</p>

<p>"He wasn't, sir. I happened to be waiting at table when he
first spoke about the stamps. That was the day before he went off
for that climbing holiday of his. He dined here. You remember at
the inquest that was spoken of, sir?"</p>

<p>Weir-Opie nodded.</p>

<p>At the inquest Pointer's gaze flicked to Shilling's face. It
was very rigid. The Chief Constable, too, was sitting far forward
on his chair.</p>

<p>"Quite. But where did the stamps come in?" asked Weir-Opie.</p>

<p>"Mr. Revell, sir, said he had come across some old letters of
his great-grandfather. Written while on a tour of all the places
that Garry"&mdash;Fraser hesitated&mdash;"Garry Baldy, I thought
he said, had been to."</p>

<p>Shilling looked puzzled, so did the Major for a second, then
he nodded understanding. "Revell's great-grandmother was a
Trevelyan, I remember. Distant kinswoman of an aunt of mine. She
would be interested in anything to do with Garibaldi."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," relieved that the name seemed to be accepted
without more ado, Fraser went on, "Mr. Revell asked the rector if
he would like the stamps off the envelopes. He said that there
were only about twenty and probably of no value. The rector
thanked him, and said he would be very glad to have them, if Mr.
Anthony didn't want to keep them himself. And after Mr. Revell
had left he drove up again, on his way to town that was, and
handed me an envelope for the rector, saying that he wouldn't
come in again, but there were some stamps inside, would I hand it
to Mr. Avery in the morning. Mr. Avery was still up, as it
happened, so I took them in to him at once. He was reading the
newspaper in that arm-chair there, sir." Fraser indicated the
one. "He opened the envelope, said that Mr. Revell had been kind
enough to make out a list, and dropped the lot into the jar on
the mantel. It was empty then."</p>

<p>"I wonder if they were of any value after all," the Chief
Constable said in a casual tone.</p>

<p>"No, sir," was the prompt reply. "None whatever. Mr. Byrd was
in only a few days afterwards about some tithes protests which he
is backing, and the rector, who never bore no one any malice, had
tea brought in, and was showing Mr. Byrd the stamps as I came in
with the tray.</p>

<p>"N.G. all of them,' Mr. Byrd said, hardly looking at them.
That's Mr. Byrd's way, that is. But he knows about stamps all
right. He's a fine collection, he has, nearly as good as Sir
Hubert's, some say it is."</p>

<p>"What did the rector reply?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he didn't mind one way or another. He had only shown the
stamps so as to be polite. Same like ordering tea. Mr. Byrd
didn't take any interest in either of 'em. Pearls before swine
was the rector's politeness to Mr. Byrd."</p>

<p>"What sort of paper was the list written on?" Pointer asked,
"did you notice?"</p>

<p>"Fraser said that he had, for a very good reason. Mr. Avery
used a special linen letter-paper of a peculiar off-grey colour.
The list was made out on the same paper. Mr. Revell had evidently
torn off the back page of a letter from the rector and used that,
as his things were more or less locked up by Monday night."</p>

<p>"Same paper in fact as the rector makes out his sermon notes
on?" Pointer asked, as though trying to get the item clear.</p>

<p>"That's right, sir."</p>

<p>Pointer showed him the necklace that he had found in the room
when searching it just now.</p>

<p>Fraser recognised it instantly as belonging to Lady Revell.
"She must have worn it when she came to see the rector last
night, and it evidently dropped off, as it did the night she wore
it to dinner here&mdash;just dining with the rector and the
ladies. It dropped off then. She said as how the catch was weak
and she would have it seen to." And with that the bell rang, and
Fraser had to go.

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8"></a>CHAPTER EIGHT</h2>

<p class="first">"AND who was Revell and why was there an inquest
on him?" Pointer asked as the door closed on the butler.</p>

<p>The Major tossed a cigarette away. He glanced at
Superintendent Shilling.</p>

<p>"I don't mind owning it's queer," he said in the tone of a man
saying something very handsome. "Stamps, eh? I don't believe
objects can bring bad luck."</p>

<p>"But they do bring criminals after them&mdash;if they're
valuable," finished Shilling, his eyes very bright.</p>

<p>The Major pulled out his watch and said he would have time to
give Pointer a brief summary.</p>

<p>"It's quickly told. Anthony Revell was a young man who lived
at a house, not far from here, called The Causeway. His
grandfather's house it had been. The Lady Revell we spoke of is
his mother. His father, a K.C.B., is dead. Anthony was at Eton
and Cambridge. Handsome as a film star. No end run after by
women. Lady Witson for one. She's the wife of the man&mdash;Sir
Hubert Witson&mdash;whom the rector had been calling on when I
last saw him alive&mdash;Saturday evening. At one time it was
supposed that Anthony was going to marry Miss Avery. She has a
thousand a year of her own, and expectations of more still when
the rector should die, and she's a handsome enough woman, though
older than Revell. Then instead of Miss Avery we hear that it's
definitely to be Miss Hill, Miss Avery's companion, and that it's
to be announced as soon as Revell comes back from a fortnight's
climbing holiday in Derbyshire, which for years he has always
taken with a brother and sister called Gartside. Then three days
after he starts on his fortnight's holiday, Anthony is found dead
in his own drawing-room at The Causeway. Shot through the right
ear. His revolver on the floor by his foot, a cleaning rag on the
table, a box of cartridges beside the rag. The revolver had been
fully loaded, only one bullet had been fired, and that was dug
out of the depths of his head at the autopsy. Now there had been
a good many cases of thefts from houses around. It was thought
that Revell, coming back for some reason or
other&mdash;toothache, said the Gartsides&mdash;heard some
suspicious sound, or saw some suspicious person loitering about,
got the revolver ready, and while doing so caught the trigger in
the cleaning cloth. He was quite unaccustomed to revolvers, so
said the gunsmith from whom he had bought it in case of burglars.
But Shilling always has believed that there was more in it than
that&mdash;though what, he couldn't say. Gartside had a note from
Revell to show at the inquest&mdash;all quite simple and
clear&mdash;raging toothache&mdash;be away for two days and back
on the third. Plans for the climb on the third. And the dentist's
secretary&mdash;" The Major ran over the case. "There was some
talk of giving the house to Miss Hill, but apparently that was
only talk," he added.</p>

<p>"And who inherited Mr. Revell's money and estate?" Pointer
asked.</p>

<p>His brother Gilbert, bar a life-interest for Lady Revell.
"Nice boy, Gilbert," added Weir-Opie. "Oddly enough he was by way
of being a friend or disciple of Byrd's, our local communist. But
that's sure to be off now&mdash;naturally! Nice woman, Lady
Revell, too, though she never tried to hide her preference for
her younger son as she should have done. Now, mind you, Pointer,
don't be misled by the way that Revell died, though Shilling here
didn't like it."</p>

<p>"Well, no, sir, I can't say as I was over pleased about that
affair," Shilling said quaintly. "Couldn't <i>prove</i> anything
though. Nothing whatever to go on. Nothing!"</p>

<p>"Ah, but that was only because you wanted something to get
your teeth into," said Weir-Opie. "The feeling you had, Shilling,
was that here was a fine chance for a murder inquiry all lost in
the dead end of an accident."</p>

<p>"And what about these missing stamps, sir? Don't they link the
two deaths?" Shilling asked almost exultantly. "The paper in Mr.
Avery's Bible could have been the list of stamps. The rector wore
what he called street-glasses, and as he had to change them to
read, half the time he would put a paper away in his pocket
without troubling to make the exchange of spectacles."</p>

<p>"So that if the list of stamps had strayed out of the jar, and
been picked up by the rector Saturday night or Sunday morning,
and been thought by him to be the jottings for his next sermon,
he might easily have folded the paper into four lengthways and
placed it in his Bible, to be opened out in the pulpit and read
with his reading-glasses&mdash;yes&mdash;that's possible,
Shilling. But to explain the shock Pointer here thinks he got,
and to explain the subsequent sermon&mdash;as Pointer evidently
thinks it should be explained&mdash;there would have had to be on
the list one or more stamps of such value that it&mdash;or
they&mdash;had immediately shown the rector a dreadful
possibility about the death of young Revell." Weir-Opie was quite
pleased with his perspicacity.</p>

<p>MYSTERY AT THE RECTORY</p>

<p>"Would the rector recognise the value of any rare stamp he
found on the list?" Pointer asked the question now. "And is there
any stamp of great value to be found among Italian stamps?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Weir-Opie said thoughtfully. "I don't
know&mdash;but I'll tell you who would have known and been able
to tell him, and that was Witson. And don't forget that Avery was
driving away from Witson's house when last I saw him about ten on
Saturday night. Witson has a marvellous European stamp
collection. Best in England, bar the Royal ones.</p>

<p>"But that visit would have been before Mr. Avery opened out
the list in church," Pointer reminded the other, "and whatever he
saw on that paper came as a complete surprise to the rector, sir.
I'm sure of that."</p>

<p>"True&mdash;" Weir-Opie frowned, "true! But I'll tell you
what. Witson never talks of anything but his stamps. It's quite
possible that he told Avery about some exceedingly rare stamp,
and, in that mysterious way in which new names always turn up
after being heard for the first time, Avery saw that very stamp
on the list that he looked at in the pulpit on Sunday. His
logical brain would see at once that here was a motive for
Revell's so-called accident. Yes, Shilling, I'm coming round' to
your opinion. This stamp business&mdash;Pointer's way of taking
that sermon of the rector's&mdash;I do agree that Revell's death
may not have been an accident. <i>May</i> not have been only,
mind!"</p>

<p>"That's all I say, sir," Shilling said immediately.
"<i>May</i> not have been."</p>

<p>"I'll have a guarded word with Witson," went on Weir-Opie.</p>

<p>"What is his reputation in the neighbourhood, sir?" Pointer
asked.</p>

<p>Weir-Opie made a face. "One of Carson's Dublin knights. And
not one of the pure patriots. That's the trouble with his wife,
they're not popular. Certainly Sir Hubert isn't."</p>

<p>Pointer wanted to get to the police station telephone at once.
The three drove off in the Chief Constable's car.</p>

<p>Over the station telephone Pointer had a talk with one of the
great philatelists' emporiums of London. He learnt that the
rarest European stamp known was a five centisme grana cobalt
stamp from Sicily. "Few, even of the best collectors, have ever
seen an example. We bought one some years ago from Count
Spingardi, the purchaser of the famous Ferrari collections. We
sold it at once to a member of the Royal family."</p>

<p>"May I ask what the value of another example would be? At the
present time?"</p>

<p>"If it's in perfect condition, I would be pleased to take it
off your hands for five thousand pounds," came the voice at once.
"I'll make you the offer in writing, if you like?"</p>

<p>"Please do," Pointer said. "But above all, will you let me
know the instant such a stamp should be offered?" And with that
he hung up.</p>

<p>"There we are!" said Shilling gleefully, when he heard the
result of Pointer's inquiry.</p>

<p>"I must say&mdash;" murmured Weir-Opie. "It all fits
together...I'll see Witson at once."</p>

<p>The telephone bell rang. It was for the Chief Constable. From
Doctor Rigby. Mr. Avery had died from a dose of almost pure
toadstool juice&mdash;cooked&mdash;and from nothing else.</p>

<p>So, now the death was officially labelled as due to
poison.</p>

<p>And a moment later there was another message&mdash;in
code&mdash;from Hendon&mdash;the fingerprints yielded nothing
unexpected. All the important ones were made by the rector. As
for the dark fluid over the remains of cold beef on the tray, it
was almost pure toadstool juice such as was in the bottle marked
"poison," with a small amount of the genuine Mushroom Extract,
such as was in the bottle so labelled, to give it a harmless
flavour. The rest of the food on the tray was quite as it should
have been. So were the coffee grounds in the cups.</p>

<p>"I thought, and still think, that Mrs. Richard Avery's coffee
may have been drugged," Pointer explained.</p>

<p>"That would account for her saying that she had overslept
herself this morning," murmured Weir-Opie.</p>

<p>"But it also would have stamped it as an inside job," said
Shilling. "Or partly inside. As it is, we're left to find that
out for ourselves."</p>

<p>A constable came in to say that Mr. Byrd would like a word
with the Chief Constable.</p>

<p>"Show him in," was the reply. Weir-Opie got up and stooped to
Pointer's ear.</p>

<p>"One of the people we would like to be sure was in his bed all
last night&mdash;and the Thursday night that Revell died." Then
he straightened to greet a slim, trim, figure that was shown
in.</p>

<p>"Captain Byrd, sir," said the constable.</p>

<p>"Plain Byrd, very plain Byrd," corrected the visitor.</p>

<p>And very plain he was. But it was an interesting face. Hawk-like
nose, hawk-like eyes. Thin flexible sardonic lips. Lantern
jaws, blue shaven. Unexpectedly thick curly hair which gave the
lie to the cold mouth, for it suggested hot blood and
impetuosity. Around five feet six in height, Mr. Byrd was an army
man by the neatness of his well-worn clothes, and by his straight
back. There were lines on his forehead and around his mouth which
suggested a man who had been through great suffering, and
something in the eyes hinted that they had once looked on
terrible things. Pointer put him down, correctly, as about
thirty-eight years old.</p>

<p>"I've come to ask you why my meeting to-night is to be
stopped," Byrd demanded of the Chief Constable.</p>

<p>"Too red," was the laconic reply. "Why must you rail at the
Royal Family as you do? I think it's deuced bad form in a man
who's once worn the King's uniform, and has a pension."</p>

<p>Byrd laughed, a real, but unpleasant laugh. "How can you know
the hue when it's still some hours off."</p>

<p>"From the tint of the last one."</p>

<p>"Well, you're wrong, Major. I was going to talk about my
island, instead."</p>

<p>"Umph," the Major grunted.</p>

<p>"Is it true that the rector's dead?" Byrd continued.
"Poisoning, some are saying. This gentleman here come down
already about it?" He looked at Pointer. "Oh, don't trouble to
say that he is a friend of the family. He's a man from Scotland
Yard or I'll eat my new hat, the one I wear in church when the
rector preaches."</p>

<p>Weir-Opie gave a vexed grin.</p>

<p>"Have I the mark of the beast on my forehead?" Pointer
inquired.</p>

<p>"You have the mark of brains on your forehead," was the
retort.</p>

<p>"Supposing the rector has died from toadstool poisoning. Can
you help us clear up how it happened?" was Weir-Opie's
question.</p>

<p>"So he's gone!" Byrd said under his breath. His lips pinched
together after the words.</p>

<p>"You were here yesterday afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Dropped in for a moment. Found the Gartsides here and we all
walked back together as far as the turning to my cottage."</p>

<p>"What did you talk about?" asked Weir-Opie. "Politics?"</p>

<p>"Religion," said Byrd blandly. "Chiefly. And a word about the
weather probably. And another about Anthony Revell. Well, Major,
I won't detain the hounds straining on the leash." He turned to
the door.</p>

<p>"Can't you help us clear up the mystery&mdash;for there is
one&mdash;about how the rector met his end?" persisted Weir-Opie.</p>

<p>"Haven't the time. Haven't the sources of information that you
can tap," was the rejoinder.</p>

<p>"Which ones would you tap if you had them?" Pointer asked in
his turn.</p>

<p>But Byrd took his leave without replying.</p>

<p>"That's Byrd all over," grumbled the Chief Constable. "You
can't pin him down to anything. The regular demagogue. Though I
will admit he believes in sharing what he has, as well as in
insisting on his right to share in what others have. The rector
and he were at daggers drawn, as I told you, though he never
failed to turn up when Mr. Avery preached. He appreciates a good
thing, does Byrd, in men or&mdash;according to Fraser&mdash;in
stamps."</p>

<p>"Why do you want to know where he was on the night that Mr.
Revell was shot?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"He's Gilbert Revell's great friend. Lady Revell has no idea,
as I happen to know, that the only son now left her is one of
Byrd's most fervent perverts. And with Gilbert a wealthy
man&mdash;Byrd's position may have undergone a tremendous change.
Shilling would tell you, besides, that Byrd and Miss Hill were
supposed to be very interested in one another. Personally I don't
think that's a motive worth considering. I watched the two more
than once at one of his meetings. She acts as secretary for The
Dawn, as he calls his society. She may have been in love with
Byrd. I thought she was. But not Byrd with her, though he was
doubtless quite willing to use her. She put her name down as one
of his island refugees. Another name of his for any one willing
to plunk down a hundred pounds, and go out with him to some
island&mdash;latitude and longitude unknown&mdash;where all are
to live in complete idleness, and yet in comfort. I forget how it
is to be worked."</p>

<p>Weir-Opie gave an impatient snort.</p>

<p>"But that island has come a lot nearer now that Anthony
Revell's dead and Gilbert Revell reigns in his stead?" Pointer
queried, and got a nod for assent.</p>

<p>There was a short silence.</p>

<p>Then Shilling had reluctantly, and very temporarily, to remain
at his station, but Weir-Opie and Pointer drove back to the
rectory where the Major told Fraser that the rector's death was
due to toadstool poisoning, and that since Chief Inspector
Pointer of New Scotland Yard happened to be staying down here, he
was taking charge of the investigation into how the rector could
have taken the poison, or had it given to him. And with that he
too had to hurry off.</p>

<p>Fraser needed a second repetition before he understood what
was being said. He refused point-blank to believe it at first,
then he grew very pale and very agitated indeed. He took him
upstairs, opened the door into Mrs. Avery's sitting-room and
shoved the Chief Inspector in as though he were a parcel, and the
room a post office counter, then he went slowly downstairs,
feeling numbed by the dreadful turn that the tragedy had
taken.</p>

<p>Both Doris and Grace were in the room, Grace had evidently
been crying.</p>

<p>On being shown the crystal necklace they recognised it
immediately as belonging to Lady Revell. The finding of the
necklace in the study did not appear to have any significance,
but as Pointer went down to the lounge he almost ran into Olive
Hill. He introduced himself, explaining the reason for his
presence in general words. Then he showed her the necklace. She
looked at it with an apparently indifferent glance, and said that
she did not think that she had ever seen it before, but then, she
added, she was dreadfully unobservant. If so, she did not look
it. She next said that she must have some fresh air after the
shock of the dreadful news about the rector. Pointer had no right
to stop her, even had he wished to. Pulling on a beret with a
careless hand, she hurried on out, just as the Gartsides were
announced. Their greetings were of the coldest and briefest, he
saw. He was expecting the visitors, for he had got Shilling to
telephone to them as soon as he, Pointer, had left with Weir-Opie,
telling them of the rector's death from toadstool
poisoning, and asking them to go up at once to the rectory for a
word with Chief Inspector Pointer.</p>

<p>The Gartsides explained that having been asked by Revell's
solicitor to come down and choose some souvenirs left them in
Anthony Revell's will, they had arrived on Friday, taken rooms
for the night at a farmhouse which the solicitor had recommended,
collected the souvenirs on Saturday, and called at the rectory on
Sunday afternoon. After waiting in vain for the rector's return,
they had asked for a word with Miss Hill. She, too, was out, and
being at a loose end, they had stayed on till to-day, Monday.
They wanted to meet Mr. Avery, of whom Revell had often
spoken&mdash;and above all, to meet Revell's fiance, Miss
Hill.</p>

<p>Mary Gartside's jaw seemed to set as she said this. She was a
tall young woman. Big-boned&mdash;very thin and very proud of her
thinness&mdash;with a good complexion, well-waved russet hair and
a strident voice.</p>

<p>She did not make a good impression. She looked a thruster. Nor
did he care for her brother's face either. But liking or
disliking meant nothing to him He told them that the doctor said
that Mr. Avery had died from the effects of toadstool poisoning;
there would be an inquest therefore to-morrow&mdash;Tuesday
afternoon, and would they kindly stay for it?</p>

<p>They would stay for it and for the funeral on Wednesday, of
course, they said instantly.</p>

<p>Pointer led the talk to Mr. Revell, and asked about his stamp
collection. Had that been one of the things left them? Gartside
said that Revell had left them any four souvenirs they liked to
take. As a matter of fact, among the things they had chosen, such
as a pair of field-glasses, and so on, he, Gartside had added a
stamp album which Revell had started, or more likely had had
started for him, when a boy. It was the typical schoolboy's lot,
of no value whatever. But it was a jolly good album, and
Gartside's young brother would like it.</p>

<p>As to Byrd, they confirmed his account of the short talk
yesterday. It had turned chiefly&mdash;what there was of
it&mdash;on the rector's sermon which seemed to have impressed
Byrd. They themselves never went to church.</p>

<p>Pointer finally had a few words about Anthony Revell. The
Gartsides were not over willing to talk of him, but Pointer could
be as dense as the next man when he wished. After they had left,
he went carefully over the rooms at the rectory. The books of
each inmate interested the Chief Inspector. A man's friends are
not always of his choosing, but his bedside books are.</p>

<p>Grace's were chiefly scholarly works. Olive had novels of a
bitter tinge. <i>The House of Mirth</i> seemed to be a prime
favourite. Pointer did not think that Olive Hill would fail
through any of Lily's faults. Did she keep it by her as a warning
not to let opportunity slip? Mrs. Richard Avery had a few books
from the circulating library in the place of honour. Chiefly
travel or autobiography. Nothing subtle for her. In a cupboard
above her washstand he found a nearly empty bottle marked
"Sleeping Mixture."</p>

<p>She was in her sitting-room as he went downstairs, and he
asked her about it. She explained that she was always a poor
sleeper and that every now and then she took a dose to give her a
good night, and that, most unfortunately, last night had been one
of these. Indeed, as she had had a very hilarious though small
dinner party, she had felt so wide awake on going up to bed that,
to ensure a sound sleep, she had taken an unusually full
dose.</p>

<p>Was any one with her when she took it, he asked as casually as
he could make it sound, explaining that had she, say, been
talking she might have taken even more of a dose than she had
intended.</p>

<p>He was told that Miss Hill was in the bedroom at the time. She
chanced to come in to ask about some library subscriptions which
were overdue and stepped in just as she, Doris, was pouring the
stuff out into a table spoon, but Doris scoffed at the idea that
that, or anything else, would make her overdo a drug.</p>

<p>Pointer left her with the riddle of last night's deafness
explained. Given a strong sleeping draught taken late, and Avery
might indeed have called and pounded in vain. That problem
disposed of, he had a talk with Fraser. He wanted, first of all,
to know the hour when he had last seen his master alive. It was
around half-past ten, Fraser could not give it precisely, but it
was when Mrs. Richard Avery left the study after seeing her
guests off. Mr. Avery was holding the door open for her. Fraser
thought that the master had looked more cheerful than he had
earlier in the day. Fraser, who happened to be passing, had
wished him good-night, closed the door for him, and gone on to
his own room and to bed.</p>

<p>As to the position of the tray, Fraser showed exactly where he
had stood, how wide open the door between the two rooms had
been&mdash;and other details that must be entered among the facts
of the case, but which in Pointer's opinion had little real
bearing on this murder. For the two rooms were thickly carpeted,
the door between them was often shut, and rarely wide open, and
it was only when open to its fullest extent that it was possible,
from where Mr. Avery sat writing, to see the table on which the
tray had been placed, the table between the east window of the
study and the fernery door.</p>

<p>It would have been quite possible for any one who knew the
place and knew that the rector was busy in the library and who
had the necessary coolness and nerve, to have come in by the door
into the fernery, watched their time, stepped into the study,
slipped the papers into the bell-pushes, lifted off the bottle of
mushroom Catchup from the tray, all but emptied it in the fernery
basin, filled it up with toadstool extract from the bottle
standing there, and replaced the so-called ketchup on the tray.
After that there would be nothing to do but to lock the study
door on the outside after they heard the rector busy at his
supper, take the key and quietly place the boards in
position.</p>

<p>Then, when all was still inside that dreadful room, they would
unlock the door, make sure that their victim really was dead, and
start the search which Pointer believed had
lasted&mdash;unsuccessfully&mdash;until close on the time for the
servants to start Monday's work.</p>

<p>He now had the housemaid in for a talk. Maggie, as she
preferred to be called, gave a rather hysterical account of how
she had gone in as usual and opened the window and the shutters
of the study.</p>

<p>Next Pointer had to run over the list of visitors yesterday
with the butler and try to find out if there were any oddities
about their stay in the house. Weir-Opie had already vouched for
the harmlessness of the young couple who had dined at the
rectory, they were an army man and his young wife. Neither of
them likely to be the least interested in poisons. Fraser seemed
to have nothing to add to the few details which he had already
given.</p>

<p>Pointer next decided to have a word with the Revells'
solicitor about the Gartsides and their recent legacies. An
inquiry at the office told him that the firm's junior partner,
Mr. Merton, was at the moment away at The Causeway seeing to some
details.</p>

<p>Before setting out to walk the short distance, Pointer stood a
while looking at his shoe tips, as a crystal reader might consult
her crystal.</p>

<p>He thought over the sequence of events as so far known to him.
If such a stamp as that priced to him could have lain unknown at
The Causeway, and if, in making the list for the rector, Revell
had let it be seen by some one who knew the value of stamps, and
who did not know that the stamps in question were to be given
away, that person might have come to The Causeway to hunt for it.
Come more than once, because drawers and cupboards would be
locked. The thief might well have tried place after place. That
would explain the odd fact that it was in his dining-room that
Revell's dead body had been found, with no sign of any effort
having been made to get a room ready for the night. Supposing, as
the jury at the trial had, that Revell at once, on entering his
home, had seen signs that the house had been entered during his
absence, and found those signs most noticeable in the
drawing-room...</p>

<p>He walked up to The Causeway. It was only ten minutes
away.</p>

<p>As the front door was opened to him, Pointer saw a young man
with some papers under his arm just ready to come out who stood
aside for him to be shown in. As he heard the name he
wheeled.</p>

<p>"Chief Inspector Pointer? My name is Harry Merton. I'm the
junior partner of the Revells' solicitors, and the Averys' too.
I've just left the senior partner&mdash;Mr. Smith&mdash;talking
to Major Weir-Opie about the rector's dreadful death."</p>

<p>He opened a door, motioned the detective officer in and closed
it. Harry Merton had a humorous round face, covered with
freckles, and an air of being very much entertained by life,
though his mouth hinted that, if not entertained, he might get
bored. His way of greeting Pointer suggested that he looked upon
him as a short cut to a good deal of interest.</p>

<p>"Want to look round here? Why <i>here?</i> I understand that
you're making sure there wasn't anything funny about the rector's
death. But what brings you here?"</p>

<p>"I'd like to know what the Gartsides chose to take," Pointer
said without answering the question. "They told me, but I would
rather like to check it."</p>

<p>"They seemed to me reliable enough," Merton said, "but of
course you have to be suspicious, I suppose?" he added
questioningly.</p>

<p>"Oh, very," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Here's the list of what they took," Merton began to look
bored. He held out a slip of signed paper to the other. Pointer
looked it over.</p>

<p>"Stamp album&mdash;" he seemed to ponder the choice.</p>

<p>Merton gave him a swift glance and nodded meaningly. "Just so.
Miss Hill thought it was to go to her. She assured me that Revell
had promised it to her the last time he dined at the rectory,
when the talk happened to turn on stamps. But of course&mdash;if
the Gartsides wanted it&mdash;and as he hadn't made a new
will&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Some Italian stamps she wanted, I believe?"</p>

<p>Merton looked as though he would stifle a yawn in another
minute. "I only know what she said to me," he explained. "I'm not
interested in stamps myself."</p>

<p>"Unlike the rector, or as I understand, Mr. Revell," threw in
Pointer.</p>

<p>He was in the drawing-room and looking about him as he spoke.
On each side of the fireplace, arched recesses had been turned
into china cupboards as far as the top halfs were concerned, but
the lower halfs were cupboards, and locked. Facing the fireplace
was a very handsome old chiffonier. Its three divisions were
locked. There was a smallish walnut tallboy in one corner. Its
drawers were all locked. A bureau bookcase&mdash;also
locked&mdash;was at one side of the window. Pointer asked if
these had all been locked when Mr. Revell left for his climbing
holiday. Merton nodded. He looked quite sharply at the detective
officer, but there was something about Pointer, for all his
simple manner, that did not encourage people to take liberties
with him. Pointer asked if he might have a glance round the other
rooms now he was here, but Saunders told him they were all
absolutely empty. The furniture had just been removed to The
Flagstaff, but nothing from this room had been taken. Lady Revell
and Gilbert were agreed on that.</p>

<p>By this time the young man was talking quite freely about
Anthony Revell. "Handsomest chap I have ever seen. Easily."</p>

<p>"And knew it?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"The women knew it," was the reply. "How they ran after him!
Not Miss Hill though. I will say that for her." Merton seemed to
be able to convey a whole sentence by what he did not say. His
last might have stated in so many words that there was nothing
else he could, or would, say for her.</p>

<p>Pointer saw that if any one had wanted to search The
Causeway's drawing-room for those stamps, it would have taken a
long time. He asked to have a look at the fastenings of the back
doors.</p>

<p>"Look here," Merton said, "you don't think&mdash;you're not
here to go into Revell's death, are you? His tone told the other
that, if so, Merton would not be absolutely surprised.</p>

<p>"Well," Pointer said, "I don't feel as certain as the Coroner
seems to have done that everything was as he thought it."</p>

<p>"Oh, him!" was the disgusted one word which spoke volumes.
"He's my senior partner," he added glumly. "My father died two
years ago and I was just down from Oxford. There was nothing for
it but to buckle into his old harness." Again a volume was
compressed of vain longings and dreams, and straitened means.
"Old Smith is all right," Merton went on, "but he's slow and
dense. And never can see beyond the length of his nose." By this
time they were at the back door. It would have been difficult to
open from the outside, but Pointer saw that it would be quite
easy to slip back the catch of the pantry window.</p>

<p>Pointer asked Merton what he thought of the Gartsides.</p>

<p>Merton had not liked either of them. He thought them too keen
on getting the most expensive of the objects from which they
could choose.</p>

<p>"Did they look for any length of time before selecting their
souvenirs?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"They <i>did!"</i> Again Merton's tone spoke volumes. "In fact
I'm afraid I left them to make their own choice at the end, they
were so slow. Everything of importance had been inventoried, you
see. Besides, they were chiefly interested in papers. She wanted
a chance to get back some of her letters, two of his cupboards
are chock-a-block with them, and I didn't see why not, She did
take them. All!"</p>

<p>"Was she, too, interested in Mr. Revell?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"Very much so. Underneath. That's why he came home, in my
opinion. Only in <i>my</i> opinion, Chief Inspector. But she
struck me as hot stuff&mdash;and I never did believe in that
about Leland&mdash;that's his dentist, for Mr. Smith had a talk
with him, and learnt that Revell had had all his teeth put in
perfect order only a month before. But any port in a storm! He
fled&mdash;in my humble opinion."</p>

<p>"And you say she wanted all her letters? Well, that's natural.
I wonder if you have any specimen you could let me have of her
and her brother's handwritings."</p>

<p>Putting his papers down, Merton obligingly hunted until he
found two short notes, one from the brother, one from the sister,
which he lent Pointer against a receipt.</p>

<p>"By the way, did either of them ask specifically for any of
the things?"</p>

<p>They had not, he was told.</p>

<p>He next asked Merton if he had any idea how Mr. Avery had left
his money.</p>

<p>Merton knew all about the rector's will, and very simple it
was. Five thousand went to Miss Avery, who was already amply
provided for. Richard Avery was left an equal amount, and for the
same reason. Mrs. Richard Avery, to whom the furniture at the
rectory went, also got five thousand&mdash;free of death duties
in each case. The bulk of the estate went to charities.</p>

<p>Grace and Richard Avery shared the pictures, and the silver,
between them. The will was drawn up a couple of years ago, and
its contents were known to all the household, said Merton.</p>

<p>Pointer thanked him and drove on to The Flagstaff.

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9"></a>CHAPTER NINE</h2>

<p class="first">AT The Flagstaff, Pointer was shown at once into
a room where a tall slender woman rose to meet him, and he saw
the second of the faces which had shown such uneasiness during
the sermon yesterday. Lady Revell seemed to feel the rector's
death very much, quite apart from the manner of it. Pointer asked
her about her visit to him yesterday evening. There was just an
infinitesimal pause, then Lady Revell said that she had not gone
to the rectory last night. She had intended to, but a headache
had come on, and she had countermanded the car almost as soon as
she had ordered it. She had meant to telephone as much to the
rector, but her headache had made her forget that too. She was
without a personal maid at the moment, and such things were apt
to slip her mind, she said, with a very charming smile. Pointer
found her altogether charming, but she had, none the less, he
thought, the face of one who would not care the snap of one of
her mania red fingers for law as law. It would simply not exist
in any reckoning of hers. He felt sure that Lady Revell
considered herself as being outside it, not so much by birth, for
it was an attitude that Pointer had found equally in the very
lowly born, as from some attitude of mind that made the person
concerned only see what they wanted to see, and as they wanted to
see it. A dangerous character to find on the scene of a crime, or
near it. He asked her about the necklace which he drew out of an
envelope. She opened her eyes wide.</p>

<p>"Where did you find that? I could swear it was lying upstairs
in a little cabinet I keep for such stones. Why, I showed it to
Miss Hill not long ago, and I haven't worn it since, I feel
sure."</p>

<p>Pointer told her where he had picked it up. She seemed
puzzled.</p>

<p>"I know I wore it when I was there last. But that's weeks ago.
Surely it was after that that Miss Hill called? I know it was.
How odd! However, I suppose I must have worn it and forgotten
about it. Thank you for finding it and returning it to me." She
extended her hand, for Pointer had the necklace back in his own
fingers by now. At her gesture he said at once that unfortunately
this must remain in his custody until the inquiry was over, as it
had been found in the room where the rector died.</p>

<p>"As you like," she replied, with what seemed indifference.</p>

<p>"For&mdash;forgive my bluntness, but the presence of this
necklace in the rectory study last night must be explained. Had
you been to see the rector at nine, and had then been wearing it,
there would, of course, be no difficulty whatever."</p>

<p>Pointer now added that the police had to be quite sure that
the poison had not been given to Mr. Avery deliberately&mdash;by
another person.</p>

<p>Lady Revell looked incredulous horror.</p>

<p>"But who could have done such a thing? He hadn't an enemy in
the world! We all loved the rector. We all set our moral clocks
by him, as it were. Oh, you can't <i>really</i> believe such a
possibility."</p>

<p>"We do," Pointer assured her very gravely with something very
stern in his face. "We do. And so everything in that room last
night, Lady Revell, must be accounted for."</p>

<p>She seemed unable to help about the necklace which was by now
back in an envelope in his pocket.</p>

<p>"I will have a word with the Chief Constable," Lady Revell
said, a touch of hauteur in her tone. "Major Weir-Opie knows me
well&mdash;and may be less keen on red tape."</p>

<p>Pointer bowed, apologised for troubling her, and was shown
out.</p>

<p>He was not happy as he drove away. Women were the devil in a
serious investigation, he thought. So often their actions, which
looked so suspicious, were so innocent, or at least so trivial.
But here?</p>

<p>Pointer did not feel sure either that Lady Revell was lying,
or that she was telling the truth. But of one thing he did feel
confident, and that was that, given provocation, the woman whom
he had just seen was capable of having flung that necklace to the
floor and of having left it there, damning the consequences. She
was the type to cut off her nose <i>con brio</i> to spite her
face, once she was really angry. But surely Mr. Avery would not
have put her, or any woman, into a passion? But against that was
the fact that three faces that Pointer had noticed yesterday
during the sermon remained in his mind as having shown signs of
very intense emotion. Miss Hill, Lady Revell, and a woman whom he
had not yet identified. A woman dressed in violet, with deep
rings around her eyes, and a general unkempt look. Not one of the
three had glanced at the other. On the contrary, he believed from
their expressions that each had felt herself alone with the
rector and with some terrifying knowledge of his. He thought of
Olive Hill hastening to The Flagstaff. She had had the
opportunity, he felt sure, of taking a necklace off Lady Revell's
dressing-table had she wished to do so, and had such a necklace
lain there...But why? Then she too was put on one side, until
further facts should throw added light on her.</p>

<p>Near the rectory gates he passed Dr. Rigby who promptly
stopped his car for a word.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was toadstool poisoning all right, to give it its
homely name, and in a concentrated form which could only have
come from that bottle of his in the little fernery." He went on
to give technical details.</p>

<p>"How long would it have taken to kill him, do you think?"
Pointer asked when these were over.</p>

<p>"An hour of agony would see the end, I think," the doctor said
with a gruffness that hid real feeling. "And his supper was eaten
when?"</p>

<p>"We've worked everything out very carefully and in detail,
checking one thing with another. I don't think I'm far out, if at
all, in saying that he took that hell-brew some time between ten
and midnight, and that everything was over in an hour. But why
didn't he call for help or ring a bell? Or stagger into the hall?
That's what beats me." And with a groan the doctor drove on.</p>

<p>Pointer was met by Doris who was very pale and looked very sad
as he entered the rectory. There was nothing of her old spring
left in her step. "I wonder if you have found a letter I left in
the library," she began, "a letter from my husband, stating when
he would be back and giving me all sorts of directions as to what
he wanted me to do meanwhile. It was the one I wanted to read to
the rector last night when I stepped in after dinner."</p>

<p>Pointer said that he had not as yet seen it. Would she care to
come in and have a look for it? She said that she would very much
like to, as the dreadful shock of the rector's death had driven
all remembrance out of her mind of what her husband had asked her
to do.</p>

<p>They went in together and she hunted for her letter. It looked
for a long time as though it were lost. And it was Pointer who
found it at last, underneath a lining paper in the back of a
drawer in the library.</p>

<p>"The rector must have thrust it in here. I suppose I left it
on the table top, it was in his way, he dropped it in here and
then it got pushed to the back of the drawer under the paper,"
she said as she took it from him.</p>

<p>Pointer thought that the place where it had been found was
odd, seeing that all the rest of the drawers and shelves in the
room only held papers or notes connected with the rector's
religious writings. It looked to him as though the letter had
been deliberately hidden.</p>

<p>"There are no directions in it, I suppose, that any one would
want postponed?" he said now tentatively.</p>

<p>She looked startled. She hastily skimmed through it again.
Then she held it out.</p>

<p>"You are quite at liberty to read it," she said quietly,
"though it's very affectionate, for it's only meant for my own
eyes. But perhaps you had better read it through."</p>

<p>He apologised for the necessity and did so. It was the letter
of a man to a very dearly loved wife, one moreover whose judgment
the writer evidently valued highly.</p>

<p>Richard explained that, owing to his hurry to get home to her,
he had omitted certain legal formalities in the deed of sale of
his West African property, which must be put right at once or it
would be invalidated. It would be at least another month before
he could be in England. Most of the letter referred to this.
Finally came an allusion to Miss Hill. Mrs. Richard had written
that she wanted to stay on with her, as her secretary. Richard
Avery did not want this, that much was clear. He suggested that
they should have their house to themselves for at least a year,
unless she could make some arrangement for Olive Hill to live
outside. He wrote sympathetically of her loss, spoke of Revell as
though he had liked him, and wound up by asking whether the
Revell treasure had been found yet. Then came a most affectionate
conclusion full of happy hopes for a future in which neither need
be parted from the other for more than a few hours.</p>

<p>"The Revell treasure, what is that?" Pointer asked as he
thanked her for letting him read the letter, and handed it
back.</p>

<p>She had not noticed the phrase and had to read it herself
again.</p>

<p>"Oh, some idea of Anthony Revell's grandfather that there was
a treasure hidden in the house. Of course there isn't. The dear
old man was quite in his second childhood, and whenever he
thought he was being left on one side by his children, he would
let some allusion drop as to a treasure at The Causeway whose
whereabouts he alone knew.</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, the rector did find that where The
Causeway now stands an old manor belonging to the Fettiplaces had
stood, who have all long died out. He fancied at one time that
there might be something in old Mr. Revell's maunderings. Though
I oughtn't to call them that, for he only very rarely spoke of
the treasure. Anthony thought that he tried to say something to
him about it on his death-bed, but the rector, who was present
too, was sure that he was speaking of a good conscience...that
sort of treasure."</p>

<p>"I wonder what he really said?" Pointer spoke lightly. "I mean
the old gentleman...when he was dying."</p>

<p>But Doris knew no more than what she had said. She was looking
around the room as she talked. For her husband, she said, had
enclosed a message for the rector about the kind of house which
he hoped to be able to find near the rectory. This was written on
a separate half sheet, on paper such as the rector always used,
and such as Richard Avery had sent out to him regularly.</p>

<p>"It's so odd to lose it when the rest of the letter is here.
It must be close at hand," she insisted.</p>

<p>They both set to work to hunt for it.</p>

<p>"I had both letter and it in my hand," she went on, "when I
stepped in here."</p>

<p>Searching and talking, she explained that she had gone to the
library as soon as her visitors had left her last night to hand
it to the rector, but he had been writing and was so busily
engrossed in his work, that she had put it off for a better time:
There was nothing pressing in her husband's message. The rector
asked her to look up a reference for him, and she must then have
laid down her letter. The rector was working against time, and
she had stayed about a quarter of an hour jotting down which
editions he had consulted, until she had finally gone to bed.</p>

<p>"I could have stayed much longer," she added in a tone of deep
grief, "and if I had known&mdash;"</p>

<p>She turned away for a minute and tried desperately for
composure. By this time they had finished their search, and she
sank into a chair, with her face working as she covered it with
her hands.</p>

<p>"I miss the rector so frightfully, and so will my husband! He
doesn't know yet&mdash;I don't want him to know till he gets
here." She jumped up after a moment, realising, Pointer thought,
that she would be sobbing aloud in another minute, and fairly ran
from the library and up to her own room.</p>

<p>Standing by the door as he closed it behind her, he felt some
one try it gently. Pointer opened it on the instant. Miss Hill
looked a little taken aback, he thought.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Richard was looking for something, wasn't she?" she
began rather breathlessly.</p>

<p>"How did you know that?" Pointer asked with a smile, holding
the door wider open for her to come in.</p>

<p>"I heard the unmistakable sounds of something being hunted
for," she said easily. "I was waiting for her up in her bedroom,"
she continued in answer to the question in his eyes, "and you
hear everything up there. That's what makes it so difficult to
understand that she didn't hear anything last night.</p>

<p>"I wish I could find whatever she has lost," Miss Hill went on
swiftly, "she's sobbing her heart out in her bedroom. She says it
does not matter, but I would so like to find it for her. It must
be something very important to upset her so. It's a letter, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>Pointer did not tell her what it was, he only said that he, as
well as Mrs. Avery, had searched the two rooms carefully, but if
Miss Hill thought she would have better luck&mdash;he indicated
that the room was at her disposal.</p>

<p>A plain-clothes man entered and without a word to Pointer went
to a table in the window and sitting facing the room began to
fill a sheet of paper with writing. As Pointer explained to Miss
Hill, Jackson would not be in the way, as there were no drawers
in the table at which he would be writing down some facts for the
Chief Constable. Nor would he be long, he added.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't let him hurry away on my account," begged Miss Hill
as Pointer left the room.</p>

<p>A moment later Mrs. Avery, restored to her usual outwardly
calm self, was now coming down the stairs. She did not look in
the least as though she had been indulging in any such wild grief
as Miss Hill had reported.</p>

<p>Pointer motioned her into the room on the opposite side of the
broad lounge.</p>

<p>"Miss Hill is trying to find the enclosure for you," he said
easily.</p>

<p>She stared. "What <i>do</i> you mean? She doesn't know that
it's lost," she said.</p>

<p>She was out of the dining-room and crossing to the study door
as she spoke. Then she paused. He saw her shudder.</p>

<p>"I hate more and more to go in," she said frankly, but she
turned the handle before he reached it and stepped inside. So did
Pointer.</p>

<p>Jackson was just helping Miss Hill get down an etching off its
nail.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" Mrs. Richard asked with her quiet
directness, but in a manner that softened her words.</p>

<p>"This young lady couldn't reach it, ma'am," explained
Jackson.</p>

<p>"I want to find the paper you've lost," Olive Hill said
sweetly to Mrs. Avery.</p>

<p>"But I haven't lost it," was the reply. "I've only mislaid it.
Besides, unless you have second sight, Olive, how could you know
anything about it?" Mrs. Avery spoke with something of sternness
in her voice.</p>

<p>"I heard a hunt going on&mdash;among papers&mdash;so it could
only be a letter that you had lost," Olive said stubbornly. "I've
lost one too, as it happens&mdash;about a month ago."</p>

<p>"Oh? Was it for that you hunted through my room this morning
before I was up?" Mrs. Avery asked coldly.</p>

<p>Olive said nothing. She had turned pale. "Come, Olive," Mrs.
Avery went on sharply, "be sensible, and tell us what you are
looking for? Then we could help you. I'm sure it's for something
of your own&mdash;not mine."</p>

<p>Olive did not speak for a moment, she stood staring down at
the etching which lay on the table now.</p>

<p>Christopher Byrd was shown in just then. Pointer had given
orders that whenever he or a constable was inside the room,
people could come and go in it as they liked. The room was to
seem unwatched.</p>

<p>Byrd had a few words to say to Mrs. Avery of really very well
expressed regret at her brother-in-law's death. Then he
turned.</p>

<p>"What's wrong with the etching?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Ask Miss Hill," came from Mrs. Avery. "She's hunting for
something, and we want to help her."</p>

<p>Olive Hill turned a very inscrutable look on Byrd, on Mrs.
Avery, on Pointer. "It's something of Mr. Revell's that I'm
looking for," she said at last very quietly.</p>

<p>Byrd gave an exclamation. It was under his breath, but
something in the quality of the voice registered with the Chief
Inspector as a man who had had a most unexpected jolt, and one
that went deep.</p>

<p>He said nothing, however. Only with narrowed eyes he stared
hard at the girl. Olive did not look at him now.</p>

<p>She was very plain to-day. Her face was white. There were
circles around her eyes. And never had the Chief Inspector looked
into a face more impossible to read except that it was very
agitated under its composure.</p>

<p>She was trembling slightly as she stood there before them.
Doris saw it too.</p>

<p>"We can't talk in here. It's not decent somehow. Come into the
morning-room, Olive, and tell us what you are really after."</p>

<p>They followed her out. Even Byrd, after a second's hesitation,
went too.</p>

<p>In the morning-room Grace was sitting with her face white and
drawn.</p>

<p>"Olive is looking for something," Doris said to her, "and we
all want to help her find it."</p>

<p>Grace hardly seemed to hear.</p>

<p>Olive, too, made no reply for a minute.</p>

<p>"Sit down," Doris ordered in her peremptory way. Olive sank on
to the arm of a chair but her face was contracted and closed.</p>

<p>"I believe she's after the treasure!" Byrd put in with a
discordant half-laugh.</p>

<p>For a moment Olive did not answer, then she looked at him.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said then, "or rather for an account of where it is
to be found."</p>

<p>"Oh, come!" he protested. "I was only joking. Of course
there's no treasure at The Causeway. If you've mislaid some of
his letters to you, if you wait till things are straightened out
they'll turn up of themselves."</p>

<p>Olive did not condescend to look at him, she stared dully in
front of her. But she was not apathetic, Pointer felt sure of
that. Rather was she in that wrought-up mood in which a man does
not care what happens, what dangers he is running into. Though,
ordinarily, he judged that this young woman would be more than
usually circumspect. She looked to him the kind to weigh, as a
rule, every word she said before saying it, let alone every
action.</p>

<p>She walked on out of the room, and as Byrd opened the door for
her, she said a quick word in his ear. He followed her, and
Jackson too found that he had to fetch something from the hall at
the same time.</p>

<p>Doris sat on in amazement. "So that was why she wanted Dick to
buy The Causeway," she finally said, "but how silly! Hidden
treasure! Grace, can you believe it?"</p>

<p>Grace did not look up.</p>

<p>"About her searching your room this morning?" Pointer
asked.</p>

<p>Doris told him that that was only a chance shot, and explained
what had really happened. "Though why she's started it all up
just now&mdash;now&mdash;to-day," she said under her breath, and
still looking as though she had found a quite new side of Olive
Hill to study, went on up to her own room.</p>

<p>Grace rose and followed her.</p>

<p>The scene was very odd, but of one thing Pointer was sure, and
that was that though Olive Hill had accepted the suggestion made
half or wholly in jest, by Christopher Burd, that she was
interested in hunting for a possible treasure at The Causeway, it
was not true. It was quite a plausible suggestion for a girl
without any money who might be presumed to have heard Anthony
Revell talk of it, but it was not true... She was after something
else. Stamps? But what most interested the astute detective was
that she had given him the impression of being on the verge of
burning her boats when Christopher had interfered and suggested
something at which he himself scoffed a moment later.</p>

<p>Olive had whispered to Byrd to come with her for a moment. Her
hand on his arm she pulled him into the dining-room.</p>

<p>"Chris, I'm frightened," she murmured.</p>

<p>She laid her cheek suddenly against his Her skin was like
satin, and smelt like a clove pink.</p>

<p>He pushed her away. "None of that," he whispered roughly. "I
don't trust you, darling. I don't like you, love. You may have
tricked poor Revell, but you can't hoodwink Christopher Byrd.
What you got out of Revell that you've lost I haven't an earthly.
Something you've no right to. Mr. Avery knew of it. I say he
did!" for she opened her lips to speak. She turned a livid white
at his words. He pushed her away. "Don't you suppose I watched
your face when that sermon of his got under weigh?" he went on
ruthlessly. "You were on hot coals. I think there was a moment
when you thought he was going to be plainer still. Pity he
wasn't, as things have turned out."</p>

<p>"He had learned that I didn't love Anthony," she said
breathlessly. "Grace had told him," there was fury in her low
tone, in her eye.</p>

<p>Byrd stared at her in contemptuous silence for a second. Then
he gave his short, cutting laugh.</p>

<p>"And you think that explains his sermon." He made for the
door, but her next words stopped him.</p>

<p>"I'm coming out with you to the Dutch Indies, to Maboa. I've
got my hundred pounds ready to pay in, and I'm coming!"</p>

<p>"Your money will be returned to you," he said sharply. "I told
you that we take married couples, and engaged couples, but not
single women."</p>

<p>"Yes, and I was coming as your wife!" she retorted.</p>

<p>"And two weeks after that was arranged, you were engaged to
Revell."</p>

<p>"I told you that I didn't love him! I only got engaged
because&mdash;because&mdash;" her face worked with some dark
passion.</p>

<p>"Of the Fettiplaces' treasure?" he asked in derision.</p>

<p>"I got engaged to Anthony to show that I could have him if I
wanted him. I never intended to marry him. Never! I was going to
marry you!" Her face was suddenly
beseeching&mdash;soft&mdash;alluring. He refused to look at her,
but stared at the carpet as he had stared at the ground once when
Mr. Avery had seen them together in the woods.</p>

<p>"What was it that made the rector preach that sermon?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>Her face paled. She swallowed, tried to speak, and before she
got a word out, he was gone, and had closed the door behind him
with something of finality in the very sound.

<h2><a name="ch10"></a>CHAPTER TEN</h2>

<p class="first">POINTER would have been very interested had he
been able to overhear the talk between Grace and Doris after
Byrd's suggestion of a motive for Olive's search.</p>

<p>"I can't make Olive out," Doris said as the two sisters-in-law
reached her sitting-room. "In a way I'm grateful to her for
giving me something to think about other than John's terrible
end, and my mother's illness. And she does puzzle me! What she's
after&mdash;I wonder if it <i>is</i> that quite incredible tale
of hidden treasure? You know," she motioned Grace to sit beside
her on the little couch, and spoke very low, but with the
unmistakable look of one glad to talk, "she certainly hunted for
something at The Causeway too. I wondered what took her over
there so regularly, but one day when I went there
myself&mdash;Jack thought that Patricia Revell might be there,
and I wanted a word with her&mdash;I found Olive buried head and
shoulders in a boot cupboard. And her face when I opened the door
on her! Consternation is too mild a word for it. Evidently she is
after that mythical treasure!"</p>

<p>"I wonder!" Grace said musingly. "For I learnt yesterday that
she's been in the habit of taking our letters from the postman
and bringing them herself up to the house. That isn't explained
by hunting for treasure at The Causeway.</p>

<p>"I missed a postal order that should have arrived a week ago,"
Grace continued. "No, it's quite all right, as a matter of fact,
the 'Brownie' in question forgot to post it. But I met Bowles,
one of our postmen, as I walked back from evening service last
night&mdash;yes, I know you find it hard enough to go in the
mornings&mdash;Well, to go on, I asked Bowles whether there was
any chance of the letter I was inquiring about having been
overlooked. He got very flustered and finally said that if one
had got lost, it was much more likely to be between the rectory
gate and its letter-box. But that he hadn't liked to refuse when
Olive offered to take them herself to the house. He's getting old
and it is a bit of a walk up from the gates&mdash;at his
age."</p>

<p>"But how? Where was she? When was this?" Doris was all at
sea.</p>

<p>"It seems that Olive was always gardening when the postman
arrived." Grace spoke with something of Doris's own occasional
pungency of tone. "Gardening by the gates!"</p>

<p>"Those annuals!" breathed Doris. "She begged to be let plant
them herself, and look after them herself."</p>

<p>Grace made an acquiescent gesture.</p>

<p>"John thought first she was getting in training for The
Causeway gardens, then that she was trying to get over her grief
at Anthony's loss," Doris said. "He let her have that corner to
play with. But why? And she's neglected the place dreadfully just
of late, as I expected she would."</p>

<p>"'Why' is what I say," Grace repeated. "I don't see how
hunting for The Causeway's treasure&mdash;even supposing she were
so silly as to believe that tale&mdash;would explain her taking
our letters from the postman for nearly a fortnight."</p>

<p>"When did she start doing this?" Then Doris answered herself.
"Let me see, she planted out that bed in the last week of May.
Just around the time that Anthony died&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just so," agreed Grace. "And from that time on she was always
on hand to take any letters from Bowles or Herrick&mdash;Bowles
says Herrick, the second postman, handed them to her too. And, a
fortnight ago, her interest in the flowers stopped..."</p>

<p>Doris sat silent, considering.</p>

<p>"I remembered the way that letter to you from Dick had been
mislaid a month ago," went on Grace. "I had handed it to her at
once on its arrival, and she told me that she had given it to you
immediately. But you didn't get it till you found it for
yourself&mdash;next day."</p>

<p>"I can't see what interest Olive could have in Dick's letters
to me," Doris said slowly. "No, I should be more inclined to
think that she has got in touch with some of these
diviners&mdash;people who claim to be able to locate treasure by
a photograph of the place."</p>

<p>There was a short silence.</p>

<p>"That's possible!" Grace spoke in the tone of one who is shown
the right word for the Crossword. "I never thought of anything so
simple! But if so, then she was still interested in that
immediately after Anthony died! I always told you that she didn't
care for him, you know."</p>

<p>"Poor Anthony," Doris said with a gesture of pity. "Your eyes
were sharper than mine. He loved her so much that I suppose I
took it for granted that she loved him too. <i>He</i> never had
any doubts about it."</p>

<p>"Possibly he had at the end," Grace said under her breath. She
broke off as Doris interrupted to ask if she was sure that
Olive's self-imposed duty as postman to the rectory was now a
thing of the past.</p>

<p>"Oh, absolutely." Grace spoke with certainty. "And I let
Bowles see that it must never happen again. He assured me, and
he's a truthful old thing, that it hadn't happened for a
fortnight past."</p>

<p>There was silence in the room after that. Then Grace rose.</p>

<p>"I'm glad I told you about it. I meant to at once last night.
And your idea of diviners really does explain Olive's actions.
But what a heart she must have&mdash;apart from Anthony, here's
poor John hardly dead&mdash;to be able to go into his study and
hunt about in it&mdash;what was that for, do you suppose?"</p>

<p>Doris made a weary gesture. "Notes on some of his talks of
Anthony's grandfather. Or, more likely, plans of The Causeway
foundations. John drew some at the time he was interested in
tracing the old manor's outbuildings."</p>

<p>She stopped as Fraser came in.</p>

<p>The Chief Constable asked Pointer and Shilling to dine with
him that Monday night.</p>

<p>The talk turned exclusively on the rectory puzzle. Ireton
fortunately for himself had an unimpeachable alibi for yesterday
afternoon and evening. He <i>and</i> his family had gone by train
to some relatives at four o'clock, and had only returned at nine
this morning. He could not have tampered with the tray, for there
had been a Cinderella dance on that had lasted till midnight, and
Mr. Ireton had danced indefatigably. That settled, Pointer told
about the odd little affair of the necklace that belonged to Lady
Revell.</p>

<p>Weir-Opie held up a hand.</p>

<p>"I've had to spend a precious half-hour calming her down," he
said, "not that there was much that I could do. Of course, Lady
Revell is quite above suspicion, I should say&mdash;quite! And
her story of having left it in the study on a previous visit
explains it, eh?"</p>

<p>Pointer had been talking to Fraser, and the butler had scoffed
at the idea that anything had lain for over twenty-four hours
undetected behind the window-seat. And the lack of dust bore this
out.</p>

<p>"Umph&mdash;odd," Weir-Opie allowed, when this was explained,
"but, as I say, I really can't see Lady Revell murdering Avery,
or having to. Her life is too well known, even before her
marriage, for her to have any black secrets, I feel sure. That
some one else helped themselves to that necklace, and wore it
yesterday to the rectory is more likely&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jolly careless thing to do, sir," Shilling put in, "with a
striking thing like that."</p>

<p>"True, but one must account for its presence somehow...Odd..."
and like good Catholics at Meditation, the three sat silent for
several minutes considering the one necklace certainly found, and
the one necklace possibly missing.</p>

<p>"And what did you think of the Gartsides?" Weir-Opie asked,
coming up out of the deeps.</p>

<p>"They seemed to me rather uneasy, sir," Pointer said, and
proceeded to pass on what little he had learnt from them, and
from Merton, about the articles which they had chosen for their
legacy. "But there's one thing they didn't tell me, of which I
feel as sure as Merton seems to, and that is that neither brother
nor sister believe for a moment that Mr. Revell really went home
because of a toothache," Pointer said with assurance.</p>

<p>"Do you think they knew the real reason then, whatever it
was?" Weir-Opie asked instantly. "Or is Merton right&mdash;and
did Anthony take to flight?"</p>

<p>"There's one thing, sir. The post had evidently reached them
before Mr. Revell spoke to them on Thursday morning, because Miss
Gartside said that she was reading a letter that had just come,
when Mr. Revell stepped into the sitting-room to say that he must
leave them till the following afternoon, so that Mr. Revell could
have received a letter that morning."</p>

<p>"I asked them that very question before the inquest, and both
said they knew of none," Shilling said instantly.</p>

<p>"Probably they didn't <i>know,"</i> Pointer agreed. "There may
even have been none, if Merton is right in thinking that it was
something to do with Miss Gartside. But Mr. Revell's going to his
drawing-room at 'that hour of night strongly suggests a
rendezvous."</p>

<p>"Yes, we got that far," Weir-Opie nodded, "but we found no
proofs. Whereas the probabilities are that after killing Revell
and finding that the stamps they were after weren't at The
Causeway&mdash;he hadn't been searched as we told you&mdash;the
murderer, or murderers, knew about the list, and, recognising it
in the rector's hands in church on Sunday decided that it must be
secured and destroyed after silencing him."</p>

<p>"In short, they murdered the rector, took the stamps, and
didn't get the list," summed up Shilling who liked things put
briefly, no matter what had to be left out. "Did you hear
anything about that wonderful Sicilian stamp from Sir Hubert
Witson, sir?"</p>

<p>Weir-Opie looked at him. "Yes," he said finally. "Oh, yes. I
wish he had a better alibi for both the times we're interested
in, he talked so ravenously about it. Said he had been allowed to
see a specimen once in his life in Berlin at the Postal Museum
there. It isn't listed among the exhibits, but is kept in the
director's private room, and apparently, from the way Witson went
on, is chained to the director day and night. I didn't mention it
to him as any motive for Avery's death, naturally&mdash;"</p>

<p>Both his listeners nodded. It had been agreed between them
that, until they learnt that that particular stamp had been
located, there must be the greatest secrecy observed about
it.</p>

<p>"So Sir Hubert knew about such a stamp," said Shilling,
sticking to his point.</p>

<p>Weir-Opie nodded.</p>

<p>"Did he know about Mr. Revell's owning any Sicilian stamps?"
Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"He did. Moreover, Sir Hubert himself put forward a chat on
stamps as the reason for the rector's late call on him day before
yesterday&mdash;Saturday. He said that Mr. Avery had rung him up
on Saturday afternoon and said that he had had a good many small
gifts of stamps made him lately which were now growing quite
bulky, and thought it might be as well to consult such a well-known
expert about their value and classification. He wanted to
start a boys' stamp exchange and sale with a view to rendering
some of his clubs more nearly self-supporting. Everybody around
here knows it was one of the rector's many dreams that in time
his boys might be able to run their clubs entirely unaided. Sir
Hubert asked him to drop in at five o'clock on Monday afternoon,
but had to phone up later, about half-past eight, and ask him to
come then, as he feared trouble with his eyes which might make it
impossible for him to inspect the stamps on the Monday. As a
matter of fact his eyes are better to-day, he told me," went on
Weir-Opie, "but he had had them bad once, and got nervous."</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Avery bring the stamps?" Shilling asked.</p>

<p>"Witson says not. Witson says he only wanted some general
information about how such a scheme might be started. But he
mentioned the Sicilian stamps among many others, and Witson says
he told him about this particular stamp&mdash;Witson, by the way,
thinks a well-preserved one would be cheap at six thousand. The
rector, according to Witson, said that he was afraid his Sicilian
stamps contained nothing so thrilling, but he would look at the
list which Revell had sent with them."</p>

<p>There was a short silence after the Chief Constable had
finished.</p>

<p>"So Sir Hubert Witson rang up the rector last night around
half-past eight. That much of course will be on record," Pointer
said.</p>

<p>"And where was Sir Hubert last night, sir?" asked the
superintendent.</p>

<p>"Again in his bed, Shilling," Weir-Opie said in his dry tone.
"You always seem to think it a most suspicious place for people
to be found, I know. But I will remind you that I have exactly
the same alibi for last night. Presumably Pointer here has no
better. And what about yourself?"</p>

<p>Shilling laughed outright. Then his face sobered. "So he knew
there was a list of those stamps to be seen," he muttered.</p>

<p>Pointer looked up. "The list which may have contained the name
of a very valuable stamp might explain the rector's murder, and
the search of his study&mdash;the library wasn't searched at
all&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Because he wouldn't keep anything of a secular kind in
there," threw in Weir-Opie.</p>

<p>Pointer nodded. He understood as much.</p>

<p>"But," he went on slowly, "I think a message must have
accompanied it to cause the rector to stare at it as he did on
Sunday in the pulpit, and above all to preach such a sermon as he
did."</p>

<p>"Why, the sight of the stamp on the list was surely
sufficient?" replied Shilling, surprised.</p>

<p>"Why should a message have had to accompany the list?"
Weir-Opie said, passing the liqueur brandy.</p>

<p>"Because on turning it over in my mind, sir, I don't see how
Mr. Avery could so instantly appreciate the significance of that
stamp on the list, supposing it was there. I mean "&mdash;Pointer
found it hard to put his growing dissatisfaction into
words&mdash;"say I am the rector. I open my Bible, having given
out my text with my mind full of my sermon. Opening out my notes,
I see that, by mistake, I have picked up a list of stamps
instead. I doubt if I would more than glance at the paper. I
don't think I would carefully read the list through to the
end."</p>

<p>"Ah, but if the valuable one happened to be first on the
list!" Weir-Opie objected.</p>

<p>"Even so, sir, even if I saw on it one I knew to be very
valuable, I don't think I would connect that stamp's presence
with the month-old death of the giver, a death moreover which was
thought to be accidental. I don't say that a detective who was
certain that Revell had been murdered might not have seen it in
that light. But Mr. Avery, with the first sentence of his sermon
already half spoken?"</p>

<p>"I see," said Weir-Opie, twirling his cigar round and round
like a screw.</p>

<p>And an answering "I see," came from Shilling who laid down the
matches. Both voices suggested the opposite.</p>

<p>"Granted it was the list of stamps that he took out of his
Bible, and granted even that on it was the name of a very
valuable one indeed, there must have been more than that, to have
affected the rector as it did. Must have been."</p>

<p>Pointer spoke with certainty. "Even assuming both those first
premises to be true, I feel more and more sure that some message
must have been written as well."</p>

<p>"Such as 'Showed these stamps to Witson the other day,' eh,
sir?" Shilling cast a look at the Chief Constable.</p>

<p>"Or 'Byrd doesn't think them valuable,'" Weir-Opie lit his
cigar. "You always tried to connect Byrd with Revell's death,
Shilling, only he too claimed to have been in his bed that
night."</p>

<p>Pointer did not appear struck with the two suggestions.</p>

<p>"The rector hadn't time in the pulpit to think things over,
sir, and put two and two together."</p>

<p>"He stood a long minute with eyes shut after he saw that
paper," Weir-Opie reminded the Chief Inspector. "I thought he was
praying. He may have been thinking back instead. He was a very
quick-witted man, remember, with a finely-trained, really good
brain. You think some incriminating&mdash;for the
murderer&mdash;message accompanied the list... umph..."</p>

<p>"I do, and yet again there are difficulties," Pointer said
finally, lighting up, "about a message accompanying the
list."</p>

<p>"That's it!" Weir-Opie liked to chaff Pointer. "That's it!
First throw us a rope. Then chop it in two. Then boggle about
letting us have even half of it!"</p>

<p>Pointer laughed.</p>

<p>"What difficulties are there about Mr. Revell having written a
very suggestive message on the same page as the list?" Shilling
wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Why, the paper was kept in the open-topped jar. Again,
granted that the rector had never read it, and that's a lot to
grant seeing that he had had it for nearly a month&mdash;What
about Mr. Byrd? He saw the list, so if there was a message he
must have seen it too. But he left it apparently."</p>

<p>"True, there is that!" came in tones almost of disappointment
from the Chief Constable.</p>

<p>"The butler and other servants could have seen it, had they
wanted to," Pointer continued, "so that whatever it contained
that so appalled the rector on Sunday must have been very
inconspicuous. Then why did it burst on him, when he read it,
like a horrible floodlight&mdash;for it did."</p>

<p>"Could he have learnt something on the way to church which
altered things?" wondered Weir-Opie, thoroughly roused. "But, no,
Colonel Grenville is one of his churchwardens, and I had a word
with him to-day. He walked into the vestry with him&mdash;they
were talking about some repairs, and he said that the rector was
more cheery than he had seen him since Revell's death, which had
been a frightful shock to him, as to every one. Though not within
a thousand miles of the shock which his own death is to all of us
who ever met him," added Weir-Opie under his breath, "for to know
Avery was to love him."</p>

<p>"I confess, sir," Pointer said after a silence, "that I keep
turning and twisting the possibilities of that folded paper over
and over, and so far quite fruitlessly." He did not add that he
was not one of those men who have to have things told to them
before they "detect" them. Pointer could reason, and very far
indeed at times his reasoning had brought him. He had controlled
imagination, without which the cleverest clues are but as useless
stones.</p>

<p>And there was another difficulty too about the missing jar,
but he did not mention it. It was the most obvious one, though
neither the Chief Constable nor his superintendent had yet
referred to it.</p>

<p>"There's no proving where any one was that Thursday night Mr.
Revell was killed," broke in Shilling. "Even if we had anything
on which to hang our suspicions&mdash;which we haven't."</p>

<p>"Or had any suspicions to hang on anything if we had it,"
amended Weir-Opie dryly.</p>

<p>"Any one else besides Miss Hill in love with Mr. Revell?"
Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"He was a bit of a flirt," Weir-Opie said cautiously, "as was
only natural. Lady Witson's name has been linked with his a good
bit. She's a fast young woman. Sir Hubert's a good deal older
than she is, and as jealous as only elderly and very ugly men can
be. As to an alibi on the night of Revell's death&mdash;none. And
only half an hour's walk from his house to The Causeway. And he's
an active walker."</p>

<p>"Friend of Mr. Revell's?"</p>

<p>"They were on speaking terms, but nothing warmer."</p>

<p>"Whoever shot him, if it wasn't an accident, would have been a
supposed friend, one would think," Pointer said. "Some one who
could pick up that revolver without causing any suspicion in Mr.
Revell's mind."</p>

<p>"Then there's Mrs. Green," put in Shilling. And Pointer was
now told all the local gossip about the artist.</p>

<p>Weir-Opie modified the account by saying, "I don't know, no
one will ever know how much truth there is in the story of her
infatuation. His mother believes it, I think, whereas the rector
didn't. And I'm bound to say that Mr. Avery was a very shrewd
man. Very hard to fob off with a lie. And there's this on Mrs.
Green's side, the servants at The Causeway swear that there was
nothing 'wrong'&mdash;their word&mdash;between her and Revell.
And if they didn't think so, there wasn't. Trust house servants
to know."</p>

<p>Pointer did not stay late after dinner. Weir-Opie and Shilling
had many other things to discuss, and he had brought away with
him to read to-night the unfinished chapters of the rector's
<i>Notes on Saint Paul.</i> He wanted to hear, as it were, the
dead man talking. It kept him awake. Here was detection at its
subtlest and best. Like a man bearing a strong light, the rector
had moved through his texts, casting that light now forwards now
backwards along the path which he had marked out, and Pointer
thought that no Scotland Yard sleuth could better him in his
amazing skill in putting the hidden two and two together into the
right four. Logic and reasoning this of the highest. Pointer
turned out his light with a sigh for the brain lost to the
world.</p>

<p>He would very much have liked to hear Mr. Avery's explanation
of his own end. Which would mean the truth about the missing
stamps, the necklace and, above all, the folded paper that he had
taken out of his Bible yesterday morning.

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11"></a>CHAPTER ELEVEN</h2>

<p class="first">THE inquest on the rector was next morning. As he
was walking from the police station to it, Pointer heard his name
called. A smart car was stopping beside him. A young woman jumped
out, and waved to the chauffeur to go on.</p>

<p>"You're the bogey man, aren't you," she said with a display of
white teeth. "The Major was talking about you to me. I'm Lady
Witson."</p>

<p>Pointer saw a young woman on the right side of thirty, very
tall, very thin, with a dress that fitted her as its last leaf
does a cigar. She was, if not pretty, well made up, very up to
date. He was particularly interested in her. One of Shilling's
men had learnt last night that there had been a tremendous
quarrel between Sir Hubert and his wife on Saturday, and that the
servants all believed the rector's call to have been made for the
purpose of reasoning with Lady Witson who, according to them, had
taken very ostentatiously to drink since Anthony Revell's death,
with whom all the servants believed she had been carrying on a
wild flirtation. Both flirtation and drinking, according to them,
arose not so much from affection, as from a hope that Sir Hubert
if really alarmed would leave The Towers and go back at once to
London where Eva-May Witson longed to be.</p>

<p>Pointer thought that Lady Witson looked capable of anything
that would further her own plans. The servants had told
Shilling's inquirer that they had heard the name of Revell called
out once during the half an hour's talk that the rector had had
with husband and wife. It had been apparently screamed at her
husband by Lady Witson. The maid who had passed on most of this
information, if it could be called that, had heard the rector
call her firmly to order, as though she had said something that
was unpardonable, but the girl claimed that she had shrilled the
name again and again before rushing in hysterics&mdash;"put-on
ones," in her opinion&mdash;from the room.</p>

<p>"I hear that Miss Hill has not been called as a witness by the
Coroner," Lady Witson said now in a very sharp nasal voice.</p>

<p>"I suppose the Coroner thought that this second death coming
so soon after her own personal loss would have been a great shock
to her," Pointer suggested.</p>

<p>Lady Witson gave the little screech that she considered a
laugh. "A great personal loss it was indeed!" There was mockery
in her tone. "If he hadn't had that accident she would have lost
him just the same. Anthony Revell never really intended to marry
Olive Hill! What happened was that she misunderstood, or
pretended to misunderstand, something pretty he said to her, and
the rector came in, and Olive asked for his blessing, and there
was poor Anthony in the net And all for the sake of one of his
pretty speeches. Once in, he was making the best of it, but that
was really why he went rock-climbing for a fortnight. He
intended, he told me himself, to write her a most regretful
letter, and an explanatory one to the rector, and be
off&mdash;free&mdash;unfettered. That was why she hasn't a ring.
He was going to get free&mdash;from a distance. He would have
been quite ready to flirt with her, of course, but she wanted
marriage, equally of course. Poor thing!"</p>

<p>"That's very interesting," Pointer said pleasantly, "and you
had it from Mr. Revell himself?"</p>

<p>She nodded importantly, and repeatedly, before she signed to a
passing friend in a car, and jumped in. So she had only got down
from her own car to be spiteful.</p>

<p>Yet Pointer thought that in the evident spite lay a possible
truth. He himself had wondered whether the engagement of Olive
Hill and Anthony Revell might not have been engineered by the
young woman. She struck him as essentially an intriguer. But even
if things had happened as Lady Witson had just suggested, that
would neither account for the shooting of Revell, supposing it
not to have been accidental, nor for the murder of the
rector.</p>

<p>The Chief Constable's car stopped for Pointer, who reported
the words of Lady Witson. The Chief Constable made a face.</p>

<p>"Kind of thing she would say," he muttered. "Is she right?
Possibly. Revell loved a peaceful life beyond even the love of
women. Or else he had a real attachment&mdash;it's whispered-by
some gossips that it was to this same Lady Witson&mdash;for a
couple of years before Miss Hill ever appeared on the scene.
There was a lot of gossip about it, but some thought that it was
started by the lady herself."</p>

<p>"Nothing more likely, I should think," Pointer said with a
faint smile. "Anything rather than be ignored is her motto, I
fancy."</p>

<p>"There's even a whisper or two beginning to circulate about
the night young Revell was shot. Shilling's ears, stretched like
drums, have caught it."</p>

<p>Pointer's expression did not change, but the quality of his
interest did.</p>

<p>"To the effect that Lady Witson was seen going, or
coming&mdash;one whisper has it one way, one another&mdash;from
The Causeway the night Revell returned home. This would explain
his return with never a word to his servant or any of his old
friends, we all know. But she didn't shoot him!" and the Chief
Constable laughed. "She can't shoot, to begin with. Shilling
found that out at once. And neither was there any reason for it.
She's not the intense kind. I think she's quite fond of her
husband really, but thinks he needs a little rousing now and
then. I don't say she's wrong. Certainly he never neglects her as
he did his first wife. Some men have to feel insecure before they
value anything."</p>

<p>"Do you think the rector could have got to hear of the gossip
about Lady Witson being there that night?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"The last man to learn of it, I should say," was the opinion
of the Chief Constable. "And it's only just beginning to spread.
No one knows where from, of course."</p>

<p>Pointer was thinking.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked the other as he said nothing. "What do you think
of her as the writer of a possible letter giving Revell a
rendezvous?"</p>

<p>"I'm wondering how Lady Witson could have induced Mr. Revell
to give up two whole days out of a fortnight's climbing. He lost
Thursday getting back here, he would have had to lose Friday
returning to Derbyshire."</p>

<p>"Yes, and the Gartsides could only stay the two weeks.
Saturday&mdash;Saturday&mdash;Saturday," Shilling threw in. "He's
a very junior clerk at Lloyds, and couldn't possibly get his
holiday extended."</p>

<p>"And generally one chooses some extra good climb to end
with"&mdash;Pointer was a great climber&mdash;"something to
stretch to the last possible minute. By leaving on Thursday,
Revell practically closed the expedition. Possibly there was bad
feeling between him and the Gartsides&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We could learn of none. Shilling here was very keen on
finding that out at once," said Weir-Opie.</p>

<p>"Certainly unless there was trouble between them, or unless
Miss Gartside frightened him home, if Lady Witson could get him
to so cut short the trip, she must have had a very strong reason
to give him. Something very compelling&mdash;Would Sir Hubert be
likely to start divorce proceedings easily?"</p>

<p>"Ah! He's as jealous as a Turk. But as to divorce&mdash;I
dunno."</p>

<p>"One would have expected that only Miss Hill would have had
the power to get him to come back like that," Pointer was eyeing
his polished shoe tips.</p>

<p>"Lady Witson is quite capable of suggesting that she was in a
fearful hole if by saying so she could stir up Revell or her
husband." Weir-Opie's tone did not suggest any great amount of
affection for the lady. "She's a curious type. Must have things
swirling around her. Seems to be meat and drink to her."</p>

<p>"Let's hope that the rector wasn't poisoned for want of a
thrill," Pointer said dryly, and the other agreed. They were by
now at the schoolhouse where the inquest was to be held.
Weir-Opie promptly went on ahead for a word with the Coroner.</p>

<p>The inquest was crowded. Pointer himself was present
throughout, for there was the one obvious point connected with
the missing yellow jar which still puzzled him extremely, and
which he hoped might be cleared up at it.</p>

<p>Also, in a murder case, the faces of the people listening to
the evidence always interested him. The first person at which he
glanced held his eye for a different reason. It was the, as yet,
unidentified woman whom on Sunday in church the rector's sermon
had so shaken. A question to Shilling nearby, and he learnt that,
as he thought, she was Mrs. Green. An interesting but ravaged
face, Pointer had thought it in church the day before yesterday,
now it bore still more marks of grief, yet he had been given to
understand that the rector was practically a stranger to her.
Queer.</p>

<p>The inquest began.</p>

<p>The Coroner, who had been told that the police wanted all
possible information, did his best to ferret out any shreds.</p>

<p>Sir Hubert Witson, a large fat man with sleepy eyes, was
called first after the police and medical evidence. He said that
the rector called to see him on Saturday evening. Their talk had
only to do with a stamps "sale and exchange" for some boys'
clubs. The rector had seemed quite his usual self.</p>

<p>Witson had a ruthless and mean face, Pointer thought.
Superficially good-natured up to a point, but capable of being a
very nasty customer once that point were passed. Pointer thought
he was telling the truth, as far as it went, but he thought him
very determined that it should not go far.</p>

<p>The Coroner next called Lady Witson for a moment. She entirely
supported her husband's statement that the rector had merely
looked in for a word about his clubs, and bore out unhesitatingly
his account of the short chat on stamps that had followed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Richard Avery was called, and described the tray that had
been sent in as so often before to the rector on Sunday night. As
to the toadstools, she went into that point very carefully and
clearly. The rector, she said, was extremely careful about the
extract. She went on to repeat what she had already told the
police about having gone into the library after her friends had
left the house on Sunday evening, and the help in looking up some
references that her brother-in-law had asked of her. She had
heard his voice in the study, the room below her bedroom, much
later&mdash;around half-past eleven&mdash;when she put out her
reading-lamp and fell asleep. She had thought at the time that he
was reading a sentence aloud to himself. His voice had sounded
quite calm, but she had herself been very sleepy at the time.</p>

<p>Lady Revell, when called, said that owing to her headache she
had not walked over to the rectory on Sunday evening as she had
at first intended, but had taken a headache powder and gone to
bed instead. As to her necklace found under the window seat, she
gave the same explanation to the Coroner as to Pointer. The
lighter necklace had not been found. Possibly indeed she had lost
it on Sunday coming back from church. She had stayed in her room
Sunday afternoon writing letters and feeling very much under the
weather, and it now looked to her as though she had only taken it
for granted that she had laid it on her dressing-table that
night.</p>

<p>The inquest went on. Fraser, Mr. Ireton, servants, no one
seemed to have anything new to say.</p>

<p>The Coroner finally adjourned for a fortnight, after stressing
the fact that owing to the door that led out from the fernery
into the garden, any outsider could have been admitted, or for
that matter could, theoretically at least, have slipped in on
Sunday evening after the tray was brought into the study, and
have transferred some of the poisonous toadstool extract to the
mushroom ketchup bottle. This could have been done, even with the
rector sitting writing in the inner room, for the door between
was generally shut, and when deep in his work, he was deaf to
what went on around him.</p>

<p>Pointer went for a walk when the proceedings were over. Why
had the orange jar been taken away from the rectory study? The
inquest had not in the least solved that question. The chief
objection to its disappearance did not seem to have occurred to
the Major or to Shilling. But Pointer placed himself in the
position of the criminal. Granted that he was after the stamps,
that he had missed them before when he shot Revell, that he would
therefore be all out not to go away empty-handed after a second
murder, why should he take away the china jar as well as the
stamps? It was roughly a hand high and a span across the top. The
lid was china too. The jar had every fault from the criminal's
point of view. It was heavy. It was awkward to carry safely. It
was extremely smooth. It was noisy to put down anywhere. It was
difficult to hide, impossibly so on the person. It was breakable,
and an accident might happen at some most inconvenient time and
place. It was most easily identifiable, even at a glance. So much
so, that Pointer had at first expected to find it "planted"
somewhere. But so far it had not turned up. It seemed to have
genuinely accompanied the stamps, and Pointer could not
understand why. The thing had no especially valuable qualities of
air or water-tightness to compensate for its many disadvantages.
The stamps were easily taken out. Then why want the cumbersome
china jar? What reason had constrained the murderer, the quite
averagely clever murderer, to put up with all its drawbacks?
Pointer worried at the reason, which eluded him as much now, as
on the first moment of learning of the jar's disappearance. It
did not make sense. The stamps&mdash;yes. But the jar&mdash;no! A
dozen times over, no!</p>

<p>He went to his bed still trying in his mind every possible
combination of circumstances which would explain the taking of
that jar. The strangest small incident&mdash;to his
mind&mdash;which the case presented, became the most
incomprehensible. It was devoid of all reason, as far as he could
see, and Chief Inspector Pointer saw further than most men, as
well as more quickly and more clearly. For an hour he lay awake
thinking, and at last he became convinced that there was no
reason behind its absence from the study mantel. That meant that
its taking was accidental, caused by some unplanned incident. Had
it fallen and been broken in taking it hurriedly off the mantel
when the stamps had been stolen after the death of the rector?
Not a speck of broken china remained. Under the circumstances it
must have taken nerve to have so picked up every particle in that
room...Could there be any reason for so carefully hiding the jar
if it had been broken? Suddenly he saw one.</p>

<p>The rector lay on his couch which faced obliquely towards
fireplace and window. That necklace was found under the window-sill!
What if the rector, discovering that no bell rang, that his
door was locked, knowing that the windows were too stiff for him
to open, had made a last effort to summon help by flinging the
necklace at the window to break it? And suppose the necklace to
have been lying on the small occasional table that stood near
him? In his weakness, lying on his side, he might easily have hit
the china jar instead...and the murderer, wanting to conceal the
fact that the bells were put out of order, that the doors had
been locked, would feel that broken jar to be far too much of a
clue to leave it lying in bits on the floor. The necklace had
dropped out of sight, but the jar would be buried as near as
possible to the garden door&mdash;a trowel and small hand-rake
lay on the mushroom table.</p>

<p>He walked swiftly to the rectory, and would have made for the
strip of garden outside the fernery door, but for Grace Avery,
who, a pile of correspondence beside her on the lawn, sat near it
behind a spur of rhododendrons, busily reading, and tearing up
papers.</p>

<p>"These are some old papers of last year from my brother's
attic store-room," she explained. "They must be gone through, of
course. So far I have come on nothing in the least interesting,
only old receipts and so on, appeals for help, club
reports&mdash;that sort of thing. But they must be attended to.
There's another couple of hours' work in this lot alone. Tell me,
Mr. Pointer, you don't <i>really</i> think that any one intended
to poison my brother, do you? It's incredible that any one could
want to harm him! Some accident&mdash;yes. Though that's hard
enough to explain, but not intention?"</p>

<p>So long as it seemed as though the sister had nothing to do
with the brother's death, Major Weir-Opie thought that there was
no reason to tell her of the police certainty of foul play. She,
supposedly innocent, would help them as much as she could,
without that dreadful knowledge to grieve her still deeper. Yet
there was the question of danger. The very grave question. A
poisoner undetected is like a deadly snake lying hidden in the
grass. One incautious step, and another death may be the result.
Pointer therefore contented himself with saying that the whole
affair was most mysterious, and that until more was known, it was
impossible to rule out any possibility, or any motive for that
possibility.</p>

<p>"Any possibility. Any motive..." she repeated slowly. "You
really think that one shouldn't shut out any quite impossible
seeming motive?" Her hands had fallen back inert on her lap, her
eyes were wide and looked full of trouble.</p>

<p>"Most certainly not," he said at once and turned to her,
waiting. But she said nothing more, only twisted her rings round
and round on her fingers.</p>

<p>"If you can think of anything however fantastic or far-fetched,
please tell it me," he said then, but she drew a deep
breath and shook her head.</p>

<p>"I don't know of anything whatever," she said finally, "or of
course I would tell you! Of course I would!"</p>

<p>Seeing that at the moment Grace had no intention of confiding
in him, supposing she had anything to confide, Pointer left her
to get on with her brother's papers.</p>

<p>But he stepped in for a word with Fraser. Possibly he could,
through him, get at what was troubling Miss Avery.</p>

<p>As it happened, the butler met him with very much the same
sort of question that Grace had, though couched in different
words, and received virtually the same reply.</p>

<p>"We feel sure," Pointer then added, "that there are a lot of
apparent trifles which, if we knew of them, might lead to some
definite decision. And it's most uncomfortable for every one, as
long as we aren't sure of what really did happen to the
rector."</p>

<p>"Uncomfortable,' I don't mind that," Fraser said grimly. "What
I mind is the thought of any one murdering the rector and getting
away with it. Well, look here, Mr. Chief Inspector, what
about&mdash;for one trifle&mdash;asking Miss Olive what made her
listen at the study door twice over on Sunday night as she did.
Opened it twice noiselessly as a fly, put a foot in, heard
something, and closed it just as silently. Mrs. Richard had just
gone to bed, it was gone half-past ten by then. I asked her
whether she wanted anything; I thought perhaps she didn't like to
disturb the master in the library, and was listening to hear if
he was still in there. She jumped as though I had pinched her,
and fairly scuttled up the stairs saying something about a book
she had wanted but which didn't matter and thanking me for my
offer. And Miss Olive isn't one of your thanking sort! Her face,
too, looked as though I had given her a rare fright. Funny little
trifle that, ain't it, sir? I went off to bed then, but I've
wondered since&mdash;what she really was after."</p>

<p>"Did <i>you</i> hear anything from inside the room?" Pointer
asked.</p>

<p>"Just the rector walking up and down his study very slowly as
though deep in thought."</p>

<p>"I suppose he would often do that?"</p>

<p>"Never knew him to do it before, sir. In the library, yes, now
and then. But I never heard him do it before in the
study&mdash;when alone. No, I never heard him do it there."</p>

<p>"And you think that Miss Olive?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what to think, sir, and that's a fact. It was
her air&mdash;her manner&mdash;that was so odd. Keyed-up
and&mdash;well&mdash;I should call it desperate."</p>

<p>Further questions added nothing to this account. "And then,
there's one more trifle, sir, about another lady altogether. The
gardener says that he saw Mrs. Green closing our main gate very
carefully behind her latish on Sunday night. About eleven he puts
the time at. Mrs. Green has never called here. If she came to the
house it was the first time. Higgins always goes home past the
front gate."</p>

<p>Fraser was wanted and Pointer stood reflecting on what he had
just heard. Miss Hill at the study door...Mrs. Green seen leaving
the rectory garden...Any collusion between the two women seemed
unlikely. But you never knew...He turned.</p>

<p>Olive Hill was coming down the stairs with some letters in her
hand.</p>

<p>He had his note-book out, and seemed to be entering some
detail.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Hill," he turned as though glad to see her. "I'm
filling in Sunday night's time-table. Mrs. Richard Avery left the
study around half-past ten, you were seen at the study door
afterwards going in&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," she said instantly, "certainly not! Or I would have told
you. I wanted a book from the shelves. But the rector was there,
and I didn't like to disturb him. So after I tried twice and
heard him moving about each time, I gave it up as a bad job."</p>

<p>Pointer thanked her, wrote in the details as given by her, and
went on out again. Round by the side door Grace still sat in
front of a garden table. But she was not looking at papers. Her
head leaning on one hand, a characteristic pose, she was idly
rolling a pencil along the table edge.</p>

<p>She looked up. "About trifles "&mdash;she began&mdash;"you
ought to ask Mrs. Richard, when she comes back, whose voice it
was that she heard speaking to the rector close on midnight."</p>

<p>Mrs. Richard Avery was out at the moment.</p>

<p>Pointer did not remind her that Doris had said that she had
heard no voice but the rector's own. "You think she recognised
the voice?"</p>

<p>"I do," Grace said firmly. "But I think she counted on the
person she heard coming forward and telling you about it
herself."

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12"></a>CHAPTER TWELVE</h2>

<p class="first">POINTER decided to try that night for the pieces
of the orange china jar which he thought might have been broken
by the dying rector, and buried by his murderer. Meanwhile, he
lit a pipe and went for a brisk walk. That an extremely valuable
stamp was in the envelope given by Revell to the rector, was of
course possible, and if so, could not be disregarded as a
possible motive for Revell's, and for the rector's murder. He ran
again over the names of those who had, according to Fraser, seen
the stamps and the list. He had had a word with Byrd about them,
and the man had seemed quite at his ease as he said that, even if
missing, they were of no value except to some one beginning a
collection.</p>

<p>But Pointer was not satisfied with the stamp theory, though it
could not be disregarded. He wanted something that would explain
the return of Revell to his home, and his own death that night,
and then another murder&mdash;that of the rector after an
interval of four weeks. And which would explain also the folded
paper, or rather, the sermon which Mr. Avery had preached after
seeing the paper.</p>

<p>Leaving stamps entirely alone for, the moment, what other line
of reasoning was there that might lead to the right answer?</p>

<p>Jealousy? Was that the answer to the death of Revell and was
some discovery of the identity of the murderer the reason for the
rector's death and the accompanying oddities? Sir Hubert Witson
was a jealous man from the look of him...there was gossip about
his wife and Revell...she had called out Revell's name during the
quarrel which was apparently the real cause of the rector's visit
to The Towers last Saturday night...</p>

<p>Something like a cold flame was burning in Pointer's mind.
Clear and shining it illuminated whatever he placed before it. A
jealous man&mdash;but would a jealous man summon Revell home,
back to his own neighbourhood? Hardly. But the woman might. If
frightened. Or if desirous of a last exercise of power. Certainly
a summons from her&mdash;a letter from her&mdash;something made
the flame leap a little higher. A letter written to Revell and
found by the rector? But after four weeks? And then the flame
played on Revell's car used by the rector for the first time late
on Saturday. What about a letter written to Revell summoning him
home most urgently, dropped by him in the car, no, rather, folded
by him, which had inadvertently slipped down between two
cushions? Pointer saw the rector dropping his matches&mdash;or
spectacles&mdash;groping for them&mdash;picking them up, and the
folded paper as well, putting the latter in the pocket out of
which he thought that it had fallen, the pocket where he carried
his notes for his sermon. He saw Mr. Avery when he got home,
laying the folded paper in his Bible, opening it out next morning
in the pulpit, recognising the writing, reading some damnable
words which would be to him like a flash of lightning showing a
terrible landscape. Yes, a letter then&mdash;written by a woman,
not by a man. But not necessarily by Lady Witson. There were
other women whose names had been linked with Revell's, and if it
was true that Revell had not let Olive know of his return, was it
not likely that her name had been used as a bait? The flame was
shining very clearly now. Or was it Olive herself? A dreadful
sequence would follow this, if a fact...And it was possible,
except that she seemed to gain nothing but, on the contrary, to
lose so immensely by Revell's death. But Shilling's man had heard
her say to Byrd in a frantic whisper that she had never intended
to marry Revell. The man had missed much of the talk between the
two, but, those words had reached him. If that were really so
then Olive might not have lost anything she valued...But to
commit a murder there must be a tremendous incentive, an
overwhelming gratification of some passion of hate or jealousy or
revenge or greed. The flame failed to light on any such motive in
Olive Hill, according to the facts as known so far. But it was
just after her engagement to Revell that he died&mdash;just when,
in other words, another woman would have learnt that he was lost
to her. Fury and revenge...And what if that other woman had used
Olive as a screen? Here the flame played on the sermon as though
it were print, and certain passages stood out clearer than
others. Some one was to come forward&mdash;some one was to speak
up&mdash;the rector would not, Pointer thought, have the criminal
in his mind's eye, but an appeal to the writer of a letter
summoning Revell to a midnight meeting would fit the sermon. A
letter in which, moreover, it had been made to appear without
giving any name, as though some one, other than the writer wanted
to speak to Revell.</p>

<p>Yes, that would fit. And Olive, as that "some one" would fit
too, for Revell would have hastened back for her&mdash;to her.
She had not lunched or dined at the rectory on Sunday, but gone
for a long walk immediately after church, doing without lunch,
according to her own statement, and taking tea at a verified
place quite four hours' walk away.</p>

<p>She had come back about a quarter to nine, and had refused any
dinner. Had Olive been named directly in the letter, Pointer
believed that the rector would have wanted to see her at once.
Apparently he had not done so. From all his actions on Sunday it
looked to Pointer as though Mr. Avery had received some message
from the writer of the letter putting off the crucial moment of
discussion very likely till the next day&mdash;Monday. Of the
three women in the household, any of them could have stepped in
for long enough to do this. Outside of the rectory, of the women
who interested Pointer, Lady Witson, Mrs. Green and Miss Gartside
could all have had the opportunity, for the rector was out all
afternoon.</p>

<p>When it was dusk, Pointer had a careful look at the little
stretch of shrubs and periwinkle in question, and when it was
quite dark he strapped his torch on his head and began to use the
little garden fork lying on the table near the gas-ring. He found
what he was after almost at once. Piece by piece he laid the
orange tinted china fragments out on to his newspaper. He dug on
with added care, for there was the possibility of finding a
buried envelope of stamps. For if jealousy was the motive that
had killed Revell, and the rector had died lest he should give
the murderer up, and if Avery had smashed the jar in an effort to
break the window, then the stamps, like the jar, might stand for
absolutely nothing in the puzzle, and might really have been, as
Byrd had declared them to be, absolutely valueless.</p>

<p>He found no stamps. He was not to learn so soon and so easily
whether they stood for anything in the affair or not. Levelling,
and lightly smoothing over the soil, replacing the leaves and
twigs as he had found them, Pointer slipped out of the garden
with a package of broken china under his arm.</p>

<p>Back in his room, he lit his pipe, and gazed out at the stars.
There was one person...but he stopped himself, and instead of
indulging in sheer imagination went back in his mind to what he
knew about the death of Anthony Revell. He wished he had been
able to see the drawing-room and the body at the time. He decided
to go quickly over all the rooms at The Causeway to-morrow
morning so as to have a clear idea of the house in his mind, and
of what the cellars were like, for though the possibility of
hidden treasure was, he thought, very remote, yet it did
exist.</p>

<p>The Causeway in conjunction with Anthony Revell led him to
think of Mrs. Green. He saw again her face as the rector
preached. As with Olive, so with her, he had noted its growing
pallor&mdash;the look of something like fear in the eyes that
never left Mr. Avery's face. Had she gone to the rectory on
Sunday night? And if so, more than once?</p>

<p>Immediately after his breakfast, he interviewed Higgins, the
gardener, who was quite certain that the lady whom he had seen
closing the rectory gate was the artist. Pointer now learned that
Higgins had been the gardener at The Flagstaff and had only lost
that place when Anthony Revell died.</p>

<p>"The rector's gardener had left to join his son in South
Africa," Higgins continued, "and many's the time he'll wish
himself back, in my opinion&mdash;But it left the place open. And
so Mr. Avery, when he heard that I had just got married on the
strength of my good wages with Mr. Revell, he offered me the
place, and didn't I jump at it too! There's a cottage as goes
with it, and the rector he looked after his people he did."
Higgins pulled himself up with an effort.</p>

<p>"And where are you going now?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"I've asked Mrs. Green to take me on again if she buys The
Causeway, as they say she may. If I'd a known that she was a-going
to be my next mistress, I don't say as I should have come
forward, though there's no harm in a lady leaving the rectory
garden on Sunday night."</p>

<p>Pointer agreed and asked him about the incident. Higgins
seemed unable to add anything to what Fraser had repeated.
Walking home around twenty-past eleven, he had passed the
rectory, when he had heard the familiar click of its gate, and
turning had seen Mrs. Green closing it. She had not appeared to
see him but had walked rapidly away in the opposite
direction&mdash;towards the cottage which she had taken
furnished.</p>

<p>"I suppose you've heard, sir," Higgins said as though to
change the subject, "that the tombstone for Mr. Anthony's grave
has come, and they're setting it up? Don't know whether I likes
it or I don't. I'm to supply the flowers though. Mrs. Green's
work it is, and she is to have the say about what flowers are to
go with it. She wants turf a-top, with side bands of gentians and
cyclamen and a line of mountain violas at the foot."</p>

<p>Pointer was not interested in the flowers, but he was in the
fact that the artist, whose name was so often in his own mind,
because so often mentioned in connection with the dead young
man's, had designed the tombstone. Under certain circumstances,
it might be a macabre touch.</p>

<p>He went on to the churchyard, which was quite close.</p>

<p>The gravedigger and a couple of stonemasons were just
smoothing over the earth. Their task was finished A white stone
monument stood at the head of the latest grave in the Revell's
plot of ground. It represented a high gate of white marble
standing ajar, of very fine work, and of singularly effective
proportions.</p>

<p>"But I don't like his name just scratched on that bit of a
ticket as it were," said the sexton, who had lingered for a final
look. "Just that bit of a block where the hasp of the gate
comes&mdash;seems poor like to me&mdash;like a <i>Wet Paint</i>
or <i>Beware of the Dog</i> sign. Though I don't doubt as it's
high and fine art." He hobbled off for the public-house.</p>

<p>Pointer bent down and read the inscription, which was in small
lettering on a little square of marble apparently swinging from
the middle of the gate. The lettering set forth that here lay the
body of Anthony Hibbart Charlton Revell. Armiger. Born in such a
year and died in such a year. With below, in very small
characters, on one line, a text from the seventy-fifth psalm
<i>'For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup and the wine is
red.'</i></p>

<p>For a long time Pointer stood looking at the inconspicuously
placed text. It was a strange one.</p>

<p>He turned away, and made for the cottage where Mrs. Green now
lived. He had seen it many times set in a charming, quickly made
garden which had been a neglected tangle of grass before she took
it over. Now chimney bell-flowers bordered the walk up to the
house. They were only tall green tufts at the moment, but golden
and flame-coloured snapdragons with an edge of purple stocks ran
in waves of splendid colour in front of them. A riot of
Canterbury Bells, single and double rose, blue, lavender and
white, swung at the end of the garden.</p>

<p>One would say that a merry heart lived here. But when Mrs.
Green opened the door to him, she looked as though the garden and
everything in it were but dust and ashes. If a criminal, she was
already beginning to reap the first fruits of the punishment
which none escapes.</p>

<p>She showed no surprise at seeing him, but asked him in as
though he were a regular visitor. He mentioned that he had just
been to the churchyard and seen the tombstone put up to the
memory of Mr. Anthony Revell. A very striking work of art he
thought it. But he owned, he said, that the text chosen by the
family puzzled him.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> chose it," she replied negligently. "I wanted
something short and not too smug. I thought it sounded
comforting."</p>

<p>Pointer permitted himself to look surprised.</p>

<p>"Don't you think that a cup of good red wine is comforting?"
she asked and she showed her teeth in a smile that was like a
menace.</p>

<p>"But the text doesn't say that it is a cup of good wine," he
replied stolidly, "and the context hardly suggests comfort."</p>

<p>"A Bible reader?" she asked, with what he felt to be an effort
at levity.</p>

<p>Pointer somewhat stiffly said that he was.</p>

<p>"Really? I'm not. I just opened a Bible at a venture, and my
eye fell on a sentence that would do. The Revels haven't
complained. It'll pass muster."</p>

<p>There was a short silence. Pointer wondered, as he had when he
first caught sight of it, whether the text referred to Anthony
Revell himself, which would mean that the fate that had befallen
him was the red wine in the cup. Or whether the text was to be
read as a warning to the undiscovered murderer. Either reading
might be right. And her way of answering, would do equally for
either. For that the words had been chosen with a fierce
exactitude to meet some as yet unrevealed position, he was
certain.</p>

<p>He next asked her for what purpose she had called on the
rector yesterday, mentioning that she had been seen and
recognised, when leaving the garden.</p>

<p>She fingered a light net curtain.</p>

<p>"I had got as far as the front steps&mdash;nearly&mdash;" she
said now soberly, "when I decided to think it over. You see, I
had been told that you can always say to-morrow what you haven't
said to-day, but that you can never unsay to-morrow, what you
have said to-day. It's not true. For I can never tell him
now."</p>

<p>"Tell him what, Mrs. Green?" Pointer asked bluntly.</p>

<p>"That Anthony Revell came back late that Thursday night
because of a message from Olive Hill asking him to meet her there
on a very urgent matter." Mrs. Green went on to explain that,
thinking The Causeway to be shut up, she had yielded to a sudden
whim on that same evening to paint it by the moonlight which
chanced to be amazingly bright. She was making a swift sketch
when she heard steps on the gravel and saw Anthony coming quickly
up to the front door. On her calling to him, and suggesting that
she come in with him and that they have supper together before
she should return to The Flagstaff, he had told her that that
would be quite impossible as he had hurried back in order to have
a very private and urgent word with some one. She had instantly
named Olive Hill, and he had not denied it, though he had
insisted on her keeping what she had stumbled on to herself. She
had left on that.</p>

<p>"And why did you not tell the police of this when they were
inquiring into Mr. Revell's death?" he asked her gravely.</p>

<p>"It wasn't a real inquiry," she said evasively. "They were
certain that it was an accident."</p>

<p>"And you're not?"</p>

<p>"No. Not at all certain," she said in a curiously strangled
voice. Looking at her he saw the tremendous effort it was costing
her to say as much. It was disturbing. The Chief Inspector was
rarely wrong in his mental labels, and he did not think that it
was love that was the reason for the strain under which she was
labouring. It was rather that of an accomplice who had keyed
himself up to tell a part of some crime which, if fully known,
would be his own ruin too. He waited, not daring to speak. One
incautious word on his part might seal up lips that were half
hesitant, half determined to speak. He would not even look at
her, but played with his gloves, he who never fidgeted.</p>

<p>But when she kept silence he said very quietly, "And why did
you intend to tell the rector?"</p>

<p>Her eyes leapt for a flash to his, and then fell away
abruptly. He felt the struggle in her. And knew it as fear for
herself pulling against a desire to let herself go, let out
something bitter, vengeful, or perhaps merely just. Again he
waited in a tense silence, his eyes on his shoes.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," came in a sort of croak from her as she swung
far forward in her chair. "Yes, I'll tell you." There was once
more that note of caution struggling with deep passion. "The
rector preached a sermon yesterday. It showed&mdash;" She
stopped. He had to fairly hold himself in his seat in an attitude
of polite interest. "It showed that in some way he knew that
Olive Hill had been to The Causeway. How I can't imagine, but he
knew! He knew too that some one else in the congregation was
aware of this. He was right. I was. His sermon was spoken to me.
To me!" Quite unconsciously she rose and stood, one hand pressed
to her breast, one clenching and unclenching at her side in a
very extremity of fear. Something long pent-up was rushing to get
out, but her instinct of self-preservation was holding it back.
Why? It was a most important query. "That was why I went to the
rectory yesterday evening," she said, now drawing a deep
breath.</p>

<p>And Pointer did not believe her. She had
gone&mdash;yes&mdash;perhaps in response to the
sermon&mdash;perhaps stirred by it in quite another way than she
was representing. It might be true that she had not gone into the
house, but if so that was because the same fear of consequences
to herself that was in her at this moment had last night stopped
her feet when nearly on the threshold of the rectory, had turned
them round, and led them away. From danger?</p>

<p>"I meant to tell him that he was right, that I had known about
Olive's letter to Anthony. But I decided to wait&mdash;and now I
can't ask him what he knew, and what I had better do, so I have
decided to be frank with you."</p>

<p>Pointer thanked her without irony.</p>

<p>"We are very interested in Mr. Revell's death," he went on
slowly with an apparently casual glance, "because, for certain
reasons we are inclined to link up his death with the
rector's."</p>

<p>"Ah!" she said in a quick gasp, "I was afraid of
that&mdash;that&mdash;dreadful possibility! You think he taxed
her with it&mdash;to her face&mdash;and that&mdash;" She stopped
as though there were no need to finish. As indeed there was
not.</p>

<p>"We think he may have come on some evidence which looked as
though Mr. Revell's death was not an accident, and that he was
silenced to prevent him following up the trail, or to prevent him
insisting on the guilty person going with the truth to the
police."</p>

<p>"He would have done just that. He would have insisted on the
truth being told, come what may," she said fiercely.</p>

<p>"You knew him well?" Pointer was aware that, on the contrary,
Mrs. Green had rarely met the rector. Apparently she had
carefully avoided him.</p>

<p>"I know the type well. My&mdash;" She broke off abruptly.</p>

<p>"But I confess I find it difficult to imagine any reason why
Miss Hill should have shot Mr. Revell," Pointer said. "That is
what you're suggesting, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I know she did shoot him," Mrs. Green said between set teeth.
"As to a reason&mdash;there must be one, of course. I wondered
whether he had found out something about her&mdash;about her
past, and that she was wild at the idea of it becoming
known&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As far as is known, her past is quite ordinary," Pointer
replied.</p>

<p>"But perhaps not as far as Anthony knew it&mdash;at the last,"
Mrs. Green now said. "I have no idea of what he learnt about her,
but I feel as certain that she killed him as I do that I am
sitting here."</p>

<p>"Well, leaving a possible connection between the two deaths on
one side, we had already decided that the probabilities were that
Mr. Revell was summoned home by some one who had the right to
summon him. Or, to put it better, whose summons he would not
disregard, whether from fear of the consequences, or from
affection. Now, about the exact words in which Mr. Revell spoke
of having heard from Miss Hill&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pointer was not satisfied with the result of his questions. It
panned out to a very indefinite mass of what she understood
Anthony Revell to have said, rather than what she could repeat
clearly and definitely. His way&mdash;the police way&mdash;of
leaving a subject and then returning to it under another guise,
tripped her up constantly. She did not twice repeat Revell's
words alike. He asked her finally why this was, and she said,
with an effect of frankness, that she herself had been under a
good deal of emotion at the unexpected meeting. She had parted
from Anthony Revell in some heat when she had left The Causeway,
and in the unexpected pleasure of seeing him so soon again, she
had not remembered their talk word for word.</p>

<p>It was a very possible explanation, but it hampered him none
the less. It reduced her certainty that Olive Hill came to The
Causeway to a belief&mdash;possibly&mdash;that she was coming,
and that she was the reason for Anthony's return.</p>

<p>Pointer drew out his pocket diary and turned its leaves for a
moment.</p>

<p>"The trouble is," he now said gravely, "that your whole
evidence is of no value, because of one initial misstatement. A
fundamental one."</p>

<p>Her face, against her will, against her best efforts to the
contrary, turned a livid white. "What do you mean?" she asked
haughtily with lips that were stiff.</p>

<p>"You say the moonlight was so bright that you decided to
sketch the house, and that that was why you were still there at
midnight. But there was no moon whatever on the Thursday night in
question."</p>

<p>She stared out of the window at the garden which she had made
such a mockery of brightness and gaiety.</p>

<p>Then she sighed wearily, and it was a curious sigh. It was
quite unconscious, he believed, and it
was&mdash;unexpectedly&mdash;that of a woman putting on a cloak
of which she was heartily weary, or taking up again a burden
which she thought that she had laid down for good. It interested
the Chief Inspector.</p>

<p>"I see," she said dully. "I wouldn't make a good criminal, I'm
too careless. Well, the truth is that I went to The Causeway for
sentimental reasons&mdash;entirely. I thought I should have it
all to myself."</p>

<p>"So you were in the house when you met Mr. Revell? Not outside
in the garden?"</p>

<p>"I was on my way home when I met Mr. Revell."</p>

<p>"A very lonely road for a lady to be out in at midnight,"
Pointer said to that. And a sudden spark seemed to leap up in his
mind. That revolver taken by Anthony Revell from his bedroom
drawer&mdash;Pointer had already thought it possible that Revell
had fetched it to lend to some one&mdash;a lady
probably&mdash;who was nervous, or who had said that she
was&mdash;of walking a very lonely stretch alone.</p>

<p>And there was another small point that did not disagree with
this idea. Pointer knew the full height of Revell, and his
sitting height to an inch. He was a little too tall for a woman
to have fired the shot in any usual position. But the flight of
the bullet had been too level to have been fired even by a woman
if she had been standing, and Revell sitting. Shilling had
thought that Revell might have been bending down over something
on the table&mdash;and if his murderer were a good shot, used to
quick revolver shooting, that was possible. But if a
lady&mdash;if the weapon had been brought out for her to take
with her in her return walk...Pointer wondered if Revell had been
doing something for her&mdash;tying her shoe-string&mdash;for
instance? That would have brought his head to just the right
height, and would have given a woman time to lift the revolver,
put it to his ear, and pull the trigger. For Revell's eyes and
hands would&mdash;in such a case&mdash;have been occupied with
his task. Mrs. Green wore very smart little tie shoes he noticed,
so did most of the other women around. But Olive Hill, so far as
Pointer had seen her, only wore court shoes.</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Revell offer to let you have his revolver for the way
back?" he asked her next.</p>

<p>"I never thought of that!" she said with dilated pupils, and
seemed to shrivel where she sat in her chair. Then she looked
up.</p>

<p>"I've wondered how it happened. He never kept the revolver
downstairs. And it's quite unlike him to have lain in wait for a
housebreaker with a revolver. Even to threaten him. His way would
have been to lock everything up carefully and then go to bed. I
never thought of his lending it to&mdash;the person who shot
him."</p>

<p>Pointer said nothing for a moment. The person who had shot
Anthony Revell might be talking to him. For that she was on very
thin ice and knew it was still apparent to him. She now showed so
white and weak, so drained by the emotions that warred in her,
that he had to leave. She could barely open the door for him, and
as he turned round at the gate, he saw her holding on to the
lintel. He thought that she made a half-start after him, but if
so, she checked herself and managed to turn her movement into a
faint wave of her hand.

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13"></a>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h2>

<p class="first">POINTER walked away through a very pretty
wood-side, and for once he, who knew the sound of every bird in every
season, heard nothing of the thrush in the thicket, nor the
skylark far overhead. All that he had been told by Mrs. Green
suggested a murder in which valuable stamps had no part. A murder
caused by passions that have swept the world long before stamps
were in use, passions that had raged in the caves of the
troglodytes.</p>

<p>It rather looked as though Mrs. Green had been the murderer.
There was a woman&mdash;not the artist&mdash;one of whose actions
had seemed to Pointer to indicate her as very possibly the double
murderess, but he never let a mere opinion influence his
judgment. From what he had heard of her infatuation for Anthony
Revell, from what she had now told him, Mrs. Green must be very
suspect.</p>

<p>Whether guilty or not, she was trying to throw suspicion on
Olive Hill. Not very cleverly. But then Pointer did not consider
Mrs. Green a clever woman. She had not even made out a case for
the visit of Olive Hill to The Causeway on that fatal Thursday
night. He said as much to the Chief Constable and Shilling at the
police station.</p>

<p>"If Byrd were the murderer," Weir-Opie commented, "then Miss
Hill was there, and Mrs. Green was only the first of three
visitors that Revell had that night."</p>

<p>"And of course Miss Hill herself is out of the running,
because of what she stood to lose." Shilling was glad that she
was out of it. He was a romantic soul. "Even if stamps were at
the bottom of the two murders&mdash;and I still think them a very
promising trail&mdash;even so, Revell's fortune was eighty
thousand pounds, not to speak of The Causeway. No stamps would
bring her in that much."</p>

<p>"Of course if it were Byrd," went on Weir-Opie, who was just
getting under way&mdash;"say the revolver was taken for the
reason that Shilling first maintained at the inquest, but no
housebreaker shows up, and Miss Hill arrives. The revolver lies
forgotten on a side-table. Byrd comes in&mdash;she would have had
to pass his cottage to go from the rectory to The
Causeway&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which means pass under his bedroom window," Shilling threw
in.</p>

<p>Weir-Opie nodded. "Just so. He follows her. She gets away.
Byrd shoots Revell in a passion of fury. Humph." The Major seemed
to hold his sketch up at arm's length and look at it, with
growing doubts. "Don't think much of that idea," he said at
last.</p>

<p>"Byrd has never lost his head, his long narrow head, over Miss
Hill, in my opinion. He isn't the type," muttered Shilling.</p>

<p>"What do you say, Pointer?" asked Weir-Opie. "One of my
objections to him is that he seemed to like the rector's sermon,"
was the quaint reply.</p>

<p>"He looked for all the world like the chairman of a debating
society listening to a really good piece of special
pleading&mdash;when he wasn't staring at Miss Hill, and with
anything but a lover's eye."</p>

<p>"Do you think Olive Hill turned up at The Causeway, found
Revell dead and didn't dare give the alarm because of not wanting
it to be known that she was there at that hour of the night?"
asked the Major.</p>

<p>"I doubt it," Pointer said slowly. "A genuine appointment
would have very much cramped the real murderer, who, according to
Mrs. Green, would have been told by Revell that his fiance was
coming. And a murderer likes to have plenty of time for
unforeseen emergencies."</p>

<p>"Unless he has an elaborate alibi and is working to schedule,"
put in Shilling.</p>

<p>"But if it had been intended to ask for the loan of a
revolver, ample time would have been a necessity," the Chief
Inspector pointed out. "The murderer could not time the offer and
the production of the weapon to a minute."</p>

<p>"True. If Miss Hill were expected, minutes would count."
Weir-Opie lit his pipe. "She might have arrived before her time. As
you say, a thought to rattle the best of murderers! So you
think?</p>

<p>"On the whole it looks to me, sir, as though Revell had been
summoned home by a spurious message, a false appointment with
Miss Hill. And if, as it seems likely, the trap had been baited
by the murderer with her name, he, or she, would have known that
they had the rest of the night before them."</p>

<p>"He or she," repeated Weir-Opie, "which, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"If a man," Shilling put in, "it would boil down to two,
wouldn't it&mdash;Byrd, and Sir Hubert Witson."</p>

<p>"You're forgetting Gilbert Revell, aren't you?" Pointer asked.
"I grant he's in a place apart, because, though he stands to
benefit most by Anthony Revell's death, men rarely murder their
elder brothers, however much to their financial advantage it may
be."</p>

<p>"Nor does he look the part?" Weir-Opie said. "You saw him on
Sunday.</p>

<p>"I grant you he doesn't, sir."</p>

<p>"Which theoretically means nothing at all, as we all know,"
Weir-Opie said sarcastically, "but which, in point of fact, means
a lot more than opportunity and profit and all the rest of
it."</p>

<p>They then passed on to Byrd and Sir Hubert with the stamps as
a motive, or with jealousy as a second possible motive.</p>

<p>Mrs. Green sat awhile at the open window trying to steady her
nerves after Pointer had left her. She had not blundered, she
felt sure. She had not let slip any word which might have been
fatal. But the effort at caution which he had discerned had left
her spent, and after a little she put on her hat and walked down
to Anthony's grave. She stood looking at her own design for a
full minute, murmuring under her breath between her clenched
teeth: "And the wine is poured out and has to be drunk." For a
second she bent lower, as though she would have liked to throw
herself down full length on that narrow stretch of earth. But she
straightened up, and turning away with a look in her eyes that
made the sexton say to a young gravedigger with him, "The right
flower for that grave would be <i>Love lies bleeding.</i> Why,
these days, with her grieving, she looks older than her
ladyship."</p>

<p>Mrs. Green walked on aimlessly for a while. Then at a
cross-road, she turned and looked over at the chimneys of The
Causeway.</p>

<p>She had decided to buy the place if only to have the right to
keep Olive Hill from wandering over it at will. She walked on.
Ahead of her, she caught sight of a tall graceful figure. Only
one woman around here moved with that mixture of ease and
vigour.</p>

<p>She quickened her steps. In a way, she could have wished it
had been any one but Mrs. Avery, for the happiness that had
radiated from Doris of late was hard to bear, when you knew that
never would that look shine in your own eyes again, or flush your
cheek any more. Otherwise, besides being attracted by her beauty,
Mrs. Green liked Doris, her wide, intelligent brow, her calm
dignified air, and if her manner was a shade overbearing, her
infrequent smile was enchanting. Doris Avery, Mrs. Green thought,
was a woman born to make herself felt&mdash;unlike Grace Avery.
Given a wider sphere, as now seemed likely from the tales about
her husband's altered fortunes, and Doris might make a name for
herself.</p>

<p>As she hurried forward to catch her up, Mrs. Green saw Grace
Avery also turning into the lane. Mrs. Green decided to give the
two sisters-in-law time to exchange their own private news, and
then she would have a word with them both, for what she wanted to
say was for the two of them. As she watched them walking on
ahead, she thought how little she knew the dead rector's sister.
As a rule, Mrs. Green summed people up very quickly and, if not
always accurately, at least clearly. But she felt by no means
certain that she had yet met the real Grace Avery. The very
pleasant, quiet, well-read, well-bred outside might extend all
the way, or it might not. She could not tell.</p>

<p>She had heard that at one time Anthony was supposed to have
been very much attracted to Grace, but personally she had never
heard him mention her. Grace, she noticed, had a slower step than
Doris, but she covered the ground as quickly. Her fair head with
its closely trimmed hair was held as erect as her sister-in-law's.
Some people complained of her unresponsiveness, but she
had intelligent eyes, grey and clear, and very firm lips. Even
her brother's death seemed to have left no trace on her composed,
fair face as she turned it now and then to Doris. Mrs. Green
thought that in looks she was very like the rector, but that she
lacked his charm.</p>

<p>She called to the two women and, turning, they waited for her
to come up.</p>

<p>She wasted no time in greetings or small talk.</p>

<p>"The police now believe that Anthony was murdered, and that
there is a connection between his death and that of the rector,"
she blurted out in a fierce voice.</p>

<p>Doris and Grace stared at her appalled.</p>

<p>"Connection? Anthony and the rector? What in the world has
happened?" Doris demanded, as Grace looked too horrified to
speak.</p>

<p>"Mr. Pointer thinks that the rector learnt of something about
Anthony's death, and that that was why he was poisoned."</p>

<p>There followed a pause of absolute consternation. All three
women were very pale.</p>

<p>"Was <i>that</i> what he meant by Sunday's sermon?" Grace
asked under her breath. "That splendid but very searching
sermon?"</p>

<p>The last vestiges of colour faded from Mrs. Green's face. She
looked suddenly old and broken, and something of the fear which
Pointer had read into her gaze came back to her eyes. It was as
though, defenceless, she looked at some danger coming towards
her.</p>

<p>"John's sermon?" Doris asked now in an utterly bewildered
tone. "What on earth have sermons to do with this? This is
awful!"</p>

<p>"So was John's sermon&mdash;to the guilty," Grace said with
conviction.</p>

<p>"It's nothing to do with any sermon," Mrs. Green said shortly.
"There's something I told the police that I must tell you both.
That's why I caught up with you. Anthony came back to The
Causeway that Thursday because of a letter from Olive Hill. She
had written him that she had something very urgent to say to him.
She had an interview with him there&mdash;that night."</p>

<p>Grace jumped. Doris looked as though the fence beside them had
hit her in the eye. Then she slowly turned to Mrs. Green with a
very critical look on her face. "Forgive my plain speaking, but
is this your imagination? You're a bitter enemy of Olive's, we
all know. Or have you some private information?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Green told her what she had told the Chief Inspector, and
Doris's questions were almost as much to the point as those of
the Chief Inspector had been. Mrs. Green answered them as
fully.</p>

<p>"I've said nothing about it except to Mr. Pointer," she added,
"and I shan't speak of it to any one else. But as things are, you
and Miss Avery ought to know&mdash;what the police
think&mdash;where they are looking for the criminal&mdash;the
double criminal. For they think Mr. Avery found Miss Hill's
letter, and because he found it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, impossible!" came from both her hearers in tones of sheer
horror.</p>

<p>"He may have learned what I have all along thought was
possible, that Olive had a talk with Anthony that night," Grace
suggested. Slow in action, she was often far too impulsive in her
speech. The opposite of Doris, who could be impulsive enough in
action, yet who rarely spoke without due thought. "And that she
told Anthony that she didn't love him. Anthony, in the shock of
learning that, might have shot himself. But that's a very
different notion from this ghastly idea of the police."</p>

<p>"Your idea is nonsense," Mrs. Green spoke quite vehemently.
"She ran after him. She stalked him as though she were a hunter,
and he a chamois."</p>

<p>"That's quite a mistaken notion of yours," Doris now said
coldly, "as I happen to know. Anthony was desperately in love
with Olive. Long before she would look at him, he used to rave
about her to me. Not a word of these ideas about Olive must get
about, Mrs. Green, as you yourself realise. She may have gone to
see Anthony that Thursday night, and been foolish enough to say
nothing about it, but as for her having shot him&mdash;or having
harmed my brother-in-law. That's absolutely and utterly out of
the question! It really sounds&mdash;mad&mdash;to me."</p>

<p>Doris's eye was a very clear warning to the artist as to what
position she, Mrs. Richard Avery, and Miss Avery would take in
the matter. And with that, they took a very frigid leave of Mrs.
Green.</p>

<p>"That's a very dangerous woman," Doris said slowly, as the
sisters-in-law walked on together. "She means mischief. She's out
for Olive's blood. Mark my words."</p>

<p>Grace hardly heard her. White-faced, she was almost stumbling.
Doris noticing this, drew her to a stile near them, and the two
sat down for a moment.</p>

<p>"What awful thing has come to us?" Grace asked, her eyes wild.
"I could have married, more than once, Doris, and I wouldn't,
because I hate emotion. I hate to be stirred to the depths. And
now here is this awful thing that has us in its grip. Anthony
supposed to have been murdered! And John, dearest John, to have
been murdered because of it! And we in the midst of
it&mdash;"</p>

<p>There fell a short silence.</p>

<p>"You know," Doris said suddenly, "the idea that Olive shot
Anthony is ridiculous. I don't believe the police think that for
a moment. Mrs. Green would like them to, no doubt. Anthony was a
windfall for Olive such as she could never hope for again. Of
<i>course</i> she didn't kill him&mdash;and of course he wasn't
shot&mdash;except accidentally by himself&mdash;poor man."</p>

<p>"If they don't think she shot him and, as you say, she had no
motive whatever to, then&mdash;according to this awful idea Mrs.
Green told us about, of their believing that there is a link
between his death and John's&mdash;they can't suspect her of
killing John either." Grace was groping from impossible nightmare
horrors to the comparatively bearable.</p>

<p>"Of course they don't," Doris said in a tone of finality.
"Though between ourselves, Grace, I think she may have written to
Anthony to meet her on Thursday for a private talk. That much of
Mrs. Green's tale I believe. Chiefly because of something John
said to me while I was looking up those references for him.
Something about a letter he had found and burnt&mdash;and about
Olive, and Anthony, and The Causeway. He said he wanted a talk
with her the first thing Monday morning. He asked whether I
thought her, as he did, the kind to do better when given ample
time for reflection. I agreed with him, though at the time I
hadn't an idea what it was all about. I can't give you the exact
words that he said, partly I was busy hunting for a footnote,
partly I had come in with a letter from Dick that I wanted to
show him, partly too, I think that Jack was rather obscure
himself."</p>

<p>"Do you think it was her to whom he talked later that night,
for I've always had an idea you recognised two voices? Not just
his alone." Grace looked apologetically at Doris. "As a matter of
fact, I as good as told Mr. Pointer that you might add something
to what you had told him about that, when he pressed me for
further details."</p>

<p>Doris looked anything but pleased at having her hand
forced.</p>

<p>"Yes, I did hear some one besides John," she finally said.
"Don't ask me whom just yet. I'll tell you later. Now about
Olive. I don't think she ought to leave the rectory as things
are. Not at once."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;do you really want her as your secretary?" asked
Grace.</p>

<p>"Richard doesn't," Doris confessed under her breath, "but
having taken Olive on, it would be brutal&mdash;just now, to send
her away. It would mean throwing her to the dogs. As long as we
stand by her, people won't readily believe anything dreadful. But
I think we must know more. I'm going to have a talk with her as
soon as I see her."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you're right," Grace said after a pause, "you often
are."</p>

<p>"Not about her engagement to Anthony meaning happiness for
them both," Doris spoke sombrely. "Oh, Grace, if only the
calendar could be put back by two months or so! But now, about
Olive's leaving the rectory&mdash;we know that she didn't have
anything to do with either death, no matter what Mrs. Green says.
And we agree that the police can't suspect Olive of doing away
with a marvellous <i>parti.</i> It's very possible that she had
nothing to do with Anthony's return to The Causeway. Shall we
walk on now?"</p>

<p>"A very dreadful thought has struck me"&mdash;Grace rose
slowly&mdash;"but first, I must tell you something about Olive
which I kept back." She went on to speak of the losses which she
was certain had been connected with the girl.</p>

<p>Doris stiffened. "And you let me take her on?" Her tone spoke
volumes.</p>

<p>"It was a frightfully awkward position," Grace said
apologetically. "What could I do? Just then, when she had had
such a frightful shock? I had no proofs, as the police would say.
I could trust you to notice at once if&mdash;well&mdash;if her
pilfering started again. John thought she ought to be given a
chance. But what I want to say now is this: If Anthony had ever
learnt of her dreadful failing&mdash;" she stopped, and looked in
what seemed dismay at her companion. "He couldn't have learnt
about it, surely, and have shot himself on that account? Or
"&mdash;she grasped Doris's arm convulsively, her usually calm
eyes distended with excitement&mdash;"or, it's not possible, is
it"&mdash;her voice shook&mdash;"that Olive thought he was going
to let Mr. Byrd know about it and&mdash;and"&mdash;she
paused&mdash;"I think Olive would be capable of anything to keep
Mr. Byrd from ever learning&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'You think?'" Doris asked in a low voice, as Grace stopped
abruptly.</p>

<p>"The awful thought which has just come to me, is whether
Olive, who knew nothing of firearms, might not have, in a fury if
she thought there was a possibility of Anthony giving her away to
Byrd, picked up the revolver, and had an accident with it."</p>

<p>"And what about John?" Doris asked in her cool, incisive
tones. "The police think the two deaths were linked. Do you think
Olive had an accident with the toadstool extract, too?"</p>

<p>As Grace looked too appalled to speak, Doris continued:</p>

<p>"I feel sure that there was no connection between the two
deaths. All the same, you've suggested the one and only possible
reason which might have accounted for Olive, if beside
herself&mdash;" she did not finish the sentence, and they turned
in at the rectory gate.</p>

<p>Doris found Olive in her sitting-room busy replying to letters
of condolence. Doris did not glance at them.</p>

<p>"Look here, Olive, my rooms have had everything in the way of
get-at-able papers shifted. Now, don't say it's the police, they
put them back better. What are you hunting for all over the
house?"</p>

<p>There was a fiery and determined look in Doris's eye that
matched the tone in her voice.</p>

<p>Olive drew a deep breath. Just then Grace opened the door, saw
the two together, and made as though to step out again, but Doris
asked her to come in and sit down.</p>

<p>"Well?" She turned to Olive peremptorily.</p>

<p>"The hidden treasure," Olive said at last. "You both laugh at
it, and I didn't mean to pry among your papers, but I'm sure it's
in existence in The Causeway, or rather under The Causeway. I
once saw a plan the rector had, showing how the foundations ran.
And then, in an old book of his, I found some drawings belonging
to Anthony's grandfather, giving as nearly as possible the
position of the treasure. And his drawings fitted the real
foundations marvellously. I told Mr. Avery about it, and he
agreed with me that it was odd. He added that he had another old
paper somewhere, one which Anthony's grandfather had found, a
copy of a really old paper dated around the middle of the
fifteenth century, and said he would look for it and show it me,
since I was interested."</p>

<p>"But you've only been hunting for papers in the library since
John's death," Grace said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Because Mr. Avery had promised to look for that particular
paper and show it me."</p>

<p>Grace said nothing, but she gave Olive a very long look.</p>

<p>"And why should <i>I</i> have the paper, or papers?" Doris
asked crisply.</p>

<p>"You and Grace, both of you, took a lot of the rector's papers
to look through," Olive explained.</p>

<p>Doris looked less resentful, she even nodded, as though
acknowledging that as a fair explanation.</p>

<p>Grace slipped away. Doris waited till the door was shut
again.</p>

<p>"I have a very difficult thing to say to you," she said then.
"Mrs. Green tells me that the police are dissatisfied with the
finding about Anthony's death. They think he was shot
intentionally, and she has told them that you were at The
Causeway the night that Anthony died."</p>

<p>"It's not true!" came in a loud, firm voice from Olive. "She
would like to say I shot him, I know. I've known from the first
that she has only stayed on in the neighbourhood for some such
reason. But I wasn't there that night. I knew nothing about his
coming to The Causeway!"</p>

<p>"And you didn't write to him to meet you there?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. As I say, I knew nothing whatever about his
coming home that night."</p>

<p>"Then I must believe you. Well, there's nothing for it but to
be patient, and endure."</p>

<p>Doris gave a sigh, and went in search of Grace.</p>

<p>"Olive denies absolutely that she was at The Causeway the
night that Anthony was shot," she said. "I think she's telling
the truth. John must have been mistaken, but it looks as though
Mrs. Green had been talking to him that night."</p>

<p>"It does," Grace said. "And now, what do we do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing." Doris spoke firmly. "The thing is too big for
me&mdash;for us&mdash;to meddle with. If Dick were here, I should
be guided entirely by what he would wish, but he can't get here
for another month at the earliest. I'm afraid of blundering
again." Grace had never heard proud, confident Doris avow as
much. "I've warned Olive what to expect, and the thing must run
its course, but I'm afraid of Mrs. Green. I hope Olive will be
careful of herself. The person who killed Anthony is, according
to the police, the person who poisoned John. And strictly between
ourselves, Grace, I think it looks as though it must have been
Mrs. Green herself, for it was her voice that I heard in the
study."

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14"></a>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h2>

<p class="first">AN hour later Pointer, who was at the rectory in
order to look through some papers, was able to ask Doris about
the voice heard by her in the rectory study last Sunday. She said
at once that it had been that of Mrs. Green. He asked her why she
had not told him sooner. Doris explained that she was not sure
herself until Mrs. Green had stopped and talked to them to-day.
Certain intonations were so unmistakable that she was now
prepared to swear to her certainty that Mrs. Green had been in
the room beneath her own, talking to her brother-in-law.</p>

<p>"And there's another thing, Mr. Pointer. That letter of mine
from my husband that you found hidden away under the lining-paper
of one of the drawers in the library, do you remember?"</p>

<p>Pointer said that he did.</p>

<p>"Any one but Mrs. Green would have known it was mine, they
would have recognised the handwriting. But Mrs. Green wouldn't
know it. Nor know that the rector never kept anything but
religious papers in there."</p>

<p>"By 'any one' you mean Miss Hill?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;yes. Miss Hill or any other intimate of the
family."</p>

<p>Pointer too thought, as Doris insisted, that it was far more
logical to suspect Mrs. Green than Miss Hill, Anthony Revell's
fiance. He did not tell her that Lady Witson had just startled
Shilling by asserting that if the two deaths were linked, the
rector had shot Revell himself, and then taken poison in
remorse.</p>

<p>When she left him, as Olive was out on one of her long walks,
he had another look over some of the books in the locked study
and library. So far, nothing had been found. And if the criminal
had been Mrs. Green, then he did not think that anything would be
found, for she was not in the least interested in the rooms of
the rectory. If she had poisoned the rector for the sake of the
folded paper, then, after hunting wildly and ever more
desperately that same night, she had found it and destroyed it.
Yet she looked to him like a soul in torment. Not, he thought,
because of something done that could never be undone, but from
some dread of the future. But she stayed on in the neighbourhood.
He had wondered many, times why she seemed unable to tear herself
away from the place.</p>

<p>"It's my belief," Shilling said, "that she stays in the
neighbourhood from devotion to Revell's memory&mdash;or remorse,"
he 'added, pulling at his moustache.</p>

<p>"On the other hand it may really be because she finds the
neighbourhood paintable," Weir-Opie objected. "Just as I always
thought it spoke for her interest in her paintings at The
Causeway rather than in Revell himself, that she turned up there
immediately after she heard of his death, not to weep over his
body&mdash;it hadn't been taken away yet&mdash;but to varnish her
paintings. They were finished, bar that. Now, that's the
craftsman's spirit, rather than the lover's! The room had had all
the furniture moved out of it, so it was of no interest to us.
She was allowed to lock herself in there, and varnish away. Why
lock herself in? Oh, that was on account of wanting no dust made
by people moving about."</p>

<p>Pointer walked up to The Causeway which had already acquired
the forlorn look of an unoccupied house. Jamieson was polishing
the brasses on the door. Pointer had already had several talks
with him, none of which had thrown any light on Revell's death.
As for the existence of hidden treasure, Jamieson could only say
that certainly Mr. Revell had never talked of it, and no
unauthorised person had tried to gain an entrance to the house
since his death. While of those who had a right to enter, only
Miss Hill had asked to be left alone to go where she pleased.</p>

<p>"Had her pleasure ever taken her into the smoking-room where
the painted panels are?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>No, he was told that Miss Hill had never asked him for that
particular key. When she had finished the varnishing which had
brought her to The Causeway, Mrs. Green had handed the key to
Jamieson and asked him to keep the room locked until the varnish
should be bone dry.</p>

<p>Pointer had it unlocked now. He looked with interest at the
room as he stepped in. It was a large one and quite empty, bare
even of a carpet. A shoulder-high panelling ran around it, broken
only by the three windows and the big fireplace. Over the latter,
an oval painting was inset in the wood. Other paintings were
similarly set into all the top panels on the three walls. Each
picture only separated from its neighbour by the upright of
wood.</p>

<p>"There's work for you," said Jamieson with respect, "but, of
course, she thought it was her own house she was painting. That's
sure. Though as I told the Major, there was no goings-on here.
She worshipped the ground he walked on, right enough, and she
hated Miss Hill worse than cold boiled veal. And fine rows she
and the master had over her, but that was all. And if you had
seen as much of Mrs. Green as I did, why, you wouldn't expect
anything else."</p>

<p>Pointer nodded. He was examining the paintings one by one,
taking his time over each. Yes, as he thought. Not one of them
had been varnished. Not one!</p>

<p>"Did it take Mrs. Green long to varnish these?" he asked
casually.</p>

<p>"All of two hours," Jamieson said. "Which shows that she
hadn't lost her head over him as some try to make out. He was
lying dead in the drawing-room at the very time."</p>

<p>"Had you seen the paintings before they were varnished?"</p>

<p>Jamieson had not. Mrs. Green kept the door locked when away
from the house. "It's my belief that that's why she's buying the
house," Jamieson went on, glad to have some one to talk to. "She
always steps in for a glance at them whenever she comes. Or
rather she did, until she decided to buy the place. Since then,
she's just told me to keep the room locked, which I have. Yes,"
he rambled on, "I've had a word on the quiet that the house is as
good as sold to her." Though what a widow lady wanted such an
inconvenient barn of a place for, puzzled him. Pointer and he
agreed that when it came to sentiment, however, women lost their
heads. "Why, even her ladyship won't ever come into the house,"
Jamieson added, "and to one who knew on what bad terms she and
the master were it does seem funny. But she told me herself that
she couldn't bear to set foot in it."</p>

<p>Pointer said that he had been told that there had been a talk
of offering the place to Miss Hill.</p>

<p>Jamieson sagely said that talk was easy, but when it came to
actually signing things people felt differently.</p>

<p>Pointer agreed, and asked if he could keep the key for a
little while. Jamieson had no objection, and after half an hour
spent in the room by himself, the Chief Inspector locked the door
and took the next train up to town.</p>

<p>He had telephoned to a Mr. Joyce before he went.</p>

<p>Mr. Joyce was an artist who owed Pointer more than he could
ever repay, and who assured him that he would gladly spare the
time for a run down to The Causeway and for a look at some
paintings there.</p>

<p>"It's this way, sir," Pointer explained, as he drove him from
his home in Richmond, "these paintings were finished, and then
put into their places' in the wainscoting. Well, I believe that
some one, apparently the artist herself, has painted other scenes
over them. Here and there she has smeared the woodwork with brush
marks. The central painting at the moment represents a break in
the clouds and shows a group of pines with heather hills in the
background.'</p>

<p>"Bonny Scotland?"</p>

<p>"The pines are Arolla pines," Pointer said dubiously.</p>

<p>Each busied himself with his papers until The Causeway was
reached. There Pointer led the other at once to the study and
unlocking the door, locked it again after them. He had brought
some clean rags, and a bottle of spirit and white turps with
him.</p>

<p>But first of all the artist had a general look about him.</p>

<p>"Clever work, but very swift," was his verdict. "Any
information?"</p>

<p>"Used one palette, and one brush throughout. Mixed no colours.
All are as they came from the tubes."</p>

<p>"How long would it take, do you think, Mr. Joyce?"</p>

<p>"Around an hour and a half. Her hand shook a good deal. Does
she drink?"</p>

<p>Pointer had not heard that she did.</p>

<p>Then Pointer set to work with rag and bottle, the artist
helping him. As they cleared the first inset, the R.A. raised his
sandy eyebrows.</p>

<p>"I say! What's this This is really good, you know. Really
good!"</p>

<p>Mr. Joyce went round purring like a cat. Finally, when Pointer
had finished cleaning the paint off the last, the centre picture,
Joyce stood back and surveyed it and the walls around it. The
centre showed now a charming view of an old belfry rising from a
sea of green, with grey roofs, a red spire, far-away bits of deep
blue water, and a distant line of mountains, one of which was
snow covered.</p>

<p>Joyce looked at them all very narrowly. He seemed puzzled.</p>

<p>"An artist painted these all right. That's certain. There's
splendid work in every one of them. These weren't painted in two
hours! Yet there's no composition here. No design. Wonder why
not? Wonder why she chose to paint with such photographic
exactness? How can I tell they're exact when I don't know the
places?" He smiled at Pointer's question. "Bless you, their
accuracy hits you in the eye. She hasn't altered one roof-tile,
I'll swear, and why such an artist should have left her
foregrounds, and backgrounds, and middle distances like that, is
a puzzle. They're not pictures at all! Just magnificently
reproduced, unselected masses of objects. And now what?"</p>

<p>Now entered Weston, a local constable, and a very good
photographer. He had, at Pointer's request, been at work, taking
photographs of each picture on the walls, and had brought them
with him enlarged and numbered. Pointer asked him to take most
careful pictures of the paintings as they now were&mdash;the
under paintings, the real pictures. He hoped by studying them to
understand the significance of their presence in the study
here.</p>

<p>The photographs as a whole, and in detail, taken, Weston
hurried away to develop and enlarge the results of his Leica, and
Pointer, thanking Mr. Joyce, saw him off back to town. Then he
walked over to The Flagstaff with the key of The Causeway
smoking-room in his pocket. He asked for Gilbert Revell. Gilbert
was not under suspicion at all. He had two authentic alibis for
the nights which interested the police, at places far removed
from the neighbourhood. He had been away a great deal lately and
Pointer had only seen him a couple of times. He had found him as
he looked, and as was his reputation&mdash;a very simple,
unpretentious, rather indolent young man who was retiring from a
First Division Clerkship at the Admiralty as soon as it could be
arranged.</p>

<p>He wanted to see the world, he said, and was deep in yacht
designs when Pointer was shown in.</p>

<p>Pointer asked if he might be allowed one room at The Causeway
for the present, in which to keep records of the evidence taken
at the time of Anthony Revell's death. If Mr. Revell would allow
him the use of, say, the smoking-room and let him keep the key
for the present, he, Pointer, would be much obliged.</p>

<p>Gilbert came out instantly from the merits of auxiliary steam
engines versus oil engines, and blinked at him.</p>

<p>"I don't understand," he said sharply.</p>

<p>"I can't explain more fully," Pointer said regretfully, "and
even this much is in absolute confidence. We're not satisfied
about Mr. Avery's death, and some inquiries made at the time of
your brother's death look as though they might turn out to be of
use to us. If we could keep some of our notes at The Causeway, it
would save a great deal of going to and fro."</p>

<p>"Really? Oh, in that case, certainly use the smoking-room for
the time being, though I don't know how long the permission can
stand, for Mrs. Green is thinking of buying the house&mdash;at a
ridiculous price it's true, but it's none so easy to sell those
sized houses nowadays, so Mr. Smith tells us."</p>

<p>Pointer agreed that it wasn't.</p>

<p>"You don't think&mdash;" Gilbert hesitated for a second, then
pushed on. "Take one of these cigars, Chief Inspector, I'm
awfully glad you've called."</p>

<p>"I hoped to find Mrs. Green here," Pointer said as he thanked
his host and took a cigar.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Green? She hasn't been near us for weeks," Gilbert said
easily, following suit.</p>

<p>Pointer knew as much, and it had puzzled him. By all accounts
Mrs. Green and Lady Revell had been good friends&mdash;until the
death of Anthony Revell. Though no one but Pointer appeared to
have noticed the time when the two women seemed to part, and its
possible significance.</p>

<p>"I wanted to ask you if there's any truth in the latest
rumour," Gilbert went on, "that you're looking into my brother's
death? My mother is quite upset."</p>

<p>"Frankly, Mr. Revell," Pointer said with genuine regret,
meeting the young's man's distressed eyes, "we are."</p>

<p>"Good God!" Gilbert's tanned face paled a little. "You don't
think&mdash;you haven't found anything&mdash;I mean, why do you
think his death had anything to do with the rector's? They say
you do."</p>

<p>"The other way round. We are wondering whether the rector
hadn't come on something, a letter we imagine, which threw a new
light on Mr. Anthony Revell's death."</p>

<p>"A new light," repeated Gilbert in an appalled voice, "what
sort of a new light?"</p>

<p>"We rather think that possibly Mr. Revell returned in answer
to a letter," Pointer said, "and was shot, either by the writer
or by some one who knew that Mr. Revell would be at his home that
night. And we think the rector may have stumbled on the letter
itself, or on some piece of writing, which made him think that
Mr. Revell had been deliberately killed. We think he showed his
knowledge, and was poisoned to prevent his coming to us with the
information, possibly with the letter which we think he had
found."</p>

<p>Gilbert had let his cigar go out, his face was dead white
now.</p>

<p>"What a&mdash;" he stopped. "How awful! Good God! And what
have you to go on?"</p>

<p>"Precious little," Pointer could have said, "chiefly Mr.
Avery's sermon." But he only shook his head and looked very
wise.</p>

<p>Gilbert had jumped to his feet, and, his hands thrust deep in
the pockets of his plus-fours was walking up and down the rug,
keeping to it as though it were bounded by precipices.</p>

<p>"Who told you that we were linking the two deaths?" Pointer
asked.</p>

<p>"It's all over the place. But Byrd was the one who actually
told me. We were going off on an expedition together. Of course
this knocks it on the head."</p>

<p>"Mr. Byrd will have to sail without you?" Pointer suggested
easily.</p>

<p>"He won't hear of it. Till this dreadful business is cleared
up. My mother has gone to her room. I blurted it out rather too
bluntly. She swears you're all wrong. That my brother's death was
sheerest accident, as it surely must have been!" But he looked
interrogatively at the detective officer who said nothing.</p>

<p>Gilbert again swerved on his rug to avoid the parquet.</p>

<p>"You think it was jealousy?" he asked in a low voice. "Some
woman who didn't want him to marry Miss Hill?"</p>

<p>"On the whole we do, but there are alternatives," Pointer
said. He did not mind how many people knew about the letter which
he believed had decoyed Anthony Revell to his death. A letter
which was either still at the rectory, or not in existence any
more.</p>

<p>In the former case, except in their own respective rooms, no
search went on without an unobtrusive but keen eye being kept on
the searcher and the article searched. As for the rest, Pointer
wanted all the help that he could get. Anthony Revell might have
stopped for petrol nearby, might have let drop a word at the pump
which might be of use. Nothing was of greater help in big
inquiries than the small items brought in singly and diffidently,
which added up to unexpected totals. In Latin countries the
police were often misled by imagination playing the part of
memory, but not with the English countryside. What they said they
had seen or heard, they had. But the stamps which still might be
the explanation of the two deaths were quite another matter.
Absolute silence about them was still Pointer's order. If a
valuable stamp or stamps had played a part in the double tragedy,
there would be no chance whatever of finding it or them if the
police were even suspected of an interest in philately.</p>

<p>Gilbert stumped up and down his little island, now raging at
the credulity of the police who could not bear to have a simple
but intelligible accident remain a pure mischance, but must needs
see it through official eyes as a horrible crime. After all, he
claimed, men threw over girls, even fiances, every day of the
year without being shot for it. "You know what Mrs. Green is
saying?" he stopped his short walk to ask. "That Anthony had
thought better of his engagement, and wrote and tried to get out
of it. Came back on the Thursday to see Miss Hill on the Friday,
and was shot. She doesn't say by whom. No need to. Lady Witson
said it first, I believe, but Mrs. Green had adopted it this
morning as her idea too, so I'm told."</p>

<p>"What does Mr. Byrd say about that idea?" Pointer asked with
real interest.</p>

<p>Gilbert looked surprised at the question.</p>

<p>"Byrd? I don't think he's commented on it. He's the sort who
likes to listen more than to take the floor. But as Miss Hill
wants to come with us and try for a fresh life under fairer
opportunities, it seems beastly unfair on her, to me. She's a
gentle sort of little thing who'd be grieved no end if she had an
idea of how poisonous some tongues are. She was crying the other
day when I overtook her near The Causeway. Her life's blighted
enough as it is, without this cruelty shown to her. I think
people ought to try and make it up to her."</p>

<p>Gilbert spoke warmly, with a flash of honest anger in his blue
eyes.</p>

<p>Pointer nodded with a speculative look at him. Had Miss Hill
cared for the younger brother, rather than for Byrd, as Shilling
thought? It would alter a good deal, if so. In that case, she
would have lost nothing by the death of the elder brother.
Nothing at all. On the contrary. Something about Gilbert's face
suggested that she would have an unusually generous young man to
deal with.</p>

<p>The photographs of Anthony, which was all that Pointer had to
go by, showed a man who might, he thought, in time have grown to
be somewhat of a domestic tyrant. Possibly his early possession
of wealth had done it, but there were lines around mouth and eyes
that spoke of great self-will, and a disposition to take
sacrifices on the part of those near him for granted, if not to
expect them. Pointer did not think that Anthony Revell would have
made ultra-generous settlements on any dowerless girl; or indeed
have been generous at all in money matters.</p>

<p>"What we can't find out," he now said confidentially, "is
where the rector spent the most of Sunday afternoon. At the
rectory they seem to think he spent the time at some almshouses
to which he went as usual. But he shortened his customary two
hours' stay there to half an hour. And left saying that he would
spend an hour on Monday with the old folk to make up for it. It's
not the first time he had had to alter his hours, but it was
unusual. And as I say, we can't trace the next four hours. He
left the rectory at two. He was at the almshouses by a quarter to
three, and left there at a quarter past. He got back to the
rectory by a quarter past seven. But where he went to in the
meanwhile&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's very important, surely?" Gilbert said.</p>

<p>Pointer replied that it might turn out to be so. It would all
depend. If he spent it with a brother clergyman, or at the
Bishop's Palace, for instance, it might not have much
significance.</p>

<p>Gilbert grinned an agreement, and then, thanking him for
letting him keep the key of The Causeway smoking-room, Pointer
rose to go. But at the door he turned with another question.</p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Green paying the whole purchase price of The Causeway
in cash?"</p>

<p>"Yes. That's why we're letting it go for a song. Why?"</p>

<p>"Just wanted to get an idea of her financial standing," he
said vaguely, but he drove on to the solicitor's office and was
franker.</p>

<p>"There may be nothing in it, but we've struck something rather
odd connected with Mrs. Green," he said to old Mr. Smith. "I
can't be more explicit till I know more, but I should mark time
about the deeds of the house, if I were you."</p>

<p>"Umph," said Mr. Smith dubiously, "I don't know about that,
Chief Inspector. Hurry them up, more likely. She hasn't put down
any deposit yet. What's sold is sold. 'Money has no smell,'" he
quoted. "You're trying to prove that she murdered Anthony Revell,
I suppose. Well, Chief Inspector, as the Coroner who sat on the
inquest on young Revell, I should think you're wrong, but for
your record. What have you got to go on, eh?"</p>

<p>"You'll hear it all in good time, sir. But don't say I didn't
warn you off Mrs. Green. You looked up her financial standing, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>Mr. Smith shook his polished head on which his hair grew like
close-clipped grass on the slopes of a glacis. "Nothing to look
up. She's paying in cash&mdash;bankers' draft. Good enough,
eh?"</p>

<p>"&mdash;to stop all questions? Quite," Pointer said dryly and
hurried away.</p>

<p>Curious how lacking in background Mrs. Green seemed to be. She
claimed to be the only child of a Dublin doctor whose wife had
died when she was born. She was absolutely without relatives, she
said, even her husband's people had quite died out. He was a
London solicitor who had died thirty years ago, one year after
their marriage. Left a very young widow, she had spent her life
chiefly abroad, except for this last year when she had tried to
stop in North Ireland, but found the climate too harsh for
her.</p>

<p>None of her statements could be proved or disproved. And she
was paying cash down for The Causeway, so that that transaction
too was of no help in finding out her past.</p>

<p>"Well," Weir-Opie said in some surprise, "it's
interesting&mdash;very. But what does it prove? Eh?"</p>

<p>"That's the riddle, sir," Pointer said, while Shilling looked
very profound.</p>

<p>"Why did she paint all those pictures in the first place, if
she was going to paint them all out?" the superintendent asked
finally.</p>

<p>"Exactly," Pointer spoke crisply. "Apparently Revell's death
turned things that before it had been harmless, into dangerous
things, things that must be hidden. Or else the idea was that the
police mustn't see the paintings."</p>

<p>"Bad as that?" Shilling asked with a look of shocked
interest.</p>

<p>Pointer had to laugh. "Not for any ordinary reason, Shilling.
That's the puzzle."</p>

<p>"You think that was why she locked herself into that room at
once?" the Major asked.</p>

<p>"I can't read the overpainting in any other way, sir, but that
the originals must not be seen."</p>

<p>"But they had been seen." Shilling saw that this was just what
the Chief Inspector was maintaining, and stopped himself.</p>

<p>"Exactly, by Mr. Revell's friends. Apparently only the police
was the danger."</p>

<p>"She flattered us!" Weir-Opie said sardonically, "Look here,"
Shilling's tone was quite excited, they were all dining again
with the Chief Constable and the coffee was on the table, "were
the original pictures signs to a gang? A sort of painted cipher?
Did they conceal a secret?"</p>

<p>"Clues to The Causeway treasure?" Weir-Opie asked with a
smile. "I never heard of its existence before these last days,
but every one is asking me about it now, as though its existence
were an established fact. Smith rang me up just before dinner to
know if that was why you wanted him to go slow over the sale to
Mrs. Green. Was that really why?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Only I thought that in a general way he might find
it better to go slow until the facts about the lady were clearer.
But if he thinks there's a question of letting a treasure go
cheap, he won't need any more warnings."</p>

<p>"But were the pictures clues, do you think?" persisted
Shilling, adding sagely, "They must have had <i>some</i>
meaning."</p>

<p>"If they were merely meant as signs, clues, ciphers," Pointers
said slowly, "I don't quite see why she took such pains over
them. Here are the enlarged photographs of them."</p>

<p>The Chief Constable looked at them with interest, so did
Shilling, whose face was more puzzled when he laid them down,
than when he took them up. Then he had another suggestion to
make. "Perhaps they were painted so well to prevent their being
taken away or changed by Revell?"</p>

<p>That was a possibility which had struck Pointer too. "Joyce
told me that the colours chosen for these, the originals, were
all of them 'unalterable' as he calls them. They won't fade with
time or light. And they are painted on metal.</p>

<p>"Of course," Pointer said after an interval, "her absolute
change of, shall we call it plan, seems at first sight to
exonerate Mrs. Green from any share in Revell's death."</p>

<p>"You mean it caught her out," Shilling said. "It does look
that way."</p>

<p>"But it might only mean," Pointer went on to say, "that
something unexpected, unforeseen, of which we know nothing, had
intervened, which had made the paintings not merely useless but
dangerous."</p>

<p>"Dangerous, umph..." meditated the Chief Constable.</p>

<p>"I've thought ever since I saw her, ever since the rector's
last sermon, that is, that Mrs. Green lives in dread of some one
or something. The latter I should say, since she does not seem in
the least nervous about living alone in a cottage, but for a
gardener near by." Pointer again had a long look at the pictures.
"Another funny thing is, that she claims never to have been in
Switzerland. I asked her about each country in turn when she said
that she had lived on the continent a great deal."</p>

<p>"Well? Why should she have been to Switzerland?" asked
Superintendent Shilling, but the Chief Constable's eyes told
Pointer that he understood.</p>

<p>"Revell didn't know it," Weir-Opie said now. "He always went
to Norway and Sweden for skiing and tobogganing, and to Holland
for skating. But I can see why you wondered that Mrs. Green
didn't own to knowing Switzerland well. These here"&mdash;he
pointed with his pipe stem&mdash;"are certainly Swiss."</p>

<p>"Just so, sir. Unmistakable Swiss chalets, aren't they. And
besides"&mdash;Pointer knew the country well, he was a great
climber&mdash;"these are Gentians. And here are St. Bruno lilies,
and mountain roses and the little wild violas you find everywhere
in the summer. And that's glacier water in those brooks. That
snow too on the one white-capped mountain is what people call
'eternal,' or I've never trodden it."</p>

<p>"Switzerland," murmured Shilling, eyeing the pictures again.
"All of them?"</p>

<p>"Every one."</p>

<p>"If you know the country, can't you make a guess as to the
place?" Shilling asked hopefully.</p>

<p>"It ought to be easy," Pointer agreed, "though as a matter of
fact I've never seen these particular scenes. Have you, sir?"</p>

<p>Weir-Opie had not.</p>

<p>Pointer said he would take the photographs back with him and
study them a bit. Then the talk drifted to other points of this
most perplexing case.</p>

<p>Pointer learnt that Mrs. Richard Avery had just had a sudden
summons to her mother in Tunbridge Wells, who again was reported
to be dying.</p>

<p>"Apart from affection, the old lady's said to be quite well
off, and not to have made a will yet. So I suppose none of her
children care to be away when she asks for them," suggested the
Chief Constable.</p>

<p>Doris had notified him of her departure, since she had not
been able to get into touch with Pointer.</p>

<p>Then the talk turned to other local matters, and Pointer went
back to the rooms that he had at the police station. Seating
himself at the table there, he spread out the photographs of the
under-paintings and looked carefully at them. He hoped to be able
to locate some of the places that they represented. At any rate
that of the central panel should be easy to find.

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15"></a>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h2>

<p class="first">THE belfry in it rose from what was clearly part
of a cathedral. A quaint red spire rose to one side. Old tiled
roofs, showing among green trees, sloped unevenly down to a great
blue lake far below, a vast lake that spread beyond the picture's
limits, with a range of mountains on the other side. Where in
Switzerland was there a cathedral town perched high above a big
lake with such a range of mountains beyond it?</p>

<p>Geneva was too flat. Besides, in the painting there was only
one far-off, tiny, snow-covered tip to be seen, not the whole
Mont-Blanc range. Basle has no such lake. Neither has Berne.
Zurich runs up to no such heights, has no such mountains facing
it. Then he thought of Lausanne. A town where he had never been.
A large town&mdash;on a lake, the Lake of Geneva&mdash;with a
cathedral. If so, that one snow mountain could be the extreme tip
of Mont Blanc.</p>

<p>Early next morning, he dropped in at the offices of the Swiss
Federal Railways in town, and satisfied himself that he was
right, that that central painting could only stand for the
capital of Canton Vaud. From the railway's guide-books and
folders, he even recognised the belfry and the quaint red spire
standing to one side on a lower level as that of the Church of
Saint Franois.</p>

<p>Why was Lausanne chosen for the largest painting? Why had it
and, according to Joyce, all the other paintings too been done
with such meticulous accuracy? Why did all the pictures have to
be obliterated? That was the crux to which he always came back.
Or rather the double crux, the careful painting first, and then
the concealment of what had been done with so much labour.</p>

<p>Pointer flew to Lausanne on the following day, after leaving
word to watch the little knot of people in whom he was interested
night and day, especially Olive Hill. Arrived at the Blecherette
aerodrome, he took a taxi, and told the chauffeur to drive him
for an hour or so through the town, so as to give him a general
idea of the place. The man was intelligent, and Pointer stopped
him once or twice and made a note of where they were, so certain
was he that he was passing near some view recorded in one or
other of the smaller pictures.</p>

<p>As for the cathedral belfry and the spire of Saint Franois,
he had already greeted them as old friends from the
aeroplane.</p>

<p>Incidentally, he was amazed at the beauty of the city
spreading over its hills of Pully, and Chailly, along the ridge
of Mon Repos up to the Chalet de Gobet, and sloping, down to the
lovely shore of Ouchy and the great Park of Denantou. He felt as
though the drive alone was worth the journey, though a chamois
seemed to have designed some of the rises and dips of the
streets.</p>

<p>Pointer placed Lausanne&mdash;in summer at any rate&mdash;far
ahead of Naples for sheer beauty of situation and for wonderful
range of colours. He had already got from the Swiss Railways the
name of the best Lausanne photographer, a firm that had been
there for seventy years. He drove to the shop and bought several
photographs. Then he asked if he could have a word with a member
of the firm itself. The youngish man who was serving him told him
that he himself was one of the junior partners, that the
photographs just bought were all his own work or that of his
elder brother, his father and uncles devoted themselves more to
the make and sale of photographic appliances. Pointer then showed
him the photographs of the under-paintings at The Causeway,
explaining that the pictures had been found painted on the walls
of a country house in England, and that he had come to Lausanne
for the express purpose of finding out what places they
represented.</p>

<p>The first one which the young Swiss picked up, was the central
view. "That's our cathedral and that's the spire of St. Franois
Church, but it was painted at least twenty years ago. That view
is now spoiled by the big Federal Bank put up at that time. And I
know where this one was painted from&mdash;the exact spot. It's a
view of the town from the <i>Square de l'Universit,</i> as it
was at least twenty years ago."</p>

<p>"You can't date it nearer than that?"</p>

<p>"I'll ask Gustav."</p>

<p>A moment later his elder brother came in and bent over the
photograph. "Parbleu, Henri, here's a bit of the Academie, as it
was before the roof was altered, and that was done years
ago."</p>

<p>The two brothers bent over the photographs. No one else was in
the shop and all the world loves to solve a puzzle. In the end
they were able to date the central picture for Pointer with
certainty as "painted thirty years ago."</p>

<p>Their father came in and added his confirmatory vote. Then the
rest of the photographs were studied one by one, located, and
dated. There were only four of which they were not sure, beyond
the certainty that they were painted somewhere in the Canton
Vaud, as was shown by the cattle and by the shape of the
cow-bells. None of them were of the French side of the Lake.</p>

<p>The curious thing was that all the dates of the paintings ran
from between thirty years ago to the present time, and that the
paintings ran consecutively along the walls, the oldest to the
left of the centre painting, the most recent being the painting
of <i>Place St. Franois</i> that joined it on the right of the
fireplace.</p>

<p>The oldest of the little paintings, which dated back to the
same time as the central painting, was not of Lausanne, but of a
little place near it on the lake called <i>Morgen,</i> where
there was now a large horticultural college. The parish church of
Morgen figured four times in all among the paintings, each at an
interval of ten years. Thirty years ago&mdash;twenty years
ago&mdash;ten years ago&mdash;and present time. Of the cathedral
there was only the large centre one and a small one done about
ten years later. The photographers were enchanted with the
paintings, father and sons vieing with each other to point out
this or that now vanished landmark. But as to who could have
executed the work, none of them could give a guess. Pointer found
to his surprise that it was going to be very difficult to find
out anything about a Mrs. Green. For two days, he visited the
heads of the various art schools without learning of any artist
who could possibly be her. As for the name itself dropped
casually, it meant nothing to these good Lausannois. On the
fourth day, Pointer decided to try Morgen. He had been told that
another of the landscapes was of the mountains as seen from
there, a view that was now blocked by the college, and had
certainly been painted, so the elder Carrard maintained, from the
parsonage garden itself.</p>

<p>Pointer had a private investigator, well known for his work at
Geneva, look up the question of the parsons of Morgen while he
was trying to find out about Mrs. Green. He learnt that the
present incumbent, Doctor Desvernois, was eighty-three years old,
a fine scholar and a great authority on Swiss dialects. His wife,
a Swiss lady, was still living. The only son of the marriage had
been professor of phonetics at the Lausanne University. He had
married a Miss Walker while very young. She was entered in the
records as of Birmingham, England, and at the time of the
marriage had been a student at Lausanne too. Her present age was
fifty-three. Pointer asked for all possible information about
this younger Madame Desvernois. There did not seem much to learn.
She had had six children. Two girls, now grown up, had married
very well indeed. One son had been killed with his father some
twenty years ago while mountain climbing. The bodies had both
been recovered and were buried at Morgen. An earlier son had been
still-born. The two younger children had died, and been buried,
in Zurich. More than this, the town records could not tell.</p>

<p>Pointer felt that he must continue the search himself. The
first step was to go out to Morgen, a pretty place, and send in
his card to the lady of the house asking permission to sketch the
mountains as seen from the garden.</p>

<p>Out came Madame Desvernois herself, a charming old lady who
deplored the shrinkage of what had once been a lovely view. "In
the old days, my daughter-in-law painted it many a time," she
added.</p>

<p>Pointer started his pencil sketch. He was an extremely
accurate draughtsman, though no artist. Pointer was always
shocked at the liberties that real artists took with views,
moving trees, and changing river banks, with incredible
casualness.</p>

<p>Madame Desvernois sat down and named some of the mountains
before them. Pointer brought the talk around to her
daughter-in-law's work. Would she allow him to see, from it,
what the view had once been?</p>

<p>The old lady promptly took him in and showed him, in the main
hall, a length of framed watercolours. Two of them were identical
with two views that Pointer had seen done in oils at The
Causeway, and of which he had the photographs in his pocket. He
asked if he might be allowed to ask the artist a question about
the way in which she secured a certain afterglow effect? He was
told that young Madame Desvernois was in England at the moment.
"She is English. This is her picture," she added in a rush of
smiling indiscretion, pointing to a framed photograph near the
staircase.</p>

<p>Pointer looked at the face of Mrs. Green, but young&mdash;and
gay. "A very young lady&mdash;" he murmured.</p>

<p>Madame laughed. "Would one not say so? Yet she is already a
grandmother. There might be ways of explaining that, but not in
her case. She never has, and I think she will never look anywhere
near her real age."</p>

<p>The woman whom Pointer had seen had looked every day of
fifty-three.</p>

<p>And then Madame led Pointer out again and begged him to draw
or paint from any part of the garden or orchard that he liked.
Could he draw the parsonage itself, he asked. It was old and very
picturesque. Certainly he could, and with that Pointer had to set
to work.</p>

<p>As Pointer sharpened his pencils he wished that he could
sharpen his wits at the same time and as easily. What was the
link between this little place on the Lake of Geneva and The
Causeway? Why did it figure in four paintings at intervals of ten
years or so. All of them painted in summer he had noticed, just
as, excepting for the circular painting, all the views of
Lausanne were of the autumn, spring, or winter. Why had Madame
Franois Desvernois changed her name to Green, and gone half
across Europe to paint these home scenes on the study walls of a
young man who had been afterwards found shot dead in his
drawing-room. And why had the artist, on his death, covered up her
work with what had seemed such desperate speed? Also, she was no
longer English, but Swiss, by marriage, yet she had not
registered as an alien. The penalty for not doing so is very
unpleasant. Why had she risked it?</p>

<p>She had apparently never met Revell before seeing him at The
Flagstaff. Or had she? Were both he and she acting the parts of
strangers? If so, what was the secret link? Apparently she
belonged to a most blameless section of society, yet she had gone
under an assumed name&mdash;Pointer went the full circle again.
Why were the pictures chiefly old? There were no dates on them.
Did they represent dates, and were the dates ciphers? But that
would presuppose an accomplice who knew the old Lausanne, and the
old parsonage here at Morgen...</p>

<p>Pointer put his things together, glad of the excuse of a sharp
shower. Back at Lausanne he arranged for a wireless to Scotland
Yard asking&mdash;in cipher&mdash;some questions about the
passport of Madame Franois Desvernois, adding her maiden name.
He got the answer within a couple of hours. From it he learnt
that she had landed in Dover two days before she appeared at The
Flagstaff. The Chief Constable was sure that she and Lady Revell
were strangers. Pointer asked him by cable many questions about
the Revells in the hope that one of them might lead him out of
the fog. Only one reply interested him, though he could not see
that it had any significance. Lady Revell had had three children.
The first, a girl, had been prematurely born in Paris at Neuilly,
after a motor accident, and had only lived a few hours. Lady
Revell's life had been despaired of, but she had finally, though
very slowly recovered. Then came the information that so
interested Pointer. That was that Anthony, the second child, had
been born at Evian les Bains. Now Evian is a smart French
watering-place on the Lake of Geneva, exactly opposite from
Lausanne, and steamers ply all afternoon long in summer between
the two. So Anthony had been born on the lake that figured so
often in the pictures. Yet not one of them was of Evian or its
surroundings. Pointer established that fact from direct questions
to the Lausanne photographers who had a branch at Evian to which
they went in August.</p>

<p>He returned to the parsonage garden of Morgen. Madame
Desvernois, who had taken a fancy to him, came out again and told
him little facts about the scene before him which would have
interested him greatly at any other time, but which he now looked
on merely as possible stepping-stones to inquiries about her
English daughter-in-law. He was able to inspect her paintings in
the hall a second time. He lingered over them, and finally said
that he hoped that if she had any children, they had inherited
their mother's great gift, for he considered these paintings the
work of a very remarkable artist, he said.</p>

<p>Madame Desvernois's worn, but still pretty, face lightened.
"She is indeed," she said warmly, "and very different would have
been the lot of her children but for that gift. She had no idea
of it when she married my son. She painted for pleasure to be
sure, but she intended to be a teacher of languages. It was only
after his death "&mdash;she described a fatal accident in the
mountains&mdash;"that she felt she had to do something. She gave
shows of her pictures at Lausanne, at Berne, and finally at
Zurich. Selling, oh so few, and for such low prices! But at
Zurich she heard of the Cantonal prize for the best original
designs for Swiss lace curtains. She sent in some designs, and
with that success&mdash;for she won it&mdash;she found her real
metier. You may have heard of the <i>Schweitzer Atelier</i> in
Zurich that turns out all the best designs for lace curtains of
every kind? It is my daughter-in-law's. She has her work promised
for years ahead. She is well-to-do now, and all as the result of
her talents."</p>

<p>Pointer talked on. He saw no light yet, but light was
certainly to be found, shining behind the cloud of mystery, of
that he felt sure.</p>

<p>"I will show you the portrait that she painted of my son when
they married. I think it a wonderful piece of work." And Madame
Desvernois led Pointer into her own sitting-room. There, over the
mantel, was a painting of Franois Desvernois, at which Pointer
gazed long and intently.</p>

<p>And as he gazed, the light grew clearer and clearer. He might
not be able to prove what he saw in that picture, but he knew
that he was reading it aright.</p>

<p>"He is like a young man who died recently in England," he said
finally.</p>

<p>"Really?" Madame Desvernois looked sceptical. "He was the
handsomest young man in all the Canton," she said proudly. "So
handsome that I used to fear for him. But he had an angel's
character. Besides, we were poor, very poor, and I think that may
have helped&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pointer held out the photograph of Anthony Revell, which had
originally had beside it a portrait of Mrs. Green. It was taken
from a snapshot procured for him by Major Weir-Opie before he
left England. Madame Desvernois looked at it with interest.</p>

<p>"He <i>is</i> very like the portrait, isn't he?" Pointer said
lightly.</p>

<p>"Like?" Madame Desvernois was not sure. "Like?
Yes&mdash;perhaps&mdash;a little&mdash;a very little.
Yes&mdash;there is a distinct resemblance. Yes. I see what you
mean. Yes, he is like Franoise's son&mdash;the one who was
killed in that accident. My daughter-in-law had only the one son.
Another younger one was stillborn. I never saw him." The old lady
liked to talk of her family. "He was born in Lausanne before they
had to leave the University. My son had to give up his work," she
went on, "that was the black year as we always call it, though my
daughter-in-law will never refer to it. The bank failed with all
our savings in it, so that we had nothing to help the children
when they needed it so badly! That was why the baby was born
dead&mdash;his mother was in such grief. They came here to us
afterwards heart-broken. But heaven helped. Her grandmother left
her some money which let them all go to Leysin for two years,
where my son was quite, quite cured. Then the Lausanne University
asked him to come back to a better post&mdash;as Professor of
Phonetics, which was his ambition. Oh, yes, the bad year was made
good, though Eva&mdash;my daughter-in-law will never agree that
that was so."</p>

<p>Pointer took his leave saying that he was going on to Zurich
and should certainly do himself the pleasure of calling at the
Ateliers but for the fact that Madame Franois Desvernois would
not be there. They parted quite regretfully, did Pointer and the
old lady, after he had been allowed to take some photographs of a
couple of the sketches in the hall. They happened to hang on
either side of Madame Franois Desvernois's portrait, so that her
likeness was taken, too.</p>

<p>Back in Lausanne, he tried to find out who was the doctor or
the nurse who had attended Madame Desvernois thirty years ago
when her first son had been born. Apparently there had been no
doctor. The nurse, a registered midwife, had died some years ago.
But her address was entered as of Evian-les-Bains as well as of
Lausanne. And, moreover, she had come from Neuilly-sur-Seine
&mdash;Neuilly, the suburb of Paris, where Lady Revell's
little girl had been born. An inquiry of the Neuilly town
records, and Pointer learnt that the same woman had nursed Lady
Revell then too. Possibly Lady Revell had come to Evian because
of her. Here at last was a demonstrable link between Mrs. Green
and Lady Revell. It was a vital one, Pointer thought, for he felt
certain that Anthony Revell was the son of Professor Franois
Desvernois. The professor's young wife, faced with the prospect
of still another child to bring up at a time when there must have
already been the greatest difficulty about bringing up the two
they already had, and faced too with the very sick husband to
whom she longed to give a chance of regaining his health in a
sanatorium, had, he believed, agreed to sell her baby to Lady
Revell if it should be a boy. The midwife, appealed to by the
latter, would be the carrier-out of all the necessary
formalities. The trail, it was true, ended in the death of the
nurse, but from the locality where she had died, and from the
grave where she lay, it looked as though she had been unusually
well-to-do for a woman in her position. Her son, too, was a
"fonctionaire" it appeared. He had been sent to Lysee. Pointer
thought that it looked as though the nurse had been well paid by
Lady Revell for her help in substituting Madame Franois
Desvernois's child for either a non-existent, or a dead baby. The
former, probably, for further replies to cipher cables told him
that Lady Revell's father-in-law had spoken of his intention of
leaving his huge fortune to the first grandson to be born him. Of
his four children at the time, one was an unmarried woman of
fifty, two sons were married but had no children. Admiral, or as
he then was, Commodore, Revell's wife, Lady Revell, had no living
child, and the doctors doubted whether she could ever have
another. It was quite easy to understand that, given a character
which would not baulk at the deception and the lies involved, and
given the opportunity, Lady Revell had done what she doubtless
considered a very clever thing. Her husband had just been sent to
a China station. It must have been easy for her to spend the
necessary time in quiet places abroad, then go to Evian,
ostensibly to have her baby, and come home with a boy, whom she
presented to the grandfather, and later to her husband, as
Anthony Revell, the first grandson.</p>

<p>Yes, Pointer felt that he had solved the reason for those
paintings and their overpainting. The real mother had not
forgotten her baby. She had evidently insisted on knowing to whom
the child had been handed. Lady Revell, on the other hand, he
believed, did not know the mother's name, or had been told a
false one by the midwife. Madame Franois Desvernois had gone to
London, dropped her own name, and as a Mrs. Green appeared with a
good excuse at what she would think was her son's home. She had
loved him when she saw him, but she had kept to her bargain, and
indeed any revealing of herself was impossible for Anthony
Revell's sake. She had evidently determined though that he should
have some reminder of his birthplace. Putting her soul into her
work, she had reproduced on his walls, not fairy tales, but the
scenes with which he would have been familiar had he lived in his
real home. There were some little figures introduced every now
and then. Pointer recognised old Madame Desvernois in one. The
others, he thought, were probably those of the father,
grandfather, and the brother and sisters.</p>

<p>Yes, the paintings were explained, and that exactness in them
which Mr. Joyce deplored. What Mrs. Green wanted and had secured,
was as close a reproduction as possible to what Anthony would
have seen had he remained the little Desvernois of Lausanne.</p>

<p>And explained, too, was her desire to cover them up, when the
police were investigating the strange death of the young man. She
had feared that they might do just what they had done, and lead
the police on to the trail of who Anthony was, or rather who he
was not.</p>

<p>He flew home next morning, and in the late afternoon motored
out to see the Major.</p>

<p>Weir-Opie listened very silently to what Pointer had to
say.</p>

<p>"Well played, Pointer!" he said heartily, when the former had
finished. There had been a time when that had been an often-heard
shout on the football ground. "To think we had the same chance of
noticing that those paintings hadn't been varnished as you had,
and didn't realise what it meant! This explains Lady Revell's
growing dislike of Anthony, when Gilbert was born twelve years
later. She had herself put the cuckoo in the nest and could not
now disown it. And now, what of her new position, eh?" Major
Weir-Opie said slowly and meaningly.</p>

<p>"Anthony Revell found dead at The Causeway just a few weeks
before a wedding would have meant a will cutting out Lady Revell
and Gilbert from any likelihood of sharing in a large fortune. No
wonder that Lady Revell was quite indifferent as to whom Anthony
intended to marry...</p>

<p>"It's hard lines on Gilbert Revell," Weir-Opie said finally as
Superintendent Shilling hurried in. The Chief Constable had sent
a word over the telephone to him. He heard in a silence that was
eloquent what Pointer had learnt at Lausanne.</p>

<p>"Then Gilbert Revell was done out of his grandfather's money
by the so-called Anthony! And now Olive Hill has been done out of
it&mdash;but no, she hasn't been done out of anything but her
young man&mdash;for the money never was Anthony's by rights."</p>

<p>As far as Anthony and the fortune left him were concerned,
Pointer did not think that the position was so simple. For the
money left to the so-called Anthony Revell by his equally
so-called grandfather had been left him because of the old man's
affection for the boy of ten.</p>

<p>Pointer had read the letter that had accompanied the will, a
letter kept by Anthony and found docketed by Major Weir-Opie, and
knew that between the boy and old Sir Henry Revell had been a
strong, deep, affection. True, Sir Henry had thought that he was
leaving his money to his only grandson, but it was chiefly
because of his love for Anthony that he had left it to him. That
was what made the problem so difficult.</p>

<p>"Like you, Pointer, I don't believe Lady Revell knows who Mrs.
Green is," Weir-Opie said suddenly out of a cloud of smoke, "for
she really believes that she was in love with Anthony. We know
now why Mrs. Green hung around the lad as she did. Poor soul!
Especially as you say he was very like her husband in looks."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder, sir, if that was why she hasn't let any
one see of late the portrait of Anthony Revell which she painted.
It may have been much more like his father than like him."</p>

<p>"Yes, but does the real mother suspect the sham mother, and is
that why she hangs around the place?" Shilling asked curiously.
"Is all her talk against Miss Hill just camouflage? The necklace
you found, the one with which you believe that Mr. Avery smashed
the jar with stamps in it, becomes immensely important now. Lady
Revell denies that she went to the rectory at any time that last
Sunday," Pointer said slowly.</p>

<p>It was now Saturday.</p>

<p>"Fraser and the maids deny the possibility that the necklace
was left behind on any earlier visit," he continued, "and the
dust-free condition of the room supports them. I'd like to have a
talk to Mrs. Green first of all. She may know something which she
didn't dare tell us, for fear of coming too far forward into the
limelight. That fear of hers&mdash;that restraining fear&mdash;we
know now that it was terror of our finding out about her
relationship to Anthony Revell&mdash;not terror of our learning
fresh facts about how he died. I believe no one wants that
cleared up more than she does."</p>

<p>"'For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup; and the wine is
red,'" quoted Weir-Opie dreamily.</p>

<p>"Red for whom? I don't think she suspects Lady Revell, sir,"
Pointer replied, "but that may simply be because she daren't. I
take it that nothing fresh has turned up in the case?" But
Pointer knew that otherwise he would not have been allowed to
tell his own tale uninterrupted for so long.</p>

<p>"Nothing. Mrs. Richard Avery returned early this morning. Just
in time for the funeral, at which nothing of any interest to you
happened, though the whole countryside turned out for it, and
Shilling and I were a bit unpopular because the poisoner wasn't
behind bolts and bars. Miss Avery asked after you. Whether from
personal affection, or because something was stirring in her that
would like to get out. I can't say. Miss Hill was at the service,
but didn't go to the churchyard. She's looking better."</p>

<p>"Were the Revells there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly. Both of them. So was Mrs. Green."</p>

<p>Mrs. Green also had looked better, Shilling thought, but Lady
Revell might have just come back from a health cruise, so marked
was the improvement in her looks. "Odd, ain't it?" Shilling wound
up "the last thing to expect of the rector's death would have
been that it apparently has relieved so many people's
anxieties."</p>

<p>"In Lady Revell's case prematurely, I fancy," Weir-Opie said
dryly as Pointer rose to go.</p>

<p>"But would any letter of hers to Mr. Anthony, if found by the
rector, have shocked him so?" Shilling suddenly struck in. "As
his mother, why shouldn't she write asking him to come back? Mr.
Avery wouldn't have dreamt of connecting her with her son's
death, unless she wrote some threat which would certainly not
have brought Mr. Anthony racing home for a talk."</p>

<p>"But if she wrote about some one else&mdash;if she used that
as a decoy&mdash;then the rector's shock would have been that
Lady Revell had kept the letter&mdash;and the
appointment&mdash;secret," suggested Weir-Opie. He glanced at
Pointer.</p>

<p>"We are agreed that Miss Hill wasn't mentioned in the letter
by name, sir," said Pointer as he hurried off.

<h2><a name="ch16"></a>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h2>

<p class="first">JAMIESON opened the front door on the Chief
Inspector with obvious pleasure. "I'm glad you have the key of
the smoke-room, sir. Rare fuss Mrs. Green had been making. She's
proper wild at the police having it."</p>

<p>"That's only natural, seeing that those paintings in there are
her work," Pointer said casually.</p>

<p>"A lady as could fly off the handle like that for a trifle,
isn't one I'm going to serve." Jamieson shook his head in
renunciation absolute and complete.</p>

<p>Pointer tipped him in proportion to the hurt to his feelings
and went on into the smoking-room himself. He was only just in
time, for a car could be heard coming up the drive.</p>

<p>Pointer waited. He heard Jamieson's greeting, and Mrs. Green's
inquiry as to whether the police had yet given up the room.</p>

<p>"The Chief Inspector is in it now, madam," Jamieson said with
relief in his voice, "waiting to see you about it," with which
added embroidery, he opened the door for her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Green took one step inside, and stopped as though a snake
were in the room. Jamieson closed the door and went on down the
passage. Slowly, as though all her muscles had stiffened with the
shock, Mrs. Green turned her head, and looked from the pictures
to Pointer, anguish and terror in her eyes. As he said nothing,
only bowed stiffly, she stared again at her paintings which faced
her as they had been originally, free of the overpaint.</p>

<p>"Yes, we had them cleaned," he said quietly, "but let me get
you a chair." He went to the door to return a moment later with a
chair of Jamieson's which he placed for Mrs. Green at the farther
extremity of the room. "Yes, Madame Desvernois," he went on
gently, "I've just got back from Lausanne and Morgen. I know now
who Anthony Revell really was. When and where he was born."</p>

<p>"So the rector left a message behind!" she said in a sort of
gasp.</p>

<p>"Not at all. The pictures told me. I saw your paintings in
your home at Morgen&mdash;I was shown your portrait. Then, too,
the dates tallied. Lady Revell in Evian, you just across the
lake. The same midwife&mdash;who had previously been with Lady
Revell when her child was born in Paris. Your own very great
trouble&mdash;Lady Revell's doubtless most tempting offer coming
just then through the nurse&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Green put out her hand to stop him. "It's true," she said
under her breath. "And true also that had my son borne his own
name he would be alive to-day." She covered her face, all broken
up, with her hands. "Nothing you can say can hurt me like that
knowledge."</p>

<p>"How do you mean?" Pointer asked, as though surprised.</p>

<p>"What else did Olive Hill want but the position? The
money?"</p>

<p>There was a short silence.</p>

<p>"And now are you going to prove that she shot my boy?" she
said in a voice that trembled with excitement. "I will stand
whatever comes out about me, if you can prove that."</p>

<p>"Are you sure that it wasn't an accident?" he countered.</p>

<p>Mrs. Green gave a laugh in which there was no merriment.</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>"It was all a mistake&mdash;my trying to get to know him
without his knowing who I was. I thought I had managed it so
cleverly coming as Mrs. Green&mdash;Lady Revell had never seen
me. I am a painter of some merit&mdash;she had pictures worth
copying. It would rouse no suspicions in her if a Mrs. Green
called at The Flagstaff when she <i>happened</i> to be in the
village, and asked if she could copy them. I could meet Anthony
there&mdash;as I did. When I found that he had his own home, and
I got him to let me paint some panels for his smoking-room, and
stay there while I worked, I thought I was in heaven. As I was at
first. Though "&mdash;a flush rose and faded in her worn
face&mdash;"I had purposely made myself look as young as
possible&mdash;on account of not arousing any suspicions in Lady
Revell. And so people&mdash;she among others&mdash;misunderstood.
Even Anthony did, when I warned him against that odious girl. A
horrible position," her eyes grew sombre. "Horrible position!"
she repeated under her breath. "I never did anything harder than
when I let him think me just a jealous middle-aged woman who had
fallen in love with him, and didn't want to see another, younger,
woman win him away from me. And worse was to come when he got
engaged to Olive Hill, and I knew what the future would hold for
him, married to her. I realised that I had sold him into
bondage." She paused for a moment, her face very white.</p>

<p>Pointer said nothing. He was intensely sorry for her.</p>

<p>"He was a Swiss boy," she went on passionately in French, "a
Lausannois boy. He had a right to the simple happy life that our
other children had. And because of what I did, he had to live
here in another country, with a so-called mother who hated him,
and grudged him every piece of luck that came his way. And that
girl&mdash;How could he but take sham for real affection, he, who
had never had any true love that he could remember? I couldn't
even put his own name on his grave. He lies there under a false
one."</p>

<p>"And the text you chose?" he asked gently.</p>

<p>"The vengeance of God," she said swiftly. There was more in
the same strain. Pointer did not try to stop her. He let her
breaking heart pour itself out, she, who for so many weeks had
had to suffer in silence.</p>

<p>"But the rector learnt the truth about Anthony's birth, and, I
feel sure, about his death too," she said finally in a shaken
whisper. "How he learnt it I have no idea. He preached that
sermon straight at Olive Hill&mdash;and at me. He wanted me to
tell&mdash;however late, the truth which would let justice be
done. And now&mdash;whatever he knew has been buried with him!"
she said almost fiercely.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you immediately on hearing his sermon go and tell
him all the truth, and let him use that knowledge as he wanted
to?" Pointer asked. "Since you think he had you in his mind when
he preached his last sermon?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Green looked at him in pallid shame.</p>

<p>"What of my daughters? What of my father and mother? I can't
let them know the truth."</p>

<p>She set her jaw firmly. "Think of the deception of all these
years! My people would never understand&mdash;never forgive what
I did. I've always been afraid it might come to that. But if I am
sent to prison for letting Lady Revell foist my son on her family
as her own, I shall go as Mrs. Green."</p>

<p>"I hope it won't have to come out," Pointer said, dubiously.
If it was Lady Revell who had shot Anthony and poisoned the
rector, the whole truth about Anthony's parentage must be told in
court.</p>

<p>"But the rector," he went on, "how could he have learnt the
truth about your son?"</p>

<p>"That is what I cannot understand," Mrs. Green said. "That was
why I turned back when I was half-way to his house on Sunday
evening. Yes, the gardener was telling the truth. He did see me
leaving the garden then. I was suddenly not sure whether the
rector meant&mdash;besides Olive Hill&mdash;me or Lady Revell? I
thought he might have learnt from something she said after
Anthony's death about him&mdash;that he was not, could not be,
her son, and yet not know that he was mine. It's quite possible
that she went too far when talking to him, showed too clearly her
lack of any love for Anthony. Mr. Avery could be very quick in
some matters, I am sure; he was too like my own father for me not
to realise that. That was why I met him as little as possible. I
always felt that if he saw me and Anthony much together he would
guess the truth. And his sermon showed he guessed at least part
of it."</p>

<p>There was silence for a few minutes. Pointer asked her if she
knew where Lady Revell had been on both nights in which he was
interested.</p>

<p>Mrs. Green looked very surprised. She had no idea.</p>

<p>At The Flagstaff, she had slept at the other end of a
different wing from Lady Revell's room. And the furnished cottage
that she had taken&mdash;as she could not tear herself away from
the place where her son had&mdash;she felt sure&mdash;been
murdered, was away from The Flagstaff or rectory.</p>

<p>"My own opinion is," she went on sombrely, "that the rector
called Olive Hill to account on Sunday afternoon, met her by
chance, possibly outside the rectory&mdash;I hear that you still
do not know how he spent part of the afternoon&mdash;and showed
his knowledge of what she had done. Mr. Avery would have a very
stern side to him. I suspect that he gave her the choice between
herself telling the police, or his telling them."</p>

<p>Pointer said nothing for a moment. Then he asked her what
reason Olive Hill could have had for shooting Anthony Revell.</p>

<p>"Jealousy of me," Mrs. Green said forlornly. "A quarrel over
me. I suppose she said that she never wanted to see me in her
house, and he put in some kind word&mdash;he was conscious of a
strong attraction to me. Though he did not guess its reason."</p>

<p>"But that would hardly explain her shooting a man who was
about to raise her from dependence to ease and independence. You
know, Mrs. Green, in the mind of any one else, all the facts
about you and Mr. Anthony suggest quite another person as the
murderer of your son. I wonder you haven't thought so
yourself."</p>

<p>"Whom?" she asked fiercely.</p>

<p>"A woman who stood to gain much and lose nothing. Unlike Miss
Hill. I am thinking of Lady Revell. You who loved your own boy so
dearly will know how strong her resentment might have been at the
difference in position, in wealth, between her own, and her
supposed child. And if Mr. Anthony should marry, her
son&mdash;and also she herself&mdash;would have probably no
chance whatever of inheriting."</p>

<p>"Not Olive Hill!" It was characteristic of her dislike of the
girl that it was the possibility of her innocence and not the
possible guilt of Lady Revell which was the first thing to strike
Mrs. Green. "You think she's not the one?" she repeated. And
then, as he did not answer, her mind at last turned to
consideration of the one whom he had suggested as being guilty.
For a long minute she sat quite still. Then he saw her face turn
pale again, as pale as it had when he first spoke her own
name.</p>

<p>"If you're right, then it was I who really murdered my son,"
she said finally in a voice of horror. "As I have felt from the
first that I had. Antoine Desvernois didn't stand between any one
and a fortune, between any woman's real son and the inheritance
which rightly belonged to him. But poor Anthony Revell did."</p>

<p>There followed another pause.</p>

<p>"Olive Hill wrote to him asking him to come back at once and
meet her in The Causeway drawing-room at midnight precisely on
that dreadful Thursday night." So far she still spoke with
certainty. "But you think&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I think that Miss Hill's name may have only been used as a
decoy," Pointer said. "As yet I can see no reason for thinking
that she knew of, let alone had any hand in, his death."</p>

<p>Again there was a silence, then Mrs. Green spoke again, in a
tone of stifled horror.</p>

<p>"After she left, you think that Lady Revell came and killed my
son? And he's buried in that name&mdash;though I made it as small
as I dared. And Lady Revell wears black for him!"</p>

<p>Again a pause.</p>

<p>"So it was Lady Revell whom the rector talked to last Sunday
afternoon," Mrs. Green went on in a low voice.</p>

<p>Pointer doubted this, but it was possible.</p>

<p>"What he said must have been very definite for her to have
done what she did," Mrs. Green went on as though talking to
herself. "She has a savage nature, Chief Inspector. I don't mean
by that cruel. I don't think that Patricia Revell is cruel at
all. But she considers, in some odd way, that laws aren't for
her, that anything she does becomes inevitably the best that
could have been done in the circumstances. When she does anything
wrong she blames the circumstances for having forced her
hand."</p>

<p>This was very much Pointer's own view of Lady Revell's
character. But he saw many qualifications. The important fact was
that his discoveries in Lausanne had drawn a full confession as
to Anthony's birth. She went on to explain the intention of the
pictures. Just as he had guessed. It was to bring before Anthony
Revell the places that he would have seen as a child, as a boy,
and as a. young man had he stayed where he was born. Mrs. Green
had pretended to him that one was the house of the Seven Bears,
that another was the home of Red Riding Hood, merely to allay her
own nervousness that some one might be struck by their un-English
aspects. When she heard of his death, her first thought had not,
however been, as Pointer had fancied, fear of discovery. That had
seemed to her impossible with only the paintings as a guide, but
the determination that what she had meant for her son to enjoy
was not for others, especially not for Lady Revell and her son.
That was why she had so hurriedly but so completely obliterated
the loving work of weeks with a couple of hours' slap-dash
strokes.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's been a horrible circle. I couldn't speak. Silence
was part of the sale&mdash;part of what I had taken that money
for. Just as Lady Revell had sworn to love my baby as her own.
But the difference is, I kept my word, she broke hers."</p>

<p>"Not at first, I understand," Pointer said gently.</p>

<p>Mrs. Green gave a weary sigh. "No, not at first," she agreed.
"She meant to keep it. But&mdash;of course, when she had a child
of her own&mdash;everything was different. She believed when she
bought Antoine that she could never have another baby. But fate
knew better."</p>

<p>Pointer asked her one more question bearing on her story. Her
portrait of Anthony Revell, had it been a failure?</p>

<p>She was surprised at the question, but not apparently
disturbed.</p>

<p>"In some odd way, the longer I worked at it the more it turned
into a portrait of his father. At last it was too unlike, and yet
too like, Anthony for me to dare to show it to any one. I have
had it boxed up and sent to Zurich."</p>

<p>As for the paintings Pointer told her he would be much obliged
if she did nothing about them for the present. He had no right to
ask this, as he had not taken formal charge of them as
"exhibits," and in fact it mattered very little what became of
them. The photographs which he had had initialled by Mr. Joyce
could be produced in court if need be, and sworn to by three
witnesses. But it was the facts to which they had led him, not
the paintings in themselves which were of interest.</p>

<p>As to her stay in England under another name, he sketched the
steps he would take on her behalf so as to immediately regularise
this. She had only been here four months in all.</p>

<p>When he left her, he went to see Superintendent Shilling. The
Chief Constable was up in town. Shilling was immensely relieved
to hear that Mrs. Green was not going to prove troublesome, by
which he meant obstinate.</p>

<p>Pointer left with him his notes of the interview, and went on
for a word with Lady Revell. But she was out on one of those long
swift tiring drives to which she had taken since the death of
Anthony.</p>

<p>Mrs. Green only stayed a short time longer at The Causeway.
She telephoned to the indignant Mr. Smith that she was changing
her mind about buying the house. She had not definitely promised
to take it&mdash;as he knew. She would like to think it over for
another week yet. The solicitor reminded her of the many slips
due to procrastination, of the immense demand for houses of this
kind just now, of the fact that the incredible price which the
Revels were prepared to accept for an immediate sale might easily
be raised any moment&mdash;"and so on, and so forth," as he
himself expressed it when repeating the conversation to Gilbert.
But Mrs. Green only said at the end that she was sorry, but she
feared that she had let herself be swept away by a liking for a
house which she began to realise was not an easy one to run, and
by the charm of a locality which was not proving as paintable as
she had at first thought. She did not tell him that she now
realised that for her to settle in the locality would be
impossible since the police knew her story, even though she had
intended but to live there for six months of the year, and in
Zurich six months. She was very shaken by the interview which she
had just had. Thankful in a way that the clever Chief
Inspector&mdash;whose personality had impressed her at her first
glance&mdash;had discovered the truth. And yet deeply disturbed
at the price that she might yet have to pay for that thirty-year
old transaction which at the time had seemed so providential. But
she had never known a happy day since, or at least, not a happy
week. Anthony had been a lovely baby. He had been born at dawn,
and for one hour he had lain in the hollow of her arm. Then she
had let the nurse take him away in return for what seemed
salvation in English bank-notes counted out on her bed. And in
the cot where her other children had lain, the cot made ready for
the third child&mdash;was laid the waxen little form of a still-born
infant, born during the night to a washerwoman in Ouchy. The
nurse had promised to lay it in the coffin of an old lady who
would be buried to-day. Instead, she had had the little body with
her when she came to Madame Franois Desvernois, just as she had
had the money ready. And it had sometimes seemed to the young
wife that of all her children none was more constantly with her
than little Antoine. She had got the name of the new "mother"
from the French woman, and had verified it by a telephone inquiry
an hour after the nurse would have reached Evian. More than the
name she did not know until she came to England this year, a
well-to-do woman, able to take as long a holiday as she wished.
At the Revells' town house, located by means of the telephone
directory, it was easy to learn the whereabouts of their country
house in Surrey. And the rest was as Pointer knew.</p>

<p>Now she asked herself bitterly why she had come. True, she had
talked to Anthony, had even kissed him once good-bye, but what
little pleasure she had had was woven and striped with bitterness
and painful misunderstanding. Regret, unavailing and futile, rent
her.

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17"></a>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h2>

<p class="first">POINTER walked back the short distance to the
rectory, and asked for Miss Avery. She was engaged for the
moment, and he went on into the study. It was his conviction that
Mr. Avery when he felt himself ill, when he found the door
locked, when no bell rang, had left some writing for the police.
But so far not the most diligent search had found anything of the
sort. So there were possibly two missing papers&mdash;the folded
paper opened by the rector in the pulpit, and a posthumous
message left by the dying man for the police. But though he
looked for the latter he had not much hope of ever coming on it.
Finally, after another intensive search of the wallpaper behind a
bookshelf, he stood looking at his shoes, lost in reverie.</p>

<p>Pointer thought that the shooting of Revell had not been a
prepared crime. It had been a very dangerous one. It had, to his
mind, every mark of some swift decision, some sudden urgency.
Lady Revell would have had time to plan something much safer. Yet
it was possible that reflection had shown her no better way to
get rid of Anthony than the one taken. After all, even if a
criminal, she was not a practised criminal.</p>

<p>He had spoken to Mrs. Green as though Olive Hill were out of
the range of suspicion, but that was not really the case. Mrs.
Green herself&mdash;yes. In her case Pointer did not think that
she need any longer be considered suspect. She had nothing to
gain by the murder of her son, a son whom she evidently had loved
very dearly. But the motive of jealousy still existed as one of
the most likely reasons for Anthony Revell's death, though Mrs.
Green no longer fitted in. Lady Revell logically took Mrs.
Green's place. But both women, and if another suspect, Lady
Witson were included&mdash;all three women had shown themselves
as absolutely unconcerned about any papers at the rectory.</p>

<p>Yet Pointer felt that he was not doing the murdered rector
justice if he had not tried in his last hour to find some really
safe hiding-place for the paper that he had opened in the pulpit.
Unlike any statement of Mr. Avery's own, it&mdash;Pointer
believed&mdash;was tantamount to proof of the wilful murder of
Anthony&mdash;in the eyes of the criminal. Would the poisoner,
flustered, hurried, terrified of detection, have been able to
find what a really clever man had hidden? Pointer felt that he
could trust Mr. Avery to have set the searcher a stiff
proposition. There was a safe in the rector's bedroom, but Avery
had not been able to get to it after his supper. Though Pointer
was beginning to think that the new rector might have put the
paper into safety before that. The bedroom, too, like the attic,
had been hunted as for an indispensable needle...From the way in
which the study had been searched by the criminal, Pointer was
sure that Mr. Avery had shown&mdash;or read&mdash;the folded
paper to him or her, who had promptly, Pointer believed, given
some specious explanation which would not hold water if tested,
but which had apparently allayed Mr. Avery's doubts for the
moment. The calmness of the writing on St. Paul left by the dead
rector, and the hearty supper taken, made Pointer sure that an
explanation, rather than a confession, had taken place.</p>

<p>Mrs. Green still believed that Olive Hill had been the writer
of the note bringing Anthony back. From what Anthony appeared to
have said to Mrs. Green, he had expected to meet his fiance in
the drawing-room. But Pointer thought that Mrs. Green might have
quite misunderstood the hurried, and doubtless irritable, words
spoken by the surprised Anthony, when he found her hovering
around his front door that Thursday night. Pointer saw no reason
to think that Miss Hill had been near The Causeway on the night
in question, but as he thought it very likely that some veiled
reference to her had been used to get Anthony back so swiftly,
therefore any specious explanation made to Mr. Avery on Sunday
night would probably have been a shelving of all responsibility
on to her. A responsibility which she would certainly repudiate
at the first question put to her by the rector.</p>

<p>Miss Avery came in at that moment, and, looking very troubled,
asked Pointer to sit down, as she had a very painful thing to say
to him.</p>

<p>Grace prefaced the talk by saying that she had no idea how it
could interest the police, but she had decided at the funeral of
her brother to do as Pointer had asked her, and pass on any
information in her possession, however far-fetched it might seem,
and with that, she told him about her doubts of Miss Hill's
honesty. He listened very attentively. He knew what apparently
Miss Avery did not, that Miss Hill wanted to join Mr. Byrd's band
of pioneers, and that in order to do so, she would have to pay
into a common fund a hundred pounds. Money which Mr. Byrd gave a
guarantee to repay should the expedition not start within three
months of the time set.</p>

<p>In the questions that followed, he learnt from Grace of her
own wild idea as to what might have really happened at The
Causeway.</p>

<p>He asked if he could see Miss Hill, but learnt that she had
been fetched by Gilbert Revell for a drive as he thought that she
looked ill. "That's why I let you drag out of me my horrible
nightmare fear of how Anthony may have died," she added
meaningly. Then she had to leave him. But first she asked him
whether he could wait for Doris, who would be in almost at once,
and who also very much wanted a word with the Chief Inspector.
Pointer decided to wait. A last question of Grace brought the
answer that she still had no faintest idea of where her brother
had spent the hours, yet unaccounted for on last Saturday and
Sunday afternoon. After hearing which, Pointer put in some work
on the library floor. As he searched for every loose board and
cranny, he thought over what he had just learnt about Miss Hill.
It might explain a small puzzle within the infinitely larger
one.</p>

<p>On the table on which the rector's supper-tray had stood last
Sunday, the police had found a small carved wooden box about the
length and depth of a middle finger, and the breadth of three. It
had a hinged top and was quite empty. One corner had been deeply
and recently dented, and there was a newly made mark on the
woodwork at the side of the window which seemed to fit the dented
corner.</p>

<p>Fraser said that he had first noticed the box when he brought
in the supper tray. It was then on the table at the head of the
couch, and therefore close to the door leading into the hall. No
one seemed to have ever seen it until Miss Hill, on being shown
it, immediately claimed it as hers. She said that she must have
left it by accident in the study when she stepped in during the
afternoon. She had not missed it, she said, as it was just an
empty little box which she had at some time or other taken down
to the morning-room, and which on Sunday she had at last meant to
take back to her bedroom. She spoke with a certain tense
affectation of carelessness, but Pointer had felt sure that
something about it had both moved and perplexed her
greatly&mdash;just at first. For that reason, he had not yet
returned it to her. She had not tried to take it away from the
study table, often though she had been in there. Nor did she seem
to pay it any further attention. Yet what had puzzled people even
for a short time without their speaking of it, always interested
the Chief Inspector.</p>

<p>It was odd that two articles&mdash;a necklace and a
box&mdash;neither of which belonged to the study, should have
been found there in the morning, though only one had been seen in
the room on the night before. What Grace Avery had told him might
account for that, and for the puzzled feeling which he felt sure
Olive Hill had suppressed with some difficulty when he had first
let her handle the box on the Monday morning, for it was possible
that Olive had taken Lady Revell's necklace. It was just the kind
of trinket to which, in her own case, Grace Avery suspected that
Olive had helped herself more than once.</p>

<p>It now seemed likely that the necklace had been inside the box
when Fraser had noticed it&mdash;closed&mdash;on the little
occasional table by the head of the couch. If so, the rector,
flinging the box at the window in a last effort to get air, and
to summon help, could have unknowingly flung the chain of
crystals as well. The necklace might have slithered out of sight
under the window seat. And the murderer, picking up the broken
china jar, had probably set the box that had broken it down on
the nearest table.</p>

<p>It was the emptiness of the box&mdash;if Pointer was right in
his guesses&mdash;which had puzzled Olive when he showed it to
her on the Monday. But what had brought the box with the necklace
inside it to the study on Sunday night? Pointer thought of
Olive's face&mdash;and the rector's sermon&mdash;and believed
that he understood. Understood, too, what had made her hover
around the door listening to see if the rector had not yet gone,
until she had given it up for the moment, and perforce gone on to
her bedroom. It was a small additional point in favour of the
argument that it was not she who had poisoned the rector, that
the box had been left in the room. Olive would have certainly
hunted for the necklace, which she alone, Pointer thought, would
know had been inside it. Yet once she knew that the necklace that
she had placed in it had been picked up, the box would have no
further interest for her.</p>

<p>He must question her about it, of course, but she would
equally of course deny it, and her denial would not alter
matters. The point for him was, that Lady Revell might
conceivably be speaking the truth when she said that the necklace
could not have been left by her at the rectory last Sunday night.
It looked as though Olive had thought that the rector's sermon
was directed at her, which meant that her alleged habit of
pilfering was a fact, so she believed that Mr. Avery had been
adjuring her to come forward and speak up&mdash;own up. Pointer
thought that Olive, really moved, might have taken the only thing
which she had not yet disposed of&mdash;Lady Revell's crystal
necklace, put it in a little box, and gone with it in her hand to
the rector who had had no time for her&mdash;at the
moment&mdash;and that Olive, determined to burn her boats, had
left the little box on a table in the study, the table standing
nearest to the door, at the head of the couch. Then, Pointer
surmised, had come reaction. She had wanted to get the box back,
but each time that Fraser had seen her hovering round the study
door and trying to slip in unnoticed, the rector had made some
movement that had told her that the room was not empty, and
finally she had gone to bed, sure that she could get it back in
the morning. He might be wrong, of course, but the mere fact that
he might be right, altered Lady Revell's position. The necklace
had seemed a most damning piece of circumstantial evidence
against her. It was quite valueless now.</p>

<p>Fraser came in with a telephone message. Mrs. Richard Avery
would not be able to get back under an hour. Pointer decided not
to wait. Shilling hoped to have something of interest to tell him
by that time, and Pointer wanted to hear it. It concerned Sir
Hubert Witson.</p>

<p>As he walked to the police station, there to get to work on
some papers, Pointer met Byrd and stopped for a word with him.
Byrd, to the surprise of the village, had attended the rector's
funeral. He was looking very grave, Pointer thought, and at a
word from himself, Byrd fell into step beside him, as the two
turned towards the open country.</p>

<p>Byrd seemed in a softened mood for once.</p>

<p>"A good man gone," he said tersely.</p>

<p>"Yes. Thanks to a poisoner," the detective officer agreed.</p>

<p>"It still seems incredible&mdash;that&mdash;to me," Byrd
said.</p>

<p>"Why so?" Pointer wanted to know. "He had stumbled on some
truth about Anthony Revell's death, we think. That being so, no
high character would save him. You heard him preach last Sunday,
didn't you?"</p>

<p>Byrd seemed to stiffen. "Yes," he said curtly.</p>

<p>"So you think he was referring to Revell's death? I happen to
know that he wasn't. He wanted to get some one to come forward
and speak up&mdash;own up&mdash;well, he was hardly likely to
expect any one to hang themselves, was he? As a matter of fact,
he said that he hoped he had inspired some one with courage.
Hardly fits a murderer, eh?" Byrd finished with a scoffing little
smile.</p>

<p>"So on Sunday afternoon he talked to you about his sermon of
the morning?" Pointer asked quite casually.</p>

<p>Byrd clicked his teeth together and swore at himself under his
breath.</p>

<p>"He did," he said finally. "And now what?"</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell us sooner? You know that we have been
trying our hardest to find out where he spent some hours on
Saturday and Sunday afternoon."</p>

<p>Byrd said nothing for a moment. He shot his lower jaw out, and
opened and closed it once or twice, as though to see if it would
work in that position.</p>

<p>"Well, as I let my tongue get too long, I may as well tell you
that he spent both afternoons at my cottage talking to me. At my
request. At least the Saturday was at my request, the Sunday was
his own idea. He was waiting at my cottage for me when I got
there."</p>

<p>"You talked about?" Pointer said as Byrd fell silent.</p>

<p>"Souls," Byrd said. "Heaven," he added crossly. "Future life,"
he threw in from between clenched teeth. "Teaching of the
church," he wound up fiercely.</p>

<p>Pointer said nothing for a moment.</p>

<p>"Why should I have told you?" Byrd demanded. "What business of
yours was it that I was interested in such things. Fact is,
Revell's death was rather a shock. Unexpected. Unexplained. Made
one think. I asked Mr. Avery to drop in on Saturday for a talk.
He came at two and talked till five. He got me to give him my
objections to religion, and took them seriatim. He dropped in on
the Sunday to finish. He didn't finish then either, as a matter
of fact. By the way, if you want proof"&mdash;Byrd gave his
sarcastic smile&mdash;"he dropped some sermon headings when he
sat in my arm-chair on the Saturday. I didn't find the paper till
Tuesday. Here it is&mdash;but I want to keep it&mdash;I liked the
rector. He&mdash;well, he was genuine. I wish I'd talked to him
more&mdash;when I had the chance."</p>

<p>He stopped, and took out a pocket-book. From it he extracted a
paper folded in four, lengthways.</p>

<p>Pointer caught his breath. Even he, with his sharp eyes,
thought for one instant that it was the identical sheet of
note-paper at which he had seen the rector staring with distended eyes
last Sunday. Then he saw on it a series of some eight lines like
a poem in the rector's beautiful writing. They were key sentences
for the sequence of his sermon, beginning with <i>Reverence for
knowledge among the Jews.</i></p>

<p>He turned it over, but Byrd put out his hand.</p>

<p>"I'd rather you didn't read it, they were meant for Mr.
Avery's eyes, when he should call again."</p>

<p>Pointer had seen all that he wanted to. The back was covered
with Byrd's neat but stiff writing; and such words as
<i>Priestcraft, Freewill, Cruelty a law of nature</i>&mdash;and
so on, figured largely in it. He handed back the paper
reluctantly.</p>

<p>"I suppose I couldn't be allowed to keep it locked away," he
asked with real earnestness, but Byrd, as he knew that he would,
shook his head decisively.</p>

<p>"Then please keep it carefully," Pointer said, and Byrd
nodded.</p>

<p>"I shall. It's a souvenir. But it'll be where you can't get at
it to read it out in court&mdash;" and with that he put his
pocket-book away.</p>

<p>"You got in late for his sermon on Sunday morning, didn't
you?" Pointer asked casually.</p>

<p>"Not late, no. He had only just begun it. Why?" Pointer did
not tell him.</p>

<p>"What was Mr. Avery like on the Sunday afternoon?" he asked
instead, watching him as he did so. "Absent-minded?"</p>

<p>"Not he! He gave his whole mind, and a damned good mind it was
too, to the points I had raised. They took some answering."</p>

<p>"He didn't refer, to anything else that was troubling
him?"</p>

<p>"You're thinking of that sermon of his? No, he might have been
thinking of it, though, when he said that when you had an
insoluble problem on hand, it was a good thing to leave milling
it over, and turn instead to some work in which you could forget
it and all other puzzles."</p>

<p>Pointer questioned Byrd closely. He set concealed traps for
him. But Byrd stood all tests. Apparently, therefore, the
unaccounted-for time of the rector could have had no bearing on
his end. Pointer had a notion that Byrd knew, or thought he knew,
at whom the sermon was aimed, but, if so, he refused to
acknowledge it, and from some of his answers, Pointer by no means
saw eye to eye with him on the matter. Finally Byrd shot him a
quizzical glance.</p>

<p>"Never give up? Eh? Never know when you're beaten? What a man!
Wish you were sailing with us."</p>

<p>"Mr. Gilbert Revell and Miss Hill are going with you, I
understand?"</p>

<p>"Neither," Byrd said briefly. "We can't take her, and his
mother doesn't want him to go."</p>

<p>"But Miss Hill is counting on going," Pointer
expostulated.</p>

<p>"She's mis-counted, then," Byrd said. "We don't want single
women."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she'll marry Mr. Revell, and both will come along
after all," Pointer said, as though it were a soothing idea.
Certainly Byrd did not appear to feel hit. He seemed to think
that he had gone as far with the other as he cared to, and
dropped off with a nod, to walk back to the railway station and
there wait for a train in from the nearest town. Olive Hill was
one of those who got down. Byrd joined her outside the
station.</p>

<p>She gave him a cool greeting. He returned it in kind.</p>

<p>"Look here, Olive. Mrs. Green was talking the other
night&mdash;up at the Revells'; Gilbert nearly hit her, he said.
She thinks you shot Anthony as well as the rector. What about
it?"</p>

<p>Olive said nothing. Apparently the suggestion bored her.</p>

<p>"Can't you muzzle her?" he asked.</p>

<p>"When I find out, and prove who did the murders, then she'll
stop. I shall yet. And soon too." Olive spoke confidently. "When
does the expedition sail? In another month, isn't it? Well, I
shall have cleared things up by then."</p>

<p>"You're not coming!" he snapped. His face was dark.</p>

<p>"I shall pay in my hundred, and this time it'll stay in," she
retorted.</p>

<p>"It's because of that money I don't want you to come," he said
sullenly but firmly. "You've brought it on yourself&mdash;so
listen, then. You no more got that hundred honestly than I could
lay my hands&mdash;honestly&mdash;on a thousand. You told me in
the beginning that you had saved just four pounds towards
the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And have you never heard of a hundred-to-one bet coming off?"
she asked, her face suddenly pinched. "What about Flamenco and
the Derby?"</p>

<p>"You didn't bet on Flamenco," he said with certainty.</p>

<p>She turned on him, her face scarlet, but he stopped her with
his glance&mdash;penetrating&mdash;contemptuous.</p>

<p>"Very well, since you want to hear it all, you shall! I saw
you pinch that crystal necklace out of Lady Revell's bedroom. I
was on her balcony getting an aerial right for Gilbert. I saw you
slip in last Saturday, and go to a little cabinet on her
dressing-table, thrust your hand into a drawer and pull out a
necklace which you dropped into your handbag, and then you were
out of the room again like a flash."</p>

<p>Olive was facing him panting, her hands clenched at her sides.
She passed her tongue over her dry lips. "And you! you! Who
always said that we ought to take from the rich what they didn't
need? Who said that if they wouldn't share willingly, they ought
to be forced to hand over? But it's not true! I fetched the
necklace for Lady Revell who had 'forgotten to put it on. Where
are your eyes? She'd worn it all that afternoon."</p>

<p>Byrd looked taken aback. His glance faltered. Then
raffled.</p>

<p>"Then what did last Sunday's sermon mean? Avery knew about
those beads. And you knew that he knew!"</p>

<p>For a second she faced him hardly. Then:</p>

<p>"Yes," she said with a genuine little gasp. "And yet when I
stepped in after dinner to tell him, explain, he wouldn't hear a
word. Told me to come to him next day, fairly shut me up as
though it didn't matter. Looked at me as though he didn't know
what I meant when I asked him how he knew&mdash;" She paused for
a moment then went on fiercely. "It was your own words I
followed. I needed it to make up the hundred. I want to go and
find the island!" Her face began to break up. "I never took
anything really valuable, anything they prized. And as soon as I
got the hundred together I was going to stop. Even so, I was
going to return that necklace at the first opportunity, as I
wanted to tell Mr. Avery. What Mrs. Green says doesn't
matter&mdash;but this&mdash;is this going to part us?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Doesn't matter what Mrs. Green says!" He preferred to keep to
the first part of the sentence. "My dear girl, you may be able to
keep the necklace part dark, but Anthony's and the rector's
murder? Good God If you can sit down under an accusation like
that!"</p>

<p>"You wait!" she retorted. "I have one piece of proof&mdash;of
part of what happened. And in time I'll have the full proof. You
wait!" With that, she turned, and left him standing there.

<h2><a name="ch18"></a>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h2>

<p class="first">SHILLING and the Chief Constable were waiting for
Pointer.</p>

<p>"What d' you make of this?" the superintendent asked eagerly.
"Sir Hubert Witson has paid the Gartsides a cheque&mdash;value
unknown&mdash;for some of the stamps in Anthony Revell's album.
Now what's the betting that those stamps weren't originally in
the envelope handed by Mr. Anthony to the rector?"</p>

<p>"Did you see the stamp album that they chose as one of their
legacies?" Pointer asked. The news was certainly of
importance.</p>

<p>"I did. It's a haphazard affair. Under 'Italian Stamps' comes
a couple of bare places where they claim they found these that
they've sold to Sir Hubert. Sir Hubert swears the same. If you
ask me, I think people were a bit hasty in abolishing torture.
It's the only way sometimes. A trifle of a squeeze, now, or a
tight press, or a little peeling, and Sir Hubert and the
Gartsides mightn't be snapping their fingers at us."</p>

<p>Shilling spoke with heat, Pointer only laughed. He knew the
superintendent for one of the kindest of men.</p>

<p>"Well?" Shilling asked disconsolately. "Nothing to prove
anything! What has your afternoon brought you?"</p>

<p>Pointer told them what he had learnt from Miss Avery.</p>

<p>"So Lady Revell may be telling the truth," was Weir-Opie's
comment. "In fact, seems to be&mdash;and Miss Hill&mdash;" the
Chief Constable made a face.</p>

<p>"Well, Pointer, Shilling and I will occupy ourselves with the
difficulties of our arson case, and leave simple matters like the
rectory mystery to you. Another ten minutes is sure to solve
it."</p>

<p>Pointer smiled a trifle wryly. "I wish the rector had helped
us a bit more," he said. "I think he tried to..."</p>

<p>"You know, we never had anything but their own word for where
the Gartsides were all day and night on Thursday and Friday,"
Shilling struck in. "They claim they were walking and sleeping
out under their tent, and so on. They had their tinned food with
them, biscuits, bully beef, milk, tea, and so on. They say they
bought bread and fruit from farmers, but we couldn't prove
whether they did or not. It looks to me as though they might have
followed Revell back to The Causeway."</p>

<p>"We always did know that was a possibility," Weir-Opie was
balancing a pencil on his forefinger.</p>

<p>"But we couldn't prove it!" ended Shilling. "No more than we
can now."</p>

<p>Pointer was only listening with half his mind. Weir-Opie
looked at him questioningly.</p>

<p>"You've had an idea from the first," he said as he had said
once before.</p>

<p>Pointer only discussed the stamp theory a little longer, and
then left them. He had to go up to town that evening to be
present at a discussion of a case with which he had previously
had some connection. The discussion prolonged itself over the
Sunday, and it was not till Monday noon that he was free to
return to his rooms near the rectory. Before he left, he asked
Superintendent Shilling to have his men on duty redouble their
vigilance. He was worried about Olive Hill. If he were wrong, and
she was guilty she was in no danger. But if she were not guilty,
then she was far too eager in her search of the rectory rooms to
be safe.</p>

<p>He had a very serious talk with her on the matter, but Olive
listened with a mulish look on her closed-in face. A look that
said that she would have nothing to do with the police. That she
wanted no protection, and no suggestions.</p>

<p>"I'm going, up to town for a short time," he said finally,
"and I want to give you two final words of warning."</p>

<p>Her eyes met his on that, interested but very self-confident.</p>

<p>"First of all&mdash;give up looking for papers. They're
dangerous. And I don't think you'll be misled by the form in
which I have to give it&mdash;beware of anything to do with Mrs.
Green." He spoke very seriously. "<i>Anything</i> to do with her,
mind. Any place where she is. Anything with which she might,
however distantly, be connected." He gave her a long look, but
Olive's eyes again said that she felt herself eminently capable
of looking after herself. It was an expression which would have
surprised Gilbert Revell, who had only seen its opposite.</p>

<p>Pointer left her with a feeling that she had already decided
on some course of action, and that he had wasted his breath. He
could only hope that whatever she had in mind did not clash with
what he had just said. On the whole, he thought not. There had
been no defiance, no opposition in her eye. He believed that she
knew her danger, but he was uneasy. Very.</p>

<p>He might have been still more disquieted could he have seen
Olive after his talk with her, attacking a <i>Daily Telegraph</i>
with scissors. She was cutting words out, and laying them in
sequence on a table beside her. That done, she pasted them on a
sheet of cheap-looking paper torn out of a copy book. They made a
paragraph which ran: "I have found a letter which may interest
you among the effects of a late client who died from an accident
with his revolver. The letter is one summoning him back to his
home. The price for it will be a thousand pounds in one pound
notes. If you insert in the <i>Morning Wire's</i> Personal column
on Monday '<i>By Promise Bound,'</i> I will write and suggest a
place in town for the transaction." Any words which could not be
found in their entirety she built up of separate letters.</p>

<p>The task done, she washed her hands, carefully addressed the
envelope, an affair which seemed to take her a long time, and
then, folding up the paper, took it out with her, and slipped the
letter into her bag. She posted it at the nearest pillar-box to
Mr. Smith's office, then she walked back through the woods. In
one open glade she seemed to have an accident while lighting a
cigarette, and set the paper she had with her on fire. Gilbert
came on it while she was beating out the flames. He told her how
thoughtful she was not to let it lie smouldering, a menace to the
underwood. Olive explained that she hated thoughtlessness of any
kind, which was but a form of selfishness, and asked him if it
were true that he had really given up his idea of going with
Byrd.</p>

<p>Gilbert had, very much to his regret, he said, but his new
duties would not let him absent himself for an indeterminate time
just now. Olive agreed that one's duty must come first. He was
still hoping that Byrd could put his ideas into execution, he
said. He still intended to pay one thousand towards the
expedition's expenses; unfortunately, death duties would not let
him pay Byrd the other thousand that he had promised, and which
would have let the little expedition start with sufficient funds
to buy an island site when found. But as she also knew Byrd was
advertising for a chairman, and would doubtless find some one to
come forward and advance the money, especially as the chairman
would have very much of a say about the place when selected.</p>

<p>Olive asked some very intelligent questions as to just what
the donor of the second thousand could expect in the way of
directing the expedition.</p>

<p>Gilbert explained Byrd's views as to what would be the fair
thing to offer, and Olive seemed quite interested in them too.
But then, Olive was a girl who was interested in so many things,
Gilbert thought. He was very chagrined that his mother no longer
seemed to feel the affection for her that she had shown on her
engagement to Anthony. Just lately he had found it better not to
talk of her much, not to press for the offer to her of a yearly
allowance. That was that pestilential Mrs. Green's doing, he
knew. She had talked his mother quite out of her earlier and more
generous mood. But he himself, as soon as the estate was settled
up, would have a word with his solicitors and see what could be
done. An annuity of three hundred would not cripple him, but, if
the veriest trifle to what she would have had, would at least
keep her from poverty.</p>

<p>Olive and he had a delightful talk. He thought what a pleasure
it was nowadays to meet a girl so simple, so straightforward, so
friendly. And she had charm, a charm which wound itself around
your heart. He was not sure whether it came from the glance,
timid and yet interested, of those large dark eyes, or whether it
lay in her shy smile. No wonder Anthony had fallen in love with
her. Olive had confessed that Mrs. Green was right in thinking
that she had never really loved Anthony. She knew that now, but
she had thought that she had at the time. After all, Gilbert
reflected, a little country mouse like Olive would not at first
be able to tell the difference between love and mere friendship.
She had never told him what had made her realise this, only
giving him one of her heart-stirring smiles and changing the
subject with a little, very fetching sigh.</p>

<p>He walked back with her to the rectory and Grace, who met them
on the steps, looked perturbed, he thought, even through the
marks of grief that her face had shown at the funeral.</p>

<p>On Monday morning, Olive was down early, and had a look at the
<i>Morning Wire</i>. She found <i>By Promise Bound</i> almost at
once, but there was a message following it which ran "Cannot get
to town this week. Suggest painter's cottage at three to-day.
Telephone or telegraph 'yes' if you can meet me there."</p>

<p>Olive thought this over. She knew what cottage was meant. It
was shut up at the moment. Mrs. Green was up in town arranging an
exhibition of her paintings. After careful thought, Olive went
out for her usual walk. She stepped into a telephone-box and rang
up the apartment house in Mayfair where Mrs. Green had taken
rooms. Grace Avery had the number and the key of the cottage in
her room, as the artist was not sure whether she would not want
to send back some of the pictures which she had taken with her,
and if so, Grace had promised to see to their safe disposal..</p>

<p>Mrs. Green was in, and told her that she would not be back
till the end of next week. She said that she was glad that Grace
had telephoned to ask how she was getting on, as she was leaving
her rooms at once and going to a hotel. She did not care for the
service where she was. She gave her new number to what she
believed was Grace, who hung up at once. Olive's interest was
over. She would not be disturbed at the cottage, which was all
that she cared to know. It was a good hour's drive to London.</p>

<p>Stepping to the letter-box, she now dropped in an envelope
exactly like the one that had contained the printed message.
Inside was another cut-out message which ran: "I shall send an
old nurse with the letter to the cottage at three sharp. Hand her
the money but, as she is deaf, please do not speak to her. She
has been given a false, but quite satisfactory, explanation of
what she is to do. You will let her count the money, and she will
then hand you the letter. Should she not be back by three-thirty,
something very unpleasant would result. I have taken every
precaution."</p>

<p>After Olive's return to the rectory, she ate a good breakfast,
then she caught the nine-thirty train up to town and with a small
blouse-case&mdash;empty apparently&mdash;went by bus to Swan and
Edgar's at Piccadilly Circus.</p>

<p>At half-past two, a stout, handsome, black-haired, very much
painted-up lady who looked like a foreigner with her thick
eyebrows meeting over her rather humped, thickly-powdered nose
came up the garden path of Mrs. Green's cottage. She stopped at
sight of the gardener who was at work on a flower-bed.</p>

<p>"Allo!" called the foreign-looking lady. Then as he paused in
his work, she beckoned to him. "Madame Gr-r-reen she is away, I
know, but I am old fr-r-iend. I stay here. She have give me her
key. She returning this evening. My luggage it should eat have
come to the station by the tr-rain coming fr-r-om town. You fetch
it, eh? Here is my name&mdash;Madame Levitsky. You wait and
br-ring it, eh? A lar-rge tr-runk and two smaller-r-r ones, eh? You
wait for them? I can confide in you, eh? 'Ere is zumzing for-r-r
your tr-rouble now. When you br-ring the baggage I pay more, eh?"
She handed the man two half-crowns. "You go at once, eh? I want
my baggage as soon as it arrive. I will make myself comfor-rtable
till she come back this evening," and with that she waddled with
flat feet up the steps to the door, which she opened with a key
and closed behind her.</p>

<p>The gardener went off at once, the half-crowns jingling
merrily in his hand.</p>

<p>Pointer meanwhile had spent a disturbed morning.</p>

<p>The mystery at the rectory had been at the back of his mind
all the week-end. He spent a very wakeful Saturday night, with
the uncomfortable feeling that his subconscious mind was
endeavouring to signal to him. But try as he would, he could not
think out what this something could be.</p>

<p>Coming down in the train late on Monday afternoon, he sat with
closed eyes. As though he were inspecting film strips, he
reviewed wall by wall the room where the rector had been found
dead. His subconscious was telling him that he had passed over
something as trifling which was important&mdash;vital. But what?
He started on his mental journey from the door. He spent a long
time over the little occasional table by the couch (on which he
believed the box containing the necklace had stood), the couch
itself with the body of Mr. Avery on it&mdash;the mantel on the
farther end of which had stood the orange jar containing the
stamps, the jar which he had rightly deduced to have been broken
and therefore buried. The stamps had either been destroyed in
some way, or saved and sold. He stopped a long moment here, but
finally he felt sure that he had missed nothing about the jar.
Then he passed on to the bookcase where he had found the single,
valueless, Italian stamp. The window-seat under which he had
found the necklace&mdash;the necklace&mdash;and so he came to the
table with the supper-tray. Item by item he reviewed the things
on the tray. And suddenly he jumped up. The dessert-knife&mdash;
covered with Mr. Avery's fingerprints. Firm and bold
prints. Yet the blade showed that the knife had not been used.
That at least had been what had been thought up to now.</p>

<p>When the train got in, Pointer went at once to the police
station and unlocked the safe. The Superintendent was absent, but
the inspector on duty took out for Pointer the box containing the
fingerprint photographs; and then the box of "exhibits"
themselves. Pointer again had a look at the polished silver blade
with its pointed end. Very carefully he ran a finger along the
edge. It was no sharper than dessert-knives usually are. He put
away the exhibits and studied the photographs of the rector's
fingerprints on the handle. It was a heavy handle with a slightly
bulbous end. Pointer finally decided that it had been used by Mr.
Avery, first for cutting and then for boring into something
fairly firm. He memorised the position of the fingerprints, and
then replaced the photographs also in the safe. There had been a
Stilton cheese on the tray, but it had been crumbled by himself
until nothing remained. Everything on the tray had been tested
for that paper. Yet the knife had been wiped after use, and by
Mr. Avery, as the fingerprints showed.</p>

<p>Pointer's pulses quickened, impassive though his face
remained, as he set off for the rectory. He was all out to find
where Mr. Avery had hidden the precious, all-important paper
which the rector had unfolded in the pulpit, and he believed that
at last he had a clue.</p>

<p>Mr. Avery&mdash;a clever man&mdash;who knew that he had been
poisoned&mdash;could be trusted to have guessed the reason. He
had put his wits to their last earthly task of foiling his
poisoners. He had used the knife, and then, lest the marks give
the hiding-place away, had wiped the blade.</p>

<p>As he strode along, Pointer again ran over item by item
everything in the room and in the library. There was nothing for
which such a knife could have been used bar the plaster ceiling,
and that was unusually high in both rooms. Nothing...nothing...so
whatever it was on which it had been used must have been taken
out of the room. Or had the rector's efforts at a hiding-place
failed? Had the poisoner triumphed? He would soon know. But he
had a hope that Mr. Avery's brains had been too much for the
murderer.

<h2><a name="ch19"></a>CHAPTER NINETEEN</h2>

<p class="first">FRASER opened the door and Pointer asked him
where Miss Hill was.</p>

<p>"Out with both the ladies, sir, house-hunting."</p>

<p>Pointer had to leave it at that for the moment. He signed to
him to follow him into the morning-room.</p>

<p>"Look here, something is missing from the study, or possibly
from the library. Something was taken out on Monday morning
before we got here. You feel sure that it couldn't have been by
the doctor?"</p>

<p>"Certain," Fraser said after a second's thought. "Quite
certain. And <i>I</i> took nothing away, not so much as a pin,
sir."</p>

<p>"What about the housemaid?"</p>

<p>Pointer knew that Shilling and Weir-Opie had already
questioned her and all the servants, and had been satisfied that
she had left everything as she found it.</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir," Fraser now said with certainty.</p>

<p>"Must have," Pointer replied with equal certainty. "Could it
have been anything that she always took out of a morning? Part of
her regular duties which she didn't think of, when
questioned?"</p>

<p>"You mean the paper-basket and the plate of apples, sir? They
were taken down, of course. The basket I had brought up again
untouched for the Chief Constable to find in its usual place when
he got here. Nothing had been taken out of it, for the very good
reason that there wasn't anything in it. As to the plate of
apples, she had to take them away every morning, and I would make
them up to the four the rector always liked to find on it, for
her to set on the writing-table when the room was finished. He
hadn't touched them that Sunday, for a wonder. All four came
down."</p>

<p>"And were eaten later?" Pointer asked casually, but with a
tension that would have surprised Fraser had he realised it.</p>

<p>"Not been touched," Fraser said promptly. "No one ever ate
them but Mr. Avery. They're in my pantry at the moment, standing
on the mantel as they stood on his writing-table. I mean to keep
them there as long as they don't go bad."</p>

<p>Pointer asked if he could have them brought to him. He wanted
to test them for fingerprints, he said. Therefore it might be as
well to bring a knife such as the rector used and a plate with
them, so as to look as little noticeable as possible.</p>

<p>Fraser seemed puzzled, but he slipped out to his pantry,
coming back almost at once with two glass plates, a large one on
which were three apples in a circle, with a fourth poised on top
of them, and a small plate with a dessert-knife on it.</p>

<p>Pointer waited until Fraser had reluctantly left the room,
then he locked the door, lifted off the top apple and took up one
of the three underneath. One by one, he scrutinised them. The
third showed him what he was looking for&mdash;the all-but-invisible
mark of a wedge-shaped piece. He pulled at it
carefully. Nothing happened. Using the knife, he prised it loose.
The apple had a large hollow centre by nature. In it was
something white&mdash;paper. Pointer got it out with the utmost
care. It was a very thin envelope which had apparently been
covered with gum. Careful and wise, Mr. Avery had feared lest the
juice of the fruit might damage that which he had slipped inside,
for in the envelope when Pointer now slit it, was a sheet of
paper which had once been folded in four, though now it had been
compressed into as small a space as possible. Pointer replaced
the wedge of apple back in its place, and spreading out the paper
with considerable emotion, read the few lines written on it. It
was the paper which Mr. Avery had unfolded in the pulpit. As he
read he saw that his first guess at the criminal had been right,
slight though the fact was on which it had rested. Copying the
lines swiftly in his note-book, he slipped envelope and paper
into another envelope, closed it, laid it in a book, unlocked the
door and sent for Weston, one of his own men who had been left on
duty, and whom he had not yet seen since his return from town. To
him was given the precious book with an apparently casual word as
to whom to hand it to at the police station, but in reality it
was a code word which meant that what he carried was much more
important than his own life. That he was to see it at once locked
into the safe, and then return here with Superintendent
Shilling.</p>

<p>Before he hurried off on his motor-cycle, Pointer asked
briefly, "Everything here as usual?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, except that Miss Hill went up to town by an early
train and hasn't got back yet. I telephoned Carter to be on the
look-out for her at Paddington. He followed her to Swan and
Edgar's in Piccadilly Circus, but she hadn't come out when he
phoned me. He didn't see her in the luncheon-room, but he hadn't
time to look long, he was afraid of missing her at one of the
doors. He's still watching them."</p>

<p>Pointer sent him off, and rang for Fraser. "Did you say Miss
Hill is house-hunting?"</p>

<p>"My mistake, sir. I thought the ladies went off together. But
Mrs. Richard&mdash;Mrs. Avery, I should say&mdash;is back and
asking for her." Even as he spoke, Doris was hurrying down the
stairs to meet them.</p>

<p>"I can't think where Miss Hill is," she said now. "She asked
me for the day off until four o'clock.. She said she'd be back by
then at latest. It's now past five. She's never been late before.
I have the oddest feeling that she's in trouble&mdash;" Doris
looked very anxious. "Miss Avery and I have been out all day
house-hunting, you know. We must leave here by the end of the
next fortnight. And it's so unlike Miss Hill not to be back, or
to send a message&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where is Miss Avery?"</p>

<p>Doris looked surprised. "Still looking at impossible places.
Why?"</p>

<p>"Has Mrs. Green got back yet?" Pointer asked instead of
replying.</p>

<p>Doris looked puzzled. "Not as far as I know."</p>

<p>Pointer was looking at his shoes. Olive Hill should have been
back by four o'clock, and was still out. He hoped for the best,
but her journey to town suggested that she had refused to leave
things alone, that in spite of all that he had said to her she
had played with gunpowder. He was afraid that it had blown her
up. He had told his men to watch her most carefully, but so few
men could be spared just now from town. Carter at Paddington was
one of the newest men out from Hendon. Willing enough, clever
too, but he lacked practice. And it needs three men to watch the
exits of Swan and Edgar's properly. There was also the
possibility that Olive had come out in a disguise. She could pick
up a bunch of curls in one department, a cloak in another,
gloves, spectacles, a hat of a different shape to the one she was
wearing, she might even&mdash;with her figure&mdash;have had an
Eton crop, bought a suit "for a brother," and walked out as a
young man.</p>

<p>Pointer stepped in one stride to the telephone. A moment later
and he was speaking to Shilling.</p>

<p>"Weston is on his way to you with a book. Please wait for him
and then come on at once to Mrs. Green's cottage, where Mrs.
Avery and I shall wait for you. And&mdash;" Here in a rather
casual voice came some words in code which petrified the
Superintendent.</p>

<p>"Impossible!" Shilling's voice was really appalled. "I
mean&mdash;well&mdash;see about it at once, and come at once,
too. It won't take a minute. The Chief's here, by good luck."</p>

<p>Pointer hung up and, after a word with Fraser, ran to his car.
Doris hurried after him.</p>

<p>"What makes you ask about Mrs. Green?" She spoke in a low
voice. "Miss Hill wouldn't go to her. The two, as one would
expect, are at daggers drawn. Besides, Mrs. Green is away."</p>

<p>"I think she may have gone to Mrs. Green's cottage," Pointer
said. "Coming? I'll leave word where we have gone in case she
comes back here."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll come. I'm worried. If there is any fresh trouble
between them&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Again he did not reply.</p>

<p>They were off. Both were silent. Doris looked very
worried.</p>

<p>"You don't think she's in any sort of danger, do you?" she
asked suddenly.</p>

<p>Pointer did not reply, but he gave the tap on the arm of the
chauffeur which meant "still faster."</p>

<p>The cottage looked quite deserted when they reached it.
Pointer called out Miss Hill's name as he ran up the little path
to the grey door. His chauffeur followed with Mrs. Avery.</p>

<p>"She's not here! It's shut up!" Doris said in a disappointed
voice. "We've wasted our time!"</p>

<p>Pointer had the door open on the instant with a key that did
not look at all like a key. Inside the hall he called again.
There was no answer. He tried a door beside him. He opened it in
a trice. The room was empty. He tried the door on the other side.
It was locked, but he opened it. There was a curious, acrid smell
in the room. By the table Olive Hill had been sitting. She was
now slumped far forward on it. The man with Pointer held Mrs.
Avery back. "Don't go in farther, ma'am. She's dead! Shot. Head
wound&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let the lady come in, Hogarth," Pointer said. "We need her to
identify the body."</p>

<p>Doris, with a chalk-white face, was staring at Olive's dead
body, which, all things considered, did not look too dreadful.
She had been shot from ear to ear, they found out afterwards.</p>

<p>Pointer told Hogarth the chauffeur to telephone at once for
the doctor. "We must know the hour when it happened," he
explained to Mrs. Avery. "Sorry to ask you to stay, you mustn't
touch anything&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course I'll stay," she said. "I don't think I would like
to leave her&mdash;now&mdash;like this&mdash;alone. But where is
Mrs. Green? Oh!" The last was an exclamation, as her glance fell
on something on the floor. It was a revolver.</p>

<p>Pointer marked the place on the carpet with a very casual
stroke of chalk. The position of the revolver did not matter in
the least to him. Then he lifted it and wrapped it in transparent
paper, so as to preserve the fingerprints.</p>

<p>"Though they'll be those of Miss Hill, to a certainty," he
said to Mrs. Avery as he did so.</p>

<p>"But that's Anthony's revolver!" she gasped, swallowing hard.
"Anthony's initials are on it. See! Mrs. Green was allowed to
keep it after the inquest. She asked for it, you know. Where is
she?" she stared about her.</p>

<p>Again Pointer said nothing. He, too, wondered at the artist's
absence. He had expected to find her here.</p>

<p>The chauffeur came back to say that the doctor would come
instantly.</p>

<p>The telephone rang as he was speaking. Pointer took off the
receiver. He had just left word with Fraser to put any message
for him through to the Cottage till further notice. It was Mr.
Smith speaking. Where was Miss Hill? Did the Chief Inspector
know? She wasn't at the rectory and&mdash;well, in short, where
was she?</p>

<p>"We've just found her dead&mdash;shot&mdash;at Mrs. Green's
cottage. Did she leave a message with you?" Pointer asked. The
tone of Mr. Smith's voice had suggested that wonderful
possibility to him.</p>

<p>"Shot!" came in shocked tones. "You mean?"</p>

<p>Pointer did not reply.</p>

<p>"Then I ought to have&mdash;has she been dead long?"</p>

<p>"Since three o'clock, I think we shall find," Pointer replied,
"but that's the merest guess. The doctor hasn't got here
yet."</p>

<p>"I'm coming at once. Can you wait for me? I shan't take five
minutes to get to you at the cottage," came in a shaken voice
from the other end. "She left an envelope to be sent&mdash;but
I'll explain&mdash;I'll be there&mdash;at once&mdash;" he hung
up.</p>

<p>"You think&mdash;did she&mdash;poor girl&mdash;did Anthony's
death go as deep as that? But where's Mrs. Green? Surely she must
be somewhere near. Or how did Olive get in?"</p>

<p>There was a sound of a car driving up to the cottage. It was
the doctor. He looked staggered at the sight of the dead girl on
the chair. Pointer asked him to tell them how long Miss Hill had
been dead. His own guess had been a good one, for the doctor put
her death at around three, as nearly as he could tell without an
autopsy.</p>

<p>Doris stared at the Chief Inspector.</p>

<p>"But if you knew, why didn't you prevent it?" she asked
passionately.</p>

<p>The doctor suggested that he should take Mrs. Avery home, but
Pointer explained that Mr. Smith was coming with a very important
letter that they both wanted to see.</p>

<p>The doctor had to hurry off, for he had rushed away from a
maternity case. As he left, the sound of another car could be
heard racing up at a pace for which it was never intended.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Smith. Hatless&mdash;all but breathless. He was
shown into the room opposite, and at Pointer's suggestion, Mrs.
Avery and he joined him there.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Avery! What a shock for you&mdash;did you find her?
Chief Inspector, I must explain at once. My secretary is usually
as careful a woman as lives, but we can all of us be caught
napping. A messenger-boy stepped in around half-past two o'clock,
handed her a letter for me&mdash;to be sent in at once. That was
impossible, as it happened. I was seeing a client on a very
private matter, most unfortunately, so Miss Hibbard put the
letter on one side, and I regret to say she forgot it till I was
having tea just now when she brought it me. It was addressed to
me. I opened it at my leisure, and found inside it this
envelope."</p>

<p>Pointer had already read it over Mr. Smith's shoulder. It was
in Olive Hill's handwriting.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">To be handed to the Chief Inspector or to any
other officer at the police station if I have not myself asked
for this back by four o'clock.</p>

<br>

<p>Across one corner was written:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">Very important! Only to be handed back to me
personally. Or given at once to the police if I am not back at
the office to ask for it by four this afternoon.</p>

<br>

<p>Pointer opened the envelope and drew out a letter, or rather
two letters. For they were in different handwritings.</p>

<p>He read each through. As he did so a car rushed up to the
cottage door as though it were leading in a race. In the same
instant, so it seemed, the room door opened and Major Weir-Opie,
very pale for once, and Superintendent Shilling came in. Behind
them two policemen closed the door silently.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Avery," said Shilling, and his voice was not steady even
now, "I arrest you for the murder of Anthony Revell, and for the
poisoning of the rector, Mr. Avery&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused, as his eyes swept to the figure slumped against the
table. One look of interrogation at Pointer, one nod from him, a
muttered word from Major Opie, who was bending over the dead
girl, and Shilling continued firmly and very clearly: "And for
the murder of Miss Hill. Anything you say&mdash;" he finished the
prescribed formula.</p>

<p>Doris Avery swayed back a fraction of an inch. Her face looked
as though cut from marble, except for the eyes, the dreadful eyes
that blazed for a second as she swept them around the room in a
quite automatic, unconscious effort to find some way of escape.
Then she turned to Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>"This is monstrous, Mr. Smith." Her voice was clear and calm,
but it had a stony quality to it as though it came from a rigid
throat. "There is some hideous mistake here which you will be
able to put right for me very easily. <i>Of course I</i> am
innocent of these preposterous charges. <i>Of course</i> Mrs.
Green is the woman wanted." She shut her white lips together on
that. And again she swayed.</p>

<p>The horrified Mr. Smith was at her side in a moment. "Surely
there is a mistake, as she says," he urged quickly. "I certainly
think you must let her explain-"</p>

<p>Pointer regretted the suggestion. He would have refused, but
the Chief Constable, with a very grim look, swung round on the
solicitor.</p>

<p>"She can't," he said sternly.</p>

<p>"You can't possibly tell that unless you hear what she has to
say." Mr. Smith was for once speaking as a man and friend, and
not as a lawyer. He felt certain that some hideous and really
ludicrous mistake was being made. Why, he knew Mrs. Richard Avery
well, had known her for some years now! The detective officer
from the Yard, in spite of his ability which imposed itself on
one, had made a bad mistake, because he was a stranger down here.
A few words now, and Mrs. Avery might be spared the horror of
being taken by the police to the station, there to be charged
with the incredible list of deaths and locked up. Mrs. Richard
Avery! Charged! Locked up! That must be prevented.</p>

<p>"I had better explain," Doris spoke in a very controlled
voice. "I recognise what you have there, Mr. Pointer. It is a
letter written by a very foolish woman who bitterly regrets her
folly. It's a letter of mine to my husband," she explained
courteously to the room at large, "saying that I was leaving him,
and was going away with Anthony Revell, and asking him to divorce
me as quickly as possible, so that we could marry. It's also a
letter for which I paid Olive Hill a thousand pounds half an hour
ago, at four o'clock. It was all in one-pound notes. She insisted
on my handing over the money first. She had a package all done
up&mdash;I saw my own writing&mdash;and she 'did' me brown!"
There was no mistaking the rage in Mrs. Avery's voice. "I had to
let her hold on to it. She had a revolver with her. That revolver
there. But she swore I should have the letter to-night. I told
you, Mr. Pointer, that I had no idea where she was&mdash;that I
was uneasy, because I wanted you to find her with the money on
her, of course I couldn't tell you what had just happened. I
<i>couldn't</i> confess my madness. I could only hope that you
might yet get the letter back for me."</p>

<p>Major Weir-Opie looked at her with no softening of his
face.</p>

<p>"It won't do, Mrs. Avery. There's more than that. We have also
in our possession the letter which you wrote to Mr. Anthony and
which brought him back to The Causeway. The letter for which you
poisoned Mr. Avery&mdash;and which you did not find, for all your
searching."</p>

<p>"What letters are these?" asked Mr. Smith, who felt as though
the world as he knew it was crashing about him. Mrs. Richard
Avery had figured in it as Caesar's wife&mdash;only a beautiful
one&mdash;above and immune from gossip.</p>

<p>"The letter sent to you to forward to the police was one I
wrote to my husband just before Anthony got engaged to Olive
Hill." Doris made a curious gesture of defeat and weariness. "I
wrote in it that he and I had been lovers for over a year. Of
course that wasn't true. I had quite misunderstood just ordinary
civility, and lost my head. It was Olive Hill he was in love
with. I made the mistake other women have made before, and will
make again, of thinking that I was the attraction. But, as soon
as I had posted it, I learnt the truth, and incidentally the
truth about whom I really loved after all&mdash;my own husband,
not Anthony. When I came home and learnt of the engagement
between Olive and Anthony it cured me as though by magic. I
thought I would go out of my mind, when I reflected on what I had
written. You know Richard, Mr. Smith. You know how he would never
forgive or forget such a letter. He would hold it as true, no
matter what proof to the contrary he had. I nearly went mad, I
think. The news that Anthony had shot himself didn't help me.
That letter was on its way. That mad, lying letter. But I was
saved after all. I got a cable from Richard showing that he had
already started for home before I had posted it. Oh, the relief!"
For a second her face mirrored it. "The relief! I wrote to Freddy
Anstruther, his secretary out there, told him that I had just
posted a letter to my husband which I now wanted not forwarded to
him but returned to me unopened. I didn't care what Freddy
thought. I knew he would do as I asked. He's an old friend. He
did. I got it&mdash;as I thought&mdash;and destroyed it. But I
begin to see now that I was 'done' there, too, by dear little
Mousie. Let me look at that letter you have, Mr. Pointer," she
urged. "The letter supposed to be mine, enclosed by Miss Hill in
her envelope to Mr. Smith?"</p>

<p>Pointer handed the pages to Major Weir-Opie. He would have
nothing to do with this scene. Doris studied it very attentively,
also the covering letter from young Freddy Anstruther. Then she
turned away. She was proud of her brains, but she had been
tricked by Olive Hill. That was, Pointer thought, the sharpest
sting for a moment.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but she left it with me with instructions to hand
it to the Chief Inspector here&mdash;or failing him to the police
should she not herself ask for it back by four o'clock." Mr.
Smith's brain was beginning to function again. "That showed that
she was afraid&mdash;of just what has apparently happened." He
ended up, and he looked very hard at Mrs. Avery.</p>

<p>"Evidently," Doris agreed, "but not from me. She had asked me
to meet her here at four precisely and hand over a thousand
pounds in return for that letter. Some one else, probably a
confederate, was in the plot with her, and shot her, getting away
with the money. It's nowhere to be seen and it certainly isn't on
her. It was a bulky wad of notes. I'm perfectly willing to be
searched, and have my rooms at the rectory searched." She turned
to Pointer, who did not accept the challenge until the Chief
Constable turned to him. And then he answered him and him
alone.</p>

<p>"They're probably planted somewhere in this house. That's why
the Cottage was chosen, I fancy. It's no use Mrs. Avery assuring
us that Olive Hill chose this place for the meeting. She did
that. Because it was Mrs. Green's. So that when Miss Hill was
found dead, it would look like her work, like the crime of a
woman who hated Miss Hill. And the letter she came to sell Mrs.
Avery wasn't this one. Nor a copy of this one. This was her
anchor to windward, she thought. The letter she offered to sell
was the letter that brought Mr. Anthony back to The Causeway, and
so to his death."</p>

<p>Doris gave a contemptuous laugh.</p>

<p>"That's about as true as the other things that you have been
saying!"</p>

<p>"Look here," said Weir-Opie, "this painful scene has gone on
long enough. To end it, let me say this, Mrs. Avery, that your
letter&mdash;the original&mdash;is at the police station. It
runs"&mdash;he opened his note-book and read:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">"Tell the Gartsides you must run up to your
dentist in town. Be in The Causeway drawing-room to-morrow night.
I will come at twelve, to the minute. The girl you love is in a
terrible dilemma. Do not fail us and do not write to her. She
will be with me."</p>

<br>

<p>"Well?" Doris asked quietly. She looked normal again, except
for her deadly pallor. "It is true that I wrote that note. But I
did not go. Olive went alone. She begged me at the last to let
her go by herself. She was a thief&mdash;as well as a
blackmailer&mdash;and some one was threatening her with a
prosecution unless she paid back a large sum which they had
traced at last to her, and which she had lost at the races. I
told Mr. Avery as much on the Sunday night. You see, Mr. Pointer,
you are not quite clever enough to understand Olive Hill, just as
I was not. As no one was. Certainly not Anthony Revell. But I do
not think that she shot Anthony."</p>

<p>"Neither do I," Weir-Opie said, as she paused.</p>

<p>"No, Mrs. Green did that. From jealousy. I was not jealous.
She was. I am beginning to think that she instigated Olive to
offer me that letter you have&mdash;the letter to
Anthony&mdash;for the thousand pounds so that she could take it
from her and Olive would not be in a position to fight back. But
Olive did try to fight, and Mrs. Green gladly shot her. Every one
knows how she loathed her. She is now, of course, safely in
hiding."

<h2><a name="ch20"></a>CHAPTER TWENTY</h2>

<p class="first">"As for Mr. Avery," Doris's even voice continued,
"No one poisoned him. What must have happened was that the little
that I had to tell him about Olive's trouble so bothered him that
he himself made a mistake and filled one of the bottles standing
on the shelf&mdash;one without a label and without a bell on it,
then, still thinking deeply, he must have carried it into his
study&mdash;and got it mixed with the mushroom ketchup on his
tray. No one can say just what happened. But I feel sure, I
always have felt sure, that no one poisoned him. It was an
accident, pure and simple."</p>

<p>Mr. Smith was looking at her very attentively. Perhaps this
was the truth. But he was shaken&mdash;badly shaken...</p>

<p>Pointer looked at Doris with his clear passionless gaze. At
last he spoke to her.</p>

<p>"There are bloodstains on the soles of your shoes, yet when we
got here the blood in the other room was quite dry. Besides, you
were not allowed to walk about at all."</p>

<p>Doris's face sagged as she tucked her feet under her chair.
She had been sitting with her knees crossed.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith's face was eloquent. One horrified glance before she
altered her position, and he had seen the stains of which Pointer
spoke. He stood back with a gesture that spoke for itself.</p>

<p>Superintendent Shilling took his place. The two men at the
door came forward. A moment more, and Doris Avery was seated
between the Superintendent and one of his constables in the
car.</p>

<p>Each had an arm linked through one of hers. All three sat in a
dreadful silence as the car rushed by a back street to the police
station.</p>

<p>In the room at the cottage Mr. Smith passed a hand over his
face.</p>

<p>"I cannot undertake her defence," he said in a low voice, as
he reached for his hat and, without another word, made for his
car. Weir-Opie waited till it had driven off, then he turned to
Pointer. "You must tell me later how you arrived at the
incredible truth in this affair. Shilling nearly fainted from
shock. So the motive had nothing to do with the stamps, nor with
the question of Anthony's identity?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Jealousy. Clear enough," Pointer said. "Mad
infatuation for Mr. Anthony. There was a love affair between them
which had lasted over a year, according to this letter to her
husband."</p>

<p>He stopped. Another police car had arrived, of an odd, covered
shape. There was a stretcher inside. Four men with it got out,
and two of them, quickly lifting Olive's body on to it, drove off
by the way they had come. The other two were to stay behind in
the cottage.</p>

<p>Weston came down the short stairs. "The money is there, sir, a
thousand pounds in one-pound notes, planted in Mrs. Green's
bedroom, as you suggested. Stuffed into the back of the drawer
under some clothes. And, as you thought there would be, I found
bloodstains on 'em."</p>

<p>Pointer and the Major went up to the room which Mrs. Green
used as a bedroom. They took the notes away with them in their
own car.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Avery believes in doing things thoroughly," the Chief
Constable said dryly.</p>

<p>"Quite so, sir. Mrs. Green was, of course, meant to be found
at the cottage with them and the body. Something evidently
detained her and spoilt the plan."</p>

<p>"Well, we got at least this out of that harrowing scene with
Mrs. Avery," the Major said when back at the station: "we know
what her defence will be. I mean about the letter she sent to her
husband."</p>

<p>"This other letter to her husband was posted at her own home
on the day she returned from her mother's to the rectory."
Shilling was studying the postmark. "That first time she went
home because of her mother's illness."</p>

<p>Weir-Opie nodded. "As soon as she got back, she heard of his
engagement to Miss Hill, and she went mad. I think that murder of
Anthony was a <i>crime passionel</i> if ever there was one!"</p>

<p>"Especially as just then she must have got the news that Mr.
Richard Avery was coming home a wealthy man." Shilling had a
capital memory for dates.</p>

<p>"By Jove," Weir-Opie said under his breath, "what a position
for her! By her own doing, she had lost a wealthy husband for the
sake of a chap who had no love for her and was going to marry
another woman!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and another woman whom she had put in his way." Pointer
slowly lit his pipe. The other two were smoking also. "From what
Miss Avery said, and from what Mrs. Avery said, and let drop, I
think that some one had begun to comment on Mr. Anthony's visits
to the rectory, or attentions to Mrs. Avery."</p>

<p>"I rather think that may have been the rector himself,"
Weir-Opie rightly guessed. "He looked very troubled about that
time."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Avery very likely put forward an entirely fictitious
interest on Mr. Revell's part in Miss Hill as a shield," Pointer
continued.</p>

<p>"And then she had to go off to her mother's!" Shilling said
excitedly, "and leave them together for a fortnight. That was
what did it!"</p>

<p>"Just so," Pointer agreed. "When she got back she found that
Mr. Anthony really was in love with Miss Hill and, as you say,
sir, she found at the same time that her husband, to whom she had
just written this damning letter here, was a rich man coming home
to enter parliament and give her just the kind of life for which,
in a way, she was suited."</p>

<p>"And then as you say she went mad." Weir-Opie spoke with deep
regret.</p>

<p>They could not know about the rector's bringing her the news
of Anthony Revell's death when she had just opened and read the
letter from her husband telling her about their entirely changed
fortunes. To him, as to Grace, she had pretended that the letter
was lost, that Olive had never handed it to her, that the
tremendous mental upheaval in which he found her was her
extravagant grief at its non-arrival. In reality it was the shock
of finding that she had lost, as she feared, what she knew she
could make into a great position.</p>

<p>Only when she received her husband's wire on the way home from
the inquest, and saw how the situation could yet be saved, did
her spirits revive, rise to new buoyancy, and float far above the
mere shooting of Anthony Revell.</p>

<p>Pointer was continuing the talk "She got Mr. Anthony home with
that note there, waited with him for a while probably in the
drawing-room, got him, I think, to lend her his revolver under
plea of not being able to wait longer for Miss Hill, and not
liking to go home unprotected. He would want to wait on for Miss
Hill who knew nothing of the affair."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Avery, too, was most likely a capital shot with a
revolver," Weir-Opie said. "She had spent two years on the Gold
Coast when she was first married to Richard Avery."</p>

<p>"I think it possible that she got him to tie her shoe-lace for
her, and shot him straight through the head as he did so. As she
didn't ask Mr. Anthony to burn this letter to him, nor look for
it apparently at his house, and as none from her were found after
his death, I take it for granted that he always destroyed her
letters."</p>

<p>"And this one, this all-important one he dropped in the car
driving back home," Shilling said, continuing the tale. "It must
have got between the cushions, and Mr. Avery found it on Saturday
night, as you guessed and, as you thought, mistook it for his
sermon notes, and only opened it out in church."</p>

<p>"Odd that Mrs. Avery didn't feel that sermon as a warning,"
mused Weir-Opie aloud in some surprise.</p>

<p>"I don't think she heard one word of it, sir." Pointer
explained where he believed her thoughts to have been.</p>

<p>"She was very happy just then, as we both noticed that
Saturday at dinner. I think she thought that all was going right,
when she got the chance to get back&mdash;unopened&mdash;what she
believed was her letter to her husband, but which was evidently a
clever copy made by Miss Hill. Then came the thunderbolt of
Sunday night when she probably stepped into the study for a
casual goodnight, and the rector handed her her letter to Mr.
Anthony and asked her to explain what was, she hoped, a dead and
buried subject."</p>

<p>"Literally dead and buried!" threw in Shilling, drawing in his
breath.</p>

<p>"She had to improvise something instant and efficacious. We
know what she did. All but emptied the mushroom ketchup bottle
which was on the tray and filled it with the toadstool extract.
By the way, I think she had been able to give Mr. Avery a more
cheerful suggestion about Miss Hill than the one she made to me.
I think it much more likely that she put it on some
disinclination of Miss Hill's to be married in such a rush. Then
came the dreadful attacks of pain from which he died in at most
an hour, the doctor thinks. He knew the truth then, and hid the
all-important letter so successfully."</p>

<p>There was a profound silence.</p>

<p>"But Miss Hill&mdash;where does she come in?" Weir-Opie asked
at last. "Why would she know enough to keep this letter of Mrs.
Richard Avery's to her husband, and fob her off with a copy?"</p>

<p>"I think Miss Hill suspected Mrs. Avery of having shot Mr.
Anthony from the first. She knew, I am certain, that she was in
love with him. She realised, I feel sure, that she was only to be
used as a shield later. She guessed after a little what it was
that Mrs. Avery was hunting for, and hunted for it too. But
meanwhile, she evidently got hold of that letter to Mr. Richard
Avery, which his secretary had returned unopened to the wife.
Miss Hill evidently got that from the post-bag, and enclosed
instead in the original envelopes two forgeries, Mrs. Avery was
naturally easily deceived as to the genuineness of the letters
inside. Probably she barely glanced at them. It would never occur
to Mrs. Avery that Olive Hill could outwit her."</p>

<p>"She wouldn't easily suspect what was being done. Who would?"
said Weir-Opie.</p>

<p>"Miss Hill kept the original as her safety line, I suppose,"
Shilling suggested.</p>

<p>"If so, she relied on it too much. Something made her decide
to get away. I think Mr. Byrd's expedition. He needs money for
that. I fancy she hoped to lend it him and force him to take her
along. Anyway, she bluffed a thousand out of Mrs. Avery,
pretending that she had found what the other had for a time
hunted for so carefully&mdash;her letter to Mr. Anthony."</p>

<p>The telephone rang. It was a constable speaking from the
rectory, where he had been sent to lock up Mrs. Avery's rooms and
stand by the telephone. Mrs. Green had just rung up Miss Hill.
Acting on instructions, the constable had explained that she was
out at the moment, but he could take the message. Mrs. Green
evidently thought it was Fraser speaking, and went on to say that
she had tried to rush back to the cottage by a quarter to four,
since Miss Hill told her she had some most important news for
her. But a serious accident to the motor-bus she was in had
prevented it, and she could not possibly be at the cottage before
half-past six. Mrs. Green had hung up on that, and the constable
had passed on her message&mdash;not to the dead girl, but to the
police.</p>

<p>"The message was sent in the name of Olive Hill, of course,
but here again she was only used as a decoy," said Pointer.
"Criminals repeating themselves," murmured Shilling sagely.</p>

<p>"Lucky accident," said Weir-Opie. "Not that it would have
mattered in the end. Not when we had these letters in our
possession."</p>

<p>"When did you suspect Mrs. Richard Avery?"</p>

<p>"When she only searched the library, sir, the one room which I
was certain that the murderer hadn't had time to hunt through the
night before. And there were so many things that fitted. Her
great good looks. Her apparent eagerness to have Mr. Anthony be
thought in love with Miss Hill, which would explain&mdash;and
excuse&mdash;his constant visits to the rectory. Also, if the
letter to Mr. Anthony came from her, it was easy to understand
that he would not write separately to Miss Hill, in the same
house. What more natural than her spokeswoman should be Mrs.
Avery, the headstrong, violent-passioned woman who shot Mr.
Anthony in a fit of fury, and found that it wasn't to stop
there?"</p>

<p>"You foresaw Miss Hill's danger when you left us on Saturday,
I understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. You see, Mrs. Avery wanted Olive Hill out of the
way. For many reasons. Hatred of her because she had taken
Anthony away. Fear of what she suspected. Fear of her determined
hunting at the rectory. But she had to wait for a safe
opportunity. Mrs. Green's unconcealed hatred of the young woman
was that opportunity. Let Olive Hill be killed somewhere where it
looked as though Mrs. Green had done it&mdash;and all would be
well&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She thought!" threw in the Chief Constable.</p>

<p>"Just so, sir, 'she thought!' And Miss Hill was mad enough to
disregard your warning. Did she forget it, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"I think she fancied herself clever enough to outwit Mrs.
Avery, sir. She had scored a great success when she passed off as
Mr. Avery's own, the forged returned letter. I think Miss Hill
thought herself to be far the cleverer of the two&mdash;and
trusted to that. Probably also she thought that, if in a tight
place, she would only have to tell Mrs. Avery about the letter
sent to Mr. Smith&mdash;and she would be safe."</p>

<p>"As she would have had to have been if she had had a chance to
get a word in about it," said Shilling. "But how did you feel so
sure that Miss Hill had been decoyed to the cottage?"</p>

<p>"When Mrs. Avery told me that she had recognised as Mrs.
Green's the voice that she had heard talking to the rector late
on the night when he was killed." Pointer lit his pipe. He needed
it. The last hour had taken it out of him. "Had she really heard
her voice, either she would have recognised it earlier&mdash;or
not at all."</p>

<p>"Especially as Mrs. Avery knows Mrs. Green well," agreed
Weir-Opie, "and she has quick ears. Did she hear any voice at all,
do you think?"</p>

<p>"I don't, sir. Neither the rector's, nor any one else's. I
think she invented that as a possible loophole for herself should
things seem to be closing in a bit. When she told me of having
heard Mrs. Green's voice in the room below her own, I guessed
that she was preparing her final effort&mdash;one which would
free her from Miss Hill and Mrs. Green, too. The latter's
fondness for Anthony Revell was a constant menace to his
murderer. Mrs. Green's cottage was obviously the place to try for
at once when Miss Hill was missing. I had hoped&mdash;half
hoped&mdash;to find her alive."</p>

<p>They went on back to the cottage first of all, and there they
dug out the nurse's cloak, cap and white hair which Olive had
worn when she went to her death. She had not cared very much
whether she were recognised or not. As for the disguise which
Mrs. Avery had on when she sent off the gardener, part of that
was found later in a clearing of the wood, the part which had
consisted of a thick dress worn over her usual frock. The wig and
false eyebrows and gay ribbon on her plain hat, which Doris had
buried farther on, were never found.</p>

<p>Olive had handed to Mrs. Avery another forgery, instead of the
latter's own letter. Mrs. Avery, too white hot with fury to
recognise it as such, quite unaware of Olive's powers in that
line, had snatched it from her, shot her in the same instant and
burnt the paper. Then she had taken from Olive the nurse's outer
garments and the white "front," which, had been bought only a few
hours before at Swan and Edgar's, and put on her head the felt
hat which she usually wore, and which Doris had brought with her,
for she had felt quite sure who the nurse would be. The fur stole
which she folded round the dead shoulders was the girl's own,
which she had herself worn to the Cottage, and hidden under a
cushion while waiting for the blackmailer to walk into the
trap.</p>

<p>It had taken the swift Doris very few minutes in the wood to
restore her usual appearance, get back to the rectory, and run
down to meet Pointer with her worry about Olive's non-appearance.
Incidentally she had thought that he would still be away in Town,
and that it would be Shilling who would find the dead body, and
the artist, and the money, all together at the Cottage.</p>

<p>It was a couple of months later that the three men sat once
again discussing the case, this time in the rooms of the Chief
Inspector at New Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>Doris Avery had just been found guilty on all three counts,
and the jury had only taken a quarter of an hour to bring in
their unanimous verdict.</p>

<p>"You've heard about Byrd?" asked Weir-Opie finally. "No? He's
joined the Salvation Army. The rector has made a sort of
posthumous convert there."</p>

<p>Another short silence followed, it lasted till he broke it to
say:</p>

<p>"The 'wine in the cup&mdash;was red' enough in all conscience!
Is that text on Anthony's grave to stand?"</p>

<p>"Miss Avery, sir, suggests a plain R.I.P. as on Miss Hill's
grave. And I understand that Mrs. Green is having these three
letters carved on Mr. Revell's monument instead of the text that
she had chosen."</p>

<p>There was another silence.</p>

<p>"And of all those who heard the sermon, the one for whom it
was really meant didn't pay any attention to it. That's life!"
Pointer was thinking aloud.</p>

<p>"But <i>you</i> did," the Chief Constable said promptly. "But
for the chance that you heard it, and went over to see the room
where the rector died&mdash;well, a ruthless criminal would have
got off scot free."</p>

<p>"To try her hand at something else of the same kind, most
likely," suggested Superintendent Shilling.</p>
