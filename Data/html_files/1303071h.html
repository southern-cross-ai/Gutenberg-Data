<h2><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>Chapter 1. THE LADY OF
ROVIETO</h2>
<h3>&mdash; i &mdash;</h3>
<p>When his father was hanged, his mother died of a broken
heart.</p>
<p>For the same reason he is known to history merely as Colombo da
Siena. His arms&mdash;azure, a dove statant argent&mdash;are of his
own adoption and, in rebus, merely expressive of his patronymic,
for all that he came of an armigerous house and possessed the right
to a patrician name and to some famous quarterings. Behind his
disdain of one and the other lies the tragedy that was not without
influence on his life. He was, in fact, the only son of that Lord
of Terrarossa, Sigismondo Barberi, whom the Florentines
dispossessed and deservedly put to death for treachery. He was ten
or eleven years of age when he was left orphaned and destitute to
face the world; and that he did not perish is due to a saintly
brother of his mother's, a Franciscan of the Large Observance, who
sheltered him in his early years from evil.</p>
<p>Later, as the lad grew, deepening in resemblance to his mother
and displaying other qualities which endeared him to Fra Franco,
his uncle, the question arose of finding a place for him in life.
The friar would have made a determined attempt to obtain his
reinstatement in the lordship which his father's villainy had
forfeited; and that humble little brother of Saint Francis was not
without influence. But in this he met the sternest opposition from
Colombo.</p>
<p>'Since the forfeiture was deserved and just, it stands as an
expiation. In some sort it serves to cancel the offence. If we
retract a payment, we revive a debt. So, let it be.'</p>
<p>After vain arguments, the friar yielded to the clarity and
honesty of the boy's logic, abandoned the attempts he was setting
on foot, and addressed himself to other prospects for his
nephew.</p>
<p>In later years Colombo would frequently insist that his natural
inclinations were entirely pacific. He loved Nature and would have
found his proper vocation in her service and in agrarian pursuits.
But it also happened that he was equipped with rather more than the
perception which, as his namesake the Genoese navigator was to
demonstrate, is necessary so as to apprehend the obvious. It is, I
fancy, the whole secret of his success in life, as it is of many
another's. It showed him in his nonage that a man born into the
turbulence that constantly distracted the Italian Peninsula in the
second half of the Quattrocento, should make haste to determine
whether he would range himself with the sheep or with the wolves,
since mankind in that time, and particularly in that land of
unrest, offered no further choice.</p>
<p>The sheep were the toilers: the merchants, the peasants, the
craftsmen, the artificers, even the clergy. The wolves were the
princes and those who served them in their quarrels over the soil
upon which those toilers had their being. To be industrious,
productive, law-abiding, was to be in danger of unending
harassment, to be constantly in peril of being plundered, fined,
ruined, or even slaughtered.</p>
<p>Considering all this, Colombo reached the conclusion that if his
natural inclinations did not urge him to become a wolf, even less
did they urge him to remain a sheep.</p>
<p>Thus he states his case. But whilst scarcely conscious of it
himself, his history states it otherwise. Accounting extinguished
the house from which he sprang, there were in him from an early age
the vague stirrings of an ambition to found another, infinitely
more splendid, that should be entirely the work of his own hands
and brain. Since he could not be a descendant without shame, he
would render himself an ancestor of whom his posterity should be
proud.</p>
<p>It is not to be asserted that he had deliberately set out with
this intention when at the age of sixteen we find him trailing a
pike in the service of his native Siena. Rather did the notion grow
in him with his own vigorous and rapid growth until it took
definite shape during that Sicilian campaign when first his name
was blared from Fame's trumpet across the length and breadth of
Italy. He was in his twenty-eighth year by then and he had learnt
the trade of arms under that great soldier Bartolomeo Colleoni.
From modest beginnings in Colleoni's company, with the command of
ten helmets, he had risen rapidly to the position of one of that
famous captain's most trusted lieutenants.</p>
<p>Then, soon after Colleoni entered Venetian service,
Colombino&mdash;by which affectionate diminutive he had come to be
known in the company&mdash;had separated from him, and forming a
small condotta of his own, of a hundred lances, he had taken his
sword, as it were, to Bellona's market-place.</p>
<p>In the Sicilian campaign of which before all was over he was
constrained by the favour of fortune to take complete command on
behalf of Aragon, he won not only fame but enough wealth to acquire
the homestead and vineyard on Montasco, in Sienese territory, which
he was gradually and nobly to extend.</p>
<p>He was resting there after his labours in the summer of 1455,
and with him were two other condottieri who had linked their
fortunes with his own and had come to range themselves under his
banner: the tough, elderly, worldly-wise Florentine soldier of
fortune Giorgio di Sangiorgio, and the portly, jovial Aragonese Don
Pablo Caliente.</p>
<p>I suspect that it would be at about this time that he began to
dream of scaling the summits. He did not lack for models. There was
Colleoni himself, now grown old, but still nominally
Captain-General of the Venetian forces, covered with honour and
lord of great possessions. There was Francesco Sforza, now Duke of
Milan and disputing with Venice the prepotency in the north, whose
beginnings had been as humble as Colombino's. There was Carmagnola,
who had won to sovereignty before he had lost his head. And there
were a dozen others whom Colombino could call to mind who by the
trade of arms had raised themselves to princely estate. Like them
so might he come by the sword to found a dynasty. Already the
Sicilian war had set his feet upon the road to those heights.</p>
<p>Nor were his ambitions a mere greed of power and possessions. He
was imbued with the conviction that where he governed he would
govern wisely and well, so that the governed should bless his name
and find in him, not a ravager, but a protector. He was guided by
ideals belonging to the age of chivalry rather than to his own age,
which was already accounting chivalry a chimera. He entertained
knight-errantly notions of succouring the helpless, of upholding
the weak against the insolent strong; notions to be expressed in a
benign rule, different, indeed, from the ruthless despotism
practised by the Princes of the states that made up Italy.</p>
<p>You realize that much though Colombino had learned in
eight-and-twenty years of a life that had been rich and varied in
its experiences, he had still to learn that in the world of his day
ambition and chivalrous ideals could not journey far as
yoke-fellows. It was about to be demonstrated to him at the date at
which, after this brief prelude, I am about to take up his history,
or, at least, so much of it as it has seemed to me worth while to
assemble from the various sources in which it may be sought.</p>
<p>Scarcely had he come to rest at Montasco, scarcely had he, as it
were, doffed his harness and turned his mind from thoughts of war
to matters concerned with the noble mansion he was building and to
considerations of the husbandry he found so attractive, when the
call reached him to a task that was not merely to weave a dominant
pattern into the tapestry of his destiny, but was to bring a change
into his outlook, and so into his very nature. It was just such a
call as his chivalry must leap to answer. It came from the
Sovereign Countess of Rovieto, that Eufemia de' Santi, who, with
nothing in her life to place her in the memory of posterity, has
yet been given by the brush of Antonello da Messina a fame as
enduring as his canvas.</p>
<p>It was the end of a hot day of August, and Colombino sat at
supper with his two captains in a room of the princely house, a
part of which was still in the making. They were sitting with
windows wide to the welcome breeze of sunset, when from the
distance they heard the hoof-beats that announced a messenger
breasting the hillside.</p>
<p>Someone from Siena, they supposed, until a servant entered with
the letter whose source he announced. When Colombino had read it,
he tossed it to his captains and by a gesture invited their
attention to it.</p>
<p>Sangiorgio took it up, scanned it, frowning, and was thoughtful
at the end. But when Caliente had read it, he, on the contrary, was
moved to jovial satisfaction.</p>
<p>'Praised be Our Lady for this mark of favour. I never hoped we
should find work again before going into winter quarters. It serves
to show that your fame will now give you little rest, Don
Colombo.'</p>
<p>There was a flash of white teeth in the Spaniard's broad,
good-humoured face, with the vivid red lips that told of the rich
abundant blood in his veins, and the heavy jowl that was blue from
the razor. The contrast between him and the tall, angular, and
saturnine Sangiorgio, was stressed now by the fact that the older
man looked as sour as Don Pablo was gay Tugging at his dagger of
grizzled beard, Sangiorgio took the letter again, and read it a
second time.</p>
<p>It was from the Countess of Rovieto, and she wrote at length.
Filippo della Scala, Lord of Verona, was arming to invade her
territory, to enforce a claim to it based on his kinship with her
late husband. The resources of Della Scala, strained by his share
in the long-drawn struggle between Venice and Milan, did not permit
him to engage for his purposes one of the free companies that stood
for hire in Italy Therefore, he had sent his agents into the Swiss
cantons to recruit among the mountaineers who were to be had upon
reasonable terms. This made Time her ally, thanks to the warning
she had received. Forestalling him, it was her aim and hope to
strike the first blow, to invade his territory whilst he was still
unprepared; and when he sued for peace, she would impose such terms
that there would be a definite end to his pretensions. To carry out
this design, she invited into her service Messer Colombo da Siena
and his Company of the Dove.</p>
<p>When at last Sangiorgio looked up, Colombino nodded to him
across the board.</p>
<p>'A woman of spirit, that. A woman who understands the cardinal
principle of war: that attack is the best defence and that victory
often goes to the first blow. A rare woman, on my soul.'</p>
<p>Sangiorgio wrinkled his long beak of a nose, dropped the sheet
with a suggestion of scorn and made a gesture as of dusting his
fingers. 'Rare, yes. I thank God for it. If there were more such
women there would be fewer men.'</p>
<p>Colombino raised his brows; Caliente swung his bulk round as on
a pivot, so as to face his brother captain. Sangiorgio explained
himself.</p>
<p>'Her history is more interesting than savoury You need to learn
something of it. She was born in the year that Lucca broke from
Florence. So that she cannot yet be more than three and twenty; and
already she has disposed of two husbands. The first was a patrician
of the Milanese House of Visconti, an injudicious fool who went
about Rovieto roaring his jealousy of a Roman visitor, Gerolimini,
until he suddenly dropped dead, stricken, most oddly, in midwinter,
by a malarial fever. Faith in that fever is not increased when we
discover that she married Gerolimini three months after Visconti's
death. And then Gerolimini, who suffered from the common ambition
to govern, refused to understand that the consort of a sovereign is
not necessarily a sovereign himself.</p>
<p>'It was a presumption for which a judgment overtook him. He
broke his neck in a fall from his horse, one day whilst hunting. At
least, that is how the records run. He was hunting alone at the
time. When they found him, he was in a supine condition as if he
had been laid out, and no sign of damage or disorder to his
garments.</p>
<p>'As you say, Colombino, a rare woman, and a fortunate. Perhaps
even a dangerous.'</p>
<p>Colombino's answer was cold with reproof. 'At present she is, on
the contrary, a woman in danger.'</p>
<p>'Which is just when such a woman will be most dangerous.'</p>
<p>'Shall we leave old wives' ill-natured gossip, and come to
business?' Colombino pointed to the letter. 'What concerns me is
her desire to hire us.'</p>
<p>But Sangiorgio was not to be reproved out of his sardonic
pessimism.</p>
<p>'It may well concern you. I ask myself how does she propose to
pay Her father, Todescano, all but ruined Rovieto before he died.
She, following with filial piety in the footsteps of her
spendthrift sire, has completed Rovieto's bankruptcy Della Scala,
she says here'&mdash;and contemptuously he flicked the
document&mdash;'is without resources to hire one of the mercenary
companies in Italy She, with still fewer ducats, invites the
Company of the Dove into her service. How will she pay for it? I
ask again.'</p>
<p>'That is what I had better go and ascertain,' said
Colombino.</p>
<p>'I could make a guess that would save you the trouble.'</p>
<p>'Ribaldry is natural to an old soldier.'</p>
<p>'And credulity to a young one. I began that way myself. I've
learnt wisdom since, which you call ribaldry. And that letter
wouldn't take me to Rovieto.'</p>
<p>'I shall set out tomorrow,' said Colombino quietly.</p>
<p>'Is she beautiful at least?' Don Pablo asked his brother
captain.</p>
<p>'They say so.'</p>
<p>'Then why scowl? Or are you so old that you've forgotten
everything? A beautiful woman, Giorgio, is worth any journey.'</p>
<p>Sangiorgio looked from the smiling Don Pablo to the thoughtful
Colombino.</p>
<p>'God help you both,' he said, and gave his attention to the
wine.</p>
<h3>&mdash; ii &mdash;</h3>
<p>As prompt in action as he was swift in decision&mdash;and it has
been said that this was the whole secret of his successes&mdash;he
was in the saddle before sunrise on the morrow, riding down the
slopes of Montasco to take the road north, with ten lances to
escort him and lend him consequence.</p>
<p>His dispositions had all been made last night before seeking his
bed; and since speed was of the first importance, they were made on
the assumption, ignoring Sangiorgio's pessimism, that the business
side of the matter would be agreeably settled.</p>
<p>To his captains his orders were to marshal, equip, and follow
with the Company of the Dove. In those days its strength was of
three hundred lances of three men to the lance, and at the moment
these were at rest in quarters provided for them up and down the
Sienese contado. Further, his captains were provisionally to enlist
Falcone's condotta of three hundred men which was known to be idle
at Imola and any other small free companies that should suffice to
make up a total strength of two thousand men, which Colombino
accounted sufficient for the business.</p>
<p>Nor did he neglect other matters. He held, before sleeping, a
long consultation with his steward Palombari on matters concerned
with his building plans and also with the planting of some vines
that were being brought from the district of Orvieto, which
Colombino believed should do well in the soil of Montasco.</p>
<p>Three days later he was at Rovieto, and his meeting with the
Countess Eufemia was one of mutual surprises.</p>
<p>Lightly though he might have held Sangiorgio's account of her,
yet enough of it had remained in his mind to lead him to expect to
look upon a Maenad. Instead he found a child, as it seemed to him;
and this not merely in years, but in spirit; for Colombino still
nourished the belief that a countenance is the mirror of the soul,
and here he beheld a countenance that was all candour, gentleness,
and golden loveliness. So slight and virginal and innocent of
aspect was she as to defy belief that she was in her second
widowhood, and to put to shame the vile slanders of which
Sangiorgio, by more than innuendo, had made himself the
mouthpiece.</p>
<p>On her side she had expected, from Colombino's name, to behold a
diminutive man. She had drawn a mental picture of him short and
sturdy and most likely bow-legged from the saddle, one who as a
result of his trade would be rude and uncouth. Instead she beheld a
tawny-headed youngster, some six feet tall, broad at the shoulders,
tapering thence to the waist and over lean, athletic flanks to the
ground. His shaven face, with its starkly defined bone structures,
its lofty brow and powerful jaw, its dark solemn eyes and stern
mouth, was remarkable, if not for beauty, at least for strength.
Borrowing assurance from success, he bore himself with the airs of
a great prince, and he came dressed like one, in a fur-trimmed
houppelande of dove-grey velvet, with a girdle of hammered gold and
a heavy gold-hilted dagger on his hip.</p>
<p>Her eyes on their first sight of him, when he stepped into her
council chamber, fell away as if before an effulgence. Then they
returned, not only to observe but to admire; and this with a
boldness which the mere softness of her eyes translated into
candour.</p>
<p>His reception was formal, which did not at all surprise him, for
he had already learned that states are very much like individuals,
and that the smaller their consequence the greater is the ceremony
with which they seek to inflate it.</p>
<p>The officer of the guard who received him in the courtyard of
the citadel passed him on to a chamberlain, who in turn delivered
him over to a gentleman-usher, by whom he was conducted to the
council chamber where her highness waited.</p>
<p>On a shallow dais at the head of the council table she was
enthroned in a great gilded chair of state, which should have lent
importance to her, but merely served to stress her small daintiness
and childlike airs. At the table, three on her right, and two on
her left, sat the five members of the Council of Rovieto, all of
them elderly, sober-looking men. These five rose as Colombino
entered and inclined their heads in greeting. The Countess,
retaining her exalted seat, graciously waved him to the foot of the
table, where a stool had been set, and invited him to sit.</p>
<p>Then, when the others had rustled down again into their places,
drawing their robes about their knees, it was the Countess herself
who addressed him. She uttered a few words of welcome and of thanks
for his prompt response to her appeal, stilted words which had been
obviously prepared for the occasion, and then, more fluently, she
came at once to an exposition of her needs and her intentions.</p>
<p>Whilst these elaborated the matter of her letter, they added so
little to the information which it had contained that he was almost
impatient for the end of her address. And scarcely had she ceased
when he was speaking.</p>
<p>'Yes, yes,' he approved her closing words. 'It is ever the first
blow that counts the most. Often, when it strikes one who is
unprepared for it, it proves the last.' Whilst his eyes were fully
and squarely upon her, he was conscious that the five councillors
had turned their heads in his direction and were owlishly regarding
him. He went smoothly on. 'Already I have so disposed that my
lances should be here by Sunday. By Tuesday of next week I should
cross the frontiers of Verona. I'll be upon Della Scala before he
is even aware that I am marching.'</p>
<p>Eyes as blue as the Adriatic shone upon him with intoxicating
wonder. Sensuous lips, alluringly red in the winsome pallor of the
little face, were parted in a sudden smile. 'The eagle or the hawk
were a more proper device for you, Ser Colombino, than the
dove.'</p>
<p>'Della Scala shall say that presently.' He rose, swaggering a
little and displaying himself, his glance enveloping her like a
flame; and so they remained, absurdly, staring at each other, until
one of the councillors cleared his throat with a rasping sound,
which in itself was a herald of hostility.</p>
<p>It was old Della Porta, the dean of the Council, who thus
harshly broke the spell that was settling upon those children. Lean
and vulturine with his bald head and long beak of a nose, he sat
forward, tapping the table with his knuckly fingers. He was a
practical man who took his office seriously and whose humour
consequently had been soured by endless endeavours to check the
wayward wastefulness of his mistress. He had been dismayed by her
highhanded resolve to call in a mercenary company which they had
not the means to pay, and he was rendered now the more impatient of
these assumptions that already all was settled where yet there had
been no mention of a contract or its essentials.</p>
<p>'And the terms, Messer Colombo?'</p>
<p>Colombino, still with his eyes upon the Countess, scarcely
seemed to awaken. He sighed audibly. Ah! The terms?'</p>
<p>His vagueness went to swell Della Porta's irritation.</p>
<p>'The terms, indeed. We must know to what we engage
ourselves.'</p>
<p>The other four grumbled their concurrence.</p>
<p>By his peremptory tone Della Porta had drawn at last the
Captain's eyes upon himself.</p>
<p>Considering that gaunt unloveliness, the young man descended
from his ecstasy. He remembered that he had to find wages for his
troops.</p>
<p>He sat down again, and leaned his elbow on the table. It was not
clear to any why, indeed, he had risen. He became coldly
practical.</p>
<p>'The monthly pay of a lance in the Company of the Dove is twenty
ducats, with fifty ducats each for my two captains, and say thirty
ducats each for some three other captains of fortune who will be
enrolled with their companies, so as to make up a strength of two
thousand men, which I judge necessary for the enterprise. Then
there will be ten ducats apiece for the sutlers of the Company, of
whom there will be fifty. And, of course, the rationing of my
troops and the fodder for their horses will be your affair during
the term of our engagement.'</p>
<p>One of the councillors groaned, another swore softly. Della
Porta, in tight-lipped silence, was setting down figures on a
sheet. Colombino watched the quill as it scratched and spluttered,
yet conscious that Madonna's eyes were upon him the while. At last
the bald old councillor flung down the pen in an obvious heat. His
face was white.</p>
<p>'In round figures that will be not less than twenty thousand
ducats a month.'</p>
<p>Colombino spread his elegant hands. 'War is not cheap. You'll
observe, sirs, that no provision has yet been made for wastage in
the course of the campaign, loss of horses, tents, munitions, and
the like, which it is impossible to estimate in advance. Nor do
your figures include any provision for myself. Normally I require a
thousand ducats on the contract, a thousand ducats monthly as my
pay, and three thousand ducats upon the successful close of a
campaign.'</p>
<p>The Council became visibly agitated. 'God save us!' exclaimed
one of its members, whilst another in sour sarcasm offered the
comment: 'You grow rich at that trade, sir.'</p>
<p>Colombino smiled into his eyes. Upon occasion he could employ,
said Caliente, a smile that would have melted the heart of a
Gorgon.</p>
<p>'If I do, it is an assurance that I close my campaigns
successfully.' He had hardly at this date undertaken as many as the
answer would imply. But it sufficed to silence his critic.</p>
<p>Della Porta was stroking his bald head in agitation. At last he
exploded into speech.</p>
<p>'We have not the means, sir. I must be frank. We have not the
means to pay you.' And with a reproachful eye on the Countess, he
added: 'We had not the right to bring you here.'</p>
<p>Ignoring him, her silvery voice followed swiftly upon his
raucousness.</p>
<p>'You said, I think, "normally," Ser Colombino.' She was leaning
forward and there was entreaty in every delicate line of her. 'Can
that mean that it is in your generous mind to make an exception
from your norm?'</p>
<p>'Unless it is, sir,' interposed a councillor named Pagolo, 'your
journey to Rovieto has been vain.' He was almost rude. 'I'll be
even more frank than Messer Della Porta. Our treasury is empty, and
taxation has so drained our people that little more is to be
extracted, however much we squeeze them.'</p>
<p>'Messer Pagolo,' the lady's voice reproved him, and there was a
touch of acid in its sweetness, 'we did not bring Messer Colombo
here to weary him with Rovietan politics...'</p>
<p>'What I ask myself, madonna, is why we brought him here at
all.'</p>
<p>Colombino's sudden rising silenced the general ill-humoured
rumblings that applauded Messer Pagolo. He stood squarely
confronting the Countess and his question was a challenge.</p>
<p>'Is this, indeed, the case?'</p>
<p>She winced under his peremptoriness. She seemed to shrink in her
vast chair of state, and to grow yet smaller and more childlike, so
that his heart reproached him for the brutality he used. There was
a breathless fluttering of her bosom, and very wistfully she fell
to studying her fine white hands where they lay in the lap of her
gown of royal blue. She fetched a sigh for only eloquent
answer.</p>
<p>'Alas!'</p>
<p>A moment he stood in silence, straight and tense, his solemn
eyes inscrutably considering her. In that moment he took one of his
swift decisions.</p>
<p>'I am dismissed then? You are not to engage me?'</p>
<p>But it was Della Porta who made bold to answer him. 'Not unless
you can materially abate your terms.'</p>
<p>The Captain, however, did not seem to hear him; for with his
eyes upon the Countess he continued to wait for her reply. None
came. She sat with those demurely folded hands, her abashed gaze
lowered to them, a stricken little figure, calculated to awaken all
a man's chivalry by its lovely wistfulness. Sangiorgio had he been
present would have accused her of depending upon the eloquence of
her silence. But in the absence of that curmudgeon, Colombino heard
only the voice of his ideals, of his knightly aspirations to
succour the afflicted, and of something more. Here in this lovely
lady, beset by a greedy enemy who proposed to dispossess her, with
none to lean upon in her hour of need save these unfeeling
cross-grained dotards, was a subject for chivalrous endeavour.</p>
<p>He turned at last to the council table. 'Messer Della Porta,
will you give me leave alone with her highness for a little while?'
The question was a dismissal that included his brethren with Della
Porta.</p>
<p>But the councillor scowled. 'To what end, sir? We here compose
the Council of Rovieto, and it is our sacred duty...'</p>
<p>He got no further. Madonna Eufemia cut into the pompous sentence
with a voice suddenly sharp. 'You have leave to go. All of
you.'</p>
<p>Della Porta made as if to speak, then checked, and expressed by
the compression of his lips his awareness of the futility of
resistance. He rose, bowed, not without a suspicion of irony, and
waved his fellow councillors before him from the chamber.</p>
<p>There was a spell of silence between the soldier and the lady
after the door had closed. She sat very stiffly in her tall chair,
grasping the arms of it, whilst he paced the length of the room, on
the grey walls of which frescoed vermilion demi-lions climbed to
the groined ceiling. When he came to a halt before her, it was to
perch himself unceremoniously on the edge of the massive board. His
houppelande fell open, and he swung a long, shapely, vigorous leg
that was clad in creaseless grey like all the rest of him.</p>
<p>Still at a loss for words to express the thing in his mind, he
continued to consider with reverent eyes this woman who seemed made
for love, whilst she, fluttering a little under his odd regard,
waited for him to break the silence.</p>
<p>At last he approached the position by one of those skirmishes on
the flank which he had found so profitable in the field.</p>
<p>'It is being said of me, madonna, that I am as hard in a bargain
as in action. And God knows it's true enough. I have been inclined
to adapt my prices to the needs of those who hire me, rather than
to the work that is to do. Considering your desperate need, I came
intending to ask twice what I have asked for my condotta and twice
the sum I have named as my own price. Upon perceiving your
necessitous condition, I halved my pretensions. Considering
further, madonna, it comes now to this: that my price to serve you
shall be what you choose to make it.'</p>
<p>'What...What I choose to make it?' Ingenuous eyes of heavenly
blue opened wider in candid wonder. 'What I choose to make it?'</p>
<p>'It is no riddle, lady' There was a kindling in his voice. 'It
is not for a slave to talk of wages.'</p>
<p>'A slave?'</p>
<p>He stood up again.</p>
<p>'It is what the lovely sight of you has made me.'</p>
<p>There was a startled, questioning wonder in her glance. Then a
smile that was no more than a deprecatory shadow flitted across
that little face, pale as a lenten rose.</p>
<p>'You have known me less than an hour.'</p>
<p>'That is just the time that I have loved you.'</p>
<p>Thus, judging the moment come, he staked all upon that
bombardment. Either the citadel would lower the bridge to him, or
he would be beaten back in rout, a presumptuous assailant who
challenged more than he could sustain.</p>
<p>It brought her to her feet abruptly, her countenance now aflame,
and her voice held the warmth of injured pride.</p>
<p>'You go very fast, sir.'</p>
<p>'Always, madonna. Speed makes for victory.'</p>
<p>'I am a woman, not a fortress.'</p>
<p>'I thank God for it.'</p>
<p>At this she began a laugh that changed into a sob, and left him
puzzled. She stepped down from the dais, as if to approach him;
then she checked and set a hand to her broad, low brow. It was a
gesture of bewilderment, almost of helplessness.</p>
<p>'Let me understand. Do you say that because of...because of
this, you will serve me without guerdon?'</p>
<p>'Without guerdon, madonna, beyond such guerdon as love
claims.'</p>
<p>'Oh! Oh!' She was white again and breathless. Her lips twisted
scornfully 'Not so nobly selfish, after all. You are to be paid,
then, when all is said.'</p>
<p>'What I am paid in love I can pay back. In love there are no
debts.'</p>
<p>'I am at school, I think.'</p>
<p>'Have done!' he cried. 'I'll not be mocked.'</p>
<p>'I see. I am to take your insolence seriously'</p>
<p>But the masterful young captain accounted that skirmishing had
gone far enough. He put forth a hand, and pulled her to him. Thus,
abruptly, she found herself in his arms, her breast against his
breast, his eyes probing her own, as if to scan the soul within
their limpid depths.</p>
<p>Startled, ruffled, by his hands, affronted by his assumptions,
she struggled with the fierceness of a kitten, but struggled with
an increasing feebleness, until at last, as if her strength were
spent, she lay resigned, her head against his shoulder. And then,
accounting this a surrender, without more ado he bowed his tawny
head and kissed her on the lips.</p>
<p>She grew heavier against him, as if faint, her round eyes narrow
now and a queer smile at the corners of her mouth. She sighed.</p>
<p>By your coils I judge you more colubrine than columbine.'</p>
<p>'So that my coils hold you, their nature is no matter. I may be
a dove in name, but I am a hawk by nature. Where I stoop, I bind.'
His ardent young lips played over her face and neck, and set her
quivering. 'When will you marry me?'</p>
<p>At that question she grew suddenly not merely still, but
stiff.</p>
<p>'Marry you?' quoth she, aghast.</p>
<p>'What else were you supposing?'</p>
<p>'Mother in Heaven! Not content, my dove, to be a hawk, you
aspire to become an eagle.'</p>
<p>'Would you mate with less?'</p>
<p>'It is the mating that would make you so,' she proudly reminded
him.</p>
<p>He smiled. 'Yet without that mating you are unmade. Della Scala
will drive you from your eyrie. I ask no more than I can earn: to
share the nest I shall have preserved.'</p>
<p>She delivered herself from his arms and stood confronting him.
If still by her slightness suggesting the child, yet there was a
dignity about her that was of the woman accustomed to command.</p>
<p>'Is that your price?'</p>
<p>'When you shall have confessed that you love me. Not
before.'</p>
<p>'You need that, too?' She laughed as she looked up at him. 'You
would fit the place, for you were surely born to rule. You command
all things. Even love. Oh, yes. You command that, my lord.' And
then sharply, she concluded: 'I'll marry you when you have broken
Della Scala.'</p>
<p>Some little colour kindled in his cheeks. His eyes sparkled. 'I
am content,' he said, and there he checked his exultation so as to
deal once more with matters practical. 'I will ask, then, only that
you provide the ducats for my lances.'</p>
<p>The intrusion of business at such a moment shocked her, as her
countenance announced. 'Lord! Will you palter? With a princedom in
your grasp?' Then she showed him that she, too, could be practical
even amid transports. 'Levy the means to pay your men from the
Veronese when you invade them.'</p>
<p>'It is contrary to usage,' he objected. 'And it is imprudent
until the end is assured.'</p>
<p>She flung back her head the better to laugh at him. But all that
he noticed was the lovely line of her neck that was thus displayed
more fully.</p>
<p>'Usage? By my faith, we conform with usage, you and I, as we do
with prudence. You've yet to face the Council with this bond of
ours.'</p>
<p>'With you beside me I'd face Hell unshaken.'</p>
<p>Upon that assurance he gathered her to him and kissed her again,
then let her go recall her councillors, who waited glooming in the
outer gallery.</p>
<p>When she had told them of the bond, but not how it was forged,
Della Porta, perceiving a harlotry in this, was once again
confirmed in his conviction that he served a woman whose wickedness
was unfathomable.</p>
<p>Similar was Sangiorgio's view when, a week later, he marched the
glittering Company of the Dove and the enrolled auxiliaries up to
the walls of Rovieto and encamped it in the meadows by the
river.</p>
<p>'So that's the price she pays you for your service! Body of God!
I might have guessed that it would be just so that she would mend
her bankruptcy, abusing your youth and your...'</p>
<p>'No more of your infamies!' roared Colombino in a sudden
white-heat of passion. 'It is of the family of all the other lies
that are published against her. And you are no better than a bawdy
fishwife that you must be retailing them. It was not she, let me
tell you, who offered the price. It was I who demanded it.'</p>
<p>'You would suppose so,' growled Sangiorgio, unabashed, his
leathern, weather-beaten cheeks aglow with anger.</p>
<p>'Suppose it? Do I not know what passed?'</p>
<p>'To be sure, you'll believe you do. There's nothing clumsy in
that woman's arts. She looks like a saint in a cathedral window.
Are you married yet?'</p>
<p>Colombino controlled his wrath. He answered loftily 'That is for
when Della Scala is broken.'</p>
<p>'I could find it in my heart to pray he breaks you instead. It
might prove the lesser evil. Her husbands are not lucky,
Colombino.'</p>
<p>But at this Colombino loosed his passion again, and it was such
as Sangiorgio had never yet seen in one who normally was of a calm
rarely found in men of twice his years. He came striding across the
tent towards his captain, his hand reaching for the dagger on his
hip.</p>
<p>'The Devil burn your filthy tongue, Giorgio! Will you make it
the agent of scandal about that sweet saint? Go look in her face,
you fool, and behold in it the evidence of your baseness.'</p>
<p>Sangiorgio was a brave man; but he was also prudent. He deemed
it best to drop a subject so inflammatory But as he went thereafter
about the business of his command, he seemed to his men and to his
fellow officers to be suffering from loss of spirit.</p>
<p>Three days later the Company of the Dove departed on its warlike
errand. With blare of trumpets, with azure and silver bannerols
fluttering above a forest of spears, trailing in its wake a great
siege train of arbalests and rams and leathern cannon hooped with
steel, it paraded under the walls of Rovieto thronged with
townsfolk, and past the Tower of Luna, from the battlements of
which the Countess viewed it, her Council in attendance.</p>
<p>Colombino rode last of all, with two esquires to bear his lance
and shield and helm. Save for his tawny head, encased in a
skull-cap of crimson velvet, he was in armour, a glittering silver
figure on a white charger, whose housings of blue and silver
trailed almost to the ground. He raised his mace aloft to salute
the Countess as he passed, and the slight, fair, childlike figure
waved a blue scarf to him in answer.</p>
<h3>&mdash; iii &mdash;</h3>
<p>Colombino came down upon the Veronese with the swift, sudden
fury of a summer hurricane. It is a method of campaigning that has
distinguished other great soldiers before and since his day, and
one that presently came to be regarded as his normal practice.</p>
<p>Della Scala, whose agents were still levying troops in the
cantons, was taken completely by surprise. It passed his
understanding. Building confidently upon the state of exhaustion of
the Rovietan treasury, and the Countess Eufemia's consequent
inability to raise an army against him, he had been going leisurely
about his preparations and was still entirely unready. That of all
mercenary companies the Company of the Dove should have been hired
to invade him increased his wonder and his rage. He had heard of
the exorbitancy of Colombo da Siena. Where had the Countess found
the gold Messer Colombo would demand before he would put an army in
the field? He set his spies to discover the answer to this
question, and he raged the more when eventually they brought it to
him. If Colombino should, indeed, come to reign in Rovieto, as the
consort of the Countess, the Lord of Verona would never again find
it possible to sleep in peace. Such a neighbour, he supposed, would
keep him constantly alert.</p>
<p>From what had happened by the time Della Scala had news of the
compact made, it looked as if that unpleasant future were neither
improbable nor distant. The fortresses of the Veronese had been
going down before the forward sweep of the invader, like so many
Jerichos, at the mere sound of his trumpets. An inadequate army
hastily assembled to hold him in check until reinforcements could
be obtained, and until Verona could be victualled for the siege
that was clearly imminent, was smashed to atoms in a single
engagement with the Company of the Dove.</p>
<p>Within a fortnight of crossing the frontiers of the Veronese,
Colombino had swept up to the walls of Verona. Since the place was
too strong to be carried by assault, at least until hunger should
have emaciated its defenders, he drew up his lines of
circumvallation, linking them across the river, above and below the
city, by chains of barges, and he sat down to besiege it.</p>
<p>Della Scala was reduced to despair. Ruin complete and utter
stared him in the face. Odd countrymen who found their way into the
city brought him news of dreadful ravages in the countryside. Not
only was the Company of the Dove victualling itself by ruthless
raids, but Colombino was paying his lances with gold extorted by
way of indemnities from the fiefs he had reduced. Della Scala swore
in terms picturesquely blasphemous that the man was behaving like a
brigand. He swore, too, a frightful reckoning. This when his rage
was hottest. In cooler moments, realizing his impotency, he doubted
if he would survive to present it. Next, as men do when they see
little prospect of help from man, Filippo della Scala turned his
thoughts to Heaven. He ordered public prayers and processions and
made extravagant votive offerings. Then, coming to doubt the
efficacy of even these spiritual measures, he taxed his wits to
discover physical means of meeting his difficulties.</p>
<p>Here again, both he and his brother Giacomo discovered in
themselves a sterility of invention that was reducing them to
hopelessness until Giacomo, remembering something, conceived the
notion of buying Colombino. Before attempting, however, to act upon
it, the brothers took counsel with their illustrious kinsman,
Agostino della Francesca, whom they held in high esteem for his
learning, his address, and his worldly wisdom.</p>
<p>It was after supper one October evening, by when the siege had
endured a fortnight, that whilst they still sat at table, Filippo
with gloomy candour exposed his anxieties. One slender hope he
still possessed. A captain of his, one Pantaleone, a bold,
resourceful, and devoted fellow was abroad awaiting an opportunity
to bring a convoy through the lines on some dark night. If he
succeeded, then Verona revictualled might be in case to hold out
until the besiegers should be compelled to go into winter quarters.
If that happened, then, by the following spring, Della Scala
reinforced should be able to give a very different account of
himself.</p>
<p>Agostino shook his auburn head. Like his cousins, he was a tall,
big-boned man, yet of a peculiar grace which they entirely lacked.
Virile, there was yet something oddly effeminate about him,
something curiously androgynous in the beauty of his face, and
particularly about the mouth which, wide and full-lipped, was at
once sensual and cruel.</p>
<p>'Colombo will be as aware of this as you are. From what I know
of him, he is capable in such conditions of protracting the siege
into winter.'</p>
<p>'That,' cried Filippo, 'is impossible! Such a thing has never
happened.'</p>
<p>'But it may with this fellow. He has a gift for innovations. Nor
in your place should I count for a moment upon Pantaleone's
deceiving the vigilance of his lines.'</p>
<p>This put Filippo out of temper. Whilst he sought advice, he
desired none that should destroy his already too slender hopes. The
younger Della Scala intervened.</p>
<p>'Impatience will not serve, Filippo, nor is our weakness
repaired by being ignored. Let us rather recognize it, and seek how
it may be countered.' After which exordium, Giacomo introduced the
only notion in which he found grounds for real hope.</p>
<p>But again Agostino shook his head. 'To offer a bribe is merely
to encourage him by advertising your own weakness.'</p>
<p>'Does that matter if he accepts?'</p>
<p>'Why should you suppose he will?'</p>
<p>'His father was Barberi of Terrarossa. These things run in the
blood, and like his father, Messer Colombo will have his
price.'</p>
<p>'Maybe. But have you gold enough to pay it? This dove flies
high. You tell me, yourselves, that he plays for the sovereignty of
Rovieto as the consort of the Countess. What can you set in the
scales against that?'</p>
<p>'What then?' roared Filippo, like a goaded bull. 'In Hell's
name, what then? Must we sit here inert until we starve?'</p>
<p>'You'll not avoid it by listening to counsels of despair,' said
Agostino.</p>
<p>'There are no other counsels left,' Giacomo flung in. He was
irritated almost as deeply as his brother by this logical
opposition. 'You smile at me, Agostino! My God, you can smile! Yet
if we go down in ruin, you will share our fate. You have forgotten
that?'</p>
<p>'I have not. I study to be calm, so that I may keep my wits
about me.'</p>
<p>'And very fruitful they are proving,' sneered Filippo.</p>
<p>But he did not sneer next morning when Agostino brought him the
fruits his wits had borne in the night. They left him aghast. They
were of a perfume that slightly nauseated him at first, and
awakened that scorn of his kinsman which slumbered in the depths of
him, begotten of the difference in their natures.</p>
<p>Agostino propounded his rascally notion without hesitancy or any
tinge of shame. Whilst few men really liked or trusted him, he was,
and knew himself to be, possessed of that indefinable quality which
when exerted women find irresistible. The <i>histoire galante</i>
of this handsome, swaggering Veronese, a tale of easy and
successive triumphs, might well be worth the labour of writing.
Something of a fifteenth-century Casanova, his story would delight
those who have been enthralled by the memoirs of the later Venetian
amorist.</p>
<p>His present scheme was built upon his faith in these powers of
his and upon the widely reputed frailty of the Countess Eufemia.
The task ahead looked easy to him, and this confidence pervaded his
exposition of it to the brothers in that same room where last night
they had dined and where they came now to break their fast.</p>
<p>He would slip out of Verona alone, make his way to Rovieto, and
seek sanctuary at the hands of Madonna Eufemia, representing
himself as a fugitive from the ruthlessness of the Scaligeri. This
alone should lend him interest in the eyes of the Countess. Having
thus won, as it were, across the threshold, it should not take him
long to make himself master of the house. That was his own phrase.
They found it obscure, so he enlightened them with a laughing
frankness scarcely decent.</p>
<p>'I have attractions. At least, so it has been found. And I have
some little experience in these affairs. So, I believe, has Madonna
Eufemia. We should do very well together.'</p>
<p>The brothers stared at him. Then Filippo swore in his black
beard, and asked to know in the name of all the saints how this
lewdness should help Verona.</p>
<p>Agostino, looking from one to other of their puzzled faces,
laughed outright. 'Dullards! Isn't the sequel plain? When I shall
have gathered this fragrant little fruit, when it lies here in the
hollow of my hand, let word of it go to Colombino. That will be the
moment to approach him with your offer of a bribe. Don't you see?
Not only should it tempt him then, when the situation will show him
his risk of losing the greater prize for which he plays, but he
will perceive in the acceptance of it the means to square accounts
with a faithless jade.'</p>
<p>He threw back his head to challenge their applause, a handsome,
glittering figure, as he stood, hand on hip, in a patch of sunlight
from one of the arched windows.</p>
<p>The applause, however, was slow to come. Giacomo's approval was
as gloomy as his countenance.</p>
<p>'Ingenious,' he admitted, and added: 'Infernally ingenious.'</p>
<p>'Infernally, as you say,' grunted Filippo. 'I like things
reasonably decent.'</p>
<p>Agostino opened wide his eyes. His cruel mouth grew
scornful.</p>
<p>'Is this your thanks? I show you a way to save yourselves, I
offer to do the work myself, and incur the risks, and you, Filippo,
can tell me only that you like things decent.' He moved in
agitation about the chamber. 'You'll never have heard, I suppose,
that necessity knows no laws.'</p>
<p>'Why all this heat?' wondered Filippo, already seeking to
retreat from those grounds of decency on which he had thought to
stand. It was true enough, as Agostino reminded him, that necessity
knows no laws; and the choice of decent weapons was a luxury no
longer within his means. So he swallowed his reluctance at a gulp.
'Why all this heat?'</p>
<p>'At your ingratitude.'</p>
<p>'You take us by surprise,' said Giacomo, coming to his brother's
aid. 'You rob us of breath. That is all. We are not ungrateful. We
are amazed, and if we are reluctant it is because we are
considering that you may leave your head in the business.'</p>
<p>'Ay,' growled Filippo. 'Have you thought of that?'</p>
<p>Mollified, Agostino laughed once more. 'Not whilst it has any
brains in it,' said he. His faith in himself was as massive as the
Mole of Hadrian.</p>
<h3>&mdash; iv &mdash;</h3>
<p>Agostino della Francesca, whose energy matched his guile, lost
no time in acting upon the plan conceived and at last agreed by his
kinsmen. Soon after dark that night, and before the moon had risen,
he put off alone in a boat from the castle, and slipped down the
river towards Colombino's barges. He did not wait to be discovered
by the guards, but himself proclaimed his approach.</p>
<p>When they hailed him, as he trusted that they would, into
Colombino's pavilion and the presence of that captain, he told a
harrowing tale of being in flight from the vindictive wrath of the
Scaligeri, who suspected him of sedition. He ended on an appeal to
the condottiero for sanctuary.</p>
<p>His person had been carefully arranged so as to lend colour to
his tale. His fine clothes were rent and disordered. He was without
weapons. A bloody bandage swathed his brow, and blood, from a
scalp-wound which it covered, smeared his handsome face.</p>
<p>Consistently, since he fled from vindictiveness, he displayed
vindictiveness in his turn. He was very free with information as to
the desperate conditions in Verona, and he displayed such an
eagerness in this betrayal that the truth of the rest of his story
was not to be doubted.</p>
<p>He aroused, however, little interest in Colombino, who heard him
indifferently, asked few questions, and carelessly dismissed him.
But since there was always a possibility that the fellow might be a
spy, Colombino would not have him about the camp.</p>
<p>'If you seek sanctuary, you may find it in Rovieto. Your quarrel
with Della Scala will make you perhaps welcome there.'</p>
<p>So far all was precisely as Messer Agostino had calculated. He
thanked the condottiero effusively, and took his leave. He went to
purchase a mule in the camp&mdash;he was well supplied with
gold&mdash;and cheerfully suffered himself to be conducted beyond
the lines.</p>
<p>In Rovieto it was Della Porta he sought in the first instance,
and was by Della Porta invited to come and repeat his tale of the
conditions in Verona that day to the Council. When he presented
himself in the council chamber, he came washed and combed and
dressed with more than ordinary care and all the richness of his
rank, a resplendent figure calculated to awaken interest in a lady
who had never been known to regard male beauty with restraint. The
bandage of fresh linen swathing his brow announcing a wound, taken
if not in her cause at least at the hands of a common enemy, was an
added commendation. Then his contemptuous words on the subject of
his cousin Filippo della Scala and his assurances that the tyrant
was as good as beaten already uplifted them all into giving him a
warm welcome to their midst.</p>
<p>To convince him of the readiness of her hospitality, Monna
Eufemia, languishing a little under his ardent eyes, gave orders
that quarters should be accorded him in the citadel, and invited
him to sup with her that night. Della Porta, knowing her ways and
considering in what relationship she now stood to Colombino, was
filled with a vague alarm which increased steadily and became less
vague as the days flowed on.</p>
<p>And they flowed into weeks without any confirmation of
Agostino's jubilant assurances that the end of Verona was already
in sight.</p>
<p>October was nearing its end, a month had sped since Agostino's
appearance in Rovieto, and still Della Scala held out. But he held
out at terrible cost. Gaunt famine stalked the city of Verona, and
men were dying in the streets. Such few victuals as still existed
within those grey walls were jealously husbanded for the garrison,
inadequate to nourish even these.</p>
<p>It is to be doubted if Della Scala would have held out so long
but for his obstinate hope that Pantaleone, who was still at large,
might yet succeed in bringing his victualling convoy into the city.
As for the hopes he had founded upon Agostino's unsavoury
stratagem, these had perished by now. The conviction had been borne
in upon the brothers that Agostino must have failed. Possibly
detected, or at least suspected, if he had not been slain he must
certainly lie by now a prisoner in Rovietan hands; otherwise he
would have found some way to make a sign. For single messengers
still contrived to slip through the besieging lines and bring word
of events in the countryside. It was one of these who came to
hearten Filippo della Scala with word that on the night of the
Feast of Saint Raphael, the twenty-second of October, after the
moon had set, Pantaleone would attempt to bring his convoy by
barges from the north, and he warned the Lord of Verona to open the
water gate at midnight, so as to admit him.</p>
<p>This was Della Scala's last hope. If he were revictualled, he
could hold out until the besiegers should be compelled to go into
winter quarters. And as the weather was now turning colder, this
could not, he thought, be very much longer delayed. Nor was he
without justification. It was a subject that was already troubling
Colombino. Of his auxiliaries, Falcone and his three hundred men
and Lanciotto da Narni who had brought a hundred had already
marched away on the ground that it was becoming too cold under
canvas for their troops. Other desertions threatened, and even
Sangiorgio was complaining of the difficulty of subduing the
murmurs of those who remained.</p>
<p>Aware of the point to which the garrison of Verona was reduced,
Colombino refused to contemplate the waste of all that had been
done by raising the siege at such a moment. Another week, if they
were steadfast, might see the end of the resistance; but another
week might also see the end of his company's patience.</p>
<p>It became necessary to enliven matters. If he could discover a
weakness anywhere, he would attempt an assault. He entrusted the
task of a close survey of the defences to Caliente, who as well as
being a superb cavalry leader was expert in all that concerned
fortifications.</p>
<p>Don Pablo made his inspection carefully, and came to report that
in his view a bastion on the western side of Verona was easily
vulnerable. Colombino went out with him to survey the spot, and
having assured himself that the Spaniard's report was just, he went
back to mature a plan of assault.</p>
<p>On that same night Pantaleone made his attempt to succour the
city His barges came gliding on the bosom of the stream, with
scarcely an oar dipped and never a gleam of light to break the
moonless gloom about them. Nevertheless they were detected. The
vessels with the food that was to renew Verona's fainting life were
rounded up, captured, and towed down to Colombino's camp below the
city.</p>
<p>The din of that brief battle fought afloat bore news of the
failure to Della Scala, and set the seal upon his despair. Gaunt
and haggard, the Lord of Verona faced his brother.</p>
<p>'It is the end. Nothing remains but to ask for terms.'</p>
<p>Giacomo was moved to the profanity of the impotent. He raged
against surrender.</p>
<p>'But for that swaggering coxcomb Agostino, I might have ended
matters a month ago by buying this son of a Judas. It's not yet too
late. Let me make the attempt even now I'd give all that I have
sooner than that we should become the mock of that Rovietan
harlot.'</p>
<p>'As God's my witness, so would I,' concurred the Lord Filippo.
'So be it, then, Giacomo. Try this before we throw down our
arms.'</p>
<p>And so it came to pass that at an early hour, before the late
sunrise of that chill morning of the last day of October, the
younger Della Scala went forth from a postern, and came, under a
flag of truce, into the bustling camp of the besiegers, to be at
once conducted to Colombino's pavilion.</p>
<p>They were rude folk, these Scaligeri, untouched as yet by that
spirit of art and letters that was already so vigorously permeating
the life of Italy or by the Sybaritism that was the natural
offspring of this love of beauty. Therefore Messer Giacomo opened
wide his dark eyes at the luxury he found here, the rich Eastern
hangings, the bearskins that covered the ground, and the tinted and
gilded leather of the abundant furniture. In his Spartan eyes there
was an effeminacy here that must have moved his scorn but for the
commanding presence of the man for whom it made a setting.</p>
<p>Colombino in a rust-red surcoat that descended to his knees and
was open like a tabard at the sides, revealing the lynx fur that
lined it against the cold, stood to receive his visitor.</p>
<p>'I give you welcome, Messer della Scala.' Stately and gracious
the young man bowed his red-gold head which was bare. 'If you will
sit, I will have my captains summoned.'</p>
<p>But Giacomo ignored the hand that courteously waved him to a
couch. He came a step nearer, loosening his cloak. He glanced over
his shoulder at the guards who had conducted him, and who waited,
like statues, under the brown canvas awning borne on poles that
made a porch for the pavilion. He lowered his voice.</p>
<p>'My errand were best delivered, sir, to you alone.'</p>
<p>Colombino stared. 'Your errand? But, then, is it not concerned
with terms?'</p>
<p>'With terms. Oh, yes. And yet it is important that we be
private.'</p>
<p>'As you please.' The condottiero shrugged, and waved away the
guards. 'Accommodate yourself. Be seated.'</p>
<p>Colombino himself went back to the chair from which he had
risen, set at a gilded table on which there were writing materials,
maps, and papers.</p>
<p>There, after a brief and more or less unintelligible prelude,
Messer Giacomo disclosed the purpose of his corruptive visit. No
sooner had Colombino perceived whither the Veronese was going than
he set hands to the aims of his chair, to heave himself up, so that
he might hurl from his tent this smug patrician who insulted him by
these assumptions of his venality. But even as his fingers closed
upon the lions' heads that decorated the chair's arms, he checked
the impulse, and let Messer Giacomo continue to the end.</p>
<p>With lowered eyes, and a mask of blankness upon his face,
Colombino heard him out. Then he looked up, and laughed.</p>
<p>'It may be, sir, that your brother takes the costliest way to
end this siege.'</p>
<p>Giacomo's heart leapt within him at the words. He glowed with
satisfaction in his own acumen which had so rightly judged the son
of Barberi of Terrarossa.</p>
<p>'Let my brother be the judge of that. Will you name the sum,
Messer Colombo?'</p>
<p>The condottiero, with a huckster's smile, shook his head slowly
'I would rather hear your brother first.'</p>
<p>'It is scarcely for the buyer to name the price,' said Giacomo,
in his secret contempt not even troubling to be tender of the
soldier's feelings. 'Still...Since you prefer it so...What should
you say to fifty thousand ducats?'</p>
<p>'Say to it? By the Host! I should say that you hold me cheap, my
lord.'</p>
<p>'That, be assured, is not the case. Name your own price,
sir.'</p>
<p>Colombino considered him with a glance of mockery. 'I'll tell
you this: less than two hundred thousand ducats would not even
tempt me.'</p>
<p>Giacomo's broad face lengthened at the mention of so vast a sum.
'By the Blood! An emperor's ransom!' But Verona's need was
desperate. 'If I were to offer that?' he asked breathlessly.</p>
<p>'I might accept, with certain conditions.'</p>
<p>'Conditions? You would saddle with conditions such a sum?'</p>
<p>'I must protect my patron, after all. You are not to suppose me
just a common scoundrel who sells his master. If your brother will
agree to a year's truce with Rovieto, I will consider.'</p>
<p>Giacomo's smile was not pleasant. 'I see. You must protect not
only your patron, but your face as well. Of course. A year is no
great matter. I am empowered to answer for my brother. He will
accept the condition.'</p>
<p>Colombino swallowed the insult of Giacomo's present manner as
calmly as he had swallowed the insult of his opening words. He
inclined his head a little.</p>
<p>'Very well,' he said quietly 'I will consult with my marshals.
Return for the answer in three days' time.'</p>
<p>That knocked the insolence out of the Veronese. The swift change
to dismay that overspread his countenance was ludicrous. To Verona
in her present extremity three days were an eternity. In three days
most of them would be dead of hunger. So much Giacomo could not
admit, or this scoundrel would, he was sure, increase the
price.</p>
<p>'What have your marshals to do with this?' he blurted out.</p>
<p>'Do you imagine such a thing can be done without their
participation? They'll want their share of the plunder. How else do
you suppose that they will acquiesce? And even then, however
plausibly I may put the matter to them, it is always possible that
I may not bring them to my views.' Abruptly he ended. 'Impossible
to pronounce until I have conferred with them.'</p>
<p>Giacomo had come to his feet. He stood now with clenched hands
and set jaw. 'Could you not determine by tomorrow?'</p>
<p>Colombino raised his brows. He smiled his understanding. 'In
such sore straits, are you?' Then his smile broadened with his
thought. 'Perhaps I can help you, there. I might, in earnest of my
friendly intent, permit the victualling barges we captured
yesterday to pass into the city at once.'</p>
<p>His eyes watching the other's face saw the sudden incredulous
relief that overspread it. Without giving him time to speak,
Colombino picked up a quill from the table.</p>
<p>'First, however, set me your offer down in writing: the price
you pay and what you pay it for. Here is a pen, and there the ink.
Set it down.'</p>
<p>Giacomo came slowly forward. 'Why this?'</p>
<p>Colombino was impatient. 'So that the barges may go, of course.
This will explain it to my captains: show them that you are already
conditionally bound.'</p>
<p>The Veronese took up the pen, and stooped to the table. He wrote
laboriously, uttering the words as he scrawled them:</p>
<p>'In the name of my brother, Filippo della Scala, Lord of Verona,
I offer the sum of two hundred thousand ducats for the raising of
the siege of Verona and the withdrawal of all hostile troops from
Veronese territory, and further I undertake in my brother's name
that he shall not bear arms against Rovieto for a year from this
date...'</p>
<p>There Giacomo paused, and straightened himself again under the
impulse of a sudden thought.</p>
<p>'There is one thing I might require where so much is being
paid.'</p>
<p>'Ah?'</p>
<p>'Does it happen that you have in your hands a kinsman of ours,
Agostino della Francesca?'</p>
<p>Colombino remembered the fugitive patrician who had come to him
bleeding and in rags more than a month ago for sanctuary against
his Scaligeri cousins. Wondering a little, he yet answered
frankly:</p>
<p>'Why, yes. He is at Rovieto, I believe. What of him?'</p>
<p>'I will add the condition that he be given a safe-conduct to
return to Verona. You will hardly deny us that.'</p>
<p>'A safe-conduct?' Colombino questioned, and not even the
surprise in his tone showed Messer Giacomo the blunder of asking
for a safe-conduct for a man who had represented himself to
Colombino as escaping from Scaligeri wrath. To have asked Colombino
to deliver up in bonds this fugitive would have been reasonable,
and could have excited no suspicion. But a safe-conduct was a thing
of no effect unless there were on the part of Messer Agostino a
willingness to avail himself of it. And this, if Messer Agostino
were what he had represented himself, there could not be. It seemed
to follow that the man's flight had been a pretence, his tale a
lie.</p>
<p>With the scent of treachery strong in his nostrils, Colombino
slyly asked: 'You insist upon that condition?'</p>
<p>'I beg for it.'</p>
<p>'Very well. Set it down.'</p>
<p>Whilst Giacomo wrote on, and finally signed the document,
Colombino was considering. When the Veronese flung down the pen,
its task accomplished, the condottiero drew a bow at a venture.</p>
<p>'After all, perhaps I owe no less to Ser Agostino. It was he who
named to me the sum I have now asked. But for his obstinacy in the
matter of the year's truce, this siege might have been ended a
month ago.'</p>
<p>He read the stupefaction in Giacomo's dark face. 'Agostino
discussed this with you?'</p>
<p>'Does it surprise you?'</p>
<p>Giacomo reflected, his lip between finger and thumb. Then he
shrugged, and betrayed all. 'Why, no. Not when I come to think of
it. It may well have seemed to him the easier course. But the fool
should have informed us of your insistence on the truce.'</p>
<p>For the moment this was more than enough for Colombino. What the
alternative purpose Agostino della Francesca had come to serve,
what purpose he might be endeavouring to serve even now in Rovieto,
Colombino could not guess and could not ask. Nor did it
signify.</p>
<p>He took up once more the pen that Giacomo had laid aside. 'It is
a whim of mine that you should add to the condition of a
safe-conduct for Messer Agostino della Francesca, the following
words: "who is the friend and kinsman of Filippo della Scala, and
was empowered by him to negotiate on his behalf for the raising of
the siege of Verona, or to take such other steps as might deliver
the Lord of Verona from his present difficulties."'</p>
<p>Giacomo frowned his bewilderment. 'Why that? What reason for
it?'</p>
<p>Colombino was easy and affable. 'So that it may go upon my
records. I like things done in orderly fashion.'</p>
<p>But this was Greek to Messer Giacomo. He could perceive no sense
in it, and he knew that deliberate nonsense is a common mask for
evil purposes. His tone became hard. 'I'll need a better
reason.'</p>
<p>This was check to Colombino. But he maintained his easy, affable
smile. Then he walked past Giacomo, to the entrance of the
pavilion. He drew aside the canvas curtains. 'Come here,' he said,
and when Giacomo stood beside him, he pointed to the string of
laden barges moored among the rotting sedges by the river's brim.
'As soon as you shall have signed and sealed the document in the
terms I've uttered, those barges shall start for the city, and your
starving men shall eat their fill.' He paused, and whilst Della
Scala still continued to scowl at him, still tormented by doubts,
Colombino mockingly put the question: 'Is that reason enough? Will
you write now?'</p>
<p>Rendered reckless by despair, Giacomo went back to the table and
bent again to the task.</p>
<p>'Seal it,' Colombino commanded. 'You wear a ring with the
Scaligeri arms. It is fortunate. So.' He took the document. 'For
the rest, come for my answer in three days' time. Your urgency will
now be less, since I send you the means to feed your people. Return
on Sunday.'</p>
<p>Giacomo had not left the camp before Colombino's orders had gone
forth for the release of Pantaleone and his men, to the end that
they might take their barges into Verona by the Water Gate. At the
same time he sent for Sangiorgio and Caliente. They came at speed,
making no attempt to dissemble their surprise at the orders he had
issued, indeed, demanding to know the meaning of them.</p>
<p>For answer Colombino told them that hostilities were suspended
until Sunday.</p>
<p>'An armistice?' said Sangiorgio, incredulously</p>
<p>'An armistice.' Colombino was grim.</p>
<p>Caliente exploded. 'Por Dios y la Virgen!' he swore. 'An
armistice at such a moment, with the city about to fall into our
hands, with the weakness discovered in the Madonna Bastion, and the
attack upon it settled?'</p>
<p>'It is an armistice to render the attack more certain. Lulled
into a sense of security, the Veronese will relax their vigilance.
Thus the assault to be delivered on Saturday night should carry the
place before they are even aware of it.'</p>
<p>Neither of the captains could believe his ears. It was
incredible that this leader, so fastidiously chivalrous in all his
measures, should seriously intend so dastardly a violation of an
engagement.</p>
<p>'But the treachery of it?' Sangiorgio reminded him, his tone
almost one of awe.</p>
<p>'These gentlemen of Verona shall find in me, so far as they are
concerned, the character with which their foul assumptions have had
the temerity to endow me. Read that.' He set Giacomo's document
before them, and waited until they had read.</p>
<p>'Filippo della Scala dares to send his brother here to me, to
propose a bribe. They suppose me so corrupt that they offer me gold
to betray my employer. In the hour of their defeat, they suppose me
so false to my undertakings that I am to be seduced into selling
them the victory' His countenance inflamed, he was giving now a
free rein to the passion he had curbed whilst Giacomo had been with
him. And so persuaded are they of my vileness that they approach me
almost without circumlocutions. "What is your price to sell the
Countess of Rovieto?" Those are almost Messer Giacomo's very words.
Flattering, is it not? The fellow never suspected how near he was
to a broken neck when he put that question. He escaped it only
because I had this sudden inspiration of how their vile assumptions
should be met. I would behave to them exactly as the faithless
traitor they suppose me should behave. Now, sirs, do you
understand? Do you still think that I am to consider knightliness
when I deal with huckstering seducers such as these?'</p>
<p>Don Pablo, who was seated on the fur-spread couch, smacked his
massive thigh with his plump hairy hand. 'You have reason, God help
me!'</p>
<p>But Sangiorgio, standing tall and gaunt with bowed head, his
fingers tugging at his dagger of a beard, was thoughtful.</p>
<p>'Even so, it will make an ugly tale. Men may see only your
treachery, and never learn of the treachery it was employed to
meet. The Scaligeri will not proclaim it, and we may not be
believed.'</p>
<p>'But I hold the proof. Why else, do you suppose, did I have
Messer Giacomo set it down in writing?'</p>
<p>'Writing can be denied. Colombino, my friend, this will not
serve. You are in the trade of arms. Loyalty is as much a
commander's stock-in-trade as skill.' He became emphatic. 'You have
a name for chivalry which you cannot ruin just to be even with
these dogs.'</p>
<p>'Chivalry! I'll be chivalrous with foes who are chivalrous
themselves. But with tricksters I'll be a trickster. To be aught
else is to be a fool.'</p>
<p>'It is no shame to be a fool in the service of honour,' said
Sangiorgio.</p>
<p>'Wait,' said Colombino. 'There is something in that paper you
have both missed. The allusion to Messer Agostino della Francesca.
There, too, we have treachery, and of a sort that is yet to be
discovered.' He made clear his inferences from that request for a
safe-conduct. 'I am starting now for Rovieto to discover it. The
armistice gives me leisure to do so.'</p>
<p>And then he showed that Sangiorgio's opposition had shaken him a
little. No decision about Saturday night's assault on the Madonna
Bastion need be taken until he should return. Meanwhile, however,
let Caliente carry forward his preparations for it.</p>
<h3>&mdash; v &mdash;</h3>
<p>Colombino set out that afternoon, escorted by only ten lances,
travelling lightly that he might travel the more swiftly. The
little company rested awhile towards sunset, then rode all night,
although after midnight it turned bitterly cold, and before
daybreak as they came into the Rovietan uplands it was snowing
heavily.</p>
<p>There was something urging him besides the matter of dealing
with Ser Agostino. It was not so much alarm of what that agent of
the Scaligeri might attempt against Madonna Eufemia, for she would
be well guarded, and Della Porta would see that no harm came near
his mistress. It was a hunger of his eyes to behold again in the
flesh that gentle loveliness of which in all this month he had
carried the vision ever before him. He had been starved the more,
because whilst in the last fortnight he had sent impassioned letter
after impassioned letter to Madonna Eufemia, each a lyrical
pulsation of a devotion that grew deeper, it seemed to him, with
every hour, yet he had in all that time received but one brief cold
and formal letter from her in return. It was not in his heart to
blame her. It is not for the saint in Paradise to be making
passionate answers to her votaries. Nor was he a coxcomb to suppose
that he could yet have moved in her the deep tenderness by which he
was exalted. This was something that would follow when by loving
service he should have proved his worth, as, God helping him, he
would. But he had the hope to do something meanwhile towards
lessening her aloofness, and in this hope he rode, warmed by it
against the chill of that grey morning.</p>
<p>It was the first of November, the Feast of All Saints, and High
Mass was being sung in the Cathedral as Colombino and his lances
rode across the square, their hoof-beats softened by the snow, and
up the steep, narrow street that led to the citadel.</p>
<p>Dismounting in the courtyard, he learnt from an officer whom he
questioned that Messer Agostino della Francesca was, indeed, still
in Rovieto, and at that moment at Mass with her highness.</p>
<p>'At his prayers, eh?' Colombino's lips made a straight grim
line. 'That is very well. Send a messenger to tell him that he is
required at once by Messer della Porta; that the matter is
urgent.'</p>
<p>Then, having ascertained that Della Porta was above, in his
apartments, Colombino went up the stone staircase in quest of
him.</p>
<p>He found him in that long bleak room where first the captain had
beheld the Countess, and the announcement of Colombino's presence
disturbed the old councillor in labours that were engaging him with
his secretary. To judge by his appearance when presently the
secretary had been dismissed and the condottiero was admitted, he
was in prey to a disturbance deeper than could have resulted from
the interruption of his work. He stood in his long, fur-trimmed
surcoat, leaning against the table from which he had risen, a gaunt
figure of consternation.</p>
<p>'Why are you here, sir?' was his odd greeting, quaveringly
delivered. 'Why...Why have you left your post under Verona?'</p>
<p>'Verona will not dissolve between this and my return. My
marshals have their orders. The assault that will certainly carry
the place is to be delivered on Saturday. Meanwhile, I make
holiday; and something else.'</p>
<p>He strode past the aged councillor, towards the fire, loosening
his cloak as he went. Beneath it he was all leather, with steel at
his heels and waist and throat, and he creaked and jingled
martially as he moved.</p>
<p>The councillor's scared eyes followed him. 'What...What else?'
he asked.</p>
<p>'You shall learn in a moment.' Colombino answered him over his
shoulder. His first concern seemed to be to warm himself. The logs
hissed and spluttered under his wet heel, and for a moment the
soldier spread himself to the almost instantly ensuing blaze. Then,
turning again to the anxiously waiting councillor, he asked on a
softened note for news of the Countess.</p>
<p>Della Porta answered vaguely, a man whose thoughts were
obviously wandering. He shambled up and down the long grey room,
his hands clasped behind him, and his bald head craned forward on
his long, stringy neck. In his grey furred gown he had, thought
Colombino, the air of a gigantic and uneasy vulture. Presently his
aimless pacings took him to the window He stood there, his knuckly
hand upon the stone sill, and peered out.</p>
<p>'What are they doing down there, those men?'</p>
<p>'They will be men of mine. They fulfil my orders.'</p>
<p>'Your orders?' Della Porta turned. His face was grey, and he was
shaking. For what he had just seen below was a headsman's block
being set up on the snow in the middle of the courtyard. 'Your
orders?' he repeated.</p>
<p>Colombino was spared the trouble of explaining himself by the
opening of the door. The officer who had carried Colombino's
message came in quickly, followed by scuffling, clanking sounds
from the stairs behind him.</p>
<p>'Sir Captain!' he cried out as he entered. 'Your men are doing
violence to Messer Agostino.'</p>
<p>'To be sure,' was all that Colombino indifferently answered him,
without moving from the hearth.</p>
<p>Della Porta sat down heavily at the long table in the room's
middle, and a groan escaped him, to increase the mystery which
Colombino sensed here rather than perceived. He was frowning down
upon the councillor when Agostino della Francesca, a magnificent
glittering figure, in white and gold, came writhing and struggling
in the grip of two men-at-arms.</p>
<p>At sight of the martial figure, standing straight and tall and
stern against a flaming background, Ser Agostino fell suddenly
still. But that was only for a moment. In the next he had broken
into violent imprecations and more violent threats. Messer Colombo
da Siena he announced with many unnecessary and furious words would
be required to answer to the Countess of Rovieto for this
violence.</p>
<p>'Oh, yes. No doubt. But that need not concern or excite you, for
you'll not be here to witness it.'</p>
<p>'What's that?' From pale that they had been the cheeks of the
Veronese went now grey-green.</p>
<p>'Have you a soul to make, Ser Agostino? If so, you have ten
minutes in which to make it. Your treacherous sands are run.'</p>
<p>With dilating eyes Messer Agostino stared at him for a long
moment. Then, rousing himself, he swung to the old man who was
rocking in distress.</p>
<p>'Della Porta!' he cried. It was an appeal for help.</p>
<p>Della Porta groaned again. He flung out trembling hands towards
Colombino. 'Sir! Sir! What is your intent?'</p>
<p>Colombino paid no heed to him. His eyes, at once stern and sad,
were fixed upon Agostino. He spoke very quietly. Inwardly this
killing in cold blood revolted him. But his duty and the nature of
Agostino's offence imposed upon him the necessity.</p>
<p>'We need waste no words, Messer della Francesca. You know what
you came here to do, and if I do not yet perceive your ultimate
design, that is no matter. I have it on your cousin Giacomo della
Scala's word that you are here to take such steps as may deliver
Filippo della Scala from his present difficulties. That is enough.
What wages you were to have earned I do not know. But the price you
are called upon to pay is neither more nor less than the price
demanded of every man who is caught in treachery as you are
caught.' Abruptly he added, with a wave of the hand, 'Take him
away. Let justice be done.'</p>
<p>They dragged him writhing, screaming, and protesting from the
chamber. As the door closed, Colombino shuddered, whilst Della
Porta started up in panic, knocking over his chair.</p>
<p>'Sir! I beg that you will wait at least. At least. The Countess
should be summoned, sir. If...if...what you have said is
true...'</p>
<p>'True? My God, what do you suppose me? I hold the proof. Should
I act summarily otherwise?'</p>
<p>'But...But...' Della Porta shuffled forward, quaking, blinking,
stammering. 'Her highness should be summoned, none the less. It may
go very ill with us all...'</p>
<p>Colombino shrugged and interrupted him. 'It is not worthwhile to
disturb her highness at her devotions. This is no great
matter.'</p>
<p>'No great matter? Oh, my God!'</p>
<p>How great a matter it was the old man dared not tell him. He
turned away in despair to find himself another chair into which he
might collapse. And thus with no further word between them they
awaited the coming of Madonna Eufemia, Della Porta in terror,
Colombino with his lover's impatience a little overcast by the
shadow of the justice he had done.</p>
<p>She came at last.</p>
<p>Alighting in the courtyard from the litter in which she was
borne, she checked there in horror and amazement.</p>
<p>A block, smeared with fresh blood, stood in the snow in the
middle of the little square. At the foot of it lay a mass over
which a crimson cloak had been thrown. Beside it a lance was
planted in the ground, and on this lance was impaled a head, from
the waxen face of which a pair of glazed eyes stared foolishly.</p>
<p>With fixed gaze Madonna Eufemia advanced a pace or two. Then she
smothered a scream, and staggered as if about to fall. But
mastering the faintness that assailed her, she asked a question,
hoarsely, of a man-at-arms.</p>
<p>Who has done this?'</p>
<p>His answer, brief but complete, sent her speeding to the
stairs.</p>
<p>Colombino above heard her quick approaching steps, and as the
door opened he was leaping eagerly to meet her, when her aspect
checked him. So disordered was her countenance that he scarcely
recognized it for her own. Its gentle, innocent loveliness, its
very youth was blotted out by rage.</p>
<p>'You dog! You beast! You murderer!' Thus foaming at the lips she
greeted him. 'As God's my witness, your head shall go the way of
his.'</p>
<p>The colour receded from his face until his very lips were
bloodless. He seemed to crumple a little, to lose some of his
splendid height and dignity of poise. Thus for a long moment they
stood regarding each other, and each was breathing labouredly.</p>
<p>For spectators they had Della Porta, too palsied to rise from
his chair, and behind her a little group of men and women, two of
the councillors, two or three of her lackeys and as many of her
men-at-arms, and behind these again a half-dozen of Colombino's men
brought up at speed by their sergeant who had scented trouble from
the manner of Madonna Eufemia's departure from the courtyard.</p>
<p>At last it was Colombino who broke that heavy, anxious
silence.</p>
<p>'So!' he said. 'So! I seem to have found here more than I was
seeking.' There was such reproach and agony in his voice as only
heartbreak lends. 'What was he to you, this man?'</p>
<p>She recoiled a step or two, and crouched like an animal about to
spring, her litheness stressed by her close-fitting gown of black
velvet with a fiery glow of cabochon rubies at her girdle.</p>
<p>In her rage, in her vindictive desire to wound, to punish, to
lacerate his soul before she had the head hacked from his body, she
cast all dissimulation to the winds. Sobbing and snarling through
her shuddering lips she answered him.</p>
<p>'It is fitting you should learn it before you die. Agostino
della Francesca was my love, and would have been my husband. He was
my peer, a natural mate for me, not the son of a degraded traitor,
a braggart upstart, who traded on my need to make of my own self
the price of his hireling service.'</p>
<p>'Ah!' he said slowly 'That is your justification, is it?'</p>
<p>'I need none, sir. I but tell you this, so that you may know
what mercy to expect.'</p>
<p>But Colombino's bloodless lips were curling in a terrible
smile.</p>
<p>'Yes. He was your peer, as you say. Your peer in all things. And
that is why I took off his head, although at the time I knew only
the half of his offence.'</p>
<p>'As I shall take off yours!' she shrilled. 'Or,' she mocked him
wildly, 'do you look for mercy?'</p>
<p>Anger restored his strength. He straightened himself again, and
threw back his head. His voice boomed now through the vaulted
chamber.</p>
<p>'Mercy? Mercy, do you say? Mercy is for such treacherous things
as you and he.'</p>
<p>'You dog! Have you not yet vented enough of your jealous
spite?'</p>
<p>Jealous...?' He checked on the amazed word. Then he laughed
dreadfully and without mirth. 'So that is what you supposed. Why,
yes. It would be. But I did not even dream I had a rival in that
poor Judas, who like yourself&mdash;your peer, as you have
said&mdash;could keep faith with none.' He pulled Giacomo's
parchment from the breast of his tunic, and stepped close up to
her. 'Look, woman. Read. Learn why I took off his head, as you must
have taken it off once you saw this. Because to serve his kinsman
of Verona he came here to betray you.'</p>
<p>To guide her staring eyes, his finger traced the accusing lines
above the Scaligeri signature and seal.</p>
<p>She shuddered as she read. When it was done, she put a hand to
her brows in a gesture of helplessness and pain, and the lithe,
delicate little figure swayed like a lily-stem in a breeze. One of
her women ran to her, and supported her to a chair. She sank into
it, and sat there stricken, her white hands interlocked and wedged
between her knees.</p>
<p>Colombino turned aside, and went to hand the parchment to Della
Porta.</p>
<p>'There is the evidence that will justify the judgment I have
executed.' He paused there, and then added: 'Since the price I was
to have received for my service has meanwhile been treacherously
squandered, it follows that my engagement to Rovieto is at an end.
I take my dismissal.'</p>
<p>'Sir! Sir!' cried Della Porta, starting up.</p>
<p>Colombino, standing stiffly, looked at him, and the old
councillor fell back from the glance as from a blow.</p>
<p>Then erect and leisurely he walked out of the room beckoning his
men to follow him and without so much as a glance at the lovely,
golden-haired little Countess, who, whimpering now, was huddled in
the chair to which she had been helped.</p>
<p>Mechanically, insensible to the fatigue upon him from his
night-ride, he gave the order to saddle, and with an escort as
weary as himself, but without the burden that he carried in his
heart, he set out once more for his camp under Verona.</p>
<p>He reached it on the following evening, having rested the night
at an inn upon the way, and in his countenance the shrewd-eyed
Sangiorgio read that this stony-faced man who returned was no
longer the Colombino who had ridden forth. He was a man who,
meeting betrayal where he had placed his greatest faith, conceived
himself deluded by all the ideals he had cherished, a man who found
himself under the necessity of readjusting his views and
discovering for his life a more practical but less noble
orientation.</p>
<p>Listlessly he sent a messenger to summon the Scaligeri for his
answer. To Messer Giacomo, when he came, he delivered himself with
the same listlessness.</p>
<p>'I am prepared,' he announced, 'to raise the siege on the
payment of the two hundred thousand ducats. The condition
concerning your kinsman Della Francesca I am no longer able to
fulfil, because Messer della Francesca has lost his head. As a
set-off, however, I waive the condition exacted from you of a
year's truce with Rovieto. Once I have raised this siege your hands
are free.'</p>
<p>Messer Giacomo would have protracted the interview. But
Colombino curtly dismissed him.</p>
<p>'That is all, sir. I have no more to say You have three days in
which to find the money. When it is paid, we depart into winter
quarters.'</p>
<p>And so Messer Giacomo went back to tell his brother: 'I knew
that Barberi's son would succumb to the lure of gold. If that poor
fool Agostino had heeded me, he would be with us now.'</p>
<p>In Colombino's tent Sangiorgio shook his head over the business
and gloomily told him that men would say exactly what Giacomo was
at that moment saying. He spoke of honour.</p>
<p>Colombino sneered. 'Honour! Will honour pay my troops? It is
necessary in this world to be practical before being honourable,
and I must have money for my men. Besides, it is no longer my
concern to force a capitulation. I have left the service of
Rovieto.'</p>
<p>And because unable to bear the sorrow and reproach in his
captain's eyes, Colombino blurted out the whole shameful story. He
found relief. Some of the poison went out of him on that relation
of the events.</p>
<p>'I have done nothing that I am not justified in doing. The Lady
of Rovieto made an end of the engagement when she dishonoured the
terms of it. There is nothing in my actions that hurts my
honour.'</p>
<p>There was a wistful smile on the old soldier's deeply lined
face. He sighed as if in relief.</p>
<p>'So that honour still counts with you, child.' He came to stand
over the young condottiero, and set a hand upon his shoulder. Nor
have you real reason to repine. Presently, when this wound heals,
you'll give thanks. A dangerous woman, as I warned you. There is
death in her kiss. Agostino della Francesca is the third who has
found it there. Praise God that you could kiss her and still
live.'</p>

<h2><a name="ch-02" id="ch-02"></a>Chapter 2. THE LADY
LACKLAND</h2>
<h3>&mdash; i &mdash;</h3>
<p>As long as life pulsates in him man moves as if persuaded that
it will never cease to do so. For which reason age seldom sets a
term to schemes and plans and measures that concern the future.</p>
<p>At sixty-nine that shrewd little man Onorato da Polenta might
more properly have been employed in making his soul than in
addressing himself to the reconquest of the dominion of Ravenna,
from which Venice had twenty years ago expunged him. After all,
there was no man of his house to succeed him. His only son Azzo had
been put to death by Venetian justice for violating the decree of
banishment under which he lay jointly with his father. His only
nephew Cosimo da Polenta was in holy orders. There remained his
daughter Samaritana, but since in the circumstances the legacy of
Ravenna would be a legacy of strife, it would be a folly to suppose
that it was on her account that the Lord Onorato determined to come
out of his exile in Crete and put his case to the arbitrament of
arms.</p>
<p>For twenty years he had watched and waited for the opportunity
he now perceived. He had been prophetically confident that in the
end Venice must pay dearly for the greed of which his own
dispossession had been an instance, and at last it seemed to him
that his prophecy was fulfilled. Not content with being mistress of
the sea and of vast colonies beyond it, the Most Serene Republic
had raised great armies so as to extend over a vast sub-Alpine
territory her dominion on the mainland. She had reduced into
vassalage the states of Treviso, Vicenza, Padua, Brescia, Bergamo,
and a half-dozen lesser tyrannies, including that of Ravenna. The
great wealth amassed in trade and by the arts of peace had been
squandered in war for the gratification of imperial aims; and
whilst superficially Venice now appeared stronger than ever before
in her history, in reality she had been bled white by the great
mercenary companies under Carmagnola, Colleoni, and other captains
hired to fight her battles. Although the long war dictated by the
forward policy of Doge Foscari against the Duke of Milan had
brought her all that she coveted, yet it had left her without the
necessary strength to hold her conquests.</p>
<p>In the words of Onorato da Polenta the present Venetian State
was a wall built without mortar; let one stone be removed, and the
entire structure would crumble. It was to preach this gospel that,
greatly daring, he came out of his Cretan exile, and with his
daughter Samaritana crossed to Italy in his sixty-ninth year.</p>
<p>He found it easy by his fiery arguments to persuade his fellow
sufferers in the North of the correctness of his views. Men are
ready enough to credit what they hope. But it was not so easy to
persuade any of them to set about pulling his own stone from the
mortarless wall of Onorato's picturesque image. Everywhere the
answer was the same.</p>
<p>'Dear Onorato, what you say leaps to the eye. Do you, then, make
the first attempt. Wrest your own Ravenna from the talons of the
winged lion, and we will complete the prostration of the beast by
following your example, blessing your name.'</p>
<p>It was in vain that Onorato protested that he did not command
the means for such an undertaking, and that what he was proposing
was a league that should band them all together against the common
foe; in vain that be talked eloquently of the strength that lies in
union.</p>
<p>Disgusted with them, he went off at last to Milan and Francesco
Sforza. But Francesco shook his crafty red-gold head. Venice was
not the only one to be exhausted by the long-drawn war. What but
exhaustion, did Onorato suppose, had reconciled him to leaving
Bergamo and Brescia in Venetian hands?</p>
<p>Still the Lord Onorato would not be denied, and by his
persistence he wrung at last a conditional promise from the Duke of
Milan.</p>
<p>'I could perhaps muster strength to support&mdash;that is, to
follow up&mdash;a well-delivered blow But I am certainly in no case
to initiate a fresh campaign.'</p>
<p>A temperament still sanguine even at sixty-nine led Onorato to
construe this into an undertaking. And meanwhile in Milan he had
heard much talk of Colombo da Siena, and in particular that from
his abundant confidence in himself he had been known to consent to
serve for payment upon results and out of resources to be supplied
by the conquest in view. If Onorato could persuade him to enter his
service on such terms, he would avert the failure with which he was
threatened by the lukewarmness of those upon whose enthusiasm he
had counted.</p>
<p>So the Lord Onorato set off again on his travels with his
daughter, and came to Siena on a day of early April, when the land
was turning green.</p>
<p>He sought there the good offices of that cultured young
patrician Camillo Petrucci, whose house was coming to be regarded
as foremost among those&mdash;the Salimbeni, the Piccolomini, the
Malavolti, and the Spallanti&mdash;who disputed for prepotency in
the Sienese Republic. Camillo's generous heart was moved to
sympathy with these wanderers, this Lord Lackland and his daughter,
as he called them, half in jest, half in compassion. He gave them
noble entertainment, hope, and encouragement; highly commended the
Lord Onorato's wisdom in seeking the services of Messer Colombo, in
admiration of whom the young Sienese was almost lyrical; and
himself undertook to conduct him to Montasco and lend his support
to the Lord Onorato's proposals.</p>
<p>Father and daughter in mule litters, Petrucci riding, with a
half-dozen men of his own for escort, they travelled some fourteen
miles down the narrow valley of the Arbia, through Monteroni,
turning westward just short of Buonconvento, and then breasted the
gentle slope upon which Colombino was spreading his vineyards,
dominated by the stately, four-square red house, half-villa,
half-fortress, the building of which he had only just completed
since his return four or five months ago from his ill-starred
Rovietan adventure.</p>
<p>In this business of building, embellishing, and equipping his
stately home, the condottiero had sought to smother the ache which
the treachery of Eufemia de Santi had left in his young heart. For
this treachery she had paid bitterly by now. At the first touch of
spring, a month ago, the Scaligeri with their Swiss levies had
marched into Rovieto and annexed it to Verona with scarcely a blow
struck. For the Countess, perceiving the utter hopelessness of
resistance in her defenceless condition, had fled at the enemy's
approach, and was now a landless wanderer somewhere in Italy.</p>
<p>Colombino, however, was not of those who can find vindictive
solace. It comforted him not at all that the Countess should have
fared so ill. A measure of gloom remained in him, despite the
resilience of youth and of a spirit naturally joyous. A measure of
hardness was also now discernible which had certainly not been his
before, but for which Sangiorgio opined that presently he would be
the better in the career that he had chosen.</p>
<p>Out of his fatherly concern for his young captain, Sangiorgio
had lately been praying that work might come to engage them before
long, so that absorbing himself in it Colombino might completely
escape the thoughts that so often set that upright line of pain
between his level brows.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, now that the house was finished, Colombino was
finding no little measure of distraction in the planning and
setting of his vineyards. He was breaking the hillside into
terraces, for the better sunning of the choice vines he had brought
from Orvieto, from Naples, and from Sicily, and here as the Lord
Onorato was borne up the gentle, winding ascent, he found the
activity of an ant-heap, an army of labourers swarming with spade
and mattock over the slopes between the terraces that made of the
hill a Titanic staircase.</p>
<p>To Onorato da Polenta, whose life had been spent in court and
camp, it seemed an odd thing that a captain of fortune should
engage his mind upon such peasant concerns as these. But as he
advanced, he found the concerns to be more than merely those of
husbandry, and he was impressed by the boldness of the conception
which he found in execution: the vast deep terraces, each edged by
a colonnade of square rough-hewn granite pillars, roofed by beams
over which orange and lemon trees were being trained to form long
shaded galleries. Even more was he impressed by the provision he
beheld for irrigation. Into each of the terraces, somewhere about
the middle of its length, a great estang of granite had been
partially sunk, to receive and store the waters of a mountain
torrent, thus harnessed to his needs by Colombino's engineers, and
conveyed by stone channels in sparkling cascades from the estang of
each terrace to that of the terrace next below, until, from the
widest and deepest of them all, a miniature lake at the foot of the
hill, the overflow, controlled by sluices, escaped into the river
Ombrone. Nor was the work merely utilitarian. About some of these
vast square basins there were colonnades, bearing trellis-work to
shade the water and its neighbourhood in which tables and seats of
stone had been set. Others were hemmed about and partially enclosed
by dense hedges of yew, in which niches had been carved where
marble figures gleamed white against the dusky green.</p>
<p>The house itself stood some little way below the summit of the
hill, screened thus from the north. Its facade was pierced by
Gothic windows of delicate tracery, with slender mullions carved in
close spirals. Each corner was flanked by a square tower and the
whole was crowned by battlements that were roofed and tiled. A
miniature moat, for ornament rather than defence, made an island of
it.</p>
<p>With jingle of mule bells and hollow beat of hooves upon the
timbers of the drawbridge, the two litters were borne under the
tall arch of the gatehouse, followed by Petrucci and his little
troop. They entered an unpaved courtyard, now half in shadow, where
grooms at once came forward, whilst a young chamberlain in black
with a gold chain on his breast issued presently onto the broad
steps to receive the visitors.</p>
<p>They were ushered into a wide hall that was paved in black and
white marble chequers, the ceiling in blue and gold mosaics
displayed in its middle a silver dove, the walls were hung in
tapestries of rusty red and blue, with glittering trophies of arms
displayed at intervals.</p>
<p>Here an officer in gorget and cap of polished steel, armed with
a short blue tasselled partisan, was on guard, and it was into his
care that the chamberlain delivered the little Lord Onorato, his
tall, handsome daughter and the splendid Petrucci, whilst he
himself went forward to announce them.</p>
<p>If the strangers had been impressed by the nobility of the
setting in which they discovered this soldier of fortune and the
evidences of the princely state he kept, they were impressed more
deeply still by his commanding presence and the urbanity of the
reception he accorded them, following upon their presentation by
Petrucci.</p>
<p>The young Sienese he embraced with a warmth which proclaimed the
depth of the friendship that bound them. Then having set them at
their ease, he mantled himself in a coolness which, whilst nowise
impairing his perfect courtesy, yet seemed to increase his dignity.
This coolness he retained whilst listening to Petrucci's statement
of the mission which had brought the dispossessed Lord of Ravenna
out of his banishment and to the Lord Ravenna's own more elaborate
exposition of his hopes. And this notwithstanding that the presence
of the Lady Samaritana was calculated to inspire warmth in a man of
any sensibility.</p>
<p>A tall, slender girl, not yet twenty, of dark tresses and a warm
pallor of countenance, she possessed something of the elusive
beauty, the stateliness and the grace of that other famous woman of
her house, the ill-fated Francesca da Polenta, who some two
centuries before had gone to be the Lady of Rimini, and there had
died, of one death, as Dante has it, with Paolo Malatesta.</p>
<p>A year ago it might have been impossible for Colombino to have
regarded her with the cold, almost hostile indifference which now
invested his eyes when they transiently rested upon her. It would
have been impossible for him to have viewed the wistfulness by
which her gentle face seemed clouded without stirrings of that
chivalry to which on the threshold of his career he had vowed
himself, or to have listened to her father's tale without an
immediate desire to arm in his service, for this sweet lady's sake.
But sore and sick at heart still from the treachery of which he had
so lately been the victim, his vision was so warped that in womanly
grace and beauty he beheld only hollow lures of evil.</p>
<p>The Lady Samaritana, sitting erect, with folded hands, demure
and still as an image in an altar niche, with her downcast eyes and
wistful mouth, he set down for a proud, cold, calculating piece,
and so dismissed her from his thoughts, giving his cool attention
first to Petrucci and then to the Lord Onorato.</p>
<p>When their tale was told, Colombino sat back, chin in hand, and
slowly asked a question.</p>
<p>'To seize Ravenna would not be difficult, even if Venice should
put an army into the field. But when it has been seized, how do you
propose to hold it against Venetian resources?'</p>
<p>To Camillo Petrucci it seemed that Colombino was delivering
checkmate. But not so to the lean, grizzled little Lord of Ravenna.
His dark, kindly eyes under their tufted brows glowed with a mild
excitement of debate, his wide, humourous mouth was smiling as he
delivered with vehemence his answer.</p>
<p>First he had Francesco Sforza's promise to support the
undertaking. Second, the example of Ravenna must be followed by the
other vassal states which Venice had seized, and the Venetian
Empire on the mainland must inevitably crumble beyond repair.</p>
<p>Colombino was not impressed.</p>
<p>'These are but possible contingencies. They are not certain.
Duke Francesco, for instance, does not move without prospect of
profit. What shall he stand to gain?'</p>
<p>'The weakening of Venice!' cried Onorato. 'Is not that gain
enough for a prince who aims at undisputed prepotency in the
North?' And then, since the subject of gain had been introduced, he
used the prospect of a rich reward as a means of stirring the
Captain from the discouraging apathy he discovered in him. He
talked of ducats, recklessly. A hundred thousand was the sum he
offered, to be levied upon the city of Ravenna so soon as it should
be in his hands.</p>
<p>But the offer, fantastic for an undertaking that might be
accomplished in a month, did not dazzle the condottiero.</p>
<p>'It needs thought. For you, sir, it is none too wise to begin
your restored rule by such a levy. For me, there is the risk that
Venice may be in sufficient strength to frustrate me. It is not a
heavy risk, or one that ordinarily would daunt me. But it exists.'
He rose, as if to mark the conclusion of the matter. 'I will
consider, my Lord. Give me until tomorrow to resolve. Meanwhile, I
am sensible of the honour your proposal does me. You will stay to
dine.'</p>
<p>When, after dinner, the Lord Onorato, a little crestfallen but
still hopeful, took his leave and departed with his daughter,
Petrucci remained behind, and soon showed that his intent in doing
so was to plead the cause of the Lord of Ravenna.</p>
<p>'My dear Camillo,' he was answered, 'that cause is all but
hopeless, but for the liking Onorato da Polenta aroused in me, I
would not even have consented to give the matter further
thought.'</p>
<p>'Though you say Onorato, I've a notion you might mean
Samaritana.'</p>
<p>'His daughter?' Colombino looked at him, almost sullen-eyed, and
shrugged. 'I scarcely saw the girl.'</p>
<p>'Yet she's a girl to fill a man's eyes.'</p>
<p>'Some other man's, perhaps. And anyway, my mind was busy with
the problem of the Lord Onorato's case: the problem of how he is to
hold Ravenna when it is taken. Until there's a solution to that,
this campaign is a mere waste.'</p>
<p>'In your place,' said Petrucci slowly, with the suspicion of a
smile, 'I could find, I think, a solution that would profit me.'
And he went on to answer the question of Colombino's glance. The
House of Polenta is at the point of extinction. Onorato's only son
is dead; his only nephew is in holy orders. The Lady Samaritana
succeeds to his dominions.'</p>
<p>'Which at present do not exist.'</p>
<p>'That is your opportunity. Convert this Lady Lackland into the
Lady of Ravenna, then let them see that, if she is to maintain her
hold upon that lordship, she'll need a soldier at her side to share
it with her. It's a pity you did not look at her more closely. As
I've said, she's a woman worth looking at, especially by a young
ambitious captain who is invited to restore her house.'</p>
<p>Colombino's face had darkened. 'I want no woman for a ladder by
which to climb.'</p>
<p>'Scruples are very well, but here...' Petrucci was saying, when
he was interrupted.</p>
<p>'It is not only a matter of scruples, but of experience.'
Colombino opened his heart. 'Once, not long ago, I dreamt just such
an unworthy dream. Nor was ambition then the only, or even the real
spur. I was no mere fortune-hunter taking advantage of a woman's
needs. I was a lover first, desiring only to serve. But since I
sought also to profit, I found in betrayal perhaps no more than I
deserved. I have learnt my lesson, Camillo. I've no mind it shall
be read to me again by your Lady Lackland.'</p>
<p>But Petrucci shook his head. 'The lesson you should have learnt
is that a man may not serve at once two masters: love and ambition;
tyrants both. Here, since your heart is not engaged, you will be on
sounder ground. Think of it, Colombino. Here is offered you such a
crown to your career as rarely comes to a captain until he has
grown old, and not often then: sovereignty and the founding of a
dynasty. Shall I say a word to Onorato da Polenta that will set the
door ajar for you?'</p>
<p>'I beg that you will not.' The soldier was emphatic, almost
indignant, and Camillo, with a sigh, let the matter drop.</p>
<p>But he had sown in Colombino's mind a seed which presently began
to put forth roots, and this with such tenacity that they would not
be torn up. There ensued for him a season of conflict. When
ambition urged him to take the road that Petrucci had shown him,
his chivalrous ideals revolted against the cynicism of a loveless
marriage for worldly ends. Then, remembering what through love he
had suffered and how his simple faith had been abused, he mocked
himself for still permitting chivalry to fetter him. Here, as
Petrucci had pointed out, was a chance of greatness such as might
never come again. Let him take it, marching alert and wary to his
ends, without any fond emotion to obscure his sight.</p>
<p>Thus for two days his thoughts continued tossed about without
coming anywhere to rest, and when at last he rode into Siena, to
seek the Lackland Onorato in Petrucci's palace on the Campo, it was
to announce a decision which still left the deeper purpose
undecided.</p>
<p>'Look you, my Lord, that I can bring you to Ravenna I do not
doubt. The rest can wait. The means by which you are to maintain
yourself in your dominion can be determined when once more you are
in possession of it.'</p>
<p>Petrucci who was present looked at his friend, and wondered.
When he observed the searching glance which the young condottiero
bent upon the Lady Samaritana, who was also present, he suspected
that Colombino might have been moved to the wisdom of at least
considering what he had proposed. The rest, thought Petrucci,
Samaritana, at once so stately and so demure, should herself
accomplish. She was dressed that day in silk and velvet of the
brown of leaves in autumn, voluminous of skirt, but fitting so
closely from neck to waist as to reveal the lovely lines of her
maiden breast. Heavy outer sleeves of velvet hung like a mantle
from her shoulders down to the level of her knees, whilst inner
tight-fitting sleeves of silk encased her arms and half-concealed
her long, slim hands. A broad, flat velvet cap partly covered her
intensely black and lustrous hair, and a narrow frontlet of black
velvet crossed her brow to stress its white purity.</p>
<p>Furtively considering her, Petrucci told himself that Colombino
was a fool if he refused this gift of Fortune which with a little
trouble and address he might make his own.</p>
<p>The Lord Onorato was a man exalted. His humorous mouth twitched
in excitement as he asked questions and received answers concerned
with the means that Colombino would adopt, and Samaritana's eyes
lost some of their wistfulness, a little colour crept into her pale
cheeks to see at last this promised fruition of her father's
hopes.</p>
<p>Colombino's last words to Onorato were: 'Depend upon it, within
a month I shall have taken the field.' Then, whilst the little man
laughed and rubbed his hands, the captain turned to take his leave
of Samaritana, and employed in doing so more words than he had yet
addressed to her in their total.</p>
<p>'If I take now a reluctant leave, madonna, it is in the
confident hope that I shall have the happiness of setting you in
Ravenna before many weeks are past.'</p>
<p>With that he took her hand and bowed his tawny head to set a
kiss upon it. He had a feeling then that only the firmness of his
grip had prevented that little hand from eluding his lips.</p>
<p>Remembering this, her silence and the trouble in her glance, he
sighed more than once as he rode back to Montasco; and if some of
his sighs were for her, some were for himself.</p>
<h3>&mdash; ii &mdash;</h3>
<p>True to his pledge, Colombino within the month opened the
campaign for the reconquest of Ravenna, and the battle of
Civitella, which added fresh laurels to his brow, was fought in the
early days of May. For Venice despatched an army in haste with
orders to push forward, meet, and destroy him as he came down the
foothills of the Appenines, long before he so much as set foot upon
Venetian territory.</p>
<p>Venice little suspected that in these anticipatory measures she
was doing neither more nor less than Colombino had desired and
reckoned. His dispositions, indeed, had begun by startling Onorato
da Polenta. Within a week of their agreement little else was being
talked of in Siena but the fact that Colombino was marshalling an
army to invade the Veneto, and it followed that from Siena the news
would go out over Italy like a ripple over water.</p>
<p>Onorato was not merely startled, he was angry. The wide,
humorous mouth was grimly scornful as he inveighed to Petrucci and
others against the insanity of a captain who made boastful
proclamation of his intentions. In the end he went off with his
fury to Montasco, which he found in a hum of preparation, the
courtyard and the military quarters in the eastern wing swarming
with men-at-arms.</p>
<p>When the old man furiously remonstrated with Colombino,
reminding him of the old military axiom that surprise is at any
time worth a thousand lances, the young captain smiled upon his
ingenuousness.</p>
<p>'I desire to be honest,' said he.</p>
<p>'Honest!' Onorato's consternation ascended yet steeper heights.
'This is not a joust, sir. It is war!'</p>
<p>Colombino explained himself. 'If Venice had disbanded her
armies, there would he grounds for your misgivings. But she has
not. Colleoni is now too old to take the field; but not too old to
advise; and knowing his methods, I have a notion what his advice
will be. At present Belluomo is in the pay of Venice with an army
twice as strong in numbers as any that I can muster. For Belluomo I
have no great respect. But numbers are numbers; and it would
nothing profit you to have me seize Ravenna merely to be pinned
there by Belluomo's vastly superior force. That is what surprise
would accomplish.'</p>
<p>He paused, so as to allow the Lord of Ravenna to grasp and
appreciate that cardinal fact; and already Onorato was staring at
him with round eyes and open mouth, whilst in the background
Sangiorgio was quietly smiling and Caliente broadly grinning.
Colombino resumed.</p>
<p>'It follows, then, that my aim must be first to meet Belluomo in
the open, and there either destroy him, or at least so weaken him
that I shall afterwards be in sufficient strength to deal with the
forces remaining to him for a siege. Thus we shall temporarily
disable Venice, and you will be given the opportunity to
consolidate yourself before she can arm again to come against you.
It is to ensure this that I am widely publishing my preparations.
If I know Colleoni's mind at all, he will send Belluomo's army to
bar my passage into the territory of Ravenna, and that will be my
opportunity There is no other course that will serve our ends, my
lord.'</p>
<p>The Lord Onorato, who had come to storm, remained to worship, in
awe of a soldier who pushed strategy to such lengths as these. And
whilst he commended and apologized in one, Colombino was
admonishing him.</p>
<p>'Trouble no more about me, my lord. What I have undertaken I
will accomplish if it be humanly possible. Your own work should now
lie in Milan with Duke Francesco. Let him know what is preparing,
so that he may be ready to follow it up when the moment comes. Once
I am in Ravenna, I may have to look to you to relieve me with
troops from Milan. We must prepare for every contingency.'</p>
<p>Obediently the Lord Onorato had set off for Milan, and there he
learnt of the battle of Civitella and how completely it fulfilled
Colombino's calculations.</p>
<p>Belluomo had reached the plains of the Forlivese when his scouts
brought him word that Colombino's army was at the head of the
Valley of the Ronco. There, Colombino had deliberately paused, so
as to rest his men for the engagement upon which he counted
hereabouts.</p>
<p>Belluomo pushed on, and on the morrow beheld Colombino's army
coming to meet him down the hills through the grey olive trees that
straggled over their flanks. The Venetian took up at once a
position that should serve as a starting-point for one of those
games of living chess which still made up a campaign between
mercenary forces, who desired neither to suffer nor to cause
unnecessary casualties. Usually these manoeuvres for position were
pursued until one side obtained a strategic advantage so obvious
that it only remained for the other to admit defeat and lay down
its arms. Colombino, however, had so far prevailed by departure
from, rather than observance of, these antiquated methods, and it
was soon plain to Belluomo that it was the enemy's intention at
once to deliver battle. He could scarcely believe in his own good
fortune, for with twice Colombino's numbers there could be only one
issue for the young captain from this rashness.</p>
<p>Swiftly and exultantly he took his measures to ensure that
foolhardy young man's destruction. And even with his superior
numbers there was nothing foolhardy about Belluomo's dispositions.
He was a captain who took no chances, and he followed very definite
and settled principles of war. He adopted now the time-honoured
practice of dividing his forces into two battles, each of some two
thousand five hundred men, and each therefore equal to the whole of
the opposing army.</p>
<p>Retaining one of these under his own command in the position
already taken up, so as to check Colombino's advance, he sent the
other, under the best of his lieutenants, Gravedonna, round the
hill to the north, so as to menace Colombino's left flank. And he
allowed the manoeuvre to be plainly seen, calculating that, so as
to elude the threat of these pincers, Colombino must drag his army
up the southern ascent. It would then be for Belluomo to deal with
him by a converging movement of all his forces.</p>
<p>It was all so clear and plain in Belluomo's mind that already he
counted the victory won. But, to his profound amazement, as if the
young man intended to promote his own destruction, instead of the
southern retreat upon which Belluomo reckoned, he beheld him come
steadily on down that narrow valley, following the course of the
stream. Already he was not more than a half-mile away. Let him but
continue this advance a little, and his danger then would be not
merely of being outflanked, but of being taken in the rear by
Gravedonna's division and so of being inevitably crushed between
the two Venetian battles.</p>
<p>Belluomo was stirred to compassion. The poor lad made it evident
that he had still a deal to learn of the difficult art of war. He
was not to be taken seriously, and because of this pitying
contempt, Belluomo did not even trouble to stand to receive the
threatened attack, but moved forward so as to expedite matters and
be the sooner done.</p>
<p>And now, at last, the poor lad called a halt, and had summoned
Caliente to his side. Sangiorgio spurred up, with an urgent prayer
that his captain should give attention to the danger of
Gravedonna's flanking movement.</p>
<p>'There is no danger,' he was quietly answered, and Colombino
expounded: 'It will take that division the best part of an hour to
reach the summit, and some little time longer to marshal its ranks
before the attack is launched. By that time there will be no flank
to attack, and the battle should be over.' He turned in his saddle.
'Don Pablo, are you ready?'</p>
<p>Caliente, a colossal figure in his armour, astride of a charger
that was like an elephant, grinned through the open visor of his
helmet.</p>
<p>With his mace he pointed to the orderly mass of horsemen behind
him, numbering close upon a thousand.</p>
<p>'You will charge at once, then. And you will charge through.
Understand that clearly. Let nothing tempt you to do more or less.
No matter in what disarray you fling them, no matter what
advantages you may see in a protracted engagement, you will go
right through their ranks. Like a spear. Let that be your only aim.
And when you are through, ride gently on until you hear my
trumpets. You understand.'</p>
<p>'As if I were a spit and that battle a capon.'</p>
<p>Colombino nodded, his face stern, his lips tightly compressed.
'Forward, then, and Saint Michael ride with you!'</p>
<p>Don Pablo rose in his stirrups, he swung his ponderous mace
above his head, a trumpet sounded, and with a gathering roll as of
thunder a thousand horsemen, their armour flashing in the sunlight,
were launched upon Belluomo's force. The gentle slope of the ground
increased their impetus, the check which their charge imposed upon
the advancing host by its suddenness had a demoralizing effect.
Before Belluomo could station his pikemen to meet this act of
madness, Caliente's men were upon them. The front rank crumpled
back upon those behind. For a moment the sheer mass of the
Venetians in that narrow place resisted the Spaniard's onslaught,
then the ranks opened, as instinctively the disordered men flung
themselves to the right or the left out of that murderous line of
charge.</p>
<p>From his station above, with Sangiorgio at his side, Colombino
beheld Don Pablo's squadron cleave its way into the middle of that
heaving mass, and check there a moment whilst the valley rang as
with the din of some Titanic smithy. Then Don Pablo ripped onwards
until he was clear of the press through which he had cut that
murderous furrow, his men riding more gently now, but with all the
air of being intent upon escape.</p>
<p>Behind them, under the furious command of Belluomo and his
officers, the Venetians, disordered and confused were rallying and
attempting to re-form their ranks.</p>
<p>Colombino looked to the left. Gravedonna's columns had not yet
reached the brow of the hill. He made a sign and his trumpets
blared out. Then he charged with the remains of his cavalry, some
four hundred horse, whilst Sangiorgio followed with the foot, a
thousand strong between pikemen and crossbowmen, the sutlers'
wagons coming last.</p>
<p>Don Pablo acting faithfully upon his orders, wheeled his
horsemen at that trumpet blast, and came thundering back again,
timing his charge so nicely that Belluomo's force was caught
simultaneously between Colombino's two divisions, and cracked there
like a nut between two stones. The Venetians, demoralized as any
force must be that has lost perception of which is its front and
which its rear, scarcely resisted.</p>
<p>By the time Gravedonna brought his columns to the heights over
which they were to have made their flanking movement, he perceived,
to his dismay, that nothing remained but to ride hard to the
assistance of the main battle, which already had all but ceased to
exist.</p>
<p>Belluomo himself was in flight up the hillside to the north with
a little troop to form a bodyguard, whilst in the plain his men
were throwing down their arms and calling for quarter.</p>
<p>Before Gravedonna came up, to be received with a hail of
crossbow quarrels and to be arrested by Sangiorgio's pikes and
compelled to retire before the menace of Colombino's horsemen
skirmishing on his flank, the battle of Civitella was at an end. Of
Belluomo's division, not more than three hundred escaped to rejoin
their captain, who now with Gravedonna on the ground from which
Colombino had launched his attack was marshalling the Venetian
forces afresh and disposing to recommence the battle in an
endeavour to retrieve the fortunes of the day.</p>
<p>But Colombino did not wait for this. With calm speed he gave his
orders.</p>
<p>If the dead among Belluomo's following were comparatively few,
there were upwards of five hundred wounded and disabled, and some
twelve hundred prisoners ringed about by a division of Don Pablo's
horse. In no case to encumber himself with these, Colombino was
content to render them impotent by depriving them of horses, arms,
boots, and most of their clothing. Having possessed himself of
Belluomo's vast baggage, which included a magnificent siege-train,
stores, arms, tents, and general supplies, he entrusted all this to
Caliente, who, driving the horses before him in a herd, was ordered
to march northward at once upon Ravenna.</p>
<p>Behind him came Colombino and Sangiorgio, and fighting rearguard
actions all the way, they fell steadily back before Belluomo's
depleted army, and came three days later safely to Ravenna, where
Caliente, well received by the inhabitants, had already installed
himself in the vast new fortress twenty-four hours earlier.</p>
<p>Thence, having despatched a messenger to Onorato da Polenta in
Milan with an account of the events, Colombino put off at last his
harness, and took his ease, whilst in the marshy plain to the south
of the stronghold, the dejected and disgruntled Belluomo sat down
to besiege him.</p>
<p>By this Colombino was no longer exercised. A siege by Belluomo,
shorn of half his forces and bereft of siege artillery, was no
longer a formidable affair. Besides, the victory of Civitella had
introduced new factors. Onorato da Polenta should have no
difficulty in prevailing upon Francesco Sforza to lend his support,
now that so little remained to be done. Once the Duke of. Milan's
troops appeared before Ravenna, Belluomo would once more find
himself between two fires, and the rout of the Venetian army should
then be complete.</p>
<h3>&mdash; iii &mdash;</h3>
<p>Annibale Belluomo, foiled and smarting, laid siege to a city
which he knew himself unable to carry by assault. But because he
did not intend to remain in this situation, because he must redeem
his reputation in the eyes of his harsh Venetian taskmasters, and
because he burned to be avenged upon the insolent Colombo da Siena,
whom he regarded as having been singularly and unfairly favoured by
fortune, he sent to Venice for reinforcements and another
siege-train.</p>
<p>The siege-train came at the end of a week, a siege-train vastly
inferior to the one Belluomo had lost. But the only reinforcement
Venice sent him was a commissioner, a lean, white-faced,
tightlipped member of the Council of Ten, the Procurator Francesco
Gritti. His mere appearance in the camp before Ravenna, arguing
Venetian loss of faith in her condottiero, filled Belluomo with
uneasiness.</p>
<p>Seated in Belluomo's pavilion, his black robe drawn about his
lean shanks, as if his bloodlessness felt cold, although it was a
sunny day of May, Messer Gritti was harsh, sneering, and
uncompromising in the terms of censure which he did not hesitate to
employ.</p>
<p>Annibale Belluomo, a large, florid, paunchy man, of a gaudy
taste in dress, with the strength and the courage of a bull, stood
abashed to listen.</p>
<p>'You ask for reinforcements at a time when you should know that
the Most Serene Republic has disbanded all troops in her pay saving
only those of your condotta. That in retaining you, from among the
captains who served her, the Republic made a wise decision is
something which the facts now appear to contradict.</p>
<p>'For what was to do here, the troops at your command, in
competent hands, and even in incompetent ones, should abundantly
have sufficed. Your force numbered fully twice that of the young
captain who opposed you, and it was vastly superior in equipment.
Yet in a single ill-judged and ill-fought engagement, you have
suffered these advantages to be lost. Half your force has melted
away, broken and destroyed, and your equipment&mdash;including the
most complete and powerful siege-train ever put into the
field&mdash;is now in the possession of the enemy. It will not
surprise you that the Most Serene has little confidence left in
you, or that unless with what force remains you can retrieve the
confidence you have lost, the consequences may be very grave.'</p>
<p>The condottiero, sweating at once with fear and rage, muttered
abject platitudes about the fortunes of war.</p>
<p>'It is easy for you men of the robe to sit snugly in the council
chamber and criticize the operations in the field, for never having
seen an engagement, you know nothing of the incalculable chances
that are involved. Fortune was unjustly favourable to this fellow
from Siena. He prevailed by a rash audacity which no soldier of
experience could have dreamed of committing, and one which by all
the laws of war should have resulted in his destruction.'</p>
<p>'The more shame to you, then, that it resulted in his
victory.'</p>
<p>'But&mdash;God give me patience with you!&mdash;that is what I
mean by the fortune of war.'</p>
<p>Messer Gritti shifted in his chair. He tapped the table before
him with a long, bony forefinger. 'The Most Serene demands in her
captains the ability to control fortune. Have you forgotten Busoni
who was Count of Carmagnola?'</p>
<p>Belluomo turned purple at that allusion to the great captain
whom the Republic had beheaded for the ill-conduct of a
campaign.</p>
<p>'In the name of God! You'll not compare me with Carmagnola! That
was a traitor.'</p>
<p>Eyes that were cold and grey as steel regarded him steadily from
under level black brows. Lips that were thin, crafty, and cruel
smiled almost imperceptibly in scorn.</p>
<p>'The results were the same; and it is by results that we judge a
man. What shall assure us that you are honest?'</p>
<p>'This,' said Belluomo, 'is too much.' He mopped the sweat from
his brow and from his short, thick neck.</p>
<p>Messer Gritti went coldly on. 'I bring you a siege-train to
replace the one you have lost. It is inferior, far inferior; but
the best we can supply. And, anyway, with the remaining men at your
command it should be sufficient for your purpose, provided that you
display more zeal than hitherto.'</p>
<p>'I vow to God I have never lacked for zeal!' roared
Belluomo.</p>
<p>'For skill, then.'</p>
<p>'Nor yet for skill!' He banged the table with his massive
fist.</p>
<p>'Then it seems to me that you condemn yourself. For only honesty
remains.'</p>
<p>'For a man determined to think ill, perhaps. But there is still
fortune, as I have told you; and that is all that has been
lacking.'</p>
<p>Messer Gritti, that cold fish of a man, was not moved by this
vehemence.</p>
<p>'See that your fortune changes before it completely submerges
you. You have no time to lose. Is it necessary that I should tell
you that Ravenna must be reduced before its treacherous example can
infect other states now in Venetian vassalage? That is a calamity
we need not perhaps at present contemplate, nor its consequences,
to you, who will be held responsible.'</p>
<p>From that awe-inspiring interview, Belluomo went to work with
the zeal of a man who was fighting not for his employers but for
his own life.</p>
<p>Within the ensuing week he had conceived and executed three
several plans for carrying the city by assault, each of which had
been repulsed with heavy loss. The vigilance and skill of Colombino
made easy work of it.</p>
<p>Reeling back to his pavilion, sick at heart, through the grey
mists of a summer dawn, after the defeat of his third attempt,
Belluomo found Messer Gritti there, awaiting him.</p>
<p>The pale-faced procurator was like ice in his anger.</p>
<p>'I will do you the justice to admit that at least you are
honest. For it begins to become plain that you are opposed to a
soldier far greater than yourself.'</p>
<p>Than this he could have administered no more cutting whiplash.
Belluomo strode to his couch, and clanked down, his bespattered
armour still upon him. 'If you have so high an opinion of the
fellow the more fools you and your Council of Ten for not hiring
him to your service when you might have done so.'</p>
<p>'It's an omission that may yet be repaired.' The procurator, who
had been pacing the pavilion, halted before the soldier, and held
out a strip of parchment. 'Read that.'</p>
<p>Belluomo slewed round, so that the increasing daylight might
fall upon the writing. But he need scarcely have troubled, for the
Venetian gave him full information.</p>
<p>'Whatever else you may lack, you possess at least vigilant
outposts. A man was caught an hour ago attempting to cross the
lines. In your absence they brought him to me. That letter was in
the lining of his shoe. An elementary method of concealment. It is
from Onorato da Polenta, enjoining Colombo to stand firm, since
Francesco Sforza, enheartened by your defeat at Civitella, is
raising an army to come to his relief. Three weeks, you'll observe,
is the utmost time required. Three weeks.'</p>
<p>Belluomo took the bitterness in the man's voice to be a
reflection of the bitterness in his soul. And he was dangerously
near to being maliciously glad of the mental torment of this fellow
who had so tormented him with his cold, sarcastic hectorings. He
actually laughed, although without mirth, as he returned the scrap
of parchment. Then, whilst unbuckling the straps of his harness, he
delivered himself.</p>
<p>'I told you a week ago that reinforcements would be needed. Now
perhaps you believe me.'</p>
<p>The answer was barbed with contempt. 'You had no thought for
this, but only for your own incompetence when you clamoured for
more troops.'</p>
<p>'Do you read thoughts now? How do you know what is in my
mind?'</p>
<p>'What is in your mind I can tell with tolerable certainty. And
that is nothing.'</p>
<p>Belluomo, suddenly white, ventured for once to give as much as
he took.</p>
<p>'If you had been less of a fool, with your airs and your sneers,
if you had possessed some scraps of this competence of which you
make so much pestilent chatter, you would have perceived that this
thing was inevitable.'</p>
<p>The procurator quivered as if he had been struck. But he refused
to display heat. He remained coldly superior. 'And why, pray, is it
inevitable? Because your blundering has made it so. In the face of
that you should study humility.'</p>
<p>Belluomo was tugging at a strap. He paused. Look you, Messer
Gritti, you may put the blame where you please. I care not a rat's
tail for your opinion. I won my spurs at my trade long ago, and my
military reputation is not at the mercy of your judgment, I thank
God.'</p>
<p>'You have occasion to thank God for that. Do you read
Plautus?'</p>
<p>'Plautus?' Belluomo stared. 'Who's he?'</p>
<p>Messer Gritti sighed. 'A pity you have no learning! It might
help you to understand me when I say that you remind me of his
Miles Gloriosus, a braggart, rhodomonting captain, full of sound
because otherwise empty and hollow.'</p>
<p>'And I remind you of him!' Belluomo heaved himself up. 'By
<i>God</i>, sir! I find you intolerable.'</p>
<p>'Ah! Then, if in nothing else, we are in harmony at least in our
opinions of each other. But we are not here to quarrel upon them.
We have a situation to face and a duty to perform.'</p>
<p>'Then face it by doing what I advised a week ago. Send to Venice
for more troops. Let the Most Serene hire Gattamelata to support
me.'</p>
<p>'We have three weeks. Gattamelata could not take the field in
six.' Messer Gritti gave reasons, coldly, passionlessly technical.
They convinced Belluomo and humbled him.</p>
<p>'What then?' he asked helplessly</p>
<p>'Is it possible that, in spite of all your thrasonical ranting,
you ask me that?' The procurator paused, his lips tight. Then from
the table he took up another strip of parchment exactly like the
first. 'Look at this.'</p>
<p>Belluomo took it, and read with deepening wonder. Again it was a
letter from Onorato da Polenta. But its contents were the very
opposite of the first one.</p>
<p class="letter">These in doleance to warn you not to lean upon
false hopes. My endeavours here have failed. Milan either cannot or
will not lend assistance. Therefore, you must depend as I do
entirely upon yourself and the resources at your command. The
courage and address you displayed at Civitella permit me to wait
with confidence.<br>
<br>
ONORATO DA POLENTA</p>
<p>Bewildered, Belluomo took up again the first letter. He compared
the two, and could not doubt that they were in the same hand, even
to the flourish adorning the signature. He raised his puzzled eyes.
'What does it mean?'</p>
<p>'In the first place, that I am a skilful penman.'</p>
<p>'You mean that you...Oh! But to what purpose?'</p>
<p>'Let me help your perplexities. First, you must find me an
intelligent man, if such a one exists among your following, to take
the place of the captured messenger. Second, this message should
sensibly lessen Colombino's confidence. Third, whilst it is so
lessened, we deliver an attack upon his loyalty It means, my
captain, that dull arms must yield to the toga. My wits must supply
the lack left by your military blundering. I must step in and take
charge so that we may not perish by your ineptitude.'</p>
<p>'Ah!' Belluomo became sarcastic in his turn. 'It follows that we
shall see fine things.'</p>
<p>But Messer Gritti paid no heed. Pacing calmly to and fro in the
pavilion, he expounded further.</p>
<p>'This Colombino is a greedily acquisitive rogue. It has just
come to my knowledge that in the campaign between Rovieto and the
Scaligeri his faith was bought by Della Scala for two hundred
thousand ducats.'</p>
<p>'Lord! Does your wisdom put faith in scandalmongers?'</p>
<p>'No. Not in scandalmongers. I had a visitor two days ago; a
lady, as you may have heard. The sometime Countess of Rovieto, who
is now landless and dispossessed because of this rascal's treachery
Some lingering hopes that she bases upon Venetian assistance
prompted her to seek me, to tell me that if we are in difficulties
here, we can always purchase our way out of them.'</p>
<p>And you believe it? Bah!'</p>
<p>'We need not dispute a matter which we are about to test. This
letter is to pave the way. If you will find me the messenger I
need, the rest can wait until tomorrow.'</p>
<p>That messenger, a cross-gartered peasant, approached Ravenna in
the dusk of that May evening, and, having softly drawn the
attention of a sentinel on the ramparts, swam the moat and gained
admission by a postern.</p>
<p>Colombino was at supper with his captains when the letter was
brought. He read it twice, first in bewilderment, then in
suspicion, and tossed it to his two captains, who, having read,
looked at him in dismay.</p>
<p>'Malediction!' said Caliente. 'It's unfortunate.'</p>
<p>'It's curious,' said Sangiorgio, and pulled his beard. 'Curious,
yes. More curious than unfortunate,' Colombino opined. 'If the Lord
of Ravenna had desired to discourage us he could hardly have done
better. Shall we take a look at this messenger of his? It might be
prudent.'</p>
<p>The clown was fetched, a stolid, dull fellow by his air, showing
a natural awe of these soldiers.</p>
<p>But Colombino, very affable, put him entirely at his ease.</p>
<p>'Don Pablo, give this worthy lad a cup of wine. He's wet, and
shivering with cold.'</p>
<p>The wine was poured and gratefully drunk. Colombino lounging in
his tall chair considered him with friendly eyes.</p>
<p>'You deserve a hatful of ducats for the service you've performed
and the risks you took. Tell me, from whom did you have this
letter?'</p>
<p>'From the Lord Onorato himself, may it please your potency'</p>
<p>'You are sure of that? Sure that it was the Lord Onorato
himself.'</p>
<p>'I've been too long in his service to be mistaken, my lord.'</p>
<p>'Ah! You were in Candia with him when he was exiled there.'</p>
<p>'In Candia. Yes, my lord.'</p>
<p>Don Pablo jerked up his head, and looked more fully at the
messenger.</p>
<p>'Then you would be with him last year, when he was in
England.'</p>
<p>'To be sure I was, magnificent.'</p>
<p>Colombino's affability increased. 'And how did you like
England?'</p>
<p>The fellow grinned. 'I like Ravenna better.'</p>
<p>'I've been disputing with my captains here a matter that you can
settle, having been so long in the Lord Onorato's service.'
Colombino stood up, displaying his imposing height. 'Don Pablo
Caliente here has wagered me that the Lord Onorato is fully as tall
as myself, and I have laid him ten ducats that I am the taller by
an inch. What should you say, my friend?'</p>
<p>The clown considered him for a moment, blinking. 'Faith, it'll
be a near thing between you, my lord. I'll not dare to say.'</p>
<p>'You are wise,' said Colombino. He sat down again. 'Wise, but
not wise enough. You were insufficiently schooled by those that
sent you.' His manner had lost none of its amiability 'They should
have told you that the Lord Onorato is a little man, at least five
inches shorter than myself; that his place of exile was Crete and
not Candia; and they should have told you enough to prevent you
from being gulled by a tale that he was ever in England. Now, my
friend, your bubble's pricked. Will you tell us the rest, of your
own free will, or shall the engines squeeze it out of you?'</p>
<p>The clown was on his knees clamouring for mercy. Don Pablo was
expressing a joyous amazement in morphological Spanish oaths, and
Sangiorgio was grim.</p>
<p>'You shall come by no harm here, my lad,' Colombino assured the
terror-stricken peasant. And you'll find my service better than
that of the knave who hired you to this treachery. Be wise, then;
by which I mean, be truthful.'</p>
<h3>&mdash; iv &mdash;</h3>
<p>Messer Gritti did not keep them waiting for the second act of
the little comedy he had prepared.</p>
<p>Towards noon of the morrow there came to Colombino in the
quarters he had established in the Casa Polentana, the home of the
Lords of Ravenna, an officer bringing word that a little troop
under a white flag had ridden up to the South Gate. Ser Annibale
Belluomo came to request a parley and desired safe-conduct.</p>
<p>When eventually he was ushered into the state chamber of the
palace, where Colombino waited to receive him, he did not come
alone. With him, preceding him into the room as if by right of
rank, came the tall, gaunt, funereal Messer Gritti. Save for his
white, crafty face and the linen hands at throat and wrists, the
statesman was all black, from his lank hair to his square shoes,
and he walked delicately, as if he stepped on eggs. After him, in
vivid contrast, rolled Belluomo, portly, blond, and florid, all in
flaming scarlet, with a clank and jingle to his swagger.</p>
<p>From the table at which he had been writing, Colombino rose to
receive them. In the long surcoat of grey velvet, with a gold chain
at his neck and a caul of gold thread confining his thick tawny
hair, he looked the courtier rather than the soldier, and in his
reception of them he displayed the urbane dignity of a prince.</p>
<p>'This honour is unexpected; but you are none the less welcome,
sirs.' His fine hand, innocent of any jewel, waved each in turn to
a seat, then he resumed his own chair, so placed that his back was
to the tall windows and the sunlit garden beyond.</p>
<p>'Command me,' Colombino invited.</p>
<p>Messer Gritti cleared his throat and loosed his harsh voice.</p>
<p>They came, he announced, in terms that had obviously been
rehearsed, to avoid that precious time should be wasted, valuable
property destroyed, and good blood shed in vain. Next he proceeded
to demonstrate that Ravenna's resistance was futile. Venice
commanded almost inexhaustible resources, which she would not
hesitate to employ Conceivably Messer Colombo was counting upon
assistance from the Duke of Milan. If so, he built upon sand.
Messer Gritti had sure information from dependable agents of the
Serene in Milan that Francesco Sforza would not, and could not if
he would, lend any assistance. Did, then, Messer Colombo, consider
it worth his while to persist until starvation must compel him to
admit defeat? Would he not be better advised to surrender whilst he
might do so with the honours of war, rather than forfeit by the
protraction of this siege every right to merciful
consideration?</p>
<p>Belluomo, listening to those measured periods, delivered in that
harsh, monotonous voice, expected at the end defiance and derision
from the young soldier to whom they were addressed. Instead,
however, to his amazement, Colombino remained thoughtful, chin in
hand, and the eyes he raised at last were mild and dreamy. It
looked, indeed, as if the spirit had been slain in him by that
forged letter. When presently he spoke it was in the subdued voice
of a man who is beggared of confidence.</p>
<p>'All this may be as you say, sir. But it remains that I have
pledged my service. I am paid to hold Ravenna for my Lord Onorato
da Polenta.'</p>
<p>It was a statement that opened wide the door for Messer Gritti,
and eagerly, confidently, he entered.</p>
<p>'You are paid? What are you paid, if I may presume to ask?'</p>
<p>Colombino answered frankly, a further evidence of despondency.
There was a glitter now in the steely eyes of the Venetian.</p>
<p>'And is it only in the hope of this hundred thousand ducats that
you hold the city?'</p>
<p>'What else? With me war is a trade like any other. I do not
pursue it for my distraction, or for barren glory.'</p>
<p>The procurator leaned forward, his elbow on his knee, and
significantly lowered his voice. 'Has it occurred to you that you
might possibly find the Most Serene Republic a more generous
paymaster?'</p>
<p>Colombino sighed. 'Unfortunately I am not in the pay of
Venice.'</p>
<p>'What hinders you from entering it?'</p>
<p>The abruptness of that question clearly startled the young
condottiero. His suddenly quickened glance faltered before the
Venetian's glittering eyes. He covered his mouth with his hand.
Then at last he spoke, with the hesitation of a tempted man.</p>
<p>'There is my obligation to the Lord Onorato.'</p>
<p>'That obligation is ended by the situation, which properly
considered is a situation of defeat&mdash;ultimately assured, if
not immediate. You merely go to meet the inevitable in accepting it
at once. And I am prepared to assure you that the Most Serene and
ever-generous Republic will signify her satisfaction for the pains
you will have spared her and for avoiding the ruin of her property
here in Ravenna, by a payment of two hundred thousand ducats.'</p>
<p>Thus he came straight to the heart of the matter, wrapping the
proposed betrayal in neat speciousness, supplying Colombino with
all the justifications that a traitor ever needs. Having spoken
thus boldly, he sat back, his waxen hands on his black-clad bony
knees, and waited. His patience was not tried. Almost instantly
Colombino cast off languor and hesitations.</p>
<p>'Do you pay in advance?'</p>
<p>Messer Gritti caught his breath. From Belluomo there was an
inarticulate grunt that was prompted by disgust. The things they
said of this fellow were true, then. Treachery was in his blood. He
was a disgrace to the trade of arms.</p>
<p>The procurator stroked his shaven chin. 'You shall be paid in
advance what moneys I have at hand&mdash;some fifty thousand
ducats&mdash;as an earnest of our compact. We pay the balance when
Ravenna is surrendered.'</p>
<p>Colombino regarded him steadily for a moment. Then, abruptly, he
rose.</p>
<p>'Fetch the gold, and we'll talk of this again. In the meantime,
I will consider.'</p>
<p>They took that dismissal, but as they rode back to the Venetian
camp in the marshy lands south of the city, Belluomo shook his
great head over Messer Gritti's self-laudatory hymn of victory.</p>
<p>'I can't bring myself to believe in it. It is too easy. It'll
not surprise me if you end by being hoist with your own
petard.'</p>
<p>The procurator vouchsafed him a glance of contempt. 'You
understand men as little as you understand your trade. Fortunately
the conduct of this business is in my hands.'</p>
<p>Belluomo kept his temper as best he could. 'We shall see what we
shall see.'</p>
<p>What he saw that evening when they went again into Ravenna
accompanied by two men bearing the sacks of ducats was evidence
that he was wrong and Messer Gritti right.</p>
<p>Again Colombino was alone when they were admitted to his
presence. A map of the city and its surroundings was spread upon
his table.</p>
<p>'If I sell you the place without more ado, I ruin my career as a
captain of fortune.' His uplifted hand restrained Messer Gritti's
interruption. 'This thing must be so contrived as to make it clear
that I yield to military necessity. For this I shall lose some
credit. That will be your gain, Messer Belluomo.'</p>
<p>The big soldier looked at him now with undisguised dislike. He
threw out his broad chest. 'That consummation is in any case
inevitable.'</p>
<p>Colombino bowed his head. 'If I had not recognized that
probability, I should never have listened to your proposals. Here
now are mine.' He turned to the map, and beckoned them forward. He
was very brisk.</p>
<p>'On a night to be determined you shall carry the city by
assault. Thus: You will march a force of not less than a thousand
men round to the north, going wide of the city, so that the
movement may not be suspected. You will have to do so in any case,
so as to cross the canal, which you can do only here, two miles to
eastward, by the Bridge of San Sisto.' He indicated on the map the
bridge over the canal which connected the city with the sea, built
since the days when the Adriatic had flowed through Ravenna as it
now flowed through Venice and before it had receded.</p>
<p>'With this force, you will open an attack on the Venezia Gate.
You will make it violent, with a full display of strength, so as to
justify me in bringing my entire garrison to the threatened point.
Once this is accomplished, which will be exactly a half-hour after
the attack has opened, a second force of yours&mdash;five or six
hundred men will suffice for this&mdash;will launch a genuine
attack against the South Gate which by then will be utterly
undefended. You will throw an improvised bridge across the moat
there, and with rams or gunpowder you can break down the postern in
a few minutes. As there will be no defenders, there will be no
resistance. The noise will be drowned by the greater uproar across
the city here on the north. Once a dozen men are in, they possess
themselves of the machinery of the drawbridge, and in as many
minutes they will have lowered it to admit the whole body of
assailants. This force will charge straight across the city, to
take me in the rear. Perceiving the peril and not knowing its
extent or the numbers with which I shall have to deal, it will be
natural for me to withdraw my men into the citadel in the best
order possible, leaving the invaders free access to the Venezia
Gate, which they will open to your main division.</p>
<p>'Thus you make yourselves masters of the city. The obvious
sequel is that from your position of advantage you summon me to
surrender, offering me the honours of war. In all the circumstances
it will be seen that I shall have no alternative but to
accept.'</p>
<p>There he paused, and looking shamelessly from one to the other
of them, inquired did the plan receive Messer Belluomo's
approval.</p>
<p>It was Messer Gritti who answered. Even in that moment he could
not repress his sour, sneering humour.</p>
<p>'The military credit that will accrue to Messer Belluomo assures
you of that.'</p>
<p>The sarcasm quenched the gleam in the eye of the Venetian
captain. He shrugged and grunted, whilst Colombino resumed.</p>
<p>'We are agreed, then. This is Friday. If Sunday night will suit
you for the attack, that will suit me. Let the action in the north
commence a half-hour before midnight, and that on the South Gate at
midnight precisely.'</p>
<p>The procurator's glance consulted Belluomo. The captain nodded.
'Sunday night,' he agreed curtly.</p>
<p>Colombino swept aside the map. 'Then it but remains that you
jointly sign this bond for a hundred and fifty thousand ducats due
to me, and payable on demand.'</p>
<p>Messer Gritti frowned. 'Why this? Is not my word enough?'</p>
<p>'In a transaction so delicate it is imprudent to forgo full
payment in advance. If I consent to that, at least I must have the
nearest possible equivalent to the gold.'</p>
<p>Messer Gritti considered yet a moment. Then he shrugged. 'Ever
the man of business, Ser Colombo. I marvel you should have been
content to devote yourself to the trade of arms.'</p>
<p>'I find it sufficiently remunerative.'</p>
<p>Belluomo could not contain himself before so much cynicism.
'Conducted as you conduct it, sir, it must be.'</p>
<p>But Colombino laughed without shame. 'Do you sneer at me? You
should be grateful. I make things easy for you.'</p>
<p>'The devil burn your impudence!'</p>
<p>Colombino laughed again, and proffered the pen to Messer Gritti.
The procurator had been studying the document.</p>
<p>'It says nothing here of the consideration for which the gold is
due.'</p>
<p>'God give me patience, sir! Should I suffer that to be set down?
You must suppose me simple. Come, sir, do you sign or not?'</p>
<p>Messer Gritti plucked at his nether lip. 'After all...' He
checked, shrugged, and took the proffered pen. He signed, and then
Belluomo laboriously scrawled his signature below the
procurator's.</p>
<p>Messer Gritti departed chuckling at the thought that if the
corruption of Colombino had been expensive, it was cheap compared
with the alternative.</p>
<p>'Provided,' said the ever-uneasy Belluomo, 'that the rascal
keeps faith with us.'</p>
<p>'You may depend upon that,' sneered Gritti. 'For enough ducats
the dog would sell his own mother. That little Countess of Rovieto
knows her man.'</p>
<p>He had proof of his acumen that very night. Another messenger
was captured at the outposts; a departing one this time. Upon him
they found the following letter addressed to Onorato da
Polenta:</p>
<p class="letter">My lord&mdash;Your letters quench my last hope,
which lay in speedy relief by the Duke of Milan. Ravenna has
already suffered three severe assaults. These we have repulsed. But
a fourth, I fear, must carry the place, as we are in great distress
and running short of victuals, of which I account it my duty to
send you word.</p>
<p>Messer Gritti leered as he rubbed his knuckly hands. 'Thus that
plausible double-dealer prepares the ground for his treachery.'</p>
<p>His last doubt dispelled by this, Messer Belluomo made his
dispositions for Sunday with the greater confidence.</p>
<p>Soon after the May night had closed in, he marched his thousand
men away to the east through the marshes, then crossing the canal
by the distant Bridge of San Sisto, he followed the road round to
the northern side of Ravenna.</p>
<p>Gravedonna was left to command the body of five hundred foot
that was to charge into the city from the south.</p>
<p>Gritti remained in the camp with what was left of the army: a
thousand men who would march at dawn into captured Ravenna, but who
might meanwhile rest.</p>
<p>Punctually at a half-hour before midnight Belluomo opened his
demonstration at the Venezia Gate, and skilfully maintained it
until an explosion beyond the city informed him that Gravedonna had
blown in the postern. Very soon from the din and uproar within
Ravenna he gathered that Gravedonna was in the city and about the
work assigned to him. He stood ready now to enter as soon as the
gate should be opened from within. Time passed, and the gate
remained closed. The sounds of battle within the city, instead of
sweeping onwards towards the north, were actually receding. He
began to fear that something had miscarried. There was for a little
while almost a lull, followed at last by a terrific distant uproar,
not merely from the south of the city, but from a point somewhere
beyond it.</p>
<p>At the sudden conclusion forced upon him, a dreadful fear surged
up in Belluomo to receive almost instant confirmation. Those sounds
of battle must be coming from his own camp. What dreadful treachery
was here?</p>
<p>In frenzy he wheeled his men, and led them at breakneck speed
through the night, back by the way they had come, heading for that
distant scene of action. Whilst overhead the sky was clear and
starry, a shallow mist rising from the marshes made perilous that
reckless night ride over this treacherous ground. But of this
Belluomo reeked nothing. He reached the bridge, and led the way
over at a gallop. His silvery armour revealed him for a moment in
the gloom to those immediately following. Then he vanished,
abruptly as if the earth had swallowed him. And, indeed, something
akin to it had happened. A resounding splash in the waters below
announced the way he had taken.</p>
<p>Where the bridge had been when they had crossed earlier that
night, there was now an open chasm, and through this a dozen of his
riders followed him into the canal before in roaring confusion the
remainder of his company came to a halt upon the brink.</p>
<p>The condottiero was saved by a miracle from drowning. His armour
must have sunk him had he parted company with his charger as they
hurtled down together. He was unsaddled, it is true; but his hands
had wound themselves into the horse's mane, and to this he clung
with desperate strength. Shallows fortunately were not more than a
dozen yards away, and to these by luck or instinct the plunging
half-foundered beast brought its gasping rider.</p>
<p>Alternately panting and trumpeting with rage, the waterlogged
Belluomo clawed his slippery way up the slime of the bank, to slide
down again and yet again under the weight of his armour, until his
men came to his assistance. At last, hoisted to dry land, he sat
down, helpless, shivering, and exhausted, with his head in his
hands, to endeavour to conjecture what had happened.</p>
<p>It really set little strain upon conjecture.</p>
<p>Gravedonna, having blown up the postern, had entered the city
unopposed, and had gone boldly forward until he came to the open
space below the great fortress and within a half-bowshot of the
Venezia Gate. Here suddenly he found himself surrounded by a force
of more than twice his numbers and challenged to surrender if he
would save the lives of his men. He realized that he was in a trap,
and, casting the blame and responsibility upon those who had so
readily believed that Ravenna would be delivered to them, he made
no more ado. His five hundred, deprived of their arms, were marched
into the citadel.</p>
<p>Thereafter, whilst Belluomo was riding wildly for the Bridge of
San Sisto, where he would find himself cut off, Colombino led out
the whole of his forces and like a thunderbolt fell upon the
unsuspecting Venetian camp. Taking it thus completely by surprise,
he made short work of it. In the first pale glimmerings of dawn the
inhabitants of Ravenna beheld a mob of over a thousand prisoners on
foot, herded ignominiously into the city by Colombino's horsemen to
go and join the other prisoners in the fortress. After them came
Belluomo's supply wagons, laden with victuals, a drove of bullocks,
a herd of sheep, carts piled with tents, ammunition, arms, and
accoutrements, the spoils of that ridiculously easy victory.</p>
<p>And among the prisoners, but apart, and treated with great
deference by his captors, came Messer Francesco Gritti, whose
cunning had been so sedulously employed to this end, and whose soul
was now in bitterest ferment.</p>
<p>It remained only to deal with Belluomo.</p>
<p>Daybreak found him there on the canal's brink, chilled to the
marrow and to the soul. He was utterly without orientation. To
cross this pestilent canal he would have to go west beyond Ravenna.
And to what purpose should he now cross it? He was soldier enough
to understand exactly what had occurred. Colombino's craft, taking
advantage of Gritti's attempt to corrupt him, had divided the
Venetian army into three parts, and he had dealt separately with
two of them as easily as when he pleased he could now deal with the
third.</p>
<p>Belluomo's only course in this pass was to ride north, for
Venice, and so save what was left of his condotta. But either this
did not occur to him, or else in defeat his fear of the lords of
Venice was greater than his fear of Colombino. Be this as it may,
there by the canal, Colombino still found him, when he rode forth
in strength at sunrise.</p>
<p>What little heart remained in Belluomo went completely out of
him when he held that orderly force, two thousand strong,
glittering in the morning sunshine as it advanced upon his inferior
and dispirited following where it stood with its back to the water
and its retreat cut off.</p>
<p>He staggered up in miserable plight, an appalling figure,
plastered with mud and still oozing slime from between the joints
of his harness.</p>
<p>Accepting the inevitable, he sent an officer forward with a
trumpeter to ask for terms.</p>
<h3>&mdash; v &mdash;</h3>
&gt;
<p>It was a bitter day for Annibale Belluomo. The splendid army
which Venice had entrusted to him had melted away under the arts
and wiles of the infernal Colombino, in whose hands he was now a
prisoner. Nor was he treated even as an honourable prisoner should
be treated. Terms had been refused him. Unconditional surrender had
been demanded and in this he had been constrained by his
circumstances to acquiesce. He had, it was true, been permitted to
wash and reclothe himself; but for the rest he had been locked in
an underground cell like a criminal, and when towards evening he
was haled away to the Casa Polentana, he went with a halter round
his neck. The only grain of comfort afforded him was to find Messer
Francesco Gritti walking beside him with a similar decoration,
silent, livid, his eyes smouldering.</p>
<p>No sooner was Belluomo in his captor's presence, in that same
pleasant room where they had been earlier received, than he loosed
the fury begotten in him by this treatment and fiercely reproached
Colombino for this outrage upon all the usages of war between
captains.</p>
<p>'As a captain,' Colombino answered him, 'I dealt with you in the
field. Here I am to deal with you and your associate as seducers
who sought to corrupt the commander of a stronghold. You must have
forgotten that, since you dare to complain of your treatment.'</p>
<p>His words, delivered in calm, deliberate tones, sent a shiver
down Belluomo's spine. He hung his head as he stood beside the
proudly fierce, almost disdainful Messer Gritti.</p>
<p>Colombino was seated, as before, at the stout oaken table, his
back to the windows which had been flung wide to the fragrance of
the garden. Behind him stood his two marshals, Sangiorgio and
Caliente, and on his left, away at the long table's end, sat the
Lord Onorato's nephew, Cosimo da Polenta, a tall, handsome,
dark-complexioned man of thirty, who was tonsured and wore the
black garb of an ecclesiastic.</p>
<p>Guards with ordered halberts stood immediately behind the
prisoners.</p>
<p>Having silenced Belluomo by his answer, it was to Messer Gritti
that Colombino chiefly addressed himself, and as he proceeded
Belluomo's own humiliation was softened in the contemplation of
that of his illustrious fellow prisoner. He tasted in that hour
some of the sweets of vengeance upon this man under whose constant
sneers he had so keenly smarted.</p>
<p>'Messer Gritti, you esteem yourself, I think, a very subtle man;
and no doubt you are encouraged so to esteem yourself, for you deal
in arts which are accounted subtle in Venice, as I have had
occasion to observe. But the most subtle of minds may be reduced to
naught by presumption; and I judge you, Messer Gritti, to be a very
presumptuous man. This I shall hope for your own future
benefit&mdash;assuming that you are permitted to live to profit by
the lesson&mdash;to demonstrate to you.'</p>
<p>He paused there a moment, and then, in his calm, dispassionate
tone, slowly, like a man who chooses words with care, he continued
to pour the corrosive acid of his judgment upon the Venetian's
soul.</p>
<p>'Your first presumption is of knowledge of the military art.
Great soldiers, sir, are not created in the council chamber. They
are either born, like poets, or else made laboriously by experience
in the field. Since this presumption of yours led you to override
the captain appointed by the Most Serene Republic, the
responsibility for the failure here of the Venetian operations must
also be borne by you. This I am fully representing in letters to
the Council of Ten, which I have prepared.' He touched a sheaf of
parchments that lay before him.</p>
<p>'Your next and far grosser presumptions were that I am a knave
and a traitor. Heaven alone knows why you should have had so poor
an opinion of me. But I am concerned with what you thought, and not
with why you thought it.</p>
<p>'Presuming me a fool, you forge a letter to deceive me. And such
a letter!</p>
<p>'Ask yourself, Messer Gritti, if your wits are not entirely
addled, had the case been as that letter pretended would Onorato da
Polenta have troubled to write it? That question, and the answer to
it, would have occurred to any intelligent schoolboy; and yet one
and the other appear to have escaped the acumen of a subtle
statesman of Venice.</p>
<p>'You perceive now, no doubt, how my suspicions were aroused. But
you should have foreseen it; then it must also have occurred to you
that your messenger would be in my hands to be questioned. Such a
simple, obvious matter! You will imagine what I asked him. A really
subtle man would have imagined sooner and schooled his messenger
more fully. Then he would not have betrayed himself by agreeing
with me that the Lord Onorato is as tall as I am, that he had been
banished to Candia instead of Crete, and the like. It became
necessary, when we found him lying, that we should extract all the
truth from him. There are artless persuasions, well within the
scope of such subtlety as yours: filthy, abhorrent ways of which
you will have experience; the rack, the boot, and a simple,
nauseous business with knotted whipcord, known as woolding. I take
pride in the thought that I had recourse to none of these, and that
by gentler measures I obtained all that it mattered for me to know
before you sought me on the morrow upon the presumption that I am
for sale.</p>
<p>'Do you realize now into what jeopardy you walked? With the
evidence in my hands of what you had done, I should have been
justified in hanging you at once; and I should certainly have
hanged you without compunction if I had not perceived a better use
for you, perceived how I might take advantage of your shallow-pated
presumption so as to lead to destruction the army whose commander
you were overruling.'</p>
<p>The procurator of the Republic could stand no more. Reckless of
all peril, he spewed up the venom that was choking him.</p>
<p>'It was no presumption to assume you a traitor to be bought. For
that you are. You were bought by della Scala to betray the Countess
of Rovieto, as your father Terrarossa was bought to betray Florence
and was hanged for it, as you will hang at the end.'</p>
<p>Caliente took a step forward, breathing hard. Colombino's calm
hand restrained him. There was no change in the inflexion of his
voice.</p>
<p>'You are a brave man, Messer Gritti, or else a very rash and
foolish one, to use those words when the halter is round your
neck.'</p>
<p>'If I am to hang...' the Venetian was beginning.</p>
<p>'I understand,' Colombino interrupted him. 'You are presuming
now upon that. But again you are mistaken. Possibly, at least.
Whether you hang or not depends at the moment upon whether the
Council of Ten, with all the facts before it, as I have
scrupulously set them down, shall consider it worth while to
preserve your life. If the Most Serene Republic should not have had
enough of your subtleties and should consent to honour the bond by
which you engaged her to pay me one hundred and fifty thousand
ducats, I will undertake on my side to procure from the Lord
Onorato when he arrives your pardon for the attempt to corrupt the
commander of his forces.'</p>
<p>'Honour the bond?' Fury made the Venetian foolish. 'Have you
honoured your engagement under that bond, you double traitor?'</p>
<p>'Have the rods to the impudent dog,' growled Caliente. 'I'd have
cracked his scraggy neck between my fingers for the half of what he
has said to you.'</p>
<p>'Sh! We must be patient with him. He is very dull of
understanding, poor man. He does not even perceive that the gold he
was to have paid me for betraying Ravenna is now to be paid to me
as his own ransom. It would be a poor compliment to him to set his
value at less. Indeed, when he comes to think of it calmly, his
vanity may be wounded by my moderation.' Then he turned again
directly to address the procurator. 'Understand me clearly, Messer
Gritti. You are not to suppose that you can escape punishment for
your offence against me. Either I hang you in the Lord of Ravenna's
name, or I fine you in my own. Regard it that way. You may ransom
yourself, or the Most Serene may ransom you, by the payment of this
bond. It goes to Venice now together with these letters setting
forth in detail the events, and making quite clear your own
responsibility for them.</p>
<p>'My messenger for this occasion shall be Messer Annibale
Belluomo, whom I set at liberty to that end. Thus I discharge at
the same time a duty by a brother soldier. For these letters should
serve to ransom Messer Belluomo's reputation, justly at the expense
of your own.'</p>
<p>Abruptly he waved a hand to the guards. 'Remove your prisoner,
and take the halter from the neck of Messer Belluomo.'</p>
<p>One of the soldiers touched Messer Gritti's arm. But he did not
immediately turn. He stood shaking from head to foot, his eyes
blood-injected and baleful as they glared at Colombino. He mouthed
a moment before he could find words.</p>
<p>'You brigand! You vile, treacherous brigand! Don't think that
you'll sit long in the saddle, you upstart son of a felon! I shall
yet live to see you in the dust where you belong.'</p>
<p>Caliente bawled an order. 'Take that chattering crow away
quickly, or&mdash;God forgive me&mdash;I may forget that he's a
prisoner.' And he stalked after them, hastening them with his fury
as they hustled the Venetian out.</p>
<p>Belluomo watched the procurator's departure with the suspicion
of a smile. Unenviable as was his own position, yet his uppermost
feeling at that moment was that Colombino had effectively avenged
him upon a man at the hands of whose self-sufficiency he had
suffered so much.</p>
<p>Next morning with the letters and an escort of a score of his
own men, generously set at liberty for the purpose by Colombino, he
set out for Venice.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-03" id="ch-03"></a>Chapter 3. THE LADY OF
RAVENNA</h2>
<h3>&mdash; i &mdash;</h3>
<p>There exists a letter from Colombino da Siena to the Lord
Onorato da Polenta, beginning Veni, vidi, vici.'</p>
<p>It was penned on the day after the rout of Ravenna's besiegers,
and was borne to Milan by Messer Cosimo da Polenta, the Lord
Onorato's cousin, the tall ecclesiastic who had been present when
Colombino dealt with Messer Gritti.</p>
<p>If Colombino chose his model for that sentence too recklessly
for exactitude, yet the overstatement is pardonable in view of the
elation in which he wrote. And for the moment it was at least more
or less applicable to the army that Venice had put into the field.
Between Civitella and Ravenna that had most certainly and
completely been destroyed, and destroyed almost at sight by a
commander disposing of less than half the original Venetian
force.</p>
<p>Colombino's repute, which already had stood high, soared now to
altitudes that not even the great Colleoni had reached. The valour
he had displayed and still more the craft, so dear to the Italian
mind, brought him such fame that his name was being mentioned with
awe in the courts of Italy as that of a military wonder-worker. Of
this he beheld the reflection in the Lord Onorato's manner towards
him and in the deference paid him by the ambassadors of the powers,
who hastened presently to Ravenna to felicitate Onorato upon his
restoration.</p>
<p>These things, however, did not befall until a fortnight after
the victory.</p>
<p>In the meantime the gold for Francesco Gritti's ransom had
arrived from Venice, sent, not, indeed, by the State, but by the
family of Gritti, which was amongst the wealthiest of the Republic
and had taken the view that duty demanded no less. Messer Gritti
had departed humiliated and fuming, swearing that he would yet have
real value for the gold and that Colombo da Siena should rue the
day when he had mocked him and so unconscionably mulcted him.</p>
<p>The increase of wealth which this gold represented permitted him
to enrol in the Company of the Dove five hundred of the mercenaries
captured from Venice.</p>
<p>It was not for Venice to make a grievance of this. It is true
that it was the Italian custom to release all mercenaries at the
end of an engagement. But it was a custom that, like a good many
others, Colombino disregarded, to the disgust of contemporary
captains of fortune. And it was a custom of which Venice herself
had never approved when to ignore it had been to the disadvantage
of her enemies. The Most Serene Republic, therefore, could hardly
now complain if Colombino ignored it to her own.</p>
<p>By this further strengthening of his forces, Colombino lessened
the chances that Venice would make any attempt at present to
reconquer Ravenna. The Turks at the time were giving her a good
deal of trouble in her overseas dominions, and claiming all the
resources she could spare, weakened as she was by the long-drawn
war with Milan.</p>
<p>Ultimately, however, there would probably come a day of
reckoning unless by the display of force the Lord Onorato could
avert it. For it was true then, as it always has been and always
will be true, that to ensure peace you must be prepared for war. Of
this the Lord Onorato was well aware. He remembered Colombino's
admonition at the outset that to seize Ravenna would not be
difficult, but to hold it would be quite another matter, and he
still trusted to the faith he had expressed when he had answered
that the example of Ravenna would be followed by other states under
the Venetian yoke, amongst which a league could be formed against
the predatory Republic.</p>
<p>When, however, the festivities, the banquetings, the joustings,
and the stage-plays with which his restoration was celebrated had
come to an end, and the Lord Onorato had leisure to scan the
horizon, he beheld there no sign of the clouds upon which he had so
confidently counted.</p>
<p>The people of Ravenna were loyal to him; they had not been
comfortable under Venetian rule. Venetians had filled all the
public offices, and Venice had controlled to her own advantage
Ravenna's industries and trade. Therefore Ravenna had welcomed the
restoration of the Polentas, and it could be depended upon to form
a militia to maintain it. But the past had shown how inadequate
that would be against the might of Venice, with her professional
soldiers.</p>
<p>Although six weeks were sped since the home-coming of Onorato
and his handsome daughter, Colombino had as yet shown no sign of
determining his engagement. He still occupied himself with matters
of fortification and military administration, as if he were to
remain indefinitely in command. His captains had withdrawn to
quarters in the citadel; but Colombino himself continued at the
Casa Polentana, and was daily at the Lord Onorato's table, as much
one of the family as Samaritana or Messer Cosimo, and very friendly
with them both.</p>
<p>In Samaritana, whose voice he heard for the first time when she
came to Ravenna, he found no affectations of reticence. She was as
frank and at ease in her speech with him as became a maid of her
station, and if the wistfulness he had first observed still hung
like a veil about her, yet at times she displayed a gracious
liveliness and could spice her utterances with wit.</p>
<p>Watching her as she moved with her slim, leisurely grace,
Colombino found himself admiring her, found himself taking pleasure
in the contemplation of her, and giving thanks that since she was
the ladder by which he was to climb she should be as good to look
upon as he now found her.</p>
<p>Love, he assured himself, had no part in this. Love, he would
have told you in those days, was a paltry mirage on which men
wrecked themselves. His aims being what they were, he thanked God
that she was not humpbacked. That was all. She counted in his
schemes for no more than she mattered to them.</p>
<p>If at moments his conscience pricked him, if an inner voice
assured him that this was unworthy, a calculating outrage upon
knightliness, he would harden himself again in the recollection of
the treatment he had received at the hands of Madonna Eufemia, and
in the persuasion that all women being alike the only wisdom for a
man lay in using them for his ends, leaving sentiment to poets and
other idle dreamers.</p>
<p>Colombino, who could conduct negotiations with a strategy
scarcely inferior to that which he displayed in the field, made no
move until he perceived signs of the Lord Onorato's apprehensions
that he would be left by the other small states of the Venetian
Empire to stand alone. Then on a day of early August, when the Lord
of Ravenna had ridden over to the great citadel to view the works
of fortification by which Colombino claimed to have improved it,
the Captain broached the matter.</p>
<p>'My task here is at an end, my lord. Indeed, in the matter of
these works, it has been carried further than was in the bond. I
have restored you to Ravenna, which was my undertaking, and I
recognize that the time has come when you would wish to dismiss
me.'</p>
<p>They were walking upon the ramparts, whence the view extended
over miles of the flat lands towards Commachio in the north, now
lying under a quivering haze drawn from the marshes by the heat.
The Lord Onorato abruptly checked in his step, and so brought them
to a standstill. Prepared though he had been for this, yet his
dismay was plain.</p>
<p>'Wish to dismiss you? That is not a happy word.' He sighed. 'It
is the last thing we could wish, Ser Colombino. If you go, you
remove the shield that guards us. I have thought of this.'</p>
<p>'That problem was present from the outset, as you'll remember
that I told you in Siena. But it is your problem, my lord.'</p>
<p>'Yes, yes. I have considered it. A solution has occurred to me.
At present Venice has her hands full, and a moderate display of
force should suffice to moderate her predatory temper. If you were
to accept from me an annual retainer to serve me in my need and we
were to publish this engagement, that should be enough just now to
keep Venice quiet.' He paused, and added, in some hesitation, 'I
had thought of some ten thousand ducats yearly, the rate of pay for
actual service to be determined when the need for it arises, if it
should.' Again he paused before asking, 'What should you say to
that, Ser Colombino?'</p>
<p>'That as a retainer it is generous.' But his tone was
discouragingly formal, and the lip he made was dubious. 'I will put
it to my captains.' And he changed the subject instantly, to point
out the advantages of a ravelin which he had thrown out beyond the
ditch so as to protect the bastion on which they were standing.</p>
<p>If he put the matter to his captains as he promised, he forgot
to report their answer, nor mentioned the subject further so that
it was left for the Lord Onorato to bring it up again some days
later, asking him if he had considered.</p>
<p>Again Colombino made that dubious lip, and again he dismissed
the question casually with a promise to think about it, whence the
old despot might infer that it was of little interest to him.</p>
<p>Onorato became anxious. He pressed Colombino for an answer on
the morrow. Again Colombino demurred. He showed himself
troubled.</p>
<p>'I am in a difficulty, my lord. The desire to serve you, the
love I bear you, is in conflict with the love I bear myself. This
retainer might prove an obstacle to greater enterprises. That, too,
is the feeling of my captains. But I'll consider further.' As
before, his tone left little hope that he would consider
favourably.</p>
<p>And then from the great world outside came rumours that were of
assistance to Colombino. Sauntering one morning with Onorato in the
gardens of the Casa Polentana, he alluded to them. War clouds were
gathering in the south. There should be work there for the Company
of the Dove as soon as Colombino let it be known that his sword was
in the market. It became necessary, therefore, more precisely to
consider his departure.</p>
<p>Thus did he deliver at last his answer to the proposals Onorato
had made him; an answer that ignored them and plunged the little
despot into consternation. Limp from this the old man sank to a
marble seat set in the bay of a yew hedge that was solid as a wall.
He nodded gloomily.</p>
<p>'Your sword is in the market, eh? And, of course, I have not the
means to bid for it. I am to conclude, then, that you will think no
more of the retainer I proposed?' There was a shade of bitterness,
as if of reproach, mingling with the regret in his voice.</p>
<p>Colombino, standing so straight and tall above that frail seated
figure, fetched a sigh.</p>
<p>'Should you do so in my place, my lord?'</p>
<p>'Perhaps not. Perhaps not. I do not complain, sir. You have
served me very well. But if you withdraw yourself thus completely,
all that you have done may prove vain in the end, and Venice may
soon be free to avenge herself upon me.' His hatred of Venice rang
in his voice, was evinced in the hand he clenched upon his cane as
he stabbed the ground with it.</p>
<p>Colombino spoke very gently 'Because I am aware of it, I have
postponed decision, reluctant to make the only decision possible to
a man of ambitions. And I have ambitions, my lord, as you would
have did you stand in my shoes today. The power to lead I have
already shown, and of my power to govern I am no less confident. Do
you see, my lord, whither my ambitions lead me? Francesco Sforza,
who is Duke of Milan, was less than I am in his beginnings. I may
not aspire quite so high. But neither am I modest.'</p>
<p>If this should not suffice, Colombino was prepared to be more
blunt. Meanwhile, however, it might plant a thought in the mind of
the Lord of Ravenna, and the soldier waited with a calm that was
entirely simulated.</p>
<p>Onorato was peering up at him, a frown between his grizzled
brows. It was a long moment before he spoke, and by then a flush
had crept to his cheek-bones and a glitter to his old eyes,
betokening the excitement astir in him. And then at last the
question came which told Colombino how his suggestion had taken
root.</p>
<p>'Would the lordship of Ravenna satisfy your ambition?'</p>
<p>'The lordship of Ravenna?'</p>
<p>The old man poured out his mind. 'When I am gone, if Venice
waits so long, she will claim Ravenna on the grounds that I have no
male successor. It was with that possibility in view that my son
was murdered by her agency. Do you think that I can die in peace
whilst there is a chance that Venice may profit by that infamy?
There are no means I will not take to frustrate such a
consummation. That is why I ask you, who are the man to hold this
lordship and perhaps even to increase it, whether to be Lord of
Ravenna would satisfy your ambition. Whether you would consider the
prospect of succeeding me a sufficient retainer in the
meantime.'</p>
<p>Colombino affected not yet to understand. 'But upon what grounds
would my right to this succession be established?'</p>
<p>'By marriage with Samaritana. Thus you would secure her future
with your own.'</p>
<p>In Colombino's heart there was sudden laughter. The fruit had
fallen into his lap before he had troubled seriously to shake the
tree. But his rugged countenance was grave to solemnity. He
remained so long in thought that the Lord of Ravenna, who was a
Lucifer for pride, aroused him testily.</p>
<p>'Well? Does even that need reflection with your potency?'</p>
<p>'Oh, my lord! You'll realize that I am a little overwhelmed.' He
laughed shortly 'I am conscious of no merit in myself to command
this honour. If you have well considered, and provided that the
Lady Samaritana shares your views, there can be but one answer. I
make solemn oath that I shall study to deserve so great a
prize.'</p>
<p>The Lord Onorato breathed relief. Leaning heavily on his stick
he heaved himself up. 'That is well. We will count it settled,
then. I shall inform Samaritana at once.'</p>
<p>This was to move at speed, indeed. Could it possibly be that he
had already taken her feeling in the matter? Incredulously
Colombino asked the question.</p>
<p>'I have had no thought to take it.' The old despot's tone
implied that he admitted no right of hers to any feeling in
conflict with his wishes. Then his dark old eyes played over that
tall, virile figure, and a little smile tightened his thin lips as
he thought in his heart that she would be difficult to please if
her feelings were other than of satisfaction. He continued to look
at Colombino and his glance deepened in kindliness. He reached up
his left hand and set it on the young captain's shoulder. It was a
gesture of affection. 'I tell you, child, this solution of my
difficulties is one in which I take joy. I could not have found a
happier one.'</p>
<p>And Colombino, deeply touched, a little shamed even as he
thought of the guile employed to bring Onorato to take him for his
son-in-law, bowed his head.</p>
<p>'Sir,' he answered solemnly, 'I vow that it shall be my
endeavour to keep you of that opinion.'</p>
<p>The old man patted his shoulder. 'I know you will, and I trust
that for you, too, there is happiness in this. Samaritana is a good
girl: docile and yet no fool.'</p>
<p>It was an opinion he was to change within the hour. For a shock
awaited the Lord Onorato at his daughter's hands.</p>
<p>He sought her at once in the bower she had made her own, a
chamber hung in blue and grey, delicate as her own person in its
furnishings of ebony with ivory inlay and painted coffers, and
fragrant now with the late roses clustered in a silver bowl. He
found her there with her woman-in-waiting, Monica, the sister of
the castellan of Ravenna, and he did not even trouble to be private
with her so as to communicate tidings of which the town would
presently he free.</p>
<p>She heard him with a face of panic, from which all the blood
receded whilst he talked, and in the background the listening
Monica, a matronly woman in her fortieth year, had turned almost as
pale.</p>
<p>'Why, what's this? What ails you?' cried Onorato at the end, by
when her disorder was no longer to be overlooked.</p>
<p>She sat, stiff and straight, clutching the arms of her tall
chair.</p>
<p>'It grieves me that...that I cannot do this, since it is your
wish. But I cannot. I cannot even consider such a marriage.'</p>
<p>Onorato looked at her between anger and amusement.</p>
<p>'Not consider it? By the Blessed Mother! You're not asked to
consider it. You're asked to perform it. That's all. And count
yourself fortunate. Colombino is a man whom most women would be
glad to take to husband. Ha!'</p>
<p>'It happens that I am not one of those women.' She gathered
strength from the tyranny of his attitude. 'I look for something
better in a husband than a swashbuckling adventurer, a man who
takes the name of the city of his birth because he cannot name his
father.'</p>
<p>'Prattle!' said the Lord of Ravenna, in relief. 'If that's your
reason you're in a mistake let me tell you. Colombino doesn't want
for a father or a name. For the rest, if you seek something better
in a husband, you're likely to waste your life in seeking.'</p>
<p>'I should prefer that.'</p>
<p>'No doubt, being a fool. But I have my preferences, too, and I
know what's to your advantage. One of these days you'll realize how
fortunate that is. So we'll say no more about it.'</p>
<p>Ruffled, he was already turning away, when she checked him.</p>
<p>'I am, I suppose, one of God's creatures with a soul of my own,
even if I am your daughter.'</p>
<p>'Oh, admitted. This marriage will help you to save that same
soul.'</p>
<p>'It will not.' She rose, and for all her pallor she stood as
straight and firm as a lance. 'No loveless marriage ever
accomplished that.'</p>
<p>'Tcha! Loveless marriage! Loveless balderdash! Get you married,
girl, and the love will follow You need a man here; or you will
when I am gone. A man, do you understand? So that your heritage may
not fall into the hands of Venice. Without Colombino at your side
you wouldn't hold Ravenna for a week, ninny. Now perhaps you
understand. So no more of this.'</p>
<p>Again he turned to go, accounting the last word spoken. But
again she detained him.</p>
<p>'Oh, but there is more.' She was fluttering a little, and as she
spoke, Monica from the background made a movement as if to come to
her. 'My faith is already pledged, and I will not be false to that.
Nothing shall ever make me.'</p>
<p>He came back slowly from the door which he had almost reached,
his eyes fixed upon her. Monica moved as if to bar his way. He
waved her back. He spoke with ominous quiet. 'What are you telling
me?'</p>
<p>With what calm she could command she answered him, confessing
that there was one in Crete to whom she had secretly plighted her
troth when they were on the point of breaking their exile
there.</p>
<p>His eyes grew baleful as he listened. 'High time I had you
safely in wedlock, my girl! What are you? Some scullion's daughter
to bestow yourself; and secretly? Why secretly? Was there cause for
shame? Who is this Cretan lover, in God's name?'</p>
<p>She gulped before she answered him. 'Ottavio Moro,' and added
quickly 'Now you will understand the secrecy.'</p>
<p>He showed her a face of horror. 'Moro! The Doge's nephew? The
Republic's Procurator in Crete?' He caught her wrist in a grip of
fury, pulled her to him, and thrust her off again. 'By all the
fiends of Hell! Have I a daughter so monstrous, so lost to pride
that she pledges herself to one who is of the blood of my worst
enemy? Is it nothing to you that the Mori dispossessed your father,
that they murdered your brother? Do you dare to stand before me
with that white insolence and tell me that this Moro dog is your
lover? Blood of God!' He stepped back from her, raving. He handled
his cane as if he would strike her with it.</p>
<p>Monica was suddenly at his side clutching his arm. 'My lord! My
lord!'</p>
<p>He flung her off, his anger lending strength to his shrunken
frame. 'Will you cackle at me? Hold your infernal tongue!' He
smashed his cane down in fury upon an ebony table. 'Oh, God! The
shame of it! I have for daughter a wanton baggage who runs to the
arms of the first fortune-hunter who beckons her, and this a man of
a house that is smeared with the blood of mine! Don't you see,
fool, the ends this rascal served? Your brother, the heir to
Ravenna, murdered, the way is clear for him to the lordship of
Ravenna by marrying you. Thus, in one way or another, Venice is to
prevail here.'</p>
<p>'All that is false, false!' she interrupted, and would have
added more but that he afforded her no opportunity.</p>
<p>'Listen to me, unnatural girl! I'll see you wed to a Moor of
Africa rather than to a Moor of Venice.* So dismiss the thought for
all time, and pray God to forgive you for it. As for me, if you
would deserve my forgiveness in time, never let me hear of this
again. Never! You have supplied an added reason why your nuptials
with Colombino should be hastened.' He swung round, and stamped to
the door. On the threshold he turned, still trembling in his
passion. 'See to it that we never hear of this again,' he repeated,
in menace, and went abruptly out.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Polenta's bitter pun will be clear to
readers with a knowledge of Italian; <i>'Ti vedr sposa d'un moro
d' Africa pitosto the d'un Moro di Venezia.'</i>]</p>
<p>With a little moan the slender, supple body sank down into the
chair, and she found Monica's arms about her, and Monica's crooning
voice in her ear.</p>
<p>'Comfort you, child. Comfort you. Messer Colombino will never
constrain you against your will. He is noble and chivalrous. I
would that it were he you loved.'</p>
<p>'That can never be,' said the defiant Samaritana. 'Nor will I
ever marry him. Never. I may be as unnatural as my father says.
What do I know of these feuds? Ottavio's hands are clean of our
blood whatever his kinsmen may have done. I will wait for him, or I
will die a maid. I care not.'</p>
<p>Presently came her kinsman Cosimo, sent by her father whose
horror he shared upon learning of Samaritana's dreadful
entanglement. She was fond of this courtly young priest, and
because of her affection for him, and also because he was smooth
and calm in his remonstrances, she listened to him patiently. But
in the end he, too, grew heated by what he called her obstinacy in
error. He found himself insisting in vain upon the feud between her
house and the Mon who had so terribly wronged it, and the
advantages to Ravenna of her union with Colombino, a great soldier
who would know how to preserve her domain and hold at bay the might
of Venice. Before the unnatural indifference to matters of sacred
duty begotten in her by her ill-starred passion for Ottavio Moro,
Cosimo departed in despair.</p>
<p>But the Lord Onorato had recovered his calm by the time Cosimo
returned to him with his tale of failure. The old man had whittled
down to grimness the fury that had earlier possessed him.</p>
<p>It matters not a finger-snap what her inclinations may be. I was
a fool to use so many words with her. She knows what is to do. It
will be for Colombino to make her like it.'</p>
<h3>&mdash; ii &mdash;</h3>
<p>From his window on the following morning, Colombino beheld
Madonna Samaritana walking alone in the garden. It occurred to him
that the setting was a pleasant one for the little comedy he had to
play, and upon that he went forth.</p>
<p>Neither Onorato nor Cosimo had given him a hint that the lady
was not proving as docile as her father had pronounced her.</p>
<p>He came up with her in a little enclosed garden where a
lily-pond was hedged about with yew. In green with trailing
draperies, a white veil covering the dark hair above her pallid
face, so straight and tall and slender, she looked, herself,
something like a lily to him in the morning sunlight.</p>
<p>At the sound of his footstep she looked over her shoulder, and
her eyes widened a little when she saw who came. He bowed low.</p>
<p>'I find you happily, my Samaritana,' said he. 'I come to vow
that my life shall be spent in deserving the honour and the joy of
which I cannot pretend that I am yet worthy.'</p>
<p>Smiling into her startled eyes, he took her hand, and he was
bearing it to his lips when it was gently withdrawn. Adopting the
advice that Monica had given her, she had been schooling herself in
what to do when this moment came. There was a stone seat before the
pond set in the shade of a yew. She moved towards it.</p>
<p>'Shall we sit, Ser Colombino? I have something to tell you.' And
when, nowise discomposed by her gravity, he had taken beside her
the seat to which he was bidden, she looked at him fully with eyes
of timid candour. 'May I be frank with you, Ser Colombino?'</p>
<p>'It is what I should most desire. Now and always.'</p>
<p>'And you will be patient with me? Patient and gentle?'</p>
<p>'I hope that I could never be other.'</p>
<p>'You will not account it an offence against you if I say that I
do not love you?'</p>
<p>'I should account it a miracle if you did. That is something
that I must yet deserve and earn.'</p>
<p>She shook her head. The wistfulness that haunted her eyes was
deepened. 'You are foredoomed in your endeavours, sir.'</p>
<p>The smile that lent a beauty to his rugged face was now
displayed. 'It has been said of endeavours of mine before, and I
have proved the prophecy a false one. Yet to no past endeavour have
I brought the fervour I shall bring to this. Therefore, I am
confident.'</p>
<p>'Ser Colombino, you must understand me. I can have no love to
give you.'</p>
<p>Her cold firmness banished his smile. He became grave. Before
the searching gaze of his dark eyes, she lowered her own.</p>
<p>'You are very young, Samaritana. You are aware only of what you
are; not of what you may become. Speak to the present, if you will.
But do not speak to the future, which I shall hope to have some
hand in shaping. I bring you service and devotion: such service and
devotion as cannot leave you indefinitely indifferent to me. Do
not, then, distress yourself at what you perceive upon the
threshold. Beyond it I shall see that happiness is spread for you.
It is to tell you this that I have sought you now, to vow that I
shall live with no other aim in view.'</p>
<p>For a space of silence her hands worked nervously in her lap. At
last very softly and on a note of intercession she answered
him.</p>
<p>'If my happiness were sincerely your aim, you would withdraw at
once from a suit that is rendering me desperately unhappy' And now
her eyes were raised to his again, as she half-turned towards him.
'I implore it of your chivalry, Ser Colombino. I beg it of your
generosity' To the intercession in her eyes and voice was added the
intercession of the long, slender hands she held out to him.</p>
<p>He was troubled, as his countenance showed. It is even possible
that he was a little wounded in his vanity. He sighed as he looked
at her.</p>
<p>'Give me a little time to win your favour. I am so confident of
winning it, meaning you well as I do.' He rose. 'I will leave you
now. You are still startled by the suddenness of the matter. It is
not a moment in which to be importunate. Indeed, I hope that you
may never find me that.'</p>
<p>'Wait!' She, too, had risen. 'You do not yet understand. It is
that my love is already given; that I am pledged; and that neither
honour nor affection would suffer me to break that pledge.'</p>
<p>'Pledged? But how is that possible when your father...' She
broke in, and forth came the whole tale of that lover in Crete. He
frowned as he listened.</p>
<p>'A Venetian, and of the House of Moro! Lord, child, had you
raked the world through you could hardly have found a lover more
likely to be denied you. No wonder that you have kept the matter
secret.' He came close to her, and set a hand upon her shoulder.
'Child, most of this world's unhappiness springs from reluctance to
accept the inevitable with resignation. Do not you be the victim of
that. I counsel it in all affection. Put this impossible lover from
your thoughts, before your spirit is broken between your yearnings
and your father's bitter opposition. I do not plead for myself when
I urge this; but for you.' He went on at some length in that
strain, and came even to speak of her duty to Ravenna, and of her
assured enjoyment of her heritage with himself at her side to guard
it for her.</p>
<p>They were words of mere worldly wisdom and they fell upon the
rocky soil of obstinate passion, where they could find no
root-hold. Because he showed himself gentle and considerate, she
preferred to set her hopes upon the chivalry of which these were
evidences. But if she drew at the moment comfort from his
consideration, soon this very consideration was to drive her to
despair. For as his wooing began, so did it proceed: patient,
unobtrusive, gentle, and understanding, but under all this with the
insistent assumption that her mood was one that presently must
change, that reason must prevail with her.</p>
<p>Maddened by this, and since he merely met gentleness of
repulsion with stouter gentleness of insistence, she became more
plain-spoken, lost patience, abused him, and roundly declared him
odious. He treated her anger as the anger of a child, let her abuse
pass him by, and so drove her to the verge of secret frenzy.</p>
<p>But it was not secret enough. If her father was permitted to see
no signs of it and allowed to deceive himself with the belief that,
however reluctant, at least she had bowed to his will, Monica, who
knew all the truth, could not keep a still tongue. The news of
Samaritana da Polenta's betrothal to Colombino da Siena, which from
palace and citadel had flowed into the city and from the city in
ever-widening circles over the countryside, was followed now by a
rumour that the lady was being forced into unwilling wedlock and
breaking her heart for a lover left in Crete.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in an air of sullenness and mistrust the preparations
for the marriage went steadily forward. August was out and they
were within a fortnight of the date appointed for the nuptials,
when one noontide Monica brought a sealed note to her young
mistress.</p>
<p>'It was slipped into my hand as I was leaving San Vitale after
Mass.'</p>
<p>Samaritana turned the oblong letter in her hands, inspecting the
plain seal. By whom?'</p>
<p>'By a fat clown who bade me give it to you secretly, swearing
that it was something for your service.'</p>
<p>Samaritana broke the seal, and read:</p>
<p class="letter">If you would be rescued from the damnation that
awaits you in a loveless marriage come to me between the
twenty-first and the twenty-second hour today or tomorrow, in the
borgo, at the third house on the right beyond San Francesco, and
ask for Monna Caterina.</p>
<p>Beyond that it bore no signature.</p>
<p>Samaritana stood considering. It was odd. It might even be
dangerous. But she was by nature as brave as by circumstances she
was desperate.</p>
<p>Opportunity could easily be made, because it was her frequent
custom to visit the sick in the borgo. And so upon a pretended
errand of mercy, cloaked and hooded and with Monica to attend her,
she set out late that afternoon, and on the very stroke of the
twenty-first hour was at that third house beyond San Francesco.</p>
<p>Whilst Monica remained below, Samaritana was led by the man who
opened to them to a gloomy tapestried chamber above-stairs, where a
woman, young, golden-headed, and pallidly lovely, rose to receive
her; a child she seemed, small and slight, all innocence and
candour, disarming apprehension and bringing at once relief to the
agitation in which Samaritana had reached her presence.</p>
<p>She received the daughter of the Lord of Ravenna with easy
assumptions of equality; took her by the hand, and led her to a
chair.</p>
<p>'Dear madonna, assure yourself that in me you have a friend; the
friend in need whom they say is the best of all. More. You have one
who is in your own sad plight, and who by helping you will help
herself.'</p>
<p>Samaritana loosed her cloak, and waited with quiet dignity to
hear more.</p>
<p>What she heard was a moving tale of this slight, lovely child's
hopeless passion for Colombino. She was, she announced, Eufemia de'
Santi, the dispossessed Countess of Rovieto, and once, not so long
ago, she and Colombino, who at the time had been her captain, were
affianced in marriage.</p>
<p>'But there was bitter misunderstanding,' she lamented, 'the work
of treacherous men, who sowed mistrust between us. This not only
wrecked my happiness, but was the cause of my subsequent ruin. For
Colombino, lending an ear to lies and misconstruing what he saw,
went off in dudgeon and left me to my fate at the hands of my
enemies. You may have heard the tale.'</p>
<p>Samaritana shook her head, her eyes glowing now with interest,
and the Countess resumed.</p>
<p>'No matter. The details are of no consequence. What signifies
now is that I have come to Ravenna so that I may serve you, and so
that in return you may serve me.'</p>
<p>'I see. I see.' Samaritana was eager. 'I am to make your peace
with him; bring you together once more.'</p>
<p>Just that. I offer you the means to deliver you from a
bridegroom whom all the world knows to be distasteful to you, so
that in return you may restore to me the lover I have lost. I am
quite frank with you.' There was a plaintive helplessness in her
smile. 'I should not know how to be other. But for my lack of guile
I should not be where I now am.'</p>
<p>To Samaritana it did not seem that this lack of guile required
to be protested. It was so manifest in the candid eyes raised from
that fair little face to the proud, cold countenance of the Lady of
Ravenna. And the Lady of Ravenna abated now something of her normal
pride in her eagerness to learn precisely how she was to employ the
knowledge gained.</p>
<p>The little white-and-gold Countess took from her scrip a tiny
phial filled with a liquid as colourless as water.</p>
<p>'Here,' she said, 'is a magical water of very singular power. It
will turn the affections of him who drinks in any direction in
which they are desired, and away from any who does not desire
them.'</p>
<p>Samaritana's dark eyes grew wide in awe as she gazed at the
phial and from the phial to the Countess. And it was awe scarcely
tinged by incredulity. For, after all, there was nothing here to
strain belief. The existence of magical philtres endowed with the
oddest powers was a fact notorious in Italy, and from her cradle
she had heard common talk of such things, although never until now
had she gazed on one.</p>
<p>Yet mechanically she asked: 'How can that be?'</p>
<p>'Ah! That, madonna, I cannot answer. That is among the many
secrets of life that we do not understand. All that I know, and
this I know positively, is that it will do as I have said. How it
does it...' she smiled a little, and shrugged. 'If I knew that I
should be more than humanly wise.'</p>
<p>She rose, and crossed to Samaritana, proffering the phial. 'Take
it, and so help us both to our desires. If you could pour it, or
the half of it&mdash;even less would be sufficient&mdash;into his
wine, I make oath by my soul's salvation that there will be an end
to his importunities. He will never speak to you of love
again.'</p>
<p>She pressed the phial into Samaritana's still half-reluctant
hand.</p>
<p>'It...it will do him no injury?'</p>
<p>Pale innocence opened wide the eyes of the Countess; her red
lips parted in a vague smile.</p>
<p>'Unless I were sure, very sure, that it will not, should I ask
you to give this philtre to the man I love? Should I wish to injure
him since I am pining for love of him?</p>
<p>Samaritana nodded. 'That is true. Yes.'</p>
<p>'It will turn him from you. It will bring him to me. You should
not consider this an injury, being cold to him.'</p>
<p>Samaritana sat thoughtful, frowning at the little vessel in her
palm. Of her thought, however, wedded to her hope, faith was now
born.</p>
<p>'I shall be very deeply in your debt,' she said, 'if this will
accomplish all you promise for it.'</p>
<p>The low lids of Madonna Eufemia veiled her eyes. 'I am
confident. But even if you are not, it is surely worth the attempt.
Nothing will have been lost by it. Much may have been gained.'</p>
<p>'Yes. That, too, is true.' said the bemused Samaritana.</p>
<p>'But there is a condition necessary to ensure success.'</p>
<p>'Ah!'</p>
<p>'After he has drunk, you must call me to his mind, so that I may
fondly abide there. You must say to him: "In that draught you are
pledged by Eufemia of Rovieto." You may even say, if you choose,
that the draught contains a potion I have sent him with my love.
That will suffice. If his thoughts turn to me as the philtre begins
to act, we may be doubly certain of the result we both desire.'</p>
<p>This had a specious, reasonable sound. It seemed to Samaritana
to supply just what had been lacking to complete her belief in the
potion. She nodded again.</p>
<p>'That I can well understand.'</p>
<p>'But,' the Countess warned, 'on no account be premature or you
ruin all. Say no word until he shall have drunk. You understand
that, too?'</p>
<p>'Oh, yes.' Samaritana rose. 'How to thank you...' she was
beginning, bringing at last some warmth into her voice.</p>
<p>Manna Eufemia interrupted her. 'You owe me nothing. Each here is
equally in the other's debt; for each of us but serves the other's
ends. You'll not forget my words for him: "That draught is a pledge
of Eufemia da Rovieto's love." You'll see how his eyes will light
when they are spoken.'</p>
<h3>&mdash; iii &mdash;</h3>
<p>It had become Ser Colombino's custom since his betrothal to pay
a visit each morning to Monna Samaritana in her bower, with Monica
ever in discreet attendance.</p>
<p>There for the better part of an hour, under cover of a cool
outward amiability, a battle of wills would be fought, an amatory
onset by the condottiero determined to prevail resisted by the lady
with all the determination of a garrison prepared to starve before
surrendering.</p>
<p>But on the morning after that secret visit of Samaritana's to
the borgo, Colombino at once perceived signs that the citadel weary
of resistances might at last be considering a capitulation.</p>
<p>On an ebony table that was inlaid with ivory figures stood a
dish of peaches, a jar of honey; a golden jug of wine, and some
delicate glasses from the Murano workshops. There was nothing
unusual here. Samaritana was fond of peaches sliced into a mixture
of wine and honey, and would commonly engage herself upon some such
collation, as if pointedly to beguile the tedium caused her by
Colombino's presence. What was unusual this morning was that she
should so far depart from her normal chill aloofness as to offer
wine to her suitor. Almost it startled him. But this was merely the
first of the surprises awaiting him. There was a marked change in
her bearing. If this could not yet be described as warm, at least
it was less cold by many degrees than hitherto. Actually, for once,
it was she who led the conversation, where, normally, she followed
with lagging and reluctant step.</p>
<p>'We saw you riding in the city yesterday, Ser Colombino. How the
townsfolk worship you! I did not see one who did not smile as he
greeted you. It is not the least of your victory here that you
should have known how to endear yourself to the people.'</p>
<p>He displayed none of his astonishment. He fell willingly into
her mood. He smiled and sighed in one.</p>
<p>Just as without effort we may possess that which we do not
prize, so sometimes not all the effort of which we are capable will
suffice to command that which we desire.'</p>
<p>She stood straight and tall by the table to which she had
crossed in offering him the wine. Her glance brightened as she
looked at him. She even laughed, as she gently rallied him.</p>
<p>'That would seem to approach an admission I have never heard
from you before.'</p>
<p>He gave her a keen glance, and discovered signs of excitement.
The flush on her cheek, usually so pale, and the glitter in her
dark eyes almost suggested fever.</p>
<p>'It is my prayer that time and fortune may remove the occasion
for that admission.'</p>
<p>'Are your prayers heard, Ser Colombino?'</p>
<p>'When what I ask is good for my soul I must suppose they
are.'</p>
<p>She laughed for answer, as we laugh at an evasion, and as if
growing uncomfortable under his steady eyes, she turned, took up
the jug, and with her back to him, screening the action, she poured
the wine. As she turned again, he was beside her in a stride, to
take the fine glass she would have brought to him, in which the
wine glowed clear and golden as a topaz. Its colour drew a comment
from him.</p>
<p>'If I know wine at all, this comes from grapes that were sunned
on the Orvietan hills.'</p>
<p>'You prove your knowledge, indeed, and your quick judgment. This
is from Orvieto.'</p>
<p>He smiled. 'Had I not been a soldier I must have been a
husbandman. As it is, I am a little of both, and of the two, I
think that my vineyards at Montasco are closer to my heart even
than the Company of the Dove. Of late I have brought there some
vines from Orvieto, for to my taste there are none in Italy that
yield a better wine. And yet it is my ambitious hope that with care
I may still improve their yield in Tuscan soil.'</p>
<p>He took the glass from her as he spoke. In surrendering it her
hand trembled so that a little of the wine was spilled across their
fingers. To repair the damage, he set the glass down again upon the
table, and reached for a napkin. He wiped his fingers and then her
own. He delayed caressingly over the task, and for once, for the
first time since the commencement of his wooing, she did not shrink
under his touch. She stood, indeed, in a sort of helpless
fascination, suffering him to have his will. Perhaps it was this
unusual attitude that brought him to consider her again. Straight,
tall, slim, and supple she stood in her sheath of ruby silk, with a
linen gorget that sharply defined the long oval of her face. The
contemplation of her kindled a sudden warmth in his heart, a
pleasant consciousness that here was a prize worth winning for its
own sake, apart from the endowment of a lordship which she brought
him. So chaste and proud and noble did she seem to him in that
moment that she put to shame the callous, coldly calculating nature
of his suit. He stooped over the slim fingers that he held, and
very reverently pressed his lips upon them. This, too, she
tolerated; and not until his own fingers relaxed their grip did she
withdraw her hand. Subconsciously he observed that it was her left,
and that her right hung clenched and idle at her side.</p>
<p>She moved away from him, returning to her tall-backed chair in
the embrasure of the Gothic window, whilst he remained standing by
the table observing her slow grace with appraising eyes. Then with
a little sigh he slowly turned to take up the wine she had poured
for him.</p>
<p>The glass stood in a shaft of sunlight, otherwise he might have
been less quick to notice, even as he was about to put forth his
hand, that the colour of the wine had subtly changed during the
moments since it had been poured. The clear golden topaz upon which
he had commented was clouded now with a faint opalescence. It was
so slight that it might well have gone unnoticed by any man less
studious of wine and any eyes less intimate with its varying
hues.</p>
<p>If his consciousness was startled, he gave no sign of it. With a
sudden terrible suspicion in his mind, a tightening at his heart,
he completed after that moment's imperceptible pause the movement
of taking up the glass. He did not, however, yet raise it to his
lips. He merely moved it to the table's extreme edge, where he
could easily reach it from the chair which presently he resumed.
Without appearing to look, he saw that two pairs of
eyes&mdash;Samaritana's and Monica's&mdash;were watching him, and,
it seemed to him, with a furtive intentness. Monica, indeed, for
the first time since his entrance had raised her glance from the
frame of needlework which until this moment had absorbed her
attention.</p>
<p>He lounged in his chair, one leg clad in white thrown over the
other that was clad in red, apparently as easy in mind as in body,
whilst his wits were burrowing keenly.</p>
<p>Her unwonted graciousness this morning was now explained. It had
been assumed so as to throw him off his guard. She was, then, as
guileful as any other member of her faithless sex, and he a fool to
have harboured a momentary illusion that she might restore to him
his lost ideals.</p>
<p>That clenched right hand which he had observed to hang idle at
her side, until it furtively sought the scrip that hung from her
girdle of hammered gold, was now remembered and explained. It had
held a phial, whose contents had gone to trouble the wine. What was
it that she had poured for him? What should it be but poison?
Despairing of being delivered of his urbanely insistent wooing by
any other means, she had resolved upon his death. He was curiously
conscious of a sudden spasm of pity for her and of shame for an
insistence that had driven her to such lengths.</p>
<p>But, after all, he recognized that he was proceeding upon no
more than assumptions. They might be justified. Probably they were.
But he must have positive knowledge before he could determine upon
any action.</p>
<p>For some moments he talked idly of trivial matters, toying with
the tassels of the lacing at his breast, the very picture of a
care-free man, whilst he considered, and, at last, devised the test
that might reveal the truth.</p>
<p>He sat up abruptly, and broke gravely upon the light talk he had
provoked in her. 'Samaritana, there is something of great, and to
you&mdash;alas!&mdash;perhaps of welcome importance that I have to
say.'</p>
<p>Thus he riveted sharply her attention.</p>
<p>'If in my suit to you I have been persistent to the point of
arousing your resentment, it has been because of the strong hope
within me that in the end I should win you to a willing agreement.
Of late, to my deep sorrow, I have come to persuade myself that
this hope is vain. I see how steadfast is the love you have pledged
elsewhere. I account it as hopeless as is my own love for you. But
that is not my concern. What concerns me is that I should be
unworthy of the knighthood to which I aspire if I were to maintain
my insistence in the face of that.'</p>
<p>He paused, and his eyes over which he had cast a veil of
wistfulness observed her pallor and the tumult at her breast,
whilst Monica, scarcely less startled, sat now with needle entirely
idle.</p>
<p>'I have sought to order my life by ideals of chivalry that are
perhaps out of fashion. And chivalry forbids either that I should
continue to importune or that I should suffer you to be importuned
by others on my behalf. I owe it to you not only to withdraw, but
to do it in such a manner that no blame can attach to you. I do it
at great cost, because, Samaritana, you have come to stand so in my
life that my dreams have woven all my future about you. Perhaps it
is just because of this that I can no longer take from you what is
not freely given, nor suffer that you should be distressed.'</p>
<p>He uncrossed his legs, and stood up.</p>
<p>'You may trust me to make all easy for you. That will be an
amend for any heartache I may have brought you.'</p>
<p>She stared at him with troubled dilating eyes.</p>
<p>'I...I scarcely understand. My father...'</p>
<p>'Your father will not distress you. My course is very plain. At
the risk of giving deep offence, I shall tell the Lord Onorato that
I have changed my mind; that upon reflection I have come to see
that it is too early yet in my career to assume the burden of a
wife. I shall seek to turn aside his resentment. If I should fail
in that...' He shrugged resignedly 'Why, then, I must submit to his
anger. That is all.'</p>
<p>Dread was now stamped upon her bloodless face.</p>
<p>'I trust, Samaritana, to earn your approval, and so, at last, a
kindly thought from you.' He took up the glass, and with his eyes
upon her he very slowly raised it. 'I pledge your happiness with
the lover of your choice.'</p>
<p>He stood a moment as if awaiting some acknowledgment from her.
But she made no sound. She continued to stare at him with those
awed eyes, a faint writhing movement of her slim body and the
clutch of her bands upon the arms of her chair being further
evidences of her tension.</p>
<p>Very deliberately he bore the glass to his lips. As it reached
them, his nostrils keenly sniffing detected a faint bitter-sweet
odour reminiscent of crushed peach-kernels. Here was confirmation
of his every suspicion. Under the staring eyes of the women he
lowered the glass again an inch or two. Over the rim of it almost,
he addressed Samaritana, a queer smile twisting his lips as he
spoke.</p>
<p>'Must I still drink?'</p>
<p>She continued dumbly to regard him, as if the question froze
her. He laughed, and set down the glass once more. His manner now
was one entirely of bitter amusement.</p>
<p>'It occurred to me that by removing the necessity for my
assassination I might at the same time destroy the will to persist
in it. It seems that I was wrong. It seems, too, that you are more
foolish than I supposed; for my death would inconvenience you
infinitely more than my peaceful departure.'</p>
<p>'Your death?' She came to her feet as she spoke. Stridently she
repeated the question. 'Your death?'</p>
<p>'Was not that what you desired?'</p>
<p>'O God! How can you suppose it?'</p>
<p>'It seems a reasonable supposition when you put poison in my
wine.'</p>
<p>'Poison! That is false. I swear it. There is no poison in that
wine.'</p>
<p>'You swear it? By what do you swear it?'</p>
<p>'By my soul's salvation.'</p>
<p>'A potent oath. But women have been known to be forsworn. A
draught would persuade me better than an oath. There stands the
wine.' He waved her to it with the lightness he had assumed. 'Will
you drink, madonna?'</p>
<p>'If that will convince you,' she fiercely agreed, and swept to
the table, there suddenly to pause in horror as she remembered the
powers attributed to the philtre. Monica, too, had risen, and came
now waddling forward in alarm. But Colombino never heeded her. He
towered dominant before Samaritana, but his tone was still mild and
tinged with mockery.</p>
<p>'You hesitate? But why? What is there to affright you in this
innocent draught of Orvietan?' Then his tone hardened. 'I had hoped
to find you merciful at least. Such a foolish gull was I that when
I realized what you were attempting against me, I took the blame
upon myself. I had pressed you too hard with my wooing. To you the
prospect of marriage with me had become as a sanctioned rape, and
in your despair you availed yourself of the only weapon in your
reach. Thus in my feeble-mindedness I reasoned. To test it. I
announced my renunciation of you and my departure. But so deep has
your hatred grown, so bitter your vindictiveness, that not even
this can appease you, can bring you to stay your murderous
hand.'</p>
<p>She looked at him with eyes of pain and anger. Her breath was
coming in short gasps, her breasts convulsively rising and falling
within their ruby sheath.</p>
<p>'A test? It was a test? I understand. You are very cunning, sir.
All the world says so. Yet cunning will often lead a man too far
astray. There is no poison in that wine. I swear it yet again.'</p>
<p>'So I hear. But you will not drink it.'</p>
<p>'No. Because...Because...'</p>
<p>And forth now came the astounding truth in words that tumbled
over one another: that she had poured into the wine no more than a
philtre, whose purpose and properties she avowed, whilst saying,
however, no word of whence she had procured it.</p>
<p>'That,' she ended defiantly, 'is why I will not drink.'</p>
<p>He listened with raised brows and a faintly mocking air of
belief that of intent betrayed its own pretence.</p>
<p>'But you have supplied an added reason why you should. By what
you tell me the draught should bring you to love me, and loving me
you would find it easier to marry me.'</p>
<p>Her brow was dark with sullen anger. 'I see that you do not
believe.'</p>
<p>'But you can so easily convince me. Come, Samaritana. This
draught will transmute your hatred into love, your distaste into
desire. Therefore it encloses your life's happiness. Can you
hesitate?'</p>
<p>'You mocking devil! If I did not hate you before, I hate you now
I have told you all the truth, only to provoke your derision, only
to be held a liar. If you were not a base upstart, if you could
understand the minds of such as I, you would know that whilst I
might kill you to be quit of your odious pursuit, yet I should
never lie to you.'</p>
<p>'I have heard such words before. They are the jewelled robes in
which Falsehood hides her festering sores. But they shall be
stripped away, and your falsehood laid naked. Wait.' He took up the
wine and carried it with him to the door. There he raised his voice
to call, and presently came steps in answer to that summons. He was
heard issuing muttered orders. Then, as the steps retreated once
more, he came leisurely back, holding ever that glass of wine, and
crossed to his chair.</p>
<p>'If you will sit, madonna, I shall not keep you long.'</p>
<p>'What are you going to do?'</p>
<p>'I shall not test your patience,' was all he answered her, and
perforce content with that she sank wearily to her own chair,
whilst Monica went to stand protectingly over her, glaring ever and
anon at him.</p>
<p>Thus in silence they waited until presently two of Colombino's
own grooms came in, leading an old pale-coloured hound. He rose,
ordering one of them to hold the dog firmly and the other to force
apart its jaws. Down the struggling beast's throat Colombino poured
the half of the wine from the glass. The glass itself with the
remainder he flung through the open window, then stood watching the
uneasy hound.</p>
<p>Results followed swiftly, and very soon the poor writhing animal
lay still, at fullest stretch, with glazed eyes and a froth about
its parted jaws. Samaritana, who had risen, looked on in stark
horror, Monica's arms about her.</p>
<p>Colombino waved an imperious hand to the grooms. 'Take it away,
and bury it. Say no word to anyone of how it died.'</p>
<p>When they had departed, Colombino stood squarely before the
stricken Lady of Ravenna.</p>
<p>'Is it enough? You have seen the working of your love-philtre.
You have seen in what case I should have been if I had drunk the
wine you poured for me. And you pledged your soul's salvation that
it was not poisoned. Have you exhausted falsehood? Or can you think
of more to explain even this?'</p>
<p>Humbled, bruised by the lash of his scorn, horror-stricken at
the proof he had supplied, she answered only with a sob, and there
the matter might have ended for her had not Monica been moved to a
passionate outburst.</p>
<p>'She has told you no lies, sir, the gentle dove. You are a
scoundrel so to taunt her. What she told you, she believed. She was
tricked by that evil woman in the borgo, who gave her the philtre.
You will know, sir, what you have done to the Countess of Rovieto
that she should seek your life. But if you behaved to her as you
have behaved to my lady here, by my faith, she had good reason to
play the lying witch.'</p>
<p>'What's that? The Countess of Rovieto?' Colombino was suddenly a
changed man, alert and stern. 'Was it she supplied this poison? And
for me?'</p>
<p>'But not as a poison. Not as a poison. As a love-potion.' And
now the whole tale was poured forth by Monica, and at last taken up
and amplified by Samaritana.</p>
<p>And at the end of it she held out her hands to him in
supplication. 'You have all the truth now. Indeed, I have not
consciously lied to you by a single word.'</p>
<p>From her scrip she plucked a scrap of paper, and pressed it upon
him. It was the note she had yesterday received from the
Countess.</p>
<p>'Yes,' he said. 'It is the hand of that Jezebel. But it no
longer needed even this.'</p>
<p>'I believed her,' Samaritana was protesting passionately 'I take
the Holy Mother in Heaven to witness that I believed her. Messer
Colombino, I will make amends. I will prove my faith.'</p>
<p>'Prove it?' His brows were knit.</p>
<p>Vehement, distraught at the reflection of how near she had been
to doing murder, she answered him. 'All my life hereafter shall
give proof. I will be your willing and consenting wife. You shall
hear no more of resistance to your will. Thus...thus will I make
amends to you.'</p>
<p>So beaten down was her proud spirit by sheer horror of the thing
that unwittingly she had all but done that she fell on her knees
before him to implore forgiveness.</p>
<p>He stooped, set his strong hands at her elbows and drew up.
Still holding her he spoke. 'It needs no such proof. I have done
you wrong enough, and most wrong perhaps in my thoughts this
morning.' His tone became very gentle. 'When I marry I shall hope
to be a husband, not a penance; a lover, not a hair-shirt to a
woman's tender flesh. So quiet you. There is no further question of
our marriage. That is a dream dispelled. I take my leave, though in
any need, remember, I shall be ready to come to your call.'</p>
<p>His hands slid from her elbows to her wrists. Then he raised
them, kissed her fingers, and was gone, leaving her in a frozen
bewilderment.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-04" id="ch-04"></a>Chapter 4. THE LADY OF OTTAVIO
MORO</h2>
<h3>&mdash; i &mdash;</h3>
<p>Colombino did not see her again before departing from Ravenna.
He bore with him the sorrowfully ironical perception that he had
renounced her in the very moment in which his love for her was
born, and that it was this love which had dictated the
renunciation. He had in fact done the very thing that earlier, and
as a means of testing the extent of her intentions, he had
pretended to do. It was her offer of surrender as an amend that,
persuading him of her shining honesty, had aroused in him something
akin to worship and had made an end of that cynical spirit in which
for worldly ends he had aimed at marrying her. Thus, he reflected,
too, if that evil woman Eufemia de' Santi's crafty plot to murder
him had failed, at least it had dealt him a wound that would not
soon be healed.</p>
<p>Another in his place might have sought that house in the borgo
with intent to square the account. Colombino's mind was not even
crossed by the vindictive thought. Perhaps there was too much else
to occupy it. His interview with Onorato da Polenta alone was
enough to distract a man's wits for days.</p>
<p>He had found Cosimo with the Lord of Ravenna; but he was not
concerned to express in secret a matter that presently would be
common knowledge.</p>
<p>'My lord,' he had said, his manner very formal, 'there is likely
to be war in the Kingdom of Naples over the succession. My company
grows restless in this idleness at such a time, and my captains are
naturally anxious to be at work. May it not displease you that we
shall be marching south at once.'</p>
<p>The Lord Onorato could not believe his ears. They were in his
closet, the small room in which he transacted his affairs, and he
had been discussing with his nephew the matter of some repairs to
San Vitale, of which Cosimo was a canon. It was into this
atmosphere of peace that Colombino had cast his bombshell.</p>
<p>'You are marching south? What the devil do you mean, you are
marching south? Your wedding is within a fortnight.'</p>
<p>Colombino's countenance was grave to sadness. Slowly he shook
his tawny head. 'Alas! My lord, there will be no wedding.'</p>
<p>'No wedding?' Onorato came suddenly to his feet, pushing back
his chair, and Cosimo, echoing the question in consternation, rose
with him.</p>
<p>'I will enter into an agreement with you to be at your call upon
a retainer, which you may fix at what you will. But...'</p>
<p>'The devil take you and your retainers!' The little man was
livid. 'Of what do you tell me? We have gone a long way since there
was a question of retainers. Has that unnatural girl of mine
refused again? Does she set us at defiance? If so, I vow to
Heaven...'</p>
<p>'My lord,' cried Colombino, to check this rising fury and turn
it into other channels, 'only just now Madonna Samaritana was
protesting her willingness to become my wife.'</p>
<p>'But then...I don't understand.'</p>
<p>'It is just that reflection persuades me I should be doing my
interests an ill service to bind myself in wedlock at this stage.
The trade of arms to be properly pursued demands that a man shall
remain free of family cares. That is all, my lord.'</p>
<p>'All!' cried Cosimo.</p>
<p>But Onorato was snarling and incoherent for a moment. 'So! So!
Body of God! The Polentani are no longer worthy of your ambitious
lordship's alliance, eh? You aim higher, do you? And you wait until
a fortnight from the nuptials to discover it, then come here to
tell me with this cursedly prim indifference; to tell me that you
propose to put this shame upon my daughter and make my house a
laughingstock! It is to be said in Italy that an upstart captain of
fortune disdained the hand of Onorato da Polenta's child! Are you
dead to decency that you dare to stand before me and tell me that?
Or have I misunderstood you?'</p>
<p>And when he ceased, Cosimo took up the tale. 'You are, indeed,
your father's son, and you'll end on a gallows like that traitor
Terrarossa.' He swung to his uncle. 'I warned you, sir, that you
were dishonouring our house by this alliance, that you were
defiling your daughter by sending her to the arms of this
brigand.'</p>
<p>Colombino stood very straight and stiff. His face was grey, and
the austere squareness of its lines had become so marked that it
almost looked as if hewn of granite.</p>
<p>'Sir,' he cried out, 'you are a priest, and so I may not call
you to account and chastise you for your words. Remember it for
your honour's sake.'</p>
<p>'Honour!' raged Cosimo, his dark face aflame. 'Do you use that
word? If I am a priest I am also a man...'</p>
<p>'And so am I,' Colombino cut in, 'and being a man I am subject
to human weaknesses including that of anger. I'll go before it
masters me.</p>
<p>He strode to the door. But on the threshold paused. He looked
back at Onorato da Polenta, who had sunk into a chair, and sat
crumpled there, his head bowed, his hands between his knees. As
Colombino looked, the anger faded from his face, and only sorrow
remained. He had almost come to love this frail little Lord of
Ravenna whom he had restored to his dominions. And there was
something of heartbreak for him in this parting.</p>
<p>'My lord, it grieves me more than I could tell you that we
should part thus. Tell the world that it was you dismissed me, on
what grounds you will. I'll never contradict you. Thus there will
be no slight upon your house, for as God's my witness, it is the
last thing I should wish to see. And if you need me ever...'</p>
<p>But there the fierce pride of Onorato exploded. 'Need you, you
rascal? I? Go to the Devil.'</p>
<p>'You have a safe-conduct to him, I think,' sneered the bitter
Cosimo.</p>
<p>Colombino sighed, turned and went out, and down the stairs of
the Casa Polentana in which he had dreamed of sitting one day as
master. In the street a groom waited with his horse. For it was his
daily custom before dining to ride over to the citadel so as to
deal with his company's concerns.</p>
<p>He mounted the big white charger and rode off, affectionately
greeted as he rode by every citizen he met, each beholding in him
the future Lord of Ravenna.</p>
<p>In the quarters he had made his own in the citadel, he sent for
Sangiorgio and Caliente to receive his orders. They were very
brief.</p>
<p>'Our work in Ravenna is done. I am starting for Siena at once,
to let it be known that our swords are in the market. I leave you
to pack and bring the Company after me with all speed. You should
be able to set out by the day after tomorrow. That is all.'</p>
<p>The sternness of his face at once suggested a mystery of pain
and forbade inquiry into it at the moment.</p>
<p>Sangiorgio was tactfully practical. 'What lances shall I order
to escort you?'</p>
<p>'None. I am in haste, and I'll travel light. A couple of grooms
will suffice to bring my gear.'</p>
<p>His departure, however, was delayed by matters of detail
concerning the Company upon which his captains found it necessary
to take his orders, and the afternoon was well advanced before at
last, equipped for travel, he set out.</p>
<p>Caliente and Sangiorgio went with him as far as the gateway, and
stood for a moment watching him as he rode briskly away. Then the
corpulent Spaniard turned bewildered eyes upon his gaunt
companion.</p>
<p>'Will you tell me what it means, Giorgio?'</p>
<p>Sangiorgio shrugged. 'It's plain, I think. He's grown weary in
time of the simpering disdain of that cold piece he was fool enough
to think of marrying. Give thanks.'</p>
<p>'I do. It was in my mind to take my leave of him after the
wedding. I have none of the arts of peace, and I should hate to
grow fatter than I am.'</p>
<p>They turned and sauntered across the wide courtyard, where the
dust was being raised by the hurried marshalling of troops.</p>
<p>'But for the way he looks at women,' said Don Pablo, 'Colombino
would be a flawless captain. That's where he's vulnerable. That's
the heel of our Achilles, and mark me, one of these days a woman
will be the ruin of him.'</p>
<p>Now whilst that might, of course, be possibly true of some woman
and of some time, it was very wide of the truth so far as
Samaritana da Polenta and the present were concerned.</p>
<p>The Lady of Ravenna was at that very moment confronting the
wrath of her father and her cousin on Colombino's behalf.</p>
<p>Onorato da Polenta had come storming into her bower with the
news of the unpardonable affront that Colombino had put upon their
house.</p>
<p>'You can say that you dismissed him, or that I refused to marry
him. He is too generous to deny it.'</p>
<p>This was to nourish his frenzy. He glared at her, and grew
suddenly suspicious. 'You're oddly reconciled. What part had you in
this?'</p>
<p>'You have seen my part. I was never willing. You employed
constraint. And this is the end.'</p>
<p>'The end? You think so. Ha!'</p>
<p>Then Cosimo questioned her more directly. Samaritana, do you
suppose that your unwillingness is responsible?'</p>
<p>'What else should I suppose?'</p>
<p>'Yet, when we asked him just this, he told us that as lately as
today you had announced yourself ready to become his willing wife.
Was he lying to shield you?'</p>
<p>'No. That is also true. I did so surrender. But it was too late.
In the sight of my reluctance he had taken the chivalrous resolve
to leave me free.'</p>
<p>'Chivalrous!' roared Onorato. 'Chivalrous to put this shame upon
my house; and he an upstart smirched with the dishonour of a father
who was hanged!' He sank into a chair, and took his head in his
hands. 'To have come back after twenty years of exile, to have
striven and suffered merely to be crowned by this affront!' Then he
was on his feet again, striding to and fro like an angry old wolf.
'I am too old to demand a personal satisfaction. I have no son to
cleanse our honour of this stain, and you, Cosimo, might as well
have been a woman since you chose to take holy orders.' He stopped
in front of him and bombarded him with some of his wrath. 'But for
that folly of yours, there would never have been any question of
bringing in this adventurer to succeed me. Anyway, there it is. You
are no more competent than I to send a challenge to him. There's
only one thing left.'</p>
<p>'What's that?' Samaritana asked him sharply.</p>
<p>His eyes were malevolent. 'Does nothing occur to you? Do you
suppose I can suffer this man to live?'</p>
<p>'He is the man to whom you owe everything that you today
possess. He is the man who brought you back to Ravenna.'</p>
<p>'He was paid for it, hired to it in the way of his trade.'</p>
<p>'And,' added Cosimo, 'by withdrawing now and leaving us
defenceless, he cheats us in the end.'</p>
<p>'That is not true. You know it is not true, Cosimo. A priest
should disdain falsehood and malice. Messer Colombo was paid to
bring us to Ravenna, but not to keep us here.'</p>
<p>'What do you know of that?' her father challenged her. 'I was
present, in his house at Montasco when he warned you that to
restore you to Ravenna would be easy. But that to keep you here
would be your own affair.'</p>
<p>'You defend this traitor? God forgive you! Are you so shameless
that you do not burn at the affront?'</p>
<p>'I have told you that I do not account it that. But the very
contrary'</p>
<p>He advanced upon her as if he would have struck her, his hand
raised. Then he let it fall heavily to his side again, and
turned.</p>
<p>'Come, Cosimo,' he said. 'Come away before I do a mischief to
this ninny I begot in an evil hour. We waste our time. Come.'</p>
<p>From his own point of view, could he have known it, he had done
worse than waste his time. He had betrayed his intentions against
Colombino to one who in that hour was moved to deepest kindness for
the Captain. She must be watchful. Colombino must be warned to take
measures for his safety. That was her first concern, and in this
she enlisted the assistance of her woman.</p>
<p>Monica employed herself industriously Two hours later she
brought word to her mistress that a man of the Lord Onorato's
confidence, named Masaccio, had just ridden out with six knaves,
his business being to track down Messer Colombino, who was known to
have left Ravenna an hour ago attended by only two grooms.</p>
<p>Samaritana was in panic. If Colombino had been indeed her lover,
she could scarcely have been more distraught. She raved against the
folly of his riding off without an escort, raved against her own
impotence, her weakness, her lack of men to do her will.</p>
<p>'But there are Messer Colombino's men in the citadel. A word to
them, and...'</p>
<p>'And they'll hang my father. Can't you see, Monica? If I warn
them of the danger, they'll require to know whence it proceeds.
They'll hold my father, and if harm comes to Messer Colombino there
can be no doubt of what they will do. Let me think. Oh, God help
me!'</p>
<p>She paced the chamber, her hands to her brow, fighting down
distraction so that hers might be at least the power of thought.
The best she could do, when at last she was able to reflect
clearly, was little enough, but she addressed herself to it with
courage. She laid with Monica plans that terrified the
waiting-woman, then sent her to prepare them. Three lines she wrote
to Don Pablo Caliente: 'Danger threatens Messer Colombo da Siena.
You are warned to send an escort after him at once. A half-score
men will suffice. But let them set out instantly and ride at the
gallop. The urgency is great. Waste not a moment.'</p>
<p>A messenger was found to bear that unsigned letter, with orders
to deliver it and depart, so as to avoid being questioned as to
whence it came.</p>
<p>Then in the riding-dress of one of the Lord Onorato's pages,
booted to the thighs and in a cloak grotesquely heavy and ample
considering the heat, her face in the shadow of a round hat,
Samaritana slipped from the Casa Polentana by the garden gate. The
fluttered and anxious Monica was to cover her retreat by announcing
that she was not well, that she had sought her bed and was not to
be disturbed. All things considered, there was nothing in the tale
to strain belief.</p>
<p>At the end of the lane a groom was waiting with a horse, which
at a word he surrendered without suspecting this cloaked stripling
to be the Lady of Ravenna.</p>
<p>Samaritana went quietly out of the city, and then at a breakneck
pace along the road that runs south by the sea with the aim of
outriding Masaccio and overtaking Colombino in time to put him on
his guard.</p>
<h3>&mdash; ii &mdash;</h3>
<p>Colombino rode with intent to reach Rimini that night, and lie
there. But the distance, not far short of fifty miles, is one that
would have taxed the endurance of his horse, even had he travelled
with discretion, instead of riding, as he did, at a pace in keeping
with the tumultuous gallop of his thoughts.</p>
<p>It befell that in the darkness of a starry night he found
himself just beyond the ancient Rubicon on a foundered horse,
whilst the grooms who had followed, disgruntled but uncomplaining,
were in no better case.</p>
<p>They had brought up in the neighbourhood of Bellaria, and within
half a bowshot of a lonely tavern, the Neptune Inn, a ramshackle
building, standing back a little from the highway, almost on the
very edge of the sea.</p>
<p>'That at least is fortunate,' said Colombino, as he led his lame
horse towards the rhomb of yellow light that fell from the open
door.</p>
<p>Precisely how fortunate it was he did not yet suspect. Before
morning he was to realize that if chance had made him call a halt
any earlier or any later, the long odds were that this night would
have seen the end of him.</p>
<p>At close quarters the dilapidated house, with a bush of
withered, dusty rosemary hanging as a sign above the door, looked
not merely uninviting, but forbidding. Such as it was, however, it
offered a roof.</p>
<p>From the threshold he surveyed the unpaved common-room through a
haze of smoke, his throat and nostrils assailed by acrid odours, in
which rancid oil and garlic were predominant.</p>
<p>A long, heavy oaken table occupied one side, and a couple of
trestle tables against which benches were ranged lined the opposite
wall. The place was indifferently lighted by a brass oil lamp
overhead. From each of the three beaks of this a long narrow tongue
of flame, ending in a pennon of black smoke, waved in the draught
from the open door.</p>
<p>By the hearth a man squatted on his heels, turning some spitted
pieces of flesh over a fire of logs. He looked over his shoulder at
the newcomers, then he rose, holding the flesh-laden spit as if it
were a rapier. Out of an evil, unclean countenance red-rimmed eyes
pondered the guest with more challenge than invitation.</p>
<p>Conquering his nausea, the young Captain advanced, leaving the
door open. He thrust back the wide black hat he wore, and left it
to hang from his shoulders by the cords from which it was slung.
His thick, tawny hair, bushed out behind, was confined in a golden
net upon which there were tiny jewels.</p>
<p>The taverner surveyed his height and breadth of shoulder, his
princely air and rich apparel, and made a tardy effort at civility.
But, matching his own forbidding house, he was a man in whom
civility came neither naturally nor easily.</p>
<p>Colombino peremptorily made known his wants: food and wine and a
lodging for the night for himself and his grooms. At once cringing
and surly the taverner answered that food and wine he could supply,
if my lord were not too exacting; but that accommodation for the
night he could not offer. Of this objection the soldier made short
work. He could go no farther, and the common-room must serve his
needs. His tone precluded argument.</p>
<p>Because of the foulness of the place, and the night being hot,
he insisted that the door should remain wide as he had found it.
Upon this depends all that follows.</p>
<p>Masaccio and his six cut-throats upon Colombino's spoor, riding
in haste, and with fresh horses obtained at Cesenatico an hour ago,
were drawn by the glow of that open door and the promise it held
for dusty throats. With no suspicion that their quarry was so near,
with no thought other than to drink a cup of wine, those rascals
pulled up at the Neptune Inn.</p>
<p>Colombino, seated at the oaken table, with his grooms at the end
of it, below the salt-cellars, looked up at the sound of halting
hoofs.</p>
<p>There was a mutter of talk out there in the gloom, and then a
raucous voice broke into a bawdy song. The singer advanced into the
light, a burly, bearded ruffian, clad mainly in leather with here
and there a hint of steel. At his heels came six others similarly
accoutred.</p>
<p>On the threshold the jovial leader stood arrested, goggle-eyed,
the snatch of song perishing on his lips. Behind him pressed his
companions, as goggle-eyed as himself to behold Messer Colombino
seated there as if awaiting them. Then Masaccio expressed his
incredulous amazement in an unclean oath and his satisfaction in a
laugh.</p>
<p>'Here's luck beyond belief! And we might have ridden by. Devil's
body! I sweat at the thought.' He flung forward, leering. 'Well
met, your potency. I bring you a message.'</p>
<p>The insolence of the knave's glance, confirming the evil mockery
of his tone, brought the Captain instantly to his feet.</p>
<p>The movement appeared to prompt decision in the other. A more
subtle rogue would have made pretended innocence of intention until
within striking distance. But Masaccio was an animal without
subtleties; indeed, of a certain rough honesty. His bellow sounded
the charge, and he lugged out his sword as he bellowed, thus giving
Messer Colombino at least full warning of what was coming.</p>
<p>Loyally the Captain's grooms put themselves in the way of those
rascals, and so delayed them for a moment. In that moment Colombino
vaulted over the table. Entrenched behind it, his back protected by
the wall, sword in hand and with his cloak swiftly swathed about
his left arm, he felt himself in better case to make his stand and
perhaps bring these cut-throats to a parley.</p>
<p>Parleying, however, was not in their business. Having knocked
over the grooms, the pack leapt at the victim, and for some five
strenuous minutes an incredible battle raised the dust from that
unclean floor.</p>
<p>The taverner, in the background by the fireplace, remained at
gaze, in affright.</p>
<p>The table, meanwhile, was proving a stout rampart. Every attempt
to remove that barrier, too ponderous to yield to one man's
strength, was frustrated by the Captain's vigorous swordplay One
rascal only was so rash as to attempt conclusions with him.
Advancing within striking distance, he had thrust boldly across the
board. Colombino used his left arm as a buckler, and before the
ruffian could disentangle his blade from the Captain's cloak, a
swift estramacon came to sever the sinews of his sword-arm.</p>
<p>Disabled and drenched in blood, the man reeled back, a howling
discouragement to his fellows. Let Masaccio curse them for cowards
as he would, there was not another amongst them quite so rash as to
take the wounded man's place. Instead, they addressed themselves
once more to the removal of the table, so that all might come
together upon their prey. They went about the task with system. Two
of them stood by to ward the Captain's blows and make a cover under
which two others might drag away the board.</p>
<p>Not all Colombino's vigour and address could have averted the
inevitable end if there had been no intervention. It happened,
however, that just as that glowing open doorway had attracted the
notice of these assassins, so did it attract the notice of another
party, riding north from Rimini.</p>
<p>Colombino was persuading himself that his sands were run when
that salvation came.</p>
<p>A broad-shouldered young man, very richly apparelled, surged
suddenly upon the threshold.</p>
<p>By the Eyes of God, does it take six of you to kill a man?' Thus
he announced himself, and at the ring of his voice the assassins
fell back and wheeled to face him.</p>
<p>He came briskly forward, with jingling spurs and a swagger that
swayed his crimson cloak; and men came crowding after him to the
number of ten: rough, seafaring men by their outlandish garments
and their swathed heads, armed with short, curved, ugly-looking
swords of Turkish pattern.</p>
<p>Masaccio and his fellows backed away in apprehension towards the
hearth, where the taverner continued a helpless, uninterfering
witness.</p>
<p>The newcomer laughed with a queer gleeful ferocity, and rapped
out an order.</p>
<p>'Cut me those brigands down.'</p>
<p>But as the murderous blades flashed forth, Colombino stayed
them.</p>
<p>'Hold!'</p>
<p>Their quick, fierce master, swarthy and handsome in a brutal
way, raised his black eyebrows until they were merged in the fringe
of blue-black hair that hung straight across his shallow brow.</p>
<p>A little out of breath from his exertions, Colombino answered
the amazed inquiry of that glance. 'They are not brigands, sir.
They are poor hireling cut-throats.'</p>
<p>Be they one or the other, their deserts are the same. My men
will soon...'</p>
<p>'No, no!'</p>
<p>Colombino raised his fine, long hand. Of a ruthlessness in
battle transcending perhaps that of any mercenary of his day, yet
his horror of slaughter in cold blood was also greater. He would
never have recourse to it even in action where surrender was to be
obtained. That, indeed, was the mercenary's code, and by that code
he chose now, with singular generosity, to be governed towards men
whom he regarded, not as personal enemies, but as mercenaries hired
for this undertaking.</p>
<p>'They are merely servants. Their master has, perhaps, a just
quarrel with me. I have none with them. Let them go their
ways.'</p>
<p>'When but for me they would have had your blood?'</p>
<p>'In their master's service. They did no more than they were
bidden. Let them depart, sir.'</p>
<p>The other swore ill-humouredly, by the oath betraying his
Venetian origin and by his humour the blood-lust of his nature. 'By
the Body of Saint Mark! You are a singularly foolish man. I'ld have
the heads off their dirty necks, and send them back in a bale to
their murderous master. That is what I should do.' His glance was
an invitation. But as Colombino merely smiled and shook his head,
he shrugged. 'After all, the affair is yours, not mine. If you are
resolved...'</p>
<p>'I am as to my wishes, sir.'</p>
<p>'Why, then...' He swung to the murderous pack. 'You're in luck
you kennel-rats. Away with you while it lasts. You'ld have fared
differently with me.'</p>
<p>Masaccio slunk forward, hang-dog. He checked a moment, looking
at Colombino, and seemed about to speak. Then he passed on, his
cut-throats going after him in a huddle that showed their lingering
apprehension. But on the threshold Masaccio paused again, letting
his men go on and scramble for their horses. He spoke, and his
voice trembled with emotion.</p>
<p>'As God's my witness, my lord, you shall never regret this
saintly clemency. Masaccio is your man from this hour. For any
service. I make oath of that, by the Bones of Saint Peter. Remember
it, Ser Colombino.' And with a wave of the hand he plunged out
after his men.</p>
<p>Colombino laughed as he called after him: 'I'll remember it when
I want a throat-cutting.'</p>
<p>Then he turned to give thanks at last to his preserver, to be
met, before he could utter a word, with the fierce harsh
question:</p>
<p>What name did that rascal give you?'</p>
<p>Colombino pondered the dark countenance before him, with its
great cliff of a nose and its aggressive, square, cleft chin.</p>
<p>'My own. Colombino.' With a touch of conscious pride he added:
'I am Colombo of Siena.'</p>
<p>As he moved to one of the trestle tables on which stood a beaker
and some cups, he was followed by a laugh.</p>
<p>'Colombo da Siena! You are Colombo da Siena, and it's your life
I've saved! Now that is droll. Infernally droll.'</p>
<p>Colombino, still breathing hard, laid his bare sword on the
table, and poured himself a draught of that vile wine. His throat
was full of dust, and his need of drink had momentarily dulled all
his faculties. He drained the cup, then let himself sag down
wearily to a three-legged stool that was at hand. He was mopping
his brow, when his preserver spoke again.</p>
<p>'It's the queerest chance. Had I not passed when I did, those
cutthroats would have saved me trouble. Oh, but I don't repine. I'm
a man who likes to do his own work with his own hands.'</p>
<p>The sinister mockery was not to be missed. The Captain looked
up, frowning. 'I don't think I understand.'</p>
<p>'But you shall. As God's my life, you shall.' He stood, squarely
before Colombino, his arms akimbo under his crimson cloak. 'I've
just crossed from Crete, so that you should understand me. Did you
ever hear of Ottavio Moro?'</p>
<p>Looking at him more closely now, Colombino traced in that
coarsely handsome countenance a resemblance to Cristoforo Moro who
was Doge of Venice and whom once, when in the service of the
Republic, Colombino had known. So this was that lover of
Samaritana's, who had been the Republic's procurator in Crete. The
menace in the fellow's manner was explained. But Colombino's easy
tone did not betray that he perceived it.</p>
<p>'And you are he. Faith! The queerest chance, as I think you
said. I was supposing you in Crete.'</p>
<p>'Very comfortable, no doubt, in that supposition. I left my duty
there to cross to Italy, so that I might have a word with you. I
landed at Rimini this afternoon, and I was riding to Ravenna. It is
considerate of you to spare me the trouble. You'll guess my
errand.'</p>
<p>Colombino smiled, but with a curling lip: He was moved to scorn
by the airs and postures of this Hector. 'You might have spared
yourself further. You are behind the fair.'</p>
<p>He saw the other's face turn white and wicked. He saw the hairy
jewelled hand settle instinctively on the hilt of his dagger. 'Do
you tell me that you are already wed?'</p>
<p>If there was fury in the tone, there was also pain, and it was
this that Colombino answered. 'No. There has been no wedding. But
do not imagine that this will profit you. I know that Samaritana da
Polenta thinks she loves you. But for your betrothal something more
is necessary. You do not and never will possess the Lord of
Ravenna's consent. He wants no Venetian blood in his grandchildren.
Sooner a Turk's.'</p>
<p>Moro flung out a hand in contemptuous anger. 'I can dispense
with the consent of Onorato da Polenta. But that's no concern of
yours. For you there is all you'll need in my purpose with you.
Unless you're a numskull you'll have guessed it.'</p>
<p>'I might be a numskull and still guess it from the fire you
breathe. You've crossed from Crete to seek me, you say.'</p>
<p>'And at need to kill you.'</p>
<p>'It's an irony that you should begin by saving my life.'</p>
<p>'I've already remarked it.'</p>
<p>Colombino sat there, a hand on his booted thigh, considering
Messer Ottavio Moro. And the more he considered him, the less he
liked him, the more insistently he asked himself under what
delusion could Samaritana have laboured when she imagined that she
loved this gaudy, ruffianly, theatrical Rhodomont. It would, he
thought, be a sweet and knightly deed to rid the world in general
and Samaritana in particular of such a fellow. In marriage to him
only damnation could await that chaste and delicate lady.</p>
<p>It was perhaps an ungrateful view to take, considering that he
owed his life to Moro. But, then, this was an accident deplored by
the Venetian; and by deploring it he had cancelled the actual
debt.</p>
<p>'I understand, of course. It is not for me to deny your
pleasure, Ser Ottavio. There is a spread of turf outside, and
there, when daylight comes, on horse or foot, naked of body or
fully armed, as you please, I shall be at your service.'</p>
<p>With that, accounting the matter ended, Colombino put out his
hand to take his sword. But Moro, leaning forward, by a swift,
sweeping movement, sent the weapon hurtling across the room, to be
recovered by one of his men.</p>
<p>The act brought Colombino to his feet whilst the other was
explaining it.</p>
<p>'No need to wait for daylight. Are you a fool, or do you suppose
me one, to think that I'll cross swords with you.'</p>
<p>'I see. You mean to murder me. A knightly intention.'</p>
<p>'Knightly? What have I to do with knightliness?'</p>
<p>'Nothing, as I might have guessed.'</p>
<p>The blood mounted to the Venetian's face. 'You cheap adventurer!
Are you so besotted with vanity as to suppose that a man of my
blood will meet the son of Terrarossa in single combat? I know you,
you see.'</p>
<p>'You say that with ten swords at your back, to a man you dare
not meet. You do yourself great honour. In the Venetian manner, I
suppose.'</p>
<p>As he spoke he was calculating his chances, although weaponless,
of a sudden seizure of this assailant. A sudden grip, and he might
snatch Moro's own dagger and set the blade at his throat before his
knaves could move to hinder. On the very point of launching
himself, his keen ears caught from the distance, faintly, a sound
of approaching hooves. That gave him pause. No need, perhaps to
risk his desperate chance. As the light of that doorway had drawn
others, so it might draw these fresh travellers, too. Let him
temporize, then, and even as he was deciding, Moro supplied the
means.</p>
<p>'I hold you, and you had best realize that your sands are run
this night unless you accept my terms.'</p>
<p>'Oh, there are terms?'</p>
<p>'You may have the honours of war if you will own defeat.
Capitulate. Confess that you cannot hold what you have had the
temerity to seize, and you may have your life.'</p>
<p>Colombino stroked his chin. 'This needs considering,' said he
slowly, his ears intent upon that distant clop-clop.</p>
<p>`Consider, then, and resolve. But quickly. I have no time to
waste on you.'</p>
<p>The hoof-beats were very rapid, and rapidly grew louder. These
travellers were riding at a gallop, and there must be at least six
of them, perhaps more. But now they caught Moro's attention, too,
and like Colombino he perceived the chances of an interruption. To
avert them he issued an order.</p>
<p>'Shut that door.'</p>
<p>A couple of his men sprang to do his bidding. Closing the door,
they masked the light and thus extinguished Colombino's new-found
hope. He must now depend upon himself alone. Either he must take
the desperate chance of a sudden onset or else make a cowardly
surrender which this Venetian braggart would no doubt proclaim
widely hereafter.</p>
<p>The man's harsh voice came to rouse him. 'Well, sir? Have you
resolved?'</p>
<p>Colombino shrugged resignedly 'You hold me in check. I have no
choice, it seems.'</p>
<p>'You are not without prudence, my valiant captain.'</p>
<p>'The odds are a little heavy even for me,' Colombino excused
himself. 'You have my word that I will...'</p>
<p>'Your word!' The interruption came on a laugh of scorn. 'The
word of Terrarossa! I'll need some better security than that. You
shall write a letter to Onorato da Polenta, declining the alliance
with his daughter in terms which shall leave you no doorway of
retreat.'</p>
<p>'And these terms?'</p>
<p>The question is: Will you write as I shall dictate? It is that
or the end of you.' He waved a hand to that line of men, waiting
with drawn swords. 'Come, sir. Decide.'</p>
<p>Colombino perceived here a faint advantage. It must be that the
letter he demanded was more valuable to Moro than the mere death of
his rival, or else that death would already have been launched.</p>
<p>There was no reason why he should not write in renunciation of
something which he had renounced already, saving that this abject
surrender to force seemed to him dishonouring.</p>
<p>'How shall this profit you?' he asked. 'How shall my withdrawal,
by murder or otherwise, clear the way for you? I tell you again
that Onorato da Polenta will never bestow his daughter on your
father's son.'</p>
<p>Ottavio Moro scarcely controlled himself. 'Leave that. Come to
what concerns you. Will you renounce, or will you be permanently
removed?'</p>
<p>The hoof-beats, rattling upon the dry hard road, were now
abreast of the place. But he no longer founded hopes upon those
travellers.</p>
<p>'Very well,' he said. 'Let me have the wherewithal to
write.'</p>
<p>But in the act of calling upon the taverner for pen and ink,
Moro checked. The incredible was happening. The riders had left the
road. They were pounding across the turf towards the door of the
inn.</p>
<p>To Colombino it was a miracle. To Moro little more than an
irritation.</p>
<p>'Hell! Who will these be?'</p>
<p>'Friends of mine, I hope,' said Colombino.</p>
<p>'Much that will profit you, or them,' Moro taunted him, for he
had gauged their numbers, and knew himself in superior force.</p>
<p>Then the door was flung open, and Colombino saw that here was no
miracle; no accident even; just the natural sequel to what had gone
before.</p>
<p>On the threshold stood the burly form of Masaccio.</p>
<h3>&mdash; iii &mdash;</h3>
<p>'It's you, is it?' growled Moro. 'What the devil have you come
back for?'</p>
<p>But Masaccio was not heeding him. After a glance through the
room, he spoke over his shoulder to someone behind him.</p>
<p>'He is still here. And safe and sound as I promised you. Come
and see for yourself.'</p>
<p>A slim stripling, a lad, as it seemed, booted to the thighs and
cloaked thence to the neck, came to stand in the light, at
Masaccio's side.</p>
<p>Colombino, whose eyes like those of every man in the room had
turned upon these intruders, caught his breath to behold under the
round black hat the pale, oval, lovely face of Samaritana da
Polenta.</p>
<p>Following Masaccio's pointing hand with almost fearful
eagerness, her dark eyes swept to him without so much as a glance
for the others, and from her lips he was greeted by an outcry of
passionate fervency.</p>
<p>'God be thanked for this mercy!' She stepped down and ran to
him, still without eyes for any other, and she caught him by the
arms. 'Oh, God be thanked!' she cried again. 'When I met Masaccio,
riding back, I thought that I should die in my despair. It seemed
that for all the fearful haste I had made, I was too late: I could
hardly believe Masaccio when he told me that he had been foiled in
his evil work, that you had been preserved by...'</p>
<p>There abruptly she broke off. She had turned, her eyes seeking
his preservers, and they had alighted upon Ottavio Moro, straight,
grim, and scowling, in his crimson splendour. Speechless for a
moment in sheer amazement, going pale at sight of him, she had
loosed her hold of Colombino's arms, and had swung more squarely to
confront her lover.</p>
<p>'Samaritana!'</p>
<p>The sound of his voice restored her to speech and movement. She
stepped towards him, her head forward.</p>
<p>'Ottavio! It is you, indeed? And here?' She uttered an odd,
excited laugh. 'A miracle!'</p>
<p>Something in his expression gave her pause. She looked about
her, her eyes troubled. Her senses caught an ominous tenseness.
'But those men? Why are their swords drawn? What...what was
happening here?'</p>
<p>Moro was sneering. 'Those swords were drawn to do you service.
To deliver you from a peril in which I, poor fool, believed that
you stood.' And upon that he leapt at her and seized her by the
shoulders, fiercely 'Traitress! Is this the faith you keep? Is this
your steadfastness? Was it to discover this that I left my post in
Crete, for which I may yet be broken?'</p>
<p>'Discover?' Sternness surmounted her bewilderment. 'What, pray,
do you imagine that you have discovered?'</p>
<p>'Imagine? Have you left room to imagine anything? Have I not
seen? Have I not heard?' Still clutching her slim shoulders in his
hairy jewelled paws, his white, disordered countenance within a
foot of her own, he raved on. 'I landed at Rimini today, so as to
ride to deliver you. And here tonight I begin by saving the life of
the man I had come to kill. Ironical, isn't it? As ironical as your
riding so desperately to save the man from whom I had come to save
you, you faithless woman!'</p>
<p>If he paused then, it seemed to be because his rage was choking
him.</p>
<p>'Faithless, am I?' There was a sad, twisted smile on her pale
lips. 'But where is your faith, Ottavio?'</p>
<p>'Only a fool's faith could survive this evidence. And I am not a
fool.'</p>
<p>'No. A madman.'</p>
<p>'Because I will not listen to your lies? Because I will not be
deluded by them when the truth stands stark before me? You rode in
wild, fearful haste to save this man: this man of all men; this man
whom your father was forcing you to wed against your will; this man
for whose death you must, therefore, have prayed had you been loyal
to your vows to me. Can any lies destroy that, or explain the
slobbering fondness in which you ran to him? What has he become to
you? That is all that I desire to hear from you. Answer me!' He
shook her roughly 'What has he become to you?'</p>
<p>She threw up her head, and never had Colombino seen those proud
eyes of hers so cold and proud as at this moment.</p>
<p>Abruptly she twisted from Moro's grasp. The action loosened the
cloak in which she was modestly wrapped. It fell open, disclosing
the slim body loosely clad in the borrowed leather hacketon. She
was breathing hard in fury.</p>
<p>'God of Heaven! Am I some baggage for your handling and your
insults? I am Samaritana da Polenta.'</p>
<p>The reminder only served to inflame his savage, aggressive
nature; the barren, domineering mind was hardened in its
obstinacy.</p>
<p>'I am well aware of that: of the treacherous house from which
you spring and of the wantonness that's in the blood of its women
since that Francesca da Polenta who in Rimini made a cuckold of
Malatesta.'</p>
<p>Colombino saw her gloved hand tighten upon the riding-whip she
carried; he saw her lips part to speak, yet remain silent; he saw
the glance of cold disdain with which she withered the Venetian;
then abruptly he found himself addressed by her.</p>
<p>'I beg you, sir, to conduct me hence.'</p>
<p>He was very prompt to obey, but as promptly found himself
checked by Moro.</p>
<p>'Ah, that, no. I am not to be mocked. You'll take the
consequences, my girl, of this rash journey. Before you came I had
offered terms to this rascal, this fellow for whose sweet sake you
confront alone the perils of the road in man's attire.' Slobbering
like a drunkard in his passion, his mouth awry, insult in every
line of him, he pointed with a shaking hand to her booted legs. 'In
man's attire, with the effrontery of a harlot. So that he renounced
you, I would spare his life. But now that I hold you, his
renunciation is not needed. You'll come with me to Crete, my girl.
Not in honour, as my wife, since you're soiled goods, no longer fit
for that. But you'll come with me. Do you understand? That will
teach you and your rascally lover what it means to make a mock of
Ottavio Moro.'</p>
<p>Her answer was swift and sudden as a lightning-flash. It was
delivered with her whip across his evilly derisive face.</p>
<p>'You vile hound! You pitiful tyrant bully!' Thus in a royal
anger. Then her voice broke. 'O God! The shame of ever having loved
you! The scalding shame of it!'</p>
<p>Moro had fallen back with an inarticulate cry, his hand to his
face, livid now save where a red wheal was angrily rising to mark
the course of her whiplash. A moment he pondered her with the eyes
of a wild beast. Then his hand went to his sword-hilt.</p>
<p>With what murderous intent he drew will never be fully known;
for before the point had cleared the scabbard, Colombino acted.
Swiftly he caught up the three-legged stool by which he had
remained standing, and using it as a battle-axe, he stretched the
Venetian insensible upon the earthen floor.</p>
<p>That made an instant stir, both among Moro's followers ranged by
the fireplace and Masaccio's knaves who were crowded in the
doorway. But promptest of all was Masaccio himself. With immediate
perception of what must follow, a perception rendered instinctive
by the experience of many a rough-and-tumble, the burly ruffian had
whipped out his sword almost before Moro reached the ground.</p>
<p>As Moro's men began the movement of a charge to their leader's
rescue, Masaccio's foot was on Moro's breast, his point at the
Venetian's throat.</p>
<p>'Back there, all of you, or by the belly of Bacchus I'll pin
your master to the floor like a beetle.'</p>
<p>That checked them, and, whilst they stood in huddled
apprehension, the bravo laughed at them. He threw out his chest. He
became grandiose as he addressed Colombino.</p>
<p>'Thus Masaccio pays his debts. I told you I was your man, my
lord. I pray you take madonna hence whilst I keep these foreign
hogs at bay.'</p>
<p>'Hark!' Samaritana's hand was on Colombino's arm. Once again
from the distance came a sound of hooves, the drumming now of a
numerous company 'This will be Don Pablo. I sent him urgent word to
follow.'</p>
<p>Colombino smiled down upon her. 'You seem to have forgotten
nothing, madonna.' Then he stepped to Masaccio. 'Give me that
sword. I'll take your place, whilst you go outside and hold up this
troop for me.'</p>
<p>Thus he was left there, with Samaritana beside him, and
Masaccio's five sound knaves just beyond, ready at need to oppose
themselves to a rush by those ten Cretans.</p>
<p>But Moro's men, held in check less by this than by the menace to
the life of their lord, had no thought to attempt a rush. The
perception that this thunder of hooves that was rolling nearer
heralded an overwhelming enemy force had made them apprehensive for
their lives.</p>
<p>One of them attempted to make terms. Colombino cut him
short.</p>
<p>'Throw down your weapons, all of you, if you hope for mercy' He
was obeyed, and so they waited there in a queer silence for some
moments until outside the arriving horsemen clattered to a halt and
the night became noisy with their voices.</p>
<p>When presently Moro's senses had returned, and he sat up
bewildered, his face smeared in blood from the cut which the stool
had dealt his brow, he found the place swarming with men-at-arms in
steel and leather, and he saw the Lady Samaritana standing between
Colombino and a swarthy, corpulent fellow who was broadly grinning
at him.</p>
<p>Some of Moro's own men came to raise him up. If as his wits
cleared he became conscious of his peril, it robbed him of none of
his arrogance. He shook himself out of the supporting arms of his
knaves, wiped the blood and sweat from his face, greenishly livid
under its tan, and stood squarely before the corpulent Don Pablo,
who so obviously commanded these newcomers.</p>
<p>'You'ld best not let your fools interfere with me,' he warned
the Spaniard. I am Ottavio Moro, son of His Serenity the Doge, and
the Most Serene Republic's Procurator in Crete.'</p>
<p>Don Pablo's fat, jovial countenance grinned at him. 'It rests
with my Lord Colombo whether you're to become the Most Serene
Republic's Procurator in Hell. And I think it's very likely.'</p>
<p>'At your peril, sirs!'</p>
<p>Don Pablo swung to his master.</p>
<p>'Your orders, my lord?'</p>
<p>Colombino stroked his chin. 'I can scarcely claim him. He
belongs to Monna Samaritana.'</p>
<p>Samaritana, ever cold and proud and so much mistress of herself
now that none might guess the wound she had taken, slowly shook her
head.</p>
<p>'He is no man of mine,' she disowned him. 'That is overpast, if,
indeed, it ever was. For until tonight I have never known him. I
knew only the pretended self with which he deceived me. Do with him
as you will, Ser Colombino; yet I would have you spare his life,
not for his own sake, but for yours.'</p>
<p>'It's in his face,' said Don Pablo, 'that he'll be hanged sooner
or later. There's an opportune tree just outside...'</p>
<p>Colombino broke in.</p>
<p>'Let him go his pitiful ways. Let him go back to Crete and his
procuratorship.'</p>
<p>Don Pablo sighed his resignation. 'Yet the Cretans are docile,
inoffensive people. It's a little hard on them.'</p>
<p>Moro glared at him, wild-eyed, speechless, then found Samaritana
claiming his attention.</p>
<p>She had come to stand squarely before this man to whom she had
betrothed herself in defiance of her father, and for whose
sake&mdash;believing him fine and noble, as women will believe
their lovers&mdash;she had been ready to endure all things.
Steadily she met now his wild, baffled glance, and her words
dropped ice-cold upon his overheated brain.</p>
<p>'You asked me several questions tonight, and to all of them,
yourself, you supplied the answers, to your own ignoble
satisfaction. But there was one question which would have been the
first on the lips of a man of heart or brain, which you forgot to
ask: Whence sprang the danger to Messer Colombino from which I rode
to save him? Which is to say: By whom and why were men set on to
murder him?</p>
<p>'Let me give you the answer now, so that you may ponder it on
your way back to Crete, and draw from the story a lesson for your
future.'</p>
<p>And she told him of Colombino's chivalrous renunciation, to the
hurt of his ambition and reckless of the rancour he must provoke by
the pretence under which he made it. It was a tale so simple and
obvious, supplying so clear an explanation of Masaccio's attempt
upon the Captain, that it compelled immediate belief even in the
jaundiced mind of Moro.</p>
<p>'And now, sir,' she ended quietly, 'you possess the answer to
your question as to what there is between Messer Colombino and me
that I should ride through the night to save him, fronting the
perils of the road, alone and thus, in man's attire, with the
effrontery of a harlot, as you so delicately observed.'</p>
<p>She ceased, and stood with a little, twisted smile considering
the Venetian's stricken countenance. Then, abruptly, she turned her
back on him.</p>
<p>'If you will give me leave, Ser Colombino, Masaccio and his
knaves will escort me back to Ravenna.'</p>
<p>Only then did Moro shake off the paralysis that held him. He
sprang after her, with a pleading, broken cry. 'Samaritana!
Samaritana! Forgive! I did not know. How could I guess so
much?'</p>
<p>'You guessed other things so easily. Ignoble things. This you
could not guess because it asks a nobility, a faith that does not
lie within your nature. I thank God for the timely discovery of
it.'</p>
<p>Those were her last words to him. She beckoned Masaccio to
attend her, and went out.</p>
<p>Colombino followed, to hold her stirrup. When she was mounted,
he stood irresolute beside her in the gloom, his hand upon the neck
of her horse.</p>
<p>'I have yet to utter some word of thanks,' he murmured.</p>
<p>'Not to me. None are due. You heard what I said to that man. In
what I did tonight to serve you I performed the least duty that
your nobility imposed upon me.'</p>
<p>He looked up. A shaft of light from the inn door glowed now upon
her proud, finely featured face, pallidly wistful.</p>
<p>'No more than that?' he asked her, very softly.</p>
<p>There was a pause in which she seemed to seek words, and when
she had found them her voice choked upon them.</p>
<p>'What else could there be? I loved Ottavio Moro. So much. My
heart is weeping a little over the shards of a broken idol.'</p>
<p>He sighed. His voice was low, his face invisible to her, in the
shadows.</p>
<p>'Of my love for you, madonna, you hold, I think, the proof. It
is deep and strong and it will last. I ask for nothing now, nor
ever shall, save that I would have you remember that in any need I
exist to serve you. To know it may lend you strength. To know that
you believe it will bring some radiance to my life. That is all,
madonna. Remember.'</p>
<p>'Could I forget?' she choked.</p>
<p>He took his hand from her horse's neck, and stepped back.</p>
<p>'God guard your journey, madonna,' he said steadily.</p>
<p>'And keep you safe and fortunate,' was her answering wish.</p>
<p>He watched her ride away with Masaccio and his band. Then slowly
he turned to find Don Pablo standing, a bulky silhouette, in the
light of the doorway.</p>
<p>'An unprofitable night for everybody, it seems,' he sighed.
'There's been a general shipwreck of intentions here at the Neptune
Inn.'</p>
<p>'Who knows?' wondered the Spaniard. 'Who knows in this world
what is shipwreck and what is salvation? All things are causes,
Captain: seeds in the womb of time. Out of evil comes good, and out
of good comes evil. None ever knows until time gives birth to the
effect.'</p>

<h2><a name="ch-05" id="ch-05"></a>Chapter 5. THE LADY OF LA
BOURDONNAYE</h2>
<h3>&mdash; i &mdash;</h3>
<p>Of all that Colombo da Siena had said to Onorato da Polenta,
nothing was more truthful than that there was likely to be war in
Naples over the succession. They were nearer to it than he
supposed, as he discovered when heavy-hearted he came back to
Siena, and took his way at vintage-time to his villa on the heights
of Montasco.</p>
<p>Scarcely was he returned when he was sought there with news of
this unrest by three prominent members of the Signory&mdash;the
Council of Fifteen&mdash;which ruled the State. They were his
friend Petrucci, Annibale Piccolomini, a young kinsman of that
gracious, scholarly Pope, Aenea Silvio Piccolomini, who ruled as
Pius II, and Ettore Malavolti, who disputed with Petrucci the
leadership of the Republic of Siena, successfully for the moment
since he held the high office of Prior of the Fifteen.</p>
<p>They told Colombino in detail of the war clouds gathering over
Naples, where King Ferdinand&mdash;the bastard of Alfonso of
Aragon, who had wrested the kingdom from the House of
Anjou&mdash;sat enthroned. They confirmed the rumours that had been
abroad in the Italian Peninsula for months to the effect that John
of Calabria, the son of old King Ren, of Anjou, encouraged and
supported by the King of France, was arming and secretly making
alliances with the aim of reconquering the dominions of his
house.</p>
<p>The struggle if it came would be a stern one, and might involve
the whole of Italy. For in the North the Duke of Milan allowed it
plainly to be seen that war would find him on the side of Aragon,
and in the South the Pope was throwing the weight of his influence
into the scales on the same side. Siena could scarcely hope to keep
out of the garboil. At the same time the Signory was not prepared
to yield to urgings of the Piccolomini that the Republic should
declare for Aragon. It preferred to wait upon events before
approaching a decision. In the meantime lest decision when it came
should find the Republic unprepared, these prominent patrician
representatives of the State, welcoming Colombo's timely return,
hastened to prevent him from disbanding the troops he had brought
south.</p>
<p>They found him oddly cold, and, for a man who lived by war, so
singularly indifferent that Malavolti's suspicions were instantly
aroused.</p>
<p>'If,' said Colombo, 'the Republic chooses to quarter my men at
her own charges, and to pay them for doing nothing at say
three-quarters of the rates they would receive if they were
actively campaigning, that is the Republic's affair. The matter, of
course, can be arranged.'</p>
<p>'And yourself?' asked Malavolti, his dark eyes very
watchful.</p>
<p>'Myself?' Colombino shrugged, and hesitated. Distaste and
lassitude were written plainly upon his face. 'I am a little weary
of campaigning. I need rest. Body and soul. I hope to find it here
in my vineyards. There is no need to take me into account.'</p>
<p>'There is every need,' said Piccolomini, the oldest and gravest
of the three. 'Without you, your army is merely a rabble of men. It
is the Company of the Dove the Signory desires to retain, and there
is no Company of the Dove without Colombo.'</p>
<p>'There are my captains. Sangiorgio and Caliente. Both leaders of
great experience.'</p>
<p>'This, sir, is frivolous,' said Malavolti.</p>
<p>'Regard it as you please. My heart's not in it.'</p>
<p>'Your heart's not in it!' Malavolti stood up, a tall man, with
the lithe, graceful vigour of a panther. His handsome, swarthy face
grew dark. The full-lipped, sensual mouth was grimly set. 'If
offers were to come to you from the Angevins, would your heart be
in it then?'</p>
<p>Colombo's expression of weariness deepened. 'I have said that
you may have my men. You do me the honour to say that without me to
lead them they are of small effect. But of what effect am I without
them? Are you answered?'</p>
<p>'Not as directly as I could wish.'</p>
<p>'Oh, as to that, I might have added a reminder that I am a free
agent, to be constrained into the service of no party, but to take
service as I choose. Your tone seems almost to deny me such a
right.'</p>
<p>Camillo Petrucci hastened to the rescue. 'No, no, Colombino. It
is just because we recognize it that we are here, so as to
forestall any other who might seek to engage you.</p>
<p>'And, after all,' added Piccolomini, 'you are a child of Siena,
and you could not wish to find yourself ranged on the side to which
Siena is opposed if Siena should come into the conflict.'</p>
<p>'I thank you for that justice,' said Colombino, and he
disregarded Malavolti's open sneer. 'Disabuse your minds. As I have
said, my heart is not in it. Not in campaigning, I mean. I have
been almost constantly under arms for three years now. I need
repose, and my vineyards need me.'</p>
<p>'This we could recognize, my friend,' said Petrucci gently 'But
consider. If war should come, it cannot come now before the spring.
The season is too far advanced. This ensures you a rest of close
upon six months. By the end of that time you should be weary of
resting. And meanwhile over this period of inaction, at a time when
there are no hirings, the Republic will pay you a retainer of a
thousand ducats a month in addition to providing for your company.
That, in fact, is the offer we have been sent to make. It does not
seem to me an offer that you can or should refuse.'</p>
<p>Not if he's honest,' said Malavolti.</p>
<p>Colombino let that pass. He stalked the length of that spacious,
handsome room, his thumbs in the girdle of his crimson houppelande,
his chin on his breast. His thoughts were with Samaritana, and his
last sight of her as she rode away into the darkness outside the
Neptune Inn. It was a vision of her that was to recur whenever she
rose in his thoughts, and that was to be very often. It seemed to
him that in going, as he had then seen her go, she had borne away
with her all his zest and all his ambition, leaving only lassitude
in his soul. There was no salt now in life. All achievement was
insipid, all exertion seemed futility. Just as a man bruised in
body craves rest and is content to lie inert, so he, bruised in
spirit, found himself urged to bucolic inaction. But there was with
him, too, the knowledge, however little there might at present be
the feeling, that these wounds would heal. He was not too young to
realize this. Presently with returning vigour of mind the need of
action would return also. If it did, and if war came, where else
should he be but on the side that Siena took?</p>
<p>Slowly he paced back, watched by those three pairs of eyes.</p>
<p>'Very well,' he said, at last. 'I will accept the
engagement.'</p>
<p>It was only Malavolti who paid heed to the lack of enthusiasm,
to the weary indifference of Colombino's tone. And when he
commented upon it afterwards to his companions, as they rode back
to Siena, he was silenced by their opposition, which in Petrucci
was hot with indignation.</p>
<p>There was no publication of that engagement, since this might
have appeared as an announcement that Siena had already decided
upon her course of action, which was very far from being the case.
But there was publication at about that time of the engagement by
the Angevin party of Jacopo Piccinino, who ranked just then as the
first soldier in Italy, the distinguished son of a father
distinguished in the same trade, and the commander of the most
formidable company of mercenaries that stood for hire in the
Peninsula.</p>
<p>Piccinino's engagement was the work of the Count Gaston de La
Bourdonnaye, who for some months had been flitting like a stormy
petrel up and down Italy, seeking to enlist on Anjou's behalf the
support of her princes and communes. Because of the known attitudes
of the Pope in the South and the Duke of Milan in the North,
Monsieur de La Bourdonnaye met with less success than he had hoped.
But he was not on that account dismayed. The enlisting of great
mercenary companies was at least as important as winning the favour
of states; and so long as he succeeded in the former, it might
ultimately be his to constrain the latter by the display of force
which his side could make. The hiring of Piccinino had been an
important step. So important that if he could add to it the
engagement of Colombo da Siena and his Company of the Dove, John of
Calabria, well supported in addition by French troops, would be in
such strength as the other side could hardly hope to equal, and
Aragon might abandon its pretensions.</p>
<p>At the same time, if he could win the support of the Republic of
Siena primarily and ostensibly the only object of his descent upon
it, he would be fully compensated for his failure with other lesser
states.</p>
<p>As the envoy extraordinary of the King of France, he was
received in Siena with all the honours due to his exalted office
from a State at peace with his master. There were festivities
attended by all who were of any consequence in the Republic, and
Camillo Petrucci dragged the reluctant Colombo from his retirement
at Montasco so that he might hear his part in them. The palio was
held in the Campo with more than ordinary magnificence; there was a
joust, over which the Comtesse de La Bourdonnaye presided, and in
which Colombo, who in addition to being a great captain was of a
singular address in arms, carried the day over all corners; and
there were banquets and balls and elaborate masques without end for
the entertainment of the Frenchman and his lovely, wistful young
Countess.</p>
<p>When, however, it came to politics, Monsieur de La Bourdonnaye
found the members of the Council as vague and lethargic as in
festive matters they were precise and active. Cursing the elusive
Italian subtlety of the Piccolomini, the Petrucci, the Malavolti,
and the Squillanti, he took the resolve, after three weeks of
wasted endeavour, to make sure of Colombino, let Siena do what it
might.</p>
<p>He attempted to broach the matter to the Captain one evening
after the performance of a comedy of Giumelli's at Petrucci's
palace, where for the time Colombo was housed. He sought him out in
a corner of the vast glittering room in which the play had been
given.</p>
<p>'You take your ease these days, my Captain. It is most just. No
man has better earned it; no man has a better title to rest upon
his laurels. And they are brave laurels, as is well known even
beyond the confines of Italy.'</p>
<p>From his stately height Colombino looked down upon this stocky
man in the middle forties, powerful and ungainly, and caught from
his prominent light eyes a suggestion of anxiety. He smiled, and
inclined his head a little as if in acknowledgment of the
compliments.</p>
<p>'There is peace in Italy at present. A miraculously unusual
condition.'</p>
<p>'But ephemeral. The elements of strife are present.'</p>
<p>'As for that, they always are.'</p>
<p>'Oh, but very definite. That is why I am in Italy' His tone grew
confidential. 'To prepare on behalf of the King my master. It is a
subject on which I should esteem a word with you.'</p>
<p>At your good pleasure, my lord.'</p>
<p>'You are gracious. The King of France has a proposal for you
that I think you will account worthy of his well-known
munificence.'</p>
<p>'I am honoured to deserve his regard. But at present I am in the
service of the Republic of Siena.'</p>
<p>'Already!' The Count was manifestly taken aback. 'And the term
of your engagement? Is it permissible to ask that question?'</p>
<p>'I am retained on a monthly stipend, my lord.'</p>
<p>'But the term of it?'</p>
<p>'No term is set.'</p>
<p>The Frenchman brightened. 'Why, then, it may be determined in a
month at any time.'</p>
<p>Colombino shook his head. 'Not as I understand it, sir. And not
as Siena understands it.'</p>
<p>'Understandings, my Captain, do not constitute engagements. The
service of the King my master confers not only honour but
emoluments such as I venture to think no other service today could
offer you.'</p>
<p>The condottiero smiled. 'Then it were best not to tempt me by
disclosing them. For I account myself indefinitely bound.'</p>
<p>'No man could be that,' said the Count, and he was about to
develop the argument when Ettore Malavolti, swaggering of gait,
effusive of manner, came to interrupt them.</p>
<p>'What do you conspire, you two?'</p>
<p>'Conspire?' cried La Bourdonnaye.</p>
<p>Malavolti's smile grew broader. 'What else should keep two
gallants in a corner, and one of them a Frenchman, when there are
ladies languishing for your attention?' He slipped a hand through
La Bourdonnaye's arm. 'The incomparable Caterina Squillanti offers
you the opportunity to be avenged upon her husband for the ardent
love he is making to your Countess.' And with a nod to Colombino,
he drew the Frenchman away, and carried him off to interrupt a very
close communion between the insolently beautiful Marchioness
Squillanti and that dainty patrician fribble Silvio Pecci.</p>
<p>The twain looked up almost in resentment. Shouldered, as it
were, aside by the masterful Malavolti, the exquisite, perfumed,
effeminate Pecci departed in reluctant resentment, and reluctant
were the dark eyes of the young Marchioness that followed him. The
shrewd Frenchman was not slow to draw the obvious inference. He was
not desired. Malavolti's announcement had been the merest pretext
to separate him from Colombino.</p>
<p>It showed him clearly from which quarter the wind was setting.
Not only were the patricians of Siena shy of his attempt to bind
them to his master's interest, but they were equally reluctant that
there should be any understanding between him and their great
condottiero. It became necessary to walk delicately in this matter,
and to mask his aims until they should be achieved, until Colombino
should be bound by definite engagement. And it was no less
necessary to proceed with the greatest care with Colombino himself,
so as to disentangle him from the bonds which Monsieur de La
Bourdonnaye conceived already to exist between the Captain and the
Republic of Siena. This might demand protracted and intimate
intercourse; and if these suspicious patricians became aware of
anything of the kind, they would at once assume the purpose for
which La Bourdonnaye was cultivating the society of Colombino, and
no doubt they would take their measures to frustrate his aims.</p>
<p>This was the problem now plaguing the envoy extraordinary of the
King of France. But kings do not choose dullards for this office,
and La Bourdonnaye was no dullard. That he looked a dullard was
perhaps an advantage. A stocky man, as I have said, short,
thick-set, and powerful, he carried aggressively erect on a short
neck a face that was brutally handsome, very big in the nose and
very square in the chin. But his blue eyes normally were dull, and
when they became alert they merely succeeded in giving him a
foolish expression. His brow receding to his iron-grey hair was at
once narrow and shallow. He lisped a little in his speech, he was
ostentatious in his dress, ingratiatory in manner, and he had the
loud and ready laughter that proclaims the empty head. But his head
was far from empty. He could be subtle as any Italian of them all,
he was troubled by no sense of moral values, and did not know what
it was to have a scruple where man or woman was concerned.</p>
<p>The problem of providing a cloak for the intimacy he desired
with Colombino did not long exercise him. It was solved by the
following morning; and since the solution entailed the
collaboration of his Countess, he instructed her without either
delay or qualms.</p>
<p>'At the banquet to be offered by the Commune tomorrow evening to
this Florentine tradesman, de' Medici, you will meet again that
handsome upstart, Colombo da Siena. You will recall that it was
from your own delicate hands that he received the trophy in last
week's tourney. It is impossible that you should not admire him.
Tomorrow night you will display that admiration unequivocally.
Opportunity will be provided. If you should even go the length of a
little wantonness, that will not perturb me. I desire you to arouse
in him a more than ordinary interest. You should not find it
difficult.'</p>
<p>There was no astonishment in the eyes she raised to look at him.
Only loathing. And not merely loathing of the task imposed upon
her, but of the man who imposed it.</p>
<p>They were standing in a room of the mezzanine of the palace in
the Via Flavia, near the Campo, which the Salimbeni had placed at
the disposal of the envoy extraordinary. It was a long,
low-ceilinged chamber, handsomely hung with tapestries in blue and
gold, and lighted by wide mullioned windows that overlooked the
street. A shaft of sunlight filtering through the gules of the
armorial bearings on the glass set a rosy glow in the middle of the
room and a patch as of blood upon the wood mosaics of the floor.
Elsewhere the long chamber was full of shadows, and it was into
these that Madame de La Bourdonnaye, had she obeyed her instincts,
would have crept. But she dared not move whilst the pale eyes of
her lord were compellingly upon her.</p>
<p>Twenty years younger than the Count, a slight, frail,
dark-haired woman, seeming little more than a child, her little
oval countenance, sharply outlined in its close-fitting coif, was
of a winning purity of feature and expression. Gentle and good and
innocent were her eyes, and hauntingly wistful, betraying the
unhappiness into which she was come, since her spirit had been
broken by the brutal, sneering, domineering man to whom she had
been given in marriage.</p>
<p>Why he should have married her was a question that she asked of
Heaven daily. He had wearied of her so soon. In the unrestrained
indulgence of an insatiable sensuality, he had put upon her
indignity after indignity by the very flagrancy of his
infidelities, until she knew herself for an object of contemptuous
pity. Yet, like the dog in the fable, guarding the grass for which
it had no appetite, he had ever been swift to display a vain man's
jealousy if the dainty charm of her which had staled for him
exercised the least allurement over other men.</p>
<p>Therefore, accustomed though she was to being used as a
contemptible pawn in his schemes, her surprise at his present
commands almost outweighed her indignation. It seemed to her that
she could not rightly have understood him, and she said so.</p>
<p>'Must I always explain myself?' He wondered impatiently 'Can you
never perceive anything for yourself? I desire this soldier freely
at my house. But I do not want it suspected that it is my company
he seeks or keeps. Do you understand now?'</p>
<p>Shame resuscitated in her a spark of the spirit that once had
been hers. 'I understand.' She threw up her chin, and stood
straight and tense. 'But you shall not put my honour in pawn for
any of your schemes.'</p>
<p>The rebellion took him entirely by surprise. His heavy black
brows went up. He stroked his shaven, masterful jaw.</p>
<p>'Shall I not? Ha! Shall I not? Are you not my wife?'</p>
<p>'Your wife? Your Countess, if you please. No more than that. In
the eyes of the world...'</p>
<p>He interrupted her. 'Just so. It is with the eyes of the world
that we are concerned.'</p>
<p>'And in the eyes of the world you will play the part of the
complacent husband? You? And for this purpose I am to act the
wanton...'</p>
<p>She was allowed to go no further. Experience should have warned
her of the futility of opposition to his wishes. His hand took her
by the wrist. It was a hand as powerful as it was hideous: a short,
round paw of stubby fingers and diminutive nails. Its mangling
grip, that seemed to crush bone and sinew, made her writhe in pain.
She bit her lip, to stifle an outcry. His light eyes narrowed in a
cruel smile, as if he gathered a sadic pleasure from the physical
suffering he inflicted.</p>
<p>'Madame, these are matters for my decision; not for yours. You
understand what I require of you.' Derisively he ran on: 'You have,
I know, a high opinion of your charms. They have been&mdash;have
they not?&mdash;so often extolled by the gallants I have never
known you reluctant to encourage. Do not be reluctant now. Exert
those charms. Take joy in the freedom I give you to practise your
natural feminine arts. You have not only my leave, but my
command.'</p>
<p>He released her, and she shrank away from him, nursing her
mangled wrist. A dry sob broke from her, whereupon with a laugh he
changed abruptly from arrogant cruelty to nauseating cajolery. He
came to pat her shoulder.</p>
<p>'There, there! What's to cry for? Where was the need to provoke
me? To be stupid? You know that in my heart I am fond of you,
whatever I may say or do.' His tone became more coaxing. 'After
all, it is a little thing that I ask. Do you suppose I relish it?
Do you know me so little as that after all these years? It is
really worse for me than for you. But great issues hang upon it. We
men of state are no better than slaves. Slaves of duty. There,
Valrie! I count upon you.'</p>
<p>She made him no answer beyond a shudder. But with that he was
content.</p>
<h3>&mdash; ii &mdash;</h3>
<p>Monsieur de La Bourdonnaye counted confidently upon the dread of
him in which his Countess went. But if the accident of circumstance
had not served him here&mdash;and procured not the make-believe he
commanded, but reality&mdash;he would have counted vainly on this
occasion, so nauseating was the task to the dignity and purity of
his lady.</p>
<p>As if Fate conspired to serve the Frenchman, it happened that
the Countess was seated at that banquet, as became her rank, on the
right hand of Camillo Petrucci, who presided, and that she found
Ser Colombino on her left. There was, therefore, no need to create
the opportunity for an assault upon the Captain's sensibilities.
The opportunity was presented to her ready-made. But because of her
repugnance to grasp it, her husband's satisfaction was soon dashed.
She sat mumchance, a white-faced, piteous little figure, answering
in monosyllables when addressed, her wits in a frozen paralysis.
And the more insistently her husband scowled command at her from
the table's farther end, the more firmly this paralysis enclosed
her.</p>
<p>Thus until Fate stepped in again to take a hand, and Colombino,
exercising himself to animate this petrification of womanhood
beside him, suddenly precipitated a situation actually in excess of
Monsieur de La Bourdonnaye's desires.</p>
<p>'Madame, you have bruised your wrist!'</p>
<p>Flung into panic by the discovery and the tone of solicitude in
which Colombino announced it, she hurriedly withdrew the hand that
had been resting on the board beside her plate. A hoop of
brilliants clasped about the empurpled flesh served to stress
rather than to disguise the bruise.</p>
<p>As the astonished glance of the tawny-headed young soldier
followed the retreating hand, he saw a tear merge with the
brilliants to sparkle amongst them a moment before vanishing.</p>
<p>'You are in distress, madame!' He spoke in a fluent French that
was softened by a Tuscan intonation.</p>
<p>The hum of voices, the clatter of dishes, the clink of glass,
the flitting of black-and-white livened servants, the music of
flute and viol from the gallery overhead, all served to cover the
sharpness of his exclamation. But the expression on his
countenance, as he leaned towards her, was visible. It was one of
pitying tenderness, and Monsieur de La Bourdonnaye from the
distance, perceiving only the tenderness and missing the pity, was
relieved at last. His Countess was behaving with unostentatious
obedience.</p>
<p>What she was saying to him, with her wistful little smile was:
'It is nothing, sir. I beg that you will not give heed.'</p>
<p>'Not give heed? Not give heed to the distress of a lady? Of a
lady so sweet and gentle?'</p>
<p>He spoke without hint of illicit gallantry. The deference of his
tone contradicted any assumption that his words were those of an
amorous opportunist.</p>
<p>'Countess, if I can serve you in any need, you have but to
command me,' said that servant of chivalry.</p>
<p>She flashed him a sudden, frightened glance. It was not in her
experience that men made such proposals without hope of guerdon.
The grave sincerity of his regard reassured her in part. Yet her
answer was not entirely without mistrust.</p>
<p>'Mine is no need that you can serve.'</p>
<p>But the very words, the very sadness of the voice, beckoned him
further along the road from which she sought to wave him. Pondering
ever that discoloured wrist, his clear-cut, shaven face grew set
and stern. All that was knightly in him surged up now, dispersing
the listlessness that had lately hung about his spirit. The thought
of Samaritana, though she might be lost to him, came to him in that
moment as an encouragement. She must commend his chivalrous
interest in this lady's wrongs, his purpose to discover and to
right them.</p>
<p>'I ask myself what bracelet you have lately worn, madame, what
gyves. A man's hand might have done that. What do I say: a man's? A
beast's, perhaps. If you were to tell me, madame, I might so
dispose that you would be safe in future.'</p>
<p>Her panic increased. She could not guess what might be her
husband's design; but from his odd anxiety to mantle it, she must
assume that it boded no good to Messer Colombino. Horror of the
vile part of a decoy was deepened as she looked into the face of
this young soldier, so stern in all but the dark eyes, which were
gentle and tender. Suddenly she perceived the adventitious opening
offered, and took her decision.</p>
<p>'You may so dispose, indeed, if you will do as I shall ask you.
This bruise, sir, was suffered on your behalf.'</p>
<p>'On my behalf?' He was aghast. By his tone he almost seemed to
draw hack.</p>
<p>Across the room she met her husband's glance, watchful again and
menacing. She swung to confront Colombino more squarely. She set
her hand familiarly upon the grey velvet sleeve of his doublet, and
startled him by speaking on a note of strident laughter.</p>
<p>'In pity laugh with me. We are watched. Laugh, Monsieur
Colombino.'</p>
<p>He was quick to understand. The counterfeit laughter on her lips
and the terror in her eyes made it very plain, and he laughed as he
was bidden whilst listening to what else she had to say.</p>
<p>'Presently, when we rise, when the dancing comes, could we not
slip away? Then I will tell you all.'</p>
<p>'It shall be contrived,' he promised her, whereupon both laughed
again, as if at some quip that had passed between them. And they
laughed so frequently thereafter that more than one eyebrow was
raised and more than one nudge exchanged to see Colombino, who had
been so staid and dull of late, grown of a sudden so merry with
this Frenchwoman.</p>
<p>At the end of supper came a party of mummers to perform a
comedy. After this the musicians in the gallery were reinforced,
and the floor was cleared for dancing.</p>
<p>Monsieur de La Bourdonnaye led forth the wife of Camillo
Petrucci, whilst Petrucci himself looked round for Madame de La
Bourdonnaye. He discovered that Colombino had forestalled him.
Because he loved Colombino as a brother, he smiled upon what in
another he would have resented as a presumption. If he smiled no
longer when presently it was perceived that the Captain and the
exalted lady who was the guest of Siena had left the hall, at least
he leapt at no such assumptions as Malavolti came to mutter in his
ear.</p>
<p>'Our captain and these French grow a thought too fond of one
another.'</p>
<p>Petrucci shook his dark young bead. 'There's no ground for
scandal. I know enough of Colombino's present mind to acquit him of
gallantries.'</p>
<p>'That is the mischief.'</p>
<p>The mischief?'</p>
<p>Just God! Is it obscure? We know the real purpose of the
Frenchman's presence in Siena.'</p>
<p>Petrucci understood. He laughed the suspicion to scorn.
'Colombino is pledged to us.'</p>
<p>'Reluctantly, you'll remember. His heart is not in it. We have
his own word for that. Do you begin to suspect why? There might be
more profit in other service.'</p>
<p>Petrucci frowned in displeasure. Their political rivalry apart,
he cared little for Malavolti. 'Colombino is pledged to us,' he
repeated, his tone significant.</p>
<p>'The Frenchman may bribe him to break the pledge.'</p>
<p>'He may try, you mean.'</p>
<p>'He may succeed. After all, a mercenary is a mercenary'</p>
<p>'And therefore he need not have bound himself to us, although he
is a Sienese. Having done so, that is the end of the matter. To
break with us now would be a treason to the State, and Colombino is
no traitor.'</p>
<p>'He is the son of one. These things run in the blood.'</p>
<p>But now Petrucci became angry, and showed it. 'Colombino is my
friend. Who insults him, insults me. Will you remember that,
Malavolti?'</p>
<p>'I'll remember it. Nevertheless, I'll keep a watch on him. The
matter is too grave for assumptions. Where is Colombino wandering
with the lady? And why does La Bourdonnaye remain so calmly
indifferent of a disappearance that is in danger of rendering him
ridiculous? Is there no clear inference? Has she not been deputed
by her husband to do that which her husband hesitates to do openly
himself? May it not even be that she is to ensnare the senses of
our captain? Men who are not to be bribed by gold into dangerous
paths will tread them, nevertheless, to pursue a yielding
woman.'</p>
<p>Petrucci kept his temper by an effort. 'You began by saying that
the matter is too grave for assumptions. What else do you offer me?
I'll need a mind as foul as yours to heed you.'</p>
<p>He swung on his heel, and left Malavolti staring after him with
a smile on his full lips and a frown at the base of his hawk
nose.</p>
<p>Outside, on the balustraded terrace above the fair garden behind
the Communal Palace, Colombino paced beside the little Countess.
There was not even the warmth of a summer night to excuse their
conduct, for autumn was now at hand, and the air was chilly. But
Madame de La Bourdonnaye heeded this as little as the proprieties
that must condemn her. Pacing there at his stalwart side she told
him everything. And this without recklessness; for, as she pointed
out, she accomplished two objects at one and the same time. She
made herself safe with her husband by this apparent compliance with
his orders, and she made herself safe with her honour and her
conscience by this full revelation.</p>
<p>Colombino's speculations upon the French envoy's motives were at
present stifled by concern for the lady. But when he began to
express it, he found himself checked by her.</p>
<p>'Monsieur Colombo, I had a little comedy to play with you.
Chance has helped me at least to play it honestly. That is all. I
do not desire to be an object for your compassion.'</p>
<p>'I am an ambitious man, madame. I aspire to spurs. I am
impatient for them. Meanwhile, I do what I can to practise the
virtues of chivalry.'</p>
<p>'If I had not perceived that, monsieur, I should never have
employed such frankness with you. I thank you from my heart for
your courtesy and patience. I shall remember them...and you. Now,
let us go back.'</p>
<p>'I will ask you to remember also that if yet you should need me,
I am ready. Here is my pledge of it.'</p>
<p>He took her right hand from where it hung beside her, raised it,
and pressed his lips to the bruised wrist.</p>
<p>The tears mounted to her eyes, the tenderest of smiles parted
her sensitive lips as she looked down upon his bowed head, the
thick, tawny hair of it confined in a caul whose little jewels
sparkled faintly in the moonlight.</p>
<p>Curious glances met their return to the brilliantly lighted
hall, from the searching gaze of La Bourdonnaye to the disdainful
smile of Caterina Squillanti. The insolent beauty opened her mind
to Silvio Pecci, who hovered as usual about her.</p>
<p>'A timid mouse of a woman, to behold her. Yet from lewdness
borrowing courage to hunt a lion. There's no virtue in any
Frenchwoman.'</p>
<p>Silvio giggled. 'And no taste, it seems.'</p>
<p>The young marchioness looked him over with raised brows. 'Why,
Silvio, what's amiss with Colombino? He's too fine a man to waste
himself on such a ninny.'</p>
<p>'You say it but to vex me,' lisped the fribble. 'He has height
and thews; he needs them in his trade. But a helot, standing for
hire, an upstart, dissembling in arrogance a natural coarseness,
and reeking of the stables.' Fastidiously he waved a pomander ball
before his nostrils, as if imagination evoked the offending smell.
'Not a man whom my heavenly, fastidious Caterina should describe as
fine.'</p>
<p>She curled her insolent lip.</p>
<p>'Are you afraid I'll give you cause for jealousy?'</p>
<p>'Always. It is my haunting dread. But not where that swaggering
captain is concerned. He is well enough for Frenchwomen. I wish the
Countess joy of him.'</p>
<p>Monsieur de La Bourdonnaye wished not quite so much. Back in the
Salimbeni Palace that night he took his lady sharply to task.</p>
<p>'It was illusion I desired of you, madame. Not reality. You and
that Sienese springald between you have all but made a mock of
me.'</p>
<p>She shrank before the bitterness of his reproach. 'I did no more
than you commanded.'</p>
<p>'Than I commanded? Must I forever curse the day I mated with a
fool?'</p>
<p>Before his stupid injustice she was swept by a gust of almost
ungovernable rage. The emotion because rare was the more violent.
It lent her courage to answer him in scorn.</p>
<p>'If you conceive your honour touched, there is a ready way of
healing it. I do not doubt that Messer Colombo will be ready and
willing to give you satisfaction.'</p>
<p>This turned him livid. 'So! So! You do not doubt it, eh?' He
came close, and dominated her by his bulk if not by his height, for
she was almost as tall as he: 'What passed between you in the
moonlight, ninny?'</p>
<p>Terrified, already in anticipation feeling the blow she feared,
yet she gave her tortured soul the luxury of braving it. 'He kissed
this bruised wrist of mine and told me to remember if in any need
that he aspires to knighthood.'</p>
<p>She held out to him the hand he had maimed. For a moment, taken
aback by her audacity, he stood glowering upon her; then suddenly
he laughed, swung on his heel and left the room.</p>
<h3>&mdash; iii &mdash;</h3>
<p>Monsieur de La Bourdonnaye was content to leave the room when he
did because, from what his Countess told him, he considered that
his aim was achieved. The rest was comparatively no matter.</p>
<p>Three days he waited for what, it appeared to him, must be the
inevitable sequel: for Colombino to come, like a moth to a candle,
in quest of Madame la Comtesse.</p>
<p>Then, time being precious to him, his patience gave out. 'This
Sienese cockerel is a half-hearted gallant for all his big talk, or
else prudence makes him shy. A Frenchman in his place would have
been here upon the morrow But these Italians...Devil take me if I
shall ever understand them. It was for my sins, I suppose, that I
was sent to Italy' He sat gloomily considering, glowering at his
wife across the table at which they had just dined. 'Well?' he
thundered suddenly. 'Have you nothing to say?'</p>
<p>She jumped. 'What...what can I say?'</p>
<p>'Oh, nothing. Nothing. But there's something you can do.' He had
suddenly taken the resolve. 'You will pay our captain a visit
today.'</p>
<p>'I?' She stared at him with dilating eyes.</p>
<p>'Do not be alarmed. I do not mean you to go unprotected. My
presence shall curb his amorous fury. I have to talk to him. And
since in spite of your allurements he will not come to us, why, we
must go to him.'</p>
<p>'But if you are going, why do you require me?'</p>
<p>'Because, if I went alone, Siena would surmise what I do not
want it to surmise. Your going will make the visit appear to be one
of courtesy: a pleasure-trip to his vineyard.'</p>
<p>They set out a half-hour later, the Countess in a mule litter,
with the leather curtains drawn back, so that all the world might
behold her, the Count following on horseback, and followed in his
turn by a couple of grooms.</p>
<p>A ragamuffin stretched at full length and fast asleep in a
doorway opposite the Salimbeni Palace awakened suddenly just as the
little procession turned the corner, and went padding after it.</p>
<p>By narrow streets sparsely tenanted in that post-prandial hour,
the French party came to the Porta Tufi and the Convent of the
Olivetani, and so out of the city. In the heat of the afternoon
they toiled up the slopes of Montasco, swarming with peasants
harvesting the grape, and came by fragrant orange groves and lemon
groves at last to the four-square, rosy embattled house upon the
heights.</p>
<p>In the courtyard, where men-at-arms kept guard as if the place
were royal, grooms bestirred themselves to take charge of the
horses.</p>
<p>Within the cool shadows of the marble-paved hail, a young
chamberlain in black with a gold chain upon his breast despatched a
page to announce these illustrious visitors.</p>
<p>Then to escort them into the august presence of the great
condottiero came a corpulent, jovial fellow, splendidly dressed,
whose black eyes twinkled merrily, who spoke French like a Gascon,
and described himself as a Spanish captain in Messer Colombo's
service.</p>
<p>It was all very impressive to the Frenchman; but most impressive
of all, when at last they reached him in a setting made princely by
all that Italian art could furnish, was Colombino himself. Very
stately and handsome in a crimson houppelande that was embroidered
with gold, the Captain welcomed them to Montasco with the airs of a
prince. Protesting himself profoundly honoured by their visit, he
bowed low over the hand of the pallid, rather breathless
Countess.</p>
<p>An hour was wasted in compliments and courtesies and nothings,
in which Don Pablo, whom Colombino had retained, bore a gay part.
La Bourdonnaye began to grow impatient. The Spanish Captain's
presence rendered confidential talk impossible. So La Bourdonnaye
invented a sudden interest in viticulture, so very natural, after
all, in a Frenchman, alluded to the industry he had observed in
Messer Colombo's extensive vineyards, and begged his host to afford
him the opportunity of surveying them at greater leisure. Madame
was a little tired. It would be inconsiderate to drag her with
them. Therefore, she had best remain indoors, with perhaps Don
Pablo to entertain her.</p>
<p>With perfect understanding, and dissembling the dislike with
which Monsieur de La Bourdonnaye inspired him, Colombino led him
forth, across the courtyard, over the drawbridge to the terraced
height, whence the vineyards were all in their full view.</p>
<p>But it was not of vines or viticulture that they talked. The
Count began, in the French manner, with a world of compliments. He
spoke of Monsieur Colombo's great feats of arms; of his universally
recognized mastery of the art of war; of the magnificent
organization and equipment of the Company of the Dove. He alluded
almost in awe to Monsieur Colombo's defeat of the Venetian army
before Ravenna, and protested eloquently the high esteem with which
Monsieur Colombo was regarded by the King of France.</p>
<p>After these hors d'oeuvres he came to more substantial
matters.</p>
<p>He would be frank. War was inevitable in Naples as soon as the
winter was overpast, and the King of France would naturally support
the Anjou claimant. Monsieur de La Bourdonnaye was in Italy to
prepare the ground. From the Commune of Siena he could obtain no
satisfaction; Petrucci, Piccolomini, Malavolti, and the other
patricians all eluded him whenever he approached the subject. The
inference was clear, and not surprising. The Pope's Holiness would
be on the side of Aragon, and the Piccolomini influence in Siena
would either bring the Republic into line with the Pope's wishes,
or, at best, cause it to stand neutral.</p>
<p>It was, from his point of view, regrettable; but after all, once
it came to war, what mattered was not political support, but troops
and the man to lead them. Anjou, as Messer Colombo would have
heard, had already enlisted Piccinino and his free company. If to
this formidable support Anjou could add that of Colombo da Siena
and the Company of the Dove, no anxieties touching the issue need
then trouble them.</p>
<p>At this point Colombino interrupted the oration.</p>
<p>'I thank you for that compliment. But if you come to me with a
proposal, you come too late, as I have had already the honour of
informing you. I am pledged to Siena.'</p>
<p>'I know, I know, and the terms and the extent of it. But as I
have already told you, a monthly retainer may be determined at the
end of any month. Your patience, Monsieur Colombo. Hear, at least,
what the King my master offers.'</p>
<p>He paused, standing squarely before Colombino, hand on hip, his
big head thrown back on his short neck, and delivered himself
impressively.</p>
<p>'The proposal is a year's engagement at a stipend of two hundred
thousand ducats, and at the successful close of the campaign the
fief of Benevento with the title of Count. There is an offer, my
Lord Count of Benevento, that will set a crown to your career.'</p>
<p>Colombino's startled countenance was evidence of the impression
made upon him by this dazzling proposal. Monsieur de La Bourdonnaye
accounted all done but the signing. Then, to his infinite amazement
and disgust, the soldier, recovering his calm, slowly shook his
head.</p>
<p>'You do not overrate your master's munificence, my lord. And it
profoundly flatters me. But I can but answer yet again that I am
already pledged. Let us talk of it no more.'</p>
<p>La Bourdonnaye went white. His breathing quickened. Vertudieu!
You cannot mean that upon a mere legal quibble you will refuse a
greatness that rarely comes to a condottiero of twice your
years?'</p>
<p>'A legal quibble?' Colombino laughed. Did you ever hear of
Carmagnola, and how he fared at the hands of Venice in like
case?'</p>
<p>'There is no parallel. That was treason.'</p>
<p>'It was never proved against him. There was no trial. They lured
him away from the protection of his army, and took off his head. A
political assassination. And here at home, in this very Siena of
ours, we have the case of Gisberto da Correggio, a condottiero like
myself, in the pay of the State. Presumed guilty of communication
with the enemy, the Council sent him a courteous invitation to
attend a conference. He went to it, unsuspecting and almost
unattended. He was stabbed to death in the very council chamber by
order of my friend Petrucci. That is the way in Italy with captains
of fortune who do not observe the spirit as well as the letter of
their engagements.'</p>
<p>'But if you fear...'</p>
<p>'No, no,' Colombino interrupted quickly 'I do not say that, my
lord. It would not be true. It is merely to show you what would
happen if I were base enough to yield to the temptation of an offer
of unparalleled munificence. My duty, Lord Count, as I conceive it,
is to Siena, and from that duty I definitely tell you that I will
not be turned.'</p>
<p>Monsieur de La Bourdonnaye was in despair. His head was no
longer erect. It drooped, and he stood almost hangdog before his
host. But one last effort he must make to secure at least
something.</p>
<p>'I see that it would be idle to press you further into taking
service with Anjou. But if you will not serve with us, will you, at
least, not serve against us? Will you stand inactive during this
campaign, pleading ill-health or what you will?' He went on quickly
before Colombino could interject an answer. 'For this neutrality,
if Anjou is victorious, you may still have Benevento and the
countship. I am empowered to pledge the King of France to
that.'</p>
<p>Colombino, tall and straight, and the very embodiment of young,
athletic vigour, looked down upon him, smiling. 'Do I look sick? Do
you suppose the Fifteen would be in any doubt upon the nature of my
illness?' He took the Frenchman by the arm, and swung him round, so
that they might retrace their steps. 'Lord Count, you shall not
waste your time to tempt me further.'</p>
<p>By an effort Monsieur de La Bourdonnaye kept the signs of anger
from his face and bearing. This failure, coming in the train of so
many others that had marked his mission to Italy, was a bitterness
he could not swallow.</p>
<p>'At least, sir, give thought to what I have said. My offer is
not one to be lightly dismissed. Some way may open. Come to me soon
in Siena, and we will talk again.'</p>
<p>But Colombino shook his head. 'It were best there should be no
more visits between us, monsieur. Your journey to Montasco is
scarcely prudent. Be sure the Fifteen will not be in ignorance of
it, and Communes have been suspicious of captains of fortune ever
since Gisberto da Correggio's business. They are very prone to act
upon suspicion, and I care little for risks that are
fruitless.'</p>
<p>So justified were these fears of his that he was not the only
one who at that very moment was alluding to Gisberto da Correggio.
In his house in Siena, Camillo Petrucci was listening to Malavolti,
who had brought Antonio Piccolomini to support him.</p>
<p>'They are all of one breed, these captains of fortune.' the
patrician was inveighing. 'Who seemed more deserving of trust than
Gisberto da Correggio? And in this Colombo I tell you now that we
have another Gisberto.'</p>
<p>'I'll need proof of that before I begin to believe you;' said
Petrucci.</p>
<p>'Isn't it proof enough that the French envoy is with him now at
Montasco? Why should Monsieur da La Bourdonnaye give himself so
much trouble?'</p>
<p>'It is certainly suspicious,' Piccolomini agreed. 'You'll admit
so much, Camillo.'</p>
<p>'I will not admit it. You yourself entertained La Bourdonnaye,
and you, Malavolti. Are you then both to lie under suspicion of
conspiring with France?'</p>
<p>'We are members of the Fifteen. Proper persons to be sought by
an ambassador. And to what end did he seek us? To seduce us into
declaring for Anjou. Isn't that what he has gone to do at
Montasco?'</p>
<p>'Assume it so. What then? Did you succumb, Malavolti? Did you,
Antonio? Did any of us? Why, then, should Colombino? By what right
do you suppose it?'</p>
<p>'Because I know the breed, the corruptibility of these soldiers
who stand for hire. But there! You'll never heed a warning until it
is too late.'</p>
<p>'It would at least be prudent to keep his movements under
observation,' ventured Piccolomini, who stood fearing an
explosion.</p>
<p>Petrucci shrugged wearily 'Do so, by all means. But don't come
deafening me with your silly suspicions of a man whom I know to be
the very soul of loyalty.'</p>
<p>'Terrarossa's son!' said Malavolti, raising his eyes to
Heaven.</p>
<p>Petrucci looked at him sternly 'Terrarossa's son, as you say. I
would I could be as sure of your loyalty, Malavolti.'</p>
<p>The blood receded from that swarthy hawk face. Deep in the soul
of this man, who accounted himself the first among the patricians
of Siena, there had been dark stirrings of ambition. Under
Petrucci's stern, challenging eyes he was asking himself now
whether he had ever by incautious word or deed betrayed those still
inchoate aspirations.</p>
<p>'You dare say that to me!' he blustered, his voice hoarse.</p>
<p>Then Piccolomini got between them. He took Malavolti by the
arm.</p>
<p>'Come, come. In God's name! Will you two make a quarrel out of
this? What's to do, we know When we have something more than
suspicion we'll seek you again, Camillo.'</p>
<p>'I shall have to wait through eternity,' Petrucci answered them
as they departed.</p>
<h3>&mdash; iv &mdash;</h3>
<p>Monsieur da La Bourdonnaye came back to Siena in a vile humour,
a deal of which he vented upon his wife.</p>
<p>His failure with Colombino, which seemed so definite and final,
coming in the train of all the other failures he had made of his
mission, meant that he must return empty-handed to France. The King
his master would not be likely to heed explanations. That he had
been unlucky would not excuse him. Those who serve kings must know
how to control their luck. The Count saw nothing but disgrace ahead
of him.</p>
<p>Bitterly he set the blame of this frustration upon his wife. She
had been wanting, he told her, in allurement. Whilst by her conduct
with Colombino she had made her husband ridiculous in the eyes of
the Sienese as a potential cuckold, yet she had not known how to
render it effective. A woman of ingenuity, with half the parade of
wantonness that she had made, could so have enslaved the senses of
this young man that he would have become the creature of her will.
He concluded by desiring to be informed what good she was in life
and by his usual complaint that he was cursed for having mated with
a fool.</p>
<p>She suffered these infamous upbraidings in a stony silence, her
soul sick to death within her. One day, she knew, her senses would
burst from so much repression and she would go mad. Until then she
must bear this rough and heavy cross as best she could.</p>
<p>'It is the end,' he announced. 'I have failed here, just as,
thanks to you, I fail everywhere. If I were a coward I should not
return to France. For God alone knows what the King will have to
say to me. Anyway, in Siena there is no more to be done. We had
best pack and quit.'</p>
<p>He was moving towards the door as he spoke. On the threshold he
paused to turn and gloom upon her where she sat, awaiting some
retort that should justify a further indulgence of his wicked
humour. None coming from that white-faced, suffering woman, he
stamped out.</p>
<p>But it was not yet the end, as he had protested. Whilst his
servants packed, he brooded, cursing Colombino, whom, next to his
Countess, he now regarded as the chief author of his ills. If the
fellow would not serve Anjou, at least he might have consented not
to serve against Anjou. It was his refusal to stand neutral which
weighted the scales too heavily in Aragon's favour&mdash;for
Monsieur de La Bourdonnaye had no longer any doubt that Siena,
following the Holy Father's lead, would ultimately resolve to range
her forces on the side of Aragon. Neutrality was not much to have
solicited, and great was the price he had offered for it. Yet this
upstart captain of fortune had flouted him with a refusal, had
almost laughed at his offer.</p>
<p>Into his brooding came an inspiration that ripped the blackness
of it like a flash of lightning.</p>
<p>If Colombino's service could not be enforced, his neutrality
most certainly could be. Quite simply. In one way or another he
could be removed.</p>
<p>His company remained, a company which, with its auxiliaries,
Monsieur de La Bourdonnaye had carefully informed himself, was now
no less than four thousand strong. But, however numerous or
powerful, it remained an inert mass without the guiding mind of
Colombino. Nor was that all, as the Frenchman saw the matter. It
was long odds that once Colombino were removed, he would be
succeeded in the command of the Company of the Dove by one of his
present lieutenants; and with them it should be easy to make terms.
Sangiorgio was a Florentine, Caliente a Spaniard; so that neither
would be bound by sentimental ties to Siena, and neither would
consider himself under the engagement to the Republic into which
Colombino had entered.</p>
<p>His hopes began to rise again from their nadir. He slept upon
the notion, nor moved to act upon it until the following afternoon,
by when he had considered in detail what was to be done.</p>
<p>More than ever now he needed the collaboration of his Countess.
To secure it he sought her, and found her idling listlessly alone
in the long room of the mezzanine. He came to stand over her where
she sat, and for a long moment silently considered her with his
contemptuous, dominating glance. When at last he spoke it was on a
sneering note.</p>
<p>'What did you tell me that our captain said to you that night
when he slobbered on your wrist? Was it not that in your need you
should remember that he aspires to knighthood? Was it not?'</p>
<p>'It was,' she breathed.</p>
<p>'Well, well. Your need is now You shall send word of it to this
mirror of chivalry.'</p>
<p>She raised a white face from which weariness and misery had
almost crushed the last vestige of beauty 'I? Send him word?'</p>
<p>'It is what I said. Do you add deafness now to your other
infirmities?'</p>
<p>She strove for calm under his hateful smile.</p>
<p>'What is the purpose of this? What are you intending?'</p>
<p>He laughed. 'Are we alarmed for our ardent knight, our flaming
champion?' Then, lest his mockery should provoke obstinacy and so
give him trouble, he changed his tone. 'No need for any fears.
There is no harm intended him. No abiding harm. Listen, Valrie.'
He drew up a chair and sat down before her, his knees almost
touching hers. 'Listen carefully.</p>
<p>'We start at daybreak for Leghorn, where a ship is waiting to
take us back to France. If I am not to return under a cloud of
failure, to face the anger of the King, disgrace, and God knows
what else, something must be done. You will realize that. What I
can do is little enough when compared with what the King expects of
me. But still it is something. It will save me from returning quite
empty-handed. If I cannot bring Colombo into the service of Anjou,
at least I can prevent his going into the service of Aragon.' He
leaned forward, and set a hand impressively upon her knee. 'Let a
message from you fetch him here tonight, and he goes with us to
France.'</p>
<p>She would have risen then. But the pressure of his hand upon her
knee restrained her.</p>
<p>'How does he go? How?'</p>
<p>'How?' He was leering again. 'Have you no arts to draw him? Do
you not know how to beckon so that he would follow you to the ends
of the earth?'</p>
<p>'You know that he would not. Why do you mock me with this?'</p>
<p>'If he be, indeed, so insensible to your beckoning, as your
husband I must naturally resent that insensibility. I must compel
by force what you could not induce by sweetness. All that I need of
you is a message that will bring him here tonight.'</p>
<p>'You mean to ruin him, then?'</p>
<p>He shrugged. 'In the pass to which things have come, it is his
ruin or mine. Naturally I prefer that it be his. Perhaps you don't
agree with me. But that's no matter.'</p>
<p>An odd courage of defiance rose in her. 'Why should I agree with
you? Messer Colombo has never harmed me.'</p>
<p>From his expression she thought that he was going to strike her.
But he curbed himself. 'Ah! I shall remember that. I treasure up
these words of yours, madame. One fine day there will be a
reckoning.' He pushed back his chair, and rose, peremptory
'Meanwhile, the letter.'</p>
<p>He strode away to a writing-pulpit set in the light of the
window, beside a tall screen of brown leather heavy with golden
arabesques. He pulled open a drawer, and took from it
writing-materials: some sheets of parchment, an ink-horn, a
pounce-box, wax, silk, quills and a sharp, slender knife for
trimming them.</p>
<p>'Come, madame.'</p>
<p>But as, although she had risen, she still stood hesitating, he
raised his voice. Pques Dieu! Will you come, or must I fetch
you?'</p>
<p>Despising herself for yielding, she crossed the room with
dragging feet, and sank into the chair he had set for her.</p>
<p>He patted her shoulder now with that false cajoling tenderness,
more detestable to her than his roughness.</p>
<p>'Come, come, Valrie. You must help me in my need; for your own
sake as much as for mine.' He thrust a quill into her hand. 'Now
write,' and he dictated:</p>
<p class="letter">Messer Colombo&mdash;In dread peril and necessity
I recall your treasured words that in my need I should remember
that you aspire to knighthood. My need is now and terrible, else I
should never venture upon this boldness. By the chivalry of your
nature, by the knighthood of your aspirations, I implore you to
come to me at the fourth hour of night. We are leaving Siena. My
husband has already departed ahead of me for the coast, otherwise I
could not avail myself of the only help I know in all the world.
Come alone and in secret, informing none. Unless you do this, then
it were best for my honour's sake that you do not come at all. I
send you the key of the garden gate. That way you will not be seen.
I shall be waiting for you in the garden.</p>
<p>He placed a key upon the pulpit as he ended. 'Fold that into the
letter. But first, sign. Sign your full name.'</p>
<p>So far she had mechanically obeyed him, sobbing at intervals in
fear and grief; and he had smiled to see the irregular, straggling
hand, conceiving what colour this would add to the tale the letter
told of a woman writing in terror. But now, under his command to
sign, a sudden unconquerable repugnance assailed her. Nothing
should make her set her name to this piece of treachery that was to
lead to his destruction, perhaps to his death, a man who had used
her with an unselfish tenderness. No terror of this monster she had
married should bring her to consummate that vileness. Contemptible
had she been in writing a word of it. Rather should she have
suffered death. Again one of those rare gusts of rebellious rage
swept through her soul.</p>
<p>She flung down the quill, and rose, and in the very act of
rising put forth her left hand to seize and crumple that
treacherous sheet.</p>
<p>But as swift to guess her purpose as to thwart it, he caught her
wrist. 'What now?'</p>
<p>She stood face to face with him, and his eyes were terrible. But
they had lost the power to terrify. The martyr's spirit had entered
into her.</p>
<p>'I will not sign. I will be no party to your infamy'</p>
<p>He was standing with his shoulder to the leather screen, almost
leaning against it. 'You will sign,' he said quietly 'As there is a
God in Heaven, you will sign.' But if his voice was quiet, the rage
of him found expression in his hand. Again, as once before of late,
it seemed to her that bone and sinew of her delicate wrist were
being crushed to pulp. She swayed, half-swooning from the pain of
it, and he smiled cruelly in her eyes. 'Now sit again, and sign,'
he said with the quiet, mocking assurance of one who knows that
resistance is at an end.</p>
<p>Her left wrist in his grip, her eyes, oddly glazed, staring into
his, her right hand groped upon the pulpit, as he supposed, for the
quill, and his smile grew broader, his grip began to relax.</p>
<h3>&mdash; v &mdash;</h3>
<p>That letter came to Colombino at Montasco just as dusk was
falling. It disturbed him profoundly.</p>
<p>Little more than an hour ago Sangiorgio had ridden in from Siena
with an account of ugly rumours current there.</p>
<p>'It is being said that you have sold yourself to the French;
that, in spite of your engagement by the Fifteen, you will be found
if war comes on the side of Anjou. It is not nice. In a tavern by
Sant' Ovile I broke the jaw of a man who said that you are another
Gisberto da Correggio. He'll utter no more lies for a month or
two.'</p>
<p>Colombino stared at him. 'In God's name, why should they say
this?'</p>
<p>'You have been too close with the French envoy is their
explanation. He is known to have been seeking you here at Montasco.
The foul minds of your fellow countrymen cannot suppose the visit
innocent.'</p>
<p>Colombino thought of his father, and fetched a sigh. Always
because of the sins of his sire must he earn distrust. The Devil
take rumour,' he laughed at last. 'Let it run until it chokes
itself.'</p>
<p>'Ay, ay. But be discreet, child. Now that you know what it feeds
on, do not harbour relations with this Frenchman.'</p>
<p>'It's not my intention, as I've already told him.'</p>
<p>And now, so close upon the heels of that, came this appeal from
the Frenchman's lady. He pondered it awhile, then ordered his
chamberlain to introduce the messenger, a lackey out of livery. He
questioned him closely; but all that he elicited was that the
fellow had the letter from the hand of the Countess with orders to
ride hard, and that the Count had set out already for the coast, to
take ship.</p>
<p>Colombino dismissed him, and considered further. He had
misgivings. With rumour already accusing him, if it were known that
he had gone secretly by night to seek Madame de La Bourdonnaye, not
even her husband's absence might prevent his accusers from seeing
in this thing done by stealth the proof of their suspicions. They
would assume that the Countess was acting as her husband's deputy;
that the Count's departure that same day was merely a strategic
movement to mask his aims. Upon less evidence than this Gisberto da
Correggio had been put to death. After all, knowing how La
Bourdonnaye had once sought to use his wife, remembering the mood
in which La Bourdonnaye had last left him, could he be sure that
those assumptions would be utterly without foundation?</p>
<p>That on the one hand. On the other was his compassion for the
Frenchman's ill-used lady. He remembered the bruised wrist. A
vision of Samaritana rose before him. The desire to deserve of her
an esteem which he might never earn because she would never know of
those deserts, the knighthood of his aspirations to which the
letter alluded, the chivalry to which he had erstwhile pledged
himself, put it upon him not to set a possible danger to himself
above the possible danger of the gentle lady who appealed to him
for help.</p>
<p>In the end he called for his horse and his arms, and set out
alone through the deepening night.</p>
<p>Thrice as he rode, he drew rein sharply to listen; for it seemed
to him that there was too persistent an echo to his horse's hoofs,
where he had never before observed an echo. Then he told himself
that never before had he had occasion to observe it, for never
before had he ridden alone this way in the dead of night. And yet
the sense that he was being followed persisted.</p>
<p>At the Tufa Gate, which was closed when he reached it, his
identity proved a sufficient passport. He left his sweating horse
at the gatehouse, and went on afoot through the silent streets, to
his destination. It was just upon the fourth hour, which is to say
it wanted about an hour to midnight, as he entered the narrow lane
that ran behind the Via Flavia.</p>
<p>The key fitted smoothly. The tall door in the garden wall swung
noiselessly inwards. He entered, closed and locked the door again,
and stood a moment listening among the shrubs. A footfall in the
lane outside renewed in him that suspicion of a follower. Was the
ever mistrustful Council already watching his movements as a result
of those rumours which Sangiorgio had reported?</p>
<p>The question was swept from his mind by a movement near at hand.
A shadow loomed beside him, a light hand touched his arm, and he
heard in a trembling whisper the voice of Madame de La
Bourdonnaye.</p>
<p>'God reward you for answering my prayer, Monsieur Colombo. Come
with me.'</p>
<p>The house before them stood in darkness, save for a light from
one of the windows of the mezzanine. But tapers were burning in the
hall, to light them up the wide staircase. She led the way in
silence. He followed closely. The stillness of the house was
natural at an hour when all would be abed.</p>
<p>The long room of the mezzanine into which she ushered him was
ablaze with light. Coming from the gloom, he was for a moment
dazzled by it. Two golden candle-branches, in each of which burned
a dozen tapers, stood upon the walnut table in mid-apartment. The
illumination seemed to him absurdly excessive.</p>
<p>As she softly closed the door, he turned to face her. Instantly
his heart smote him. Her cheeks were of a deathly pallor, her eyes
swollen with weeping and set in dark stains which rendered very
piteous their appeal. She shook so violently that she seemed
scarcely able to stand, and there was a world of meaning in the
pressure of her hand upon her heaving breast.</p>
<p>In a stride he was beside her.</p>
<p>'Calm, madame; calm, I beseech you. I am here to serve you,
whatever be your need.'</p>
<p>And he was a figure to inspire confidence, his stalwart vigour
stressed by his raiment. His hose was of brown leather and of brown
leather was the close-fitting tunic buttoned to his very chin over
a slender shirt of mail. He removed his dark blue cloak, and tossed
it aside with his hat, as if making ready for whatever the
emergency might demand.</p>
<p>'Tell me your need of me, madame.'</p>
<p>She attempted to speak. But her voice rattled hoarse and
inarticulate. She made a beckoning movement, and dragged herself
towards the writing-pulpit, he following, indeed, almost in step
with her. Having reached the pulpit, she staggered aside to make
room for him, waving him on, and pointing with her shaking hand to
the space behind the tall leather screen.</p>
<p>Obediently he advanced, and then recoiled again. He turned his
head to question her with startled eyes; then resolutely he stepped
forward once more.</p>
<p>Behind the screen lay the Count de La Bourdonnaye, supine, at
full length, a grin on his blue lips, whilst his glazed eyes stared
up at the frescoed ceiling.</p>
<p>Colombino went down on one knee beside him and verified that he
was quite dead. The breast of his doublet was soaked with blood,
and from the left side a white, slender, ivory haft protruded.
Colombino took it between finger and thumb, and drew it forth. From
that haft sprang a blade, slender and sharp for the trimming of
quills. It was quite short, yet long enough, as it appeared, to
have reached the heart of Monsieur de La Bourdonnaye.</p>
<p>He stood up, and came out again into the open. Gravely he looked
into the distraught face and tragic eyes of the Countess. Because
she was swaying where she stood, supporting herself upon the back
of the writing-chair, he went compassionately to set an arm about
her shoulders. For a moment she nestled against him, shuddering and
sobbing; then, at once conducting and supporting her, he led her
away and set her in a tall armchair that stood by the table. On the
table's edge he perched himself, so that he immediately faced her.
He addressed her calmly in the hope of inducing calm.</p>
<p>'Compose yourself, madame. How did this happen? Tell me.'</p>
<p>The question that she asked him supplied the answer.</p>
<p>'What do they do in Italy to parricides? To women who kill their
husbands? Do they send them to the fire?'</p>
<p>'So. You killed him,' said he, quietly as if the stabbing of
husbands were the most ordinary of occurrences. 'Well, well, that
need surprise no one who knew him, and his ways with you. There is
your wrist, and...But what is this?' He had caught her left hand,
and surveyed the evidence of a fresh brutality.</p>
<p>Forth now, in a voice broken at first by sobs, but gradually
growing steadier, came the tale of that afternoon's events, to the
point where, maddened by pain and by his brutal insistence, her
fingers idly groping on the pulpit had closed upon that frail
pen-knife. Scarcely knowing what she did, acting upon wild impulse,
she had plunged it into his breast. She had not meant to kill. She
had not meant anything. She was, she explained piteously, a
desperate, agonized creature without intelligence, acting upon
blind instinct.</p>
<p>He soothed her. He stroked her arm and then her little dark
head, as a brother or a father might have done, and so at last
encouraged her to continue.</p>
<p>'He fell there where he lies, behind that screen. I sat in
terror at the pulpit, and so I must have sat for a full hour before
I realized that he was dead, expecting him at every moment to rise
up and kill me. Then a servant came in quest of him. I told him
that my lord was from home, that he had gone out alone and might
not return for a day or two. I scarcely knew what I was saying.</p>
<p>'After that my wits began to work again. I understood, and I was
spurred on by a new dread. The treacherous letter he had made me
write lay there before me. I realized that the lying need of which
it spoke had suddenly become the truth; that chance had made you my
only friend in Siena; and that my only hope lay now in your
chivalry.</p>
<p>'And so, at last, I signed the letter, and despatched it: the
letter he had dictated. Little he thought in what circumstances his
words were to be used to summon you, or that the events would make
true the lies he compelled me to set down.' A shiver ran through
her. 'Oh, my God! My God!' She clutched his arm with both her
hands, and again came that fearful question: 'What do they do to
such women? How do they punish such crimes in Italy?'</p>
<p>'Crime?' he echoed. 'Child, this is no crime.'</p>
<p>'Not in your eyes, who know But who else will believe my tale?
Monsieur Colombo, help me. I implore you. In the sweet name of Mary
the Mother. I have endured so much. My life has been so sad and
ugly. Let me go end my days in a convent. But do not let...'</p>
<p>He was on his feet, at her side again, his arm once more about
her shoulders, drawing her against his flank. 'Hush! Hush! There is
nothing to fear. Nothing. Give me but time to think. Let me
consider well what is to do. But comfort you, meanwhile. I shall
find a way. Be sure I shall find a way.'</p>
<p>When, however, he came to give it thought as he paced to and
fro, his chin upon his breast, he discovered a weakening of the
confidence with which he had sought to inspire faith in her. And
meanwhile she sat huddled in her tall chair, following him with
eyes of hungry, piteous hope.</p>
<p>Thus until a loud knocking below, reverberating through the
silent house, came to startle them both. She came to her feet, only
to sink down again, limp and terrified.</p>
<p>The knocking continued, more peremptory and accompanied by
shouts of command, until hastily aroused servants went to open.</p>
<p>Thereafter the house grew full of sound: the stamp of feet, the
clank of arms, the clamour of voices. It came surging up the
staircase like a tide, and broke violently into the long room of
the mezzanine.</p>
<p>The invasion was headed by Malavolti, with, at his heels, the
lean, austere Petrucci, the grizzled Piccolomini, and the elderly
florid Marquis Squillanti. After these came three other members of
the Council, and behind these again a half-dozen men-at-arms in
steel caps and corselets.</p>
<p>Their eyes swept negligently over the woman, crouching
terror-stricken in her chair, and settled upon Colombo, who stood
beside her, straight as a lance, his tawny head bare, his glance
arrogantly questioning, his hand by instinct on the hilt of his
heavy dagger.</p>
<p>The sight of him seemed to give them pause. He had the
impression as of a gasping recoil in them, and he was vividly
conscious of the dismay and sorrow that overspread the ascetic
countenance of Camillo. Then it was to Camillo that Malavolti
turned, and what he said was merely the ruthless expression of what
was in the minds of all of them.</p>
<p>Now, my doubting Thomas, let your eyes assure you. There he
stands, caught in his treachery; another Correggio, selling his
country and his masters; another Judas. Do you need more
proof?'</p>
<p>Petrucci stood dumb and stricken, whilst from the others came
snarling execration to an ominous accompaniment of the soft,
tinkling slither of weapons plucked from their scabbards. A
movement towards Colombino was already beginning when he checked it
by his question.</p>
<p>'Will you tell me what this means, my masters?'</p>
<p>Petrucci roused himself to answer him, at the same time flinging
out an arm like a barrier to restrain the others. There were
undertones of anger in the sorrow of his voice, a reflection of
scorn in the sadness of his eyes.</p>
<p>'It is rather for you to explain your presence here, Colombino,
at dead midnight, having come in secret and alone, slinking in by
the garden gate with the key that was sent to you.'</p>
<p>'You set a watch upon me, do you?'</p>
<p>'It had become necessary in the view of some. I was not of
those. I was too foolishly trusting, persuaded that your loyalty
would be proof against any bribe that might be offered.'</p>
<p>'You see,' said Malavolti. 'It was in our knowledge that bribes
were being offered. This very day we intercepted a letter from the
King of France to his envoy here, urging him at need to increase
the price he was to pay you. It is idle to protest. We but waste
words.' And his glance eloquently invited action.</p>
<p>But again Colombino contrived to stay them, and this time by a
laugh. 'I see. I see. And so, you poor witlings, you men of little
faith and less intelligence, to you proof that a bribe was offered
is proof that I accepted it. You reason like statesmen, as God
lives.'</p>
<p>Squillanti, heavy and massive, took a hand. 'And your presence
here, is that proof of nothing? The manner of your coming? Does
that look like honesty? Does a man with nothing to conceal enter a
house like a thief in the night?'</p>
<p>And Malavolti added: 'Will you quibble in the face of death, you
lying traitor?'</p>
<p>The mutter behind him became an uproar. 'Enough words! Let him
go the way of Correggio!'</p>
<p>'A little patience, sirs,' Colombino begged them. 'You've all
night in which to murder me. But you had better hear something from
me first, rather than discover it for yourselves afterwards, or you
may be following me down to Hell rather sooner than you think.</p>
<p>'It is quite true that I came here secretly; like a thief in the
night, as you say, Squillanti. Quite true that I came to hear what
the King of France might have to propose to me.'</p>
<p>'You give us news,' sneered Malavolti fiercely</p>
<p>'I think I shall do. News of how I answered.'</p>
<p>'Are we to take your word for that?' demanded Piccolomini.</p>
<p>'Not unsupported. I can supply some evidence. Look for
yourselves.'</p>
<p>He stepped quickly back, pulled away the screen, and let it
crash forward flat upon the floor.</p>
<p>They stood at gaze, aghast, and their very breathing seemed
suspended.</p>
<p>After a moment Colombino spoke again.</p>
<p>'For any man who hurt my honour with assumptions that I could be
seduced from my pledged allegiance, what other answer could there
be but this?'</p>
<p>They sucked in their breaths again. Their awe of the deed was
transmuted into awe of the doer. There was a shuffling stir amongst
them, and suddenly Colombino found himself gripped in Petrucci's
arms.</p>
<p>'That I should have doubted!' was Camillo's penitent cry. 'That
I should have let myself so easily be persuaded! You may forgive
me, Colombino; but I never shall forgive myself.'</p>
<p>'On my soul,' Squillanti was growling, 'that is my case,
too.'</p>
<p>'And mine,' said Piccolomini.</p>
<p>Malavolti stood shamefaced. 'I am the worst offender of all. I
confess it frankly. My wits have led me astray. But there's an
amend to make, and it's for all of us to make it: to stand as a
bulwark between Colombo and the wrath of France at his noble, this
truly Roman answer to a seducer.'</p>
<p>They were loudly swearing it, swarming about him, heaping
blessings on his name, when at last he drew their attention to the
Countess, still crouching there, white-faced and terrified,
scarcely believing yet that the lightning by which she had thought
to be blasted had been deflected.</p>
<p>They fell silent then and grew ashamed of their heartless
boisterousness in the presence of the widow. Malavolti waved away
the men-at-arms. Then with his brother patricians he bowed low to
her, very solemnly, and with them departed.</p>
<p>Colombino lingered still when all had gone. He had still a word
to say to the Countess. Her very action now showed him how
necessary it was. For whilst their steps were still upon the
stairs, the murmur of their muted voices in the air, she suddenly
rose and came with sobs to cast herself at his feet, to seize his
hand and bear it to her lips.</p>
<p>'What do I not owe you? What do I not owe you?' she was
wailing.</p>
<p>He took her by the arms, and drew her gently up. 'I see that you
have not understood. What I did was to save myself as well as
you.'</p>
<p>She shook her distracted head. 'If I had not sent for you, you
would have been in no such need. Every night of my life I shall
thank God that I did, and for what you did. Every night I shall
pray for you. What else have I with which to repay you but my
prayers?'</p>
<p>'It is very noble payment, madame; far greater than the deed
deserves. But this remains, madame. Listen. You will be departing
now to France. I must not see you again before you go. I must not
linger even now For in the eyes of those men it remains that I am
the slayer of your husband. And any relations of mine with his
widow must hurt either her honour or the belief in which those men
have taken their leave. Therefore, I can do no more, and I can stay
no longer.'</p>
<p>'I understand,' she said, 'I understand.' But her eyes were full
of sorrowful bewilderment.</p>
<p>He released the arms he held, and took her hands. 'God guard
you, madame, and bring you yet to happiness.'</p>
<p>Then, as he stooped to bear her hands to his lips, she snatched
them away, took his tawny head between them, and kissed him on the
mouth.</p>
<p>Afterwards he was wont to say: 'I had my knighthood from
Ferdinand of Aragon, and it was the Queen of Naples who buckled on
my spurs. But it was the kiss of Madame de La Bourdonnaye that
bestowed upon me the knightly accolade.'</p>

<h2><a name="ch-06" id="ch-06"></a>Chapter 6. THE LADY OF
CANTALUPO</h2>
<h3>&mdash; i &mdash;</h3>
<p>The history books will tell you that Monsieur le Comte de La
Bourdonnaye died of an apoplexy. That is what Siena was told and
France believed, since his widow confirmed the tale on her
return.</p>
<p>In Colombino's career that death marks a definite step and is
directly responsible for all that followed, so mole-like is the
burrowing of Destiny to her ends. What an ordinary faith in an
ordinary loyalty would not have earned him was earned him by the
reaction of the Fifteen from their mistrust. In his loyalty, had
they never believed him disloyal, they would have seen no more than
the commonest duty which he owed the State. As it was, they came to
regard him as steel that has been tested in the furnace, and they
so magnified him that when the buds were breaking in the following
spring and the rumblings of war at last exploded, nothing would
content them but that he should be given the supreme command,
appointed Captain-General of the allied forces of the Pope and the
Sienese which were ranged on the side of Ferdinand of Aragon.</p>
<p>The Marquis Squillanti, a soldier of experience who had been
Gonfalonier of Holy Church, had some claims to that exalted office,
and might, through the Holy Father, have swayed the Piccolomini and
the Petrucci into admitting those claims now. But even he, under
the general spell, waived his rights in favour of Colombino and
consented to take service under him.</p>
<p>The appointment is said to have moved the scorn of Jacopo
Piccinino, that famous rascally soldier-son of a famous rascally
soldier-father, who commanded on the Angevin side. Boastingly he
announced that it was clear the gods desired to destroy the House
of Aragon. Not only was he in great force, having recruited heavily
in the Cantons, but the King of France, it was known, was sending
an army by sea to his support, so that presently his preponderance
should be overwhelming. At once to facilitate his junction with
this French force when it arrived, and to mark his contempt of his
opponent, he chose to march south with his Swiss auxiliaries along
the western seaboard, ready to deliver battle upon Roman soil
whenever it should be offered.</p>
<p>Now whilst this march of Piccinino's across enemy country may
have been marked by some violence and depredations, yet it had no
quality of conquest or occupation. He would not waste his strength
in the Pontifical States by attempting to reduce strongholds which
he would have to garrison. Avoiding all minor engagements, and
keeping to the plains, he moved steadily south, husbanding his
resources for the conquest of Naples and for the battle which he
would have to fight when Colombino at last decided, as Piccinino
supposed that decide he must, to dispute his passage.</p>
<p>The odd thing was that Colombino showed no such inclination. He,
too, was moving south, but parallel with Piccinino, and at a
distance which he showed no disposition to diminish. Whilst
Piccinino hugged the shore, and went unchallenged by Ostia and
Ardea, Colombino kept beyond the hills, coming down by Arsoli and
Subiaco, content through the eyes of his far-flung scouts to watch
the progress of his adversary.</p>
<p>Soon it began to be said that Piccinino's unchecked advance
could be explained only by hesitations on Colombino's part. Of what
was he dreaming? If things continued thus, Piccinino would
presently be playing havoc within Neapolitan frontiers,
intimidating the barons into throwing in their lot with Anjou so as
to avoid the destruction of their fiefs.</p>
<p>In Rome the Holy Father was blaming himself for having permitted
the Sienese to over-persuade him in the matter of the supreme
command. In Siena there was a growing dismay at the supineness of
their chosen leader. In Naples, Ferdinand of Aragon grew
apprehensive where hitherto his confidence had been buoyant. In
general there was a free expression of the opinion that the greatly
vaunted and hitherto fortunate Colombo da Siena was revealing the
poverty of his mettle now that at last he found himself opposed to
a really experienced soldier. Of the many who announced it in
laughter, none laughed with greater relish than the lady of the
Neapolitan fief of Cantalupo, a lady who once had been Countess of
Rovieto.</p>
<p>Tagliavia, in his <i>History of His Own Times</i>, says of this
Madonna Eufemia de' Santi whom he opines might with greater
propriety have been named Eufemia dei Diavoli&mdash;that she was
perhaps the sweetest morsel ever used by Satan to bait a hook for
man's perdition. Considering the delicate, winsome beauty Antonello
da Messina painted&mdash;in the picture that already has been
mentioned&mdash;you feel that here was a lady who must have drawn
most men to be her slaves, be it by awakening the chivalry of some,
or by arousing the less exalted emotions of others.</p>
<p>It may be that such women are the victims of greater temptations
than their less favoured sisters. It may be that the evidences time
brings them of their power lures them irresistibly to abuses of it.
In this may lie all the secret of the frailty which Tagliavia
discovers beneath the saintly aspect of Madonna Eufemia.</p>
<p>We have seen of what vindictiveness was capable this lady who
without consciousness of duty was overconscious of her rights. We
know what was her resentment of Colombino's just indignation and
withdrawal from her service. That she had abundantly provoked it
weighed for nothing with her. In regarding it as a treachery, she
was possibly sincere. And that resentment festered in her. It
festered the more as she saw this detested man pass so easily from
strength to strength until he stood acknowledged the first captain
in Italy. It put a climax to her rage to hear of his appointment as
Captain-General of the forces of Ferdinand of Aragon. The greater,
therefore, was her exultant relief when already the initial stages
of the campaign were revealing that he had accepted a burden to
which his shoulders were unequal. And this notwithstanding that the
man she had now married held his fief from the House of Aragon and
was therefore heart and soul on the side of King Ferdinand.</p>
<p>He was a septuagenarian, no less, this Marquis of Cantalupo,
this Lord Amedeo degli Amedei, who had taken to wife a woman not
yet thirty. It was in Florence, six months ago, that he had come
under the spell of her enchantments, and had cast away the prudence
with which through seventy years of life he had been equipping
himself. He ignored the slurs unkindly rumour set upon her fair
name, was deaf to the implication that she possessed arts of
ensuring widowhood when her capricious nature began to find a
husband tiresome, and that an old man of seventy was not likely
long to be tolerable to her lively, ardent nature.</p>
<p>The truth, if that old gossip Tagliavia, is to be believed, is
that she found him scarcely tolerable when she led him to the
altar. But whilst she might have commanded all the lovers that her
heart could desire, it was not likely, that being a little
tarnished, she could easily have commanded another husband who,
like Cantalupo, would raise her again to the high estate from which
she had fallen when the Scaligeri drove her out of Rovieto.</p>
<p>Less tolerable still did she find him when he disclosed his
attitude upon the outbreak of war. Loving his ease and good cheer,
and being of the opinion that he had reached an age at which a man
is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of these blessings, he
decided, like many another Neapolitan baron, to hold aloof from the
coming strife. She did not mince words. She had never learnt to do
so. She described his attitude as pusillanimous. She would have him
spend himself, his health and his gold, in raising men so as to
support the Anjou claimant, and this although his sympathies were
avowedly with Aragon.</p>
<p>It was not that it mattered to her whether Anjou or Aragon ruled
in Naples; but it mattered very much to her that all the odds
should be piled upon the side against which Colombino fought, so
that this insolent upstart should at last be overthrown.</p>
<p>The common talk that Colombo da Siena was obviously
outgeneralled, unable or unwilling to come to grips with the
formidable Piccinino, brought her at last the dear assurance that
there was no cause for her anxieties and that her fondest wishes
were about to be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Even among Colombino's officers some murmurings began to make
themselves heard, and at Segni, where the army lay one April night,
under the shoulder of Lepini, whilst Piccinino was beyond that line
of hills somewhere in the neighbourhood of Nettuno,
Squillanti&mdash;urged to it, no doubt, by letters from
Siena&mdash;came to reproach Colombino with his inaction.</p>
<p>Colombino received him in a room of the cottage which he had
made his quarters. He heard him in silence. Then he spread a map
upon the table.</p>
<p>'You are a soldier of great experience, Lord Marquis. Propound
me a plan.'</p>
<p>Squillanti, with the facility and light-heartedness of the
critic, propounded three in quick succession, blushing for each in
turn when Colombino had demonstrated its unsoundness. After that he
was disposed to sulk. He was a stolid man of a full, powerful habit
of body, round of face with a small, pursed mouth and the bluest of
eyes under dense black eyebrows. His hair was grey and he cropped
it short. He was close upon fifty years of age, but very vigorous
in spite of a slight lameness from a wound taken in one of his
early campaigns.</p>
<p>'It is easy to find fault,' he grumbled.</p>
<p>'It is what I desired you to understand,' said Colombino.</p>
<p>'Yes, yes. But what plans have you?'</p>
<p>'None yet. But I have a hope. If that bears fruit, my plans will
take shape of themselves. I have studied Piccinino's methods. He
has one only strategy. I am making it easy for him to apply
it.'</p>
<p>For the rest, he announced, he would not be urged or bullied. He
would act in his own time and in his own way. He was in command,
and the responsibility lay with none but himself. He would know how
to discharge it.</p>
<p>When, however, on the very next day, a Sunday, his scouts
brought word that Piccinino was marching south at speed,
Squillanti's excitement was not to be curbed. Without ceremony he
burst in upon the Captain-General who sat in council with
Santafiora and Caliente. He raved that before night Piccinino would
be at Terracina, on Neapolitan soil, that already it was too late
to stop him.</p>
<p>'It is,' said Colombino. 'I agree with you in that.'</p>
<p>His calm was a goad to Squillanti's fury 'The man has outwitted
you!' he declared.</p>
<p>'It is what everyone will suppose. Especially Piccinino.'</p>
<p>'Will they be wrong, sir? Will they be wrong?' The Marquis
banged the table. 'Answer me.'</p>
<p>Colombino did not answer. He was listening to something other
than the voice of Squillanti. A horse furiously ridden came to a
rattling halt outside the cottage.</p>
<p>'That may be Nervo at last,' he said, his eyes on
Santaflora.</p>
<p>The Florentine went to open, and an officer sprang in, and
breathlessly delivered himself without preambles.</p>
<p>'He left Nettuno at peep of day'</p>
<p>'Yes, yes. We've known that for some hours. But the
galleys?'</p>
<p>'Galleys? What galleys?' interjected Squillanti.</p>
<p>'Four Papal galleys that Piccinino seized in Nettuno yesterday.
Four light vessels of fifty oars. Well, Nervo?'</p>
<p>Two of them have put to sea, one going straight out into the
west, the other steering northwest. They were out of sight when I
left. A third has gone forth, following the coast at a distance of
a couple of leagues. The fourth is at anchor outside the bay, just
off Point d' Anzio. One of Piccinino's officers is on each, and
Bernardone is in command of the galley that has remained at anchor.
Apart from their rowers each is very lightly manned, a score of men
at most.'</p>
<p>Colombino nodded, musing. 'You are very well informed,
Nervo.'</p>
<p>'I went down into Nettuno after they had left. There was no
difficulty in gathering the information.'</p>
<p>'Anything else?'</p>
<p>'Nothing else, Sir Captain.'</p>
<p>'Excellent.' Colombino rose. 'It but remains to follow
Piccinino, and as ostentatiously as possible. About it, sirs.'</p>
<p>Sangiorgio and Caliente went briskly out. Nervo, being
dismissed, followed them. Squillanti lingered.</p>
<p>'There's no time to lose, my lord,' Colombino admonished him.
'We march within the hour.'</p>
<p>'Better late than never, I suppose,' the Marquis grumbled, since
to this he could offer no objections.</p>
<p>But he had some objections to offer that same afternoon. For
instead of marching down the valley where the going was direct and
easy, Colombino sent his army toiling westward over the hills
towards the sea, and rolled it down the slopes of Lepini as if
marching on Nettuno, in full view of Bernardone's galley where it
rode at anchor a mile or so from the shore.</p>
<p>'Do you do this so that Piccinino's captain may laugh at you?'
wondered the irritated Squillanti.</p>
<p>'Will he laugh, do you suppose?'</p>
<p>'I can almost hear him.'</p>
<p>'Why, let him, then. It is the last laugh that counts, my
lord.'</p>
<p>As after that they drove south, on the heels of Piccinino,
Squillanti had no more to say until the morrow.</p>
<p>They had come by then to Terracina, and Colombino's scouts
brought word that Piccinino stood before Gaeta. Sangiorgio,
Caliente, and Squillanti were with the Captain-General. They made a
mounted group on a green eminence whence they could look out over
the sea smooth and sparkling in the April sunshine. Colombino,
standing in his stirrups, shading his eyes with his hand, scanned
the horizon on which the Pontine Islands were faintly visible.
Beyond those and some brown-sailed fishing boats in the middle
distance, there was nothing to be seen.</p>
<p>'We will take to the hills again,' he announced, and added in
answer to Squillanti's stare, 'so as to afford them some more
matter for laughter.'</p>
<p>The army, proceeding without haste, turned its back upon the
sea, and moved inland once more, until by dusk they had come to the
foot of the valley to the east of Mount Lepini, from which they had
earlier emerged.</p>
<p>'Some day,' said Squillanti, 'I shall understand all this. I
suppose that we are really making war, and not just strolling about
in the hills to amuse ourselves.'</p>
<p>'We are not pausing here,' said Colombino.</p>
<p>'I feared we might be.'</p>
<p>'No, no. Sangiorgio will bivouac here tonight with a thousand
men; a mixed force, horse and foot, pikemen and crossbowmen. From
here, strictly maintaining the same distance between himself and
Piccinino, he will move as Piccinino moves, but always keeping to
the hills and woods, so that Piccinino shall not have cause to
suspect that less than my entire army is moving with him.'</p>
<p>'And the army itself?' asked Squillanti.</p>
<p>The answer took away his breath, convinced him that Colombino's
wits had left him. 'That army goes north again, to encamp at the
spot we left yesterday morning, before we marched down to
Nettuno.'</p>
<p>'But, by all the devils...'</p>
<p>Colombino interrupted him. 'I have told you that Piccinino has
only one trick of strategy.' And to soothe Squillanti he now
proceeded to explain it.</p>
<h3>&mdash; ii &mdash;</h3>
<p>In a day in which victories were seldom more than strategic,
Piccinino was perhaps justified in crowing victory because having,
as he put it, eluded the forces of Colombino, he had crossed the
border and had come to stand upon Neapolitan soil. And so that no
doubt should remain in the public mind on the score of this
victory, and also so that the temporizing Neapolitan barons should
be brought to perceive where their interest lay, the little
Perugian&mdash;Piccinino was a native of Perugia&mdash;in a manner
worthy of the traditions inherited from his sire, seized several
minor townships, and delivered them over to pillage and rapine by
his mercenaries.</p>
<p>Secretly jubilant at these excellent beginnings of misfortune
for Colombino, the Lady of Cantalupo found in the events an
argument with which to whip her lord into declaring for Anjou.
Cantalupo was an important fief and the influence of its Marquis
was considerable. If he declared for Anjou, many other barons who
stood waiting upon events would follow his example, and this
defection from Aragon would further diminish Colombino's already
very slender chances of recovery.</p>
<p>The difficulty lay in that Cantalupo was staunchly loyal to
Aragon.</p>
<p>If the burly, phlegmatic, rather dull-witted Marquis could even
listen patiently to his sweet lady's persuasions, it was only
because of a fond reluctance to offer opposition to any whim of
hers. Like most elderly men in his case, he was of a doting
uxoriousness. By submission to her every caprice, he sought to make
amends for all that age and increasing infirmities compelled him to
deny her ardent temperament. Indulgence of her present caprice was,
however, a thought too dangerous even for his uxoriousness. But
whilst unswervingly determined to hold by King Ferdinand, he could
not, he dared not, give that determination utterance. He took
refuge from her displeasure in a display of temporizing. Before
declaring himself against the House of Aragon and his vassalage, he
preferred, he protested, to wait and see what shape affairs
assumed.</p>
<p>'You'll wait too long,' she warned him, and he winced at the
tartness of her voice. 'Will you wait until Piccinino is before
your walls?'</p>
<p>He was a large, gross, jovial fellow, bald and florid, who, as I
have said, loved good cheer and laughter. He advertised these
predilections in his guffawed reply.</p>
<p>'If so, I shall not wait an instant longer.'</p>
<p>He pulled her with good-natured roughness to his massive knee,
and chuckled as he fondled this slight, lovely object of his
worship, who might still have seemed a child to a much younger man
than Cantalupo.</p>
<p>'You treat me lightly,' she complained. 'And I deal with serious
matters. Let me go.' She struggled with him. But he held her in a
hug that was like that of a bear, and kissed her resoundingly,
however much she might seek to strain away from him.</p>
<p>'Will you sulk and frown because I'm not such a fool as to make
rash engagements? It may not be very noble in me; but believe me,
it is very prudent. One of the lessons age teaches is that prudence
is better than nobility. The first is a necessity in this world;
the second a mere adornment.'</p>
<p>'That is a hateful creed,' she condemned him.</p>
<p>'Maybe, child. Maybe.' He chuckled again. 'But it makes for your
security as well as mine. Be thankful then.'</p>
<p>'That I've mated with a coward?'</p>
<p>'Coward! Pshaw! Words break no bones, child. Kiss me, and let us
change the subject.'</p>
<p>'I tell you this is serious. When Piccinino stands before your
walls, where then will be my security?'</p>
<p>Piccinino! Pooh! He's a long way off. At Benevento, and not
likely to move northward. So long as we don't invite trouble, our
peace here isn't likely to be disturbed. The war will be fought out
round Naples.'</p>
<p>This was her cue; this, and his earlier cynical assertion that
if Piccinino were to appear before his walls he would not wait an
instant longer to declare himself. She perceived, she thought, how
she might force his hand.</p>
<p>That same night she wrote a letter to the Angevin commander,
inviting him to come to Cantalupo. The Marquis, she explained, was
utterly devoted to the House of Anjou, but he needed a pretext to
declare himself. His so declaring himself must result in materially
strengthening the cause by ensuring the adherence to it of many who
now hesitated. Therefore, so that Cantalupo might save his face,
she urged Messer Piccinino to make the necessary demonstration in
force.</p>
<p>Next morning, in the town, she found a messenger secretly and
swiftly to bear that letter to the Angevin captain in his camp at
Benevento.</p>
<p>No answer could have been more prompt. Four days later Piccinino
appeared before Cantalupo with a detachment of a thousand helmets,
having left his camp and the main body of his army in the charge of
his Lombard Captain Castrocaro.</p>
<p>The news of his approach filled the old Marquis with alarm. He
remembered the brutalities perpetrated elsewhere by Piccinino's
soldiery. There proved, however, to be no cause for his fears.
Piccinino's lances rode in orderly fashion up the main street of
the little township to the massive grey castle above, as if assured
of welcome there.</p>
<p>With a dull anger in his heart, and taking bitter shame in
secret at the extent to which he was practising his philosophy of
preferring prudence to nobility, the Marquis left his drawbridge
lowered and his gates wide, and waited bareheaded in the courtyard,
his winsome lady beside him, to give courteous welcome to the
soldiers of Anjou.</p>
<p>Amid all his secret chagrin, he had at least the satisfaction of
perceiving that he ensured the immunity of his fief from damage.
For when quarters had been found for the troops, a stern injunction
to them was issued by their leader to be orderly in their
behaviour.</p>
<p>For Piccinino himself and a couple of officers in immediate
attendance upon him, the best rooms in the castle were instantly
made ready.</p>
<p>The Marquis, pursuing his detested role, exerted himself
ingratiatingly to entertain his unwelcome guest. In this he was
supported by his lady with an affability which at first he assumed
to be as entirely counterfeit as his own, but which within a day or
two he perceived to be entirely real. This perception went to
increase his resentment of Piccinino's presence and his detestation
of the condottiero, about whom, when all is said, there was little
that was engaging.</p>
<p>Like his father before him, who, as the name implies, had been a
little man, Piccinino was short, bow-legged and sturdy, a coarsely
featured, hairy fellow, with the speech and manners of a
stable-boy. In this uncouth exterior, however, Madonna Eufemia's
fastidious daintiness seemed to perceive nothing repellent. She
fawned upon the soldier almost from the hour of his arrival.</p>
<p>On his first night at Cantalupo, whilst they sat at table after
supper, she fell to praising the astuteness with which he had given
Colombino the slip and crossed the Neapolitan border; she even
lauded the policy of atrocities by which he had struck terror into
the temporizing barons; and generally she expressed an unstinting
admiration of his shining soldierly qualities and a firm confidence
in the ultimate triumph awaiting the Angevin arms under so able a
leadership.</p>
<p>The Marquis listened to all this, writhing in secret torment, a
false frozen grin upon his lips, whilst Piccinino, deprecating the
praise in a manner which yet accepted it as no less than his due,
preened himself under the discernment of this exquisite lady. They
spoke of Colombo da Siena. Madonna was of the confident opinion
that the knell of his fame was already sounding.</p>
<p>Piccinino was contemptuous in his agreement. 'What is this fame
of his? A bubble blown by insolent fortune.'</p>
<p>'Indeed, indeed! In the past he has enjoyed easy successes, only
because he has never yet been face to face with a real soldier. Now
that in you, Ser Jacopo, he meets a master of the art of war, he
falters and stumbles in the very first steps of the campaign. And
he will go on faltering and stumbling. For I have cause to know
that under his swaggering exterior, this impudent upstart carries a
heart as craven as it is treacherous. The triumph that awaits you,
Ser Jacopo, is scarcely worthy of your splendid prowess.'</p>
<p>Whilst the Marquis suffered a spasm of nausea at the grossness
of the flattery, Ser Jacopo bowed, intoxicated. Then, turning to
his host, he cast over his swagger some lingering rags of
modesty.</p>
<p>'Your reception of me at Cantalupo, my lord, will have done a
deal to smooth my path. In declaring so stoutly against the Aragon
bastard, you have set an example which every cravenly hesitating
Neopolitan baron will be sure to follow.'</p>
<p>The Marquis grunted agreement with a fact that was a torment to
his soul. Then he eased himself of some of his secret spite.</p>
<p>'Yet, sir, I almost wonder whether to ensure this, it could be
worth your while to leave your camp and come to Cantalupo. As a
consequence, you might easily lose more than you are gaining.'</p>
<p>Piccinino's black brows came together in a frown. 'I take your
meaning. But...' He curled his lip and tossed up his stumpy hands
in a gesture of contempt. 'I am but two days from Benevento. And I
have time to spare until the landing of the French.' And now, as he
proceeded, he disclosed his aims, disclosed that stroke of
strategy&mdash;the only stroke in his repertory, according to
Colombino&mdash;by which he counted upon annihilating the enemy.
Vainglory, and the desire dazzlingly to display himself under the
stimulating eyes of Madonna Eufemia, were responsible for the
disclosure. 'When I set out to march south along the seaboard, I
had no other object than to be at hand to receive the French
reinforcements. To await them, I would have halted at Nettuno or
Terracina, or between the two, if that timid fool Colombo da Siena
had not supplied me with the opportunity so to dispose that at a
blow I can bring this campaign to an end. I took the chance to slip
past him, and cross the border. But from Nettuno I have flung my
scouts in galleys out to sea, to meet and inform the French of
this, and to bring their army to land at Nettuno, or thereabouts.
When that happens, I will turn, and it will then be found that
Messer Colombo's army lies between those troops and mine like a nut
ready to be cracked between two stones. Unless his compatriot Saint
Catherine works a miracle for him, Ser Colombo will then realize
the mistake he made when he suffered me unchecked to cross the
border.' He laughed, and Madonna Eufemia laughed with him, and
clapped her slim white hands like an excited child. 'Battles, sir,'
the condottiero ended, stabbing the table with his knotty
forefinger, 'are won by positions. And so well placed am I that
this battle yet to be fought is won already. Meanwhile, I can wait
at my ease. And my ease could nowhere be better served than here.
So here, by Bacchus, I'll wait for word of the French landing, in
grateful enjoyment of your bounteous hospitality.'</p>
<p>He raised his cup to pledge them; but it was to Madonna Eufemia,
rather than to her lord, that he had addressed his closing words.
And whilst Cantalupo's jaws were set in unobserved disgust, his
lady answered for him.</p>
<p>'And here, sir, you have loyal, cordial friends, who will be at
pains to beguile the tedium of your waiting.'</p>
<p>This was his cue for an impudent gallantry which the presence of
her old husband was powerless to repress in him.</p>
<p>'In your presence, madonna, tedium beguiles itself; or rather,
tedium can have no place.'</p>
<p>He had, you see, pretensions to gallantry, this Piccinino,
notwithstanding his bow-legged clumsiness, and he had not been slow
to perceive in the Lady Eufemia an object worthy of its exertion.
So sweet and frail she appeared to him, and so virginal, despite
the fact that she was now in her third nuptials, and so subtly did
she seem to beckon him that quite early in his sojourn at Cantalupo
that rascally little mercenary found himself in an infatuation.</p>
<p>To the Marquis he gave little thought, and this little was
contemptuous. He took the view that when a senile dotard marries a
young wife, he must be prepared for the consequences of his
presumption; and this view he was at no pains to dissemble. He
would loiter in the evening with the lady upon the ramparts, taking
the air which to any but lovers would have seemed chill, for the
weather had turned cool again in those mid-April days.</p>
<p>Cantalupo, observing this flagrant courtship of his wife by this
ruffian, and his wife's wanton acceptance of that courtship,
accounted himself bitterly punished for a defection to Anjou which
it had not been in his unfortunate power to avoid, and which he
could no longer mend. But, at least, he departed from his fond
uxoriousness. In remonstrating with her, he no longer humoured her.
He was uncompromisingly stern. Yet not on that account did he
prevail. He merely aroused impatience in her and a cruel
insolence.</p>
<p>'Are you in case to defend me from him? He has a thousand men at
his back, and here in Cantalupo he is master. You are stupidly
tiresome in your reproaches. Will you accept the consequences if I
openly rebuff him?'</p>
<p>'Gladly As Heaven is my witness!' With that oath, he fell to
pleading again. He implored her to remember at once his honour and
her own dignity, and not to suffer the insult of this coarse
clown's advances.</p>
<p>At this she tossed her golden head. 'I do not perceive the
insult. He uses me with all respect. You should remember that he
would be a very dangerous man to thwart. And since for all your big
words, I cannot depend upon you for protection, I must use such
arts as I possess to keep him within reasonable limits. In short,
sir,' she concluded, her nose in the air, 'like you, where your
loyalty was concerned, I temporize, remembering your creed that
prudence is better than nobility.'</p>
<p>At this the unfortunate Marquis raved in exasperation; and the
lady with a tinkling laugh and a shrug for his tantrums, went off
to render herself once more accessible to the condottiero. Nor in
her temporizings, as she called them, was she even as circumspect
as she would have her husband believe. When at the end of a week of
skirmishing, Piccinino attempted to carry the lady by assault, she
stayed him by an implied promise.</p>
<p>'First prove your worth, Ser Jacopo.'</p>
<p>'What proof will satisfy you, my beautiful?'</p>
<p>'The defeat and capture of this Colombo da Siena. When you shall
have broken him, I shall refuse you nothing.'</p>
<p>Any man less smugly fatuous than Piccinino must have perceived
here the secret of her wantonness: that it lay not in any love of
himself, as he so fondly imagined, but in hate of Colombino. He was
to be no more than the instrument of its gratification. In the
wound which Piccinino's self-love had taken and the jealousy
aroused in him by the swift rise to fame of the Sienese captain,
she had espied her opportunity to square to the full her accounts
with Colombino. In the stimulus which she thus applied to
Piccinino, she became the stoutest alloy of Anjou.</p>
<p>By the Eyes of God,' Piccinino swore, 'I'll lay him in bonds at
your feet, so that you may do your pleasure with him.' And on the
strength of that promise he advanced upon her and caught her in his
hungry arms.</p>
<p>She was still struggling in his embrace when the Marquis came
upon them. The spectacle turned him white. He rolled forward on his
massive legs, dropped a heavy hand on the condottiero's shoulder,
and faced him, his feet planted wide, his bald head shaking with
passion. His voice was hoarse.</p>
<p>'You push your demands upon my hospitality somewhat far, Ser
Jacopo.'</p>
<p>Piccinino's laugh blended sheepishness with insolence. 'What the
devil! If you will lay such tempting viands before a guest, can you
blame him for his appetite?' And on that he sauntered, swaggering,
away.</p>
<p>Cantalupo, affronted to the very depths of his soul, burning to
take that coarse mocker by the throat, and agonized by the shame of
the common prudence that restrained him, fell to upbraiding his
Marchioness. But here, too, insolence and scorn were all he
gathered.</p>
<p>'Are we to have all this again? Is it my fault that he
manhandled me? You saw that I was struggling with him.'</p>
<p>'And I saw that you laughed whilst you struggled, which is a
wanton's way to ask that her struggles shall be overcome.'</p>
<p>She withered him with her sarcasm. 'Your years should not give
you licence to insult a woman because they leave you unable to
protect her.' And on that she, too, departed.</p>
<h3>&mdash; iii &mdash;</h3>
<p>The April days that followed, if they sped pleasantly, although
tantalizingly, for the condottiero in his inconclusive dalliance,
were days of an almost intolerable agony to the Marquis.
Dishonoured by Piccinino whose advent had constrained him to
disloyalty to his suzerain, he lived on the edge of further
dishonour in his private life, and he was as helpless to avert the
one as to avenge the other. Yet out of prudence, he must dissemble
his hatred of this ravisher of his peace, give him courtesy and
entertainment. In this burning purgatory it remained for him only
to pray for the speedy landing of the French, so that he might be
delivered of his detestable guest.</p>
<p>Fervently was he at this continuous prayer, when in the dusk of
a rainy April evening, some two weeks after the coming of Piccinino
to Cantalupo, a courier rode a spent horse into the courtyard of
the castle, reeled exhausted from the saddle, plastered from head
to foot with mud, and hoarsely demanded the Angevin commander.</p>
<p>It happened that the Marquis was in the guardhouse at the time,
and heard the call. It also happened that there were none but men
of his own present in the courtyard. He kept at Cantalupo a
garrison some fifty strong, serving little purpose but that of a
guard of honour.</p>
<p>The Marquis stepped out into the rain, thrust aside those of his
men who were surrounding the courier, and, with a solicitude so
extraordinary that he would delegate the care of the fellow to none
of his people, took him by the arm, and conducted him within
doors.</p>
<p>Within the cavernous hall, where in the lamplight trophies of
arms glittered on the grey walls, the Marquis halted.</p>
<p>'You bear letters?'</p>
<p>'For Messer Jacopo Piccinino.'</p>
<p>'Give them to me.'</p>
<p>'I am to deliver them into the Captain's own hands.'</p>
<p>'I am the Marquis of Cantalupo. I will take them to him, whilst
my people care for you.' He held out his hand, his voice peremptory
'Give me the letters.'</p>
<p>The courier still hesitated for a moment, then overawed by the
rank of this big old man, he produced and surrendered a sealed
package.</p>
<p>The Marquis summoned Bosio, his castellan, delivered the courier
into his care with orders to see to his needs. Bosio led the man
away. But other orders must have followed, for the courier was
never heard of again.</p>
<p>Cantalupo went to shut himself in his closet. What he did was
dangerous. But there was no risk he would not run if it gave him
the means of squaring accounts with that villain Piccinino. With a
thin-bladed knife he contrived to raise the seal intact, and made
himself master of the contents of the letter. His old eyes
glittered as he read, a smile shaped itself round the corners of
his shaven mouth. Then he burnt the parchment in the flame of the
taper by which he had read it, and went to supper with a more
pleasant air than he had worn for several days, and a manner
towards his guest that was almost cordial. Thereafter he grew still
more tolerant, and the smile was not effaced from his lips even
when in his very presence the increasingly impudent Piccinino
hovered with wooing ardour over Madonna Eufemia.</p>
<p>Thus for four days, and then the end came. It arrived in the
shape of news brought one evening when they were snugly at supper.
The bearer was no ordinary courier, but one Fidelio, an officer of
Castrocaro's, the Lombard captain who had been left in command of
the camp at Benevento.</p>
<p>His peremptoriness of manner imposing upon the officer at the
gate, he was conducted at once by Bosio to the supper-room, a small
chamber that communicated directly with the main hall of the
castle, the bleakness of its grey walls relieved by the glow from
the heaped logs on the cowled hearth.</p>
<p>The tall, soldierly Fidelio, who bore upon his leather-clad
person the evidences of having ridden hard, found a Piccinino in
whom he hardly recognized the hard-bitten little captain of the
Angevin forces. Rendered foppish for once in his amorous ardour,
the condottiero was tricked out in a flaming surcoat of crimson
velvet, with the glitter of a jewel or two to enhance his finery,
and so much at his ease that it was evident he had no thought for
the activities of war.</p>
<p>If the sight of him thus wrought an odd change in the messenger,
the sight of the messenger wrought no less of a change in
Piccinino. He was on his feet at once, brisk and eager in his
instant assumption.</p>
<p>'You bring me word that the French have come at last.' Fidelio,
standing within the doorway with Bosio at his side, opened his eyes
to gape amazement.</p>
<p>'Bring you word, sir?' His tone was that of a man who does not
believe his ears. And again: 'Bring you word? That word you should
have had four days ago. It is because there is no answer from you
that Castrocaro has sent me.'</p>
<p>'Plague take you, man! Of what are you talking? I have had word
of nothing.' Then, sweeping that aside for what he considered the
weightier matter, 'but the French, sir?' he demanded impatiently
'The French? Have they come?'</p>
<p>The answer was a thunderbolt. 'The French, sir, have come...and
gone.'</p>
<p>'Come, and gone? What sense is there to that? Damn your soul,
man, can't you deliver a plain tale?'</p>
<p>Piccinino stood, a truculent, scarlet figure, leaning upon the
massive back of the chair from which he had risen. Beyond the table
the Lady Eufemia, her fair, pallid loveliness stressed by the gown
of black velvet that sheathed her slim body, with a glow of rubies
at her breast, leaned her elbows on the board, to listen. The
Marquis sat hunched in his chair, his chin upon his breast, his
eyes watchful under his bushy grey eyebrows, his countenance
expressionless.</p>
<p>As the messenger began to speak, a look of intelligence passed
between Cantalupo and his castellan. Covertly the Marquis made a
sign with his left hand, whereupon Bosio slipped unobtrusively from
the room.</p>
<p>Fidelio advanced, and brought forth his dreadful tale.</p>
<p>Yves de Bressan, the French commander, guided by the galleys
that had been sent out to scout for him, safely brought his little
fleet into Nettuno, and had landed there his army some eight
thousand strong, between horse and foot, and all splendidly
equipped.</p>
<p>'But Colombo da Siena,' he proceeded, 'whom we all supposed to
be leagues away in the territory of Naples...'</p>
<p>'Supposed it?' Piccinino interrupted furiously 'Supposed it?
Castrocaro's scouts reported Colombo's army in the hills by Mignano
at the time of which you speak.'</p>
<p>'They were deceived, as Colombo meant they should be, by a
detachment which he sent forward for no other purpose than to
hoodwink us. The main body of his forces, which Bernardone reported
to have seen marching south, must have doubled back; for when
Bressan landed at Nettuno, Colombo was in strength behind Lepini,
watching and waiting for him. That incarnate devil must have
guessed the purpose of the galleys you sent out from Nettuno.'</p>
<p>'Do you tell me that Bressan was surprised?' Piccinino had
turned pale. 'Had the fool no scouts?'</p>
<p>'He was given no chance to employ them, no chance to do
anything. No sooner were his forces ashore than Colombo came down
the hills like an avalanche. It seems that he...'</p>
<p>'Never mind what seems! The facts! Give me the facts!'</p>
<p>The facts were that the French were not even given time to form
order of battle before the impact. With their back to the sea,
unable to retreat, they stood panic-stricken to receive a blow that
shattered them completely.</p>
<p>And this Sienese devil,' Fidelio ran on, 'violating all laws of
civilized warfare wrought fearful havoc with his crossbowmen,
slaughtering recklessly. The battle lasted not above four hours.
Then Bressan surrendered with the five thousand men that remained
him. Stripped of arms and armour, their horses and equipment
appropriated&mdash;an enormous booty&mdash;they are now on their
way to Rome. For this Sienese dog has actually refused to observe
even the common practice of setting prisoners free after disarming
them.'</p>
<p>It was the end of the tale, and a silence followed. Piccinino
was speechless. His bearded countenance had turned a nasty yellow;
his limbs trembled as if an ague possessed him. He sat down
heavily, and took his head in his hands.</p>
<p>Fidelio, having paused for a long moment, now roused his captain
and further maddened him by the announcement that this was not by
any means the worst of his news.</p>
<p>'Captain Castrocaro bids me report, sir, that since he sent you
word five clays ago of these events, Papal galleys have come to
cruise off Gaeta, completely cutting off our communications with
France, whilst Colombo da Siena, with strong reinforcements from
Rome, is advancing from Capua, following the course of the river
Volturno. Captain Castrocaro has formed the opinion that Colombo's
aim is to place our camp at Benevento between himself and King
Ferdinand's Spanish forces at Naples. He urges you, sir, to return
at once to Benevento so that you may yourself take order against
this peril.'</p>
<p>Piccinino, who had listened in a seethe of rage, his hands
clenched upon the arms of his chair, his jaw set, found at last a
vent for his passion.</p>
<p>'Ges! Is he an addle-head, this Castrocaro, that he waits there
in this jeopardy? Any but a numskull would not have sent this
message, but would have come himself, with the army at his heels.
To fall back to the north is the obvious countermove, so as to
avoid being surrounded. As there is a God in Heaven, it seems that
I am served by idiots!'</p>
<p>Pale and limp sat the Lady Eufemia, almost as distracted as
Piccinino himself by this blow to all her vindictive hopes.</p>
<p>The Marquis, who throughout had remained immovable and
inscrutable, stirred at last. He spoke in a tone of elaborate
commiseration.</p>
<p>'Almost, Ser Piccinino, it looks as if the tables had been
turned: as if suddenly it is yourself who, in your own image, are
become the nut between two stones: a nut ready to be cracked.'</p>
<p>The condottiero's tortured, blood-injected eyes stabbed his host
with a glance that was all malevolence. Smiling a little, the
Marquis continued.</p>
<p>'Almost does it seem, too, as if the strategic victory of your
invasion of Neapolitan territory had been Colombo's and not yours.
I mean, as if he had deliberately permitted it, so as to draw you
into this trap.'</p>
<p>This was too much for Piccinino. He rose violently, his face a
livid, snarling mask.</p>
<p>By the living God, have you the courage to mock me?'</p>
<p>'Mock!' The Marquis affected dismay, spreading big red hands as
if to repel the notion. 'Why, I am all commiseration. I but remark
what all Italy will be saying tomorrow, if it is not saying it
already.'</p>
<p>This was to turn the sword in the wound. The smart of it, whilst
maddening Piccinino, yet made him look more closely to the hand
that wielded the poisonous weapon. A suspicion of Cantalupo's
secret, malevolent exultation begot in him yet another suspicion,
which instantly became a conviction.</p>
<p>'So, you false, treacherous jackal of Aragon, it was for this
that you lured me here! So that my leaderless army, left in charge
of a fool, might the more readily be taken in the snare preparing
for it!'</p>
<p>The Marquis heaved himself to his feet. He plucked off the mask,
no longer concerned to dissemble his hostility 'You rave, sir. In
your anxiety to find a cover for your emptiness, a cloak for your
error, a salve for your vanity, you rant. And, by my soul, you
could scarcely rant more wildly than when you say that I lured you
here.'</p>
<p>Piccinino leaned across the table, one of his stumpy hands
resting upon it to support him; the other gesticulated wildly, and
his face was the face of a devil.</p>
<p>'Will you play the innocent to me? It will need more than that
to save your neck. Do you think I have forgotten your sneer that in
coming to Cantalupo I might find that I had lost more than I had
gained? I understand your meaning now, you false Judas. I should
have understood it sooner had not your woman, your bawdy tool,
beguiled me with her deceitful languishing. I should have suspected
the harlotry she used to delay me here, now beckoning, now
repelling me. That and your false friendliness and treacherous
letter have made a fool of me. But as God's my light, I'll call a
reckoning before I go.'</p>
<p>The Lady Eufemia was crouching in her chair, a vivid fear in her
blue eyes. Her lord, however, that man of timid prudences, remained
stolidly indifferent before the soldier's furious threat.</p>
<p>'Letter?' he said. 'What letter?'</p>
<p>'What letter?' Piccinino smote the table with his hand. 'The
letter bidding me to Cantalupo.'</p>
<p>'Are you a liar, too?' wondered Cantalupo. 'I wrote you no
letter.'</p>
<p>'But your woman did. Will you pretend that it was not with your
connivance, at your orders?'</p>
<p>The Lord of Cantalupo lost some of his stolidity. Slowly he
turned his eyes upon the little lady who sat so tense and still.
'What is this that he says of a letter that you wrote? He lies,
does he not?'</p>
<p>She roused herself. She was almost scornful. Perhaps she hoped
at his expense to set herself right in the eyes of the condottiero,
and thus at least avert whatever now might threaten.</p>
<p>'I did it for the best. You said that if Ser Piccinino appeared
before Cantalupo, you would not temporize a moment longer.
Therefore I fetched him. So as to put an end to your hesitations.
So as to compel you for your own good to declare for Anjou.'</p>
<p>He thrust away the chair by which he had been standing, and
strode to her side.</p>
<p>'You fetched him? You bade him come? You traitress!' The colour
darkened in his face. He stood menacingly over her, a big ponderous
man, still powerful despite his weight of years. Then sudden, and
very oddly, he laughed. 'Your neck is slender as a lily's stem; and
it would snap as easily between my hands. Do you know why I do not
snap it? Because I owe you thanks for something for which I have
been thanking Fate.'</p>
<p>Piccinino stormed in. 'Leave comedy My eyes are open. Wide open.
I am not to be fooled twice in the same business.' He swung to
Fidelio. 'Before we ride we'll clean out this foul nest. Summon the
guard. Place me this old carrion under arrest. As for the woman...'
He looked at her, and the grin on his mouth was merciless. 'She
shall be my care. My men shall feast on the charms she flaunts so
impudently in her treacherous aims. God's light! But they shall
learn who is the master here.'</p>
<p>Cantalupo startled him by laughing. 'And so shall you, Ser
Piccinino. Is it the guard you desire?' He clapped his hands
together loudly, and raised his voice to call. Almost at once Bosio
came in answer, and at his heels a half-dozen of Cantalupo's
men-at-arms. The Marquis gave his castellan an order.</p>
<p>'You will require the captain of the gate to take up the
drawbridge at once, and to suffer no man to enter or leave
Cantalupo until I give the word. You others, stand to your arms
here.'</p>
<p>Piccinino swung this way and that in bewildered anger. 'What's
this? What's this?' He raised his voice to arrest the departing
castellan. 'Not so fast, you! It is my orders that count here!
You'll wait for them, if you please.'</p>
<p>But Bosio departed as if the captain had not spoken, a contempt
that turned the raging Piccinino again upon the Marquis.</p>
<p>'Are you all mad in Cantalupo? Am I to put your paltry garrison
to the sword before it is understood that I am to be obeyed?'</p>
<p>The Marquis shrugged his broad shoulders, and sat down. His
ponderous calm moved Piccinino to a yet wilder frenzy, and the Lady
Eufemia to a round-eyed, palpitating wonder.</p>
<p>Into the soldier's blasphemous ordures of speech, the Lord of
Cantalupo's voice cut coldly, peremptorily.</p>
<p>'Attend to me, you foulness! Instead of crowing so loudly about
being master here and about hanging me from my own battlements, you
had better realize that the gin has snapped upon you. I am not your
prisoner. You are mine. And preserve your calm, I beg. For at the
first sign of violence these men of mine will cut you down.'</p>
<p>Piccinino's rage was engulfed in amazement. This thing was too
fantastically incredulous. The news that Colombo da Siena was
marching on Benevento had gone to the old dotard's brain, and had
intoxicated him.</p>
<p>'You fool, have you forgotten that I have a thousand men at
hand?'</p>
<p>'They are outside the castle walls, and the drawbridge is being
taken up.'</p>
<p>'How long do you suppose it will take them to give an account of
your mouldy walls and their futile defenders?'</p>
<p>Not long, perhaps. But certainly longer&mdash;much
longer&mdash;than it will now take Colombo da Siena to reach
Cantalupo.'</p>
<p>'Cantalupo?'</p>
<p>'Of course, you would not think of that. This Messer Fidelio's
information about Colombo's movements' is incomplete. It is no
doubt true that he is marching along the river Volturno. It is
certainly true that he is marching northward. For what really is
happening is that he is on his way to Cantalupo, informed that,
wherever your army may be, you yourself, Ser Piccinino, are being
held here for him.'</p>
<p>From bloodless lips came Piccinno's voice, now hoarse with
passion.</p>
<p>'You sent him that assurance! You dared!' Then, at last, he
showed a further, belated, understanding. 'The courier sent by
Castrocaro five days ago? The letter he carried announcing de
Bressan's defeat? You intercepted it! You withheld it from me!'</p>
<p>The Marquis leered at him. 'You were so happily engaged that it
would have been a cruelty to have disturbed you. You were in such
exalted enjoyment of the hospitality my lady offered you in
Cantalupo that I had not the heart to distress you sooner than
necessary with this news.' He slewed round to face his pallid
marchioness. 'You will have understood by now, madonna, that your
letter to Messer Piccinino was not the only invitation that went
out from Cantalupo. Indeed, it was your invitation to Messer
Piccinino that provided the occasion for mine to Colombo da
Siena.'</p>
<p>It is doubtful whether the Lady Eufemia or the Captain-General
of Anjou was his bitterest enemy at that moment. There was no
candour now in the eyes of the lady as they glared their mute
hatred of her lord; and Piccinino might have read in her white,
distorted face that he had too rashly judged her in league with her
husband to betray him.</p>
<p>But Piccinino, in the fierce anguish of contemplating the
terrible position in which he found himself, no longer can have
troubled to give thought to the manner in which it had been brought
about.</p>
<p>Hands were laid upon him and upon Fidelio by Cantalupo's
men-at-arms. The Marquis offered sardonic apologies.</p>
<p>'It is necessary that I should place you in safety, sir. But do
not let it vex you unduly It will be for no more than a day or two,
until Ser Colombo arrives.'</p>
<h3>&mdash; iv &mdash;</h3>
<p>The Marquis of Cantalupo had acted when he did because his hand
had been forced by the arrival of Fidelio. When he said that
Colombino would arrive in a day or two, he expressed a hope rather
than an assurance. As a matter of fact it was a full week before
Colombino arrived.</p>
<p>Eager though he might be to lay hands upon the Angevin
commander, the Captain-General of Aragon in his forward sweep had
found himself, as a result of his calculations, so excellently
placed to end the campaign at a blow that Piccinino and Cantalupo
must wait a while.</p>
<p>The forces of King Ferdinand acting in concert with his own and
in accordance with his directions, he held the camp of Benevento in
a ring of steel, and this ring he began to close. Castrocaro,
finding himself beset on every side at once and by forces
materially in excess of his own, broke down under the
responsibility thrust upon him by the absence of his chief. He
acknowledged himself out-generalled, surrendered at discretion,
since he could obtain no other terms, and suffered himself to be
disarmed. The war was finished, the Anjou hopes were dead, and
Ferdinand was firm upon the throne of Naples; and all this
accomplished in the turn of a hand, as it were, by a man at whose
fancied ineptitude Italy had been laughing little more than a week
ago.</p>
<p>'I hand you the palm,' Squillanti told Colombino on the night of
that victory. 'Never again in my life will I doubt your purposes. I
have seen something of war, and I have some notion of myself as a
soldier. But here you baffled me. And yet...' He hesitated. 'There
is something I shall never understand. When you marched south
parallel with Piccinino, with forces fully equal to his own, was
surely the moment to have fallen upon him, before the arrival of
the French. You risked his being reinforced before you delivered
battle. Still, since luck served you so well, as it happens...'</p>
<p>'Luck?' Colombino interrupted him. 'Oh, well, yes. Fortune in
these matters must never be denied. But I was not served by luck as
you suppose. There was always the chance that just this might
happen. Piccinino, as I kept telling you, has one only trick of
strategy, and if the opportunity served, I thought he would not
fail to try it. If the French sails had shown on the horizon, I
must instantly have fallen upon Piccinino, to deliver battle before
he could be reinforced. But as long as no sails showed, I waited.
And in the end he did as I supposed. He slipped past me, counting
that I would follow, and ready to turn again the moment he had word
that the French were in my rear. Between his own army and Bressan's
he would crush me. But I only made pretence to follow. The galleys
he sent out assured me of what was afoot. I doubled back to wait
for Bressan. Then, when I had smashed him, I had Piccinino in the
position in which he so fondly imagined that he would catch me. He
was between my army and King Ferdinand, and his doom was sealed.
Patience, my dear Marquis, is the highest virtue a commander can
possess. And I possess it. We'll go and explain all this to
Piccinino. It will amuse the little devil.'</p>
<p>And so, with a force some four thousand strong&mdash;the main
body of the army, with its long convoy of prisoners, being sent on
to Naples&mdash;Colombino rode to Cantalupo. He rode into it
without striking a blow, for Piccinino's thousand, demoralized by
the events and in no case to stand before this overwhelming force,
dissolved and vanished at his approach.</p>
<p>In the main hall of the castle, the old Marquis awaited him, and
at his side stood his reluctant lady, whose presence he had
constrained. For in these days the last dregs of his uxoriousness
had been cast out, and he commanded now where formerly he had
coaxed and begged.</p>
<p>Colombino entered. He was in light armour, trailing a
wine-coloured cloak, a youthful, vigorous figure with the bearing
of a prince and a princely train of attendant officers.</p>
<p>Stepping briskly ahead of his following, he advanced towards the
Marquis. Only for a heartbeat did his firm step falter, his smile
grow rigid; and that was when his glance alighted upon the slim
little figure in black that stood with heaving breast and downcast
eyes at her lord's side. Only then did he recall the fact, heard
months ago and forgotten in the press of his active life, that
Eufemia, once of Rovieto, had married the Marquis of Cantalupo.
Recalling it, he wondered for an instant whether in coming here, it
was he who had walked into a trap. Then, remembering the troops at
his heels, flowing through township and castle, he perceived the
idleness of the thought, and went boldly on.</p>
<p>He was embraced by the Marquis and greeted with cordial words of
welcome and of loyalty to Aragon. Then he turned perforce to take
the hand extended to him by the Marchioness. He bowed over it
stiffly, and bore it to his lips as the forms demanded. It was
ice-cold, and all of ice seemed the lady who stood before him
without raising her eyes.</p>
<p>He stepped back, and was beginning to express his thanks and the
thanks of his master for the great service the Marquis had
rendered, when Cantalupo interrupted him.</p>
<p>'Not to me these thanks. Not to me, sir. <i>Palmam qui
meruitferat.</i>' He was smiling as he spoke; but it was an odd
smile, thought Colombino, for it seemed to hold more bitterness
than mirth. Smiling so, he half-turned to his lady 'It is to
Madonna Eufemia here that you should address your thanks for this
fresh laurel added to the crown you so nobly wear. There was, I
believe, some old debt between you two which she was anxious to
discharge. For this she brought Jacopo Piccinino here, so that he
might be taken and held for you. And she employed arts of which she
is mistress to drug his senses until the time should be ripe to
secure him.</p>
<p>'It is thus that she pays her debt to you. It is for this that
she deserves your thanks, for this service to you and to the cause
of Aragon, which is her last act in this world.'</p>
<p>Colombino recoiled. He had perceived by now at least in part the
source of Cantalupo's bitterness. 'My lord!' The cry was startled
from him.</p>
<p>But now the smile of the Marquis was reassuring. 'Do not
misunderstand me, sir. I have prevailed upon Madonna Eufemia to
remain here until today, so that she should do you honour and
receive your thanks. It is only to this end that she delayed her
departure. She goes to Rome, sir; to the convent of the Poor
Clares. There in prayer and humility and poverty she proposes to
purge herself of the contamination of a world which no longer
interests her, in preparation for a better world to come.'</p>

SQUILLANTI</h2>
<h3>&mdash; i &mdash;</h3>
<p>Once again Colombo da Siena was to profit by a revulsion of
feeling.</p>
<p>Whilst in any case his defeat of Piccinino must have been hailed
as a great victory, it was magnified by the shock to the popular
mind which had been persuading itself of his incompetence. He who
deceives an enemy is acknowledged a skilful general, but he whose
deception involves at the same time a people is acclaimed a genius
by those whom he has hoodwinked. To do less would be to depreciate
their own perspicacity.</p>
<p>Just as the reaction from suspicions of his loyalty in the
matter of Monsieur de La Bourdonnaye had resulted in placing his
loyalty solidly beyond doubt, so now the reaction from assumptions
of his ineptitude made his military talents shine the more
dazzlingly.</p>
<p>The considerable fame hitherto enjoyed was as nothing to the
fame into which he now entered. Naples prepared a triumph for him.
King Ferdinand rewarded him with the fief of Ostiamare and the
title of Count, and bestowed the accolade upon him, whilst the
Queen, with her own hands, buckled on his spurs. The Pope had sent
him the Golden Rose and offered him the gonfalon of Holy Church,
which Colombino, aiming higher still, had gracefully declined.</p>
<p>To one so honoured abroad, his native Siena was moved to offer
signal homage, and like Naples prepared a triumph for his
home-coming.</p>
<p>Under archways of blossoming ramage, swathed in bunting and
flanked by banners, through streets that had been carpeted with
boughs and strewn with flowers, past houses gay with tapestries and
cloth of gold and silver, through a press of acclaiming townsfolk,
noble and simple, young and old, to the blare of trumpets and the
shouts of the multitude, the young soldier of fortune, looking like
an incarnation of the Christian Mars, Saint Michael, rode into the
city of his birth, and saluted the she-wolf on her pillar in the
Campo. The May sunshine flashed from his silver armour as from a
mirror, and in the eyes of some fervent ones seemed to set an
aureole of light about his tawny head. For he rode bareheaded, on a
great white charger with rich trailing housings of damask, its head
adorned by a golden artichoke. A sleek esquire in crimson rode a
horse's length behind him, bearing his dove-crowned helmet, his
lance and his mace. Colombino's face, cast in such squarely austere
lines that it seemed hewn of granite, was flushed though grave, and
he bowed to the acclamations as a prince might bow to his
subjects.</p>
<p>The incense of worship and wonder in which he moved in the days
that followed, under the homage of great men and the allurement of
inviting glances from more than one great lady, must have turned a
head less level. Or perhaps it was that his yearnings, set ever
upon that distant lady in Ravenna, left him no appetite for the
present feast. Had she been at his side to share his glory, how
different it would have been and how treasured for her sake! But in
her absence he was constrained to draw upon his fortitude so that
he might ably bear his part in the festivities that succeeded each
other in his honour, impatient to be done with it all and to be
free to depart to the peace of his villa at Montasco.</p>
<p>Squillanti was his host during those days in Siena, and an
assiduous host who spared no pains to make the occasion glorious,
by a succession of banquets, balls, and jousts, and lesser
entertainments.</p>
<p>And in all that he contrived for the delight and magnification
of his guest, he was seconded by his Marchioness with an assiduity
that exceeded even his own. A woman as famed for beauty as for
gallantry, Squillanti's lady had left an ache in many a stout heart
since she had wed the Marquis. That she meant to leave none in
Colombino's was plain enough from the utter frankness with which in
those days she offered herself to his attention. But Colombino,
with his thoughts elsewhere, remained unconscious of her wooing,
however flagrant it became. He was blinded perhaps by weariness; a
weariness, ever increasing, of the role of hero of the hour which
he found thrust upon him.</p>
<p>At last it was coming to an end. A ball in the Squillanti Palace
was marking the close of these festivities.</p>
<p>The ambassador of the Most Serene Republic of Venice was among
the foreign envoys present, and this ambassador was Colombino's old
acquaintance Francesco Gritti. The influence in Venice of the
Gritti family had been too great for Messer Francesco's permanent
disgrace. He had never ceased to be a member of the Ten, and having
borne, himself, the expense of his mistake, the Most Serene
Republic had speedily and graciously forgotten it. Indeed, Messer
Francesco seemed to have forgotten it himself. At least, he showed
no sign of rancour towards Colombino for the past, but was amongst
the loudest now in his adulation.</p>
<p>To the delight and flattery of this ambassador of the
Serenissima, they were dancing the stately Veneziana in the great
hail of Squillanti's palace, and all that was noble in Siena and
able to move with reasonable nimbleness upon two legs was taking
part in this new dance.</p>
<p>The Marquis himself had led forth Madonna Silvia Piccolomini,
who, as the Pope's cousin, was just then the Lady Paramount in
Siena; Camillo Petrucci had followed with Messer Gritti's lady,
who, though already well advanced in years, yet took the eye by her
semi-Oriental Venetian splendour; the exquisite Silvio Pecci moved
gracefully with Squillanti's demurely radiant young Marchioness;
the most noble Ettore Malavoiti, very tall and scornful, and
conspicuous as a magpie in black-and-white silk&mdash;as if the
colours of Siena were peculiarly his right&mdash;was partnered with
a golden-headed lady of the Roman House of Orsini.</p>
<p>Colombino, having excused himself on the score that the figures
of this new dance were strange to him, had gone to watch the gay
scene from the stone gallery above.</p>
<p>Weary though he might be of all this, and glad to think that
tomorrow at last he would be free to return to the peace of
Montasco, yet in the honours of which he had been the recipient
there was much in which he might take satisfaction. Of all the
flattery bestowed upon him, one that perhaps really touched him was
the offer made him by Venice, through her envoy Francesco Gritti,
that now that his engagement with Siena was at an end he should
enter the service of the Serenissima and assume the command of her
army. Exhausted though Venice might be by her long-drawn war with
Milan for the prepotency of the North, yet such faith, said Messer
Gritti, did Colombo da Siena inspire, that if he could be persuaded
to become her condottiero, she would rouse herself to renew the
struggle.</p>
<p>Colombino had temporized, neither accepting nor refusing. He
confessed himself a little weary of war; his vineyard required
attention&mdash;his usual excuse on such occasions&mdash;and for a
few weeks at least he would make no decision. Messer Gritti,
professing to respect the soldier's inclinations, had written to
the Council of Ten, urging them to increase the stipend they had
offered.</p>
<p>Pondering now this amended proposal and watching the surprising
nimbleness of a man of Messer Gritti's years and gaunt frame,
Colombino found amusement in contrasting the Venetian's present
attitude towards him with what it had been at Ravenna, when
Francesco Gritti had stood a prisoner before him with a halter
round his neck. The thought of Ravenna brought with it the thought
of Samaritana and the ache that ever accompanied it. It so absorbed
him that he was scarcely aware of footsteps approaching from beyond
the pillar against which he was leaning.</p>
<p>Presently a man and a woman came to lean upon the rail of the
gallery Like himself they had ceased to be actors so as to become
spectators. Without perceiving him they had entered his line of
vision, and he saw that they were his hostess, the slim, dark young
Marchioness, and the exquisite Silvio Pecci, who, it now occurred
to him, was too frequently at her side.</p>
<p>Silvio's high-pitched voice came clearly to his ears; his tone
was one of mincing mockery.</p>
<p>'Of the many things for which your Squillanti was not fashioned,
the service of Terpsichore is one. His dancing is that of a festive
bull. I never behold him but I think of that Cretan horror, the
Minotaur.'</p>
<p>If it shocked Colombino that any man should address Squillanti's
lady in such terms, her laughing answer, clear above the strains of
flute and viol, shocked him more.</p>
<p>'You will add, Silvio, that in me you see another Ariadne and in
yourself the heroic Theseus.'</p>
<p>'I confess it was in my mind.'</p>
<p>'An ingenious mind, my Silvio.'</p>
<p>'Does it not describe us?'</p>
<p>'A trifle flattering to you, I think. You may be skilled in
finding your way through labyrinths. But you would faint in the
presence of the Minotaur.'</p>
<p>Colombino thought that this was rather better. There followed a
pause. Then said Pecci, in a voice that had turned sour: 'I lose
your esteem, I think, Caterina.'</p>
<p>'No, no. My esteem never went the lengths of considering you a
Theseus. Your fibre is too delicate, Silvio, for that part.'</p>
<p>'Are you defying me?'</p>
<p>'On the contrary. I am restraining you. The lute is your proper
weapon, sir; the lists of Cupid are your proper battleground.'</p>
<p>'I thank you, madonna. I am diminished in your eyes since this
captain of fortune has brought swaggering bluster into
fashion.'</p>
<p>'Cease, or you will put me out of humour. You grow tiresome,
Silvio.'</p>
<p>'Tiresome?' Anger was kindling in his voice. 'Tiresome! Oh, I
grow tiresome, madonna mine. Shall I tell you since when? Since the
return of this fine captain from the wars. By the Host! It
nauseates a man to see the fawning adulation lavished on this
mountebank, this upstart, this adventurer.'</p>
<p>'You mean that it nauseates you, Silvio But not a man. No, nor a
woman either.'</p>
<p>Messer Silvio caught his breath. 'You are so shameless, then, as
to confess it?' Thus, out of light words had the storm gathered.
But as he now raved on, he disclosed that it had been brewing
earlier. And he disclosed to Colombino matters that served to heal
the Captain of his blindness. 'My faith, there was not the need to
tell me. I have seen your eyes when you looked at him; and I have
read their message; for once it was so that you looked at Me.'</p>
<p>'May God forgive me for it. For you were never worth looking at,
Silvio.'</p>
<p>'Ah! And this Colombino, then...'</p>
<p>He got no further. The soldier, shaking off his embarrassment
with the hesitation that had held him there, an unwilling listener,
stepped forth into their view.</p>
<p>Did I hear my name?'</p>
<p>They started round in swift confusion. Squillanti's lady flashed
him a glance from nun-like eyes, all innocence and chastity, then
looked away, the colour stirring in her lovely, pallid face. Messer
Silvio struck a pose of dauntlessness, hand on hip, his head thrown
back.</p>
<p>'Whence do you spring, sir?'</p>
<p>'Spring? Sir, I do not spring. I walk. I pass. I overhear my
name. Or was I mistaken? If so, let me pass on.'</p>
<p>'We were speaking of you, yes,' the lady admitted. 'All the
world is doing that, and not only in Siena. Messer Silvio was
saying...' She turned to find her gallant melting into the shadows
of the staircase. 'Oh, but does it matter what he said?'</p>
<p>'Rarely, I should imagine.'</p>
<p>'And at such a moment? For your sojourn here draws too swiftly
to its end. Tomorrow you depart.' She looked away again, down into
the throng below, which danced no longer, and added softly:
'Alas!'</p>
<p>His voice was coldly formal.</p>
<p>'I am as fortunate in my going as in my staying. To continue
here might be to lose the little modesty Siena has left me.'</p>
<p>'Does your welcome surprise you? Are you not worthy of all, and
more?'</p>
<p>'Certainly not worthy that you should think so.'</p>
<p>The long, demure eyes, so startlingly blue against her smooth
black hair, came slowly round to look into his own. The nun-like
face had an expression that was certainly not nun-like.</p>
<p>'Worthy of all that I could think of you.' Her tone had dropped
to a caressing murmur that no coxcomb could have misunderstood. Nor
did Colombino now, who was certainly no coxcomb and found here no
coxcomb's satisfaction.</p>
<p>That she was the wife of a brother-in-arms and a host who had
nobly entertained him rendered doubly odious a situation which he
could no longer misunderstand; and for days thereafter he would
shudder as he wondered if he could have extricated himself without
brutality had not Squillanti himself at that moment come limping
towards them on his massive but unequal legs.</p>
<p>'Silvio told me that I should find you here. Our guests begin to
leave. I need you to help me speed them, Caterina; and you, too,
Colombino. For yours is the leading part tonight.'</p>
<h3>&mdash; ii &mdash;</h3>
<p>Late that night, as Colombino was climbing into the great
canopied bed in the chamber of honour which he occupied, the door
was softly opened to admit the Marquis, who came, in bedgown and
slippers, with the announcement that there was a grave matter upon
which they should have an understanding.</p>
<p>For a moment the soldier was caught by a suspicion that his host
was concerned with Madonna Caterina's undisguised preoccupations,
and in his soul he damned the lightness of all women that must
forever be setting men at grips.</p>
<p>He frowned as he watched Squillanti re-lighting the candles
which Colombino had just extinguished in the massive golden branch
that stood on an ebony table in mid-chamber. After that the Marquis
limped to the bed, and sat down upon the edge of it, his florid
countenance portentous.</p>
<p>As he opened his mind, the soldier's wonder grew with his relief
to hear himself harangued upon the politics of Siena. Being
relieved, his wonder presently turned to weariness, and he sought
to stem the flood.</p>
<p>'My dear Lord Marquis, you waste your rhetoric. What have I to
do with theories of government? I am but the tool of governments.
My functions are brutally practical.'</p>
<p>Squillanti raised a massive hand, pursing the lips of his
curiously small mouth. 'A little patience! Consider me the
distracted state of this unfortunate republic, in prey to parties,
each seeking, under the pretence of patriotism, to serve its own
advantages. We have the Fifteen, the Nine, the Popolani, the
Riformatori, the Signory, and the Balia. Was ever government so
complicated? So many factions, each striving with the others for
supremacy? They make the world hideous with their turbulence. Siena
in prey to this internecine strife lies languishing; her trades and
her arts are paralyzed. Let this continue for a little longer, and
we shall be the meanest state in Italy Could a better example be
found of the evils of communal rule? Could a stouter argument be
urged in favour of government by a prince; such a government as
Florence has already adopted?'</p>
<p>'Probably not,' said Colombino, stifling a yawn. He agreed so
that they might be the sooner done.</p>
<p>But Squillanti seemed merely at the exordium.</p>
<p>'What Florence has done for her honour and salvation, Siena can
do.'</p>
<p>'I see.' Colombino was indifferent. 'You would replace the
republic by a prince. Why not?'</p>
<p>'Just so. Why not?' But Squillanti was so tight-lipped and so
direct of glance that the soldier realized that further disclosures
were impending. A heavy hand was laid on Colombino's wrist. 'What
has been done in Florence by a family of apothecaries turned
usurers, by these Medici, who blazon upon their shield the pills
with which they laid the foundations of their fortune and house,
may surely be done here in Siena by a soldier of distinction, a man
well-born, enjoying the universal esteem of his fellow citizens, a
man who in the eyes of the people must appear as a natural leader
by right of something better than purges.'</p>
<p>There was an end to Colombino's indifference. He was shaken into
sudden attention. He was even not untouched by fear. 'God save me!'
was his ejaculation, and wide-eyed he remained staring at his
host.</p>
<p>Smiling darkly, Squillanti stroked his double chin. 'I have
startled you.'</p>
<p>Colombino essayed a short laugh. It expressed merely
nervousness.</p>
<p>'Faith, you point the way either to the throne or to the
headsman. I can't determine which.'</p>
<p>'Bah! We can forget the headsman. Nothing worth achieving was
ever achieved without risk. But here the risk need not deter us. I
have weighed it. I have taken soundings. And I can tell you that,
with the exception of a few self-seekers, none of the patricians of
Siena will oppose the project.'</p>
<p>'But will they support it?'</p>
<p>'I am assured they will. Besides, it is not for a man of spirit
to count the obstacles when duty so clearly points the way No man
who loves Siena can remain indifferent whilst these jackals fight
and snarl over her for their own profit. It is out of love for
Siena that I am impatient to strike this blow for the restoration
of order and the encouragement of the arts and crafts by which
states grow rich and powerful. The man who accomplishes this,
Colombino, will be hailed&mdash;and rightly hailed&mdash;as the
saviour of his country.'</p>
<p>Colombino sat propped on his pillows, the eyes of his body
dreamy, the eyes of his soul dazzled. If the ambition which has
ever lain deep in the heart of every soldier of fortune had
languished in him of late under the discouragements procured him
first by the Lady of Rovieto and then by the Lady Samaritana, it
was nevertheless still alive, and it was being reinvigorated now by
the breath of the Marquis Squillanti. His earliest inspiration had
been the career of that great condottiero Francesco Sforza, who had
risen to be Duke of Milan and the most powerful prince in Northern
Italy And now, abruptly, possibilities almost as great were opening
before himself.</p>
<p>That he was the man for this, he never doubted. Nor did he doubt
that the revolution Squillanti suggested would be for the good of
Siena; so that patriotism came to quicken the lively stirrings of
his ambition. That the patricians of Siena should be prepared to
accept him for their duke, as he understood Squillanti to be
saying, did not seem odd, considering his recent achievements and
the love that Siena was displaying for him. But it might be less
easy, he thought, to persuade the people that they would prosper
better under the government of a prince. That was a belief to which
they must gradually be educated.</p>
<p>This thought he expressed, and thereby provoked Squillanti's
scorn.</p>
<p>'If by the people you mean the plebs, the populace, that is
never to be educated. In all ages it is ready to listen to the
first seducer base enough to flatter it and to lead it by its
foolish nose with lying promises of the effortless acquisition of
the treasures of the earth. We are not without such rogues in
Siena. But if a state is to prosper, its populace must be
dominated, not educated. Education is for men whose minds are
equipped to receive it, for patricians, for natural leaders. In
this I have already made more than a beginning. I know that we can
count upon the Primerani, the Alamanni, upon Ventura d' Allegretto,
upon Silvio Pecci, and perhaps even upon the Piccolomini and the
Salimbeni. Petrucci I do not trust, because I believe him to be too
ambitious. I mean that he would support the scheme if it aimed at
giving him the throne. But he would never suffer another Sienese to
achieve that ascendancy over him. Malavolti is in the same case.
Already he disputes with Petrucci the title of first citizen to
Siena. And there are a few others whom it would be just as
dangerous to enlist. But we have enough without them. And if your
duty to your country moves you as it should, we have in your free
company the strength to impose our will.'</p>
<p>He paused there, and looked searchingly into the soldier's face
that was set in stony gravity.</p>
<p>'I have been frank with you, Colombino. Now, the fate of Siena
is in your hands.'</p>
<p>At last Colombino raised his dark, glowing eyes, and looked
straight into the eyes of his host. He had taken his resolve.</p>
<p>'Since in my soul I believe with you that a prince will be for
Siena's good, I am your man. God helping me, I will do my duty by
the State.'</p>
<p>Squillanti flung himself forward and hugged him in an embrace
that left him momentarily breathless.</p>
<p>'I knew that I could depend upon you!'</p>
<p>Colombino, now all eagerness, asked him for instructions.</p>
<p>'Leave all to me,' he was answered. 'Away with you to Montasco
and your vineyards until I give the word to strike. I will keep in
touch with you. Meanwhile, disband none of your men.'</p>
<p>'I'll need some pretext for that. I do not maintain an army in
my pay when there is no prospect of a hire.'</p>
<p>'I've thought of it. Venice supplies the pretext. It is known
that Gritti is wooing you with offers from the Serenissima.'</p>
<p>'I have no notion of accepting them.'</p>
<p>'You need not say so yet. Temporize with Gritti, and let it be
known that you are temporizing. That will sufficiently account for
keeping your army standing.'</p>
<p>On that they parted for the night, and Colombino lay down, not
now to sleep, but to stare into the dark and irradiate it with
visions of empire. And into these visions of his stole the slender,
graceful wraith of Samaritana. Old Onorato da Polenta had died some
months ago, and in Ravenna Samaritana ruled with the help of her
priestly cousin. It was two years since that night at Bellaria when
her own romance had been shattered and he had looked upon her for
the last time. By now perhaps the wound that Moro had dealt her
would have healed, and the memories she must hold of Colombino
could not be of a kind to render him mistrusted or unwelcome. If he
were Duke of Siena there would be about him a glamour which might
serve to captivate her. He could bear her the offer of a nobler
crown than that of Ravenna. It should be worth while, then, to make
the attempt. If it succeeded and she consented to share his throne,
how the inspiration of her would widen his horizon! To Siena he
would link Lucca and Pisa, first by force of arms and then by a
wise government that should make for their prosperity and give
their people peace. Then he might even bring Florence under his
sway, wresting its government from the hands of those murderous
pill-makers, and so build up in Middle Italy a hegemony as great
and powerful as either Venice or Milan in the North.</p>
<p>The skies were suffused with the flush of dawn before Colombino
sank at last from these exalting dreams into quiet slumber.</p>
<h3>&mdash; iii &mdash;</h3>
<p>On the morrow Colombino rode away to his noble villa on
Montasco, there to pursue his fond dreams of dukedom; to plot the
laws he would enact for the sound government of his people, the
militia he would raise for the State's defence, so that predatory
mercenary companies might no longer drain its resources, and the
other measures he would take to render Siena prosperous, happy, and
formidable among the states of Italy.</p>
<p>His gloom was at last completely dispelled. Sangiorgio and
Caliente found him joyous and gay once more as he had been in the
old careless days before the Rovietan adventure. And this was
because daily the hope of Samaritana now grew stronger, and when he
dreamed of her, it was no longer to sigh over something lost to
him. The conviction grew daily that the road he trod was leading
him straight to her, as indeed it was, if not quite in the way that
he imagined.</p>
<p>Messer Gritti rode out to visit him; a Gritti who choked down
the gall in his heart, so that he might laugh with Colombino over
that old business at Ravenna as at something which if bitter in the
experience was in retrospect a jest. Colombino entertained him
nobly, and was entirely inconclusive. He would say neither yes nor
no at the moment to the proposals the Venetian made him. But he
promised, at least, that he would not keep Messer Gritti waiting a
moment longer than was necessary, and constrained to be content
with this Messer Gritti went his ways once more, promising to come
soon again.</p>
<p>Silvio Pecci was his next visitor; a Pecci swelling with
importance in those languid, summer days, to find himself neck-deep
in a conspiracy that was to revolutionize the State. He brought
letters from Squillanti, reporting favourable progress. And after
Pecci came other messengers from the Marquis with further letters,
all very ambiguously couched, so that their real meaning should be
clear to Colombino alone. These letters Colombino punctually
answered.</p>
<p>And then, when he had been some ten days at Montasco, Caterina
Squillanti came riding one noontide into his courtyard, hawk on
wrist, attended by a falconer and two grooms.</p>
<p>She protested to him, when he stood bareheaded to receive her,
that the pursuit of game had lured her farther afield than she
suspected, until, finding herself in the neighbourhood of Montasco,
she had resolved to cast herself for an hour or two upon his
hospitality.</p>
<p>So hollow was the pretence and so arch her tone that Colombino
must suppose she did not desire him to be deceived. It was in his
thoughts, and certainly in his too sanguine hopes, that she might
have been sent to him by Squillanti with news.</p>
<p>She was very fine in green and gold, the close-fitting,
high-waisted corsage opening low, her sleeves tight to the elbow
and thence spreading like wings on either side of her to mingle
with the voluminous folds of her gown. Of green and gold, too, was
her turban, made fast by a silken band that came tightly under her
chin. Thus framed, her delicate, pallid face looked more than ever
nun-like.</p>
<p>Colombino was severely courteous. It was most opportune, he
announced, that he was about to dine. His poor table would be
honoured, little though his celibate house might be designed for a
lady's entertainment.</p>
<p>She rallied him on this when they came to table, and its noble
equipment and lordly service were displayed for her; for Colombino
was in all things fastidious. He bore her raillery with grace, and
with still better grace her intelligent praise of last year's
vintage of Montasco, served in finely blown Murano glass. It was a
deep amber wine resulting from Colombino's marriage of Orvietan
vines to the rich Montasco soil. He was proud of it, and accounted
it worthy of the vessel from which it was poured, a tall golden
jug, designed by Della Quercia, studded with bosses of amethyst and
turquoise.</p>
<p>When at last the cloth was raised and the servants having
departed they could be more at ease, he asked her for the news of
which he supposed she might be the bearer.</p>
<p>'News?' Her brows, so fine that they might have been drawn with
a pencil, were raised. Her blue eyes opened wider at once in wonder
and reproach. 'Do you make me welcome, Ser Colombino, only for the
news that I may bring?'</p>
<p>Courtesy prescribed a denial.</p>
<p>'You need but to look in your mirror, madonna, to find the
answer to that question. Still, since you will have news...'</p>
<p>'But I have not,' she interrupted him, and so disabused his
mind. 'I have no purpose here that is not solely my own. Is it not
flattering? Will you not say that you are flattered?'</p>
<p>'It needs no protesting. Since it was built, my house has never
been more honoured.' Even as the mechanical words escaped him, he
accounted them treason, remembering that Samaritana had sat there
once, on the occasion when her father had sought him. It drew a
sigh from him, brought a shadow across his face, and caused him to
remind his visitor of the distance between Montasco and Siena.</p>
<p>Frowning, she glanced up at him. Then shyly laughed.</p>
<p>'What haste to be rid of me, Lord Count of Ostiamare!'</p>
<p>'No, no,' he protested. 'It is just that I would not have your
fair name suffer for an imprudence, however dear to me the
imprudence might be.'</p>
<p>The kindling of her glance, the faint colour creeping into her
cheeks as she looked at him, warned him that he had been betrayed
by courtesy into saying too much.</p>
<p>'Is that the truth?' There was a melting eagerness in her tone.
'Is my imprudence dear to you?'</p>
<p>'Who visits me, honours me. Who takes a risk in visiting me
honours me doubly.'</p>
<p>She set her elbows on the board, and cupped her chin in her
long, slim hands. Thus she gazed upon him with solemn and intent
allurement.</p>
<p>'Why so timid, Colombino? Why tread so cautiously when there are
no rebuffs to fear? Don't you yet guess that there is no hurt I
would not take for you?'</p>
<p>He inclined his head, his lips tight. 'I am honoured, madonna.
Honoured beyond my deserts.'</p>
<p>She frowned, her tone was plaintively impatient. 'You talk too
much of honour and honouring. You have no other words for me.
Colombino, why so formal, and so cold? You speak as if from the
lips alone. Your heart remains silent. Colombino.'</p>
<p>He smiled with a certain whimsical sadness. 'Perhaps I lack the
adventurous spirit, save in soldiering. And then...Squillanti is my
friend.'</p>
<p>She seized this explanation avidly She was of those who have a
gift for understanding as they wish. Audibly she caught her breath.
She leaned farther over towards him. 'And if that were not the
case...?'</p>
<p>'Does it profit us to speculate? Is it even wise?'</p>
<p>'Oh, a fig for wisdom! Wisdom is the thief of all the joys of
life. Can it be that you fear the Minotaur: this bull of a man to
whom they married me?' Her hands came from her chin, and were
stretched palm upwards across the table to him. 'If I bid you to be
brave, Colombino?'</p>
<p>'I have no valour of that kind, madonna.'</p>
<p>This gave her pause. She was chilled. The little colour that had
crept into her cheeks faded out again. Slowly she sat back in her
tall chair, keeping her eyes upon him, and they were now
questioningly grave. She sought an explanation of this restraint in
him, of this aloofness. That there should live a man who simply did
not want her could not occur to this Caterina Squillanti whose days
had been spent in defending herself from the ardours of too many
wooers. Her speech faltered a little.</p>
<p>'You mean...you mean...because you are Squillanti's friend?'</p>
<p>'That were reason enough.'</p>
<p>Her lovely mouth, so red in that white face, was twisted into a
queer, deprecatory smile, and then at last, to Colombino's infinite
relief, came interruption. A sudden sound of steps and voices broke
forth beyond the closed door. The voices were raised in
altercation; they were his chamberlain's and another's, one who too
insistently demanded admission to his presence. And he prevailed;
for abruptly the door was flung wide.</p>
<p>Across the threshold surged a vision of white and crimson, of
slender legs, of long waving crimson sleeves and golden hair. All
this beauty belonged to Messer Silvio Pecci. Behind him the
agitated chamberlain still protested.</p>
<p>Colombino, who faced the entrance, stood up, and raised his hand
to wave the chamberlain away Monna Caterina, looking over her
shoulder, gasped upon beholding that elegant, angry presence.</p>
<p>Messer Silvio advanced yet a pace or two, then struck an
attitude as the door closed behind him. He glared in horror upon
the lady, then shifted his furious glance to her host.</p>
<p>'So this is why you sit behind closed doors!'</p>
<p>To another it must have been matter for indignation. But not to
Colombino. He laughed outright at the impudence of this fribble. He
was suddenly at ease; for he knew how to deal with men.</p>
<p>'My good Silvio, it is not my habit to dine in public, whether
alone or with a guest. But it flatters me that you should make so
free with my poor house. This is to treat me like a brother.'</p>
<p>Silvio gave no heed to the irony The lady was absorbing his
attention, supplying the focus for his wrath. He came a little
closer. He breathed the furious mockery that springs from a wounded
soul.</p>
<p>'I saw Gino, your falconer, in the courtyard. You should not
leave your servants at the gate when you are secret and private
within. It betrays you, madonna. Nor when you come to Montasco
should you mask intention under such paltry make-believe as
hawking. The wooded valleys of the Asso and the Ombrone are
scarcely hawking country. Such poor invention, madonna, serves only
to reveal the very thing you would be hiding.'</p>
<p>She was on her feet, and in her white face her eyes burned with
a fierceness to match his own. Indeed, for all the jealous rage
that choked him, hers was the deeper, deadlier fury.</p>
<p>'You dared to follow me? You dared, you insolent, yelping
lapdog!'</p>
<p>He acted scorn of the notion. He laughed unpleasantly 'Follow
you? I? Disabuse your mind. I came here seeking the Count of
Ostiamare. It is by accident that I stumble upon your
shamelessness.'</p>
<p>Colombino had moved slowly round the table. He conceived that it
was time to intervene, that Messer Silvio's impertinence had been
sufficiently indulged. Standing a half-head taller than the tall
young patrician, he took him now by the shoulder in an ungentle
grip, and span him round, so that they faced each other.</p>
<p>'Jackanapes, this is my house. This lady is my guest. You'll
show a proper respect for both, or my grooms shall fling you on the
dunghill, which by your manners I take to have been your
birthplace.'</p>
<p>Silvio sucked in his breath and recoiled. By instinct his hand
sought the jewelled hilt of the heavy dagger hanging before him
from his golden girdle.</p>
<p>'God's Passion! Do you talk of birth, you knave begotten by a
traitor?' He swung again to the lady. 'For that is the thing you've
taken for a lover, madonna. I give you joy of him, and him of
you.'</p>
<p>Colombino, oddly calm, clapped his hands.</p>
<p>Instantly the door opened again to disclose the chamberlain, who
had not moved from its other side. Colombino looked at the
exquisite.</p>
<p>'Will you depart unaided, sir?'</p>
<p>Wickedness unspeakable glared back at him from that weak,
handsome face. Pecci drew himself up with a sudden assumption of
lofty dignity.</p>
<p>'I was the bearer of a message for you,' he said. 'A message
from this lady's husband on a matter of grave importance, as you
may surmise. It concerned a dukedom. A matter that might set a
noose about some necks I could name. Since I am dismissed, you may
seek the news for yourself in Siena.'</p>
<p>On that, abruptly, he swung on his heel and stalked out, and
Colombino, for all the misgivings the fellow's words had sown,
disdained to hinder him.</p>
<p>Not so, and for quite other reasons, Monna Caterina.</p>
<p>As the door was closing upon the brilliant white-and-crimson
figure, she rustled up to Colombino, and clutched his arm, her face
intent and fierce.</p>
<p>'There was mischief in his tone. Menace. Do not let him go. Kill
him! Kill him!'</p>
<p>He masked in a smile the repugnance her ruthlessness aroused. He
shrugged.</p>
<p>'Shall I do murder for so little?'</p>
<p>'So little?' She looked up at him in an amazement that quickly
changed to scorn. 'So little? After what he said to you? After what
he said to me? To me! You heard him, didn't you? His insults? Can
you forgive them?'</p>
<p>'I have already forgotten them.'</p>
<p>'My God! Is it only in battle that you are brave?'</p>
<p>'Perhaps it is.'</p>
<p>Thus at a blow he shattered the infatuation with which she had
plagued him.</p>
<p>'But what are you?' she asked, her lip curling in scorn of him.
'Lord God! And I thought you were a man.'</p>
<p>It was the last word she ever spoke to him. Having uttered it,
she turned and swept out, her chin in the air, leaving Colombino
wistful, yet relieved. All that he perceived was that she had gone.
Of the mischief that she had sown he took no heed. Yet already it
was germinating fiercely, soon to yield a crop of horror.</p>
<h3>&mdash; iv &mdash;</h3>
<p>It was twenty miles from Montasco to Siena, and in the course of
that long ride Messer Silvio Pecci had leisure to reflect. Cooling
with reflection from the hot rage in which he had flung away from
Colombino, it amazed him as much as it had amazed the Marchioness
that he should have been permitted to depart. To explain it he
could but suppose that surprise had momentarily numbed the
condottiero's wits. From this it was but a step to the conclusion
that presently, rousing himself, Colombino would be after him,
seeking his very life. For his own safety now, Colombino must
desire the destruction of Messer Silvio. Apprehension swelled in
his pusillanimous soul. Self-preservation became his only thought,
and however he might ply his wits, he could see one only way to
ensure it.</p>
<p>It was an ugly, treacherous way, and it would set some heads
aloft on pikes to decorate the city walls. But fear and jealousy of
the condottiero, acting in alliance, whipped him recklessly forward
along the only path to safety that he could perceive. Among the
heads to fall would certainly be that of this braggart captain; and
another would be Squillanti's. He almost sniggered to think that
thus at one blow he would deprive the wanton Caterina of both
husband and lover. She should learn what it meant to break faith
with Silvio Pecci. The sense of his power for vengeance gave him
consequence in his own eyes. That others would share the fate of
Colombino and Squillanti gave him no pause. So that he made himself
safe he cared not how many heads might fall or whose.</p>
<p>He took a night for reflection. He pondered well whom he could
trust to be the recipient of the betrayal he intended. First to his
mind came Piccolomini, the Pope's cousin and one of the foremost
gentlemen of Siena, who had not, after all, been brought by
Squillanti into the conspiracy because he was accounted honestly
devoted to the State as it existed. But Piccolomini was Colombino's
friend, and he might destroy the plot without destroying Colombino.
Next he considered Petrucci. But Petrucci, too, was Colombino's
friend, and even more close with him than Piccolomini. Besides, he
regarded Petrucci as a self-seeker whom it would be dangerous to
trust.</p>
<p>His choice fell at last upon that prominent and resolute member
of the Signory, Ettore Malavolti, and he rode out to seek him at
his country house on the Arbia.</p>
<p>The disdainful tolerance with which that arrogant patrician
welcomed Messer Silvio was turned to horror when he learnt from him
of the plot to overthrow the Republic, and to still deeper horror
when he heard the names of the persons implicated.</p>
<p>'Miserable wretch! Why do you bring this tale to me?'</p>
<p>'Because I have not the courage to go before the Signory. I...I
am too conscious of my fault in having even listened to these
seducers. You are an understanding man, Malavolti. The Signory
might not account my disclosure the amend that it is. But you see
that. You see that, and you will make the Signory see it. The glory
of unmasking this infamy will be yours. You will...'</p>
<p>'Leave that,' he was harshly bidden. 'Who cares to count such
glory? It is barest duty They would set up a duke, would they? The
fools! The knaves!' He turned on the dainty gentleman with flashing
eyes. 'You may thank God that He inspired you with this timely
penitence of your treacherous practices. Thus at least you save
your neck.'</p>
<p>'I am more concerned,' said Pecci, relieved by this assurance,
'to save the Republic.'</p>
<p>But Malavolti sniffed and sneered at him. 'Heroic, are you not?
You rise from this dunghill with its filth upon you, and cry:
Behold how clean and pure I am. You earthworm!'</p>
<p>'I suppose,' lisped Pecci with a sigh, 'that I deserve your
scorn.'</p>
<p>'Suppose it? Be sure of it, and be damned!' He swung on his heel
and paced the long room in fury, waving his long arms. 'They would
set up a duke!' he cried again. 'Lord God! They would ape the
Florentines! I marvel that they, too, did not choose a pill-maker
for their prince.' He came to a halt, his arms akimbo, towering
dominant over the pallid Silvio. 'Go to bed. It is too late to ride
again tonight. In the morning we will talk of this again. The
Signory must be warned at once, so that these scoundrels may be
dealt with as they deserve. There'll be a crop of beads in the
Campo before the week is out. Give thanks to God before you sleep
that you have had the sense to save your own. Go, man. My servants
will light you.'</p>
<p>Pecci went, thankful to escape from that scornful presence. But
when they met again to break their fast upon the morrow, the storm
appeared to have passed from Malavolti's soul. He must in the
course of the night have found reason for relenting from his angry
contempt of his guest, for now Pecci found him almost affable.</p>
<p>'Before we announce this matter to the Signory, there is a
problem to be solved. It has kept me wakeful. The matter is not
quite so simple as it seemed.'</p>
<p>'I perceive no complication,' ventured Silvio.</p>
<p>'But you will when I expound it; and you shall help me to
resolve it.' He rose and went to the window, thence surveying his
lordly park which stood gold-tinted in the sunlight. 'It's a fine
day Suppose we take a walk. I find it assists thought. Besides, we
can talk at ease as we go, without fear of eavesdroppers.'</p>
<p>It was not for Pecci in his delicate situation to thwart any of
Malavolti's wishes or to pester him with questions. They set
out.</p>
<p>But as they wandered farther and farther through cool, leafy
glades beside the sparkling waters of the Arbia, it was not of
plots, but of nature and its glories that Malavolti discoursed with
all the fervour of one who is something of a poet in his keen
sensuous perceptions.</p>
<p>Particularly, when they came to it, he desired Pecci's attention
to a wide circular pool, a great basin hollowed in granite by the
torrent. Its sides were green with moss that was like velvet until
within a foot or so of the water, where they became smooth as
polished steel. Trout were poised in its clear greenish depths.</p>
<p>'Lovely is it not? said Malavolti in ecstasy. 'To me it is as
some vast jewel; a tourmaline upon the noble breast of Italy We
call it Leda's Bathing Pool.'</p>
<p>'Why Leda's?' quoth the foolish Silvio, so as to be amiable.
'Because it would be in some such crystalline bath that Jupiter
surprised her.'</p>
<p>His fancy captured, laughing at the conceit, Messer Silvio
leaned forward to obtain a better view, and in that moment
Malavolti thrust him vigorously in.</p>
<p>Spread-eagled he took the water, scattering the trout.</p>
<p>He rose gasping and spluttering.</p>
<p>High above him on the basin's rim stood Malavolti, and since
Malavolti's laughter pealed through the glade, Messer Silvio
supposed himself the victim of a brutal jest. All the world knew
that there was a vile streak of brutality in Malavolti. Silvio
cursed him now with what breath he had.</p>
<p>'Will you laugh while I drown, brute beast?'</p>
<p>'You would laugh yourself if you could see yourself: so like a
fly in a bowl of milk.' And at the conceit Malavolti laughed still
more heartily</p>
<p>Silvio's rage began to turn to panic. 'Lend a hand, in God's
name! Don't you see that it is impossible to climb out without
assistance? Lend a hand! This jest has gone far enough.'</p>
<p>But Malavolti never moved. He stood there, hands on hips,
surveying the swimmer in his drenched finery of white and
crimson.</p>
<p>'You are very well where you are,' he answered him. 'I am sorry
that I have no Leda for you. But unless you emulate Messer Jove,
and like a swan grow wings on which to raise yourself, the Ledas of
this world will trouble you no more.'</p>
<p>With that for farewell this merry gentleman turned about, and
went off through the woods, to make his way back to his villa and
turn his mind to the more serious business that awaited him.</p>
<p>That evening he rode armed into Siena with an escort of a dozen
helmets. His destination was the Squillanti Palace. Invading it, he
took the Marquis by surprise, seized his person, and proceeded to a
systematic hunt through his papers. The risk he took in this
high-handed action was negligible, since the information Silvio had
brought him assured him of the existence of incriminating letters.
He found them, and in them abundant confirmation of Silvio's tale,
evidence that would take off a dozen of the noblest heads in
Siena.</p>
<p>Content, sardonically soothing Squillanti's distraught lady, who
raged and threatened to make him pay with his life for this brigand
outrage, he carried off the Marquis to the Public Palace, and sent
messengers in haste to summon the Signory, the Captain of the
People, and the Podesta.</p>
<p>To these, when they were assembled, Malavolti vauntingly
proclaimed himself the Saviour of the State. Sternly he denounced
the plot to overthrow the Republic, and named the plotters, putting
forth his documents in proof.</p>
<p>Within the hour Squillanti's associates were under arrest, and
the city was in an uproar. The tocsin was sounding from the Mangia
Tower, the militia was called out, and whilst the streets rang with
the cries of 'Treason!' and Popolor men flew to take up arms. All
night Siena was in ferment. By morning a motley citizen army, some
ten thousand strong, was afoot and surging in the great space of
the Campo about the pillar of the she-wolf. Acclaiming Malavolti as
the preserver of Siena, this army stood at the orders of the
Captain of the People, to defend the State from a treachery the
full extent of which no man as yet could gauge.</p>
<h3>&mdash; v &mdash;</h3>
<p>Colombino, twenty miles away at Montasco, remained in ignorance
of these events until word of them was brought to appall him that
afternoon by his friend Camillo Petrucci.</p>
<p>That tall, spare, elegant, and in the main gentle ascetic showed
himself for once as a flame of wrath. Colombino, listening,
stricken and dismayed, to the tale he unfolded, yet perceived quite
clearly the source of the merciless scorn with which he invested
his words. The conspiracy had offended Petrucci in his ambitions.
Accounting himself, and not without reason, the first man in the
State, the Lord of Siena without the title&mdash;just as Cosimo de'
Medici had been before he was made Duke of Florence&mdash;it
wounded him not only that there should have been a plot to set up a
prince, but that the plotters could have thought of bestowing the
dignity upon any but himself. In the same way it offended him to
witness the high-handed manner in which Malavolti had taken charge
of the situation, achieving thereby a prominence which for the
moment at least completely eclipsed the prepotency of Petrucci.</p>
<p>All this, however, was in Camillo's tone and manner, rather than
in his actual words. These were concerned with a relation of the
events, with the known details of the discovery made, and with the
names of the men denounced and convicted. Squillanti, Alamanni, and
Allegretti were already with their Maker. Swift justice had been
done upon them, and their traitor heads were grinning down from the
Ovile Gate upon the city they would have betrayed. A like justice
awaited all the others when they should be taken.</p>
<p>Colombino sat at his writing-table in the noble chamber he made
peculiarly his own. His chin in his hands, his elbows on the board,
he listened to Petrucci, who was restlessly pacing as he
talked.</p>
<p>To shut out the scorching August sunlight and preserve a
coolness in the room, the shutters had been almost entirely closed,
and Colombino was grateful for a gloom that partly spared him the
effort of setting a mask upon his emotions.</p>
<p>His first and natural suspicion was that Silvio Pecci was the
brewer of this mischief, and that it was he who had placed
Malavolti in possession of the facts upon which that gentleman had
so promptly acted. But finding no mention of his own name amongst
those denounced, and gathering from Petrucci's manner that no
suspicion of participation yet attached to him, it began to seem to
him that the betrayer could not, after all, be Silvio. If Silvio
had disclosed the plot, he could have done so only with the object
of destroying Colombino, who was to be regarded as the principal
member of it, since it was on his behalf that the whole wretched
business had been set on foot.</p>
<p>He broke the silence he had hitherto maintained&mdash;for he had
scorned to simulate surprise&mdash;to ask a question.</p>
<p>'You named Silvio Pecci among the conspirators. Has he been
taken?'</p>
<p>'He has disappeared,' said Camillo shortly. 'We suspect he was
forewarned of what was coming. But we shall find him, and he'll go
the way of his fellows.'</p>
<p>When they found him, thought Colombino, the present singular
oversight where he was himself concerned would no doubt be
repaired.</p>
<p>He sat crushed by deepest dejection, in which, however, fear for
himself played little part. The dissipation of his great dream of
dukedom and more, to be shared with the adored Samaritana, was of
little affliction at the moment compared with his remorseful grief
at the thought of all those noble lives cut off by the justice of
the State for the attempt to make a prince of him. And he could
spare pity, too, for the lady of the Marquis Squillanti, widowed
and bereft of support by these grim events which her own levity had
precipitated. Bitterly now did his conscience reproach him with his
ill-starred ambition, but not quite so bitterly that he could agree
with the fierce denunciations Camillo was uttering.</p>
<p>'There is one for whom death was too light a punishment.
Something worse than death should have been designed for the man
who in his reckless presumption aimed at being duke; the man
responsible for all this havoc; the man who recklessly sacrificed
these poor fools to his own cursed ambition.'</p>
<p>'Is it not possible,' said Colombino, 'that it was they who
tempted him?'</p>
<p>'Tempted Squillanti?' Camillo was scornful.</p>
<p>'Squillanti?'</p>
<p>'Yes. Squillanti. Didn't I mention it? It was Squillanti who
aimed at being duke.'</p>
<p>Squillanti Colombino echoed again. 'There surely you are at
fault.'</p>
<p>'At fault? Not I. You may suppose it. But there is no error
possible. The papers found by Malavolti make it clear. Besides, we
have Squillanti's own word for it. He was racked before he died.
And he confessed.'</p>
<p>'Confessed?'</p>
<p>Colombino was bewildered. He took his elbows from the table, and
sank back into his chair. In thought he went back to the night on
which Squillanti had tempted him. He strove to recall the precise
words used by the ill-starred Marquis, and recalling them realized
how readily he had applied to himself terms which were intended to
describe the other. The soldier of distinction, the man enjoying
the universal esteem of his fellow citizens, the man who must
appear to the people as a natural leader. He remembered now, and
understood. Thus in his conceit had Squillanti, the Gonfalonier of
Holy Church, described himself; and Colombino in his conceit had
misapplied the description.</p>
<p>Quite suddenly, and without any mirth, he laughed outright; a
hollow sound that set Camillo staring at him in that twilight.</p>
<p>It was for this, to make Squillanti Duke of Siena, that he had
thrust his neck into a noose, a noose which might presently be
drawn tight if any of his letters to Squillanti should come to be
discovered. Truly it was matter for laughter, and for dull rage,
too, that the dead Marquis in his presumption should have supposed
that Colombino would lend himself to the gratification of that
ambition.</p>
<p>Scorn of himself, and of the witlessness of his too-ready
assumptions, consumed him after Petrucci had departed, and abode
with him, keeping him inert until late in the afternoon when
another visitor reached Montasco.</p>
<h3>&mdash; vi &mdash;</h3>
<p>The young chamberlain who announced this newcomer announced at
the same time that he was cloaked, hooded, and masked, and that he
would give no name.</p>
<p>Colombino's consideration was brief. If conjecture could not
take him far, it could, at least, take him far enough to conclude
that this would be someone from Siena with news.</p>
<p>A muffled figure, tall, erect, and treading strongly, was
introduced, and disclosed, when the door had closed again, the
person of Ettore Malavolti.</p>
<p>If Colombino was uneasy, he did not display it. He rose to greet
the man who had unmasked and was casting aside his hooded cloak,
the only man who, according to the exasperated expressions of
Petrucci, had derived any profit from the Squillanti affair.</p>
<p>'The Saviour of the State!'</p>
<p>The sarcasm of the greeting brought a frown and then a laugh to
the tall patrician's swarthy, aquiline countenance, clearly
revealed, for by now the shutters had been thrown back, and the
room was suffused with light.</p>
<p>'I do not surprise you, it seems, on this day of surprises. For
it must have been that to you.'</p>
<p>'As to many'</p>
<p>'But scarcely of the same kind. For you the chief surprise must
surely have been that, whilst so many foolish heads were being
shorn off, no breath of suspicion should yet have uttered the name
of one whom you know to be as deeply implicated in this treason as
any of those impeached.'</p>
<p>So! It had come. But the odd thing was that it brought him no
dismay Afterward he confessed that this must have been because he
sensed that here a contest awaited him. Malavolti's opening words
and ironical tone were as the preliminaries of a swordsman about to
engage.</p>
<p>Stern and cold, looking straight between the eyes of that dark,
mocking face, 'What name have you in mind, sir?' Colombino asked.
'You cannot guess?'</p>
<p>'Why trouble, since you are here to tell me?'</p>
<p>'You guess that, at least. And you could easily guess the rest,
since the name is your own. No need for dissimulation. It would
merely waste our time.' From the breast of his tunic, Malavolti
plucked a sheet, and proffered it. 'I found this letter among
Squillanti's papers.'</p>
<p>Colombino leaned across the table to take it. It was his letter
to Squillanti, with the news that Messer Gritti had been to see
him, but that he temporized and thus maintained the pretext under
which he kept his army standing. He frowned as he weighed the
expressions he had employed. Still frowning, with something haughty
in his stare, he looked at Malavolti.</p>
<p>Does this incriminate me?'</p>
<p>'Less, much less, than two other letters which I found with it.
But still, enough. It would not be easy for you to explain why
Squillanti should be interested in your keeping the Company of the
Dove at its full strength. Nor yet what you mean when you speak of
a pretext. And you might be asked to explain these matters on the
rack.' Malavolti smiled. 'At such times the fertility of a man's
invention will commonly desert him. And the rack has been very busy
in Siena these last four and twenty hours.'</p>
<p>'I gather that you are threatening me. It's a rashness I don't
understand.'</p>
<p>'Threatening you?' Malavolti laughed outright, and now the ring
of his laughter surprised Colombino by its sincerity. 'You may well
not understand a rashness that would proclaim me a fool. Should I
come to you in secret? Should I thrust myself into the lion's den
if I came to threaten? My dear Colombo, use your wits. If I were
not your friend, you would not now be alive. Ask yourself why I,
who have spared no other man concerned in this conspiracy, should
have refrained from denouncing you with the others. Ask
yourself.'</p>
<p>'I have done so. But I can't find the answer. They tell me that
your credit stands high in Siena for the shambles you have made
there. If it was in your power to increase that credit by yet
another victim, I don't know why, being what you are, you should
not have done so.'</p>
<p>'This is to play comedy,' said that grim comedian, with a
careless smile. 'Leave heroics. Let us be practical. I am, above
all, a practical man, without false sentiment of any kind.
Sentiment is an expression of weakness, either of the head or of
the heart. It is not for you and me, who are strong men.'</p>
<p>'The association flatters me.'</p>
<p>'I hope so. For I look to see it carried further. Much further.
I take my opportunities when I perceive them. Had I yielded to
mawkish sentiment I should not now be hailed in Siena, as you
hailed me, as the Saviour of the State. Petrucci is in a foam of
rage to see his star obscured. Piccolomini has shut himself up with
his spleen at my ascendancy' He laughed his rich, deep-throated
laugh, and, entirely at his ease, found himself a chair and sat
down.</p>
<p>'So let us be frank with each other. You will perceive the
futility of dissembling when I tell you that my information of your
share in the business does not rest upon these letters. I had it
all from Silvio Pecci. It was he who betrayed the plot to me,
chiefly so that he might pull you down. That woman of
Squillanti's...But that's no matter. The irony is amusing. The
lovely Silvio betrayed a dozen men, so that he might destroy just
you; and of that dozen, you are the only one who has escaped so
far.' He paused. 'You do not even smile, Colombo.'</p>
<p>'It is not amusing.' And then for an instant he yielded to his
passion. 'God's blight on that fribble! I should have strangled him
with my hands when he was here.'</p>
<p>Malavolti sat back, and threw one shapely, vigorous leg over the
other. He toyed with a gold tassel at the breast of his purple
tunic. He sighed as he smiled. 'So often we are wise too late. Take
warning, my friend. Do not commit that error twice.'</p>
<p>'Shall we be coming to the matter that brings you here? Will you
tell me why you spared me whilst sending so many worthy men to
their doom? For this, I take it, is what you have come to tell
me.'</p>
<p>'Of course. And you are wrong to sneer, as you shall come to
agree, I hope.</p>
<p>'When that poor pimp Silvio chose me rather than another for his
disclosure, it was because he knew my love for Siena. What he did
not suspect'&mdash;and now Malavolti became slowly
emphatic&mdash;'was that I should perceive merit in the plot. When
I came to take thought, I was persuaded that a duke would be to the
advantage of the State. The only thing I could not approve was the
person chosen by the plotters for the office. Squillanti was
certainly not the man. A good-natured, clumsy blunderer who
suffered from a delusion, amongst others, that he was a great
soldier. The gonfalon of the Church was his ruin. If he had not
been a fool to the marrow, he would never have brought such a
creature as Silvio Pecci into the business.' He affected gloom, and
heaved a sigh. 'I was sorry to take off Squillanti's head. I had an
affection for the man. But there was no help for it. All had to be
removed; that is to say, all but you, Ser Colombo. Do you wonder
why? Yet surely it is clear. Because you and your army will be as
necessary to impose the duke of my choice upon Siena as to impose
Squillanti. Do you begin to understand?'</p>
<p>'At last. And the duke of your choice?'</p>
<p>'Can you not guess? Do you know a better man than myself?'</p>
<p>'Yourself! The Saviour of the State!' Colombino laughed in
anger, and smote the table violently with his hand. 'God's light!
And to further your treacherous ambition, you play the patriot, and
bring a dozen of the noblest heads in Siena to the block!'</p>
<p>'And thereby so establish myself in the people's trust and love
that my transition to the dukedom is already half-accomplished.
Don't overlook that.'</p>
<p>'I am in danger of overlooking nothing. If this is what you came
for, you might have spared yourself the journey You may be the duke
of your own choice; but, as God's my witness, you are not the duke
of mine.'</p>
<p>Malavolti betrayed no resentment. His smile grew tolerant
even.</p>
<p>'I think I understand. After all, it seems that you are not
immune from the weakness of sentimentality That is what is stirring
in you, masquerading as righteous indignation. If you were ready to
set up a duke in Siena, it must be&mdash;for I assume you
honest&mdash;that you thought Siena would fare better under a duke.
Can you truly suppose that my merit is less than Squillanti's?' He
stood up suddenly, majestic in his carriage, in his height and
vigour. 'Surely you behold in me a man of firmer purpose, a man of
the fibre necessary for government. If you were ready to support
Squillanti, why should you not be ready to support me?'</p>
<p>'Support him!' Colombino ejaculated. And there he checked,
smothering the ironic laughter that was struggling to his lips. He
turned aside and strode to one of the windows. He leaned upon the
sill, and stood looking out upon the courtyard where the shadows
were lengthening. Of what avail to tell the truth to this mocker?
He spoke without turning.</p>
<p>'I lend myself to no more attempts to set up a duke in
Siena.'</p>
<p>He heard Malavolti's sigh, and turned at last as his visitor
began to speak. 'You drive me to odious extremes by your obstinacy
I may not be the duke of your choice, as you have told me; but you
are certainly the soldier of mine. Since together we cannot fail, I
cannot do without you. Therefore, either you support me as I invite
you, or I must do my duty by the State. I must discover those
letters that you wrote to Squillanti. You perceive that I have no
other choice, especially as I have been so frank with you.'</p>
<p>It was never more fortunate for Colombino than at this moment
that he was a man of deliberate thought. He perceived quite clearly
the deadly peril in which he stood. No indulgence of the hot rage
that surged in him against this laughing scoundrel would avail him
here.</p>
<p>'There is something that has escaped your calculations,' he said
slowly. 'The man who denounced me to you, this Silvio Pecci, will
never suffer that I, the one man whose ruin he desired, should
escape. Indeed, he may impeach you with me, for not having used
your knowledge of my guilt.'</p>
<p>Malavolti uttered a chuckle of relief. 'Is that where the shoe
pinches? Faith, if you suppose that I overlooked that, then you are
right to suppose me unfit to rule. My friend, that danger was the
first thing I perceived. And I removed it. Messer Silvio will
trouble us no more.'</p>
<p>He went on to relate quite frankly and with relish, as if taking
pride in his subtlety, the story of yesterday's morning walk with
Silvio, and its abrupt ending in a pool of the Arbia.</p>
<p>'In Leda's Bathing Pool. "I am sorry that I have no Leda for
you," I said to him, and left him swimming there, like a fly in a
bowl of milk.' He laughed at the memory of it and at the amusing
image he had used yesterday, and now used again. And he repeated
it: 'Like a fly in a bowl of milk.'</p>
<p>Colombino pondered him with amazed disgust, less perhaps because
of that cold-blooded murder for purposes of calculating greed than
because he could find amusement in remembering and relating it.
Malavolti perceiving only the amazement in the soldier's glance,
and accepting it as a tribute to his lively wit, crossed the room,
to set a friendly hand upon his shoulder.</p>
<p>'So let no thought of Silvio prove the obstacle. He's been safe
in Hell these six and thirty hours. Come, now.' His tone became one
of friendly cajolery 'Consider where your interest lies. You'll
find me a better master than ever Squillanti would have been. When
I am duke, your place will be assured.'</p>
<p>Colombino's soul was shuddering under the touch of that jovial
murderer's hand; his pride was in revolt against the promise of
patronage from such a man; his impulse was to strike the
self-assured smile from that mocking, masterful face. Instead,
however, he came out of a momentary absorption to answer Malavolti
as the man required.</p>
<p>'So be it,' he said. 'Since you have disposed of Silvio, you
have disposed of my objections.' He smiled. 'For the rest, I really
have no choice.'</p>
<p>'In that you are perhaps more fortunate than you yet perceive.'
Malavolti, gay now that he had prevailed, slapped his shoulder with
amicable vigour. 'We understand each other, then?'</p>
<p>'Oh, yes. Be sure of that. You'll stay to sup?'</p>
<p>But Malavolti shook his head. He had come in secret, and he
would not have his unmasked face beheld by Colombino's servants. He
would drink, however, a cup of Montasco, to pledge their
association.</p>
<p>So when he had resumed his mask and cloak, the wine was brought.
It was the same that Caterina Squillanti had drunk there two days
ago. How all the world had changed since then!</p>
<p>Malavolti savoured it, and spoke of it in terms of praise.</p>
<p>'You must see my vineyards as you go,' said Colombino. 'I will
walk down the hill with you to set you on your way I am proud of my
vines. So proud that I begrudge the time my soldiering steals from
them.'</p>
<p>And so, Malavolti leading his horse and the condottiero stepping
beside him, they went down that southern slope of Montasco, which
fell away to the densely wooded valley of the turbulent
Ombrone.</p>
<p>The soldier now was lost in the husbandman. With pride and
knowledge Colombino pointed out the features of the place he had
fashioned: his method of training the vines, so as to ensure for
the fruit the maximum of sunlight, and in particular his laborious
provision for irrigation. On the lowest terrace of all he brought
his guest to the vast estang, and explained to him the sluices
opening to the river, so that flooding might be avoided in time of
water-plenty.</p>
<p>Malavolti admired the pleasant lingering-place that Colombino
had here created. The rocks over which the water had been led to
cascade into the estang were guarded by a colossal stone figure of
Hercules leaning upon his club. About three sides of the great tank
pillars of rough-hewn granite carried a framework of beams, over
which lemon and orange trees had been trained to make a cool and
fragrant roof. Seats of white marble invited repose in that green
shade beside the placid sheet of water which reflected now the
ensaffroned evening sky But Colombino was still the husbandman and
engineer.</p>
<p>'This,' he explained, 'ensures water for our fields beyond in
times of drought. A deal has been drawn off today As you see, the
level has sunk considerably But it will be full to the rim again by
morning, and meanwhile there is no lack. The depth is fully twenty
feet.'</p>
<p>Malavolti stood beside the low parapet and looked down. Near the
smooth sides of the tank the water, some six feet below, was green
with vegetation, patches of which bore now a snowy bloom. He
commended the fine storage so easily procured. He must do something
of the kind on his property of the Arbia.</p>
<p>'Now what in Heaven's name can that be?' wondered Colombino, and
pointed.</p>
<p>To follow the indication of his hand, Malavolti craned farther
out over the water.</p>
<p>'I can see nothing,' he complained.</p>
<p>'You need to get a little nearer,' said Colombino, with a queer,
sudden laugh.</p>
<p>A moment Malavolti strove desperately against the hands that had
seized and were impelling him. Then he plunged headlong down to
plumb the water's depth, even as yesterday on the Arbia he had sent
another.</p>
<p>With a foot on the parapet and an elbow on his knee, Colombino
leaned over to survey the floundering, discomfited patrician.</p>
<p>'I follow your advice, Malavolti. This time I do not make, as I
did with Silvio, the mistake of being wise too late.'</p>
<p>Malavolti, scarcely able to swim, kept himself precariously
afloat by frantic struggles. His eyes bulged in his upturned, livid
face. 'Scoundrel! Inhuman beast! Will you see me drown?'</p>
<p>'Only sentiment could persuade me to rescue you. And sentiment,
Malavolti, as you so truly said, is not for strong men such as you
and I.'</p>
<p>He took his foot from the parapet, and turned away. Malavolti
began a screech that ended in a gurgle. Colombino stepped back, on
a sudden thought.</p>
<p>'And I am sorry that I have no Leda for you in your watery
adventure.'</p>
<p>But it is to be doubted if the wildly splashing Malavolti heard
him.</p>
<p>Colombino went to untether the patrician's horse. He loosed the
girths, and removed saddle and bridle, lest these should lead to
easy identification. Then, with a stinging cut across the hams, he
drove the animal into the woods by the river.</p>
<p>It was almost dark when, with a tranquil conscience and the
sense of justice poetically done, he regained his villa. In the
hall he summoned his factor.</p>
<p>'Orlando, I observe that the estang is in danger of becoming
foul. You will open the sluices tonight, and let all the filth that
has gathered in it go down the river.'</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-08" id="ch-08"></a>Chapter 8. THE LADY
PARAMOUNT</h2>
<h3>&mdash; i &mdash;</h3>
<p>Pandollini, the Sienese chronicler from whose records so much of
my history of Colombino is derived, makes philosophy at this stage.
He draws attention at length to the furtive manner in which Destiny
spins her threads and the tortuous ways by which she leads man to
fulfilment.</p>
<p>If you mark the sequel you will agree that he is justified. It
will reveal that events which in themselves seemed almost
disconnected were in effect the solid links of a chain that Destiny
was forging. If the chance affair of Monsieur de La Bourdonnaye had
not come to cast into relief, though spuriously, the solid Roman
quality of Colombino's loyalty, he would never have been appointed
Captain-General of Aragon in the Neapolitan campaign. Had he not
been vouchsafed that opportunity to cover himself' with glory, he
would not have been accorded his triumph in Siena on his return,
and consequently could not have been under the delusion which made
him involve himself in the Squillanti conspiracy Had he not so
involved himself, he would not, as he did upon realizing the peril
in which he stood when that matter was discovered, have consented
to avail himself of the Venetian proposals. And had he not done
this, Venetian aims would never have sought fulfilment, and that
which follows for Colombino would never have come to pass.</p>
<p>The decision to enter Venetian service was taken on the same
night that saw the end of the ambitious Malavolti, and was the
direct result of that unsavoury business.</p>
<p>The letters Colombino had written to Squillanti still existed,
and they might at any moment be brought to light. Their terms had
been guarded, and in themselves they might not be enough to
compromise him. But when taken in conjunction with the fact that he
had kept his army standing at full strength, he could not hope to
give them an innocent explanation. He might, of course, at once
disband this army But that would afterwards appear as a measure
taken in panic upon the discovery of the conspiracy, and supply
merely a further measure of incrimination. To say that he had held
his force together whilst considering the Venetian proposals would
hardly suffice. Unless he ended by accepting these proposals, that
would probably be regarded, and rightly, as a pretext. Whilst
nothing might quite definitely be proved against him, yet the
suspicion would be so strong as to represent a risk in believing
him innocent. And it was not the way of Italian states in the
quattrocento to shoulder these risks out of any humanitarian
considerations. The fate of Carmagnola at the hands of Venice and
of Gisberto da Correggio at those of Siena were proof enough of
this.</p>
<p>If Colombino had temporized so long with Venice, it was, we
know, for his own ends. At heart he had no intention of entering
the service of the Serenissima. Of what his experiences were when
he had served her under Colleoni in his early days, we have no
details. But it does seem clearly to transpire that he had no love
for the great Republic of the North, and I suspect that had his
hand not now been forced, had he not been under the necessity of
finding a definite cloak for his part in recent events, he would
not on that same night have despatched a messenger to Siena,
inviting the Venetian orator, Messer Grimani&mdash;by whom Messer
Gritti had lately been replaced&mdash;to do him the honour of a
visit on the morrow.</p>
<p>Messer Grimani came with alacrity and betimes, borne in a mule
litter, for his obesity had bred in him a reluctance for the
saddle.</p>
<p>The interview was brief and definite. Colombino's captains,
Sangiorgio and Caliente, were with him when he received the envoy,
and both were jubilant at the decision which their leader was about
to announce.</p>
<p>Grimani was of the utmost affability, and produced his
parchments, setting forth the terms and the princely stipend upon
which the Count of Ostiamare was to assume supreme command of the
Venetian forces in succession to the great Colleoni, for a term of
three years.</p>
<p>Colombino gave the parchment little more than a cursory glance.
Now that his resolve was taken, he was in haste to have done. He
signed and sealed the bond, and received in exchange the signature
of His Serenity the Doge.</p>
<p>Grimani rubbed his hands. And now that this is happily
concluded, Lord Count, I already have for you the orders of the
Serenissima.'</p>
<p>'You gentlemen of Venice waste no time.'</p>
<p>'We take it by the forelock. My courier will leave today with
the welcome news. On receipt of it, the Venetian captains will be
ordered to assemble on the Brenta there to encamp and wait for you
to come and take command. Their strength will amount to some
fourteen thousand men. With the six thousand of your own&mdash;the
Company of the Dove and your auxiliaries&mdash;you will be at the
head of a magnificently equipped army of twenty thousand. With such
a force you should easily excel the great achievements that already
honour your name. The question now is, How soon can you set
out?'</p>
<p>If Venice was in haste, so was Colombino. The sooner he were
gone the better, lest anything should yet happen to prevent his
going.</p>
<p>'Within a week,' he promised.</p>
<p>Grimani nodded. 'Excellent. Ten days at most to move your
company to the Brenta. You will be there before the middle of
September. The year wears on, so that, as you see, there is need
for haste.'</p>
<p>'I perceive it. And from the Brenta whither?'</p>
<p>'Orders will reach you when you are in camp there. It is
probable that I may be the bearer of them. So that we shall meet
again. I set out for Venice myself today.'</p>
<p>When he was gone, Colombino sat glooming, chin in hand. 'He will
bear me orders from the Ten,' he grumbled, his lip curling as he
looked at his captains. 'That is ever the thorn for him who serves
Venice. Always a commissioner of the Republic at his elbow to spy,
to report, to order, to direct, to thwart. A malediction on that
service! There is no trust in it. Always is the Serenissima as
suspicious as a jealous woman. But we are pledged, and that's the
end of it.'</p>
<p>'You'll find it prove a glorious beginning,' Sangiorgio soothed
him. 'To stand where Colleoni stood, and at your age, child?'</p>
<p>'The only great soldier whose heart they did not break.'</p>
<p>'Because like yours it was too big and stout for their
breaking.'</p>
<p>'What I have I derive from him. Colleoni! It is not ten years
since I commanded ten helmets in his company. And now! I would he
could have lived to see it.'</p>
<p>But whatever his reluctance to serve the Most Serene Republic
and whatever his forebodings, he did not lose sight of the need to
be gone from the Sienese with all despatch, and true to his
promise, within a week of signing, the Company of the Dove was
marching north, a long line of horse and foot, or men-at-arms and
pikemen, of crossbowmen, of engineers with a siege-train drawn by
oxen, and a rear-guard of sutlers with their carts and pack-mules.
Within the time prescribed this host had come to the vast
encampment in the flat low-lying lands by the mouth of the Brenta,
just south of the lagoons, where breezes from the Adriatic tempered
the September heat which was still torrid in that year.</p>
<p>There, whilst awaiting marching orders from the Most Serene, he
was actively employed in drilling and in consolidating into a
homogeneous force the various mercenary companies that went to make
up this great army under his command.</p>
<p>What leisure these duties left him, Colombino fell into the
habit of spending in the little neighbouring town of Chioggia on
the lagoon.</p>
<p>Returning thence one afternoon, when he had been a week or so in
the camp, he came within a half-mile of the town upon a grey friar
and a mule. The mule, tethered to a sapling, was cropping such
green blades as it could find among the parched grass by the dusty
roadside. The friar, who had been sitting near it, rose at
Colombino's approach, and stood forth, a tall, grey figure, whose
face was lost within the shadows of his cowl.</p>
<p>Colombino, conceiving that he understood why the fellow should
thus put himself in his way, groped in his scrip for a coin,
without, however, slackening the pace of his big white charger.
This constrained the friar to fall aside. But he hailed the rider,
employing the conventual phrase:</p>
<p>'God give you peace, noble Captain.'</p>
<p>Colombino laughed as he answered him: 'God take away your alms,
little brother.' Nevertheless, he tossed a piece of silver down
into the dusty road as he sped past.</p>
<p>He heard the friar's voice behind him raised to shout. He
supposed it to be a scandalized rejoinder to his jest, and laughed
again as he rode on.</p>
<h3>&mdash; ii &mdash;</h3>
<p>A little later that day when, having returned to camp, Colombino
sat at his ease in the splendid pavilion that had been set up for
him, seeking profit and finding entertainment in an indifferent
copy of the <i>De Re Militari</i> of Vegetius, a shadow fell across
his papers. Looking up to see who so unceremoniously came to block
the light, he beheld in the entrance a tall, closely cowled grey
friar.</p>
<p>From the depths of the cowl came greeting. <i>Pax tibi</i>.'</p>
<p>'<i>Et tibi pax</i>,' said Colombino carelessly, to add more
sharply: 'Who are you? And how come you past the guard?'</p>
<p>'What guard would hinder a poor little mendicant brother?'</p>
<p>'Is it alms you seek?'</p>
<p>'No. An explanation.' The voice, rich and full, held none of the
humility the man's kind professed. Unbidden, and without ceremony,
he advanced to the camp-table, his hands folded before him within
the capacious sleeves of his coarse habit. 'I come to ask why you
should return me evil words for good.'</p>
<p>Then Colombino remembered him, and understood the question. A
mild resentment of this presumption was blended with amusement.</p>
<p>'You mistook me. I answered you in kind. The peace you augured
me would take away my livelihood, which lies in war. Each to his
trade, little brother.'</p>
<p>'Each to his trade, as you say But what trade is yours? Is it
such a trade as Judas Iscariot drove?'</p>
<p>Colombino frowned. But supposing that he had to deal with some
insane fanatic, he kept his temper. 'I do not remember to have
heard how Judas earned his livelihood; nor at this time of day can
I suppose it matters. You are interrupting me, little brother. I
beg you to go with God.'</p>
<p>The friar, however, was not to be dismissed. 'I had in mind a
transaction by which Judas earned some thirty pieces.'</p>
<p>'Sir Friar, you push my patience somewhat far. To what evil
invention have you been giving heed?'</p>
<p>'Invention? You have the short memory that supports an evil
conscience. You will have forgotten Ravenna and Onorato da Polenta?
That you were once in his hire? That he esteemed you so highly, was
so deceived in you, that he betrothed to you his daughter
Samaritana, his only child? That you, counting your pledge as
naught when it otherwise suited your greedy ambition, betrayed his
trust and went your ways, leaving him at the mercy of his enemies?
Have you forgotten all this?'</p>
<p>Colombino came to his feet, his countenance set and grey, so
that the lines of it seemed sharpened. His eyes were terrible.</p>
<p>'When truth is seasoned with the spice of falsehood, then all
the tale's a lie, Sir Friar.' Lightly and swiftly he stepped round
the table. 'If so be that you are indeed a friar.'</p>
<p>Without other warning he swept back the man's cowl, and so
uncovered the narrow, pallid countenance of Cosimo da Polenta.</p>
<p>They stood a moment eye to eye, a sneer on Cosimo's face,
surprise on Colombino's.</p>
<p>'What do you want of me?' the soldier challenged him. 'To say
what I have said,' replied the priest.</p>
<p>'You deal, then, in futilities. As for what lay between me and
Samaritana, that concerns none but her and me.'</p>
<p>'It concerns every man of the house and blood whose honour you
slighted.'</p>
<p>'Vain words. As vain as the paltry lie that I left the Lord
Onorato at the mercy of his enemies. I so broke up his enemies that
they never again raised a hand against him in his lifetime. God
rest his soul.'</p>
<p>'You pray for him, do you? It's in your part. Order masses for
his soul whilst treacherously advancing the evil that is brewing
for his house.'</p>
<p>'Is your mind unhinged, Sir Priest?'</p>
<p>'Are you not paid by Venice to subdue Ravenna, and so undo what
you were paid to do by the Lord Onorato? Is there in all the world
a trade more treacherous and base than yours?'</p>
<p>'I see. I see,' said Colombino, and grew yet more contemptuous.
'Why, you lunatic, it is war with Milan that is afoot, as all the
world knows by now. That is the sole purpose of my hire.'</p>
<p>Cosimo's dark glance gave him plainly the lie. 'Does it say so
in your parchments? Is there any express condition in them that you
shall serve only against Milan? Is not your hire for the occasions
of the Most Serene?'</p>
<p>Colombino hesitated on a sudden doubt, which he as suddenly
dismissed. 'Ravenna is not one of those occasions.'</p>
<p>'It happens that I am better informed. This coveted southern
outpost is to be swept up by you in passing, and annexed at last to
the Most Serene Republic.'</p>
<p>The doubt returned, and grew in Colombino's mind, thrusting out
resentment. But he resisted it. 'I do not believe you.'</p>
<p>'It comes as news to you, does it? The poor pretence!'</p>
<p>'So far is it from a pretence that if I did believe you, I must
resign my command.'</p>
<p>Bitter mockery was in the other's laugh. 'Comedian! Will you
even pretend that you would dare to play with Venice as you played
with Ravenna? Will you?'</p>
<p>The colour was creeping back into Colombino's face on a rising
tide of anger. His mouth was hard.</p>
<p>'You have doled out insolence enough. You had better go. And
quickly'</p>
<p>Instead, Messer Cosimo came yet a step nearer. His face was
yellow</p>
<p>'First hear what else I have to say I come from Florence. I have
been there to warn the Signory of these Venetian intentions, and I
have made some stir. The Signory will not tolerate a Northern
prepotence such as Venice aims at establishing. Florence is already
arming to intervene and to join hands with Milan. With Florence in
the field and yourself removed, Ravenna should be safe. The first
is assured. I am here to ensure the second. I bring you this!'</p>
<p>On the word his right hand flashed forth from the concealing
sleeve to deal a lightning stroke. But the soldier caught the gleam
of steel in that swift hand, and instincts as swift moved him to
ward the blow. Before attack and defence had even penetrated his
consciousness, he found himself grasping Cosimo's wrist between
both his hands. After that, at grips, they swayed and staggered
across the pavilion. Then, interlocked, like a pair of wrestlers,
they went down and rolled over together.</p>
<p>But from the moment that the surprise had failed, the issue was
in no doubt. When Colombino had at last wrenched away the dagger,
he rose and stood over his assailant. Cosimo struggled to his
knees, and in that posture remained on the defensive, panting.</p>
<p>'Madman!' the soldier growled at him. 'What shall I do with you?
Shall I summon my provost-marshal to take you out and hang you, or
shall I give you back your dagger in your throat?'</p>
<p>Cosimo, livid and breathless, glared baffled hate at him for
only answer.</p>
<p>Thus for a long moment they remained. Then the rigidity of
Colombino's expression softened. He spoke quietly if I do neither,
it is because I perceive a better use for you. Get up! You shall
bear a message for me to your cousin Samaritana. Tell her that in
no circumstances shall my hand be ever raised against her. Tell her
that if your assumptions were correct and her patrimony imperilled,
rather than be the instrument of those who imperil it, I and my
company would hasten to preserve it for her. Bear her that message
with my duty and homage, Messer Cosimo. Here, man, take your
dagger.'</p>
<p>Cosimo picked up the weapon so contemptuously flung to him. He
came to his feet and took a step forward, his body bent, his face
blank in incredulity.</p>
<p>You mean...' He checked, and drew himself erect. 'I can't
believe you.'</p>
<p>'I know. I know. You are like all the rest. Not even your
priesthood makes it easier for you to believe good than evil. But
whether you believe me or not, convey my message. And you had
better go, sir. I do not want to be under the necessity of
explaining you if you are found here.' He turned his back upon
Cosimo, and flung himself as if weary into a chair.</p>
<p>Cosimo stood yet a moment hesitating. Then, he drew the cowl
over his head, folded once more his hands into his sleeves, and
crossed slowly to the entrance. There he paused, and turned.</p>
<p>'I will convey your message,' be said. 'God will not forgive you
if you have lied.'</p>
<p>Colombino answered nothing. He sat as if he had not heard.</p>
<p>Cosimo stepped out into the sunlight. The main body of the camp
lay ahead of him, a city of canvas, green and brown and white, with
bannerols fluttering here and there from the summits of the tents,
and a glimpse of soldiers moving in the lanes between them,
sauntering, hurrying, or lounging. Somewhere in the distance a drum
was beating. Cosimo turned to the right, and with his face to the
sea moved at a calm, leisurely pace over the parched grass. He had
come level with a group of huts, a score of paces from Colombino's
pavilion, when suddenly the daylight was blotted from his
sight.</p>
<p>A cloak that was being tightly twisted enveloped his head.
Strong hands gripped him on either side, and held him powerless.
Then in silence and in darkness, helpless to resist the pressure
exerted, he felt himself being hurried swiftly away.</p>
<h3>&mdash; iii &mdash;</h3>
<p>Messer Paolo Grimani, the commissioner of the Most Serene
Republic, sat on the edge of a day-bed in his pavilion. It was a
tent equipped with a splendour almost barbaric, enriched by a
luxury of hangings, of carpets, of gilded furniture and other
appointments for which heavy toll had been levied on the East.</p>
<p>His worthiness was making a simple collation of figs and rye
bread which he washed down with a heavy golden Greek wine. He was
waited upon by a graceful, fair-haired stripling in scarlet with
the winged lion wrought in gold upon his breast.</p>
<p>Into this scene of peaceful luxury came a young man in a steel
cap in which the little tuft of scarlet feathers proclaimed the
officer. He was mildly excited.</p>
<p>'We have him here, Excellency'</p>
<p>'Ah!' The commissioner dusted some crumbs from his plump
fingers, passed a damask napkin across his lips, and looked up with
dull, slow-moving, benign eyes. In general the appearance of this
sluggish, obese, middle-aged man suggested the amiable
imperturbability of an Eastern idol. 'There was no fuss? No
alarm?'</p>
<p>'None, Excellency'</p>
<p>'Very good. Bring him in.'</p>
<p>The officer stepped to the entrance to issue a command, then
stood aside. Into the pavilion two men-at-arms hustled a man with a
cloak about his head. They loosed the cloak, and pulled it away
together with the cowl, leaving Messer Cosimo da Polenta to blink
at the portly commissioner of the Serenissima.</p>
<p>Messer Grimani gravely considered that proud, dark face, and
still more gravely the black hair above it, falling in a fringe
across the brow.</p>
<p>'For a little brother of Saint Francis,' he said, 'your tonsure
needs enlarging. We have ways of doing it; ways involving the use
of whipcord. They are detestable, but I see no alternative, unless
you tell me that you are not really a little brother of Saint
Francis, and at the same time tell me who you are and what was your
business with the Captain-General of the Venetian forces.'</p>
<p>Cosimo glared at him. 'You do not frighten me.'</p>
<p>'My friend!' Grimani protested.</p>
<p>'And you cannot torture me without sacrilege. I am a
priest.'</p>
<p>'Just so. Just so,' the benign Grimani agreed. 'But unless you
tell me who you are, how am I to believe you? You will be
reasonable, I hope. You come here in disguise. So much is obvious.'
He shrugged his fat shoulders. 'It would be a dreadful thing to put
you to the question, and then discover that you are a priest. It
might be even more dreadful for you than for me. I do not
know.'</p>
<p>'If I answer you, it is because I have nothing to conceal.
Neither my name, nor my business here. I am Cosimo da Polenta,
cousin of the sovereign Countess of Ravenna.'</p>
<p>Grimani betrayed no emotion of any kind. 'Then I need not ask
you what your business was. At least not yet. Take him away, Ser
Montone, and keep him close.'</p>
<p>But Cosimo had yet a word to say 'I'll make no secret of my
business. I came to kill your Captain-General.'</p>
<p>This stirred Grimani at last. He sat upright, and his dull eyes
quickened.</p>
<p>The officer interposed: 'He had a bare knife in his hand when we
took him. It is here.'</p>
<p>Grimani waved it away 'Messer Colombo?' he asked the
officer.</p>
<p>'Oh, I did not succeed,' said Cosimo. 'He wrenched the knife
from me. That he restored it to me was a sign of his Satanic pride.
I...'</p>
<p>Grimani seemed to have lost interest from the moment that he
learnt that the attempt had failed.</p>
<p>'Take him away, Montone. Do as I said. See that he communicates
with nobody. I shall want him again.'</p>
<p>When they had taken him out, Grimani returned to his figs and
his rye bread. Then he put up his legs.</p>
<p>'Set a cushion behind me, boy. So.' He lay back at his ease with
a gusty sigh. Now send someone to the Count of Ostiamare's
pavilion...'</p>
<p>He was interrupted. One of the guards appeared in the entrance,
the flap of which was kept raised.</p>
<p>'The Lord Count of Ostiamare to see your worthiness.' Colombino
came in as light of step as he was heavy of countenance.</p>
<p>The commissioner lifted a jewelled hand in greeting, pointed to
the golden jug on the table at his elbow, and ordered the page to
pour a cup for his potency.</p>
<p>But the soldier waved away the lovely Murano goblet and ignored
the chair that was set for him. His tone was as blunt and
peremptory as the words he uttered.</p>
<p>'I am come to ask your worthiness for precise information upon
Venetian intentions in the approaching campaign. Precise, if you
please.'</p>
<p>Those dull eyes which betrayed nothing and missed nothing looked
at him mildly 'You inquire most seasonably I was about to send for
you. Orders from the Serenissima have just reached me.' He swung
his feet to the ground. 'Help me up, boy.'</p>
<p>Leaning on the arm of his page, he heaved himself from his low
couch, and crossed ponderously to the table in the middle of the
tent, there to unfold and spread a map. He beckoned Colombino to
his side.</p>
<p>'This red line marks the Venetian frontiers on the mainland
which this war is to teach Milan to respect.'</p>
<p>Colombino studied the map, frowning, then tapped it with an
impatient forefinger. 'Here is something I learn for the first
time. Ravenna, I see, is placed within the intended frontier.'</p>
<p>'Ah, yes,' Grimani lisped. 'That is the only change in the old
line, the only increase of territory desired. But very important.
Ravenna is a strong place, necessary as a southern outpost to the
security of Venice. The letters I have just received from the Ten
order that you open the campaign by proceeding to reduce and occupy
it as soon as may be. No resistance is to be expected.'</p>
<p>Colombino straightened himself, and looked down from his fine
height upon the portly Venetian. 'In our compact, Messer Grimani,
there was no mention of this.'</p>
<p>His worthiness seemed unconscious of the asperity in the
Captain's tone. Reflectively he pursed his lips and stroked his
smooth round chin. 'Not specifically No. Ravenna was not mentioned.
But what then? Your hire is for three years. It would be not only
idle, but impossible to specify all that may be required of you
within that time; for it is something that no one could foretell.
Your engagement is for all undertakings that the Ten in their
wisdom may desire.'</p>
<p>'Sir, shall we leave quibbles?'</p>
<p>'Quibbles?' Mildly reproachful was the lift of Messer Grimani's
brows. 'If you dispute what I have said, the quibbling will be
yours, Lord Count.'</p>
<p>Colombino made a gesture of impatience. 'Your worthiness has
been less than frank with me.'</p>
<p>'I? Less than frank? Sir, I am incapable of a lack of frankness
with you. Read your parchment, sir. Refresh your memory.'</p>
<p>'If my parchment confirms what you have just said, then, sir, we
are in a misunderstanding.'</p>
<p>'But how is that possible? How else could your engagement
run?'</p>
<p>Colombino felt himself entangled. He was in despair. 'We are in
a misunderstanding, nevertheless,' he insisted. 'Fortunately, it is
not yet too late to correct it. If I am required to march against
Ravenna, you may have back your parchments. I cannot continue in
Venetian service.'</p>
<p>Grimani looked up at him in positive distress. 'Lord Count, this
is not reasonable. Since when has a captain of fortune dictated to
the State he serves in what undertakings he will serve it?'</p>
<p>'I am not dictating, sir. I am resigning my command.'</p>
<p>'And your grounds?'</p>
<p>'Once I took the pay of Ravenna to deliver her from Venetian
dominion. I cannot now take the pay of Venice to execute a renewal
of that condition.'</p>
<p>The distress in Grimani's face gave place to a benignly tolerant
surprise. But Colombino observed for the first time how shrewd and
hard could be those eyes which appeared so dull and sleepy 'You set
me a riddle, sir,' said the Venetian, smiling up at him. 'You hint
at reasons which elude my simple wits.'</p>
<p>'I hint at nothing. I state quite plainly what honour
forbids.'</p>
<p>'Honour!' Messer Grimani blew out his cheeks in mock gravity
'Oh, the big, round, fat, senseless word! Honour! And on the lips
not of a moonstruck knight-errant, but of a mercenary soldier who
makes a trade of arms! A portent!' He laughed, and swung aside.
'Zannino! Here, boy, give me that cup.'</p>
<p>Colombino became impatient. 'However your worthiness regards it,
I hope you understand me.'</p>
<p>His worthiness paused with the wine-cup almost at his lips. But
his manner lost none of its jocularity 'Then you hope for the
impossible. I know of no reason why a condottiero who was on one
side yesterday should not be on the opposite side tomorrow. It
commonly happens. It supplies one of the reasons why we are never
done with wars in Italy No, Sir Captain.' Still smiling, he shook
his head. 'I am still very far from understanding.'</p>
<p>'That you should not understand the motive is no matter, so long
as you understand the fact. And the fact, sir&mdash;I state it
clearly&mdash;is that sooner than march upon Ravenna, I will resign
my command.'</p>
<p>The Venetian stood looking into his cup. He took a draught
before replying, and he took his time in drinking. When, at last,
having returned the cup to the page, he spoke, his tone and manner
were as smoothly urbane as ever.</p>
<p>'This, Lord Count, if you will suffer me to be frank, is rankest
folly When I said that I did not understand, I was wanting perhaps
a little in candour. After all, I have heard&mdash;as who has
not?&mdash;that once you were to have married the Lady Samaritana
da Polenta, who is now Countess of Ravenna. I must suppose that
some of the tenderness which such a relationship will sometimes
leave behind is responsible for your reluctance. Very romantic. Oh,
very But a captain of fortune, sir, is a practical man concerned
with life's realities.'</p>
<p>'I have the weakness to account honour one of life's realities:
honour, sir, which to you is just a fat, round, senseless
word.'</p>
<p>'But&mdash;Mother Most Holy&mdash;we are not in the age of
chivalry!'</p>
<p>'For your worthiness, perhaps not. For me...In short, since
honour forbids me to undertake anything against Ravenna, it is idle
to talk further.'</p>
<p>Even now Messer Grimani displayed neither heat nor dismay He
fingered his double chin a moment thoughtfully, then shrugged his
fat shoulders, and wandered back to his day-bed.</p>
<p>'If you will commit a folly, why, then, you will.' He sat down.
'But it is not for me to release you from your engagement. I have
no such power, as you should know. All that I can do is to send
word of your wishes to His Serenity and the Council of Ten.
Decision rests with them.'</p>
<p>'At your pleasure.' Colombino bowed. 'But your worthiness will
understand that my own decision is irrevocable. If we are to march
upon Ravenna, there is an end to my command.'</p>
<p>'I will so inform His Serenity You will, of course, do nothing
until I have his answer?'</p>
<p>'I shall hope that his answer will permit me to continue in his
service.'</p>
<p>'That, too, I shall have the honour to communicate to him.'</p>
<p>They parted on this note of courtesy, and Colombino, back in his
pavilion, summoned his marshals, Sangiorgio and Caliente.</p>
<p>When they had heard what was afoot and what were his intentions,
Sangiorgio did not dissemble his dismay A practical man, he
deplored the almost certain sacrifice of a three years' engagement
on excellent pay to a mere matter of sentiment, and being a man who
bluntly spoke his mind, he said so.</p>
<p>But Don Pablo was of a mellower nature. He had a notion of what
Madonna Samaritana meant to Colombino. He had been present that
night at the inn at Bellaria, and he remembered. He turned upon his
brother captain.</p>
<p>'Mother of God, Giorgio, sentiment is of the soul! Will you
weigh ducats against it? Are you just a huckster-at-arms?'</p>
<p>'You may call me that; and yourself the same at the same time.
It's well to call things by their proper names. It helps the
understanding. That's why I say that sentiment should be left out
of these affairs.'</p>
<p>Colombino looked at the gaunt old soldier. 'You may be right,
Giorgio. It just is not my view in this. It might be best if I
resigned my leadership of the Company of the Dove.'</p>
<p>This dismayed Sangiorgio as much as Caliente, and the voices of
both were raised in protest.</p>
<p>'What are you saying, child?' cried the Florentine. 'Without you
there is no Company of the Dove. And perdition take the Doge, the
Ten, and all the rest of them! The Company of the Dove marches
where you will and when you will. Naught else was ever in my mind.
I only bewail the necessity to give up this well-paid service.'</p>
<p>'The necessity is not yet. His Serenity may think it worth while
to sacrifice Ravenna rather than the Company of the Dove.'</p>
<p>But the Doge's answer when four days later it came did not
support this hope. His Serenity expressed distress that a
difference should have arisen at a moment rendered critical by the
news that Florence was arming to ally herself with Milan. This
circumstance alone made it impossible to release the Count of
Ostiamare from his engagement, and His Serenity was confident that
the existing difficulties could be removed. To this end he invited
the Count of Ostiamare to come to Venice and confer with the
Council of Ten.</p>
<p>Messer Grimani, having read the letter to him, awaited his
reply. It was promptly given. With a confident smile Colombino
announced that he would set out at once. For the letter had
revealed to him the strength of his own position and given him the
assurance that in the conference to which he was summoned, it was
his will that must prevail.</p>
<p>But his captains, when presently he told them of it, met his
smiling confidence with furious dismay.</p>
<p>'Are you stark mad, child?' cried Sangiorgio. 'Will you go into
the lions' den?'</p>
<p>'I have been in lions' dens before.'</p>
<p>'Brave Daniel! But this is the Lion of Saint Mark! It has wings!
It stoops like a falcon! Ges!'</p>
<p>And Don Pablo, with a vivid morphological oath, asked him had he
forgotten the fate of Carmagnola.</p>
<p>Colombino seated cross-legged in his pavilion laughed at their
agitation as they stamped to and fro before him.</p>
<p>'What have I to do with Carmagnola?'</p>
<p>'Could cases be more parallel?' Sangiorgio demanded. 'Like you,
Carmagnola was in command of the army of Venice, and his conduct
did not meet the approval of the Most Serene. With fair words, such
as they send you, he was invited to attend before the Ten, whom the
Devil confound. When they had him there, away from his troops, they
did not even weary him with a trial. They just told him that they
no longer trusted him, and they decapitated him between the pillars
in the Piazzetta.'</p>
<p>Colombino remained scornful. 'I am not like Carmagnola.'</p>
<p>'You'll be uncommonly like him by the time they've taken off
your head.'</p>
<p>This Colombino disregarded. 'Carmagnola,' he said, 'was
trafficking in betrayal.'</p>
<p>'So it was supposed,' answered Sangiorgio. 'But it was never
proved. The same will be supposed of you: your proposal to resign
your command and withdraw your company will be described as
treason.'</p>
<p>'That is the pure truth,' added Don Pablo. 'Pura verdad! Heed
it, Don Colombo. Heed it, by God! Don't make a widow of your
company.'</p>
<p>'Listen to me,' Colombino bade them, very earnest now 'There are
facts and factors here which render your fears phantasmal. Florence
is arming to join Milan. This makes things serious for the
Serenissima. The preponderance of force upon which she counted has
vanished, gone over to the other side. Suppose now that the Ten
were to treat me as they treated Carmagnola, you, Sangiorgio, would
be my natural successor in the command of the Company of the Dove.
What would be your immediate decision?'</p>
<p>'March to join the Duke of Milan. Join him at need without pay,
and let the Company of the Dove pay itself out of the pillage of
the Venetian cities we should sack.'</p>
<p>'In what case, then, would Venice find herself? To the forces of
Milan and Florence would be added six thousand of the best and most
experienced troops in Italy today by which the Venetian army would
be diminished. That would be enough for the Serenissima, I think.
Rather than embark upon a foredoomed campaign, she must sue at once
for peace. And do you suppose that the Ten will not perceive this
just as clearly as we perceive it? They are not fools, these
Venetians. You begin to see, I hope, the difference between my case
and Carmagnola's? And that's not all. It is the Venetian desire to
annex Ravenna that has brought in Florence. This makes it doubly
important that Venice should retain my services. It is to persuade
me, perhaps to try to bribe me, that the Ten require my presence.
When they perceive me to stand firm, they will realize themselves
checkmated, and Ravenna will be saved to Samaritana da Polenta.' He
rose. 'It is on this that I go to break a lance with them in the
name of chivalry.'</p>
<p>They were convinced. Colombino had set the thing in a light that
left no shadows, and he started that same day for Venice to do the
same by the Council of Ten.</p>
<p>He was accompanied on that short journey by Messer Grimani, with
a page and two esquires for only escort. A sumptuous barge of ten
oars, sent by the Serenissima, awaited them at Chioggia, and bore
them swiftly to that wonder-city of the lagoons.</p>
<p>Colombino was landed on the steps of the Morosini Palace, a
tall, yellow mansion whose Gothic windows overlooked the Grand
Canal. It was placed, Grimani informed him, at his disposal for as
long as it should be his pleasure to remain in Venice. Within that
sybaritic interior of marble walls, tessellated pavements, carpets
that were like jewels, and richly frescoed ceilings, he found all
prepared for his lavish entertainment, a regiment of lackeys and a
kilted, Dalmatian guard of honour. All this, he thought, was to
treat him as a prince, and very proper.</p>
<h3>&mdash; iv &mdash;</h3>
<p>He was summoned next morning to wait upon the Doge. Landing at
the Piazzetta, and greeted by a blare of trumpets from the
Slavonian guards drawn up to honour him, he strode between the
ominous granite columns of Syrian origin, and under the spell of
the fantastic, voluptuous beauty of the place in the mellow golden
light of that September morning, he entered the ducal courtyard,
passed up the great staircase, and so into the palace.</p>
<p>In the Council Chamber, to which he was instantly conducted, he
found the Ten assembled, and beheld amongst them the lean frame and
cadaverous countenance of his old acquaintance, Messer Francesco
Gritti.</p>
<p>At the middle of the semi-circle which the councillors formed,
and a little above them, sat enthroned the Doge, Cristoforo Moro, a
grey-faced, elderly man with a hard, tight mouth and cold, deep-set
eyes, who for all his patrician blood was coarsely featured as a
peasant. He glowed in the official chlamys of cloth of gold and his
head was crowned by the golden horn that was the emblem of his
princely rank.</p>
<p>The officer who had introduced Colombino conducted him to a
gilded chair, each arm of which was carved into the shape of a lion
with a forepaw resting on an open book. There he found himself at
the focus of the semi-circle formed by the councillors in their
shimmering robes of crimson silk.</p>
<p>Messer Grimani, who was also present, was invited to a stool set
immediately below the ducal dais.</p>
<p>His Serenity, in a voice that was naturally harsh and deep, at
once opened the proceedings. They were informed, he announced, by
Messer Grimani of the Count of Ostiamare's reluctance to march
against Ravenna, and they had, therefore, invited him to come
before them and frankly state his reasons for this reluctance.</p>
<p>Listening to him, Colombino found himself dividing his attention
between what the Doge was saying and the reflection that this was
the father of a man who once had crossed the seas from Crete to
seek his life. Repressing the vivid memories the thought evoked,
Colombino made shift to answer.</p>
<p>Speaking quietly, he confined himself to a repetition of what
already he had told the commissioner. It did not agree with his
notions of honesty that he should take the pay of the Serenissima
to destroy that which he had taken the pay of Onorato da Polenta to
establish.</p>
<p>The deep-set eyes of the Doge considered him coldly Otherwise
there was no expression on that repellent face.</p>
<p>'If that is all your difficulty, Lord Count, you are too late.
For already you have taken the pay of Venice.'</p>
<p>'The moneys shall be returned, Highness.'</p>
<p>Someone laughed, shortly, unpleasantly Colombino, looking
sharply towards the sound, perceived it to have been emitted by
Messer Gritti. He understood at once that he could be assured of at
least one active enemy in this assembly, and that Gritti's
friendliness in Siena had been purely official, in itself a sham, a
mask upon a vindictiveness that nothing could extinguish.</p>
<p>'You do not understand,' said His Serenity 'The money was an
earnest, a symbol of the binding nature of your engagement with the
Most Serene Republic. And if you know anything, sir, of the history
of the Most Serene, you will know that just as she never breaks an
engagement, so she never tolerates the breach in others.'</p>
<p>'She will have to tolerate this, unless Your Serenity agrees to
my terms.'</p>
<p>From Gritti came the snarling interjection: 'Terms!'</p>
<p>It provoked a rustle of silken robes and a subdued murmur of
resentment. The Doge, however, remained coldly inscrutable.</p>
<p>'So you offer terms? We had best hear them.'</p>
<p>'That Ravenna be left in the enjoyment of her independence.'</p>
<p>This time, but for the Doge's imperiously uplifted hand, the
interruption would have been general. His Serenity's voice became
acid.</p>
<p>'So that you, sir, our hired servant, permit yourself to dictate
to us upon matters of policy! It is as amusing as it is audacious.
And yet it is, I suppose, what we should expect, from a man whom we
find practising with the enemy.'</p>
<p>Colombino was moved inwardly to indignation at this early hint
that his captains had been right. Since such words were used to
him, it must be in the minds of the Ten to deal with him as they
had dealt with Carmagnola. They had invited him here, so that they
might trap him. Presently they should perceive their
miscalculation. He was coldly haughty in his answer.</p>
<p>'Practising with the enemy? I? What fable, sir, is that?'
Instead of answering him, the Doge's glance sought the attendant
officer. 'Ser Barnab,' he said, and made a sign.</p>
<p>It was evidently something preconcerted, for the officer stepped
at once to the door, and opened it. Beyond the threshold two
Slavonians waited with a prisoner. This prisoner, the officer
beckoned forward, and when he had entered, closed the door upon his
guards.</p>
<p>'Look at that man,' the Doge commanded. And tell me if you know
him.'</p>
<p>Colombino turned, and, to his surprise, beheld Cosimo da Polenta
in his black priestly gown.</p>
<p>'I know him, yes,' and Colombino named him.</p>
<p>'His presence will supply the answer to your question. You will
not trouble to deny that disguised as a friar he penetrated the
lines on the Brenta, and visited you secretly in your tent. In
leaving you, he was arrested by the orders of Messer Paolo
Grimani.'</p>
<p>The Doge may have thought to dismay him by this display of the
secrecy and thoroughness of Venetian methods. He awakened only the
scorn which accusation based on rash assumption must ever
deserve.</p>
<p>'Since it is true, why should I trouble to deny it? But that
Messer Cosimo should have visited me unbidden is very far, it seems
to me, from proving that I practise with the enemy.'</p>
<p>'Does he not represent the enemy? One of the enemies? And was it
not just after his visit that you announced your scruples to Messer
Grimani? Does that prove nothing?'</p>
<p>'It proves the truth. That his visit made me aware of Venetian
intentions concerning Ravenna.' Then, with an abrupt change of
manner, he took a bold, impatient tone. 'And, anyway, I am not here
upon my examination, but to state to you the terms upon which I
will continue in your service.'</p>
<p>The smile that broke on the grey face of the Doge was almost
sinister.</p>
<p>'It happens that the possession of Ravenna is a necessity to
Venice for the security of her mainland provinces; and you should
understand, sir, that the necessities of the Republic cannot yield
to the personal scruples of one of her servants.'</p>
<p>'That I readily admit. Therefore, it only remains for me to take
my leave, and depart from Venetian service.'</p>
<p>Again there was that impatient, resentful stir among the Ten.
But Cristoforo Moro remained stolid.</p>
<p>'There are grave obstacles to our permitting it. You are aware
that Florence has entered into alliance with Milan, thus increasing
the odds we have to encounter.'</p>
<p>'Just as I am aware that it is your intention concerning Ravenna
that has brought Florence into that alliance. Ravenna, sirs, is a
wall against which you'll break your obstinate heads.'</p>
<p>'The feelings you betray show plainly how little guaranty we
should have, if we consented to release you, that you would not
pass with your company into the service of the other side. Indeed,
we have every reason to assume that you will have that course in
view.'</p>
<p>'I am prepared solemnly to engage myself to enter no service
making war on Venice.'</p>
<p>'We have already seen, sir, how you treat an engagement.'</p>
<p>'What you have seen is that I treat it with fidelity even when
it is overpast.'</p>
<p>'God give me patience with you, sir! We cannot argue forever. My
brethren here agree with me that, since we can now place no trust
in you, we cannot suffer you to depart again.'</p>
<p>The agreement of the Ten was instant, unanimous and loud. It
brought Colombino to his feet in a bound.</p>
<p>'Will you bray at me?' he thundered, and by his voice and
attitude cowed them into silence. Every line of his face had
hardened. It had assumed again that aspect of being carved of
granite, and his deep-set eyes were terrible. He swept that crimson
semi-circle with his glance, and brought it at last to rest upon
the Doge. He spoke as if he were upon the drill-ground. 'Let us be
plain. Am I a prisoner?' He paused for an answer, stern, haughty,
formidable. After a moment, interpreting that silence, he relaxed
again, and subdued his voice to a tone of cold rebuke. 'I came here
in response to Your Serenity's invitation and trusting to your good
faith.'</p>
<p>Gritti broke in, to mock him with the very thought that was in
his mind.</p>
<p>'So did Carmagnola, in like case. Like you he swaggered here
before us with a soldier's hectoring ways. Like him you may...' He
spread his bony hands, his yellow face cracked across in an evil
grin, expressing the hatred that at long last was to be
gratified.</p>
<p>Not in all his life had Colombino been moved to such anger as
that which now boiled within him. But he repressed it. He allowed
only his contempt of them to show upon the surface, and in that
contempt he laughed now in Messer Gritti's face.</p>
<p>'If you think to constrain me by threats, my masters, you waste
your breath. And you, Messer Gritti, lie clumsily and loutishly out
of your spite when you compare me with Carmagnola. There is no man
knows better than yourself the quality of my integrity. I made you
sweat once for doubting it, and that stirs your malice, I suppose.
The only similarity between Carmagnola's case and mine lies in the
treacherous manner in which by fair words he was lured to Venice by
the Council of his day.'</p>
<p>There was such an explosion of wrath as only an ugly truth
provokes. Every member of the Ten was on his feet, fury in voice
and gesture, calling upon His Serenity to make an immediate end of
this insolence.</p>
<p>But Colombino was not yet done. 'Hear yet a word, sirs!' He
plucked a folded parchment from the breast of his purple tunic.
'When I came, I offered you a choice. You might retain my service
if you abandoned the undertaking against Ravenna. Now that I know
you better, that offer is withdrawn. I am not Carmagnola. I am
Colombo da Siena; and I do not serve such masters.' He ripped the
folded sheet across and yet across, and flung the rags of it at the
feet of the Doge. 'There, sirs, is your parchment.'</p>
<p>Eleven pairs of eyes considered him balefully in the hush that
followed. Grimani's was the only countenance that remained gloomily
wistful. His Serenity, with no vestige of serenity left in his
livid countenance, harshly cawed two words.</p>
<p>'The guard!'</p>
<p>The officer flung the door wide, and rapped out a command. Four
Slavonians in red, with steel caps and corselets, clattered in, and
ordered their halberts.</p>
<p>But Colombino had yet a word to say So far he had merely
displayed the husk. The kernel was still to offer these gentlemen.
One backward glance he swept as the guards came in, and almost
smiled to see how white and startled was the face of Cosimo da
Polenta. Then he was confronting the Doge once more.</p>
<p>'Before Your Serenity pushes rashness too far, you would do well
to weigh the consequences, and realize that you are in danger of
precipitating the very thing you have good cause to fear. My
marshals, Giorgio di Sangiorgio and Don Pablo Caliente, have my
clear orders that, in the event of any harm befalling me, they are
to march the Company of the Dove into the service of the Duke of
Milan. From what Your Serenity has already said, I know that you
perceive what this would mean for Venice. There will be an end to
your hopes in this campaign. Indeed, there will be no campaign,
unless you insist upon wooing destruction.'</p>
<p>That he had left clear commands was an inaccuracy, perhaps. But
negligible since he no more than stated the avowed intentions of
his captains. A silence of utter dismay was presently followed by
angry, excited gibberings, which Moro finally quelled. Very grave,
he addressed the officer.</p>
<p>You will remove both your prisoners. But you will keep them both
at hand until I call for them again.'</p>
<p>Colombino and Cosimo were led out, to leave the Council to
deliberate in secret upon the fate they would measure out to the
audacious condottiero.</p>
<p>In the antechamber, where they waited, the prisoners were under
no restraint, and here to Colombino pacing restlessly came a very
subdued and humbled Cosimo.</p>
<p>'Lord Count, you have made me sick with shame. In all humility I
ask your forgiveness for the words I used to you, the attempt I
made upon you. I would that the Lord Onorato could have lived to
know how deceived he was.'</p>
<p>Colombino was touched by this proud man's contrition.</p>
<p>'You had but the appearances upon which to found your judgment.
That is how men must ever judge.'</p>
<p>'If I live to leave Venice, Samaritana, at least, shall know of
this. All of it. She shall learn how nobly you have borne yourself
so as to champion her helplessness.'</p>
<p>'Yes. You owe me that.' The soldier's face grew wistful. He
sighed. 'I could wish her to see in this a proof of the devotion
that has never faltered since the day when for her own sake I
renounced her. Tell her that, too, Ser Cosimo. And give her this.'
He detached from his breast a great emerald set in brilliants that
had been the gift of the Queen of Naples. 'Beg her to keep this in
memory of one who is ready to give all in her dear service.'</p>
<p>Cosimo stared at him with round eyes. The hand in which he took
the emerald was shaking.</p>
<p>'She is that to you? I do not understand. She is that to you,
and you...'</p>
<p>Ser Barnab, bethinking himself that this muttered conversation,
scraps of which had reached him, might be against the wishes of the
Ten, broke in to part them, so that Messer Cosimo was left with his
perplexing problem.</p>
<p>A moment later a summons came from His Serenity, but now only
for the Count of Ostiamare.</p>
<p>Conversation among the Ten was fading to a hum when Colombino
advanced once more to the gilded chair, and took his stand by
it.</p>
<p>The Doge cleared his throat. There was anxiety in his sunken
eyes, and in the kneading movement of his gnarled hands upon the
arms of his throne.</p>
<p>'Lord Count, your presumptuous bearing before us, the
insubordination you have shown, and the threats you have been so
bold as to utter, are responsible for any harshness in our decision
concerning you.</p>
<p>'You hold us in check by the threat that your army will go over
to the enemy if we take against you any of the measures which your
conduct justifies.</p>
<p>'In the duty which we have to the Republic, we must meet this
threat by a counter-threat, and your check by a counter-check.</p>
<p>'Messer Grimani will return to the army on the Brenta today He
will inform your marshals that they are required to place
themselves and the troops of the Company of the Dove at the
disposal of Messer Orlando Gonzaga, who goes to replace you in the
supreme command of the army. Messer Grimani will warn your captains
that any attempt on their part to evade this order, or otherwise
depart from the engagement to serve the Most Serene Republic into
which you entered for them, will be attended by your instant
decapitation here in Venice.</p>
<p>'You remain, meanwhile, a prisoner in our hands; but merely as a
hostage. So long as your captains are submissive, you shall be
courteously entreated. For the sake of all concerned, and
particularly for your own, we hope that your captains and your men
love you well enough to refrain from conduct which you will pay for
with your life.</p>
<p>'That is all, Lord Count.'</p>
<p>The droning voice ceased. Colombino stood a moment stiffly
upright. Then he swept a bow that took in the whole assembly,
turned on his heel, and went out, his head erect, his heart of
lead. For not even the reflection that at least he had saved his
head from being taken off immediately could console him for his
failure to save Samaritana from becoming the victim of Venetian
acquisitiveness.</p>
<p>Without accomplishing this, he had temporarily sacrificed his
liberty and placed his life in a jeopardy from which he might never
extricate it.</p>
<p>His marshals had been right. He should not have come.</p>
<h3>&mdash; v &mdash;</h3>
<p>The Council of Ten sat long in secret session after Colombino's
removal.</p>
<p>And outside in the antechamber with his guards sat Messer
Cosimo, listlessly waiting, in ignorance of the Council's decision
touching Colombino, whom he had seen depart under escort, and
wondering, but almost without hope, what might be the decision
touching himself.</p>
<p>For two long hours he waited, staring at those tall closed
doors, and when at long last they opened, it was merely to give
egress to Messer Grimani.</p>
<p>The portly envoy approached him, his manner smooth and
friendly</p>
<p>'You are to come with me, Ser Cosimo.'</p>
<p>It surprised him that their destination should be the camp on
the Brenta. But on the morrow, having been housed for the night in
one of Messer Grimani's tents, he discovered that this was merely a
stage on the journey, made because of the business with which
Messer Grimani was charged.</p>
<p>The envoy's interview with Colombino's captains, of which Messer
Cosimo knew nothing, had been a violent one. That is to say, his
communication had been violently received. He himself had
preserved, if with some difficulty, his mild benignity, even when
Don Pablo had threatened to cut him into collops. His unanswerable
arguments, however, had prevailed, and assured that Orlando
Gonzaga, the new commander, was not likely to have trouble with the
Company of the Dove, Messer Grimani set forth again on the morrow
with now a strong escort to attend him.</p>
<p>To Cosimo's ever-increasing wonder, they rode to Ravenna. They
reached it in a deluge of rain on the afternoon of the following
day.</p>
<p>Cosimo, informed by then that Messer Grimani came as the envoy
of the Serenissima to the Countess, and conceiving no reason
against it, was sponsor for him and his fifty lances not only at
the city gate, but also in the rocca, where in his cousin's name he
ordered quarters to be placed at their disposal.</p>
<p>But when he would at once have conducted Grimani to the
Countess, who nowadays had her apartments in the fortress, the
portly ambassador excused himself. He pleaded fatigue. He would
rest awhile before seeking audience. Meanwhile, let Cosimo announce
him. Also, Cosimo, no doubt, would have much to tell his cousin
after his absence. The amiable Messer Grimani was too considerate
to deny the cousins the satisfaction of a preliminary private
interview.</p>
<p>Gratefully the priest went in quest of Samaritana. He found her
in the principal chamber of the apartments she had made her own on
an upper story of the rocca, the doors of which opened onto an
embattled parapet, commanding a view of the sea to the east and of
the wide plains that swept away to the distant hazy line of the
Apennines on the west. It was a prospect all blurred that afternoon
by mist and rain.</p>
<p>She rose as he entered and rustled forward to greet him, a
Samaritana upon whom the two years that were sped since her
disillusion had made no visible impression. She was not more than
twenty-two, and the resilience of youth had absorbed the shocks of
the blows that Fate had dealt her.</p>
<p>'What does it mean, Cosimo? They tell me you come with an escort
of Venetians.'</p>
<p>The escort is for Messer Paolo Grimani, envoy of the
Serenissima. I merely accompany him, more or less as his prisoner.
I come from Venice.'</p>
<p>'From Venice? You have been to Venice? On my behalf?' Her eyes
grew tender.</p>
<p>Although little in this narrative may hitherto have led you to
suppose it, yet Cosimo da Polenta was of an orderly mind. He knew
that if time is to be saved and understanding ensured, a tale
should be told from the beginning. And so he told his tale now from
the moment of his seeking Colombino on the Brenta.</p>
<p>The only interruption he suffered was when he came to relate his
attempt on Colombino's life and the reasons that had spurred him to
it.</p>
<p>'You believed that!' she cried out.</p>
<p>He smiled. 'I believed it then. But I know better now. I have
learnt a good deal since, although there is still a good deal I do
not understand at all. Yet you...' He broke off. 'But we will come
to that at the end. First let me render a full account.'</p>
<p>When he had rendered it, he proffered the jewel and faithfully
delivered the message with which Colombino had charged him. To his
amazement there were tears in her dark eyes, and her sensitive lips
quivered as she spoke.</p>
<p>'Yes. That is Colombo da Siena, as perhaps none knows him but I.
To the world he is just a soldier of great skill, the first captain
of mercenaries in Italy. To me he is a very perfect knight, a
survival from another age.'</p>
<p>'He is this to you?' Cosimo's amazement vibrated in his voice.
'I go from bewilderment to bewilderment. There was an affront he
put upon...'</p>
<p>'There was no affront. All that is false.' She looked up,
sitting straight and slim in her tall chair of gilded leather, her
hands in her lap, and in one of these the glowing emerald. 'There
was sacrifice, as there is now. Yes, you may well stare at me. In
my cowardice I have allowed these things to be believed. My father
would never have forgiven me had he known the truth. Since his
death it has never occurred to me to speak of it to you. But if you
had told me of your intentions, you would have heard the tale.'</p>
<p>He heard it from her now, and so, at last, all that still
puzzled him was made clear. He was profoundly moved, scornful
even.</p>
<p>'I do not wonder that you feared to tell your father. But this
pledge you gave Moro...'</p>
<p>'Don't you understand? All that ended that night at Bellaria. I
saw him then for what he was. A devil. He used threats to me. Vile
threats that disclosed his loathsome nature. But why talk of
it?'</p>
<p>'And Colombo, then? This man of whom you can speak so
tenderly?'</p>
<p>She understood, and shook her head, a sad little smile on her
lips.</p>
<p>'Could he return, after such a departure? Besides, he was not
the man to return unless he thought I wanted him. I remember so
well his words. "When I marry I shall hope to be a husband, not a
penance; a lover, not a hair shirt to a woman's tender flesh." How
was he to know...' She checked, and lowered her eyes.</p>
<p>'That you would make him welcome? Is that what you would say,
Samaritana?'</p>
<p>'Why should I not? You are not only my cousin, but a priest.
Regard it as a confession. It will ease me to speak of it.
Afterward, when I had leisure here to think after my return from
that ride to Bellaria, when the wounds of my disillusion had
healed, and I could contrast him with the worthless man whose arts
had infatuated me, then yes. I wanted him back. I ached for him,
Cosimo, and every night I have prayed that he might one day return.
This'&mdash;she looked at the jewel in her palm&mdash;'this and his
dear message give me hope.' And then from wistfully contemplative,
her manner changed abruptly to apprehension. 'But where is he
now?'</p>
<p>Cosimo had yet to tell her that he supposed him to remain in
Venetian hands.</p>
<p>She sprang up, suddenly white, her eyes wide. 'He lives?' she
cried. 'At least he still lives?'</p>
<p>'Oh, yes. He lives. Messer Grimani assured me of that. They and
he are in a stalemate. They dare not put him to death, because if
they did, the Company of the Dove would join their enemies, and
these are already overwhelming.'</p>
<p>She moved a moment aimlessly about the room in agitation. 'This
Venetian who comes with you? This Grimani. Bring him to me. Bring
him at once.'</p>
<p>Cosimo made haste to obey, such haste that when presently
Grimani was ushered into her presence, his portliness was a little
out of breath.</p>
<p>She stood to receive him, straight and tall, her slenderness
stressed by the mourning gown of black velvet that sheathed her
from foot to neck. The only ornament that relieved it was an
emerald set in brilliants worn upon her breast.</p>
<p>Grimani took a sensualist's pleasure in the contemplation of her
stateliness, her graceful lines, and the nobility of that young
face, showing white as ivory between the collar of the funereal
black gown and the lustrous black hair above. He bestowed a
courtier's approval upon the dignity with which she gave him
welcome, as sinking to the chair by which she stood, she invited
him also to be seated, and to state his errand. Cosimo went to take
his stand behind her. Thus Messer Grimani was confronted by two
pairs of eyes.</p>
<p>His opening startled both of them.</p>
<p>'Madonna, the gravest issues bring me here. At this moment it is
not too much to say that the fate of Italy is in your hands.'</p>
<p>She stared at him, then her lip was raised in a little smile of
deprecation. 'You are pleased to flatter me,' she said.</p>
<p>'You think so? You shall judge.' He leaned forward, an elbow on
his massive knee. 'Venice, as you know, is preparing to renew the
struggle with Milan, so as to ensure her rights on the mainland. To
render them permanent and so as to reduce the danger of further
wars by which the people are harassed, the Serenissima aims at
enlarging her frontiers at certain necessary points. The discovery
that Ravenna is included in these aims, and the advocacy with the
Medici employed by your cousin Messer Cosimo da Polenta, has
resulted in a declaration by Florence that if we go further with
these intentions the Signory will cast her lot with Milan. The
alliance, I understand, has not yet been signed. But the resolve is
formed. This may be merely the beginning of a conflagration that
may involve the whole of Italy So long as the issue was left
between us and Milan, the danger would have been circumscribed. But
once Florence takes the field, who shall say what other states may
not feel themselves compelled to bear a hand? You perceive,
madonna, the gravity of the moment: the ruin, the desolation of
which this may be the eve?'</p>
<p>'That I perceive. But not for what I count in it.'</p>
<p>'I shall hope to make it plain. Milan desires strife no more
than we do, who have been driven to it by the sense of injustice
under which we lie. A compromise is possible. Some of the
guarantees we ask for in the shape of strongholds on the mainland,
Milan if left alone will yield. In the fate of Ravenna, Milan is
not interested. But if Florence joins her, then Milan will go
forward, and all compromise will be impossible. Now Florence is
being brought in upon your representations. Therefore, it is
possible that upon your representations she might consent to hold
her hand, and all the threatened misery and carnage of war will
have been averted. Is not that worth while, madonna?'</p>
<p>He pursed his lips, the incarnation of benevolence, folded his
hands, sat back, and awaited her reply.</p>
<p>'An argument of humanity!' was the scornful comment of Cosimo,
who saw clearly whither they were going.</p>
<p>But Samaritana was in perplexity 'Do I understand, sir, that
Venice will relinquish her claim upon Ravenna?'</p>
<p>The envoy's sigh seemed to rise from the very depths of his
corpulent being. 'I would it were possible. But Ravenna is the
crux. That is why I say, madonna, that the fate of Italy lies at
this moment in your hands. This southern outpost is imperatively
necessary to the security of Venice.'</p>
<p>'What you are asking, then,' she said slowly, 'is a voluntary
abdication on my part in favour of Venice; a surrender to Venice of
my heritage.'</p>
<p>The Serenissima will make the amplest compensation, madonna. I
am empowered to offer...'</p>
<p>'Compensation!' she interrupted him, and there was a glow of
anger in her dark eyes. 'Does the Serenissima perceive in life
nothing but trade and barter? What of my duty to the people whom I
was born to rule?'</p>
<p>'Yes. Answer that,' said Cosimo.</p>
<p>Grimani pursed his heavy lips. 'Duty,' he said slowly,
reflectively 'Duty Yes. Duty to a people implies love; the desire
best to serve their interests; to assure them, as far as may be
humanly possible, peace, so that they may be prosperous, secure,
and happy That, I take to be a sovereign's duty.'</p>
<p>'We agree so far.'</p>
<p>'Then let me make bold to ask, are you, is the House of Polenta,
in case to do this by the people of Ravenna?'</p>
<p>It was a simple question, yet a startling one. Samaritana looked
up at her cousin. Cosimo answered the look.</p>
<p>'A sophistry to serve Venetian greed.'</p>
<p>Grimani, impervious to insult, gravely shook his head. 'Oh, not
a sophistry. A fact. Venetian greed, if you choose so to describe
Venetian sentiments, may be anxious to urge this fact. But it does
not distort it. What has been the history of Ravenna independence
in the past? How many sieges has this city sustained? How many
times have its hapless citizens been given over to pillage and
rapine? How many times has the countryside been ravaged by enemy
troops?'</p>
<p>'Are you reminding me of Venetian atrocities?'</p>
<p>'These things have been suffered not only at the hands of
Venice, and they have been suffered because the rulers of Ravenna
have not had the necessary strength to intimidate attack. In what
case are you now to withstand it, madonna? Florence may come to
your aid. It is not impossible even that Florence may be able to
retain for you this patrimony But whilst your pride of sovereignty
may thus be gratified, what will have happened to your people? To
this people to whom you say that you have a duty? Will Florentine
intervention save this smiling countryside from becoming a cockpit,
from being ravaged and desolated?'</p>
<p>She was very white, tortured by the undeniable force of what he
said. Her long, slim hands were twisting one within the other.</p>
<p>'Am I, therefore, to subject my people to a foreign yoke? Is
that the inference I am to draw from this?'</p>
<p>'A foreign yoke! A yoke! The well-worn, specious word. The
inevitable pretence that people are galled by a foreign yoke and
not by a native one. To govern it is necessary to impose a yoke.
But has the yoke imposed by the Serenissima upon her subjects been
very hard to bear? Under it the people are secure and happy For it
is a yoke that gives them protection. Let the banner of Saint Mark
be hoisted over this citadel, and I dare to say that not in
generations will the people of Ravenna be disturbed again by war.
Are they happier under a Polenta rule, with the constant menace of
powerful neighbours hanging over them? If you love your people of
Ravenna, madonna, if the duty towards them which inspires you is a
duty to procure their good, you can find one only answer to my
question.'</p>
<p>She sank together where she sat. Her head was bowed in thought.
Grimani employed terrible arguments to which, let her wits search
as they would, she could find no answer such as she desired. It was
Cosimo who answered for her.</p>
<p>'Sir, you but give voice to the fears of Venice. If the
Serenissima had not suddenly become afraid of the task to which she
has set her hand, she would not send you with these specious
arguments. She would send her troops, recking little of this
desolation which you so much deplore.'</p>
<p>Grimani looked at him in sorrow. 'You are a priest, sir. An
argument of humanity should not move your scorn. Nor should it be
rashly regarded as a sign of fear. Venice fears nothing but the
things I have stated. Ravenna is necessary to her, and be sure that
Ravenna she will possess. But she desires to possess it without
carnage, the memory of which might dispose the people so ill
towards her that she would be constrained to rule them harshly
That, too, is something for your consideration, madonna. Your
abdication in favour of Venice would be accepted by your people,
thus doubly ensuring on the part of the Serenissima a benevolent
rule. As for our being afraid&mdash;to revert to that&mdash;it is
probable that, as Florence comes in on one side, others will come
in on the other. But if that does not happen, we can confront the
armies of Milan and Florence without fear. Already in the Cantons
we are raising fresh troops, to strengthen the powerful army on the
Brenta, which includes, in the Company of the Dove, the best and
most experienced soldiers in Italy today.'</p>
<p>Thus craftily, keeping what he supposed to be the
master-argument to the end, he brought the question round to
Colombino. She stiffened where she sat.</p>
<p>'The commander of that company is a prisoner in Venice,' she
said, and now her voice was strained.</p>
<p>'A hostage, merely A hostage for the good conduct of his troops.
We could not otherwise depend upon it. His captains might commit a
rashness. If it comes to war, that may yet happen, even so, though
I pray that it may riot. For I have a great regard&mdash;as who has
not?&mdash;for the Count of Ostiamare; and it would be a grievous
loss to Italy if he were cut off. But war is war, and as matters
stand, his survival is one of the risks of it.'</p>
<p>'And now you play upon my cousin's fears with that!' cried the
intransigent Cosimo. 'It is brave.'</p>
<p>'It is kind,' Grimani corrected. 'It is no more than fair to her
that she should perceive all the risks that will attend the failure
of my mission here.'</p>
<p>There was a spell of silence. She sat, her head bowed once more,
her soul in travail, her wits confused by the dreadful choice that
she was offered. The arguments with which Grimani had answered her
urgings of duty seemed to her overwhelming. If duty meant love,
then she would best serve a people, whom she saw herself without
the strength to protect, by abdicating to a power whose might would
safely shield them. But was she truthful with herself? Was this
readiness to believe the envoy's assertions being urged upon her by
her fears for the man who had placed himself in jeopardy on her
account? She made a little moaning, despairing sound, almost
without realizing it, and again appealed for assistance to her
cousin.</p>
<p>'How do we answer him, Cosimo? Perhaps you can see more clearly
than I. Tell me.'</p>
<p>'Since you can ask me...' he began, and checked there. 'It is
all specious, yes. It may even be true. But...' On a sudden thought
he looked at Grimani whose sleepy eyes were watching them with
veiled anxiety 'Can you even be sure that at this time of day, the
Lady Samaritana's abdication will cause Florence to draw back?'</p>
<p>'Ah, yes,' she cried, leaning forward in a fresh anxiety 'What
if it should not?'</p>
<p>Grimani rose, as if by standing he could increase
impressiveness.</p>
<p>'Whether it does or not, I can pledge the Serenissima that in
none of her interests shall the Lady Samaritana suffer.
Compensation shall be paid her as may be agreed, and she need not
doubt the Serenissima's munificence.'</p>
<p>'It is not of the compensations that I am thinking, sir. This
gentleman who out of loyalty to me has placed himself in
jeopardy?'</p>
<p>'Will be in jeopardy no longer, rest assured.'</p>
<p>'You pledge yourself to that? You swear it?' She, too, had
risen.</p>
<p>He bowed. 'I swear it. But not even so much is necessary. For by
your own voluntary abdication of the thing to defend which he sets
his engagement at defiance, you will have made an end of his need
to maintain that attitude.'</p>
<p>'That is not enough for me. I desire this clearly. Will the
Serenissima, if I agree, set the Count of Ostiamare at liberty? Let
me have it clearly, sir.'</p>
<p>'Clearly, then, you may depend upon it.' Having said this, he
waited with parted lips for her reply in an anxiety he no longer
troubled to dissemble.</p>
<p>She turned to Cosimo, who stood chin on breast, his brow
dark.</p>
<p>'Help me,' she begged him.</p>
<p>'I cannot,' he said. 'I am a priest, and I thank God for it. May
He pardon me if at moments I have tried to be a man of state. This
decision is for you alone. The only advice that I may perhaps offer
is that you take time for thought.'</p>
<p>'What thought can alter the situation?'</p>
<p>Cosimo shrugged, inclined his head and spread his hands. 'Though
your father might turn in his grave to hear me say it, your only
present choice is between love and pride.'</p>
<p>'I thank you, Cosimo.' The colour was creeping into her pallid
cheeks as she faced again the envoy.</p>
<p>'Here is my answer: On the day that you deliver the Count of
Ostiamare safely into my hands, you shall have the abdication of
all my rights in favour of the Most Serene Republic.'</p>
<p>Grimani bowed. 'That decision, madonna, does you more honour
than you may yet perceive.' His voice grew resonant with sincerity
'It is a decision for which your people of Ravenna will hereafter
come to bless your name. Yet before I can fully pledge the
Serenissima, before the Serenissima can release the Count, there
must be an end to the state of war.'</p>
<p>'How?' He had stricken the breath from her again.</p>
<p>'Do not be alarmed. It will follow. But I ask your suffrages. I
began by saying that it was upon your representations that Florence
was brought to take up arms, and that, therefore, upon your
representations she might be persuaded to lay them down. I ask that
you make, be it in person accompanied by me, be it through Messer
Cosimo, those representations.'</p>
<p>'Will Florence yield to them?'</p>
<p>'I do not make that a condition. I merely ask that you present
them. When you have done so, the Count of Ostiamare shall be
delivered to you safely in exchange for the parchments you have
promised me.'</p>
<p>'Whatever happens in Florence?'</p>
<p>'Whatever happens.'</p>
<h3>&mdash; vi &mdash;</h3>
<p>There was no rashness in Messer Grimani's promise, for there was
no flaw in that shrewd statesman's calculations. He knew that at
heart Florence no more desired a Milanese than a Venetian hegemony
in the North; that her considered policy would be to side with
neither, so that the balance of power should not be disturbed. Her
present intervention was the result of yielding to sentiment by the
Medici on behalf of the House of Polenta, and if upon sentimental
grounds again the Lady of Ravenna were to beg the Florentines to
withdraw a support which she no longer desired, Messer Grimani was
persuaded that the Magnificent Lorenzo would be not only willing
but relieved.</p>
<p>And as he reckoned, so it came to pass. More. When Grimani urged
on her behalf that the good of the people was the prime
consideration which had moved her to place Ravenna under the banner
of the winged lion, the great Lorenzo who, sincerely or otherwise,
was known to avow that the good of a people should be the supreme
law of a prince, placed upon her decision the benediction of his
approval.</p>
<p>The rest lay between Messer Grimani and the Medici and between
the Medici and the Signory of Florence; and the question of
Florentine alliance with Milan perished under the breath of the
shrewd Venetian.</p>
<p>When this had happened, the lady, who for two years had prayed
rather than hoped that one day Colombo da Siena would seek her in
Rayenna, could wait no longer for his coming. She would return to
Venice with Messer Grimani, and there, upon receiving the price she
had exacted, execute the deed that gave Ravenna to the Republic of
Saint Mark.</p>
<p>With no suspicion of the pattern being woven by other hands than
his own into the destiny of which he conceived himself the only
master, Messer Colombino languished in the Morosini Palace, a close
prisoner. He was courteously treated, it is true; but deprived of
weapons, constantly under the immediate guard of Messer Barnab,
who never stirred from his side and even slept in his chamber, with
a dozen Slavonian soldiers within hail. Escape was out of the
question. To a man in Colombino's position not merely the palace he
inhabited, but all Venice was a prison.</p>
<p>He sought to preserve his calm of spirit, whilst waiting and
wondering whether he would ever again be free to practise the art
by which he had climbed so high, merely perhaps to end like
Carmagnola, ignobly cropped in mid-career by a Venetian
headsman.</p>
<p>The black shadow of death lay constantly across his path in
those three weeks during which he was left without news of events
in the world beyond the lagoons.</p>
<p>The end was as abrupt as it was remote from anything that he
could have imagined.</p>
<p>One October morning a barge drew up at the steps of the Morosini
Palace, and from under its red canopy landed first Messer Grimani
and then Messer Cosimo da Polenta. Turning, these gentlemen handed
forth a tall, slim lady, richly cloaked. It was Messer Barnab who
ushered her into the room where the prisoner sat brooding.</p>
<p>Colombino, turning his head to see who came, sat staring a
moment before he could believe his eyes. Then, with a gasp, his
face white, he rose, and stood as if petrified.</p>
<p>It was the officer who spoke. 'I am happy to announce to you, my
lord, that your liberty is restored. His Serenity sends you word by
Messer Paolo Grimani that, whilst the hospitality of the Most
Serene Republic is yours for as long as you choose to honour it,
you are free to depart when you will. This lady is the bearer of
the order from the Council of Ten.'</p>
<p>He bowed, and discreetly left them.</p>
<p>Colombino continued to stare. Then he seemed to shake
himself.</p>
<p>'Faith, liberty were miracle enough for one morning. But
you...You are the Lady Samaritana, are you not? God knows I have so
often evoked your wraith, called forth your image to the eyes of my
soul, that I may well doubt if that does not explain this
portent.'</p>
<p>She rustled forward, moving with that grace he so well
remembered. She was trembling, weeping, and her lips quivered so
that he could not determine whether she laughed or cried. In one of
her long, slim hands she carried a parchment bearing a great red
seal. A medallion formed by an emerald set in brilliants glowed
against the black velvet on her breast.</p>
<p>He moved at last to meet her. She put out her hands. He took
them, almost timidly.</p>
<p>'You had need of me,' she said. 'That is why I am here. For two
years I have hoped that one day you might come to need me. It was
much to hope. But God has been good to me. I bring you
deliverance.' She held up the parchment.</p>
<p>He passed a hand across his brow, thrusting back the thick,
tawny hair.</p>
<p>'But how is it possible? How?'</p>
<p>'There is no longer to be war. Florence has withdrawn. And
Venice in strength has been able to reach an accord with Milan.'
But when in a few words she had told him how this had been
accomplished, he cried out in indignation.</p>
<p>'Mercy of Heaven! Now I understand. The cunning of these
Venetian foxes misses nothing. I was a hostage in their hands for
more than the submissiveness of my captains. I was to serve them so
that they might bend you to their will, even to the sacrifice of
your sovereignty of Ravenna. The infamy of that! And you? For
me...?'</p>
<p>'For you and for Ravenna,' she insisted. 'Though perhaps more
for you than for Ravenna. But we Polentas never could wield
sovereignty so as to protect our people. Under the shield of Saint
Mark they will be secure and at peace.'</p>
<p>'These, too, will be the arguments of Venice.'</p>
<p>'They are. But true none the less.'</p>
<p>'The real truth is that their sly, treacherous speciousness has
tricked you into signing away your patrimony.'</p>
<p>'Oh, no.' She looked into his face, and smiled tremulously
through tears. 'It was not their arts that prevailed with me. It
was my duty. My duty to you, Messer Colombo.'</p>
<p>'Madonna, you owed me no duty'</p>
<p>Did I not? Have I forgotten, do you suppose, the renunciation
that you made, and how you made it, reckless of the execration you
provoked? Could I suffer you now to sacrifice to me, as you were
doing, your liberty, perhaps your life?'</p>
<p>'There is no parallel...' he was beginning.</p>
<p>Her interruption was almost fierce. 'That is true. There is
none. Still, I have done the little that I could. I lay it at your
feet.'</p>
<p>'Samaritana! Oh, Samaritana!'</p>
<p>He looked at her so gravely, as if he asked a question with his
eyes. And her eyes answered him, it seems. For upon that he took
her in his arms, drew the black head against his shoulder, and
after a silent moment softly laughed. 'That this should come to
pass! And by the agency of these Venetian gentlemen. That this
lovely, lovely dream in which I am should be reality! When first I
sought you to wife, Samaritana, it was so that I might possess
Ravenna. For love of you I renounced it, and you have renounced it
now for love of me. It is very well.'</p>
