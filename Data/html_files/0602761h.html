<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>Chapter I&mdash;"The everlasting
stars look down, like glistening eyes bright with immortal pity,
over the lot of man"</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>Nearly five years have gone by!</p>

<p>Five years, since the charred ruins of grim Bastille&mdash;stone
image of Absolutism and of Autocracy&mdash;set the seal of victory
upon the expression of a people's will and marked the beginning of
that marvellous era of Liberty and of Fraternity which has led us
step by step from the dethronement of a King, through the
martyrdom of countless innocents, to the tyranny of an oligarchy
more arbitrary, more relentless, above all more cruel, than any
that the dictators of Rome or Stamboul ever dream of in their
wildest thirst for power. An era that sees a populace always
clamouring for the Millennium, which ranting demagogues have never
ceased to promise: a Millennium to be achieved alternatively
through the extermination of Aristocracy, of Titles, of Riches, and
the abrogation of Priesthood: through dethroned royalty and
desecrated altars, through an army without leadership, or an
Assembly without power.</p>

<p>They have never ceased to prate, these frothy rhetoricians! And
the people went on, vaguely believing that one day, soon, that
Millennium would surely come, after seas of blood had purged the
soil of France from the last vestige of bygone oppression, and
after her sons and daughters had been massacred in their thousands
and their tens of thousands, until their headless bodies had built
up a veritable scaling ladder for the tottering feet of lustful
climbers, and these in their turn had perished to make way for
other ranters, other speech-makers, a new Demosthenes or
long-tongued Cicero.</p>

<p>Inevitably these too perished, one by one, irrespective of their
virtues or their vices, their errors or their ideals: Vergniaud,
the enthusiast, and Desmoulins, the irresponsible; Barnave, the
just, and Chaumette, the blasphemer; Hébert, the carrion, and
Danton, the power. All, all have perished, one after the other:
victims of their greed and of their crimes&mdash;they and their
adherents and their enemies. They slew and were slain in their
turn. They struck blindly, like raging beasts, most of them for
fear lest they too should be struck by beasts more furious than
they. All have perished; but not before their iniquities have for
ever sullied what might have been the most glorious page in the
history of France&mdash;her fight for Liberty. Because of these
monsters&mdash;and of a truth there were only a few&mdash;the
fight, itself sublime in its ideals, noble in its conception, has
become abhorrent to the rest of mankind.</p>

<p>But they, arraigned at the bar of history, what have they to
say, what to show as evidence of their patriotism, of the purity of
their intentions?</p>

<p>On this day of April, 1794, year II of the New Calendar, eight
thousand men, women, and not a few children, are crowding the
prisons of Paris to overflowing. Four thousand heads have fallen
under the guillotine in the past three months. All the great names
of France, her noblesse, her magistracy, her clergy, members of
past Parliaments, shining lights in the sciences, the arts, the
Universities, men of substance, poets, brain-workers, have been
torn from their homes, their churches or their places of refuge,
dragged before a travesty of justice, judged, condemned and
slaughtered; not singly, not individually, but in
batches&mdash;whole families, complete hierarchies, entire
households: one lot for the crime of being right, another for being
nobly born; some because of their religion, others because of
professed free-thought. One man for devotion to his friend, another
for perfidy; one for having spoken, another for having held his
tongue, and another for no crime at all&mdash;just because of his
family connexions, his profession, or his ancestry.</p>

<p>For months it had been the innocents; but since then it has also
been the assassins. And the populace, still awaiting the
Millennium, clamour for more victims and for more&mdash;for the
aristocrat and for the sans-culotte, and howl with execration
impartially at both.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>But through this mad orgy of murder and of hatred, one man
survives, stands apart indeed, wielding a power which the whole
pack of infuriated wolves thirsting for his blood are too cowardly
to challenge. The Girondists and the Extremists have fallen.
Hébert, the idol of the mob, Danton its hero and its mouthpiece,
have been hurled from their throne, sent to the scaffold along with
ci-devant nobles, aristocrats, royalists and traitors. But this one
man remains, calm in the midst of every storm, absolute in his
will, indigent where others have grasped riches with both hands,
adored, almost deified, by a few, dreaded by all, sphinx-like,
invulnerable, sinister&mdash;Robespierre!</p>

<p>Robespierre at this time was at the height of his popularity and
of his power. The two great Committees of Public Safety and of
General Security were swayed by his desires, the Clubs worshipped
him, the Convention was packed with obedient slaves to his every
word. The Dantonists, cowed into submission by the bold coup which
had sent their leader, their hero, their idol, to the guillotine,
were like a tree that has been struck at the root. Without Danton,
the giant of the Revolution, the collossus of crime, the maker of
the Terror, the thunderbolt of the Convention, the part was
atrophied, robbed of its strength and its vitality, its last few
members hanging, servile and timorous, upon the great man's
lips.</p>

<p>Robespierre was in truth absolute master of France. The man who
had dared to drag his only rival down to the scaffold was beyond
the reach of any attack. By this final act of unparalleled
despotism he had revealed the secrets of his soul, shown himself to
be rapacious as well as self-seeking. Something of his aloofness,
of his incorruptibility, had vanished, yielding to that
ever-present and towering ambition which hitherto none had dared to
suspect. But ambition is the one vice to which the generality of
mankind will always accord homage, and Robespierre, by gaining the
victory over his one in the Convention, in the Clubs and in the
Committees, had tacitly agreed to obey. The tyrant out of his
vaulting ambition had brought forth the slaves.</p>

<p>Faint hearted and servile, they brooded over their wrongs, gazed
with smouldering wrath on Danton's vacant seat in the Convention,
which no one cared to fill. But they did not murmur, hardly dared
to plot, and gave assent to every decree, every measure, every
suggestion promulgated by the dictator who held their lives in the
hollow of his thin white hand; who with a word, a gesture, could
send his enemy, his detractor, a mere critic of his actions, to the
guillotine.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>Chapter II&mdash;Feet of Clay</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>On this 26th day of April, 1794, which in the newly constituted
calendar is the 7th Floreal, year II of the Republic, three women
and one man were assembled in a small, closely curtained room on
the top floor of a house in the Rue de la Planchette, which is
situated in a remote and dreary quarter of Paris. The man sat upon
a chair which was raised on a dais. He was neatly, indeed
immaculately, dressed, in dark cloth coat and tan breeches, with
clean linen at throats and wrists, white stockings and buckled
shoes. His own hair was concealed under a mouse-coloured wig. He
sat quite still, with one leg crossed over the other, and his thin,
bony hands were clasped in front of him.</p>

<p>Behind the dais there was a heavy curtain which stretched right
across the room, and in front of it, at opposite corners, two young
girls, clad in grey, clinging draperies, sat upon their heels, with
the palms of their hands resting flat upon their thighs. Their hair
hung loose down their backs, their chins were uplifted, their eyes
fixed, their bodies rigid in an attitude of contemplation. In the
centre of the room a woman stood, gazing upwards at the ceiling,
her arms folded across her breast. Her grey hair, lank and unruly,
was partially hidden by an ample floating veil of an indefinite
shade of grey, and from her meagre shoulders and arms, her
garment&mdash;it was hardly a gown&mdash;descended in straight,
heavy, shapeless folds. In front of her was a small table, on it a
large crystal globe, which rested on a stand of black wood,
exquisitely carved and inlaid with mother-of-pearl, and beside it a
small metal box.</p>

<p>Immediately above the old woman's head an oil lamp, the flame of
which was screened by a piece of crimson silk, shed a feeble and
lurid light upon the scene. Against the wall half a dozen chairs,
on the floor a threadbare carpet, and in one corner a broken-down
chiffonier represented the sum total of the furniture in the stuffy
little room. The curtains in front of the window, as well as the
portières which masked both the doors, were heavy and thick,
excluding all light and most of the outside air.</p>

<p>The old woman, with eyes fixed upon the ceiling, spoke in a
dull, even monotone.</p>

<p>"Citizen Robespierre, who is the Chosen of the Most High, hath
deigned to enter the humble abode of his servant," she said. "What
is his pleasure to-day?"</p>

<p>"The shade of Danton pursues me," Robespierre replied, and his
voice too sounded toneless, as if muffled by the heavily weighted
atmosphere. "Can you not lay him to rest?"</p>

<p>The woman stretched out her arms. The folds of her woollen
draperies hung straight from shoulder to wrist down to the ground,
so that she looked like a shapeless bodiless, grey ghost in the
dim, red light.</p>

<p>"Blood!" she exclaimed in a weird, cadaverous wail. "Blood
around thee and blood at thy feet! But not upon thy head, O Chosen
of the Almighty! Thy decrees are those of the Most High! Thy hand
wields His avenging Sword! I see thee walking upon a sea of blood,
yet thy feet are as white as lilies and thy garments are spotless
as the driven snow. Avaunt," she cried in sepulchral tones, "ye
spirits of evil! Avaunt, ye vampires and ghouls! and venture not
with your noxious breath to disturb the serenity of our Morning
Star!"</p>

<p>The girls in front of the dais raised their arms above their
heads and echoed the old soothsayer's wails.</p>

<p>"Avaunt!" they cried solemnly. "Avaunt!"</p>

<p>Now from a distant corner of the room, a small figure detached
itself out of the murky shadows. It was the figure of a young
negro, glad in white from head to foot. In the semi-darkness the
draperies which he wore were alone visible, and the whites of his
eyes. Thus he seemed to be walking without any feet, to have eyes
without any face, and to be carrying a heavy vessel without using
any hands. His appearance indeed was so startling and so unearthly
that the man upon the dais could not suppress an exclamation of
terror. Whereupon a wide row of dazzlingly white teeth showed
somewhere between the folds of the spectral draperies, and further
enhanced the spook-like appearance of the blackamoor. He carried a
deep bowl fashioned of chased copper, which he placed upon the
table in front of the old woman, immediately behind the crystal
globe and the small metal box. The seer then opened the box, took
out a pinch of something brown and powdery, and holding it between
finger and thumb, she said solemnly:</p>

<p>"From out the heart of France rises the incense of faith, of
hope, and of love!" and she dropped the powder into the bowl. "May
it prove acceptable to him who is her chosen Lord!"</p>

<p>A bluish flame shot up from out the depth of the vessel, shed
for the space of a second or two its ghostly light upon the gaunt
features of the old hag, the squat and grinning face of the negro,
and toyed with the will-o'-the-wisp-like fitfulness of the
surrounding gloom. A sweet-scented smoke rose upwards to the
ceiling. Then the flame died down again, making the crimson
darkness around appear by contrast more lurid and more mysterious
than before.</p>

<p>Robespierre had not moved. His boundless vanity, his insatiable
ambition, blinded him to the effrontery, the ridicule of this
mysticism. He accepted the tangible incense, took a deep breath, as
if to fill his entire being with its heady fumes, just as he was
always ready to accept the fulsome adulation of his devotees and of
his sycophants.</p>

<p>The old charlatan then repeated her incantations. Once more she
took powder from the box, threw some of it into the vessel, and
spoke in a sepulchral voice:</p>

<p>"From out of the heart of those who worship thee rises the
incense of their praise!"</p>

<p>A delicate white flame rose immediately out of the vessel. It
shed a momentary, unearthly brightness around, then as speedily
vanished again. And for the third time the witch spoke the mystic
words:</p>

<p>"From out the heart of an entire nation rises the incense of
perfect joy in thy triumph over thine enemies!"</p>

<p>This time, however, the magic powder did not act quite so
rapidly as it had done on the two previous occasions. For a few
seconds the vessel remained dark and unresponsive; nothing came to
dispel the surrounding gloom. Even the light of the oil lamp
overhead appeared suddenly to grow dim. At any rate, so it seemed
to the autocrat who, with nerves on edge, sat upon his throne-like
seat, his bony hands, so like the talons of a bird of prey,
clutching the arms of his chair, his narrow eyes fixed upon the
sybil, who in her turn was gazing on the metal vessel as if she
would extort some cabalistic mystery from its depth.</p>

<p>All at once a bright red flame shot out of the bowl. Everything
in the room became suffused with a crimson glow. The old witch
bending over her cauldron looked as if she were smeared with blood,
her eyes appeared bloodshot, her long hooked nose cast a huge black
shadow over her mouth, distorting the face into a hideous,
cadaverous grin. From her throat issued strange sounds like those
of an animal in the throes of pain.</p>

<p>"Red! Red!" she lamented, and gradually as the flame subsided
and finally flickered out altogether, her words became more
distinct. She raised the crystal globe and gazed fixedly into it.
"Always red," she went on slowly. "Thrice yesterday did I cas the
spell in the name of Our Chosen...thrice did the spirits cloak
their identity in a blood-red flame...red...always red...not only
blood...but danger...danger of death through that which is
red..."</p>

<p>Robespierre had risen from his seat, his thin lips were
murmuring hasty imprecations. The kneeling figurants looked scared,
and strange wailing sounds came from their mouths. The young
blackamoor alone looked self-possessed. He stood by, evidently
enjoying the scene, his white teeth gleaming in a huge, board
grin.</p>

<p>"A truce on riddles, Mother!" Robespierre exclaimed at last
impatiently, and descended hastily from the dais. He approached the
old necromancer, seized her by the arm, thrust his head in front of
hers in an endeavour to see something which apparently was revealed
to her in the crystal globe. "What is it you see in there?" he
queried harshly.</p>

<p>But she pushed him aside, gazed with rapt intentness into the
globe.</p>

<p>"Red!" she murmured. "Scarlet...aye, scarlet! And now it takes
shape...Scarlet...and it obscures the Chosen One...the shape
becomes more clear...the Chosen One appears more dim..."</p>

<p>Then she gave a piercing shriek.</p>

<p>"Beware!...beware!...that which is Scarlet is shaped like a
flower...five petals, I see them distinctly...and the Chosen One I
see no more..."</p>

<p>"Malediction!" the man exclaimed. "What foolery is this?"</p>

<p>"No foolery," the old charlatan resumed in a dull monotone.
"Thou didst consult the oracle, oh thou, who art the Chosen of the
people of France! and the oracle has spoken. Beware of a scarlet
flower! From that which is scarlet comes danger of death for
thee!"</p>

<p>Wherat Robespierre tried to laugh.</p>

<p>"Some one has filled thy head, Mother," he said in a voice which
he vainly tried to steady, "with tales of the mysterious Englishman
who goes by the name of the Scarlet Pimpernel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thy mortal enemy, O Messenger of the Most High!" the old
blasphemer broke in solemnly. "In far-off fog-bound England he hath
sworn thy death. Beware&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If that is the only danger which threatens me&mdash;" the other
began, striving to speak carelessly.</p>

<p>"The only one, and the greatest one," the hag went on
insistently. "Despise it not because it seems small and
remote."</p>

<p>"I do not despise it; neither do I magnify it. A gnat is a
nuisance, but not a danger."</p>

<p>"A gnat may wield a poisoned dart. The spirits have spoken. Heed
their warning, O Chosen of the People! Destroy the Englishman ere
he destroy thee!"</p>

<p>"Pardi!" Robespierre retorted, and despite the stuffiness of the
room he gave a shiver as if he felt cold. "Since thou dost commune
with the spirits, find out from them how I can accomplish
that."</p>

<p>The woman once more raised the crystal globe to the level of her
breast. With her elbows stretched out and her draperies falling
straight all around her, she gazed into it for a while in silence.
Then she began to murmur.</p>

<p>"I see the Scarlet Flower quite plainly...a small Scarlet
Flower...And I see the great Light which is like an aureole, the
Light of the Chosen One. It is of dazzling brightness&mdash;but
over the Scarlet Flower casts a Stygian shadow."</p>

<p>"Ask them," Robespierre broke in peremptorily, "ask thy spirits
how best I can overcome mine enemy."</p>

<p>"I see something," the witch went on in an even monotone, still
gazing into the crystal globe "white and rose and tender...is it a
woman...?"</p>

<p>"A woman?"</p>

<p>"She is tall, and she is beautiful...a stranger in the
land...with eyes dark as the night and tresses black as the raven's
wing...Yes, it is a woman...She stands between the Light and that
blood-red flower. She takes the flower in her hand...she fondles
it, raises it to her lips...Ah!" and the old seer gave a loud cry
of triumph. "She tosses it mangled and bleeding into the consuming
Light...And now it lies faded, torn, crushed, and the Light grows
in radiance and in brilliancy, and there is none now to dim its
pristine glory&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But the woman? Who is she?" the man broke in impatiently. "What
is her name?"</p>

<p>"The spirits speak no names," the seer replied. "Any woman would
gladly be thy handmaid, O Elect of France! The spirits have
spoken," she concluded solemnly. "Salvation will come to thee by
the hand of a woman."</p>

<p>"And mine enemy?" he insisted. "Which of us two is in danger of
death now&mdash;now that I am warned&mdash;which of us
two?&mdash;mine English enemy, or I?"</p>

<p>Nothing loth, the old hag was ready to continue her sortilege.
Robespierre hung breathless upon her lips. His whole personality
seemed transformed. He appeared eager, fearful, credulous&mdash;a
different man to the cold, calculating despot who sent thousands to
their death with his measured oratory, the mere power of his
presence. Indeed, history has sought in vain for the probably
motive which drove this cynical tyrant into consulting this
pitiable charlatan. That Catherine Théot had certain psychic powers
has never been gainsaid, and since the philosophers of the
eighteenth century had undermined the religious superstitions of
the Middle Ages, it was only to be expected that in the great
upheaval of this awful Revolution, men and women should turn to the
mystic and the supernatural as to a solace and respite from the
fathomless misery of their daily lives.</p>

<p>In this world of ours, the more stupendous the events, the more
abysmal the catastrophes, the more do men realize their own
impotence and the more eagerly do they look for the Hidden Hand
that is powerful enough to bring about such events and to hurl upon
them such devastating cataclysms. Indeed, never since the dawn of
history had so many theosophies, demonologies, occult arts,
spiritualism, exorcism of all sorts, flourished as they did now:
the Theists, the Rosicrucians, the Illuminat, Swedenborg, the Count
of Saint Germain, Weishaupt, and scores of others, avowed
charlatans or earnest believers, had their neophytes, their
devotees, and their cults.</p>

<p>Catherine Théot was one of many: for the nonce, one of the most
noteworthy in Paris. She believed herself to be endowed with the
gift of prophecy, and her fetish was Robespierre. In this at least
she was genuine. She believed him now to be a new Messiah, the
Elect of God. Nay! she loudly proclaimed him as such, and one of
her earliest neophytes, an ex-Carthusian monk named Gerle, who sat
in the Convention next to the great man, had whispered in the
latter's ear the insidious flattery which had gradually led his
footsteps to the witch's lair.</p>

<p>Whether his own vanity&mdash;which was without limit and
probably without parallel&mdash;caused him to believe in his own
heaven-sent mission, or whether he only desired to strengthen his
own popularity by endowing it with supernatural prestige, is a
matter of conjecture. Certain it is that he did lend himself to
Catherine Théot's cabalistic practices and that he allowed himself
to be flattered and worshipped by the numerous nepohytes who
flocked to this new temple of magic, either from mystical fervour or
merely to serve their own ends by fawning on the most dreaded man
in France.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>Catherine Théot had remained rigidly still, in rapt
contemplation. It seemed as if she pondered over the Chosen One's
last peremptory demand.</p>

<p>"Which of us two," he had queried, in a dry, hard voice, "is in
danger of death now&mdash;now that I am warned&mdash;mine English
enemy, or I?"</p>

<p>The next moment, as if moved by inspiration, she took another
pinch of powder out of the metal box. The nigger's bright black
eyes followed her every movement, as did the dictator's
half-contemptuous gaze. The girls had begun to intone a monotonous
chant. As the seer dropped the powder into the metal bowl, a highly
scented smoke shot upwards and the interior of the vessel was
suffused with a golden glow. The smoke rose in spirals. Its fumes
spread through the airless room, rendering the atmosphere
insufferably heavy.</p>

<p>The dictator of France felt a strange exultation running through
him, as with deep breaths he inhaled the potent fumes. It seemed to
him as if his body had suddenly become etherealized, as if he were
in truth the Chosen of the Most High as well as the idol of France.
Thus disembodied, he felt in himself boundless strength! the power
to rise triumphant over all his enemies, whoever they may be. There
was a mighty buzzing in his ears like the reverberation of
thousands of trumpets and drums ringing and beating in unison to
his exaltation and to his might. His eyes appeared to see the whole
of the people of France, clad in white robes, with ropes round
their necks, and bowing as slaves to the ground before him. He was
riding on a cloud. His throne was of gold. In his hand he had a
sceptre of flame, and beneath his feet lay, crushed and mangled, a
huge scarlet flower. The sybil's voice reached his ears as if
through a surpernal trumpet:</p>

<p>"Thus lie for ever crushed at the feet of the Chosen One, those
who have dared to defy his power!"</p>

<p>Greater and greater became his exultation. He felt himself
uplifted high, high above the clouds, until he could see the world
as a mere crystal ball at his feet. His head had touched the
portals of heaven; his eyes gazed upon his own majesty, which was
second only to that of God. An eternity went by. He was
immortal.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, through all the mystic music, the clarion sounds
and songs of praise, there came a sound, so strange and yet so
human, that the almighty dictator's wandering spirit was in an
instant hurled back to earth, brought down with a mighty jerk which
left him giddy, sick, with throat dry and burning eyes. He could
not stand on his feet, indeed would have fallen but that the negro
had hastily pulled a chair forward, into which he sank, swooning
with unaccountable horror.</p>

<p>And yet that sound had been harmless enough: just a peal of
laughter, merry and inane&mdash;nothing more. It came faintly
echoing from beyond the heavy portière. Yet it had unnerved the
most ruthless despot in France. He looked about him, scared and
mystified. Nothing had been changed since he had gone wandering
into Elysian fields. He was still in a stuffy, curtained room;
there was the dais on which he had sat; the two women still chanted
their weird lament; and there was the old necromancer in her
shapeless, colourless robe, coolly setting down the crystal globe
upon its carved stand. There was the blackamoor, grinning and
mischievous, the metal vessel, the oil lamp, the threadbare carpet.
What of all this had been a dream? The clouds and the trumpets, or
that peal of human laughter with the quaint, inane catch in it? No
one looked scared: the girls chanted, the old hag mumbled vague
directions to her black attendant, who tried to look solemn, since
he was paid to keep his impish mirth in check.</p>

<p>"What was that?" Robespierre murmured at last.</p>

<p>The old woman looked up.</p>

<p>"What was what, O Chosen One?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I heard a sound&mdash;" he mumbled. "A laugh...Is anyone else
in the room?"</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"People are waiting in the antechamber," she replied carelessly,
"until it is the pleasure of the Chosen One to go. As a rule they
wait patiently, and in silence. But one of them may have laughed."
Then, as he made no further comment but still stood there silent,
as if irresolute, she queried with a great show of deference: "What
is thy next pleasure, O thou who art beloved of the people of
France?"</p>

<p>"Nothing...nothing!" he murmured. "I'll go now."</p>

<p>She turned straight to him and made him elaborate obeisance,
waving her arms about her. The two girls struck the ground with
their foreheads. The Chosen One, in his innermost heart vaguely
conscious of ridicule, frowned impatiently.</p>

<p>"Do not," he said peremptorily, "let anyone know that I have
been here."</p>

<p>"Only those who idolize thee&mdash;" she began.</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;I know," he broke in more gently, for the fulsome
adulation soothed his exacerbated nerves. "But I have many
enemies...and thou too art watched with malevolent eyes...Let not
our enemies make capital of our intercourse."</p>

<p>"I swear to thee, O Mighty Lord, that thy servant obeys thy
behests in all things."</p>

<p>"That is well," he retorted drily. "But thy adepts are wont to
talk too much. I'll not have my name bandied about for the
glorification of thy necromancy."</p>

<p>"Thy name is sacred to thy servants," she insisted with
ponderous solemnity. "As sacred as is thy person. Thous art the
regenerator of the true faith, the Elect of the First Cause, the
high priest of a new religion. We are but thy servants, thy
handmaids, thy worshippers."</p>

<p>All this charlatanism was precious incense to the limitless
vanity of the despot. His impatience vanished, as did his momentary
terror. He became kind, urbane, condescending. At the last, the old
hag almost prostrated herself before him, and clasping her wrinkled
hands together, she said in tones of reverential entreaty:</p>

<p>"In the name of thyself, of France, of the entire world, I
adjure thee to lend ear to what the spirits have revealed this day.
Beware the danger that comes to thee from the scarlet flower. Set
thy almighty mind to compass its destruction. Do not disdain a
woman's help, since the spirits have proclaimed that through a
woman thou shalt be saved. Remember! Remember!" she adjured him
with ever-growing earnestness. "Once before, the world was saved
through a woman. A woman crushed the serpent beneath her foot. Let
a woman now crush that scarlet flower beneath hers. Remember!"</p>

<p>She actually kissed his feet; and he, blinded by self-conceit to
the folly of this fetishism and the ridicule of his own acceptance
of it, raised his hand above her head as if in the act of
pronouncing a benediction.</p>

<p>Then without another word he turned to go. The young negro
brought him his hat and cloak. The latter he wrapped closely round
his shoulders, his hat he pulled down well over his eyes. Thus
muffled and, he hoped, unrecognizable, he passed with a firm tread
out of the room.</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>For awhile the old witch waited, straining her ears to catch the
last sound of those retreating footsteps; then, with a curt word
and an impatient clapping of her hands, she dismissed her
attendants, the negro as well as her neophytes. These young women
at her word lost quickly enough their air of rapt mysticism, became
very human indeed, stretched out their limbs, yawned lustily, and
with none too graceful movements uncurled themselves and struggled
to their feet. Chattering and laughing like so many magpies let out
of a cage, they soon disappeared through the door in the rear.</p>

<p>Again the old woman waited silent and motionless until that
merry sound too gradually subsided. Then she went across the room
to the dais, and drew aside the curtain which hung behind it.</p>

<p>"Citizen Chauvelin!" she called peremptorily.</p>

<p>A small figure of a man stepped out from the gloom. He was
dressed in black, his hair, of a nondescript blonde shade and his
crumpled linen alone told light in the general sombreness of his
appearance.</p>

<p>"Well?" he retorted drily.</p>

<p>"Are you satisfied?" the old woman went on with eager
impatience. "You heard what I said?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I heard," he replied. "Think you he will act on it?"</p>

<p>"I am certain of it."</p>

<p>"But why not have named Theresia Cabarrus? Then, at least, I
would have been sure&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He might have recoiled at an actual name," the woman replied,
"suspected me of connivance. The Chosen of the people of France is
shrewd as well as distrustful. And I have my reputation to
consider. But, remember what I said: 'tall, dark, beautiful, a
stranger in this land!' So, if indeed you require the help of the
Spaniard&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Indeed I do!" he rejoined earnestly. And, as if speaking to his
own inward self, "Theresia Cabarrus is the only woman I know who
can really help me."</p>

<p>"But you cannot force her consent, citizen Chauvelin," the sybil
insisted.</p>

<p>The eyes of citizen Chauvelin lit up suddenly with a flash of
that old fire of long ago, when he was powerful enough to compel
the consent or the co-operation of any man, woman or child on whom
he had deigned to cast an appraising glance. But the flash was only
momentary. The next second he had once more resumed his
unobtrusive, even humbled, attitude.</p>

<p>"My friends, who are few," he said, with a quick sigh of
impatience; "and mine enemies, who are without number, will readily
share your conviction, Mother, that citizen Chauvelin can compel no
one to do his bidding these days. Least of all the affianced wife
of powerful Tallien."</p>

<p>"Well, then," the sybil argued, "how think you that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I only hope, Mother," Chauvelin broke in suavely, "that after
your séance to-day, citizen Robespierre himself will see to it that
Theresia Cabarrus gives me the help I need."</p>

<p>Catherine Théot shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she said drily, "the Cabarrus knows no law save that of
her caprice. And as Tallien's fiancée she is almost immune."</p>

<p>"Almost, but not quite! Tallien is powerful, but so was
Danton."</p>

<p>"But Tallien is prudent, which Danton was not."</p>

<p>"Tallien is also a coward; and easily led like a lamb, with a
halter. He came back from Bordeaux tied to the apron-strings of the
fair Spaniard. He should have spread fire and terror in the region;
but at her bidding he dispensed justice and even mercy instead. A
little more airing of his moderate views, a few more acts of
unpatriotic clemeney, and powerful Tallien himself may become
'suspect.'"</p>

<p>"And you think that, when he is," the old woman rejoined with
grim sarcasm, "you will hold his fair betrothed in the hollow of
your hand?"</p>

<p>"Certainly!" he assented, and with an acid smile fell to
contemplating his thin, talon-like palms. "Since Robespierre,
counselled by Mother Théot, will himself have placed her
there."</p>

<p>Whereupon Catherine Théot ceased to argue, since the other
appeared so sure of himself. Once more she shrugged her
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Well, then, if you are satisfied..." she said.</p>

<p>"I am. Quite," he replied, and at once plunged his hand in the
breast-pocket of his coat. He had caught the look of avarice and of
greed which had glittered in the old hag's eyes. From his pocket he
drew a bundle of notes, for which Catherine immediately stretched
out a grasping hand. But before giving her the money, he added a
stern warning.</p>

<p>"Silence, remember! And, above all, discretion!"</p>

<p>"You may rely on me, citizen," the sybil riposted quietly. "I am
not likely to blab."</p>

<p>He did not place the notes in her hand, but threw them down on
the table with a gesture of contempt, without deigning to count.
But Catherine Théot cared nothing for his contempt. She coolly
picked up the notes and hid them in the folds of her voluminous
draperies. Then as Chauvelin, without another word, had turned
unceremoniously to go, she placed a bony hand upon his arm.</p>

<p>"And I can rely on you, citizen," she insisted firmly, "that
when the Scarlet Pimpernel is duly captured..."</p>

<p>"There will be ten thousand livres for you," he broke in
impatiently, "if my scheme with Theresia Cabarrus is successful. I
never go back on my word."</p>

<p>"And I'll not go back on mine," she concluded drily. "We are
dependent on one another, citizen Chauvelin. You want to capture
the English spy, and I want ten thousand livres, so that I may
retire from active life and quietly cultivate a plot of cabbages
somewhere in the sunshine. So you may leave the matter to me, my
friend. I'll not allow the great Robespierre to rest till he has
compelled Theresia Cabarrus to do your bidding. Then you may use
her as you think best. That gang of English spies must be found,
and crushed. We cannot have the Chosen of the Most High threatened
by such vermin. Ten thousand livres, you say?" the sybil went on,
and once again, as in the presence of the dictator, a mystic
exultation appeared to possess her soul. Gone was the glitter of
avarice from her eyes; her wizened face seem transfigured, her
shrunken form to gain in stature. "Nay! I would serve you on my
knees and accord you worship, if you avert the scarlet danger that
hovers over the head of the Beloved of France!"</p>

<p>But Chauvelin was obviously in no mood to listen to the old
hag's jeremiads, and while with arms uplifted she once more worked
herself up to a hysterical burst of enthusiasm for the bloodthirsty
monster whom she worshipped, he shook himself free from her grasp
and finally slipped out of the room, without further wasting his
breath.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>Chapter III&mdash;The Fellowship of
Grief</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>In the antechamber of Catherine Théot's abode of mysteries some
two hours later, half a dozen persons were sitting. The room was
long, narrow and bare, its walls dank and colourless, and save for
the rough wooden benches on which these person sat, was void of any
furniture. The benches were ranged against the walls; the one
window at the end was shuttered as to exclude all daylight, and
from the ceiling there hung a broken-down wrought-iron chandelier,
wherein a couple of lighted tallow candles were set, the smoke from
which rose in irregular spirals upwards to the low and blackened
ceiling.</p>

<p>These persons who sat or sprawled upon the benches did not speak
to one another. They appeared to be waiting. One or two of them
were seemingly asleep; others, from time to time, would rouse
themselves from their apathy, look with dim, inquiring eyes in the
direction of a heavy portière. When this subsided again all those
in the bare waiting-room resumed their patient, lethargic attitude,
and a silence&mdash;weird and absolute&mdash;reigned once more over
them all. Now and then somebody would sigh, and at one time one of
the sleepers snored.</p>

<p>Far away a church clock struck six.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, the portière was lifted, and a girl came
into the room. She held a shawl, very much the worse for wear,
tightly wrapped around her meagre shoulders, and from beneath her
rough woollen skirt her small feet appeared clad in well-worn shoes
and darned worsted stockings. Her hair, which was fair and soft,
was partially hidden under a white muslin cap, and as she walked
with a brisk step across the room, she looked neither to right nor
left, appeared to move as in a dream. And her large grey eyes were
brimming over with tears.</p>

<p>Neither her rapid passage across the room nor her exit through a
door immediately opposite the window created the slightest stir
amongst those who were waiting. Only one of the men, a huge
ungainly giant, whose long limbs appeared to stretch half-across
the bare wooden floor, looked up lazily as she passed.</p>

<p>After the girl had gone, silence once more fell on the small
assembly. Not a sound came from behind the portière; but from
beyond the other door the faint patter of the girl's feet could be
heard gradually fading away as she went slowly down the stone
stairs.</p>

<p>A few more minutes went by, then the door behind the portière
was opened and a cadaverous voice spoke the word, "Enter!"</p>

<p>There was a faint stir among those who waited. A woman rose from
her seat, said dully: "My turn, I think?" and, gliding across the
room like some bodiless spectre, she presently vanished behind the
portière.</p>

<p>"Are you going to the Fraternal Supper to-night, citizen
Langlois?" the giant said, after the woman had gone. His tone was
rasping and harsh and his voice came with a wheeze and an obviously
painful effort from his broad, doubled-up chest.</p>

<p>"Not I!" Langlois replied. "I must speak with Mother Théot. My
wife made me promise. She is too ill to come herself, and the poor
unfortunate believes in the Théot's incantations."</p>

<p>"Come out and get some fresh air, then," the other rejoined. "It
is stifling in here!"</p>

<p>It was indeed stuffy in the dark, smoke-laden room. The man put
his bony hand up to his chest, as if to quell a spasm of pain. A
horrible, rasping cough shook his big body and brought a sweat to
his brow. Langlois, a wizened little figure of a man, who looked
himself as if he had one foot in the grave, waited patiently until
the spasm was over, then, with the indifference peculiar to these
turbulent times, he said lightly:</p>

<p>"I would just as soon sit here as wear out shoe-leather on the
cobblestones of this God-forsaken hole. And I don't want to miss my
turn with mother Théot."</p>

<p>"You'll have another four hours mayhap to wait in this filthy
atmosphere."</p>

<p>"What an aristo you are, citizen Rateau!" the other retorted
drily. "Always talking about the atmosphere!"</p>

<p>"So would you, if you had only one lung wherewith to inhale this
filth," growled the giant through a wheeze.</p>

<p>"Then don't wait for me, my friend," Langlois concluded with a
careless shrug of his narrow shoulders. "And, if you don't mind
missing your turn..."</p>

<p>"I do not," was Rateau's curt reply. "I would as soon be last as
not. But I'll come back presently. I am the third from now. If I'm
not back you can have my turn, and I'll follow you in. But I
can't&mdash;"</p>

<p>His next words were smothered in a terrible fit of coughing, as
he struggled to his feet. Langlois swore at him for making such a
noise, and the women, roused from their somnolence, sigh with
impatience or resignation. But all those who remained seated on the
benches watched with a kind of dull curiosity the ungainly figure
of the asthmatic giant as he made his way across the room and anon
went out through the door.</p>

<p>His heavy footsteps were heard descending the stone stairs with
a shuffling sound, and the clatter of his wooden shoes. The women
once more settled themselves against the dank walls, with feet
stretched out before them and arms folded over their breasts, and
in that highly uncomfortable position prepared once more to go to
sleep.</p>

<p>Langlois buried his hands in the pockets of his breeches, spat
contentedly upon the floor, and continued to wait.</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the girl who, with tear-filled eyes, had come
out of the inner mysterious room in Mother Théot's apartments, had,
after a slow descent down the interminable stone stairs, at last
reached the open air.</p>

<p>The Rue de la Planchette is only a street in name, for the
houses in it are few and far between. One side of it is taken up
for the major portion of its length by the dry moat which at this
point forms the boundary of the Arsenal and of the military ground
around the Bastille. The house wherein lodged Mother Théot is one
of a small group situated behind the Bastille, the grim ruins of
which can be distinctly seen from the upper windows. Immediately
facing those houses is the Porte St. Antoine, through which the
wayfarer in this remote quarter of Paris has to pass in order to
reach the more populous parts of the city. This is just a lonely
and squalid backwater, broken up by undeveloped land and timber
yards. One end of the street abuts on the river, the other becomes
merged in the equally remote suburb of Popincourt.</p>

<p>But, for the girl who had just come out of the heavy, fetid
atmosphere of Mother Théot's lodgings, the air which reached her
nostrils as she came out of the wicket-gate, was positive manna to
her lungs. She stood for awhile quite still, drinking in the balmy
spring air, almost dizzy with the sensation of purity and of
freedom which came to her from over the vast stretch of open ground
occupied by the Arsenal. For a minute or two she stood there, then
walked deliberately in the direction of the Porte St. Antoine.</p>

<p>She was very tired, for she had come to the Rue de la Planchette
on foot all the way from the small apartment in the St. Germain
quarter, where she lodged with her mother and sister and a young
brother; she had become weary and jaded by sitting for hours on a
hard wooden bench, waiting her turn to speak with Mother Théot, and
then standing for what seemed an eternity of time in the presence
of the soothsayer, who had further harassed her nerves by weird
prophecies and mystic incantations.</p>

<p>But for the nonce weariness was forgotten. Régine de Serval was
going to meet the man she loved, at a trysting-place which they had
marked as their own: the porch of the church of Petit St. Antoine,
a secluded spot where neither prying eyes could see them nor ears
listen to what they had to say. A spot which to poor little Régine
was the very threshold of Paradise, for here she had Bertrand all
to herself, undisturbed by the prattle of Joséphine or Jacques or
the querulous complaints of maman, cooped up in that miserable
apartment in the old St. Germain quarter of the city.</p>

<p>So she walked briskly and without hesitation. Bertrand had
agreed to meet her at five o'clock. It was now close on half-past
six. It was still daylight, and a brilliant April sunset tinged the
cupola of Ste. Marie with gold and drew long fantastic shadows
across the wide Rue St. Antoine.</p>

<p>Régine had crossed the Rue des Balais, and the church porch of
Petit St. Antoine was just a few paces farther on, when she became
conscious of heavy, dragging footsteps some little way behind her.
Immediately afterwards, the distressing sound of a racking cough
reached her ears, followed by heartrending groans as of a human
creature in grievous bodily pain. The girl, not in the least
frightened, instinctively turned to look, and was moved to pity on
seeing a man leaning against the wall of a house, in a state
bordering on collapse, his hands convulsively grasping his chest,
which appeared literally torn by a violent fit of coughing.
Forgetting her own troubles, as well as the joy which awaited her
so close at hand, Régine unhesitatingly recrossed the road,
approached the sufferer, and in a gentle voice asked him if she
could be of any assistance to him in his distress.</p>

<p>"A little water," he gasped, "for mercy's sake!"</p>

<p>Just for a second or two she looked about her, doubtful as to
what to do, hoping perhaps to catch sight of Bertrand, if he had
not given up all hope of meeting her. The next, she had stepped
boldly through the wicket-gate of the nearest porte-cochère, and
finding her way to the lodge of the concierge, she asked for a drop
of water for a passer-by who was in pain. A jug of water was at
once handed to her by a sympathetic concierge, and with it she went
back to complete her simple act of mercy.</p>

<p>For a moment she was puzzled, not seeing the poor vagabond
there, where she had left him half-swooning against the wall. But
soon she spied him, in the very act of turning under the little
church porch of Petit St. Antoine, the hallowed spot of her
frequent meetings with Bertrand.</p>

<p class="cpb">4.</p>

<p>He seemed to have crawled there for shelter, and there he
collapsed upon the wooden bench, in the most remote angle of the
porch. Of Bertrand there was not a sign.</p>

<p>Régine was soon by the side of the unfortunate. She held up the
jug of water to his quaking lips, and he drank eagerly. After that
he felt better, muttered vague words of thanks. But he seemed so
weak, despite his stature, which appeared immense in this narrow
enclosure, that she did not like to leave him. She sat down beside
him, suddenly conscious of fatigue. He seemed harmless enough, and
after awhile began to tell her of his trouble. This awful asthma,
which he had contracted in the campaign against the English in
Holland, where he and his comrades had to march in snow and ice,
often shoeless and with nothing but bass mats around their
shoulders. He had but lately been discharged out of the army as
totally unfit, and he had no money wherewith to pay a doctor, he
would no doubt have been dead by now but that a comrade had spoken
to him of Mother Théot, a marvellous sorceress, who knew the art of
drugs and simples, and could cure all ailments of the body by the
mere laying on of hands.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," the girl sighed involuntarily, "of the body!"</p>

<p>Through the very act of sitting still, a deadly lassitude had
crept into her limbs. She was thankful not to move, to say little,
and to listen with half an ear to the vagabond's jeremiads. Anyhow,
she was sure that Bertrand would no longer be waiting. He was ever
impatient if he thought that she failed him in anything, and it was
she who had appointed five o'clock for their meeting. Even now the
church clock way above the porch was striking half-past six. And
the asthmatic giant went glibly on. He had partially recovered his
breath.</p>

<p>"Aye!" he was saying, in response to her lament, "and of the
mind, too. I had a comrade whose sweetheart was false to him while
he was fighting for his country. Mother Théot gave him a potion
which he administered to the faithless one, and she returned to him
as full of ardour as ever before."</p>

<p>"I have no faith in potions," the girl said, and shook her head
sadly the while tears once more gathered in her eyes.</p>

<p>"No more have I," the giant assented carelessly. "But if my
sweetheart was false to me I know what I would do."</p>

<p>This he said in so droll a fashion, and the whole idea of this
ugly, ungainly creature having a sweetheart was so comical, that
despite her will, the ghost of a smile crept round the young girl's
sensitive mouth.</p>

<p>"What would you do, citizen?" she queried gently.</p>

<p>"Just take her away, out of the reach of temptation," he replied
sententiously. "I should say, 'This must stop,' and 'You come away
with me, ma mie!'"</p>

<p>"Ah!" she retorted impulsively, "it is easy to talk. A man can
do so much. What can a woman do?"</p>

<p>She checked herself abruptly, ashamed of having said so much.
What was this miserable caitiff to her that she should as much as
hint her troubles in his hearing? In these days of countless spies,
of innumerable confidence tricks set to catch the unwary, it was
more than foolhardy to speak of one's private affairs to any
stranger, let alone to an out-at-elbows vagabond who was just the
sort of refuse of humanity who would earn a precarious livelihood
by the sale of information, true or false, wormed out of some
innocent fellow-creature. Hardly, then, were the words out of her
mouth than the girl repented of her folly, turned quick, frightened
eyes on the abject creature beside her.</p>

<p>But he appeared not to have heard. A wheezy cough came out of
his bony chest. Nor did he meet her terrified gaze.</p>

<p>"What did you say, citoyenne?" he muttered fretfully. "Are you
dreaming?...or what?..."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes!" she murmured vaguely, her heart still beating
with that sudden fright. "I must have been dreaming...But you...you
are better&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Better? Perhaps," he replied, with a hoarse laugh. "I might
even be able to crawl home."</p>

<p>"Do you live very far?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No. Just by the Rue de l'Anier."</p>

<p>He made no attempt to thank her for her gentle ministration, and
she thought of how ungainly he looked&mdash;almost
repellent&mdash;sprawling right across the porch, with his long
legs stretched out before him and his hands buried in the pockets
of his breeches. Nevertheless, he looked so helpless and so
pitiable that the girl's kind heart was again stirred with
compassion, and when presently he struggled with difficulty to his
feet, she said impulsively:</p>

<p>"The Rue de l'Anier is on my way. If you will wait, I'll return
the jug to the kind concierge who let me have it and I'll walk with
you. You really ought not to be about the street alone."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am better now," he muttered, in the same ungracious way.
"You had best leave me alone. I am not a suitable gallant for a
pretty wench like you."</p>

<p>But already the girl had tripped away with the jug, and returned
two minutes later to find that the curious creature had already
started on his way and was fifty yards or more farther up the
street by now. She shrugged her shoulders, feeling mortified at his
ingratitude, and not a little ashamed that she had forced her
compassion where it was so obviously unwelcome.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>Chapter IV&mdash;One Dram of Joy
must have a Pound of Care</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>She stood for a moment, gazing mechanically on the retreating
figure of the asthmatic giant. The next moment she heard her name
spoken, and turned quickly with a little cry of joy.</p>

<p>"Régine!"</p>

<p>A young man was hurrying towards her, was soon by her side and
took her hand.</p>

<p>"I have been waiting," he said reproachfully, "for more than an
hour."</p>

<p>In the twilight his face appeared pinched and pale, with dark,
deep-sunken eyes that told of a troubled soul and a consuming,
inward fire. He wore cloth clothes that were very much the worse
for wear, and boots that were down at heel. A battered tricorne hat
was pushed back from his high forehead, exposing the veined temples
with the line of brown hair, and the arched, intellectual brows
that proclaimed the enthusiast rather than the man of action.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, Bertrand," the girl said simply. "But I had to wait
such a long time at Mother Théot's, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what were you doing now?" he queried with an impatient
frown. "I saw you from a distance. You came out of yonder house,
and then stood here like one bewildered. You did not hear when
first I called."</p>

<p>"I have had quite a funny adventure," Régine explained; "and I
am very tired. Sit down with me, Bertrand, for a moment. I'll tell
you all about it."</p>

<p>A flat refusal hovered palpably on his lips.</p>

<p>"It is too late&mdash;" he began, and the frown of impatience
deepened upon his brow. He tried to protest, but Régine did look
very tired. Already, without waiting for his consent, she had
turned into the little porch, and Bertrand perforce had to follow
her.</p>

<p>The shades of evening now were fast gathering in, and the
lengthened shadows stretched out away, right across the street. The
last rays of the sinking sun still tinged the roofs and chimney
pots opposite with a crimson hue. But here, in the hallowed little
trysting-place, the kingdom of night had already established its
sway. The darkness lent an air of solitude and of security to this
tiny refuge, and Régine drew a happy little sigh as she walked
deliberately to its farthermost recess and sat down on the wooden
bench in it's extreme and darkest angle.</p>

<p>Behind her, the heavy oaken door of the church was closed. The
church itself, owning to the contumaciousness of its parish priest,
had been desecrated by the ruthless hands of the Terrorists and
left derelict, to fall into decay. The stone walls themselves
appeared cut off from the world, as if ostracized. But between them
Régine felt safe, and when Bertrand Moncrif somewhat reluctantly
sat down beside her, she also felt almost happy.</p>

<p>"It is very late," he murmured once more, ungraciously.</p>

<p>She was leaning her head against the wall, looked so pale, with
eyes closed and bloodless lips, that the young man's heart was
suddenly filled with compunction.</p>

<p>"You are not ill, Régine?" he asked, more gently.</p>

<p>"No," she replied, and smiled bravely up at him. "Only very
tired and a little dizzy. The atmosphere in Catherine Théot's rooms
was stifling, and then when I came out&mdash;"</p>

<p>He took her hand, obviously making an effort to be patient and
to be kind; and she, not noticing the effort or his absorption,
began to tell him about her little adventure with the asthmatic
giant.</p>

<p>"Such a droll creature," she explained. "He would have
frightened me but for that awful, churchyard cough."</p>

<p>But the matter did not seem to interest Bertrand very much; and
presently he took advantage of a pause in her narrative to ask
abruptly:</p>

<p>"And Mother Théot, what had she to say?"</p>

<p>Régine gave a shudder.</p>

<p>"She foretells danger for us all," she said.</p>

<p>"The old charlatan!" he retorted with a shrug of the shoulders.
"As if every one was not in danger these days!"</p>

<p>"She gave me a powder," Régine went on simply, "which she thinks
will calm Joséphine's nerves."</p>

<p>"And that is folly," he broke in harshly. "We do not want
Joséphine's nerves to be calmed."</p>

<p>But at his words, which in truth sounded almost cruel, Régine
roused herself with a sudden air of authority.</p>

<p>"Bertrand," she said firmly, "you are doing a great wrong by
dragging the child into your schemes. Joséphine is too young to be
used as a tool by a pack of thoughtless enthusiasts."</p>

<p>A bitter, scornful laugh from Bertrand broke in on her
vehemence.</p>

<p>"Thoughtless enthusiasts!" he exclaimed roughly. "Is that how
you call us, Régine? My God! where is your loyalty, your devotion?
Have you no faith, no aspirations? Do you no longer worship God or
reverence your King?"</p>

<p>"In heaven's name, Bertrand, take care!" she whispered hoarsely,
looked about her as if the stone walls of the porch had ears and
eyes fixed upon the man she loved.</p>

<p>"Take care!" he rejoined bitterly. "Yes! that is your creed now.
Caution! Circumspection! You fear&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For you," she broke in reproachfully; "for Joséphine; for
maman; for Jacques&mdash;not for myself, God knows!"</p>

<p>"We must all take risks, Régine," he retorted more composedly.
"We must all risk our miserable lives in order to end this awful,
revolting tyranny. We must have a wider outlook, think not only of
ourselves, of those immediately round us, but of France, of
humanity, of the entire world. The despotism of a bloodthirsty
autocrat has made of the people of France a people of slaves,
cringing, fearful, abject&mdash;swayed by his word, too cowardly
now to rebel."</p>

<p>"And what are you? My God!" she cried passionately. "You and
your friends, my poor young sister, my foolish little brother? What
are you, that you think you can stem the torrent of this stupendous
Revolution? How think you that your feeble voices will be heard
above the roar of a whole nation in the throes of misery and of
shame?"</p>

<p>"It is the still small voice," Bertrand replied, in the tone of
a visionary, who sees mysteries and who dreams dreams, "that is
heard by its persistence even above the fury of thousands in full
cry. Do we not call our organization 'the Fatalists'? Our aim is to
take every opportunity by quick, short speeches, by mixing with the
crowd and putting in a word here and there, to make propaganda
against the fiend Robespierre. The populace are like sheep; they'll
follow a lead. One day, one of us&mdash;it may be the humblest, the
weakest, the youngest; it may be Joséphine or Jacques; I pray God
it may be me&mdash;but one of us will find the word and speak it at
the right time, and the people will follow us and turn against that
execrable monster and hurl him from his throne, down into
Gehenna."</p>

<p>He spoke below his breath, in a hoarse whisper which even she
had to strain her ears to hear.</p>

<p>"I know, I know, Bertrand," she rejoined, and her tiny hand
stole out in a pathetic endeavour to capture his. "Your aims are
splendid. You are wonderful, all of you. Who am I, that I should
even with a word or a prayer, try to dissuade you to do what you
think is right? But Joséphine is so young, so hot-headed! What help
can she give you? She is only seventeen. And Jacques! He is just an
irresponsible boy! Think, Bertrand, think! If anything were to
happen to these children, it would kill maman!"</p>

<p>He gave a shrug of the shoulders and smothered a weary sigh. She
had succeeded in capturing his hand, clung to it with the strength
of a passionate appeal.</p>

<p>"You and I will never understand one another, Régine," he began;
then added quickly, "over these matters," because, following on his
cruel words, he had heard the tiny cry of pain, so like that of a
wounded bird, which much against her will had escaped her lips.
"You do not understand," he went on, more quietly, "that in a great
cause the sufferings of individuals are nought beside the glorious
achievement that is in view."</p>

<p>"The sufferings of individuals," she murmured, with a pathetic
little sigh. "In truth 'tis but little heed you pay, Bertrand, to
my sufferings these days." She paused awhile, then added under her
breath: "Since first you met Theresia Cabarrus, three months ago,
you have eyes and ears only for her."</p>

<p>He smothered an angry exclamation.</p>

<p>"It is useless, Régine&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"I know," she broke in quietly. "Theresia Cabarrus is beautiful;
she has charm, wit, power&mdash;all things which I do not
possess."</p>

<p>"She has fearlessness and a heart of gold," Bertrand rejoined
and, probably despite himself, a sudden warmth crept into his
voice. "Do you not know of the marvellous influence which she
exercised over that fiend Tallien, down in Bordeaux? He went there
filled with a veritable tiger's fury, ready for a wholesale
butchery of all the royalists, the aristocrats, the bourgeois, over
there&mdash;all those, in fact, whom he chose to believe were
conspiring against this hideous Revolution. Well! under Theresia's
influence he actually modified his views and became so lenient that
he was recalled. You know, or should know, Régine," the young man
added in a tone of bitter reproach, "that Theresia is as good as
she is beautiful."</p>

<p>"I do know that, Bertrand," the girl rejoined with an effort.
"Only&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only what?" he queried roughly.</p>

<p>"I do not trust her...that is all." Then, as he made no attempt
at concealing his scorn and his impatience, she went on in a tone
which was much harsher, more uncompromising than the one she had
adopted hitherto: "your infatuation blinds you, Bertrand, or
you&mdash;an enthusiastic royalist, an ardent loyalist&mdash;would
not place your trust in an avowed Republican. Theresia Cabarrus may
be kind-hearted&mdash;I don't deny it. She may have done and she
may be all that you say; but she stands for the negation of every
one of your ideals, for the destruction of what you exalt, the
glorification of the principles of this execrable Revolution."</p>

<p>"Jealousy blinds you, Régine," he retorted moodily.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"No, it is not jealousy, Bertrand&mdash;not common, vulgar
jealousy&mdash;that prompts me to warn you, before it is too late.
Remember," she added solemnly, "that you have not only yourself to
think of, but that you are accountable to God and to me for the
innocent lives of Joséphine and of Jacques. By confiding in that
Spanish woman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now you are insulting her," he broke in mercilessly. "Making
her out to be a spy."</p>

<p>"What else is she?" the girl riposted vehemently. "You know that
she is affianced to Tallien, whose influence and whose cruelty are
second only to those of Robespierre. You know it, Bertrand!" she
insisted, seeing that at last she had silenced him and that he sat
beside her, sullen and obstinate. "You know it, even though you
choose to close your eyes and ears to what is common
knowledge."</p>

<p>There was silence after that for a while in the narrow porch,
where two hearts once united were filled now with bitterness, one
against the other. Even out in the street it had become quite dark,
the darkness of a spring night, full of mysterious lights and grey,
indeterminate shadows. The girl shivered as with cold and drew her
tattered shawl more closely round her shoulders. She was vainly
trying to swallow her tears. Goaded into saying more than she had
ever meant to, she felt the finality of what she had said.
Something had finally snapped just now: something that could never
in after years be put together again. The boy and girl love which
had survived the past two years of trouble and of stress, lay
wounded unto death, bleeding at the foot of the shrine of a man's
infatuation and a woman's vanity. How impossible this would have
seemed but a brief while ago!</p>

<p>Through the darkness, swift visions of past happy times came
fleeting before the girl's tear-dimmed gaze: visions of walks in
the woods round Auteuil, of drifting down-stream in a boat on the
Seine on hot August days&mdash;aye! even of danger shared and
perilous moments passed together, hand in hand, with bated breath,
in darkened rooms, with curtains drawn and ears straining to hear
the distant cannonade, the shouts of an infuriated populace or the
rattle of death carts upon the cobblestones. Swift visions of past
sorrows and past joys! An immense self-pity filled the girl's heart
to bursting. An insistent sob that would not be suppressed rose to
her throat.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mother of God, have mercy!" she murmured through her
tears.</p>

<p>Bertrand, shamed and confused, his heart stirred by the misery
of this girl whom he had so dearly loved, his nerves strained
beyond endurance through the many mad schemes which his enthusiasm
was for ever evolving, felt like a creature on the rack, torn
between compunction and remorse on the one hand and irresistible
passion on the other.</p>

<p>"Régine," he pleaded, "forgive me! I am a brute, I know&mdash;a
brute to you, who have been the kindest little friend a man could
possibly hope for. Oh, my dear," he added pitiably, "if you would
only understand..."</p>

<p>At once her tender, womanly sentiment was to the fore, sweeping
pride and just resentment out of the way. Hers was one of those
motherly natures that are always more ready to comfort than to
chide. Already she had swallowed her tears, and now that with a
wearied gesture he had buried his face in his hands, she put her
arm around his neck, pillowed his head against her breast.</p>

<p>"I do understand, Bertrand," she said gently. "And you must
never ask my forgiveness, for you and I have loved one another too
well to bear anger or grudge one toward the other. There!" she
said, and rose to her feet, and seemed by that sudden act to gather
up all the moral strength of which she stood in such sore need. "It
is getting late, and maman will be anxious. Another time we must
have a more quiet talk about our future. But," she added, with
renewed seriousness, "if I concede you Theresia Cabarrus without
another murmur, you must give me back Joséphine and Jacques.
If&mdash;if I&mdash;am to lose you&mdash;I could not bear to lose
them as well. They are so young..."</p>

<p>"Who talks of losing them?" he broke in, once more impatient,
enthusiastic&mdash;his moodiness gone, his remorse smothered, his
conscience dead to all save to his schemes. "And what have I to do
with it all? Joséphine and Jacques are members of the Club. They
may be young, but they are old enough to know the value of an oath.
They are pledged just like I am, just like we all are. I could not,
even if I would, make them false to their oath." Then, as she made
no reply, he leaned over to her, took her hands in his, tried to
read her inscrutable face through the shadows of night. He thought
that he read obstinacy in her rigid attitude, the unresponsive
placidity of her hands. "You would not have them false to their
oath?" he insisted.</p>

<p>She made no reply to that, only queried dully:</p>

<p>"What are you going to do to-night?"</p>

<p>"To-night," he said with passionate earnestness, his eyes
glowing with the fervid adour of self-immolation, "we are going to
let hell loose around the name of Robespierre."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"At the open-air supper in the Rue St. Honoré. Joséphine and
Jacques will be there."</p>

<p>She nodded mechanically, quietly disengaged her hands from his
feverish grasp.</p>

<p>"I know," she said quietly. "They told me they were going. I
have no influence to stop them."</p>

<p>"You will be there, too?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Of course. So will poor maman," she replied simply.</p>

<p>"This may be the turning point, Régine," he said with passionate
earnestness, "in the history of France!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps!"</p>

<p>"Think if it, Régine! Think of it! Your sister, your young
brother! Their name may go down to posterity as the saviours of
France!"</p>

<p>"The saviours of France!" she murmured vaguely.</p>

<p>"One word has swayed a multitude before now. It may do so
again...to-night!"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "And those poor children believe in the power
of their oratory."</p>

<p>"Do not you?"</p>

<p>"I only remember that you, Bertrand, have probably spoken of
your plan to Theresia Cabarrus, that the place will be swarming
with the spies of Robespierre, and that you and the children will
be recognized, seized, dragged into prison, then to the guillotine!
My God!" she added, in a pitiful murmur. "And I am powerless to do
anything but look on like an insentient log, whilst you run your
rash heads into a noose, and then follow you all to death, whilst
maman is left alone to perish in misery and in want."</p>

<p>"A pessimist again, Régine!" he said with a forced laugh, and in
his turn rose to his feet. "'Tis little we have accomplished this
evening," he added bitterly, "by talking."</p>

<p>She said nothing more. An icy chill had hold of her heart. Not
only of her heart, but of her brain and her whole being. Strive as
she might, she could not enter into Bertrand's schemes, and as his
whole entity was wrapped up in them she felt estranged from him,
out of touch, shut out from his heart. Unspeakable bitterness
filled her soul. She hated Theresia Cabarrus, who had enslaved
Bertrand's fancy, and above all she mistrusted her. At this moment
she would gladly have given her life to get Bertrand away from the
influence of that woman and away from that madcap association which
called itself "the Fatalists," and into which he had dragged both
Joséphine and Jacques.</p>

<p>Silently she preceded him out of the little church porch, the
habitual trysting-place, where at one time she had spent so many
happy hours. Just before she turned off into the street, she looked
back, as if through the impenetrable darkness which enveloped it
now she would conjure up, just once more, those happy images of the
past, but the darkness made no response to the mute cry of her
fancy, and with a last sigh of intense bitterness, she followed
Bertrand down the street.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>Less than five minutes after Bertrand and Régine had left the
porch of Petit St. Antoine, the heavy oak door of the church was
cautiously opened. It moved noiselessly upon its hinges, and
presently through the aperture the figure of a man emerged, hardly
discernible in the gloom. He slipped through the door into the
porch, then closed the former noiselessly behind him.</p>

<p>A moment or two later his huge, bulky figure was lumbering up
the Rue St. Antoine, in the direction of the Arsenal, his
down-at-heel shoes making a dull clip-clop on the cobblestones.
There were but very few passers-by at this hour, and the man went
along with his peculiar shuffling gait until he reached the Porte
St. Antoine. The city gates were still open at this hour, for it
was only a little while ago that the many church clocks of the
quartier had struck eight, nor did the sergeant at the gate pay
much heed to the beggarly caitiff who went by; only he and the
half-dozen men of the National Guard who were in charge of the
gate, did remark that the belated wayfarer appeared to be in
distress with a terrible asthmatic cough which caused one of the
men to say with grim facetiousness:</p>

<p>"Pardi! but here's a man who will not give maman guillotine any
trouble!"</p>

<p>They all noticed, moreover, that after the asthmatic giant had
passed through the city gate, he turned his shuffling footsteps in
the direction of the Rue de la Planchette.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>Chapter V&mdash;Rascality
Rejoices</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>The Fraternal Suppers were a great success. They were the
invention of Robespierre, and the unusual warmth of these early
spring evenings lent the support of their balmy atmosphere to the
scheme.</p>

<p>Whole Paris is out in the streets on these mild April nights.
Families out on a holiday, after the daily spectacle of the
death-cart taking the enemies of the people, the conspirators
against their liberty, to the guillotine.</p>

<p>And maman brings a basket filled with whatever scanty provisions
she can save from the maximum per day allowed for the provisioning
of her family. Beside her, papa comes along, dragging his youngest
by the hand&mdash;the latter no longer chubby and rosy, as were his
prototypes in the days gone by, because food is scarce and dear,
and milk unobtainable; but looking a man for all that, though
bare-footed and bare-kneed, with the red cap upon his lank,
unwashed locks, and hugging against his meagre chest a tiny toy
guillotine, the latest popular fancy, all complete with miniature
knife and pulleys, and frame artistically painted a vivid
crimson.</p>

<p>The Rue St. Honoré is a typical example of what goes on all over
the city. Though it is very narrow and therefore peculiarly
inconvenient for the holding of outdoor entertainments, the
Fraternal Suppers there are extensively patronized, because the
street itself is consecrated as holding the house wherein lives
Robespierre.</p>

<p>Here, as elsewhere, huge braziers are lit at intervals, so that
materfamilias may cook the few herrings she has brought with her if
she be so minded, and all down the narrow street tables are set,
innocent of cloths or even of that cleanliness which is next to the
equally neglected virtue of godliness. But the tables have an air
of cheeriness nevertheless, with resin torches, tallow candles, or
old stable lanthorns set here and there, the flames flickering in
the gentle breeze, adding picturesqueness to the scene which might
otherwise have seemed sordid, with those pewter mugs and tin
plates, the horn-handled knives and iron spoons.</p>

<p>The scanty light does little more than accentuate the darkness
around, the deep shadows under projecting balconies or lintels of
portes-cochères carefully closed and barred for the night; but it
glints with weird willo'-the-wisp-like fitfulness on crimson caps
and tricolour cockades, on drawn and begrimed faces, bony arms, or
lean, brown hands.</p>

<p>A motley throng, in truth! The workers of Paris, its
proletariat, all conscripted servants of the State&mdash;slaves, we
might call them, though they deem themselves free men&mdash;all
driven into hard manual labour, partly by starvation and wholly by
the decree of the Committees, who decide how and when and in what
form the nation requires the arms or hands&mdash;not the brains,
mind you!&mdash;of its citizens. For brains the nation has no use,
only in the heads of those who sit in Convention of on Committees.
"The State hath no use for science," was grimly said to Lavoisier,
the great chemist, when he begged for a few days' surcease from
death in order to complete some important experiments.</p>

<p>But coal-heavers are useful citizens of the State; so are smiths
and armourers and gunmakers, and those who can sew and knit
stockings, do anything in fact to clothe and feed the national
army, the defenders of the sacred soil of France. For them, for
those workers&mdash;the honest, the industrious, the
sober&mdash;are the Fraternal Suppers invented; but not for them
only. There are the "tricotteuses," sexless hags, who, by order of
the State, sit at the foot of the scaffold surrounded by their
families and their children and knit, and knit, the while they
jeer&mdash;still by order of the State&mdash;at the
condemned&mdash;old men, young women, children even, as they walk
up to the guillotine. There are the "insulteuses publiques," public
insulters, women mostly&mdash;save the mark!&mdash;paid to howl and
blaspheme as the death-carts rattle by. There are the "tappe-durs,"
the hit-hards, who, armed with weighted sticks, form the body-guard
around the sacred person of Robespierre. Then, the members of the
Société Révolutionnaire, recruited from the refuse of misery and of
degradation of this great city; and&mdash;oh, the horror of it
all!&mdash;the "Enfants Rouges," the red children, who cry "Death"
and "à la lanterne" with the best of them&mdash;precocious little
offsprings of the new Republic. For them, too, are the Fraternal
Suppers established: for all the riff-raff, all the sweepings of
abject humanity. For they too must be amused and entertained, lest
they sit in clusters and talk themselves into the belief that they
are more wretched, more indigent, more abased, than they were in
the days of monarchical oppression.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>And so, on these balmy evenings of mid-April, family parties are
gathered in the open air, around meagre suppers that are
"fraternal" by order of the State. Family parties which make for
camaraderie between the honest man and the thief, the sober citizen
and the homeless vagabond, and help one to forget awhile the
misery, the starvation, the slavery, the daily struggle for bare
existence, in anticipation of the belated Millennium.</p>

<p>There is even laughter around the festive boards, fun and
frolic, jokes are cracked, mostly of a grim order. There is
intoxication in the air: spring has got into the heads of the
young. And there is even kissing under the shadows, love-making,
sentiment; and here and there perhaps a shred of real
happiness.</p>

<p>The provisions are scanty. Every family brings its own. Two or
three herrings, sprinkled with shredded onions and wetted with a
little vinegar, or else a few boiled prunes or a pottage of lentils
and beans.</p>

<p>"Can you spare some of that bread, citizen?"</p>

<p>"Aye! if I can have a bite of your cheese."</p>

<p>They are fraternal suppers! Do not, in the name of Liberty and
Equality, let us forget that. And the whole of it was Robespierre's
idea. He conceived and carried it through, commanded the voices in
the Convention that voted the money required for the tables, the
benches, the tallow candles. He lives close by, in this very
street, humbly, quietly, like a true son of the people, sharing
house and board with citizen Duplay, the cabinet-maker, and with
his family.</p>

<p>A great man, Robespierre! The only man! Men speak of him with
bated breath, young girls with glowing eyes. He is the fetich, the
idol, the demigod. No benefactor of mankind, no saint, no
hero-martyr was ever worshipped more devotedly than this
death-dealing monster by his votaries. Even the shade of Danton is
reviled in order to exalt the virtues of his successful rival.</p>

<p>"Danton was gorged with riches: his pockets full, his stomach
satisfied! But look at Robespierre!"</p>

<p>"Almost a wraith!&mdash;so thin, so white!"</p>

<p>"An ascetic!"</p>

<p>"Consumed by the fire of his own patriotism."</p>

<p>"His eloquence!"</p>

<p>"His selflessness!"</p>

<p>"You have heard him speak, citizen?"</p>

<p>A girl, still in her 'teens, her elbows resting on the table,
her hands supporting her rounded chin, asks the question with bated
breath. Her large grey eyes, hollow and glowing, are fixed upon her
vis-à-vis, a tall, ungainly creature, who sprawls over the table,
vainly trying to dispose of his long limbs in a manner comfortable
to himself.</p>

<p>His hair is lank and matted with grease, his face covered in
coal-dust; a sennight's growth of beard, stubbly and dusty,
accentuates the squareness of his jaw even whilst it fails to
conceal altogether the cruel, sarcastic curves of his mouth. But
for the moment, in the rapt eyes of the young enthusiast, he is a
prophet, a seer, a human marvel: he has heard Robespierre
speak.</p>

<p>"Was it in the Club, citizen Rateau?" another woman asks&mdash;a
young matron with a poor little starveling at her breast.</p>

<p>The man gives a loud guffaw, displays in the feeble, flickering
light of the nearest torch a row of hideous uneven teeth, scored
with gaps and stained with tobacco juice.</p>

<p>"In the Club?" he says with a curse, and spits in a convenient
direction to show of his contempt for that or any other
institution. "I don't belong to any Club. There's no money in my
pocket. And the Jacobins and the Cordeliers like to see a man with
a decent coat on his back."</p>

<p>His guffaw broke in a rasping cough which seemed to tear his
broad chest to ribbons. For a moment speech was denied him; even
oaths failed to reach his lips, trembling like an unset jelly in
this distressing spasm. His neighbours alongside the table, the
young enthusiast opposite, the comely matron, paid no heed to
him&mdash;waited indifferently until the clumsy lout had regained
his breath. This, mark you, was not an era of gentleness or womanly
compassion, and an asthmatic mudlark was not like to excite pity.
Only when he once more stretched out his long limbs, raised his
head and looked about him, panting and blear-eyed, did the girl
insist quietly:</p>

<p>"But you have heard <i>Him</i> speak!"</p>

<p>"Aye!" the ruffian replied drily. "I did."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Night before last. Tenez! He was stepping out of citizen
Duplay's house yonder. He saw me leaning against the wall close by.
I was tired, half asleep, what? He spoke to me and asked me where I
lived."</p>

<p>"Where you lived?' the girl echoed, disappointed.</p>

<p>"Was that all?" the matron added with a shrug of her
shoulders.</p>

<p>The neighbours laughed. The men enjoyed the discomfiture of the
women, who were all craning their necks to hear something great,
something palpitating, about their idol.</p>

<p>The young enthusiast sighed, clasped her hands in favour.</p>

<p>"He saw that you were poor, citizen Rateau," she said with
conviction; "and that you were tired. He wished to help and comfort
you."</p>

<p>"And where did you say you lived, citizen?" the young matron
went on, in her calm, matter-of-fact tone.</p>

<p>"I live far from here, the other side of the water, not in an
aristocratic quarter like this one&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"You told <i>Him</i> you lived there?" the girl still insisted.
Any scrap or crumb of information even remotely connected with her
idol was manna to her body and balm to her soul.</p>

<p>"Yes, I did," citizen Rateau assented.</p>

<p>"Then," the girl resumed earnestly, "solance and comfort will
come to you very soon, citizen. He never forgets. His eyes are upon
you. He knows your distress and that you are poor and weary. Leave
it to him, citizen Rateau. He will know how and when to help."</p>

<p>"He will know, more like," here broke in a harsh voice,
vibrating with excitement, "how and when to lay his talons on an
obscure and helpless citizen whenever his Batches for the
guillotine are insufficient to satisfy his lust!"</p>

<p>A dull murmur greeted this tirade. Only those who sat close by
the speaker knew which he was, for the lights were scanty and burnt
dim in the open air. The others only heard&mdash;received this
arrow-shot aimed at their idol&mdash;with for the most part a kind
of dull resentment. The women were more loudly indignant. One or
two young devotees gave a shrill cry or so of passionate
indignation.</p>

<p>"Shame! Treason!"</p>

<p>"Guillotine, forsooth! The enemies of the people all deserve the
guillotine!"</p>

<p>And the enemies of the people were those who dared raise their
voice against their Chosen, their Fetich, the great,
incomprehensible Mystery.</p>

<p>Citizen Rateau was once more rendered helpless by a tearing fit
of coughing.</p>

<p>But from afar, down the street, there came one or two assenting
cries.</p>

<p>"Well spoken, young man! As for me, I never trusted that
bloodhound!"</p>

<p>And a woman's voice added shrilly: "His hands reek of blood. A
butcher, I call him!"</p>

<p>"And a tyrant!" assented the original spokesman. "His aim is a
dictatorship, with his minions hanging around him like abject
slaves. Why not Versailles, then? How are we better off now than in
the days of kingship? Then, at least, the streets of Paris did not
stink of blood. Then, at least&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the speaker got no father. A hard crust of very dry, black
bread, aimed by a sure hand, caught him full in the face, whilst a
hoarse voice shouted lustily:</p>

<p>"Hey there, citizen! If thou'lt not hold thy tongue 'tis thy
neck that will be reeking with blood o'er soon, I'll warrant!"</p>

<p>"Well said, citizen Rateau!" put in another, speaking with his
mouth full, but with splendid conviction. "Every word uttered by
that jackanapes yonder reeks of treason!"</p>

<p>"Shame!" came from every side.</p>

<p>"Where are the agents of the Committee of Public Safety? Men
have been thrown into prison for less than this."</p>

<p>"Shame!"</p>

<p>"Denounce him!"</p>

<p>"Take him to the nearest Section!"</p>

<p>"Ere he wreaks mischief more lasting than words!" cried a woman,
who tried as she spoke to give her utterance its full, sinister
meaning.</p>

<p>"Shame! Treason!" came soon from every side. Voices were raised
all down the length of the tables&mdash;shrill, full-throated, even
dull and indifferent. Some really felt indignation&mdash;burning,
ferocious indignation; others only made a noise for the sheer
pleasure of it, and because the past five years had turned cries of
"Treason!" and of "Shame!" into a habit. Not that they knew what
the disturbance was about. The street was long and narrow, and the
cries came some way from where they were sitting; but when cries of
"Treason!" flew through the air these days, 'twas best to join in,
lest those cries turned against one, and the next stage in the
proceedings became the approach of an Agent of the Sûreté, the
nearest prison, and the inevitable guillotine.</p>

<p>So every one cried "Shame!" and "Treason!" whilst those who had
first dared to raise their voices against the popular demagogue
drew together into a closer batch, trying no doubt to gather
courage through one another's proximity. Eager, excited, a small
compact group of two men&mdash;one a mere boy&mdash;and three
women, it almost seemed as if they were suffering from some
temporary hallucination. How else would five isolated
persons&mdash;three of them in their first youth&mdash;have dared
to brave a multitude?</p>

<p>In truth Bertrand Moncrif, face to face as he believed with
martyrdom, was like one transfigured. Always endowed with good
looks, he appeared like a veritable young prophet, haranguing the
multitude and foretelling its doom. The gloom partly hid his
figure, but his hand was outstretched, and the outline of an
avenging finger pointing straight out before him, appeared in the
weird light of the resin torch, as if carved in glowing lava. Now
and then the fitful light caught the sharp outline of his
face&mdash;the straight nose and pointed chin, and brown hair
matted with the sweat of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Beside him Régine, motionless and white as a wraith, appeared
alive only by her eyes, which were fixed on her beloved. In the
hulking giant with the asthmatic cough she had recognized the man
to whom she had ministered earlier in the day. Somehow, his
presence here and now seemed to her sinister and threatening. It
seemed as if all day he had been dogging her footsteps: first at
the soothsayer's then he surely must have followed her down the
street. Then he had inspired her with pity; now his hideous face,
his grimy hands, that croaking voice and churchyard cough, filled
her with nameless terror.</p>

<p>He appeared to her excited fancy like a veritable spectre of
death, hovering over Bertrand and over those she loved. With one
arm she tried to press her brother Jacques closer to her breast, to
quench his eagerness and solence his foolhardy tongue. But he, like
a fierce, impatient young animal, fought to free himself from her
loving embrace, shouted approval to Bertrand's oratory, played his
part of the young propagandist, heedless of Régine's warnings and
of his mother's tears. Next to Régine, her sister Joséphine&mdash;a
girl not out of her 'teens, with all the eagerness and exaggeration
of extreme youth, was shouting quite as loudly as her brother
Jacques, clapping her small hands together, turning glowing,
defying, arrogant eyes on the crowd of great unwashed whom she
hoped to sway with her ardour and her eloquence.</p>

<p>"Shame on us all!" she cried with passionate vehemence. "Shame
on us French women and French men that we should be the abject
slaves of such a bloodthirsty tyrant!"</p>

<p>Her mother, pale-faced, delicate, had obviously long since given
up all hope of controlling this unruly little crowd. She was too
listless, too anemic, had no doubt suffered too much already, to be
afraid for herself or for her children. She was past any thought or
fear. Her wan face only expressed despair&mdash;despair that was
absolutely final&mdash;and the resignation of silent
self-immolation, content to suffer beside those she loved, only
praying to be allowed to share their martyrdom, even though she had
no part in their enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Bertrand, Joséphine and Jacques had all the ardour of martyrdom.
Régine and her mother all its resignation.</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>The Fraternal Supper threatened to end in a free fight, wherein
the only salvation for the young fire-eaters would lie in a swift
taking to their heels. And even then the chances would be
hopelessly against them. Spies of the Convention, spies of the
Committees, spies of Robespierre himself, swarmed all over the
place. They were marked men and women, those five. It was useless
to appear defiant and high-minded and patriotic. Even Danton had
gone to the guillotine for less.</p>

<p>"Shame! Treason!"</p>

<p>The balmy air of mid-April seemed to echo the sinister words,
but Bertrand appeared unconscious of all danger. Nay! it almost
seemed as if he courted it.</p>

<p>"Shame on you all!" he called out loudly, and his fresh,
sonorous voice rang out above the tumult and the hoarse murmurings.
"Shame on the people of France for bowing their necks to such
monstrous tyranny. Citizens of Paris, think on it! Is not Liberty a
mockery now? Do you call your bodies your own? They are but food
for cannon at the bidding of the Convention. Your families? You are
parted from those you love. Your wife? You are torn from her
embrace. Your children? They are taken from you for the service of
the State. And by whose orders? Tell me that! By whose orders, I
say?"</p>

<p>He was lashing himself into a veritable fury of self-sacrifice,
stood up beside the table and with a gesture even bade Joséphine
and Jacques be still. As for Régine, she hardly was conscious that
she lived, so acute, so poignant was her emotion, so gaunt and real
the approach of death which threatened her beloved.</p>

<p>This of course was the end&mdash;this folly, this mad,
senseless, useless folly! Already through the gloom she could see
as in a horrible vision all those she cared for dragged before a
tribunal that knew of no mercy; she could hear the death-carts
rattling along the cobblestones, she could see the hideous arms of
the guillotine, ready to receive this unique, this believed, this
precious prey. She could feel Joséphine's arms clinging pitiably to
her for courage; she could see Jacques' defiant young face,
glorying in martyrdom; she could see maman, drooping like a faded
flower, bereft of what was life to her&mdash;the nearness of her
children. She could see Bertrand, turning with a dying look of
love, not to her but to the beautiful Spaniard who had captured his
fancy and then sold him without compunction to the spies of
Robespierre and of her own party.</p>

<p class="cpb">4.</p>

<p>But for the fact that this was a "Fraternal Supper," that people
had come out here with their families, their young children, to eat
and to make merry and to forget all their troubles as well as the
pall of crime that hung over the entire city, I doubt not but what
the young Hotspur and his crowd of rashlings would ere now have
been torn from their eats, trampled under foot, at best been
dragged to the nearest Commissary, as the asthmatic citizen Rateau
had already threatened. Even as it was, the temper of many a
paterfamilias was sorely tried by this insistence, with willful
twisting of the tigers' tails. And the women were on the verge of
reprisals. As for Rateau, he just seemed to gather his huge limbs
together, uttered an impatient oath and an angry: "By all the cats
and dogs that render this world hideous with their howls, I have
had about enough of this screeching oratory." Then he threw one
long leg over the bench on which he had been sitting, and in an
instant was lost in the gloom, only to reappear in the dim light a
few seconds later, this time on the farther side of the table,
immediately behind the young rhetorician, his ugly, begrimed face
with its grinning, toothless mouth and his broad, bent shoulders
towering above the other's slender figure.</p>

<p>"Knock him down, citizen!" a young woman cried excitedly. "Hit
him in the face! Silence his abominable tongue!"</p>

<p>But Bertrand was not to be silenced yet. No doubt the fever of
notoriety, of martyrdom, had got into his blood. His youth, his
good looks&mdash;obvious even in the fitful light and despite his
tattered clothes&mdash;were an asset in his favour, no doubt; but a
man-eating tiger is apt to be indiscriminate in his appetites and
will devour a child with as much gusto as a gaffer; and this
youthful firebrand was teasing the man-eating tiger with reckless
insistence.</p>

<p>"By whose orders," he reiterated, with passionate vehemence, "by
whose orders are we, free citizens of France, dragged into this
abominable slavery? Is it by those of the Representatives of the
People? No! Of the Committees chosen by the People? No! Of your
Municipalities? your Clubs? your Sections? No! and again No! Your
bodies, citizens, your freedom, your wives, your children, are all
slaves, the property, the toys of one man&mdash;real tyrant and
traitor, the oppressor of the weak, the enemy of the people; and
that man is&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again he was interrupted, this time more forcibly. A terrific
blow on the head deprived him of speech and of sight. His senses
reeled, there was a mighty buzzing in his ears, which effectually
drowned the cries of execration or of approval that greeted his
tirade, as well as a new and deafening tumult which filled the
whole narrow street with its weird and hideous sounds.</p>

<p>Whence the blow had come, Bertrand had no notion. It had all
been so swift. He had expected to be torn limb from limb, to be
dragged to the nearest Commissariat: he courted condemnation,
envisaged the guillotine; 'stead of which, he was prosily knocked
down by a blow which would have felled an ox.</p>

<p>Just for a second, his fast-fading perceptions struggled back
into consciousness. He had a swift vision of a giant form towering
over him, with grimy fist uplifted and toothless mouth grinning
hideously, and of the crowd, rising from their seats, turning their
backs upon him, waving their arms and caps frantically, and
shouting, shouting, with vociferous lustiness. He also had an
equally swift pang of remorse as the faces of his
companions&mdash;of Régine and Mme de Serval, of Joséphine and
Jacques&mdash;whom he dragged with him into this mad and
purposeless outburst, rose prophetically before him from out the
gloom, with wide-eyed, scared faces and arms uplifted to ward off
vengeful blows.</p>

<p>But the next moment these lightning-like visions faded into
complete oblivion. He felt something hard and heavy hitting him in
the back. All the lights, the faces, the outstretched hands, danced
wildly before his eyes, and he sank like a log on the greasy
pavement, dragging pewter plates, mugs and bottles down with him in
his fall.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>Chapter VI&mdash;One Crowded Hour of
Glorious Life</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>And all the while, the people were shouting:</p>

<p>"<i>Le violà!</i>"</p>

<p>"Robespierre!"</p>

<p>The Fraternal Supper was interrupted. Men and women pushed and
jostled and screamed, the while a small, spare figure in dark cloth
coat and immaculate breeches, with smooth brown hair and
pale-ascetic face, stood for a moment under the lintel of a gaping
porte-cochère. He had two friends with him; handsome, enthusiastic
St. Just, the right hand and the spur of the bloodthirsty monster,
own kinsman to Armand St. Just the renegade, whose sister was
married to a rich English milor; and Couthon, delicate,
half-paralysed, wheeled about in a chair, with one foot in the
grave, whose devotion to the tyrant was partly made up of ambition,
and wholly of genuine admiration.</p>

<p>At the uproarious cheering which greeted his appearance,
Robespierre advanced into the open, whilst a sudden swift light of
triumph darted from his narrow, pale eyes.</p>

<p>"And you still hesitate!" St. Just whispered excitedly in his
ear. "Why, you hold the people absolutely in the hollow of your
hand!"</p>

<p>"Have patience, friend!" Couthon remonstrated quietly.
"Robespierre's hour is about to strike. To hasten it now, might be
courting disaster."</p>

<p>Robespierre himself would, in the meanwhile, have been in
serious danger through the exuberant welcome of his admirers. Their
thoughtless crowding around his person would easily have given some
lurking enemy or hot-headed, would-be martyr the chance of wielding
an assassin's knife with success, but for the presence amongst the
crowd of his "tappe-durs"&mdash;hit-hards&mdash;a magnificent
bodyguard composed of picked giants from the mining districts of
Eastern France, who rallied around the great man, and with their
weighted sticks kept the enthusiastic crowd at bay.</p>

<p>He walked a few steps down the street, keeping close to the
houses on his left; his two friends, St. Just and Couthon in his
carrying chair, were immediately behind him, and between these
three and the mob, the tappe-durs, striding two abreast, formed a
solid phalanx.</p>

<p>Then, all of a sudden, the great man came to a halt, faced the
crowd, and with an impressive gesture imposed silence and
attention. His bodyguard cleared a space for him and he stood in
the midst of them, with the light of a resin torch striking full
upon his spare figure and bringing into bold relief that thin face
so full of sinister expression, the cruel mouth and the coldly
glittering eyes. He was looking straight across the table, on which
the débris of Fraternal Suppers lay in unsavoury confusion.</p>

<p>On the other side of the table, Mme de Serval with her three
children sat, or rather crouched, closely huddled against one
another. Joséphine was clinging to her mother, Jacques to Régine.
Gone was the eagerness out of their attitude now, gone the
enthusiasm that had reviled the bloodthirsty tyrant in the teeth of
a threatening crowd. It seemed as if, with that terrific blow dealt
by a giant hand to Bertrand who was their leader in this mad
adventure, the awesome fear of death had descended upon their
souls. The two young faces as well as that of Mme de Serval
appeared distorted and haggard, whilst Régine's eyes, dilated with
terror, strove to meet Robespierre's steady gaze, which was charged
with sinister mockery.</p>

<p>And for one short interval of time the crowd was silent; and the
everlasting stars looked down from above on the doings of men. To
these trembling, terrified young creatures, suddenly possessed with
youth's passionate desire to live, with a passionate horror of
death, these few seconds of tense silence must have seemed like an
eternity of suffering. Then Robespierre's thin face lighted up in a
portentous smile&mdash;a smile that caused those pale cheeks yonder
to take on a still more ashen hue.</p>

<p>"And where is our eloquent orator of a while ago?" the great man
asked quietly. "I heard my name, for I sat at my window looking
with joy on the fraternization of the people of France. I caught
sight of the speaker, and came down to hear more clearly what he
had to say. But where is he?"</p>

<p>His pale eyes wandered slowly along the crowd; and such was the
power exercised by the extraordinary man, so great the terror that
he inspired, that every one there&mdash;men, women and children,
workers and vagabonds&mdash;turned their eyes away, dared not meet
his glance lest in it they read an accusation or a threat.</p>

<p>Indeed, no one dared to speak. The young rhetorician had
disappeared, and every one trembled lest they should be implicated
in his escape. He had evidently got away under cover of the
confusion and the noise. But his companions were still
there&mdash;four of them; the woman and the boy and the two girls,
crouching like frightened beasts before the obvious fury, the
certain vengeance of the people. The murmurs were ominous. "Death!
Guillotine! Traitors!" were words easily distinguishable in the
confused babbling of the sullen crowd.</p>

<p>Robespierre's cruel, appraising glance rested on those four
pathetic forms, so helpless, so desperate, so terrified.</p>

<p>"Citizens," he said coldly, "did you not hear me ask where your
eloquent companion is at this moment?"</p>

<p>Régine alone knew that he lay like a log under the table, close
to her feet. She had seen him fall, struck by that awful blow from
a brutal fist; but at the ominous query she instinctively pressed
her trembling lips close together, whilst Joséphine and Jacques
clung to her with the strength of despair.</p>

<p>"Do not parley with the rabble, citizen," St. Just whispered
eagerly. "This is a grand moment for you. Let the people of their
own accord condemn those who dared to defame you."</p>

<p>And even Couthon, the prudent, added sententiously:</p>

<p>"Such an opportunity may never occur again."</p>

<p>The people, in truth, were over-ready to take vengeance into
their own hands.</p>

<p>"<i>A la lanterne, les aristos!</i>"</p>

<p>Gaunt, bedraggled forms leaned across the table, shook begrimed
fists in the direction of the four crouching figures. With the
blind instinct of trapped beasts, they retreated into the shadows
step by step, as those threatening fists appeared to draw closer,
clutching at the nearest table and dragging it with them, in an
altogether futile attempt at a barricade.</p>

<p>"Holy Mother of God, protect us!" murmured Mme de Serval from
time to time.</p>

<p>Behind them there was nothing but the rows of houses, no means
of escape even if their trembling knees had not refused them
service; whilst vaguely, through their terror, they were conscious
of the proximity of that awful asthmatic creature with the wheezy
cough and the hideous, toothless mouth. At times he seemed so close
that they shut their eyes, almost feeling his grimy hands around
their throat, his huge, hairy arms dragging them down to death.</p>

<p>It all happened in the space of a very few minutes, far fewer
even than it would take completely to visualize the picture.
Robespierre, like an avenging wraith, theatrical yet impassive,
standing in the light of a huge resin torch, which threw alternate
lights and shadows, grotesque and weird, upon his meagre figure,
now elongating the thin, straight nose, now widening the narrow
mouth, misshaping the figure till it appeared like some fantastic
ghoul-form from the nether world. Behind him, his two friends were
lost in the gloom, as were now Mme de Serval and her children. They
were ensconced against a heavy porte-cochère, a rickety table alone
standing between them and the mob, who were ready to drag them to
the nearest lanthorn and immolate them before the eyes of their
outraged idol.</p>

<p>"Leave the traitors alone!" Robespierre commanded. "Justice will
deal with them as they deserve."</p>

<p>"à la lanterne!" the people&mdash;more especially the
women&mdash;demanded insistently.</p>

<p>Robespierre turned to one of his "tappe-durs."</p>

<p>"Take the aristos to the nearest Commissariat," he said. "I'll
have no bloodshed to mar our Fraternal Supper."</p>

<p>"The Commissariat, forsooth!" a raucous voice positively
bellowed. "Who is going to stand between us and our vengeance?
Robespierre has been outraged by this rabble. Let them perish in
sight of all!"</p>

<p>How it all happened after that, none who were there could in
truth have told you. The darkness, the flickering lights, the glow
of the braziers, which made the inky blackness around more
pronounced, made everything indistinguishable to ordinary human
sight. Certain it is that citizen Rateau&mdash;who had constituted
himself the spokesman of the mob&mdash;was at one time seen
towering behind the four unfortunates, with his huge arms stretched
out, his head thrown back, his mouth wide open, screaming abuse and
vituperation, demanding the people's right to take the law into its
own sovereign hands.</p>

<p>At that moment the light of the nearest resin torch threw his
hulking person into bold relief against a heavy porte-cochère which
was immediately behind him. The mob acclaimed him, cheered him to
the echoes, agreed with him that summary justice in such a case was
lone satisfying. The next instant a puff of wind blew the flame of
the torch in a contrary direction, and darkness suddenly enveloped
the ranting colossus and the cowering prey all ready to his
hand.</p>

<p>"Rateau!" shouted some one.</p>

<p>"Hey, there! citizen Rateau! Where art thou?" came soon from
every side.</p>

<p>No answer came from the spot where Rateau had last been seen,
and it seemed as if just then a strong current of air had slammed a
heavy door to somewhere in the gloom. Citizen Rateau had
disappeared, and the four traitors along with him.</p>

<p>It took a few seconds of valuable time ere the mob suspected
that it was being robbed of its prey. Then a huge upheaval
occurred, a motion of the human mass densely packed in the Rue St.
Honoré, that was not unlike the rush of water through a narrow
gorge.</p>

<p>"Rateau!" People were yelling the name from end to end of the
street.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>Superstition, which was rampant in these days of carnage and of
crime, had possession of many a craven soul. Rateau had vanished.
It seemed as if the Evil One, whose name had been so freely invoked
during the course of the Fraternal Supper, had in very truth
spirited Rateau away.</p>

<p>On the top of the tumult came a silence as complete as that of a
graveyard at midnight. The "tappe-durs," who at their chief's
command had been forging their way through the crowd, in order to
reach the traitors, ceased their hoarse calls of "Make way there,
in the name of the Convention!" whilst St. Just, who still stood
close to his friend, literally saw the cry stifled on Robespierre's
lips.</p>

<p>Robespierre himself had not altogether realized what had
happened. In his innermost heart he had already yielded to his
friends' suggestion, and was willing to let mob-law run its course.
As St. Just had said: what a triumph for himself if his detractors
were lynched by the mob! When Rateau towered above the four
unfortunates, hurling vituperation above their heads, the tyrant
smiled, well satisfied; and when the giant thus incontinently
vanished, Robespierre for a moment or two remained complacent and
content.</p>

<p>Then the whole crowd oscillated in the direction of the
mysterious porte-cochère. Those who were in the front ranks threw
themselves against the heavy panels, whilst those in the rear
pushed with all their might. But the porte-cochères of old Paris
are heavily constructed. Woodwork that had resisted the passage of
centuries withheld the onslaught of a pack of half-starved
caitiffs. But only for awhile.</p>

<p>The mob, fearing that it was getting foiled, broke into a howl
of execration, and Robespierre, his face more drawn and grey than
before, turned to his companions, trying to read their
thoughts.</p>

<p>"If it should be&mdash;" St. Just murmured, yet dared not put
his surmise into words.</p>

<p>Nor had he time to do so, or Robespierre the leisure to
visualize his own fears. Already the massive oak panels were
yielding to persistent efforts. The mighty woodwork began to crack
under the pressure of this living battering ram; when suddenly the
howls of those who were in the rear turned to a wild cry of
delight. Those who were pushing against the porte-cochère paused in
their task. All necks were suddenly craned upwards. The weird
lights of torches and the glow of braziers glinted on gaunt necks
and upturned chins, turned heads and faces into phantasmagoric,
unearthly shapes.</p>

<p>Robespierre and his two companions instinctively looked up too.
There, some few métres lower down the street, on the third-floor
balcony of a neighbouring house, the figure of Rateau had just
appeared. The window immediately behind him was wide open and the
room beyond was flooded with light, so that his huge person
appeared distinctly silhouetted&mdash;a black and gargantuan
mass&mdash;against the vivid and glowing background. His head was
bare, his lank hair fluttered in the breeze, his huge chest was
bare and his ragged shirt hung in tatters from his brawny arms.
Flung across his left shoulder, he held an inanimate female form,
whilst with his right hand he dragged another through the open
window in his wake. Just below him, a huge brazier was shedding its
crimson glow.</p>

<p>The sight of him&mdash;gaunt, weird, a veritable tower of
protean revenge&mdash;paralyzed the most ebullient, silenced every
clamour. For the space of two seconds only did he stand there, in
full view of the crowd, in full view of the almighty tyrant whose
defamation he had sworn to avenge. Then he cried in stentorian
tones:</p>

<p>"Thus perish all conspirators against the liberty of the people,
all traitors to its cause, by the hands of the people and for the
glory of their chosen!"</p>

<p>And, with a mighty twist of his huge body, he picked up the
inanimate form that lay lifeless at his feet. For a moment he held
the two in his arms, high above the iron railing of the balcony;
for a moment those two lifeless, shapeless forms hung in the
darkness in mid-air, whilst an entire crowd of fanatics held their
breath and waited, awed and palpitating, only to break out into
frantic cheering as the giant hurled the two lifeless bodies down,
straight into the glowing brazier.</p>

<p>"Two more to follow!" he shouted lustily.</p>

<p>There was pushing and jostling and cheering. Women screamed, men
blasphemed and children cried. Shouts of "Vive Rateau!" mingled
with those of "Vive Robespierre!" a circle was formed, hands
holding hands, and a wild saraband danced around the glowing
brazier. And this mad orgy of enthusiasm lasted for full three
minutes, until the foremost among those who, awestruck and
horrified, had approached the brazier in order to see the final
agony of the abominable traitor, burst out with a prolonged
"Malediction!"</p>

<p>Beyond that exclamation, they were speechless&mdash;pointed with
trembling hands at the shapeless bundles on which the dull fire of
the braziers had not yet obtained a purchase.</p>

<p>The bundles were shapeless indeed. Rags hastily tied together to
represent human forms; but rags only! No female traitors, no
aristos beneath! The people had been fooled, hideously fooled by a
traitor all the more execrable, as he had seemed one of
themselves.</p>

<p>"Malediction! Death to the traitor!"</p>

<p>Aye, death indeed! The giant, whoever he might be, would have to
bear a charmed life if he were to escape the maddened fury of a
foiled populace.</p>

<p>"Rateau!" they shouted hoarsely.</p>

<p>They looked up to that third-floor balcony which had so
fascinated them awhile ago. But now the window was shut and no
light from within chased the gloom that hung over the houses
around.</p>

<p>"Rateau!" the people shouted.</p>

<p>But Rateau had disappeared. It all seemed like a dream, a
nightmare. Had Rateau really existed, or was he a wraith, sent to
tease and to scare those honest patriots who were out for liberty
and for fraternity? Many there were who would have liked to hold on
to that theory&mdash;men and women whose souls, warped and starved
by the excesses and the miseries of the past five years, clung to
any superstition, any so-called supernatural revelations, that
failed to replace the old religion that had been banished from
their hearts.</p>

<p>But in this case not even superstition could be allowed free
play. Rateau had vanished, it is true. The house from whence he had
thus mocked and flouted the people was searched through and through
by a mob who found nothing but bare boards and naked walls, empty
rooms and disused cupboards on which to wreak its fury.</p>

<p>But down there, lying on the top of the brazier, were those two
bundles of rags slowly being consumed by the smouldering embers,
silent proofs of the existence of that hulking creature whose size
and power had, with that swiftness peculiar to human conceptions,
already become legendary.</p>

<p>And in a third-floor room, a lamp that had recently been
extinguished, a coil of rope, more rags, male and female clothes,
a pair of boots, a battered hat, were mute witnesses to the swift
passage of the mysterious giant with the wheezy cough&mdash;the
trickster who had fooled a crowd and thrown the great Robespierre
himself into ridicule.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>Chapter VII&mdash;Two
Interludes</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>Two hours later the Rue St. Honoré had resumed its habitual
graveyard-like stillness. The stillness had to come at last. Men in
their wildest passions, in their most ebullient moods, must calm
down sooner or later, if only temporarily. Blood aglow with
enthusiasm, or rage, or idolatry, cannot retain its fever-pitch
uninterruptedly for long. And so silence of that turbulent scene of
awhile ago.</p>

<p>Here, as in other quarters of Paris, the fraternal suppers had
come to an end; and perspiring matrons, dragging weary children at
their skirts, wended their way homewards, whilst their men went to
consummate the evening's entertainment at one of the numerous clubs
or cabarets where the marvellous doings in the Rue St. Honoré could
be comfortably lived over again or retailed to those, less
fortunate, who had not been there to see.</p>

<p>In the early morning the "nettoyeurs publiques" would be coming
along, to clear away the débris of the festivities and to gather up
the tables and benches which were the property of the several
Municipal sections, and put them away for the next occasion.</p>

<p>But these "nettoyeurs" were not here yet. They, too, were
spending an hour or two in the nearest cabarets, discussing the
startling events that had rendered notorious one corner of the Rue
St. Honoré.</p>

<p>And so the streets were entirely deserted, save here and there
for the swift passage of a furtive form, hugging the walls, with
hands in pockets and a crimson cap pulled over the eyes, anxious
only to escape the vigilance of the night-watchman, swift of foot
and silent of tread; and anon, in the Rue St. Honoré itself, when
even these nightbirds had ceased to flutter, the noiseless movement
of a dark and mysterious form that stirred cautiously upon the
greasy cobblestones. More silent, more furtive than any hunted
beast creeping out of its lair, this mysterious form emerged from
under one of the tables that was standing nearly opposite the house
where Robespierre lived and close to the one where the superhuman
colossus had wrought his magic trick.</p>

<p>It was Bertrand Moncrif. No longer a fiery Desmosthenes now, but
a hunted, terror-filled human creature, whom a stunning blow from a
giant fist had rendered senseless, even whilst it saved him from
the consequences of his own folly. His senses still reeling, his
limbs cramped and aching, he had lain stark and still under the
table just where he had fallen, not sufficiently conscious to
realize what was happening beyond his very limited range of vision
or to marvel what was the ultimate fate of his companions.</p>

<p>His only instinct throughout this comatose condition was the
blind one of self-preservation. Feeling rather than hearing the
tumult around him, he had gathered his limbs close together, lain
as still as a mouse, crouching within himself in the shelter of the
table above. It was only when the silence around had lasted an
eternity of time that he ventured out of his hiding-place. With
utmost caution, hardly daring to breathe, he crept on hands and
knees and looked about him, up and down the street. There was no
one about. The night fortunately was moonless and dark; nature had
put herself on the side of those who wished to pass
unperceived.</p>

<p>Bertrand struggled to his feet, smothering a cry of pain. His
head ached furiously, his knees shook under him; but he managed to
crawl as far as the nearest house, and rested for awhile against
its wall. The fresh air did him good. The April breeze blew across
his burning forehead.</p>

<p>For a few minutes he remained thus, quite still, his eyes
gradually regaining their power of vision. He recollected where he
was and all that had happened. An icy shiver ran down his spine,
for he also remembered Régine and Mme de Serval and the two
children. But he was still too much dazed, really only half
conscious, to do more than vaguely marvel what had become of
them.</p>

<p>He ventured to look fearfully up and down the street. Tables
scattered pell-mell, the unsavoury remnants of fraternal suppers, a
couple of smouldering braziers, collectively met his gaze. And at
one point, sprawling across a table, with head lost between
outstretched arms, a figure, apparently asleep, perhaps dead.</p>

<p>Bertrand, now nothing but a bundle of nerves, could hardly
suppress a cry of terror. It seemed to him as if his life depended
on whether that sprawling figure was alive or dead. But he dared
not approach in order to make sure. For awhile he waited, sinking
more and more deeply into the shadows, watching that motionless
form on which his life depended.</p>

<p>The figure did not move, and gradually Bertrand nerved himself
up to confidence and then to action. He buried his head in the
folds of his coat-collar and his hands in the pockets of his
breeches, and with silence, stealthy footsteps he started to make
his way down the street. At first he looked back once or twice at
the immobile figure sprawling across the table. It had not moved,
still appeared as if it might be dead. Then Bertrand took to his
heels and, no longer looking either behind him or to the right or
left, with elbows pressed close to his side, he started to run in
the direction of the Tuileries.</p>

<p>A minute later, the motionless figure came back to life, rose
quickly and with swift, noiseless tread, started to run in the same
direction.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>In the cabarets throughout the city, the chief topic of
conversation was the mysterious events of the Rue St. Honoré. Those
who had seen it all had marvellous tales to tell of the hero of the
adventure.</p>

<p>"The man was eight or else nine feet high; his arms reached
right across the street from house to house. Flames spurted out of
his mouth when he coughed. He had horns on his head; cloven feet; a
forked tail!"</p>

<p>These were but a few of the observerations which rendered the
person of the fictitious citizen Rateau a legendary one in the eyes
of those who had witnessed his amazing prowess. Those who had not
been thus favoured listened wide-eyed and open-mouthed.</p>

<p>But all agreed that the mysterious giant was in truth none other
than the far-fame Englishman&mdash;that spook, that abominable
trickster, that devil incarnate, known to the Committees as the
Scarlet Pimpernel.</p>

<p>"But how could it be the Englishman?" was suddenly put forward
by citizen Hottot, the picturesque landlord of the Cabaret de la
Liberté, a well-known rendezvous close to the Carrousel. "How could
it be the Englishman who played you that trick, seeing that you all
say it was citizen Rateau who...The devil take it all!" he added,
and scratched his bald head with savage vigour, which he always did
whene'er he felt sorely perplexed. "A man can't be two at one and
the same time; nor two men become one. Nor...Name of a name of a
dog!" concluded the worthy citizen, puffing and blowing in the maze
of his own puzzlement like an old walrus that is floundering in the
water.</p>

<p>"It was the Englishman, I tell thee!" one of his customers
asserted indignantly. "Ask anyone who saw him! Ask the tappe-durs!
Ask Robespierre himself! <i>He</i> saw him, and turned as grey
as&mdash;as putty, I tell thee! he concluded, with more conviction
than eloquence.</p>

<p>"And <i>I</i> tell thee," broke in citizen Sical, the
butcher&mdash;he with the bullet-head and bull-neck and a fist that
could in truth have felled an ox; "I tell thee that it was citizen
Rateau. Don't I know citizen Rateau?" he added, and brought that
heavy fist of his down upon the upturned cask on which stood pewter
mugs and bottles of eau de vie, and glared aggressively round upon
the assembly. He had only one eye; the other presented a hideous
appearance, scarred and blotched, the result of a terrible fatality
in his early youth. The one eye leered with a glance of triumph as
well as of a challenge, daring any less muscular person to impugn
his veracity.</p>

<p>One man alone was bold enough to take up the challenge&mdash;a
wizened little fellow, a printer by trade, with skin of the texture
of grained oak and a few unruly curls that tumbled over one another
above a highly polished forehead.</p>

<p>"And I tell thee, citizen Sical," he said with firm decision; "I
tell thee and those who aver, as thou dost, that citizen Rateau had
anything to do with those monkey-tricks, that ye lie. Yes!" he
reiterated emphatically, and paying no heed to the glowering looks
and blasphemies of Sical and his friends. "Yes, ye lie! Not
consciously, I grant you; but you lie nevertheless. Because&mdash;"
He paused and glanced around him, like a clever actor conscious of
the effect which he produced. His tiny beady eyes blinked in the
glare of the lamp before him.</p>

<p>"Because what?" came in an eager chorus from every side.</p>

<p>"Because," resumed the other sententiously, "all the while that
ye were supping at the expense of the State in the open, and had
your gizzards stirred by the juggling devices of some unknown
mountebank, citizen Rateau was lying comfortably drunk and snoring
lustily in the antechamber of Mother Théot, the soothsayer, right
at the other end of Paris!"</p>

<p>"How do you know that, citizen Langlois?" queried the host with
icy reproval, for butcher Sical was his best customer, and Sical
did not like being contradicted. But little Langlois with the shiny
forehead and tiny, beady, humorous eyes, continued unperturbed.</p>

<p>"Pardi!" he said gaily, "because I was at Mother Théot myself,
and saw him there."</p>

<p>That certainly was a statement to stagger even the great Sical.
It was received in complete silence. Every one promptly felt that
the moment was propitious for another drink; nay! that the
situation demanded it.</p>

<p>Sical, and those who had fought against the Scarlet Pimpernel
theory, were too staggered to speak. They continued to imbibe
citizen Hottot's eau de vie in sullen brooding. The idea of the
legendary Englishman, which has so unexpectedly been strengthened
by citizen Langlois' statement concerning Rateau, was repugnant to
their common sense. Superstition was all very well for women and
weaklings like Langlois; but for men to be asked to accept the
theory that a kind of devil in human shape had so thrown dust in
the eyes of a number of perfectly sober patriots that they
literally could not believe what they saw, was nothing short of an
insult.</p>

<p>And they had <i>seen</i> Rateau at the fraternal supper, had been
talking with him, until the moment when...Then who in Satan's name
had they been talking with?</p>

<p>"Here, Langlois! Tell us&mdash;"</p>

<p>And Langlois, who had become the hero of the hour, told all he
knew, and told it, we are told, a dozen times and more. How he had
gone to Mother Théot's at about four o'clock in the afternoon, and
had sat patiently waiting beside his friend Rateau, who wheezed and
snored alternately for a couple of hours. How, at six o'clock or a
little after, Rateau went out because&mdash;the aristo,
forsooth!&mdash;had found the atmosphere filthy in Mother Théot's
antechamber&mdash;no doubt he went to get another drink.</p>

<p>"At about half-past seven," the little printer went on glibly,
"my turn came to speak with the old witch. When I came out it was
long past eight o'clock and quite dark. I saw Rateau sprawling upon
a bench, half asleep. I tried to speak with him, but he only
grunted. However, I went out then to get a bit of supper at one of
the open-air places, and at ten o'clock I was once more past Mother
Théot's place. One or two people were coming out of the house. They
were all grumbling because they had been told to go. Rateau was one
who was for making a disturbance, but I took him by the arm. We
went down the street together, and parted company in the Rue de
l'Anier, where he lodges. And here I am!" concluded Langlois, and
turned triumphantly to challenge the gaze of every one of the
sceptics around him.</p>

<p>There was not a single doubtful point in his narrative, and
though he was questioned&mdash;aye! and severely cross-questioned,
too&mdash;he never once swerved from his narrative or in any manner
did he contradict himself. Later on it transpired that there were
others who had been in Mother Théot's antechamber that day. They
too subsequently corroborated all that the little printer had said.
One of them was the wife of Sical's own brother; and there were
others. So, what would you?</p>

<p>"Name of a name of a dog, then, who was it then spirited the
aristos away?"</p>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>Chapter VIII&mdash;The Beautiful
Spaniard</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>In the Rue Villedot, which is in the Louvre quarter of Paris,
there is a house, stone built and five-storied, with grey shutters
to all the windows and balconies of wrought iron&mdash;a house
exactly similar to hundreds and thousands of others in every
quarter of Paris. During the day the small wicket in the huge
porte-cochère is usually kept open; it allows a peep into a short
dark passage, and beyond it to the lodge of the concierge. Beyond
this again there is a courtyard, into which, from every one of its
four sides, five rows of windows, all adorned with grey shutters,
blink down like so many colourless eyes. The inevitable
wrought-iron balconies extend along three sides of the quadrangle
on every one of the five floors, and on the balustrade of these,
pieces of carpet in various stages of decay are usually to be seen
hanging out to air. From shutter to shutter clothes lines are
stretched and support fantastic arrays of family linens that flap
lazily in the sultry, vitiated air which alone finds its way down
the shaft of the quadrangle.</p>

<p>On the left of the entrance passage and opposite the lodge of
the concierge there is a tall glass door, and beyond it the
vestibule and primary staircase, which gives access to the
principal apartments&mdash;those that look out upon the street and
are altogether more luxurious and more airy than those which give
upon the courtyard. To the latter, two back stairways give access.
They are at the far corners of the courtyard; both are pitch dark
and reek of stuffiness and evil smells. The apartments which they
serve, especially those on the lower floors, are dependent for
light and air on what modicum of these gifts of heaven comes down
the shaft into the quadrangle.</p>

<p>After dark, of course, porte-cochère and wicket are both closed,
and if a belated lodger or visitor desires to enter the house, he
must ring the bell and the concierge in his lodge will pull a
communicating cord that will unlatch the wicket. It is up to the
belated visitor or lodger to close the wicket after him, and he is
bound by law to give his name, together with the number of the
apartment to which he is going, in to the concierge as he goes past
the lodge. The concierge, on the other hand, will take a look at
him so that he may identify him should trouble or police inquiry
arise.</p>

<p>On this night of April, somewhere near midnight, there was a
ring at the outer door. Citizen Leblanc, the concierge, roused from
his first sleep, pulled the communicating cord. A young man,
hatless and in torn coat and muddy breeches, slipped in through the
wicket and hurried past the lodge, giving only one name, but that
in a clear voice, as he passed:</p>

<p>"Citoyenne Cabarrus."</p>

<p>The concierge turned over in his bed and grunted, half asleep.
His duty clearly was to run after the visitor, who had failed to
give his own name; but to begin with, the worthy concierge was very
tired; and then the name which the belated caller had given was one
requiring special consideration.</p>

<p>The citoyenne Cabarrus was young and well favoured, and even in
these troublous days, youth and beauty demanded certain privileges
which no patriotic concierge could refuse to grant. Moreover, the
aforesaid lady had visitors at all hours of the day and late into
the night&mdash;visitors for the most part with whom it was not
well to interfere. Citizen Tallien, the popular Representative in
the Convention was, as every one knew, her ardent adorer. 'Twas
said by all and sundry that since the days when he met the fair
Cabarrus in Bordeaux and she exercised such a mellowing influence
upon his bloodthirsty patriotism, he had no thought save to win her
regard.</p>

<p>But he was not the only one who came to the dreary old apartment
in the Rue Villedot, with a view to worshipping at the Queen of
Beauty's shrine. Citizen Leblanc had seen many a great
Representative of the People pass by his lodge since the beautiful
Theresia came to dwell here. And if he became very confidential and
his interlocutor very insistent, he would throw out a hint that the
greatest man in France to-day was not infrequent visitor in the
house.</p>

<p>Obviously, therefore, it was best not to pry too closely into
secrets, the keeping of which might prove uncomfortable for one's
peace of mind. And citizen Leblanc, tossing restlessly in his
sleep, dreamed of the fair Cabarrus and wished himself in the place
of those who were privileged and pay their court to her.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>And so the belated visitor was able to make his way across the
courtyard and up the dark back stairs unmolested, but even this
reassuring fact failed to give him confidence. He hurried on with
the swift and stealthy footstep which had become habitual to him,
glancing over his shoulder from time to time, wide-eyed and with
ears alert, and heart quivering with apprehension.</p>

<p>Up the dark and narrow staircase he hurried, dizzy and sick, his
head reeling in the dank atmosphere, his shaking hands seeking the
support of the walls as he climbed wearily up to the third floor.
Here he almost measured his length upon the landing, tottered up
again and came down sprawling on his knees against one of the
doors&mdash;the one which had the number 22 painted upon it. For
the moment it seemed as if he would once more fall into a swoon.
Terror and relief were playing havoc with his whirling brain. He
had not sufficient strength to stretch out an arm in order to ring
the bell, but only beat feebly against the panel of the door with
his moist palm.</p>

<p>A moment later the door was opened, and the unfortunate fell
forward into the vestibule at the feet of a tall apparition clad in
white and holding a small table lamp above her head. The apparition
gave a little scream which was entirely human and wholly feminine,
hastily put down the lamp on a small console close by, and by
retreating forcefully farther into the vestibule, dragged the
half-animate form of the young man along too; for he was now
clinging to a handful of white skirt with the strength of
despair.</p>

<p>"I am lost, Theresia!" he moan pitiably. "Hide me, for God's
sake!...only for to-night!"</p>

<p>Theresia Cabarrus was frowning now, looked more perplexed than
kindly, and certainly made no attempt to raise the crouching figure
from the ground. Anon she called loudly: "Pepita!" and whilst
waiting for an answer to this call, she remained quite still, and
the frown of puzzlement on her face yielded to one of fear. The
young man, obviously only half conscious, continued to moan and to
implore.</p>

<p>"Silence, you fool!" she said peremptorily. "The door is still
open. Anyone on the stairs could hear you. Pepita!" she called
again, more harshly this time.</p>

<p>The next moment an old woman came from somewhere out of the
darkness, threw up her hands at sight of that grovelling figure on
the floor, and would no doubt have broken out in loud lament but
that her young mistress ordered her at once to close the door.</p>

<p>"Then help the citoyen Moncrif to a sofa in my room," the
beautiful Theresia went on peremptorily. "Give him a restorative
and see above all to it that he hold his tongue!"</p>

<p>With a quick imperious jerk she freed herself from the
convulsive grasp of the young man, and walking quickly across the
small vestibule, she went through a door at the end of it that had
been left ajar, leaving the unfortunate Moncrif to the
ministrations of Pepita.</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>Theresia Cabarrus, who had obtained a divorce from her husband,
the Marquis de Fontenay (by virtue of a decree of the former
Legislative Assembly, which allow&mdash;nay, encouraged&mdash;the
dissolution of a marriage with an émigré who refused to return to
France). Theresia Cabarrus was, in this year 1794, in her
twenty-fourth year, and perhaps in the zenith of her beauty and in
the plenitude of that power which had subjugated so many men. In
what that power consisted the historian has vainly tried to guess;
for it was not her beauty only that brought so many to her feet. In
the small oval face, the pointed chin, the full, sensuous lips, so
typically Spanish, we look in vain for traces of that beauty which
we are told surpassed that of other women of her time; whilst in
the dark, velvety eyes, more tender than spiritual, and in the
narrow arched brows, we fail to find an expression of the
<i>esprit</i> which had moulded Tallien to her will and even
brought Robespierre out of the shell of his asceticism&mdash;a
willing victim to her wiles.</p>

<p>But who would be bold enough to analyse that subtle quality,
acknowledged by all, possessed by a very few, which is vaguely
denoted by the word "charm"? Theresia Cabarrus must have possessed
it to a marvellous degree&mdash;that, and an utter callousness for
the feelings of her victims, which would leave her mind cool and
keen to pursue her own ends, whilst theirs was thrown into that
maze of jealousy and of passion wherein prudence flies to the winds
and the fever of self-immolation gets into the blood.</p>

<p>At this moment, in the sparsely furnished room of her dingy
apartment, she looked like an angry goddess. Her figure, which
undeniably was superb, was drawn to its full height, its splendid
proportions accentuated by the clinging folds of her modish
gown&mdash;a marvel of artistic scantiness, which only have
concealed the perfectly modelled bust, and left the rounded thigh,
in its skin-tight, flesh-coloured undergarment, unblushingly
exposed. Her blue-black hair was dressed in the new fashion, copied
from ancient Greece and snooded by a glittering antique fillet; and
her small bare feet were encased in satin sandals. Truly a lovely
woman, but for that air of cold displeasure coupled with fear,
which marred the harmony of the dainty, child-like features.</p>

<p>After awhile Pepita came back.</p>

<p>"Well?" queried Theresia impatiently.</p>

<p>"Poor M. Bertrand is very ill," the old Spanish woman replied
with unconcealed sympathy. "He has fever, the poor cabbage. Bed is
the only place for him..."</p>

<p>"He cannot stay here, as thou well knowest, Pepita," the
imperious beauty retorted drily. "Thy head and mine are in danger
every moment that he spends under this roof."</p>

<p>"But thou couldst not turn a sick man out into the streets in
the middle of the night."</p>

<p>"Why not?" Theresia riposted coldly. "It is a beautiful and
balmy night. Why not?" she reiterated fretfully.</p>

<p>"Because he would die on thy doorstep," was old Pepita's
muttered reply.</p>

<p>Theresia shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"He dies if he goes," she said slowly, "and we die if he stays.
Tell him to go, Pepita, ere citizen Tallien comes."</p>

<p>A shudder went through the old woman's spare frame.</p>

<p>"It is late," she protested. "Citizen Tallien will not come
to-night."</p>

<p>"Not only he," Theresia rejoined coldly,
"but&mdash;but&mdash;the other&mdash;Thou knowest well,
Pepita&mdash;those two arranged to meet here in my lodgings
to-night."</p>

<p>"But not at this hour!"</p>

<p>"After the sitting of the Convention."</p>

<p>"It is nearly midnight. They'll not come," the old woman
persisted obstinately.</p>

<p>"They arranged to meet here, to talk over certain matters which
interest their party," citoyenne Cabarrus went on, equally firmly.
"They'll not fail. So tell citizen Moncrif to go, Pepita. He
endangers my life by staying here."</p>

<p>"Then do the dirty work thyself," the old woman muttered
sullenly. "I'll not be a part to cold-blooded murder."</p>

<p>"Well, since citizen Moncrif's life is more valuable to thee
than mine&mdash;"</p>

<p>Theresia began, but got no father. The words died on her
lips.</p>

<p>Bertrand Moncrif, very pale, still looking scared and wild, had
quietly entered the room.</p>

<p>"You wish me to go, Theresia," he said simply. "You did not
think surely that I would do anything that might endanger your
safety. My God!" he added with passionate vehemence, "Do you not
know that I would at any time lay down my life for yours?"</p>

<p>Theresia shrugged her statuesque shoulders.</p>

<p>"Of course, of course, Bertrand," she said a little impatiently,
though obviously trying to be kind. "But I do entreat you not to go
into heroics at this hour, and not to put on tragic airs. You must
see that for yourself as well as for me it would be fatal if you
were found here, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I am going, Theresia," he broke in seriously. "I ought
never to have come. I was a fool, as usual!" he added with
bitterness. "But after that awful fracas I was dazed and hardly
knew what I was doing."</p>

<p>The frown of vexation reappeared upon the woman's fair, smooth
brow.</p>

<p>"The fracas?" she asked quickly. "What fracas?"</p>

<p>"In the Rue St. Honoré. I thought you knew."</p>

<p>"No. I know nothing," she retorted, and her voice was now
trenchant and hard. "What happened?"</p>

<p>"They were deifying that brute Robespierre&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence!" she broke in harshly. "Name no names."</p>

<p>"And they were deifying a bloodthirsty tyrant, and I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you rose from your seat," she broke in again, and this time
with a laugh that was cruel in its biting irony; "and lashed
yourself into a fury of eloquent vituperation. Oh, I know! I know!"
she went on excitedly. "You and your Fatalists, or whatever you
call yourselves! And that rage for martyrdom!...Senseless, stupid,
and selfish! Oh, my God! <i>how</i> selfish! And then you came here
to drag me down with you into an abyss of misery, along with you to
the guillotine...to..."</p>

<p>It seemed as if she were choking, and her small white hands,
with a gruesome and pathetic gesture, went up to her neck, smoothed
it and fondled it, as if to shield it from that awful fate.</p>

<p>Bertrand tried to pacify her. It was he who was the more calm of
the two now. It seemed as if <i>her</i> danger had brought him back
to full consciousness. He forgot his own danger, the threat of
death which lay in wait for him, probably on the very threshold of
this house. He was a marked man now; martyrdom had ceased to be a
dream: it had become a grim reality. But of this he did not think.
Theresia was in danger, compromised by his own callous selfishness,
his mind was full of her; and Régine, the true and loyal friend,
the beloved of past happier years, had no place in his thoughts
beside the exquisite enchantress, whose very nearness was
paradise.</p>

<p>"I am going," he said earnestly. "Theresia, my beloved, try to
forgive me. I was a fool&mdash;a criminal fool! But
lately&mdash;since I thought that you&mdash;you did not really
care; that all my hopes of future happiness were naught but
senseless dreams; since then I seem to have lost my head&mdash;I
don't know <i>what</i> I am doing!...And so&mdash;"</p>

<p>He got no farther. Ashamed of his own weakness, he was too proud
to let her see that she made him suffer. For the moment, he only
bent the knee and kissed the hem of her diaphanous gown. He looked
so handsome then, despite his bedraggled, woebegone
appearance&mdash;so young, so ardent, that Theresia's egotistical
heart was touched, as it had always been when the incense of his
perfect love rose to her sophisticated nostrils. She put out her
hand and brushed with a gentle, almost maternal, gesture the matted
brown hair from his brow.</p>

<p>"Dear Bertrand," she murmured vaguely. "What a foolish boy to
think that I do not care!"</p>

<p>Already he had been brought back to his senses. The imminence of
her danger lent him the courage which he had been lacking, and
unhesitatingly now he jumped to his feet and turned to go. But she,
quick in the transition of her moods, had already seized him by the
arm.</p>

<p>"No, no!" she murmured in a hoarse whisper. "Don't go just
yet...not before Pepita has seen if the stairs are clear."</p>

<p>Her small hand held him as in a vice, whilst Pepita, obedient
and silent, was shuffling across the vestibule in order toe execute
her mistress's commands. But, even so, Bertrand struggled to get
away. An epitome of their whole life, this struggle between
them!&mdash;he trying to free himself from those insidious bonds
that held him one moment and loosed him the next; that numbed him
to all that he was wont to hold sacred and dear&mdash;his love for
Régine, his loyalty, his honour. An epitome of her character and
his: he, weak and yielding, ever a ready martyr thirsting for
self-immolation; and she, just a bundle of feminine caprice, swayed
by sentiment one moment and by considerations of ambition or of
personal safety the next.</p>

<p>"You must wait, Bertrand," she urged insistently. "Citizen
Tallien may be on the stairs&mdash;he or&mdash;or the other. If
they saw you!...My God!"</p>

<p>"They would conclude that you had turned me out of doors," he
riposted simply. "Which would, in effect, be the truth. I entreat
you to let me go!" he added earnestly. "'Twere better they met me
on the stairs than in here."</p>

<p>The old woman's footsteps were heard hurrying back. Bertrand
struggled to free himself&mdash;did in truth succeed; and Theresia
smothered a desperate cry of warning as he strode rapidly through
the door and across the vestibule only to be met here by Pepita,
who pushed him with all her might incontinently back.</p>

<p>Theresia held her tiny handkerchief to her mouth to deaden the
scream that forced itself to her lips. She had followed Bertrand
out of the salon, and now stood in the doorway, a living statue of
fear.</p>

<p>"Citizen Tallien," Pepita had murmured hurriedly. "He is on the
landing. Come this way."</p>

<p>She dragged Bertrand by the arm, not waiting for orders from her
mistress this time, along a narrow dark passage, which at its
extreme end gave access to a tiny kitchen. Into this she pushed him
and locked the door upon him.</p>

<p>"Name of a name!" she muttered as she shuffled back to the
vestibule. "If they should find him here!"</p>

<p>Citoyenne Cabarrus had not moved. Her eyes, dilated with terror,
mutely questioned the old woman as the latter made ready to admit
the visitor. Pepita gave reply as best she could, by silent
gestures, indicating the passage and the action of turning a key in
the lock. Her wrinkled old lips hardly stirred, and then only in
order to murmur quickly and with a sudden assumption of
authority:</p>

<p>"Self-possession, my cabbage, or you'll endanger yourself and us
all!"</p>

<p>Theresia pulled herself together. Obviously the old woman's
warning was not to be ignored, nor had it been given a moment too
soon. Outside, the visitor had renewed his impatient rat-tat
against the door. The eyes of mistress and maid met for one brief
second. Theresia was rapidly regaining her presence of mind;
whereupon Pepita smoothed out her apron, readjusted her cap, and
went to open the door, even whilst Theresia said in a firm voice,
loudly enough for the new visitor to hear:</p>

<p>"One of my guests, at last! Open quickly, Pepita!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>Chapter IX&mdash;A Hideous, Fearful
Hour</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>A young man&mdash;tall, spare, with sallow skin and shifty,
restless eyes&mdash;pushed unceremoniously past the old servant,
threw his hat and cane down on the nearest chair, and hurrying
across the vestibule, entered the salon where the beautiful
Spaniard, a picture of serene indifference, sat ready to receive
him.</p>

<p>She had chosen for the setting of this scene a small settee
covered in old rose brocade. On this she half sat, half reclined,
with an open book in her hand, her elbow resting on the frame of
the settee, her cheek leaning against her hand. Immediately behind
her, the light from an oil lamp tempered by a shade of
rose-coloured silk, outlined with a brilliant, glowing pencil the
contour of her small head, one exquisite shoulder, and the mass of
her raven hair, whilst it accentuated the cool half-tones of her
diaphanous gown, on the round bare arms and bust, the tiny
sandalled feet and cross-gartered legs.</p>

<p>A picture in truth to dazzle the eyes of any man! Tallien should
have been at her feet in an instant. The fact that he paused in the
doorway bore witness to the unruly thoughts that ran riot in his
brain.</p>

<p>"Ah, citizen Tallien!" the fair Theresia exclaimed with a
perfect assumption of sang-froid. "You are the first to arrive, and
are indeed welcome; for I was nearly swooning with ennui. Well!"
she added, with a provocative smile, and extended a gracious arm in
his direction. "Are you not going to kiss my hand?"</p>

<p>"I heard a voice," was all the response which he gave to this
seductive invitation. "A man's voice. Who was it?"</p>

<p>She raised a pair of delicately pencilled eyebrows. Her eyes
became as round and as innocent-looking as a child's.</p>

<p>"A man's voice?" she riposted with a perfect air of
astonishment. "You are crazy, <i>mon ami</i>; or else are crediting
my faithful Pepita with a virile bass, which in truth she doth not
possess!"</p>

<p>"Whose voice was it?" Tallien reiterated, making an effort to
speak calmly, even though he was manifestly shaking with
choler.</p>

<p>Whereupon the fair Theresia, no longer gracious or arch, looked
him up and down as if he were no better than a lacquey.</p>

<p>"<i>Ah, ça!</i>" she rejoined coldly. "Are you perchance trying
to cross-question me? By what right, I pray you, citizen Tallien,
do you assume this hectoring tone in my presence? I am not yet your
wife, remember; and 'tis not you, I image, who are the dictator of
France."</p>

<p>"Do not tease me, Theresia!" the man interposed hoarsely.
"Bertrand Moncrif is here."</p>

<p>For the space of a second, or perhaps less, Theresia gave no
reply to the taunt. Her quick, alert brain had already faced
possibilities, and she was far too clever a woman to take the risks
which a complete evasion of the truth would have entailed at this
moment. She did not, in effect, know whether Tallien was speaking
from positive information given to him by spies, or merely from
conjecture born of jealousy. Moreover, another would be here
presently&mdash;another, whose spies were credited with
omniscience, and whom she might not succeed in dominating with a
smile or a frown, as she could the love-sick Tallien. Therefore,
after that one brief instant's reflection she decided to temporize,
to shelter behind a half-truth, and replied, with a quick glance
from under her long lashes:</p>

<p>"I am not teasing you, citizen. Bertrand came here for shelter
awhile ago."</p>

<p>Tallien drew a quick sigh of satisfaction, and she went on
carelessly:</p>

<p>"But, obviously, I could not keep him here. He seemed hurt and
frightened...He has been gone this past half-hour."</p>

<p>For a moment it seemed as if the man, in face of this obvious
lie, would flare out into a hot retort; but Theresia's luminous
eyes subdued him, and before the cool contempt expressed by those
exquisite lips, he felt all his blustering courage oozing away.</p>

<p>"The man is an abominable and an avowed traitor," he said
sullenly. "Only two hours ago&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," she broke in coldly. "He vilified Robespierre. A
dangerous thing to do. Bertrand was ever a fool, and he lost his
head."</p>

<p>"He will lose it more effectually to-morrow," Tallien retorted
grimly.</p>

<p>"You mean that you would denounce him?"</p>

<p>"That I <i>will</i> denounce him. I would have done so to-night,
before coming here, only&mdash;only&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only what?"</p>

<p>"I was afraid he might be here."</p>

<p>Theresia broke into a ringing if somewhat artificial peal of
laughter.</p>

<p>"I must thank you, citizen, for this consideration of my
feelings. It was, in truth, thoughtful of you to think of sparing
me a scandal. But, since Bertrand is <i>not</i> here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know where he lodges. He'll not escape, <i>citoyenne</i>. My
word on it!"</p>

<p>Tallien spoke very quietly, but with that concentrated fury of
which a fiercely jealous man is ever capable. He had remained
standing in the doorway all this while, his eyes fixed on the
beautiful woman before him, but his attention feverishly divided
between her and what might be going on in the vestibule behind
him.</p>

<p>In answer to his last threatening words, the lovely Theresia
rejoined, more seriously:</p>

<p>"So as to make sure I do not escape either!" And a flash of
withering anger shot from her dark eyes on the unromantic figure of
her adorer. "Or you, <i>mon ami</i>! You are determined that Mme
Roland's fate shall overtake me, eh? And no doubt you will be
thrilled to the marrow when you see my head fall into your precious
salad-bowl. Will yours follow mine, think you? Or will you prefer
to emulate citizen Roland's more romantic ending?"</p>

<p>Even while she spoke, Tallien had been unable to repress a
shudder.</p>

<p>"Theresia, in heaven's name&mdash;!" he murmured.</p>

<p>"Bah, <i>mon ami</i>! There is no longer a heaven these days.
You and your party have carefully abolished the Hereafter. So,
after you and I have taken our walk up the steps of the
scaffold&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Theresia!"</p>

<p>"Eh, what?" she went on coolly. "Is that not perchance what you
have in contemplation? Moncrif, you say, is an avowed traitor. Has
openly vilified and insulted your demi-god. He has been seen coming
to my apartments. Good! I tell you that he is no longer here. But
let that pass. He is denounced. Good! Sent to the guillotine. Good
again! And Theresia Cabarrus in whose house he tried to seek
refuge, much against her will, goes to the guillotine in his
company. The prospect may please you, <i>mon ami</i>,
because for the moment you are suffering from a senseless attack of
jealousy. But I confess that it does not appeal to me."</p>

<p>The man was silent now; awed against his will. His curiously
restless eyes swept over the graceful apparition before him. Insane
jealousy was fighting a grim fight in his heart with terror for his
beloved. Her argument was a sound one. Even he was bound to admit
that. Powerful though he was in the Convention, his influence was
as nothing compared with that of Robespierre. And he knew his
redoubtable colleague well enough that an insult such as Moncrif
had put upon in the Rue St. Honoré this night would never be
forgiven, neither in the young hot-head himself nor in any of his
friends, adherents, or mere pitying sympathizers.</p>

<p>Theresia Cabarrus was clever enough and quick enough to see that
she had gained one point.</p>

<p>"Come and kiss my hand," she said, with a little sigh of
satisfaction.</p>

<p>This time the man obeyed, without an instant's hesitation.
Already he was down on his knees, repentant and humiliated. She
gave him her small, sandalled foot to kiss. After that, Tallien
became abject.</p>

<p>"You know that I would die for you, Theresia!" he murmured
passionately.</p>

<p>This is the second time to-night that such an assertion had been
made in this room. And both had been made in deadly earnest, whilst
the fair listener had remained equally indifferent to both. And for
the second time to-night, Theresia passed her cool white hand over
the bent head of an ardent worshipper, whilst her lips murmured
vaguely:</p>

<p>"Foolish! Oh, how foolish! Why do men torture themselves, I
wonder, with senseless jealousy?"</p>

<p>Instinctively she turned her small head in the direction of the
passage and the little kitchen, where Bertrand Moncrif had found
temporary and precarious shelter. Self-pity and a kind of fierce
helplessness not untinged with remorse made her eyes appear
resentful and hard.</p>

<p>There, in the stuffy little kitchen at the end of the dark, dank
passage, love in its pure sense, happiness, brief perhaps but
unalloyed, and certainly obscure, lay in wait for her. Here, at her
feet, was security in the present turmoil, power, and a fitting
background for her beauty and her talents. She did not want to lose
Bertrand; indeed, she did not intend to lose him. She sighed a
little regretfully as she thought of his good looks, his
enthusiasm, his selfless ardour. Then she looked down once more on
the narrow shoulders, the lank, colourless hair, the bony hands of
the erstwhile lawyer's clerk to whom she had already promised
marriage, and she shuddered a little when she remembered that those
same hands into which she had promised to place her own and which
now grasped hers in passionate adoration had, of a certainty,
signed the order for those execrable massacres which had for ever
sullied the early days of the Revolution. For a moment&mdash;a
brief one, in truth&mdash;she marvelled if union with such a man
was not too heavy a price to pay for immunity and for power.</p>

<p>But the hesitancy only lasted a few seconds. The next, she had
thrown back her head as if in defiance of the whisperings of
conscience and of heart. She need not lose her youthful lover at
all. He was satisfied with so little! A few kind words here, an
occasional kiss, a promise or two, and he would always remain her
willing slave.</p>

<p>It were foolish indeed, and far, far too late, to give way to
sentiment at this hour, when Tallien's influence in the Convention
was second only to that of Robespierre, whilst Bertrand Moncrif was
a fugitive, a suspect, a poor miserable fanatic, whose
hot-headedness was for ever landing him from one dangerous
situation into another.</p>

<p>So, after indulging in the faintest little sigh of yearning for
the might-have-been, she met her latest adorer's worshipping glance
with coquettish air of womanly submission, which completed his
subjugation, and said lightly:</p>

<p>"And now give me my orders for to-night, <i>mon ami</i>."</p>

<p>She settled herself down more comfortably upon the settee, and
graciously allowed him to sit on a low chair beside her.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>The turbulent little incident was closed. Theresia had her way,
and poor, harassed Tallien succeeded in shutting away in the
innermost recesses of his heart the pangs of jealousy which still
tortured him. His goddess was now all smiles, and the subtle
flattery implied by her preference for him above his many rivals
warmed his atrophied heart and soothed his boundless vanity.</p>

<p>We must accept the verdict of history that Theresia Cabarrus
never loved Tallien. In truth appears to be that what love she was
capable of had undoubtedly been given to Bertrand Moncrif, whom she
would not entirely dismiss from his allegiance, even though she had
at last been driven into promising marriage to the powerful
Terrorist.</p>

<p>It is doubtful if, despite that half-hearted and wholly selfish
love for the young royalist, she had ever intended that he should
be more to her than a slavish worshipper, a friend on whom she
could count for perpetual adoration or mere sentimental dalliance;
but a husband&mdash;never! Certain it is that even Tallien,
influential as he was, was only a pis-aller. The lovely Spaniard,
we make no doubt, would have preferred Robespierre as a future
husband, or, failing him, Louise-Antoine St. Just, but the latter
was deeply enamoured of another woman; and Robespierre was too
cautious, too ambitious, to allow himself to be enmeshed.</p>

<p>So she fell back on Tallien.</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>"Give me my orders for tonight," the lovely woman had said to
her future lord. And he&mdash;a bundle of vanity and
egoism&mdash;was flattered and soothed by this submission, though
he knew in his heart of hearts that it was only pretence.</p>

<p>"You will help me, Theresia?" he pleaded.</p>

<p>She nodded, and asked coldly: "How?"</p>

<p>"You know that Robespierre suspects me," he went on, and
instinctively, at the mere breathing of that awe-inspiring name his
voice sank to a murmur. "Ever since I came back from Bordeaux."</p>

<p>"I know. Your leniency there is attributed to me."</p>

<p>"It was your influence, Theresia&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"That turned you," she broke in coldly, "from a bloodstained
beast into a right-minded justiciary. Do you regret it?"</p>

<p>"No, no!" he protested; "since it gained me your love."</p>

<p>"Could I love a beast of prey?" she retorted. "But if you do not
regret, you are certainly afraid."</p>

<p>"And he had sent me to Bordeaux to punish, not to pardon."</p>

<p>"Then you <i>are</i> afraid!" she insisted. "Has anything
happened?"</p>

<p>"No; only his usual hints&mdash;his vague threats. You know
them."</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"The same," he went on somberly, "that he used ere he struck
Danton."</p>

<p>"Danton was hot-headed. He was too proud to appeal to the
populace who idolized him."</p>

<p>"And I have no popularity to which I can appeal. If Robespierre
strikes at me in the Convention, I am doomed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unless you strike first."</p>

<p>"I have no following. We none of us have. Robespierre sways the
Convention with one word."</p>

<p>"You mean," she broke in more vehemently, "that you are all
cringing cowards&mdash;the abject slaves of one man. Two hundred of
you are longing for this era of bloodshed to cease; two hundred
would stay the pitiless work of the guillotine&mdash;and not one is
plucky enough to cry, 'Halt! It is enough!'"</p>

<p>"The first man who cries 'Halt!' is called a traitor," Tallien
retorted gloomily. "And the guillotine will not rest until
Robespierre himself had said, 'It is enough!'"</p>

<p>"He alone knows what he wants. He alone fears no one," she
exclaimed, almost involuntarily giving grudging admiration where in
truth she felt naught but loathing.</p>

<p>"I would not fear either, Theresia," he protested, and there was
a note of tender reproach in his voice, "if it were not for
you."</p>

<p>"I know that, <i>mon ami</i>," she rejoined with an impatient
little sight. "Well, what do you want me to do?"</p>

<p>He leaned forward in his chair, closer to her, and did not
mark&mdash;poor fool!&mdash;that, as he drew near, she recoiled
ever so slightly from him.</p>

<p>"There are two things," he said insinuatingly, "which you could
do, Theresia, either of which would place Robespierre under such
lasting obligation to you that he would admit us into the inner
circle of his friends, trust us and confide in us as he does in St.
Just or Couthon."</p>

<p>"Trust you, you mean. He never would trust a woman."</p>

<p>"It means the same thing&mdash;security for us both."</p>

<p>"Well?" she rejoined. "What are these two things?"</p>

<p>He paused a moment, appeared to hesitate; then said
resolutely:</p>

<p>"Firstly, there is Bertrand Moncrif...and his
Fatalists&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her face hardened. She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I warned Robespierre about to-night," she said. "I knew that a
lot of young fools meant to cause a fracas in the Rue St. Honoré.
But the whole thing has been a failure, and Robespierre has no use
for failures."</p>

<p>"It need not be a failure&mdash;even yet."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Robespierre will be here directly," he urged, in a whisper
rendered hoarse with excitement. "Bertrand Moncrif is
here&mdash;Why not deliver the young traitor, and earn
Robespierre's gratitude?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" she broke in indignant protest. Then, as she caught the
look of jealous anger which at her obvious agitation suddenly
flared up in his narrow eyes again, she went on with a careless
shrug of her statuesque shoulders: "Bertrand is not here, as I told
you, my friend. So these means of serving your cause are out of my
reach."</p>

<p>"Theresia," he urged, "by deceiving me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By tantalizing me," she broke in harshly, "you do yourself no
good. Let us understand one another, my friend," she went on more
gently. "You wish me to serve you by serving the dictator of
France. And I tell you you'll not gain your ends by taunting
me."</p>

<p>"Theresia, we must make friends with Robespierre! He has the
power; he rules over France. Whilst I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" she retorted with vehemence. "That is where you and your
weak-kneed friends are wrong! You say that Robespierre rules
France. 'Tis not true. It is not Robespierre, the man, who rules;
it is his name! The name of Robespierre has become a fetish, an
idolatry. Before it every head is bent and every courage cowed. It
rules by the fear which it evokes and by the slavery which it
compels under the perpetual threat of death. Believe me," she
insisted, "'tis not Robespierre who rules, but the guillotine which
he wields! And we are all of us helpless&mdash;you and I and your
friends. And all the others who long to see the end of this era of
bloodshed and of revenge, we have got to do as he tells
us&mdash;pile up crime upon crime, massacre upon massacre, and bear
the odium of it all, while he stands aloof in darkness and in
solitude, the brain that guides, whilst you and your party are only
the hands that strike. Oh! the humiliation of it! And if you were
but men, all of you, instead of puppets&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, Theresia, in heaven's name!" Tallien broke in
peremptorily at last. He had vainly tried to pacify her while she
poured forth the vials of her resentment and her contempt. But now
his ears, attuned to sensitiveness by an ever-present danger, had
caught a sound which proceeded from the vestibule&mdash;a sound
which made him shudder&mdash;a footstep&mdash;the opening of a
door&mdash;a voice. "Hush!" he entreated. "Every dumb wall has
ears, these days!"</p>

<p>She broke into a harsh, excited little laugh.</p>

<p>"You are right, my friend," she said under her breath. "What do
I care, after all? What do any of us care now, so long as our necks
are fairly safe upon our shoulders? But I'll not sell Bertrand,"
she added firmly. "If I did it I should despise myself too much and
hate you worse. So tell me quickly what else I can do to propitiate
the ogre!"</p>

<p>"He'll tell you himself," Tallien murmured hurriedly, as the
sounds in the vestibule became more loud and distinctive. "Here
they are! And, in heaven's name, Theresia, remember that our lives
are at that one man's mercy!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>Chapter X&mdash;The Grim Idol that
the World Adores</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>Theresia, being a woman, was necessarily the more accomplished
actor. While Tallien retired into a gloomy corner of the room,
vainly trying to conceal his agitation, she rose quite serene in
order to greet her visitors.</p>

<p>Pepita had just admitted into her mistress's apartments a
singular group, composed of two able-bodied men supporting a
palsied one. One of the former was St. Just, one of the most
romantic figures of the Revolutionary period, the confidant and
intimate friend of Robespierre and own cousin to Armand St. Just
and to the beautiful Marguerite, who had married the fastidious
English milord, Sir Percy Blakeney. The other was Chauvelin, at one
time one of the most influential members of the Committee of Public
Safety, now little more than a hanger-on of Robespierre's party. A
man of no account, to whom not even Tallien and his colleagues
thought it worth while to pay their court. The palsied man was
Couthon, despite his crimes an almost pathetic figure in his
helplessness, after his friends had deposited him in an armchair
and wrapped a rug around his knees. The carrying chair in which he
spent the greater part of his life had been left down below in the
concierge's lodge, and St. Just and Chauvelin had carried him up
the three flights of stairs to citoyenne Cabarrus's apartment.</p>

<p>Close behind these three men came Robespierre.</p>

<p>Heavens! if a thunderbolt had fallen from the skies on that
night of the 26th of April, 1794, and destroyed house No. 22 in the
Rue Villedot, with all those who were in it, what a torrent of
blood would have been stemmed, what horrors averted, what misery
forefended!</p>

<p>But nothing untoward happened. The four men who sat that night
and well into the small hours of the morning in the dingy
apartment, occupied for the present by the beautiful Cabarrus, were
allowed by inscrutable Providence to discuss their nefarious
designs unchecked.</p>

<p>In truth, there was no discussion. One man dominated the small
assembly, even though he sat for the most part silent and
apparently self-absorbed, wrapped in that taciturnity and even
occasional somnolence which seemed to have become a pose with him
of late. He sat on a high chair, prim and upright. Immaculately
dressed in blue cloth coat and white breeches, with clean linene at
throat and wrist, his hair neatly tied back with a black silk bow,
his nails polished, his shoes free from mud, he presented a marked
contrast to the ill-conditioned appearance of those other products
of revolutionary ideals.</p>

<p>St. Just, on the other hand&mdash;young, handsome, a brilliant
talker and convinced enthusiast&mdash;was only too willing to air
his compelling eloquence, was in effect the mouthpiece of the great
man as he was his confidant and his right hand. He had acquired in
the camps which he so frequently visited a breezy, dictatorial
manner that pleased his friends and irritated Tallien and his
clique, more especially when sententious phrases fell from his lips
which were obviously the echo of some of Robespierre's former
speeches in the Convention.</p>

<p>Then there was Couthon, sarcastic and contemptuous, delighting
to tease Tallien and to affect a truculent manner, which brought
abject flattery from the other's lips.</p>

<p>St. Just the fiery young demagogue, and Couthon the
half-paralysed enthusiast, were known to be pushing their leader
toward the proclamation of a triumvirate, with Robespierre as chief
dictator and themselves as his two hands; and it amused the
helpless cripple to see just how far the obsequiousness of Tallien
and his colleagues would go in subscribing to so monstrous a
project.</p>

<p>As for Chauvelin, he said very little, and the deference
wherewith he listened to the others, the occasional unctuous words
which he let fall, bore testimony to the humiliating subservience
to which he had sunk.</p>

<p>And the beautiful Theresia, presiding over the small assembly
like a goddess who listens to the prattle of men, sat for the most
part quite still, on the one dainty piece of furniture of which her
dingy apartment boasted. She was careful to sit so that the rosy
glow of the lamp fell on her in the direction most becoming to her
attitude. From time to time she threw in a word; but all the while
her whole attention was concentrated on what was said. At her
future husband's fulsome words of flattery, at his obvious
cowardice before the popular idol and his cringing abjectness, a
faint smile of contempt would now and then force itself up to her
lips. But she neither reproved nor encouraged him. And when
Robespierre appeared to be flattered by Tallien's obsequiousness
she even gave a little sigh of satisfaction.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>St. Just, now as always the mouthpiece of his friend, was the
first to give a serious turn to the conversation. Compliments,
flatteries, had gone their round; platitudes, grandiloquent phrases
on the subject of country, intellectual revolution, liberty,
purity, and so on, had been spouted with varying eloquence. The
fraternal suppers had been alluded to with servile eulogy of the
giant brain who had conceived the project.</p>

<p>Then it was that St. Just broke into a euphemistic account of
the disorderly scene in the Rue St. Honoré.</p>

<p>Theresia Cabarrus, roused from her queen-like indifference, at
once became interested.</p>

<p>"The young traitor!" she exclaimed, with a great show of
indignation. "Who was he? What was he like?"</p>

<p>Couthon gave quite a minute description of Bertrand, and
accurate one, too. He had faced the blasphemer&mdash;thus was he
called by this compact group of devotees and sycophants&mdash;for
fully five minutes, and despite the flickering and deceptive light,
had studied his features, distorted by fury and hate, and was quite
sure that he would know them again.</p>

<p>Theresia listened eagerly, caught every inflection of the voices
as they discussed the strange events that followed. The keenest
observer there could not have detected the slightest agitation in
her large, velvety eyes&mdash;not even when they met Robespierre's
coldly inquiring gaze. No one&mdash;not even Tallien&mdash;could
have guessed what an effort it cost her to appear unconcerned, when
all the while she was straining every sense in the direction of the
small kitchen at the end of the passage, where the much-discussed
Bertrand was still lying concealed.</p>

<p>However, the certainty that Robespierre's spies and those of the
Committees had apparently lost complete track of Moncrif, did much
to restore her assurance, and her gaiety became after awhile
somewhat more real.</p>

<p>At one time she turned boldly to Tallien.</p>

<p>"You were there, too, citizen," she said provokingly. "Did
<i>you</i> not recognise any of the traitors?"</p>

<p>Tallien stammered out an evasive answer, implored her with a
look not to taunt him and not to play like a thoughtless child
within sight and hearing of a man-eating tiger. Thereisa's
dalliance with the young and handsome Bertrand must in truth be
known to Robespierre's army of spies, and
he&mdash;Tallien&mdash;was not altogether convinced that the fair
Spaniard, despite her assurances to the contrary, was not
harbouring Moncrif in her apartment even now.</p>

<p>Therefore he would not meet her tantalizing glance; and she,
delighted to tease, threw herself with greater zest than before
into the discussion, amused to see sober Tallien, whom in her
innermost heart she despised, enduring tortures of
apprehension.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she exclaimed, apparently enraptured by St. Just's glowing
account of the occurrence, "what would I not give to have seen it
all! In truth, we do not often get such thrilling incidents every
day in this dull and dreary Paris. The death-carts with their load
of simpering aristos have ceased to entertain us. But the drama in
the Rue St. Honoré! à la bonne heure! What a palpitating
scene!"</p>

<p>"Especially," added Couthon, "the spiriting away of the company
of traitors through the agency of that mysterious giant, who some
aver was just a coal-heaver named Rateau, well known to half the
night-birds of the city as an asthmatic reprobate; whilst others
vow that he was&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Name him not, friend Couthon," St. Just broke in with a
sarcastic chuckle. "I pray thee, spare the feelings of citizen
Chauvelin." And his bold, provoking eyes shot a glance of cool
irony on the unfortunate victim of his taunt.</p>

<p>Chauvelin made no retort, pressed his thin lips more tightly
together as if to smother any incipient expression of the
resentment which he felt. Instinctively his glance sought those of
Robespierre, who sat by, still apparently disinterested and
impassive, with head bent and arms crossed over his narrow chest.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes!" here interposed Tallien unctuously. "Citizen
Chauvelin has had one or two opportunities of measuring his prowess
against that of the mysterious Englishman; but we are told that,
despite his talents, he has met with no success in that
direction."</p>

<p>"Do not tease our modest friend Chauvelin, I pray you, citizen,"
Theresia broke in gaily. "The Scarlet Pimpernel&mdash;that is the
name of the mysterious Englishman, is it not?&mdash;is far more
elusive and a thousand times more resourceful and daring than any
mere man can possibly conceive. 'Tis woman's wits that will bring
him to his knees one day. You can take my word for that!"</p>

<p>"<i>Your</i> wits, citoyenne?"</p>

<p>Robespierre had spoken. It was the first time, since the
discussion had turned on the present subject, that he had opened
his lips. All eyes were at once reverentially turned to him. His
own, cold and sarcastic, were fixed upon Theresia Cabarrus.</p>

<p>She returned his glance with provoking coolness, shrugged her
splendid shoulders, and retorted airily:</p>

<p>"Oh, you want a woman with some talent as a sleuthhound&mdash;a
female counterpart of citizen Chauvelin. I have no genius in that
direction."</p>

<p>"Why not?" Robespierre went on drily. "You, fair citoyenne,
would be well qualified to deal with the Scarlet Pimpernel, seeing
that your adorer, Bertrand Moncrif, appears to be a protégé of the
mysterious League."</p>

<p>At this taunt, uttered by the dictator with deliberate emphasis,
like one who knows what he is talking about, Tallien gave a gasp
and his sallow cheeks became the colour of lead. But Theresia
placed her cool, reassuring hand upon his.</p>

<p>"Bertrand Moncrif," she said serenely, "is no adorer of mine. He
foreswore his allegiance to me on the day that I plighted my troth
to citizen Tallien."</p>

<p>"That is as may be," Robespierre retorted coldly. "But he
certainly was the leader of the gang of traitors whom that
meddlesome English rabble chose to snatch away to-night from the
vengeance of a justly incensed populace."</p>

<p>"How do you know that, citizen Robespierre?" Theresia asked. She
was still maintaining an outwardly calm attitude; her voice was
apparently quite steady, her glance absolutely serene. Only
Tallien's keen perceptions were able to note the almost wax-like
pallor which had spread over her cheeks and the strained,
high-pitched tone of her usually mellow voice. "Why do you suppose,
citizen," she insisted, "that Bertrand Moncrif had anything to do
with the fracas to-night? Methought he had emigrated to
England&mdash;or somewhere," she added airily, "after&mdash;after I
gave him his definite congé."</p>

<p>"Did you think that, citoyenne?" Robespierre rejoined with a wry
smile. "Then let me tell you that you are under a misapprehension.
Moncrif, the traitor, was the leader of the gang that tried to
rouse the people against me to-night. You ask me how I know it?" he
added icily. "Well, I saw him&mdash;that is all!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Theresia, in well-played mild astonishment. "You
say Bertrand Moncrif, citizen? He is in Paris, then?"</p>

<p>"Seemingly."</p>

<p>"Strange, he never came to see me!"</p>

<p>"Strange, indeed!"</p>

<p>"What does he look like? Some people have told me that he is
getting fat."</p>

<p>The discussion had now resolved itself into a duel between these
two: the ruthless dictator, sure of his power, and the beautiful
woman, conscious of hers. The atmosphere of the drabbily furnished
room had became electrical. Every one felt it. Every man
instinctively held his breath, conscious of the quickening of his
pulses, of the accelerated beating of his heart.</p>

<p>Both the duellists appeared perfectly calm. Of the two, in
truth, Robespierre appeared the most moved. His staccato voice, the
drumming of his pointed fingers upon the arms of his chair,
suggested that the banter of the beautiful Theresia was getting on
his nerves. It was like the lashing of a puma's tail, the
irritation of a tempter unaccustomed to being provoked, and
Theresia was clever enough&mdash;above all, woman enough&mdash;to
note that, since the dictator was moved, he could not be perfectly
sure of his ground. He would not display this secret irritation if
by a word he could confound his beautiful adversary, and openly
threaten where now he only insinuated.</p>

<p>"He saw Bertrand in the Rue St. Honoré," was the sum total of
her quick reasoning; "but does not know that he is here. I wonder
what it is he does want!" came as an afterthought.</p>

<p>The one that really suffered throughout, and suffered acutely,
was Tallien. He would have given all that he possessed to know for
a certainty that Bertrand Moncrif was no longer in the house.
Surely Theresia would not be foolhardy enough to provoke the
powerful dictator into one of those paroxysms of spiteful fury for
which he was notorious&mdash;fury wherein he might be capable of
anything&mdash;insulting his hostess, setting his spies to search
her apartments for a traitor if he suspected one of lying hidden
away somewhere. In truth, Tallien, trembling for his beloved, was
ready to swoon. How marvellous she was! how serene! While men held
their breath before the inexorable despot, she went on teasing the
tiger, even though he had already begun to snarl.</p>

<p>"I entreat you, citizen Robespierre," she said, with a pout, "to
tell me if Bertrand Moncrif has grown fat."</p>

<p>"That I cannot tell you, citoyenne," Robespierre replied curtly.
"Having recognized my enemy, I no longer paid heed to him. My
attention was arrested by his rescuer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That elusive Scarlet Pimpernel," she broke in gaily.
"Unrecognizable to all save to citizen Robespierre, under the
disguise of an asthmatic gossoon. Ah, would I had been there!"</p>

<p>"I would you had, citoyenne," he retorted. "You would have
realized that to refuse your help to unmask an abominable spy after
such an episode is tantamount to treason."</p>

<p>Her gaiety dropped from her like a mantle. In a moment she was
serious, puzzled. A frown appeared between her brows. Her dark eyes
flashed, rapidly inquiring, suspicious, fearful, upon
Robespierre.</p>

<p>"To refuse my help?" she asked slowly. "My help in unmasking a
spy? I do not understand."</p>

<p>She looked from one man to the other. Chauvelin was the only one
who would not meet her gaze. No, not the only one. Tallien, too,
appeared absorbed in contemplating his finger nails.</p>

<p>"Citizen Tallien," she queried harshly. "What does this
mean?"</p>

<p>"It means just what I said," Robespierre intervene coldly. "That
abominable English spy has fooled us all. You said yourself that
'tis a woman's wit that will bring that elusive adventurer to his
knees one day. Why not yours?"</p>

<p>Theresia gave no immediate reply. She was meditating. Here,
then, was this other means to her hand, whereby she was to
propitiate the man-eating tiger, turn his snarl into a purr, obtain
immunity for herself and her future lord, but what a prospect!</p>

<p>"I fear me, citizen Robespierre," she said after awhile, "that
you overestimate the keenness of my wits."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" he retorted drily.</p>

<p>And St. Just, ever the echo of his friend's unspoken words,
added with a great show of gallantry:</p>

<p>"The citoyenne Cabarrus, even from her prison in Bordeaux,
succeeded in snaring our friend Tallien, and making him the slave
of her beauty."</p>

<p>"Then why not the Scarlet Pimpernel?" was Couthon's simple
conclusion.</p>

<p>"The Scarlet Pimpernel!" Theresia exclaimed with a shrug of her
handsome shoulders. "The Scarlet Pimpernel, forsooth! Why, meseems
that no one knows who he is! Just now you all affirmed that he was
a coal-heaver named Rateau. I cannot make love to a coal-heaver,
can I?"</p>

<p>"Citizen Chauvelin knows who the Scarlet Pimpernel is," Couthon
went on deliberately. "He will put you on the right track. All that
we want is that he should be at your feet. It is so easy for the
citoyenne Cabarrus to accomplish that."</p>

<p>"But if you know who he is," she urged, "why do you need my
help?"</p>

<p>"Because," St. Just replied, "the moment that he lands in France
he sheds his identity, as a man would a coat. Here, there,
everywhere&mdash;he is more elusive than a ghost, for a ghost is
always the same, whilst the Scarlet Pimpernel is never twice alike.
A coal-heaver one day; a prince of dandies the next. He has
lodgings in every quarter of Paris and quits them at a moment's
notice. He has confederates everywhere: concierges,
cabaret-keepers, soldiers, vagabonds. He has been a public
letter-writer, a sergeant of the National Guard, a rogue, a thief!
'Tis only in England that he is always the same, and citizen
Chauvelin can identify him there. 'Tis there that you can see him,
citoyenne, there that you can spread your nets for him; from thence
that you can lure him to France in your train, like you lured
citizen Tallien to obey your every whim in Bordeaux. Once a man
hath fallen a victim to the charms of beautiful Theresia Cabarrus,"
added the young demagogue gallantly, "she need only to beckon and
he will follow, as does citizen Tallien, as did Bertrand Moncrif,
as do so many others. Bring the Scarlet Pimpernel to your feet,
here in Pairs, citoyenne, and we will do the rest."</p>

<p>While his young devotee spoke thus vehemently, Robespierre had
relapsed into his usual pose of affected detachment. His head was
bent, his arms were folded across his chest. He appeared to be
asleep. When St. Just paused, Theresia waiting awhile, her dark
eyes fixed on the great man who had conceived this monstrous
project. Monstrous, because of the treachery that it demanded.</p>

<p>Theresia Cabarrus had in truth identified herself with the
Revolutionary government. She had promised to marry Tallien, who
outwardly at least was as bloodthirsty and ruthless as was
Robespierre himself; but she was a woman and not a demon. She had
refused to sell Bertrand Moncrif in order to pander to Tallien's
fear of Robespierre. To entice a man&mdash;whoever he
was&mdash;into making love to her, and then to betray him to his
death, was in itself an abhorrent idea. What she might do if actual
danger of death threatened her, she did not know. No human soul can
with certainty say, "I would not do this or that, under any
circumstances whatever!" Circumstance and impulse are the only two
forces that create cowards or heroes. Principles, will-power,
virtue, are really subservient to those two. If they prove the
stronger, everything in man must yield to them.</p>

<p>And Theresia Cabarrus had not yet been tried by force of
circumstance or driven by force of impulse. Self-preservation was
her dominant law, and she had not yet been in actual fear of
death.</p>

<p>This is not a justification on the part of this veracious
chronicle of Theresia's subsequent actions; it is an explanation.
Faced with this demand upon her on the part of the most powerful
despot in France, she hesitated, even though she did not altogether
dare to refuse. Womanlike, she tried to temporize.</p>

<p>She appeared puzzled; frowned. Then asked vaguely:</p>

<p>"Is it then that you wish me to go to England?"</p>

<p>St. Just nodded.</p>

<p>"But," she continued, in the same indeterminate manner, "meseems
that you talk very glibly of my&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;my
proposed dalliance with the mysterious Englishman. Suppose
he&mdash;he does not respond?"</p>

<p>"Impossible!" Couthon broke in quickly.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she protested. "Impossible? Englishmen are known to be
prudish&mdash;moral&mdash;what? And if the man is
married&mdash;what then?"</p>

<p>"The citoyenne Cabarrus underrates her powers," St. Just
riposted glibly.</p>

<p>"Theresia, I entreat!" Tallien put in dolefully.</p>

<p>He felt that the interview, from which he had hoped so much, was
proving a failure&mdash;nay, worse! For he realized that
Robespierre, thwarted in this desire, would bitterly resent
Theresia's positive refusal to help him.</p>

<p>"Eh, what?" she riposted lightly. "And it is you, citizen
Tallien, who would push me into this erotic adventure? I' faith,
your trust in me is highly flattering! Have you not thought that in
the process I might fall in love with the Scarlet Pimpernel myself?
He is young, they say, handsome, adventurous; and I am to try and
capture his fancy...the butterfly is to dance around the
flame...No, no! I am too much afraid that I may singe my
wings!"</p>

<p>"Does that mean," Robespierre put in coldly, "that you refuse us
your help, citoyenne Cabarrus?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I refuse," she replied calmly. "The project does not
please me, I confess&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not even if we guaranteed immunity to your lover, Bertrand
Moncrif?"</p>

<p>She gave a slight shudder. Her lips felt dry, and she passed her
tongue rapidly over them.</p>

<p>"I have no lover, except citizen Tallien," she said steadily,
and placed her fingers, which had suddenly become ice-cold, upon
the clasped hands of her future lord. Then she rose, thereby giving
the signal for the breaking-up of the little party.</p>

<p>In truth, she knew as well as Tallien that the meeting had been
a failure. Tallien was looking sallow and terribly worried.
Robespierre, taciturn and sullen, gave her one threatening glance
before he took his leave.</p>

<p>"You know, citoyenne," he said coldly, "that the nation has
means at its disposal for compelling its citizens to do their
duty."</p>

<p>"Ah, bah!" retorted the fair Spaniard, shrugging her shoulders.
"I am not a citizen of France. And even your unerring Public
Prosecutor would find it difficult to frame an accusation against
me."</p>

<p>Again she laughed, determined to appear gay and inconsequent
through it all.</p>

<p>"Think how the accusation would sound, citizen Robespierre!" she
went on mockingly. "'The citoyenne Cabarrus, for refusing to make
amorous overtures to the mysterious Englishman known as the Scarlet
Pimpernel, and for refusing to administer a love-philtre to him as
prepared by Mother Théot at the bidding of citizen Robespierre!'
Confess! Confess!" she added, and her rippling laugh had a genuine
note of merriment in it at last, "that we none of us would survive
such ridicule!"</p>

<p>Theresia Cabarrus was a clever woman, and by speaking the word
"ridicule," she had touched the one weak chink in the tyrant's
armour. But it is not always safe to prod a tiger, even with a
child's cane, or even from behind protecting bars. Tallien knew
this well enough. He was on tenterhooks, longing to see the others
depart so that he might throw himself once again at Theresia's feet
and implore her to obey the despot's commands.</p>

<p>But Theresia appeared unwilling to give him such another chance.
She professed intense fatigue, bade him "good night" with such
obvious finality, that he dared not outstay his welcome. A few
moments later they had all gone. Their gracious hostess accompanied
them to the door, since Pepita had by this time certainly gone to
bed. The little procession was formed, with St. Just and Chauvelin
supporting their palsied comrade, Robespierre detached and silent,
and finally Tallien, whose last appealing look to his beloved would
have melted a heart of stone.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>Chapter XI&mdash;Strange
Happenings</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>Now the dingy little apartment in the Rue Villedot was silent
and dark. The elegant little lamp with its rose-coloured shade was
turned down in the withdrawing-room, leaving only a tiny glimmer of
light, which failed to dispel the gloom around. The nocturnal
visitors had departed more than a quarter of an hour ago;
nevertheless, the beautiful hostess had not yet gone to bed. In
fact, she had hardly moved since she bade the final adieu to her
timorous lover. The enforced gaiety of the last few moments still
sat like a mask upon her face. All that she had done was to sink
with a sigh of weariness upon the settee.</p>

<p>And there she remained, with neck craned forward, listening,
straining every nerve to listen, even though the heavy, measured
footsteps of the five men had long since ceased to echo up and down
the stone passages and stairs. Her foot, in its quaint small
sandal, beat now and then an impatient tattoo upon the threadbare
carpet. Her eyes at intervals cast anxious looks upon the
old-fashioned clock above the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>It struck half-past two. Whereupon Theresia rose and went out
into the vestibule. Here a tallow candle flickered faintly in its
pewter sconce and emitted an evil-smelling smoke, which rose in
spirals to the blackened ceiling.</p>

<p>Theresia paused, glanced inquiringly down the narrow passage
which gave access to the little kitchen beyond. Between the kitchen
and the corner of the vestibule where she was standing, two doors
gave on the passage: her bedroom, and that of her maid Pepita.
Theresia was vividly conscious of the strange silence which reigned
in the whole apartment. The passage was pitch dark save at its
farthest end, where a tiny ray of light found its way underneath
the kitchen door.</p>

<p>The silence was oppressive, almost terrifying. In a hoarse,
anxious voice, Theresia called:</p>

<p>"Pepita!"</p>

<p>But there came no answer. Pepita apparently had gone to bed, was
fast asleep by now. But what had become of Bertrand?</p>

<p>Full of vague misgivings, her nerves tingling with a nameless
fear, Theresia picked up the candle and tiptoed down the passage.
Outside Pepita's door she paused and listened. Her large dark eyes
looked weird in their expression of puzzlement and of awe, the
flickering light of the candle throwing gleams of orange-coloured
lights into the depths of the widely dilated pupils.</p>

<p>"Pepita!" she called; and somehow the sound of her own voice
added to her terror. Strange that she should be frightened like
this in her own familiar apartment, and with a faithful, sturdy
maid sleeping the other side of this thin partition wall!</p>

<p>"Pepita!" Theresia's voice was shaking. She tried to open the
door, but it was locked. Why had Pepita, contrary to her habit,
locked herself in? Had she, too, been a prey to some unexplainable
panic? Theresia knocked against the door, rattled the handle in its
socket, called more loudly and more insistently, "Pepita!" and,
receiving no reply, fell, half-swooning with fear, against the
partition wall, whilst the candle slipped out of her trembling
grasp and fell with a clatter to the ground.</p>

<p>She was now in complete darkness, with senses reeling and brain
paralysed. How long she remained thus, in a state bordering on
collapse, she did not know; probably not more than a minute or so.
Consciousness returned quickly, and with it the cold sweat of an
abject fear; for through this returning consciousness she had
perceived a groan issuing from behind the locked door. But her
knees were still shaking; she felt unable to move.</p>

<p>"Pepita!" she called again; and to her own ears her voice
sounded hoarse and muffled. Straining her ears and holding her
breath, she once more caught the sound of a smothered groan.</p>

<p>Whereupon, driven into action by the obvious distress of her
maid, Theresia recovered a certain measure of self-control. Pulling
herself vigorously together, she began by groping for the candle
which had dropped out of her hand a while ago. Even as she stooped
down for this she contrived to say in a moderately clear and firm
voice:</p>

<p>"Courage, Pepita! I'll find the light and come back." Then she
added: "Are you unable to unlock the door?"</p>

<p>To this, however, she received no reply save another muffled
groan.</p>

<p>Theresia now was on her hands and knees, groping for the
candlestick. Then a strange thing happened. Her hands, as they
wandered vaguely along the flagged floor, encountered a small
object, which proved to be a key. In an instant she was on her feet
again, her fingers running over the door until they encountered the
keyhole. Into this she succeeded, after further groping, in
inserting the key; it fitted and turned the lock. She pushed open
the door, and remained paralysed with surprise upon the
threshold.</p>

<p>Pepita was reclining in an arm-chair, her hands tied behind her,
a woollen shawl wound loosely around her mouth. In a distant corner
of the room, a small oil-lamp, turned very low, cast a glimmer of
light upon the scene. For Theresia to run to the pinioned woman and
undo the bonds that held her was but the work of a few seconds.</p>

<p>"Pepita!" she cried. "What in heaven's name has happened?"</p>

<p>The woman seemed not much the worse for her enforced duress. She
groaned, and even swore under her breath, and indeed appeared more
dazed than hurt. Theresia, impatient and excited, had to shake her
more than once vigorously by the shoulder before she was able to
gather her scattered wits together.</p>

<p>"Where is M. Bertrand?" Theresia asked repeatedly, ere she got a
reply from her bewildered maid.</p>

<p>At last Pepita was able to speak.</p>

<p>"In very truth, Madame," she said slowly, "I do not know."</p>

<p>"How do you mean, you do not know?" Theresia queried, with a
deepened frown.</p>

<p>"Just what I saw, my pigeon," Pepita retorted with marked
acerbity. "You ask me what has happened, and I say I do not know.
You want to know what has become of M. Bertrand. Then go and look
for yourself. When I last saw him, he was in the kitchen, unfit to
move, the poor cabbage!"</p>

<p>"But, Pepita," Theresia insisted, and stamped her foot with
impatience, "you must know how you came to be sitting here,
pinioned and muffled. Who did it? Who has been here? God preserve
the woman, will she never speak!"</p>

<p>Pepita by now had fully recovered her senses. She had struggled
to her feet, and went to take up the lamp, then led the way toward
the door, apparently intent on finding out for herself what had
become of M. Bertrand and in no way sharing her mistress's
unreasoning terror. She halted on the threshold and turned to
Theresia, who quite mechanically started to follow her.</p>

<p>"M. Bertrand was sitting in the arm-chair in the kitchen," she
said simply. "I was arranging a cushion for his head, to make him
more comfortable, when suddenly a shawl was flung over my head
without the slightest warning. I had seen nothing; I had not heard
the merest sound. And I had not the time to utter a scream before I
was muffled up in the shawl. Then I was lifted off the ground as if
I were a sack of feathers, and I just remember smelling something
acrid which made my head spin round and round. But I remember
nothing more after until I heard voices in the vestibule when thy
guests were going away. Then I heard thy voice and tried to make
thee hear mine. And that is all!"</p>

<p>"When did that happen, Pepita?"</p>

<p>"Soon after the last of thy guests had arrived. I remember I
looked at the clock. It must have been half an hour after
midnight."</p>

<p>While the woman spoke, Theresia had remained standing in the
middle of the room, looking in the gloom like an elfin apparition,
with her clinging, diaphanous draperies. A frown of deep puzzlement
lay between her brows and her lips were tightly pressed together as
if in wrath; but she said nothing more, and when Pepita, lamp in
hand, went out of the room, she followed.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>When, the kitchen door being opened, that room was found to be
empty, Theresia was no longer surprised. Somehow she had expected
this. She knew that Bertrand would be gone. The windows of the
kitchen gave on the ubiquitous wrought-iron balcony, as did all the
other windows of the apartment. That those windows were unfastened,
had only been pushed to from the outside, appeared to her as a
matter of course. It was not Bertrand who had thrown the shawl over
Pepita's head; therefore some one had come in from the outside and
had kidnapped Bertrand&mdash;some one who was peculiarly bold and
daring. He had not come in from the balcony and through the window,
because the latter had been fastened as usual by Pepita much
earlier in the evening. No! He had gone that way, taking Bertrand
with him; but he must have entered the place in some other
mysterious manner, like a disembodied sprite bent on mischief or
mystery.</p>

<p>Whilst Pepita fumbled and grumbled, Theresia started on a tour
of inspection. Still deeply puzzled, she was no longer afraid. With
Pepita to speak and the lamps all turned on, her habitual courage
and self-possession had quickly returned to her. She had no belief
in the supernatural. Her materialistic, entirely rational mind at
once rejected the supposition, hinted at by Pepita, that magical
powers had been at work to take Bertrand Moncrif to a place of
safety.</p>

<p>Something was going on in her brain, certain theories, guesses,
conjectures, which she was passionately eager to set at rest. Nor
did it take her long. Candle in hand, she had gone round to
explore. No sooner had she entered her own bedroom than the
solution of the mystery lay revealed before her, in a shutter,
forced open from the outside, a broken pane of glass which had
allowed a hand to creep in and surreptitiously turn the handle of
the tall French window to allow of easy ingress. It had been
quickly and cleverly done; the splinters of glass had made no noise
as they fell upon the carpet. But for the disappearance of
Bertrand, the circumstances suggested a nimble housebreaker rather
than a benevolent agency for the rescue of young rashlings in
distress.</p>

<p>The frown of puzzlement deepened on Theresia Cabarrus's brow,
and her mobile mouth with the perfectly arched if somewhat thin
lips expressed a kind of feline anger, whilst the hand that held
the pewter candlestick trembled perceptibly.</p>

<p>Pepita's astonishment expressed itself by sundry exclamations:
"Name of a name!" and "Is it possible?" The explanation of the
mystery had loosened her tongue, and while she set stolidly to work
to clear up the debris of glass in her mistress's bedroom, she
allowed free rein to her indignation against the impudent marauder,
who in doubt had only been foiled in his attempt at wholesale
robbery by some lucky circumstance which would presently come to
light.</p>

<p>The worthy old peasant absolutely refused to connect the
departure of M. Bertrand with so obvious an attempt at
housebreaking.</p>

<p>"M. Bertrand was determined to go, the poor cabbage!" she said
decisively; "since thou didst make him understand that his staying
here was a danger to the front door whilst thou wast engaged in
conversation with that pack of murderers, whom may the good God
punish one of these days!"</p>

<p>From which remark we may gather that Pepita had not imbibed
revolutionary ideals with the air of her native Andalusia.</p>

<p>Theresia Cabarrus, wearied beyond endurance by all the events of
this night, as well as by her old servant's incessant gabble,
finally sent her, still muttering and grumbling, to bed.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>Chapter XII&mdash;Chauvelin</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>Theresia had opposed a stern refusal to Pepita's request that
she might put her mistress to bed before she herself went to rest.
She did not want to go to bed: she wanted to think, and now that
that peculiar air of mystery, that silence and semi-darkness no
longer held their gruesome sway in her apartment, she did not feel
afraid.</p>

<p>Pepita went to bed. For awhile, Theresia could hear her moving
about, with ponderous, shuffling footsteps; then, presently
everything was still. The clock of old St. Roch struck three. Not
much more than half an hour had gone by since her guests had been
departed. To Theresia it seemed like an infinity of time. The sense
of a baffling mystery being at work around her had roused her ire
and killed all latent fear.</p>

<p>But what was the mystery?</p>

<p>And was there a mystery at all? Or was Pepita's rational
explanation of the occurrence of this night the right one after
all?</p>

<p>Citoyenne Cabarrus, unable to sit still, wandered up and down
the passage, in and out of the kitchen; in and out of her bedroom,
and thence into the vestibule. Then back again. At one moment, when
standing in the vestibule, she thought she heard some one moving on
the landing outside the front door. Her heart beat a little more
rapidly, but she was not afraid. She did not believe in
housebreakers and she felt that Pepita, who was a very light
sleeper, was well within call.</p>

<p>So she went to the front door and opened it. The quick cry which
she gave was one of surprise rather than of fear. In her belated
visitor she had recognized citizen Chauvelin; and somehow, by a
vague process of reasoning, his presence just at this moment seemed
quite rational&mdash;in keeping with the unsolved mystery that was
so baffling to the fair Theresia.</p>

<p>"May I come in, citoyenne?" Chauvelin said in a whisper. "It is
late, I know; but there is urgency."</p>

<p>He was standing on the threshold, and she, a few paces away from
him in the vestibule. The candle, which now burned low in its
socket, was behind her. Its light touched with a weird, flickering
glow on the pale face of the once noted Terrorist, with its pale
eyes and sharply hooked nose, which gave him the air of a gaunt
bird of prey.</p>

<p>"It is late," she murmured vaguely. "What do you want?"</p>

<p>"Something has happened," he replied, still speaking below his
breath. "Something which concerns you. And, before speaking of it
to citizen Robespierre&mdash;"</p>

<p>At the dread name Theresia stepped farther back into the
vestibule.</p>

<p>"Enter!" she said curtly.</p>

<p>He came in, and she closed the door carefully behind him. Then
she led the way into the withdrawing room and turned up the wick of
the lamp under its rosy shade. She sat down and motioned to him to
do the same.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked.</p>

<p>Before replying, Chauvelin's finger and thumb&mdash;thin and
pointed like the talons of a vulture&mdash;went fumbling in the
pocket of his waistcoat. From it he extracted a small piece of
neatly folded paper.</p>

<p>"When we left your apartment, citoyenne&mdash;my friend St. Just
and I supporting poor palsied Couthon, and Robespierre following
close behind us&mdash;I spied this scrap of paper, which St. Just's
careless foot had just kicked to one side when he was stepping
across the threshold. Some unknown hand must have insinuated it
underneath the door. Now, I never despise stray bits of paper. I
have had so many through my hands that proved after examination to
be of paramount importance. So, whilst the others were busy with
their own affairs I, unseen by them, had already stooped and picked
the paper up."</p>

<p>He paused for a moment or two, then, satisfied that he held the
beautiful woman's undivided attention, he went on in his habitual
dry, urbane monotone:</p>

<p>"Now, though I was quite sure in my own mind, citoyenne, that
this billet-doux was intended for your fair hands, I felt that, as
its finder, I had some sort of lien upon it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To the point, citizen, I pray you!" Theresia broke in harshly,
tried by a show of impatience and of fatigue to hide the anxiety
which had once more taken possession of her heart. "You found a
letter addressed to me; you read it. As you have brought it here, I
presume that you wish me to know its contents. So get on, man, get
on!" she added more vehemently. "It is not at three in the morning
that one cares for dalliance."</p>

<p>By way of reply, Chauvelin slowly unfolded the note and began to
read:</p>

<p>"'Bertrand Moncrif is a young fool, but he is too good to be the
plaything of a sleek black pantheress, however beautiful she might
be. So I am taking him away to England where, in the arms of his
long-suffering and loyal sweetheart, he will soon forget the brief
madness which so nearly landed him on the guillotine and made of
him a tool to serve the selfish whims of Theresia Cabarrus.'"</p>

<p>Theresia had listened to the brief, enigmatic epistle without
displaying the slightest sign of emotion or surprise. Now, when
Chauvelin had finished reading, and with his strange, dry smile had
handed her the tiny note, she took it and for awhile contemplated
it in silence, her face perfectly placid save for a curious and
ominous contraction of the brows and a screwing-up of the fine
eyes, which gave her a curious, snake-like expression.</p>

<p>"You know, of course, citoyenne," Chauvelin said after awhile,
"who the writer of this&mdash;shall we say?&mdash;impudent epistle
happens to be?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"The man," he went on placidly, "who goes by the name of the
Scarlet Pimpernel. The impudent English adventurer whom citizen
Robespierre has asked <i>you</i>, citoyenne, to lure into the net
which we may spread for him."</p>

<p>Still Theresia was silent. She did not look at Chauvelin, but
kept her eyes fixed upon the scrap of paper, which she had folded
into a long, narrow ribbon and was twining in and out between her
fingers.</p>

<p>"A while ago, citoyenne," Chauvelin continued, "in this very
room, you refused to lend us a helping hand."</p>

<p>Still no reply from Theresia. She had just smoothed out the
mysterious epistle, carefully folded it into four, and was in the
act of slipping it into the bosom of her gown. Chauvelin waited
quite patiently. He was accustomed to waiting, and patience was an
integral part of his stock in trade. Opportunism was another.</p>

<p>Theresia was sitting on her favourite settee, leaning forward
with her hands clasped between her knees, her head was bent, and
the tiny rose-shaded lamp failed to throw its glimmer of light upon
her face. The clock on the mantelshelf behind her was ticking with
insentient monotony. Anon, a distant chime struck the quarter after
three. Whereupon Chauvelin rose.</p>

<p>"I think we understand one another, citoyenne," he said quietly,
and with a sigh of complete satisfaction. "It is late now. At what
hour may I have the privilege of seeing you alone?"</p>

<p>"At three in the afternoon?" she replied tonelessly, like one
speaking in a dream. "Citizen Tallien is always at the Convention
then, and my door will be denied to everybody else."</p>

<p>"I'll be here at three o'clock," was Chauvelin's final word.</p>

<p>Theresia had not moved. He made her a deep bow and went out of
the room. The next moment, the opening and shutting of the outer
door proclaimed that he had gone.</p>

<p>After that, Theresia Cabarrus went to bed.</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>Chapter XIII&mdash;The Fisherman's
Rest</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>And whilst the whole of Europe was in travail with the
repercussion of the gigantic upheaval that was shaking France to
its historic foundations, the last few years had seen but very
little change in this little corner of England.</p>

<p><i>The Fisherman's Rest</i> stood where it had done for two
centuries and long before thrones had tottered and anointed heads
fallen on the scaffold. The oak rafters, black with age, the
monumental hearth, the tables and high-backed benches, seemed like
mute testimonies to good order and to tradition, just as the shiny
pewter mugs, the foaming ale, the brass that glittered like gold,
bore witness to unimpaired prosperity and an even, well-regulated
life.</p>

<p>Over in the kitchen yonder, Mistress Sally Waite, as she now
was, still ruled with a firm if somewhat hasty hand, the weight of
which, so the naughty gossips averred, even her husband, Master
Harry Waite, had experienced more than once. She still queened it
over her father's household, presided over his kitchen, and drove
the young scullery wenches to their task with her sharp tongue and
an occasional slap. But <i>The Fisherman's Rest</i> could not have
gone on without her. The copper saucepans would in truth not have
glittered so, nor would the home-brewed ale have tasted half so
luscious to Master Jellyband's faithful customers, had not Mistress
Sally's strong brown hands drawn it for them, with just the right
amount of creamy foam on the top and not a bit too much.</p>

<p>And so it was still many a "Ho, Sally! 'Ere Sally! 'Ow long'll
you be with that there beer!" or "Say, Sally! A cut of your cheese
and homebaked bread; and look sharp about it!" that resounded from
end to end of the long, low-raftered coffee-room of <i>The
Fisherman's Rest</i>, on this fine May day of the year of grace
1794.</p>

<p>Sally Waite, her muslin cap set at a becoming angle, her
kerchief primly folded over her well-developed bosom, and her
kirtle neatly raised above a pair of exceedingly shapely ankles,
was in and out of the room, in and out of the kitchen, tripping it
like a benevolent if somewhat substantial fairy, bandying chaff
here, administering rebuke there, hot, panting and excited.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>The while mine host, Master Jellyband&mdash;perhaps a shade more
portly of figure, a thought more bald of pate, these last two
years&mdash;stood with stubby legs firmly planted upon his own
hearth, wherein, despite the warmth of a glorious afternoon, a log
fire blazed away merrily. He was giving forth his views upon the
political situation of Europe generally with the self-satisfied
assurance born of complete ignorance and true British insular
prejudice.</p>

<p>Believe me, Mr. Jellyband was in no two minds about "them
murderin' furriners over yonder" who had done away with their King
and Queen and all their nobility and quality, and whom England had
at last decided to lick into shape.</p>

<p>"And not a moment too soon, hark'ee, Mr. 'Empseed," he went on
sententiously. "And if I 'ad my way, we should 'ave punished 'em
proper long before this&mdash;blown their bloomin' Paris into
smithereens and carried off the pore Queen afore those murderous
villains 'ad 'er pretty 'ead off 'er shoulders!"</p>

<p>Mr. Hempseed, from his own privileged corner in the inglenook,
was not altogether prepared to admit that.</p>

<p>"I am not for interfering with other folks' ways," he said,
raising his quaking treble so as to stem effectually the torrent of
Master Jellyband's eloquence. "As the Scriptures say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Keep your dirty fingers from off my waist!" came in decisive
tones from Mistress Sally Waite, whilst the shrill sound made by
the violent contact of a feminine hand against a manly cheek froze
the Scriptural quotation on Mr. Hempseed's lips.</p>

<p>"Now then, now then, Sally!" Mr. Jellyband thought fit to say in
stern tones, not liking his customers to be thus summarily dealt
with.</p>

<p>"Now then, father," Sally retorted, with a toss of her brown
curls, "you just attend to your politics, and Mr. 'Empseed to 'is
Scriptures, and leave me to deal with them impudent jackanapes. You
wait!" she added, turning once more with a parting shot directed
against the discomfited offender. "If my 'Arry catches you at them
tricks, you'll see what you get&mdash;that's all!"</p>

<p>"Sally!" Mr. Jellyband admonished, more sternly this time.
"You'll 'ave my lord Hastings 'ere before 'is dinner is ready."</p>

<p>Which suggestion so overawed Mistress Sally that she promptly
forgot the misdoings of the forward swain and failed to hear the
sarcastic chuckle which greeted the mention of her husband's name.
With an excited little cry, she ran quickly out of the room.</p>

<p>Mr. Hempseed, loftily unaware of interruption, concluded his
sententious remark:</p>

<p>"As the Scriptures say, Mr. Jellyband: 'Ave no fellowship with
the unfruitful work of darkness.' I don't 'old not with
interfering. Remember what the Scriptures say: 'E that committeth
sin is of the devil, and the devil sinneth from the beginning,'" he
concluded with sublime irrelevance, sagely nodding his head.</p>

<p>But Mr. Jellyband was not thus lightly to be confounded in his
argument&mdash;no, not by any quotation, relevant or otherwise!</p>

<p>"All very fine, Mr. 'Empseed," he said, "and good enough for
them 'oo, like yourself, are willin' to side with them murderin'
reprobates..."</p>

<p>"Like myself, Mr. Jellyband?" protested Mr. Hempseed, with as
much vigour as his shrill treble would allow. "Nay, but I'm not for
them children of darkness&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You may be or you may not," Mr. Jellyband went on, nothing
daunted. "There be many as are, and 'oo'd say 'Let 'em murder,'
even now, but I say that them as 'oo talk that way are not true
Englishmen; for 'tis we Englishmen 'oo can teach the furriner just
what 'e may do and what 'e may not. And as we've got the ships and
the men and the money, we can just fight 'em as are not of our way
o' thinkin'. And let me tell you, Mr. 'Empseed, that I'm prepared
to back my opinions 'gainst any man as don't agree with me!"</p>

<p>For the nonce Mr. Hempseed was silent. True, a Scriptural text
did hover on his thin, quivering lips; but as no one paid any heed
to him for the moment its appositeness will for ever remain
doubtful. The honours of victory rested with Mr. Jellyband. Such
lofty patriotism, coupled with so much sound knowledge of political
affairs, could not fail to leave its impress upon the more ignorant
and the less fervent amongst the frequenters of <i>The Fisherman's
Rest</i>.</p>

<p>Indeed, who was more qualified to pass an opinion on current
events than the host of that much-frequented resort, seeing that
the ladies and gentlemen of quality who came to England from over
the water, so as to escape all them murtherin' reprobates in their
own country, did most times halt at <i>The Fisherman's Rest</i> on
their way to London or to Bath? And though Mr. Jellyband did not
know a word of French&mdash;no furrin lingo for him, thank
'ee!&mdash;he nevertheless had mixed with all that nobility and
gentry for over two years now, and had learned all that there was
to know about the life over there, and about Mr. Pitt's intentions
to put a stop to all those abominations.</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>Even now, hardly had mine hosts conversation with his favoured
customers assumed a more domestic turn, than a loud clatter on the
cobblestones outside, a jingle and a rattle, shouts, laughter and
bustle, announced the arrival of guests who were privileged to make
as much noise as they pleased.</p>

<p>Mr. Jellyband ran to the door, shouted for Sally at the top of
his voice with a "Here's my lord Hastings!" to add spur to Sally's
hustle. Politics were forgotten for the nonce, arguments set aside,
in the excitement of welcoming the quality.</p>

<p>Three young gallants in travelling clothes, smart of appearance
and debonair of mien, were ushering a party of
strangers&mdash;three ladies and two men&mdash;into the hospitable
porch of <i>The Fisherman's Rest</i>. The little party had walked
across from the inner harbour, where the graceful masts of an
elegant schooner lately arrived in port were seen gently swaying
against the delicately coloured afternoon sky. Three or four
sailors from the schooner were carrying luggage, which they
deposited in the hall of the inn, then touched their forelocks in
response to a pleasant smile and nod from the young lords.</p>

<p>"This way, my lord," Master Jellyband reiterated with jovial
obsequiousness. "Everything is ready. This way! Hey, Sallee!" he
called again; and Sally, hot, excited, blushing, came tripping over
from the kitchen, wiping her hot plump palms against her apron in
anticipation of shaking hands with their lordships.</p>

<p>"Since Mr. Waite isn't anywhere about," my lord Hastings said
gaily, as he put a bold arm round Mistress Sally's dainty waist,
"I'll e'en have a kiss, my pretty one."</p>

<p>"And I, too, by gad, for old sake's sake!" Lord Tony asserted,
and planked a hearty kiss on mistress Sally's dimpled cheek.</p>

<p>"At your service, my lords, at your service!" Master Jellyband
rejoined, laughing. Then added more soberly: "Now then, Sally, show
the ladies up into the blue room, the while their lordships 'ave a
first shake down in the coffee-room. This way, gentlemen&mdash;your
lordships&mdash;this way!"</p>

<p>The strangers in the meanwhile had stood by, wide-eyed and
somewhat bewildered in face of this exuberant hilarity which was so
unlike what they had pictured to themselves of dull, fog-ridden
England&mdash;so unlike, too, the dreary moroseness which of late
had replaced the erstwhile lighthearted gaiety of their own
countrymen. The porch and the narrow hall of <i>The Fisherman's
Rest</i> appeared to them seething with vitality. Every one was
talking, nobody seemed to listen; every one was merry, and every
one knew everybody else and was pleased to meet them. Sonorous
laughter echoed from end to end along the solid beams, black and
shiny with age. It all seemed so homely, so happy. The deference
paid to the young gallants and to them as strangers by the sailors
and the innkeeper was so genuine and hearty without the slightest
sign of servility, that those five people who had left behind them
so much class-hatred, enmity and cruelty in their own country, felt
an unaccountable tightening of the heart, a few hot tears rise to
their eyes, partly of joy, but partly too of regret.</p>

<p class="cpb">4.</p>

<p>Lord Hastings, the youngest and merries of the English party,
guided the two Frenchmen toward the coffee-room, with many a jest
in atrocious French and kindly words of encouragement, all intended
to put the strangers at their ease.</p>

<p>Lord Anthony Dewhurst and Sir Andrew Ffoulkes&mdash;a trifle
more serious and earnest, yet equally happy and excited at the
success of their perilous adventure and at the prospect of reunion
with their wives&mdash;lingered a moment longer in the hall, in
order to speak with the sailors who had brought the luggage
along.</p>

<p>"Do you know aught of Sir Percy?" Lord Tony asked.</p>

<p>"No, my lord," the sailor gave answer; "not since he went ashore
early this morning. 'Er Ladyship was waitin' for 'im on the pier.
Sir Percy just ran up the steps and then 'e shouted to us to get
back quickly. 'Tell their lordships,' 'e says, 'I'll meet them at
<i>The Rest</i>.' And then Sir Percy and 'er ladyship just walked
off and we saw naun more of them."</p>

<p>"That was many hours ago," Sir Andrew Ffoulkes mused, with an
inward smile. He too saw visions of meeting his pretty Suzanne very
soon, and walking away with her into the land of dreams.</p>

<p>"'Twas just six o'clock when Sir Percy 'ad the boat lowered,"
the sailor rejoined. "And we rowed quick back after we landed 'im,
but the <i>Day-Dream</i>, she 'ad to wait for the tie. We wurr a
long while gettin' into port."</p>

<p>Sir Andrew nodded.</p>

<p>"You don't know," he said, "if the skipper had any further
orders?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir," the man replied. "But we mun be in
readiness always. No one knows when Sir Percy may wish to set sail
again."</p>

<p>The two young men said nothing more, and presently the sailors
touched their forelocks and went away. Lord Tony and Sir Andrew
exchanged knowing smiles. They could easily picture to themselves
their beloved chief, indefatigable, like a boy let out from school,
exhilarated by the deadly danger through which he had once more
passed unscathed, clasping his adored wife in his arms and
wandering off with her, heaven knew whither, living his life of joy
and love and happiness during the brief hours which his own
indomitable energy, his reckless courage, accorded to the
sentimental side of his complex nature.</p>

<p>Far too impatient to wait until the tide allowed the
<i>Day-Dream</i> to get into port, he had been rowed ashore in the
early dawn, and his beautiful Marguerite&mdash;punctual to the
assignation conveyed to her by one of those mysterious means of
which Percy alone knew the secret&mdash;was ready there to receive
him, to forget in the shelter of his arms the days of racking
anxiety and of cruel terror for her beloved through which she had
again and again been forced to pass.</p>

<p>Neither Lord Tony nor Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, the Scarlet
Pimpernel's most faithful and devoted lieutenants, begrudged their
chief these extra hours of bliss, the while they were left in
charge of the party so lately rescued from horrible death. They
knew that within a day or two&mdash;within a few hours,
perhaps&mdash;Blakeney would tear himself away once more from the
clinging embrace of his exquisite wife, from the comfort of luxury
of an ideal home, from the adulation of friends, the pleasures of
wealth and of fashion, in order mayhap to grovel in the squalor and
filth of some outlandish corner of Pairs, where he could be in
touch with the innocents who suffered&mdash;the poor, the
terror-stricken victims of the merciless revolution. Within a few
hours, mayhap, he would be risking his life again every moment of
the day, in order to save some poor hunted
fellow-creature&mdash;man, woman or child&mdash;from death that
threatened them at the hands of inhuman monsters who knew neither
mercy nor compunction.</p>

<p>And for the nineteen members of the League, they took it in
turns to follow their leader where danger was thickest. It was a
privilege eagerly sought, deserved by all, and accorded to those
who were most highly trusted. It was invariably followed by a
period of rest in happy England, with wife, friends, joy and
luxury. Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, Lord Anthony Dewhurst and my lord
Hastings had been of the expedition which brought Mme de Serval
with her three children and Bertrand Moncrif safely to England,
after adventures more perilous, more reckless of danger, than most.
Within a few hours they would be free to forget in the embrace of
clinging arms every peril and every adventure save the eternal one
of love, free to forswear everything outside that, save their
veneration for their chief and their loyalty to his cause.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>Chapter XIV&mdash;The
Castaway</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>An excellent dinner served by Mistress Sally and her attendant
little wenches put everybody into rare good-humour. Madame de
Serval&mdash;pale, delicate, with gentle, plaintive voice and eyes
that had acquired a pathetically furtive look&mdash;even contrived
to smile, her heart warmed by the genuine welcome, the rare gaiety
that irradiated this fortunate corner of God's earth. Wars and
rumours of war reached it only as an echo of great things that went
on in the vast outside world; and though more than one of Dover's
gallant sons had perished in one or the other of the Duke of York's
unfortunate incursions into Holland, or in one of the numerous
naval engagements off the Western shores of France, on the whole,
the war, intermittent and desultory, had not yet cast its heavy
gloom over the entire country.</p>

<p>Joséphine and Jacques de Serval, whose enthusiasm for martyrdom
had received so severe a check in the course of the Fraternal
Supper in the Rue. St. Honoré, had at first with the
self-consciousness of youth adopted an attitude of obstinate and
irreclaimable sorrow, until the antics of Master Harry Waite,
pretty Sally's husband&mdash;jealous as a young turkey-cock of
every gallant who dared to ogle his buxom wife&mdash;brought
laughter to their lips. My Lord Hastings' comical attempts at
speaking French, the droll mistakes he made, easily did the rest;
and soon their lively, high-pitched Latin voices mingled with
unimpaired gaiety with the more mellow sound of Anglo-Saxon
tongues.</p>

<p>Even Régine de Serval had smiled when my lord Hastings had asked
her with grave solemnity whether Mme de Serval would wish "le fou
de descendre"&mdash;the lunatic to the come
downstairs&mdash;meaning all the while whether she wanted the fire
in the big hearth to be let down, seeing that the atmosphere in the
coffee-room was growing terribly hot.</p>

<p>The only one who seemed quite unable to shake off his moroseness
was Bertrand Moncrif. He sat next to Régine, silent, somewhat
sullen, a look that seemed almost one of dull resentment lingering
in his eyes. From time to time, when he appeared peculiarly moody
or when he refused to eat, her little hand would steal out under
the table and press his with a gentle, motherly gesture.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>It was when the merry meal was over and while Master Jellyband
was going the round with a fine bottle of smuggled brandy, which
the young gentlemen sipped with unmistakable relish, that a
commotion arose outside the inn; whereupon Master Harry Waite ran
out of the coffee-room in order to see what was amiss.</p>

<p>Nothing very much apparently. Waite came back after a moment or
two and said that two sailors from the barque <i>Angela</i> were
outside with a young French lad, who seemed more dead than alive,
and whom it appears the barque had picked up just outside French
waters, in an open boat, half perished with terror and inanition.
As the lad spoke nothing but French, the sailors had brought him
along to <i>The Fisherman's Rest</i>, thinking that maybe some of
the quality would care to interrogate him.</p>

<p>At once Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, my Lord Tony and Lord Hastings were
on the qui vive. A lad in distress, coming from France, found alone
in an open boat, suggested one of those tragedies in which the
League of the Scarlet Pimpernel was wont to play a rôle.</p>

<p>"Let the lad be taken into the parlour, Jellyband," Sir Andrew
commanded. "You've got a fire in there, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Sir Andrew! We always keep fires going here until
past the 15th of May."</p>

<p>"Well then, get him in there. Then give him some of your
smuggled brandy first, you old dog! then some wine and food. After
that we'll find out something more about him."</p>

<p>He himself went along in order to see that his orders were
carried out. Jellyband, as usual, had already deputed his daughter
to do the necessary, and in the hall there was Mistress Sally,
capable and compassionate, supporting, almost carrying, a youth who
in truth appeared scarce able to stand.</p>

<p>She led him gently into the small private parlour, where a
cheerful log-fire was blazing, sat him down in an arm-chair beside
the hearth, after which Master Jellyband himself poured half a
glass of brandy down the poor lad's throat. This revived him a
little, and he looked about him with huge, scared eyes.</p>

<p>"Sainte Mére de Dieu!" he murmured feebly. "Where am I?"</p>

<p>"Never mind about that now, my lad," replied Sir Andrew, whose
knowledge of French was of a distinctly higher order than that of
his comrades. "You are among friends. That is enough. Have
something to eat and drink now. Later we'll talk."</p>

<p>He was eyeing the boy keenly. Contact with suffering and misery
over there in France, under the leadership of the most selfless,
most understanding man of this or any time, had intensified his
powers of perception. Even the first glance had revealed to him the
fact that here was no ordinary waif. The lad spoke with a gentle,
highly refined voice; his skin was delicate, and his face
exquisitely beautiful; his hands, though covered with grime, and
his feet, encased in huge, coarse boots, were small and daintily
shaped, like those of a woman. Already Sir Andrew had made up his
mind that if the oilskin cap which sat so extraordinarily tightly
on the boy's head were to be removed, a wealth of long hair would
certainly be revealed.</p>

<p>However, all these facts, which threw over the young stranger a
further veil of mystery, could not in all humanity be investigated
now. Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, with the consummate tact born of
kindliness, left the lad alone as soon as he appeared able to sit
up and eat, and himself rejoined his friends in the
coffee-room.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>Chapter XV&mdash;The Nest</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>No one, save a very few intimates, knew of the little nest
wherein Sir Percy Blakeney and his lady hid their happiness on
those occasions when the indefatigable Scarlet Pimpernel was only
able to spend a few hours in England, and when a journey to their
beautiful home in Richmond could not be thought of. The
house&mdash;it was only a cottage, timbered and
creeper-clad&mdash;lay about a mile and a half outside Dover, off
the main road, perched up high on rising ground over a narrow lane.
It had a small garden round it, which in May was ablaze with
daffodils and bluebells, and in June with roses. Two faithful
servants, a man and his wife, looked after the place, kept the nest
cosy and warm whenever her ladyship wearied of fashion, or else,
actually expecting Sir Percy, would come down from London for a day
or two in order to dream of that elusive and transient happiness
for which her soul hungered, even while her indomitable spirit
accepted the inevitable.</p>

<p>A few days ago the weekly courier from France had brought her a
line from Sir Percy, together with the promise that she should rest
in his arms on the 1st of May. And Marguerite had come down to the
creeper-covered cottage knowing that, despite obstacles which might
prove insuperable to others, Percy would keep his word.</p>

<p>She had stolen out at dawn to wait for him on the pier; and sure
enough, as soon as the May-day sun, which had risen to-day in his
glory as if to crown her brief happiness with warmth and radiance,
had dissipated the morning mist, her yearning eyes had spied the
smart white gig which had put off from the <i>Day-Dream</i> leaving
the graceful ship to await the turn of the tide before putting into
port.</p>

<p>Since then, every moment of the day had been one of rapture. The
first sight of her husband in his huge caped coat, which seemed to
add further inches to his great height, his call of triumph when he
saw her, his arms outstretched, there, far away in the small boat,
with a gesture of such infinite longing that for a second or two
tears obscured Marguerite's vision. Then the drawing up of the boat
against the landing-stage; Percy's spring ashore; his voice, his
look; the strength of his arms; the ardour of his embrace. Rapture,
in truth, to which the thought of its brief duration alone lent a
touch of bitterness.</p>

<p>But of parting again Marguerite would not think&mdash;not
to-day, while the birds were singing a deafening paean of joy; not
while the scent of growing grass, of moits, travailing earth, was
in her nostrils; not while the sap was in the trees, and the gummy
crimson buds of the chestnuts were bursting into leaf. Not while
she wandered up the narrow lane between hedges of black-thorn in
bloom, with Percy's arm around her, his loved voice in her ear, his
merry laughter echoing through the sweet morning air.</p>

<p>After that, breakfast in the low, raftered room&mdash;the hot,
savoury milk, the home-baked bread, the home-churned butter. Then
the long, delicious, intimate talk of love, and of yearnings, of
duty and of gallant deeds. Blakeney kept nothing secret from his
wife; and what he did not tell her, that she easily guessed. But it
was from the members of the League that she learned all there was
to know of heroism and selflessness in the perilous adventures
through which her husband passed with so lighthearted a gaiety.</p>

<p>"You should see me as an asthmatic reprobate, m'dear," he would
say, with his infectious laugh. "And hear that cough! Lud love you,
but I am mightily proud of that cough! Poor old Rateau does not do
it better himself; and he is genuinely asthmatic."</p>

<p>He gave her an example of his prowess; but she would not allow
him to go on. The sound was too weird, and conjured up visions
which to-day she would fain forget.</p>

<p>"Rateau was a real find," he went on more seriously; "because he
is three parts an imbecile and as obedient as a dog. When some of
those devils are on my track, lo! the real Rateau appears and yours
truly vanishes where no one can find him!"</p>

<p>"Pray God," she murmured involuntarily, "they never may!"</p>

<p>"They won't, m'dear, they won't!" he asserted with lighthearted
conviction. "They have become so confused now between Rateau the
coal-heaver, the mysterious Scarlet Pimpernel, and the problematic
English milor, that all three of these personalities can appear
before their eyes and they will let 'em all escape! I assure you
that the confusion between the Scarlet Pimpernel who was in the
ante-chamber of Mother Théot on that fateful afternoon, and again
at the Fraternal Supper in the Rue St. Honoré, and the real Rateau
who was at Mother Théot's while that same exciting supper party was
going on, was so great that not one of those murdering reprobates
could trust his own eyes and ears, and that we got away as easily
as rabbits out of a torn net."</p>

<p>Thus did he explain and laugh over the perilous adventure where
he had faced a howling mob disguised as Rateau the coal-heaver, and
with almost superhuman pluck and boldness had dragged Mme de Serval
and her children into the derelict house which was one of the
League's headquarters. That is how he characterized the
extraordinary feat of audacity when, in order to give his gallant
lieutenants time to smuggle the unfortunates out of the house
through a back and secret way, he showed himself on the balcony
above the multitude, and hurled dummy figures into the brazier
below.</p>

<p>Then came the story of Bertrand Moncrif, snatched
half-unconscious out of the apartment of the fair Theresia
Cabarrus, whilst Robespierre himself sat not half a dozen yards
away, with only the thickness of a wall between him and his arch
enemy.</p>

<p>"How the woman must hate you!" Marguerite murmured, with a
slight shudder of acute anxiety which she did her best to conceal.
"There are things that a woman like the Cabarrus will never
forgive. Whether she cares for Bertrand Moncrif or no, her vanity
will suffer intensely, and she will never forgive you for taking
him out of her clutches."</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"Lud, m'dear!" he said lightly. "If we were to take heed of all
the people who hate us we should spend our lives pondering rather
than doing. And all I want to ponder over," he added, whilst his
glance of passionate earnestness seemed to envelop her like an
exquisite warm mantle, "is your beauty, your eyes, the scent of
your hair, the delicious flavour of your kiss!"</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>It was some hours later on that same glorious day, when the
shadows of ash and chestnut lay right across the lane and the arms
of evening folded the cosy nest in their mysterious embrace, that
Sir Percy and Marguerite sat in the deep window-embrasure of the
tiny living-room. He had thrown open wide the casements, and hand
resting in hand, they watched the last ray of golden light
lingering in the west and listened to the twitterings which came
like tender "good nights" from the newly-built nests among the
trees.</p>

<p>It was one of those perfect spring evenings, rare enough in
northern climes, without a breath of wind, when every sound carries
clear and sharp through the stillness around. The air was soft and
slightly moist, with a tang in it of wakening life and of rising
sap, and with the scent of wild narcissus and of wood violets
rising like intoxizating incense to the nostrils. It was in truth
one of those evening when happiness itself seems rudely out of
place, and nature&mdash;exquisite, but so cruelly, transient in her
loveliness&mdash;demands the tribute of gentle melancholy.</p>

<p>A thrush said something to its mate&mdash;something insistent
and tender that lulled them both to rest. After that, Nature became
quite still, and Marguerite, with a catch in her throat which she
would have given much to suppress, laid her head upon her husband's
breast.</p>

<p>Then it was that suddenly a man's voice, hoarse but distant,
broke in upon the perfect peace around. What it said could not at
first be gathered. It took some time ere Marguerite became
sufficiently conscious of the disturbing noise to raise her head
and listen. As for Sir Percy, he was wrapped in the contemplating
of the woman he worshipped, and nothing short of an earthquake
would have dragged him back to reality, had not Marguerite raised
herself on her knees and quickly whispered:</p>

<p>"Listen!"</p>

<p>The man's voice had been answered by a woman's raised as if in
defiance that seemed both pitiful and futile.</p>

<p>"You cannot harm me now. I am in England!"</p>

<p>Marguerite leaned out of the window, tried to peer into the
darkness which was fast gathering over the lane. The voices had
come from there: first the man's, then the woman's, and now the
man's again; both speaking in French, the woman obviously terrified
and pleading, the man harsh and commanding. Now it was raised
again, more incisive and distinct than before, and Marguerite had
in truth some difficulty in repressing the cry that rose to her
lips. She had recognized the man's voice.</p>

<p>"Chauvelin!" she murmured.</p>

<p>"Aye, in England, citoyenne!" that ominous voice went on drily.
"But the arm of justice is long. And remember that you are not the
first who has tried&mdash;unsuccessfully, let me tell you!&mdash;to
evade punishment by flying to the enemies of France. Wherever you
may hide, I will know how to find you. Have I not found you here,
now?&mdash;and you but a few hours in Dover!"</p>

<p>"But you cannot touch me!" the woman protested with the courage
of one in despair.</p>

<p>The man laughed.</p>

<p>"Are you really simple enough, citoyenne," he said, "to be
convinced of that?"</p>

<p>This sarcastic retort was followed by a moment or two of
silence, then by a woman's cry; and in an instant Sir Percy was on
his feet and out of the house. Marguerite followed him as far as
the porch, whence the sloping ground, aided by flagged steps here
and there, led down to the gate and thence on to the lane.</p>

<p>It was close beside the gate that a human-looking bundle lay
huddled, when Sir Percy came upon the scene, even whilst, some
fifty yards away at the sharp bend of the lane, a man could be seen
walking rapidly away, his pace wellnigh at a run. Sir Percy's
instinct was for giving chase, but the huddle-up figure put out a
pair of arms and clung to him so desperately, with smothered cries
of: "For pity's sake, don't leave me!" that it would have been
inhuman to go. And so he bent down, raised the human bundle from
the ground, and carried it bodily up into the house.</p>

<p>Here he deposited his burden upon the window seat, where but a
few moments ago he had been wrapped in the contemplation of
Marguerite's eyelashes, and with his habitual quaint good-humour,
said:</p>

<p>"I leave the rest to you, m'dear. My French is too atrocious for
dealing with the case."</p>

<p>Marguerite understood the hint. Sir Percy, whose command of
French was nothing short of phenomenal, never used the language
save when engaged in his perilous undertakings. His perfect
knowledge of every idiom would have set any ill-intentioned
eavesdropper thinking.</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>The human bundle looked very pathetic lying there upon the
window seat, propped up with cushions. It appeared to be a youth,
dressed in rough fisherman's clothes and with a cap that fitted
tightly round the head; but with hands delicate as a woman's and a
face of exquisite beauty.</p>

<p>Without another word, Marguerite quietly took hold of the cap
and gently removed it. A wealth of blue-black hair fell like a
cascade over the recumbent shoulders. "I thought as much!" Sir
Percy remarked quietly, even whilst the stranger, apparently
terrified, jumped up and burst into tears, moaning piteously:</p>

<p>"<i>Oh, mon Dieu! mon Dieu! Sainte Vierge,
protégez-moi!</i>"</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but to wait; and anon the first paroxysm
of grief and terror passed. The stranger, with a wry little smile,
took the handkerchief which Lady Blakeney was holding out to her
and proceeded to dry her tears. Then she looked up at the kind
Samaritans who had befriended her.</p>

<p>"I am an impostor, I know," she said, with lips that quivered
like those of a child in grief. "But if you only knew...!"</p>

<p>She sat bolt upright now, squeezing and twirling the wet
handkerchief between her fingers.</p>

<p>"Some kind English gentlemen were good to me, down in the town,"
she went on more glibly. "They gave me food and shelter, and I was
left alone to rest. But I felt stifled in the narrow room. I could
hear every one talking and laughing, and the evening air was so
beautiful. So I ventured out. I only meant to breathe a little
fresh air; but it was all so lovely, so peaceful...here in
England...so different to..."</p>

<p>She shuddered a little and looked as if she was going to cry
again. But Marguerite interposed gently:</p>

<p>"So you prolonged your walk, and found this lane?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I prolonged my walk," the woman replied. "I did not notice
that the road had become lonely. Then suddenly I realized that I
was being followed, and I ran. Mon Dieu, how I ran! Whither, I knew
not! I just felt that something horrible was at my heels!"</p>

<p>Her eyes, dilated with terror, looked as black as sloes. They
were fixed upon Marguerite, never once raised on Sir Percy, who,
standing some way apart from the two women, was looking down on
them, silent and apparently unmoved.</p>

<p>The stranger shuddered again; her face was almost grey in its
expression of fear, and her lips seemed quite bloodless. Marguerite
gave her trembling hands an encouraging pat.</p>

<p>"It was lucky," she said gently, "that you found your way
here."</p>

<p>"I had seen the light," the woman continued more calmly. "And I
believe that at the back of my mind there was the instinct to run
for shelter. Then suddenly my foot knocked against a stone, and I
fell. I tried to raise myself quickly, but I had not the time, for
the next moment I felt a hand on my shoulder, and a voice&mdash;oh,
a voice I dread, citoyenne!&mdash;called to me by name."</p>

<p>"The voice of citizen Chauvelin?" Marguerite asked simply.</p>

<p>The woman looked up quickly.</p>

<p>"You knew&mdash;?" she murmured.</p>

<p>"I knew his voice."</p>

<p>"But you know him?" the other insisted.</p>

<p>"I know him&mdash;yes," Marguerite replied. "I am a compatriot
of yours. Before I married, I was Marguerite St. Just."</p>

<p>"St. Just?"</p>

<p>"We are cousins, my brother and I, of the young deputy, the
friend of Robespierre."</p>

<p>"God help you!" the woman murmured.</p>

<p>"He has done so already, by bringing us both to England. My
brother is married, and I am Lady Blakeney now. You too will feel
happy and safe now that you are here."</p>

<p>"Happy?" the woman ejaculated, with a piteous sob. "And safe?
<i>Mon Dieu</i>, if only I could think it!"</p>

<p>"But what have you to fear? Chauvelin may have retained some
semblance of power over in France. He has none over here."</p>

<p>"He hates me!" the other murmured. "Oh, how he hates me!"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>The stranger made no immediate reply. Her eyes, dark as the
night, glowing and searching, seemed to read the very soul behind
Marguerite's serene brow. Then after awhile she went on, with
seeming irrelevance:</p>

<p>"It all began so foolishly!...<i>mon Dieu</i>, how foolishly!
And I really meant nothing treacherous to my own
country&mdash;nothing unpatriotic, quoi?" she suddenly seized
Marguerite's two hands and exclaimed with childlike enthusiasm:
"You have heard of the Scarlet Pimpernel, have you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Marguerite replied. "I have heard of him."</p>

<p>"You know then that he is the finest, bravest, most wonderful
man in all the world?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that," Marguerite assented with a smile.</p>

<p>"Of course, in France they hate him. Naturally! He is the enemy
of the republic, <i>quoi</i>? He is against all those massacres,
the persecution of the innocent. He saves them and helps them when
he can. So they hate him. Naturally."</p>

<p>"Naturally!"</p>

<p>"But I have always admired him," the woman continued, enthusiasm
glowing in her dark eyes. "Always; always! Ever since I heard what
he had done, and how he saved the Comte de Tournay, and Juliette
Marny, and Esther Vincent, and&mdash;and countless others. Oh, I
knew about them all! For I knew Chauvelin well, and one or two of
the men on the Committee of Public Safety quite intimately, and I
used to worm out of them all the true facts about the Scarlet
Pimpernel. Can you wonder that with my whole soul I admired him? I
worshipped him! I could have laid down my life to help him! He has
been the guiding star of my dreary life&mdash;my hero and my
king!"</p>

<p>She paused, and those deep, dark eyes of her were fixed straight
out before her, as if in truth she beheld the hero of her dreams.
There was a glow now in her cheeks, and her marvellous hair fell
like a sable mantle around her, framing the perfect oval of the
face and enhancing by vivid contrast the creamy whiteness of chin
and throat and the rose-like bloom that had spread over her face.
Indeed, this was an exquisitely beautiful creature, and Marguerite,
herself one of the loveliest women of her time, was carried away by
genuine, wholehearted admiration for the stranger, as well as by
her enthusiasm, which, in very truth, seeing its object, was a
perfectly natural feeling.</p>

<p>"So now," the woman concluded, coming back to the painful
realities of life with a shudder, which extinguished the light in
her eyes and took all the glow out of her cheeks, "so now you
understand perhaps why Chauvelin hates me!"</p>

<p>"You must have been rather indiscreet," Marguerite remarked with
a smile.</p>

<p>"I was, I suppose. And Chauvelin is so vindictive. He hates the
Scarlet Pimpernel. Out of a few words, foolishly spoken perhaps, he
has made out a case against me. A friend gave me warning. My name
was already in the hands of Foucquier-Tinville. You know what that
means! Perquisition! Arrest! Judgment! Then the guillotine! Oh,
<i>mon Dieu</i>! And I had done nothing!&mdash;nothing! I fled out
of Paris. An influential friend just contrived to arrange this for
me. A faithful servant accompanied me. We reached Boulogne. How, I
know not! I was so weak, so ill, so wretched, I hardly lived. I
just allowed François&mdash;that was my servant&mdash;to take me
whithersoever he wished. But we had no passports, no
papers&mdash;nothing! And Chauvelin was on our track. We had to
hide&mdash;in barns...in pig-styes...anywhere! But we reached
Boulogne at last...I had some money, fortunately. We bribed a
fisherman to let us have his boat. Only a small boat&mdash;imagine!
A rowing boat! And François and I alone in it! But it meant our
lives if we didn't go; and perhaps it meant our lives if we went! A
rowing boat on the great, big sea!...Fortunately the weather was
fine, and François lifted me into the boat. And I just remember
seeing the coast of France receding, receding,
receding&mdash;farther and farther from me. I was so tired. It is
possible that I slept. Then suddenly something woke me. I was wide
awake. I had heard a cry. I knew I had heard a cry, and then a
splash&mdash;an awful splash! I was wet through. One oar hung in
the rowlock; the other had gone. And François was not there. I was
all alone."</p>

<p>She spoke in hard, jerky sentences, as if every word hurt her
physically as she uttered it. For the most part she was looking
down on her hands, that twitched convulsively and twisted the tiny
wet handkerchief into a ball. But now and again she looked up, not
at Marguerite always, rather at Sir Percy. Her glowing, tear-wet
eyes fastened themselves on him from time to time with an appealing
or a defiant gaze. He appeared silent and sympathetic, and his
glance rested on her the whole while that she spoke, with an
expression of detached if kindly interest, as if he did not quite
understand everything that she said. Marguerite as usual was full
of tenderness and compassion.</p>

<p>"How terribly you must have suffered!" she said gently. "But
what happened after that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know! I don't know!" the poor woman resumed. "I was
too numbed, too dazed with horror and fear, to suffer very much.
The boat drifted on, I suppose. It was a beautiful, calm night. And
the moon was lovely. You remember the moon last night?"</p>

<p>Marguerite nodded.</p>

<p>"But I remember nothing after...after that awful cry...and the
splash! I suppose my poor François fainted or fell asleep...and
that he fell into the water. I never saw him again...And I remember
nothing until&mdash;until I found myself on board a ship with a lot
of rough sailors around me, who seemed very kind...They brought me
ashore and took me to a nice warm place, where some English
gentlemen took compassion on me. And...and...I have already told
you the rest."</p>

<p>She leaned back against the cushions of the seat as if exhausted
with the prolonged effort. Her hands seemed quite cold now, almost
blue, and Marguerite rose and closed the window behind her.</p>

<p>"How kind and thoughtful you are!" the stranger exclaimed, and
after a moment added with a weary sigh, "I must not trespass any
longer on your kindness. It is late now, and...I must go."</p>

<p>She struggled to her feet, rose with obvious reluctance.</p>

<p>"The inn where I was," she said, "it is not far?"</p>

<p>"But you cannot go out alone," Marguerite reckoned. "You do not
even know the way!"</p>

<p>"Ah, no! But perhaps your servant could accompany me...only as
far as the town...After that I can ask the way...I should no longer
be frightened."</p>

<p>"You speak English then, Madame?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! My father was a diplomat. He was in England once for
four years. I learned a little English. I have not forgotten
it."</p>

<p>"One of the servants shall certainly go with you. The inn you
speak of must be <i>The Fisherman's Rest</i>, since you found
English gentlemen there."</p>

<p>"If Madame will allow me?" Sir Percy broke in, for the first
time since the stranger had embarked upon her narrative.</p>

<p>The stranger looked up at him with a half-shy, half-eager
smile.</p>

<p>"You, milor!" she exclaimed. "Oh no! I would be
ashamed&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused, and her cheeks became crimson whilst she looked down
in utter confusion on her extraordinary attire.</p>

<p>"I had forgotten," she murmured tearfully. "François made me put
on these awful clothes when we left Paris."</p>

<p>"Then I must lend you a cloak for to-night," Marguerite
interposed with a smile. "But you need not mind your clothes,
Madame. On this coast our people are used to seeing unfortunate
fugitives landing in every sort of quise. To-morrow we must find
you something wherein to travel to London."</p>

<p>"To London?" the stranger said with some eagerness. "Yes! I
would wish to go to London."</p>

<p>"It will be quite easy. Mme de Serval, with her son and two
daughters and another friend, is travelling by the coach to-morrow.
You could join them, I am sure. Then you would not be alone. You
have money, Madame?" Marguerite concluded, with practical
solicitude.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" the other replied. "I have plenty for present
needs...in a wallet...under my clothes. I was able to collect a
little&mdash;and I have not lost it. I am not dependent," she
added, with a smile of gratitude. "And as soon as I have found my
husband&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your husband?" Marguerite exclaimed.</p>

<p>"M. le Marquis de Fontenay," the other answered simply. "Perhaps
you know him. You have seen him...in London?...Not?"</p>

<p>Marguerite shook her head.</p>

<p>"Not to my knowledge."</p>

<p>"He left me&mdash;two years ago...cruelly...emigrated to
England...and I was left alone in the world...He saved his own life
by running away from France; but I&mdash;I could not go just
then...and so..."</p>

<p>She seemed on the verge of breaking down again, then recovered
herself and continued more quietly:</p>

<p>"That was my idea, you see; to find my husband one day. Now a
cruel Fate has forced me to fly from France; so I thought I would
go to London and perhaps some kind friends will help me to find M.
de Fontenay. I have never ceased to love him, though he was so
cruel. And I think that...perhaps...he also has not quite forgotten
me."</p>

<p>"That were impossible," Marguerite rejoined gently. "But I have
friends in London who are in touch with most of the emigrés here.
We will see what can be done. It will not be difficult, methinks,
to find M. de Fontenay."</p>

<p>"You are an angel, milady!" the stranger exclaimed; and with a
gesture that was perfect in its suggestion of gracious humility,
she took Marguerite's hand and raised it to her lips. Then she once
more mopped her eyes, picked up her cap and hastily hid the wealth
of her hair beneath it. After which, she turned to Sir Percy.</p>

<p>"I am ready, milor," she said. "I have intruded far too long as
it is upon your privacy...But I am not brave enough to refuse your
escort. Milady, forgive me! I will walk fast, very fast, so that
milor will return to you very soon!"</p>

<p>She wrapped herself up in a cloak which, at Lady Blakeney's
bidding, one of the servants had brought her, and a moment or two
later the stranger and Sir Percy were out of the house, whilst
Marguerite remained for awhile on the porch, listening to their
retreating footsteps.</p>

<p>There was a frown of puzzlement between her brows, a look of
troubled anxiety in her eyes. Somehow, the brief sojourn of that
strange and beautiful woman in her house had filled her soul with a
vague feeling of dread, which she tried vainly to combat. There was
no real suspicion against the woman in her heart&mdash;how could
there be?&mdash;but she&mdash;Marguerite&mdash;who as a rule was so
compassionate, so understanding of those misfortunes, to alleviate
which Sir Percy was devoting his entire life, felt cold and
unresponsive in this case&mdash;most unaccountably so. Mme de
Fontenay's story differed but little in all its grim detail of
misery and humiliation from the thousand and one other similar
tales which had been poured for the past three years into her
sympathetic ear. She had always understood, had always been ready
to comfort and to help. But this time she felt very much as if she
had come across a sick or wounded reptile, something weak and dumb
and helpless, and yet withal unworthy of compassion.</p>

<p>However, Marguerite Blakeney was surely not the woman to allow
such fancies to dry the well of her pity. The gallant Scarlet
Pimpernel was not wont to pause in his errands of mercy in order to
reflect whether the objects of his selfless immolation were worthy
of it or no. So Marguerite, with a determined little sigh, chided
herself for her disloyalty and cowardice, and having dried her
tears she went within.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>Chapter XVI&mdash;A Lover of
Sport</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>For the first five minutes, Sir Percy Blakeney and Madame de
Fontenay walked side by side in silence. Then she spoke.</p>

<p>"You are silent, milor?" she queried, speaking in perfect
English.</p>

<p>"I was thinking," he replied curtly.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"What a remarkably fine actress is lost in the fashionable
Theresia Cabarrus."</p>

<p>"Madame de Fontenay, I pray you, milor," she retorted drily.</p>

<p>"Theresia Cabarrus nevertheless. Madame Tallien probably
to-morrow: for Madame divorced that weak-kneed marquis as soon as
the lay 'contre les emigrés' allowed her to regain her
freedom."</p>

<p>"You seem very well informed, milor."</p>

<p>"Almost as well as Madame herself," he riposted with a pleasant
laugh.</p>

<p>"Then you do not believe my story?"</p>

<p>"Not one word of it!" he replied.</p>

<p>"Strange!" she mused. "For every word of it is true."</p>

<p>"Demmed strange!" he assented.</p>

<p>"Of course, I did not tell all," she went on, with sudden
vehemence. "I could not. My lady would not understand. She has
become&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;very English. Marguerite St.
Just would understand...Lady Blakeney&mdash;no?"</p>

<p>"What would Lady Blakeney not understand?"</p>

<p>"<i>Eh bien</i>! About Bertrand Moncrif."</p>

<p>"Ah?"</p>

<p>"You think I did harm to the boy...I know...you took him away
from me...You! The Scarlet Pimpernel!...You see, I know! I know
everything! Chauvelin told me..."</p>

<p>"And guided you most dexterously to my door," he concluded with
a pleasant laugh. "There to enact a delicious comedy of
gruff-voiced bully and pathetic victim of merciless persecution. It
was all excellently done! Allow me to offer you my sincere
congratulations!"</p>

<p>She said nothing for a moment or two, then queried abruptly:</p>

<p>"You think that I am here in order to spy upon you?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" he riposted lightly, "how could I be so presumptuous as to
suppose that the beautiful Cabarrus would bestow attention on so
unworthy an object as I?"</p>

<p>"'Tis you now, milor," she rejoined drily, "who choose to play a
rôle. A truce on it, I pray you; and rather tell me what you mean
to do."</p>

<p>To this query he gave no reply, and his silence appeared to
grate on Theresia's nerves, for she went on harshly:</p>

<p>"You will betray me to the police, of course. And as I am here
without papers&mdash;"</p>

<p>He put up his hand with that gently deprecating gesture which
was habitual to him.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he said, with his quiet little laugh, "why should you think
I would do anything so unchivalrous?"</p>

<p>"Unchivalrous?" she retorted with a pathetic sigh of weariness.
"I suppose, here in England, it would be called an act of
patriotism or self-preservation...like fighting an enemy...or
denouncing a spy&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused a moment or two, and as he once more took refuge in
silence, she resumed with sudden, moving passion:</p>

<p>"So it is to be a betrayal after all! The selling of an
unfortunate woman to her bitterest enemy! Oh, what wrong have I
ever done you, that you should persecute me thus?"</p>

<p>"Persecute you?" he exclaimed. "Pardi, Madame; but this is a
subtle joke which by your leave my dull wits are unable to
fathom."</p>

<p>"It is no joke, milor," she rejoined earnestly. "Will you let me
explain? For indeed it seems to me that we are at cross purposes,
you and I."</p>

<p>She came to a halt, and he perforce had to do likewise. They had
come almost to the end of the little lane; a few yards farther on
it debouched on the main road. Beyond that, the lights of Dover
Town and the Harbour lights glinted in the still, starry night.
Behind them the lane, sunk between grassy slopes and overhung by
old elms of fantastic shapes, appeared dark and mysterious. But
here, where they stood, the moon shed its full radiance on the
broad highway, the clump of copper beeches over on the left, that
tiny cottage with its thatched roof nestling at the foot of the
cliff; and far away, on the picturesque mass of Dover Castle, the
church and towers. Every bit of fencing, every tiny twig in the
hawthorn hedges, stood out clear cut, sharp like metal in the cold,
searching light. Theresia&mdash;divinely slender and divinely tall,
graceful despite the rough masculine clothes which she
wore&mdash;stood boldly in the full light; the tendrils of her jet
black hair were gently stirred by an imperceptible breeze, her
eyes, dark and luminous, were fixed upwards at the man whom she had
set out to subjugate.</p>

<p>"That boy," she went on quite gently, "Bertrand Moncrif, was
just a young fool. But I liked him, and I could see the abyss to
which his folly was tending. There was never anything but
friendship between us; but I knew that sooner or later he would run
his head into a noose, and then what good would his pasty-faced
sweetheart have been to him? Whilst I&mdash;I had friends,
influence&mdash;quoi? And I liked the boy; I was sorry for him.
Then the catastrophe came...the other night. There was what those
ferocious beasts over in Paris were pleased to call a Fraternal
Supper. Bertrand Moncrif was there. Like a young fool, he started
to vilify Robespierre&mdash;Robespierre, who is the idol of France!
There!&mdash;in the very midst of the crowd! They would have torn
him limb from limb, it seems. I don't know just what happened, for
I wasn't there; but he came to my apartment&mdash;at
midnight&mdash;dishevelled&mdash;his clothes torn&mdash;more dead
than alive. I gave him shelter; I tended him. Yes, I!&mdash;even
whilst Robespierre and his friends were in my house, and I risked
my life every moment that Bertrand was under my roof! Chauvelin
suspected something then. Oh, I knew it! Those awful pale, deep-set
eyes of his seemed to be searching my soul all the time! At which
precise moment you came and took Bertrand away, I know not. But
Chauvelin knew. He saw&mdash;he saw, I tell you! He had not been
with us the whole time, but in and out of the apartment on some
pretext or other. Then, after the others had left, he came back,
accused me of having harboured not only Bertrand, but the Scarlet
Pimpernel himself!&mdash;swore that I was in league with the
English spies and had arranged with them to smuggle my lover out of
the house. Then he went away. He did not threaten. You know him as
well as I do. Threatening is not his way. But from his look I knew
that I was doomed. Luckily I had François. We packed up my few
belongings then and there. I left my woman Pepita in charge, and I
fled. As for the rest, I swear to you that it all happened just as
I told it to milady. You say you do not believe me. Very well! Will
you then take me away from this sheltered land, which I have
reached after terrible sufferings? Will you send me back to France,
and drive me to the arms of a man who but waits to throw me into
the tumbril with the next batch of victims for the guillotine? You
have the power to do it, of course. You are in England; you are
rich, influential, a power in your own country; whilst I am an
alien, a political enemy, a refugee, penniless and friendless. You
can do with me what you will, of course. But if you do <i>that</i>,
milor, my blood will stain your hands for ever; and all the good
you and your League have ever done in the cause of humanity will be
wiped out by this execrable crime."</p>

<p>She spoke very quietly and with soul-moving earnestness. So was
also exquisitely beautiful. Sir Percy Blakeney had been more than
human if he had been proof against such an appeal, made by such
perfect lips. Nature itself spoke up for Theresia: the softness and
stillness of the night; the starlit sky and the light of the moon;
the scent of wood violets and of wet earth, and the patter of tiny,
mysterious feet in the hedgerows. And the man whose whole life was
consecrated to the relief of suffering humanity and whose ears were
for ever strained to hear the call of the weak and of the
innocent&mdash;he could far, far sooner have believed that this
beautiful woman was speaking the truth, rather than allow his
instinct of suspicion, his keen sense of what was untrustworthy and
dangerous, to steel his heart against her appeal.</p>

<p>But whatever his thoughts might be, when she paused, wearied and
shaken with sobs which she vainly tried to suppress, he spoke to
her quite gently.</p>

<p>"Believe me, dear lady," he said, "that I had no thought of
wronging you when I owned to disbelieving your story. I have seen
so many strange things in the course of my chequered career that,
in verity, I ought to know by now how unbelievable truth often
appears."</p>

<p>"Had you known me better, milor&mdash;" she began.</p>

<p>"Ah, that is just it!" he rejoined quaintly. "I did not know
you, Madame. And now, meseems, that Fate has intervened, and that I
shall never have the chance of knowing you."</p>

<p>"How is that?" she asked.</p>

<p>But to this he gave no immediate answer, suggested
irrelevantly:</p>

<p>"Shall we walk on? It is getting late."</p>

<p>She gave a little cry, as if startled out of a dream, then
started to walk by his side with her long, easy stride, so full of
sinuous grace. They went on in silence for awhile, down the main
road now. Already they had passed the first group of town houses,
and <i>The Running Footman</i>, which is the last inn outside the
town. There was only the High Street now to follow and the Old
Place to cross, and <i>The Fisherman's Rest</i> would be in
sight.</p>

<p>"You have not answered my question, milor," Theresia said
presently.</p>

<p>"What question, Madame?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I asked you how Fate could intervene in the matter of our
meeting again."</p>

<p>"Oh!" he retorted simply. "You are staying in England, you tell
me."</p>

<p>"If you will deign to grant me leave," she said, with gentle
submission.</p>

<p>"It is not in my power to grant or to refuse."</p>

<p>"You will not betray me&mdash;to the police?"</p>

<p>"I have never betrayed a woman in my life."</p>

<p>"Or to Lady Blakeney?"</p>

<p>He made no answer.</p>

<p>"Or to Lady Blakeney?" she insisted.</p>

<p>Then, as he still gave no answer, she began to plead with
passionate earnestness.</p>

<p>"What could she gain&mdash;or you&mdash;by her knowing that I am
that unfortunate, homeless waif, without kindred and without
friends, Theresia Cabarrus&mdash;the beautiful Cabarrus!&mdash;once
the fiancée of the great Tallien, now suspect of trafficking with
her country's enemies in France...and suspect of being a suborned
spy in England!...My God, where am I to go? What am I to do? Do not
tell Lady Blakeney, milor! On my knees I entreat you, do not tell
her! She will hate me&mdash;fear me&mdash;despise me! Oh, give me a
chance to be happy! Give me&mdash;a chance&mdash;to be happy!"</p>

<p>Again she had paused and placed her hand on his arm. Once more
she was looking up at him, her eyes glistening with tears, her full
red lips quivering with emotion. And he returned her appealing,
pathetic glance for a moment or two in silence; then suddenly,
without any warning, he threw back his head and laughed.</p>

<p>"By Gad!" he exclaimed. "But you are a clever woman!"</p>

<p>"Milor!" she protested, indignant.</p>

<p>"Nay: you need have no fear, fair one! I am a lover of sport.
I'll not betray you."</p>

<p>She frowned, really puzzled this time.</p>

<p>"I do not understand," she murmured.</p>

<p>"Let us get back to <i>The Fisherman's Rest</i>," he retorted
with characteristic irrelevance. "Shall we?"</p>

<p>"Milor," she insisted, "will you explain?"</p>

<p>"There is nothing to explain, dear lady. You have asked
me&mdash;nay! challenged me&mdash;not to betray you to anyone, not
even to Lady Blakeney. Very well! I accept your challenge. That is
all."</p>

<p>"You will not tell anyone&mdash;anyone, mind you!&mdash;that Mme
de Fontenay and Theresia Cabarrus are one and the same?"</p>

<p>"You have my word for that."</p>

<p>She drew a scarce perceptible sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"Very well then, milor," she rejoined. "Since I am allowed to go
to London, we shall meet there, I hope."</p>

<p>"Scarcely, dear lady," he replied, "since I go to France
to-morrow."</p>

<p>This time she gave a little gasp, quickly suppressed&mdash;for
she hoped milor had not noticed.</p>

<p>"You go to France to-morrow, milor?" she asked.</p>

<p>"As I had the honour to tell you, I go to France to-morrow, and
I leave you a free hand to come and go as you please."</p>

<p>She chose not to notice the taunt; but suddenly, as if moved by
an uncontrollable impulse, she said resolutely:</p>

<p>"If you go, I shall go too."</p>

<p>"I am sure you will, dear lady," he retorted with a smile. "So
there really is no reason why we should linger here. Our mutual
friend M. Chauvelin must be impatient to hear the result of this
interview."</p>

<p>She gave a cry of horror and indignation.</p>

<p>"Oh! You&mdash;you still think <i>that</i> of <i>me?</i>"</p>

<p>He stood there, smiling, looking down on her with that
half-amused, lazy glance of his. He did not actually say anything,
but she felt that she had her answer. With a moan of pain, like a
child who has been badly hurt, she turned abruptly, and burying her
face in her hands she sobbed as if her heart would break. Sir Percy
waited quietly for a moment or two, until the first paroxysm of
grief had quieted down, and he said gently:</p>

<p>"Madame, I entreat you to compose yourself and to dry your
tears. If I have wronged you in my thoughts, I humbly crave your
pardon. I pray you to understand that when a man holds human lives
in his hands, when he is responsible for the life and safety of
those who trust in him, he must be doubly cautious and in his turn
trust no one. You have said yourself that now at last in this game
of life and death, which I and my friends have played so
successfully these last three years, I hold the losing cards. Then
must I watch every trick all the more closely, for a sound player
can win through the mistakes of his opponent, even if he hold a
losing hand."</p>

<p>But she refused to be comforted.</p>

<p>"You will never know, milor&mdash;never&mdash;how deeply you
have wounded me," she said through her tears. "And I, who for
months past&mdash;ever since I knew!&mdash;have dreamed of seeing
the Scarlet Pimpernel one day! He was the hero of my dreams, the
man who stood alone in the mass of self-seeking, vengeful, cowardly
humanity as the personification of all that was fine and
chivalrous. I longed to see him&mdash;just once&mdash;to hold his
hand&mdash;to look into his eyes&mdash;and feel a better woman for
the experience. Love? It was not love I felt, but hero-worship,
pure as one's love for a starlit night or a spring morning, or a
sunset over the hills. I dreamed of the Scarlet Pimpernel, milor;
and because of my dreams, which were too vital for perfect
discretion, I had to flee from home, suspected, vilified, already
condemned. Chance brings me face to face with the hero of my
dreams, and he looks on me as that vilest thing on earth: a
spy!&mdash;a woman who could lie to a man first and send him
afterwards to his death!"</p>

<p>Her voice, though more passionate and intense, had nevertheless
become more steady. She had at last succeeded in controlling her
tears. Sir Percy had listened&mdash;quite quietly, as was his
wont&mdash;to her strange words. There was nothing that he could
say to this beautiful woman who was so ingenuously avowing her love
for him. It was a curious situation, and in truth he did not relish
it&mdash;would have given quite a great deal to see it end as
speedily as possible. Theresia, fortunately, was gradually gaining
the mastery over her own feelings. She dried her eyes, and after a
moment or two, of her own accord, she started once more on her
way.</p>

<p>Nor did they speak again with one another until they were under
the porch of <i>The Fisherman's Rest</i>. Then Theresia stopped,
and with a perfectly simple gesture she held out her hand to Sir
Percy.</p>

<p>"We may never meet again on this earth, milor," she said
quietly. "Indeed, I shall pray to le bon Dieu to keep me clear of
your path."</p>

<p>He laughed good-humouredly.</p>

<p>"I very much doubt, dear lady," he said, "that you will be in
earnest when you utter that prayer!"</p>

<p>"You choose to suspect me, milor; and I'll no longer try to
combat your mistrust. But to one more word you must listen:
Remember the fable of the lion and the mouse. The invincible
Scarlet Pimpernel might one day need the help of Theresia Cabarrus.
I would wish you to believe that you can always count on it."</p>

<p>She extended her hand to him, and he took it, the while his
inveterately mocking glance challenged her earnest one. After a
moment or two he stooped and kissed her finger-tips.</p>

<p>"Let me rather put it differently, dear lady," he said. "One day
the exquisite Theresia Cabarrus&mdash;the Egeria of the Terrorists,
the fiancée of the Great Tallien&mdash;might need the help of the
League of the Scarlet Pimpernel."</p>

<p>"I would sooner die than seek your help, milor," she protested
earnestly.</p>

<p>"Here in Dover, perhaps...but in France?...And you said you were
going back to France, in spite of Chauvelin and his pale eyes, and
his suspicions of you."</p>

<p>"Since you think so ill of me," she retorted, "why should you
offer me your help?"</p>

<p>"Because," he replied lightly, "with the exception of my friend
Chauvelin, I have never had so amusing an enemy; and it would
afford me intense satisfaction to render you a signal service."</p>

<p>"You mean, that you would risk your life to save mine?"</p>

<p>"No. I should not risk my life, dear lady," he said with his
puzzling smile. "But I should&mdash;God help me!&mdash;do my best,
if the need arose, to save yours."</p>

<p>After which, with another ceremonious bow, he took final leave
of her, and she was left standing there, looking after his tall,
retreating figure until the turn of the street hid him from
view.</p>

<p>Who could have fathomed her thoughts and feelings at that
moment? No one, in truth; not even herself. Theresia Cabarrus had
met many men in her day, subjugated and fooled not a few. But she
had never met anyone like this before. At one moment she had
thought she had him: he appeared moved, serious, compassionate,
gave her his word that he would not betray her; and in that word,
her unerring instinct&mdash;the instinct of the adventuress, the
woman who succeeds by her wits as well by her charm&mdash;told her
that she could trust. Did he fear her, or did he not? Did he
suspect her? Theresia could not say. She had no experience of such
men. As for the word "sport," she hardly knew its meaning; and yet
he had talked of not betraying her because he was "a lover of
sport"! It was all very puzzling; very mysterious.</p>

<p>For a long while she remained standing in the porch. From the
square bay window on her right came the sound of laughter and
chatter, issuing from the coffee-room, whilst one or two noisy
groups of sailors and their girls passed her by, singing and
laughing, down the street. But in the porch, where she stood, the
noisy world appeared distant, as if she were alone in one of her
own creation. She could, just by closing her eyes and ears to the
life around her, imagine she could still hear the merry, lazy,
drawling voice of the man she had set out to punish. She could
still see his tall figure and humorous face, with those heavy eyes
that lit up now and again with a strange, mysterious light, and the
firm lips every ready to break into a smile. She could still see
the man who so loved sport that he swore not to betray her, and
risked the chance, in his turn, of falling into a trap.</p>

<p>Well! he had defied and insulted her. The letter which he left
for her after he had smuggled Bertrand Moncrif out of her
apartment, rankled and stung her pride as nothing had ever done
before. Therefore the man must be punished, and in a manner that
would leave no doubt in his mind as to whence came the blow that
struck him. But it was all going to be very much more difficult
than the beautiful Theresia Cabarrus had allowed herself to
believe.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>Chapter XVII&mdash;Reunion</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>It was a thoughtful Theresia who turned into the narrow hall of
<i>The Fisherman's Rest</i> a few moments later. The inn, when she
left it earlier in the evening, had still been all animation and
bustle consequent on the arrival of their lordships with the party
of ladies and gentlemen over from France, and the excitement of
making all these grand folk comfortable for the night. Theresia
Cabarrus, in her disguise as a young stowaway, had only aroused
passing interest&mdash;refugees of every condition and degree were
frequent enough in these parts&mdash;and when awhile ago she had
slipped out in order to enact the elaborate rôle devised by her and
Chauvelin, she had done so unperceived. Since then, no doubt there
had been one or two cursory questions about the mysterious
stowaway, who had been left to feed and rest in the tiny
living-room; but equally no doubt, interest in him waned quickly
when it was discovered that he had gone, without as much as
thanking those who had befriended him.</p>

<p>The travellers from France had long since retired to their
rooms, broken with fatigue after the many terrible experiences they
had gone through. The young English gallants had gone, either to
friends in the neighbourhood or&mdash;in the case of Sir Andrew
Ffoulkes and Lord Anthony Dewhurst&mdash;ridden away in the early
part of the evening, so as to reach Ashford mayhap or Maidstone
before nightfall, and thus lessen the distance which still
separated them from the loved ones at home.</p>

<p>A good deal of noise and laughter was still issuing from the
coffee-room. Through the glass door Theresia could see the habitués
of <i>The Fisherman's Rest</i>&mdash;yokels and
fisherfolk&mdash;sitting over their ale, some of them playing cards
or throwing dice. Mine host was there too, engaged as usual in
animated discussion with some privileged guests who sat in the
ingle-nook.</p>

<p>Theresia slipped noiselessly past the glass door. Straight in
front of her a second passage ran at right angles; two or three
steps led up to it. She tip-toed up these, and then looked about
her, trying to reconstruct in her mind the disposition of the
various rooms. On her left a glass partition divided the passage
from the small parlour wherein she had found shelter on her
arrival. On her right the passage obviously led to the kitchen, for
much noise of crockery and shrill feminine voices and laughter came
from there.</p>

<p>For a moment Theresia hesitated. Her original intention had been
to find Mistress Waite and see if a bed for the night were still
available; but a slight noise or movement issuing from the parlour
caused her to turn. She peeped through the glass partition. The
room was dimly lighted by a small oil-lamp which hung from the
ceiling. A fire still smouldered in the hearth, and beside it,
sitting on a low stool staring into the embers, his hands held
between his knees, was Bertrand Moncrif.</p>

<p>Theresia Cabarrus had some difficulty in smothering the cry of
surprise which had risen to her throat. Indeed, for the moment she
thought that the dim light and her own imaginative fancy was
playing her a fantastic trick. The next, she had opened the door
quite noiselessly and slipped into the room. Bertrand had not
moved. Apparently he had not heart; or if he had cursorily glanced
up, he had disdained to notice the roughly clad fellow who was
disturbing his solitude. Certain it is that he appeared absorbed in
gloomy meditations; whilst Theresia, practical and deliberate, drew
the curtains together that hung in front of the glass partition,
and thus made sure that intruding eyes could not catch her
unawares. Then she murmured softly:</p>

<p>"Bertrand!"</p>

<p>He woke as from a dream, looked up and saw her. He passed a
shaking hand once or twice across his forehead, then suddenly
realized that she was actually there, near him, in the flesh. A
hoarse cry escaped him, and the next moment he was down on his
knees at her feet, his arms around her, his face buried in the
folds of her mantle.</p>

<p>Everything&mdash;anxiety, sorrow, even surprise&mdash;was
forgotten in the joy of seeing her. He was crying like a child, and
murmuring her name in the intervals of covering her knees, her
hands, her feet in their rough boots with kisses. She stood there,
quite still, looking down on him, yielding her hands to his
caresses. Around her full red lips there was an undefinable smile;
but the light in her eyes was certainly one of triumph.</p>

<p>After awhile he rose, and she allowed him to lead her to an
arm-chair by the hearth. She sat down, and he knelt at her feet
with one arm around her waist, and his head against her breast. He
had never in his life been quite so exquisitely happy. This was not
the imperious Theresia, impatient and disdainful, as she had been
of late&mdash;cruel even sometimes, as on that last evening when he
thought he would never see her again. It was the Theresia in the
early days in Paris, when first she came back from Bordeaux, with a
reputation for idealism as well as for beauty and wit, and with a
gracious acceptance of his homage which had completely subjugated
him.</p>

<p>She insisted on hearing every detail of his escape out of Paris
and out of France, under the protection of the League of the
Scarlet Pimpernel. In truth, he did not know who his rescuer was.
He remembered but little of that awful night when, after the
terrible doings at the Fraternal Supper, he had sought refuge in
her apartment and then realized that, like a criminal and selfish
fool, he was compromising her precious life by remaining under her
roof.</p>

<p>He had resolved to go as soon as he was able to
stand&mdash;resolved if need be to give himself up at the nearest
Poste de Section, when in a semi-conscious state he became aware
that some one was in the room with him. He had not the time or the
power to rouse himself and to look about, when a cloth was thrown
over his face and he felt himself lifted off the chair bodily and
carried away by powerful arms, whither he knew not.</p>

<p>After that, a great deal had happened&mdash;it all seemed indeed
like a dream. At one time he was with Régine de Serval in a coach,
at others with her brother Jacques, in a hut at night, lying on
straw, trying to get some sleep, and tortured with thoughts of
Theresia and fear for her safety. There were halts and delays, and
rushes through the night. He himself was quite dazed, felt like a
puppet that was dragged hither and thither in complete
unconsciousness. Régine was constantly with him. She did her best
to comfort him, would try to wile away the weary hours in the coach
or in various hiding-places by holding his hand and talking of the
future&mdash;the happy future in England, when they would have a
home of their own, secure from the terrors of the past two years,
peaceful in complete oblivion of the cruel past. Happy and
peaceful! My God! As if there could be any happiness or peace for
him, away from the woman he worshipped!</p>

<p>Theresia listened to the tale, for the most part in silence.
From time to time she would stroke his hair and forehead with her
cool, gentle hand. She did ask one or two questions, but these
chiefly on the subject of his rescuer: Had he seen him? Had he seen
any of the English gentlemen who effected his escape?</p>

<p>Oh, yes! Bertrand saw a good deal of the three or four young
gallants who accompanied him and the party all the way from Paris.
He only saw the last of them here, in this inn, a few hours ago.
One of them gave him some money to enable him to reach London in
comfort. They were very kind, entirely unselfish. Mme de Serval,
Régine, and the others were overwhelmed with gratitude, and oh, so
happy! Joséphine and Jacques had forgotten all about their duty to
their country in their joy at finding themselves united and safe in
this new land.</p>

<p>But the Scarlet Pimpernel himself, Theresia insisted, trying to
conceal her impatience under a veneer of tender
solicitude&mdash;had Bertrand seen him?</p>

<p>"No!" Bertrand replied. "I never once set eyes on him, though it
was he undoubtedly who dragged me helpless out of your apartment.
The others spoke of him&mdash;always as 'the chief.' They seemed to
reverence him. He must be fine and brave. Régine and her mother and
the two young ones have learned to worship him. Small wonder!
seeing what he did for them at that awful Fraternal Supper."</p>

<p>"What did he do?" Theresia queried.</p>

<p>And the story had to be told by Bertrand, just as he had had it
straight from Régine. The asthmatic coal-heaver&mdash;the
quarrel&mdash;Robespierre's arrival on the scene&mdash;the
shouts&mdash;the mob. The terror of that awful giant who had
dragged them into the empty house, and there left them in the care
of others scarce less brave than himself. Then the
disguises&mdash;the wanderings through the streets&mdash;the
deathly anxiety at the gates of the city&mdash;the final escape in
a laundry cart. Miracles of self-abnegation! Wonders of ingenuity
and of daring! What wonder that the name of the Scarlet Pimpernel
was one to be revered!</p>

<p>"On my knees will I pay homage to him," Bertrand concluded
fervently; "since he brought you to my arms!"</p>

<p>She had him by the shoulders, held him from her at arm's length,
whilst she looked&mdash;inquiring, slightly mocking&mdash;into his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Brought me to your arms, Bertrand?" she said slowly. "What do
you mean?"</p>

<p>"You are here, Theresia," he riposted. "Safe in
England...through the agency of the Scarlet Pimpernel."</p>

<p>She gave a hard, mirthless laugh.</p>

<p>"Aye!" she said drily; "through his agency. But not as you
imagine, Bertrand."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"The Scarlet Pimpernel, my friend, after he had dragged you away
from the shelter which you had found under my roof, sent an
anonymous denunciation of me to the nearest Roste de Section, as
having harboured the traitor Moncrif and conspiring with him to
assassinate Robespierre whilst the latter was in my apartment."</p>

<p>Bertrand uttered a cry of horror.</p>

<p>"Impossible!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"The chief Commissary of the Section," she went on glibly,
earnestly&mdash;never taking her eyes off his, "at risk of his
life, gave me warning. Aided by him and a faithful servant, I
contrived to escape&mdash;out of Paris first, then across country
in the amidst of unspeakable misery, and finally out of the country
into an open boat, until I was picked up by a chance vessel and
brought to this inn more dead than alive."</p>

<p>She fell back against the cushion of the chair, her sinuous body
shaken with sobs. Bertrand, speechless with horror, could but try
and soothe his beloved as she had soothed him a while ago, when
past terrors and past bitter experiences had unmanned him. After a
while she became more calm, contrived to smile through her
tears.</p>

<p>"You see, Bertrand, that your gallant Scarlet Pimpernel is as
merciless in hate as he is selfless in love."</p>

<p>"But why?" the young man ejaculated vehemently. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Why he should hate me?" she rejoined with a pathetic little
sigh and a shrug of the shoulders. "<i>Chien sabe</i>, my friend!
Of course, he does not know that of late&mdash;ever since I have
gained the regard of citizen Tallien&mdash;my life has been devoted
to intervening on behalf of the innocent victims of our revolution.
I suppose he takes me for the friend and companion of all those
ruthless Terrorists whom he abhors. He has forgotten what I did in
Bordeaux, and how I risked my life there, and did so daily in Paris
for the sake of those whom he himself befriends. It may all be a
question of misunderstanding," she added, with gentle resignation,
"but 'tis one that wellnigh did cost me my life."</p>

<p>Bertrand folded her in his arms, held her against him, as if to
shield her with his body against every danger. It was his turn now
to comfort and to console, and she rested her head against his
shoulder&mdash;a perfect woman rather than an unapproachable
divinity, giving him through her weakness more exquisite bliss than
he had ever dreamed of before. The minutes sped on, winged with
happiness, and time was forgotten in the infinity of joy.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>Theresia was the first to rouse herself from this dream of
happiness and oblivion. She glanced up at the clock. It was close
upon ten. Confused, adorable, she jumped to her feet.</p>

<p>"You will ruin my reputation, Bertrand," she said with a smile,
"thus early in a strange land!"</p>

<p>She would arrange with the landlord's daughter, she said, about
a bed for herself, as she was very tired. What did he mean to
do?</p>

<p>"Spend the night in this room," he replied, "if mine host will
let me. I could have such happy dreams here! These four walls will
reflect your exquisite image, and 'tis your dear face will smile
down on me ere I close mine eyes in sleep."</p>

<p>She had some difficulty in escaping from his clinging arms, and
'twas only the definite promise that she gave him to come back in a
few minutes and let him know what she had arranged, that ultimately
enabled him to let her go. Even so, he felt inexpressibly sad when
she went, watched her retreating figure, so supple and so quaint in
the rough, masculine clothes and the heavy mantle, as she walked
resolutely down the passage in the direction of the kitchen. From
the coffee-room there still came the sound of bustle and of
merriment; but this little room seemed so peaceful, so
remote&mdash;a shrine, now that his goddess had hallowed it by her
presence.</p>

<p>Bertrand drew a deep sigh, partly of happiness, partly of utter
weariness. He was more tired than he knew. She had promised to come
back and say good night...in a few minutes...But the minutes seemed
leaden-footed now...and he was half-dead with fatigue. He threw
himself down on the hard, uncomfortable horsehair sofa, whereon he
hoped to pass the night if the landlord would let him, and glanced
up at the clock. Only three minutes since she had gone...of course
she would not be long...only a few more minutes...a very few...He
closed his eyes, for the lids felt heavy...of a surety he would
hear her come...</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>Chapter XVIII&mdash;Night and
Morning</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>Theresia waited for a moment or two at the turn of the passage,
until her keen ear had told her that Bertrand was no longer on the
watch and had closed the door behind him. Then she retraced her
steps&mdash;on tiptoe, lest he should hear.</p>

<p>She found her way to the front door; it was still on the latch.
She opened it and peered out into the night. The little porch was
deserted, but out there on the quay a few passers-by still livened
the evening with chatter or song. Theresia was on the point of
steeping out of the porch, when a familiar voice hailed her softly
by name:</p>

<p>"Citoyenne Cabarrus!"</p>

<p>A man, dressed in dark clothes, with high boots and sugar-loaf
hat, came out from the dark angle behind the porch.</p>

<p>"Not here!" Theresia whispered eagerly. "Out on the quay. Wait
for me there, my little Chauvelin. I'll be with you anon. I have so
much to tell you!"</p>

<p>Silently, he did as she desired. She waited for a moment in the
porch, watching the meagre figure in the dark cloak making its way
across to the quay, then walking rapidly in the direction of the
Pent. The moon was dazzlingly brilliant. The harbour and the
distant sea glistened like diamond-studded sheets of silver. From
afar there came the sound of the castle clock striking ten. The
groups of passers-by had dwindled down to an occasional amorous
couple strolling homewards, whispering soft nothings and gazing
enraptured at the moon; or half-a-dozen sailors lolling down the
quays arm in arm, on their way back to their ship, obstructing the
road, yelling and singing the refrain of the newest ribald song; or
perhaps a belated pedlar, weary of an unprofitable beat, wending
his way dejectedly home.</p>

<p>One of these poor wretches&mdash;a cripple with a wooden leg and
bent nearly doubt with the heavy load on his back&mdash;paused for
a moment beside the porch, held out a grimy hand to Theresia, with
a pitiable cry.</p>

<p>"Of your charity, kind sir! Buy a little something from the pore
ole man, to buy a bit of bread!"</p>

<p>He looked utterly woebegone, with lank grey hair blown about by
the breeze and a colourless face covered with sweat, that shone
like painted metal in the moon-light.</p>

<p>"Buy a little something, kind sir!" he went on, in a shrill,
throaty voice. "I've a sick wife at 'ome, and pore little
gran'childen!"</p>

<p>Theresia&mdash;a little frightened, and not at all charitably
inclined at this hour&mdash;turned hastily away and went back into
the house, whither the cripple's vigorous curses followed her.</p>

<p>"May Satan and all his armies&mdash;"</p>

<p>She shut the door on him and hastened up the passage. That
cadaverous old reprobate had caused her to shudder as with the
presentiment of coming evil.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>With infinite precaution, Theresia peeped into the room where
she had left Bertrand. She saw him lying on the sofa, fast
asleep.</p>

<p>On the table in the middle of the room there was an old
ink-horn, a pen, and few loose sheets of paper. Noiseless as a
mouse, Theresia slipped into the room, sat at the table, and
hurriedly wrote a few lines. Bertrand had not moved. Having written
her missive, Theresia folded it carefully, and still on tiptoe,
more stealthily even than before, she slipped the paper between the
young man's loosely clasped fingers. Then, as soundlessly as she
had come, she glided out of the room, ran down the passage, and was
out in the porch once more, breathless but relieved.</p>

<p>Bertrand had not moved; and no one had seen her. Theresia only
paused in the porch long enough to recover her breath, then,
without hesitation and with rapid strides, she crossed over to the
water's edge and walked along in the direction of the Pent.</p>

<p>Whereupon, the figure of the old cripple emerged from out the
shadows. He gazed after the fast retreating figure of Theresia for
a moment or two, then threw down his load, straightened out his
back, and stretched out his arms from the shoulders with a sigh of
content. After which amazing proceedings he gave a soft, inward
chuckle, unstrapped his wooden leg, slung it with his discarded
load across his broad shoulders, and turning his back upon harbour
and sea, turned up the High Street and strode rapidly away.</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>When Bertrand Moncrif woke, the dawn was peeping in through the
uncurtained window. He felt cold and stiff. It took him some time
to realize where he was, to collect his scattered senses. He had
been dreaming...here in this room...Theresia had been here...and
she had laid her head against his breast and allowed him to soothe
and comfort her. Then she said that she would come back...and
he...like a fool...had fallen asleep.</p>

<p>He jumped up, fully awake now; and as he did so a folded scrap
of paper fell out of his hand. He had not known that it was there
when first he woke, and somehow it appeared to be a part of his
dream. As it lay there on the sanded floor at his feet, it looked
strangely ghostlike, ominous; and it was with a trembling hand
that, presently, he picked it up.</p>

<p>Every minute now brought fuller daylight into the room; a grey,
cold light, for the window faced the south-west, showing a wide
stretch of the tidal harbour and the open sea beyond. The sun, not
fully risen, had not yet shed warmth over the landscape, and to
Bertrand this colourless dawn, the mysterious stillness which earth
assumes just before it wakens to the sun's kiss, seemed
inexpressibly dreary and desolate.</p>

<p>He went to the window and threw open the casement. Down below, a
kitchen wench was busy scrubbing the flagged steps of the porch;
over in the inner harbour, one or two fishing vessels were
preparing to put out to sea; and from the tidal harbour, the
graceful yacht which yesterday had brought
him&mdash;Bertrand&mdash;and his friends safely to this land of
refuge, was majestically gliding out, like a beautiful swan with
gleaming wings outspread.</p>

<p>Controlling his apprehension, his nervousness, Bertrand at last
contrived to unfold the mysterious epistle. He read the few lines
that were traced with a delicate, feminine hand, and with a sigh of
infinite longing and of ardent passion, he pressed the paper to his
lips. Theresia had sent him a message. Finding him asleep, she had
slipped it into his hand. The marvel was that he did not wake when
she stooped over him, and perhaps even touched his forehead with
her lips.</p>

<p>"A kind soul," so the message ran, "hath taken compassion on me.
There was no room for me at the inn, and she has offered me a bed
in her cottage, somewhere close by. I do not know where it is. I
have arranged with the landlord that you shall be left undisturbed
in the small room where we found one another, and where the four
walls will whisper to you of me. Good night, my beloved! To-morrow
you will go to London with the de Servals. I will follow later. It
is better so. In London you will find me at the house of Mme de
Neafchateau, a friend of my father's who lives at No. 54 in the
Soho Square, and who offered me hospitality in the days when I
thought I might visit London for pleasure. She will receive me now
that I am poor and an exile. Come to me there. Until then my heart
will feed on the memory of your kiss."</p>

<p>The letter was signed "Theresia."</p>

<p>Bertrand pressed it time and again to his lips. Never in his
wildest dreams had he hoped for this; never even in those early
days of rapture had he tasted such perfect bliss. The letter he hid
against his breast. He was immeasurably happy, felt as if he were
treading on air. The sea, the landscape, no longer looked grey and
dreary. This was England, the land of the free, the land wherein he
had regained his beloved. Ah, the mysterious Scarlet Pimpernel,
while seeking ignoble vengeance against her, for sins which she
never had committed, did in truth render him and her a priceless
service. Theresia, courted, adulated, over in Paris, had been as
far removed from Bertrand Moncrif as the stars; but here, where she
was poor and lonely, a homeless refugee like himself, she turned
instinctively to the faithful lover, who would gladly die to ensure
her happiness.</p>

<p>With that letter in his possession, Bertrand felt that he could
not remain indoors. He was pining for open spaces, the sea, the
mountains, God's pure air&mdash;the air which she too was breathing
even now. He snatched up his hat and made his way out of the little
building. The kitchen wench paused in her scrubbing and looked up
smiling as he ran past her, singing and shouting for joy. For
Régine&mdash;the tender, loving heart that pined for him and for
his love&mdash;he had not a thought. She was the past, the dull,
drabby past wherein he had dwelt before he knew how glorious a
thing life could be, how golden the future, how rosy that horizon
far away.</p>

<p>By the time he reached the harbour, the sun had risen in all its
glory. Way out against the translucent sky, the graceful silhouette
of the schooner swayed gently in the morning breeze, her outspread
sails gleaming like wings that are tinged with gold. Bertrand
watched her for awhile. He thought of the mysterious Scarlet
Pimpernel and the hideous vengeance which he had wrought against
his beloved. And the rage which possessed his soul at the thought
obscured for a moment the beauty of the morning and the glory of
the sky. With a gesture characteristic of his blood and of his
race, he raised his fist and shook it in the direction of the
distant ship.</p>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>Chapter XIX&mdash;A Rencontre</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>For Marguerite, that wonderful May-day, like so many others
equally happy and equally wonderful, came to an end all too soon.
To dwell on those winged hours were but to record sorrow, anxiety,
a passionately resentment coupled with an equally passionate
acceptance of the inevitable. Her intimate friends often marvelled
how Marguerite Blakeney bore the strain of these constantly
recurring farewells. Every time that in the early dawn she twined
her loving arms round the neck of the man she worshipped, feeling
that mayhap she was looking into those dear, lazy, laughing eyes
for the last time on earth&mdash;every time, it seemed to her as if
earth could not hold greater misery.</p>

<p>Then after that came that terrible half-hour, whilst she stood
on the landing-stage&mdash;his kisses still hot upon her lips, her
eyes, her throat&mdash;and watched and watched that tiny speck,
that fast-sailing ship that bore him away on his errand of mercy
and self-sacrifice, leaving her lonely and infinitely desolate. And
then the days and hours, when he was away and it was her task to
smile and laugh, to appear to know nothing of her husband save that
he was a society butterfly, the pet of the salons, an exquisite,
something of a fool, whose frequent absences were accounted for by
deer-stalking in Scotland or fishing in the Tweed, or hunting in
the shires&mdash;anything and everything that would throw dust in
the eyes of the fashionable crowd of whom she and he formed an
integral part.</p>

<p>"Sir Percy not with you to-night, dear Lady Blakeney?"</p>

<p>"With me? Lud love you, no! I have not seen him these three
weeks past."</p>

<p>"The dog!"</p>

<p>People would talk and ask questions, throw out suggestions and
innuendoes. Society a few months ago had been greatly agitated
because the beautiful Lady Blakeney, the most fashionable woman
about town, had taken a mad fancy for&mdash;you'll never believe
it, my dear!&mdash;for her own husband. She had him by her side at
routs and river-parties, in her opera-box and on the Mall. It was
positively indecent! Sir Percy was the pet of Society, his sallies,
his inane laugh, his lazy, delicious, impertinent ways and his
exquisite clothes, made the success of every salon in which he
chose to appear. His Royal Highness was never so good-tempered as
when Sir Percy was by his side. Then, for his own wife to
monopolize him was preposterous, abnormal, extravagant! Some people
put it down to foreign eccentricity; others to Lady Blakeney's
shrewdness in thus throwing dust in the eyes of her none-too-clever
lord, in order to mask some intrigue or secret amour, of which
Society had not as yet the key.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the feelings of the fashionable world, this
phase of conjugal affection did not last long. It had been at its
height last year, and had waned perceptibly since. Of late, so it
was averred, Sir Percy was hardly ever at home, and his appearances
at Blakeney Manor&mdash;his beautiful house at Richmond&mdash;were
both infrequent and brief. He had evidently tried of playing second
fiddle to his exquisite wife, or been irritated by her caustic wit,
which she was wont to sharpen at his expense; and the ménage of
these two leaders of fashion had, in the opinion of those in the
know, once more resumed a more normal aspect.</p>

<p>When Lady Blakeney was in Richmond, London or Bath, Sir Percy
was shooting or fishing or yachting&mdash;which was just as it
should be. And when he appeared in society, smiling, elegant,
always an exquisite, Lady Blakeney would scarce notice him, save
for making him a butt for her lively tongue.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>What it cost Marguerite to keep up this rôle none but a very few
ever knew. The identity of one of the greatest heroes of this or
any time was known to his most bitter enemy&mdash;not to his
friends. So Marguerite went on smiling, joking, flirting, while her
heart ached and her brain was at times wellnigh numb with anxiety.
His intimates rallied round her, of course: the splendid little
band of heroes who formed the League of the Scarlet
Pimpernel&mdash;Sir Andrew Ffoulkes and his pretty wife; Lord
Anthony Dewhurst and his lady, whose great dark eyes still wore the
impress of the tragedy which had darkened the first month of her
happy wedded life. Then there was my lord Hastings; and Sir Evan
Cruche, the young Squire of Holt, and all the others.</p>

<p>And for the Prince of Wales, it is more than surmised by those
competent to judge that His Royal Highness did indeed guess at the
identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel, even if he had not actually been
apprised of it. Certain it is that his tact and discretion did on
more than one occasion save a situation which might have proved
embarrassing for Marguerite.</p>

<p>In all these friends then&mdash;in their conversation, their
happy laughter, their splendid pluck and equally splendid gaiety,
the echo of the chief whom they adored&mdash;Marguerite found just
the solace that she needed. With Lady Ffoulkes and Lady Anthony
Dewhurst she had everything in common. With those members of the
League who happened to be in England, she could talk over and in
her mind trace the various stages of the perilous adventure on
which her beloved and the others were even then engaged.</p>

<p>And there were always the memories of those all too brief days
at Dover or in Richmond, when her loving heart tasted such perfect
happiness as is granted only to the elect: the happiness that comes
from perfect love, perfect altruism, a complete understanding and
measureless sympathy. On those memories her hungering soul could
subsist in the intervals, and with them as her unalienable
property, she could even bid the grim spectre of unhappiness
begone.</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>Of Madame de Fontenay&mdash;for as such Marguerite still knew
her&mdash;she saw but little. Whether the beautiful Theresia had
gone to London or not, whether she had succeeded in finding her
truant husband, Marguerite did not know and cared less. The
unaccountable antipathy which she had felt on that first night of
her acquaintance with the lovely Spaniard still caused her to hold
herself aloof. Sir Percy, true to his word, had not betrayed the
actual identity of Theresia Cabarrus to his wife; but in his light,
insouciant manner had dropped a word or two of warning, which had
sharpened Marguerite's suspicions and strengthened her
determination to avoid Mme de Fontenay as far as possible. And
since monetary or other material help was apparently not required,
she had no reason to resume an intercourse which, in point of fact,
was not courted by Theresia either.</p>

<p>But one day, walking alone in Richmond Park, she came face to
face with Theresia. It was a beautiful late afternoon in July, the
end of a day which had been a comparatively happy one for
Marguerite&mdash;the day when a courier had come from France with
news of Sir Percy; a letter from him, telling her that he was well
and hinting at the possibility of another of those glorious days
together at Dover.</p>

<p>With that message from her beloved just to hand, Marguerite had
felt utterly unable to fulfill her social engagements in London.
There was nothing of any importance that claimed her presence. His
Royal Highness was at Brighton; the opera and the rout at Lady
Portarles' could well get on without her. The evening promised to
be more than ordinarily beautiful, with a radiant sunset and the
soft, sweet-scented air of a midsummer's evening.</p>

<p>After dinner, Marguerite had felt tempted to stroll out alone.
She threw a shawl over her head and stepped out on to the terrace.
The vista of velvet lawns, of shady paths and rose borders in full
bloom, stretched out into the dim distance before her; and beyond
these, the boundary wall, ivy-clad, overhung with stately limes,
and broken into by the finely wrought iron gates that gave straight
into the Park.</p>

<p>The shades of evening were beginning to draw in, and the garden
was assuming that subtle veil of mysterious melancholy which
perfect beauty always lends. In the stately elms far away, a
blackbird was whistling his evensong. The night was full of sweet
ordours&mdash;roses and heliotrope, lime and
mignonette&mdash;whilst just below the terrace a bed of white
tobacco swung ghost-like its perfumed censer into the air. Just an
evening to lure a lonely soul into the open, away from the
indifferent, the casual, into the heart of nature, always potent
enough to soothe and to console.</p>

<p class="cpb">4.</p>

<p>Marguerite strolled through the grounds with a light foot, and
anon reached the monumental gates, through which the exquisite
peace and leafy solitude of the Park seemed to beckon insistently
to her. The gate was on the latch; she slipped through and struck
down a woodland path bordered by tangled undergrowth and tall
bracken, and thus reached the pond, when suddenly she perceived Mme
de Fontenay.</p>

<p>Theresia was dressed in a clinging gown of diaphanous black
silk, which gave value to the exquisite creamy whiteness of her
skin and to the vivid crimson of her lips. She wore a transparent
shawl round her shoulders, which with the new-modish, high-waisted
effect of her gown, suited her sinuous grace to perfection. But she
wore no jewellery, no ornaments of any kind: only a magnificent red
rose at her breast.</p>

<p>The sight of her at this place and at this hour was so
unexpected that, to Marguerite's super-sensitive intuition, the
appearance of this beautiful woman, strolling listless and alone
beside the water's edge, seemed like a presage of evil. Her first
instinct had been to run away before Mme de Fontenay was aware of
her presence; but the next moment she chided herself for this
childish cowardice, and stood her ground, waiting for the other
woman to draw near.</p>

<p>A minute or two later, Theresia had looked up and in her turn
had perceived Marguerite. She did not seem surprised, rather came
forward with a glad little cry, and her two hands outstretched.</p>

<p>"Milady!" she exclaimed. "Ah, I see you at last! I have oft
wondered why we never met."</p>

<p>Marguerite took her hands, greeted her as warmly as she could.
Indeed she did her best to appear interested and sympathetic.</p>

<p>Mme de Fontenay had not much to relate. She had found refuge in
the French convent of the Assumption at Twickenham, where the
Mother Superior had been an intimate friend of her mother's in the
happy olden days. She went out very little, and never in society.
But she was fond of strolling in this beautiful Park. The sisters
had told her that Lady Blakeney's beautiful house was quite near.
She would have liked to call&mdash;but never dared&mdash;hoping for
a chance recontre which hitherto had never come.</p>

<p>She asked kindly after milor, and seemed to have heard a rumour
that he was at Brighton, in attendance on his royal friend. Of her
husband, Mme de Fontenay had as yet found no trace. He must be
living under an assumed name, she thought&mdash;not doubt in dire
poverty&mdash;Theresia feared it, but did not know&mdash;would give
worlds to find out.</p>

<p>Then she asked Lady Blakeney whether she knew aught of the de
Servals.</p>

<p>"I was so interested in them," she said, "because I had heard
something of them while I was in Paris, and seeing that we arrived
in England the same day, though under such different circumstances.
But we could not journey to London together, as you, milady, so
kindly suggested, because I was very ill the next day...Ah, can you
wonder?...A kind friend in Dover took care of me. But I remember
their name, and have oft marvelled if we should ever meet."</p>

<p>Yes; Marguerite did see the de Servals from time to time. They
rented a small cottage not very far from here&mdash;just outside of
town. One of the daughters, Régine, was employed all day at the
fashionable dress-maker's in Richmond. The younger girl, Joséphine,
and the boy, Jacques, was doing work in a notary's office. It was
all very dreary for them, but their courage was marvellous; and
though the children did not earn much, it was sufficient for their
wants.</p>

<p>Madame de Fontenay was vastly interested. She hoped that
Régine's marriage with the man of her choice would bring a ray of
real happiness into the household.</p>

<p>"I hope so too," Lady Blakeney assented.</p>

<p>"Milady has seen the young man&mdash;Régine's fiancé?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! once or twice. But he is engaged in business all day,
it seems. He is inclined to be morbid and none too full of ardour.
It is a pity; for Régine is a sweet girl and deserves
happiness."</p>

<p>"We have so much sorrow in common," she said with a pathetic
smile. "So many misfortunes. We ought to be friends."</p>

<p>Then she gave a slight little shiver.</p>

<p>"The weather is extraordinarily cold for July," she said. "Ah,
how one misses the glorious sunshine of France!"</p>

<p>She wrapped her thin, transparent shawl closer round her
shoulders. She was delicate, she explained. Always had been. She
was a child of the South, and fully expected the English climate
would kill her. In any case, it was foolish of her to stand thus
talking, when it was so cold.</p>

<p>After which she took her leave, with a gracious inclination of
the head and a cordial au revoir. Then she turned off into a small
path under the trees, cut through the growing bracken; and
Marguerite watched the graceful figure thoughtfully, until the
leafy undergrowth hid her from view.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>Chapter XX&mdash;Departure</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>The next morning's sun rose more radiant than before. Marguerite
greeted it with a sigh that was entirely a happy one. Another round
of the clock had brought her a little nearer to the time when she
would see her beloved. The next courier might indeed bring a
message naming the very day when she could rest once more in his
arms for a few brief hours, which were so like the foretaste of
heaven.</p>

<p>Soon after breakfast she ordered her coach, intending to go to
London in order to visit Lady Ffoulkes and give Sir Andrew the
message which was contained for him in Percy's last letter. Whilst
waiting for the coach, she strolled out into the garden, which was
gay with roses and blue larkspur, sweet william and heliotrope,
alive with a deafening chorus of blackbirds and thrushes, the
twittering of sparrows and the last call of the cuckoo. It was a
garden brimful of memories, filled in rich abundance with the image
of the man she worshipped. Every bird-song seemed to speak his name,
the soughing of the breeze amidst the trees seemed to hold the echo
of his voice; the perfume of thyme and mignonette to bring back the
savour of his kiss.</p>

<p>Then suddenly she became aware of hurrying footsteps on the
gravelled path close by. She turned, and saw a young man whom at
first she did not recognize, running with breathless haste towards
her. He was hatless, his linen crumpled, his coat-collar awry. At
sight of her he gave a queer cry of excitement and relief.</p>

<p>"Lady Blakeney! Thank God! Thank God!"</p>

<p>Then she recognized him. It was Bertrand Moncrif.</p>

<p>He fell on his knees and seized her gown. He appeared entirely
overwrought, unbalanced, and Marguerite tried in vain at first to
get a coherent word out of him. All that he kept on repeating
was:</p>

<p>"Will you help me? Will you help us all?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I will, if I can, M. Moncrif," Marguerite said gently.
"Do try and compose yourself and tell me what is amiss."</p>

<p>She persuaded him to rise, and presently to follow her to a
garden seat, where she sat down. He remained standing in front of
her. His eyes still looked wild and scared, and he passed a shaking
hand once or twice through his unruly hair. But he was obviously
making an effort to compose himself, and after a little while,
during which Marguerite waited with utmost patience, he began more
coherently:</p>

<p>"Your servants said, milady," he began more quietly, "that you
were in the garden. I could not wait until they called you, so I
ran to find you. Will you try and forgive me? I ought not to have
intruded."</p>

<p>"Of course I will forgive you," Marguerite rejoined with a
smile, "if you will only tell me what is amiss."</p>

<p>He paused a moment, then cried abruptly:</p>

<p>"Régine has gone!"</p>

<p>Marguerite frowned, puzzled, and murmured slowly, not
understanding:</p>

<p>"Gone? Whither?"</p>

<p>"To Dover," he replied, "with Jacques."</p>

<p>"Jacques?" she reiterated, still uncomprehending.</p>

<p>"Her brother," he rejoined. "You know the boy?"</p>

<p>Marguerite nodded.</p>

<p>"Hot-headed, impulsive," Moncrif went on, trying to speak
calmly. "He and the girl Joséphine always had it in their minds
that they were destined to liberate France from her present state
of anarchy and bloodshed."</p>

<p>"Like you yourself, M. Moncrif!" Marguerite put in with a
smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, I became sobered, reasonable, when I realized how futile it
all was. We all owe our lives to that noble Scarlet Pimpernel. They
were no longer ours to throw away. At least, that was my theory,
and Régine's. I have been engaged in business; and she works
hard...Oh, but you know!" he exclaimed impulsively.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know all your circumstances. But to the point, I pray
you!"</p>

<p>"Jacques of late has been very excited, feverish. We did not
know what was amiss. Régine and I oft spoke of him. And Mme de
Serval has been distraught with anxiety. She worships the boy. He
is her only son. But Jacques would not say what was amiss. He spoke
to no one. Went to his work every day as usual. Last night he did
not come home. A message came for Mme de Serval to say that a
friend in London had persuaded him to go to the play and spend the
night with him. Mme de Serval thought nothing of that. She was
pleased to think that Jacques had some amusement to distract him
from his brooding thoughts. But Régine, it seems, was not
satisfied. After her mother had gone to bed, she went into Jacque's
room; found some papers, it seems...letters...I know not...proof in
fact that the boy was even then on his way to Dover, having made
arrangements to take ship for France."</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu!" Marguerite exclaimed involuntarily. "What senseless
folly!"</p>

<p>"Ah! but that is not the worst. Folly, you say! But there is
worse folly still!"</p>

<p>With the same febrile movements that characterized his whole
attitude, he drew a stained and crumpled letter from his
pocket.</p>

<p>"She sent me this, this morning," he said. "That is why I came
to you."</p>

<p>"You mean Régine?" Marguerite asked, and took the letter which
he was handing to her.</p>

<p>"Yes! She must have brought it round herself...to my
lodgings...in the early dawn. I did not know what to do...whom to
consult...A blind instinct brought me here...I have no other
friend..."</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Marguerite was deciphering the letter, turning
a deaf ear to his ramblings.</p>

<p>"My Bertrand," so the letter ran, "Jacques is going to France.
Nothing will keep him back. He says it is his duty. I think that he
is mad, and I know that it will kill maman. So I go with him.
Perhaps at the last&mdash;at Dover&mdash;my tears and entreaties
might yet prevail. If not, and he puts this senseless project in
execution, I can watch over him there, and perhaps save him from
too glaring a folly. We go by coach to Dover, which starts in an
hour's time. Farewell, my beloved, and forgive me for causing you
the anxiety; but I feel that Jacques has more need of me than
you."</p>

<p>Below the signature "Régine de Serval" there were a few more
lines, written as if with an afterthought:</p>

<p>"I have told maman that my employer is sending me down into the
country about some dresses for an important customer, and that as
Jacques can get a few days' leave from his work, I am taking him
with me, for I feel the country air would do him good.</p>

<p>"Maman will be astonished and no doubt hurt that Jacques did not
send her word of farewell, but it is best that she should not learn
the truth too suddenly. If we do not return to Dover within the
week, you will have to break the news as gently as you can."</p>

<p>Whilst Marguerite read the letter, Bertrand had sunk upon the
seat and buried his head in his hands. He looked utterly dejected
and forlorn, and she felt a twinge of remorse at the thought of how she
had been wronging him all this while by doubting his love for
Régine. She placed a kindly hand on the young man's shoulder.</p>

<p>"What was your idea," she asked, "in coming to me? What can I
do?"</p>

<p>"Give me advice, milady!" he implored. "I am so helpless, so
friendless. When I had the letter, I could think of nothing at
first. You see, Régine and Jacques started early this morning, by
the coach from London, long before I had it. I thought you could
tell me what to do, how to overtake them. Régine loves me&mdash;oh,
she loves me! If I knelt at her feet I could bring her back. But
they are marked people, those two. The moment they attempt to enter
Paris, they will be recognized, arrested. Oh, my God! have mercy on
us all!"</p>

<p>"You think you can persuade Régine, M. Moncrif?"</p>

<p>"I am sure," he asserted firmly. "And you, milady! Régine thinks
the whole world of you!"</p>

<p>"But there is the boy&mdash;Jacques!"</p>

<p>"He is just a child&mdash;he acted on impulse&mdash;and I always
had great authority over him. And you, milady! The whole family
worship you!...they know what they owe you. Jacques has not thought
of his mother; but if he did&mdash;"</p>

<p>Marguerite rose without another word.</p>

<p>"Very well," she said simply. "We go together and see what we
can do with those two obstinate young folk."</p>

<p>Bertrand gave a gasp of surprise and of hope. His whole face
lighted up and he gazed upon the beautiful woman before him as a
worshipper would on his divinity.</p>

<p>"You, milady?" he murmured. "You would...really...help me...like
that?"</p>

<p>Marguerite smiled.</p>

<p>"I really would help you like that," she said. "My coach is
ordered; we can start at once. We'll get relays at Maidstone and at
Ashford, and easily reach Dover to-night, before the arrival of the
public coach. In any case, I know every one of any importance in
Dover. We could not fail to find the runaways."</p>

<p>"But you are an angel, milady!" Bertrand contrived to stammer,
although obviously he was overwhelmed with gratitude.</p>

<p>"You are ready to start?" Marguerite retorted, gently checking
any further display of emotion.</p>

<p>He certainly was hatless, and his clothes were in an untidy
condition; but such trifles mattered nothing at a moment like this.
Marguerite's household, on the other hand, were accustomed to these
sudden vagaries and departures of their mistress, either for Dover,
Bath, or any known and unknown destination, often at a few minutes'
notice.</p>

<p>In this case the coach was actually at the gates. The maids
packed the necessary valise; her ladyship changed her smart gown
for a dark travelling one, and less than half an hour after
Bertrand Moncrif's first arrival at the Manor, he was seated
beside Lady Blakeney in her coach. The coachman cracked his whip,
the postilion swung himself into the saddle, and the servants stood
at attention as the vehicle slowly swung out of the gates; and
presently, the horses putting on the pace, disappeared along the
road, followed by a cloud of dust.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>Bertrand Moncrif, brooding, absorbed in thoughts, said little or
nothing while the coach swung along at a very brisk pace.
Marguerite, who always had plenty to think about, did not feel in
the mood to try and make conversation. She was very sorry for the
young man, who in very truth must have suffered also from remorse.
His lack of ardour&mdash;obviously only an outward
lack&mdash;toward his fiancée and the members of her family, must
to a certain extent have helped to precipitate the present
catastrophe. Coolness and moroseness on his part gave rise to want
of confidence on the other. Régine, heart-sick at her lover's
seeming indifference, was no doubt all the more ready to lavish
love and self-sacrifice upon the young brother. Marguerite was
sorry enough for the latter&mdash;a young fool, with the exalté
Latin temperament, brimming over with desires for self-immolation
as futile as they were senseless&mdash;but her generous heart went
out to Régine de Serval, a girl who appeared redestined to sorrow
and disappointments, endowed with an exceptionally warm nature and
cursed with the inability to draw whole-hearted affection to
herself. She worshipped Bertrand Moncrif; she idolized her mother,
her brother, her sister. But though they, one and all, relied on
her, brought her the confidences of their troubles and their
difficulties, it never occurred to any one of them to give up
something&mdash;a distraction, a fancy, an ideal&mdash;for the sake
of silent, thoughtful Régine.</p>

<p>Marguerite allowed her thoughts thus to dwell on these people,
whom her husband's splendid sacrifice on their behalf had rendered
dear. Indeed, she loved them like she loved so many others, because
of the dangers which he had braved for their sakes. Their lives had
become valuable because of his precious one, daily risked because
of them. And at the back of her mind there was also the certainty
that if these two young fools did put their mad project in
execution and endeavoured to return to Paris, it would again be the
gallant Scarlet Pimpernel who would jeopardize his life to save
them from the consequences of their own folly.</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>Luncheon and a brief halt was taken at Farningham and Maidstone
reached by three o'clock in the afternoon. Here Lady Blakeney's own
servants took leave of her, and post-horses were engaged to take
her ladyship on to Ashford. Two hours later, at Ashford, fresh
relays were obtained. The public coach at this hour was only some
nine or ten miles ahead, it seems, and there was now every chance
that Dover would be reached by nightfall and the young runaways met
by their pursuers on arrival.</p>

<p>All was then for the best. Bertrand, after the coach had rattled
out of Ashford, appeared to find comfort and courage. He began to
talk, long and earnestly&mdash;of himself, his plans and projects,
his love for Régine, to which he always found it so difficult to
give expression; of Régine herself and the de Servals, mother, son
and daughters. His voice was toneless and very even. The monotony
of his diction acted after awhile as a soporific on Marguerite's
nerves. The rumble of the coach, the closeness of this long
afternoon in July, the rocking of the springs, made her feel
drowsy. After a while, a curious scent pervaded the interior
of the coach&mdash;a sweet, heady scent that appeared to weigh her
eyelids down and gave her a feeling of delicious and lazy
beatitude. Bertrand Moncrif droned on, and his voice came to her
fast-fading senses as through a thick pulpy veil. She closed her
eyes. That sweet, intoxicating scent came, more marked, more
insistent, to her nostrils. She laid her head against the cushions,
and still she heard the dreary monotone of Bertrand's voice, quite
inarticulate now, like the hum of a swarm of bees...</p>

<p>Then, all of a sudden she was fully conscious; only just in time
to feel the weight of an iron hand against her mouth and to see
Bertrand's face, ghastly of hue, eyes distorted more with fear than
rage, quite close to her own. She had not the time to scream, and
her limbs felt as heavy as lead, so that she could not struggle.
The next moment a thick woollen scarf was wound quickly and tightly
round her head, covering her mouth and eyes, only barely giving her
room to breathe, and her hands and arms were tied together with
cords.</p>

<p>This brutal assault had been so quick and so sudden that at
first it seemed to Marguerite like part of a hideous dream. She was
not fully conscious, and was half suffocated by the thick folds of
the scarf and that persistent odour, which by its sickened
sweetness caused her wellnigh to swoon.</p>

<p>Through this semi-consciousness, however, she was constantly
aware of her enemy, Bertrand Moncrif&mdash;the black-hearted
traitor who had carried out this execrable outrage: why and for
what purpose, Marguerite was too dazed to attempt to guess. He was
there, that she knew. She was conscious of his hands making sure of
the cords round her wrists, tightening the scarf around her mouth;
then presently she felt him leaning across her body and throwing
down the window, and she heard him shouting to the driver:</p>

<p>"Her ladyship has fainted. Drive as fast as you can till you
come to that white house yonder on the right, the one with the
green shutters and the tall yew at the gate!"</p>

<p>The driver's reply she could not hear, nor the crack of his
whip. Certain it is that, though the coach had rattled on at a
great pace before, the horses, as if in response to Bertrand's
commands, now burned the ground under their hoofs. A few minutes
went by&mdash;an eternity. Then that terrible cloying perfume was
again held close to her nostrils; an awful dizziness and nausea
seized her; after which she remembered nothing more.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>Chapter XXI&mdash;Memories</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>When Marguerite Blakeney finally recovered consciousness, the
sun was low down in the west. She was in a coach&mdash;not her
own&mdash;which was being whisked along the road at terrific speed.
She was alone, her mouth gagged, her wrists and her ankles tied
with cords, so that she could neither speak nor move&mdash;a
helpless log, being taken...whither?...and by whom?</p>

<p>Bertrand was not here. Through the front window of the coach she
could perceive the vague outline of two men sitting on the driver's
seat, whilst another was riding the off-leader. Four horses were
harnessed to the light coach. It flew along in a south-easterly
direction, the while the shades of evening were fast drawing
in.</p>

<p>Marguerite had seen too much of the cruelties and barbarities of
this world, too much of the hatred that existed between enemy
countries, and too much of the bitter rancour felt by certain men
against her husband and indirectly against herself, not to realize
at once whence the blow had come that had struck her. Something too
in the shape of that back which she perceived through the window in
front of her, something in the cut of the threadbare coat, the set
of the black bow at the nape of the neck, was too familiar to leave
her even for a moment in doubt. Here was no ordinary foot-pad, no
daring abduction with a view to reward or ransom. This was the work
of her husband's enemies, who, through her, were once more striving
to get at him.</p>

<p>Bertrand Moncrif had been the decoy. Whence had come the hatred
which prompted him to raise his hand against the very man to whom
he owed his life, Marguerite was still too dazed to conjecture. He
had gone, and taken his secret of rancour with him, mayhap for
ever. Lying pinioned and helpless as she was, Marguerite had but
the one thought: in what way would those fiends who had her a
prisoner use her as a leverage against the life and honour of the
Scarlet Pimpernel? They had held her once before&mdash;not so very
long ago&mdash;in Boulogne, and he had emerged unscathed,
victorious over them all.</p>

<p>Marguerite, helpless and pinioned, forced her thoughts to dwell
on that time, when his enemies had filled to the brim the cup of
humiliation and of dread which was destined for him through
her hands, and his ingenuity and his daring dashed the cup to the
ground ere it reached her lips. In truth, her plight then, at
Boulogne, was in no way less terrible, less seemingly hopeless than
now. She was a prisoner then, just as she was now; in the power of
men whose whole life and entire range of thought had for the past
two years been devoted to the undoing and annihilation of the
Scarlet Pimpernel. And there was a certain grim satisfaction for
the pinioned, helpless woman in recalling the many instances where
the daring adventurer had so completely outwitted his enemies, as
well as in the memory of those days at Boulogne when the life of
countless innocents was to be the price of her own.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>The embarkation took place somewhere on the coast around
Brichington. When, at dead of night, the coach came to a halt, and
the tang of sea air and salt spray reached Marguerite's burning
cheeks and parched lips, she tried with all her might to guess at
her exact position. But that was impossible.</p>

<p>She was lifted out of the coach, and at once a shawl was thrown
over her face, so that she could not see. It was more instinct than
anything else that guided her perceptions. Even in the coach she
had been vaguely conscious of the direction in which she had been
travelling. All that part of the country was entirely familiar to
her. So often she had driven down with Sir Percy, either to Dover
or more often to some lonely part of the coast, where he took ship
for unknown destinations, that in her mind she could, even blinded
with tears and half-conscious as she was, trace in her mind the
various turnings and side-roads along which she was being borne at
unabating speed.</p>

<p>Birchington&mdash;one of the favourite haunts of the smuggling
fraternity, with its numberless caves and retreats dug by the sea
in the chalk cliffs, as if for the express benefit of
ne'er-do-wells&mdash;seemed the natural objective of the miscreants
who had her in their power. In fact, at one moment she was quite
sure that the square tower of old Minister church flitted past her
vision through the window of the coach, and that the horses
immediately after that sprinted the hill between Minster and
Acoll.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, there was no doubt that the coach came to a
halt at a desolate spot. The day which had begun in radiance and
sunshine, had turned to an evening of squall and drizzle. A thin
rain soon wetted Marguerite's clothes and the shawl on her head
through and through, greatly adding to her misery and discomfort.
Though she saw nothing, she could trace every landmark of the
calvary to the summit of which she was being borne like an
insentient log.</p>

<p>For a while she lay at the bottom of a small boat, aching in
body as well as in mind, her eyes closed, her limbs cramped by the
cords which owing to the damp were cutting into her flesh, faint
with cold and want of food, wet to the skin yet with eyes and head
and hands burning hot, and her ears filled with the dreary,
monotonous sound of the oars creaking in the rowlocks and the boom
of the water against the sides of the boat.</p>

<p>She was lifted out of the boat and carried, as she judged, by
two men up a companion ladder, then down some steps and finally
deposited on some hard boards; after which the wet shawl was
removed from her face. She was in the dark. Only a tiny streak of
light found its way through a chink somewhere close to the floor. A
smell of tar and of stale food gave her a wretched sense of nausea.
But she had by now reached a stage of physical and mental
prostration wherein even acute bodily suffering counts as nothing,
and is endurable because it is no longer felt.</p>

<p>After a while the familiar motion, the well-known sound of a
ship weighing anchor, gave another blow to her few lingering hopes.
Every movement of the ship now bore her farther and farther from
England and home, and rendered her position more utterly miserable
and hopeless.</p>

<p>Far be it from me to suggest even for a moment that Marguerite
Blakeney lost either spirit or courage during this terrible ordeal.
But she was so completely helpless that instinct forced her to
remain motionless and quiescent, and not to engage in a fight
against overwhelming odds. In mid-Channel, surrounded by miscreants
who had her in their power, she could obviously do nothing except
safeguard what dignity she could by silence and seeming
acquiescence.</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>She was taken ashore in the early dawn, at a spot not very far
from Boulogne. Precautions were no longer taken against her
possible calls for help; even the cords had been removed from her
wrists and ankles as soon as she was lowered into the boat that
brought her to shore. Cramped and stiff though she was, she
disdained the help of an arm which was held out to her to enable
her to step out of the boat.</p>

<p>All the faces around her were unfamiliar. There were four or
five men, surly and silent, who piloted her over the rocks and
cliffs and then along the sands, to the little hamlet of Wimereux,
which she knew well. The coast at this hour was still deserted;
only at one time did the little party meet with a group of buxom
young women, trudging along barefooted with their shrimping nets
over their shoulders. They stared wide-eyed but otherwise
indifferent, at the unfortunate woman in torn, damp clothes, and
with golden hair all dishevelled, who was bravely striving not to
fall whilst urged on by five rough fellows in ragged jerseys,
tattered breeches, and bare-kneed.</p>

<p>Just for one moment&mdash;a mere flash&mdash;Marguerite at sight
of these girls had the wild notion to run to them, implore their
assistance in the name of their sweethearts, their husbands, their
songs; to throw herself at their feet and beg them to help her,
seeing that they were women and could not be without heart or pity.
But it was a mere flash, the wild vagary of an over-excited brain,
the drifting straw that mocks the drowning man. The next moment the
girls had gone by, laughing and chattering. One of them intoned the
"Ca ira!" and Marguerite, fortunately for her own dignity, was not
seriously tempted to essay so futile, so senseless an appeal.</p>

<p>Later on, in a squalid little hovel on the outskirts of
Wimereux, she was at last given some food which, though of the
poorest and roughest description, was nevertheless welcome, for it
revived her spirit and strengthened her courage, of which she had
sore need.</p>

<p>The rest of the journey was uneventful. Within the first hour of
making a fresh start, she had realized that she was being taken to
Paris. A few words dropped casually by the men who had charge of
her apprised her of the fact. Otherwise they were very
reticent&mdash;not altogether rough or unkind.</p>

<p>The coach in which she travelled during this stage of the
journey was roomy and not uncomfortable, although the cushions were
ragged and the leatherwork mildewed. Above all, she had the supreme
comfort of privacy. She was alone in the coach, alone during the
halts at way-side hostelries when she was allowed food and rest,
alone throughout those two interminable nights when, with brief
intervals whilst relays of horses were put into the shafts or the
men took it in turns to get food or drunk in some house unseen in
the darkness, she vainly tried to get a snatch or two of sleep and
a few moments of forgetfulness; alone throughout that next long
day, whilst frequent summer showers sent heavy raindrops beating
against the window-panes of the coach, and familiar landmarks on
the way to Paris flitted like threatening ghouls past her aching
eyes.</p>

<p>Paris was reached at dawn of the third day. Seventy-two hours
had crept along leaden-footed, since the moment when she had
stepped into her own coach outside her beautiful home in Richmond,
surrounded by her own servants, and with that traitor Moncrif by
her side. Since then, what a load of sorrow, of anxiety, seemed as
nothing beside the heartrending thoughts of her beloved, as yet
ignorant of her terrible fate and of the schemes which those fiends
who had so shamefully trapped her were even now concocting for the
realization of their vengeance against him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>Chapter XXII&mdash;Waiting</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>The house to which Marguerite was ultimately driven, and where
she presently found herself ushered up the stairs into a small,
well-furnished apartment, appeared to be situated somewhere in an
outlying quarter of Paris.</p>

<p>The apartment consisted of three rooms&mdash;a bedroom, a
sitting-room, and small cabinet de toilette&mdash;all plainly but
nicely furnished. The bed looked clean and comfortable, there was a
carpet on the floor, one or two pictures on the wall, an arm-chair
or two, even a few books in an armoire. An old woman, dour of mien
but otherwise willing and attentive, did all she could to minister
to the poor wearied woman's wants. She brought up some warm milk
and home-baked bread. Butter, she explained, was not obtainable
these day, and the household had not seen sugar for weeks.</p>

<p>Marguerite, tired out and hungry, readily ate some breakfast;
but what she longed for most and needed most was rest. So
presently, at the gruff invitation of the old woman, she undressed
and stretched her weary limbs between the sheets, with a sigh of
content. Anxiety, for the moment, had to yield to the sense of
well-being, and with the name of her beloved on her lips Marguerite
went to sleep like a child.</p>

<p>When she woke, it was late afternoon. On a chair close by her
bedside was some clean linen laid out, a change of stockings, clean
shoes, and a gown&mdash;a perfect luxury, which made this silent
and lonely house appear more like the enchanted abode of ogres or
fairies than before. Marguerite rose and dressed. The linen was
fine, obviously the property of a woman of refinement, whilst
everything in the tiny dressing-room&mdash;a comb, hand-mirror,
soap, and scented water&mdash;suggested that the delicate hand of a
cultured woman had seen to their disposal. A while later, the dour
attendant brought her some soup and a dish of cooked
vegetables.</p>

<p>Every phase of the situation became more and more puzzling as
time went one. Marguerite, with the sense of well-being further
accentuated by the feel of warm, dry clothes and of wholesome food,
had her mind free enough to think and to ponder. She had thrown
open the window, and peeping out, noted that it obviously gave on
the back of the house and that the view consisted of rough,
uncultivated land, broken up here and there by workshops,
warehouses, and timber-yards. Marguerite also noted that she was
gazing out in the direction of the north-west, that the apartment
wherein she found herself was on the top floor of a detached house
which, judging by certain landmarks vaguely familiar, was situated
somewhere outside the barrier of St. Antoine, and not very far from
the Bastille and from the Arsenal.</p>

<p>Again she pondered. Where was she? Why was she being treated
with a kindness and consideration altogether at variance with the
tactics usually adopted by the enemies of the Scarlet Pimpernel?
She was not in prison. She was not being starved, or threatened, or
humiliated. The day wore on, and she was not confronted with one or
other of those fiends who were so obviously using her as a decoy
for her husband.</p>

<p>But though Marguerite Blakeney was not in prison, she was a
prisoner. This she had ascertained five minutes after she was alone
in the apartment. She could wander at will from room to room; but
only in them, not out of them. The door of communication between
the rooms was wide open; those that obviously gave on a landing
outside were securely locked; and when a while ago the old woman
had entered with the tray of food, Marguerite had caught sight of a
group of men in the well-known tattered uniform of the National
Guard, standing at attention in a wide, long antechamber.</p>

<p>Yes; she was a prisoner! She could open the windows of her
apartment and inhale the soft moist air which came across the wide
tract of a barren land; but these windows were thirty feet above
the ground, and there was no projection in the outside wall of the
house anywhere near that would afford a foothold to anything
human.</p>

<p>Thus for twenty-four hours she was left to meditate, thrown upon
her own resources, with no other company save that of her own
thoughts, and they were anything but cheerful. The uncertainty of
the situation soon began to prey upon her nerves. She had been calm
in the morning; but as the day wore on the loneliness, the mystery,
the silence, began to tell upon her courage. Soon she got to look
upon the woman who waited upon her as upon her jailer, and when she
was alone she was for ever straining her ears to hear what the men
who were guarding her door might be saying among themselves.</p>

<p>The next night she hardly slept.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours later she had a visit from citizen
Chauvelin.</p>

<p>She had been expecting that visit all along, or else a message
from him. When he came she had need of all her pluck and all her
determination, not to let him see the emotion which his presence
caused her. Dread! Loathing! These were her predominant sensations.
But dread above all; because he was dressed with scrupulous care
and affected the manners and graces of a society which had long
since cast him out. It was not the rough, out-at-elbows Terrorist
who stood before her, the revolutionary demagogue who hits out
right and left against a caste that has always spurned him and held
itself aloof; it was the broken-down gentleman at war with fortune,
who strives by his wits to be revenged against the buffetings of
Fate and the arrogance which ostracized him as soon as he was
down.</p>

<p>He began by asking solicitously after her well-being; hoped the
journey had not over-fatigued her; humbly begged her pardon for the
discomfort which a higher power compelled him to put upon her. He
talked platitudes in an even, unctuous voice until Marguerite,
exasperated, and her nerves on edge, curtly bade him to come to the
point.</p>

<p>"I have come to the point, dear lady," he retorted suavely. "The
point is that you should be comfortable and have no cause to
complain whilst you are under this roof."</p>

<p>"And how long am I to remain a prisoner under it?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Until Sir Percy has in his turn honoured this house with his
presence," he replied.</p>

<p>To this she made no answer for a time, but sat quite still
looking at him, as if detached and indifferent. He waited for her
to speak, his pale eyes, slightly mocking, fixed upon her. Then she
said simply:</p>

<p>"I understand."</p>

<p>"I was quite sure you would, dear lady," he rejoined blandly.
"You see, the phase of heroics is past. I will confess to you that
it proved of no avail when measured against the lofty coolness of
that peerless exquisite. So we over here have shed our ardour like
a mantle. We, too, now are quite calm, quite unperturbed, quite
content to wait. The beautiful Lady Blakeney is a guest under this
roof. Well, sooner or later that most gallant of husbands will
desire to approach his lady. Sooner or later he will learn that she
is no longer in England. Then he will set his incomparable wits to
work to find out where she is. Again, I may say that sooner or
later, perhaps, even aided by us, he will know that she is here.
Then he will come. Am I not right?"</p>

<p>Of course he was right. Sooner or later Percy would learn where
she was; and then he would come. He would come to her, despite
every trap set for his undoing, despite every net laid to catch
him, despite danger of death that waited for him if he came.</p>

<p>Chauvelin said little more. In truth, the era of heroics was at
an end. At an end those ominous "either&mdash;ors" that he was wont
to mete out with a voice quavering with rage and lust of revenge.
Now there was no alternative, no deep-laid plot save one: to wait
for the Scarlet Pimpernel until he came.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile she, Marguerite, must remain helpless and a
prisoner; she must eat and drink and sleep. She, the
decoy!&mdash;who would never know when the crushing blow would fall
that would mean a hundred deaths to her if it involved that of the
husband whom she worshipped.</p>

<p>After a while, Chauvelin went away. In fact, she never knew
actually when he did go. A while ago he had sat there on that
upright chair, quiet, well groomed, suave of speech and bland of
manner.</p>

<p>"Then he will come," he had said quite urbanely. "Am I not
right?"</p>

<p>When Marguerite closed her eyes she could still see him, his
mocking gaze fixed upon her, his thin, white hands folded
complacently before him. And presently, as the day wore on and the
shades of evening blurred one object in the room after another, the
straight-backed chair, still left in its place, assumed a fantastic
human shape&mdash;the shape of a meagre figure with narrow
shoulders and thin, carefully be-stockinged legs. And all the faint
noises around her&mdash;the occasional creaking of the furniture,
the movements of the men outside her door, the soughing of the
evening breeze in the foliage of the elm trees&mdash;all were
merged into a thin, bland human voice, that went on repeating in a
kind of thin, dreary monotone:</p>

<p>"Then he will come. Am I not right?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>Chapter XXIII&mdash;Mice and
Men</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>It was on her return from England that Theresia Cabarrus took to
consulting the old witch in the Rue de la Planchette, driven
thereto by ambition, and also no doubt by remorse. There was
nothing of the hardened criminal about the fair Spaniard; she was
just a spoilt woman who had been mocked and thwarted, and desired
to be revenged. The Scarlet Pimpernel had appeared before her as
one utterly impervious to her charms, and, egged on by Chauvelin,
who used her for his own ends, she entered into a callous
conspiracy, the aim of which was the destruction of that gang of
English spies who were the enemies of France, and the first stage
of which was the heartless abduction of Lady Blakeney and her
incarceration as a decoy for the ultimate capture of her own
husband.</p>

<p>A cruel, abominable act! Theresia, who had plunged headlong into
this shameful crime, would a few days later have given much to undo
the harm she had wrought. But she had yet to learn that, once used
as a tool by the Committee of Public Safety and by Chauvelin, its
most unscrupulous agent, no man or woman could hope to become free
again until the work demanded had been accomplished to the end.
There was no freedom from that taskmaster save in death; and
Theresia's fit of compunction did not carry her to the lengths of
self-sacrifice. Marguerite Blakeney was her prisoner, the decoy
which would bring the English milor inevitably to the spot where
his wife was incarcerated; and Theresia, who had helped to bring
this state of things about, did her best to smother remorse, and
having done Chauvelin's dirty work for him she set to to see what
personal advantage she could derive from it.</p>

<p>Firstly, the satisfaction of her petty revenge: the Scarlet
Pimpernel caught in a trap, would surely regret his interference in
Theresia's love affairs. Theresia cared less than nothing about
Bertrand Moncrif, and would have been quite grateful to the English
milor for having spirited that embarrassing lover of hers away but
for that letter which had wounded the beautiful Spaniard's vanity
to the quick, and still rankled sufficiently to ease her conscience
on the score of her subsequent actions. That the letter was a bogus
one, concocted and written by Chauvelin himself in order to spur
her on to a mean revenge, Theresia did not know.</p>

<p>But far stronger than thoughts of revenge where Theresia's
schemes for her own future. She had begun to dream of Robespierre's
gratitude, of her triumph over all those who had striven for over
two years to bring that gang of English spies to book. She saw her
name writ largely on the roll of fame; she even saw in her mind,
the tyrant himself as her willing slave...and something more than
that.</p>

<p>For her tool Bertrand she had no further use. By way of a reward
for the abominable abduction of Lady Blakeney, he had been allowed
to follow the woman he worshipped like a lackey attached to her
train. Dejected, already spurned, he returned to Paris with her,
here to resume the life of humiliation and of despised ardour which
had broken his spirit and warped his nature, before his gallant
rescuer had snatched him out of the toils of the beautiful
Spaniard.</p>

<p>Within an hour of setting his foot on French soil, Bertrand had
realized that he had been nothing in Theresia's sight but a lump of
malleable wax, which she had moulded to her own design and now
threw aside as cumbersome and useless. He had realized that her
ambition soared far above linking her fate to an obscure and
penniless lover, when the coming man of the hour&mdash;citizen
Tallien&mdash;was already at her feet.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>Thus Theresia had attained one of her great desires: the Scarlet
Pimpernel was as good as captured, and when he finally succumbed he
could not fail to know whence came the blow that struck him.</p>

<p>With regard to her future, matters were more doubtful. She had
not yet subjugated Robespierre sufficiently to cause him to give up
his more humble love and to lay down his power and popularity at
her feet; whilst the man who had offered her his hand and
name&mdash;citizen Tallien&mdash;was for ever putting a check upon
her ambition and his own advancement by his pusillanimity and lack
of enterprise.</p>

<p>Whilst she was aching to push him into decisive action, into
seizing the supreme power before Robespierre and his friends had
irrevocably established theirs, Tallien was for temporizing, fear
that in trying to snatch a dictatorship he and his beloved with him
would lose their heads.</p>

<p>"While Robespierre lives," Theresia would argue passionately,
"no man's head is safe. Every rival, sooner or later, becomes a
victim. St. Just and Couthon aim at a dictatorship for him. Sooner
or later they will succeed; then death to every man who has ever
dared oppose them."</p>

<p>"Therefore 'tis wiser not to oppose," the prudent Tallien would
retort. "The time will come&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never!" she riposted hotly. "While you plot, and argue and
ponder, Robespierre acts or signs your death-warrant."</p>

<p>"Robespierre is the idol of the people; he sways the Convention
with a word. His eloquence would drag an army of enemies to the
guillotine!"</p>

<p>"Robespierre!" Theresia retorted with sublime contempt. "Ah,
when you have said that, you think you have said everything!
France, humanity, the people, sovereign power!&mdash;all that, you
assert, is embodied in that one man. But, my friend, listen to me!"
she went on earnestly. "Listen, when I assert that Robespierre is
only a name, a fetish, a manikin set up on a pedestal! By whom? By
you, and the Convention; by the Clubs and the Committees. And the
pedestal is composed of that elusive entity which you call the
people and which will disintegrate from beneath his feet as soon as
the people have realized that those feet are less than clay. One
touch of a firm finger against that manikin, I tell you, and he
will fall as dust before you; and you can rise upon that same
elusive pedestal&mdash;popularity, to the heights which he hath so
easily attained."</p>

<p>But, though Tallien was at times carried away by her vehemence,
he would always shake his head and counsel prudence, and assure her
that the time was not yet. Theresia, impatient and dictatorial, had
more than once hinted at rupture.</p>

<p>"I could not love a weakling," she would aver; and at the back
of her mind there would rise schemes, which aimed at transferring
her favours to the other man, who she felt would be more worthy of
her.</p>

<p>"Robespierre would not fail me, as this coward does!" she mused,
even while Tallien, blind and obedient, was bidding her farewell at
the very door of the charlatan to whom Theresia had turned in her
ambition and her difficulties.</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>Something of the glamour which had originally surrounded Mother
Théot's incantations had vanished since sixty-two of her devotees
had been sent to the guillotine on charge of conspiring for the
overthrow of the Republic. Robespierre's enemies, too cowardly to
attack him in the Convention or in the Clubs, had seized upon the
mystery which hung over the séances in the Rue de la Planchette in
order to undermine his popularity in the one and his power in the
other.</p>

<p>Spies were introduced into the witch's lair. The names of its
chief frequenters became known, and soon wholesale arrests were
made, which were followed by the inevitable condemnations.
Robespierre had not actually been named; but the identity of the
sycophants who had proclaimed him the Messenger of the Most High,
the Morning Star, or the Regenerator of Mankind, were hurled across
from the tribune of the Convention, like poisoned arrows aimed at
the tyrant himself.</p>

<p>But Robespierre had been too wary to allow himself to be dragged
into the affair. His enemies tried to goad him into defending his
worshippers, thus admitting his association with the gang; but he
remained prudently silent, and with callous ruthlessness he
sacrificed them to his own safety. He never raised his voice nor
yet one finger to save them from death, and whilst
he&mdash;bloodthirsty autocrat&mdash;remained firmly installed upon
his self-constituted throne, those who had acclaimed him as second
only to God, perished upon the scaffold.</p>

<p>Mother Théot, for some inexplicable reason, escaped this
wholesale slaughter; but her séances were henceforth shorn of their
splendour. Robespierre no longer dared frequent them even in
disguise. The house in the Rue de la Planchette became a marked one
to the agents of the Committee of Public Safety, and the witch
herself was reduced to innumerable shifts to eke out a precarious
livelihood and to keep herself in the good graces of those agents,
by rendering them various unavowable services.</p>

<p>To those, however, who chose to defy public opinion and to
disregard the dangers which attended the frequentation of Mother
Théot's sorceries, these latter had lost little or nothing of their
pristine solemnity. There was the closely curtained room; the
scented, heavy atmosphere; the chants, the coloured flames, the
ghost-like neophytes. Draped in her grey veils, the old witch still
wove her spells and called on the powers of light and of darkness
to aid her in fortelling the future. The neophytes chanted and
twisted their bodies in quaint contortions; alone, the small
blackamoor grinned at what experience had taught him was nothing by
quackery and charlatanism.</p>

<p>Theresia, sitting on the dias, with the heady fumes of Oriental
scents blurring her sight and the clearness of her intellect, was
drinking in the honeyed words and flattering prophecies of the old
witch.</p>

<p>"Thy name will be the greatest in the land! Before thee will bow
the mightiest thrones! At thy word heads will fall and diedems will
totter!" Mother Théot announced in sepulchral tones, whilst gazing
into the crystal before her.</p>

<p>"As the wife of citizen Tallien?" Theresia queried in an awed
whisper.</p>

<p>"That the spirits do not say," the old witch replied. "What is a
name to them? I see a crown of glory, and thy head surrounded by a
golden light; and at thy feet lies something which once was
scarlet, and now is crimson and crushed."</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" Theresia murmured.</p>

<p>"That is for thee to know," the sybil replied sternly. "Commune
with the spirits; lose thyself in their embrace; learn from them
the great truths, and the future will be made clear to thee."</p>

<p>With which cryptic utterance she gathered her veils around her,
and with weird murmurs of, "Evohe! Evohe! Sammael! Zamiel! Evohe!"
glided out of the room, mysterious and inscrutable, presumably in
order to allow her bewildered client to meditate on the enigmatical
prophecy in solitude.</p>

<p>But directly she had closed the door behind her, Mother Théot's
manner underwent a change. Here the broad light of day appeared to
diverst her of all her sybilline attributes. She became just an
ugly old woman, wrinkled and hook-nosed, dressed in shabby
draperies that were grey with age and dirt, and with claw-like
hands that looked like the talons of a bird of prey.</p>

<p>As she entered the room, a man who had been standing at the
window opposite, staring out into the dismal street below, turned
quickly to her.</p>

<p>"Art satisfied?" she asked at once.</p>

<p>"From what I could hear, yes!" he replied, "though I could have
wished thy pronouncements had been more clear."</p>

<p>The hag shrugged her lean shoulders and nodded in the direction
of her lair.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she said. "The Spaniard understands well enough. She never
consults me or invokes the spirits but they speak to her of that
which is scarlet. She knows what it means. You need not fear,
citizen Chauvelin, that in the pursuit of her vaulting ambition,
she will forget that her primary duty is to you!"</p>

<p>"No," Chauvelin asserted calmly, "she'll not forget that. The
Cabarrus is no fool. She knows well enough that when citizens of
the State have been employed to work on its behalf, they are no
longer free agents afterwards. The work must be carried through to
the end."</p>

<p>"You need not fear the Cabarrus, citizen," the sybil rejoined
dryly. "She'll not fail you. Her vanity is immense. She believes
that the Englishman insulted her by writing that flippant letter,
and she'll not leave him alone till she has had her revenge."</p>

<p>"No!" Chauvelin assented. "She'll not fail me. Nor thou either,
citoyenne."</p>

<p>The old hag shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"I?" she exclaimed, with a quiet laugh. "Is that likely? You
promised me ten thousand livres the day the Scarlet Pimpernel is
captured!"</p>

<p>"And the guillotine," Chauvelin broke in grimly, "if thou
shouldst allow the woman upstairs to escape."</p>

<p>"I know that," the old woman rejoined dryly. "If she escapes
'twill not be through my connivance."</p>

<p>"In the service of the State," Chauvelin riposted, "even
carelessness becomes a crime."</p>

<p>Catherine Théot was silent for a moment or two, pressed her thin
lips together; then rejoined quite quietly:</p>

<p>"She'll not escape. Have no fear, citizen Chauvelin."</p>

<p>"That's brave! And now, tell me what has become of the
coal-heaver Rateau?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he comes and goes. You told me to encourage him."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"So I give him potions for his cough. He has one foot in the
grave."</p>

<p>"Would he had both!" Chauvelin broke in savagely. "That man is a
perpetual menace to my plans. It would have been so much better if
we could have sent him last April to the guillotine."</p>

<p>"It was in your hands," Mother Théot retorted. "The Committee
reported against him. His measure was full enough. Aiding that
execrable Scarlet Pimpernel to escape...! Name of a name! it should
have been enough!"</p>

<p>"It was not proved that he did aid the English spies," Chauvelin
retorted moodily. "And Foucquier-Tinville would not arraign him. He
vowed it would anger the people&mdash;the rabble&mdash;of which
Rateau himself forms an integral part. We cannot afford to anger
the rabble these days, it seems."</p>

<p>"And so Rateau, the asthmatic coal-heaver, walked out of prison a
free man, whilst my neophytes were dragged up to the guillotine,
and I was left without means of earning an honest livelihood!"
Mother Théot concluded with a doleful sigh.</p>

<p>"Honest?" Chauvelin exclaimed, with a sarcastic chuckle. Then,
seeing that the old witch was ready to lose her temper, he quickly
added: "Tell me more about Rateau. Does he often come here?"</p>

<p>"Yes; very often. He must be in my anteroom now. He came
directly he was let out of prison, and has haunted this place ever
since. He thinks I can cure him of his asthma, and as he pays me
well&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pays you well?" Chauvelin broke in quickly. "That
starveling?"</p>

<p>"Rateau is no starveling," the old woman asserted. "Many an
English gold piece hath he given me."</p>

<p>"But not of late?"</p>

<p>"No later than yesterday."</p>

<p>Chauvelin swore viciously.</p>

<p>"Then he is still in touch with that cursed Englishman!"</p>

<p>Mother Théot shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Does one ever know which is the Englishman and which is the
asthmatic Rateau?" she queried, with a dry laugh.</p>

<p>Whereupon a strange thing happened&mdash;so strange indeed that
Chauvelin's next words turned to savage curses, and that Mother
Théot, which to the lips, her knees shaking under her, tiny beads
of perspiration rising beneath her scanty locks, had to hold on to
the table to save herself from falling.</p>

<p>"Name of a name of a dog!" Chauvelin muttered hoarsely, whilst
the old woman, shaken but that superstitious dread which she liked
to arouse in her clients, could only stare at him and mutely shake
her head.</p>

<p>And yet nothing very alarming had occurred. Only a man had
laughed, light-heartedly and long; and the sound of that laughter
had come from somewhere near&mdash;the next room probably, or the
landing beyond Mother Théot's anteroom. It had come low and
distinct, slightly muffled by the intervening wall. Nothing in
truth to frighten the most nervous child!</p>

<p>A man had laughed. One of Mother Théot's clients probably, who
in the company of a friend chose to wile away the weary hour of
waiting on the sybil by hilarious conversation. Of course, that was
it! Chauvelin, cursing himself now for his cowardice, passed a
still shaking hand across his brow, and a wry smile distorted
momentarily his thin, set lips.</p>

<p>"One of your clients is of good cheer," he said with
well-assumed indifference.</p>

<p>"There is no one in the anteroom at this hour," the old hag
murmured under her breath. "Only Rateau...and he is too scant of
breath to laugh...he..."</p>

<p>But Chauvelin no longer heard what she had to say. With an
exclamation which no one who heard it could have defined, he turned
on his heel and almost ran out of the room.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>Chapter XXIV&mdash;By Order of the
State</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>The antechamber, wide and long, ran the whole length of Mother
Théot's apartment. Her witch's lair and the room where she had just
had her interview with Chauvelin gave directly on it on the one
side, and two other living rooms on the other. At one end of the
antechamber there were two windows, usually kept closely shuttered;
and at the other was the main entrance door, which led to landing
and staircase.</p>

<p>The antechamber was empty. It appeared to mock Chauvelin's
excitement, with its grey-washed walls streaked with grime, its
worm-eaten benches and tarnished chandelier. Mother Théot, voluble
and quaking with fear, was close at his heels. Curtly he ordered
her to be gone; her mutterings irritated him, her obvious fear of
something unknown grated unpleasantly on his nerves. He cursed
himself for his cowardice, and cursed the one man who alone in this
world had the power to unnerve him.</p>

<p>"I was dreaming, of course," he muttered aloud to himself
between his teeth. "I have that arch-devil, his laugh, his voice,
his affectations, on the brain!"</p>

<p>He was on the point of going to the main door, in order to peer
out on the landing or down the stairs, when he heard his name
called immediately behind him. Theresia Cabarrus was standing under
the lintel of the door which gave on the sybil's sanctum, her
delicate hand holding back the portière.</p>

<p>"Citizen Chauvelin," she said, "I was waiting for you."</p>

<p>"And I, citoyenne," he retorted gruffly, "had in truth forgotten
you."</p>

<p>"Mother Théot left me alone for a while, to commune with the
spirits," she explained.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he riposted, slightly sarcastic. "With what result?"</p>

<p>"To help you further, citizen Chauvelin," she replied; "if you
have need of me."</p>

<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed with a savage curse. "In truth, I have need
of every willing hand that will raise itself against mine enemy. I
have need of you, citizeness; of that old witch; of Rateau, the
coal-heaver; of every patriot who will sit and watch this house, to
which we have brought the one bait that will lure the goldfish to
our net."</p>

<p>"Have I not proved my willingness, citizen?" she retorted, with
a smile. "Think you 'tis pleasant to give up my life, my salon, my
easy, contented existence, and become a mere drudge in your
service?"</p>

<p>"A drudge," he broke in with a chuckle, "who will soon be
greater than a Queen."</p>

<p>"Ah, if I thought that!..." she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I am as sure of it as that I am alive," he replied firmly. "You
will never do anything with citizen Tallien, citoyenne. He is too
mean, too cowardly. But bring the Scarlet Pimpernel to his knees at
the chariot wheel of Robespierre, and even the crown of the
Bourbons would be yours for the asking."</p>

<p>"I know that, citizen," she rejoined dryly; "else I were not
here."</p>

<p>"We hold all the winning cards," he went on eagerly. "Lady
Blakeney is in our hands. So long as we hold her, we have the
certainty that sooner or later the English spy will establish
communication with her. Catherine Théot is a good jailer, and
Captain Boyer upstairs has a number of men under his
command&mdash;veritable sleuthhounds, whose efficiency I can
guarantee and whose eagerness is stimulated by the promise of a
magnificent reward. But experience has taught me that that accursed
Scarlet Pimpernel is never so dangerous as when we think we hold
him. His extraordinary histrionic powers have been our undoing
hitherto. No man's eyes are keen enough to pierce his disguises.
That is why, citoyenne, I dragged you to England; that is why I
placed you face to face with him, and said to you, 'That is the
man.' Since then, with your help, we hold the decoy. Now you are my
coadjutor and my help. In your eyes I place my trust; in your wits,
your instinct. In whatever guise the Scarlet Pimpernel presents
himself before you&mdash;and he will present himself before you, or
he is no longer the impudent and reckless adventurer I know him to
be!&mdash;I feel that you at least will recognize him."</p>

<p>"Yes; I think I should recognize him," she mused.</p>

<p>"Think you that I do not appreciate the sacrifice you
make&mdash;the anxiety, the watchfulness to which you so nobly
subject yourself? But 'tis you above all who are the lure which
must inevitably attract the Scarlet Pimpernel into my hands."</p>

<p>"Soon, I hope," she sighed wearily.</p>

<p>"Soon," he asserted firmly. "I dare swear it! Until then,
citizeness, in the name of your own future, and in the name of
France, I adjure you to watch. Watch and listen! Oh, think of the
stakes for which we are playing, you and I! Bring the Scarlet
Pimpernel to his knees, citoyenne, and Robespierre will be as much
your slave as he is now the prey to a strange dread of that one
man. Robespierre fears the Scarlet Pimpernel. A superstitious
conviction had seized hold of him that the English spy will bring
about his downfall. We have all seen of late how aloof he holds
himself. He no longer attends the Committees. He no longer goes to
the Clubs; he shuns his friends; and his furtive glance is for ever
trying to pierce some imaginary disguise, under which he
alternately fears and hopes to discover his arch-enemy. He dreads
assassination, anonymous attacks. In every obscure member of the
Convention who walks up the steps of the tribune, he fears to find
the Scarlet Pimpernel under a new, impenetrable mask. Ah,
citoyenne! what influence you would have over him if through your
agency all those fears could be drowned in the blood of that
abominable Englishman!"</p>

<p>"Now, who would have thought that?" a mocking voice broke in
suddenly, with a quiet chuckle. "I vow, my dear M. Chambertin, you
are waxing more eloquent than ever before!"</p>

<p>Like the laughter of a while ago, the voice seemed to come from
nowhere. It was in the air, muffled by the clouds of Mother Théot's
perfumes, or by the thickness of doors and tapestries. Weird, yet
human.</p>

<p>"By Satan, this is intolerable!" Chauvelin exclaimed; and paying
no heed to Theresia's faint cry of terror, he ran to the main door.
It was on the latch. He tore it open and dashed out upon the
landing.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>From here a narrow stone staircase, dank and sombre, led
downwards as well as upwards, in a spiral. The house had only the
two stories, perched above some disused and dilapidated
storage-rooms, to which a double outside door and wicket gave
access from the street.</p>

<p>The staircase received its only light from a small window high
up in the roof, the panes of which were coated with grime, so that
the well of the stairs, especially past the first-floor landing,
was almost in complete gloom. For an instant Chauvelin hesitated.
Never a coward physically, he yet had no mind to precipitate
himself down a dark staircase when mayhap his enemy was lying in
wait for him down below.</p>

<p>Only for an instant however. The very next second had brought
forth the positive reflection: "bah! Assassination, and in the
dark, are not the Englishman's ways."</p>

<p>Scarce a few yards from where he stood, the other side of the
door, was the dry moat which ran round the Arsenal. From there, at
a call from him, a dozen men and more would surge from the
ground&mdash;sleuthhounds, as he had told Theresia a moment ago,
who were there on the watch and whom he could trust to do his work
swiftly and securely&mdash;if only he could reach the door and call
for help. Elusive as that accursed Pimpernel was, successful chase
might even now be given to him.</p>

<p>Chauvelin ran down half a dozen steps, peered down the shaft of
the staircase, and spied a tiny light, which moved swiftly to and
fro. Then presently, below the light a bit of tallow candle, then a
grimy hand holding the candle, an arm, the top of a shaggy head
crowned by a greasy red cap, a broad back under a tattered blue
jersey. He heard the thump of heavy soles upon the stone flooring
below, and a moment or two later the weird, sepulchral sound of a
churchyard cough. Then the light disappeared. For a second or two
the darkness appeared more impenetrably dense; then one or two
narrow streaks of daylight showed the position of the outside door.
Something prompted him to call:</p>

<p>"Is that you, citizen Rateau?"</p>

<p>It was foolish, of course. And the very next moment he had his
answer. A voice&mdash;the mocking voice he knew so
well&mdash;called up to him in reply:</p>

<p>"At your service, dear M. Chambertin! Can I do anything for
you?"</p>

<p>Chauvelin swore, threw all prudence to the winds, and ran down
the stairs as fast as his shaking knees would allow him. Some three
steps from the bottom he paused for the space of a second, like one
turned to stone by what he saw. Yet it was simple enough: just the
same tiny light, the grimy hand holding the tallow candle, the
shaggy head with the greasy red cap...The figure in the gloom
looked preternaturally large, and the flickering light threw
fantastic shadows on the face and neck of the colossus, distorting
the nose to a grotesque length and the chin to weird
proportions.</p>

<p>The next instant Chauvelin gave a cry like an enraged bull and
hurled his meagre person upon the giant, who, shaken at the moment
by a tearing fit of coughing, was taken unawares and fell
backwards, overborne by the impact, dropping the light as he fell
and still wheezing pitiably whilst trying to give vent to his
feelings by vigorous curses.</p>

<p>Chauvelin, vaguely surprised at his own strength or the weakness
of his opponent, pressed his knee against the latter's chest,
gripped him by the throat, smothering his curses and wheezes,
turning the funeral cough into agonized gasps.</p>

<p>"At my service, in truth, my gallant Pimpernel!" he murmured
hoarsely, feeling his small reserve of strength oozing away by the
strenuous effort. "What you can do for me? Wait here, until I have
you bound and gagged, safe against further mischief!"</p>

<p>His victim had in fact given a last convulsive gasp, lay now at
full length upon the stone floor, with arms outstretched,
motionless. Chauvelin relaxed his grip. His strength was spent, he
was bathed in sweat, his body shook from head to foot. But he was
triumphant! His mocking enemy, carried away by his own histrionics,
had overtaxed his colossal strength. The carefully simulated fit of
coughing had taken away his breath at the critical moment; the
surprise attack had done the rest; and Chauvelin&mdash;meagre,
feeble, usually the merest human insect beside the powerful
Englishman&mdash;had conquered by sheer pluck and resource.</p>

<p>There lay the Scarlet Pimpernel, who had assumed the guise of
asthmatic Rateau once too often, helpless and broken beneath the
weight of the man whom he had hoodwinked and derided. And now at
last all the intrigues, the humiliations, the schemes and the
disappointments, were at an end. He&mdash;Chauvelin&mdash;free and
honoured: Robespierre his grateful servant.</p>

<p>A wave of dizziness passed over his brain&mdash;the dizziness of
coming glory. His senses reeled. When he staggered to his feet he
could scarcely stand. The darkness was thick around him; only two
streaks of daylight at right angles to one another came through the
chinks of the outside door and vaguely illumined the interior of
the dilapidated store-room, the last step or two of the winding
stairway, the row of empty barrels on one side, the pile of rubbish
on the other, and on the stone floor the huge figure in grimy and
tattered rags, lying prone and motionless. Guided by those streaks
of light, Chauvelin lurched up to the door, fumbled for the latch
of the wicket-gate, and finding it pulled the gate open and almost
fell out into the open.</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>The Rue de la Planchette was as usual lonely and deserted. It
was a second or two before Chauvelin spied a passer-by. That minute
he spent in calling for help with all his might. The passer-by he
quickly dispatched across to the Arsenal for assistance.</p>

<p>"In the name of the Republic!" he said solemnly.</p>

<p>But already his cries had attracted the attention of the
sentries. Within two or three minutes, half a dozen men of the
National Guard were speeding down the street. Soon they had reached
the house, the door where Chauvelin, still breathless but with his
habitual official manner that brooked of no argument, gave them
hasty instructions.</p>

<p>"The man lying on the ground in there," he commanded. "Seize him
and raise him. Then one of you find some cord and bind him
securely."</p>

<p>The men flung the double doors wide open. A flood of light
illumined the store-room. There lay the huge figure on the floor,
no longer motionless, but trying to scramble to his feet, once more
torn by a fit of coughing. The men ran up to him; one of them
laughed.</p>

<p>"Why, if it isn't old Rateau!"</p>

<p>They lifted him up by his arms. He was helpless as a child, and
his face was of a dull purple colour.</p>

<p>"He will die!" another man said, with an indifferent shrug of
the shoulders.</p>

<p>But, in a way, they were sorry for him. He was one of
themselves. Nothing of the aristo about asthmatic old Rateau!</p>

<p>They had succeeded in propping him up and sitting him down upon
a barrel. His fit of coughing was subsiding. He had breath enough
now to swear. He raised his head and encountered the pale eyes of
citizen Chauvelin fixed as if sightlessly upon him.</p>

<p>"Name of a dog!" he began; but got no farther. Giddiness seized
him, for he was weak from coughing and from that strangling grip
round his throat, after he had been attacked in the darkness and
thrown violently to the ground.</p>

<p>The men around him recoiled at sight of citizen Chauvelin. His
appearance was almost death-like. His cheeks and lips were livid;
his hair dishevelled; his eyes of an unearthly paleness. One hand,
clawlike and shaking, he held out before him, as if to ward off
some horrible apparition.</p>

<p>This trance-like state made up of a ghastly fear and a sense of
the most hideous, most unearthly impotence, lasted for several
seconds. The men themselves were frightened. Unable to understand
what had happened, they thought that citizen Chauvelin, whom they
all knew by sight, had suddenly lost his reason or was possessed of
a devil. For in truth there was nothing about poor old Rateau to
frighten a child!</p>

<p>Fortunately the tension was over before real panic had seized on
any of them. The next moment Chauvelin had pulled himself together
with one of those mighty efforts of will of which strong natures
are always capable. With an impatient gesture he passed his hand
across his brow, then backwards and forwards in front of his face,
as if to chase away the demon of terror that obsessed him. He gazed
on Rateau for a moment or two, his eyes travelling over the
uncouth, semi-conscious figure of the coal-heaver with a searching,
undefinable glance. Then, as if suddenly struck with an idea, he
spoke to the man nearest him:</p>

<p>"Sergeant Chazot? Is he at the Arsenal?"</p>

<p>"Yes, citizen," the man replied.</p>

<p>"Run across quickly then," Chauvelin continued; "and bring him
hither at once."</p>

<p>The soldier obeyed, and a few more minutes&mdash;ten,
perhaps&mdash;went by in silence. Rateau, weary, cursing, not
altogether in full possession of his faculties, sat huddled up on
the barrel, his bleary eyes following every movement of citizen
Chauvelin with an anxious, furtive gaze. The latter was pacing up
and down the stone floor, like a caged, impatient animal. From time
to time he paused, either to peer out into the open in the
direction of the Arsenal, or to search the dark angles of the
store-room, kicking the piles of rubbish about with his foot.</p>

<p class="cpb">4.</p>

<p>Anon he uttered a sigh of satisfaction. The soldier had
returned, was even now in the doorway with a comrade&mdash;a short,
thick-set, powerful-looking fellow&mdash;beside him.</p>

<p>"Sergeant Chazot!" Chauvelin said abruptly.</p>

<p>"At your commands, citizen!" the sergeant replied, and at a sign
from the other followed him to the most distant corner of the
room.</p>

<p>"Bend your ear and listen," Chauvelin murmured peremptorily. "I
don't want those fools to hear." And, having assured himself that
he and Chazot could speak without being overheard, he pointed to
Rateau, then went on rapidly: "You will take this lout over to the
cavalry barracks. See the veterinary. Tell him&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused, as if unable to proceed. His lips were trembling, his
face, ashen-white, looked spectral in the gloom. Chazot, not
understanding, waited patiently.</p>

<p>"That lout," Chauvelin resumed more steadily after a while, "is
in collusion with a gang of dangerous English spies. One Englishman
especially&mdash;tall, and a master of histrionics&mdash;uses this
man as a kind of double. Perhaps you heard...?"</p>

<p>Chazot nodded.</p>

<p>"I know, citizen," he said sagely. "The Fraternal Supper in the
Rue St. Honoré. Comrades have told me that no one could tell who
was Rateau the coal-heaver and who the English milor."</p>

<p>"Exactly!" Chauvelin rejoined dryly, quite firmly now.
"Therefore, I want to make sure. The veterinary, you understand? He
brands the horses for the cavalry. I want a brand on this lout's
arm. Just a letter...a distinguishing mark..."</p>

<p>Chazot gave an involuntary gasp.</p>

<p>"But, citizen&mdash;!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Eh? What?" the other retorted sharply. "In the service of the
Republic there is no 'but,' Sergeant Chazot."</p>

<p>"I know that, citizen," Chazot, abashed, murmured humbly. "I
only meant...it seems so strange..."</p>

<p>"Stranger things than that occur every day in Paris, my friend,"
Chauvelin said dryly. "We brand horses that are the property of the
State; why not a man? Time may come," he added with a vicious
snarl, "when the Republic may demand that every local citizen
carry&mdash;indelibly branded in his flesh and by order of the
State&mdash;the sign of his own allegiance."</p>

<p>"'Tis not for me to argue, citizen," Chazot rejoined, with a
careless shrug of the shoulders. "If you tell me to take citizen
Rateau over to the veterinary at the cavalry barracks and have him
branded like cattle, why..."</p>

<p>"Not like cattle, citizen," Chauvelin broke in blandly. "You
shall commence proceedings by administering to citizen Rateau a
whole bottle of excellent eau de vie, at the Government's expense.
Then, when he is thoroughly and irretrievably drunk, the veterinary
will put the brand upon his left forearm...just one letter...Why,
the drunken reprobate will never feel it!"</p>

<p>"As you command, citizen," Chazot assented with perfect
indifference. "I am not responsible. I do as I'm told."</p>

<p>"Like the fine soldier that you are, citizen Chazot!" Chauvelin
concluded. "And I know that I can trust to your discretion."</p>

<p>"Oh, as to that&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"It would not serve you to be otherwise; that's understood. So
now, my friend, get you gone with the lout; and take these few
words of instructions with you, for the citizen veterinary."</p>

<p>He took tablet and point from his pocket and scribbled a few
words; signed it "Chauvelin" with that elegant flourish which can
be traced to this day on so many secret orders that emanated from
the Committee of Public Safety during the two years of its
existence.</p>

<p>Chazot took the written order and slipped it into his pocket.
Then he turned on his heel and briefly gave the necessary orders to
the men. Once more they hoisted the helpless giant up on his feet.
Rateau was willing enough to go. He was willing to do anything so
long as they took him away from here, away from the presence of
that small devil with the haggard face and the pale, piercing eyes.
He allowed himself to be conducted out of the building without a
murmur.</p>

<p>Chauvelin watched the little party&mdash;the six men, the
asthmatic coal-heaver and lastly the sergeant&mdash;file out of the
place, then cross the Rue de la Planchette and take the turning
opposite, the one that led through the Porte and the Rue St.
Antoine to the cavalry barracks in the Quartier Bastille. After
which, he carefully closed the double outside doors and, guided by
instinct since the place down here was in darkness once more, he
groped his way to the foot of the stairs and slowly mounted to the
floor above.</p>

<p class="cpb">5.</p>

<p>He reached the first-floor landing. The door which led into
Mother Théot's apartments was on the latch, and Chauvelin had just
stretched out his hand with a view to pushing it open, when the
door swung out on its hinges, as if moved by an invisible hand, and
a pleasant, mocking voice immediately behind him said, with grave
politeness:</p>

<p>"Allow me, my dear M. Chambertin!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>Chapter XXV&mdash;Four Days</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>What occurred during the next few seconds Chauvelin himself
would have been least able to say. Whether he stepped of his own
accord into the antechamber of Catherine Théot's apartment, or
whether an unseen hand pushed him in, he could not have told you.
Certain it is that, when he returned to the full realization of
things, he was sitting on one of the benches, his back against the
wall, whilst immediately in front of him, looking down on him
through half-closed, lazy eyes, débonnair, well groomed,
unperturbed, stood his arch-enemy, Sir Percy Blakeney.</p>

<p>The antechamber was gloomy in the extreme. Some one in the
interval had lighted the tallow candles in the centre chandelier,
and these shed a feeble, flickering light on the dank, bare walls,
the carpetless floor, the shuttered windows; whilst a thin spiral
of evil-smelling smoke wound its way to the blackened ceiling
above.</p>

<p>Of Theresia Cabarrus there was not a sign. Chauvelin looked
about him, feeling like a goaded animal shut up in a narrow space
with its tormentor. He was making desperate efforts to regain his
composure, above all he made appeal to that courage which was wont
never to desert him. In truth, Chauvelin had never been a physical
coward, nor was he afraid of death or outrage at the hands of the
man whom he had so deeply wronged, and whom he had pursued with a
veritable lust of hate. No! he did not fear death at the hands of
the Scarlet Pimpernel. What he feared was ridicule, humiliation,
those schemes&mdash;bold, adventurous, seemingly
impossible&mdash;which he knew were already seething behind the
smooth, unruffled brow of his arch-enemy, behind those lazy,
supercilious eyes, which had the power to irritate his nerves to
the verge of dementia.</p>

<p>This impudent adventurer&mdash;no better than a spy, despite his
aristocratic mien and air of lofty scorn&mdash;this meddlesome
English brigand, was the one man in the world who had, when he
measured his prowess against him, invariably brought him to
ignominy and derision, made him a laughing-stock before those whom
he had been wont to dominate; and at this moment, when once again
he was being forced to look into those strangely provoking eyes, he
appraised their glance as he would to sword of a proved adversary,
and felt as he did so just that same unaccountable dread of them
which had so often paralysed his limbs and atrophied his brain
whenever mischance flung him into the presence of his enemy.</p>

<p>He could not understand why Theresia Cabarrus had deserted him.
Even a woman, if she happened to be a friend, would by her presence
have afforded him moral support.</p>

<p>"You are looking for Mme de Fontenay, I believe, dear M.
Chambertin," Sir Percy said lightly, as if divining his thoughts.
"The ladies&mdash;ah, the ladies! They add charm, piquancy, eh? to
the driest conversations. Alas!" he went on with mock affectation,
"that Mme de Fontenay should have fled at first sound of my voice!
Now she hath sought refuge in the old witch's lair, there to
consult the spirits as to how best she can get out again, seeing
that the door is now locked...Deemed awkward, a locked door, when a
pretty woman wants to be on the other side. What think you, M.
Chambertin?"</p>

<p>"I only think, Sir Percy," Chauvelin contrived to retort,
calling all his wits and all his courage to aid him in his
humiliating position, "I only think of another pretty woman, who is
in the room just above our heads and who would also be mightily
glad to find herself the other side of a locked door."</p>

<p>"Your thoughts," Sir Percy retorted with a light laugh, "are
always so ingenuous, my dear M. Chambertin. Strangely enough, mine
just at this moment run on the possibility&mdash;not a very
unlikely one, you will admit&mdash;of shaking the breath out of
your ugly little body, as I would that of a rat."</p>

<p>"Shake, my dear Sir Percy, shake!" Chauvelin riposted with
well-simulated calm. "I grant you that I am a puny rat and you are
the most magnificent of lions; but even if I lie mangled and
breathless on this stone floor at your feet, Lady Blakeney will
still be a prisoner in our hands."</p>

<p>"And you will still be wearing the worst-cut pair of breeches it
has ever been my bad fortune to behold," Sir Percy retorted, quite
unruffled. "Lud love you, man! Have you guillotined all the good
tailors in Paris?"</p>

<p>"You choose to be flippant, Sir Percy," Chauvelin rejoined
dryly. "But, though you have chosen for the past few years to play
the rôle of a brainless nincompoop, I have cause to know that
behind your affectations there lurks an amount of sound common
sense."</p>

<p>"Lud, how you flatter me, my dear sir!" quoth Sir Percy airily.
"I vow you had not so high an opinion of me last time I had the
honour of conversing with you. It was at Nantes; do you
remember?"</p>

<p>"There, as elsewhere, you succeeded in circumventing me, Sir
Percy."</p>

<p>"No, no!" he protested. "Not in circumventing you. Only in
making you look a demmed fool!"</p>

<p>"Call it that, if you like, sir," Chauvelin admitted, with an
indifferent shrug of the shoulders. "Luck has favoured you many a
time. As I had the honour to tell you, you have had the laugh of us
in the past, and no doubt you are under the impression that you
will have it again this time."</p>

<p>"I am such a believer in impressions, my dear sir. The
impression now that I have your charming personality is indelibly
graven upon my memory."</p>

<p>"Sir Percy Blakeney counts a good memory as one of his many
accomplishments. Another is his adventurous spirit, and the
gallantry which must inevitably bring him into the net which we
have been at pains to spread for him. Lady Blakeney&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Name her not, man!" Sir Percy broke in with affect
deliberation; "or I verily believe that within sixty seconds you
would be a dead man!"</p>

<p>"I am not worthy to speak her name, <i>c'est entendu</i>,"
Chauvelin retorted with mock humility. "Nevertheless, Sir Percy, it
is around the person of that gracious lady that the Fates will spin
their web during the next few days. You may kill me. Of course, I
am at this moment entirely at your mercy. But before you embark on
such a perilous undertaking, will you allow me to place the
position a little more clearly before you?"</p>

<p>"Lud, man!" quoth Sir Percy with a quaint laugh. "That's what
I'm here for! Think you that I have sought your agreeable company
for the mere pleasure of gazing at your amiable countenance?"</p>

<p>"I only desired to explain to you, Sir Percy, the dangers to
which you expose Lady Blakeney, if you laid violent hands upon me.
'Tis you, remember, who sought this interview&mdash;not I."</p>

<p>"You are right, my dear sir, always right; and I'll not
interrupt again. I pray you to proceed."</p>

<p>"Allow me then to make my point clear. There are at this moment
a score of men of the National Guard in the room above your head.
Every one of them goes to the guillotine if they allow their
prisoner to escape; every one of them receives a reward of ten
thousand livres the day they capture the Scarlet Pimpernel. A good
spur for vigilance, what? But that is not all," Chauvelin went on
quite steadily, seeing that Sir Percy had apparently become
thoughtful and absorbed. "The men are under the command of Captain
Boyer, and he understands that every day at a certain
hour&mdash;seven in the evening, to be precise&mdash;I will be with
him and interrogate him as to the welfare of the prisoner.
If&mdash;mark me, Sir Percy!&mdash;if on any one day I do not
appear before him at that hour, his orders are to shoot the
prisoner on sight..."</p>

<p>The word was scarce out of his mouth; it broke in a hoarse
spasm. Sir Percy had him by the throat, shook him indeed as he
would a rat.</p>

<p>"You cur!" he said in an ominous whisper, his face quite close
now to that of his enemy, his jaw set, his eyes no longer
good-humoured and mildly scornful, but burning with the fire of a
mighty, unbridled wrath. "You damned&mdash;insolent&mdash;miserable
cur! As there is a Heaven above us&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then suddenly his grip relaxed, the whole face changed as if an
unseen hand has swept away the fierce lines of anger and hate. The
eyes softened beneath their heavy lids, the set lips broke into a
mocking smile. He let go his hold of the Terrorist's throat; and
the unfortunate man, panting and breathless, fell heavily against
the wall. He tried to steady himself as best he could, but his
knees were shaking, and faint and helpless, he finally collapsed
upon the nearest bench, the while Sir Percy straightened out his
tall figure, with unruffled composure rubbed his slender hands one
against the other, as if to free them from dust, and said, with
gentle, good-humoured sarcasm:</p>

<p>"Do put your cravat straight, man! You look a disgusting
object!"</p>

<p>He dragged the corner of a bench forward, sat astride upon it,
and waited with perfect sang-froid, spy-glass in hand, while
Chauvelin mechanically readjusted the set of his clothes.</p>

<p>"That's better?" he said approvingly. "Just the bow at the back
of your neck...a little more to the right...now your cuffs...Ah,
you look quite tidy again!...a perfect picture, I vow, my dear M.
Chambertin, of elegance and of a well-regulated mind!"</p>

<p>"Sir Percy&mdash;!" Chauvelin broke in with a vicious snarl.</p>

<p>"I entreat you to accept my apologies," the other rejoined with
utmost courtesy. "I was on the verge of losing my temper, which we
in England would call demmed bad form. I'll not transgress again. I
pray you, proceed with what you were saying. So
interesting&mdash;demmed interesting! You were talking about
murdering a woman in cold blood, I think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In hot blood, Sir Percy," Chauvelin rejoined more firmly.
"Blood fired by thoughts of just revenge."</p>

<p>"Pardon! My mistake! As you were saying&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Tis you who attack us. You&mdash;the meddlesome Scarlet
Pimpernel, with your accursed gang!...We defend ourselves as best
we can, using what weapons lie closest to our hand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Such as murder, outrage, abduction...and wearing breeches the
cut of which would provoke a saint to indignation."</p>

<p>"Murder, abduction, outrage, as you will, Sir Percy," Chauvelin
retorted, as cool now as his opponent. "Had you ceased to interfere
in the affairs of France when first you escaped punishment for your
machinations, you would not now be in the sorry plight in which
your own intrigues have at last landed you. Had you left us alone,
we should by now have forgotten you."</p>

<p>"Which would have been such a pity, my dear M. Chambertin,"
Blakeney rejoined gravely. "I should not like you to forget me.
Believe me, I have enjoyed life so much these past two years, I
would not give up those pleasures even for that of seeing you and
your friends have a bath or wear tidy buckles on your shoes."</p>

<p>"You will have cause to indulge in those pleasures within the
next few days, Sir Percy," Chauvelin rejoined dryly.</p>

<p>"What?" Sir Percy exclaimed. "The Committee of Public Safety
going to have a bath? Or the Revolutionary Tribunal? Which?"</p>

<p>But Chauvelin was determined not to lose his temper again.
Indeed, he abhorred this man so deeply that he felt no anger
against him, no resentment; only a cold, calculating hate.</p>

<p>"The pleasure of pitting your wits against the inevitable," he
riposted dryly.</p>

<p>"Ah?" quoth Sir Percy airily. "The inevitable has always been
such a good friend to me."</p>

<p>"Not this time, I fear, Sir Percy."</p>

<p>"Ah? You really mean this time to&mdash;?" and he made a
significant gesture across his own neck.</p>

<p>"In as few days as possible."</p>

<p>Whereupon Sir Percy rose, and said solemnly:</p>

<p>"You are right there, my friend, quite right. Delays are always
dangerous. If you mean to have my head, why&mdash;have if quickly.
As for me, delays always bore me to tears."</p>

<p>He yawned and stretched his long limbs.</p>

<p>"I am getting so deemed fatigued," he said. "Do you not think
this conversation has lasted quite long enough?"</p>

<p>"It was none of my seeking, Sir Percy."</p>

<p>"Mine, I grant you; mine, absolutely! But, hang it, man! I had
to tell you that your breeches were badly cut."</p>

<p>"And I, that we are at your service, to end the business as soon
as may be."</p>

<p>"To&mdash;?" And once more Sir Percy passed his firm hand across
his throat. Then he gave a shudder.</p>

<p>"B-r-r-r!" he exclaimed. "I had no idea you were in such a
demmed hurry."</p>

<p>"We await your pleasure, Sir Percy. Lady Blakeney must not be
kept in suspense too long. Shall we say that, in three
days...?"</p>

<p>"Make if four, my dear M. Chambertin, and I am eternally your
debtor."</p>

<p>"In four days then, Sir Percy," Chauvelin rejoined with
pronounced sarcasm. "You see how ready I am to meet you in a spirit
of conciliation! Four days, you say? Very well then; for four days
more we keep our prisoner in those rooms upstairs...After
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused, awed mayhap, in spite of himself, but the diabolical
thought which had suddenly come into his mind&mdash;a sudden
inspiration which in truth must have emanated from some unclean
spirit with which he held converse. He looked the Scarlet
Pimpernel&mdash;his enemy&mdash;squarely in the face. Conscious of
his power, he was no longer afraid. What he longed for most at this
moment was to see the least suspicion of a shadow dim the mocking
light that danced in those lazy, supercilious eyes, or the merest
tremor pass over the slender hand framed in priceless Mechlin
lace.</p>

<p>For a while complete silence reigned in the bare, dank
room&mdash;a silence broken only by the stertorous, rapid breathing
of the one man who appeared moved. That man was not Sir Percy
Blakeney. He indeed had remained quite still, spy-glass in hand,
the good-humoured smile still dancing round his lips. Somewhere in
the far distance a church clock struck the hour. Then only did
Chauvelin put his full fiendish project into words.</p>

<p>"For four days," he reiterated with slow deliberation, "we keep
our prisoner in the room upstairs...After that, Captain Boyer has
orders to shoot her."</p>

<p>Again there was silence&mdash;only for a second perhaps; whilst
down by the Stygian creek, where Time never was, the elfish ghouls
and impish demons set up a howl of delight at the hellish knavery
of man.</p>

<p>Just one second, whilst Chauvelin waited for his enemy's answer
to this monstrous pronouncement, and the very walls of the drabby
apartment appeared to listen, expectant. Overhead, could be dimly
heard the measured tramp of heavy feet upon the uncarpeted floor.
And suddenly through the bare apartment there rang the sound of a
quaint, light-hearted laugh.</p>

<p>"You really are the worst-dressed man I have ever come across,
my good M. Chambertin," Sir Percy said with rare good-humour. "You
must allow me to give you the address of a good little tailor I
came across in the Latin Quarter the other day. No decent man would
be seen walking up the guillotine in such a waistcoat as you are
wearing. And for your boots&mdash;" He yawned again. "You really
must excuse me! I came home late from the theatre last night, and
have not had my usual hours of sleep. So, by your leave&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By all means, Sir Percy!" Chauvelin replied complacently. "At
this moment you are a free man, because I happen to be alone and
unarmed, and because this house is solidly built and my voice would
not carry to the floor above. Also because you are so nimble that
no doubt you could give me the slip long before Captain Boyer and
his men came to my rescue. Yes, Sir Percy; for the moment you are a
free man! Free to walk out of this house unharmed. But even now,
you are not as free as you would wish to be, eh? You are free to
despise me, to overwhelm me with lofty scorn, to sharpen your wits
at my expense; but you are not free to indulge your desire to
squeeze the life out of me, to shake me as you would a rat. And
shall I tell you why? Because you know now that if at a certain
hour of the day I do not pay my daily visit to Captain Boyer
upstairs, he will shoot his prisoner without the least
compunction."</p>

<p>Whereupon Blakeney threw up his head and laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"You are absolutely priceless, my dear M. Chambertin!" he said
gaily. "But you really must put your cravat straight. It has once
again become disarranged...in the heat of your oratory, no
doubt...Allow me to offer you a pin."</p>

<p>And with inimitable affectation, he took a pin out of his own
cravat and presented it to Chauvelin, who, unable to control his
wrath, jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>"Sir Percy&mdash;!" he snarled.</p>

<p>But Blakeney placed a gentle, firm hand upon his shoulder,
forcing him to sit down again.</p>

<p>"Easy, easy, my friend," he said. "Do not, I pray you, lose that
composure for which you are so justly famous. There! Allow me to
arrange your cravat for you. A gentle tug here," he added, suiting
the action to the word, "a delicate flick there, and you are the
most perfectly cravatted man in France!"</p>

<p>"Your insults leave me unmoved, Sir Percy," Chauvelin broke in
savagely, and tried to free himself from the touch of those
slender, strong hands that wandered so uncomfortably in the
vicinity of his throat.</p>

<p>"No doubt," Blakeney riposted lightly, "that they are as futile
as your threats. One does not insult a cur, any more than one
threatens Sir Percy Blakeney&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"You are right there, Sir Percy. The time for threats has gone
by. And since you appear so vastly entertained&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> vastly entertained, my dear M. Chambertin! How can
I help it, when I see before me a miserable shred of humanity who
does not even know how to keep his tie straight or his hair smooth,
calmly&mdash;or almost calmly&mdash;talking of&mdash;Let me see,
what were you talking of, my amiable friend?"</p>

<p>"Of the hostage, Sir Percy, which we hold until the happy day
when the gallant Scarlet Pimpernel is a prisoner in our hands."</p>

<p>"'M, yes! He was that once before, was he not, my good sir?
Then, too, you laid down mighty schemes for his capture."</p>

<p>"And we succeeded."</p>

<p>"By your usual amiable methods&mdash;lies, deceit, forgery. The
latter has been useful to you this time too, eh?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Sir Percy?"</p>

<p>"You had need of the assistance of a fair lady for your schemes.
She appeared disinclined to help you. So when her inconvenient
lover, Bertrand Moncrif, was happily dragged away from her path,
you forged a letter, which the lady rightly looked upon as an
insult. Because of that letter, she nourished a comfortable amount
of spite against me, and lent you her aid in the fiendish outrage
for which you are about to receive punishment."</p>

<p>He had raised his voice slightly while he spoke, and Chauvelin
cast an apprehensive glance in the direction of the door behind
which he guessed that Theresia Cabarrus must be straining her ears
to listen.</p>

<p>"A pretty story, Sir Percy," he said with affected coolness.
"And one that does infinite credit to your imagination. It is mere
surmise on your part."</p>

<p>"What, my friend? What is surmise? That you gave a letter to
Madame de Fontenay which you had concocted, and which I had never
written? Why, man," he added with a laugh, "I saw you do it!"</p>

<p>"You? Impossible!"</p>

<p>"More impossible things than that will happen within the next
few days, my good sir. I was outside the window of Madame de
Fontenay's apartment during the whole of your interview with her.
And the shutters were not as closely fastened as you would have
wished. But why argue about it, my dear M. Chambertin, when you
know quite well that I have given you a perfectly accurate exposé
of the means which you employed to make a pretty and spoilt woman
help you in your nefarious work?"</p>

<p>"Why argue, indeed?" Chauvelin retorted dryly. "The past is
past. I'll answer to my country, which you outrage by your
machinations, for the methods which I employ to circumvent them.
Your concern and mine, my gallant friend, is solely with the
future&mdash;with the next four days, in fact...After which, either
the Scarlet Pimpernel is in our hands, or Lady Blakeney will be put
against the wall upstairs and summarily shot."</p>

<p>Then only did something of his habitual lazy non-chalance go out
of Blakeney's attitude. Just for the space of a few seconds he drew
himself up to his full magnificent height, and from the summit of
his splendid audacity and the consciousness of his own power, he
looked down at the mean, cringing figure of the enemy who had
hurled this threat of death against the woman he worshipped.
Chauvelin vainly tried to keep up some semblance of dignity; he
tried to meet the glance which no longer mocked, and to close his
ears to the voice which, sonorous and commanding, now threatened in
its turn.</p>

<p>"And you really believe," Sir Percy Blakeney said slowly and
deliberately, "that you have the power to carry through your
infamous schemes? That I&mdash;yes, I!&mdash;would allow you to
come within measurable distance of their execution? Bah! my dear
friend. You have learned nothing by past experience&mdash;not even
this: that when you dared to lay your filthy hands upon Lady
Blakeney, you and the whole pack of assassins who have terrorized
this beautiful country far too long, struck the knell of your
ultimate doom. You have dared to measure your strength against mine
by perpetrating an outrage so monstrous in my sight that, to punish
you, I&mdash;even I!&mdash;will sweep you off the face of the earth
and send you to join the pack of unclean ghouls who have aided you
in your crimes. After which&mdash;thank the Lord!&mdash;the earth,
being purged of your presence, will begin to smell sweetly
again."</p>

<p>Chauvelin made a vain effort to laugh, to shrug his shoulders,
to put on those airs of insolence which came so naturally to his
opponent. No doubt the strain of this long interview with his enemy
had told upon his nerves. Certain it is that at this moment, though
he was conscious enough to rail inwardly at his own cowardice, he
was utterly unable to move or to retort. His limbs felt heavy as
lead, an icy shudder was coursing down his spine. It seemed in
truth as if some uncanny ghoul had entered the dreary, dank
apartment and with gaunt, invisible hand was tolling a silent
passing bell&mdash;the death-knell of all his ambitions and all his
hopes. He closed his eyes, for he felt giddy and sick. When he
opened his eyes again he was alone.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>Chapter XXVI&mdash;A Dream</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>Chauvelin had not yet regained full possession of his faculties,
when a few seconds later he saw Theresia Cabarrus glide swiftly
across the antechamber. She appeared to him like a ghost&mdash;a
pixie who had found her way through a keyhole. But she threw him a
glance of contempt that was very human, very feminine indeed, and
the next moment she was gone.</p>

<p>Outside on the landing she paused. Straining her ears, she
caught the sound of a firm footfall slowly descending the stairs.
She ran down a few steps, then called softly:</p>

<p>"Milor!"</p>

<p>The footsteps paused, and a pleasant voice gave quiet reply:</p>

<p>"At your service, fair lady!"</p>

<p>Theresia, shrewd as well as brave, continued to descend. She was
not in the least afraid. Instinct had told her before now that no
woman need ever have the slightest fear of that elegant milor with
the quaint laugh and gently mocking mien, whom she had learned to
know over in England.</p>

<p>Midway down the stairs she came face to face with him, and when
she paused, panting, a little breathless with excitement, he said
with perfect courtesy:</p>

<p>"You did me the honour to call me, Madame?"</p>

<p>"Yes, milor," she replied, in a quick, eager whisper. "I heard
every word that passed between you and citizen Chauvelin."</p>

<p>"Of course you did, dear lady," he rejoined with a smile. "If a
woman once resisted the temptation of putting a shell-like ear to a
keyhole, the world would lose many a cause for entertainment."</p>

<p>"That letter, milor&mdash;" she broke in impatiently.</p>

<p>"Which letter, Madame?"</p>

<p>"That insulting letter to me...when you took Moncrif away...You
never wrote it?"</p>

<p>"Did you really think that I did?" he retorted.</p>

<p>"No. I ought to have guessed...the moment that I saw you in
England..."</p>

<p>"And realized that I was not a cad&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"Oh, milor!" she protested. "But why&mdash;why did you not tell
me before?"</p>

<p>"It had escaped my memory. And if I remember rightly, you spent
most of the time when I had the honour of walking with you, in
giving me elaborate and interesting accounts of your difficulties,
and I, in listening to them."</p>

<p>"Oh!" she exclaimed vehemently. "I hate that man! I hate
him!"</p>

<p>"In truth, he is not a lovable personality. But, by your leave,
I presume that you did not desire to speak with me so that we might
discuss our friend Chauvelin's amiable qualities."</p>

<p>"No, no, milor!" she rejoined quickly. "I called to you
because&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then she paused for a moment or two, as if to collect her
thoughts. Her eager eyes strove to pierce the gloom that enveloped
the figure of the bold adventurer. She could only see the dim
outline of his powerful figure, the light from above striking on
his smooth hair, the elegantly tied bow at the nape of his neck,
the exquisite filmy lace at his throat and wrists. His head was
slightly bent, one arm in a curve supported his chapeau-bras, his
whole attitude was one befitting a salon rather than this dank
hovel, where death was even now at his elbow; it was as cool and
unperturbed as it had been on that May-day evening, in the hawthorn
scented lanes of Kent.</p>

<p>"Milor," she said abruptly, "you told me once&mdash;you
remember?&mdash;that you were what you English call a sportsman. Is
that so?"</p>

<p>"I hope always to remain that, dear lady," he replied with a
smile.</p>

<p>"Does that mean," she queried, with a pretty air of deference
and hesitation, "does that mean a man who would under no
circumstances harm a woman?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"Now even if she&mdash;if she has sinned&mdash;transgressed
against him?"</p>

<p>"I don't quite understand, Madame," he rejoined simply. "And,
time being short&mdash;Are you perchance speaking of yourself?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I have done you an injury, milor."</p>

<p>"A very great one indeed," he assented gravely.</p>

<p>"Could you," she pleaded, raising earnest, tear-filled eyes to
his, "could you bring yourself to believe that I have been nothing
but a miserable, innocent tool?"</p>

<p>"So was the lady upstairs innocent, Madame," he broke in
quietly.</p>

<p>"I know," she retorted with a sigh. "I know. I would never dare
to plead, as you must hate me so."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders with an air of carelessness.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he said. "Does a man ever hate a pretty woman?"</p>

<p>"He forgives her, milor," she entreated, "if he is a true
sportsman."</p>

<p>"Indeed? You astonish me, dear lady. But in verity you all in
this unhappy country are full of surprises for a plain,
blunt-headed Britisher. Now what, I wonder," he added, with a
light, good-humoured laugh, "would my forgiveness be worth to
you?"</p>

<p>"Everything!" she replied earnestly. "I was deceived by that
abominable liar, who knew how to play upon a woman's pique. I am
ashamed, wretched...Oh, cannot you believe me? And I would give
worlds to atone!"</p>

<p>He laughed in his quiet, gently ironical way.</p>

<p>"You do not happen to possess worlds, dear lady. All that you
have is youth and beauty and ambition, and life. You would forfeit
all those treasures if you really tried to atone."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lady Blakeney is a prisoner...You are her jailer...Her precious
life is the hostage for yours."</p>

<p>"Milor&mdash;" she murmured.</p>

<p>"From my heart, I wish you well, fair one," he broke in lightly.
"Believe me, the pagan gods that fashioned you did not design you
for tragedy...And if you ran counter to your friend Chauvelin's
desires, I fear me that that pretty neck of yours would suffer. A
thing to be avoided at all costs! And now," he added, "have I your
permission to go? My position here is somewhat precarious, and for
the next four days I cannot afford the luxury of entertaining so
fine a lady, by running my head into a noose."</p>

<p>He was on the point of going when she placed a restraining hand
upon his arm.</p>

<p>"Milor!" she pleaded.</p>

<p>"At your service, dear lady!"</p>

<p>"Is there naught I can do for you?"</p>

<p>He looked at her for a moment or two, and even through the gloom
she caught his quizzical look and the mocking lines around his firm
lips.</p>

<p>"You can ask Lady Blakeney to forgive you," he said, with a
thought more seriousness than was habitual to him. "She is an
angel; she might do it."</p>

<p>"And if she does?"</p>

<p>"She will know what to do, to convey her thoughts to me."</p>

<p>"Nay! but I'll do more than that, milor," Theresia continued
excitedly. "I will tell her that I shall pray night and day for
your deliverance and hers. I will tell her that I have seen you,
and that you are well."</p>

<p>"Ah, if you did that&mdash;" he exclaimed, almost
involuntarily.</p>

<p>"You would forgive me, too?" she pleaded.</p>

<p>"I would do more than that, fair one. I would make you Queen of
France, in all but name."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she murmured.</p>

<p>"That I would then redeem the promise which I made to you that
evening, in the lane&mdash;outside Dover. Do you remember?"</p>

<p>She made no reply, closed her eyes; and her vivid fancy, rendered
doubly keen by the mystery which seemed to encompass him as with a
supernal mantle, conjured up the vision of that unforgettable
evening: the moonlight, the scent of the hawthorn, the call of the
thrush. She saw him stooping before her, and kissing her
finger-tips, even whilst her ears recalled every word he had spoken
and every inflexion of his mocking voice:</p>

<p>"Let me rather put it differently, dear lady," he had said then.
"One day the exquisite Theresia Cabarrus, the Egeria of the
Terrorists, the fiancée of the great Tallien, might need the help
of the Scarlet Pimpernel."</p>

<p>And she, angered, piqued by his coolness, thirsting for revenge
for the insult which she believed he had put upon her, had then
protested earnestly:</p>

<p>"I would sooner die," she had boldly asserted, "than seek your
help, milor!"</p>

<p>And now, at this hour, here in this house where Death lurked in
every corner, she could still hear his retort:</p>

<p>"Here in Dover, perhaps...But in France?"</p>

<p>How right he had been!...How right! She&mdash;who had thought
herself so strong, so powerful&mdash;what was she indeed but a
miserable tool in the hands of men who would break her without
scruple if she ran counter to their will? Remorse was not for
her&mdash;atonement too great a luxury for a tool of Chauvelin to
indulge in. The black, hideous taint, the sin of having dragged
this splendid man and that innocent woman to their death, must rest
upon her soul for ever. Even now she was jeopardizing his life,
every moment that she kept him talking in this house. And yet the
impulse to speak with him, to hear him say a word of forgiveness,
had been unconquerable. One moment she longed for him to go; the
next she would have sacrificed much to keep him by her side. When
he wished to go, she held him back. Now that, with his wonted
careless disregard of danger, he appeared willing to linger, she
sought for the right words wherewith to bid him go.</p>

<p>He seemed to divine her thoughts, remained quite still while she
stood there with eyes closed, in one brief second reviewing the
past. All! All! It all came back to her: her challenge to him, his
laughing retort.</p>

<p>"You mean," she said at parting, "that you would risk your life
to save mine?"</p>

<p>"I should not risk my life, dear lady," he had said, with his
puzzling smile; "But I should&mdash;God help me!&mdash;do my best,
if the need arose, to save yours."</p>

<p>Then he had gone, and she had stood under the porch of the
quaint old English inn and watched his splendid figure as it
disappeared down the street. She had watched, puzzled,
uncomprehending, her heart already stirred by that sweet, sad ache
which at this hour brought tears to her eyes&mdash;the aching
sorrow of that which could never, never be. Ah! if it had been her
good fortune to have come across such a man, to have aroused in him
that admiration for herself which she so scorned in others, how
different, how very different would life have been! And she fell to
envying the poor prisoner upstairs, who owned the most precious
treasure life can offer to any woman: the love of a fine man. Two
hot tears came slowly through her closed eyes, coursing down her
cheeks.</p>

<p>"Why so sad, dear lady?" he asked gently.</p>

<p>She could not speak for the moment, only murmured vaguely:</p>

<p>"Four days&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Four days," he retorted gaily, "as you say! In four days,
either I or a pack of assassins will be dead."</p>

<p>"Oh, what will become of me?" she sighed.</p>

<p>"Whatever you choose."</p>

<p>"You are bold, milor," she rejoined more calmly. "And you are
brave. Alas! what can you do, when the most powerful hands in
France are against you?"</p>

<p>"Smite them, dear lady," he replied airily. "Smite them! Then
turn my back upon this fair land. It will no longer have need of
me." Then he made her a courteous bow. "May I have the honour of
escorting you upstairs? Your friend M. Chauvelin will be awaiting
you."</p>

<p>The name of her taskmaster brought Theresia back to the
realities of life. Gone was the dream of a while ago, when
subconsciously her mind had dwelt upon a sweet might-have-been. The
man was nothing to her&mdash;less than nothing; a common spy, so
her friends averred. Even if he had not presumed to write her an
insulting letter, he was still the enemy&mdash;the foe whose hand
was raised against her own country and against those with whose
fortunes she had thrown in her lot. Even now, she ought to be
calling loudly for help, rouse the house with her cries, so that
this spy, this enemy, might be brought down before her eyes.
Instead of which, she felt her heart beating with apprehension lest
his quiet even voice be heard on the floor above, and he be caught
in the snare which those who feared and hated him had laid for
him.</p>

<p>Indeed, she appeared far more conscious of danger than he was;
and while she chided herself for her folly in having called to him,
he was standing before her as if he were in a drawing-room, holding
out his arm to escort her in to dinner. His foot was on the step,
ready to ascend, even whilst Theresia's straining ears caught the
sound of other footsteps up above: footsteps of men&mdash;real men,
those!&mdash;who were set up there to watch for the coming of the
Scarlet Pimpernel, and whose vigilance had been spurred by promise
of reward and by threat of death. She pushed his arm aside almost
roughly.</p>

<p>"You are mad, milor!" she said, in a choked murmur. "Such
foolhardiness, when your life is in deadly jeopardy, becomes
criminal folly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The best of life," he said airily, "is folly. I would not miss
this moment for a kingdom!"</p>

<p>She felt like a creature under a spell. He took her hand and
drew it through his arm. She went up the steps beside him.</p>

<p>Every moment she thought that one or more of the soldiers would
be coming down, or that Chauvelin, impatient at her absence, might
step out upon the landing. The dank, murky air seemed alive with
ominous whisperings, of stealthy treads upon the stone. Theresia
dared not look behind her, fearful lest the grim presence of Death
itself be suddenly made manifest before her.</p>

<p>On the landing he took leave of her, stooped and kissed her
hand.</p>

<p>"Why, how cold it is!" he remarked with a smile.</p>

<p>His was perfectly steady and warm. The very feel of it seemed to
give her strength. She raised her eyes to his.</p>

<p>"Milor," she entreated, "on my knees I beg of you not to toy
with your life any longer."</p>

<p>"Toy with my life?" he retorted gaily. "Nothing is further from
my thoughts."</p>

<p>"You must know that every second which you spend in this house
if fraught with the greatest possible danger."</p>

<p>"Danger? Ne'er a bit, dear lady! I am no longer in danger, now
that you are my friend."</p>

<p>The next moment he was gone. For awhile, Theresia's straining
ears still caught the sound of his firm footfall upon the stone
steps. Then all was still; and she was left wondering if, in very
truth, the last few minutes on the dark stairs had not all been
part of a dream.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch27" id="ch27"></a>Chapter XXVII&mdash;Terror or
Ambition</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>Chauvelin had sufficiently recovered from the emotions of the
past half-hour to speak coolly and naturally to Theresia. Whether
he knew that she had waylaid Sir Percy Blakeney on the stairs or
no, she could not conjecture. He made no reference to his interview
with the Scarlet Pimpernel, nor did he question her directly as to
whether she had overheard what passed between them.</p>

<p>Certainly his attitude was a more dictatorial one than it had
been before. Some of his first words to her contained a veiled
menace. Whether the sense of coming triumph gave him a fresh
measure of that arrogance which past failures had never wholly
subdued, or whether terror for the future caused him to bluster and
to threaten, it were impossible to say.</p>

<p>"Vigilance!" he said to Theresia, after a curt greeting.
"Incessant vigilance, night and day, is what your country demands
of you now, citizeness! All our lives now depend upon our
vigilance."</p>

<p>"Yours perhaps, citizen," she rejoined coolly. "You seem to
forget that I am not bound&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You? Not bound?" he broke in roughly, and with a strident
laugh. "Not bound to aid in bringing the most bitter enemy of your
country to his knees? Not bound, now that success is in sight?"</p>

<p>"You only obtained my help by a subterfuge," she retorted; "by a
forged letter and a villainous lie&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bah! Are you going to tell me, citizeness, that all means are
not justifiable when dealing with those whose hands are raised
against France? Forgery?" he went on, with passionate earnestness.
"Why not? Outrage? Murder? I would commit every crime in order to
serve the country which I love, and hound her enemies to death. The
only crime that is unjustifiable, citoyenne, is indifference. You?
Not bound? Wait! Wait, I say! And if by your indifference or your
apathy we fail once more to bring that elusive enemy to book, wait
then until you stand at the bar of the people's tribunal, and in
the face of France, who called to you for help, of France, who
beset by a hundred foes, stretch appealing arms to you, her
daughter, you turned a deaf ear to her entreaties, and, shrugging
your fair shoulders, calmly pleaded, 'Bah! I was not bound!'"</p>

<p>He paused, carried away by his own enthusiasm, feeling perhaps
that he had gone too far, or else had said enough to enforce the
obedience which he exacted. After awhile, since Theresia remained
silent too, he added more quietly:</p>

<p>"If we capture the Scarlet Pimpernel this time, citizeness,
Robespierre shall know from my lips that it is to you and to you
alone that he owes this triumph over the enemy whom he fears above
all. Without you, I could not have set the trap out of which he
cannot now escape."</p>

<p>"He can escape! He can!" she retorted defiantly. "The Scarlet
Pimpernel is too clever, too astute, too audacious, to fall into
your trap."</p>

<p>"Take care, citoyenne, take care! Your admiration for that
elusive hero carries you beyond the bounds of prudence."</p>

<p>"Bah! If he escapes, 'tis you who will be blamed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And 'tis you who will suffer, citoyenne," he riposted blandly.
With which parting shaft he left her certain that she would ponder
over his threats as well as over his bold promise of a rich
reward.</p>

<p>Terror and ambition! Death, or the gratitude of Robespierre! How
well did Chauvelin gauge the indecision, the shallowness of a
fickle woman's heart! Theresia, left to herself, had only those two
alternatives over which to ponder. Robespierre's gratitude, which
meant that the admiration which already he felt for her would turn
to stronger passion. He was still heart-whole, that she knew. The
regard which he was supposed to feel for the humble cabinet-maker's
daughter could only be a passing fancy. The dictator of France must
choose a mate worthy of his power and of his ambition; his friends
would see to that. Robespierre's gratitude! What a vista of
triumphs and of glory did that eventuality open up before her, what
dizzy heights of satisfied ambition! And what a contrast if
Chauvelin's scheme failed in the end!</p>

<p>"Wait," he had cried, "until you stand at the bar of the
people's tribunal and plead indifference!"</p>

<p>Theresia shuddered. Despite the close atmosphere of the
apartment, she was shivering with cold. Her loneliness, her
isolation, here in this house, where an appalling and grim tragedy
was even now in preparation, filled her with sickening dread.
Overhead she could hear the soldiers moving about, and in one of
the rooms close by her sensitive ear caught the sound of Mother
Théot's shuffling tread.</p>

<p>But the sound that was most insistent, that hammered away at her
heart until she could have screamed with the pain, was the echo of
a lazy, somewhat inane laugh and of a gently mocking voice that
said lightly:</p>

<p>"The best of life is folly, dear lady. I would not miss this
moment for a kingdom."</p>

<p>Her hand went up to her throat to smother the sobs that would
rise up against her will. Then she called all her self-control, all
her ambition, to her aid. This present mood was sentimental
nonsense, an abyss created by an over-sensitive heart, into which
she might be falling headlong. What was this Englishman to her that
thought of his death should prove such mental agony? As for him, he
only laughed at her; despised her still, probably; hated her for
the injury she had done to that woman upstairs whom he loved.</p>

<p>Impatient to get away from this atmosphere of tragedy and of
mysticism which was preying on her nerves, Theresia called
peremptorily to Mother Théot, and when the old woman came shuffling
out of her room, demanded her cloak and hood.</p>

<p>"Have you seen aught of citizen Moncrif?" she asked, just before
going away.</p>

<p>"I caught sight of him over the way," Catherine Théot replied,
"watching this house, as he always does when you, citoyenne, are in
it."</p>

<p>"Ah!" the imperious beauty retorted, with a thought of spite in
her mellow voice. "Would you could give him a potion, Mother, to
cure him of his infatuation for me!"</p>

<p>"Despise no man's love, citoyenne," the witch retorted
sententiously. "Even that poor vagabond's blind passion may yet
prove thy salvation."</p>

<p>A moment or two later Theresia was once more on the dark stairs
where she had dreamed of the handsome milor. She sighed as she ran
swiftly down&mdash;sighed, and looked half-fearfully about her. She
still felt his presence through the gloom; and in the ghostly light
that feebly illumined the corner whereon he had stood, she still
vaguely saw in spirit his tall straight figure, stooping whilst he
kissed her hand. At one moment she was quite sure that she heard
his voice and the echo of his pleasant laugh.</p>

<p>Down below, Bertrand Moncrif was waiting for her, silent,
humble, with the look of a faithful watch-dog upon his pale, wan
face.</p>

<p>"You make yourself ill, my poor Bertrand," Theresia said, not
unkindly, seeing that he stood aside to let her pass, fearful of a
rebuff if he dared speak to her. "I am in no danger, I assure you;
and this constant dogging of my footsteps can do no good to you or
to me."</p>

<p>"But it can do no harm," he pleaded earnestly. "Something tells
me, Theresia, that danger does threaten you, unbeknown to you, from
a quarter least expected."</p>

<p>"Bah!" she retorted lightly. "And if it did, you could not avert
it."</p>

<p>He made a desperate effort to check the words of passionate
protestations which rose to his lips. He longed to protect her from
harm, how happy he would be if he might die for her. But obviously
he dared not say what lay nearest to his heart. All he could do now
was to talk silently by her side as far as her lodgings in the Rue
Villedot, grateful for this small privilege, uncomplaining and
almost happy because she tolerated his presence, and because while
she walked the ends of her long scarf stirred by the breeze would
now and again flutter against his cheek.</p>

<p>Miserable Bertrand! He had laden his soul with an abominable
crime for this woman's sake; and he had not even the satisfaction
of feeling that she gave him an infinitesimal measure of
gratitude.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch28" id="ch28"></a>Chapter XXVIII&mdash;In the
Meanwhile</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>Chauvelin, who, despite his many failures, was still one of the
most conspicuous&mdash;since he was one of the most
unscrupulous&mdash;members of the Committee of Public Saftey, had
not attended its sittings for some days. He had been too deeply
absorbed in his own schemes to trouble about those of his
colleagues. In truth, the coup which he was preparing was so
stupendous, and if it succeeded his triumph would be so
magnificent, that he could well afford to hold himself aloof. Those
who were still inclined to scorn and to scoff at him to-day would
be his most cringing sycophants on the morrow.</p>

<p>He knew well enough&mdash;none better&mdash;that during this
time the political atmosphere in the Committees and the Clubs was
nothing short of electrical. He felt, as every one did, that
something catastrophic was in the air, that death, more
self-evident than ever before, lurked at every man's elbow, and
stalked round the corner of every street.</p>

<p>Robespierre, the tyrant, the autocrat whose mere word swayed the
multitude, remained silent and impenetrable, absent from every
gathering. He only made brief appearances at the Convention, and
there sat moody and self-absorbed. Every one knew that this man,
dictator in all but name, was meditating a Titanic attack upon his
enemies. His veiled threats, uttered during his rare appearances at
the speaker's tribune, embraced even the most popular, the most
prominent, amongst the representatives of the people. Every one, in
fact, who was likely to stand in his way when he was ready to
snatch the supreme power. His intimates&mdash;Couthon, St. Just,
and the others&mdash;openly accused of planning a dictatorship for
their chief, hardly took the trouble to deny the impeachment, even
whilst Tallien and his friends, feeling that the tyrant had already
decreed their doom, went about like ghostly shadows, not daring to
raise their voice in the Convention lest the first word they
uttered brought down the sword of his lustful wrath upon their
heads.</p>

<p>The Committee of Public Safety&mdash;now re-named the
Revolutionary Committee&mdash;strove on the other hand by a
recrudescence of cruelty to ingratiate itself with the potential
dictator and to pose before the people as alone pure and
incorruptible, blind in justice, inexorable where the safety of the
Republic was concerned. Thus an abominable emulation of vengeance
and of persecution went on between the Committee and Robespierre's
party, wherein neither side could afford to give in, for fear of
being accused of apathy and of moderation.</p>

<p>Chauvelin, for the most part, had kept out of the turmoil. He
felt that in his hands lay the destiny of either party. His one
thought was of the Scarlet Pimpernel and of his imminent capture,
knowing that, with the most inveterate opponent of revolutionary
excesses in his hands, he would within an hour be in a position to
link his triumph with one or the other of the parties&mdash;either
with Robespierre and his herd of butchers, or with Tallien and the
Moderates.</p>

<p>He was the mysterious and invisible deus ex machina, who anon,
when it suited his purpose, would reveal himself in his full glory
as the man who had tracked down and brought to the guillotine the
most dangerous enemy of the revolutionary government. And, so
easily is a multitude swayed, that that one fact would bring him
popularity transcending that of every other man in France. He,
Chauvelin, the despised, the derided, whose name had become
synonymous with Failure, would then with a word sweep those aside
who had mocked him, hurl his enemies from their pedestals, and name
at will the rulers of France. All within four days!</p>

<p>And of these, two had gone by.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>These days in mid-July had been more than usually sultry. It
seemed almost as if Nature had linked herself with the passions of
men, and hand in hand with Vengeance, Lust and Cruelty, had
rendered the air hot and heavy with the presage of on-coming
storm.</p>

<p>For Marguerite Blakeney these days had gone by like a nightmare.
Cut off from all knowledge of the outside world, without news from
her husband for the past forty-eight hours, she was enduring mental
agony such as would have broken a weaker or less trusting
spirit.</p>

<p>Two days ago she had received a message, a few lines hastily
scribbled by an unknown hand, and brought to her by the old woman
who waited upon her.</p>

<p>"I have seen him," the message said. "He is well and full of
hope. I pray God for your deliverance and his, but help can only
come by a miracle."</p>

<p>The message was written in a feminine hand, with no clue as to
the writer.</p>

<p>Since then, nothing.</p>

<p>Marguerite had not seen Chauvelin again, for which indeed she
thanked Heaven on her knees. But every day at a given hour she was
conscious of his presence outside her door. She heard his voice in
the vestibule: there would be a word or two of command, the
grounding of arms, then some whispered talking; and presently
Chauvelin's stealthy footstep would slink up to her door. And
Marguerite would remain still as a mouse that scents the presence
of a cat, holding her breath, life almost at a standstill in this
agony of expectation.</p>

<p>The remainder of the day time hung with a leaden weight on her
hands. She was given no books to read, not a needle wherewith to
busy herself. She had no one to speak to save old Mother Théot, who
waited on her and brought her her meals, nearly always in silence,
and with a dour mien which checked any attempt at conversation.</p>

<p>For company, the unfortunate woman had nothing but her own
thoughts, her fears which grew in intensity, and her hopes which
were rapidly dwindling, as hour followed hour and day succeeded day
in dreary monotony. No sound around her save the incessant tramp,
tramp of sentries at her door, and every two hours the changing of
the guard in the vestibule outside; then the whispered colloquies,
the soldiers playing at cards or throwing dice, the bibulous songs,
the ribald laughter, the obscene words flung aloud like bits of
filthy rag; the life, in fact, that revolved around her jailers and
seemed at a standstill within her prison walls.</p>

<p>In the late afternoons the air would become insufferably hot,
and Marguerite would throw open the window and sit beside it, her
gaze fixed upon the horizon far away, her hands lying limp and
moist upon her lap.</p>

<p>Then she would fall to dreaming. Her thoughts, swifter than
flight of swallows, would cross the sea and go roaming across
country to her stately home in Richmond, where at this house the
moist, cool air was fragrant with the scent of late roses and of
lime blossom, and the murmur of the river lapping the mossy bank
whispered of love and of peace. In her dream she would see the tall
figure of her beloved coming toward her. The sunset was playing
upon his smooth hair and upon his strong, slender hands, always
outstretched toward the innocent and the weak. She would hear his
dear voice calling her name, feel his arms around her, and her
senses swooning in the ecstasy of that perfect moment which comes
just before a kiss.</p>

<p>She would dream...only to wake up the next moment to hear the
church clock of St. Antoine striking seven, and a minute or two
later that ominous shuffling footstep outside her door, those
whisperings, the grounding of arms, a burst of cruel laughter,
which brought her from the dizzy heights of illusive happiness back
to the hideous reality of her own horrible position, and of the
deadly danger which lay in wait for her beloved.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch29" id="ch29"></a>Chapter XXIX&mdash;The Close of
the Second Day</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>Soon after seven o'clock that evening the storm which had
threatened all day burst in its full fury. A raging gale tore at
the dilapidated roofs of this squalid corner of the great city, and
lashed the mud of the streets into miniature cascades. Soon the
rain fell in torrents; one clap of thunder followed on another with
appalling rapidity, and the dull, leaden sky was rent with vivid
flashes of lightning.</p>

<p>Chauvelin, who had paid his daily visit to the Captain in charge
of the prisoner in the Rue de la Planchette, was unable to proceed
homewards. Wrapped in his cloak, he decided to wait in the disused
storage-room below until it became possible for an unfortunate
pedestrian to sally forth into the open.</p>

<p>There seems no doubt that at this time the man's very soul was
on the rack. His nerves were stretched to breaking point, not only
by incessant vigilance, by obsession of the one idea, the one aim,
but also by multifarious incidents which his overwrought
imagination magnified into attempts to rob him of his prey.</p>

<p>He trusted no one&mdash;not Mother Théot, not the men upstairs,
not Theresia: least of all Theresia. And his tortured brain
invented and elaborated schemes whereby he set one set of spies to
watch another, one set of sleuthhounds to run after another, in a
kind of vicious and demoniac circle of mistrust and denunciation.
Nor did he trust himself any longer: neither his instinct nor his
eyes, nor his ears. His intimates&mdash;and he had very few of
these&mdash;said of him at that time that, if he had his way, he
would have had every tatterdemalion in the city branded, like
Rateau, lest they were bribed or tempted into changing identities
with the Scarlet Pimpernel.</p>

<p>Whilst waiting for a lull in the storm, he was pacing up and
down the dank and murky storage house, striving by febrile
movements to calm his nerves. Shivering, despite the closeness of
the atmosphere, he kept the folds of his mantle closely wrapped
around his shoulders.</p>

<p>It was impossible to keep the outer doors open, because the rain
beat in wildly on that side, and the place would have been in utter
darkness but for an old grimy lanthorn which some prudent hand had
set up on a barrel in the centre of the vast space, and which shed
a feeble circle of light around. The latch of the wicket appeared
to be broken, for the small door, driven by the wind, flapped
backwards and forwards with irritating ceaselessness. At one time
Chauvelin tried to improvise some means of fastening it, for the
noise helped to exacerbate his nerves and, leaning out into the
street in order to seize hold of the door, he saw the figure of a
man, bent nearly double in the teeth of the gale, shuffling across
the street from the direction of the Porte St. Antoine.</p>

<p>It was then nearly eight o'clock, and the light treacherous, but
despite the veil of torrential rain which intervene between him and
that shuffling figure, something in the gait, the stature, the
stoop of the wide, bony shoulders, appeared unpleasantly familiar.
The man's head and shoulders were wrapped in a tattered piece of
sacking, which he held close to his chest. His arms were bare, as
were his shins, and on his feet he had a pair of sabots stuffed
with straw.</p>

<p>Midway across the street he paused, and a tearing fit of
coughing seemed to render him momentarily helpless. Chauvelin's
first instinct prompted him to run to the stairs and to call for
assistance from the Captain Boyer. Indeed, he was half-way up to
the first floor when, looking down, he saw that the man had entered
the place through the wicket-door. Still coughing and spluttering,
he had divested himself of his piece of sacking and was crouching
down against the barrel in the centre of the room and trying to
warm his hands by holding them against the glass sides of the old
lanthorn.</p>

<p>From where he stood, Chauvelin could see the dim outline of the
man's profile, the chin ornamented with a three-days' growth of
beard, the lank hair plastered above the pallid forehead, the huge
bones, coated with grime, that protruded through the rags that did
duty for a shirt. The sleeves of this tattered garment hung away
from the arm, displaying a fiery, inflamed weal, shaped like the
letter "M," that had recently been burned into the flesh with a
branding iron.</p>

<p>The sight of that mark upon the vagabond's arm caused Chauvelin
to pause a moment, then to come down the stairs again.</p>

<p>"Citizen Rateau!" he called.</p>

<p>The man jumped as if he had been struck with a whip, tried to
struggle to his feet, but collapsed on the floor, while a terrible
fit of coughing took his breath away. Chauvelin, standing beside
the barrel, looked down with a grim smile on this miserable
wreckage of humanity whom he had so judiciously put out of the way
of further mischief. The dim flicker of the lanthorn illumine the
gaunt, bony arm, so that the charred flesh stood out like a
crimson, fiery string against a coating of grime.</p>

<p>Rateau appeared terrified, scared by the sudden apparition of
the man who had inflicted the shameful punishment upon him.
Chauvelin's face, lighted from below by the lanthorn, did indeed
appear grim and forbidding. Some few seconds elapsed before the
coal-heaver had recovered sufficiently to stand on his feet.</p>

<p>"I seem to have scared you, my friend," Chauvelin remarked
dryly.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I did not know," Rateau stammered with a painful
wheeze, "that anyone was here...I came for shelter..."</p>

<p>"I am here for shelter, too," Chauvelin rejoined, "and did not
see you enter."</p>

<p>"Mother Théot allows me to sleep here," Rateau went on mildly.
"I have had no work for two days...not since..." And he looked down
ruefully upon his arm. "People think I am an escaped felon," he
explained with snivelling timidity. "And as I have always lived
just from hand to mouth..."</p>

<p>He paused, and cast an obsequious glance on the Terrorist, who
retorted dryly:</p>

<p>"Better men than you, my friend, live from hand to mouth these
days. Poverty," he continued with grim sarcasm, "exalts a man in
this glorious revolution of ours. 'Tis riches that shame him."</p>

<p>Rateau's branded arm went up to his lanky hair, and he scratched
his head dubiously.</p>

<p>"Aye," he nodded, obviously uncomprehending; "perhaps! But I'd
like to taste some of that shame!"</p>

<p>Chauvelin shrugged his shoulders and turned on his heel. The
thunder sounded a little more distant and the rain less violent for
the moment, and he strode toward the door.</p>

<p>"The children run after me now," Rateau continued dolefully. "In
my quartier, the concierge turned me out of my lodging. They keep
asking me what I have done to be branded like a convict."</p>

<p>Chauvelin laughed.</p>

<p>"Tell them you've been punished for serving the English spy," he
said.</p>

<p>"The Englishman paid me well, and I am very poor," Rateau
retorted meekly. "I could serve the State now...if it would pay me
well."</p>

<p>"Indeed? How?"</p>

<p>"By telling you something, citizen, which you would like to
know."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>At once the instinct of the informer, of the sleuthhound, was on
the <i>qui vive</i>. The coal-heaver's words, the expression of
cunning on his ugly face, the cringing obsequiousness of his
attitude, all suggested the spirit of intrigue, of underhand
dealing, of lies and denunciations, which were as the breath of
life to this master-spy. He retraced his steps, came and sat upon a
pile of rubbish beside the barrel, and when Rateau, terrified
apparently at what he had said, made a motion as if to slink away,
Chauvelin called him back peremptorily.</p>

<p>"What is it, citizen Rateau," he said curtly, "that you could
tell me, and that I would like to know?"</p>

<p>Rateau was cowering in the darkness, trying to efface his huge
bulk and to smother his rasping cough.</p>

<p>"You have said too much already," Chauvelin went on harshly, "to
hold your tongue. And you have nothing to fear...everything to
gain. What is it?"</p>

<p>For a moment Rateau leaned forward, struck the ground with his
fist.</p>

<p>"Am I to be paid this time?" he asked.</p>

<p>"If you speak the truth&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"How much?"</p>

<p>"That depends on what you tell me. And now, if you hold your
tongue, I shall call to the citizen Captain upstairs and send you
to jail."</p>

<p>The coal-heaver appeared to crouch yet further into himself. He
looked like a huge, shapeless mass in the gloom. His huge yellow
teeth could be heard chattering.</p>

<p>"Citizen Tallien will send me to the guillotine," he
murmured.</p>

<p>"What has citizen Tallien to do with it?"</p>

<p>"He pays great attention to the citoyenne Cabarrus."</p>

<p>"And it is about her?"</p>

<p>Rateau nodded.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Chauvelin reiterated harshly.</p>

<p>"She is playing you false, citizen," Rateau murmured in a hoarse
breath, and crawled like a long, bulky worm a little closer to the
Terrorist.</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"She is in league with the Englishman."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"I saw her here...two days ago...You remember, citizen...after
you..."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" Chauvelin cried impatiently.</p>

<p>"Sergeant Chazot took me to the cavalry barracks...They gave me
to drink...and I don't remember much what happened. But when I was
myself again, I know that my arm was very sore, and when I looked
down I saw this awful mark on it...I was just outside the Arsenal
then...How I got there I don't know...I suppose Sergeant Chazot
brought me back...He says I was howling for Mother Théot...She has
marvellous salves, you know, citizen."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!"</p>

<p>"I came in here...My head still felt very strange...and my arm
felt like living fire. Then I heard voices...they came from the
stairs...I looked about me, and saw them standing there..."</p>

<p>Rateau, leaning upon one arm, stretched out the other and
pointed to the stairs, Chauvelin, with a violent gesture, seized
him by the wrist.</p>

<p>"Who?" he queried harshly. "Who was standing there?"</p>

<p>His glance followed the direction in which the coal-heaver was
pointing, then instinctively wandered back and fastened on that
fiery letter "M" which had been seared into the vagabond's
flesh.</p>

<p>"The Englishman and citoyenne Cabarrus," Rateau replied feebly,
for he had winced with pain under the excited grip of the
Terrorist.</p>

<p>"You are certain?"</p>

<p>"I heard them talking&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What did they say?"</p>

<p>"I do not know...But I saw the Englishman kiss the citoyenne's
hand before they parted."</p>

<p>"And what happened after that?"</p>

<p>"The citoyenne went to Mother Théot's apartment and the
Englishman came down the stairs. I had just time to hide behind
that pile of rubbish. He did not see me."</p>

<p>Chauvelin uttered a savage curse of disappointment.</p>

<p>"Is that all?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"The State will pay me?" Rateau murmured vaguely.</p>

<p>"Not a sou!" Chauvelin retorted roughly. "And if citizen Tallien
hears this pretty tale..."</p>

<p>"I can swear to it?"</p>

<p>"Bah! Citoyenne Cabarrus will swear that you lied. 'Twill be her
word against that of a mudlark!"</p>

<p>"Nay!" Rateau retorted. "'Twill be more than that."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"Will you swear to protect me, citizen, if citizen
Tallien&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes! I'll protect you...And the guillotine has no time to
trouble about suck muck-worms as you!"</p>

<p>"Well, then, citizen," Rateau went on in a hoarse murmur, "if
you will go to the citoyenne's lodgings in the Rue Villedot, I can
show you where the Englishman hides the clothes wherewith he
disguises himself...and the letters which he writes to the
citoyenne when..."</p>

<p>He paused, obviously terrified at the awesome expression of the
other man's face. Chauvelin had allowed the coal-heaver's wrist to
drop out of his grasp. He was sitting quite still, silent and grim,
his thin, claw-like hands closely clasped together and held between
his knees. The flickering light of the lanthorn distorted his
narrow face, lengthened the shadows beneath the nose and chin,
threw a high light just below the brows, so that the pale eyes
appeared to gleam with an unnatural flame. Rateau hardly dared to
move. He lay like a huge bundle of rags in the inky blackness
beyond the circle of light projected by the lanthorn; his breath
came and went with a dragging, hissing sound, now and then broken
by a painful cough.</p>

<p>For a moment or two there was silence in the great disused
store-room&mdash;a silence broken only by the thunder, dull and
distant now, and the ceaseless, monotonous patter of the rain. Then
Chauvelin murmured between his teeth:</p>

<p>"If I thought that she..." But he did not complete the sentence,
jumped to his feet and approached the big mass of rags and humanity
that coward in the gloom. "Get up, citizen Rateau!" he
commanded.</p>

<p>The asthmatic giant struggled to his knees. His wooden shoes had
slipped off his feet. He groped for them, and with trembling hands
contrived to put them on again.</p>

<p>"Get up!" Chauvelin reiterated, with a snarl like an angry
tiger.</p>

<p>He took a small tablet and a leaden point from his pocket, and
stooping toward the light he scribbled a few words, and then handed
the tablet to Rateau.</p>

<p>"Take this over to the Commissary of the Section in the Place du
Carrousel. Half a dozen men and a captain will be detailed to go
with you to the lodgings of the citoyenne Cabarrus in the Rue
Villedot. You will find me there. Go!"</p>

<p>Rateau's hand trembled visibly as he took the tablets. He was
obviously terrified at what he had done. But Chauvelin paid no
further heed to him. He had given him his orders, knowing well that
they would be obeyed. The man had gone too far to draw back. It
never entered Chauvelin's head that the coal-heaver might have lied.
He had no cause for spite against the citoyenne Cabarrus, and the
fair Spaniard stood on too high a pinnacle of influence for false
denunciations to touch her. The Terrorist waited until Rateau had
quietly slunk out by the wicket door; then he turned on his heel
and quickly went up the stairs.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>In the vestibule on the top floor he called to Capitaine
Boyer.</p>

<p>"Citizen Captain," he said at the top of his voice, "You
remember that to-morrow eve is the end of the third day?"</p>

<p>"Pardi!" the Captain retorted gruffly. "Is anything
changed?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then, unless by the eve of the fourth day that cursed
Englishman is not in our hands, my orders are the same."</p>

<p>"Your orders are," Chauvelin rejoined loudly, and pointed with
grim intention at the door behind which he felt Marguerite Blakeney
to be listening for every sound, "unless the English spy is in our
hands on the evening of the fourth day, to shoot your
prisoner."</p>

<p>"It shall be done, citizen!" Captain Boyer gave reply.</p>

<p>Then he grinned maliciously, because from behind the closed door
there had come a sound like a quickly smothered cry.</p>

<p>After which, Chauvelin nodded to the Captain and once more
descended the stairs. A few seconds later he went out of the house
into the stormy night.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch30" id="ch30"></a>Chapter XXX&mdash;When the Storm
Burst</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>Fortunately the storm only broke after the bulk of the audience
was inside the theatre. The performance was timed to commence at
seven, and a quarter of an hour before that time the citizens of
Paris who had come to applaud citoyenne Vestris, citoyen Talma, and
their colleagues, in Chénier's tragedy, <i>Henri VIII</i>, were in
their seats.</p>

<p>The theatre in the Rue de Richelieu was crowded. Talma and
Vestris had always been great favourites with the public, and more
so perhaps since their secession from the old and reactionary
Comédie Française. Citizen Chénier's tragedy was in truth of a very
poor order; but the audience was not disposed to be critical, and
there was quite an excited hush in the house when citoyenne
Vestris, in the part of "Anne de Boulen," rolled off the
meretricious verses:</p>

<p class="poem">"Trop longtemps j'ai gardé le silence;<br>
Le poids qui m'accablait tombe avec violence."</p>

<p>But little was heard of the storm which raged outside; only at
times the patter of the rain on the domed roof became unpleasantly
apparent as an inharmonious accompaniment to the declamation of the
actors.</p>

<p>It was a brilliant evening, not only because citoyenne Vestris
was in magnificent form, but also because of the number of
well-known people who sat in the various boxed and in the parterre
and who thronged the foyer during the entr'actes.</p>

<p>It seemed as if the members of the Convention and those who sat
upon the Revolutionary Committees, as well as the more prominent
speakers in the various Clubs, had made a point of showing
themselves to the public, gay, unconcerned, interested in the stage
and in the audience, at this moment when every man's head was
insecure upon his shoulders and no man knew whether on reaching
home he would not find a possee of the National Guard waiting to
convey him to the nearest prison.</p>

<p>Death indeed lurked everywhere.</p>

<p>The evening before, at a supper party given in the house of
deputy Barrère, a paper was said to have dropped out of
Robespierre's coat pocket, and been found by one of the guests. The
paper contained nothing but just forty names. What those names were
the general public did not know, nor for what purpose the dictator
carried the list about in his pocket; but during the representation
of <i>Henri VIII</i>, the more obscure citizens of
Pairs&mdash;happy in their own insignificance&mdash;noted that in
the foyer during the entr'actes, citizen Tallien and his friends
appeared obsequious, whilst those who fawned upon Robespierre were
more than usually arrogant.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>In one of the proscenium boxes, citizeness Cabarrus attracted a
great deal of attention. Indeed, her beauty to-night was in the
opinion of most men positively dazzling. Dressed with almost
ostentatious simplicity, she drew all eyes upon her by her merry,
ringing laughter, the ripple of conversation which flowed almost
incessantly from her lips, and the graceful, provocative gestures
of her bare hands and arms as she toyed with a miniature fan.</p>

<p>Indeed, Theresia Cabarrus was unusually light-hearted to-night.
Sitting during the first two acts of the tragedy in her box, in the
company of citizen Tallien, she became the cynosure of all eyes,
proud and happy when, during the third interval, she received the
visit of Robespierre.</p>

<p>He only stayed with her a few moments, and kept himself
concealed for the most part at the back of the box; but he had been
seen to enter, and Theresia's exclamation, "Ah, citizen
Robespierre! What a pleasant surprise! 'Tis not often you grace the
theatre with your presence!" had been heard all over the house.</p>

<p>Indeed, with the exception of Eleonore Duplay, whose passionate
admiration he rather accepted than reciprocated, the incorruptible
and feline tyrant had never been known to pay attention to any
woman. Great therefore was Theresia's triumph. Visions of that
grandeur which she had always coveted and to which she had always
felt herself predestined, danced before her eyes; and remembering
Chauvelin's prophecies and Mother Théot's incantations, she allowed
the dream-picture of the magnificent English milor to fade slowly
from her ken, bidding it a reluctant adieu.</p>

<p>Though in her heart she still prayed for his
deliverance&mdash;and did it with a passionate
earnestness&mdash;some impish demon would hover at her elbow and
repeat in her unwilling ear Chauvelin's inspired words: "Bring the
Scarlet Pimpernel to his knees at the chariot-wheel of Robespierre,
and the crown of the Bourbons will be yours for the asking." And
if, when she thought of that splendid head falling under the
guillotine, a pang of remorse and regret shot through her heart,
she turned with a seductive smile to the only man who could place
that crown at her feet. His popularity was still at its zenith.
To-night, whenever the audience caught sight of him in the Cabarrus'
box, a wild cheer rang out from gallery to pit of the house. Then
Theresia would lean over to him and whisper insinuatingly:</p>

<p>"You can do anything with that crowd, citizen! You hold the
people by the magnetism of your presence and of your voice. There
is no height to which you cannot aspire."</p>

<p>"The greater the height," he murmured moodily, "the dizzier the
fall..."</p>

<p>"'Tis on the summit you should gaze," she retorted; "not on the
abyss below."</p>

<p>"I prefer to gaze into the loveliest eyes in Paris," he replied
with a clumsy attempt at gallantry; "and remain blind to the
summits as well as to the depths."</p>

<p>She tapped her daintily shod foot against the ground and gave an
impatient little sigh. It seemed as if at every turn of fortune she
was confronted with pusillanimity and indecision. Tallien fawning
on Robespierre; Robespierre afraid of Tallien; Chauvelin a prey to
nerves. How different to them all was that cool, self-possessed
Englishman with the easy good-humour and splendid
self-assurance!</p>

<p>"I would make you Queen of France in all but name!" He said this
as easily, as unconcernedly as if he were promising an invitation
to a rout.</p>

<p>When, a moment or two later, Robespierre took leave of her and
she was left for a while alone with her thoughts, Theresia no
longer tried to brush away from her mental vision the picture on
which her mind loved to dwell. The tall, magnificent figure; the
lazy, laughing eyes; the slender hand that looked so firm and
strong amidst the billows of exquisite lace.</p>

<p>Ah, well! The dream was over! It would never come again. He
himself had wakened her; he himself had cast the die which must end
his splendid life, even at the hour when love and fortune smiled at
him through the lips and eyes of beautiful Cabarrus.</p>

<p>Fate, in the guise of the one man she could have loved, was
throwing Theresia into the arms of Robespierre.</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>The next moment she was rudely awakened from her dreams. The
door of her box was torn open by a violent hand, and turning, she
saw Bertrand Moncrif, hatless, with hair dishevelled, clothes
dripping and mud-stained, and linen soaked through. She was only
just in time to arrest with a peremptory gesture the cry which was
obviously hovering on his lips.</p>

<p>"Hush&mdash;sh&mdash;sh!" came at once from every portion of the
audience, angered by this disturbing noise.</p>

<p>Tallien jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he demanded in a quick whisper.</p>

<p>"A perquisition," Moncrif replied hurriedly, "in the house of
the citoyenne!"</p>

<p>"Impossible!" she broke in harshly.</p>

<p>"Hush!...Silence!" the audience muttered audibly.</p>

<p>"I come from there," Moncrif murmured. "I have
seen...heard..."</p>

<p>"Come outside," Theresia interjected. "We cannot talk here."</p>

<p>She led the way out, and Tallien and Moncrif followed.</p>

<p>The corridor fortunately was deserted. Only a couple of
ouvreuses stood gossiping in a corner. Theresia, white to the
lips&mdash;but more from anger than fear&mdash;dragged Moncrif with
her to the foyer. Here there was no one.</p>

<p>"Now, tell me!" she commanded.</p>

<p>Bertrand passed his trembling hand through his soaking hair. His
clothes were wet through. He was shaking from head to foot and
appeared to have run till now he could scarcely stand.</p>

<p>"Tell me!" Theresia reiterated impatiently.</p>

<p>Tallien stood by, half paralysed with terror. He did not
question the younger man, but gazed on him with compelling,
horror-filled eyes, as if he would wrench the words out of him
before they reached his throat.</p>

<p>"I was in the Rue Villedot," Moncrif stammered breathlessly at
last, "when the storm broke. I sought shelter under the portico of a
house opposite the citoyenne's lodgings...I was there a long time.
Then the storm subsided...Men in uniform came along...They were
soldiers of the National Guard...I could see that, though the
street was pitch-dark...They passed quite close to me...They were
talking of the citoyenne...Then they crossed over to her
lodgings...I saw them enter the house...I saw citizen Chauvelin in
the doorway...He chided them for being late...There was a captain,
and there were six soldiers, and that asthmatic coal-heaver was with
them."</p>

<p>"What!" Theresia exclaimed. "Rateau?"</p>

<p>"What in Satan's name does it all mean?" Tallien exclaimed with
a savage curse.</p>

<p>"They went into the house," Moncrif went on, his voice rasping
through his parched throat. "I followed at a little distance, to
make quite sure before I came to warn you. Fortunately I knew where
you were...fortunately I always know..."</p>

<p>"You are sure they went up to my rooms?" Theresia broke in
quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes. Two minutes later I saw a light in your apartment."</p>

<p>She turned abruptly to Tallien.</p>

<p>"My cloak!" she commanded. "I left it in the box."</p>

<p>He tried to protest.</p>

<p>"I am going," she rejoined firmly. "This is some ghastly
mistake, for which that fiend Chauvelin shall answer with his life.
My cloak!"</p>

<p>It was Bertrand who went back for the cloak and wrapped her in
it. He knew&mdash;none better&mdash;that if his divinity desired to
go, no power on earth would keep her back. She did not appear in
the least afraid, but her wrath was terrible to see, and boded ill
to those who had dared provoke it. Indeed, Theresia, flushed with
her recent triumph and with Robespierre's rare if clumsy
gallantries still ringing in her ear, felt ready to dare anything,
to brave anyone&mdash;even Chauvelin and his threats. She even
succeeded in reassuring Tallien, ordered him to remain in the
theatre, and to show himself to the public as utterly
unconcerned.</p>

<p>"In case a rumour of this outrage penetrates to the audience,"
she said, "you must appear to make light of it...Nay! you must at
once threaten reprisals against its perpetrators."</p>

<p>Then she wrapped her cloak about her and, taking Bertrand's arm,
she hurried out of the theatre.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch31" id="ch31"></a>Chapter XXXI&mdash;Our Lady of
Pity</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>It was like an outraged divinity in the face of sacrilege that
Theresia Cabarrus appeared in the antechamber of her apartment, ten
minutes later.</p>

<p>Her rooms were full of men; sentries were at the door; the
furniture was overturned, the upholstery ripped up, cupboard doors
swung open; even her bed and bedding lay in a tangled heap upon the
floor. The lights in the rooms were dim, one single lamp shedding
its feeble rays from the antechamber into the living-room, whilst
another flickered on a wall-bracket in the passage. In the bedroom
the maid Pepita, guarded by a soldier, was loudly lamenting and
cursing in voluble Spanish.</p>

<p>Citizen Chauvelin was standing in the centre of the living-room,
intent on examining some papers. In a corner of the antechamber
cowered the ungainly figure of Rateau the coal-heaver.</p>

<p>Theresia took in the whole tragic picture at a glance; then with
a proud, defiant toss of the head she swept past the soldiers in
the antechamber and confronted Chauvelin, before he had time to
notice her approach.</p>

<p>"Something has turned your brain, citizen Chauvelin," she said
coolly. "What is it?"</p>

<p>He looked up, encountered her furious glance, and at once made
her a profound, ironical bow.</p>

<p>"How wise was our young friend there to tell you of our visit,
citoyenne," he said suavely.</p>

<p>And he looked with mild approval in the direction where Bertrand
Moncrif stood between two soldiers, who had quickly barred his
progress and were holding him tightly by the wrists.</p>

<p>"I came," Theresia retorted harshly, "as the forerunner of those
who will know how to punish this outrage, citizen Chauvelin."</p>

<p>Once more he bowed, smiling blandly.</p>

<p>"I shall be as ready to receive them," he said quietly, "as I am
gratified to see the citoyenne Cabarrus. When they come, shall I
direct them to call and see their beautiful Egeria at the
Conciergerie, whither we shall have the honour to convey her
immediately?"</p>

<p>Theresia threw back her head and laughed; but her voice sounded
hard and forced.</p>

<p>"At the Conciergerie?" she exclaimed. "I?"</p>

<p>"Even you, citoyenne," Chauvelin replied.</p>

<p>"On what charge, I pray you?" she demanded, with biting
sarcasm.</p>

<p>"Of trafficking with the enemies of the Republic."</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"You are mad, citizen Chauvelin!" she riposted with perfect
sang-froid. "I pray you, order your men to re-establish order to my
apartment; and remember that I will hold you responsible for any
damage that has been done."</p>

<p>"Shall I also," Chauvelin rejoined with equally perfect
equanimity, "replace these letters and other interesting objects,
there where we found them?"</p>

<p>"Letters?" she retorted, frowning. "What letters?"</p>

<p>"These, citoyenne," he replied, and held up to her gaze the
papers which he had in his hand.</p>

<p>"What are they? I have never seen them before."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, we found them in that bureau." And Chauvelin
pointed to a small piece of furniture which stood against the wall,
and the drawers of which had obviously been forcibly torn open.
Then as Theresia remained silent, apparently understanding, he
went on suavely: "They are letters written at different times to
Mme de Fontenay, née Cabarrus&mdash;<i>Our Lady of Pity</i>, as she
was called by grateful Bordeaux."</p>

<p>"By whom?" she asked.</p>

<p>"By the interesting hero of romance who is known to the world as
the Scarlet Pimpernel."</p>

<p>"It is false!" she retorted firmly. "I have never received a
letter from him in my life!"</p>

<p>"His handwriting is all too familiar to me, citoyenne; and the
letters are addressed to you."</p>

<p>"It is false!" she reiterated with unabated firmness. "This is
some devilish trick you have devised in order to ruin me. But take
care, citizen Chauvelin, take care! If this is a trial of strength
'twixt you and me, the next few hours will show who will gain the
day."</p>

<p>"If it were a trail of strength 'twixt you and me, citoyenne,"
he rejoined blandly, "I would already be a vanquished man. But it
is France this time who has challenged a traitor. That traitor is
Theresia Fontenay, née Cabarrus. The trial of strength is between
her and France."</p>

<p>"You are mad, citizen Chauvelin! If there were letters writ by
the Scarlet Pimpernel found in my rooms, 'tis you who put them
there!"</p>

<p>"That statement you will be at liberty to substantiate
to-morrow, citoyenne," he retorted coldly, "at the bar of the
revolutionary tribunal. There, no doubt, you can explain away how
citizen Rateau knew of the existence of those letters, and led me
straight to their discovery. I have an officer of the National
Guard, the commissary of the section, and half a dozen men, to
prove the truth of what I say, and to add that in a wall-cupboard
in your antechamber we also found this interesting collection, the
use of which you, citoyenne, will no doubt be able to explain."</p>

<p>He stepped aside and pointed to a curious heap which littered
the floor&mdash;rags for the most part: a tattered shirt, frayed
breeches, a grimy cap, a wig made up of lank, colourless hair, the
counterpart of that which adorned the head of the coal-heaver
Rateau.</p>

<p>Theresia looked on those rags for a moment in a kind of
horrified puzzlement. Her cheeks and lips became the colour of
ashes. She put her hand up to her forehead, as if to chase a
hideous, ghoulish vision away, and smothered a cry of horror.
Puzzlement had given place to a kind of superstitious dread. The
room, the rags, the faces of the soldiers began to whirl around
her&mdash;impish shapes to dance a wild saraband before her eyes.
And in the midst of this witch's cauldron the figure of Chauvelin,
like a weird hobgoblin, was executing elf-like contortions and
brandishing a packet of letters writ upon scarlet paper.</p>

<p>She tried to laugh, to speak defiant words; but her throat felt
as if it were held in a vice, and losing momentary consciousness
she tottered, and only saved herself from measuring her length upon
the floor by clinging with both hands to a table immediately
behind her.</p>

<p>As to what happened after that, she only had a blurred
impression. Chauvelin gave a curt word of command, and a couple of
soldiers came and stood to right and left of her. Then a piercing
cry rang through the narrow rooms, and she saw Bertrand Moncrif for
one moment between herself and the soldiers, fighting desperately,
shielding her with his body, tearing and raging like a wild animal
defending its young. The whole room appeared full of deafening
noise: cries and more cries&mdash;words of command&mdash;calls of
rage and of entreaty. Then suddenly the word "Fire!" and the
detonation of a pistol at close range, and the body of Bertrand
Moncrif sliding down limp and impotent to the floor.</p>

<p>After that, everything became dark around her. Theresia felt as
if she were looking down an immeasurable abyss of inky blackness,
and that she was falling, falling...</p>

<p>A thin, dry laugh brought her back to her senses, her pride to
the fore, her vanity up in arms. She drew her statuesque figure up
to its full height and once more confronted Chauvelin like an
august and outraged divinity.</p>

<p>"And at whose word," she demanded, "is this monstrous charge to
be brought against me?"</p>

<p>"At the word of a free citizen of the State," Chauvelin replied
coldly.</p>

<p>"Bring him before me."</p>

<p>Chauvelin shrugged his shoulders and smiled indulgently, like
one who is ready to humour a wayward child.</p>

<p>"Citizen Rateau!" he called.</p>

<p>From the anteroom there came the sound of much shuffling,
spluttering, and wheezing; then the dull clatter of wooden shoes
upon the carpeted floor; and presently the ungainly, grime-covered
figure of the coal-heaver appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>Theresia looked on him for a few seconds in silence, then she
gave a ringing laugh, and with exquisite bare arm outstretched she
pointed to the scrubby apparition.</p>

<p>"That man's word against mine!" she called, with well-assumed
mockery. "Rateau, the caitiff against Theresia Cabarrus, the
intimate friend of citizen Robespierre! What a subject for a
lampoon!"</p>

<p>Then her laughter broke. She turned once more on Chauvelin like
an angry goddess.</p>

<p>"That vermin!" she exclaimed, her voice hoarse with indignation.
"That sorry knave with a felon's brand! In truth, citizen
Chauvelin, your spite must be hard put to it to bring up such a
witness against me!"</p>

<p>Then suddenly her glance fell upon the lifeless body of Bertrand
Moncrif, and on the horrible crimson stain which discoloured his
coat. She gave a shudder of horror, and for a moment her eyes
closed and her head fell back, as if she were about to swoon. But
she quickly recovered herself. Her will-power at this moment was
unconquerable. She looked with unutterable contempt on Chauvelin;
then she raised her cloak, which had slipped down from her
shoulders, and wrapped it with a queen-like gesture around her, and
without another word led the way out of the apartment.</p>

<p>Chauvelin remained standing in the middle of the room, his face
quite expressionless, his clawlike hands still fingering the
fateful letters. Two soldiers remained with him beside the body of
Bertrand Moncrif. The maid Pepita, still shrieking and
gesticulating violently, had to be dragged away in the wake of her
mistress.</p>

<p>In the doorway between the living-room and the antechamber,
Rateau, humble, snivelling, more than a little frightened, stood
aside in order to allow the guard and their imperious prisoner to
pass. Theresia did not condescend to look at him again; and he,
shuffling and stumbling in his clumsy wooden shoes, followed the
soldiers down the stairs.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>It was still raining hard. The captain who was in charge of
Theresia told her that he had a chaise ready for her. It was
waiting out in the street. Theresia ordered him to send for it; she
would not, she said, offer herself as a spectacle to the riff-raff
who happened to be passing by. The captain had probably received
orders to humour the prisoner as far as was compatible with safety.
Certain it is that he sent one of his men to fetch the coach and to
order the concierge to throw open the porte-cochère.</p>

<p>Theresia remained standing in the narrow vestibule at the foot
of the stairs. Two soldiers stood on guard over the maid, whilst
another stood beside Theresia. The captain, muttering with
impatience, paced up and down the stone-paved floor. Rateau had
paused on the stairs, a step or two just above where Theresia was
standing. On the wall opposite, supported by an iron bracket, a
smoky oil-lamp shed a feeble, yellowish flicker around.</p>

<p>A few minutes went by; then a loud clatter woke the echoes of
the dreary old house, and a coach drawn by two ancient,
half-starved nags, lumbered into the courtyard and came to a halt
in front of the open doorway. The captain gave a sigh of relief,
and called out: "Now then, citoyenne!" whilst the soldier who had
gone to fetch the coach jumped down from the box-seat and, with his
comrades, stood at attention. The maid was summarily bundled into
the coach, and Theresia was ready to follow.</p>

<p>Just then the draught through the open door blew her velvet
cloak against the filthy rags of the miserable ruffian behind her.
An unexplainable impulse caused her to look up, and she encountered
his eyes fixed upon her. A dull cry rose to her throat, and
instinctively she put up her hand to her mouth, striving to smother
the sound. Horror dilated her eyes, and through her lips one word
escaped like a hoarse murmur:</p>

<p>"You!"</p>

<p>He put a grimy finger to his lips. But already she had recovered
herself. Here then was the explanation of the mystery which
surrounded this monstrous denunciation. The English milor had
planned it as revenge for the injury done to his wife.</p>

<p>"Captain!" she cried out shrilly. "Beware! The English spy is at
your heels!"</p>

<p>But apparently the captain's complaisance did not go to the
length of listening to the ravings of his fair prisoner. He was
impatient to get this unpleasant business over.</p>

<p>"Now then, citoyenne!" was his gruff retort. "En voiture!"</p>

<p>"You fool!" she cried, bracing herself against the grip of the
soldiers who were on the point of seizing her. "'Tis the Scarlet
Pimpernel! If you let him escape&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Scarlet Pimpernel?" the Captain retorted with a laugh.
"Where?"</p>

<p>"The coal-heaver! Rateau! 'Tis he, I tell you!" And Theresia's
cries became more frantic as she felt herself unceremoniously
lifted off the ground. "You fool! You fool! You are letting him
escape!"</p>

<p>"Rateau, the coal-heaver?" the captain exclaimed. "We have heard
that pretty story before. Here, citizen Rateau!" he went on, and
shouted at the top of his voice. "Go and report yourself to citizen
Chauvelin. Tell him you are the Scarlet Pimpernel! As for you,
citoyenne, enough of this shouting&mdash;what? My orders are to
take you to the Conciergerie, and not to run after
spies&mdash;English, German, or Dutch. Now then, citizen
soldiers!..."</p>

<p>Theresia, throwing her dignity to the winds, did indeed raise a
shout that brought the other lodgers of the house to their door.
But her screams had become inarticulate, as the soldiers, in
obedience to the captains impatient orders, had wrapped her cloak
about her head. Thus the inhabitants of the dreary old house in the
Rue Villedot could only ascertain that the citoyenne Cabarrus who
lodged on the third floor had been taken to prison, screaming and
fighting, in a manner that no self-respecting aristo had ever
done.</p>

<p>Theresia Cabarrus was ignominiously lifted into the coach and
deposited by the side of equally noisy Pepita. Through the folds of
the cloak her reiterated cry could still faintly be heard:</p>

<p>"You fool! You traitor! You cursed, miserable fool!"</p>

<p>One of the lodgers on the second floor&mdash;a young woman who
was on good terms with every male creature that wore
uniform&mdash;leaned over the balustrade of the balcony and shouted
gaily down:</p>

<p>"Hey, citizen captain! Why is the aristo screaming so?"</p>

<p>One of the soldiers looked up, and shouted back:</p>

<p>"She has hold of the story that citizen Rateau is an English
milor in disguise, and she wants to run after him!"</p>

<p>Loud laughter greeted this tale, and a lusty cheer was set up as
the coach swung clumsily out of the courtyard.</p>

<p>A moment or two later, Chauvelin, followed by the two soldiers,
came quickly down the stairs. The noise from below had at last
reached his ears. At first he too thought that it was only the
proud Spaniard who was throwing her dignity to the winds. Then a
word or two sounded clearly above the din:</p>

<p>"The Scarlet Pimpernel! The English spy!"</p>

<p>The words acted like a sorcerer's charm&mdash;a call from the
vast deep. In an instant the rest of the world ceased to have any
importance in his sight. One thing and one alone mattered; his
enemy.</p>

<p>Calling to the soldiers to follow him, he was out of the
apartment and down in the vestibule below in a trice. The coach at
that moment was turning out of the porte-cochère. The courtyard,
wrapped in gloom, was alive with chattering and laughter which
proceeded from the windows and balconies around. It was raining
fast, and from the balconies the water was pouring down in
torrents.</p>

<p>Chauvelin stood in the doorway and sent one of the soldiers to
ascertain what the disturbance had all been about. The man returned
with an account of how the aristo had screamed and raved like a
mad-woman, and tried to escape by sending the citizen captain on a
fool's errand, vowing that poor old Rateau was an English spy in
disguise.</p>

<p>Chauvelin gave a sigh of relief. He certainly need not rack his
nerves or break his head over that! He had good cause to know that
Rateau, with the branded arm, could not possibly be the Scarlet
Pimpernel!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch32" id="ch32"></a>Chapter XXXII&mdash;Grey Dawn</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the courtyard and approach of the old house in
the Rue Villedot were once more wrapped in silence and in darkness.
Chauvelin had with his own hands affixed the official seals on the
doors which led to the apartments of citoyenne Cabarrus. In the
living room, the body of the unfortunate Moncrif still lay
uncovered and unwatched, awaiting what hasty burial the commissary
of the section would be pleased to order for it. Chauvelin
dismissed the soldiers at the door, and himself went his way.</p>

<p>The storm was gradually dying away. By the time that the
audience filed out of the theatre, it was scarcely raining. Only
from afar, dull rumblings of thunder could still faintly be heard.
Citizen Tallien hurried along on foot to the Rue Villedot. The last
hour had been positive torture for him. Although his reason told
him that no man would be fool enough to trump up an accusation
against Theresia Cabarrus, who was the friend, the Egeria of every
influential man in the Convention or the Clubs, and that she
herself had always been far too prudent to allow herself to be
compromised in any way&mdash;although he knew all that, his
overwrought fancy conjured up visions which made him sick with
dread. His Theresia in the hands of rough soldiery&mdash;dragged to
prison&mdash;he himself unable to ascertain what had become of
her&mdash;until he saw her at the bar of that awful tribunal, from
which there was no issue save the guillotine!</p>

<p>And with this dread came unendurable, gnawing remorse. He
himself was one of the men who had helped to set up the machinery
of wild accusations, monstrous tribunals and wholesale
condemnations which had been set in motion now by an unknown hand
against the woman he loved. He&mdash;Tallien&mdash;the ardent
lover, the future husband of Theresia, had aided in the
constitution of that abominable Revolutionary Committee, which
could strike at the innocent as readily and as ruthlessly as at the
guilty.</p>

<p>Indeed at this hour, this man, who long since had forgotten how
to pray, when he heard the tower-clock of a neighbouring church
striking the hour, turned his eyes that were blurred with tears
towards the sacred edifice which he had helped to desecrate, and
found in his heart a half-remembered prayer which he murmured to
the Fount of all Mercy and of Pardon.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>Citizen Tallien turned into the Rue Villedot, the street where
lodged his beloved. A minute or so later, he was making his way up
the back staircase of the dingy house where his divinity had dwelt
until now. On the second-floor landing two women stood gossiping.
One of them recognized the influential Representative.</p>

<p>"It is citizen Tallien," she said.</p>

<p>And the other woman at once volunteered the information:</p>

<p>"They have arrested the citoyenne Cabarrus," she said; "and the
soldiers did not know whither they were taking her."</p>

<p>Tallien did not wait to listen further. He stumbled up the
stairs to the third floor, to the door which he knew so well. His
trembling fingers wandered over the painted panels. They
encountered the official seals, which told their own mute tale.</p>

<p>The whole thing, then, was not a dream. Those assassins had
taken his Theresia and dragged her to prison, would drag her on the
morrow to an outrageous mockery of a tribunal first, and then to
death! Who shall say what wild thoughts of retrospection and of
remorse coursed through the brain of this man&mdash;himself one of
the makers of a bloody revolution? What visions of past ideals,
good intentions, of honest purpose and incessant labour, passed
before his mind? That glorious revolution, which was to mark the
regeneration of mankind, which was to have given liberty to the
oppressed, equality to the meek, fraternity in one vast human
family! And what did it lead to but to oppression far more cruel
than all that had gone before, to fratricide and to arrogance on
the one side, servility on the other, to constant terror of death,
to discouragement and sloth?</p>

<p>For hours citizen Tallien sat in the dark, on the staircase
outside Theresia's door, his head buried in his hands. The grey
dawn, living and chill, which came peeping in through the skylight
overhead, found him still sitting there, stiff and numb with
cold.</p>

<p>Whether what happened after that was part of a dream, he never
knew. Certain it is that presently something extraneous appeared to
rouse him. He sat up and listened, leaned his back against the
wall, for he was very tired. Then he heard&mdash;or thought he
heard&mdash;firm, swift steps on the stairs, and soon after saw the
figure of two men coming up the stairs. Both the men were very
tall, one of them unusually so, and the ghostly light of dawn made
him appear unreal and mysterious. He was dressed with marvellous
elegance; his smooth, fair hair was tied at the nape of the neck
with a satin bow; soft, billowy lace gleamed at his wrists and
throat, and his hands were exquisitely white and slender. Both the
men wore huge coats of fine cloth, adorned with many capes, and
boots of fine leather, perfectly cut.</p>

<p>They paused on the vestibule outside the door of Theresia's
apartment, and appeared to be studying the official seals affixed
upon the door. Then one of them&mdash;the taller of the
two&mdash;took a knife out of his pocket and cut through the tapes
which held the seals together. Then together they stepped coolly
into the apartment.</p>

<p>Tallien had watched them, dazed and fascinated. He was so numb
and weary that his tongue&mdash;just like it does in
dreams&mdash;refused him service when he tried to call. But now he
struggled to his feet and followed in the wake of the two
mysterious strangers. With him, the instinct of the official, the
respect due to regulations and laws framed by his colleagues and
himself, had been to strong to allow him to tamper with the seals,
and there was something mysterious and awesome about that tall
figure of a man, dressed with supreme elegance, whose slender, firm
hands had so unconcernedly committed this flagrant breach of the
law. It did not occur to Tallien to call for help. Somehow, the
whole incident&mdash;the two men&mdash;were so ghostlike, that he
felt that at a word they would vanish into thin air.</p>

<p>He stepped cautiously into the familiar little antechamber. The
strangers had gone through to the living-room. One of them was
kneeling on the floor. Tallien, who knew nothing of the tragedy
which had been enacted inside the apartment of his beloved,
marvelled what the men were doing. He crept stealthily forward and
craned his neck to see. The window at the end of the room had been
left unfastened. A weird grey streak of light came peeping in and
illumined the awesome scene: the overturned furniture, the torn
hangings; and on the ground, the body of a man, with the stranger
kneeling beside it.</p>

<p>Tallien, weary and dazed, always of a delicate constitution,
felt nigh to swooning. His knees were shaking, a cold dread of the
supernatural held his heart with an icy grip and caused his hair to
tingle at the roots. His tongue felt huge and as if paralysed, his
teeth were chattering together. It was as much as he could do not
to measure his length on the ground; and the vague desire to remain
unobserved kept him crouching in the gloom.</p>

<p>He just could see the tall stranger pass his hands over the body
on the floor, and could hear the other ask him a question in
English.</p>

<p>A few moments went by. The strangers conversed in a low tone of
voice. From one or two words which came clearly to his ear, Tallien
gathered that they spoke in English&mdash;a language with which he
himself was familiar. The taller man of the two appeared to be
giving his friend some orders, which the latter promised to obey.
Then, with utmost precaution, he took the body in his arms and
lifted it from the floor.</p>

<p>"Let me help you, Blakeney," the other said in a whisper.</p>

<p>"No, no!" the mysterious stranger replied quickly. "The poor
worm is as light as a feather! 'Tis better he died as he did. His
unfortunate infatuation was killing him."</p>

<p>"Poor little Régine!" the younger man sighed.</p>

<p>"It is better so," his friend rejoined. "We'll be able to tell
her that he died nobly, and that we've given him Christian
burial."</p>

<p>No wonder that Tallien thought that he was dreaming! These
English were strange folk indeed! Heaven alone knew what they
risked by coming here, at this hour, and into this house, in order
to fetch away the body of their friend. They certainly were wholly
unconscious of danger.</p>

<p>Tallien held his breath. He saw the splendid figure of the
mysterious adventurer step across the threshold, bearing the
lifeless body in his arms with as much ease as if he were carrying
a child. The pale grey light of morning was behind him, and his
fine head with its smooth fair hair was silhouetted against the
neutral-tinted background. His friend came immediately behind
him.</p>

<p>In the dark antechamber he paused, and called abruptly:</p>

<p>"Citizen Tallien!"</p>

<p>A cry rose to Tallien's throat. He had thought himself entirely
unobserved, and the stranger a mere vision which he was watching in
a dream. Now he felt that compelling eyes were gazing straight at
him, piercing the darkness for a clearer sight of his face.</p>

<p>But the spell was still on him, and he only moved in order to
straighten himself out and to force his trembling knees to be
still.</p>

<p>"They have taken the citoyenne Cabarrus to the Conciergerie,"
the stranger went on simply. "To-morrow she will be charged before
the Revolutionary Tribunal....You know what is the inevitable
end&mdash;"</p>

<p>It seemed as if some subtle magic was in the man's voice, in his
very presence, in the glance wherewith he challenged that of the
unfortunate Tallien. The latter felt a wave of shame sweep over
him. There was something so splendid in these two
men&mdash;exquisitely dressed, and perfectly deliberate and cool in
all their movements&mdash;who were braving and daring death in
order to give Christian burial to their friend; whilst he, in face
of the outrage put upon his beloved, had only sat on her desecrated
doorstep like a dumb animal pining for its master. He felt a hot
flush rush to his cheeks. With quick, nervy movements he readjusted
the set of his coat, passed his thin hands over his rumpled hair;
whilst the stranger reiterated with solemn significance:</p>

<p>"You know what is the inevitable end...The citoyenne Cabarrus
will be condemned..."</p>

<p>Tallien this time met the stranger's eyes fearlessly. It was the
magic of strength and of courage that flowed into him from them. He
drew up his meagre stature to its full height and threw up his head
with an air of defiance and of conscious power.</p>

<p>"Not while I live!" he said firmly.</p>

<p>"Theresia Cabarrus will be condemned to-morrow," the stranger
went on calmly. "Then the next day, the guillotine&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never!"</p>

<p>"Inevitably!...Unless&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unless what?" Tallien queried, and hung breathless on the man's
lips as he would on those of an oracle.</p>

<p>"Theresia Cabarrus, or Robespierre and his herd of assassins.
Which shall it be, citizen Tallien?"</p>

<p>"By Heaven!" Tallien exclaimed forcefully.</p>

<p>But he got no further. The stranger, bearing his burden, had
already gone out of the room, closely followed by his friend.</p>

<p>Tallien was alone in the deserted apartment, where every broken
piece of furniture, every torn curtain, cried out for vengeance in
the name of his beloved. He said nothing. He neither protested nor
swore. But he tip-toed into the apartment and knelt down upon the
floor close beside the small sofa on which she was wont to sit.
Here he remained quite still for a minute or two, his eyes closed,
his hands tightly clasped together. Then he stooped very low and
pressed his lips against the spot where her pretty, sandalled foot
was wont to rest.</p>

<p>After that he rose, strode with a firm step out of the
apartment, carefully closing the doors behind him.</p>

<p>The strangers had vanished into the night; and citizen Tallien
went quietly back to his own lodgings.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch33" id="ch33"></a>Chapter XXXIII&mdash;The
Cataclysm</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>Forty names! Found on a list in the pocket of Robespierre's
coat!</p>

<p>Forty names! And every one of these that of a known opponent of
Robespierre's schemes of dictatorship: Tallien, Barrère, Vadier,
Cambon, and the rest. Men powerful to-day, prominent Members of the
Convention, leaders of the people, too&mdash;but opponents!</p>

<p>The inference was obvious, the panic general. That
night&mdash;it was the 8th Thermidor, July the 26th of the old
calendar&mdash;men talked of flight, of abject surrender, of
appeal&mdash;save the mark!&mdash;to friendship, camaraderie,
humanity! Friendship, camaraderie, humanity? An appeal to a heart
of stone! They talked of everything, in face, save of defying the
tyrant; for such talk would have been folly.</p>

<p>Defying the tyrant? Ye gods! When with a word he could sway the
Convention, the Committees, the multitude, bend them to his will,
bring them to heel like any tamer of beasts when he cracks his
whip?</p>

<p>So men talked and trembled. All night they talked and trembled;
for they did not sleep, those forty whose names were on
Robespierre's list. But Tallien, their chief, was nowhere to be
found. 'Twas known that his fiancée, the beautiful Theresia
Cabarrus, had been summarily arrested. Since then he had
disappeared; and they&mdash;the others&mdash;were leaderless. But,
even so, he was no loss. Tallien was ever pusillanimous, a
temporizer&mdash;what?</p>

<p>And now the hour for temporizing is past. Robespierre then is to
be dictator of France. He will be dictator of France, in spite of
any opposition led by those forty whose names are on his list! He
will be dictator of France! He has not said it; but his friends
have shouted it from the house-tops, and have murmured under their
breath that those who oppose Robespierre's dictatorship are
traitors to the land. Death then must be their fate.</p>

<p>When then, ye gods? What then?</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>And so the day broke&mdash;smiling, mark you! It was a beautiful
warm July morning. It broke on what is perhaps the most stupendous
cataclysm&mdash;save one&mdash;the world has ever known.</p>

<p>Behold the picture! A medley. A confusion. A whirl of everything
that is passionate and cruel, defiant and desperate. Heavens, how
desperate! Men who have thrown lives away as if lives were in truth
grains of sand; men who have juggled with death dealt it and tossed
it about like cards upon a gaming table. They are desperate now,
because their own lives are at stake; and they find now that life
can be very dear.</p>

<p>So, having greeted their leader, the forty draw together,
watching the moment when humility will be most opportune.</p>

<p>Robespierre mounts the tribune. The hour has struck. His speech
is one long, impassioned, involved tirade, full at first on vague
accusations against the enemies of the Republic and the people, and
is full of protestations of his own patriotism and selflessness.
Then he warms to his own oratory; his words are prophetic of death,
his voice becomes harsh&mdash;like a screech owl's, so we're told.
His accusations are no longer vague. He begins to strike.</p>

<p>Corruption! Backsliding! Treachery! Moderatism!&mdash;oh,
moderatism above all! Moderatism is treachery to the glorious
revolution. Every victim spared from the guillotine is a traitor
let loose against the people! A traitor, he who robs the guillotine
of her prey! Robespierre stands alone incorruptible, true, faithful
unto death!</p>

<p>And for all that treachery, what remedy is there? Why, death of
course! Death! The guillotine! New power to the sovereign
guillotine! Death to all the traitors!</p>

<p>And seven hundred faces became paler still with dread, and the
sweat of terror rises on seven hundred brows. There were only forty
names on that list...but there might be others somewhere else!</p>

<p>And still the voice of Robespierre thunders on. His words fall
on seven hundred pairs of ears like on a sounding-board; his
friends, his sycophants, echo them; they applaud, rise in wild
enthusiasm. 'Tis the applause that is thundering now!</p>

<p>One of the tyrant's most abject slaves has put forward the
motion that the great speech just delivered shall forthwith be
printed, and distributed to every township, every village,
throughout France, as a monument to the lofty patriotism of her
greatest citizen.</p>

<p>The motion at one moment looks as if it would be carried with
acclamations; after which, Robespierre's triumph would have risen
to the height of deification. Then suddenly the note of dissension;
the hush; the silence. The great Assembly is like a sounding-board
that has ceased to respond. Something had turned the acclamations
to mutterings, and then to silence. The sounding-board has given
forth a dissonance. Citizen Tallien has demanded "delay in printing
that speech," and asked pertinently:</p>

<p>"What has become of the Liberty of Opinion in this
Convention?"</p>

<p>His face is the colour of ashes, and his eyes, ringed with
purple, gleam with an unnatural fire. The coward has become bold;
the sheep has donned the lion's skin.</p>

<p>There is a flutter in the Convention, a moment's hesitation. But
the question is put to the vote, and the speech is not to be
printed. A small matter, in truth&mdash;printing or not
printing...Does the Destiny of France hang on so small a peg?</p>

<p>It is a small matter; and yet how full of portent! Like the
breath of mutiny blowing across a ship. But nothing more occurs
just then. Robespierre, lofty in his scorn, puts the notes of his
speech into his pocket. He does not condescend to argue. He, the
master of France, will not deign to bandy words with his slaves.
And he stalks out of the Hall surrounded by his friends.</p>

<p>There has been a breath of mutiny; but his is still the iron
heel, powerful enough to crush a raging revolt. His
withdrawal&mdash;proud, silent, menacing&mdash;is in keeping with
his character and with the pose which he has assumed of late. But
he is still the Chosen of the People; and the multitude is there,
thronging the streets of Paris&mdash;there, to avenge the insult
put upon their idol by a pack of slinking wolves.</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>And now the picture becomes still more poignant. It is painted
in colours more vivid, more glowing than before and again the Hall of the
Convention is crowded to the roof, with Tallien and his friends, in
a close phalanx, early at their post!</p>

<p>Tallien is there, pale, resolute, the fire of his hatred kept up
by anxiety for his beloved. The night before, at the corner of a
dark street, a surreptitious hand slipped a scrap of paper into the
pocket of his coat. It was a message written by Theresia in prison,
and written with her own blood. How it ever came into his pocket
Tallien never knew; but the few impassioned, agonized words, seared
his very soul and whipped up his courage:</p>

<p>"The Commissary of Police has just left me," Theresia wrote. "He
came to tell me that to-morrow I must appear before the tribunal.
This means the guillotine. And I, who thought that you were a
man...!"</p>

<p>Not only is his own head in peril, not only that of his friends;
but the life of the woman whom he worships hangs now upon the
thread of his own audacity and of his courage.</p>

<p>St. Just on this occasion is the first to mount the tribune; and
Robespierre, the very incarnation of lustful and deadly Vengeance,
stands silently by. He has spent the afternoon and evening with his
friends at the Jacobins' Club, where deafening applause greeted his
every word, and wild fury raged against his enemies.</p>

<p>It is then to be a fight to the finish To your tents, O
Israel!</p>

<p>To the guillotine all those who have dared to say one word
against the Chosen of the People! St. Just shall thunder Vengeance
from the tribune at the Convention, whilst Henriot, the drunken and
dissolute Commandant of the Municipal Guard, shall, but with the might
of the sword and fire, proclaim the sovereignty of Robespierre
through the streets of Paris. That is the picture as it has been
painted in the minds of the tyrant and of his sycophants: a picture
of death paramount, and of Robespierre rising like a new Phoenix
from out the fire of calumny and revolt, greater, more unassailable
than before.</p>

<p>And lo! One sweep of the brush, and the picture is changed.</p>

<p>Ten minutes...less...and the whole course of the world's history
is altered. No sooner had St. Just mounted the tribune than Tallien
jumped to his feet. His voice, usually meek and cultured, rises in
a harsh crescendo, until it drowns that of the younger orator.</p>

<p>"Citizens," he exclaims, "I ask for truth! Let us tear aside the
curtain behind which lurk concealed the real conspirators and the
traitors!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes! Truth! Let us have the truth!" One hundred
voices&mdash;not forty&mdash;have raised the echo.</p>

<p>The mutiny is on the verge of becoming open revolt, is that
already, perhaps. It is like a spark fallen&mdash;who knows
where?&mdash;into a powder magazine. Robespierre feels it, sees the
spark. He knows that one movement, one word, one plunge into that
magazine, foredoomed though it be to destruction, on stamp with a
sure foot, may yet quench the spark, may yet smother the mutiny. He
rushes to the tribune, tries to mount. But Tallien has forestalled
him, elbows him out of the way, and turns to the seven hundred with
a cry that rings far beyond the Hall, out into the streets.</p>

<p>"Citizens!" he thunders in his turn. "I begged of you just now
to tear aside the curtains behind which lurk the traitors. Well,
the curtain is already rent. And if you dare not strike at the
tyrant now, then 'tis I who will dare!" And from beneath his coat
he draws a dagger and raises it above his head. "And I will plunge
this into his heart," he cries, "if you have not the courage to
smite!"</p>

<p>His words, that gleaming bit of steal, fan the spark into a
flame. Within a few seconds, seven hundred voices are shouting,
"Down with the tyrant!" Arms are waving, hands gesticulate wildly,
excitedly. Only a very few shout: "Behold the dagger of Brutus!"
All the others retort with "Tyranny!" and "Conspiracy!" and with
cries of "Vive la Liberté!"</p>

<p>At this hour all is confusion and deafening uproar. In vain
Robespierre tries to speak. He demands to speak. He hurls insults,
anathema, upon the President, who relentless refuses him speech and
jingles his bell against him.</p>

<p>"President of Assassins," the falling tyrant cries, "I demand
speech of thee!"</p>

<p>But the bell goes jingling on, and Robespierre, choked with rage
and terror, "turns blue" we are told, and his hand goes up to his
throat.</p>

<p>"The blood of Danton chokes thee!" cries one man. And these
words seem like the last blow dealt to the fallen foe. The next
moment the voice of an obscure Deputy is raised, in order to speak
the words that have been hovering on every lip:</p>

<p>"I demand a decree of accusation against Robespierre!"</p>

<p>"Accusation!" comes from seven hundred throats. "The decree of
accusation!"</p>

<p>The President jingles his bell, puts the question, and the
motion is passed unanimously.</p>

<p>Maximilien Robespierre&mdash;erstwhile master of France&mdash;is
decreed accused.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch34" id="ch34"></a>Chapter XXXIV&mdash;The
Whirlwind</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>It was then noon. Five minutes later, the Chosen of the People,
the fallen idol, is hustled out of the Hall into one of the
Committee rooms close by, and with his friends&mdash;St. Just,
Couthon, Lebas, his brother Augustin, and the others&mdash;all
decreed accused and the order of arrest launched against them. As
for the rest, 'tis the work of the Public Prosecutor&mdash;and of
the guillotine.</p>

<p>At five o'clock the Convention adjourns. The deputies have
earned food and rest. They rush to their homes, there to relate
what has happened; Tallien to the Conciergerie, to get a sight of
Theresia. This is denied him. He is not dictator yet; and
Robespierre, though apparently vanquished, still
dominates&mdash;and lives.</p>

<p>But from every church steeple the tocsin bursts; and a prolonged
roll of drums ushers in the momentous evening.</p>

<p>In the city all is hopeless confusion. Men are running in every
direction, shouting, brandishing pistols and swords. Henriot,
Commandant of the Municipal Guard, rides through the streets at the
head of his gendarmes like one possessed, bent on delivering
Robespierre. Women and children fly screaming in every direction;
the churches, so long deserted, are packed with people who,
terror-stricken, are trying to remember long-forgotten prayers.</p>

<p>Proclamations are read at street corners; there are rumours of a
general massacre of all the prisoners. At one moment&mdash;the
usual hour&mdash;the familiar tumbril with its load of victims for
the guillotine rattles along the cobblestones of the Rue St.
Antoine. The populace, vaguely conscious of something stupendous in
the air&mdash;even though the decree of accusation against
Robespierre has not yet transpired&mdash;loudly demand the release
of the victims. They surround the tumbrils, crying, "Let them be
free!"</p>

<p>But Henriot at the head of his gendarmes comes riding down the
street, and while the populace shouts, "It shall not be! Let them
be free!" he threatens with pistols and sabre, and retorts,
bellowing: "It shall be! To the guillotine!" And the tumbrils,
which for a moment had halted, lumber on, on their way.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>Up in the attic of the lonely house in the Rue de la Planchette,
Marguerite Blakeney heard but a mere faint echo of the confusion
and of the uproar.</p>

<p>During the previous long, sultry afternoon, it had seemed to her
as if her jailers had been unwontedly agitated. There was much more
moving to and fro on the landing outside her door than there had
been in the last three days. Men talked, mostly in whispers; but at
times a word, a phrase here and there, a voice raised above the
others, reached her straining ears. She glued her ear to the
keyhole and listened; but what she heard was all confusion,
sentences that conveyed but little meaning to her. She
distinguished the voice of the Captain of the Guard. He appeared
impatient about something, and talked about "missing all the fun."
The other soldiers seemed to agree with him. Obviously they were
all drinking heavily, for their voices sounded hoarse and thick,
and often would break into bibulous song. From time to time, too,
she would hear the patter of wooden shoes, together with a wheezy
cough, as from a man troubled with asthma.</p>

<p>But it was all very vague, for her nerves by this time were on
the rack. She had lost count of time, of place; she knew nothing.
She was unable even to think. All her instincts were merged in the
dead of that silent evening hour, when Chauvelin's furtive
footsteps would once more resound upon the stone floor outside her
door, when she would hear the quick word of command that heralded
his approach, the grounding of arms, the sharp query and quick
answer, and when she would feel again the presence of the
relentless enemy who lay in wait to trap her beloved.</p>

<p>At one moment that evening he had raised his voice, obviously so
that she might hear.</p>

<p>"To-morrow is the fourth day, citizen Captain," she had heard
him say. "I may not be able to come."</p>

<p>"Then," the voice of the Captain had said in reply, "if the
Englishman is not here by seven o'clock&mdash;"</p>

<p>Chauvelin had given a harsh, dry laugh, and retorted:</p>

<p>"Your orders are as they were, citizen. But I think that the
Englishman will come."</p>

<p>What it all meant Marguerite could not fail to conjecture. It
meant death to her or to her husband&mdash;to both, in fact. And
all to-day she had sat by the open window, her hands clasped in
silent, constant prayer, her eyes fixed upon the horizon far away,
longing with all her might for one last sight of her beloved,
fighting against despair, striving for trust in him and for
hope.</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>At this hour, the centre of interest is the Place de l'Hôtel de
Ville, where Robespierre and his friends sit entrenched
and&mdash;for the moment&mdash;safe. The prisons have refused one
by one to close their gates upon the Chosen of the People;
governors and jailers alike have quaked in the face of so monstrous
a sacrilege. And the same gendarmes who have been told off to
escort the fallen tyrant to his penultimate resting-place, have had
a touch of the same kind of scruple&mdash;or dread&mdash;and at his
command have conveyed him to the Hôtel de Ville.</p>

<p>In vain does the Convention hastily reassemble. In
vain&mdash;apparently&mdash;does Tallien demand that the traitor
Robespierre and his friends be put outside the pale of the law.
They are for the moment safe, redacting proclamations, sending out
messengers in every direction; whilst Henriot and his gendarmes,
having struck terror in the hearts of all peaceable citizens, hold
the place outside the Town Hall and proclaim Robespierre dictator
of France.</p>

<p>The sun sinks towards the west behind a veil of mist. Ferment
and confusion are at their height. All around the city there is an
invisible barrier that seems to confine agitation within it's
walls. Outside this barrier, no one knows what is happening. Only a
vague dread has filtrated through and gripped every heart. The
guard at the several gates appear slack and undisciplined. Sentries
are accosted by passers-by, eager for news. And, from time to time,
from every direction, troops of the Municipal gendarmes ride
furiously by, with shouts of "Robespierre! Robespierre! Death to
the traitors! Long live Robespierre!"</p>

<p>They raise a cloud of dust around them, trample unheedingly over
every obstacle, human or otherwise, that happens to be in their
way. They threaten peaceable citizens with their pistols and strike
and strike women and children with the flat of their sabres.</p>

<p>As soon as they have gone by, excited groups close up in their
wake.</p>

<p>"Name of a name, what is happening?" every one queries in
affright.</p>

<p>And gossip, conjectures, rumours, hold undisputed sway.</p>

<p>"Robespierre is dictator of France!"</p>

<p>"He has ordered the arrest of all the Members of the
Convention."</p>

<p>"And the massacre of all the prisoners."</p>

<p>"Pardi, a wise decree! As for me, I am sick of the eternal
tumbrils and the guillotine!"</p>

<p>"Better finish with the lot, say I!"</p>

<p>"Robespierre! Robespierre!" comes as a far-off echo, to the
accompaniment of thundering hoofs upon the cobblestones.</p>

<p>And so, from mouth to mouth! The meek and the peace-loving
magnify these rumours into approaching cataclysm; the opportunists
hold their tongue, ready to fall in with this party or that; the
cowards lie in hiding and shout "Robespierre!" with Henriot's horde
or "Tallien!" in the neighbourhood of the Tuileries.</p>

<p>Here the Convention has reassembled, and here they are
threatened presently by Henriot and his artillery. The members of
the great Assembly remain at their post. The President has
harangued them.</p>

<p>"Citizen deputies!" he calls aloud. "The moment has come to die
at our posts!"</p>

<p>As they sit waiting for Henriot's cannonade, and calmly decree
all the rebels "outside the pale of the law."</p>

<p>Tallien, moved by a spirit of lofty courage, goes, followed by a
few intimates, to meet Henriot's gunners boldly face to face.</p>

<p>"Citizen soldiers!" he calls aloud, and his voice has the
resonance of undaunted courage. "After covering yourselves with
glory on the fields of honour, are you going to disgrace your
country?" He points a scornful finger at Henriot who, bloated,
purple in the face, grunting and spluttering like an old seal, is
reeling in his saddle. "Look at him, citizen soldiers!" Tallien
commands. "He is drunk and besotted! What man is there who, being
sober, would dare to order fire against the representatives of the
people?"</p>

<p>The gunners are moved, frightened too by the decree which has
placed them "outside the pale of the law." Henriot, fearing mutiny
if he persisted in the monstrous order to fire, withdraws his
troops back to the Hôtel de Ville.</p>

<p>Some follow him; some do not. And Tallien goes back to the Hall
of the Convention covered with glory.</p>

<p>Citizen Barras is promoted Commandant of the National Guard and
of all forces at the disposal of the Convention, and ordered to
recruit loyal troops that will stand up to the traitor Henriot and
his ruffianly gendarmes. The latter are in open revolt against the
Government; but, name of a name! Citizen Barras, with a few hundred
patriots, will soon put reason&mdash;and a few charges of
gun-powder&mdash;into them!</p>

<p class="cpb">4.</p>

<p>So, at five o'clock in the afternoon, whilst Henriot has once
more collected his gendarmes and the remnants of his artillery
outside the Hôtel de Ville, citizen Barras, accompanied by two
aides-de-camp, goes forth on his recruiting mission. He makes the
round of the city gates, wishing to find out what loyal soldiers
amongst the National Guard the Convention can rely upon.</p>

<p>Chauvelin, on his way to the Rue de la Planchette, meets Barras
at the Porte St. Antoine; and Barras is full of the news.</p>

<p>"Why were you not at your place at the Assembly, citizen
Chauvelin?" he asks of his colleague. "It was the grandest moment I
have ever witnessed! Tallien was superb, and Robespierre ignoble!
And if we succeed in crushing that bloodthirsty monster once and
for all, it will be a new era of civilization and liberty!"</p>

<p>He halts, and continues with a fretful sigh:</p>

<p>"But we want soldiers&mdash;loyal soldiers! All the troops that
we can get! Henriot has the whole of the Municipal Gendarmerie at
his command, with muskets and guns; and Robespierre can always sway
that rabble with a word. We want men!...Men!..."</p>

<p>But Chauvelin is in no mood to listen. Robespierre's fall or his
triumph, what are they to him at this hour, when the curtain is
about to fall on the final act of his own stupendous drama of
revenge? Whatever happens, whoever remains in power, vengeance is
his! The English spy in any event is sure of the guillotine. He is
not the enemy of a party, but of the people of France. And the
sovereignty of the people is not in question yet. Then, what
matters if the wild beasts in the Convention are at one another's
throat?</p>

<p>So Chauvelin listens unmoved to Barras' passionate tirades, and
when the latter, puzzle at his colleague's indifference, reiterates
frowning:</p>

<p>"I must have all the troops I can get. You have some capable
soldiers at your command always, citizen Chauvelin. Where are they
now?"</p>

<p>Chauvelin retorts drily:</p>

<p>"At work. On business at least as important as taking side in a
quarrel between Robespierre and Tallien."</p>

<p>"Pardi!..." Barras protests hotly.</p>

<p>But Chauvelin pays no further attention to him. A neighbouring
church clock has just struck six. Within the hour and his arch
enemy will be in his hands! Never for a moment does he doubt that
the bold adventurer will come to the lonely house in the Rue de la
Planchette. Even hating the Englishman as he does, he knows that
the latter would not endanger his wife's safety by securing his
own.</p>

<p>So Chauvelin turns on his heel, leaving Barras to fume and to
threaten. At the angle of the Porte St. Antoine, he stumbles
against and nearly knocks over a man who sits on the ground, with
his back to the wall, munching a straw, his knees drawn up to his
nose, a crimson cap pulled over his eyes, and his two long arms
encircling his shins.</p>

<p>Chauvelin swore impatiently. His nerves were on the rack, and he
was in no pleasant mood. The man, taken unawares, had uttered an
oath, which died away in a racking fit of coughing. Chauvelin
looked down, and saw the one long arm branded with the letter "M,"
the flesh still swollen and purple with the fire of the searing
iron.</p>

<p>"Rateau!" he ejaculated roughly. "What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>Meek and servile, Rateau struggled with some difficulty to his
feet.</p>

<p>"I have finished my work at Mother Théot's, citizen," he said
humbly. "I was resting."</p>

<p>Chauvelin kicked at him with the toe of his boot.</p>

<p>"Then go and rest elsewhere," he muttered. "The gates of the
city are not refuges for vagabonds."</p>

<p>After which act of unnecessary brutality, his temper momentarily
soothed, he turned on his heel and walked rapidly through the
gate.</p>

<p>Barras had stood by during this brief interlude, vaguely
interested in the little scene. But now, when the coal-heaver
lurched past him, one of his aides-de-camp remarked audibly:</p>

<p>"An unpleasant customer, citizen Chauvelin! Eh, friend?"</p>

<p>"I believe you!" Rateau replied readily enough. Then, with the
mulish persistence of a gabby who is smarting under a wrong, he
thrust out his branded arm right under citizen Barras' nose. "See
what he has done to me!"</p>

<p>Barras frowned.</p>

<p>"A convict, what? Then, how is it you are at large?"</p>

<p>"I am not a convict," Rateau protested with sullen emphasis. "I
am an innocent man, and a free citizen of the Republic. But I got
in citizen Chauvelin's way, what? He is always full of
schemes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are right there!" Barras retorted grimly. But the subject
was not sufficiently interesting to engross his attention further.
He had so many and such momentous things to do. Already he had
nodded to his men and turned his back on the grimy coal-heaver, who,
shaken by a fit of coughing, unable to speak for the moment, had
put out his grimy hand and gripped the deputy firmly by the
sleeve.</p>

<p>"What is it now?" Barras ejaculated roughly.</p>

<p>"If you will but listen, citizen," Rateau wheezed painfully, "I
can tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"You were asking citizen Chauvelin where you could find some
soldiers of the Republic to do you service."</p>

<p>"Yes; I did."</p>

<p>"Well," Rateau rejoined, and an expression of malicious cunning
distorted his ugly face. "I can tell you."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I lodge in an empty warehouse over yonder," Rateau went on
eagerly, and pointed in the direction where Chauvelin's spare
figure had disappeared a while ago. "The floor above is inhabited
by Mother Théot, the witch. You know her, citizen?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes! I thought she had been sent to the guillotine along
with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She was let out of prison, and has been doing some of citizen
Chauvelin's spying for him."</p>

<p>Barras frowned. This was none of his business, and the dirty
coal-heaver inspired him with an unpleasant sense of loathing.</p>

<p>"To the point, citizen!" he said curtly.</p>

<p>"Citizen Chauvelin has a dozen or more soldiers under his
command, in that house," Rateau went on with a leer. "They are
trained troops of the National Guard&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How do you know?" Barras broke in harshly.</p>

<p>"Pardi!" was the coal-heaver's dry reply. "I clean their boots
for them."</p>

<p>"Where is the house?"</p>

<p>"In the Rue de la Planchette. But there is an entrance into the
warehouse at the back of it."</p>

<p>"Allons!" was Barras' curt word of command, to the two men who
accompanied him.</p>

<p>He strode up the street toward the gate, not caring whether
Rateau came along or no. But the coal-heaver followed in the wake of
the three men. He had buried his grimy fists once more in the
pocket of his tattered breeches; but not before he had shaken them,
each in turn, in the direction of the Rue de la Planchette.</p>

<p class="cpb">5.</p>

<p>Chauvelin in the meanwhile had turned into Mother Théot's house,
and without speaking to the old charlatan, who was watching for him
in the vestibule, he mounted to the top floor. Here he called
peremptorily to Captain Boyer.</p>

<p>"There is half an hour yet," the latter murmured gruffly; "and I
am sick of all this waiting! Let me finish with that cursed aristo
in there. My comrades and I want to see what is going on in the
city, and join in the fun, if there is any."</p>

<p>"Half an hour, citizen," Chauvelin rejoined drily. "You'll lose
little of the fun, and you'll certainly lose your share of the ten
thousand livres if you shoot the woman and fail to capture the
Scarlet Pimpernel."</p>

<p>"Bah! He'll not come now," Boyer riposted. "It is too late. He
is looking after his own skin, pardi!"</p>

<p>"He will come, I swear!" Chauvelin said firmly, as if in answer
to his own thoughts.</p>

<p>Inside the room, Marguerite has heard every word of this
colloquy. Its meaning is clear enough. Clear and horrible! Death
awaits her at the hands of those abominable
ruffians&mdash;here&mdash;within half an hour&mdash;unless...Her
thoughts are becoming confused; she cannot concentrate. Frightened?
No, she is not frightened. She has looked death in the face before
now. That time in Boulogne. And there are worse things than
death...There is, for instance, the fear that she might never see
her husband again...in this life...There is only half an hour or
less than that...and...and he might not come...She prays that he
might not come. But, if he does, then what chance has he? My God,
what chance?</p>

<p>And her tortured mind conjures up visions of his courage, his
coolness, his amazing audacity and luck...She thinks and
thinks...if he does not come...and if he does...</p>

<p>A distant church clock strikes the half-hour...a short half-hour
now...</p>

<p>The evening is sultry. Another storm is threatening, and the sun
has tinged the heat-mist with red. The air smells foul, as in the
midst of a huge, perspiring crowd. And through the heat, the lull,
above the hideous sounds of those ruffians outside her door, there
is a rumbling noise as of distant, unceasing thunder. The city is
in travail.</p>

<p>Then suddenly Boyer, the Captain of the ruffians, exclaims
loudly:</p>

<p>"Let me finish with the aristo, citizen Chauvelin! I want to
join in the fun."</p>

<p>And the door of her room is torn open by a savage, violent
hand.</p>

<p>The window behind Marguerite is open, and she, facing the door,
clings with both hands to the sill. Her cheeks bloodless, her eyes
glowing, her head erect, she waits, praying with all her might for
courage...only courage.</p>

<p>The ruffianly captain, in his tattered, mud-stained uniform,
stands in the doorway&mdash;for one moment only. The next,
Chauvelin has elbowed him out of the way, and in his turn faces the
prisoner&mdash;the innocent woman whom he has pursued with such
relentless hatred. Marguerite prays with all her might, and does
not flinch. Not for one second. Death stands there before her in
the guise of this man's vengeful lust, which gleams in his pale
eyes. Death is there waiting for her, under the guise of the
ignoble soldiers in the scrubby rags, with their muskets held in
stained, filthy hands.</p>

<p>Courage&mdash;only courage! The power to die as he would wish
her to...could he but know!</p>

<p>Chauvelin speaks to her; she does not hear. There is a mighty
buzzing in her ears as of men shouting&mdash;shouting what, she
does not know, for she is still praying for courage. Chauvelin has
ceased talking. Then it must be the end. Thank God! she has had the
courage not to speak and not to flinch. Now she closes her eyes,
for there is a red mist before her and she feels that she might
fall into it&mdash;straight into that mist.</p>

<p class="cpb">6.</p>

<p>With closed eyes, Marguerite suddenly seems able to hear. She
hears shouts which come from below&mdash;quite close, and coming
nearer every moment. Shouts, and the tramp, the scurry of many
feet; and now and then that wheezing, asthmatic cough, that
strange, strange cough, and the click of wooden shoes. Then a
voice, harsh and peremptory:</p>

<p>"Citizen soldiers, your country needs you! Rebels have defied
her laws. To arms! Every man who hangs back is a deserter and a
traitor!"</p>

<p>After this, Chauvelin's sharp, dictatorial voice raised in
protest:</p>

<p>"In the name of the Republic, citizen Barras!"</p>

<p>But the other breaks in more peremptorily still:</p>

<p>"Ah, ça, citizen Chauvelin. Do you presume to stand between me
and my duty? By order of the Convention now assembled, every
soldier must report at once at his section. Are you perchance on
the side of the rebels?"</p>

<p>At this point, Marguerite opens her eyes. Through the widely
open door she sees the small, sable-clad figure of Chauvelin, his
pale face distorted with rage to which he obviously dare not give
rein; and beside him a short, stoutish man in cloth coat and cord
breeches, and with the tricolour scarf around his waist. His round
face appears crimson with choler and in his right hand he grasps a
heavy malacca stick, with a grip that proclaims the desire to
strike. The two men appear to be defying one another; and all
around them are the vague forms of the soldiers silhouetted against
a distant window, through which the crimson afternoon glow comes
peeping in on a cloud of flickering dust.</p>

<p>"Now then, citizen soldiers!" Barras resumes, and incontinently
turns his back on Chauvelin, who, white to the lips, raises a final
and menacing word of warning.</p>

<p>"I warn you, citizen Barras," he says firmly, "that by taking
these men away from their post, you place yourself in league with
the enemy of your country, and will have to answer to her for this
crime."</p>

<p>His accent is so convinced, so firm, and fraught with such dire
menace, that for one instant Barras hesitates.</p>

<p>"Eh bien!" he exclaims. "I will humour you thus far, citizen
Chauvelin. I will leave you a couple of men to wait on your
pleasure until sundown. But, after that..."</p>

<p>For a second or two there was silence. Chauvelin stands there,
with his thin lips pressed tightly together. Then Barras adds, with
a shrug of his wide shoulders:</p>

<p>"I am contravening my duty in doing even so much; and the
responsibility must rest with you, citizen Chauvelin. Allons, my
men!" he says once more; and without another glance on his
discomfited colleague, he strides down the stairs, followed by
Captain Boyer and the soldiers.</p>

<p>For a while the house is still filled with confusion and sounds:
men tramping down the stone stairs, words of command, click of
sabres and muskets, opening and slamming of doors. Then the sounds
slowly die away, out in the street in the direction of the Porte
St. Antoine. After which, there is silence.</p>

<p>Chauvelin stands in the doorway with his back to the room and to
Marguerite, his claw-like hands intertwined convulsively behind
him. The silhouette of the two remaining soldiers are still
visible; they stand silently and at attention with their muskets in
their hands. Between them and Chauvelin hovers the tall, ungainly
figure of a man, clothed in rags and covered in soot and coal-dust.
His feet are thrust into wooden shoes, his grimy hands are
stretched out each side of him; and on his left arm, just above the
wrist, there is an ugly mark like the brand seared into the flesh
of a convict.</p>

<p>Just now he looks terribly distressed with a tearing fit of
coughing. Chauvelin curtly bids him stand aside; and at the same
moment the church clock of St. Louis, close by, strikes seven.</p>

<p>"Now then, citizen soldiers!" Chauvelin commands.</p>

<p>The soldiers grasp their muskets more firmly, and Chauvelin
raises his hand. The next instant he is thrust violently back into
the room, loses his balance, and falls backward against a table,
whilst the door is slammed to between him and the soldiers. From
the other side of the door there comes the sound of a short, sharp
scuffle. Then silence.</p>

<p>Marguerite, holding her breath, hardly realized that she lived.
A second ago she was facing death; and now...</p>

<p>Chauvelin struggled painfully to his feet. With a mighty effort
and a hoarse cry of rage, he threw himself against the door. The
impetus carried him further than he intended, no doubt; for at that
same moment the door was opened, and he fell up against the massive
form of the grimy coal-heaver, whose long arms closed round him,
lifted him off the floor, and carried him like a bundle of straw to
the nearest chair.</p>

<p>"There, my dear Mr. Chambertin!" the coal-heaver said, in
exceedingly light and pleasant tones. "Let me make you quite
comfortable!"</p>

<p>Marguerite watched&mdash;dumb and fascinated&mdash;the dexterous
hands that twined the length of rope round the arms and legs of her
helpless enemy, and wound his own tricolour scarf around that
snarling mouth.</p>

<p>She scarcely dared trust her eyes and ears.</p>

<p>There was the hideous, dust-covered mudlark with bare feet
thrust into sabots, with ragged breeches and tattered shirt; there
was the cruel, mud-stained face, the purple lips, the toothless
mouth; and those huge, muscular arms, one of them branded like the
arm of a convict, the flesh still swollen with the searing of the
iron.</p>

<p>"I must indeed crave your ladyship's forgiveness. In very truth,
I am a disgusting object!"</p>

<p>Ah, there was the voice!&mdash;the dear, dear, merry voice! A
little weary perhaps, but oh! so full of laughter and of boyish
shame-facedness! To Marguerite it seemed as if God's own angels had
opened to her the gates of Paradise. She did not speak; she scarce
could move. All that she could do was to put out her arms.</p>

<p>He did not approach her, for in truth he looked a dusty object;
but he dragged his ugly cap off his head, then slowly, and keeping
his eyes fixed upon her, he put one knee to the ground.</p>

<p>"You did not doubt, m'dear, that I would come?" he asked
quaintly.</p>

<p>She shook her head. The last days were like a nightmare now; and
in truth she ought never to have been afraid.</p>

<p>"Will you ever forgive me?" he continued.</p>

<p>"Forgive? What?" she murmured.</p>

<p>"These last few days. I could not come before. You were safe for
the time being...That fiend was waiting for me..."</p>

<p>She gave a shudder and closed her eyes.</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>He laughed his gay, irresponsible laugh, and with a slender
hand, still covered with coal-dust, he pointed to the helpless figure
of Chauvelin.</p>

<p>"Look at him!" he said. "Doth he not look a picture?"</p>

<p>Marguerite ventured to look. Even at sight of her enemy bound
tightly with ropes to a chair, his own tricolour scarf wound
loosely round his mouth, she could not altogether suppress a cry of
horror.</p>

<p>"What is to become of him?"</p>

<p>He shrugged his broad shoulders.</p>

<p>"I wonder!" he said lightly.</p>

<p>Then he rose to his feet, and went on with quaint
bashfulness:</p>

<p>"I wonder," he said, "how I dare stand thus before your
ladyship!"</p>

<p>And in a moment she was in his arms, laughing, crying, covered
herself now with coal-dust and with grime.</p>

<p>"My beloved!" she exclaimed with a shudder of horror. "What you
must have gone through!"</p>

<p>He only laughed like a schoolboy who had come through some
impish adventure without much harm.</p>

<p>"Very little, I swear!" he asserted gaily. "But for thoughts of
you, I have never enjoyed anything so much as this last phase of a
glorious adventure. After our clever friend here ordered the real
Rateau to be branded, so that he might know him again wherever he
saw him, I had to bribe the veterinary who had done the deed, to do
the same thing for me. It was not difficult. For a thousand livres
the man would have branded his own mother on the nose; and I
appeared before him as a man of science, eager for an experiment.
He asked no questions. And, since then, whenever Chauvelin gazed
contentedly on my arm, I could have screamed for joy!</p>

<p>"For the love of Heaven, my lady!" he added quickly, for he felt
her soft, warm lips against his branded flesh; "don't shame me over
such a trifle! I shall always love that scar, for the exciting time
it recalls and because it happens to be the initial of your dear
name."</p>

<p>He stooped down to the ground and kissed the hem of her
gown.</p>

<p>After which he had to tell her as quickly and as briefly as he
could, all that had happened in the past few days.</p>

<p>"It was only by risking the fair Theresia's life," he said,
"that I could save your own. No other spur would have goaded
Tallien into open revolt."</p>

<p>He turned and looked down for a moment on his enemy, who lay
pinioned and helpless, with hatred and baffled revenge writ plainly
on the contorted face and pale, rolling eyes.</p>

<p>And Sir Percy Blakeney sighed, a quaint sigh of regret.</p>

<p>"I only regret one thing, my dear M. Chambertin," he said after
a while. "And that is, that you and I will never measure wits again
after this. Your damnable revolution is dead...I am glad I was
never tempted to kill you. I might have succumbed, and in very
truth robbed the guillotine of an interesting prey. Without any
doubt, they will guillotine the lot of you, my good M. Chambertin.
Robespierre to-morrow; then his friends, his sycophants, his
imitators&mdash;you amongst the rest...'Tis a pity! You have so
often amused me. Especially after you had put a brand on Rateau's
arm, and thought you would always know him after that. Think it all
out, my dear sir! Remember our happy conversation in the warehouse
down below, and my denunciation of citoyenne Cabarrus...You gazed
upon my branded arm then and were quite satisfied. My denunciation
was a false one, of course! 'Tis I who put the letters and the rags
in the beautiful Theresia's apartments. But she will bear me no
malice, I dare swear; for I shall have redeemed my promise.
To-morrow, after Robespierre's head has fallen, Tallien will be the
greatest man in France and his Theresia a virtual queen. Think it
all out, my dear Monsieur Chambertin! You have plenty of time. Some
one is sure to drift up here presently, and will free you and the
two soldiers, whom I left out on the landing. But no one will free
you from the guillotine when the time comes, unless I
myself..."</p>

<p>He did not finish; the rest of the sentence was merged in a
merry laugh.</p>

<p>"A pleasant conceit&mdash;what?" he said lightly. "I'll think on
it, I promise you!"</p>

<p class="cpb">7.</p>

<p>And the next day Paris went crazy with joy. Never had the
streets looked more gay, more crowded. The windows were filled with
spectators; the very roofs were crowded with an eager, shouting
throng.</p>

<p>The seventeen hours of agony were ended. The tyrant was a
fallen, broken man, maimed, dumb, bullied and insulted. Aye! He,
who yesterday was the Chosen of the People, the Messenger of the
Most High, now sat, or rather lay, in the tumbril, with broken jaw,
eyes closed, spirit already wandering on the shores of the Styx;
insulted, railed at, cursed&mdash;aye, cursed!&mdash;by every
woman, reviled by every child.</p>

<p>The end came at four in the afternoon, in the midst of
acclamations from a populace drunk with gladness&mdash;acclamations
which found their echo in the whole of France, and have never
ceased to re-echo to this day.</p>

<p>But of all that tumult, Marguerite and her husband heard but
little. They lay snugly concealed the whole of that day in the
quiet lodgings in the Rue de l'Anier, which Sir Percy had occupied
during these terribly anxious times. Here they were waited on by
that asthmatic reprobate Rateau and his mother, both of whom were
now rich for the rest of their days.</p>

<p>When the shades of evening gathered in over the jubilant city,
whilst the church bells were ringing and the cannons booming, a
market gardener's cart, driven by a worthy farmer and his wife,
rattled out of the Porte St. Antoine. It created no excitement, and
suspicion was far from everybody's mind. The passports appeared in
order; but even if they were not, who cared, on this day of all
days, when tyranny was crushed and men dared to be men again?</p>
