  <h2><a name="ch01"
     id="ch01">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AFTER so long a pause that Marcia felt sure whoever it was
  must have gone away, the front door bell rang again, a courteously brief
  "still waiting".</p>

  <p>It would be a neighbour child on the way home from school with a handful
  of basketball tickets. Or an agent tardily taking orders for cheap and gaudy
  Christmas cards.</p>

  <p>The trip down to the door would be laborious. Doctor Bowen had wanted her
  to avoid the stairs as much as possible from now on. But the diffident
  summons sounded very plaintive in its competition with the savage swish of
  sleet against the windows.</p>

  <p>Raising herself heavily on her elbows, Marcia tried to squeeze a prompt
  decision out of her tousled blonde head with the tips of slim fingers. The
  mirror of the vanity table ventured a comforting comment on the girlish
  cornflower fringe that Paul always said brought out the blue in her eyes. She
  pressed her palms hard on the yellow curls, debating whether to make the
  effort. In any event she would have to go down soon, for the luncheon table
  was standing exactly as they had left it, and Paul would be returning in half
  an hour.</p>

  <p>Edging clumsily to the side of the bed, she sat up, momentarily swept with
  vertigo, and fumbled with her stockinged toes for the shapeless slippers in
  which she had awkwardly paddled about through two previous campaigns in
  behalf of humanity's perpetuity. When done with them, this time, Marcia
  expected to throw the slippers away.</p>

  <p>Roberta eagerly reached up both chubby arms and bounced ecstatically at
  the approach of the outstretched hands. Wallie scrambled up out of his blocks
  and detonated an ominously sloppy sneeze. "Hanky," he requested, with husky
  solemnity.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I should say so," agreed Marcia. "Please don't tell me you've
  been taking cold again."</p>

  <p>Wallie denied the accusation with a vigorous shake of his head, whooped
  hoarsely, and began slowly pacing the intermittent clatter of their
  procession down the dingy stairway, the flat of his small hand squeaking on
  the cold rail of the ugly yellow banister.</p>

  <p>The bulky figure of a woman was silhouetted on the frosted glass panels of
  the street door. Wallie, with a wobbly index finger in his nose, halted to
  reconnoitre as they neared the bottom of the stairs, and his mother gave him
  a gentle push forward. They were in the front hall now, Marcia irresolutely
  considering whether to brave the blizzard. Wallie decided this matter by
  inquiring who it was in a penetrating treble, reinforcing his desire to know
  by twisting the knob with ineffective hands. Marcia shifted Roberta into the
  crook of her other arm and opened the door to a breath-taking swirl of
  stinging snow, the first real storm of the season.</p>

  <p>Outlandish in a shabby plush coat much too large for her&mdash;though she
  was by no means a small person&mdash;and an equally frowsy old fur hat drawn
  down over her brows, the caller displayed a large red apple from which an
  incredibly long peeling dangled. Obviously expecting her pantomime to speak
  for itself, the woman&mdash;heavy-eyed, pale&mdash;silently produced another
  inch or two of apple-skin tape projected through the slot of an ingenious
  little knife firmly clutched in a blue-chapped, shivering fist.</p>

  <p>"But I mustn't stand here in this storm," protested Marcia. "You'll have
  to step inside. And please shut the door quickly," she added over her
  shoulder as she retreated into the comparative warmth of the living-room, the
  apple-person following with Wallie reeling alongside, gazing up at her
  inquisitively.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to have bothered you," regretted the pedlar. It was a singularly
  low-pitched voice registering the last extremity of weariness, perhaps
  something of battered refinement too. The grey eyes were cloudy and seemed
  reluctant to draw a clear focus, though this might be attributed to fatigue
  rather than a calculated evasiveness.</p>

  <p>Murmuring a non-committal acceptance of the apology, Marcia eased
  Roberta's undependable feet on to the sewing-machine table and stretched out
  a hand towards the magical tool.</p>

  <p>"How much is it?"</p>

  <p>"A quarter."</p>

  <p>"I'll take one," said Marcia, glancing up to meet the grey eyes squarely
  for the first time. Then she added, "Please", with a slight inclination of
  her head which seemed to invest the trivial transaction with something like
  dignity. She was a little surprised at her suddenly altered attitude towards
  this taciturn woman with the pallid face, the puzzling eyes, and the
  impossible clothes. It had been habitual with Marcia to make short work of
  door-to-door canvassers.</p>

  <p>Politely but without effusion the pedlar produced a barely audible "Thank
  you", and began rummaging&mdash;rather ineffectually, for her hands were
  stiff with cold&mdash;in the depths of a capacious old shopping-bag bulging
  with demonstration apples, while Marcia studied the impassive face at close
  range. It appeared to mask a personality intended for and probably accustomed
  to better things than the house-to-house vending of a cheap kitchen gadget.
  Or perhaps it had a secret to conceal. The woman was a curious bundle of
  inconsistencies, the dowdy old hat and the rough hands being so shockingly
  unrelated to the disciplined voice and eyes which testified to a
  well-furnished mind.</p>

  <p>"I shall have to go upstairs for the money," said Marcia, when the
  merchandise had changed hands. "Will you watch my baby?"</p>

  <p>The cryptic eyes lifted, lighted, and a smile nervously twitched the
  corners of the drooping mouth. Muttering something about the snow on her
  coat, the woman unbuttoned the ill-fitting garment and tossed it aside. The
  uncouth hat was tugged off also, dishevelling a thick mop of well-cared-for,
  blue-black hair and releasing a crackle of electricity. Without the hat and
  coat she was only forty, perhaps a little less than that if she were entirely
  well and contented.</p>

  <p>"But I don't like to have you climb those steep stairs for me," she
  protested. "Perhaps you'd better not."</p>

  <p>"I really shouldn't," confided Marcia. Then, impulsively, "Would you mind?
  It's on my dressing-table, a brown leather purse, first door to the right at
  the head of the stairs." She slipped her hands under Roberta's arms to
  reclaim her, but the caller ignored the gesture and cuddled the baby closer
  to her abundant breast. The grey eyes searched Marcia's youthful face for a
  moment disconcertingly.</p>

  <p>"Do you think," inquired the gently reproving voice, "that you ought to
  let a stranger ramble about through your house hunting for your
  pocket-book?"</p>

  <p>Marcia flushed a little and felt very young and foolish.</p>

  <p>"It does sound reckless, when you put it that way," she admitted, adding
  with a <i>naïveté</i> that brought a puckery smile to the visitor's lips,
  "What are we going to do about it?" Then, suddenly inspired, "My husband will
  be here in a little while. Could you wait?"</p>

  <p>"Gladly," sighed the caller. "I have been on my feet all day." She sank
  into the nearest chair and softly rubbed her white chin against the top of
  Roberta's silky head.</p>

  <p>"It's chilly in here." Marcia stooped over the wood-basket and dragged the
  metal screen aside from the cold grate. "The furnace runs low at this time in
  the afternoon, and I can't do anything about it."</p>

  <p>"Let me make that fire for you. I'm bigger than you are." Again little
  Roberta was transferred and the stranger knelt before the grate.</p>

  <p>"Nobody could be bigger than I am," murmured Marcia. She sat interestedly
  surveying the slow but competent movements of her mysterious guest. The shoes
  were badly worn, but they had once been good&mdash;expensively good. Whoever
  had wanted that hat had not bought those shoes. Marcia felt that the shoes
  were authentic. So was the black crêpe frock. It was old, but it fitted. The
  fire blazed, and with much difficulty the weary woman rose to her feet,
  clutching the mantel for support. Marcia tried to keep the pity out of her
  tone when she said cordially, "Now draw up a chair close to it. You must be
  half-frozen."</p>

  <p>There was silence between them for some time, the stranger leaning forward
  with her elbows on her knees and her chin cupped in both hands, staring into
  the crackling flames. Presently she straightened, and turning towards Marcia
  asked wistfully if she might hold the baby again.</p>

  <p>Silently complying, Marcia went through the double doorway into the
  dining-room and began to clear the table. Wallie hovering close. "Mum-mee!"
  he wheedled shrilly. "Can I have a piece o' bread-n-butter-n-sugar?"</p>

  <p>Marcia led the way into the diminutive pantry. Wallie gleefully chirping
  redundant comments on his good fortune while his mother laid out the makings
  of a snack. Suddenly his improvised refrain was broken off short. At the same
  instant Marcia sensed another presence, and glancing around was startled to
  see her strange visitor standing in the passage. She had Roberta closely
  nestled in her arms. Her pale lips were parted, revealing sound white teeth
  tightly locked. The grey eyes were importunate&mdash;and ashamed.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you would like some too." Marcia tried to make the invitation
  sound half-playful, hoping to safeguard the woman's self-respect if she
  could.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;please! If you would." The deep-pitched voice was husky. "I
  haven't had anything to eat since morning and I'm not so very long out of the
  hospital."</p>

  <p>"You should have told me," chided Marcia gently. "Do help
  yourself&mdash;and there's some cold tongue in the refrigerator. I'll make
  you a cup of tea. Not much wonder you're fagged. Was it an operation?"
  Proceeding into the cold kitchen, she lighted the gas under the kettle.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," replied the half-starved woman indifferently, surrendering
  Roberta and taking up the bread-knife in a shaky hand. "Maybe they do call it
  an operation." She began eating ravenously.</p>

  <p>Shocked by the exhibition of such hunger as she had never seen so candidly
  displayed, Marcia retreated a step, fumbling at her beads with agitated
  fingers. She felt rebuffed too, for surely her solicitous query had deserved
  a better reply than this casual impertinence.</p>

  <p>"I mean," explained the woman, her articulation muffled by the food she
  was wolfing, "is it an operation when you have a baby? I know," she
  continued, between spasmodic swallowings, "that it's an operation when you
  have something unhealthy that has to be cut out of you, but having a baby is
  the most natural thing in the world, or at least it would seem so, seeing how
  long it was going on before there were any surgeons or hospitals."</p>

  <p>Indisposed to debate whether childbirth should be considered as an
  institution or an operation, but personally interested in babies as
  individuals, Marcia inquired, "What did you do with it?"</p>

  <p>"He's at the hospital. They said he could be adopted."</p>

  <p>"Have you no friends?"</p>

  <p>"No, that is&mdash;not here."</p>

  <p>"Relatives?"</p>

  <p>"Well, none wanting a baby." She turned to cut another slice of bread.</p>

  <p>"That's too bad," sympathized Marcia. "There's your tea on the kitchen
  table. Come, Wallie. You run in now and sit by the fire. Go on&mdash;quickly.
  Do as Mother tells you."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to," squeaked Wallie. "I want to watch the lady eat."</p>

  <p>Marcia was devastated with chagrin, wondering whether an apology on behalf
  of her unfortunate offspring would ease the strain, when the problem was
  solved for her by a good-natured laugh and a mumbled "I don't wonder".</p>

  <p>Unable to think of anything appropriate to say, Marcia smiled faintly and
  led her reluctant child into the living-room, where she lowered Roberta into
  the perambulator and returned to her task at the dining-table, for some
  moments mechanically moving the dishes about, wishing this awkward situation
  had not arisen. She hoped the woman would go soon. Surely she had enough to
  worry her without adding anything more. Paul would be here at any moment. He
  would go popping through the kitchen immediately on his way to the furnace.
  He would discover this famished woman and interest himself in her
  predicament. Anyone could see at a glance that she shouldn't be turned out
  into the storm. And it would be quite right and proper to ask her to stay if
  they could afford it, or had a suitable place for her. Paul would think they
  had. He was so hopelessly impractical, so heart-breakingly in debt, so
  childishly indifferent to their plight. And in a month there was to be the
  hospital and the nurses and the doctor&mdash;without the slightest vestige of
  a plan for these imperative expenses. Poor Paul. He should have married
  someone who knew how to manage... . No&mdash;she would have to see to it that
  the unhappy creature was out of the house before Paul arrived. For the moment
  Marcia quite forgot the real reason for the woman's tarrying.</p>

  <p>Resolutely she gathered up a double handful of dishes and carried them to
  the kitchen sink. The stranger promptly joined her there, turned back her
  sleeves, and began drawing hot water into the dishpan.</p>

  <p>"You'll not need to help," said Marcia crisply. "There aren't many. I can
  easily do them alone. Thanks&mdash;just the same." She tried to make the
  dismissal significant without being unkind.</p>

  <p>"Where do you keep the aprons?" inquired the woman, unimpressed by
  Marcia's rather stiff repudiation of her proffered services.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;really&mdash;" Marcia was being very firm now. "I prefer to do
  them myself."</p>

  <p>She accented every word, secretly reproaching herself for having to offend
  the grateful tramp.</p>

  <p>Pretending not to realize this sudden shift of mood, the stranger smiled
  indulgently and began washing the dishes. The food had braced her up and
  every motion testified to an amazingly prompt revival of latent energy.
  Marcia decided to make a last stand. Time was passing rapidly. On the verge
  of tearful exasperation, she said: "You have your own work to do, and I'm
  keeping you from it. I'll go and get your money for you at once. My husband
  might be delayed. And it is getting dark. I mustn't detain you."</p>

  <p>Flicking the hot suds from her hands, the woman followed as far as the
  dining-room without comment and stacked up the rest of the dishes. Marcia
  made an impatient little gesture of bafflement, her knuckles digging into her
  forehead. Weak in the knees, she slumped into a chair by the grate, hoping to
  recover her strength for the painful trip upstairs. Minutes passed. The
  energetic clatter of dishes had subsided now and now the unwelcome volunteer
  in the kitchen could be heard walking about. She was coming quietly into the
  living-room. Marcia glanced up dully, relieved to see the woman take up the
  frumpy old coat and the mangy hat and the preposterous shopping-bag from the
  chair where they had sprawled in an untidy pile.</p>

  <p>"I'm going up for the money now," said Marcia weakly. "Thank you for doing
  the dishes."</p>

  <p>"I'll be in the kitchen," replied the woman, draping her effects over her
  arm.</p>

  <p>That was ever so good, thought Marcia. The poor dear had caught the idea
  that she must go and was planning to leave by the back door to avoid a
  collision with the man of the house. Perhaps she had divined that she was
  expected to be gone when he came. Pulling herself together, Marcia dragged
  her burdensome body up the stairs and down again, wincing at every step of
  the return trip. There was a mighty stamping of snowy feet on the front porch
  as she hurried through the dining-room. Perhaps the worrying incident could
  be closed in the nick of time.</p>

  <p>At the kitchen doorway she stopped and speechlessly surveyed a dismaying
  scene. In apparent contentment, the woman was seated in the corner with a pan
  in her lap, peeling her experimental apples with one of her patent knives.
  She looked up brightly and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Pie," she explained&mdash;and then added irrelevantly, "My name is
  Hannah."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>For quite fifteen minutes Hannah had the kitchen to herself. She was much
  perplexed. The girlish blonde had been so pleasantly kind&mdash;and then had
  suddenly gone into a panic of desire to get her out of the house. That would
  be because her husband was a brute. The pretty thing was clearly frightened
  about something, and undoubtedly that was it. Hannah thoughtfully stroked her
  chin with the back of her hand and wondered what she ought to do&mdash;stay
  and help get dinner and put the disordered kitchen to rights, in payment for
  her food, or take her quarter and vanish.</p>

  <p>While she debated, half-intelligible wisps of conversation drifted through
  from the living-room where the nervous and distraught girl-wife was pouring
  out her story. Occasionally his soft voice offered a soothing comment. He
  wasn't a brute. Hannah continued to peel her apples. The situation was
  clearing up. She smiled and shook her head a little, compassionately,
  eavesdropping without compunction on the private talk, occasional phrases of
  which were becoming audible. They were stony-broke, their credit was
  exhausted, they were going to have another baby, they couldn't take on any
  more obligations&mdash;all this in the harassed voice of the lovely
  blonde&mdash;and here was this hungry person out in the kitchen peeling her
  own apples with the unquestionable expectation that her services would be
  recognized and rewarded.</p>

  <p>"But"&mdash;the man was saying reassuringly&mdash;"you need help, Marcia,
  and if she wants to do something for you, in return for your kindness, why
  not let her?"</p>

  <p>"But we can't afford it, Paul."</p>

  <p>"Why can't we? We've been in tight corners before."</p>

  <p>Now they were just going around and around, getting nowhere. The apples
  were all peeled. Having intruded this far into their family complications,
  Hannah felt that a little more impudence on her part would not be likely to
  alter her status very much, so she decided to go to the basement and do
  something about the fire before it went out, if indeed it had not already
  done so. Then, if they were agreed that she mustn't stay and help, in return
  for the food she had eaten, they could say so&mdash;and she would go. She
  sincerely hoped they would not insist on this, for it was plain to be seen
  that the young woman was almost at the end of her physical resources.</p>

  <p>The first door she tried unlatched with much difficulty, but when it did
  consent to let go it was generous enough, unexpectedly disgorging a great
  many of the larger articles which the shallow closet contained&mdash;an
  ironing-board, two brooms, a mop, and the long handle of a carpet-sweeper
  bounding violently out to assault her, attended by a covey of dust-cloths.
  The eruption caused a deal of racket and for a little while there was no
  sound of talk in the house. Then his father called Wallie to come back here,
  and Hannah coaxed the things into their lair again, all but the umbrella
  which had opened in flight and couldn't be closed without risk of a compound
  rib fracture.</p>

  <p>She tried the other door. The stairs to the basement, now that Hannah had
  located them, were pitch-dark at the top, though a feeble yellow light glowed
  from one of the rooms in the cavern below. Just inside the door there was an
  electric bulb which did not respond when she turned the button. Groping her
  way cautiously down the narrow steps she found the furnace-room by the aid of
  the almost extinct lamp which presumably had been burning all day. The coal
  supply was low, but there was plenty of everything else in the dingy room.
  Hannah vigorously shook down the ashes and clinkers, opened the draughts and
  shovelled in a small quantity of coal, thinking it indiscreet to offer the
  fire very much nourishment until it was feeling better. While she waited for
  signs of its resuscitation there was time to glance about. She shook her head
  and whispered, "Tsch, tsch".</p>

  <p>It was none of her business, of course, but there was a battered trunk
  with no lock, no hasps and one handle, a broken chair, a pile of magazines, a
  bicycle with two flat tyres and a mildewed seat, a roll of old rugs and
  strips of carpet, a three-legged card-table, a hobby-horse with one ear, one
  rocker and no tail, a tall filing-cabinet, and a serviceable but very grimy
  office desk on which reposed two high stacks of old books covered with soot,
  a pile of folded chintz draperies, a gilt clock, a half-dozen flowerpots with
  earth in them, an unstrung tennis racquet, one roller-skate, and a cracked
  cut-glass berry-bowl containing three hickory nuts, a bunch of rusty keys, a
  doorknob, a spool of white silk thread, a monogrammed belt-buckle, five
  dominoes, a box of fish-food, a tooth-brush, and a small gift copy of
  <i>Sartor Resartus.</i> Hannah threw in another shovelful of coal and
  wondered what they would be thinking overhead when they heard all the noise
  she was making.</p>

  <p>Retracing her steps upstairs, she decided to carry on with the pie.
  Pulling open the flour-bin in the kitchen cabinet, she was pleased to find it
  nearly half full. It contained also the flour-sifter, a couple of little tin
  dies for cutting cookies, a rolling-pin, and a lead pencil which must have
  got in by accident. Hoping to be equally successful in locating the other
  ingredients for the pie, Hannah went to the refrigerator, taking pains to
  avoid the sluggish stream which ambled aimlessly across the pantry floor and
  whose headwaters, she knew, had their origin in an overflowing pan beneath
  the icebox.</p>

  <p>Opening the door she found a tin bucket filled with lard. Excellent luck,
  thought Hannah. There was a plentiful supply of almost everything. The
  refrigerator was stuffed to capacity; four quart milk-bottles, all partly
  used, but one which was empty, a highly ornamental glass jar with a few
  slices of cold tongue, the skeleton of a rib roast from which most of the
  choice meat had been cut, two asparagus tips in a saucer, a few stalks of
  discouraged celery, one candied sweet potato holding forth alone in a large
  bowl with the smugness of an old settler, three half-used glasses of jelly,
  and, side by side, a pound of unwrapped butter and a slice of Roquefort
  cheese. Hannah removed the cheese.</p>

  <p>There was also a neat paper parcel. She argued with herself for a moment
  and opened it&mdash;four French lamb chops. Then she took the can of lard to
  the kitchen-cabinet where operations were resumed on behalf of the apple pie.
  She was stooping over to light the gas in the oven when masculine footsteps
  commanded her attention. The man was in his middle thirties, slender, a
  little over average height, and very good-looking.</p>

  <p>"How do you do," he said pleasantly. "Mrs Ward tells me&mdash;I am her
  husband, by the way&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I thought you might be," replied Hannah, unperturbed. "I knew she was
  expecting you."</p>

  <p>"Mrs Ward has been just a bit upset. You see&mdash;" He hesitated for an
  instant.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know," assisted Hannah companionably. "It's her condition. What
  with two little children on her hands and nobody to help her and another baby
  expected soon, she naturally would be nervous."</p>

  <p>"Of course," he agreed. "But the point is that Mrs Ward feels embarrassed
  over your remaining here to offer your services in this way. She says you
  have been earning your living by selling something and we are keeping you
  from it. We both appreciate your kindness, but&mdash;to put the matter
  frankly&mdash;Mrs Ward doesn't want you to do anything further. She feels
  that we cannot afford to have kitchen help just now."</p>

  <p>"If you don't mind, Mr Ward," rejoined Hannah, plying the rolling-pin
  energetically, "I'll keep right on with this pastry, so it won't get tough.
  Pardon me for interrupting."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;that was about all I had meant to say. We are greatly obliged
  for what you have done, and if we were able we should gladly keep you on,
  but&mdash;as I have tried to point out&mdash;we can't afford it."</p>

  <p>Hannah pinched the pie all the way around with an experienced thumb and,
  holding it on a level with her eyes, deftly trimmed the edge.</p>

  <p>"I know you can't," she said, and then added, lowering her voice
  confidentially, "and I know why."</p>

  <p>He bridled a little at that, lighted a cigarette with an impatient
  gesture, and replied, clipping his words, "At least&mdash;it's no
  responsibility of yours."</p>

  <p>"I'm not so sure about that," countered Hannah. "I got into your mess by
  accident and through no fault of mine. I was blown into your house by the
  blizzard. Your wife was very kind to me. I've been awfully knocked about
  lately, Mr Ward, and she seemed to realize it. She is a darling. And then I
  found myself out here in your kitchen&mdash;and I just can't leave her in
  this dreadful state. I should worry myself to death about her."</p>

  <p>"Dreadful state?" he echoed woodenly.</p>

  <p>Hannah pursed her lips and smiled a maternal reproof.</p>

  <p>"Don't pretend you didn't know. This hand-to-mouth way you people
  live&mdash;everything at loose ends&mdash;spending so much and getting so
  little for it." Hannah felt that she had burned most of her bridges now and
  might as well speak her mind plainly. "That sweet girl ought to be having
  good care&mdash;especially now. She shouldn't be doing her own work&mdash;and
  she's doing it the hardest way there is. I don't wonder she's discouraged and
  nervous, the way this house is run. I hope I haven't offended you, but it's
  true."</p>

  <p>He had been scowling darkly through Hannah's speech, but her last
  conciliatory remark was so genuinely sympathetic that his face cleared a
  little.</p>

  <p>"I know," he admitted, with a rueful sigh, "we aren't very good at
  it."</p>

  <p>Hannah teased him with a sisterly grin.</p>

  <p>"I'll bet you mean," she drawled, "that your wife isn't very good at it.
  Men always think that. But you left the furnace lamp on all day, I notice,
  and you've been buying kindling all tied up in cute little bundles when the
  basement is running over with loose boards and broken boxes enough to supply
  you for the winter. It isn't all her fault, I can tell you."</p>

  <p>"Did I say it was?" he grumbled.</p>

  <p>Hannah made no reply to that, being occupied at the moment by her task of
  regulating the oven. He sauntered to the door and stood there
  indecisively.</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't you like to empty that refrigerator pan while you're here?"
  asked Hannah, as if he were fifteen and she was his mother. "That's really a
  man's job, you know. It's heavy."</p>

  <p>He complied good-naturedly enough, dragging the loathsome thing out and
  slopping a great puddle of slimy water on the floor. Hannah had anticipated
  this and was already at his elbow with the mop.</p>

  <p>"Sorry," he muttered, trying to balance his burden on the way to the sink.
  "It's always full, no matter how often you empty it."</p>

  <p>"You could remedy that in half an hour if you wanted to," scoffed Hannah,
  unwrapping the expensive chops. "Bore a hole in the floor, put in a tin
  funnel, and run a piece of hose down to a big bucket in the cellar."</p>

  <p>"And then the bucket would always be running over down there."</p>

  <p>Hannah glanced up and chuckled as she replied, "Well&mdash;I don't think
  that would matter much. You aren't very particular how the cellar looks." She
  raised her eyebrows so drollishly when she added, "I was down there," that he
  laughed a little in spite of his determination to be firm with her. The sound
  of it brought Marcia to the doorway, her wide, blue eyes full of inquiry.</p>

  <p>"If it's something funny&mdash;" she began, with as much dignity as she
  could muster.</p>

  <p>"If you will set the table now, Mrs Ward," interjected Hannah, quite
  unruffled, "I'll have your dinner ready in a few minutes."</p>

  <p>Marcia turned away frankly annoyed, followed by Paul, who said, when they
  had reached the dining-room: "She isn't a bad sort, dear. Bit of a character,
  I should say. No end amusing. Why not let her help you to-night if she wants
  to? To-morrow you can tell her to go."</p>

  <p>"To-morrow? You mean she is to stay here all night?"</p>

  <p>"Why not? She doesn't seem dangerous. And there's a bed. She's probably
  clean&mdash;don't you think?" He grinned broadly. "I gather that she's almost
  as fastidious as we are, judging from some comments she made about our
  cellar."</p>

  <p>"She didn't dare!" spluttered Marcia.</p>

  <p>"Dare? You don't know our Hannah very well. She as much as
  said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That I was the worst housekeeper in the world, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"No, no, darling; nothing about you. She thinks you're wonderful."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;aren't I?" muttered Marcia derisively. "So&mdash;she's to sleep
  in the guest-room. I suppose. In that case, I'd better lay a place for her at
  the table." She began taking the silver from the buffet.</p>

  <p>Hannah, who had been significantly rattling dishes in the pantry, came in
  at this juncture with a trayful, and, noting the preparations for three
  places, inquired, "Does little Wallie eat at the table?"</p>

  <p>"In his high-chair," replied Marcia, still grim.</p>

  <p>"Then we'll not need these," said Hannah, restoring the extra silver to
  the buffet-drawer. "I shall be serving the table."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Marcia had gone early to bed after showing Hannah where she was to
  sleep&mdash;"just for to-night"&mdash;and taking pains to specify that their
  hospitality was offered because of the very bad weather. She had admitted to
  herself&mdash;and, a bit reluctantly, to Paul also&mdash;that it was a
  welcome relief to be temporarily free from kitchen drudgery. Now that her
  burdens had been eased for a few hours, she realized the weight of them.</p>

  <p>Having finished his pipe and the newspaper, and observing that a light
  still burned in the kitchen, Paul strolled out to see what Hannah was up to
  now. She had been reorganizing the contents of the refrigerator with a view
  to their consolidation. The neighbouring cupboard ledge bore evidence to the
  number and variety of articles which she seemed to consider superfluous. He
  watched her for a while in interested silence as she sat squatting on her
  heels intent on her occupation.</p>

  <p>"A refrigerator," he said at length in the declamatory tone of one
  reciting the Commandments, "is a nasty thing."</p>

  <p>Hannah looked up over her shoulder and nodded approval of this sentiment.
  "It seems to me," she said slowly, "that whoever thought up a refrigerator
  might have had brains enough to give the thing legs, so you wouldn't have to
  sit on the floor or stand on your head to see what's in it."</p>

  <p>"Funny nobody ever thought of that," ruminated Paul, reloading his
  pipe.</p>

  <p>"Pooh&mdash;I'll bet every woman has. It's plain to see that it was a man
  planned it. It's too bad women aren't able to invent things." Hannah's regret
  over the uninventiveness of her sex sounded sincere, and Paul puffed
  thoughtfully as he considered this curious biological fact. She rose with a
  wince from her tiresome posture and showed that she had something on her
  mind. "If you are at liberty for a few minutes, Mr Ward, I wish you would go
  down in the basement for me. I want to do something about that
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"I thought you were going away to-morrow," he reminded her gently.</p>

  <p>"That's why we have to decide to-night what ought to be done down
  there."</p>

  <p>He could think of no reasonable objection to this, so they descended the
  dark stairs, Hannah remarking <i>en route</i> that the electric lamp in the
  unfurnished storeroom on the second floor would be of more service than
  there, and Paul consenting, not very convincingly, that he would see to
  it.</p>

  <p>"How long has it been," she inquired, "since you used that desk?"</p>

  <p>Welcoming any distraction from the threat of an unpleasant job, Mr Ward
  scratched his head thoughtfully for the exact date while Hannah's fingers
  flexed restlessly. His averted eyes and oblique mouth predicted a
  reminiscence.</p>

  <p>"Must have been 1908. It has been idle since we came here. My uncle gave
  me the desk when I received my doctorate."</p>

  <p>"Doctor it?"</p>

  <p>"The degree, you know. Doctor of Philosophy."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;do they have to doctor philosophy? I don't know much about such
  things."</p>

  <p>He eyed her narrowly for an instant and then nodded slowly, feeling that
  the query, whether asked in playful satire or honest ignorance, could
  properly be answered in the affirmative. Then he added, "The desk is of no
  use to us. My office at the university is equipped with everything."</p>

  <p>"Is that what you do?" inquired Hannah compassionately. "You're a
  professor?"</p>

  <p>He nodded, tugging at the spluttering pipe.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I guess you know I'm sorry," she said penitently, "for talking
  to you the way I did. I was a little annoyed with you for being so helpless,
  but of course I didn't know what your business was. You'll excuse me, won't
  you?"</p>

  <p>Paul laughed heartily and said she was priceless, but Hannah remained so
  contritely straight-faced that his laughter sounded to himself as if it had
  just a trace of incipient madness in it, and he suddenly sobered, blinking
  rapidly. If this woman was ragging him, she was making a good job of it, he
  reflected. He had visions of himself reporting the incident at luncheon
  to-morrow at the University Club. Then it occurred to him that it would be an
  awkward sort of story to tell&mdash;even to Fritz Manheim or Sandy Laughton.
  They wouldn't understand.</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;you probably wouldn't miss the desk," Hannah was saying, "if you
  came down some morning and it wasn't here." And when he admitted that this
  might easily be the case, Hannah pointed to the bicycle. "Ever ride it?" she
  asked. He shook his head. "It isn't in bad condition," she observed, "if the
  tyres were mended. It's too good to sit here and rust. How about that
  filing-case?"</p>

  <p>"I'll not be using it any more&mdash;at least so far as I know."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;that's far enough," drawled Hannah, "when you're cleaning junk
  out of a cellar. I suppose it's full of old papers and letters and
  things."</p>

  <p>Paul said he shared that supposition and promised to go through it, one of
  these days, when he had a spare minute; should have done so, he confessed,
  long ago.</p>

  <p>Hannah shook her head and regarded him with one of her unanswerable grins.
  "You&mdash;and your spare minutes," she scoffed. "What's the matter with
  right now? You're not doing anything else, are you?" Then, while he was
  trying to contrive an excuse for postponement of the unpleasant job, she told
  him to go up and find a couple of good lamps. Returning, rather glumly, he
  found that she had cleared a space around the cabinet and was wiping off the
  soot.</p>

  <p>"It's just as we thought," she announced, as if the two of them were
  conspirators engaged in dealing with the disorderly clutter of a house they
  had unfortunately fallen heir to; "the thing is full. Better empty all the
  drawers into that big clothes-basket, Professor, and then you can sort out
  the stuff&mdash;and decide how much you want to keep."</p>

  <p>"I'd rather you didn't call me 'Professor'," he said testily, dumping the
  contents of the top drawer into the basket.</p>

  <p>"Sorry," murmured Hannah. "I didn't know you were sensitive about it."</p>

  <p>He had felt himself growing more and more surly over the nasty task she
  had badgered him into, but Hannah's ingenuous remark was quite too absurd to
  be received irascibly. He laughed in spite of his irritation and pursued the
  disgusting assignment without further grousing. In sober truth, these things
  should have been attended to long ago. If this odd creature wanted to help,
  why not humour her?</p>

  <p>"Better see if the desk isn't full, too," advised Hannah. "I've a notion,
  from all that's on top of it, there wasn't any room left inside.... Are those
  rugs worth keeping?... Does this lawn-mower work?... Is that garden hose any
  good?... Then what's the wheelbarrow for, if you haven't a garden? You easily
  could have a nice garden, you know."</p>

  <p>It was long after midnight when they finished classifying the basement's
  grimy hoard. The few papers which Paul thought might have some future value
  had been tied up in neat packages for temporary storage in a box Hannah had
  found in the attic. Every scrap of paper that had been rejected she had
  stowed in a big burlap bag along with the old magazines. "It won't bring very
  much," she admitted, "but it's better business to sell it than to hire
  somebody to cart it away."</p>

  <p>"You'd better go to bed now," suggested Paul wearily. "You must be very
  tired."</p>

  <p>"Bet your life I'm tired!" She rubbed back her damp, disordered hair with
  her forearm. "And I never was so dirty before."</p>

  <p>He scowled a little at that and reminded her that nobody had asked her to
  do it. "In fact," he pursued stiffly, "I can't understand why you did. You
  certainly don't owe us anything."</p>

  <p>"I owe the town something," said Hannah. "I have been a charity case in
  the University Hospital for three weeks."</p>

  <p>"That isn't owing the town," growled Paul punctiliously. "That's the
  state."</p>

  <p>"It's about the same thing. I don't even live in the state&mdash;if it
  comes to that. You are citizens and pay taxes. Perhaps I can square up a
  little if I do something for you.... I'm going to bed now. What time do you
  want your breakfast, and how do you like your eggs?"</p>

  <p>"Er&mdash;poached, please, about half-past seven; but, look here, do you
  want me to believe that you actually feel under some sort of obligation to
  the town&mdash;or the state? Almost nobody does, you know. I'm mighty sure I
  don't!"</p>

  <p>"Why not? The government of the town and the state is made up of the
  people, isn't it? I'm owing people. It's the same as any other debt, isn't
  it?" Hannah had one foot on the lower step, poised to go.</p>

  <p>"Ummm&mdash;so you're paying back your debt to the state by helping the
  Ward family out of a scrape. Suppose the Ward family doesn't want you to.
  What then?"</p>

  <p>She was thoughtful for a moment and a sudden inspiration came to the
  rescue. "But the hospital did a lot of things to me that I didn't like
  either; though I suppose it was for my good."</p>

  <p>"So, you're intending to help us whether we like it or not. Is that it?
  You're just a little bit crazy, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," confessed Hannah, mounting the stairs. "You ought to know."
  This last comment sounded saucier than she had intended, so she added
  respectfully, "&mdash;You being a professor," which still left the colloquy
  lacking a satisfactory last line. To remedy this she said "Good night" almost
  tenderly.</p>

  <p>When she was at the top he called to her in a voice full of amusement
  under heavy compression.</p>

  <p>"Hannah&mdash;would it be too much bother if you tried to sell this old
  stuff to a second-hand man? I don't know much about such business."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir&mdash;I had expected to, to-morrow. You didn't think I'd go to
  all this trouble and then not finish it, did you?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose," he reflected, "you could get more for it than I."</p>

  <p>Hannah chuckled a little, and then, suddenly deferential, replied, "Yes,
  sir. I know that."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;you may sell it for us on one condition." Paul was quite the
  man of the house, now, taking no nonsense from anybody. "You are to keep ten
  per cent for your own. That is no more than fair. If you do not want to
  handle this job on these terms, you are not to do it at all. Understand? We
  are temporarily hard pressed here, but we are not paupers."</p>

  <p>"Thanks&mdash;and may I spend the ninety per cent on the house? I'm pretty
  good at making a dollar go a long way."</p>

  <p>"I dare say you are. Do what you please with it&mdash;in consultation with
  Mrs Ward, of course."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. Don't forget to turn out the lights before you come up."</p>

  <p>Paul regarded his grimy hands with distaste and snapped off one of the
  lights. Then he turned it on again and ambled over to the empty fruit-cellar.
  For a long time he stood looking up at the raw joists under the pantry floor,
  speculating on a spot where a hole might be bored to let the seepage through
  from the icebox. What a clumsy arrangement; what an unsanitary, thoroughly
  objectionable apparatus it would be at its very best.</p>

  <p>Why did people consent to the housing of such an abomination as a
  refrigerator, anyway? He fell into a brown study then and leaned against the
  wall, disregarding its coating of soot. After a while he sat down on a dusty
  box and slowly refilled his pipe.</p>

  <p>The big packing-houses made their own ice: why shouldn't it be possible
  for private homes to have their own refrigeration plants? It might be worth
  looking into.</p>

  <p>Stiff in every joint and dirty beyond description, he went up to bed at
  two o'clock, his head whirling with a new idea. This was the best hunch he'd
  ever had. He was determined to have a go at it, anyway. If it amounted to
  nothing&mdash;well, he wouldn't be any worse off, would he?</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch02"
     id="ch02">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MARCIA roused at nine with an oppressive sense of guilt such
  as a sentry might feel when caught asleep at his post. But no one came to
  reproach her. The house was very quiet.</p>

  <p>She always depended on the children to waken her early. This morning there
  hadn't been a peep out of them. They must have been stealthily whisked away
  before they had had a chance to make a noise. That, she reflected, would be
  some more of this mysterious Hannah's doings. Hannah, for some unknown
  reason, had determined to make herself indispensable, though why she had
  decided it might be to her advantage to share their plight was a riddle that
  would take a lot of explaining.</p>

  <p>Marcia sleepily conceded that if it really was the woman's ambition to
  become so useful they couldn't part with her, she was already well on the way
  towards success. One might try valiantly to be indignant over Hannah's
  obstinate generosity, but it was a sweet relief to know that
  somebody&mdash;no matter who or why&mdash;had temporarily shouldered the
  irksome load.</p>

  <p>That the canny creature had managed to take Paul into camp was to have
  been expected. Marcia hoped Hannah would not consider this a feather in her
  cap, seeing how easily Paul could be taken in by almost anybody. Under her
  direction, doubtless&mdash;Marcia could reconstruct the self-assured tone in
  which the calm orders had been issued&mdash;Paul had slipped quietly out of
  the house to his eight-fifty class in Elizabethan Drama, after having
  breakfasted without haste or confusion. Paul would like that, nor was he the
  sort to worry over the future consequences of putting himself this much
  deeper into Hannah's debt.</p>

  <p>Marcia interlaced her fingers behind her curly head and stared wide-eyed
  at the dingy ceiling. It wasn't exactly as if Paul was insensitive to debt.
  The humiliations of it hurt him. He was always very much subdued after a
  telephone conversation in which some impatient credit manager ruthlessly
  raked him over the coals. But after a pensive half-hour he would bob up like
  a cork. Knowing he was worried and wounded, she would go to him and sit on
  the arm of his chair. And he would look up brightly smiling, rub his cheek
  fondly against her arm, and say, "Listen&mdash;I'll read you something
  funny." She wished she had the same capacity for such prompt and painless
  recovery from a raw insult. There wasn't, she reflected with a deep sigh,
  very much bounce left in her. Paul was certainly a marvel of resilience, or
  else he was a master at concealing his thoughts, and she didn't think he was
  the latter. In fact, he was almost childishly frank. You could read him like
  a book. He was transparent as glass.</p>

  <p>The oddest feature of his character was his undefeatable hope that things
  would soon be better for them. He had been nourishing himself on that faith
  ever since they were married. He had always talked about their predicament as
  if it was some sort of unforeseen emergency which ought to ease up by the
  tenth of the month at the latest. Every day since their honeymoon&mdash;on
  borrowed money, as she discovered six months later when he was savagely
  dunned for it&mdash;Paul had been counselling her to be patient and of good
  cheer. They wouldn't always be poor, no, sir-ee! Something would turn up.
  Once, ostensibly in jest but privately a little annoyed by his frequent use
  of this classic phrase, she had ventured to hint at the similarity between
  his optimism and that of Mr Wilkins Micawber. After that, he usually beat a
  hasty retreat when he found himself about to recite this article of his
  creed, but he was apt at devising the equivalents of it. Something would turn
  up. He believed that with a faith as bland as it was foolish and as dangerous
  as it was pathetic.</p>

  <p>It wasn't as if he had just sat there serenely waiting for some benevolent
  angel to hand him a cornucopia. He had tried to do something to encourage
  Fortune to consider his need, rigged a little workshop in the attic, spent
  weary hours over clumsy models laboriously whittled out with flimsy tools.
  Sometimes Marcia would go up to show her interest. He would be humped over
  the bench, intently squinting at his product as if he had now arrived at the
  strategic moment, far too absorbed to stop even to value her good wishes. He
  would smile absently and wave her away&mdash;and she would answer his smile
  as courageously as possible. Then she would tiptoe down the attic stairs and
  cry her eyes out for him. Her throat ached now at the remembrance. Some days
  he would come home from the library with an armful of books about patents and
  sit up to all hours with them. He would abandon one project for another,
  casually dismissing the task he had toiled over for weeks and bravely taking
  on a fresh one with a cheerfulness that simply broke one's heart. Marcia
  wiped her eyes with the corner of the sheet. It was a darned shame! That's
  what it was! And things were never going to be any different. Paul's salary
  would never be very much larger than it was now.</p>

  <p>Grimacing ironically at the mirror, Marcia sat at her vanity table and
  spent more than the usually allotted time with her hair. It was about the
  only thing she had left now to remind her of what she ought to look like, and
  she found comfort in concentrating her attention on it for a while, sweeping
  the brush through its spun gold almost caressingly. Paul had always been so
  proud of it.</p>

  <p>And then, because she was playing the grand lady this morning, she drew on
  the pink <i>négligé</i> that he had given her on her birthday in June. They
  hadn't been able to pay the grocery bill in full that month or any part of
  the butcher's bill, but she couldn't summon the courage to chide him. Every
  time she had worn it, Marcia had experienced an uncomfortable feeling that
  the expensive garment wasn't really hers. It probably belonged by rights to
  the butcher, because she invariably thought of him whenever she looked at it.
  This would be an appropriate occasion to put it on. The voluntary assistance
  she was receiving wasn't rightfully hers either. She knew they would have all
  that to pay for sooner or later. High-grade service like this didn't just
  fall into your lap by magic. In the long run, the most expensive way to
  acquire anything was to get it for nothing. She pinned up her yellow hair and
  went leisurely down the stairs.</p>

  <p>Wallie, with his hair wetted and sleeked back off his forehead, giving him
  a detestable smart-alecky expression, was sitting at his little table by the
  fire so industriously engaged with his crayons that he barely glanced up when
  he mumbled, "'Lo, Mummy", in preoccupied response to his mother's
  twice-repeated greeting. And how was her little boy's cold this morning?
  Marcia wondered, a query he answered promptly and fully with a resounding
  sneeze. Roberta was asleep in her perambulator on the other side of the
  grate, her thumb in her little rosebud of a mouth, as usual.</p>

  <p>As she passed through the dining-room, Marcia noted that her place at the
  table was laid. It was a strange sensation to be cared for so thoroughly,
  somewhat perplexing but undeniably enjoyable. It was too good to be true,
  certainly too good to last very long.</p>

  <p>Hannah had mounted the ironing-board on the backs of two kitchen chairs
  and was taking much pains with one of Roberta's little dresses. She smiled a
  salute.</p>

  <p>"Sorry I overslept," apologized Marcia. "Someone should have called me."
  She realized, in her unpremeditated choice of "someone", that she was still
  bracing herself against an admission of Hannah into the household.</p>

  <p>"Are you ready for your breakfast, ma'am?" asked Hannah pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"I'll get it. All I want is a cup of coffee and a piece of toast... You're
  taking more trouble than I do with Roberta's clothes."</p>

  <p>"You would if you had the time, ma'am. What a sweet baby she is!"</p>

  <p>"I wish I could make her stop sucking her thumb."</p>

  <p>"All babies do, more or less, don't they?" inquired Hannah serenely.
  "Perhaps they have some good reason for it, ma'am."</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;for instance?" Marcia wondered. The woman was so capable. She
  might have an explanation. "And I wish," added Marcia kindly enough, "you
  wouldn't tag all your remarks to me with 'ma'am'. I'm not accustomed to it.
  If you're going to do my ironing without wages, I don't care to be cast for
  the part of the duchess."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, ma'am," stammered Hannah. "As for Roberta's thumb, it has been
  so long since I was a baby that I've forgotten. But I think that Nature knows
  what she's up to, most of the time."</p>

  <p>"I wonder," doubted Marcia. "I see Wallie's cold is no better. I must
  telephone Doctor Bowen to come and look at him."</p>

  <p>Hannah peeled Roberta's fluffy white dress off the ironing-board and
  patted it down smoothly in a fresh place.</p>

  <p>"Didn't he ever have a cold before?" she asked casually.</p>

  <p>"Dozens! One right after another. Spring, summer, fall, and winter. He has
  been known to have two or three at the same time."</p>

  <p>"You always have the doctor?" inquired Hannah, amused.</p>

  <p>"Of course! A cold is dangerous if you let it run on. You can't depend
  much on your wise old Mother Nature."</p>

  <p>"What does the doctor prescribe?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, he doesn't usually give Wallie any medicine; tells me to keep him
  warm and see that he has plenty of liquids."</p>

  <p>"Well, can't we do that?" asked Hannah placidly. "Not much use hiring the
  doctor to come here and say it over again. That four dollars would go a long
  way towards a ton of coal, if we're to keep the child warm. We are about out,
  you know."</p>

  <p>It was an odd thing, thought Marcia, what shocking impertinencies this
  woman could commit without leaving you the slightest loophole for a suitable
  retort. And it was always done with a disarming smile that made it difficult
  for you to become indignant.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Marcia, subdued, "I must order some coal this morning." Her
  face was perplexed. She wondered whether their coal-dealer would consent to
  send out any more until they had paid something on their old bill. Paul had
  said he would talk to him about it. It would be unpleasant. He always
  postponed such humiliations as long as possible.</p>

  <p>"You needn't worry about Wallie. He will be all right. I gave him a big
  dose of castor oil awhile ago." Hannah's calm report replied that any thought
  about sending for the doctor could now be prudently dropped.</p>

  <p>"Did you have much trouble getting him to take it?" asked Marcia, pouring
  her coffee. "He does hate it so terribly."</p>

  <p>Hannah smiled reminiscently and admitted that there had been "quite a
  struggle". Marcia knitted her brows and pictured the little fellow frightened
  and overpowered by this domineering creature who seemed bent on having her
  own way with all of them. "But I wouldn't give much," Hannah went on, "for a
  child who would take castor oil without some sort of fight. I'd expect him to
  wind up in a house for the feeble-minded."</p>

  <p>"I hope you didn't have to be rough with him," said Marcia. "He's very
  sensitive. Did you hold his hands? Did he cry?"</p>

  <p>For some time Hannah was much occupied with her ironing and the tardiness
  of her reply brought a deepening expression of concern into Marcia's
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"No," she said at length, "he didn't cry and I didn't have to hold his
  hands. When I saw how much he objected to the nasty stuff, I stood him up
  here on the table and talked to him about you. I told him how sweet you were
  to him&mdash;and to everybody&mdash;and how you were so very tired that we
  mustn't make a noise, and if he didn't get over his cold you would have to
  sit up at night with him when you were sick yourself and ought to be in
  bed&mdash;and a lot more things like that." There was a long pause. "And
  so"&mdash;Hannah's voice lowered&mdash;"he took it."</p>

  <p>Marcia's eyes grew misty.</p>

  <p>"I didn't see him take it," continued Hannah, bending over her task. "I
  put a big spoonful in orange juice and set the glass down on the table, and I
  said, 'There it is, Wallie. Hannah's not going to make you take it&mdash;and
  Hannah's not even going to watch you do it.'" The iron kept on making deft
  little jabs into the ruffles, Hannah's eyes intent on her work. "And then I
  left him alone, and pretty soon I came back&mdash;and he had taken it."</p>

  <p>"And what would you have done if he hadn't?" inquired Marcia, frankly
  stirred by the report of her son's bravery.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;I would have started all over again, I suppose, and promised to
  bake him some animal cookies, or some such bribe as that. I'm glad I didn't
  have to. It's so&mdash;so glorious, don't you think, when you find they've
  good, sound stuff in them?"</p>

  <p>Marcia's pride shone in her eyes. She was quiet for a moment and then
  remarked, with a little perplexity, "But you just said a child was probably
  feeble-minded who would consent to take castor oil without a struggle. I hope
  you don't think Wallie is."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I didn't make myself clear, Mrs Ward. I told you there was a
  battle. Wallie put up a big fight, no doubt about that, but it was on the
  inside, where all fights ought to take place.... No"&mdash;she went on, half
  in soliloquy&mdash;"Wallie gave himself a dose of something more important
  than castor oil. He's a very stout little fellow."</p>

  <p>"And now you're going to make him the cookies," said Marcia
  childishly.</p>

  <p>"Not to-day," confided Hannah. "It's ever so much better if he can learn
  to fight battles without promises of pay." She tipped the iron up on its
  stern, and with one plump bare arm akimbo, proceeded to elucidate her theory.
  "That's what ails so many people, Mrs Ward. When they were little tots they
  took their castor oil because somebody was going to make animal cookies for
  them. And then, later on, every time they do something fine and big and
  nobody comes running up the next minute with animal cookies, they go into
  tantrums and say, 'I say! What's the good taking nasty medicine if there
  aren't any animal cookies?'"... Hannah took up the iron again. "No&mdash;we
  mustn't spoil this lad if we can help it. He's a thoroughbred, you know. And
  they take a lot of handling."</p>

  <p>"You're funny," observed Marcia, rather surprised to find that she had
  made the thought audible.</p>

  <p>"So they tell me," admitted Hannah, "but"&mdash;she hung Roberta's dress
  on the drying-rack and reached into the basket for another tiny
  garment&mdash;"but, anyway, Wallie got his castor oil, and that's the main
  thing." She hesitated, as if waiting for some rejoinder, and added, "Isn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Marcia thoughtfully, "I don't think that's the main thing at
  all. And neither do you. I agree about the importance of playing the game
  without bribes. I know I've been peevish, plenty of times, because I wasn't
  paid off promptly for some little voluntary hardship."</p>

  <p>"You do pretty well, Mrs Ward&mdash;if I may say so."</p>

  <p>Marcia flushed a little and was annoyed at the very considerable pleasure
  she was experiencing in having been commended by her new maid. She knew she
  had no business being affected, one way or the other, by Hannah's opinions.
  It was impertinent of the woman to offer comments of this kind. Nevertheless,
  it was comforting. And on what grounds could Marcia Ward predict any
  snobbishness?</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Hannah," she said gratefully. "You have been very kind to us.
  I can't quite understand it. Just why?"</p>

  <p>Hannah ironed diligently for some time, and then replied as from a
  distance, "You took me in, Mrs Ward, when I was a&mdash;when you didn't know
  me, or really want me."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I didn't do it very graciously. Certainly nothing I have done
  for you entitles me to any&mdash;any animal cookies." They both laughed a
  little, and Marcia was rather glad now that she hadn't told Paul about
  Hannah's baby. At least she had been able to do that much for her: she had
  kept her secret. She wondered if it might not ease Hannah's mind to know
  that. Rather childishly she ventured upon the topic while it was fresh in her
  mind. "By the way&mdash;I've been meaning to tell you that I haven't said
  anything to Mr Ward about your baby."</p>

  <p>Hannah plied her iron industriously for a while and then inquired without
  looking up, "Why didn't you?"</p>

  <p>Marcia was slightly nettled. She declared to herself that she had never
  met anyone who could so utterly destroy a conversation and leave you sitting
  with the wreck of it in your hands&mdash;and no place to put it. She had a
  notion to say "Because I feared it might embarrass you to know that Mr Ward
  knew." But this would imply that Hannah really ought to be embarrassed, no
  matter who did or didn't know about the baby. After sparring mentally with
  several tentative replies, and finding something the matter with all of them,
  she said feebly, "I just didn't&mdash;that's all." And left the room.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>After luncheon&mdash;Paul did not come home on Tuesdays&mdash;Hannah came
  upstairs to say that Mr Ward had given her permission to dispose of some old
  furniture in the basement. She had telephoned to a second-hand dealer who
  would be there about three.</p>

  <p>"I'm going down now to give the desk and the filing-cabinet a good
  polishing before the man comes. That's where I'll be if you want
  anything."</p>

  <p>"Seems to me you're putting yourself to unnecessary bother," said Marcia.
  "The man will know what the furniture is worth, even if it is a little
  dusty."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;that's the trouble. If the furniture is dusty, the man will
  know what it's worth <i>to us</i> and he'll offer a price to fit. But if it's
  clean and looks as if we thought something of it ourselves, the offer will be
  several dollars more."</p>

  <p>"Hannah," said Marcia, laughing, "I certainly shouldn't want to do any
  bargaining with you."</p>

  <p>"I was just coming to that, Mrs Ward. How would you like to let me
  stay&mdash;at least until the baby arrives and you are well again? You need
  me, and I like it here."</p>

  <p>"I wish we could, Hannah. You've been such a help. But&mdash;as I told
  you&mdash;we haven't the money. How do you suppose it would make us
  feel&mdash;having you work for us without wages? No, we shouldn't consider it
  for a minute."</p>

  <p>"But if I figured some way," persisted Hannah, "so that you could pay me
  wages without spending any more money, would you let me stay? How much do you
  think it costs you a month for food?"</p>

  <p>Marcia gave herself to some mental calculation and surmised that it might
  be about sixty-five dollars. "Or seventy, at the outside," she added
  prudently.</p>

  <p>"If you let me have sixty dollars, I'll run the table and pay myself fair
  wages.... And I'll guarantee that we shall all have plenty to eat too."</p>

  <p>"It's a bargain," declared Marcia. "I hope you can do it. I'm sure I
  shouldn't be able to."</p>

  <p>An hour later there was a considerable stir in the basement, sound of
  voices, Hannah's and a man's. After much animated parley there was the
  screech and bump of furniture being dragged about. Marcia went to the window
  and watched a truck taking the load.</p>

  <p>Hannah came up now attired in her ridiculous street outfit. "We did pretty
  well, Mrs Ward. Thirty-nine dollars. I'm going down to the market if you can
  spare me for a while."</p>

  <p>"But can't you use the telephone and save yourself a trip? It's snowing
  again."</p>

  <p>"My kind of shopping can't be done on the telephone, Mrs Ward. I arranged
  for some coal to be here in a couple of hours. I asked this man where he
  bought his coal, and he said there was a car in the railroad yards. People
  who are willing to go down there and shovel it out&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hannah! Don't tell me you're going to do that!" Marcia sat up in bed,
  wide-eyed.</p>

  <p>"Of course not." Hannah laughed heartily, almost girlishly, abandoning her
  reserve for an instant. Then, remembering the considerable difference in
  their status, she sobered and went on: "If people shovel it out and haul it
  away themselves, it's about half-price. I told him to bring us two tons. We
  pay him well for the trucking. I guess we'll save enough on that coal to
  cover about all I'm likely to spend to-day at the market."</p>

  <p>At five, Hannah came back staggering under the weight of a large basket.
  Marcia, full of curiosity, went to the kitchen, found her sitting there
  panting, and reproached her for carrying such a load.</p>

  <p>"It was only a block from the street-car," defended Hannah. "There were
  some good bargains to-day. I didn't want to let them go. I ordered enough at
  one place to have it delivered free&mdash;parsnips, potatoes, apples, and
  such things. There's a good storage-room in the cellar. I'll have some sand
  hauled in to keep the roots in fine condition."</p>

  <p>"What on earth, Hannah!" Marcia lifted the paper cover and looked into the
  basket.</p>

  <p>"It's a hog's head. It cost seventy cents. A lot of meat on it. Very
  tasty, too, if you know how to make it up. There's almost everything in a
  hog's head&mdash;lard, sausage, mincemeat, scrapple&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Marcia's serious interest in this recital was so amusing to Hannah that
  she added a few more by-products, "Chops, bacon, ham."</p>

  <p>"And eggs, I dare say," assisted Marcia. "But what are we going to do with
  all this canned corn?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you like corn?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but here is a whole dozen&mdash;and a dozen tomatoes!"</p>

  <p>"Well," drawled Hannah, "we shan't try to eat it all up to-day. It will be
  nice to have a few things on hand. These tomatoes cost eighty-four cents;
  exactly the same tomatoes that you buy on the telephone for a dollar-forty,
  except the label isn't quite so fancy. And there isn't much you can do with a
  lovely tin-can but pay a man to haul it away.... I think you'll be satisfied
  with the food I'm going to give you, Mrs Ward. There won't be any French
  chops with pink panties and a little bite of meat about the size of a
  peppermint lozenge, for we can't afford that, but we'll have things that
  stick to the ribs. Next week I'm going to buy a breast of mutton and let you
  see what can be done with another cheap cut."</p>

  <p>Marcia helped to put away the supply on the pantry shelves, finding
  herself quite enthusiastic over the prospect of these substantial
  economies.</p>

  <p>"This will relieve my husband," she confided impulsively. "I know he
  worries&mdash;though he doesn't talk much about it."</p>

  <p>"It isn't any of my business, Mrs Ward," ventured Hannah, encouraged by
  this unpremeditated remark, "but what does your husband make up in that room
  in the attic? I saw a lot of tools and funny bottles when I was up there
  hunting for a basket. There's a little lathe, too."</p>

  <p>"That's his workshop. He can't go up there in cold weather. It's a pity,
  too," regretted Marcia, "for it is the only recreation he has."</p>

  <p>"Well, all he needs is a half-dozen two-by-fours and some beaver-board to
  make a partition, and a small oil-stove. He could be snug and warm. But
  what's he trying to do? Little pieces of furniture, maybe?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;it's an invention&mdash;or something," said Marcia vaguely. "He
  hasn't really worked at it for a long time. Perhaps he has given it up. I
  haven't heard him say&mdash;not for weeks."</p>

  <p>Hannah began preparations for dinner.</p>

  <p>"Maybe we can get him at it again," she suggested. "Maybe he has got
  something. You never can tell. But&mdash;I wouldn't have thought Mr Ward was
  mechanical. He seems so sort o' helpless, and gentle. But then"&mdash;she
  repeated, half to herself&mdash;"you never can tell."</p>

  <p>Marcia said she presumed that was true and left to look after the
  children.</p>

  <p>"It isn't something that's going to make perpetual motion, is it?" called
  Hannah.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Marcia. "I don't understand it, but I know it isn't that....
  Something in chemistry, more likely."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Hannah, in a tone of relief, "that's good news, anyway. We
  couldn't afford to buy him a stove if he had anything like perpetual motion
  up his sleeve."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Paul was in gay spirits at dinner. Marcia could not remember when he had
  been so unaccountably incandescent, certainly not for a year or more, and
  strongly hinted that she would be glad to rejoice with him if she knew what
  it was about. He seemed to be hugging a secret. It was not an unprecedented
  mood. Usually, as Christmas or her birthday approached, he slyly made
  pretence of torturing her curiosity with suppressed tidings of great joy, a
  boyish whimsy she tried to play up to with protestations that it wasn't fair,
  but privately alarmed for fear some preposterous extravagance, indulged in
  for her delight, would bring down on their hapless house a dismaying epidemic
  of bill-collectors representing the merchants whose monthly statements lay in
  her desk with a rubber band around them and a lot of menace in them.</p>

  <p>And so often&mdash;how she despised herself for thinking this, but, my
  Sainted Uncle! wasn't it true?&mdash;the extravagant gifts were things
  utterly unusable. The fitted over-night bag, a-sparkle with silver-plated
  trinkets: how long had it been since she had had occasion to carry an
  over-night bag! The electric egg-boiler on a Sheffield tray! The
  morocco-cased traveller's clock! And the black velvet evening wrap with cheap
  white fur fuzzing. She had actually laughed at that: an evening wrap. She
  hadn't had an evening gown since her wedding. She pictured herself at a
  party, doffing her new black velvet coat and letting her hostess see what she
  had on under it. She laughed, and cried, after she had told Paul it was
  exactly what she had been wanting. Surely whatever old fellow it was had
  written in the Bible, "Love beareth and endureth all things", must have had a
  pretty good head&mdash;for a prophet.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Paul would have to go back to the university to-night. Dean
  Oliver had been ill&mdash;Marcia knew this was true&mdash;and had been
  farming out his schedule of student interviews among the members of the
  staff. Not that Paul resented it. Indeed, he had found it rather pleasant to
  sit in the dean's chair for a couple of hours and play he was God for a
  procession of shame-faced athletes who had been a bit nonchalant in their
  attitude towards the <i>Faerie Queen</i> or had thought erroneously, when
  they had registered for it, that Anglo-Saxon was "a pipe". But he would be
  back as soon as possible, and they would play a few games of Russian bank if
  Marcia was still up.</p>

  <p>He had warmly felicitated Hannah on her successful merchandising, making
  no reservations in the sincere appreciation he felt. Fearing perhaps that he
  had not shown this plainly enough, he sauntered out to the kitchen and said,
  generously but just a bit condescendingly: "It pleases us very much, Hannah,
  that you have decided to stay here. I hope we may make it worth your
  while&mdash;if not immediately, some day before too long." His eyes were
  dreamily averted as he added, rather mysteriously, "We might not always be so
  hard up."</p>

  <p>Hannah, who was now eating her own dinner on the porcelain table, looked
  him over appraisingly. Yes, that was it, all right: he was inventing
  something, poor devil. And spending the money already, no doubt. Giving her
  some of it. Probably arranging an annuity for her comfort in her old age.</p>

  <p>Marcia, unfastening Wallie's bib and helping him down, involuntarily
  closed her eyes for a moment, as in prayer, and wished he wouldn't. This
  Hannah, who could see you through a stone wall and count the buttons on your
  coat, would probably grin when she had a chance. Really&mdash;you had to love
  someone very much indeed to put up with this sort of thing. Hannah could
  hardly be expected to view it sympathetically. For a moment, Marcia wished
  this woman had never come to look in on their grown-up playhouse; that's what
  it was.</p>

  <p>Hannah smiled, rather grimly, and went on eating her dinner, listening,
  but taking stock of him as he stood there, his feet a little too wide apart
  for a professor. Excellent fellow&mdash;she liked him. But this was no time
  for him to be counting his chickens. Or hinting at what he was about to catch
  a pailful of at the end of a rainbow. And she didn't quite relish this air of
  benevolence with which he was filling her hands with the earnings of his
  dreams. She honestly hated to do it, but it would be good for him to get
  himself back on the ground again.</p>

  <p>"How soon do you have to go?" she asked irrelevantly, in her throaty
  contralto.</p>

  <p>He pursed his lips, dragged out his watch, studied it for a moment out of
  the tail of his eye, and said it would be almost half an hour.</p>

  <p>"If you'll go upstairs and take off those trousers," she said, in the tone
  of sixty talking to six, "I'll press 'em for you. They look sort o' jumpy, if
  you know what I mean. We've got to keep up appearances, you know," she added,
  with one of her unanswerable smiles.</p>

  <p>He stood for a moment, uncertain whether to be offended or grateful; then
  slowly turned and started on his errand. As he passed through the
  living-room, Marcia glanced up inquisitively, sensitive to a sudden change in
  his mood.</p>

  <p>"Must you?" she asked gently.</p>

  <p>"Not for a few minutes. She's going to press my pants." Hoping to give the
  episode a touch of drollery to save himself from abject abasement, he
  whispered behind his hand, "She says they're jumpy&mdash;if you know what I
  mean."</p>

  <p>Marcia was tempted to laugh, but, divining the humiliation under his not
  very effective mask of clownishness, a wave of loyalty and compassion
  suddenly sobered her.</p>

  <p>"Hannah had no business to say that to you."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;it's true, isn't it?" he growled, with a reluctant grin. "They
  haven't been pressed for weeks. Hannah's impudent as the devil, I grant you,
  but she's right about the pants."</p>

  <p>He tossed the baggy trousers over the banister and Marcia carried them to
  the kitchen where Hannah was ready with the ironing-board. In a few minutes
  they were on him again, and he was leaving with his old grey felt hat set at
  a jaunty angle, his self-assurance entirely recovered. Hannah was clearing
  the table.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Hannah," he called jovially. "I'll do as much or you some
  time." Then he kissed Marcia with more ardour than was customary at the hall
  door and left boyishly whistling.</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly he was man&oelig;uvring himself into a grand state of
  expectation with a bitter disappointment waiting to smite the lustre out of
  his eyes, but it was difficult to resist the contagion of enthusiasm. Marcia
  returned to her needlework with a lighter heart than she had carried for
  months. After all&mdash;wasn't it better, she asked herself, to tarry for an
  hour occasionally in a Fool's Paradise, and pretend to enjoy it, than dwell
  perpetually in the more rational Valley of Baghdad which seemed to be their
  manifest destiny?</p>

  <p>When the children had been put to bed, Marcia strolled out to the kitchen
  where Hannah was busy with the hog's head. It was interesting to watch her.
  Apparently she knew exactly what use was to be made of every particle: very
  competent, no matter what she endeavoured to do. Never before had Marcia felt
  quite so helpless and inexperienced as in the presence of this resourceful
  woman. It annoyed her a little, and it annoyed her even more to realize that
  she had permitted it to annoy her. She had fully realized her own
  incompetency in dealing with the problems of home management, but it had
  never been so startlingly called to her attention. It wasn't simply that she
  didn't know how to buy economically, didn't know how to utilize food
  efficiently when it was sent to her, didn't know how to organize her time:
  she was not resourceful. That was the one word that told the whole story.
  Hannah knew how to convert worthless cellar junk into money, she knew how to
  get coal at half-price, she knew how to press trousers so they'd look like
  new, she could fabricate three dollars' worth of meat from a seventy-cent
  hog's head. Marcia admired, her, envied her, respected her&mdash;and disliked
  her for being so capable.</p>

  <p>And yet, in all honesty, she reflected, Hannah really hadn't put on a show
  of superior knowledge. She had been deferential enough. But the fact remained
  that she&mdash;Marcia Wallace Ward, A.B.&mdash;fell very far short of being
  as capable as this enigma that had drifted in from God knew where.</p>

  <p>"What's your other name, Hannah?" she inquired, after several minutes of
  silence between them. "I don't remember your telling us."</p>

  <p>"My family's name is Parmalee."</p>

  <p>"They don't live in this part of the country?"</p>

  <p>"No.... Some people like the brains, too. Shall I prepare some for
  breakfast?"</p>

  <p>Marcia said she should do as she pleased. They could try it, anyway,
  though somehow it didn't sound very good. Hannah agreed to this, adding that
  if they didn't like it, she would fry some sausage.</p>

  <p>"Mr Ward will probably like the brains," speculated Marcia.</p>

  <p>"I expect so," said Hannah. "Men are always able to eat things like that.
  I think they just do it to show they're brave."</p>

  <p>"That sounds a little as if you might be a man-hater, Hannah," ventured
  Marcia, with a chuckle to prove it was said in play.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing wrong about bravery," declared Hannah dryly. "Everybody
  wants to be. Trouble with the average man is he doesn't get much chance to
  show his muscle, living in the city and working at a desk. That's what makes
  'em have tough spells at home and roar, 'Who the hell's hid my pipe?' And his
  wife feels hurt. Doesn't realize that he's just out trotting his manliness
  around to see if it's still working. I think it's a pretty good thing to feed
  a man brains, once in a while, and say, 'I really don't see how you can do
  it!' while he's eating. And kidneys, too. He should be fed kidneys and feet
  and tails and snouts and garter-snakes and praise&mdash;heaping spoonfuls of
  praise!"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," said Marcia thoughtfully, wondering whether Hannah wasn't
  trying to give her a little indirect advice on how to manage a husband. "I
  try to practise that, though perhaps I'm not very good at it. I think we all
  do better if we're encouraged."</p>

  <p>Hannah agreed to this so heartily that Marcia wished the supple-minded
  woman might find something in her worth a word of commendation. As she
  mentally called the roll of the brief conflicts of opinion they had had, one
  little episode invited debate.</p>

  <p>"Hannah," she said reminiscently, "when you didn't want me to climb the
  stairs yesterday, I asked you to go up and get my purse, and you thought me
  very foolish. But&mdash;wouldn't you have done that yourself under the same
  circumstances?"</p>

  <p>Hannah hacked hard with the cleaver and resumed her skilful operations
  with the butcher-knife. "Yes," she said at length, "I would have&mdash;but
  that's a different matter."</p>

  <p>"You mean it would have been all right for you to do it, but not for me?"
  Marcia's grin was slightly derisive. "I think that's an odd thing for you to
  say."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't have said it," admitted Hannah, "though I meant no offence,
  ma'am."</p>

  <p>"Just what did you mean, then?" Marcia challenged stiffly.</p>

  <p>"I meant," explained Hannah, quite undisturbed, "that you would have done
  it without stopping to think it over&mdash;just on impulse, you
  know&mdash;and it might have turned out badly&mdash;and then you would have
  had nothing to show for it."</p>

  <p>"On impulse!" echoed Marcia. "Well&mdash;how would you have done it, if
  not impulsively? Or perhaps it's a fixed habit with <i>you</i> to let people
  take advantage of you."</p>

  <p>Hannah nodded her head demurely. "I'm afraid I do," she confessed, "but I
  wouldn't recommend the habit&mdash;that is, not generally. It costs more than
  most people would care to pay."</p>

  <p>Marcia moved towards the door, making no effort to conceal the fact that
  she was considerably ruffled. It was insufferable to be treated like a child.
  And anyway&mdash;what the woman had been saying was stuff and nonsense. She
  paused in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"Now, look here, Hannah&mdash;" Marcia didactically laid down a slim index
  finger in the exact centre of her other palm. "Let's get this straight. You
  said that if I allowed a stranger to go to my room for my purse, I would be
  doing it on impulse; and that if the stranger imposed on me, I would have
  nothing to show for it. Granted. I think that's correct. Well&mdash;suppose
  that you, who, it seems, do this sort of thing by habit and according to a
  programme, should allow a stranger the same privilege and she imposed on you,
  what would you have to show for it?&mdash;I'd like to know."</p>

  <p>Hannah seemed so intent on her occupation for a while that there was no
  opportunity to talk. Presently she sat down with the large wooden bowl in her
  lap and began cutting up the meat into very small pieces. Glancing up at
  Marcia, still waiting, she gave her a tender little smile.</p>

  <p>"Sorry I brought it up," she said quietly. "I'm afraid I can't explain it
  very well. If I told you everything I believe, you might think I was out of
  my mind."</p>

  <p>She had spoken so gently and seriously that Marcia forgot her
  indignation.</p>

  <p>"I think," she ventured, "that I understand you now. You trust everyone.
  Isn't that it? Once in a while you are disappointed and defrauded, but you
  can afford to take the loss because&mdash;because it usually turns out all
  right, and balances up. Isn't that it?"</p>

  <p>"Not quite. Not at all, in fact. No&mdash;that isn't it. When you trust
  somebody and he lets you down, <i>you've something to show for that, too.</i>
  I don't understand it myself, Mrs Ward, and it sounds very silly, but it's
  true."</p>

  <p>Marcia felt she had had about all of this that was good for her. She
  nodded briefly, non-committally. Hannah might interpret it to be a mildly
  indifferent assent either to the truth or silliness of what she had been
  saying. Patting a yawn, she said she would go to bed now, and proceeded to
  the living-room, where she sat for some time looking into the fire. Then she
  went back to the kitchen. Hannah smiled inquiringly. Marcia searched her
  uplifted grey eyes.</p>

  <p>"Try to tell me, Hannah. Maybe I'm not as dumb as I look. If you had sent
  me for your purse, and I had bolted out of the house with it, you wouldn't
  have tried to catch me, because&mdash;you'd have had something to show for
  your trustfulness. How do you mean? <i>What would you have had?"</i></p>

  <p>"More strength," replied Hannah determinedly.</p>

  <p>"It sounds a little like some kind of religion," Marcia observed, "but if
  it was, you would probably be trying to bully me into believing it, whether I
  wanted to or not; so&mdash;it must be something else. And you won't tell me
  what you get out of it?" Marcia was more than a little annoyed. "I don't
  suppose it would work for anyone as dull as I am, anyhow. So it would hardly
  be worth while telling me."</p>

  <p>Hannah continued at her work with downcast eyes.</p>

  <p>"I'm not good enough, perhaps," goaded Marcia.</p>

  <p>Hannah looked up, smiled, sighed, and bent again over her task.</p>

  <p>"Sorry," muttered Marcia. "I had no business to say that."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;I don't mind," said Hannah tranquilly. "Once I would have said
  the same thing. I told you I couldn't make you see it. That's true. It's not
  because you're too dumb to understand. It's because I'm too dumb to explain.
  All that I know about it is this: if you find that you're related to
  people&mdash;all kinds of people&mdash;so closely that if you make war on
  them you're fighting yourself&mdash;and if you don't trust them you're not
  trusting yourself&mdash;there's a strange power that begins to give you more
  than you had lost by being defrauded, now and then. If you walk quietly and
  trustfully&mdash;you have something to show for it."</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;satisfaction; spiritual satisfaction; that sort of thing?"
  Marcia's little flick of the fingers dismissed the whole business. "That's
  old stuff. They used to sing about it in Sunday School&mdash;when I was only
  so high."</p>

  <p>"Not by a jugful they didn't!" protested Hannah, so swiftly and sternly
  that the denial made Marcia blink in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Nobody sings about <i>this,</i> I can tell you! This thing I'm talking
  about isn't easy to do. It's not baby-play. If you want to find out whether
  it's something you can set to a Sunday-school tune, <i>you just try it!</i>
  Make some experiments with it!" Hannah put the wooden mixing-bowl on the
  table and stood erect, her grey eyes lighted with an animation that held
  Marcia rigidly at attention. "You make a resolution that when people revile
  you, and persecute you, and defraud you, you'll simply smile back and take it
  on the chin&mdash;and make that the fixed rule of your life&mdash;and refuse
  to quarrel or fight, no matter what they do to you&mdash;and you'll soon
  discover that you've tackled something with more teeth in it than a
  Sunday-school ditty?" She sat down again, took the bowl between her knees,
  rather abashed over the very long speech she had made.</p>

  <p>"Why, Hannah!" Marcia's voice was half-frightened. "Who'd ever have
  thought you could get stirred up like that."</p>

  <p>"I didn't mean to, ma'am, I don't&mdash;very often. You see&mdash;it has
  cost me a lot, and I didn't like to see it mixed up with something that
  people sleep over on Sunday mornings."</p>

  <p>"Do you think I ought to try it?" asked Marcia childishly.</p>

  <p>There was a long silence.</p>

  <p>"That would be for you to decide. If you want to know anything more about
  it than I've told you, you may have to discover it for yourself." Hannah
  paused so long that Marcia, thinking the strange talk ended, turned away.
  "But&mdash;when you do discover it," finished Hannah impressively, "something
  will happen to you that you're not looking for, I can tell you that much....
  <i>And you'll be surprised!"</i></p>

  <p>"I don't think I understand," murmured Marcia, mystified.</p>

  <p>"How many senses have you?" asked Hannah, in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Five&mdash;I've always believed," answered Marcia, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;you make an honest trial of this thing we've been talking
  about," said Hannah meaningly, "and you'll have six."</p>

  <p>"What a funny thing to say!"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;isn't it?... And when you get it&mdash;the sixth one&mdash;and
  I can promise you it won't be an easy thing to do&mdash;you'll
  be"&mdash;Hannah waited and groped, with questing eyes, for the right word,
  and failing to find it, she lamely fell back on what she had said
  before&mdash;<i>"you'll be surprised!"</i></p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch03"
     id="ch03">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was the hottest summer anybody could recall. In the
  country the corn parched in its husks, the wheat curled up and gladly died.
  Little was left stirring in the whole Mid-West but raucous political clamour
  and an unprecedented pest of grasshoppers.</p>

  <p>The only comfortable place in the house was the basement. Marcia had said
  she wished she, too, could think of something important to do down there, and
  Paul had absently replied that there was plenty to be done, all right, if she
  had anything constructive to suggest. But he had not specified the nature of
  his dilemma or confided the objective of his relentless labour. Had the Wards
  been penniless they might have contrived to borrow enough money to rent a
  cottage at some near-by lake, as they had always done in the days of their
  heart-breaking insolvency. Now that they were for the first time in their
  married life (thanks to Hannah) out of the wood financially, it seemed
  imprudent to incur this unnecessary expense.</p>

  <p>Their other reason for remaining in town during the summer vacation was
  Paul's intense application to his new project. He was inventing something
  again&mdash;something that was under construction in the basement, where he
  toiled for the greater part of every day with a zeal at once amazing and
  pathetic, for it was absurd to hope that a professor of English Literature
  could accomplish very much with a plumber's wrench. Even he, serious as he
  was over it, had ventured a little joke about the novelty of converting the
  lamp of learning into an acetylene torch.</p>

  <p>Paul Ward had matured perceptibly in the past six months. It was a new and
  comforting sensation to be free of bill-collectors. The nervous flicker of
  the parasitical smile that had ineffectually draped his chagrin and
  foreboding was no longer in evidence. And when he had occasion to answer the
  telephone, you would have thought him another person than the
  half-frightened, half-furtive apologizer and time-beggar who had abased
  himself before the raw impudence of brassy whippersnappers in the credit
  departments of the stores and the utilities.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes&mdash;well&mdash;I'll be taking care of that on the tenth of the
  month," he had been accustomed to saying, deferentially.</p>

  <p>"Tenth of <i>what</i> month? That's what we want to know. And let me tell
  you sumpin more!&mdash;" And then the surly dunner would tell him "sumpin
  more", while the sensitive, tortured fellow ground his teeth in helpless
  humiliation. That was all over now and Paul was showing the effects of his
  emancipation.</p>

  <p>Whatever satisfaction Hannah had experienced in her successful management
  of the household's business affairs, her greatest happiness was derived from
  the splendid flowering of Paul's disencumbered personality. Of course she
  enjoyed watching the beautiful Marcia's achievement of radiance and poise,
  but the more spectacular change had occurred in the spirit of Paul. Hannah
  had grown to like him with an honest affection so disarmingly forthright in
  its protectiveness that Marcia, observing it, was moved rather to gratitude
  than jealousy. It delighted Hannah to see the gradual straightening of Paul's
  broad shoulders which gave him the effect of added height, the new pick-up to
  his words that had disposed of the old indecisive drawl. She had been amused
  a little, too, over his boyish glee in discovering how much more value there
  was in the same old dollar, now that his credit had been restored.</p>

  <p>"We are always two months behind in our rent," she had said in March.
  "This time you can pay up one of them. First of May we will take up the
  other. Then we are going to ask Mr Chalmers for fresh wallpaper in the
  bedroom, repairs on the front steps, and a complete overhauling of the
  furnace."</p>

  <p>When, in May, they were on an even keel, Mr Chalmers came in breezily one
  afternoon to have them go through the usual formalities of renewing their
  lease. Hannah was invited to participate in the interview. We need some
  repairs, she said. The front steps were falling down. The upstairs rooms
  required new paper. The furnace was wasteful and must have a heavier fire-pot
  and new grates. But Mr Chalmers drew a long face. He was barely paying his
  way on this property. If he made these repairs, he would have to increase the
  rent.</p>

  <p>"But," said Hannah, "aren't you making a pretty good thing out of this
  investment? At least twelve per cent, I should say."</p>

  <p>Mr Chalmers was amazed. He even chuckled a little over the utter
  ludicrousness of Hannah's remark. The property was worth thirteen thousand
  dollars! And there were the frightful taxes!</p>

  <p>"You people who rent don't realize," spluttered Mr Chalmers.</p>

  <p>"Let's be calm, please," said Hannah gently. "I looked it all up in the
  tax reports. This house is assessed at fifty-eight hundred dollars. I know
  what taxes you pay." Having serenely dropped this bomb, she excused herself
  and returned to the kitchen. Paul following her shortly after.</p>

  <p>"Hannah," he whispered, with a childish concern that made her laugh, "what
  did you run away for?"</p>

  <p>"I thought we'd better let that soak in for a minute or two before we rub
  on any more. It's a pretty tough hide, but we don't want to raise a blister.
  You go back and tell him we're moving on the last day of August."</p>

  <p>"But suppose he consents to the improvements."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;even at that, let's tell him there's no hurry about renewing.
  And if he says he has another family anxious to take it&mdash;which is, of
  course, the first thing he will think of to use as a club&mdash;you tell him
  to go ahead and let the other people have it."</p>

  <p>"But what if he should let someone else take the house? We can't move now,
  Hannah. I've some very important experiments to do here." He lowered his
  voice impressively. "You don't know just how important it is."</p>

  <p>"That's true, I don't. I've often wondered. Maybe you have, too. This will
  be a good way to find out. If it happens that we are to stay, we can be
  encouraged to hope that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If I were that superstitious, I'd&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Hannah shook her head.</p>

  <p>"It isn't superstition. It's just trying the thing a little to see how
  much it weighs. If it's too flimsy to stand a simple test like this, maybe
  you'd better not spend any more time on it. You go back and tell Mr Chalmers
  we're moving out."</p>

  <p>Paul hesitated, then a light came into his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Hannah," he said solemnly, "you have forgotten your pet theory. We
  mustn't argue, or quarrel, or haggle, or go to battle with
  anyone&mdash;including, of course, Mr Chalmers."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;we're not fighting, in this case. We're just retreating."</p>

  <p>Paul returned to the living-room where Mr Chalmers had the new lease
  spread out on the table.</p>

  <p>"Right there, Professor." Mr Chalmers handed him the pen. "And I'll be
  running along."</p>

  <p>"We're not renewing the lease, Mr Chalmers. You can't afford to make the
  improvements, and we can't afford a higher rent. So&mdash;we will be moving,
  end of August."</p>

  <p>Mr Chalmers was astounded, wounded, admonitory. They would have trouble
  finding another place. Houses were scarce. It was always expensive to move.
  But Professor Ward gently mumbled that this would be their own look-out.</p>

  <p>"Now, see here," entreated Mr Chalmers, "let's go over this matter again.
  I certainly don't want you fine people to be put to a lot of inconvenience.
  Just what is it that you've got to have?"</p>

  <p>"I'll call Hannah," said Paul, somewhat to Mr Chalmers' dismay.</p>

  <p>The lease was signed half an hour later. Hannah had suggested that the
  specifications for improvements should be drawn up and signed too; the front
  steps, the furnace, the wallpaper, a new porcelain sink, repair of the
  hot-water machine, kalsomining in the kitchen, and new screens upstairs.</p>

  <p>"But I see no reason for a signed statement," objected Mr Chalmers. "I
  keep my word."</p>

  <p>"So do we," said Hannah, "but you wanted us to sign your lease."</p>

  <p>Mr Chalmers boisterously disdained the thought that he wasn't trusting
  them. "Just a formal matter," he declared with a gesture that made a very
  small thing of it. "Simply for purposes of&mdash;of record." But he complied
  with Hannah's wish for a memorandum of all he was to do for them. At the
  front door he tarried, and, jerking a fat thumb over his shoulder towards the
  general direction of the disappearing Hannah, he growled, "Who is that
  lady?"</p>

  <p>Paul grinned amiably and replied, "That's Hannah."</p>

  <p>"Relative?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;the maid."</p>

  <p>"Do you let your maid attend to your business?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Does it fairly well, don't you think?"</p>

  <p>"I'll say," muttered Mr Chalmers. "She's a-wasting herself doin'
  housework."</p>

  <p>They both chuckled a little, and Paul went back to his work, pausing in
  the kitchen to say, "You got more out of that chap than you had planned on,
  didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Hannah. "If you don't raise your voice and holler or put on a
  big bluster, but just sit tight and wait, you usually come out on top of the
  heap. If you simply refuse to fight, you get what's coming to you, maybe not
  right away, but in time. Once in a while it's hard to do, but you'll find it
  pays. Here we were refused the wallpaper and the new steps and the furnace,
  and we admitted we were licked. After that we got it all handed to us, plus
  the hot-water thing, the kitchen paint, the screens, and the new sink. The
  sink I really hadn't counted on, Mr Ward," she confided. "I shouldn't have
  been much disappointed if that hadn't come through."</p>

  <p>"But, Hannah," accused Paul, with mock piety, "you always trust everyone,
  and you made poor Mr Chalmers sign a paper. How could you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;<i>that!"</i> She busied herself for a moment with the bread she
  was kneading, rolling it furiously. "Well&mdash;you see, we had caught Mr
  Chalmers cheating, and it wouldn't be a bit kind to him to encourage him to
  do it again."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I see that," laughed Paul. "You just wanted to protect him against
  doing himself a bad turn."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," agreed Hannah, diving again into her dough&mdash;"something
  like that... and we really did need the new sink," she added, half to
  herself, as if she might be entertaining some lingering misgivings on the
  subject.</p>

  <p>"I'll do as you say hereafter," promised Paul, amused by her frustration.
  "You're always right&mdash;really, you are."</p>

  <p>She straightened, with both fists deep in the dough, and facing him
  squarely, said, "I ought to make you sign a paper too. 'Hannah is always
  right.'" Her lips were significantly tight, after she had delivered this
  challenge, though there was a companionable twinkle in her eyes.</p>

  <p>He knew what she meant. They had had several brisk arguments recently.
  About the rug, for instance. It had suddenly occurred to him that the
  living-room rug was shabby. Without consulting Marcia's taste or Hannah's
  budget, he had dropped in at a department store and bought an atrociously
  ugly magenta rug.</p>

  <p>"If you don't mind my saying so," Hannah had remarked, "you'd be a happier
  man if you didn't have these buying spells. That rug! First one you saw, I
  expect. You should have had Mrs Ward along."</p>

  <p>"I'll not buy anything more, Hannah," he had promised. But he did. It
  wasn't a week before he had appeared in a new grey suit, despite Hannah's
  injunctions that there mustn't be any further spending that month.</p>

  <p>Privately Hannah forgave him for getting the new clothes. They had set
  back his clock five years. There was also a new red tie and a grey felt hat.
  He was stunning. So was the bill.</p>

  <p>Hannah didn't want to scold, but they were such an improvident pair. Mrs
  Ward never bought anything for herself, but she was for ever making
  suggestions for unnecessary expenditure on the table.</p>

  <p>"Hannah"&mdash;a typical remark&mdash;"we've had breast of lamb three
  times in the past two weeks. I'm afraid Mr Ward will tire of it."</p>

  <p>"Sorry," said Hannah. I'll have a pot roast to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"How about a steak?"</p>

  <p>"We'll have to wait, Mrs Ward, until we get squared away. We're running a
  little behind, this month."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>"Look, Daddy, what a man gave me!" shouted Wallie, from half-way down the
  stairs. "And Hannah says I mustn't wear it. Can't I, Daddy? Why can't I?"</p>

  <p>Paul reluctantly tugged his eyes away from the mechanism he was working
  on, and said absently, "What y' got there? Oh&mdash;you're a Bull Moose, are
  you?"</p>

  <p>Wallie set the gaudy little cap at a rakish angle and hopped up and down,
  shouting gleefully, "I'm a Bulmus! I'm a Bulmus!"</p>

  <p>"You're worse than that. You're a pest. Run along now and play."</p>

  <p>"But Hannah says I mustn't wear it."</p>

  <p>"Then do as Hannah says."</p>

  <p>The lad went sniffling up the stairs and for some minutes could be heard
  shrilly badgering Hannah. Then the racket subsided, indicating that some sort
  of agreement had been arrived at. The incident really amounted to nothing,
  but it excited Paul's curiosity to the extent that he presently found himself
  wanting a drink of water. National politics had never given him much concern,
  but he had to admit to himself that this was a bit different. There was a
  good deal of the sporting in it.</p>

  <p>"Hannah," he said, setting down the empty glass on the table where she was
  at work, "I gather you're not a Bull Mooser."</p>

  <p>"Just between us, Mr Ward," she said in an undertone, "I think I am. But
  we're university, you know, and the large majority of the regents are
  standpatters. I've been reading that in the papers."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;we've got a right to our private opinions, haven't we?"</p>

  <p>"So long as they're private, yes. You can go to the ballot-box in November
  and do whatever you like. But when your little boy romps up and down the
  street with a campaign cap on, there's nothing very private about that, is
  there?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you believe in a man's having the courage of his convictions?"
  asked Paul, making elaborate pretence of moral indignation.</p>

  <p>"If you have any&mdash;yes. But isn't this just a brawl among rival
  cliques? We may as well keep out of it, don't you think?"</p>

  <p>"But, Hannah!" protested Paul, "you believe in good government?"</p>

  <p>"Quite so. But you can't make me believe that anything good can come of
  organizations that scream at the people and call each other bad names and try
  to drown out every calm word with a big noise. They're all doing that, which
  means that they're all wrong. If any one of them was right, it wouldn't have
  to be done that way."</p>

  <p>Paul seated himself astride a chair and lighted a cigarette, squinting
  against the smoke.</p>

  <p>"You're so nearly always right, Hannah, that I don't like to leave you in
  this deplorable condition. Suppose a group of people who actually knew their
  theories of government were right and just, and disliked racket, were to sit
  with folded hands and permit the noise-makers to run the country anyhow they
  pleased, would you say that was very patriotic?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;if you ask <i>me,</i> Mr Ward, I think that word 'patriotic'
  has had a pretty rough time of it. Perhaps you know exactly what it means. I
  don't. But I do know this: whenever you hear a great lot of noise&mdash;bands
  playing, rockets shooting, and fat men yelling through megaphones, you want
  to look out, for they're trying to put something over on you. I claim that
  anybody who really <i>is</i> right and honest can live his whole lifetime
  without ever raising his voice above the tone of ordinary conversation. When
  the Truth begins to screech and whack the desk with its fist, it always makes
  me think of Little Red Ridinghood's long-eared grandmother."</p>

  <p>"You may be all wrong this time, Hannah, but you're consistent. I'll say
  that for you. You're always for non-resistance."</p>

  <p>She knew he was teasing her, but ignored his spoofing and carried on as if
  their talk was wholly serious. "I don't like that word," she said
  thoughtfully. "Maybe that's what ails this idea&mdash;just the dull title the
  people have for it. You can't blame them much. Nobody should be expected to
  take much interest in a kind of power whose name begins with 'Non'."</p>

  <p>Paul took a turn up and down the little kitchen before replying. "No
  matter what you call it, Hannah, the name won't help it. It's a dreadfully
  silly theory. It might seem to work once in a blue moon, but you'd soon be
  utterly crushed out if you tried to apply it as a principle in business or
  politics."</p>

  <p>She parted her lips to answer, but Paul raised a hand and went
  on&mdash;quite seriously now.</p>

  <p>"I know, I know&mdash;you have a visionary notion that the meek are going
  to inherit the earth. It's a pretty thought, especially for the people who
  haven't very much, like you and me. And perhaps it will all come to pass
  sometime, but not now; somewhere, but not here. It isn't practical."</p>

  <p>Hannah grinned slyly.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I'm impractical, Mr Ward. Or, if I am, someone else had
  better accuse me of it besides you. Fancy <i>you</i> calling <i>me</i>
  impractical!" They both laughed. It wasn't often that Hannah let herself go
  in this manner. Customarily her remarks to Paul were phrased in terms of the
  respect due him as her superior. Occasionally they waived the conventions, by
  common consent, and indulged in some man-to-man talk. Paul quite liked
  it.</p>

  <p>"And I'm not the sort that sees visions, either," continued Hannah. "I
  don't take any stock in such things. But I believe that after all the big
  noises are over, and the pushers and slappers and pounders have mauled one
  another to a pulp, the meek will inherit the&mdash;whatever is left to
  inherit. But if this idea of waiting in quietness and hope until the things
  we really ought to have are put into our hands"&mdash;there was a momentary
  pause during which her grey eyes widened and travelled past him as she tried
  to attach words to her thoughts&mdash;"if this idea really has the sort of
  stuff in it to make it win in the long run, I believe it must have enough
  soundness in it to work pretty well <i>now</i> for the people who think it's
  true. My own experiments with it don't amount to much, because I have so
  little to lose if it doesn't work for me."</p>

  <p>"Say that last again, Hannah. I didn't get it."</p>

  <p>"I mean&mdash;if I had a million, and somebody tried to take it away from
  me, and I gave in rather than fight, it's natural that I should have more to
  show for it&mdash;if this thing works at all&mdash;than I should if someone
  had stolen my umbrella or my pocket-book which has about nine dollars in
  it."</p>

  <p>"Hannah&mdash;that's the biggest lot of nonsense I ever saw heaped up in
  one pile."</p>

  <p>"I think most men would feel that way about it," she admitted. "It's
  harder for men to let go of things&mdash;property, money. Men think of
  themselves as successful if they have lots of <i>things.</i> Women are always
  thinking of success as something that makes them admired and liked as
  <i>persons.</i> That's natural. You watch two small children playing at
  make-believe. Along comes a stylish woman on a thoroughbred horse. The boys
  say, 'That's <i>mine!'</i>&mdash;meaning the horse; but his little sister
  says, 'That's <i>me!'</i>&mdash;meaning the lady. And as long as they live,
  he is always saying 'Mine!' and she is saying 'Me!' It isn't much wonder if
  more women than men catch this idea&mdash;this idea about&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"About personality being more important than property?" suggested Paul,
  when she seemed to be mired.</p>

  <p>"I guess so." Hannah's brows contracted studiously while the blueberries
  she was cleaning ran for a moment uninspected through her fingers. "I don't
  know that I ever thought about it just that way. But women are always
  tinkering with their faces, trying to make themselves over into something
  more beautiful, because it's a woman's self, after all, that she sets the
  most store by. A man doesn't try to prettify himself very much, or make
  himself over to look different. He wants to be important for owning something
  rather than being something.... I'm afraid I'm not saying this very well....
  But, seeing that's the way we're made, it must be pretty hard for a man to
  let go his grip on things. I've often wondered if farmers didn't hate to bury
  their good corn and wheat in the dirt when it was always a gamble how much
  they'd get back."</p>

  <p>"Yes"&mdash;broke in Paul&mdash;"but that is quite a different matter from
  letting someone make off with your property because you haven't courage
  enough to press your rightful claim to it. This soft theory that invites a
  second slap in the face, and hands over its overcoat to the extortioner who
  has already taken one's coat&mdash;it's really too silly to be talked about
  seriously by rational people. I'm rather surprised that you do it, Hannah.
  You're so sensible on most matters."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Hannah dryly. "To be crazy on only one subject isn't such a
  bad score.... But I object to your saying that the people who hold to this
  idea haven't any courage. If you ever try it out, you'll find that it's
  something the nervous and easily scared had better keep away from. It calls
  for a kind of reckless bravery that isn't necessary in a fight. When you
  fight there's a lot of excitement, and even if you're getting the worst of
  it, you at least can be hitting back. They say a pestered worm will do that.
  But just to sit still and take it, believing that if you do you will come out
  of the mess better off than if you had fought&mdash;well, that isn't easy to
  do. If you want to make fun of it because it's foolhardy, I shan't contradict
  you. But if you say it's cowardly, then I'm afraid you don't understand....
  But you'd better let me make this cake.... How's your new toy coming along
  to-day?"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;not too badly," sighed Paul, stretching his long arms to full
  torsion. "But I fear that the thing&mdash;even if it does what I want it to
  do, which isn't any too sure&mdash;is going to make a terrible noise."</p>

  <p>"Can't you box it up so the racket will all stay in the basement?"</p>

  <p>"That's what I'm trying to do. I say"&mdash;he added, with a perplexed
  scowl&mdash;"what makes you think I expect to operate this machine in the
  basement? That's just my workshop, you know. Because the weather's hot."</p>

  <p>Hannah nodded, winked rather disquietingly, resumed her dignity, and
  remarked, "Well, be that as it may, I think you've got a good idea there, Mr
  Ward."</p>

  <p>It was the first time she had expressed herself seriously about his
  mysterious job in the cellar. He paused, <i>en route</i> to the door, and
  said, "You mean that?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I do," replied Hannah confidentially. "I believe you're going
  to put it over. I've thought so all along."</p>

  <p>Paul strolled back to the table, his eyes bright with interest in her
  comment.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you say so?" he demanded almost crossly. "It would have
  helped."</p>

  <p>"Partly because it was none of my business," retorted Hannah archly, "but
  mostly because I thought you'd work better if nobody else messed into it with
  an opinion."</p>

  <p>"Then why are you telling me now?"</p>

  <p>"Because my opinions are no good. You just said that the biggest idea I
  have is too silly to talk about. So&mdash;I can say almost anything now
  without upsetting you."</p>

  <p>"Now you <i>are</i> being silly," reproved Paul. "Hannah&mdash;if you're
  right about this little invention of mine, and it succeeds, I'm going
  to&mdash;to&mdash;" He paused to contrive something important enough to be
  worth a promise.</p>

  <p>"You'll then believe me right about the other idea: was that what you were
  trying to say? Well&mdash;I can tell you this much: it will be a whole lot
  easier for you to invent that new refrigerator&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What's that?" Paul's voice was a guttural growl as he barged into her
  words. "How did you know that's what I'm trying to make?"</p>

  <p>Hannah touched the tips of her fingers to her puckered lips, and
  whispered, "I won't tell anybody."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I'll be damned!" he muttered.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't count very much on that if I were you," commented Hannah
  judicially. "The Devil's pretty busy, from all reports, and it isn't likely
  he has time to make that big a fuss over everybody. But&mdash;as I was
  saying&mdash;it will be much easier for you to make
  this&mdash;<i>P-s-s-t!</i>&mdash;this thing you are making than to understand
  that it takes more courage to wait and hope for your wishes to come true when
  almost everybody else is getting what he wants by clawing it out of other
  people's hands.... Now if you want any blueberry cake, you'd better get out
  of my way."</p>

  <p>At the door he flung back at her boyishly, "Hannah, you're a peach!"</p>

  <p>"And a nut," she snapped. "I guess I must be living a double life."</p>

  <p>Regularly every other Thursday, rain or shine, Hannah left immediately
  after the breakfast work was finished and did not return until late in the
  evening. This had been her custom for months, beginning about the time Marcia
  was up and resuming her usual activities after the arrival of little
  Sally.</p>

  <p>They had made no secret of what Hannah had meant to them during Marcia's
  absence in the hospital and the longer period of her convalescence at home.
  Hannah had been everything&mdash;cook, nurse, housekeeper, treasurer,
  purchasing agent, attorney, anchor, propeller, and pilot, all rolled into
  one. Indeed, it was through those days that she quietly assumed the complete
  management of the Ward family's affairs, handling them with such ease and
  skill that they were quite content to permit it. Sometimes they explained
  again to each other how they had happened to lean so heavily on Hannah,
  implying that if it hadn't been for Marcia's six weeks off duty they would
  never have come to rely on their maid for advice about everything.</p>

  <p>It never occurred to the Wards to question the woman's right to keep her
  own counsel in regard to the use she made of these bi-weekly days off, but
  there was no denying the curiosity they felt. Marcia had ingenuously opened
  the way for any confidence Hannah might wish to extend, several times
  elaborately setting up conversational machinery well adapted to this purpose,
  devices which the intended victim examined with an exasperating leisureliness
  before turning away. Sometimes, after Hannah had quietly nibbled all the bait
  off a particularly attractive lure and drifted nonchalantly out of reach,
  Marcia found herself wondering whether the canny creature might not have
  laughed about it a little in private. It wasn't always easy to tell, from the
  expression on Hannah's face, whether she was serious or spoofing.</p>

  <p>On the third occasion of her late arrival home after having been gone
  since early morning, they were still up and reading in the living-room as she
  passed through.</p>

  <p>"Did you have a pleasant day?" asked Marcia, brightly expectant. And Paul
  had lowered his book as if to say he would be glad to hear all about it.</p>

  <p>Hannah had smiled, nodded graciously enough, and said, "Thanks, Mrs
  Ward.... We will be having buckwheat cakes in the morning."</p>

  <p>After that, Marcia quite gave up hinting. It was simply taken for granted
  that the inexplicable Hannah, who had discouraged all inquiries about her
  past and this particular feature of her present, would disappear on alternate
  Thursdays as completely as if the earth had swallowed her up.</p>

  <p>She permitted herself no extravagances&mdash;had nothing to be extravagant
  with, indeed&mdash;but when spring came Hannah had found a very becoming
  little hat and had made a light coat on Marcia's machine. They were surprised
  to see how pretty she was in her new outfit, in striking contrast to her
  pathetic dowdiness in the old plush coat and the frighteningly ugly hat of
  the winter. There was something very attractive about Hannah. She was shapely
  and carried herself with a confident air. The casual passer-by wouldn't have
  picked her for the role in which she was cast. It would be natural enough if,
  on these unexplained excursions, she met some man friend. Marcia often
  wondered if this were not so, out of her imagination fabricating long stories
  which never had a very happy ending, for they couldn't spare Hannah now, even
  to serve the interests of a delayed romance.</p>

  <p>Once, when a kitchen conversation had drifted into the vicinity of
  matrimony in general, Marcia had said, half playfully, but alert to the
  effect of it, "You'll be married yourself, some day, Hannah"&mdash;which
  earned the non-committal rejoinder, "Think so, Mrs Ward?"&mdash;after which
  the talk suddenly veered off in another direction.</p>

  <p>The fact was that Hannah, in that brief pause before replying, had
  impulsively considered saying, "What makes you think I haven't been married?"
  But that would inevitably have demanded the telling of her story. There was
  nothing discreditable about it, but it was painful to remember. And Hannah
  was not in the market for pity. Sometimes she entertained misgivings over her
  own calm indifference to Marcia's friendly curiosity. Perhaps, if an occasion
  had invited it, she might have been able to tell Paul. He would have said,
  "That's tough, Hannah"&mdash;after which he would appear to have forgotten
  all about it. But Marcia would be bringing it up and wishing something might
  be done about it.</p>

  <p>So&mdash;Hannah's days off remained a mystery, and after a few months all
  inquisitiveness on the subject subsided. If she didn't want to tell them
  where she went, surely it was her right to keep her affairs a secret.</p>

  <p>Only once had there been any variation of her routine. Late one Thursday
  night in August she had called up to say it would be difficult for her to
  return until Sunday. She offered no explanations either then or afterwards.
  On Sunday night, Paul decided, rather impulsively, to take the ten-forty that
  night for Chicago and spend the next day in the refrigeration department at
  Armour's.</p>

  <p>When the train thundered in, screeching to an impatient stop, Paul walked
  past the day coaches towards his Pullman. Among the disembarking passengers
  he recognized Hannah. It was quite plain that she had been crying, for her
  eyes were red and swollen. It was dismaying, almost frightening, to see the
  well-poised Hannah in this state. She seemed on the point of hurrying away,
  though their eyes had met. Apparently thinking better of it, she paused,
  nodded, and tried a not very successful smile.</p>

  <p>"Why, Hannah!" he exclaimed. "You've been out of town?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir." She made a valiant effort to steady her voice.</p>

  <p>He studied her face anxiously for an instant and she averted her swimming
  eyes. Impetuously taking her arm, he said, "Hannah&mdash;is there anything I
  can do?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head, gratefully pressed her fingers against the hand he had
  laid on her arm, and murmured, "Thank you, Mr Ward."</p>

  <p>"B-o-a-r-d!" shouted a trainman.</p>

  <p>"I'm awfully sorry, Hannah."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir&mdash;I know. Good night, Mr Ward."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch04"
     id="ch04">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MARCIA experienced no disappointment and expressed no
  surprise when Paul bluntly announced, late one Sunday night in November, that
  he was now definitely done with mechanical inventions; that he would never
  again&mdash;so help him&mdash;fritter away precious time trying to do
  something for which he had neither training nor talent; that he wasn't cut
  out for any such business and had been a blithering idiot ever to have
  thought he was.</p>

  <p>Having long since arrived at this conclusion herself, Marcia drew a
  discreetly inaudible sigh of satisfaction and privately hoped her husband
  might remain faithful to this resolve, though her relief was disturbingly
  conditioned by the mounting threat that Paul already bore in his bonnet the
  larva for another bee which might turn out to be as time-destroying and
  unproductive as any of its futile predecessors. The signs were unmistakable.
  During his hours at home he was restless, remotely inattentive, moody, sure
  symptoms that the embryonic idea&mdash;whatever it was&mdash;had passed
  through most of its metamorphoses and could be counted upon to begin buzzing
  at almost any time now.</p>

  <p>It was clear that the decision he had just declared was in response both
  to a push and a pull. As for the push, he had made no substantial progress on
  his affair in the basement for quite two months, in spite of the fact that he
  had doggedly continued to spend his days there almost to the very moment of
  the university's re-opening in mid-September.</p>

  <p>His zeal had gradually ebbed as the momentum previously generated by his
  ecstatic hope declined through the successive stages of a katabasis which had
  reduced it from the stratosphere of hysterical hallelujahs to the more modest
  level of sanguine expectations, after which it had stepped down through a
  period of mere wistful hankering to fretful day-dreams featuring the prospect
  of some accidental discovery&mdash;popping up out of nowhere&mdash;to reward
  his patient toil. But no miraculous discovery had popped. No amiable angel
  had suggested a gas at once non-inflammable and non-poisonous which might be
  used in the compressor, and no fairy's wand had pointed to an airtight joint
  between a stationary and a moving part in the machine that now lay neglected
  on his work-bench.</p>

  <p>As for the pull, a distraction had arrived in the form of an unexpected
  invitation to read a paper at the first monthly round-up of the University
  Club. It pleased Paul to have been thus honoured. Seeing he was chiefly
  concerned vocationally with the life and works of the late (or early, rather)
  Edmund Spenser&mdash;for had he not won his doctorate at Columbia with a
  thesis on <i>The Shepheardes Calendar?</i>&mdash;it was natural that he
  should turn to his authentic trade for the makings of this important
  speech.</p>

  <p>The assignment to display one's wit and wisdom before the bored and
  brittle membership of the University Club was always taken very seriously,
  not only by the younger fry on the faculty who hoped to win the favourable
  attention of their critical overlords, but by these grizzled oldsters
  themselves who, though they were practically guaranteed a glutton's helping
  of applause because of their influential seniority, nevertheless considered
  these exacting occasions worth an extra effort and prepared for them with a
  cleverness and cunning out of all proportion to their activities in the
  class-room where it was considered unprofessional to be interesting.</p>

  <p>Indeed, this sentiment which exalted the dignity of dullness was so
  generally accepted that any sparkling pedagogue whose lectures proved
  entertaining enough to require the migration of his classes to a more
  spacious hall was covertly referred to as "a boundah". On all other words
  containing <i>r,</i> the faculty&mdash;mostly Western-tongued&mdash;bore down
  on this guttural with the savagery of a bulldog disturbed at his dinner, but
  when any one of them classified an ambitious colleague whose happy <i>bons
  mots</i> had won acclaim on the campus, it was customary to call him "a
  boundah", probably out of respect for the word's more frequent British usage.
  And it was to ensure against being reviled with the unpleasant designation
  which lacked an <i>r</i> that many a professor, who might have enjoyed the
  exercise of an adroit and piquant wit, abstained from it in his class-room as
  he avoided oysters in months similarly distinguished.</p>

  <p>This inhibition made it all the more imperative that when a faculty man
  was invited to speak before his peers at the University Club, where he was at
  liberty to let himself go in the indulgence of button-popping persiflage, he
  must take pains to do a good job. It was just as important for him to be
  funny on such occasions as to be unfunny while engaged in quenching the
  undergraduate thirst for knowledge. Well-to-do alumni, booked as sacrificial
  victims to the endowment fund or the projected stadium, were sometimes asked
  to attend these functions; and, recalling with what glassy eyes and distended
  throats they had swallowed one prodigious yawn after another while lounging
  in their chairs utterly stupefied by the apathetic mumble of these learned
  men, were now amazed that so much effulgence could be radiated from stars
  commonly supposed by them to be extinct.</p>

  <p>Sensitive to the peculiar nature of his task, Paul had turned to the
  composition of his essay with a concentration that had driven what was left
  of his hope for the home manufacture of ice into an eclipse not only total,
  but probably permanent. He enjoyed banter and relished repartee, but it had
  not previously occurred to him in digging up the bones of Spenser that he
  might strike a mine of merriment. It was a new and stimulating sensation.
  Night after night he sat at Marcia's desk in the living-room, chuckling over
  neatly tipped-up phrases which, he felt, should be good for a genial haw-haw.
  Occasionally he broke forth into open laughter at some delicious bit which
  might even evoke an appreciative hear-hear! He imagined he heard the eminent
  satirist Wembel condescending to say, after adjournment, "That was jolly
  good, Ward. You'll be doing a book on Spenser, some time. Put me down for
  one."</p>

  <p>To-night, having sat for some minutes meditatively tapping his front teeth
  with the top of his pen, Paul slowly pushed back his chair, regarded Marcia
  as an object of great interest and, clearing his throat, solemnly abjured
  invention&mdash;his recent invention in particular and all inventions in
  general. It wasn't his job. He would never attempt it again.</p>

  <p>"I can't say I blame you much, dear, for deciding to give it up. After
  all, you could hardly have expected&mdash;" Marcia had tried to put just the
  right degree of approval into her remarks, knowing that if she joined too
  heartily in his own pooh-poohing of his experiment he was likely to attempt a
  defence of them. And fearing she had already begun a comment which might
  involve her in an argument, she dropped it suddenly, <i>en route,</i> as
  being a bit too hot to hold, and gave herself to a diligent recovery of a
  lost stitch in the sweater she was knitting for Wallie.</p>

  <p>"Do you know&mdash;Marcia&mdash;" Paul rose, thrust his hands deep into
  his pockets of his smoking-jacket, and leaned against the mantel. "You
  know&mdash;" he repeated dreamily. Marcia could see it coming&mdash;the new
  idea! It was galloping towards her with harness a-jingle and hoofs a-pounding
  and red nostrils distended. Always when Paul was about to plunge into some
  fresh adventure, he thus gave her due notice. With the unfocused, opalescent
  eye of the enraptured he would begin&mdash;after an impressive pause, "Do you
  know&mdash;Marcia&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Marcia&mdash;something tells me there's a great chance here for a
  biographical novel. Nobody has ever done a Spenser for popular consumption. I
  doubt if more than one out of a hundred knew who he was."</p>

  <p>"One out of a hundred what?" inquired Marcia, unwilling to assist in the
  reckless inflation of his already turgid bubble. "College professors,
  maybe?"</p>

  <p>"There really could be made of it," he soliloquized, disregarding her
  query, "a great story".</p>

  <p>"But don't you have to presuppose a certain amount of general interest
  before you can hope to popularize a character? I should think a book on
  Spenser frankly intended for literary workers might do better."</p>

  <p>"Now that's where you're wrong, Marcia." Paul was kind, but unbudgeable.
  "You've always insisted that I should stick to my job as a teacher and try to
  make something big out of that. It can't be done. Suppose I keep on doing
  what I'm doing. Suppose I do it a little better every year. When I'm fifty my
  salary will have been increased by a few hundreds; granted. But Marcia,
  darling, there's so much we want to do that can never be done unless I make
  some money&mdash;much more money than my position will ever provide."</p>

  <p>"I know, dear," sympathized Marcia gently, "and I want you to, of
  course."</p>

  <p>"So we can travel.... By the way"&mdash;he chuckled a little to signify
  that this needn't be taken too seriously, but his eyes showed he could easily
  be serious enough about it if given the slightest encouragement&mdash;"I
  looked in at the railway station to-day and picked up some cruise
  literature."</p>

  <p>"Paul! How silly!" laughed Marcia. "Fancy us planning a cruise."</p>

  <p>"I don't know that it's so silly," he said half-petulantly. "It certainly
  can't do any harm to talk about it. We've just got to do it, some day!"</p>

  <p>Marcia unfolded the gaudy advertising and studied the pictures of familiar
  European scenes.</p>

  <p>"It would be wonderful if we could, Paul," she agreed softly. "I do hope,
  for your sake, that we're able to. You've always been so keen on it."</p>

  <p>He reloaded his pipe and paced up and down the room for a while quite lost
  in his dreams.</p>

  <p>"Do you know&mdash;Marcia"&mdash;he paused to say impressively&mdash;"if I
  can get this thing done by the middle of May&mdash;and I don't see why not,
  for I have all the stuff in hand with practically no research to do&mdash;the
  book might be accepted for publication within a month&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;do you think they would bring it out that soon?"</p>

  <p>"I said 'accepted'," explained Paul, waving his pipe impatiently. "As soon
  as it's accepted, we should be entirely justified in raising some cash on the
  strength of what would be coming to us, or perhaps they might make me a
  liberal advance. I understand that's done, sometimes, if the book is
  sure-fire. Well&mdash;if that came to pass, we could&mdash;" He broke off to
  do a little mental arithmetic. "Let's see. We should know by the middle of
  June. We could have made our boat reservations. Then we could plan to sail
  early in July for at least a two-months' trip. Hannah would look after the
  children. You know that. I'll show you. Look&mdash;sail to Southampton, up to
  London same day. Think what it would all mean to me; literary shrines in
  London, Stratford. Oxford. Think what it would mean to me to be able to
  ramble about in old East Smithfield&mdash;where Spenser was born, you know,
  and of course we should want to see Cambridge where he went to school. Think
  of it, Marcia, three centuries and an half ago!... It would certainly do me a
  lot of good in my work," he added, hopeful that this practical feature of the
  trip might stimulate Marcia's interest to the point where she would forget to
  be prudent.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;you write your book, dear," she said, in the tone she used
  when recommending spinach to Roberta, "and you know I'll be glad enough to
  take the trip with you. I'll keep the house as quiet as I can while you're
  working."</p>

  <p>"That's the way to talk! We'll plan on it! Dream of a lifetime! You better
  have a little chat with Hannah. Tell her what we're going to do."</p>

  <p>"There'll be plenty of time for that, dear. Let's make a little secret of
  it&mdash;and not tell anybody."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe you're as confident as I am," said Paul, a bit
  disappointed. "You've got to have a will to make things happen. That's the
  way to succeed."</p>

  <p>"Sounds like Hannah," observed Marcia, amused.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;you notice that Hannah generally gets what she wants. You tell
  her what we have in mind, and see if she doesn't think it a good idea."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>It was not a good idea, at all. Flushed with plaudits&mdash;for the speech
  at the University Club was a distinct success&mdash;Paul gave himself to the
  new book with a devotion that deserved a high reward. Impatient to take off a
  trial balance on his account with fame and fortune, he asked permission of a
  publisher to send on the first half of his work (that was about the middle of
  February) and having had a favourable response he posted the manuscript,
  after which it was difficult to write, his nervous eagerness for a reply from
  the East having distracted his attention. In this pitiful state of anxiety he
  waited for six weeks, at first regarding the postman as an angel of light who
  would one day bring him a certificate to the new freedom, but eventually
  coming to consider the chap as a venomously unscrupulous churl.</p>

  <p>One day a letter came, on April 1st it was, as if to add a neat touch of
  derision to the casual unconcern with which the publisher doubted whether a
  work of this sort could expect to be commercially practical.</p>

  <p>It was a heavy blow, and Paul was in poor condition to meet it, for his
  wanton day-dreaming over the favourable reply he had so blandly anticipated
  had already dulled his capacity for earnest work. Marcia had sensed this
  danger, one day saying to him, playfully, but with conviction, "You'd better
  stop spending that money now&mdash;and carry on with the book."</p>

  <p>Unable to reconcile himself to the catastrophe, he girded up his loins
  after a week of heavy sulking, revised the early part of his manuscript and
  sent it off again to another publisher. It was easy enough to understand how
  the judgment of one house might not coincide with another. Had not
  <i>Ben-Hur</i> knocked about the country for a whole year before it found a
  firm far-sighted enough to appreciate its merit?</p>

  <p>The next rejection was more prompt and more briefly stated. They were
  grateful for his courtesy in wanting them to see his book, but it did not fit
  into their publication programme.</p>

  <p>After that, the manuscript journeyed to three more publishers, the last of
  whom replied, "We have examined so much of the work as you have sent
  us&mdash;" Ah&mdash;perhaps that was the trouble, thought Paul. They didn't
  want to pass on a mere fragment of a book. He would complete it!</p>

  <p>And he did complete it by working zealously all summer, autumn, and into
  early winter. It was sent the rounds of the front-rank publishers. Not until
  the next May did Paul decide that he had added another failure to the rather
  formidable array of defeats which had terminated the various projects of
  recent years. He did not trust himself to talk much about it to Marcia; and
  she, aware how deep was his hurt, and herself devastated with pity for him,
  tried to beguile his attention from this latest and most painful of his
  disillusions.</p>

  <p>Foster, who had charge of the University Extension lectures, asked him one
  day if he would like to go out, occasionally, to near-by towns for evening
  addresses. There was a small fee attached to these excursions&mdash;averaging
  about twenty dollars. Paul assented, and in February he was sent out twice,
  once to Milburn and again to Deshler, where he was quite royally entertained
  and his lectures were handsomely received, especially in Deshler, the local
  paper covering his appearance with a flattering column that put more lime in
  his spine than anything that had ever happened to him. Marcia was rejoiced at
  his expansive mood. That night, after he had read the account of his triumph
  at Deshler for the dozenth time (he had not realized until now to what extent
  he had covered himself with glory on that occasion), he sat gazing at the
  ceiling for a long time, and then, in the awed huskiness of one making an
  astounding discovery, he said, "Do you know&mdash;Marcia&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She put down <i>The Woman Thou Gavest Me,</i> which everybody was talking
  about, and gave him her full attention, thinking she knew what was on his
  mind. "Yes, dear," she said invitingly.</p>

  <p>"Marcia&mdash;do you know there's a lot of money to be made by lecturing
  for the chautauquas? I've had a little taste of it now and I know I could do
  it. I mean to ask Foster to-morrow how one breaks into this game. They can't
  very well pay you less than fifty dollars a day and you are booked for a
  five-day week all summer." He scribbled some figures on the back of an
  envelope. "There would be probably eight weeks of it. Expenses very small.
  Country towns mostly. Short jumps. Not much paid out for travel. Ought to net
  fifteen-sixteen hundred dollars. Put it away in the savings bank and the
  interest on eight months would be&mdash;let's see&mdash;forty-two dollars
  more."</p>

  <p>In spite of her resolution to see this through with comradely seriousness,
  Marcia grinned.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;every little helps, doesn't it? That forty-two dollars would
  be just as good to us as to anybody. It would come nearly staking us to a
  week's board and lodging in London, if we thought we had to be frugal. I'm
  going in for it, darling. Here's one thing I know I can do&mdash;for I've
  done it! I'm going on the lecture platform." He pursed his mouth and grew
  confidential, lowering his tone as against possible eavesdropping. "And some
  of those boys get fees running into big figures, after they've been properly
  publicized. It might turn out to be a great thing for us."</p>

  <p>But it didn't. Foster explaining that a man had to bring, even to so
  unexacting an institution as the chautauqua circuit, a platform reputation of
  more ample dimensions than Paul could boast. He said it kindly enough and
  promised to give his ambitious colleague some more extension dates next
  winter. By the time winter had come, however, all Europe was in the grip of
  war and there was not much of a market for lectures on the life and times and
  works of Edmund Spenser or anyone else with whose history Paul was
  conversant.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>He did not confide the stories of his successive misadventures to Hannah,
  but she knew without being told that he had been ruthlessly victimized by his
  own enthusiasms. Her heart ached for him. She wasn't quite sure whether she
  suffered more on his behalf when he was deep in the doldrums of despair or
  during the hilarious periods when he was rigging up the machinery for the
  production of his assorted tragedies; for it was obvious that the higher he
  flew his various kites, the more painful was his chagrin when they came
  careening down, a handful of broken sticks.</p>

  <p>Paul's state of mind in respect to the almost incredible disaster in
  Europe puzzled Hannah. He had always seemed so eager to go over there and see
  for himself the tombs and shrines and monuments which represented the best
  things we ourselves had fallen heir to&mdash;laws, letters, manners, arts,
  ideals. To hear him talk you would have thought that nothing we had ever
  accomplished over here was worth comparison to the greatness and glory of the
  achievements across the sea. The war somehow didn't take hold of him. True,
  he was interested in the newspapers. And he had pinned up a map on the
  living-room wall with a row of brass tacks across it to indicate the long
  crooked line of battle. Every day he moved the tacks, seeming much gratified
  when the side he thought he was cheering for had made a little indentation.
  But that was as far as his interest seemed to go. The war was just a row of
  brass-headed tacks making ugly holes in the plaster.</p>

  <p>"Awful! Isn't it?" he would say. But the tone of it was about the same as
  it would have been if someone had remarked that it was a mighty hot day.</p>

  <p>To Hannah, through those tragic years, the world was smashing up
  everything that was good. It was of no satisfaction to her when reports came
  of victories for the Allies. What mattered is which side had shed more blood
  in yesterday's "big push"?</p>

  <p>"Cheer up, Hannah!" Paul would say. "We're making some good gains
  now."</p>

  <p>"No good gains ever came that way, Mr Ward," she would reply sadly.
  "They're all wrong. They'll all lose. There will be no gains for
  anybody."</p>

  <p>Sometimes Hannah wondered&mdash;reproaching herself for this
  thought&mdash;whether the dear chap wasn't unconsciously getting a certain
  satisfaction out of it all. He had made such a muddle of his own affairs and
  had been so depressed over his defeats that the exciting reports of other
  people's more serious difficulties had diminished the gravity of his own. It
  was not that he took any pleasure in the war; rather that the war had made
  his little losses insignificant. He didn't fret now about being poor. The
  daily stories of starvation in Belgium had made his own food more
  appreciated. Perhaps he would have been indignant if anyone had said as much
  to him. One evening at dinner Wallie&mdash;nine now&mdash;had helped himself
  to a larger ration of candied sweet potatoes than he could eat, and his
  father said, "Some small boy in Belgium would probably be glad to have what
  you've left there, Wallie," to which the child replied, after a moment's
  thought, "But if I had eaten it, then he wouldn't have it either, would he?"
  Paul laughed. And Marcia laughed. It made Hannah sick that they could laugh
  at that&mdash;or anything. On his birthday, they gave Wallie an air-gun. He
  proudly showed it to Hannah. She closed her eyes tightly, shook her head, and
  with a blindly groping gesture motioned him away.</p>

  <p>"But Daddy gave it to me," explained Wallie, quite hurt.</p>

  <p>"I don't like guns," said Hannah.</p>

  <p>"This is only an air-gun."</p>

  <p>"Could you kill anything with it?"</p>

  <p>"Birds, maybe, or a squirrel."</p>

  <p>"Then I don't like air-guns."</p>

  <p>As the months passed, all mention of the war was scrupulously avoided in
  Hannah's presence. She was so unhappy that her sorrow seemed to permeate the
  whole establishment. In midsummer of '16 Paul suggested to Marcia that it was
  time their faithful Hannah had a vacation. They would send her to the country
  for a week. It was obvious she needed a bit of relief from the long-continued
  devotion to her job. Incidentally, he remarked, it would be good for all of
  them.</p>

  <p>Pretending gratitude, Hannah had gone, half aware that the Wards would
  also be taking a vacation in her absence. She resolved to control her
  feelings, realizing that she had been at fault in permitting the gloominess
  of her heart to shadow their house. On her return, she seemed almost
  cheerful.</p>

  <p>"That's exactly what she needed," said Paul. "She had stuck too close to
  it here. We must insist on her taking a little more time off." And having
  expressed this belief to Marcia he went to the kitchen where Hannah was
  ironing, and repeated it&mdash;in altered phrasing&mdash;to her.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," she agreed pleasantly, "a change of&mdash;of scenery is good
  for everybody. You can work at one thing too long. I was just thinking to-day
  about your&mdash;about what you were working on in the basement for many
  weeks."</p>

  <p>"I certainly did waste a great lot of time on that thing," he grumbled
  with sour distaste for the subject.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;of course that's up to you," she murmured without looking up
  from her work.</p>

  <p>"Up to me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;whether it was wasted time or not. You've had a good rest now.
  If you go at it again, fresh like, you might succeed. And then the time you
  have spent on it wouldn't be wasted. Isn't that so? I mean, it isn't decided
  yet whether you wasted your time. If you finished the job, everything you did
  on it before would have been time well spent.... Of course," she added
  ruefully, "as the matter stands now, you did waste a lot of time&mdash;and a
  lot of yourself, too."</p>

  <p>"Myself?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. A disappointment like that is pretty bad for a person, don't you
  think? That is, if he doesn't make some good use of it."</p>

  <p>"Good use of a disappointment?" Paul sat down on the edge of a chair and
  lighted a cigarette. "I can't see what use you could make of a
  disappointment. If you can, I'd be glad to hear about it. I've had a
  plenty."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;a disappointment," ventured Hannah, feeling her way,
  cautiously, conscious of his half-derisive grin&mdash;"sometimes a
  disappointment closes a door in a person's face, and then he looks about for
  some other door, and opens it, and gets something better than he had been
  hunting for the first time."</p>

  <p>"I tried several," said Paul glumly. "I think I tried 'em all."</p>

  <p>"I know," Hannah reinforced her remembrance with a half-dozen quick little
  consolatory nods. "I know you did, Mr Ward." Her voice lowered until it was
  barely more than a whisper. "I could have cried for you. I think I did,
  sometimes."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;well&mdash;" He affected a jaunty tone that dismissed his many
  failures <i>en bloc.</i> "I tried some things that weren't in my line. This
  one&mdash;for instance," jerking his head towards the despicable
  refrigerator. "I had no training for it. Involved a lot of chemistry. I
  didn't know enough&mdash;though I really did do three years of it at college.
  But it wasn't sufficient for this job."</p>

  <p>"That's one reason I always thought you might be able to do it," remarked
  Hannah irrationally. "I hoped may be it was going to be handed to you, like.
  Sort of a gift from&mdash;from the outside."</p>

  <p>"Outside?" echoed Paul, screwing up his face.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Hannah ironed industriously for some minutes and then admitted,
  rather flustered, that it was of course "a funny way to say it"&mdash;Paul
  continued to regard her with a puzzled gaze that she found quite
  embarrassing.</p>

  <p>"I know you don't believe in such things," she went on diffidently. "The
  other day&mdash;at my friend's house where I spent my vacation&mdash;she has
  a large library, left her by her husband&mdash;I was reading about the
  discovery of&mdash;of the law of&mdash;of&mdash;" Findin' herself bogged,
  Hannah tipped the iron up on end, rested both outspread hands on the table,
  intently searching Paul's eyes for assistance. "You know. About the
  peas&mdash;so many white and so many yellow and so many tall and so many
  dwarfs&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;you mean the law of heredity&mdash;the Mendelian scheme for
  figuring out the results of scientific mating."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;something like that. Well&mdash;do you know that this Mr Mendel
  was a monk who found out all about it in his little garden in the monastery.
  He'd never been trained to be a scientist."</p>

  <p>"I see what you're driving at now, Hannah," laughed Paul. "Mendel was
  illuminated; is that it? Had a vision from On High, or something of that
  sort; is that what you mean? Well&mdash;why shouldn't he, being a monk? If
  Heaven doesn't look after the monks&mdash;" Noting from the hurt look in her
  eyes that his teasing was ill-timed, he broke off and mumbled an apology.</p>

  <p>"The book told about another case," proceeded Hannah, apparently
  uninjured. "There was a man named Michael Faraday."</p>

  <p>"Famous English chemist&mdash;I know&mdash;invented the dynamo, too;
  didn't he? Well&mdash;did he get his from the&mdash;from the 'outside'?" Paul
  had resolved not to do any more spoofing, but the temptation was too strong.
  He grinned and waited for Hannah's rejoinder.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she replied seriously. "His father wanted him to be a
  blacksmith, but he didn't like it and got a job as a bookbinder. Maybe that
  is a good way to train for discovering a dynamo, but it doesn't sound as if
  it was. And he wasn't a monk. But the book said he did believe that there was
  something <i>outside."</i></p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I'll never get anything that way," said Paul, suppressing a
  yawn. "That's out of my line, too.... So&mdash;young lady&mdash;that's what
  you were doing on your vacation, eh? Here we send you away for some fresh air
  and a little playtime, and you sneak off into a corner to post yourself on
  the Mendelian theory of genetics and the early life of Faraday.
  Well&mdash;you'll never cease being a surprise to me, Hannah."</p>

  <p>"That wasn't all I found out, Mr Ward." She smiled cryptically as to say
  she had a super-secret which might have to be tortured out of her. "I had
  whole days&mdash;and nights, too&mdash;for reading, and the shelves were full
  of books on chemistry. I heard you say, one time, that you had to find a gas
  that wouldn't poison anybody and wouldn't take fire, and I just kept leafing
  through those books until I found one. I really did," she added
  confidentially. "You may think it was silly of me to be looking&mdash;me not
  knowing a blessed thing about it&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Paul was touched.</p>

  <p>"No," he muttered, "I don't think it was silly. I think it was splendid of
  you, Hannah. I don't deserve that kind of fidelity. It was a wonderful thing
  for you to do for me. I can't tell you just how I feel about it. You are
  certainly a good friend."</p>

  <p>There was a long pause in their talk. Then he rose, patted Hannah on the
  shoulder, and walked towards the door.</p>

  <p>"Don't you want to know," asked Hannah, "what I found?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;you see&mdash;" Paul fumbled for words that wouldn't hurt too
  much. "You see, Hannah, it wasn't just finding a gas that wouldn't poison
  anyone and wasn't inflammable. I expect there are a hundred gases like that.
  There's a lot more to it, my dear, than you thought. But I do honestly
  appreciate your trying. It was mighty fine of you."</p>

  <p>Hannah drew a slip of paper from the pocket of her apron and handed it to
  him. "There's the name of it," she said, with a little sigh. "It may be no
  good, but the book said it was not poisonous and wouldn't burn&mdash;and
  there's something else about it that I copied there. I didn't understand, but
  I thought you would."</p>

  <p>Indulgently Paul took the crumpled paper and read, "Sulphur dioxide... not
  corrosive on copper or iron." Then he stood for a long time flicking the
  paper against his thumb, his eyes narrowing. He walked to the window and
  stood looking out, drumming with his fingers against the casement. After a
  while he turned and said, "Were you talking to anybody about this,
  Hannah?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head and continued ironing.</p>

  <p>"You know I wouldn't have done that, Mr Ward," she said.</p>

  <p>"And you don't know anything about chemistry, at all?"</p>

  <p>"No, Mr Ward. Of course not. How could I?"</p>

  <p>"You just accidentally stumbled on to this while leafing through a
  textbook you found in somebody's library?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mr. Ward."</p>

  <p>"Well, by God, I believe <i>you</i> have been getting hunches from the
  'outside'? I don't see how it could be explained any other way." In the
  doorway he paused, regarded her with serious scrutiny for a moment, and said,
  "Now let's get this straight, Hannah. You were simply browsing around among
  these books, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. It's just as I told you. I don't think it was an accident. I
  was really hunting for it, you know. Do you believe," she asked wistfully,
  "that perhaps I found something?"</p>

  <p>"Either that&mdash;or, as you say, you were <i>handed</i> something."</p>

  <p>Hannah nodded, her eyes shining.</p>

  <p>"I would much rather you thought that, Mr Ward."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch05"
     id="ch05">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN it was nearing time for Peter to start to the public
  school kindergarten&mdash;he would be five in November&mdash;the two women he
  erroneously believed to be his mother and his aunt debated for an hour one
  afternoon in latter August what name he should bear.</p>

  <p>The discussion was entirely amicable, as befitted the talk of intimate
  friends, and was carried on in prudent undertones, because the object of
  their interest was playing in his small tent only a few feet from where they
  sat, slowly swaying in the garden swing, shaded by a thick mesh of maple.</p>

  <p>This question had not been at issue before. The child had never needed any
  other name than Peter. Lydia could not recall that he had ever inquired. But
  it was imperative now that the boy should be specifically identified.
  Whatever name he carried to school would be permanent. A mistake at this
  juncture might be regretted in the days to come.</p>

  <p>Of course the easiest way to handle the problem (and the way they did
  handle it when the time came) was to enroll the little chap as Peter Edmunds.
  It would spare them a lot of explaining. So far as the neighbours knew, Peter
  was the only child of Mrs Lydia Edmunds, who had lately bought the old
  Conklin home at the corner of Birch and Lincoln. There wasn't a birch within
  two hundred miles, but the memorabilia of Lincoln was everywhere about.</p>

  <p>It was nearly four years since Mrs Edmunds had acquired the stately house
  whose white columns and broad verandas gave the place an air of dignity and
  self-assurance, which even the nervous fussiness of a busy scroll-saw had
  been unable to dispute. In almost any mid-western town a four years'
  residence would be ample to establish a well-behaved citizen's solid position
  in the esteem of the neighbours, but there were about five blocks on Lincoln
  Avenue where one might live for a decade and still be considered a
  newcomer.</p>

  <p>Lydia had grinned and written back to Carrie in Virginia, "If you've a
  notion it is easy to make friends out here in the corn belt, I suggest you
  come to Waterloo and try slapping a few backs on Lincoln Avenue." Not that
  Lydia resented the exclusiveness of her neighbours, for she was not much of a
  back-slapper herself.</p>

  <p>Waterloo knew nothing about Mrs Edmunds except that she was a comely and
  prudent widow in her early forties who paid cash, drove her own small car,
  grew expensive dahlias, repainted the green shutters and white portico
  pillars of her solemn brick house every spring, attended the diminutive
  Episcopal Church on Sunday mornings, and effortlessly minded her own
  business. She carried a respectable balance in her current and savings
  accounts at the Citizens' National Bank and maintained a safety deposit-box
  there which she occasionally visited. Mr Jennings, the president, had
  negotiated the purchase of conservative bonds for her on a few occasions, and
  Mrs Jennings had called in company with Mrs Morris, the doctor's wife. And
  several other ladies of excellent social standing had come to see her, though
  their calls usually turned out to be errands of solicitation for various
  philanthropic projects in the town.</p>

  <p>But Lydia was not lonely. The standoffishness of Lincoln Avenue did not
  worry her. The days were well filled with the care of her little boy, her
  flower-garden, and the upkeep of the old brick house, where the famous
  Senator Conklin had lived up to his distinction and a little beyond his
  means, leaving at eighty a maiden daughter to whose insolvence the bank and
  the merchants were lenient while she quietly went to seed, considerately
  passing away before their patience had been overtaxed.</p>

  <p>Lydia had never bothered to explain to any of her new acquaintances in
  Waterloo that little Peter was not of her own flesh and blood. A few casual
  friends in Rattoon, two hours away by train, could have recalled the
  circumstances of the child's acceptance into the Edmunds' home, remembering
  Mrs Edmonds's grave illness when her own baby had died at birth, and her
  return from the University Hospital, thirty miles distant, with an infant
  obviously intended for adoption.</p>

  <p>The fact that this baby had not been adopted by Mr and Mrs Edmunds would
  have been of little interest to anyone in Rattoon. The Edmundses had not
  lived there long enough for their domestic affairs to stir very much
  curiosity. Jasper Edmunds, as a competent chemical engineer, had been
  employed on many widely spaced projects. The few immobile relatives they had
  left in Virginia and New Jersey were not in close contact with migratory
  Jasper and Lydia. Except for infrequent and increasingly sketchy letters from
  Lydia, now in Nevada, now in Guatemala, Oregon, Brazil, Wyoming&mdash;all
  equally remote in the provincial mind of her sister Carrie and her brother
  Henry and the smug little huddle of stiff-corseted cousins&mdash;the Edmunds
  pair were remembered back home much as they are recalled who are not expected
  to return at all.</p>

  <p>So when Jasper Edmunds, the ungregarious, had been suddenly snuffed out in
  a laboratory explosion, shortly after coming on to the chemical engineering
  staff at the big glass works in Rattoon, there were very few to be
  inquisitive about the future plans of his widow when she departed a month
  later for Waterloo.</p>

  <p>The three women who for humanity's sake as well as the sheer look of it
  had expressed an interest in her, as they sat on the edge of their chairs in
  the funerary reek of fading roses which Lydia hadn't wanted to throw away,
  were told that she thought of moving to some quiet residential community
  where the taxes were low and a desirable house might be had at a bargain. The
  trio of glass wives&mdash;Alicia Colton, Maude Frazer, and Ella Osborne,
  whose husbands were respectively Sales, Purchasing, and
  Publicity&mdash;consoled Lydia the best they could, deeming her lucky to have
  been left so securely provided for, the rumour having drifted about that
  Jasper had carried a sizeable life insurance. And while no one of them
  directly mentioned the fact that the manner of the taciturn chemist's
  departure had doubled the insurance his widow would have received in the
  event of his having died less news-worthily, Mrs Osborne remarked that it was
  certainly better, if a person's time had come, for him to be spared the
  tedium of a protracted illness.</p>

  <p>Maude and Alicia, a bit shocked by this bland confession of Ella's envy
  (Fred Osborne had been living at his club for months), hastily rectified her
  covetous comment by conceding that it was a serious blow, nevertheless, to
  have a loved one take himself off with such dispatch. But it was easy to see
  that the general concensus was that Lydia might have met any number of
  calamities more severe than the involuntary exchange of the stolid and
  uncommunicative Jasper for one hundred and fifty thousand dollars in cash.
  Whereupon the cloying scent of <i>Ce Soir ou Jamais</i> that always tagged
  along after Ella gradually disentangled itself from the withering roses that
  remained to certify to Jasper's recent decease, and Lydia returned to her
  stuffy cupboards (it was August) to prepare for the Salvation Army in its
  quest of cast-off clothing.</p>

  <p>In becoming black, but not in weeds, the widow drove to Waterloo, with
  little Peter beside her on his knees reporting the progress of the big
  moving-vans careening along behind them, their husky crews still reekingly
  wet from handling the huge boxes of books; for Lydia had resolved not to part
  with Jasper's professional library, a quite magnanimous decision when one
  reflected that it had occupied much more of his time and thought than had
  Lydia herself. And after that Rattoon, a nervous and noisy town of rapidly
  shifting population, quickly resumed its former contour almost as if the
  Edmundses had never lived there at all.</p>

  <p>It is possible that Lydia might have returned to her ancestral home in
  Virginia, where Carrie lived in the old house and Henry dwelt hard by. She
  had thought of it just a little, until her brother had insisted upon it with
  an urgency out of all proportion to his normal interest in her welfare.
  Henry's suggestion that he might be of some assistance in the prudent
  investment of her considerable windfall brought Lydia to a prompt decision.
  But the chief reason for her wanting to remain in the general vicinity of the
  university town was her attachment to an all-but-indispensable friend she had
  found during her convalescence at the University Hospital. In Waterloo, she
  would be close enough to her friend for frequent meetings.</p>

  <p>Anybody but Lydia herself might have thought that she and her new comrade
  were miles apart socially, but in respect to congeniality they might have
  been sisters. Lydia was the elder by three years, appearing older than that,
  for her hair had turned quite grey. It was an unusual friendship, not only
  because of their mutual affection but because Lydia's cherished friend was
  little Peter's mother.</p>

  <p>"Of course the time might come," conceded Lydia, guarding her voice, "when
  he would prefer to be known by his rightful name, though I can't think of any
  possible advantage it could ever be to him. It isn't likely," she went on, a
  bit reluctantly&mdash;for her remark was going to be painful&mdash;"it isn't
  likely that Peter will lose any property by not being a Bradford, now that
  his father has another wife. You've never pressed a claim for yourself or the
  boy, and by the time Peter is old enough to do it on his own
  account&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But he wouldn't!"</p>

  <p>"I know, dear. I was just thinking of the possibilities, not the
  probabilities."</p>

  <p>Lonely for their attention, Peter came towards them, dragging his little
  red cart filled with sand.</p>

  <p>"Don't spill it on the grass, son," said Lydia gently. "Take it over there
  closer to the box. That's a good boy."</p>

  <p>"But I don't want you to talk any more," he remonstrated, wrinkling up his
  freckled face into a lugubrious expression of outraged patience. "Why can't
  Aunt Hannah come and play with me? You said you would, an awful long time
  ago."</p>

  <p>Lydia watched them with brooding affection, Hannah sitting on the grass
  with a shapely arm hooked over the board that boxed the sandpile on three
  sides, listening attentively to her child's chatter about the plight of a
  beleagured party of wooden clothespins who were hiding in a cave fearful of
  an attack from the formidable bandit-troupe of chess pieces, four of whom
  were mounted and ready to go into action.</p>

  <p>"I do wish," remarked Hannah over her shoulder, "that Peter would play at
  something besides battles."</p>

  <p>"You don't want him to be a milk-sop, do you?" murmured Lydia, adding,
  with sly satisfaction, "not that there's much danger of it, the little
  ruffian."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>While they played, Lydia, bending over her needlework, drifted into the
  favoured reminiscence which so often occupied her mind, living over again the
  days when she had first met Hannah because of Peter.</p>

  <p>"Look, Mrs Edmunds," the nurse was saying. "Isn't he cunning?" Lydia had
  been sitting apathetically in the hospital solarium, her inert hands empty as
  her cloudy eyes, not caring much whether she lived or died. In response to
  the girl's voice she had looked up, slowly. Had she been asked if she wanted
  to see a pretty baby she would have shaken her head. Baby? After having lost
  her own, less than a month ago? Certainly not. But here was the tiny fellow
  at arm's reach.</p>

  <p>"I've an errand on this floor," said the nurse. "Want to hold him until I
  come back?" Without waiting for consent, she had deposited the warm little
  bundle in Lydia's lap. "This," she announced, affecting a formal
  introduction, "is Master Peter Parmalee Bradford, whose mother isn't quite
  ready to take charge of him and whose other parent is&mdash;is out of
  town."</p>

  <p>"So they weren't married, then," Lydia couldn't help saying. She had
  always considered it desirable for a child's existence to be properly
  organized by the state.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. Parentage all straight. I saw the certificate. The mother is a
  darling. I suppose she picked a lemon.... Isn't he the best looking little
  thing you ever saw?"</p>

  <p>Next day Lydia had asked to see Peter's mother, and Hannah came, on her
  first day off, straightforward, sincere, sensible, gratified that her baby's
  welfare was assured. As soon as she was earning anything she would pay what
  she could toward the child's care, hopeful of reclaiming him when her
  circumstances permitted. Lydia liked her honesty. It was pleasant now to
  recall those days when the doctors and nurses were amazed over their
  difficult patient's rapid recovery.</p>

  <p>Then came Hannah's fortnightly visits; to Rattoon first, where, when
  Jasper died, Lydia had leaned full weight against her resourceful new friend
  for a couple of days when the first impact of the blow was dizzying&mdash;and
  then to quiet little Waterloo. In fragments, and with no intent to tell the
  story of her life chronologically, Hannah had reviewed enough of her past to
  interpret her present. She had remembered almost nothing of her native Surrey
  and only an episode or two of the steerage voyage with her parents and three
  brothers, all older. There still swam vaguely before her eyes the
  kaleidoscope that had been New York in 1880, not quite so noisy and
  tremendous as it was to be later, but confusing enough to bewilder a shy
  little tot from the English countryside.</p>

  <p>Thence to the large estate of the Raymonds on the North Shore in New
  England to which Dan Parmalee had come&mdash;all the way from Reigate in
  Surrey&mdash;to be the head gardener in an expensive fairyland of lilacs and
  laurel, tulips and rhododendrons, hawthorn and azaleas, with acres of green
  velvet bounded by weathered stone walls and shaded by magnificent elms.</p>

  <p>There had been no rancour in Hannah's memories of her childhood; and a
  wonder it was, too, Lydia often thought, for old Dan's family discipline must
  have been a frightfully cruel regimentation of their home. Proudly she
  stressed her industrious father's honesty, loyalty, obedience, but there was
  no doubt that Dan was hard, so hard that little Dannie had run away at
  thirteen. No&mdash;they never heard from him. Perhaps he went to Vancouver:
  he had often asked questions about the Canadian North-west. The other
  boys&mdash;James and William&mdash;when half-grown had gone back to England,
  working their passage on a freighter. It was easy to gather that Hannah's
  patience and poise dated back to her enforced self-containment as a child
  sitting calmly at the table of irascible old Dan, waiting to speak until she
  was spoken to, and outwardly conducting herself with a fair imitation of her
  mousy little mother's experienced docility.</p>

  <p>The next phase of Hannah's life was worth a book. Lydia had never heard a
  story so tender. They had known each other a long time before Hannah ventured
  upon it, one rainy Sunday afternoon, during a week's vacation in
  Waterloo.</p>

  <p>As a young girl she had seen very little of Philip, the Raymonds' only
  child. Either he was abroad with his mother or in a boys' school in Andover.
  Hannah met him occasionally on summer days, and sometimes he would stop and
  talk to her briefly, kindly, always amused over the little curtsies she made
  when shyly replying to his friendly questions.</p>

  <p>"You don't have to bob like that when you talk to me," Philip had teased.
  "All men are created equal in this country."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," Hannah had replied, dipping a curtsy. "Thank you, sir."</p>

  <p>"But it makes me nervous!" protested Philip. "Stop it!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," agreed Hannah, bobbing. And then Philip had laughed until the
  embarrassed little girl's tears came.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, Hannah," he said contritely. "I didn't mean to hurt your
  feelings." They had both smiled and Hannah had murmured, "No, sir. Thank you,
  sir," with a final jerk of her round little knees.</p>

  <p>As they grew up, Philip's attitude, on the infrequent occasions of their
  meeting-in-the-garden or elsewhere on the grounds, always conveyed the
  impression that there wasn't very much difference in their social stations,
  but Hannah had never humoured him in this. It had been rubbed into her very
  bones that she belonged to the servant class and would be at her best while
  keeping that fact steadily in mind. Remembering your place had been part of
  old Dan's religion. And Hannah's too.</p>

  <p>Once when they were talking about the life of a servant, Lydia had said,
  "I've often wondered if it wasn't rather debasing to have to wear a
  uniform."</p>

  <p>"I never felt that way about it," Hannah replied with spirit, "and I don't
  believe the king does, either."</p>

  <p>Lydia had smilingly reminded her that there was a world of difference
  between the two liveries, but Hannah shook her head decisively. "Not if the
  king and the housemaid are both doing their duty," she said, "and keeping in
  their rightful place."</p>

  <p>At sixteen&mdash;Hannah had not ventured to tell Lydia that she had been
  an uncommonly pretty girl, but had shown her an old group photograph
  including an attractive young brunette with a shy smile and promising
  curves&mdash;she had been asked to come to the big house as a parlour-maid.
  She had gone willingly enough, though rather regretful to be done with
  school, where she had been happy, partly because she wanted an education, but
  mostly for the freedom from the stultifying exactions at home. Work at the
  big house (she still called it that) was not heavy. For months on end only
  the servants were in possession. In summers it swarmed with guests and social
  events. In the winter there was almost nothing to do, and Hannah had spent
  most of her uncharted time in the well-stocked library.</p>

  <p>"I was so glad afterwards," she told Lydia, "for it helped me to
  understand so many of the things he wanted to talk about."</p>

  <p>She couldn't remember exactly when she began worshipping Philip. Looking
  back on it all from this distance Hannah thought it must have dated from the
  time when she was a spindle-shanked, pigtailed, ratty little thing of twelve,
  secretly admiring the handsome fifteen-year-old boy in white flannels on the
  tennis court. "I know my feeling for Philip kept me from being silly over
  other boys," she said. "Doubtless I should be thankful for that."</p>

  <p>"I wonder," Lydia had replied. "You might have had a happier life if you
  had married one of your schoolmates."</p>

  <p>Hannah had doubted that, proceeding with the story of her difficulty in
  concealing her love for Philip when, after she had gone to work in the big
  house, they would occasionally meet in the hall or she would have some small
  service to do for him.</p>

  <p>"Once the housekeeper sent me to his room to gather up his linen. I
  thought he had gone away for the day and went into his room without knocking.
  'I'm sorry,' I said, when I ran into him with his hair wet and tousled and
  himself all muffled up in a big Turkish bathrobe. And he said, 'What have you
  got to be sorry about? You don't look as if you were ever sorry in your
  life.' Of course he was just trying to put me at ease. But I couldn't forget
  what he had said. Perhaps he really did think I looked like that. So I always
  tried to look that way for him&mdash;as if I'd never been sorry. I suppose it
  was awfully silly.... Sometimes when the house was full of company I helped
  serve the table. It seemed that no matter how many guests there were, or how
  much help we had, I always was assigned to serve Philip. My hand would
  tremble until I was afraid he might notice it. But I'm sure he didn't. I
  don't think he ever once looked me squarely in the eyes until he was sick.
  Probably he didn't know I was there at all&mdash;not until then."</p>

  <p>During the Christmas holidays of his junior year at Harvard, Philip had
  been visited by some college friends. They had spent almost every daylight
  hour for a week in the snow. He had taken a severe cold. It had developed
  into a serious pleurisy.</p>

  <p>Hannah had not seen him often, and then only for brief glimpses when she
  was sent to his room with messages to one or the other of the nurses, until
  warm spring days came. Once, while the nurse had gone in to bring his lunch
  out to the garden where he sat in his wheel-chair, they had sent her out with
  the morning paper, which had just arrived.</p>

  <p>"And how have you been, Hannah?" he had inquired kindly. "I haven't seen
  you for a long time. Want to stay a bit and read me the news? The sun dazzles
  my eyes."</p>

  <p>She had sat down on the stone bench near his chair to read to him in a
  voice that she remembered was very unsteady. He was so pale and his long
  hands were so thin. Presently she faltered in the middle of a sentence, and
  he said: "You mustn't do that, Hannah. It's because you always seem so happy
  that I want you to read to me. Don't disappoint me, please."</p>

  <p>And she had rubbed her fists hard into her wet eyes, smiling the best she
  could. "I'm sorry," she had murmured thickly. "The sun is awfully bright
  to-day."</p>

  <p>Hannah believed it had been this remark of hers that had made Philip want
  to keep her with him. The family had been so depressed. He was hoping to find
  someone who wouldn't cry. He had smiled into her eyes and said, "After you've
  had your lunch I wish you would come out here again and read me this book."
  Hannah remembered what it was&mdash;<i>The Flute and Violin,</i> by James
  Lane Allen, which had just been published.</p>

  <p>Well&mdash;that was the real beginning of it, not counting the way she had
  felt towards him before. Hannah was a bit self-conscious, at first, over all
  the attention she was receiving. Apparently the whole household realized that
  she was becoming important to Philip's welfare and deferred to her as they
  did to the nurses. She wasn't asked to do anything after nine in the morning,
  so that she would be at liberty to read to Philip if he wanted her, which he
  always did on pleasant days and sometimes on rainy ones too, in his room.</p>

  <p>That had been a memorable summer. Hannah had read to Philip a full score
  of the current books that people were discussing. She would call up the Old
  Corner Book Store, and because the people knew there about Philip's illness
  they would hasten the deliveries. She recalled the names of some of the books
  they read: <i>The Master of Ballantrae,</i> which Philip liked, she thought,
  mostly because it had been written by a sick man almost as badly off as
  himself; <i>A Hazard of New Fortunes,</i> which he admired for its superb
  composition and she disliked because it seemed to make him pensive and
  restless; <i>The Light That Failed,</i> a story she felt wasn't a bit good
  for him; and <i>The Little Minister,</i> in the very middle of which he had
  stopped her to say, "You could do a very good Babbie yourself, Hannah." But
  it wasn't often he said anything like that. Not that first summer.</p>

  <p>"I never knew just why he said that to me," Hannah had reflected. "Babbie
  was such an impudent little piece."</p>

  <p>"And were you still bobbing curtsies to Philip, through those days?" Lydia
  had inquired, to which Hannah had replied, with a puckery little smile:
  "No&mdash;he didn't want me to. But I was very respectful."</p>

  <p>When winter came, Mrs Raymond had taken him to Arizona. The house seemed
  very large and empty. Mr Raymond was living at an hotel in town and did not
  come out. The snow was deep and there was little to do but read. Hannah had
  made good use of her leisure, hoping to be an acceptable companion to Philip
  on his return. The days seemed very long, but eventually they all passed.</p>

  <p>The Arizona sun had tanned him brown, parchment brown, but the sharply
  defined bones in his hands and the keen outlines of his face made one wonder
  whether the baking had done him very much good. Hannah had thought it best
  not to put in an appearance at once upon his arrival. He might not want her.
  It would be more prudent to wait until she was sent for. They had come at
  noon. At three, she was called. Mr Philip was out in the garden, said the
  nurse, and wanted to speak to her. Hannah's heart was in her mouth. She hoped
  Philip and his mother, who stood beside him holding a flower-basket half
  filled with iris, would not notice how flustered she was. Philip had smiled,
  the smile full of tiny little wrinkles, millions of them, in semi-circles
  about his mouth, and had reached out a sadly emaciated hand.</p>

  <p>"Hello," he said, almost as if they had not been separated at all. And
  Hannah had taken the lean hand and said, "Hello", without meaning to be so
  forward. But Mrs Raymond hadn't seemed to resent the liberty. She had smiled.
  "I think Philip will be wanting you to read to him again, Hannah," she said.
  It was the first time Mrs Raymond had ever referred to Philip in Hannah's
  presence without the 'Mr'.</p>

  <p>"And what did Mrs Raymond think of Philip's having you with him so much?"
  Lydia had asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. She seemed anxious that he should be humoured in every
  way."</p>

  <p>"Didn't she suspect you were in love with him?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Hannah assuredly. "Not then."</p>

  <p>"But you were&mdash;then?"</p>

  <p>"I would have died for him," whispered Hannah.</p>

  <p>They had talked more than they read, that summer. Philip was much more
  serious than he had been. It wasn't as if he had lost all interest in current
  news and contemporary books, but he had the mood of one who, as Hannah
  expressed it, had "backed off a long way to look at things through a
  telescope." He wanted her to read history to him, especially English history
  dating from Restoration days, and France of the period when America was just
  beginning to be ambitious for a national life of her own.</p>

  <p>But she would no more than get started on the tale of another costly
  conflict before Philip would say:</p>

  <p>"Now there it is again, Hannah. Every time they fought they came out of it
  with more problems on their hands than they'd had before, plus the loss of
  the best and bravest people. More problems, and fewer brains left to deal
  with them."</p>

  <p>And then he would discuss this odd idea that seemed to be influencing his
  thoughts about everything, his queer belief that any sort of conflict was
  unprofitable.</p>

  <p>"I thought at first that his illness was making him religious," Hannah had
  reflected. "But I don't believe that had much to do with it. He didn't talk
  about the evil of fighting; just the uselessness of it. Perhaps it was
  because I loved him so dearly that everything he said sounded reasonable,"
  she would admit.</p>

  <p>"One day he remarked, 'If I have to back up my opinions with a club, it's
  not much of a compliment to my opinions. It really means that my opinions
  aren't good enough to stand on their own merits. I don't even trust them
  myself when I lay in a supply of gunpowder to anticipate somebody else's
  disbelief in them. When people fight, they give their whole case away. I
  think they fight because they have no case.'"</p>

  <p>"Did you remind him," Lydia had ventured, "that slavery would still be a
  legalized institution in this country if we hadn't fought it out?"</p>

  <p>"Philip said we could more profitably have bought it out."</p>

  <p>"Well, naturally," Lydia had laughed. "I think that too, being a
  Virginian. But isn't it generally believed that there were some principles
  involved beyond the mere commercial part of it?"</p>

  <p>Hannah had shaken her head vigorously. "Philip thought all wars were
  avoidable, including that one. The worst of all the bad things about war, he
  believed, was the humiliation of defeat. He used to talk much, that summer,
  about saving face. You know&mdash;the Chinese idea. He felt that the bravest
  thing you could do, in any conflict, was to help your enemy save his
  self-respect. So long as he hadn't lost face, he was likely to act with
  dignity and remember that he was a gentleman. But if you demolished that, you
  made a brute of him; and you really couldn't blame him much if, after having
  lost his self-respect, he turned on you and forced you, too, into using your
  teeth and claws. Philip said, 'If you ever want to know how much distance
  we've put between ourselves and the animals, force your enemy to admit that
  he is no longer a free creature.'"</p>

  <p>Lydia's brows contracted studiously, and then she smiled a little over her
  remembrance of Hannah's zealous but amusing efforts to interpret the more
  difficult articles of young Philip Raymond's strange creed. Sometimes she had
  been tempted to remark, "Perhaps the dear fellow's frail health may have
  influenced his opinions." But she never actually said it. Hannah would have
  resented the implication that her hero disbelieved in fighting because he
  himself was not physically up to it.</p>

  <p>"It's a nice enough theory, Lydia had conceded politely.</p>

  <p>"Only you do not take any stock in it yourself; do you?"</p>

  <p>"What <i>I</i> think, Hannah, is beside the point. Nobody has made war on
  me and I have no cause to do battle. My opinion is worthless. But, honestly,
  we wouldn't have had any progress at all, would we, if our ancestors had not
  fought for their rights? Hasn't our history been just one long string of
  battles&mdash;from the very beginning of things?"</p>

  <p>And then Hannah would try to repeat what Philip had said about that,
  though it wasn't easy to do. Lydia grinned as she wondered what Hannah's
  Professor Ward might have thought of their ill-informed discussion. She
  herself was no historian, much less a philosopher, for all her reading and
  the lectures she had heard in the finishing school in Baltimore. And Hannah's
  vocabulary in this field was limited to a little handful of Philip's phrases
  which sounded strange indeed when sprinkled through her simple speech.</p>

  <p>"Philip said it was never the fighting that produced progress," insisted
  Hannah, feeling her way cautiously. "He said that all our progress had come
  about through adaptation."</p>

  <p>"Adaptation?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;to circumstances, conditions, environment."</p>

  <p>Then they had both laughed. "Adaptation" and "environment" were quite a
  mouthful for Hannah. She tried her best to explain, realizing that she was
  making a poor job of it but eager to justify Philip's odd ideas. In her own
  words&mdash;and with many long pauses for reorganization of her
  argument&mdash;Hannah had proceeded to her task, employing the illustrations
  he had used.</p>

  <p>It was this way, she said. When the people of one tribe had worn out their
  soil, fished out their streams, and frightened away the game, they could do
  one of two things: make war on a neighbouring prosperous tribe, or migrate to
  a new locality. The usual thing was to make war. If victorious, they captured
  the land and enslaved the people. The slaves were forced to do the work while
  their new masters grew fat, lazy and stupid. Presently another army of
  invaders would come in and repeat the story. History was uncertain about many
  things but quite sure on this point: to acquire property by capture
  endangered the life of the victors. <i>The possession of anything you hadn't
  earned was a constant menace.</i></p>

  <p>Or the restless tribe could migrate to an undeveloped country and claim it
  for their own without contesting for it. In the strange land they would meet
  unfamiliar conditions. Perhaps the climate would be colder, requiring heavier
  clothing. They would learn to trap for furs. They wove firmer cloth on
  stronger looms with more skilful hands, taking pride in their craft and
  inventing artistic designs to distinguish their fabrics. The new foods were
  cultivated with better tools and cooked in a better pottery. Soon the people
  were creating art-forms in clay. Every new condition drove the tribe forward
  mentally. Swifter rivers demanded tougher boats. Hard woods dulled the old
  axes. Minds became more supple under the daily challenge. And so the people
  moved forward into greatness, not by looting and enslaving, but by yielding,
  conforming, adapting themselves to difficult circumstances.</p>

  <p>"Of course I see that," Lydia had agreed. "Naturally it's better to work
  out something for oneself than to twist things out of other people's fingers.
  But&mdash;look here! Suppose some greedy tribe makes war on <i>you.</i> Are
  you supposed to sit there and let them hack you into cat's meat, or are you
  to drop everything you own and run away&mdash;so's to avoid a fight?"</p>

  <p>Hannah had admitted that this was indeed, the hard part of Philip's
  theory. He had sat for hours thinking about it. Sometimes he would speak
  fragments of his thoughts, as if Hannah had been following his thoughts and
  knew exactly where he was in his speculations.</p>

  <p>"Almost anyone would say it wasn't common sense, I think," Philip would
  confess. "And it isn't. People with common sense, when their property is
  threatened, fight back just as furiously as they can. Maybe they are defeated
  and lose all. Maybe they are victorious, after having been maimed,
  impoverished, and loaded with debt. But the common-sense thing to do is to
  fight back, and protect your rights. Besides&mdash;it's the brave thing to do
  and you're probably hissed if you don't. Only a little minority could be
  expected to stand out against public sentiment and display the uncommon sense
  of handing everything over, after which they could be free to move out into a
  new country&mdash;new set of conditions. Speaking of courage, Hannah, this
  programme of living would test a man's valour more severely than any mere
  war. Only a few would be able to venture upon it. Fewer would be able to see
  it through. The rank and file wouldn't have the stuff in them to obey its
  hard demands, and probably shouldn't be asked to undertake it. But&mdash;I
  wonder if this isn't the way men become great.</p>

  <p>"Imagine the case of a man who had used all his ingenuity to build up
  something for himself, and after he had succeeded to the point of being able
  to sit down and enjoy the rewards of his work some circumstance stripped him
  of everything he had, requiring him to take up the struggle again in a
  different field. Wouldn't he be much more valuable to himself&mdash;and
  society&mdash;for having had such an experience? Suppose a man consented to
  give up everything and make a new place for himself under conditions that
  forced him into new habits of mind, wouldn't it be a wonderful
  developer?"</p>

  <p>Really, it was about all that Philip wanted to discuss as the summer days
  lazily passed. Hannah said the thing had taken such a grip on him that it was
  impossible not to be affected by it, even if the whole theory was so
  difficult that it seemed&mdash;on first hearing&mdash;to be mere nonsense.
  "It's funny," Hannah had reflected, "how an idea will grow on you if you give
  it enough room. The time came when I believed it myself."</p>

  <p>"That was because you were in love with Philip," Lydia had remarked
  gently. "If he had said the moon is made of green cheese, you would have
  believed it."</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," confessed Hannah. "And for all I know," she added, "maybe
  it is."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>"I want an ice-cream soda, Aunt Hannah, a chocolate one," Peter was
  saying.</p>

  <p>"Very well, darling. We'll ask mother." Hannah was struggling to her feet.
  "Want to go with us, Lydia?"</p>

  <p>"You take Peter. I'll stay and see what Susie is having for dinner. Run
  along, you two, and have a good time." She would have been glad to go, but
  felt that Hannah had a right to be alone with her child as much as
  possible.</p>

  <p>The beloved pair moved towards the house, probably to put Peter into a
  clean suit and brush Hannah's tangled hair. Lydia's needle lagged as she
  watched them cross the shaded lawn, Peter shrilly impatient to be off at once
  on their important errand. She glanced down at her chatelaine watch. It was
  only four-thirty. The swing swayed gently. The slim needle gathered up
  another loop of white silk....</p>

  <p>And so it was October again, and Philip was to return to Arizona with his
  mother, leaving in a few days. Mrs Raymond had called Hannah into the library
  that morning and closed the door.</p>

  <p>"Hannah," she began, "we have a very sick boy. I am afraid he is not going
  to be with us long. Anything he wants, he should have. Now he thinks you
  should go along to Arizona and help entertain him this winter. He finds your
  company congenial. I believe, too, that you are good for him. Would you like
  to go?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, ma'am&mdash;if you both want me to, ma'am."</p>

  <p>Philip's mother had found it difficult to continue with what she felt was
  necessary to be said. After a long pause, during which she absently
  rearranged the various writing materials on the desk, she glanced up, and
  searching the girl's eyes, said: "You seem to be an understanding person,
  Hannah. We must have an honest talk. If you go with us to Arizona you will
  not be a nurse or a maid, but neither will you be a part of the family. Let
  us have all that understood. Philip likes you very much and has found you a
  great comfort. He may even be a little bit in love with you. I don't know...
  do you?"</p>

  <p>Hannah shook her head and knew that her cheeks were scarlet. "He has never
  talked to me about such things, ma'am.... He likes me to be with him&mdash;to
  read and talk... I think that's all."</p>

  <p>"And you?" asked Mrs Raymond, seriously but kindly. "Is that
  all&mdash;with you?"</p>

  <p>Lydia, remembering how deeply affected Hannah had been when she told this
  part of the story, felt that it must have been a very touching moment.</p>

  <p>Mrs Raymond had risen from her chair and walked across the room, facing
  the perplexed girl, who, for answer to the candid question, had cupped her
  face in both hands and suddenly given way to a long, sobbing intake of
  breath.</p>

  <p>Putting her arm around Hannah she murmured, "That's what I was afraid of,
  dear. You're going to be dreadfully hurt."</p>

  <p>"I didn't want anybody ever to know," confided Hannah, when she could
  speak. "I tried not to, Mrs Raymond&mdash;honestly, I did!"</p>

  <p>"You are telling the truth, Hannah. I believe you. This is a very hard
  position we have made for you. And considering how you feel towards Philip, I
  think you have done very well."</p>

  <p>"Of course, Mrs Raymond," said Hannah, trying to control her voice, "I
  knew I never could have him. I'm not good enough for him. But&mdash;I
  couldn't help loving him; could I?"</p>

  <p>And then Mrs Raymond had drawn Hannah into her arms and said thickly: "You
  needn't be ashamed of your love, dear. It's quite high grade, I should say.
  I'm glad you were willing to tell me." Hannah had pressed her forehead hard
  against the older woman's shoulder, reluctant to turn away.</p>

  <p>"Please, Mrs Raymond," she whispered, "I think you're&mdash;wonderful.
  I'll promise you&mdash;I won't ever let him know."</p>

  <p>"I'm not quite sure," said Mrs Raymond, slowly, "that I want you to make
  such a promise. We are all going to do everything we can to make Philip
  happy." She tightened her embrace of Hannah's girlish figure, while her tears
  ran unchecked. "And if it brightens one single day for him to know that he
  has your affection, you may tell him. You will not do it unless he asks. And
  keep it in mind that your love for my son&mdash;whether he lives or
  dies&mdash;is quite hopeless. It's too bad the world is organized that way,
  but&mdash;but that's the way it is organized, and you know it."</p>

  <p>For a moment longer they clung to each other in silence. Then Mrs Raymond
  suddenly disengaged herself, dabbed the tears out of her eyes, walked
  dignifiedly to her desk, consulted her engagement pad, and said in a crisp,
  business-like tone, "You will accompany me into town to-morrow. I shall get
  you some suitable clothes and a trunk. We will start at nine."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, ma'am," replied Hannah, deferentially at attention.</p>

  <p>"We leave on Thursday noon for the West. I have spoken to your father. You
  will be in readiness for the trip. I need hardly say that you are not to
  discuss this with any of the other servants. Meantime, you are relieved of
  your usual duties."</p>

  <p>"Yes, ma'am." Hannah made a prim little curtsy.</p>

  <p>"That will be all, then. You may go."</p>

  <p>"Yes, ma'am." Hannah turned and walked quickly towards the door.</p>

  <p>"Hannah!" Mrs Raymond's voice was military.</p>

  <p>"Yes, ma'am." The girl straightened and waited.</p>

  <p>"Very well done!"</p>

  <p>"Thank you, ma'am. The same to you, please, if I may say so."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>And so they went to Arizona, where Philip sat all day in the sun with
  Hannah beside him, reading, talking, listening mostly. One afternoon he said
  to her, after an extended silence, "You know I'm not going to be here much
  longer, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Please, Philip," she begged.</p>

  <p>"It's not that I care greatly," he went on, listlessly. "Life, the way
  I've been living it, isn't much of a treat. I would have liked to have had a
  real go at it, Hannah. Just between us, I wanted to see if that little idea
  of mine was sound."</p>

  <p>"Want me to try it, Philip?... in case&mdash;you can't?"</p>

  <p>His face was puzzled, and for some time he did not reply.</p>

  <p>"No, dear. It might make life very hard for you. I wouldn't want you to do
  that. I'm too fond of you."</p>

  <p>"But I really believe in it, Philip."</p>

  <p>Then he had reached out a pathetically slim hand which she took in both of
  hers and held tightly against her high, youthful breasts.</p>

  <p>"I love you, Hannah," he said softly.</p>

  <p>With the utmost resolution Hannah had replied, as if she considered his
  love but a dear comradeship, "Isn't it sweet, Philip, that we do like each
  other so much... And we always will&mdash;won't we?"</p>

  <p>And so Philip Raymond had been brought home again, weaker by far but
  rallying emotionally to the summons of a New England spring that strained at
  its leash with an impatience almost articulate. It was the gayest, brightest
  of springs. It recklessly splashed every conceivable variant of adolescent
  green and waxy yellow on a palette of woods and gardens bounded by the hills
  and the sea, coaxing many a discouraged, frozen, brittle thing to rise from
  the seeming dead with a gallant resolve to bring forth foliage and flowers.
  Philip was almost merry, those afternoons in latter May and June, so
  responsive to the revitalizing urge that Hannah often wondered&mdash;with her
  heart more than her head&mdash;if he might not really renew his strength.</p>

  <p>Surely it was a valorous last stand that he made in defence of his youth
  and its natural urges, as Nature posted her demand for the resurrection of
  everything that held the faintest pulse. Hannah had thought it the most
  heart-breaking thing of all&mdash;Philip's sending for his tailor and
  standing dizzily to be measured for natty sports clothes. He even ordered a
  new pair of riding-boots, and stroked their softness with gaunt fingers.</p>

  <p>Late one afternoon&mdash;she had been reading Whitman's <i>Leaves of
  Grass,</i> rather wishing Philip had asked for something else&mdash;he laid a
  white hand on the open pages, his signal that he wanted to make a remark, and
  said huskily, "Hannah, dear, <i>if</i> I should get well&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You must say 'when', Philip. You're ever so much better."</p>

  <p>"Would you, darling?" he entreated.</p>

  <p>Hannah's training steadied her and counselled prudence.</p>

  <p>"I'm not of your class, dear," she said gently.</p>

  <p>"And I'm the mere shadow of a man. Let's resolve to forget all that and
  obey good old Walt's challenge. You forget your silly notions about caste and
  I'll forget I'm sick." He took up the book from her lap and in a wobbly
  scrawl wrote in the wide margin opposite the brave declaration, <i>"From this
  hour freedom! From this hour I ordain myself loosed of
  limits!</i>"&mdash;"June twenty-third&mdash;1892&mdash;this is our resolve.
  Philip Raymond." He handed the book back to her, and the pen, and she wrote
  underneath his name, "Hannah Parmalee."</p>

  <p>"And if that meant we were engaged," Hannah had said to Lydia, "I suppose
  we were engaged."</p>

  <p>"I don't see what else," Lydia had replied. And it was all true enough.
  Lydia had seen it in the book. The ink was faded, but the joint declaration
  was clear, significant.</p>

  <p>But as the pastures browned and the locusts came and the blue smoke of
  burning leaves was scattered into greyish wisps by October rains, Philip gave
  up the brave fight, not conscious of any particular art of surrender or
  wittingly determined to quit; but, without meaning to do so, he quietly
  withdrew from the institution he had called Life. There was nothing dramatic
  about his actual departure. It was on a raw, sleety afternoon of November,
  while the first surly swish of winter lashed the windows. Sleet, ever
  afterwards, Hannah had said, swept her courage all away. It became the sign
  of defeat, sign of everything lost.</p>

  <p>Philip had been unconscious for two days. Mr Raymond sat with his head in
  his hands by the bed. Mrs Raymond came and went softly, knowing that her boy
  had already pushed out to sea and would not be back. Hannah was not needed
  and no one seemed to remember. It was just as well. She was incapable of any
  more suffering, and there was nothing she could do for the quiet form that
  gradually melted away. When the starched nurse came down to the kitchen and
  said, "Well&mdash;it's all over&mdash;at last", Hannah had no tears left to
  shed. She went home to the rather grim cottage of Dan Parmalee, took a book
  from under her pillow, and on the margin, above Philip's name, opposite the
  courageous line <i>"From this hour, freedom!"</i> Hannah wrote, "Five p.m.
  November nineteenth, 1892."</p>

  <p>Lydia had thought it very unfortunate indeed that Mrs Raymond had died a
  few months afterwards, for no one else knew certainly how much Philip had
  cared for Hannah.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunate for her, yes," agreed Hannah. "But, for me, no. They would
  have been embarrassed to have me on their hands. I did not belong to
  them&mdash;and yet they would have felt under some sort of obligation to me,
  I suppose. Mr Raymond may not have known anything about it. I fear they had
  become just a little bit estranged. He was always very courteous, but there
  was a thick wall between them. I don't believe I would have felt right about
  taking anything from Mr Raymond... It was all for the best, so far as I was
  concerned. Mrs Raymond didn't have anything more to do&mdash;so she died. It
  would be nice if Nature was always that kind and showed as much good
  taste."</p>

  <p>Lydia had smiled over that, and Hannah had defended her droll remark
  seriously. "Why not, indeed?" she insisted. "Haven't we a right to expect
  that Nature will exhibit some good taste?"</p>

  <p>"Pish!" Lydia had replied. "I wouldn't give three cents for a double cord
  of wise books that try to give a mind and feelings to Nature... Good taste!
  Pooh! Nature? Good taste? Nonsense!"</p>

  <p>And so, after that, the big house was sold. Hannah stayed on. When the new
  people, the Coopers, came, she was employed as housekeeper. Adele, seventeen,
  was given the room Philip had occupied. Every morning Hannah filled a tall
  vase with flowers and took it to Adele's room. And the girl said, "Thank you,
  Hannah. It is sweet of you to do that. Is there anything nice that I can do
  for you?"</p>

  <p>"No, Miss Adele. I have everything I want."</p>

  <p>But the girl was always giving Hannah presents; expensive silk lingerie,
  books, bags, ornaments. Hannah would show reluctance, but Adele would seem
  hurt if she did not accept them. Once when Adele was in town for the day and
  not expected until night she came home early and found Hannah sitting beside
  her bed, her face buried in her hands.</p>

  <p>The girl had drawn the embarrassed Hannah to her feet and said, "Tell me!
  You've got to! I want to know! If there's anything&mdash;anything
  <i>funny</i> about you, I'm going to know it! Let's have it! Why are you
  mooning in my room?"</p>

  <p>And Hannah had told her&mdash;very briefly&mdash;very softly.</p>

  <p>"You won't tell anyone, please?"</p>

  <p>And Adele had buried her face on Hannah's shoulder and shaken her head and
  whispered, "No dear... God!&mdash;I'm sorry for you, Hannah.... But it must
  have been wonderful to have loved anyone&mdash;that much."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>There was an expensive wedding when Adele was twenty-three. Hannah had
  doubted the success of the match, for Martin Moore was quite a dozen years
  her senior and a century older in point of worldly experience. The best you
  could say for it was that it was "a desirable match". Hannah understood that
  phrase to mean an alliance between a rich and jaded old bachelor and a young
  girl who had been induced to believe that the things you could buy were more
  worth having than the fulfilment of a romantic dream. And perhaps the fact
  that they were going to live in Paris may have added a touch of greatly
  needed glamour to the sacrifice. Martin had business there, representing an
  American bank.</p>

  <p>Adele had taught Hannah how to dress, and had turned her own modiste loose
  on the supple and graceful form of her friend. Hannah's black crêpe uniforms
  with white piping fitted like an expensive glove. "Don't be foolish," Adele
  would exclaim when Hannah protested about the costly elegance of the frocks
  she wore every day. "Wouldn't you rather look the way God made you than wear
  some dowdy thing that deforms you? I've a lot of satisfaction looking at you
  in gowns that fit."</p>

  <p>So Hannah had felt well dressed at the wedding of her dear Adele, which
  was really the last event she ever attended that was worth thinking about;
  for old Dan Parmalee had a stroke, that winter, and as her mother was too
  frail for the necessary lifting of the big fellow, Hannah was obliged to go
  back to the cottage.</p>

  <p>For a time it seemed that Dan, now definitely out of the picture so far as
  any further usefulness was concerned, would soon die&mdash;if not of
  apoplexy, of querulousness and surly sulking. Meek little Mother Parmalee
  broke a hip, and thus added one more good reason for Hannah's remaining at
  home. With surprising tenacity of life, the fragile Emma Parmalee shakily
  drank her tea and knitted woollen socks for Dan, over a period of more than
  two years before pneumonia carried her off. Dan stayed on, alternately
  playing the role of spoiled baby and pensioned giant.</p>

  <p>Lydia had said to Hannah: "It is a pity your father couldn't have gone
  when your mother passed away. It would have set you free. Everything since
  might have been different."</p>

  <p>"But then&mdash;I mightn't have had Peter."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>They were coming now, down the back steps from the kitchen, the little
  fellow clutching a big handful of lettuce, Hannah closely following him.
  Lydia waved to them.</p>

  <p>"The rabbits," called Hannah, as they proceeded towards the far corner of
  the spacious yard. "Want to see them eat their dinner?"</p>

  <p>"When I've reached a good stopping-place," said Lydia....</p>

  <p>So, then, Adele had come home, that next summer. Within an hour after her
  arrival she had appeared at the Parmalee cottage, breezily affectionate, but
  frankly disturbed to find Hannah so inexorably tied to her uninteresting
  responsibility.</p>

  <p>"Maybe I've come back to stay," confided Adele with the old impulsive
  candour. "It isn't decided yet.... But, Hannah, you've simply got to get away
  for a little while. This isn't right. I'll tell you what!" Adele exclaimed.
  "I want to go with you. We'll go to Bar Harbour."</p>

  <p>"I couldn't," declared Hannah. "It's sweet of you&mdash;but I mustn't do
  that. Unless you want to take me as your maid."</p>

  <p>"How about going as my companion?"</p>

  <p>"What does a companion have to do?" Hannah asked. "I never noticed."</p>

  <p>"I'm not quite sure myself," confessed Adele, "for I never had one. I
  think, though, that a companion is just a person with better manners and more
  sense, who goes along to buy the tickets and read the papers to her mistress
  and take the dog out for short walks, and is willing to be snubbed when the
  old lady wants to show off a little."</p>

  <p>"Sounds like a pleasant job," observed Hannah.</p>

  <p>"That's settled, then. And you'll be wanting some nice clothes. I'll see
  to it." Adele was full of enthusiasm over her new scheme.</p>

  <p>"I don't think a companion is expected to be very modish," Hannah said, to
  which Adele whimsically replied, "This one is. I'm not old enough yet to
  demand my companion's looking a frump just to set off my fine feathers."</p>

  <p>So they went to Bar Harbour, where Thomas Bradford joined them on a
  morning stroll, the second day. When he left them Adele muttered, "There's
  something the world could get along without."</p>

  <p>Hannah laughed, but privately rose to his defence, for he had been
  pleasantly attentive to her, and it had been a long time since any man had
  regarded her with an appraising interest.</p>

  <p>"Too much mother," explained Adele. "Thomas has paddled along beside that
  old girl's beach chair ever since he left college fifteen years ago. If all
  the fools in the world would have a convention, I feel sure she would be
  nominated by acclamation to swing the gavel&mdash;and Thomas," she added as
  an afterthought, "would stand beside her and hold it for her while she wasn't
  swinging it."</p>

  <p>And Hannah laughed again, but couldn't help remembering that he had looked
  her squarely in the eyes with an expression of pleasure and interest. That
  afternoon Adele had slept and Hannah had walked and Thomas had fallen into
  step with her. Perhaps his charge slept also, temporarily freeing him to
  admire the shapely and genteel companion of feather-headed Adele
  Cooper&mdash;"What's her married name?" he asked. "I never knew the chap...
  But no matter. Tell me all about <i>you</i>&mdash;and where you've been all
  my life. Let's sit down here."</p>

  <p>The tide was out and the sea was unusually quiet. They lounged in the sand
  and talked, but not much about Hannah, which pleased her, for there wasn't
  much to tell, and Thomas was delightfully entertaining. He had been
  everywhere. Hannah reclined on an elbow and looked far out into the blue
  where it seemed to rise to meet a grey sky, quite intoxicated with the
  reminiscent voice of the widely travelled Thomas.</p>

  <p>"Blue, yes, and very lovely, as you say. But you'll never know how blue
  the bluest blue can be until you've seen a sunrise on the Bay of Naples, from
  Capri, preferably... I could wish I might be the one to show it to you, and
  watch the wonder in your eyes."</p>

  <p><i>That</i> sort of thing. And&mdash;when Hannah had confessed how very
  much she wished to travel, but first wanted to see the Surrey of her
  fathers&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You will, of course," answered Thomas confidently. "I would like to be
  along with you when you stroll down the garden paths. It would be like
  walking in a dream, wouldn't it?"</p>

  <p>It was an important afternoon for Hannah. Thomas luxuriated in his
  recollective excursions, always insisting, either directly or by implication,
  that they were reviewing these enchanted scenes together, with something like
  a veiled suggestion that they might do it in reality one of these
  days&mdash;who knew? And Hannah was enjoying herself far too much to banish
  the illusion. She listened dreamily, and made no effort to check Thomas as he
  prattled on, increasingly reckless with his use of "we", and "us", and "our",
  until it was almost as if they were actually planning a trip together.</p>

  <p>She had loved Philip with an undying devotion; but it was, she knew, a
  protective love that experienced a kind of curious ecstasy while performing
  tender little ministries to his weakness Thomas was hinting&mdash;whether in
  earnest or merely to entertain himself&mdash;at a relationship which, if it
  ever came to pass, would make her the protected, nourished, indulged. It was
  a new sensation, and highly enjoyable, even if nothing ever came of it. They
  walked back to the Gables together, saying little on the return trip. Thomas
  smiled down into her uplifted eyes, as they parted.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow?" he inquired. "About the same time?"</p>

  <p>"If you want to," said Hannah.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>"I certainly am not going to interfere the least bit with your amusement,
  Hannah," Adele had remarked, a few days afterwards. "It's your vacation, and
  God knows you've little fun coming to you. But I do hope you're not planning
  to burn your fingers."</p>

  <p>Hannah had slumped down into a low chair beside Adele's bed. "I'm afraid
  I've already done it," she murmured. "He thinks he's in love with me."</p>

  <p>"Well, maybe he is. And maybe you're infatuated with him. It certainly
  looks like it. But I'd hate to see you get tangled up with that mess. Thomas
  doesn't know whether his life's his own. Until the old lady is nice enough to
  die&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He has had an awfully hard life," defended Hannah.</p>

  <p>"Now, <i>hasn't</i> he!" scoffed Adele. "Lounging on the Riviera all
  winter and sprawling in the sun up here all summer like a lizard. However, it
  must have been a rough job, at that. Does he think he wants to marry
  you?"</p>

  <p>Hannah nodded, with averted eyes. "I couldn't now, of course. Not while
  Father lives."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's encouraging. Let's hope your father lives to be a hundred.
  Or you'll find yourself on the other side of the old gal's wheel-chair with
  about as much liberty as her little chow."</p>

  <p>"Do you think I would be much worse off than I am now?" asked Hannah. "It
  won't be very exciting for me just to sit there, in that little cottage, and
  knit&mdash;all the rest of my life." She was on the verge of tears, but Adele
  refused to be sympathetic.</p>

  <p>"No, that wouldn't be very exciting, Hannah, but at least you could knit
  when and what you wanted to, without asking permission of a vain old
  tyrant."</p>

  <p>Hannah had been quite right about Thomas's feeling towards her. He had
  been almost independent of his mother for the two whole afternoons and
  evenings before they parted. Adele, with heavy misgivings over this turn of
  affairs, was insisting that they return. Reluctantly, Hannah resumed her dull
  and thankless task. But Thomas, with nothing much else to do, enlivened her
  routine with letters, letters, and more letters. Seeing it was the only
  avocation he had, he pursued it in a manner that idealized and glorified him
  in the imagination of the lonely and love-starved Hannah.</p>

  <p>When the gusty, slanting, autumn rains began to splash the fading
  shrubbery, Adele one day impetuously decided to go back to Martin Moore, or
  back to Paris rather, which was putting it less unattractively, she said. Her
  final words to Hannah, who had accompanied her as far as the South Station,
  were:</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, dear, and please don't be a damned fool! There are too many of
  us now. One more would be crowding."</p>

  <p>In September, old Dan suffered another stroke and was gracious enough to
  everyone&mdash;including himself&mdash;to regard it as final. And to the
  utter amazement of all who had known him, Thomas Bradford&mdash;after a
  serious quarrel with his mother, who had gone a few steps too far, even for
  him, in making him feel a fool&mdash;wired Hannah to meet him in New York,
  where they were married, after which he defiantly led her into the old lady's
  sumptuous apartment and exhibited her with a truculent air of boastful
  disobedience on parade.</p>

  <p>"She even stopped payment on the cheque she had just given him for that
  month's allowance," said Hannah, when Lydia had inquired about their
  resources. "I had about five hundred dollars. Thomas had almost nothing but
  his clothes and golf-sticks."</p>

  <p>They thought it would be better to get quite out of hearing of the tempest
  that Mother Bradford had stirred up, leaving for Chicago, where Thomas
  thought he had some friends who might think of something he could do. The
  friends were mildly glad to see him until he stammered out the truth about
  his need.</p>

  <p>Unused to seeing how far a dollar could be spun out&mdash;never having
  earned one&mdash;Thomas quickly disposed of the little money they had. With
  his weak little show of self-reliance wasting to a mere glassy-eyed
  resignation, he wired to his mother, and she telegraphed him a ticket and
  instructions to come and see her&mdash;alone. He left Hannah nearly penniless
  in a shabby hotel room and obeyed his mother's command. She waited for three
  weeks, expecting word from him. It came, then, addressed from Reno. The
  letter was fourteen pages long, contrite, abject, disgustingly but very
  properly self-loathing. He had no other recourse, he said. He didn't know how
  to do anything. His mother would take him back only on condition that he get
  a divorce. Would Hannah understand the whole pitiful mess, and let him go
  free?</p>

  <p>Hannah did not protest, nor did she assert her rightful claims, though she
  had just confirmed her mounting fear that her problem was to be still further
  complicated.</p>

  <p>"It seemed to me, through those days," Hannah had confided, "that Philip
  was very near to me. No&mdash;I don't mean anything spooky. But the things
  Philip had said sounded in my ears as plainly as if he had just spoken
  them."</p>

  <p>"But Philip had not expected you to live by his queer theories," Lydia had
  reflected. "Surely you had a right to ask for your living expenses while you
  were having that baby. I think that was carrying things a bit too far."</p>

  <p>"Maybe so," Hannah conceded, "but it was a great satisfaction to feel that
  I was doing something Philip would have thought brave."</p>

  <p>At first it wasn't hard to find a good position as a maid, but the time
  came when they said they would have to let her go. They said they were sorry,
  and doubtless they were, Hannah thought. She couldn't blame them much.</p>

  <p>The doctor at the free clinic thought she would be better off at the
  University Hospital, and sent her down there. When it was all over and done
  with, she went out to meet the winter that had arrived in the meantime. Her
  clothing was insufficient. With the last few dollars she had left&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you tell me, dear?" Lydia had cried. "How gladly I would have
  done something about it if I had known."</p>

  <p>With the last of her small resources Hannah visited a near-by used-clothes
  shop and bought the only heavy coat they had. It was too big for her and she
  despised it. Seeing there was no pride left, she also bought the old plush
  hat. Sitting in the railway station to be protected from the cold, for her
  vitality was low, she studied the advertisements in the <i>Morning Star.</i>
  There was nothing but a chance to sell some little kitchen tool on
  commission....</p>

  <p>They were calling Lydia now, and rising from the swing she sauntered over
  to the far corner of the garden and joined them.</p>

  <p>"How are the rabbits?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Stuffed," said Hannah.</p>

  <p>"But <i>I'm</i> not!" piped Peter.</p>

  <p>"Very well, son," Lydia and Hannah exchanged smiles. "Mother will go in
  and see if dinner isn't nearly ready."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch06"
     id="ch06">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN his first blind fury over the ruinous telegram reporting
  the theft of his invention by the unscrupulous Ellises, Paul Ward went
  completely berserk. Absurdly miscast for so hectic an exhibition of emotional
  stampede, he was a shocking spectacle.</p>

  <p>All his previous disappointments had been accepted quietly. He had even
  been able to draw a tilted smile on these frequent occasions of failure,
  admitting that he hadn't counted much on the success of the thing anyway and
  would hope for better luck next time. With a seemingly boundless capacity for
  taking it on the chin, he had seen one scheme after another go the way of all
  their predecessors, and presently had bobbed up to invite Fate to rap him
  again.</p>

  <p>But now, with fortune and freedom practically in his pocket, the Ellis
  message from Pittsburgh had driven him into a rip-roaring frenzy that stunned
  and stilled everyone in the house&mdash;except little Sally, who, terrified
  by this incredible storm, wept inconsolably and threw up two chocolate bars
  and a maple nut sundae purchased out of the recently established weekly
  allowance of spending money which she had not yet attempted to budget.</p>

  <p>At the onset of Paul's purple rage, Marcia had ineffectively tried to do
  something about it, tagging him from room to room, dodging his eloquent
  gestures, and begging, "Please dear! Oh&mdash;please don't?" But when it
  became evident that he wasn't hearing or seeing her, she went to a window in
  the dining-room and turned her back on the sorry scene, the knuckles of both
  hands pressed hard against her ears. Roberta's slim, sallow face was pasty
  with horror. Wallie, who had imprudently ventured a soothing comment, stood
  straight and snug in a corner, wearing the blinking surprise of the
  unexpected slapped. Even Hannah, who thought she knew Paul Ward in all his
  moods, stared at this wild-eyed stranger in utter consternation. And when she
  heard him in the basement smashing to bits the machinery that was to have
  made him rich, she made no effort to dissuade him, though every crash of the
  hammer was as painful as if she herself had been struck.</p>

  <p>The racket subsided after a while, and then there was complete silence.
  Apparently the tempest had spent itself. Hannah decided to reconnoitre. In
  the living-room she paused to suggest to Wallie and Roberta that they had
  better go for a walk and come back in an hour.</p>

  <p>"And don't worry," she added, complacently. "Your father has had good
  reasons for being terribly upset. He'll be all right again soon."</p>

  <p>Tiptoeing upstairs, Hannah peeked through the partly open door and saw
  Marcia at full length on her bed, face down, with Sally cuddled close beside
  her. Quietly retracting her steps to the kitchen, she began the concoction of
  a pitcher of lemonade. At the door of the refrigerator she paused, meditated
  for a moment, shook her head slowly, and abandoned the lemonade project. She
  wasn't quite sure what was needed in this case, but obviously it wasn't
  anything involving ice.</p>

  <p>There was a bottle of brandy upstairs in the medicine cabinet. Hannah
  poured a liberal libation into a small glass and carried it down to the
  basement, her heart pounding hard. She didn't believe Paul would have gone to
  the length of destroying himself, but you couldn't tell what a person might
  do in such a fit of passion. It took quite a little courage to venture into
  the gloomy cubicle where she knew she would find him. He was sitting on the
  edge of the grimy workbench, slumped over in an attitude of hopeless
  dejection, his face white and drawn, his hands limply dangling. One of them
  had been hurt and was bleeding.</p>

  <p>Paul did not glance up when Hannah approached. She stepped towards him and
  silently held the brandy within range of his downcast eyes, but he made no
  move to accept it. Putting the glass down on the bench beside him, she went
  upstairs again, returning presently with a basin of warm water, a towel, a
  bottle of iodine, and the makings of a simple bandage. Paul had not
  stirred.</p>

  <p>He permitted her to take up the bloody hand and dully watched her sponge
  it. After a while he slowly raised his head and their serious eyes met in an
  exchange of unspoken inquiry. Paul's were suddenly suffused with tears, and
  Hannah bent energetically over her task, half-blinded by her own. She knew he
  would not thank her for any display of pity, but it was very difficult not to
  offer some tender proof of her feeling for him in this quite desperate
  emergency. With a brave show of casualness she proceeded very practically
  with the necessary repairs.</p>

  <p>When the bandage had been secured with adhesive tape, Hannah renewed her
  offer of the brandy, which her patient drank at one swallow. Gasping over the
  fiery dose, he restored the glass. Then their eyes met again, Hannah's moist,
  but holding the faintest suggestion of a gently reproving twinkle that
  matched the little pucker of her expressive lips. He had been&mdash;her look
  said&mdash;a very naughty boy, but she was definitely on his side and he
  could count on her, no matter how badly he behaved.</p>

  <p>Paul laid his good hand on her shoulder, tightening his fingers on it
  slightly as if to say that he appreciated her understanding of his need.
  Although she well knew the exact value of this grateful caress and accepted
  it for what it was worth, the warmth of his impulsive grasp raced Hannah's
  heart-beats for a moment. It meant a great deal to her, this spontaneous
  evidence of sincere friendship. She had long been aware of Paul's deep regard
  for her as a loyal employee who had been largely responsible for establishing
  the family's affairs on a sound basis. To-day she had been promoted to the
  rank of comrade. His hand on her shoulder, in this moment of grave emergency,
  had conferred the degree.</p>

  <p>Not a word had been spoken. It was ever so much better that way. She was
  glad he hadn't tried either to defend or deplore his conduct. And she was
  glad to have avoided the natural temptation to murmur some sympathetic
  platitude.</p>

  <p>Quietly gathering up the things she had brought, Hannah moved towards the
  doorway, and giving him a swift, reassuring, backward glance slowly groped
  her way up the dingy basement stairs, her eyes swimming with uncontrollable
  tears.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>It was two o'clock Wednesday afternoon. Mrs Ward hadn't wanted luncheon
  and was up in her room, probably in bed with her face buried in the pillows.
  The children were at school. Paul was downtown in conference with his
  attorney. He had restlessly roamed the house most of the night, and had eaten
  almost nothing. The prevailing gloom couldn't have been heavier if some
  member of the family lay dead in a coffin.</p>

  <p>Hannah was ironing. She could always think more clearly when she ironed,
  and there was much need for clear thinking in this house to-day. Besides, she
  always ironed on Wednesday. Reaching into the basket, she drew out Roberta's
  dimity and patted it smoothly on to the board. The simple little dress didn't
  seem to belong to Roberta. It was intended for an eight-year-old, which was,
  of course, Roberta's age: eight and a half; only she was ever so much older
  than that&mdash;older than Wallie, by far. Hannah had never known a child
  like her; reserved, almost as if she were a guest rather than a member of the
  household; serious when others smiled, smiling when others laughed, courteous
  but plainly annoyed over demonstrations of affection. Even as a mere tot of
  four, when taken up to be cuddled Roberta would submit to it only for an
  instant. "Too tight!" she would say, and wriggle out of the embrace.</p>

  <p>The only doll she had ever taken any interest in was a Chinese coolie with
  a pair of little baskets dependent from a shoulder-yoke. And it wasn't as if
  she was precocious. Roberta's marks in school weren't especially good, except
  in drawing; and even there the teacher's disapproval of her tendency to take
  liberties in copying the patterns was frequently recorded in red ink on the
  margins of her sketches.</p>

  <p>"I never saw a cat like that," Hannah had playfully remarked one day,
  glancing over the child's shoulder as she sat by the kitchen window, doubled
  over her drawing-board.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you?" mumbled Roberta absently, which was exactly the sort of
  reply you might expect. She wouldn't go to the bother of defending the cat.
  Nor would she have volunteered a criticism of your cat, had you been drawing
  one. Very odd child, elfish, remote. Mrs Ward had been baffled over her
  strange ways and, unable to think of anything better to do in the
  straightening out of Roberta's queer kinks, had dosed her with cod liver oil
  until the sulky little enigma fairly gagged at the bare mention of the nasty
  stuff.</p>

  <p>Hannah carefully hung up Roberta's dress on the rack and drew out of the
  basket a grey blouse of Wallie's, and if they weren't very careful they were
  going to spoil Wallie, which would be a pity; for he was a fine lad, so
  ridiculously like his father that his unconscious imitations of Paul's tricks
  of gesture and posture made you laugh. They were so much alike, indeed, that
  they didn't always get along very well. Doubtless that was because it got on
  to Paul's nerves sometimes to have this small mirror following him about,
  unintentionally grotesqueing the little pomposities which Paul could have
  done very nicely without. And whenever Mrs Ward wanted to dust off her
  husband a little, she attended to it by brushing Wallie, who would rise to
  his own defence by offering sound precedent for whatever he happened to have
  been doing, thus putting his father to the necessity of repudiating the
  flattery, which would hurt the boy's feelings so badly that he would leave
  the table, everyone wondering who had started the row, anyway. However, the
  tiffs never lasted very long. Wallie, like his father, had a short memory.
  Lovable boy. She wished he didn't have these awful colds. They frightened
  her.</p>

  <p>Hannah's mobile lips curved in a tender smile as she stretched Sally's
  little pyjama suit out on the padded board. It was natural, perhaps, that she
  loved Sally best of all, for Peter was almost of the same age, and Sally had
  been born when Hannah was desperately longing for her own baby. But that
  didn't quite explain all of her feeling for this child. Sally was going to be
  a beauty, and sweet as she was pretty. Hannah had some misgivings about
  Sally's undisguised affection for her, much as the little girl's ardent
  attentions warmed her heart. Home from school, Sally would come racing
  through the house shouting: "Hannah! Hannah&mdash;see what I did!
  Hannah&mdash;look what I've got!" If Sally fell down and bumped her knee, she
  ran to Hannah. If something happened to hurt her feelings, she told
  Hannah.</p>

  <p>"Better go and tell Mother, too, hadn't you?" Hannah would say, to ease
  her own conscience. And she could feel the round little gold head nodding
  obediently against her breast. But Hannah was always told first. Sometimes
  Sally would be so anxious to resume her play that she would leave her summer
  luncheon almost untasted. Her mother would insist. Sally would protest.</p>

  <p>"Hannah," Mrs Ward would say, "don't you think it would be better for
  Sally if she ate her rice?"</p>

  <p>So, really, Mrs Ward couldn't blame Hannah too much if Sally was more
  prompt to obey her than her mother. She had made an open bid for that
  dilemma&mdash;if it was a dilemma; Hannah often wondered if it might not turn
  out to be a dilemma, some day. Oh, well&mdash;you could deal with that when
  the time came. There were plenty of things, much more important than that, to
  fret about now.</p>

  <p>She picked up a dainty handkerchief edged with lace. How many times a day,
  this past half-dozen years, had Hannah said to herself that it really wasn't
  any of her business; that she hadn't the slightest right to judge her or
  criticize her, even in her own private thoughts. Mrs Ward&mdash;funny how she
  always thought of her as 'Mrs Ward', when Mr Ward was invariably 'Paul',
  probably because his wife spoke his name so frequently, while he usually
  called her 'Darling', or some other term of endearment&mdash;Mrs Ward was
  doing the very best she could. Now&mdash;let that settle it, once and for
  all! She's a sweet girl who never grew up, and if she isn't quite able to be
  of any help in a mess like this, it isn't her fault! Hannah took particular
  pains with the handkerchief. The lace was breaking a little, and she resolved
  to mend it. But&mdash;wasn't it too bad about yesterday's performance;
  utterly helpless, running up to her room to have a private cry when he needed
  something or somebody to lean against. Maybe he hadn't missed her. Maybe he
  had been so frantic over his calamity that he hadn't given a thought about
  her slipping away, shy and scared and ashamed, at the moment when she might
  have shown a little strength. Perhaps she was really afraid of him. If so,
  that was too bad, for it might have killed something in her that could never
  be revived. Perhaps she was as much disappointed as Paul over the loss of
  their promised fortune and had gone to bed lamenting it.</p>

  <p>But, no&mdash;Mrs Ward wouldn't be caring so much about that. She wasn't
  the least bit greedy for money. No&mdash;her concern was for Paul. But what a
  way to show it! She'd lose him if she wasn't careful. All she had was her
  girlish beauty, and she wasn't even going to have that if she didn't stop
  fretting herself into a state of swollen-eyed, tear-smeared, red-nosed
  dejection. She wasn't the type that could do that without damage. Florid,
  peaches-and-cream blondes weren't intended for long hauls of worry. If they
  missed a couple of meals and cried themselves to sleep for a night or two
  they did their looks more harm than an olive-skinned brunette would suffer by
  a month's continuous grilling. Adele Cooper had once delivered a few remarks
  on this subject, and Hannah had never forgotten them. Adele was always making
  up odd rules like that, stating them so convincingly that you almost had to
  believe her, even while you were thinking, "How silly!"</p>

  <p>Hannah tugged a shirt out of the basket. There were some brown blotches on
  the sleeves, stains made by chemicals. She hadn't been able to wash out the
  spots. But&mdash;no matter; it was an old working shirt, anyway. Perhaps he
  would never wear it again. And if he didn't pull himself together pretty soon
  he would get in wrong at the University. Two whole days now he had missed all
  of his classes; sent word he was sick. Well&mdash;that was nearly enough to
  the truth, counting from yesterday afternoon. Who would ever have thought of
  him going into such a violent tantrum!</p>

  <p>He had been waiting more than two weeks for word from that Mr Ellis. A
  couple of times he had phoned home between classes, asking Mrs Ward if there
  had been any news&mdash;wires or letters. And Mrs Ward would reply: "Sorry,
  Paul. Not a thing. You'll surely hear to-morrow." Then, more often than not,
  Mrs Ward would come on out to the kitchen and say, "Dear, dear&mdash;if he
  doesn't have some word from Mr Ellis very soon, I don't know what we're going
  to do with him."</p>

  <p>Paul had not talked to Hannah about it at all, which was strange. Not very
  much had happened in the course of his work on the new refrigerator that she
  hadn't known about. All but this unfortunate affair with Mr Ellis. The little
  she knew about this was what Mrs Ward had said. It was the morning after
  Hannah's customary day off. She had gone to Waterloo as usual to see Lydia
  and little Peter. Paul had been in gay spirits at breakfast. Something very
  important was in the air. When he had left the house, Mrs Ward had strolled
  out to the kitchen, bright-eyed and full of happy excitement.</p>

  <p>"Well, Hannah," she began, impressively and just a bit condescendingly,
  "it will not be long now. Mr Ellis&mdash;you know, the man who built the
  motor for Paul's invention&mdash;was here yesterday to see the machine in
  operation. His brother has a big manufacturing plant in Pittsburgh and is
  practically certain they will want to put Paul's refrigerator on the market.
  So our Mr Ellis is going at once to explain it all to his brother, and they
  can be making their plans for the promotion and production while Paul is
  doing the tedious business of securing the patent. That way they can save
  months of time, Mr Ellis says, and naturally Paul is anxious to get something
  out of it at the earliest possible moment."</p>

  <p>Of course. You wouldn't have expected anything else from Paul. Now that
  the machine had actually worked, the next move was to find a producer who
  would begin at once to turn them out by the thousand. Hannah had experienced
  her joy over the promptness of this offer, adding, as a cautious
  afterthought, "I suppose this Mr Ellis is reliable."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, indeed," Mrs Ward had replied confidently. "Paul says there
  isn't an abler mechanic this side of Chicago."</p>

  <p>"That wasn't quite what I meant," explained Hannah. "I was just wondering
  about his honesty."</p>

  <p>Mrs Ward had laughed, teasingly.</p>

  <p>"Fancy your raising that question, Hannah; you who believe in trusting
  everybody."</p>

  <p>And Hannah had said nothing more, except that she certainly hoped it would
  turn out happily. It had worried her more than a little, as the days passed.
  She hoped that her own beliefs hadn't influenced Paul to be inexcusably
  foolhardy. But not&mdash;Paul wouldn't have given her ideas on that matter an
  instant's thought. Nevertheless, Hannah had some serious moments, through
  those days of waiting, in which she re-examined her own philosophy and
  cross-questioned it earnestly. It would be a quite dreadful thing if Paul
  were to be disappointed now when the reward for all his hard work was in
  sight.</p>

  <p>That had been a wonderful day&mdash;that memorable Wednesday when the
  success of the machine was demonstrated for the first time. Paul had cut all
  of his classes on Tuesday and worked until far into the night. Hannah had
  taken a plate of scrambled eggs, bacon, and toast down to the basement at one
  o'clock. He had mumbled his thanks, but seemed anxious not to be bothered.
  Early in the forenoon he had started the motor and had come bounding upstairs
  with the expression of one who had seen a bright vision. Dragging up a chair
  to the open door of the refrigerator he had sat silently watching the coils.
  Hannah had held her breath. Something very important, she felt, was about to
  happen. The minutes ticked by. Presently Paul turned and glanced up at her
  over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Come here, Hannah," he had said huskily. "Touch that pipe! Do you know
  what that means? <i>I've done it!"</i></p>

  <p>"Wonderful!" she had murmured. "I'm so glad!"</p>

  <p>And then he had run out of the room to find Mrs Ward. She had come
  quickly. The three of them had gathered about the refrigerator, almost
  speechless with amazement and happiness. Paul had gone upstairs after a
  while, and hastily changed to his street clothes. With nothing but a cup of
  coffee for breakfast he had left the house, doubtless to go down to the
  Eureka Tool and Machine Company. And the next day Mr Ellis had come while
  Hannah was away.</p>

  <p>That had been a little over two weeks ago. When the noisy storm had broken
  over them yesterday, nobody had bothered to tell Hannah exactly what was in
  the devastating telegram, but she could guess. In Paul's frenzied raving, he
  had snarled out enough of it to explain it all.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes!" he growled, between clenched teeth. "They had been working on
  the same project&mdash;and were all ready to promote it! Like hell they had!
  I'll show them whether they'll steal it from me! By God&mdash;I'll let them
  see whether they can get away with it, the low-lived thieves! Wait till I get
  my finger-nails into the neck of that double-crossing, lying&mdash;" Hannah
  had tried not to hear the rest of it. She didn't like to know that Paul could
  use such vulgar phrases, even in this stress; sorry to learn that he had
  access to them.</p>

  <p>And to-day he was making plans to see Mr Ellis and Mr Ellis's rascally
  brother. He was downtown talking to a lawyer about it. He wouldn't stop to
  ask who was the best lawyer in town, but would plunge into the first office
  he came to and splutter his story. And the lawyer would take the case, of
  course. And the Pittsburgh Ellis, who would have a smarter lawyer, would win
  it. What a beastly shame! He had counted on it with so much confidence, and
  had worked so long, and hoped so bravely. But that was Paul's
  trouble&mdash;he couldn't wait; just had to see his invention on the market
  immediately, so the money would begin to flow in. He had begun spending it
  already. Mr Chalmers had driven them out to see the new house he was building
  on Edgewood Road, and Mrs Ward had been asked to make suggestions about the
  decorations.</p>

  <p>"I told him," Mrs Ward had remarked upon their return, "that we weren't
  sure yet about our ability to buy a home, and he said, 'But the house has to
  be decorated, anyway, and I'll trust your taste.'" She had taken a frightful
  cold out there in that unheated house. And now Wallie had it, too; had
  complained of a sore throat this morning. Hannah thought he was running a bit
  of a temperature and had advised against his going to school to-day, but
  there was to be a big rally this afternoon to encourage the basketball team
  for the Thanksgiving night game, and he mustn't miss it. If she could only
  persuade him to stay in bed for a day or two.</p>

  <p>Mr Chalmers had called up again this morning, but Hannah had said that
  neither Mr or Mrs Ward could come to the phone now. He wouldn't be quite so
  attentive&mdash;his voice had sounded so sugary&mdash;when he learned that
  the Wards had given up the idea of buying a house. Poor Paul. He not only
  wasn't going to have a new home; he was arranging matters so as to lose even
  the little savings deposit at the bank. The lawyer would want that&mdash;all
  that and a promissory note for more.</p>

  <p>They shouldn't have begun spending their fortune yet. How foolish of them
  to have encouraged the children to talk about a car. And the weekly
  allowance. Imagine!&mdash;little Sally! An allowance!</p>

  <p>Hannah drew a long sigh. She had five irresponsible children on her
  hands&mdash;not counting her own. She smiled complacently at the precious
  remembrance. At least, she didn't have to worry about dear little Peter.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Wallie was definitely sick to-night, and they were all anxious. Yesterday
  had been Thanksgiving Day, and he had been so keen on going to the game that
  he had kept himself up, stoutly denying that he felt badly. He was so hoarse
  he could hardly speak, but insisted he had "sprained" his voice by yelling so
  much at the rally. Hannah had suggested the clinical thermometer, to which he
  objected with such a noisy display of annoyance that she desisted, with many
  misgivings. Paul was sulky and remote seemingly taking no interest in
  anything, not even in Wallie's imprudence, and Mrs Ward was too bothered
  about Paul's mood to give full attention to any other worry; so the boy had
  gone to the game, returning at ten, fairly on fire with fever.</p>

  <p>Hannah had dosed him with hot drinks and the simple household remedies
  which he made a feint of resisting, probably because he still wanted to
  defend his decision to go to the game in the face of her urgent protest. When
  she went into his room to look at him about five o'clock, Hannah was
  frightened. Doctor Bowen came at eight and again at four. Mrs Ward wondered
  if they should have a nurse, and the doctor said they would see in the
  morning. Wallie would have to be watched carefully to-night. Hannah had sat
  in his room from ten to midnight, Mrs Ward relieving her then.</p>

  <p>It had been a trying day, and Hannah thought she would be the better for a
  cup of tea. In the kitchen she found Paul munching a snack of cheese and
  crackers.</p>

  <p>"How is he now?"</p>

  <p>"Asleep, but restless," Hannah said. "He's a sick boy."</p>

  <p>"You mean"&mdash;Paul's eyes widened with sudden
  apprehension&mdash;"you're seriously worried about him? Wallie has been
  through this again and again, you know."</p>

  <p>"We usually have been able to check it earlier. He kept going too long
  when he should have been in bed."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and part of that was my fault," growled Paul remorsefully. "I
  was too much occupied with my own troubles." He regarded her with contracted
  brows. "But where were you, Hannah? Why didn't you do something about it? You
  knew Mrs Ward and I were at our wits' end... didn't you?"</p>

  <p>Hannah nodded, but made no reply.</p>

  <p>"Don't you realize that I'm ruined?"</p>

  <p>"Well," replied Hannah thoughtfully, "I don't think you're ruined yet, but
  I'm awfully afraid you're planning on it."</p>

  <p>"Now just what does that mean?" he rasped.</p>

  <p>"You're arranging to fight back, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Still harping on that silly idea of yours, eh?"</p>

  <p>"We can easily change the subject," said Hannah gently. "I am sorry if I
  neglected Wallie. I did try my best to keep him in, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But what? Why weren't you firm with him?"</p>

  <p>Remembering the tension of Paul's nerves and the reasons he had for being
  irritable, Hannah ventured no response to this, though she thought of several
  things she might have said if she had felt it necessary to defend herself.
  Her failure to reply annoyed him.</p>

  <p>"I suppose your silence means that you are practising your sweet gospel of
  non-resistance again. I'd much rather you talked, even if you scolded. I hate
  sulking."</p>

  <p>Hannah poured two cups of tea. He drew his chair up to the table, and
  shakily fumbled in the sugar-bowl.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," he commanded gruffly. "I want to tell you about it; should
  have done so before. On the surface it looks as if we're demolished, but
  there's the ghost of a chance that we can bring these Ellis people to time. I
  talked to Barney Harrison about it. He has taken the case, and means to push
  it to the limit. I intend to fight 'em with every nickel I can raise!"</p>

  <p>Hannah drew a long sigh, and shook her head.</p>

  <p>"You think," snapped Paul, "I haven't a fighting chance?"</p>

  <p>"I think," replied Hannah, "you haven't a chance&mdash;fighting."</p>

  <p>"I suppose"&mdash;Pauls' tone was bitter&mdash;"I suppose you would just
  sit here and say nothing and let them defraud you... wouldn't you?" he added,
  challengingly, when the pause had lengthened.</p>

  <p>"No," said Hannah, without raising her eyes. "I wouldn't fight, but
  neither would I just sit here and do nothing about it. The choice of things
  one might do isn't quite that narrow. First, I should decide not to fight
  back. And then"&mdash;there was a long pause&mdash;"I would hope
  that&mdash;somehow&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"An angel from heaven would stroll in," assisted Paul, with elaborate
  mockery, "and hand you full directions for recovering your property by
  magic."</p>

  <p>Hannah smiled a little, the same smile he had often seen on her lips in
  acknowledgment of some babyish remark of Sally's. "That would be very
  pleasant," she agreed obligingly. "May I pour you another cup of tea?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I don't believe in magic," he muttered, pushing his cup
  towards her.</p>

  <p>"Nor do I. But it's a very convenient word to use when something happens
  that we can't understand. I suppose there are sound laws and rules for
  everything that occurs&mdash;or ever occurred."</p>

  <p>"Now that's much more sensible, Hannah," approved Paul, in a tone that
  tried to imitate her recent humouring of him as if he were a child. "I
  thought you believed in miracles, and all manner of hocus-pocus. So&mdash;you
  don't take any stock in angels, after all."</p>

  <p>"I never saw one," admitted Hannah. "Of course," she added prudently,
  "that does not mean there aren't any. I never saw mountains on the moon,
  either."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, I know; and you never saw any spots on the sun, though they are
  there and everybody knows it... but, seriously, you have something in the
  back of your head, Hannah, that you've been hinting at. No matter how foolish
  it is, I'll promise to listen."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I'll try to tell you some day, after you have tried everything
  else&mdash;if you ask me nicely."</p>

  <p>"Have I been so rude to you?"</p>

  <p>"What do <i>you</i> think?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry... I say, Hannah, tell me what's in your mind. What would you
  do if you were in my place?"</p>

  <p>"I would"&mdash;she was meditative for a long minute, her eyes averted,
  her full lips puckered with indecision&mdash;"I would drink that cup of tea
  while it is still hot, and go to bed, and try to get a couple of hours'
  sleep. You might relieve Mrs Ward about two o'clock. No use of everybody's
  sitting up."</p>

  <p>"How about you?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not sleepy."</p>

  <p>"Hannah, forgive me for being snappish with you. I've hardly been myself
  for days." He pushed back his chair and rose.</p>

  <p>"I think I had noticed that," she said, amiably enough.</p>

  <p>Paul paused in the doorway, not quite satisfied with the close of their
  conversation.</p>

  <p>"You're a deep one, Hannah," he drawled. "I'd give a great deal of money
  to examine the inside of your head."</p>

  <p>Hannah was facing the porcelain sink, pouring hot water over the tea
  dishes, and without turning replied, "You'll not have any money to spend on
  things that are only to be looked at&mdash;and not used. Your Mr Harrison
  will be wanting your money."</p>

  <p>Paul made no reply, but continued to wait in the doorway. Suddenly
  penitent over having nagged him when he was wretched with worry, Hannah
  glanced towards him and added gently: "But I'll be thinking about you, Mr
  Ward. And if there's any way I can help, I'll do it."</p>

  <p>"I know that, Hannah," he said warmly. "I had hoped we might soon be in a
  position to show you how much we have valued your service&mdash;and your
  loyalty. I intended to do something for you."</p>

  <p>She allowed a whole minute to pass before she said quietly,
  "Money&mdash;you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and freedom from hard work."</p>

  <p>Hannah faced him now with serious eyes.</p>

  <p>"I haven't minded the work, Mr Ward. And I'm not particularly anxious to
  have more money. But I do very much want us all to be happy, and I'm
  afraid&mdash;I'm afraid we aren't going to be. The track we seem to be on now
  doesn't point in that direction."</p>

  <p>Paul made an impatient gesture with a flick of his fingers.</p>

  <p>"If you think you have a better plan than mine for seeing us out of this
  mess, why not tell me what it is?"</p>

  <p>Leaning back against the edge of the sink, Hannah folded her arms and
  stared at the floor with studious eyes. Presently she raised her head and
  with parted lips waited for the right words to organize themselves.</p>

  <p>"It isn't a bit easy to talk about," she began hesitatingly. "It's
  something that has to be built up gradually by trying it out and thinking it
  over. I am sure you couldn't get anywhere with it unless you had some reason
  for believing and hoping it might succeed. I'm afraid it would sound very
  foolish to anyone who hadn't experimented with it, at least a little."
  Hannah's low voice carried a note of entreaty as she continued, still groping
  for her words.</p>

  <p>"Let me try to tell you what I mean, Mr Ward. If&mdash;if some person, a
  few years ago, had ordered you to build a refrigerator that made its own ice,
  and had wanted it delivered at his house within a month, you would have
  laughed at him. Your invention didn't come that way. I wonder how many hours
  and miles you tramped back and forth, back and forth, down in that little
  room in our basement, trying to figure this thing out. And how many times you
  gave it all up and quit, disgusted. And then went at it again because
  something kept telling you that it was not impossible.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;here is another job for you. If anyone tried to tell you what
  results you might expect from it when it is finished, you would probably
  laugh. But if you thought seriously about it for a while, and made a few
  experiments, it might not seem so silly." She walked slowly towards the
  doorway, where he stood listening with a patient but not very encouraging
  smile. "Would you be willing to make a little adventure?" she asked
  earnestly.</p>

  <p>"Blindfolded?"</p>

  <p>"Something almost like that," admitted Hannah. "I'll tell you what you
  want to know, but first you must invest a little interest in it, or it will
  seem ridiculous. If you will go downtown in the morning and inform Mr
  Harrison not to do anything more about the suit against Mr Ellis until he
  hears from you further&mdash;<i>I'll tell you!"</i></p>

  <p>"Perhaps you'd better tell me first, and if it's a good idea I can easily
  stop Harrison."</p>

  <p>Hannah shook her head obdurately.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;if you haven't enough confidence in me to do that much in
  advance, my idea wouldn't seem worth bothering about. This will be no easy
  thing to do, I can tell you, even if you believed in it with all your
  heart."</p>

  <p>Paul shifted his position uneasily and lighted a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"You're making all this sound dreadfully mysterious, Hannah... I think we
  had better understand each other. If I am expected to do some preliminary
  spade-work, preparatory to a grand display of faith, you're&mdash;you're
  putting your money on the wrong horse," he finished lamely, aware that he
  would have laughed over such a sentence if a student had executed it in an
  essay.</p>

  <p>"We'll just forget it, then," said Hannah quietly. "I'll call you about
  two o'clock." She turned and went back to her dishes. Paul remained standing
  there for a while; then with a long sigh of fatigue and perplexity he moved
  off through the dining-room, tarried uncertainly for some minutes in the
  living-room, and slowly mounted the stairs.</p>

  <p>Hannah listened attentively to his receding footsteps and tried to
  interpret them. She had hoped, when they hesitated, that Paul might return
  and say: "Very well then. I'll try it." Perhaps she should have reminded him
  of the occasions when he had accepted her "hunches"&mdash;as he called
  them&mdash;and had found them useful. Maybe Paul would think of that
  himself.</p>

  <p>But suppose she did contrive to win his consent to make the adventure. It
  would be risky business. She had never tried out her theory on anything so
  important as this. What if Paul experimented with it&mdash;just to humour
  her&mdash;and failed?</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Doctor Bowen had arrived in the morning as Roberta and Sally were leaving
  for school. After five minutes upstairs he had telephoned for a nurse, who
  came very soon in a taxi. Hannah, who had been anxiously on the alert,
  admitted her before she had a chance to ring.</p>

  <p>"Gregory," barked the nurse, handing Hannah her suitcase. She was forty,
  tall, lean, grim, and businesslike.</p>

  <p>Hannah led the way to her own room and Miss Gregory began changing into
  her uniform, indicating by the careful timing of a sniff and a shrug that she
  disliked the idea of sharing the maid's quarters, even briefly. Promptly
  aware that nothing was wanted of her but her departure, Hannah went quietly
  downstairs and tried to busy herself with the usual morning's work. Her hands
  trembled.</p>

  <p>Presently Paul came through, attended to the furnace, and said, "I'm going
  down to a pharmacy to have some prescriptions filled."</p>

  <p>"How is he?" asked Hannah, trying to steady her voice. Paul did not reply.
  She followed him to the hall door and held his overcoat. He avoided her eyes.
  She softly closed the door behind him and watched his uneven, half-shuffling
  steps as he hurried jerkily towards the corner where he would take the
  street-car.</p>

  <p>Mrs Ward came down for a spoon. She had been crying. Hannah saw that she
  did not wish to be queried.</p>

  <p>Then Doctor Bowen drove away, returning in a half-hour with another
  doctor. Miss Gregory came down with a handful of instruments and boiled them
  in a pan. Unable any longer to restrain her anxiety, Hannah asked, in a
  half-whisper, "Is it pneumonia?"</p>

  <p>Without turning, Miss Gregory replied crisply, "Doctor Bowen will probably
  tell Mr and Mrs Ward whatever he thinks they ought to know about the
  case."</p>

  <p>So&mdash;that was that, and now we knew exactly where we stood. Hannah
  felt a moment's resentment, but after a while she thought differently about
  Miss Gregory's surliness. The nurse wasn't here to express her own opinions,
  certainly not to an inquisitive maid-of-all-work who might try to be chummy
  unless promptly squelched. And Miss Gregory couldn't be expected to know the
  peculiar relation which this one maid sustained to the family. Of course,
  reflected Hannah, it could have been done a little less unkindly. Miss
  Gregory probably had no personal sentiments about face-saving. Or, perhaps
  she had lost face herself, and was hoping to get it back by making other
  people lose theirs.</p>

  <p>Miss Gregory called for a towel, and supporting the hot pan in it she left
  the kitchen, intent on her occupation and without a backward glance. After a
  while Doctor Bowen left, but the younger doctor remained. Miss Gregory came
  down then and said: "I want a cup of strong coffee, a poached egg, and a
  piece of toast." Hannah complied quickly, laying a place at the dining-table
  while the coffee was brewing.</p>

  <p>"Never mind&mdash;I'll have it right here in the
  kitchen&mdash;standing."</p>

  <p>Hannah hoped Miss Gregory was as competent as she was impolite. Too bad
  that poor little Wallie had to be nursed by a person with such bad manners,
  though he probably wouldn't notice, at least not to-day. She poured the
  coffee and arranged the other things on the porcelain table.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Miss Gregory.</p>

  <p>Mrs Ward came into the kitchen.</p>

  <p>"Having lunch?" she asked, a bit annoyed.</p>

  <p>"Breakfast," replied Miss Gregory.</p>

  <p>"Oh. You didn't have your breakfast?"</p>

  <p>"There wasn't time. I was just going off night duty when Doctor Bowen
  called, and&mdash;there wasn't time."</p>

  <p>Hannah brightened a little. Miss Gregory had good reasons for being
  snappish. She was worn out. Perhaps she was a decent sort when properly
  treated. Stepping to the range after Mrs Ward had left the room, Hannah said
  companionably: "I'm going to fix you another egg. It will be ready in a
  minute."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," replied Miss Gregory, slightly thawed.</p>

  <p>"Too bad you had to go so long without your coffee." Hannah's tone was
  genuinely sympathetic.</p>

  <p>Miss Gregory nodded.</p>

  <p>"Too bad for you, too," she remarked dryly. "I'm mean as hell when I'm
  tired and hungry."</p>

  <p>Hannah regarded her with one of the puckery little smiles which she often
  employed in condoning the small blunders of the children, and Miss Gregory,
  glancing up, interpreted it.</p>

  <p>"What's your name?" she asked, with a brief grin.</p>

  <p>"Hannah."</p>

  <p>"Is that all?"</p>

  <p>"Usually."</p>

  <p>Miss Gregory's grin broadened a little.</p>

  <p>"Been here long?"</p>

  <p>"Since Wallie was about four."</p>

  <p>"Well, in that case you have a right to know that he is a very very sick
  boy. It looks bad. We're going to know more about it before to-morrow
  morning, I think. Doctor Rogers gave him a serum. We can't do much but
  wait."</p>

  <p>"Thanks for telling me," murmured Hannah, rubbing away the tears.</p>

  <p>"There's another nurse relieving me presently. Where do I sleep? I must
  have some rest&mdash;if I'm to be of any use to-night."</p>

  <p>"You're not going away, then?" Hannah's voice carried so much spontaneous
  gratitude that Miss Gregory sensed it.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I am going to see it through."</p>

  <p>"May I make up my bed for you? It's really all we have to offer."</p>

  <p>"Please. You look tired too, Hannah. How long since you slept?"</p>

  <p>"I'm quite all right, Miss Gregory." Hannah tried to prove it by
  straightening her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Don't want any pity, eh?" Then, after a pause, "Are you somehow related
  to&mdash;to these people?"</p>

  <p>Hannah shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Just the maid?" pursued Miss Gregory.</p>

  <p>"That's all."</p>

  <p>Regarding Hannah for a moment with studious interest, and seeming about to
  venture a comment which, on second thoughts, she vetoed, Miss Gregory
  stretched her arms to full length, gave way to an undisguised yawn, smiled,
  shook her head slowly, and murmured a mystified little
  "Humm-humm&mdash;humm," deep in her throat, inflected as if she were saying,
  "Funny world".</p>

  <p>Hannah had carefully tiptoed up and down the stairs a half dozen times
  between ten and eleven, but because there was nothing she could do she had
  resolved to remain in the kitchen now and try to be patient. The long strain
  was beginning to tell on her strength. Her heart-beats bumped in her dry
  throat.</p>

  <p>Doctor Bowen was in with Wallie, and Miss Gregory too. Paul and Mrs Ward
  were in their own room with the door ajar. Doubtless the doctor had advised
  them to remain outside the sick room. Roberta, pale and frightened but
  composed, had consented to go to bed. Sally had sobbed herself to sleep at
  nine. The ominous sound of Wallie's laboured breathing tugged at Hannah's
  chest and made her draw long, deep breaths in his behalf. Occasionally there
  was a little stir upstairs&mdash;the tinkle of ice in a glass, the moving of
  a chair, the creak of a door-hinge; but mostly it was quiet&mdash;except for
  Wallie's mounting battle with the Thing. His disease had taken on something
  like personality, in Hannah's overwrought mind. The Thing had Wallie by the
  throat and was trying to strangle him. You wanted to rush in to the room and
  tug the Thing's talons out of the slim, throbbing neck. Hannah clenched her
  agitated hands into white-knuckled fists, closed her eyes tightly, and tried
  to endure.</p>

  <p>A little before midnight Paul came down. Hannah recognized his steps on
  the stairs and met him in the kitchen doorway. He had eaten nothing all day
  but a brief breakfast of coffee and toast, and looked indescribably fagged.
  When he spoke, the words came wearily, woodenly.</p>

  <p>"The doctor gave Mrs Ward a sedative and she's having a little sleep... I
  don't see how my boy can stand this strain much longer. His heart, you
  know."</p>

  <p>Hannah could not trust herself to offer any comment. Lighting the gas in
  the range, she began to prepare a lunch for him.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps Dr. Bowen and Miss Gregory would like something to eat, too," she
  said.</p>

  <p>Paul shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I asked them and they said 'No&mdash;not now'." He took Hannah's chair at
  the kitchen table and sat in silence while she went about her task.
  Presently, as she stood waiting for the coffee, he faced her with an odd
  expression as if he had something to say that required resolution.</p>

  <p>"Hannah&mdash;" Paul's voice sounded remote and spent but the tone
  predicted an important announcement. "Hannah&mdash;I have been doing a great
  deal of thinking to-night... emergency thinking... I've never taken much
  interest in the idea that the things we do and the things we believe
  can&mdash;influence, in any way, whatever powers there may be&mdash;outside
  and beyond ourselves... and I'm not sure, even now, that I have any faith to
  offer. My mind is upset, and I know I'm not using it according to its habits.
  But so many people have believed&mdash;and do believe. I've been groping
  about to see if I could do it too. I have even tried to pray&mdash;but it has
  seemed an awfully caddish thing for me to do."</p>

  <p>"Not when you were doing it for Wallie," suggested Hannah softly. "You
  weren't asking anything for yourself."</p>

  <p>"Of course I was," he contradicted. "I want my boy to live&mdash;more than
  I want to live myself... but I couldn't pray. Not with the slightest hope
  that anything might come of it... And then it occurred to me that I might at
  least <i>do</i> something... So&mdash;I have decided, Hannah, that if Wallie
  gets well I'll drop the whole business of suing the Ellises... That's a
  definite <i>promise!"</i></p>

  <p>Hannah's eyes widened with an apprehension that was almost terror.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" she pleaded, "you mustn't do that!" She stepped towards him and
  clutched his shoulder. "Oh, Paul, please don't say that again!" Her words
  tumbled over each other breathlessly. "I'm so afraid! Oh&mdash;don't do that!
  You mustn't! It's dangerous! We might lose him!"</p>

  <p>As she stood there shaken with convulsive sobs, Paul stared up at her with
  an expression of utter amazement. He rose, and tugging her hands from her
  eyes, muttered, "What do you mean? What have I done? Tell me!"</p>

  <p>Hannah made a brave effort to recover her composure.</p>

  <p>"Do you think They would let you drive a bargain with Them?" she said,
  huskily.</p>

  <p>"They?" echoed Paul.</p>

  <p>Hannah made a little gesture of impatience.</p>

  <p>"They&mdash;or He&mdash;or It&mdash;or Whoever. I don't know anything
  about it&mdash;except&mdash;I know you mustn't trifle with Them! Risky
  business!"</p>

  <p>She was a new Hannah, with whom Paul had had no previous acquaintance. He
  had never seen her stirred before. Her hands were trembling and her harassed
  eyes looked suddenly old&mdash;in years, experience, prescience.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;Hannah!" he asked, perplexed. "Isn't that what you have been
  wanting me to do?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes&mdash;but not <i>that way!</i> You mustn't try to bring your
  offering <i>to market!...</i> If you want to make this adventure you will
  have to come the whole way with it!"</p>

  <p>"Meaning&mdash;I'll not sue&mdash;no matter what happens to Wallie?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly that! <i>Say it! Swear it</i>!" Hannah reached out her hand.
  There was a long moment of waiting.</p>

  <p>"Very well, Hannah," said Paul, steadying his voice. "I give you my hand
  on it. If anybody knows about these things, I believe you do. I promise.
  Whatever may happen to my boy&mdash;I'll do nothing more to get my property
  back from the Ellises."</p>

  <p>She searched his face with shining eyes.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad," she whispered, clinging to his hand.</p>

  <p>"You honestly believe in this&mdash;<i>don't</i> you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"I wish I could&mdash;as you do."</p>

  <p>Hannah's forehead lined with perplexity, and a moment passed before she
  replied.</p>

  <p>"I don't think that matters so much. You might have had plenty of belief
  that didn't cost you anything. But now you have pledged yourself to something
  that may cost you thousands. You might have fought this Mr Ellis and won the
  case. And you might have filled your pockets with money. You have given that
  up. Why shouldn't They respect what you have done?... But how are you going
  to feel"&mdash;she hesitated, her questing eyes searching his at close
  range&mdash;"and how are you going to act&mdash;<i>if They don't?"</i></p>

  <p>"I'll try not to complain, Hannah, and I intend to keep my word...
  Honestly&mdash;do you think They will let us keep Wallie?"</p>

  <p>She closed her tired eyes, unable to meet his challenge with the kind of
  assurance he sought. What had she done to her friend? Out of her agony and
  wistfulness she had suggested the surrender of his only hope to salvage a
  long-cherished dream. And who was she&mdash;old Dan Parmalee's daughter,
  maid-of-all-work, with almost no education&mdash;who was she to be committing
  a university professor to a test that might fail? What right had she to be
  talking so confidently about what They might do? What did she know about the
  mysterious ways of Them&mdash;or Him&mdash;or Whoever-it-is? She didn't even
  go to church on Sundays.</p>

  <p>"I hope so, Paul," she said earnestly. "But I do not know."</p>

  <p>He turned away and went back to his post of waiting. Hannah sank into the
  chair and listened to his footsteps ascending the stairs, wondering whether
  it was merely her own imagination that made them sound like the steady stride
  of a hopeful spirit. The echoes of the strange conversation lingered...
  Well&mdash;it was now up to Them! How would They feel about this unusual
  transaction? So far as this present adventure was concerned, it wouldn't make
  much difference how Paul felt about it. The question was: What would
  <i>They</i> think?</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The talk with Hannah had done something with him. The new sensation was
  difficult to define. Of course, he reflected, at a time like this one's mind
  could be expected to cut some queer capers. You couldn't subject yourself to
  the neural strains and drains of the past few days and expect to remain
  normal. He had been ploughed and harrowed in all directions, up and down and
  crisscross. He sat in Marcia's boudoir chair and gazed out into the night,
  amazed that the darkness did not depress him.</p>

  <p>This strange feeling of calmness was probably an hallucination. Hannah's
  faith had acted hypnotically on him at a moment when he was too far spent,
  neurally, to offer any resistance or point out any of the fallacies in her
  philosophy. But the most remarkable phenomenon of this curious emotional
  experience was the sheet fact that he found it comforting. His mind had been
  in a tumult. Now it was at peace. And the "peace" was not the mere inertia
  and indifference of exhaustion: rather was it in the nature of a dynamic, a
  stimulant! It wasn't as if he had simply lost his spirit of stormy revolt
  against a sinister Fate that had robbed him of his right to a fortune and was
  now burning up his child. It wasn't a mere surrender. No&mdash;it was a
  <i>positive</i> thing! This new sensation seemed to have been produced not by
  the letting go of anything but by the laying hold on something! The
  inexplicable "peace"&mdash;if that was the word&mdash;was not in the nature
  of a resignation: it was an <i>accretion!</i> Not an abdication, but an
  <i>accession!</i></p>

  <p>From the moment he had given Hannah the promise, this peculiar experience
  had begun to operate. The fiddle-string tension of his nerves had relaxed.
  The sense of foreboding and fear and dejection had been put to rest as if by
  some benign narcotic.</p>

  <p>For a little while he tried to analyse his mood; but he soon discovered
  that he was content to accept the new "peace" on its own terms without
  examining it too closely, fearing he might rationalize it away.</p>

  <p>As he passed the open door of Wallie's room, the sickish feeling of fear
  that had come to him when, an hour ago, he had looked in on the flushed
  swollen, almost unrecognizable face of his boy, did not recur.</p>

  <p>Marcia was still asleep. He sat quietly in the low chair by the window.
  Doubtless this feeling would pass presently. It had arisen out of
  extraordinary circumstances and when the immediate problem had been
  solved&mdash;one way or the other&mdash;he might expect this remarkable
  experience to come to an end, perhaps never to be recaptured.</p>

  <p>Some day, a month from now, he might resume his passionate wish for the
  retrieve of the fortune he had lost. At the moment, the loss was of no
  consequence at all. Doubtless he would again find himself hating and
  despising the Ellises with a contempt that embittered his very food, but he
  did not hate them now. It was a relief to ease this strain and unload this
  burden. He had not realized what an amount of energy had been required to
  sustain that galling weight.</p>

  <p>It would pass, of course. It was a mere phantom. But for the hour it
  offered a healing for his spirit.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>At three o'clock Miss Gregory came down. Hannah, who had been sound asleep
  with her head on her arms, roused at the sound of the competent steps.
  Something in the Gregory manner speeded Hannah's pulse. She glanced up
  inquiringly.</p>

  <p>"He's&mdash;he's a little better?" she asked, entreaty in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"By God&mdash;the boy may put it over. He's perspiring." Miss Gregory
  dragged the kettle over the gas-flame and signalled Hannah not to rise.
  "Now&mdash;don't get me wrong," she cautioned, suddenly blunt. "Wallie has a
  chance&mdash;that's all. He is a stout young fellow. It's a good pump he has.
  Maybe it will pull him through. That&mdash;and the serum. He seems to be
  responding to the serum."</p>

  <p>Hannah stared up at her with parted lips and wide eyes swimming with
  tears. A mysterious smile slowly lighted her face.</p>

  <p>"Serum?" she repeated, hardly above a whisper.</p>

  <p>"The antitoxin. It works about once in a blue moon. Where do you keep the
  coffee?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch07"
     id="ch07">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">CHRISTMAS was more tender than merry. Wallie's convalescence
  had proceeded slowly. For a full week after the acute crisis of his pneumonia
  had been reached, his recovery was still in doubt. Paul went to no classes.
  The doctor came twice a day. Miss Gregory was constantly on the alert. The
  family moved about softly, silently, haggard with worry.</p>

  <p>It was a great day when Doctor Bowen said Wallie might sit up for a while,
  and a greater one when his father carried him downstairs and carefully
  deposited him in a big leather chair by the grate, where they all clustered
  about him with a wide-eyed devotion that made him grin self-consciously.
  Embarrassed, the boy broke the silence by swallowing noisily, deep in his
  thin, white neck, and saying in a weak voice, "Well&mdash;here we all are,"
  which made them laugh through their tears. Hannah promptly retired to the
  kitchen, followed by Miss Gregory. Sally went also, returning presently with
  a hot doughnut generously sprinkled with powdered sugar. She put it in
  Wallie's bony hand.</p>

  <p>"Of all things, Sally!" said their mother gently. "A doughnut&mdash;for a
  sick man!"</p>

  <p>"You ought to see your face," giggled Wallie, pointing a shaky finger.
  Then they all laughed at Sally, with powdered sugar on her plump cheeks, her
  round chin, and the tip of her nose. Even Roberta laughed, and detaching
  herself from the group wound up the gramophone for some Christmas hymns and
  carols. And when Trinity Choir sang <i>Unto Us a Son is Given,</i> Marcia,
  deeply moved, groped for Paul's hand.</p>

  <p>A little later in the kitchen she said to Hannah, who was cutting out
  cookies in shapes of stars and trees and angels, "We could very well get
  along without any other Christmas gifts this year, now that Wallie is safe."
  And Hannah rather wished they might all feel that way about it, for expenses
  had been high and it would be difficult to meet their current bills in full,
  even if no more money was spent for presents.</p>

  <p>But Paul seemed to think that Wallie's recovery deserved a special
  celebration. The child had been through a harrowing experience, and this
  Christmas should be made a joyful occasion for him. If it cost a little more
  than they might have spent under normal circumstances, so be it. It was no
  time to count nickels.</p>

  <p>And if Wallie was to have nice presents, the others should have them too.
  Indeed, they all merited gifts, after the long strain they had endured. It
  had been a frightful milling, reiterated Paul, and they were going to make
  something of Christmas this time, and the expenses, he continued, could be
  damned. All this to Hannah, on the day Wallie sat up for the first time. She
  hadn't the courage to caution him, and promptly surprised both Paul and
  herself by conceding the point, adding, however, that she wished the expenses
  could realize that they were damned, to which he laughingly replied that she
  was priceless. She then gave him one of those half-teasing, puckery smiles
  which always left him guessing what retort she had resolved not to make.
  "It's a good thing I am priceless," thought Hannah, "if we are to have a
  grand spree of spending."</p>

  <p>"I've got Wallie the best bicycle to be had in town," said Paul.</p>

  <p>"He'll love that," Hannah heard herself saying. "I hope it will be an
  early spring, so he won't have to wait too long to enjoy it."</p>

  <p>"You know, Hannah"&mdash;Paul's face was perplexed&mdash;"I hadn't thought
  of that. However"&mdash;he brightened quickly&mdash;"he'll have fun owning
  it&mdash;and it will be something to look forward to."</p>

  <p>Hannah nodded. "Just like the doll perambulator," she observed.</p>

  <p>"It's a wonder I didn't think of that," regretted Paul. "But Sally can
  play with the doll, at least. It's quite a novelty, you know."</p>

  <p>And so it was. It was a talking doll. Paul had made a great event of
  showing it to Mrs Ward and Hannah. He had stored it in the attic. Hannah
  thought she knew why he had asked them to view it together. Mrs Ward had not
  been consulted about these expensive gifts for the children; had had no part
  in selecting them. Hannah knew exactly how it had come about. Paul had been
  downtown on an errand the day Wallie had sat up for the first time. Beside
  himself with joy and relief, he had impulsively decided on a noteworthy
  Christmas celebration. Of course it would have to be arranged for at once, on
  the spot, without a moment's further consideration. It wouldn't occur to him
  until afterward that this was a selfish, childish, silly thing to do. Anyone
  else in the whole wide world, reflected Hannah, would have paused to wonder
  if these extravagant gifts might not make Mrs Ward's discreet purchases for
  the children seem cheap and beggarly by comparison. Now that Paul had done
  it, perhaps he was a little bit ashamed.</p>

  <p>So that was why, with much hush-hushing, he had tiptoed Mrs Ward and
  Hannah to the attic, after the children were in bed, to see the talking doll
  in a perambulator, big and sturdy enough for a live baby. He knew Hannah
  wouldn't chide him for the expense&mdash;not when the three of them were
  together. And he knew Mrs Ward wouldn't be able to inquire, in Hannah's
  presence, why he hadn't asked his wife to lend a hand in this adventure.</p>

  <p>They shivered in the cold, exhaling spouts of steam, while he unwrapped
  the bulky parcel. They looked and listened. In an impassive face, the doll's
  mouth gasped like an expiring fish, and from somewhere in its abdomen a
  series of mechanical squawks was audible. By the use of a little imagination,
  one suspected that the doll said "Papa&mdash;Mamma&mdash;Baby".</p>

  <p>"She hasn't been talking long," Paul observed wittily, when the silence
  had begun to pile up.</p>

  <p>Hannah was so full of unrelieved laughter that her sides ached. She
  couldn't risk opening her mouth to offer a comment, and hoped Mrs Ward would
  have something to say very soon, which she did.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;she hasn't a very wide vocabulary, has she?"</p>

  <p>To this crisp observation Paul replied defensively that he thought the
  doll did very well to be able to talk at all. Then they looked at the
  expensive outfit of artists' supplies which were to be Roberta's, and Mrs
  Ward remarked that a professional portrait painter would be happy to have it.
  It was too cold to linger very long, so they clattered down the narrow attic
  stairs, and by the time they were on the first floor Mrs Ward had resumed her
  good nature. Hannah was glad. You had to forgive this fellow. After all, he
  was a grand person, if you knew how to take him. Mrs Ward was behaving very
  well, Hannah thought, especially when she remarked that the paints and
  brushes would be quite an inspiration to Roberta.</p>

  <p>After she had returned to her room, Paul came out to the kitchen with a
  beautifully ornamented round box and said it was the gift he had bought for
  Mrs Ward. Hannah was afraid it was a hat, at first, but it turned out to be a
  dozen Cauldon service plates.</p>

  <p>"Worth twelve dollars apiece," said Paul impressively. "Had them for eight
  because Bowker's was a bit overstocked. The man said they were really an
  extraordinary buy."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Hannah, "I think that too."</p>

  <p>Paul beamed on her appreciatively. "Beautiful, aren't they?" he
  demanded.</p>

  <p>"Exquisite!" breathed Hannah.</p>

  <p>He had never heard her use the word before, and admiration shone in his
  eyes, maybe because she had pronounced it correctly. He didn't think much of
  the mentality of women who said "ex<i>quis</i>ite". He always told the
  freshmen, early in the year, that a woman who would say "ex<i>quis</i>ite"
  always had an untidy mind, and was likely to begin every other paragraph with
  "Well&mdash;anyway".</p>

  <p>"You think she will like them?" insisted Paul, more confidently.</p>

  <p>"Of course. Why not? They're lovely."</p>

  <p>After a moment more of silent admiration, Paul carefully stowed the plates
  in the silk-lined box. Drawing out his worn wallet, he extracted two tens and
  a five. Hannah could not help noticing that it left the pocket-book flat.</p>

  <p>"For you," he said gently. "I wish it was more."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Mr Ward. You are all very kind to me." Hannah's voice was
  tender. She looked up into his eyes and smiled. He returned the smile, and
  then they shook hands, wondering a little why they were doing so. Upon the
  bestowal of gifts, in the Ward household, it was customary for the
  beneficiary to kiss the donor. Maybe that was why they were shaking hands,
  Hannah thought. She could have kissed him, she knew, without affecting their
  relation the least bit; but perhaps it was better to shake hands. On second
  thoughts, it was ever so much better.</p>

  <p>"We are all going to have a merry Christmas, aren't we?" she said,
  slipping the money into her apron pocket. He nodded, and made quite a
  ceremony over the lighting of a cigarette. Hannah poured him a glass of milk
  and cut a slice of cake. There would be an after-Christmas sale of canned
  vegetables at the stores. One could do a great deal with twenty-five dollars.
  It would relieve the strain of the next monthly statements.</p>

  <p>"Funny thing," said Paul, putting down the empty glass, "I never felt just
  this way about Christmas before. The spirit of it, you know. I feel as if I
  knew what it is all about, this time. It's Wallie, of course. But the
  goodwill part of it&mdash;that never struck me so forcibly. Peace and
  goodwill toward men&mdash;and all that sort of thing. I don't even despise
  the Ellisses."</p>

  <p>"You know why, don't you?" said Hannah gently.</p>

  <p>"Well, I know what you're thinking, of course. I promised not to fight
  them. But that didn't mean I was going to stop hating them. Just now it
  doesn't seem to matter much. I can't quite understand my own feelings, though
  I've tried to analyse them. Some of the factors to the problem are clear
  enough. The emotional part of it is simple: Wallie's recovery. My home has
  suddenly become the most important fact in the world. And that's not hard to
  see through. I was defeated on the outside, and have been driven back. I'm in
  the position of the prodigal who, having lost his fortune, hurried home and
  found it a more interesting institution than it ever was before.</p>

  <p>"You know, Hannah," he went on, choosing his words with a view to their
  simplicity, "back in the Middle Ages a feudal lord would build a huge wall
  around everything he owned: houses, barns, shops, mills, fields, orchards,
  groves&mdash;everything. Then he would dig a deep ditch around his estate and
  run it full of water. Occasionally he would organize his men and go out to
  stage a big fight. Whether he won or lost, there was always a home-base to
  return to. Whenever he had had enough of fighting he could go back, pull up
  the sturdy old drawbridge, and thumb his nose at the whole world. Everything
  he really needed was snug inside the wall. Well, that's the way I feel now. I
  made an excursion, and I've been licked. Now I'm home again. It's a good
  place to be."</p>

  <p>Hannah had been listening with wide-eyed interest. A great deal of what
  Paul had been saying stirred memories of Philip's frequent references to
  modes of life long, long ago. She made no comment, realizing that Paul hadn't
  finished what he wanted to say. She nodded encouragingly, and waited.</p>

  <p>"But here is the thing that mystifies me, Hannah. Why did I stop hating
  the Ellises? The reason for my hating them has not changed in the slightest
  degree. They stole my only chance to set myself free and live a privileged
  life. They have not given my property back. And I have promised not to
  exercise my lawful right to it. But I don't care. I'm entirely
  satisfied."</p>

  <p>Hannah's eyes sparkled.</p>

  <p>"That's the best news I've heard for a long time. I don't think there is
  anything so mysterious about it. You loathed and despised the Ellises because
  you felt they had beaten you. Now you've left off hating them. Can't you
  understand what that means? Down inside yourself, somewhere, you have decided
  that the Ellises have not beaten you. That's the explanation of this feeling
  of safety, security, same as the lord behind the high wall and the
  what-you-may-call-it. Philip used to talk about it."</p>

  <p>"Moat," supplied Paul, with a grin. "Who was Philip? I never heard you
  speak of him before.... But&mdash;look here! You aren't meaning to imply that
  I have got the better of the Ellises just because I've stopped wanting to
  bite them?"</p>

  <p>Hannah's face had suddenly sobered.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you all about Philip&mdash;some time. It's a long story. Maybe
  you would be interested... I'm not sure just how you have overcome the
  Ellises. It's enough to know that you really have. It will all come out, I
  suppose, and then we'll know. This much is sure: when a person makes a costly
  giving-up, he gets something for it. I don't pretend to understand it. I just
  know that one gets a new power to&mdash;to deal with things."</p>

  <p>Paul regarded her with fresh interest and curiosity for some minutes, then
  paced slowly back and forth, hands deep in his coat pockets.</p>

  <p>"Hannah"&mdash;he stopped and faced her with a severity of a
  prosecutor&mdash;"I'm going to ask you a direct question. Do you honestly
  believe that my decision, that night, accounted for Wallie's recovery?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know," replied Hannah, so softly that the words were barely
  audible. "But I think it had everything to do with yours."</p>

  <p>"Was I sick, too?"</p>

  <p>"Very."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;be that as it may." Paul seemed impatient to settle the case
  of Wallie's rescue. "The doctor and the nurse think the serum saved my boy's
  life. What do you think?"</p>

  <p>"It might have been the serum," conceded Hannah. "They ought to know."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but didn't you get yourself all stirred up when you thought I was
  dickering with Them&mdash;or Him&mdash;or It? Don't you remember?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't want you to take the risk of doing Wallie some damage,"
  explained Hannah weakly.</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;there you are!" Paul leaned over the table and searched her
  eyes. "The wrong way to have done it might have hurt Wallie. That means that
  the right way to have done it might have helped Wallie. And now you admit
  that you don't know."</p>

  <p>"That's because I am trying to be honest," declared Hannah, accenting her
  words. "We're dealing with something here that nobody knows very much about.
  I'm sure I don't. I hoped you might do Wallie some good. He was so very sick
  that anything was worth trying. We tried it&mdash;and Wallie got well. Wallie
  also had fine care, all the way through his sickness, and there was the
  serum. Why should I be asked to say whether I thought the serum had anything
  to do with Wallie's getting well? How could I know? Perhaps I have some
  private ideas on the subject&mdash;but maybe they're not worth much. I'm not
  a doctor."</p>

  <p>Paul nodded his head several times and pursed his lips tightly.</p>

  <p>"So you think it may have been the serum, after all, now that we're calm
  enough to look at the affair unemotionally."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;it might have been the serum that cured Wallie but&mdash;my
  friend"&mdash;Hannah's voice took on a confident note&mdash;"it was something
  else than serum that cured <i>you</i>! You hated the Ellis brothers because
  they had power over you. Now you've stopped hating them because <i>you</i>
  have been given power. I haven't the faintest idea what you're going to do
  with it, but it's there to be used for something&mdash;if you want to. I'm
  quite sure of that."</p>

  <p>"Now, Hannah, you're getting beyond my depth again," growled Paul.</p>

  <p>"I mean, you've been given something that makes you feel secure again.
  Perhaps you could put this power to work on some other big problem."</p>

  <p>Paul shrugged a shoulder and muttered that he supposed she meant he could
  do something about his debts. Hannah shook her head. "Nonsense!" she
  exclaimed. "We paid the debts before. We can do it again. That's simple
  enough. I'm thinking about something <i>important!"</i></p>

  <p>"Another invention, may be," scoffed Paul. "Well, let me tell you
  something, Hannah. It's beyond hope that I'll ever think up another
  invention&mdash;and see it through to the end."</p>

  <p>Hannah rubbed her temples hard with her strong fingers and after a long
  silence replied, as from a distance, "Maybe you didn't see this one through
  to the end."</p>

  <p>"It made ice, didn't it? That's all it was for&mdash;wasn't it?" Paul's
  voice rose a little, half testily. "I never thought it would shovel snow, or
  mow the lawn, or answer the door-bell. How do you mean, I didn't see it
  through to the end?"</p>

  <p>She motioned to him to sit down.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to tell you about Philip Raymond, Paul." Her voice was very low
  and the words came slowly. "When I was a young girl I was very much in love
  with a boy who was sick. He was the son of the people I worked for. He liked
  me and I often read to him. And he used to talk to me. In fact, everything I
  believe that is worth believing I owe to Philip. He knew he was going to die.
  Things close at hand didn't interest him."</p>

  <p>"Thinking about the future?" asked Paul, wanting to seem interested.</p>

  <p>"Not the least bit. He was always talking about the past, same as you were
  a while ago. Sometimes he would ramble on for a whole afternoon about the
  history of ancient people; how they would be driven from one country to
  another by fierce tribes. And every time they had to face the hard conditions
  of living in a new land they became more powerful."</p>

  <p>"Of course! 'Root, hog&mdash;or die!'"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Came to a country where there were no natural caves to live in and
  the rocks were too heavy to lift. So&mdash;one of them invented a pulley.
  And&mdash;after that&mdash;they could lift anything they pleased, no matter
  how big it was. Philip said they never could have done it if they hadn't been
  driven out of the safe and pleasant country they had owned. They had to give
  up everything they possessed for that pulley, but it was the pulley that made
  it possible for them to erect great buildings and monuments. And it was these
  buildings and monuments that gave them a feeling of natural pride.</p>

  <p>"And then the windlass. And when their stone chisels were too soft for
  dealing with such great blocks of granite, a man made a heavier tool of
  metal. Philip said they never would have discovered the use of metal back in
  the old country where their food grew wild on the trees and the days were
  never cold. And then there was always a new sense of freedom when they were
  forced to leave everything and run for their lives. You see, they would have
  gathered up a great lot of things that held them fast; herds of cattle to be
  fed, sheep to be sheared, corn to be harvested, furniture and pottery to be
  guarded against thieves. The things they owned had made slaves of them. And
  then they would be lashed and slapped and kicked out of their country by
  invaders with nothing but their knapsacks, leaving all their property behind.
  Everything they had would be lost&mdash;but they would have come into a new
  freedom. It was the very things they had owned that had kept them from coming
  into new power. They found their lives by losing them."</p>

  <p>Paul drew a long sigh and chuckled.</p>

  <p>"That's all very well, Hannah, as an explanation of dawn-man development.
  I'm afraid your Philip would have had a rough time trying to apply it to our
  own affairs to-day."</p>

  <p>Hannah's eyes lighted.</p>

  <p>"But that's what Philip was trying to get at, you see! He said that if a
  man, to-day, would resolve to disarm and let the greedy people rob him of
  everything he owned, occasionally, forcing him to adopt new habits and new
  methods of work, he might expect to become great! The same difficult
  conditions that led to the invention of the needle and the compass and the
  saw and the lever, Philip thought, would develop a man <i>now!"</i></p>

  <p>"Of course I see what you're trying to say, Hannah," said Paul cannily.
  "The Ellises steal my invention and strip me of a fortune that was all but in
  hand. My job now is to leave it, without protest, and build something
  else&mdash;spider fashion. There's nothing new about that doctrine. Children
  have been speaking pieces about it on Friday afternoons at school for five
  thousand years."</p>

  <p>Hannah was quiet for a moment, and then remarked dryly that if people had
  been teaching this to their children for five thousand years perhaps there
  was some truth in it. This made Paul laugh. He rose, stretched his long arms,
  and signified that the lengthy discussion&mdash;so far as he was
  concerned&mdash;had reached the time for adjournment.</p>

  <p>"Very well, Hannah," he said drollishly. "The Ellises having cleaned me
  out I'll take up my bag and pilgrim's staff and seek a new country...
  But&mdash;I really can't think of anything more to be done to the
  refrigerator."</p>

  <p>"Maybe not," replied Hannah. "Somebody will. Why not you?"</p>

  <p>Something had been cautioning Hannah that it was all too good to be true;
  that a reaction would set in; that this calm spirit of Paul's might be
  expected to boil over one of these days.</p>

  <p>Wallie had gone back to school on the tenth, and the customary routine of
  the house was resumed almost as if nothing had ever happened to disturb it.
  Perhaps all the attention he had received for five weeks had given him some
  odd ideas about his relation to the other objects of creation. If so, what
  else could you expect? He was only a boy, and at a period of life when being
  a boy was a difficult job, even if the conditions were entirely normal.</p>

  <p>There was quite a spirited discussion at the table on Saturday noon,
  Wallie having announced that he was going skating with Billy Prentice, and
  his father having forbidden it because there had been a thaw.</p>

  <p>"But the ice is three feet thick, Dad," pursued Wallie.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe it. And you're not to go. We've had all the worry about
  you that the traffic will stand. You mustn't give us any more of it&mdash;not
  for a while."</p>

  <p>Paul's voice was hard. But then, he had had a rough morning&mdash;going
  through his bills. There wasn't much he could do about them, but there they
  were. It wasn't a suitable time for Wallie to rub him the wrong way. Hannah
  wished she might get the boy off in a corner and give him a word or two on
  the subject.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't my fault if I took sick&mdash;and pretty near died, was it?"
  demanded Wallie, still capitalizing the seriousness of his recent disability,
  and rather surprised that so grave a matter could be viewed otherwise than
  with the greatest tenderness.</p>

  <p>"I'm not so sure," muttered Paul. Marcia broke in to inquire if he wanted
  a little Worcester sauce for his Spanish omelet, but he merely shook his head
  in the general direction of her distracting inquiry. "You would go to that
  basketball game, in spite of everything that was done to dissuade you. You
  knew that I was in a serious business difficulty, and had no time or thought
  for anything but that. So you defied everybody and went to the game when you
  were sick and should have been in bed."</p>

  <p>Roberta said, "Excuse me, please," and began edging off her chair.</p>

  <p>"Better finish your luncheon, dear," advised Marcia, in a low voice.
  "You'll be hungry after a while."</p>

  <p>"Let her go," growled Paul. "If Roberta is too sensitive to bear with her
  father while he announces a few simple truths, let her go. She'll have more
  fun sulking than eating.... What I am trying to say, Wallie, is that you are
  not to go skating this afternoon. It's much too risky. You take a chance on
  coming home drenched to the skin, or drowned, maybe."</p>

  <p>"I have some work to do," mumbled Roberta, leaving the table.</p>

  <p>"Never mind, Daddy, I'll stick," promised Sally amiably. "I love
  quarrelling, so long's I'm not in it." She passed her plate. "A little more
  please... Now, Wallie, you say, 'But Billy's father is letting <i>him</i>
  go.'"</p>

  <p>"You shut up," snarled Wallie. "And stop being so darn cute."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;children!" pleaded Marcia.</p>

  <p>Paul dealt severely with an incipient grin, and gave Sally a private wink
  along with another helping of the omelet.</p>

  <p>"I saw you do that," grumbled Wallie.</p>

  <p>"Bright eyes," remarked Sally, to her plate.</p>

  <p>"That will be all," decided Paul. "Wallie, you may plan to amuse yourself
  some other way this afternoon." His voice softened. "We can't have you sick
  any more, you know."</p>

  <p>With her palms upturned idly in her lap Marcia gazed woodenly out at the
  dazzling sunshine, her impassive face registering quiet, resigned disgust for
  the whole affair. She couldn't think where the children had derived their
  snappishness. Certainly not from her. Nor her people. As she had often said,
  the Wallace home was a peaceful haven. By unspoken agreement they rose and
  left the table, Marcia going up to her room. Wallie left by the front door,
  which he closed after him with a significant emphasis. Sally joined Hannah in
  the kitchen.</p>

  <p>"They're all so funny," she said, munching a cookie.</p>

  <p>"You shouldn't laugh at people when they're disturbed about something,"
  admonished Hannah.</p>

  <p>"You said sometimes a laugh would stop a quarrel, Hannah. You know you
  did," defended Sally, trying to play at being misunderstood.</p>

  <p>"It's better to make a little joke about yourself, dear, and have them
  laugh at <i>you."</i></p>

  <p>"But I don't know any jokes on myself," protested Sally.</p>

  <p>"Then you should find some. People who can't remember at least a few good
  jokes on themselves aren't very well-to-do&mdash;inside."</p>

  <p>Their talk was interrupted by Paul's passing through the kitchen to look
  at the furnace. His face was gloomy. He closed the door after him at the top
  of the stairs, as if to say he'd enough family and wished to put the whole
  outfit behind him for an interval.</p>

  <p>He had always despised Saturdays, even as a lad. Always there were
  unpleasant chores to be done. Sunday was dull enough, but you didn't have to
  chop kindling or sort spotty apples. Out in rural Iowa they had always
  remembered the Sabbath Day to keep it holy. He had remembered it ever since,
  Sunday for its holiness. Saturday was a day to be remembered too&mdash;for
  its grubbiness.</p>

  <p>It occurred to him that he might run over to the University Club and play
  billiards. But that would mean tea and cakes. The bills were plenty large. It
  was high time he was economizing. He stirred the furnace savagely and a huge
  puff of smarting smoke belched forth. Not very good coal, this time. Some of
  Hannah's doings, probably. Trying to save money. He threw in two shovelfuls
  of coal and banged the hot door shut with his foot.</p>

  <p>At the entrance of the little fruit-cellar he paused. The wreck of his
  motor lay exactly where he had left it. Leaning a shoulder against the
  door-jamb, he regarded the thing with sour reproach. No new thoughts occurred
  to him in respect to this smashed machine. He could face it now without
  loathing. It was no longer the pitiful corpse of a cherished dream, but the
  dried skeleton. His interest in it seemed remote, impersonal.</p>

  <p>After all, there wasn't much to live for when you came to look at human
  existence rationally. You began with the idea that you were, potentially, a
  very remarkable fellow. At twelve, you recited <i>Excelsior,</i> and learned
  your syntax by performing anatomical dissections of classic prose inviting
  you to make a better mousetrap. When you graduated from high school, you made
  a speech largely compiled from the advices of inspirational authors and wound
  up at the end with a hoarse sentence from the <i>Message to Garcia.</i> The
  old man who talked at your college Commencement dared you to go out and run
  circles around the whole bunch, both ancient and contemporary. So, you let
  them dazzle you with that kind of prattle from the time you were able to blow
  your own nose until the drudgeries of daily work completely swamped you.</p>

  <p>You went into the groove-shop and looked them all over carefully and
  picked out a nice smooth groove that you thought was about your size. Then
  you sat yourself neatly into it and started on your ring-around-a-rosy,
  making the groove a little deeper with every revolution until the sleek walls
  of it began to compress your elbows against your ribs. That was the worst
  part of it&mdash;the surrender of elbow-room. You felt stifled. Your wife was
  devoted and you adored her, but she clung to you like the drowning, shutting
  off your air, so it was impossible for you to rescue either her or yourself.
  Your children acquired longer legs and worse manners. They used you for a
  beast of burden and ridiculed you for putting up with it. Your monthly
  bills&mdash;Good God!</p>

  <p>There were footsteps on the stairs. That would be Hannah, coming down on
  one pretext or another to satisfy her curiosity about him. Hannah had done
  wonders for them, and it would be caddish to resent her affectionate
  interest, but even Hannah occasionally smothered him with too much attention.
  He glanced at her over his shoulder, observing that she carried a basket full
  of empty cans and bottles presumably intended for the big box where such
  accumulations were deposited.</p>

  <p>"Speaking of rubbish"&mdash;he gave her a cynical smile and jerked his
  head towards the wrecked motor&mdash;"next time the man comes you'd better
  have him cart this thing away."</p>

  <p>"Isn't any part of it worth saving?" Hannah stood beside him, viewing the
  machine appraisingly. "Perhaps it would bring a little more than just that
  much scrap-iron."</p>

  <p>She was taking it mighty coolly, he thought. Considering how much grief
  the whole thing had caused him, it was rather casual to be discussing whether
  the symbol of his disaster should be sold for junk or hauled to the city
  dump.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't a very good job, anyhow. I think Ellis cheated me when he made
  it. I might have known what sort of person he was. People like that ought to
  be shown up for what they are. I'm not sure but it's a public duty." Paul
  found this new thought absorbing. Odd it hadn't struck him before. "You're
  something of an authority on morals. Hannah. Doesn't it look as if I were an
  accessory to Ellis's grand larceny when I know all about it and do
  nothing?"</p>

  <p>She grinned understandingly.</p>

  <p>"That's <i>your</i> affair," she replied, unhelpfully. <i>"Mine</i> is to
  keep myself from being mixed up with a much bigger crime."</p>

  <p>His eyes inquired what she meant, though it was difficult for him to
  dissemble when dealing with Hannah.</p>

  <p>"You're wanting me to encourage you in the breaking of your promise; isn't
  that it? Suppose we talk about that a little."</p>

  <p>"Very well&mdash;go ahead!" rasped Paul. "You're the one who engineered
  that promise, so you probably know the most about it."</p>

  <p>"You mustn't be unkind," murmured Hannah. "We can talk about it
  calmly&mdash;can't we? It isn't as if you had promised <i>me.</i> If it had
  only been to me, I could let you off."</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;" Paul raised his eyes and pointed a finger skyward. "You
  mean Them&mdash;or It&mdash;or Him&mdash;or&mdash;or What?" He chuckled
  dryly.</p>

  <p>She nodded. "And you were quite in earnest about it too. It wasn't a bit
  funny when you did it." Her words were spoken gently but very soberly. "I'd
  be afraid."</p>

  <p>Paul made a gesture of impatience.</p>

  <p>"Now that kind of talk, Hannah, is all very well for people who honestly
  believe in such things. I know you do and I respect you for it. But it leaves
  me cold. I don't accept it. I haven't any room in my thinking for
  ghosts&mdash;not even a Holy Ghost. That's my calm, considered opinion in
  broad daylight. Of course, when a man is at the tip-end of his resources and
  emotionally upset, you can't blame him for grabbing at any idea, however
  irrational. It's like a drowning man clutching at a straw. He doesn't clutch
  the straw because he thinks highly of it as a life-preserver. He doesn't
  think about it at all! His brains aren't working."</p>

  <p>"Maybe so," sighed Hannah. "But, all the same, I don't believe you would
  ever feel right about it if you broke that promise. You say you doubt whether
  there is"&mdash;she hesitated for an instant and then pointed upward as Paul
  had done&mdash;"anything Up There. But that doesn't quite let you out.
  There's something <i>down here</i>&mdash;" Hannah tapped him lightly on his
  chest. "Maybe <i>They</i> are not real&mdash;but <i>You</i> are! If you want
  to break your promise to me, I'll forgive you and understand. And if you want
  to break the promise you made to Him or Them, because you don't believe there
  is any such thing, maybe you can do it and never hear from it again. But if
  you break the promise you made to <i>yourself</i>&mdash;well, that's another
  matter. You'll be sorry!"</p>

  <p>Hannah slowly turned away and walked to the foot of the stairs, where she
  stood for a moment abstractedly swinging her empty basket, not at all
  satisfied with the manner in which their talk had ended. The echo of her
  final remark lingered unpleasantly in her ears.</p>

  <p>Returning, she found Paul seated on the dusty workbench in a posture of
  deep concentration. Laying her hand on his arm she said contritely, "I didn't
  mean to be impudent. I'm sorry."</p>

  <p>"That's all right, Hannah," he muttered. "No offence." His tone conveyed
  an obvious dismissal, but she made no move to go. There was an extended
  silence.</p>

  <p>"You've had so many serious losses, Paul. I couldn't bear to see you have
  the greatest one of all&mdash;the giving up of your pride." He glanced up,
  and their eyes met in a long look of mutual appraisal.</p>

  <p>"And is that so valuable?" he queried. "Seems to me a good deal has been
  said, from time to time, about the damaging effects of pride." His lips
  twisted in a rather surly grin. "If you want to know how highly pride is
  esteemed by the people who are supposed to pass on such matters you might
  look in the Bible."</p>

  <p>"Maybe it means something else in the Bible. Pride, to me, isn't showing
  off. Pride is what makes me feel comfortable when I'm by myself. There are
  plenty of things I wouldn't do, not because I'm too proud to do them. All I
  want is the approval of myself." She paused, smiled, and added, "That's why I
  came back. I didn't quite approve of what I had said to you."</p>

  <p>"It was all true enough," confessed Paul, glumly. "We both know that."</p>

  <p>"I'll go now," said Hannah.</p>

  <p>"And leave me to stew in my own juice, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid so." Her tone was tender, almost maternal. "It distresses me
  when you are unhappy. You've had a great deal to bear. I can't think of your
  doing this cruel thing to yourself."</p>

  <p>Impulsively he rose from the bench and reached out his hand. "Very well,
  Hannah," he declared firmly. "I shall stick to my bargain. You win."</p>

  <p>She took his hand in both of hers and clasped it tightly, her eyes
  shining. She shook her head slightly.</p>

  <p>"No, Paul, it's <i>you</i> who've won! And it is a very important
  victory."</p>

  <p>"Victory? Nonsense! It's just a final giving up; that's all. Just the swan
  song. I've been doing nothing lately but run up white flags."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;not white flags, Paul. <i>White banners!"</i> Hannah's voice was
  vibrant with emotion. "You haven't surrendered. You have just taken a new
  position. You'll be able to see your way&mdash;from here. I'm not going to
  worry about you any more."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch08"
     id="ch08">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">PAUL was unable immediately to recapture his former interest
  in his profession. The assorted distractions of many months were no longer
  claiming his time and mind, but it was not easy to concentrate on classroom
  lectures, student interviews, quiz-papers, and seminars after so long a
  period of perfunctory obedience to the mere letter of the law respecting his
  university obligations.</p>

  <p>It was only after weeks of honest diligence that he regained enough
  sincere regard for his job to realise the extent of his abandonment of it.
  Occasionally he flushed with chagrin as the fact dawned on him that but for
  Dean Oliver's patience he might have been asked to quit altogether.</p>

  <p>By the close of the second semester the old habits of work had been
  resumed and something like enthusiasm had developed. His chief ambition now
  was to show good old Oliver how much he appreciated the forbearance exercised
  in his behalf. They had had no conversation about the matter, but Paul
  observed, from the approving twinkle in the Dean's eye, that these earnest
  efforts to reinstate himself in the esteem of his chief had been duly
  noted.</p>

  <p>As an additional testimony that he was again at his post of duty and meant
  business, Paul commenced work on a solid biography of Spenser intended for
  scholars. When he composed the preface his mood was that of a man writing a
  personal letter to Dean Oliver. And the Dean, when he had read the first
  three chapters, said warmly, "Now you have struck your stride, Ward. This
  book will do you good, perhaps not in cash but in professional
  advancement."</p>

  <p>That same night Mrs Oliver called up Marcia to invite them to the dinner
  they were giving on the twenty-third for Springer of Cambridge, who had just
  arrived as an exchange lecturer.</p>

  <p>From that time forward Paul sensed a new attitude towards him on the part
  of his colleagues. More and more frequently did the Dean call him in for
  conference on minor administrational problems. And when Commencement
  impended, half of his evenings were spent at the office, to the improvement
  of his next salary cheque by seventy-five dollars. At one o'clock on
  Commencement Day he went home with his soggy, black gown over his arm, hot
  and weary but pleased to believe that he had amply atoned for a long period
  of slackness and inattention by giving the University full measure, now that
  he was back in the running.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The new Ellis refrigerator appeared on the market backed by an expensively
  vivid campaign of publicity. Paul was gratified that the announcement caused
  him so little distress. Marcia had laid the magazine on his desk, open at the
  page. He pursed his lips, glanced briefly at the picture, ran his eye over
  the text, grinned sourly, and pushed the offending thing off the end of the
  table into the waste-basket. Then he took up his pen and finished the
  sentence he was composing. Marcia observed, "You certainly have yourself well
  in hand, dear." And this made Paul glow with satisfaction. He had never
  thought of himself that way. It made him ambitious to achieve poise, balance,
  ballast.</p>

  <p>Marcia took the children to the lake cottage where they had spent other
  summers, leaving Hannah to run the house. Paul joined the family at week-ends
  and for a fortnight in August.</p>

  <p>The book was having a marked effect on Paul. It was steadying him. For
  seven hours every day his potential audience gathered about his desk;
  post-graduates, for the most part, their imagined presence influencing his
  rhetorical style. A sprinkling of the faculty was in this fancied audience,
  with Dean Oliver in the middle of the front row, his head tipped a little to
  one side as if he might be doubting the accuracy of the current
  statement.</p>

  <p>It was not Paul's nature to dramatize himself, but he was becoming aware
  of his new acquisition. He observed that he was walking with a more regular
  and deliberate step. His gestures were fewer. His decisions, even in small
  matters, were carefully considered and calmly spoken. The book might not shed
  much new light on Edmund Spenser, but it was illuminating the unevaluated
  stability of Paul Ward.</p>

  <p>Hannah remarked this change in his tempo from a volatile six-eight to a
  ponderous four-four, and wasn't quite sure that she approved. Whatever might
  have been the liabilities of his effervescent temperament&mdash;his proneness
  to go off at half-cock, his sudden, gusty, unpredictable seizures of
  irritability and forthright rudeness, followed by brief remorses&mdash;he was
  certainly more interesting than this solemn owl who tramped about the house
  with the impressive tread of a Major Prophet. Hannah would have welcomed a
  wild outcry from the bathroom, addressed to nobody in particular, "What in
  hell has become of my razor-blades?"</p>

  <p>And, speaking of razor-blades, it was observed that the professor had not
  shaved for a week. Jockeying a conversation about his tireless diligence to a
  point where he might say he had been too busy to shave, Hannah was alarmed to
  learn that he contemplated a Van Dyke. She was serving breakfast when he
  dryly offered this information and glanced up to note its reception.</p>

  <p>"You'll never be able to run any more," declared Hannah, in a tone of
  warning.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I don't want to run," replied Paul, stroking his bristles. "I
  think a little dignity would be to my advantage."</p>

  <p>"At times&mdash;yes," she agreed reminiscently. "It would be nice if you
  had a dignified beard with wires on it&mdash;to be hooked over your ears. And
  then, whenever you felt you were sort of spluttery&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Paul rewarded her persiflage with a feeble grin. Really, Hannah went a bit
  too far sometimes with her impudence; meant it as a little pleasantry, of
  course, but shouldn't be encouraged in it. He reflected, however, there was
  no sense or justice in hurting her feelings.</p>

  <p>"Quite a fantastic idea, Hannah," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"And you could take it off when you wanted to play."</p>

  <p>Paul said "Umm" rather inattentively, and Hannah vouchsafed a few remarks
  on personality. It didn't do people much good to try to alter themselves into
  something else.</p>

  <p>"A red-headed woman," she continued, "can say and do things that make her
  charming, but if a black-haired woman dyes her hair red and then tries to say
  and do red-headed things, she is sure to fail because, after all, she hasn't
  a red-headed character. You can't dye a personality."</p>

  <p>"I presume what you're trying to get at, Hannah," observed Paul crisply,
  "is that I haven't a Van Dyke personality."</p>

  <p>"If I may say so, I think you would tire of it."</p>

  <p>"Well, now that you have said so, I think you may say so. If I don't like
  it I can take it off."</p>

  <p>"Not so well," objected Hannah. "When you put it on, people will think you
  did it because you weren't pleased with yourself. They will suppose you have
  found something the matter with yourself and have decided to try to look like
  someone else. That's risky enough. But if you take it off again, it's the
  same as saying you're still displeased with yourself and that the remedy you
  tried was no good." She was so sober about it that Paul laughed.</p>

  <p>The next morning he appeared at breakfast with his face clean and
  pink.</p>

  <p>"That's better," approved Hannah, pouring his coffee. "Now you can dance
  jigs&mdash;and everything."</p>

  <p>With the opening of the autumn semester, Paul found himself booked for a
  considerable number of University Extension lectures, most of the dates in
  larger towns, one in Chicago. It was being demonstrated that his new devotion
  to his duties had earned him this bonus.</p>

  <p>One Thursday night in early November he lectured in Waterloo. There was a
  large and genial audience out to hear him and he was at his best. In high
  spirits and well satisfied with what he had done, he went to the train,
  walking with an elastic step. Life, he reflected, might be worse. He had
  foozled some of his opportunities, but the future still held out a promise of
  fair reward for zealous application to his job. His trouble had been that he
  had tried to accomplish something in another field than his own. He would
  make it a point to avoid a repetition of such time-wasting excursions. He
  would never be rich, but he would be increasingly recognized as a sound
  workman in his profession.</p>

  <p>Not many were waiting at the small brick station. Paul sauntered up and
  down the platform, the best periods of his lecture still echoing pleasantly
  in his memory. To interpret an ancient bard and reconstruct an almost
  forgotten era was worth doing. To make the versatile Spenser live anew was a
  feat comparable to an act of resurrection. Then he got to thinking about the
  reality of resurrection and wondered if a well-turned phrase, pivoting on
  this concept, might not brighten one sentence of the preface for his new
  book.</p>

  <p>Presently he saw Hannah. She was in company with a woman slightly older
  than herself and a sturdy little boy of seven or eight. For a moment it
  occurred to him that Hannah, consistently secretive about her movements when
  off duty, might not wish to be recognized, and he had decided not to approach
  her when she glanced in his direction and their eyes met. Hannah smiled an
  unmistakable welcome and he advanced to speak. Unflustered, she presented her
  friend, Mrs Edmunds, who graciously accepted Professor Ward's acquaintance,
  but gave no sign whether the name meant anything to her.</p>

  <p>"And this is Peter," added Hannah.</p>

  <p>Paul greeted them amiably, exchanged the inevitables with the comely Mrs
  Edmunds, whom he promptly appraised as a person of undoubtable refinement,
  and, when the preliminary amenities had been attended to, turned his
  attention to the lad. He had a strong, determined face; quite an arresting
  face, indeed, for a child of his years. You weren't sure what manner of
  approach to make, but it was reasonably certain you should not try talking
  down to him.</p>

  <p>"You know my Aunt Hannah?" asked Peter quietly.</p>

  <p>"Very well&mdash;but I did not know she was your Aunt Hannah." Paul wished
  he knew just where he stood in this matter. Hannah's well-balanced,
  non-committal smile offered no aid. One fact was fairly evident. The boy knew
  nothing of Hannah's employment. This Mrs Edmunds knew, of course, or Hannah
  would not have risked a possible bean-spilling by inviting him to speak to
  them. He glanced into Mrs Edmunds's disciplined eyes for a clue to this
  little mystery, but she did not oblige him.</p>

  <p>"Are you a really-truly professor?" Peter's uplifted eyes squinted
  incredulously.</p>

  <p>Paul laughed merrily, partly because he was amused, partly to assure the
  lad's mother&mdash;who would probably be distressed&mdash;that her child's
  innocent impudence had not annoyed him. But Mrs Edmunds, not in the least
  abashed, laughed too. Hannah, with a half-apologetic smile, said, "Why,
  Peter&mdash;whatever made you ask that question?"</p>

  <p>Aware that he had blundered, the boy replied defensively, "I thought
  professors were old men."</p>

  <p>"Nice recovery, Peter," approved Paul. "You've the makings of a
  statesman."</p>

  <p>"No"&mdash;drawled Mrs Edmunds&mdash;"I think Peter was entirely
  honest."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, then"&mdash;said Paul&mdash;"to both of you."</p>

  <p>At this Hannah smiled her relief over the pleasant termination of an
  awkward moment. It was rather odd, thought Paul. Hannah had seemed to feel
  more responsibility for the lad's remark than had his mother. It was easy to
  see how deep was her devotion to this boy. He was on the point of saying,
  "You must come and spend a day with your Aunt Hannah, Peter"&mdash;but
  decided against it. Something told him there was a little riddle here.</p>

  <p>The noisy arrival of the train ended their conversation. Paul had expected
  to find a seat in the parlour-car, but when Hannah stopped at the steps of
  the day coach he decided to join her. She seemed calmly undisturbed by their
  chance meeting and made room for him beside her on the seat as if it were
  quite natural for them to be travelling together.</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;<i>this</i> is where you come&mdash;on your days off," he
  observed; adding slyly, "You've always been so mysterious about your holidays
  that I wondered if&mdash;" He hesitated.</p>

  <p>"You wondered if I was up to something I was ashamed of?" assisted Hannah.
  "Well&mdash;now you know." She faced him with steady, smiling eyes.</p>

  <p>"Exceptionally attractive boy&mdash;young Peter," said Paul warmly. "What
  does his father do?"</p>

  <p>"Mr Edmunds is dead; died when Peter was too little to remember him
  clearly. He is a great comfort to Lydia."</p>

  <p>"You're related to her&mdash;some way?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;just very close friends. It's a long story. Mr Edmunds was a
  chemist. He was killed in an accident. Lydia's relatives live in the East.
  Circumstances threw us together. I had no family within easy reach.
  Naturally, we became friends." Hannah busied herself, during this recital,
  with a search in her handbag for her ticket, though the conductor had not yet
  appeared. "That's about all there is to be told."</p>

  <p>"Pleasant for both of you, I'm sure," commented Paul. "No necessity for
  any secrecy. You should assure Mrs Edmunds that she is very welcome at our
  house whenever she wishes to come and see you."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;it's better, I think, that she doesn't," said Hannah,
  measuring her words. "It doesn't bother Lydia that I am a servant, but she
  has her own social position to think of. No one in Waterloo knows how or
  where I am employed. It's better so."</p>

  <p>Paul nodded understandingly.</p>

  <p>"I see," he agreed. "And that's why you kept it a secret."</p>

  <p>"Yes.... Not even Peter knows. He thinks I'm his aunt."</p>

  <p>"So I noticed. You're very fond of him."</p>

  <p>"Naturally&mdash;he was a mere infant when I first saw him."</p>

  <p>The conductor came then and caused a brief interruption in their talk.</p>

  <p>"Edmunds, Edmunds," muttered Paul, searching his memory. "Seems to me I
  recall the case of a chemist&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's the one," said Hannah. "He was killed in an explosion at the glass
  works in Rattoon."</p>

  <p>Paul's eyes suddenly lighted.</p>

  <p>"I suppose he left quite a few books on chemistry."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;Lydia kept them all."</p>

  <p>"So that's where you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Hannah nodded.</p>

  <p>"Lydia thought I was quite foolish."</p>

  <p>"I don't wonder. By any normal rule of reckoning, it was utterly silly.
  The discovery you made was sheer accident."</p>

  <p>Hannah drew a long sigh and said "Maybe". Then, shifting her position so
  she might face Paul more directly, she proceeded, with considerable
  animation, to relate the day's adventures. She and Lydia and Peter had gone
  downtown, bought him a new suit, a pair of roller-skates, "and ice-cream, of
  course," she added.</p>

  <p>Paul chuckled. "I'm surprised," he said dryly, "your being a party to the
  outright purchase of ice-cream. You're for ever making it at home in that
  clumsy old freezer. I've always maintained it was cheaper to buy it."</p>

  <p>"You need the exercise, Mr Ward. Turning that crank is good for you.
  Besides&mdash;it's ever so much better when you make it at home."</p>

  <p>"Don't you want little Peter to have good ice-cream?" Paul searched her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>Hannah stroked the fingers of her gloves and did not at once reply.</p>

  <p>"I agree," she said, at length, "there really ought to be an easier way to
  make ice-cream at home. I'll not ask you to do it, any more. I
  thought&mdash;" There was a long pause. "You'll forgive me, won't you, Mr
  Ward, but I've kept hoping that if you were faced, now and then, with this
  ice problem, maybe you would&mdash;maybe you would do something about
  it."</p>

  <p>"I'm not in the ice business, not any more," growled Paul.</p>

  <p>"That's the pity of it," rejoined Hannah. "Why aren't you?"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>It was a busy winter for Marcia Ward. Paul's conspicuous zeal at the
  University was earning them rewards in the form of invitations to teas,
  dinners, and receptions.</p>

  <p>Beyond doubt, the marked attentions shown them by Dean and Mrs Oliver had
  everything to do with it. The Dean had announced that Paul would be
  officially appointed his assistant at the end of the year, which meant
  nothing else than that Paul's succession to the deanship, upon the retirement
  or resignation of Oliver, was practically assured.</p>

  <p>The importance of rank at the University was of a seriousness unmatched
  even in the army. It was no trivial matter to be made an assistant dean under
  any circumstance, but to be assistant to fagged old Oliver, who frankly
  fretted under the onerous duties of his office and wished himself well out of
  it, was a weighty responsibility carrying with it a deal of power over the
  professional welfare of many faculty men. Naturally the "Lits" began to view
  Professor Ward with a new respect. It was important to keep in his good
  graces, and one easy and pleasant way to achieve this end was by showing
  social courtesies to his wife.</p>

  <p>Marcia was dressing with more care and carried herself with a new
  confidence. For the first time in her life she was realizing that she
  possessed social gifts. Presently she ventured upon a programme of
  discharging the obligations incurred by their acceptance of favours. As a
  hostess she was a surprising success. Paul was proud of her; proud also of
  the admiration she won by her beauty and charm. But however delightfully
  exciting was the new life on which they had embarked&mdash;or, more
  correctly, into which they had been thrust&mdash;it was playing the deuce
  with the family budget. Their creditors were not quite so rude as in the days
  of their utter obscurity, but eventually arrangements would have to be made
  to catch up with their bills.</p>

  <p>Paul remarked one evening in April as he and Marcia discussed their
  perplexities, "The butcher will not call up to dun us for <i>filet
  mignons,</i> as he would for pot roasts, but one of these days he will want
  us to pay the bill."</p>

  <p>When another Commencement had come and relaxation had set in, the restless
  fellow began to be so acutely distressed over the situation that he found it
  very difficult to concentrate on his book. He could easily finish it, this
  vacation, if his mind were free of worry, but now&mdash;instead of facing an
  imaginary audience of specialists in Early English, as he sat at his
  desk&mdash;the little amphitheatre was filled entirely with tradesmen who
  would occasionally yelp out, in the very middle of a learned remark from the
  rostrum, "That's all very well, perfessor, but how about paying me fer that
  coal?" And sometimes a voice from the audience would snarl, "Nobody's going
  to buy yer dry book. Why don't yuh write sumpin snappy? Then yuh c'd pay yer
  honest debts!"</p>

  <p>Again Marcia and the children were at the modest lake cottage, Paul
  asserting that they could live more economically there than in town, what
  with Wallie's daily catches of perch and the easy access they had to
  inexpensive farm products. It wasn't true, but it was comforting to say it.
  Anyway, the children's clatter would be out of the house. He would be able to
  pursue his writing without distraction.</p>

  <p>But it was very slow going, this summer. Paul walked the floor, smoked
  until his throat was raw, gazed unseeing out at the windows. Spenser&mdash;in
  mid-July&mdash;was approximately at the same place where he had paused to
  rest on Independence Day.</p>

  <p>One forenoon, when things were practically at a standstill, Paul went out
  to the kitchen to have a word with Hannah. She inquired, interestedly, how
  the book was going to-day, though the query was superfluous, as they both
  knew. The book wasn't going, at all.</p>

  <p>"For a long time I have been wondering," said Hannah thoughtfully, "why
  you've made no effort to claim your rights in that refrigerator
  business."</p>

  <p>Paul regarded her with speechless astonishment, unable to believe his own
  ears. What indeed had come over Hannah?</p>

  <p>"That's an odd thing for you to say," he muttered. "It was you who
  badgered me into letting the whole thing slip through my fingers. Are you
  suggesting that I press a suit against these people now?"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;by no means! But when you let them carry off your property
  without a fight, you had a right to expect some manner of reward for your
  investment. So far as I know you have never tried to use the power that is
  surely in your hands. When the Ellises stole your invention, what really
  happened was this: they set you free to do something more important. Why
  haven't you done it? I think your case is just like that of the people who
  had their land and herds and houses taken from them, and instead of fighting
  went out to a new country and made themselves great. It wasn't as if they
  were going out entirely empty-handed. They had lost their land, but they
  could find other land. They had lost their houses, but they could build
  better houses. Nobody could steal their experience or their knowing how to do
  things. In the new country they could improve on all the work they had done
  before. Losing the old stuff was fine for them. It set them free to do bigger
  things."</p>

  <p>Paul nodded, absently, and said it was an interesting thought, adding that
  he distinctly recalled her having gone over all this moonshiny argument once
  before.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but why don't you experiment with it?" entreated Hannah. "They've
  stolen your goods and set you free to go out and put your experience to work
  in a new and better way. All you've done is to give up everything. You have
  been set free, but you've never stirred hand or foot to use your freedom.
  I've so often wondered."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you mean that I could now make a better refrigerator than the
  one they stole from me. Is that it?" Paul's tone was slightly ironical, but
  betrayed a good deal of interest. "What more do you think I could do to
  it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," admitted Hannah. "I have had you turning the handle of
  that heavy old freezer every few days for a long time, hoping you might sweat
  out an idea."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;I have gone into all that," said Paul, annoyed to have been
  considered stupid. "It would be too expensive. Nobody would want one. The
  cost of a machine for the exclusive purpose of freezing ice-cream in a
  private home would more than equal the expense of buying ice-cream to be
  served three times a day for the rest of their natural lives. No,
  no&mdash;that idea is foolish. Not meaning"&mdash;he added,
  genially&mdash;"that I don't appreciate your motive. It's mighty good of you
  to be thinking about my welfare."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;would it cost so frightfully much if it was combined with the
  other refrigerator, the one that keeps things merely cool?"</p>

  <p>Paul shook his head.</p>

  <p>"That wouldn't work. You couldn't have two temperatures in there, and the
  process that would freeze the ice-cream and sherbets would also freeze your
  milk and fruit." His eyes widened, stared, and then narrowed.
  "Unless&mdash;of course&mdash;perhaps&mdash;" he mumbled,
  half-incoherently.</p>

  <p>Hannah smiled and left him sitting there astride a kitchen chair. Paul did
  not see her go. She went upstairs and on his bed she placed two long
  discarded garments&mdash;a neatly folded shirt with elbow sleeves bearing the
  indelible stains of chemicals, and a worn but clean pair of khaki trousers.
  Returning, she found Paul standing before his desk in the living-room,
  squaring up the loose pages of his book manuscript.</p>

  <p>"Want a box for that?" asked Hannah, pausing beside him and looking up
  companionably into his eyes.</p>

  <p>"If you have one&mdash;thanks," assented Paul casually.</p>

  <p>Hannah quite liked the dialogue of this little drama. A momentous decision
  had been arrived at, but it was accomplished without hysteria. That, she
  felt, was the proper way to accept a high moment&mdash;with quietness. She
  brought a strong pasteboard box and a long piece of express cord and laid
  them on the desk. Paul chuckled a little.</p>

  <p>"I'm surprised you didn't bring a padlock," he drawled.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The steadying effect of the work Paul had done on Edmund Spenser proved to
  his advantage as he deliberately laid out plans for the new refrigerator. The
  two projects were not of the same category, but were similar in their demand
  for patient precision. There was no wasteful haste and a minimum of lost
  motion. But because he had been over a great deal of this ground before, the
  task went forward with so little delay that within two weeks he was almost up
  to the point where he had been when the unscrupulous Ellis had viewed the
  device and made off with its secret. The motor had not been built yet. Paul
  was still casting about for the best place to have it made.</p>

  <p>One afternoon Hannah heard her name called peremptorily and made haste to
  the stuffy little workshop in the fruit-cellar. Paul, with the light of an
  unexpected triumph in his eyes, motioned to her to come in.</p>

  <p>"Hannah!" he shouted jubilantly. "I'm going to put the whole damned thing
  in one box&mdash;motor and all!"</p>

  <p>"That's great! How did you ever happen to think of it?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I was just wishing I had a better place to work, and then I
  said to myself, 'Why am I planning to put the motor in the cellar, anyhow? It
  would be more effective if it was built right into the refrigerator.' I think
  we <i>have</i> something now?"</p>

  <p>"And we wouldn't have had it, would we," reflected Hannah, "if the other
  one hadn't been stolen. The Ellises set you free to do a finished job."</p>

  <p>"Hannah," said Paul, in a troubled tone, "there is something worrying me a
  little. Naturally I am using the same chemical formula as in the first one.
  The Ellises are unquestionably using that solution. Suppose they claim I've
  no right to it. I don't believe they would risk suing me in the face of all
  the facts&mdash;but what if they did? You think it would be quite right for
  me to defend myself, don't you?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head emphatically. "No, sir," she declared, "if they won't
  let you use that formula, <i>you'll find a better one!</i> I tell you, my
  friend, you've been forced out into a new country. They're not able to
  compete with you now! You know everything they know, plus the advantage of
  the freedom they gave you! I'm not sure but you really owe them something for
  stealing your other invention."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you think this vindicates your Philip," said Paul soberly. "And
  if you think that&mdash;well&mdash;you've certainly good ground for it. It's
  a very fair and reasonable demonstration. You can depend on it, Hannah, I'll
  never debate this matter with you again."</p>

  <p>"You believe it&mdash;then?" she asked hopefully.</p>

  <p>He was silent for some time.</p>

  <p>"It's very mysterious," he admitted. "It's quite beyond me. I just know
  that I have hit upon a big idea after having given up a little idea. And I
  presume that it was necessary to give up the little one before I was eligible
  to have the big one.... Or something like that," he concluded vaguely.</p>

  <p>Hannah drew a cryptic smile, and when Paul's eyes had queried her for its
  meaning, she replied, "I don't think of myself as a religious person, but
  something you just said, and the way you said it, reminded me of a story in
  the Bible about a man who was magically cured of blindness. They asked him
  all manner of questions and tried to talk him out of it, and all he would say
  was, 'I know only one thing about it: I was blind, and now I can see.'"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Paul, "I remember that story. Do you believe it, may I
  inquire?"</p>

  <p>"I think&mdash;" Hannah hesitated for a long moment. "I think I
  do&mdash;now. But I never did before. I see no reason, now, for not believing
  it&mdash;not after what has just happened to <i>you."</i></p>

  <p>Paul gave a little gesture of dismissal to the matter and began tossing
  his tools into a basket.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to move my trinkets upstairs, Hannah. We're done working in the
  basement."</p>

  <p>"To the attic, you mean? Won't it be hot up there?"</p>

  <p>"We'll open the windows and run a fan. There's more room&mdash;and,
  besides, I don't care to take any chances on this secret getting away from
  me."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Marcia received the news of Paul's resumed activities on the refrigerator
  with dismay. This, she said to herself, was really too, too much!</p>

  <p>For years on end she had been a little nobody while Paul Ward had fiddled
  with one invention after another. And she had kept hoping that some day he
  would stop trying to do the impossible and make something of himself at the
  University.</p>

  <p>Now he had done so, and with such success as she had hardly anticipated.
  Life for Marcia had expanded immeasurably. It was pleasant to bask in the
  reflected light of Paul's new distinctions. They promised an increasing
  security. She had quietly, inarticulately envied the few faculty wives whose
  husbands had arrived at positions of influence. Sometimes, when she and Paul
  went to the University auditorium to attend a concert or a lecture, and there
  was a genial buzz of admiration and interest when the deans and their wives
  came in, and the ranking professors of large renown attended by well-gowned
  spouses, Marcia would wonder how it might feel to be the object of such
  attention.</p>

  <p>It had now begun to look as if all this might some time come to pass. Paul
  had it in him, and he had been lucky enough to put himself in line for
  advancement. And it wasn't, Marcia kept telling herself, that she merely
  wanted to gratify her own vanity and cuddle the thrill of these flattering
  preferments. No; she coveted them for the children's sake. It was no small
  matter, the social advantages accruing to the families of distinguished
  professors. There was Roberta, for instance. Sally, no doubt, would contrive
  to make friends, but Roberta would be all the better off for some sort of
  propulsion.</p>

  <p>Seated on the veranda of the cottage, with a writing-pad on her knee,
  Marcia was in the very act of telling Paul again how happy she was over the
  fine place he had been making for himself&mdash;and all of them. She pictured
  him, she wrote, sitting at his desk in the living-room (which she did hope
  was not too uncomfortable on these hot days) doing the book that was to give
  him another boost in the esteem of the University.</p>

  <p>At that juncture, Wallie, who had been down to the village post-office,
  rode up across the brown lawn on his bicycle, expertly tossed a letter in her
  lap, and resumed his progress towards the dusty road. The letter was brief.
  Edmund Spenser had been carefully stowed away for the present. And work had
  been started again on the refrigerator.</p>

  <p>Now we were to have all this misery to endure, once more. It would be the
  same old story, of course. Something would happen to make a fizzle of it. The
  whole summer would be squandered, the book would be left unfinished, Paul
  would be plunged into a fit of moody sulking. He would go into the autumn
  semester tired, beaten, uninterested.</p>

  <p>Marcia started her letter again.</p>

  <p>"I <i>do most sincerely</i> wish you well, Paul," she began, "but what a
  lot of agony you have had in trying to do something you have admitted you did
  not know how to do! And what a lot of agony we have <i>all</i> had in waiting
  and watching while you used yourself up with schemes that <i>never came to
  anything!</i> I know, dear, that you're trying to make us rich&mdash;but
  <i>this isn't the way!</i> You've been doing <i>so well</i> at the
  University. Now&mdash;well&mdash;I just hate to think of going through all
  this again! It really isn't fair to you! And if you don't mind my saying so,
  <i>it isn't fair to me!"...</i> And a great deal more like that.</p>

  <p>The letter was far too long. Composed in haste, it carried many redundant
  passages, disclosing the untidiness of Marcia's thoughts, and had a tendency
  to be somewhat shrill in spots.</p>

  <p>When Paul received it, next morning at eleven, in the attic where he was
  cutting threads on the end of a short section of copper pipe, he hastily read
  all but the last three pages, merely leafing them through with the feeling
  that their contents&mdash;judging from the plenitude of underscoring and
  exclamation points&mdash;were but some more of the same thing, in crescendo.
  He folded the bulky letter, rather mussily, and tried to thrust it into his
  shirt-pocket. Failing to find suitable accommodation for it there, he tossed
  it towards a table which it missed.</p>

  <p>Hannah, tarrying to learn his wishes about luncheon, if any&mdash;for he
  didn't always stop to eat&mdash;noted the short work he made of the letter
  and noted also the dark frown.</p>

  <p>"Can't say that I blame her," muttered Paul, as if Hannah knew.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;you really can't," she said intuitively. "Mrs Ward has been very
  patient."</p>

  <p>"She thinks I'm just wasting my time again. A bit upset, I fear." He gave
  the heavy wrench another vigorous twist. "I don't believe I'll bother her
  with any more talk about it until it's done. It won't be long now."</p>

  <p>"How about a cold roast beef sandwich? You can eat that without stopping
  your work."</p>

  <p>"I don't blame her a damn' bit! She can't be expected to understand."</p>

  <p>"Sandwich?" repeated Hannah, retreating to the head of the stairs.</p>

  <p>"Of course&mdash;if it's time... No, no&mdash;I don't want any now."</p>

  <p>Hannah returned to the kitchen slowly. For a little while she debated the
  advisability of writing Mrs Ward a letter expressing her own enthusiasm over
  what he was doing; but decided against it. No matter how prudently the letter
  was written, Mrs Ward might suspect Paul had confided something about her
  feelings on the subject, in which case it would probably have exactly the
  wrong effect.</p>

  <p>The little episode, seemingly unimportant when viewed by itself,
  distressed Hannah greatly. It wasn't that she had the slightest fear of
  Paul's suddenly barging out to find&mdash;in something or somebody&mdash;the
  equivalent of the stimulating encouragement which Mrs Ward had not provided.
  Hannah's anxiety was for the future. Paul Ward was now probably on the way to
  a kind of success that would make him very well-to-do. It would increase his
  liberty and his leisure. If Marcia Ward had the good judgment to keep abreast
  of him and go with him, hand in hand, into their new privileges, she might
  easily keep his devotion. But if she was going to write him any more scratchy
  letters, at a time when he was on a tension and fairly killing himself with
  hard work&mdash;well&mdash;it might turn out badly.</p>

  <p>At all events, she herself could stand by and see that he was fed. He
  hadn't noticed that she had stayed on without taking her customary Thursdays.
  The days were all alike to Paul. He didn't know when Thursday came, or Sunday
  either.</p>

  <p>On a Wednesday night in mid-August, Paul came down to the kitchen at ten,
  and announced that he was leaving the next night for Chicago to consult a
  patent lawyer who had been strongly recommended to him. He might be gone for
  two or three days.</p>

  <p>"It's all done, then?" asked Hannah, wide-eyed with interest.</p>

  <p>"Almost.... Far enough.... I know that I've done it. The rest is very
  simple&mdash;mere details concerning the design of the cabinet."</p>

  <p>"How long would it take to finish the whole job?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, a week, maybe."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you finish it?" entreated Hannah. "You remember what happened
  when you grew impatient before. It would be simply awful if anything happened
  to it, this time!"</p>

  <p>She was putting things on the porcelain table&mdash;sliced ham, cheese,
  fruit&mdash;and the coffee-pot was bubbling.</p>

  <p>"Please!" she begged.</p>

  <p>"Oh, very well," consented Paul, half annoyed, but drawing a grin. "After
  all&mdash;you're mostly right about things, Hannah."</p>

  <p>"Would you mind very much if I took my day off to-morrow?" asked Hannah,
  after he had stowed away a few mouthfuls.</p>

  <p>"Of course not. Run along&mdash;and have a good time. How is Peter, by the
  way?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't seen him for a month."</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;you've not had a day off for a month?" Paul's face
  wrinkled into an amusing expression of incredulity. Hannah laughed.</p>

  <p>"I thought I'd stay by the works," she said gently.</p>

  <p>"Well, Hannah," declared Paul, with a dramatic gesture, "when the roll is
  called up yonder, you'll be there!"</p>

  <p>"Thanks," she replied dryly. "You too, I hope." Her lips curved into the
  well-known puckery smile. "Now that you know how to make your own ice, I
  don't suppose you need care much where your name is called."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>She did not go to Waterloo that day. Unexpected, Hannah arrived at the
  lake cottage shortly before noon, having travelled eighty miles by train and
  ten by bus, carrying along a capacious basket containing a baked ham, a jar
  of pickled peaches, and several glasses of newly made jelly.</p>

  <p>The children were overjoyed to see her, and Mrs Ward, rather mystified
  over this visitation, waited with considerable impatience for an opportune
  moment to ease her natural curiosity. When luncheon was over and the children
  had gone to the beach, Marcia said, "Do tell me why you came, Hannah. I know
  you have some special reason."</p>

  <p>They went out on the veranda and Marcia took up the little tapestry that
  busied her restless fingers through these days of waiting and wondering.</p>

  <p>"Mrs Ward," began Hannah soberly, "I am always poking my nose into other
  people's business. That's probably because I haven't any of my own. Mr Ward
  does not know I have come here to-day. It's about him."</p>

  <p>Marcia stiffened perceptibly, and a slow flush crept up her cheek.</p>

  <p>"Indeed?" she said, not very encouragingly. "I hope it isn't anything you
  shouldn't be telling me."</p>

  <p>Hannah smiled briefly, confusedly, and replied: "Yes&mdash;I hope that,
  too. You see&mdash;Mr Ward has practically completed his big invention. Only
  a few more days of it and he will be going to Chicago to begin business on
  his patent."</p>

  <p>"You don't tell me, Hannah!" exclaimed Marcia. "Is it actually going to
  work?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. No doubt about it. He has been keeping it a sort of&mdash;surprise
  for you."</p>

  <p>"Then why are you telling me?" demanded Marcia. "He'll not like that."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;I don't think he'll mind. He has worked very hard. Every day,
  and day and night, sometimes. It has been a wonderful experience. He has
  hardly been out of the house for weeks."</p>

  <p>"The poor dear," murmured Marcia. "He didn't tell me he was working so
  hard."</p>

  <p>"And quite lonesome, too. No one to talk with but me." Hannah brightened
  and edged her chair a little closer. "It just occurred to me last night, Mrs
  Ward, how fine it would be for him if you were there&mdash;even for a
  day&mdash;to be with him and make an awful big fuss over him&mdash;when he
  puts the last finishing touch on this thing.... That's why I came."</p>

  <p>Marcia coolly studied Hannah's eyes for a long moment.</p>

  <p>"Are you trying to say to me that I've neglected my duty?" she asked,
  stressing her words.</p>

  <p>And Hannah amazed both Marcia and herself by replying, evenly,
  "Yes&mdash;Mrs Ward&mdash;that's what I'm trying to say."</p>

  <p>"You're&mdash;you're&mdash;taking a good deal of liberty; don't you
  think?" Marcia's voice was unsteady.</p>

  <p>"I know, Mrs Ward. I thought of that. Perhaps you'll not be wanting me,
  any more. But&mdash;I thought I ought to tell you. I see that I've just
  bungled things&mdash;but I meant it all right."</p>

  <p>There was a long silence.</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Hannah," said Marcia thickly. "I'll go back with you."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;if you don't mind my saying so, Mrs Ward, you'd better let me go
  first. You can come to-morrow. I think it would be better if you just dropped
  in&mdash;as a surprise, you know."</p>

  <p>"That's good. We were coming in next week, anyway. We'll pack up and go
  home to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Hannah shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;you come&mdash;alone. Surprise him. Without the children."</p>

  <p>"But I can't leave them here alone!"</p>

  <p>"You can send me out to take care of them. You get there at noon and tell
  me to start at once. I can be here by dinner-time. Then you can get Mr Ward's
  meals for a couple of days and let him tell you all about everything he has
  been doing."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Hannah," said Marcia, softly. "And forgive me, please, for not
  understanding. You are a good friend."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Paul was on his knees, fitting the lower door-hinge when there were steps
  on the attic stairs. He did not turn from his work, but asked absently, "Time
  to eat again, Hannah?"</p>

  <p>Marcia put down the tray on the table, tiptoed across the room, and put
  both hands over his eyes.</p>

  <p>He reached for them, kissed them, and turning about rose and took her in
  his arms.</p>

  <p>"Darling!" he whispered. "You came!"</p>

  <p>"I couldn't stay away any longer, dear," murmured Marcia.</p>

  <p>"Did you bring the children?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I have sent Hannah out to look after them."</p>

  <p>"I've done it, Marcia! It's a great thing! We'll be rich!"</p>

  <p>"I'm glad, dear. But all I want now is <i>you!"</i></p>

  <p>"And we'll travel&mdash;and do all the things we've ever wanted to
  do."</p>

  <p>"It's wonderful, Paul!" She drew him more tightly to her. "But&mdash;just
  now&mdash;I can't think about anything but the happiness of seeing
  <i>you!"</i></p>

  <p>"And we'll be <i>free!"</i></p>

  <p>Marcia snuggled close and sought his lips again.</p>

  <p>"I'm so glad to be back with you," she whispered.</p>

  <p>"From now on, darling," said Paul firmly, "you can have anything you
  want."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch09"
     id="ch09">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN, on the eleventh day of December, negotiations had been
  completed, Paul and Marcia made a solemn agreement not to commit any more
  extravagances until the money was actually in hand. The manufacturing firm's
  name was on the dotted line, but they had been fooled once and were not to be
  taken in again.</p>

  <p>This pledge they made to each other over their champagne glasses in a
  high-class speak-easy in Chicago. It was an unaccustomed beverage, esteemed
  for its ability to inspire optimism and relieve anxiety. But it had not
  produced that effect on Marcia. She glowed, but it was with the glow of love
  for her husband who must be protected from any more of the worries that had
  made his life hard to bear. And Paul, also pleasantly jingled, was in a mood
  to gratify any wish of his uncommonly attractive wife who had never seemed so
  desirable as now. So they softly touched glasses across the dinner-table and
  swore by their love for each other that there would be no unnecessary
  spending until they could pay cash on the spot.</p>

  <p>It didn't occur to either of them that there was anything funny about such
  a promise made at a little <i>tête-à-tête</i> dinner where the cheque
  totalled twenty-three dollars and seventy-five cents, for this event in their
  fretted lives deserved celebration.</p>

  <p>Paul had left home on Friday night. Because he had no classes on Saturday
  he could conscientiously spend the day in Chicago transacting his important
  business. And when it was discovered that Monday, too, would be needed for
  the completion of the deal, he had wired Marcia to meet him.</p>

  <p>Long ago they had resolved that come what may they would never jeopardize
  Paul's life insurance by borrowing against it. On this occasion, however, it
  seemed imperative&mdash;and safe enough. In fact, it was the only way he
  could raise the thousand dollars required to pay the attorneys' fees and
  other expenses involved in the securing of his patent rights. While he was
  about it, Paul made the amount of the loan twelve hundred dollars, to leave a
  comfortable margin for whatever other costs bobbed up in connection with the
  momentous affair. In this state of affluence, he wired, she came, and, the
  business having been concluded at four, the honeymooners dined, communed,
  pledged, and were immensely satisfied with themselves.</p>

  <p>It was just a bit difficult to go back home and take up things where they
  had put them down. Marcia had insisted&mdash;and very properly, Paul
  thought&mdash;that there should be a minimum of talk before the children on
  the subject of their good fortune. But the topic was hard to avoid. The
  youngsters could easily remember how nearly the family had come to an
  achievement of wealth four years ago, and their instinct informed them that
  this time the thing had been actually accomplished. Indeed, Paul had frankly
  admitted to them that he had succeeded in his project, warning them it would
  be "a long time yet" before there would be anything in the nature of a
  reward. They were not to talk about it. But the delightful mystery was on
  their minds, nevertheless.</p>

  <p>"When are you going down to look at that car, Dad?" Wallie was inquiring
  in an impatient tone that made Roberta snicker, for whenever Wallie was
  exasperated his voice, then in the embarrassing stage of registering in a
  lower clef, had a tendency to skid. Such minor misfortunes always amused
  Roberta, whose sense of humour was slightly acidulous.</p>

  <p>"No hurry about that, my boy," Paul would reply with patriarchal calm,
  "and it would please me if you stopped haunting the automobile show-rooms.
  The dealers are becoming very persistent. It seems that they are under the
  impression we are in the market for a car, which is entirely incorrect. I
  hope you will keep this in mind."</p>

  <p>Marcia faithfully kept her end of the bargain in respect to the normal
  pursuit of their programme of frugality, but her trips into the shopping
  district were more frequent. Her bed, daytimes, was strewn with illustrated
  magazines devoted to period furniture and interior decorating. Sometimes she
  would ask Roberta, whose eye for art was precociously experienced, "How do
  you like those drapes? Isn't that a gorgeous chair? What do you think of the
  lamp?" And Roberta, hovering over the pictures, would express an opinion,
  though it didn't often coincide with her mother's. "When is all this going to
  happen?" she would inquire, to which Marcia would reply, absently,
  "Oh&mdash;sometime&mdash;maybe."</p>

  <p>Hannah was not very much surprised over their reticence to confide in her
  concerning their prospects. Paul had briefly told her that the manufacturing
  rights had been assigned, also that they were to receive an advance payment
  on February eleventh, after which there was to be a royalty. But he did not
  tell her how much. She was not displeased or hurt. There was almost nothing
  about Paul Ward that she did not understand. When he was worried or beaten,
  she could depend on his coming to her for counsel and comfort. When again
  confident and contented, he didn't need her, and it became him to conduct
  himself with a master-of-the-house dignity in his attitude towards their
  maid-of-all-work. It wasn't the first time she had sustained that sort of
  relation to an employer. She remembered how Mrs Raymond, in a moment of
  complete let-down over Philip's sorry plight, would cling to her and weep; an
  hour afterward resuming their mistress-maid relationship, with a little added
  crispness to assure them both that business was now carrying on as usual.
  Hannah did not resent it; she thrilled under it. That was the way things
  ought to be. Otherwise, you couldn't expect to have any discipline in your
  house, at all. No&mdash;Paul Ward didn't owe her a full explanation of his
  private affairs. He would tell her some time, no doubt; especially if it
  didn't work out.</p>

  <p>But it was becoming more and more evident that the Wards were about to
  assume a new mode of living. Mrs Ward moved about with the self-contained air
  of a woman satisfactorily related to all her engagements, and, while Paul
  exhibited no bumptious arrogance, his eyes were now those of a man who could
  look anybody in the world squarely in the face and suggest a suitable
  destination. Hannah hoped the children would not be spoiled and was pleased
  to note that their prospects hadn't altered their habits, so far. Sally had
  said, one day after school, "We're going to have a bigger house, some day
  soon. Won't that be fun?"</p>

  <p>"I hope so," Hannah had replied guardedly. "But I like this one very well,
  don't you?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I want a big yard with trees and lots of flowers and a room of
  my own. We'll have to get more help, won't we, Hannah? I asked Mother, and
  she said she supposed so. And I asked her if you would still cook, and she
  said perhaps not. And I asked her if you would be the housekeeper and she
  said maybe you wouldn't feel like trying to manage a big house. But you'd
  know how; wouldn't you, Hannah?"</p>

  <p>"We can figure that all out, dear, when the time comes," replied Hannah,
  after a reminiscent pause.</p>

  <p>"Mother says I mustn't talk to anyone about it, but it's hard not to,
  'specially when somebody comes to school with a new dress. I always want to
  say, 'Pooh!&mdash;you just wait!'"</p>

  <p>"Yes," sighed Hannah, "that's the main trouble with having money. It makes
  people want to say 'Pooh'. And mostly they're a little too decent to say it,
  but they keep thinking it and wanting to say it until their mouths and noses
  get a sort of poohy expression."</p>

  <p>"I'm not poohy yet, am I, Hannah?"</p>

  <p>"Come here&mdash;and I'll look."</p>

  <p>Sally obediently crossed the room and leaned against the arm of Hannah's
  chair.</p>

  <p>"No, dear, there's no sign of it yet." Hannah made the announcement
  deliberately, after pretending a serious examination. She smiled, and Sally
  kissed her on the cheek.</p>

  <p>"Will you tell me, Hannah, if you ever see one coming on?"</p>

  <p>"That's not so easy as it sounds, Sally. People can do a great deal to
  avoid these poohs, but once they come, they're hard to cure."</p>

  <p>Sally was meditative for a while and helped herself to another warm
  cooky.</p>

  <p>"But you really have to be very rich, don't you, before you can pooh
  enough for people to notice it? Maybe we won't have that much."</p>

  <p>"No," replied Hannah, after some consideration, "you can pooh without
  having any money at all. There are several different kinds. I don't know that
  I ever thought much about this before, but wouldn't you say that a man who is
  big and strong might be tempted to pooh at men not so tall and well-muscled?
  That might be called 'muscle-pooh'."</p>

  <p>"And there's 'college-pooh,'" laughed Sally, pleased to assist promptly.
  "You get that when you know a lot more than anybody else."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," agreed Hannah, "and the 'clever-pooh', when you're very quick
  and witty. When you begin talking about how stupid almost everybody else is,
  then you're soon going to have a 'clever-pooh' fastened on your nose for
  keeps. I think we've named them all now, dear, and if you eat any more of
  those cookies you're going to spoil your dinner."</p>

  <p>"You've forgotten the 'I'm-very-good' pooh, Hannah. That's the worst one,
  isn't it&mdash;the 'being-good' pooh?"</p>

  <p>"If it is," teased Hannah, <i>"you</i> won't need to worry about it."</p>

  <p>"I know what you're wanting to say, Hannah. Something about the
  'pretty-pooh'."</p>

  <p>Hannah chuckled dryly.</p>

  <p>"You won't need to fret about that one either, Sally, if whoever borrowed
  your nailbrush doesn't return it very soon."</p>

  <p>"That hurts my feelings, Hannah." Sally pretended a pout.</p>

  <p>"You'd better take them upstairs, then, and give them a good scrubbing,
  and put a nice clean dress on them. You're dirty as a little pig."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Paul couldn't remember ever having had quite so interesting an experience
  as on the day when he deposited his big cheque in his current account at the
  Farmers and Mechanics Bank.</p>

  <p>He hadn't actually overdrawn his account for all of six months, having
  been so sharply reprimanded for it the last time that he had determined never
  to let it happen again. But his balance, when he deposited his monthly
  cheques, was always so small it made him ashamed. He hated to go to the bank.
  He began to feel wormy and shabby and wretched even before he pushed open the
  heavy door. The cashier, Mr Wexler&mdash;a lean, stooped, steely-eyed
  fellow&mdash;never quite snubbed him, but his salutation was so dry it
  crackled.</p>

  <p>This February morning Paul entered the bank conscious of an accelerated
  pulse, carefully on guard against displaying any change in his habitual
  demeanour, trying to feel and, therefore, look as small and worthless as
  usual. The illusion was not so difficult to execute; there had been a heavy
  thaw, and his soggy, burdensome galoshes gave him the heel-dragging shamble
  of one taking his place at the end of the bread-line. He went to the second
  of the tall lobby-desks, helped himself to a deposit-slip, wrote the date,
  his name, and&mdash;opposite the tabulation for cheques&mdash;"25,000.00".
  Then he endorsed his deposit and carried the slip and the cheque, one in each
  hand, to Mr Wexler's window; put them down, fished in his pocket for his
  passbook, and waited interestedly for something to happen.</p>

  <p>He had lived through this moment many times, of late, in anticipation. It
  was entirely possible the cashier might say, "Well, well, indeed! And what
  have we here? Congratulations, Professor Ward, I'm sure! Well,
  well!"&mdash;and push two fingers under the bars for whatever shaking might
  be done. And Paul had determined not to be cajoled by any of this tardy
  cordiality. They had made him suffer and cringe and feel like a skunk. All
  very well. But if they had a notion they could mend their insults by
  soft-soaping him now that he had some money, they had another guess coming.
  It had occurred to him that Mr Wexley might say, "If you have the time, Mr
  Ward, let me take you back to Mr Trimble's office. I know he will want to
  shake hands." And then Paul meant to drag out his watch and beg to be
  excused. "Some other time," he would remark indifferently.</p>

  <p>Now he had put down his big cheque and the slip and the passbook.</p>

  <p>Mr Wexler picked up the cheque, turned it over, turned it back again,
  whacked it with a rubber-stamp, and impaled it on a long, sharp spike.</p>

  <p>"'Morning, Mr Ward," he rasped, while spiking the cheque. "Wet day."</p>

  <p>"And a cheque-book, please," said Paul.</p>

  <p>Mr Wexler tossed one out, and remarked dryly, "Better not begin drawing on
  this until it's cleared, Mr Ward."</p>

  <p>Paul flushed angrily. "If you think there's something the matter with it,"
  he growled, "give it back to me. And I'll not put you to any further
  anxiety."</p>

  <p>"Sorry, Mr Ward," crackled Mr Wexler. "The bank has received it for
  collection."</p>

  <p>"Then I'll thank you, sir, to close my account, and give me the bank's
  cheque for what I have in here. I don't like your attitude."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you'll have to wait, Mr Ward," drawled Wexler, "until this
  paper has gone through the clearing-house. If you insist, I can hand you back
  what you already had in your account here. Please wait a moment." The cashier
  left his cage and sauntered back to the bookkeeping department, while Paul
  drummed impatiently on the window-ledge, scowling darkly. Presently he
  returned, punctiliously wrote out a receipt, pushed it through the wicket,
  offered a pen, and Paul scrawled his name on the bottom line certifying that
  he had drawn out his previous balance in full. And Mr Wexler, having pushed
  several levers on his money-machine, handing his irate customer seven dollars
  and eighty-six cents.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," snarled Paul, turning away.</p>

  <p>"Better leave your passbook," said Mr Wexler. "We will mail you the
  proceeds of this Chicago cheque when we get it. Good-day, sir."</p>

  <p>"Damned shabby treatment," protested Paul, his voice a bit unsteady.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, Mr Ward. Business is business. Regret to lose your account,
  but&mdash;you asked for your money back. And I gave it to you."</p>

  <p>By this time three or four customers were growing interested while they
  waited their turn, and Paul, observing their curiosity, left the window and
  walked out of the place in a grand state of wrath. So&mdash;business was
  business, eh?... And then it began to occur to him that this was really the
  first time in his life he had ever <i>done</i> any business. The little
  exchanges of money for food and clothes&mdash;that sort of thing wasn't
  business. Trotting shamefacedly to the bank on the first of every month to
  deposit a salary of $188.33, and then checking it all out but a handful of
  small change by the tenth of the month&mdash;that wasn't business as the
  insufferable Wexler thought of "business". Paul began to wonder if he hadn't
  been an ass. He was really going to be in business now, and should be
  deporting himself like a business man. Wexler would probably tell the story
  of his large indignation to his banker friends, and they would laugh.</p>

  <p>After he had walked the half-dozen blocks to the post-office, where he
  laid in a supply of stamps, Paul retraced his steps to the bank, waited his
  turn at the cashier's window, and said grimly: "Mr Wexler, I made a little
  mistake here a while ago. I fear I was rude. I beg your pardon. I've never
  had occasion to do very much business. Perhaps I'll learn. I would like to
  continue my account here, please."</p>

  <p>Mr Wexler's thin lips twisted into a fair imitation of a grin. He pushed a
  couple of fingers under the grating.</p>

  <p>"Attaboy," he drawled.</p>

  <p>Paul squeezed the Wexler knuckles and walked out of the bank glowing with
  an immense satisfaction. He was now a business man in good and regular
  standing. It did not occur to him that if Wexler meant to tell the story at
  all, it was a still better one than it had been fifteen minutes earlier.
  Walking through the slush was difficult, but Paul decided not to take a
  street-car. Ordinarily he rode. As he plodded along, four street-cars passed
  him, all going in his direction. It was fun to walk when you knew you had
  money enough in the bank to buy a dozen of their damned little street-cars,
  if you wanted to. He tried to examine his own attitude in respect to this
  matter.</p>

  <p>For instance, he needed a new hat. Marcia had been telling him to buy one.
  If he had been strapped, the chances were he would have bought a hat to-day.
  Now that he could have all the hats in town, the old one was plenty good, for
  the present. He wondered if having money made a man stingy and careless about
  his appearance.</p>

  <p>Marcia met him at the door, her face smilingly inquisitive. He kissed her
  warmly.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;what did they think at the snooty old bank when you turned up
  with <i>twenty-five thousand dollars?"</i> Marcia stressed the words as
  impressively as if she were saying "a million".</p>

  <p>Paul chuckled, tossed the old hat aside, peeled off his overcoat, and
  slipped an arm around Marcia's waist.</p>

  <p>"You ought to have seen 'em," he said, in a tone implying that all the
  mean little indignities of the past had now been amply avenged. "Old Wexler
  poked his fingers through the bars and said 'Attaboy!'&mdash;just like
  that."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>They were amazed at the speed with which negotiations were completed for
  the new home at Marcellus Avenue. Buying a house had always seemed an
  adventure to be approached with caution and after wide investigation. When
  the time came for them to buy, they would look at every desirable house in
  town, weigh and balance them against one another, and arrive at a deliberate
  decision. Marcia had called up Mr Chalmers. She tried to make her query sound
  diffident to ensure against an excess of zeal and anticipation on the part of
  the realtor, but there was enough confidence in her tone, if not in her
  actual words, to fetch Mr Chalmers out in his shiny new car immediately after
  lunch.</p>

  <p>Paul had classes that afternoon, but he could see the house later, Mr
  Chalmers said. He wanted Mrs Ward to inspect it at once because it was really
  a wonderful buy and would not remain on the market very long. The Haywoods
  had owned it only a year. Now they had been required to move to Chicago. It
  was declared Mr Chalmers, just the thing for the Wards; eleven-room colonial,
  four baths, two-car garage, spacious grounds, ornamental shrubbery, exquisite
  interior decoration practically new. Softly purring the inventory of this
  remarkable property, Mr Chalmers conveyed Marcia to it, driving more slowly
  as they entered Marcellus Avenue, directing her attention to the quality of
  the neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>The snow was melted now, except for dirty patches of it on the cold side
  of walls and trees. Marcia could visualize the beauty of the lawn, the
  lilacs, the laurel. A little tremor of delight swept her while Mr Chalmers
  was fumbling with his huge bunch of keys. The front entrance was most
  imposing. It was easy to picture Paul and herself greeting their guests in
  this impressive hallway. She strolled about through the house, her heels
  echoing on the well-waxed hardwood floors. With her finger-tips pressed
  thoughtfully against her lips she stood on the second-floor landing, facing
  the open doors to commodious bedchambers, assigning them to the various
  members of the family. A guest-room, too. Doubtless they would be having
  guests frequently now.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it's more than we can pay," reflected Marcia. "We had not
  planned on such a large house." It wasn't true. They had idealized the big
  house they meant to have, some day, until it was at least the size of the
  Administration Building at the University. "I'm afraid to have you tell me
  how much it costs," added Marcia, hoping this apprehension of hers might move
  Mr Chalmers to be merciful.</p>

  <p>Of course you couldn't expect to own a house like this unless you had some
  money, Mr Chalmers admitted; but once you owned it you would really
  <i>have</i> something. The steady expense of minor repairs, which one had
  expected in a cheap, jerry-built house, usually ate up the first-cost
  difference between a good house and a bad one. Take this plumbing, for
  example, and this heating plant; take the extra half-ton of mineral wool in
  the walls&mdash;all these things cost money, to be sure, but once you had
  them in your house, you were spared the bother and expense of repairs.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Marcia, "I see that. How much is it?"</p>

  <p>He kept her dangling a little longer and finally announced it was to be
  had for twenty-three thousand, half of which must be paid in cash. Mr Haywood
  needed the money. That's why the price was low. Somebody would be wanting it
  promptly at that ridiculous figure.</p>

  <p>Marcia frowned, shook her head, turned a hopeless little smile towards Mr
  Chalmers, but continued her excursion, mentally placing furniture&mdash;most
  of which would be new&mdash;and planning window-drapes to match the paper.
  After that she spent a long time opening drawers and cabinets in the kitchen
  and butler's pantry.</p>

  <p>"We'll have to wait and see what Mr Ward thinks of it," said Marcia. "I'm
  almost sure he will say it is more than we should try to invest." She wasn't
  sure of any such thing. In fact, she was quite confident Paul would want to
  buy the house on the spot. It never took him long to come to a
  conclusion.</p>

  <p>Next day, Paul having enthused over the purchase, they signed the papers,
  drew the cheque, and were driven home in a high state of exultation. Now that
  it was all over and Mr Chalmers couldn't boost the price, there was no
  occasion for further dissembling: they were almost hysterically gay.</p>

  <p>"I have a little surprise for you, Marcia," said Paul, in a low tone, when
  they were back in their room. "I've bought a sedan."</p>

  <p>"How wonderful! But can we do it all&mdash;house, furniture, car?"</p>

  <p>"Why not? We'll be having more money in a few months. Might as well make
  some good use of it. We've waited plenty long."</p>

  <p>That night Paul strolled out to the kitchen for a word with Hannah. He had
  postponed this talk from day to day until he was having some misgivings over
  his tardiness to confide in her. The stark truth was that Hannah had had a
  very important part in providing them with their new fortune. Surely she had
  a right to know something about their plans.</p>

  <p>Hannah welcomed him to her domain without a trace of rebuke in her tone or
  manner, even offering him a hand over the stile by remarking, "I haven't seen
  much of you lately, Mr Ward, but I know it's because you have been awfully
  busy. Are things going all right?"</p>

  <p>Once he had decided to tell Hannah where they stood and what they intended
  to do, he left nothing undisclosed, reporting on the purchase of the new
  house and the automobile, adding, "And of course we will have to buy new
  furniture."</p>

  <p>Hannah put down her knitting when he came to a full stop, and said: "I
  think it's fine for you to have these things. You've surely earned them. They
  will bring you a great deal of pleasure, provided&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Paul glanced up anxiously and waited for the proviso.</p>

  <p>"Provided you do not let yourself in for a lot of expenses that will worry
  you. It has often occurred to me," continued Hannah, meditatively, "that
  people ought to decide exactly what bracket they think they're in,
  financially, and then try to&mdash;to work in that bracket. For example, if I
  want to buy some new spring clothes, and have only twenty dollars to invest,
  I'd better not spend twelve dollars for a new hat and five dollars for shoes
  which would leave me only three dollars for a dress. A three-dollar hat might
  set off a twelve-dollar dress very nicely. But an expensive hat worn with a
  cheap dress not only makes the dress dowdy, but makes the hat look silly too.
  Do you see what I mean?"</p>

  <p>Paul thought he saw what she meant and nodded approval.</p>

  <p>"If this new home," Hannah went on judiciously, "is to cost twenty-three
  thousand, then the stuff that goes into it will have to be of the same
  general quality if you're going to be happy in it. You can't fill your house
  with cheap things. And if you have a large flower-garden and a big lawn,
  you'll have to plan on extra expenses for water and work, or it will shame
  you."</p>

  <p>"You're on the trail of a good idea, Hannah." Paul smiled indulgently.
  "You think people should adopt a definite scale of living and not let an
  extravagant hat play the deuce with a cheap pair of shoes."</p>

  <p>"Precisely&mdash;only I'm not thinking quite so much about what the hat
  does to the shoes as I am about what the shoes do to the hat&mdash;making it
  look ridiculous. People wouldn't grin when they looked at the shoes. It's the
  <i>hat</i> that would amuse them."</p>

  <p>"Think we shouldn't have bought the sedan?" Paul's face was sober.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I don't think that. But seventeen hundred and fifty dollars was
  a good deal to pay for it. I suppose you were right though. You couldn't very
  well leave a cheap car sitting out in front of a fine house.... What worries
  me is: Are you going to have enough money left, after buying all these
  things, to pay for the cost of running them? Maybe you are. I hope so.
  But&mdash;I'd keep it in mind if I were you."</p>

  <p>Paul kept it in mind for a day or two, but realized that he was now riding
  a tiger and had better try to stay on. Marcia was having the time of her
  life, shopping for the new equipment of the wonderful house. He couldn't
  summon the courage to caution her. After all&mdash;you really couldn't blame
  her for wanting to furnish the house tastefully, consistently. Even Hannah
  thought that, and she was a veritable authority on thrift. Of course Hannah
  would have started with a less expensive house and then trimmed things to
  fit. Hannah had evolved an interesting philosophy on this subject. Paul had
  thought it quite obvious that a fifteen-dollar chair, flanking a
  three-hundred-dollar davenport, would look absurd. In Hannah's opinion it was
  the <i>davenport</i> that would look absurd. New idea. Very like Hannah to
  have such a whimsy. She had even pointed her views on this matter by adding,
  "If a man talks much about high ideals, and then shows shabby conduct, it
  isn't his conduct that draws a sour laugh from his friends: it's his
  <i>ideals.</i>"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>They moved into the new house in May. Many of the things had to be
  ordered, involving delays, and the drapes and broadloom rugs took time. In
  spite of all the distractions, Paul was attentive to his University
  obligations. He had wondered a little whether his windfall would alter his
  relations to his friends of the faculty. They seemed singularly unimpressed,
  joked him about it briefly, Sandy Laughton observing dryly, "Now you can have
  a pair of suspenders for every pair of pants." The remark, inconsequential as
  it was, deterred Paul from ordering more than one spring suit. He resolved
  that there would be no change in his personal mode of living. And it was easy
  to see, by the attitude of his friends, that his good sense and good taste
  had been noted.</p>

  <p>Now they were making plans for the summer. Marcia had determined to send
  Roberta to a girls' camp in the Adirondacs. Lucy Trimble was returning to the
  camp this season, and Roberta, exhilarated with Lucy's report of last year's
  experiences, talked of little else than her wish to join the camp. Marcia had
  ventured to call up Mrs Trimble and was delighted over the cordiality of the
  bank president's wife, Mrs Trimble assuring her that there could be no better
  place for a thirteen-year-old girl than Camp Minnewonkapotamie.</p>

  <p>There was so much talk about this that Wallie also became interested in
  the camp project and was soon booked to go with a score of well-to-do
  Mid-Western youngsters to a lake in Minnesota. The rates were steep, Paul
  thought, but Marcia believed Wallie would be in safer company in a camp that
  cost a little more&mdash;a theory which sounded plausible enough, but in fact
  didn't have a leg to stand on, as they were to discover later.</p>

  <p>Paul had already promised his manufacturers that he would spend the first
  two weeks of July in consultation with their engineers and it was understood
  that Marcia would accompany him to Chicago.</p>

  <p>Sally, quite carried away with the early results of her planting in the
  small flower-garden staked off as her exclusive plot, had shown no interest
  in joining a camping party, considerably to her father's relief; for if they
  didn't look out there would soon be no money left. It was amazing how rapidly
  you could dispose of twenty-five thousand dollars if you went about it
  heartily and had plenty of zealous operation on the part of your family.</p>

  <p>After everyone had gone away but Sally and Hannah, the house was going to
  be deliciously quiet. Marcia had experienced no qualms about leaving her
  youngest in such competent hands. Her sense of maternal obligation, however,
  prompted her to offer Sally a large portion of last-minute counsel.</p>

  <p>The train did not go until ten, which gave her an opportunity to see her
  baby safely tucked in for the night. Seated on the edge of the bed,
  energetically stroking the fingers of her new grey suède gloves, Marcia
  redundantly enjoined Sally to be a good child, to mind Hannah, and not play
  with children she didn't know. Sally yawned a promise of obedience and
  remarked that her mother's new silk suit was stunning, which was a fact.</p>

  <p>Paul put down the bags he was carrying, entered the room, stooped over the
  bed; and Sally, having half-strangled him with a farewell caress, begged to
  go down to the door and see them off. The parental decision on this matter
  being fifty-fifty, Sally cast the effective ballot, hopped out of bed, tugged
  on her dressing-gown, and scurried after them, the honk of the taxi having
  warned the travellers to bestir themselves. Transportation on the banister
  had been strongly discouraged, but in this emergency Sally felt it was
  justified. Her prompt arrival in the lower hall coincided embarrassingly with
  the entrance of the taxi-driver, who had come in for the baggage. Hannah, who
  had opened the door, endeavoured to rebuke her with a not very convincing
  frown. Marcia was annoyed.</p>

  <p>Taking Sally by the sleeve, she led her into the spacious living-room and
  said firmly, "I hope you will remember that in our absence you are the
  mistress of this house and are to act like a lady."</p>

  <p>Then there were hasty kisses, the taxi sputtered away, and Sally
  dignifiedly climbed the stairs. She was mistress of this house&mdash;and a
  lady. It was a pretty tall order, but she liked the novelty of it and went to
  sleep planning a programme of behaviour consistent with the new role she had
  undertaken.</p>

  <p>When the bell rang next morning Sally rose with unaccustomed alacrity and
  dressed with unprecedented care. Hannah, having heard the child moving about
  for twenty minutes, wondered what was up and called to her from the foot of
  the stairs, but Sally did not reply. It was, she felt, unbecoming of a lady
  to shout that she would be there in a minute. Besides, it wouldn't be true;
  for she wasn't ready.</p>

  <p>It had been Sally's intention to put on her very best dress, but on
  further deliberation this seemed rather affected, so early in the day.
  Rummaging in the closets she came upon a dress of Roberta's which hadn't been
  considered good enough to take along. Surveying herself in this more mature
  garment, Sally was pleased to note the effect of added height, though honesty
  compelled her to admit that the lines around the neck left something to be
  desired. She corrected this by putting on a large white jabot of her
  mother's. While finding the jabot, she had come upon a pair of long
  imitation-jade eardrops which, she felt, would also do quite nicely to set
  off the ensemble.</p>

  <p>With her small tongue bulging one cheek, Sally consulted the mirror for a
  report on the progress she was making in the adjustment of this jewellery,
  nervously hastening now, for Hannah had called again and would be popping up
  here presently to investigate.</p>

  <p>With much dignity Sally proceeded down the stairs and out into the
  dining-room where Hannah was in the act of putting down at her place the
  customary oatmeal, buttered toast, and chocolate. Wide-eyed with speechless
  amazement, Hannah drew back the chair, Sally stiffly accepting this attention
  with averted eyes, and sitting very straight.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, ma'am," said Hannah, in a muffled tone that stirred Sally's
  apprehensions.</p>

  <p>Turning her head slightly, she said, "Good morning, Hannah," kindly enough
  but remotely. With a deliberate gesture, suitable to her new calling, she
  took up her spoon. Feeling that it might be indiscreet to risk dribbling the
  oatmeal on her mother's jabot, she bent over her dish and one of the eardrops
  fell in.</p>

  <p>Hannah, who had bitten her lip almost to the blood, was determined to play
  her part in the drama if it killed her, but the misadventure of the
  insensitive eardrop hadn't been counted on. She retired hastily to the
  kitchen, aware that if she remained for another instant in Sally's presence
  there would be an explosion. No matter how well you thought you had yourself
  in hand, there were a few things that human flesh could not stand without a
  complete collapse.</p>

  <p>Closing the swinging door, Hannah leaned limply against the wall, both
  hands pressed hard against her ribs, and laughed until the tears ran down her
  cheeks.</p>

  <p>The table-bell tinkled. Resolutely pulling herself together, Hannah
  attended the summons. Sally glanced up briefly and said, in a low tone
  astonishingly like her mother's, "A small dish, Hannah, if you please."</p>

  <p>Hannah said, "Yes, ma'am," very respectfully and brought the dish into
  which Sally scooped a large spoonful of oatmeal-and-eardrop. Then she looked
  up again, directly into Hannah's eyes this time, for one really couldn't go
  on like this for ever without making sure how people felt about it.</p>

  <p>Their eyes having met, Hannah did the best she could, but the affair had
  now reached such proportions that she couldn't cope with it.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Sally, forgive me, darling," moaned Hannah, when she could speak. "I
  wanted to help you play it, dear, but&mdash;" She went off into another
  hysterical gale of laughter.</p>

  <p>Sally put her spoon down slowly and blinked back the tears. Then a
  self-conscious smile reluctantly curved her lips. And then, to Hannah's
  joyful relief, the embarrassed little girl chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Come here, baby," murmured Hannah, sinking into a chair. Sally slipped
  over into Hannah's lap. "You <i>are</i> a lady, dear. And Hannah's dreadfully
  sorry to have laughed."</p>

  <p>"It was awfully silly, wasn't it?" said Sally meekly. "Funny, too, I
  guess. Let me go, Hannah."</p>

  <p>In a few minutes she was downstairs again, wearing the brown overalls and
  floppy straw hat which served her as a garden costume. As she passed through
  the kitchen, she found Hannah deeply absorbed in a letter she had just
  received.</p>

  <p>"How do I look <i>now?"</i> demanded Sally, pausing for inspection, but
  Hannah did not reply. Her face was troubled and her hands trembled.
  Perplexed, Sally went down the back steps and out to her garden. She hoped
  nothing unpleasant had happened to Hannah.</p>

  <p>The disturbing letter had come by special delivery. It was from Lydia, who
  rarely had occasion to write. Hannah wondered if anything could be the matter
  with Peter.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">You will be surprised (began Lydia) to know that I have
  just heard from your friend, Mrs Adele Cooper Moore. Her husband died last
  winter in Paris and Mrs Moore has been in York New for two months. She has
  somehow managed to trace you to the University Hospital. The hospital people
  reported the birth of Peter and the fact that I took him, but they were
  unable to say what had become of <u>you.</u> She wants me to tell her where
  you are. Hints that she hopes you are free to come and be with her. She also
  speaks of a long cruise: perhaps she wants you as companion. At all events,
  she requests wired information about you. The letter is rather spluttery and
  seems to have been written in much excitement. What do you want me to say to
  her? Wish we could talk this over. Are you coming down Thursday? Peter is
  well. He and some other boys have a cave in the vacant lot back of the Wyman
  home. Spends most of his time there and comes in dirty beyond
  description.</p>

  <p class="letter">LYDIA</p><br>

  <p>Hannah carried the letter about from room to room, pausing to re-read it,
  her forehead wrinkled with perplexity. <i>Adele</i>&mdash;after all these
  years. And how had she contrived to follow her movements as far as the
  hospital? Who could have provided any of that information except Thomas? Her
  last letter to him had been posted from the Newcomb residence on Lake Shore
  Drive where she was working as a parlourmaid. Had Adele been talking to
  Thomas?</p>

  <p>Considerably shaken, Hannah went out through the kitchen, down the back
  steps, and slowly crossed the rear lawn to the far corner where Sally, in her
  brown overalls, was energetically wielding a small hoe.</p>

  <p>"Why do weeds grow faster than flowers, Hannah?" Sally's yellow curls were
  damp and her nose had taken on a fresh consignment of freckles.</p>

  <p>"Do they?" asked Hannah absently. "You mustn't work out here too long at a
  time, dear. You're <i>so</i> hot!... Sally, I've just had a letter from a
  friend of mine in Waterloo telling me something that makes me want to see
  her. I really ought to go there tomorrow. And, of course, I can't leave you
  here alone. Would you like to go with me?"</p>

  <p>Sally dropped the hoe and fanned her sunburned face with the floppy straw
  hat.</p>

  <p>"Sure&mdash;I'll go. It would be fun. Would we stay all night? Are we
  going on a train? Do you think Mother will care?"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>After the excitement of boarding the train had subsided, Sally fired a
  volley of questions to which Hannah replied, measuring her words with
  deliberation.</p>

  <p>"Her name is Mrs Lydia Edmunds, Sally, and she lives in a big brick house
  on a shady street. There is a large yard full of tall trees. You will like
  it, I think. Mrs Edmunds has lovely flowers. And you will see Peter Edmunds,
  who is about your age."</p>

  <p>Sally's nose elevated slightly.</p>

  <p>"This Peter&mdash;does he pull hair and make fun of the way you throw a
  ball?" Sally hoped this would sound amusing, but it was easy to see that the
  introduction of Peter into the day's adventures was viewed with some anxiety.
  "What kind of a boy is he, Hannah? Does he carry toads in his pocket?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid so, Sally," regretted Hannah. "However, you'll not need to
  play with him if you don't want to. I'm told he is very busy most of the day
  now, in a cave with some other boys."</p>

  <p>"A real for-sure cave?" Sally's interest was genuine.</p>

  <p>"One they dug."</p>

  <p>"Will he let me see it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, dear.... Boys are funny."</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;Peter wouldn't want a girl around?"</p>

  <p>"I think he plays mostly with boys," admitted Hannah, "and Gyp, of course.
  Gyp's his dog."</p>

  <p>"I'll bet you mean he just despises girls," reflected Sally hotly.
  "Well&mdash;I won't bother him."</p>

  <p>Hannah was silent for a while and then said, "Peter may not pay very much
  attention to you, but you'll probably like him, Sally."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;for that reason, mostly," drawled Hannah. "Women are made that
  way."</p>

  <p>Sally giggled a little as she pooh-poohed the idea of being rated a woman,
  but showed by her eyes that she enjoyed the sensation.</p>

  <p>"You're so funny, Hannah."</p>

  <p>"I'm quite in earnest, dear. We women are all alike, that way. If a man
  refuses to pay any attention to us, we've simply got to find out the
  reason."</p>

  <p>"Pooh!" said Sally, shrugging. "I wouldn't care."</p>

  <p>Mrs Edmunds met them at the train, Hannah having telephoned they were
  coming. Sally was much impressed by the ease with which Mrs Edmunds, who was
  very pretty and smelled good, handled her car.</p>

  <p>"You sit in the middle, Sally," said Mrs Edmunds, in a very soft, drawly
  voice. "We'll all three ride in one seat."</p>

  <p>"And where is Peter?" wondered Hannah.</p>

  <p>"The cave&mdash;as usual. He'll probably spare you a minute or two for a
  greeting&mdash;if he can find the time. I understand they're rehearsing for
  some initiation ceremonies to-day. The Owens boy is to be received into
  membership presently. He was black-balled earlier in the season for being a
  sissy, but his grandmother has just sent him a fine archery outfit and an
  Indian suit which seems to have improved his standing in the community.... I
  had to get Peter an Indian suit too, Hannah. It pulls down the corners of his
  mouth quite a bit and narrows his eyes, but I think you'll recognize
  him."</p>

  <p>Sally grinned, and decided to like Mrs Edmunds even if she didn't wish to
  meet her unsociable child. Mrs Edmunds said funny things so soberly and
  smelled so good. Sally was always attracted by nice perfume&mdash;not very
  much, of course, but expensive.</p>

  <p>"Did you enjoy the ride on the train, Sally?" asked Mrs Edmunds, to which
  Sally replied affirmatively but crisply, resenting the baby-talk tone of the
  query. And then, feeling she had been curt, she attempted to mend it by
  asking a question. But it would not be a baby question.</p>

  <p>"I am told," she said thoughtfully, "that your son has a dog."</p>

  <p>Mrs Edmunds laughed merrily and exchanged amused glances with Hannah.</p>

  <p>"Oh, very much so, Sally," she replied. "You'll see him."</p>

  <p>"What kind of a dog is he?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;that's not an easy question to answer, dear. We never learned
  much about his family. Sometimes I think he would have been a collie&mdash;if
  he'd had any choice in the matter. At present&mdash;now that we're spending
  so much time in the cave, I think the best way one can describe him is to say
  that he is a very, very dirty dog."</p>

  <p>"But not much dirtier," conjectured Hannah, "than his master."</p>

  <p>They had pulled up in front of the house now, a large, square house with a
  row of beautiful white pillars and white steps. It smelled cool inside and
  everything was very still. Mrs Edmunds took them upstairs to a big bedroom
  with yellow curtains and a very high ceiling and a bed with tall posts where
  they laid their hats and coats. Then they went down again and Mrs Edmunds
  gave Sally a little tapestry pattern in a wooden frame. The stencilled
  picture was a basket of flowers and there was a yarn in a half-dozen
  colours.</p>

  <p>"Hannah and I will have to be talking&mdash;about business&mdash;for a
  little while, Sally. You won't mind. You may go out into the garden if you
  wish. There is a swing. Come&mdash;I'll show you."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>This would be that horrid Peter coming now. He was in an Indian suit, his
  face smeared with some copperish paint, and had just tossed himself over the
  fence near the rabbit-pen, followed by the dog. Sally had been much
  interested in the rabbits and would gladly have remained to watch their
  clumsy limping about&mdash;as if they were nursing a sprained ankle&mdash;but
  felt that Mrs Edmunds rather expected her to sit in the swing and do the
  needlework. She was glad now that the terrible boy hadn't found her looking
  at his rabbits.</p>

  <p>Having upended himself expertly over the fence, Peter ran a few steps as
  one in a great hurry to perform an errand and return to more urgent affairs.
  The dog, sighting Sally, abandoned Peter and galloped towards the swing,
  where he stood panting with a large red smile. Peter whistled, but Gyp was
  still curious about the newcomer who had acknowledged his attentions with a
  few soft little noises that sounded like the kisses you really didn't have
  time to give to relatives when starting for school in the morning.</p>

  <p>Then Sally wished she had encouraged the dog to obey his master, for
  Peter, tugging off his hot, gaily-feathered head-dress, was strolling
  carelessly in her direction.</p>

  <p>"Hello," he growled.</p>

  <p>Sally drew a parsimonious smile and said "Hello", and, because she was
  very much occupied with the threading of a needle, she had time only to
  glance fleetingly in his direction.</p>

  <p>"Your name Sally?" accused the Indian.</p>

  <p>She conceded this point by nodding, her lips pursed a little.</p>

  <p>"You came with my Aunt Hannah?" Peter leaned heavily against the frame of
  the two-seater swing, bumping it rhythmically with his knee.</p>

  <p>"Yes. But I didn't know she was your aunt."</p>

  <p>Encouraged to believe that he might now accept the stranger as a guest in
  good standing, Gyp put a paw up on the seat beside Sally, who drew away
  uneasily.</p>

  <p>"He won't hurt you," scoffed Peter. "Don't be scared."</p>

  <p>"I'm not scared," retorted Sally. "His feet are dirty."</p>

  <p>Peter admitted this gruffly. Sally grinned slightly without raising her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you think I'm dirty, too," he added.</p>

  <p>"Well"&mdash;said Sally, after a pause&mdash;"if you are"&mdash;she looked
  him squarely in the eyes and smiled&mdash;"I'm sure you must be wanting to go
  and wash. Your hands, anyway," she added, displaying her dimples.</p>

  <p>Peter grinned amiably and tousled Gyp's ears to cover his confusion. Then
  he ventured to glance at Sally again. She was bent over her little tapestry,
  still smiling.</p>

  <p>"We've been digging a cave," explained Peter. "You gotta get
  dirty&mdash;digging a cave."</p>

  <p>"I suppose so. Are you going to let me see it?" she asked coyly.</p>

  <p>"It isn't much." Peter's eyes registered perplexity as he gave himself to
  some rapid thinking. "I'll tell you what: we'll wait until the kids are all
  at home for dinner. Then I'll show it to you." He turned and started slowly
  towards the house. "I'll be back," he promised over his shoulder. "Got to see
  Aunt Hannah&mdash;and wash my hands."</p>

  <p>"If I were you&mdash;" counselled Sally.</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;I know," shouted Peter. "You'd wash <i>first."</i></p>

  <p>He ran up the kitchen steps with a great clatter and disappeared in the
  house. Sally drew a long breath, smiled contentedly, and resumed her
  needlework, feeling very grown-up indeed. It was, she mused, a lovely day.
  And Mrs Edmunds had the most beautiful roses she had ever seen. Mrs Edmunds
  was so sweet. It was odd how a woman as dainty as Mrs Edmunds could have such
  a roughneck for a child. She wondered what he would look like if he were
  clean and nicely dressed.</p>

  <p>Once inside the house, Peter suddenly calmed. Tiptoeing up the back
  stairs, he went to his room, divested himself of the Indian suit; and,
  locking himself in the bathroom, took the first voluntary bath he had ever
  undertaken. Then he returned to his room and arrayed himself in the white
  suit he had never worn but once&mdash;and then under protest. There was a
  moment's indecision between the red tie and the blue one. He chose the red,
  knotted it with much care, and in this glorified state descended the main
  stairway.</p>

  <p>"That you, Peter?" called Lydia. "We're in the library, dear. Come in.
  Aunt Hannah's here."</p>

  <p>Peter hesitated for a moment. It had not occurred to him until this
  instant that his altered appearance before his relatives might excite their
  curiosity and possibly evoke smiles. However, it was too late now. He had cut
  off his retreat.</p>

  <p>When he appeared in the doorway, both women looked up and regarded him
  with a blinking astonishment that twisted his face into a grin. Hannah saved
  the day for him.</p>

  <p>"Why, Peter!" she exclaimed. "I think this is the sweetest thing for you
  to clean yourself up so nicely for your Aunt Hannah! Come here, dear, and let
  me look at you. What a lovely suit! It fits wonderfully!"</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;I was pretty dirty, Aunt Hannah," explained Peter, permitting
  himself to be kissed. She retied the red scarf, Lydia looking on with
  amazement. Peter always hated to be fussed with.</p>

  <p>"There!" said Hannah, patting him. "It's perfect!"</p>

  <p>"Peter," said Lydia, "you remember I told you that Aunt Hannah was to
  bring little Sally Ward along. She's out in the swing. Perhaps you'd better
  run out and make her acquaintance. I don't suppose you saw her&mdash;by any
  chance&mdash;when you came in."</p>

  <p>Pretending reluctance to leave, Peter sidled towards the door.</p>

  <p>When he was out of earshot, Hannah said, "I don't think that was quite
  fair, Lydia." They both laughed.</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't it be funny&mdash;?" suggested Lydia, in an undertone.</p>

  <p>Hannah's face was suddenly serious.</p>

  <p><i>"Much</i> too funny!" she replied.</p>

  <p>"But, Hannah! Why shouldn't these children like each other, if they want
  to? Sally's a dear little thing. Her friendship would be good for Peter. It's
  easy to see what she has done to him already."</p>

  <p>"No, dear," protested Hannah, pressing her palm hard against her troubled
  forehead. "We've plenty of complications now, without bidding for any more. I
  want Peter to have a fair chance at life. Now that Adele is determined to
  locate me, it will be only a question of time until she succeeds. Peter
  mustn't know that his mother is a servant. That's a secret I mean to keep
  from him at all costs.... But if he and Sally strike up a friendship, it will
  be almost impossible.... Oh, Lydia&mdash;how very foolish I was to bring the
  child here!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A DOZEN years had wrought many changes at Bar Harbour. The
  Gables seemed smaller, duller, stuffier, and had fallen into genteel
  disrepair. The beach extended much farther to the sea. The sand you had to
  wade was deeper and softer. The tides seemed always to be out, and when you
  firmly took them to task for it, they apathetically ambled in with almost
  nothing of the old gaiety.</p>

  <p>If you really wanted to find out how old you were, reflected Adele, you
  should revisit some spot you hadn't seen since you were up on your toes
  searching for adventure. Then you could see not only what had happened to the
  cherished old haunt, but to yourself as well.</p>

  <p>Once Adele had known everybody who was anybody at all in The Gables'
  summer colony. Now the list of acquaintances had been pared down to a
  frost-bitten little group you could count on your fingers. The men were
  grizzled&mdash;my word! how grey and lean Bob Winthrop was&mdash;and the
  lines in the women's faces were deep. That first afternoon Adele gave herself
  to a ruthlessly honest inspection in the mirror, wondering if she looked as
  battered as Rosalie Parr, wondering if her own bobbed hair made her look as
  silly as Marie Bryce's, wondering whether it was better sense to meet
  middle-age on its own terms or squabble with it to the probable amusement of
  the flappers.</p>

  <p>Sympathetic friends among the expatriates in Paris had condoled with her
  over the "readjustments" she would be obliged to make, now that Martin had
  passed on; but, in sober truth, there hadn't been much readjusting that she
  was conscious of. Martin had been thirteen years her senior, world-weary,
  frail, drifting about from one sanatorium to another, sometimes with and
  sometimes without her, eternally muttering about his defaulting viscera and
  wishing himself dead, which he was, to all useful purposes. The funeral was
  not an occasion for poignant grief; rather in the nature of a memorial as if
  it might have been the anniversary of a demise accomplished years ago. No
  hypocrite, whatever her other weaknesses, Adele hadn't pretended to be
  devastated with sorrow.</p>

  <p>Accompanied by Cynthia Bradford she had gone out next morning to Père la
  Chaise, and arranged for an inscription on the slab. It had been Martin's
  wish to put in here when the time came, and Adele had cheerfully fulfilled
  his instructions, feeling that he would be in fairly good company, his
  resting-place reasonably well ensured against any molestation, at least while
  she lived. Already Martin seemed very remote.</p>

  <p>Cynthia had been quite attentive. Her divorce from Thomas had been granted
  six months ago; and, the luminous novelty of her new freedom having worn
  through to the iron, she was in the market for diversion. Adele's bereavement
  provided her a chance to exercise a talent for comradeliness which had become
  anæmic through disuse. In this mood she had confided more of her own story
  than might have been possible under any other circumstances.</p>

  <p>Part of the serio-comic tale of Cynthia's life with the Bradfords was
  already known to Adele. It was common talk. Madame Bradford had herself
  picked Cynthia Rollins as an acceptable daughter-in-law, shortly after
  Thomas's summary disposal of Hannah, the old lady feeling that if her son
  really insisted upon marriage, she would arrange it for him as she had
  arranged everything from his infancy. The Rollins's fortune having
  evaporated, Cynthia had accepted Thomas much as she might have accepted an
  annuity. And she had earned it&mdash;every dime! Thomas had fallen in with
  the plan complacently, and the jaded trio pursued the established Bradford
  programme&mdash;October in Paris, the winter in Cannes, April in Paris, May
  in London, June in New York (during which time attention would be given to
  consultations with bankers, brokers, and attorneys), summer at Bar Harbour,
  October in Paris, winter in Cannes, <i>ad libitum, ad vitam, ad
  infinitum.</i></p>

  <p>At length&mdash;it was June&mdash;the old lady had died in the New York
  apartment they had expensively maintained and seldom occupied. Cynthia
  announced to her sister, an hour afterwards, that she was leaving for Paris
  on an extended vacation.</p>

  <p>"I am going immediately, Hortense," she declared, "and I have no plans for
  coming back&mdash;that is, not very soon."</p>

  <p>"You'll wait until after the funeral, I hope," admonished Hortense, who
  liked to see things done in good form.</p>

  <p>"Of course. I wouldn't miss that. I've been looking forward to it for
  nearly ten years."</p>

  <p>Thomas hadn't protested. Indeed, he had shared her belief that Cynthia
  needed a long vacation, and while he was much too suave to add that he also
  could do with a few months by himself, he implied it by refraining to dwell
  on his probable loneliness during his wife's absence. Pursuant to habit he
  proceeded to Bar Harbour, settled into a sea-facing second-floor suite at The
  Gables, and, when apprised of Cynthia's decision to free herself of her
  matrimonial bondage, picked up the detective story he had put down upon
  arrival of her letter, and didn't realize what time it was until the bell
  rang for luncheon.</p>

  <p>Cynthia told all, through those days of her girlhood friend's fresh
  sorrow; and Adele, who had known enough of it to be able to guess at the
  rest, listened with more patience than interest. Only one new fact about
  Thomas was disclosed by Cynthia's voluminous confidences. Adele's eyes
  widened with genuine surprise when she heard it. You would never have
  suspected that the torpid Thomas entertained any aspiration at all&mdash;much
  less this one! He wanted children, if you can imagine such a thing! Except
  for this single regret, he lived as unemotionally as a three-toed sloth.</p>

  <p>Sometimes it was almost pitiable, declared Cynthia&mdash;Thomas's shyly
  wistful attitude towards the tots they occasionally encountered. And it was
  quite amazing, too, the way young children responded to his diffident
  overtures. He would greet some little chap of six with the same reserve that
  might have been exhibited by another lad of the same age. Cynthia believed it
  was his very shyness in the presence of small children that encouraged them
  to share responsibility for the promotion of acquaintance. Thomas would not
  be seated on a park bench very long before there would be a child or two
  beside him.</p>

  <p>"Of course," Cynthia had gone on, in that monotonously flat voice of hers
  that wore you out, "when you can't produce a child, it's silly to offer any
  other reason why you didn't have one, but I was always glad I hadn't brought
  some unfortunate little thing into the world to live our life, with no home,
  no permanent friends, no amusement but to trail along after an insufferable
  old lady. It wouldn't have been right."</p>

  <p>One day Adele had decided rather impetuously, to return to the States. Oh,
  yes&mdash;she would probably be back in the autumn. Cynthia hinted that she
  might be persuaded to join forces with Adele on this excursion, but, lacking
  any encouragement, gave up the idea. Sometimes she suspected, from Adele's
  frank inattention, that their comradeship had relaxed into a merely casual
  acquaintance. Reluctant to see this happen&mdash;for she was no end
  lonely&mdash;Cynthia had all but invited herself to go along. She saw Adele
  off at the Gare du Nord, saying, "Do come back soon dear," to which Adele had
  replied, non-committally, "Don't look for me until you see me. I might find
  me a man over there."</p>

  <p>"You can't be in earnest," said Cynthia, a bit piqued by the inference
  that Adele had failed to confide the real purpose of her journey.</p>

  <p>"You'll see," teased Adele, enjoying Cynthia's astonishment.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The nervous scurry of New York had increased. Crowds like swollen rivers
  funnelled through station exits and swirled fanwise at intersections. The
  life of the city had been regimented to the point of absurdity and yet its
  people hurled themselves forward pell-mell as if each was behind his schedule
  and would surely be reprimanded or fired when he arrived.</p>

  <p>Adele suspected that a great deal of this stampede was a mere pose. Men
  had to pretend they were driven almost to desperation by their tasks. To
  confess that you weren't hard pushed for time was almost equivalent to
  admitting you were on the skids.</p>

  <p>More than ever, business men (and women, too) were impressed by the
  mechanical toys they had invented to serve the new god Efficiency. You wanted
  to talk to Mr Andrews about that property you owned on 192nd Street. Mr
  Andrews was on the seventeenth floor of a new skyscraper. Bewildered by the
  racket and confusion in the main foyer, you took the express elevator by
  mistake and were shot like a rocket to the fortieth story, returning
  presently on a local. The girl at the information desk said Mr Andrews was
  still in conference. When you finally got to him, the interview was
  constantly punctuated with bells, buzzers, and every manner of electrified
  plaything requiring his attention. Earnest-faced secretaries popped in to lay
  a sheaf of papers on the desk and popped out carrying other papers hastily
  grabbed up. Adele knew they were bluffing, trying to impress you with the
  urgency of their large affairs. Old Andrews was attempting to keep up with
  the pandemonium, but it had made him as jittery as a caged monkey. She tried
  to tease him a little, but he wouldn't have it.</p>

  <p>The odd thing about it was that, although you were confident of your
  belief that about fifty per cent of this pressure was faked, you yourself
  soon fell into the feverish trot, pushing and rushing along with the rest.
  Adele had been away from this madhouse long enough to have forgotten how
  wearing it was, and in the meantime its rattle and clash, its hurry and
  worry, had accelerated until it fairly dizzied her.</p>

  <p>One day, quite on impulse, she took a late afternoon boat to Boston, hired
  a car in the morning, and was driven up to the old home on the North Shore.
  It was for sale again; by a bank, this time. The caretaker was friendly after
  she had explained who she was and why she had come. She did not enter the
  house, but sauntered through the gardens and followed the path to the
  half-timbered cottage where she had so often gone to have a glimpse of
  Hannah. There had been few changes. It was as if she had been here yesterday.
  Memories of the thoughtful, deferential, competent Hannah came surging back
  to fill Adele with an intense longing to see her. What had become of Hannah?
  Wouldn't it be marvellous if Hannah were free to come to her as a companion?
  They could travel. Hannah had been so keen on travel. Indeed, it had been
  Thomas Bradford's enticing offer of foreign sightseeing that had swept the
  lonely girl off her feet and into disaster. Adele made a prompt resolve. She
  would try to find Hannah!</p>

  <p>Back in New York by train next day, Adele telephoned the Bradford
  apartment and was gratified to learn that Thomas was in town. Yes&mdash;he
  would be glad to talk to her. So they lunched together in a relatively calm
  restaurant on Fifty-third Street, Thomas&mdash;stouter, greyer,
  nattier&mdash;amiably inquiring about Cynthia in the dutiful tone of one
  asking expected questions concerning the health of one's maiden aunt, and
  Adele telling him everything she thought he ought to know of his late wife's
  prosaic life.</p>

  <p>"Yeah," drawled Thomas, "it was a lucky day for Cynthia when she got rid
  o' me."</p>

  <p>"<i>Wasn't</i> it, though?" agreed Adele heartily, which made Thomas
  laugh. "Lucky for Hannah Parmalee, too, I always thought," added Adele. "By
  the way&mdash;I'm meaning to find Hannah if possible. Could you help me?"</p>

  <p>By long training in the endurance of embarrassing situations, Thomas had
  developed a fairly thick crust, but he winced a little under Adele's candid
  contempt. Defensively he explained that a few weeks after the divorce he had
  sent Hannah a cheque for five hundred dollars&mdash;the amount of her own
  money he had used&mdash;but the letter had come back marked "Address
  Unknown". It had been sent to her latest Chicago address, a residence on Lake
  Shore Drive. Yes&mdash;he still had it, if Adele thought there was any use
  trying again.</p>

  <p>"You gave it up, after that one attempt? Never made another effort to find
  out whether Hannah was alive or dead, sick or well? She might have
  starved."</p>

  <p>Thomas shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, Hannah wasn't the kind to starve. She would make her way, all right.
  Probably married again. I certainly hope so. I admit I treated her badly, but
  she would have been treated worse if she had tried to live with
  me&mdash;under the circumstances." He faced Adele now with a bit of challenge
  lighting his pale blue eyes. "But, speaking of indifference and neglect,
  <i>you</i> didn't go to much bother about her, either, until now&mdash;now
  that you need her."</p>

  <p>"I'll grant your point, Thomas," confessed Adele. "I had my own troubles
  to fret about. I hope it isn't too late."</p>

  <p>"If you find out anything, will you let me know?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps. It depends on what I find out."</p>

  <p>"If she is in need, will you let me know?"</p>

  <p>"Not likely. Hannah wouldn't want you to do anything about it."</p>

  <p>"That's true," agreed Thomas glumly. "Hannah was proud."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The Newcombs still lived at the Lake Shore Drive address. Mrs Newcomb,
  replying to Adele's letter, remembered Hannah very well, and had taken the
  trouble to inquire of their family physician.</p>

  <p>"I was ill myself when Hannah left," she wrote, "or I would have shown
  more interest. Doctor Phelps saw her a few times after we let her go; then
  sent her to a free clinic. He thinks she went to the University Hospital to
  have her baby. That is all we know about it."</p>

  <p>Ten days later, Adele had a report from the University Hospital. Hannah
  Parmalee Bradford, present address unknown, had borne a son there. The child
  had been taken, likely for later adoption (though they had no record of
  that), by another patient, Mrs Jasper Edmunds of Rattoon.... Now we were
  really getting somewhere, exulted Adele. She wrote to Mrs Edmunds, careful to
  request a return of the letter if not delivered in three days. It did not
  come back. Impatiently she waited for a reply. New York was stifling.
  Everyone who could do so had gone away for the summer. Unable any longer to
  endure the heat and noise and loneliness, Adele had packed up hastily and
  taken herself up to Bar Harbour, resolved that if she did not hear from this
  Mrs Edmunds very soon, she would make the trip West and do a bit of
  sleuthing.</p>

  <p>After she had been there three days, Thomas Bradford arrived. He had
  padded softly into the cool dining-room on rubber soles, passing her table
  without seeing her, the head waiter preceding him with the attentiveness due
  a guest of long standing. He nodded to the occupants of several tables,
  paused to shake hands with the Winthrops and the Parrs; and, when seated,
  exchanged a smile of recognition with Adele. After luncheon they met in the
  lounge.</p>

  <p>"Heard anything?" asked Thomas, waiving a formal greeting.</p>

  <p>Adele swiftly debated a reply and shook her head, Thomas searching her
  eyes afterwards as if not quite sure what her momentary hesitation signified.
  Then Bob Winthrop came downstairs in his golf togs and lazily called, "See
  you out front," and Thomas had moved away, presumably to dress for the
  links.</p>

  <p>The afternoon mail came. There was a letter from Hannah.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">DEAR MISS ADELE:</p>

  <p class="letter">My friend Mrs Edmunds gave me your letter to her. It is
  surely good to have word from you after so many years. I have often wondered
  where you were and if I should ever see you again. You were always very good
  to me.</p>

  <p class="letter">I see that you know about my little boy. His name is Peter,
  and he is eleven years old. Some ways he seems older. He is going to be tall
  and big like his grandfather Parmalee, I think. I see him often, but he does
  not know I am his mother. Of course this hurts me very much, but I am anxious
  for him to grow up to be somebody. I don't want him to be held back by his
  mother's being of the servant class. Not that I am ashamed of it myself, but
  it would stand in his way at college and after. He has a good home with Mrs
  Edmunds and thinks she is his mother. Sometimes it has been hard to stand by
  and watch him make over her. But I want him to have his chance, as I said. I
  know you won't tell anyone. Peter calls me "Aunt Hannah".</p>

  <p class="letter">Ever since he was born I have worked in the home of
  Professor Ward. They have been good to me. They have three children, the
  youngest born after I came here. They were poor then, but now they live very
  well. I cannot leave. These people need me now more than ever. Besides, I
  must stay where I can visit Peter. He will never be mine, but it helps a
  little to be able to see him. I hope this finds you well. Would you please
  send me your picture?</p>

  <p class="letter">Respectfully yours,</p>

  <p class="letter">HANNAH PARMALEE.</p><br>

  <p>Adele was pensive. She sat for a long time with the open letter in her
  hands wondering just how much heart-break would be involved in the sort of
  sacrifice Hannah was making for her child.</p>

  <p>It was odd, but true enough. Here we were in a democratic country that had
  always blown itself purple in the face over its "equality" and its derision
  of social caste, but the facts were that Hannah was right when she believed
  her boy would have a better chance to succeed if it were never known that his
  mother had worked in somebody's kitchen.</p>

  <p>And, speaking of Peter's chance, when and how was he going to get it?
  Certainly not in a sleepy little town in the corn-belt, brought up by a
  kindly disposed widow who had probably never been anywhere in her life. Peter
  would attend the high school, fall in love with a classmate, spend four years
  in college, and settle down in Waterloo, likely, to be a country lawyer or a
  bank-teller or something like that. And Hannah, hoping all the time that
  Peter would make a name for himself, and going through who knew how much
  sacrificial agony to speed him on to greatness.</p>

  <p>"I won't have it!" declared Adele. "If it's costing this much to give
  Peter a chance, I'll come in on it&mdash;and help!"</p>

  <p>The letter she sent to Hannah was recomposed three times before she was
  entirely pleased with it. She agreed with Hannah in every particular about
  the liberty Peter should have and felicitated her on the bravery of her
  decision to keep herself in the background, no matter at what cost of
  maternal suffering.</p>

  <p>"But, really, Hannah," continued Adele, shaping the words with her lips as
  she wrote, "if this boy is to do the things necessary to justify your painful
  investment in him, he should soon have a little wider view of the world than
  he is likely to get in that small town. No reflection on your Mrs Edmunds at
  all. A fine woman, doubtless. But Peter needs more room to grow up in.... Now
  I want to make you a proposal. It would please me very much&mdash;I'm really
  frightfully lonesome, Hannah&mdash;if you would let Peter come and spend
  August here with me. I can be an aunt he never saw. He's too young to make
  many inquiries about that. I'll come to Chicago and meet him. Mrs Edmunds can
  bring him that far. I'll show the dear little chap the sea and teach him to
  swim and find him some pleasant company among the youngsters here. The
  Winthrops have their grandchildren along.... Do humour me in this, Hannah.
  I'm quite eager about it."</p>

  <p>Mrs Ward had promised herself to return to Chicago in mid-August for the
  opera season at Rivinia Park. Paul's consultation work in Chicago was taking
  him there again. They would be leaving in a week.</p>

  <p>Hannah read Adele's special through, voting all of her stock against the
  project; read it again, still doubtful but interested; read it a third time.
  The sea, the Winthrops, Adele.</p>

  <p>Sally came in for a drink of water.</p>

  <p>"Hannah," she said coaxingly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, dear." Hannah's voice sounded very far away.</p>

  <p>"We're going to be alone again."</p>

  <p>"I know, Sally. You will take good care of me, won't you?"</p>

  <p>"Will you be wanting to go down to Waterloo again&mdash;to see Mrs
  Edmunds? If you do, please will you take me?"</p>

  <p>"We'll see," postponed Hannah absently.</p>

  <p>After Sally had gone out to the garden, Hannah sat for a long time in
  earnest thought, her chin cupped in an unsteady hand. In September, when
  school began again, there would be no occasion for Sally to go along to
  Waterloo. To refuse to take her there again would unquestionably stir her
  curiosity. She wouldn't be able to understand. If it was all right&mdash;and
  her mother had agreed it was&mdash;to be taken to see Mrs Edmunds and Peter
  in July, why not in August? Had she done something amiss to make Hannah
  refuse her another invitation?</p>

  <p>These questions were bound to arise. Sally's feelings mustn't be hurt and
  her curiosity should not be aroused. How natural if she confided her
  perplexity to her mother, who would wonder even more about it herself.</p>

  <p>Besides&mdash;it would be a great experience for Peter, as Adele had said.
  Adele probably knew what she was talking about. The more she considered it,
  the more attractive the plan seemed to Hannah. Next day&mdash;Sally having
  been invited to go on a picnic party with the Olivers'
  grandchildren&mdash;Hannah went to Waterloo on an early train and canvassed
  the whole situation with Lydia, her chief talking-point being the fine
  experience for Peter.</p>

  <p>Lydia listened quietly, not quite prepared to express an opinion, and
  Hannah rather reluctantly presented the other angle of the case. She didn't
  want Peter and Sally to be seeing any more of each other. It was very plain,
  wasn't it, that these children were unusually congenial? Lydia nodded and
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"He talks about her every day," she said, "and keeps asking when you're
  going to bring her again."</p>

  <p>"You see?" demanded Hannah. "I knew it! We can't have it!"</p>

  <p>"Well," sighed Lydia, "after all, dear, he's your boy. And I must say
  you've made very few suggestions about the way you wanted him brought up. If
  you really think we should let him go, I see no reason why not. I'll arrange
  to take him to Chicago. We had better wire to Mrs Moore at once."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Lydia, you're very good." Hannah's satisfaction and relief were
  so genuine that Lydia was glad she had acquiesced promptly.</p>

  <p>"Shall I tell him now?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Hannah, "I'll leave you to tell Peter anything you like
  about his mysterious Aunt Adele. It shouldn't be difficult. She has lived
  abroad more years than he is old. And he has often heard us speak of her.
  Peter will be so excited about the trip that he probably won't ask many
  puzzling questions." She paused thoughtfully, her eyes troubled. "I don't
  like to have Peter deceived, even for his own good, but apparently we can't
  do this any other way."</p>

  <p>Lydia sighed gently and said she didn't like that part of it either.</p>

  <p>"But for his sake," she added, "we have already left so much untold that
  one more small deceit won't matter. It would be quite different if we were
  planning something that might hurt him. I'm afraid the telling of the literal
  and complete truth to Peter, at this stage, would be a very shabby act."</p>

  <p>"That's true enough," agreed Hannah, "but plenty of good people would say
  we were doing the wrong thing. I'm sure of that."</p>

  <p>"Plenty of good people," reflected Lydia, "are over-generous with their
  opinions about problems they don't understand very well. We'll see it
  through, I shall telegraph Mrs Moore that Peter and I will meet her at the
  train she intends to take for her return East. In the confusion of setting
  off on his big adventure, he will not notice that his mother and his Aunt
  Adele are not as well acquainted as relatives ought to be. I shall leave him
  with her and hurry away. The rest of it will be up to her. That sounds
  practical, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>"I hope so, dear," said Hannah. "Thanks for being willing to do it for us.
  You have been very good to me, Lydia."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>After an hour they went forward to the dining-car, Peter gallantly opening
  the doors and keeping a weather-eye out for his charming Aunt Adele as they
  made their way through the aisles of the lurching train.</p>

  <p>It had been an exciting morning. Such chuff-chuffing of engines and
  clanging of bells and rattling of baggage-trucks and people rushing into
  trains and out of trains! Peter had been so occupied by this complication of
  new sights and sounds that he had barely realized his mother was gone and his
  pretty Aunt Adele was in charge of him until they were gliding out of the
  gloomy station-shed.</p>

  <p>For a half-hour they had slipped smoothly past rows and rows of ugly brick
  houses that looked very much alike, the track presently rising to a level of
  the second-storey windows. And they had passed several swift trains, so close
  it made you blink when the big Pullman cars flicked by, whispering a soft
  little "Fsst, fsst, fsst, fsst".</p>

  <p>And then came dozens of railroad crossings where the heavy wheels of your
  train pounded the other tracks, shouting, <i>"Flat-</i>on-your-back!
  <i>Flat</i>-on-your-back! <i>Flat</i>-on-your-back!" Now there were
  occasional open spaces with brown-grass stubble where the hay had been cut.
  Peter hadn't wanted to talk. And Aunt Adele hadn't bothered him with any
  attentions. It was open country and the train was going very fast. Peter
  turned from the window and for the first time recognized his duty to show a
  polite interest in his stylishly dressed companion.</p>

  <p>"I'm hungry, Peter," she said, and he knew he was going to like her. His
  experience with women had led him to believe that they never really were
  hungry; that when they ate it was mostly to accommodate others. If this
  beautiful woman was the sort to get hungry and was honest enough to say so
  frequently, he felt that they could easily be friends. Moreover, she hadn't
  tried to kiss him or hold his hand or smooth his cowlick with a wet finger.
  He looked up at her amiably and partly closed one eye to let her know that
  the remark she had made coincided fully with his own feelings. Perhaps, if he
  had given more thought to it, the wink might have seemed not quite
  appropriate to the occasion&mdash;seeing how recently they had met for the
  first time&mdash;but now that he had done it, Peter knew, from the happy
  amusement on her face, that his reply had pleased her. Indeed, she seemed so
  pleased that he half-feared she might put her arm around him or pat him on
  the knee, but she didn't. It made him feel quite grown-up.... The doors were
  heavy and hard to pull open, especially the first one they came to at the end
  of their own car. He tugged with almost full strength, his new Aunt Adele
  waiting behind him. Now she'd be saying, "Wait a minute, Peter. I'll help
  you." But she didn't say anything; just stood and waited. He had braced
  himself firmly then and pulled the door open. And she hadn't said, "That's a
  big, strong boy!" He knew now that he and Aunt Adele were going to get along
  together. He liked her. He liked the way she walked. He liked her name. Aunt
  Adele. He hadn't called her that yet.</p>

  <p>Seated now at the table for two, Peter had a chance to inspect his
  attractive new relative with a sincere frankness that Adele found slightly
  disconcerting. He made no attempt to disguise his approval of her outward
  appearance, his sentiments on that subject being fully expressed in the
  steady grey eyes (Hannah's) and flatteringly confirmed by the puckery little
  smile (also Hannah's) that lightly pursed his mobile lips.</p>

  <p>Adele tried to see as little as possible of Thomas Bradford in this
  interesting young face, though there was something in the sidelong glance
  when, gazing out at the window, he unexpectedly let you have it without
  turning his head&mdash;there was something in that half-shy, half-defensive,
  inquiring glance that was Thomas&mdash;Thomas to the life! The shapely ears,
  too, snugged uncommonly close to the head. That was Thomas. However, Thomas
  had a very good head&mdash;at least on the outside&mdash;and Peter might have
  done worse than to fall heir to it. The forward curve of the hairline on the
  temples&mdash;Thomas again. It would be the same blondish brown hair, too,
  when it had darkened a little more in maturity.</p>

  <p>"What would you like to have, Peter?" asked Adele casually, training her
  lorgnette on the menu-card.</p>

  <p>"I'd rather you would say, please," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"'Aunt Adele,'" she prompted gently, in the same key.</p>

  <p>He grinned companionably and repeated the words after her as her tone had
  suggested. There was a little caress in it that warmed her heart.</p>

  <p>"I hope you're going to like your Aunt Adele, Peter." Her eyes were intent
  on the menu so as not to seem too urgent with her proffer of affection.</p>

  <p>"I do!" His declaration was so prompt and sincere that Adele's eyes were
  misty. Quick to observe the alarming effect of his reply, Peter added
  prudently, "I like <i>all</i> my aunts."</p>

  <p>Adele intuitively understood the nature of this qualifying
  afterthought.</p>

  <p>"That's the way it ought to be, of course," she commented, "though aunts
  can be a great trial."</p>

  <p>"I've never seen but two of mine&mdash;Aunt Hannah and you."</p>

  <p>"Your Aunt Hannah is a darling." Here, thought Adele, was a reasonably
  safe topic. She hoped that if Peter had any questions to ask about family
  relationships, they might pivot on Hannah. "We used to have such fun together
  when we were girls," she added truthfully.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you come and see her?"</p>

  <p>"There wasn't time, Peter. I was anxious to take you on your vacation at
  once, for you will have to be back in school presently. I'll try to see
  Hannah when we return.... Do you think you would like an omelet&mdash;or some
  fish?"</p>

  <p>Peter's voice was reminiscently obedient. "My mother said I should let you
  choose what I'm to eat."</p>

  <p>She couldn't resist teasing him a little with a suggestion that the
  milk-toast was generally very nice on trains and, noting the slightly
  apprehensive look in his eyes, added, "Of course, you needn't have it if you
  prefer something else."</p>

  <p>"Are <i>you?"</i> he asked, wrinkling his face in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not!" scoffed Adele. "I'm having lamb chops, creamed potatoes,
  asparagus, salad, pie, ice-cream,&mdash;almost everything!"</p>

  <p>Peter drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"That will be all right for me, too," he agreed complacently.</p>

  <p>"You're very polite, Peter." She was beginning to write their order now,
  and having put down two corn soups, two lamb chops, and two peas, she seemed
  to have difficulty with the lorgnette. "Will you fill out the rest of it,
  dear!" She pushed the order-pad and pencil towards him; and Peter, aglow over
  his responsibility, followed the pattern she had set for him.</p>

  <p>"You want coffee, I expect," he said, without looking up.</p>

  <p>"Chocolate, please."</p>

  <p>So, on the last line, Peter wrote two chocolates, rather pleased she
  hadn't wanted coffee, for he knew he wasn't considered old enough, and it
  would have made him feel like a baby to have taken chocolate. This made it
  all right&mdash;Aunt Adele's having it, too. He handed back the order, and
  she signed to the waiter that it was ready for him, without so much as
  glancing at it to see if it had been filled out properly. Peter's shoulders
  straightened. He gave her an earnest look with a query behind it and her
  pretty brows raised slightly in anticipation.</p>

  <p>"Did you ever have a boy&mdash;Aunt Adele?"</p>

  <p>"No, Peter."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's pause.</p>

  <p>"That's too bad," he said gently.</p>

  <p>She briefly nodded her appreciation of this spontaneous solicitude, and,
  observing that Peter wasn't quite finished with what he was trying to say,
  she asked, "Why?"&mdash;in such a low voice that if he hadn't read the word
  on her lips he might not have heard it. He contemplated a prudent reply, his
  grey eyes narrowing.</p>

  <p>"Because&mdash;well&mdash;I expect you wanted one."</p>

  <p>"That's true, Peter," she assented softly; and, after a pause, "What made
  you think so?"</p>

  <p>He lightly traced a nervous pattern on the tablecloth with his
  butter-knife and chuckled self-consciously.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;I don't know," he ventured, at length. "Anyway&mdash;it would
  have been pretty nice&mdash;for the boy."</p>

  <p>"How very sweet of you, Peter!"</p>

  <p>He flushed slightly under this candid tribute, and considered the wisdom
  of changing the conversation. However, the soup had come now to relieve the
  tension.</p>

  <p>"If I could have had a boy," pursued Adele tenderly, "I would have wanted
  one just like you."</p>

  <p>Somewhat disturbed by this endearment, Peter hastened to defend his right
  to be a problem to his mother, and presently was telling her all about the
  cave, the club, and the manly sports which occupied so much of his
  attention.</p>

  <p>"I take it that you don't play very much with girls," observed Adele.
  "Perhaps you don't care for them."</p>

  <p>Peter was almost on the point of admitting that this was true when it
  suddenly occurred to him that Aunt Adele might be offended, for she had been
  a girl herself and&mdash;some ways&mdash;seemed a good deal like a girl even
  now, so he replied, "Oh&mdash;they're all right," after which he renewed his
  interest in the soup, trusting that he had squared himself.</p>

  <p>"You'll think so some day," laughed Adele. "Girls get much nicer as they
  grow up. I don't think they're very interesting&mdash;at eleven."</p>

  <p>The waiter had carried away the soup-plates, leaving Peter without
  occupation at a moment when he would have appreciated some distraction. Aunt
  Adele seemed to know exactly what you were thinking. He hoped she wasn't
  guessing about his thoughts now. He wondered about this for a moment; and,
  raising his eyes, encountered hers. They were smiling, teasingly. He looked
  away quickly and felt a sudden warmth creeping up his cheeks.</p>

  <p>"Peter," she accused him playfully, "you're holding out on me."</p>

  <p>He shook his head guiltily, but would not meet her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Funny thing about that," observed Adele, almost as if she were talking to
  herself. "Boys and girls are perfect pests to each other when they're your
  age&mdash;all except one."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;that <i>is</i> funny," agreed Peter absently.</p>

  <p>The lamb chops had come now and the other things. Very hungry, Peter
  applied himself diligently, noting, after a while, that his Aunt Adele was
  more interested in him than her luncheon.</p>

  <p>"What's her name, Peter?" she asked softly.</p>

  <p>"Sally."</p>

  <p>"Neighbour&mdash;I suppose."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;she lives with Aunt Hannah. Sally Ward."</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;you like Sally, do you?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;she's different. You won't tell, will you?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;but I expect Hannah knows. Hannah knows almost everything."</p>

  <p>Peter shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not about that&mdash;she doesn't," declared Peter, a bit brusquely. "When
  do we get to Bar Harbour, Aunt Adele?"</p>

  <p>"About Friday, I think. We're not going there directly. We will stop in
  Boston for a couple of days. I have some errands there. And I want you to see
  a few things that will make school a little more interesting this autumn.
  Would you like to do that, Peter?" Observing that he was only mildly
  enthusiastic, she went on, "We will hire a car and drive out over the road
  that Paul Revere took, when he stirred up the farmers to fight the British.
  Do you remember?"</p>

  <p>Peter remembered, and thought this would be a wonderful thing to do. "Aunt
  Hannah doesn't believe in fighting," he added. "She doesn't even want to talk
  about it."</p>

  <p>Adele had forgotten Hannah's odd quirk on the subject of war. Now it all
  came back to her memory, the frequency of Hannah's comments on
  combat&mdash;all manner of combat, national and individual, public and
  private. It had been nothing short of an obsession. Doubtless her strange
  convictions had deepened as she hugged them more tightly through the passing
  years.... And so, Hannah had filled this lad's head with her own queer ideas.
  It would be interesting to know his reaction to a philosophy so utterly
  impractical.</p>

  <p>"I can't think that Hannah would object to your looking at the Bunker Hill
  Monument, Peter, or driving out to see Paul Revere's road. After
  all&mdash;that's the way we got our American independence."</p>

  <p>"Aunt Hannah doesn't think so," rejoined Peter firmly. "She says any kind
  of fighting is wrong, no matter who does it."</p>

  <p>"And what do you think?" Adele couldn't help asking.</p>

  <p>Peter was sober for a moment, apparently struggling between loyalty to his
  Aunt Hannah and the necessity to state his own boyish feelings.</p>

  <p>"I think," he said slowly, "a fellow's got to fight sometimes, whether he
  wants to or not. You can't let 'em run over you. Aunt Hannah's wonderful, but
  I'll bet she'd find it pretty tough to do that if she was a boy. Don't you
  think so Aunt Adele?"</p>

  <p>She dodged this neatly by reminding Peter that she never had been a boy,
  and couldn't say just what she would do.</p>

  <p>"That's just it," approved Peter, pleased with her confession of feminine
  immunity. "Men don't want women to fight."</p>

  <p>Adele drew a disturbingly ironical smile.</p>

  <p>"Now you've said something, my lad! Men like to harness themselves in
  shiny leather straps with plenty of bright buttons and go strutting down the
  street behind the band. They love the way they look in their
  uniforms&mdash;so big and straight and strong. They don't want their women to
  show off their bravery. They expect the women to stay at home and fret and
  lie awake nights and wonder where their children's next meal is coming
  from."</p>

  <p>"You talk like Aunt Hannah," said Peter, wishing now that the subject
  hadn't come up&mdash;"except she doesn't make fun of the belts and things....
  But&mdash;anyway&mdash;a fellow's got to protect himself, don't you
  think?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Peter, I do think that. Making war is one thing, and defending
  yourself is another."</p>

  <p>"Aunt Hannah doesn't think so. It's all the same thing, she says. I never
  let her know when I've been in a fight."</p>

  <p>"What does your mother say about it?"</p>

  <p>"When I've been fighting?" Peter grinned reminiscently. "She just asks me
  how it came out."</p>

  <p>Adele couldn't help smiling over that, and Peter felt she was on his side,
  even if she didn't say so.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Thomas had taken a late afternoon dip in the surf and was sprawled at full
  length on the sand. He had been obliged to spend a week in New York attending
  to certain stupid matters of business which, he felt, might as easily have
  been handled by mail. The return trip to Bar Harbour had been hot, dirty,
  tedious. It was refreshing to be back. Shutting his eyes against the
  sunlight, he luxuriated in the comforting breeze and the sedative lisp of an
  outgoing tide.</p>

  <p>Most of the bathers had left the beach, passing him as he had come out.
  Parents were shouting injunctions to their children to come now and get ready
  for dinner. Drowsily outstretched, he heard the youngsters' prattle receding.
  Presently he, too, would plod back to the bathhouse, de-sand himself in the
  shower, and dress. It was very quiet. Thomas opened his eyes, sat up, yawned,
  and met the gaze of a boy who stood a little way off, feet wide apart, hands
  on hips, regarding him with interest.</p>

  <p>"Hello," said Thomas pleasantly. "Were you waiting for me?"</p>

  <p>"You were so still," said the boy, "and the rest of them were all gone. I
  thought something was the matter. I beg your pardon, sir."</p>

  <p>"It was quite the right thing to do, I think. We water-spaniels have to
  take care of each other. No telling what might happen to us.
  Besides&mdash;any sort of flotsam or jetsam lying on the beach is likely to
  be interesting." Thomas drew up his knees and folded his arms on them, and
  the boy dropped down beside him.</p>

  <p>"What's flotsam?" he inquired, looking up earnestly into Thomas's
  face.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;you can't have any flotsam unless you have some jetsam. They
  always go together like&mdash;like cakes and syrup, and each and every, and
  Sodom and Gomorrah. Now, technically"&mdash;Thomas assumed a tone of
  gravity&mdash;"technically, flotsam is almost anything that washes in from a
  wreck&mdash;and jetsam is stuff the sailors throw overboard just before the
  wreck&mdash;but it all comes to the same thing."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I see," assented the boy, nodding his head politely. "Thank
  you."</p>

  <p>Thomas grinned, partly over his own silly speech, partly over the
  seriousness with which it had been received. The boy drew a brief smile and
  quickly sobered, his grey eyes intent on a candid survey of his new friend.
  Thomas returned the scrutiny, a bit mystified over the lad's artless
  inspection of him. Then they both smiled, and Thomas said, "What's your
  name?"</p>

  <p>"Peter Edmunds."</p>

  <p>"Stopping at the Gables, Peter?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. I came Thursday. I'm visiting my aunt."</p>

  <p>"Who is your aunt? Maybe I know her."</p>

  <p>"Mrs Moore. She came to Chicago for me."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;so you live in Chicago?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir&mdash;in Waterloo. My mother brought me to Chicago to meet Aunt
  Adele."</p>

  <p>"Thank you for telling me about yourself, Peter. I am glad to know you. I
  am Mr Bradford."</p>

  <p>"How do you do, Mr Bradford?" said Peter respectfully. "Do you know my
  Aunt Adele?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, she's a good friend of mine." There was a considerable pause. "How
  old are you, Peter?"</p>

  <p>"Eleven. Twelve pretty soon."</p>

  <p>There was another extended silence.</p>

  <p>"When?" inquired Thomas quietly.</p>

  <p>"November second."</p>

  <p>Thomas's eyes looked far out to sea, meditatively, and he softly rubbed
  his thumb against the tips of his fingers, almost as if he were
  counting&mdash;eeny, meeny, miny, mo. Peter watched him interestedly.</p>

  <p>"Shall we go now?" asked Thomas. "It will soon be dinnertime."</p>

  <p>Peter rose and measured long steps. They did not talk much on the way
  back. When they parted, Thomas said, "I'll be seeing you," and Peter replied,
  "Thank you, Mr. Bradford. I'd like to."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THAT was an eventful winter for the Wards. The new
  refrigerator had caught on instantly, effortlessly. The public had been
  waiting a long time for it. Salesmen needed only to be order-takers. At the
  factory production had been speeded up to three shifts per day. Paul's
  rewards were exceeding his most lavish expectations.</p>

  <p>Hannah's fears that an overstuffed optimism might involve them all in a
  financial disaster were gradually allayed. For no accountable reason, Paul
  Ward's luck had turned. Everything he touched ran smoothly. Hannah could well
  remember the occasion, six years ago, when he had been badgered by an
  unscrupulous local man to buy a hundred dollars' worth of stock in the Parker
  Manufacturing Company, engaged in making pumps. He couldn't spare the money.
  But the chap who had come to see him had pictured such prompt and huge
  profits that Paul had yielded. The next afternoon's papers reported that the
  concern had gone into bankruptcy. The very next afternoon! The people who
  sold him the stock knew the company was broke, knew they were stealing his
  money. Even Mr Parker himself, president of the organization, had assisted in
  making the stock sale. It wasn't much, of course, but Mr Parker&mdash;with
  his back to the wall&mdash;was willing to take what little he could lay his
  hands on, not caring much how he got it.</p>

  <p>Now that Paul's income was ample to take care of every reasonable wish,
  all his investments proved profitable. Part of this success was attributable
  to the good advice he received from Sam Trimble, with whom he had become
  chummy.</p>

  <p>Sometimes Paul chuckled about it. He would come to the dinner-table with
  the evening paper in his hands, folded at the financial page, and say, "Well,
  Marcia, we made six hundred dollars to-day."</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;<i>Paul</i>!" she would exclaim. "How wonderful! What are you
  going to do with it?"</p>

  <p>And Paul would reply idly, "We'll just leave it there to grow a little
  more&mdash;and then you can buy yourself a new apron, or a new axe, or
  something." He was proud of her chance to be indolent.</p>

  <p>One would have thought that after the long steady pinch of poverty, he
  might have become vain, silly, and pompous over what his fortune could do for
  him personally. Hannah was pleased to observe that this had not happened. He
  was as indifferent to his swollen income as he had been formerly to his
  predicaments. An hour's fretting over some humiliation would see him through
  it, in the old days, after which he would resume his careless attitude
  towards expenses and obligations alike. Now, true to his nature, Paul would
  rejoice for a little while over some unexpected increment and then settle
  quickly again into his normal state of mind.</p>

  <p>The new venture had absorbed so much of his time and attention that Hannah
  often wondered whether he would be able to retain enough interest in his
  professorship to ensure his position at the University. She had so hoped he
  wouldn't let his new money make a loafer of him. To her delight, September
  twelfth found him eager to be back in his class-room, and for several days
  preceding he had been diligent in the Dean's office. Hannah was proud of him
  when she discovered that his money wasn't likely to spoil him.</p>

  <p>It was going to be a bit different with Mrs Ward. Of course it was not
  much to be wondered at if this extraordinary pretty creature, having waded
  through drudgery, penury, worry, boredom, and dowdiness for all of fifteen
  years, would now let herself out. Her horizon had been expanded immeasurably,
  and she couldn't be blamed for wanting to stir about a little and see what
  was going on in a world of larger privileges.</p>

  <p>So she was making up for lost time. There was a second maid now&mdash;one
  Bertha&mdash;a trim little thing who promptly proved her value by relieving
  Hannah of the extra work which the new house demanded. Bertha was going to be
  quite a comfort. Hannah liked her, and felt that the girl heartily
  reciprocated. At least she acted as it she did. The children were becoming
  more and more self-reliant. Wallie had his own interests outside. Afternoon
  and evening absences from home were vaguely attributed to basketball practice
  and school activities. Roberta didn't need or want very many friends, and
  spent much time in her room, presumably writing and drawing, an odd youngster
  who belonged to the tribe mostly by sheer residence. Sally was blossoming;
  still a little girl but beginning to show signs of an early development into
  a rare type of Saxonish loveliness. She was much interested in making
  exquisite costumes for her dolls; but, having completed a new dress, the
  thought of mothering the doll seemed tiresome. It would not be long now,
  reflected Hannah, until Sally would have to put her cherished brood up in the
  attic store-room.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Marcia Ward had a genuine talent for bridge, and seeing how few gifts she
  possessed other than her personal appearance, she had gone in for it with an
  absorption that was only a little northeast of frenzy.</p>

  <p>She had also bobbed her hair&mdash;one of the earliest in town to venture
  upon this audacity&mdash;and talked about it and fussed with it a good deal,
  partly because she realized it was amazingly becoming to her girlish type,
  and partly in self-defence, for the time had not yet arrived when a
  Mid-Western matron of thirty-nine could do it with impunity. Until very
  recently the only adult women with bobbed hair, at least in the hog-and-corn
  zone, were either invalids, inmates of lunatic asylums or out-and-out
  hussies. The University wives not only had long hair, but wore switches,
  mostly of earlier vintage to prove they hadn't always been grey. Mrs Adams
  even wore a rat around which a huge sprayless comber curled as if poised to
  break.</p>

  <p>So&mdash;all of these conditions being as they were&mdash;what time Marcia
  wasn't talking bridge she was talking hair. And if she didn't look out,
  thought Hannah, her conversation would presently become rather irksome to her
  husband, who had not shown himself to be keenly interested in either of these
  issues.</p>

  <p>Eleanor Trimble was now Marcia's closest friend. Eleanor was the authentic
  leader of the best social dozen in town besides holding an excellent position
  in the esteem of the better faculty wives. It was a tricky relationship, too,
  for the tie-up between town and gown was as sensitive as a dancer's corn. On
  occasions&mdash;not very lately, however&mdash;the animosity had blazed until
  lines had been stretched for the protection of bystanders. For the past three
  or four years there had been no explosions or terrifying conflagrations, but
  the old feud continued to smoulder like a malodorous spring bonfire nearing
  extinction.</p>

  <p>All the circumstances of Eleanor's life happily conspired to give her the
  social precedence she needed for this delicate job of pasturing lions and
  lambs in one serene enclosure. Sam Trimble, as president of the bank where
  practically everybody connected with the University cleared his pittance, was
  a good man to know, especially when you hadn't saved enough money for your
  summer vacation and must negotiate a loan with little collateral beyond
  friendship. Indeed, you would strain a point and consent to attend almost any
  sort of party at Sam's house, for prudential reasons, even if you knew you
  would have to meet people with whom you shared very few interests or
  experiences aside from the elementary fact that you all breathed prairie air
  at approximately the same number of respirations per minute.</p>

  <p>But Eleanor Trimble had not come by her social leadership through mere
  duress. She was born to it. There was no question in anyone's mind about
  that. She had not been party to the celebrated fights. Her Saturday nights
  were planned with craft and executed with skill. She would gather up a
  coterie of top-notch merchants and industrialists and their spouses, and a
  flock of influential professors, and mash them all together into an outwardly
  harmonious compound, blandly indifferent to the fact that many a pair of
  these elements&mdash;if left alone together&mdash;would have blown off the
  roof.</p>

  <p>Eleanor always knew the right thing to say. Aware that every woman she
  knew nursed some private vanity, some pet anxiety, some lambent hope, she
  ministered artfully and effectively to all comers. She was not pretty, but
  you frequently heard people saying they thought she was. It was because they
  liked her. She did something to them that made them like themselves. If you
  analysed her and then totted her up, item by item, the total was surprisingly
  short of the aggregate you had previously guessed at. Eleanor was
  considerably under average height. It required her to gaze up at you, which
  gave you the satisfaction of looking down. So nobody blamed her for that. It
  made the women feel important, and as for the men, the distance Eleanor had
  to look when she gazed up at them made her long-lashed brown eyes wink
  rapidly and tipped her head back so far that it parted her lips into an
  expression of child-like adoration. Her eyes and lips were about all she had
  of physical attractiveness, but they were a-plenty.</p>

  <p>When Mrs Hastings arrived on a Saturday night in a new lace gown cut to
  add seven years to her age and four inches to her girth, Eleanor stood on
  tiptoe to whisper <i>"Lovely!"</i> She was a little liar, but she honestly
  believed that of such little liars is the kingdom of heaven.</p>

  <p>To Mrs James Blodgett whose son Charles&mdash;he had never been worth the
  powder it would have taken&mdash;was reported to have landed a job on the
  <i>Star,</i> Eleanor said, "My dear, what a wonderful chance for that boy! I
  always knew he would make you proud, when he struck his stride."</p>

  <p>Even when you knew that what she was saying was utterly silly, you took it
  and licked the spoon. She had gone to the length of saying to Marcia, "What a
  charming girl your Roberta is coming to be! So gracious! So lovely!" This was
  really carrying things a bit too far, and for an instant Marcia had eyed her
  narrowly to see if she might detect the slightest bulge in her lightly rouged
  cheek; but, noting no such symptom of insincerity, purred softly and thought
  Eleanor a darling, which wasn't far from the truth.</p>

  <p>It was beyond all thought that she who was so gifted in the arts of
  comradeship could content herself with the little conquests she made with her
  woman friends. Eleanor wasn't above planting a murmured word or two of laud,
  honour, praise, and glory into the hairy ear of almost any broad-shouldered
  male. She always timed and placed her seasons of worship in such a manner
  that the idol could hardly fail to appreciate her offering. If it was
  supposed to be a private matter, she would reach up and detain Bill by the
  sleeve just long enough to whisper, out of the corner of her expressive
  mouth, "I heard what a killing you made in cotton, Little One. Nice work!"
  Or, she would capitalize a brief lull in conversation by calling half-way
  down the long table, "Timmy, if you haven't given that seventy-four-stroke
  ball away, I'd like it, please, initialled." And Timmy would reply, with a
  booming laugh, "O.K. Shall I put 'love and kisses' on it?" And then Eleanor
  would let him have a half-shy wink as she replied, "Thank you, Timmy."</p>

  <p>It was fun and she enjoyed it. She enjoyed it so much that sometimes she
  was utterly foolhardy, as when she said to clumsy old Claude Miner, who owned
  more stock in the Farmers and Mechanics Bank than anyone else in town except
  Sam himself, <i>"Claud!</i> You don't mean to tell me you've worn your
  <i>teeth!"</i> She winked rapidly in happy surprise. "Lovely!" she murmured.
  It was a classic joke that old Claude wore his upper plate only when
  attending funerals in his Knights Templar uniform, on all other occasions
  presenting a mouth reminiscent of the widely spaced monoliths at Stonehenge.
  Sam had said to her that night while they were undressing, "Some time you're
  going to make a pass like that at a fellow who isn't feeble-minded and he'll
  sock you in the noodle." And then Sam laughed again until he had another
  touch of his asthma and had to help himself to a stiff slug of Scotch.
  Eleanor smiled knowingly and remarked, "Claude liked it." And then added,
  half to herself, as she patted the cold cream on her pretty throat, "They
  <i>all</i> like it. <i>You</i> like it.... <i>I</i> like it."</p>

  <p>Claude, who had gone north next day for the deer season, expressed them a
  quarter of venison, a week later. The tag read <i>"Mrs</i> Samuel J.
  Trimble".</p>

  <p>"You see?" teased Eleanor. "It pays to be nice to people."</p>

  <p>And so it did. Eleanor was becoming increasingly resourceful in winning
  friends. It was an amusing game to play; more exacting than bridge, more
  exciting than golf, more rewarding than either. It wasn't that she merely
  enjoyed the sensation of conquest. Sometimes her eyes were very sober when
  she remembered the effect she had produced with certain adroit encouragements
  and flatteries; for example, the pathetically wistful expression on frail
  little Mrs Morris's face when Eleanor told her how very well she was looking.
  Mrs Morris was worrying her heart out over that cancer.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, of course, you couldn't help chuckling when you thought of the
  way the eminent Professor Wemble had turned out to be a cunning little kitten
  when you had dragged him off into a corner to button his sleeve-link. No
  matter what was being talked of, the Professor was for ever sure to be
  reminded of something that Hegel or Fichte had said, but at this moment he
  had just breathed heavily and made strange jungle-noises in his larynx.
  Eleanor thought it was fun.</p>

  <p>And so it was&mdash;all of it&mdash;only fun, until that night when she
  and Paul Ward had their sudden, unpredictable unaccountable collision of
  eyes. There hadn't been the slightest occasion for it. She had looked up at
  him with exactly the same gaily beaming, friendly, flattering brown eyes that
  had been radiantly lifted a full half-dozen times into other eyes in the
  course of the past two hours. This time she found it difficult to get away
  from the curious mesmerism of Paul's sober, steady gaze. She felt a sudden
  glow, a hard bump-bump in her heart, and wondered what it was all about.</p>

  <p>The evening had drawn to a close. Eleanor had asked Paul to help gather up
  the tally-cards. Then they had gone into the library to inspect the scores.
  Laying the cards out on the desk, they had bent over them, touching
  elbows.</p>

  <p>"Alice Patterson, apparently," said Eleanor. "I'm glad of that. She's had
  wretched luck lately."</p>

  <p>"It seems Sam has the best score for the men," said Paul.</p>

  <p>"Sam won't want to take a prize. He hates it, when he's the host."</p>

  <p>"I know&mdash;but it's customary, isn't it? Whoever wins it, gets it, even
  if he did have to pay for it himself." They laughed&mdash;a little more than
  the pleasantry was worth.</p>

  <p>"Very well," conceded Eleanor. "Let poor old Sam win a prize once." She
  gathered up the cards, one by one.</p>

  <p>"I don't feel that Sam is in need of any sympathy," said Paul quietly. "He
  has always been quite lucky&mdash;at everything."</p>

  <p>Eleanor glanced up, smiled brightly, suddenly sobered, dropped her eyes,
  looked up again, became conscious of a little tremor on her lips, flushed
  slightly, and then said in a throaty undertone, "You shouldn't look at
  people&mdash;that way. You'll&mdash;you might break somebody's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mr Blodgett chose that instant to barge into the library.</p>

  <p>"I say, Mrs Trimble, they're calling for you."</p>

  <p>"Righto! We've finished. We'll be there instantly."</p>

  <p>Blodgett retired, leaving them standing a little way apart, facing each
  other. For a moment they waited in a mutual constraint. Then she smiled and
  tucked a trembling hand under his arm companionably.</p>

  <p>"We must go," she said.</p>

  <p>"Of course," assented Paul, rather unsteadily.</p>

  <p>Just within the door she paused, looked up into his eyes again, and said,
  "It's odd&mdash;isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied, "It is."</p>

  <p>She was in radiant spirits again by the time they rejoined the others.</p>

  <p>When the last of them had gone home, she said to Sam, "Mind if I toddle
  off to bed? I'm tired."</p>

  <p>Seated at her dressing-table, Eleanor studied her eyes. Always, after a
  party, it was fun to remember the things one had said and done to make people
  pleased with themselves. This experience to-night was something different. It
  hadn't been fun. It was too serious.</p>

  <p>Reviewing the little episode, moment by moment, she wondered just what she
  had done, what she had said, how she looked, to provoke this flashing change
  in their casual acquaintance. What they had been saying to each other was
  nothing, mere banter and chaff. What Paul had implied when he referred to Sam
  was all of a piece with the playful compliments he had often bestowed, same
  sort of pleasantry all the other men liked to think they were good at. What
  had happened? They had exchanged a look that had given them a strange
  reaction.</p>

  <p>"It's odd&mdash;isn't it?" she heard herself saying. Why had she said
  that? Trying to be frank, perhaps. It was the wrong thing to have said. And
  Paul had agreed, soberly, that it was indeed "odd". But what else could she
  say? He couldn't very well blurt out clumsily, <i>"What's</i> odd?" It was
  probably all her own fault. Now they would either be stiff and suspicious of
  each other, or let themselves go again and take the chance of making
  themselves very restless and unhappy. She had despised these nasty little
  affairs with all her heart.</p>

  <p>Taking up her brush, Eleanor swept it through her black hair several
  times, almost savagely. She had been a fool. There wouldn't be any more of
  it, she could promise you <i>that!</i> She would take pains not to see Paul
  Ward alone, ever again.</p>

  <p>The strokes of the brush were lighter. She laid it down, propped her
  elbows on the table, laced her fingers under her chin, stared into the glass;
  and, living it all through once more, frowned witheringly at herself, sighed
  deeply, closed her eyes, and smiled.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>After that they seemed always to be bumping into each other at every
  corner, though this could be easily explained, Paul thought, by the fact that
  each of them had become acutely conscious of the other.</p>

  <p>Eleanor was valiantly trying to put things to rights by being especially
  attentive to Marcia, who, gladly reciprocating these pleasant hospitalities,
  was planning all of her social events so that the Trimbles would be not only
  front-rank guests, but obviously of the inner circle. The two women quickly
  arrived at an intimacy which coupled their names in the guest-lists of every
  hostess in their social set. If either was asked to pour at a tea, both of
  them poured.</p>

  <p>Marcia, fighting a hard bridge battle with doughty opponents&mdash;the
  last hand of the evening&mdash;would say confidentially to Eleanor, whose
  hand had been laid out on an adjoining table, "Would you mind,
  dear&mdash;telling Hannah to serve now?" And Eleanor would go to the kitchen,
  where she was almost as much at home as in her own house, and start things
  going. It had become that sort of relationship.</p>

  <p>As this intimacy tightened, Eleanor saw more and more of the competent,
  respectful, observant Hannah. Sometimes she surprised herself with the
  efforts she made to win favour in the esteem of this resourceful servant of
  the Wards. She never felt quite comfortable, much less superior, in Hannah's
  presence.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that the quietly efficient woman had ever said or done anything
  implying a rebuke, a rebuff, or a disapproval of her mistress's closest
  friend. Indeed, Hannah always had a gracious smile for her and responded with
  cheerful alacrity to any little suggestion offered when Eleanor was playing
  assistant hostess at Marcia's teas and dinners. But immediately back of that
  smile there was always a look of inquiry&mdash;anxious inquiry. Eleanor often
  asked herself whether this was purely imaginary, founded on nothing more
  substantial than her own sensitiveness to the delicate situation, or whether
  Hannah had really noticed.</p>

  <p>As the winter wore on, the increasingly close contact of the Wards and the
  Trimbles encouraged all manner of comradely familiarities. Their friends,
  recognizing this intimacy, never thought of inviting one pair without the
  other, no matter how few guests were bidden. They constituted an inseparable
  foursome at the theatre, at the games, at the City Club. On Sam's birthday
  dinner at the Wards' he had kissed Marcia when she presented him with the
  droll, wooden penguin&mdash;a sequel to some little joke between
  them&mdash;and Marcia had seemed no more stirred by his boisterous bumblebee
  caress that she might have been if he were eighty and she was eight.</p>

  <p>"Tut, tut!" admonished Paul, to which Eleanor added, "Now, now!" And then
  they had stolen a glance of each other, exchanging an enigmatic smile,
  realizing that while the cousinly kiss of Sam and Marcia was accomplished
  without any emotion at all the cryptic look that they themselves exchanged
  had almost the value of an embrace.</p>

  <p>But, beyond these fleeting intercommunications implying a wealth of
  undemonstrated tenderness, their relation was impeccably discreet. They made
  no effort to see each other alone. By common consent they had gone to much
  pains to avoid such opportunities.</p>

  <p>A half-hour after the birthday kiss&mdash;it was mid-May and they had
  moved out on to the broad veranda for their coffee and
  cigarettes&mdash;Eleanor had expressed a wish to hear a new orchestral record
  that Marcia had spoken about with much enthusiasm. Paul cheerfully acceded
  and went into the living-room, Eleanor following. Together they bent over the
  album of records, looking for the one she wanted.</p>

  <p>"All things considered," remarked Paul, in an even undertone, "I think
  we've done pretty damn' well, don't you?"</p>

  <p>Eleanor smiled and nodded without looking up.</p>

  <p>"And we're going to keep on doing pretty damn' well," she replied,
  matching his intonation.... "I love this thing." She hummed a few bars of an
  aria from 'Madame Butterfly'... <i>"Aren't</i> we?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," assented Paul, rummaging in the table-drawer for a fresh
  needle.</p>

  <p>"I'm quite proud of us, really," she pursued softly.</p>

  <p>"Yep," he agreed, trying to be casually unsentimental, "we're a remarkable
  pair, Eleanor. But"&mdash;his voice lowered&mdash;"I don't believe you'd
  better risk giving me anything for <i>my</i> birthday."</p>

  <p>"When is it?" she ventured, eyes still intent on the record-album.</p>

  <p>"I won't tell you. Here's that Sibelius you were looking for."</p>

  <p>"Afraid?" she teased.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," drawled Paul. "Now we'd better talk about something
  else."</p>

  <p>To his considerable surprise, Eleanor glanced up, regarded him with
  brooding eyes, and murmured, <i>"Is</i> there anything else?" A moment later
  she was reproaching herself for it, aware that the memory of her audacious
  remark would haunt her later.</p>

  <p>Paul despised people who went in for martyrdoms, but it pleased him to
  reflect that his attitude towards Eleanor, in the face of all the
  circumstances, had been distinguished for its good sportsmanship. It had not
  been an easy role to play. Eleanor was provocative and desirable. Sometimes
  he wondered if she fully realized that her so frequently obvious efforts to
  avoid a chance contact with him were simply confessions of a wish. Doubtless
  she felt the same way about his own studied stoicism. It was as if they kept
  saying to each other, "Don't touch me, please. I can play the game through,
  barring accidents, but&mdash;mind your step. I'm as human as you are!"</p>

  <p>Now and again, perhaps unwittingly, Eleanor had made it just a bit
  difficult. Maybe it wasn't her fault; for, after all, Sam seemed bent on
  pairing them together in moments when they had been better off a little
  farther apart; at the theatre, for instance, where Eleanor was invariably
  seated next to Paul. There was no wilful touching of hands in the dark. He
  tried honestly enough to keep his distance, but the seats were close and he
  was broad-shouldered. He could sense the warmth of her through his sleeve,
  keenly aware of her every movement, her breathing, her heart-beats. Not
  infrequently they shared a long, deep half-sigh, almost as if they had
  planned it, timed it, and found it comforting.</p>

  <p>Now it was June. The children, except Sally, were on their way to their
  summer camps. Paul and Marcia were sailing on Saturday for the long-intended
  trip to England. Sam and Eleanor had given them a gay and noisy going-away
  party at the Country Club on Wednesday night, and now&mdash;Thursday
  afternoon&mdash;they had driven over to say good-bye, for they had a dinner
  engagement and the trippers were leaving for the East at eight.</p>

  <p>The four of them had wandered about for a while in the grounds, Sam and
  Marcia loitering at the far end of the garden to admire Sally's flowers. She
  had gone in for roses, ever since the splendid success Mrs Edmunds had had
  with them.</p>

  <p>Paul had been talking about a travel-book on England, remarking on its
  quaint woodcuts.</p>

  <p>"You would love them, Eleanor," put in Marcia. "Why don't you show them to
  her, Paul?"</p>

  <p>So they had sauntered to the house and into the library, where he found
  the book, opened it on the table and leafed to the pictures he had found most
  amusing. Presently he tossed the book aside and they stood facing each other
  at close range.</p>

  <p>"I'll be missing you, Eleanor," he said, his eyes tender.</p>

  <p>"You know I'll be thinking about you, Paul, every day&mdash;every minute."
  She laid both hands on his arms and he drew her slightly towards him.
  "Good-bye," she whispered, smiling up into his eyes.</p>

  <p>At this instant, Hannah appeared in the doorway with a tray of tall
  glasses, stood for a moment with a baffled expression on her face, and
  quietly retreated.</p>

  <p>They drew apart, Paul considerably shaken.</p>

  <p>"I'd much rather that hadn't happened," he muttered huskily. "Hannah
  probably thinks I was on the point of kissing you."</p>

  <p>"Well," she laughed, nervously&mdash;"weren't you?"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Hannah lay awake most of the night fretting over the situation she had
  blundered into by accident.</p>

  <p>If Bertha, bearing a tray of lemonade to the library, had returned to say
  she had seen Mr Ward about to kiss Mrs Trimble, Hannah would have been
  disappointed, but not surprised. But it was a distinct shock to have had a
  close-up view of this traitorous conduct.</p>

  <p>Her intuition, supported by occasional bits of inferential evidence, had
  informed Hannah, many months ago, of the strong bond that existed between
  these two. She knew the situation was charged with high explosives, but
  something told her that Paul and Eleanor were playing the game courageously.
  And she loved them both for it. There wasn't anything so glorious as sound
  self-control.</p>

  <p>More than a little anxious, Hannah had been particularly observant of
  their attitude towards each other, noting with satisfaction that they never
  capitalized a chance to be alone together. In fact, it had been their careful
  avoidance of each other's hands that first stirred her curiosity. But
  sometimes there was an exchange of glances&mdash;briefly, inquiring,
  responding, tenderly cautioning, gently reassuring.</p>

  <p>It had made Hannah admire them. This was the sort of fortitude she liked.
  Any exhibition of calm, purposeful restraint stirred her to the depths. It
  was no small matter, she felt, for these people to be infatuated with each
  other&mdash;hurled into one another's presence day after day by conditions
  over which they now had but little control&mdash;yet enduring it all without
  yielding to its temptations. Apparently they had resolved to give no quarter
  to their feelings. They had a hard job to do and they meant to do it! It
  thrilled Hannah's soul.</p>

  <p>On first sight, she had catalogued Eleanor Trimble as a superficial,
  socially ambitious restless little butterfly. And she might have kept on
  thinking that for ever had it not been for her gradual discovery of the
  secret. Eleanor Trimble had good sound stuff in her. So had Paul. She was
  proud of him. But prouder of Eleanor; for, after all, it was the woman who
  always carried most of the responsibility in such situations. About
  eighty-five per cent of this job was Eleanor's rightful share, thought
  Hannah.</p>

  <p>Now they had broken over. It was understandable, for they were to be
  separated for months. Doubtless they had yielded to it on impulse.</p>

  <p>Hannah tried to view the matter sensibly, sympathetically. She hadn't
  lived in day-by-day contact with Marcia Ward for a dozen years without
  arriving at a few conclusions about her. So very often Mrs Ward had just
  missed being on the right spot at a moment when she was most needed. How
  frequently she had voiced a doubt when she might have pretended, at least, to
  express a hope. And sometimes she had ventured a half-hearted hope when the
  moment had come to declare her indubitable faith. Many a time she had gone up
  to her room to cry when some emergency downstairs demanded her presence.
  Hannah distrusted the enheartening value of a damp handkerchief.</p>

  <p>Of course, Paul wouldn't have held it against Marcia, then or now. He
  simply did not expect anything better of his pretty wife. He would have
  defended her to the utmost, on the ground that it wasn't in Marcia's line to
  lift or pull or come running up to say and do the needful thing. She wasn't
  to be blamed. It wasn't in her.</p>

  <p>Now that Paul had taken his meteoric flight into a success his pretty wife
  had not foreseen, or had the slightest faith in, or contributed to in any
  manner whatsoever, Marcia was glad enough to accommodate herself to their new
  privileges, but remained consistently disinterested in the business that had
  made them rich. Paul had often tried to tell her what he was doing in
  co-operation with the manufacturing company's engineers, and she would parry
  with a dimpled smile that all such things were beyond her&mdash;as indeed
  they were. Sometimes, after dinner, he would come out to the kitchen and talk
  with Hannah about his affairs. That wasn't the way it ought to be. One of
  these days some strong, wide-awake, attractive woman of his own class would
  listen to him comprehendingly&mdash;and then what?</p>

  <p>If the woman wanted to she could absorb Paul's attention; and he,
  pardonably flattered by it, might be led into some shabby romance.</p>

  <p>From the very first days of the Ward-Trimble chumminess, Hannah believed
  that Eleanor was entirely eligible for this part, and gratefully admired her
  when it was clear that she had no notion of making off with Paul. It was a
  situation loaded with danger, however.</p>

  <p>Eleanor would say, at one of their frequent foursome dinners, "I see
  copper's up again to-day, Paul. If the bulls carry on with it, will that
  raise the price of your refrigerator?"</p>

  <p>And Marcia would remark, shrilly, airily, "Fancy your knowing about things
  like that, Eleanor!"</p>

  <p>And then Sam would say dryly&mdash;though you could see he was proud of
  her&mdash;"Yeah, Eleanor knows the big board better'n any other man in town.
  Whenever she says 'Sell', you'd better get to a telephone and do something
  about it pronto if you don't want to lose your shirt."</p>

  <p>Eleanor could talk about anything. She was wise, witty, well-informed,
  clever in repartee. And, plus all that, she was deliciously feminine. It
  wasn't much wonder that Paul liked her.</p>

  <p>But&mdash;dear, dear&mdash;what were we to do now?</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>A murky dawn, colour of ashes, was threatening to present another sultry
  day. Jaded by a long night of sleeplessness and worry, Hannah sat up in bed
  and rubbed her hot eyes. Then she shook her head and made a little gesture of
  despair. No&mdash;there was nothing she could do. Somebody ought to talk to
  Mrs Trimble, but that somebody wasn't Hannah. She had a reputation for doing
  audacious things. She was well aware that the close friends of the Wards
  considered her a unique character and were amused over the many stories,
  which Paul often told with delight, of Hannah's odd relation to his
  household. Sometimes, in her presence, he or Mrs Ward would make a playful
  allusion to the high-handed manner in which she had bossed them all for
  years. The Trimbles had often joined in this friendly teasing. Maybe she
  could presume a little on that. But no&mdash;this was too delicate a
  matter.</p>

  <p>On first thought Hannah felt it might possibly be risked. She had imagined
  herself going to Mrs Trimble and saying: "Please don't break up the only home
  I have. I am very much alone in the world. You have your home. Let us keep
  ours." Of course, she would try to say it kindly and tactfully. But was there
  any way to do such an impudent thing as that&mdash;kindly and tactfully?
  No&mdash;Eleanor Trimble couldn't be counted on to listen patiently to an
  impertinence so unpardonable, not even from a person like Hannah who enjoyed
  some unusual privileges of speech and action in the Ward home.</p>

  <p>For a while she had figured on the probable effect if she went to Mrs
  Trimble with a little gift-basket containing a jar of consommé, a bottle of
  home-made grape-juice, and a few glasses of jelly. And Mrs Trimble would say,
  "Why, Hannah&mdash;did you think I was sick?" And then she could reply, "Yes,
  Mrs Trimble, that was the only way I could account for it." And then Mrs
  Trimble would let her talk about it. But, no&mdash;that wouldn't do. Eleanor
  Trimble was a very gracious person, but she wouldn't consent to a rebuke from
  Hannah, no matter how richly deserved or how artfully brought to her
  attention. Hannah drew a long sigh, stood at the open window for a little
  while, mechanically dressed for the day's work, and went softly down the back
  stairs. After all, that was where she belonged, wasn't it? How silly even to
  have dreamed of a heart-to-heart with the banker's wife?</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>At three that afternoon Mrs Trimble breezed in to recover her copy of the
  Wards' itinerary and mailing addresses. She was rather noisily amiable,
  causing Hannah to wonder whether the errand hadn't been invented. It was a
  little like the old story about the murderer who returns to the scene of his
  crime.</p>

  <p>"I left it on the desk in the library, Hannah," she said. "May I look for
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, Mrs Trimble. Shall I help you?"</p>

  <p>"I know where it is, Hannah. Thanks." She disappeared through the library
  door, returning in a moment to say she had found it and that it had been
  stupid of her to have forgotten it. She had avoided Hannah's eyes upon her
  arrival, but now gave her a direct smile. "I must say, Hannah," she declared,
  in the friendliest of tones, "Mr and Mrs Ward are certainly fortunate to be
  able to pack up whenever they like and leave their home knowing it will be in
  such good hands as yours. Really, you're a treasure, Hannah! How is little
  Sally?"</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Mrs Trimble. Sally is out in her garden. Would you like me to
  call her? I know she would be happy to see you. The child has been lonely
  to-day."</p>

  <p>"I'll go out where she is, Hannah. I can stop only a minute. How nice for
  you that Sally is to be at home this summer. She's such a dear." Mrs Trimble
  seemed in no hurry to go, after all, and tentatively seated herself on the
  arm of the davenport. "I suppose she seems almost like your own, you've had
  so much to do with bringing her up&mdash;from her babyhood. I know how much
  you mean to Sally. It's a very beautiful relationship, Hannah. You've been
  just like a mother to these children&mdash;almost as good as having some of
  your own."</p>

  <p>Hannah smiled and said: "Thank you, Mrs Trimble. I am fond of all the
  family. They have been very good to me."</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course," said Mrs Trimble, adding, "that's as it should be. Very
  pleasant for you all." This comment was made with a casualness suggesting
  that enough had now been said on this matter, and Hannah expected Mrs Trimble
  would rise and proceed to the garden, but she remained where she was,
  tentatively swinging one small white-shod foot as if waiting for
  something.</p>

  <p>One thing seemed fairly certain. Mrs Trimble was here on a little mission
  of conciliation. Clearly she wanted very much to know where she stood in
  Hannah's regard. Perhaps if Hannah showed herself to be friendly, that would
  mean that she hadn't been too much upset by yesterday's little misadventure
  and would be disposed to forget it. Mrs Trimble might be wondering whether a
  bit of coldness and stiffness on Hannah's part, carried forward into the
  future, would stir Mrs Ward's curiosity to the point of inquiring why she
  disliked their friend.</p>

  <p>And wasn't it a little strange&mdash;Mrs Trimble's telling Hannah she had
  been such a good mother to the Ward children? But not so strange, though. Mrs
  Trimble was for ever saying pleasant things to people, piling it on almost
  too thickly for comfort sometimes. And hadn't she often said almost the same
  things to Hannah&mdash;about her usefulness and how fortunate the Wards were
  to have her? But even so&mdash;might there not be, in the back of that canny
  little head, a wish that Hannah might express, by a word or an inflection,
  what she really thought of Mrs Ward as an incompetent mother&mdash;probably
  also a doubtful success as a wife. If Hannah could be made to give her
  thoughts away, by so much as a cryptic pucker of the lips, then Eleanor
  Trimble could feel comforted in her belief that Hannah&mdash;if not exactly
  on her side&mdash;would at least condone the affair as thoroughly
  understandable.</p>

  <p>While these queries raced through Hannah's mind, Mrs Trimble sat
  negligently swinging a shapely leg and toying with the latch of her white
  leather handbag.</p>

  <p>"I must be on my way," she decided abruptly. "If there is anything we can
  do for you, Hannah, you'll call up, won't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mrs Trimble, thank you." Hannah smiled gratefully, interested to see
  the genuine relief expressed on Mrs Trimble's face as she turned to go.
  Presently she heard Sally's voice answering from the garden. Sally would be
  glad to receive this little attention. She had been quite demure all day.</p>

  <p>Now Hannah was more worried than ever. Not only had she no plans for doing
  something that seemed to need doing, but she had been unable to avoid an
  implied approval of Mrs Trimble. The woman had given her every possible
  chance to disclose how she felt to-day about the thing that had occurred
  yesterday, and Hannah hadn't been the slightest mite disturbed; cordial,
  respectful, genial. It was exactly as if she had said to Mrs Trimble, "You
  know what I saw, but I don't really care. It's your business and I wish you
  joy of it." Hannah was not quite content to leave the matter stand that
  way.</p>

  <p>She wondered if it wouldn't be a little more honest, and hopeful too, if
  she should ask Eleanor Trimble back into the house, after she was through
  talking to Sally, and say frankly: "I have seen you and Mr Ward wishing you
  could be something more than friends. It has been going on for a long time,
  and I've been so very proud of you both. You were simply wonderful! Yesterday
  you both slipped a little, but that's easy to understand. He was going away.
  I know that when they come back, you'll see to it that nothing happens again.
  Please, Mrs Trimble. You've been so fine. I like you so much. Don't hurt us.
  You won't, will you?"</p>

  <p>Mrs Trimble might consent to be talked to in that spirit. And again, she
  might not. It was a risky thing to try. She was going now, crossing the rear
  lawn diagonally. She would not come back into the house. Her car was standing
  at the kerb in front. Hannah's heart was in her mouth as she went down the
  rear steps into the garden, shading her eyes against the sun.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, Hannah!" Mrs Trimble waved a hand, hesitated, was about to go
  on.</p>

  <p>"I made some red raspberry jam to-day, Mrs Trimble. If you wait a minute
  I'll give you a glass to take to Mr Trimble. He likes it so well."</p>

  <p>"Thanks so much, Hannah. Shall I come in?"</p>

  <p>"Please.... It's cooler inside."</p>

  <p>Eleanor followed, wondering just how much cooler it was going to be
  inside. Well&mdash;she'd asked for it, hadn't she?</p>

  <p>Hannah preceded her into the spotlessly clean, white enamelled
  kitchen.</p>

  <p>"There!" raid Hannah, holding up the glass jar to the light. "Isn't that
  pretty?"</p>

  <p>"Lovely! You're a darling, Hannah, to want me to have it. If there's any
  little thing I ever can do for you&mdash;will you tell me?"</p>

  <p>Hannah tapped meditatively on the white porcelain table with her fingers,
  her head bent in earnest thought. There was a moment's quite stressful
  silence.</p>

  <p>"Say it, Hannah!" demanded Eleanor. "I'll listen. Don't be afraid."</p>

  <p>Lifting her misty eyes slowly, Hannah smiled compassionately and murmured,
  "Oh&mdash;Mrs Trimble&mdash;you had always been so fine!"</p>

  <p>Eleanor tugged off her hat and rubbed the back of her hand across her
  forehead.</p>

  <p>"That's the hell of it, Hannah," she growled. "Please tell me
  why&mdash;you keep on making&mdash;people&mdash;<i>so damned fine!"</i></p>

  <p>They faced each other&mdash;almost challengingly.</p>

  <p>"Want to talk about it?" said Hannah quietly.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" snapped Eleanor. "Go right ahead! Get it off your chest!"</p>

  <p>"I haven't anything else to say, Mrs Trimble&mdash;really!"</p>

  <p>"Yes you have, too!" declared Eleanor fiercely. "You're
  disgusted&mdash;and disappointed."</p>

  <p>Hannah smiled companionably.</p>

  <p>"It's not becoming for a person of my station to speak her mind about
  anything like that."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;we'll forget about your station, now. This is to be strictly
  man-to-man talk."</p>

  <p>Hannah shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I really haven't anything to say, Mrs Trimble, except"&mdash;she
  hesitated for a moment&mdash;"except&mdash;I had been so proud of you; so
  very proud of you."</p>

  <p>It was something of a shock to Peter when he learned that his Aunt Hannah
  was a servant.</p>

  <p>After the manner of other normal children, he had taken a great many
  things for granted without inquiring into them at all. For example, it had
  never occurred to him to ask why his Aunt Hannah lived in the home of
  Professor Ward or what relation she sustained to that household. Obviously
  she lived with the Wards for much the same reason that he lived with his
  mother. People had to live somewhere, and Aunt Hannah lived with the Wards.
  There was nothing odd or questionable about that.</p>

  <p>Now that he had discovered she was the Wards' maid, he had a perplexed
  feeling about her. He resented the idea. It puzzled him, grieved him,
  and&mdash;to be truthful&mdash;it shamed him. And that was because all he
  knew about domestic servants had been deduced for his observation of Susie
  Stoup, who had been with them ever since he could remember.</p>

  <p>There wasn't the slightest trace of snobbery in Lydia Edmunds. If Peter
  had ever inquired of her whether Susie was as good as they were, Lydia would
  have replied promptly in the affirmative. <i>Of course</i> Susie Stoup was
  their equal, at least in the sight of God and the preamble to the
  Constitution. But, let all that be as it might, Peter would have recognized a
  sizeable difference between his mother's relation to the neighbourhood and
  Susie's.</p>

  <p>Albeit faithful and obedient, Susie Stoup possessed about as much
  initiative as one of Peter's white rabbits. She didn't have nearly as much
  personality as Gyp, who had just missed being a collie. Susie had no wit, no
  style, and almost no education. She kept the house clean and was a good,
  plain cook. Now and then her friend Emma, employed in a neighbouring home,
  would drop in and help her do the dishes so they could go to the movies. Emma
  was a clumsy, dowdy creature, admirably suited to be Susie's chum. To the
  best of Peter's knowledge, these two were typical domestics. And now his Aunt
  Hannah had turned out to be one herself.</p>

  <p>He wished it had been someone else who had been appointed to break this
  bad news to him. Of course Sally had done it innocently enough and by sheer
  accident, and she had been prompt in her efforts to make repairs when she saw
  what had happened. He did not hold it against Sally.</p>

  <p>Aunt Adele had asked to take him again to Bar Harbour for the summer, and
  his mother had consented. They were to leave for Chicago on Friday to meet
  this adorable woman, of whom he had chattered almost too much throughout the
  year. And at Bar Harbour he would undoubtedly be seeing his marvellous friend
  Mr Bradford, who, in his esteem, was a close second to Aunt Adele.</p>

  <p>And now&mdash;as if he wasn't happy enough&mdash;Aunt Hannah had
  telephoned that she was coming down to-day to say good-bye to him, and was
  bringing Sally Ward along! He could hardly contain himself.</p>

  <p>Lydia indulgently consented to drive to the station twenty minutes before
  the train was due, so urgent was Peter's impatience. And when Sally actually
  appeared in the vestibule of the train and descended the steps, Peter's heart
  pounded hard. He had tried to remember how she looked last summer, but he
  realized now that he hadn't done her justice; her gold hair, her blue eyes,
  her dimples&mdash;the dimples were ever so much deeper than he had
  thought.</p>

  <p>Aunt Hannah kissed him and his mother, and then his mother kissed Sally.
  Peter wasn't quite sure what was expected of him in his greeting to Sally,
  but it seemed fairly clear that a kiss was not in order. He hated to shake
  hands with people. Fortunately Sally was carrying a small basket; he took it
  from her, and they exchanged a smile.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Sally," "Hello, Peter," they said. She had the loveliest voice.
  And Peter liked her coral dress.</p>

  <p>"How tall you're growing!" she observed, as they followed along towards
  the car. "If you keep on, you'll&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You grew, too," interposed Peter magnanimously, when it had become
  evident that Sally hadn't really any definite plans for him in the event of
  his being taller. It wasn't exactly what he wanted to say. He wished he had
  the courage to tell her how pretty she was. Without turning his head, he
  glanced at her out of the tail of his eye, a distinguishing trick of his that
  people often thought was drollishly grown-up, and Sally laughed a little.</p>

  <p>"You haven't changed much, though," she said judiciously. "How are the
  rabbits?"</p>

  <p>It didn't seem to matter much how they were, for his mother was telling
  Sally to sit beside her, and he and Aunt Hannah were getting into the seat
  behind them. Now that he could look at Sally without being caught at it, he
  comforted himself with a comprehensive view of her neck, her curls, her coral
  beads, her jaunty straw hat.</p>

  <p>"And how are you this fine morning?" Aunt Hannah was inquiring,
  affectionately patting his knee.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is, isn't it?" agreed Peter, from afar. Hannah's face was
  troubled. Here she was, again involving herself in the risk of throwing these
  children together. She had done everything she could to forestall it, but
  Peter's letter to Sally had made it very difficult.</p>

  <p>So far as she knew, neither of the children had made much of an effort to
  further their acquaintance. Sally had received two postcards from Peter
  during his vacation a year ago, one from Boston and another from Bar Harbour.
  She had shown them to Hannah without any shyness, and had betrayed no
  alarming symptoms when Hannah had read her Peter's brief letters.</p>

  <p>On Christmas they had exchanged greeting-cards. Sally had kept hers in
  plain sight on her little desk long after all the other Christmas cards had
  been put away; but there was nothing sentimental about it&mdash;picture of a
  Scottie, tousling a stocking on a rug strewn with candy. Sally might have
  kept it because she thought the picture amusing.</p>

  <p>When it had been decided that Peter was to go East again with Adele he had
  written to Sally.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you tell me, Hannah, about Peter's going away?" she queried.
  "Can't we see him before he leaves? You want to, don't you?"</p>

  <p>No excuses sounded convincing. The fact was that she did want to see Peter
  before he left. It was quite impossible to satisfy Sally with some flimsy
  reason why they couldn't go to Waterloo. So, with much reluctance, Hannah had
  consented, hoping that Peter would be so much occupied with his own affairs
  that he would find little time for Sally.</p>

  <p>And now here he was, meeting them at the train, and so utterly carried
  away by Sally that he seemed in a trance. Hannah knew now that she should
  have been firm in her decision not to let them see each other any more. The
  thought grieved her. How happy she would have been, she reflected, to see
  these two&mdash;beloved by her above all others&mdash;finding themselves more
  and more closely drawn together. What might have been a promise had now
  become a threat. If they persisted in their boy-and-girl friendship, it
  wouldn't be long until Peter would be coming to see Sally, or inquiring why
  he couldn't. And if he did, he would promptly learn that his Aunt Hannah was
  something other than he had thought. And on top of that, there was the risk
  of his discovering that she was his mother. Mrs Ward would ask questions. She
  might even suspect there was a slight resemblance.</p>

  <p>Sometimes Hannah had moments when she devoutly wished she had never
  ventured upon this difficult programme of trying to ensure Peter's social
  position. Occasionally she wondered whether it would not be a relief to tell
  the Wards all about it, and to tell Peter, too. And then she would remember
  how she had spent her life fagging for other people&mdash;"Yes, ma'am", "No,
  ma'am", "Thank you, ma'am", "Very good, ma'am; if I may say so". Of course
  there had been plenty of happiness, too. She was bound to admit that. But
  Peter must be kept free of this handicap. Peter must go to college and fit
  himself for something important. He must have influential friends.
  And&mdash;above all&mdash;he must never be put to the pain and chagrin of
  having it known that his mother was not of his own station.</p>

  <p>As she watched her boy's intent concentration on Sally's pretty head,
  Hannah began searching her mind for some excuse to take the late afternoon
  train for home instead of waiting until night. It would shorten the time,
  shorten the hazard.</p>

  <p>"They've made two tennis courts on the school grounds, Sally," Peter was
  saying. "Want to play this afternoon?"</p>

  <p>Sally turned to smile radiantly and nodded a vigorous assent that shook
  her curls; then, suddenly remembering, she said: "But I have no tennis shoes.
  I could have brought them."</p>

  <p>Relieved by the prospect of a game of tennis for them, instead of a
  dangerous <i>tête-à-téte</i> in the garden, Hannah quickly suggested:
  "Perhaps you might borrow a pair. Patty Wyman's, maybe."</p>

  <p>"Huh!" scoffed Peter. <i>"Her</i> big feet!"</p>

  <p>Lydia laughed merrily, but Hannah drew a little sigh. Peter was so
  infatuated with Sally that he was slightly out of his head. Feet, indeed! And
  since when had Sally such remarkably small feet?</p>

  <p>"They don't cost very much," Sally was saying. "I'll buy some new ones if
  you'll lend me the money, Hannah."</p>

  <p>Funny, thought Peter, how Sally always called his Aunt Hannah by her first
  name.</p>

  <p>But first, before they went downtown to get the tennis shoes, Sally wanted
  to see Gyp and the rabbits and the roses; so they strolled across the rear
  lawn on a tour of inspection.</p>

  <p>Conversation lagged a little in the rose arbour, and Peter said: "I wish
  you were going to Bar Harbour. We'd have fun."</p>

  <p>Sally nodded and said she supposed they would. And then, for a moment,
  there didn't seem to be anything else to say. Peter opened his knife and
  carefully whittled the soft bark from a maple twig.</p>

  <p>"We'd better go, maybe," suggested Sally. "Hannah will be waiting for
  us."</p>

  <p>"Has my Aunt Hannah lived at your house always?" asked Peter
  irrelevantly.</p>

  <p>"All <i>my</i> life," said Sally, stooping to bury her nose in a
  salmon-pink Pandora. "She came to work for us just before I was born."</p>

  <p>"To <i>work</i> for you!" echoed Peter, incredulously.</p>

  <p>And then Sally realised that she had said the wrong thing. Peter didn't
  know! It suddenly swept over her that she had wondered a little at the
  difference there was in Hannah at home and Hannah here in Waterloo. Dear,
  dear&mdash;what had she done?</p>

  <p>"Well not really <i>work,"</i> she amended hastily. "It's almost as if she
  was a relation of ours. I love her same as if she was a member of the family.
  We all think of her that way."</p>

  <p>"What does she do&mdash;at your house?" persisted Peter.</p>

  <p>"Oh, a little of everything&mdash;just like people do, you know. She helps
  mother. Really, we couldn't get along without her. Daddy often says
  that."</p>

  <p>"Does she cook?"</p>

  <p>Sally brightened, and exclaimed that Hannah was the most marvellous cook
  in the world. That was why they let her do the cooking, she supposed, because
  no one else in the family could do it so well. Peter tried to smile a
  response to this compliment to his Aunt Hannah's culinary skill, but it
  quickly faded. He nervously whittled the stick to bits, eyes moodily intent
  on his occupation.</p>

  <p>"Does she eat with you at the table?" he demanded, suddenly searching her
  face.</p>

  <p>For a second Sally contemplated a lie, but Peter's steady gaze
  disconcerted her. She reluctantly shook her head.</p>

  <p>"But she could if she wanted to," declared Sally stoutly. "She just got
  into the habit of not eating with us when we were little, and she would be
  taking care of us while Daddy and Mother&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Huh!" growled Peter. "You mean she works for you, same as our Susie works
  for us. You'd better not say anything about that to my mother. She wouldn't
  like it. And you'd better not let Aunt Hannah know you told me."</p>

  <p>"I'm awfully sorry, Peter." Sally's cheeks were red. "I thought you knew.
  I didn't suppose it was a secret. How could your mother help knowing?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe she does," muttered Peter, wondering if they had conspired to keep
  him in the dark.</p>

  <p>"But I don't see why it should make any difference," insisted Sally
  comfortingly. "Almost everybody works at something. Perhaps Hannah wanted to.
  She likes us; I know she does. It isn't a bit as if she was our maid, Peter.
  Really!"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;maybe not," consented Peter half-heartedly.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry I made you unhappy." Sally's tone was entreating as she winked
  back the tears.</p>

  <p>He smiled a little at that and assured her it was all right. At the moment
  he felt, himself, that he had made too much of the matter. They sauntered
  towards the house and entered by the back door. Hannah was in the kitchen,
  talking to Susie. Of course she had often done so and Peter had not given it
  a second thought. It was just the same as when his mother talked to Susie.
  But it wasn't quite the same now.</p>

  <p>Presently they all got into the car and drove down to Baumgardner's
  Department Store for the tennis shoes. Peter tried to think of some amiable
  contribution to the talk, but nothing occurred to him. He lacked the courage
  to look up into Aunt Hannah's eyes, fearing she might notice that something
  was the matter. Aunt Hannah was very quick to see such things. She covered
  his hand with hers gently and he gave her fingers a little squeeze. It was
  too bad about Aunt Hannah. He pitied her. She seemed a different person.</p>

  <p>Hannah's thoughts were busy, too. Intuitively she sensed that something
  had gone amiss. Perhaps Peter and Sally had had a tiff. She stole a sidelong
  glance at her boy's sober face. The past year had matured him. Last summer's
  experience with Adele had made many changes in his disposition; more
  self-reliant, less childish. She wished she might have a long talk with Adele
  about him and his future. Adele had been so strongly convinced that Peter
  needed to be "brought out". It seemed so silly to talk about a mere child
  that way, as one might about an eighteen-year-old ready for college. Perhaps
  Adele was right. Peter was growing up. Maybe something should be done about
  it. Hannah wished she might express herself to Adele more clearly in a
  letter. Letters always sounded so stiff; at least hers did. She could manage
  to make herself understood in conversation, she believed, but whenever she
  took up a pen she instantly tightened up and the ink fairly froze as it
  ran.</p>

  <p>Once she had almost decided to ask Adele to come on down to Waterloo this
  time, and meet Peter here; but that would be too, too risky. Adele was such a
  featherhead. She might ask the wrong questions, say the wrong things, arouse
  the boy's suspicions. No&mdash;she mustn't be seeing Adele in Peter's
  presence. Plenty of problems now without angling for new ones.</p>

  <p>Peter did not go with them into the shoes department, but loitered along
  the jewellery cases in the forward part of the store. The day hadn't turned
  out as it had promised. However, he was resolved to make the best of it,
  remembering that sometimes a bad worry just cured itself after a day or two.
  Maybe this one would do that. He hoped so. He kept repeating to himself the
  various little consolations Sally had offered. It wasn't as if Aunt Hannah
  really worked for Sally's people. Or, if she did, it was because she wanted
  to, because she loved them, and if she worked&mdash;well, almost everybody
  worked at something. Maybe Aunt Hannah liked it. If she cooked for them,
  perhaps it was&mdash;as Sally had said&mdash;because she was far and away the
  best cook in the house. Why not, then? Peter reviewed Sally's arguments and
  breathed more easily.</p>

  <p>Presently they rejoined him at the front door. Sally carrying her purchase
  under her arm. She smiled, and Peter responded in a way that gratified her
  immensely. He had never seen deeper dimples. At luncheon he found himself
  trying to think of amusing things to say, so the dimples would have a chance
  to show what they could do.</p>

  <p>On the tennis court, his spirits rose. Sally played quite a snappy game
  for a girl, and kept Peter dancing. He exulted in her swift service, and was
  proud of her when it became evident that he would not have to temper his
  bombardment of her for courtesy's sake.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, when she leaped to reach a high one, there was a candid display
  of round, pink bare knees&mdash;like a baby's. It made him feel very tender
  towards Sally. He felt very much older than she, and thought of her
  protectively. The idea lingered in his mind afterwards. Often he day-dreamed
  about saving her from some danger; drowning, usually, now that he had become
  a good swimmer. In the months that immediately followed, Peter rescued Sally
  from all manner of aquatic accidents in which she stumbled off wharves,
  tumbled out of canoes, and on one momentous occasion&mdash;from which he woke
  perspiring&mdash;fell overboard from a ship in the middle of the ocean. It
  had been a big job to save Sally that time, but he had done it.</p>

  <p>At the station she said, "Are you going to send me a post-card when you
  get there?"</p>

  <p>"Sure," promised Peter. "I'll write you a letter."</p>

  <p>"Maybe you won't have time to do that," murmured the Eternal Woman in
  Sally, coyly presenting the ancient combination of pensive eyes and a
  provocative smile.</p>

  <p>The train was coming now. Lydia kissed Sally and Hannah, too, for she had
  just decided to go to Virginia in a week, for a visit with Carrie and Henry
  while Peter was away. Peter shook hands with Sally and said, "Will you write,
  too?" Hannah kissed him tenderly, and he responded to it with so much more
  warmth than usual that her heart bounded and her eyes were wet with happy
  tears. Peter did not try to explain to himself why he had kissed Aunt Hannah
  so lovingly. He did so hate to be pawed over, and felt that female relatives
  should be firmly discouraged from lavish demonstrations of affection. Lydia,
  smilingly observant, was delighted over the little incident. It would mean so
  much to Hannah. She also had a fleeting thought that perhaps Hannah had
  received a vicarious kiss that Peter would have been pleased to bestow on
  Sally.</p>

  <p>The fact was that Peter felt sorry for his Aunt Hannah. He had been
  ashamed at first. It was a very uncomfortable sensation&mdash;being ashamed
  of Aunt Hannah. Now he was just sorry. But if she had to cook for other
  people, he was glad she cooked for Sally. Indeed he couldn't blame her much
  for wanting to live close to Sally where she could see her every day.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Adele had not taken Peter directly to Bar Harbour. They had gone to New
  York for a week, where he had been turned loose to amuse himself daytimes as
  he pleased. With a natural talent for self-reliance, Peter found his way to
  the Battery, the Metropolitan Museum, the Zoo, and even made an unaccompanied
  trip to the Statue of Liberty. In the late afternoon he would show up at the
  hotel and escort his attractive aunt to dinner and the theatre. Urbanity came
  easily and naturally to Peter. Adele was delighted with his promptness in
  adjusting himself to new circumstances. In her opinion this gift was of
  inestimable value to anyone's successful and satisfying relation to society
  <i>savoir-faire</i>&mdash;that's what Peter had. He always knew instinctively
  what to do.</p>

  <p>Thomas Bradford's welcome to Peter at Bar Harbour was so warm and tender
  that Adele was deeply touched by it, and no less by Peter's affectionate
  response. Almost every day Thomas had the boy with him on all sorts of
  excursions. They went fishing, sailing, hiking, Adele consumed with curiosity
  to know what they talked about, but feeling reasonably sure that the most
  important subject had not come up, or Peter would surely have given her some
  evidence of it.</p>

  <p>One morning Thomas approached Adele in the lounge and said he wanted to
  have a chat with her alone. They strolled to the swimming-pool, proceeded for
  some distance away from the bathers, and sat.</p>

  <p>"Adele," he said, "I think the time has come now to talk about it, don't
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Why <i>now?"</i> she queried. "Have you just discovered something?"</p>

  <p>Thomas shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I knew Peter was mine the first day I saw him. There seemed nothing to be
  done about it. I tried to persuade myself that my best course was to let
  things stand as they were."</p>

  <p>"And now you've changed your mind?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I'm determined to claim my boy." Thomas regarded her soberly, with
  something almost like entreaty in his eyes. "Everyone will agree, I suppose,
  that I have no right to him after the way his mother was treated.
  But&mdash;<i>I've got to have that boy!"</i></p>

  <p>"It's possible," remarked Adele quietly, "that his mother feels the same
  way towards Peter."</p>

  <p>"But she doesn't have him, you know. He thinks this Mrs Edmunds is his
  mother."</p>

  <p>"I hope you haven't informed him to the contrary, Thomas."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;and I haven't questioned him much about his home. Whatever he
  has told me has been of his own volition. I can assure you I've done no
  prying."</p>

  <p>"I believe you, of course. Now let me tell you the whole story, Thomas, or
  as much of it as I know. I think you've a right to that, anyway. Whether
  you've a right to claim Peter is another question."</p>

  <p>For the better part of an hour, Adele recited all she knew of Hannah's
  story, and Lydia Edmunds's story, too, Thomas listening attentively. She made
  no effort to spare him as she reviewed Hannah's plight when, sick and
  penniless, she had applied for work at the home of the Ward family. And
  Thomas's eyes were cloudy with remorse when Adele pictured his boy as a baby
  in the University Hospital. "A waif!" she declared.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know," he muttered, self-defensively.</p>

  <p>"Nor care," accused Adele. "Now you turn up, after all these years, bent
  on doing your duty. I think your duty is to keep out of it."</p>

  <p>Thomas shifted his position, faced her directly, and filled his pipe. "May
  I talk awhile now?" he ventured.</p>

  <p>Adele smiled dryly and agreed it was his turn.</p>

  <p>"Let's assume"&mdash;began Thomas, in a tone that promised a carefully
  planned speech&mdash;"we'll assume that everything you have charged me with
  is a true bill. I've been a piker, rotter, cad&mdash;whatever you like. You
  have said it is too late to do anything about that now, so let's consider it
  a closed incident and think about the situation as it exists at the
  moment.</p>

  <p>"Fair enough," consented Adele. "Go on."</p>

  <p>"The fact is that Peter&mdash;however he may have come by it&mdash;is a
  remarkable boy. One in a thousand! He has a bright future. His mother hasn't
  made much of her life and, as you say, is determined now that Peter shall
  have a chance to make something of himself. And to ensure this, she has
  concealed her relationship so as not to embarrass him; a great sacrifice, no
  doubt."</p>

  <p>Adele's lips had twisted into a half-derisive grin. Thomas paused and gave
  her a chance to comment.</p>

  <p>"I was just thinking," she drawled, "when you said that Hannah hadn't
  accomplished very much with her own life, that this was a rather odd
  remark&mdash;coming from <i>you.</i> Have you done anything very showy with
  <i>yours?"</i></p>

  <p>"Thanks," growled Thomas. "All the more reason why I, too might want the
  boy to be and do something, don't you think?"</p>

  <p>"Very well put, I should say."</p>

  <p>"We're together on that, then. But it isn't quite enough for both Hannah
  and me to stand off at a distance and take no hand in this boy's training.
  Hannah mustn't let him know she is his mother, because she is a servant. I
  mustn't let him know I'm his father, because I neglected them. For the sake
  of perpetuating this hoax about his belonging to the Edmunds people, I'm
  expected to say nothing, do nothing, and watch this splendid young fellow
  grow up without advantages."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;I'm not so sure about that, Thomas," countered Adele. "I've a
  little money to spend on him. Mrs Edmunds is not poor. Hannah has been
  accumulating some savings. It isn't as if Peter would have no chance&mdash;if
  you didn't come to the rescue."</p>

  <p>There was a long silence while Thomas digested this. Then he asked:
  "Well&mdash;what are your plans for him?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think it's up to me to make plans for him. After all, Peter
  doesn't belong to me, much as I care for him. I presume he will attend the
  high school in Waterloo, and then go to college some place out there. That
  would be natural, wouldn't you think?"</p>

  <p>"I don't want him to do that," said Thomas.</p>

  <p>Adele pointed an accusing finger close to his nose, and gave him a knowing
  smile.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;what you want, Thomas Bradford, is easy access to this boy. I'll
  bet you've figured it all out: how you're going to take him with you on long
  summer vacations&mdash;to France, maybe, and Italy. You want to be the one to
  show him everything. You want the warm sensation of having him come to you
  for favours and advice."</p>

  <p>"Exactly!" confessed Thomas impulsively. "He's my own flesh and blood." He
  raised stiffly from his lounging posture. "And&mdash;by God&mdash;<i>I mean
  to have him!"</i></p>

  <p>"How are you going about it?" asked Adele quietly. "I hope you aren't
  planning to tell Peter you're his father."</p>

  <p>"I haven't thought that far through it yet."</p>

  <p>Peter had sighted them and was coming their way, smiling.</p>

  <p>"I hope," said Adele, "you'll not say anything to him this summer. Give it
  a little more thought, won't you? There's a good deal at stake, you
  know."</p>

  <p>"How about your writing to Hannah? Sound her out. Tell her I'm prepared to
  give Peter <i>everything."</i></p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;Hannah has enough on her mind, I should say. I had a letter
  from her yesterday. The Ward boy, Wallie, has been sent home from camp, for
  breaking rules or something, and she doesn't know quite what to do with him.
  His parents are abroad. I gather that he's a handful. Try to be patient,
  won't you?"</p>

  <p>"I've spoken for that dory, Mr Bradford," called Peter, from a little
  distance, "and the bait."</p>

  <p>"Very good, Peter," replied Thomas. "We'll start about two. You may ask
  Bobby Winthrop to go along, if you like."</p>

  <p>Peter's face registered a lack of interest in this addition to the
  party.</p>

  <p>"I'd rather we went alone, sir; that is, if you don't care. We'd have more
  fun by ourselves."</p>

  <p>"Quite all right, Peter." Thomas's voice was joyous. He turned to Adele as
  the boy trotted away. His eyes said, "You see?"</p>

  <p>Adele drew a little sigh and laughed.</p>

  <p>"It is rather a pity," she said softly, "that things are as they are.
  There's no question about your belonging to each other."</p>

  <p>Hannah had always disliked the whimpering old adage, <i>It never rains but
  it pours.</i> She couldn't remember ever having said it herself. But there
  was no question about the extraordinary amount of wet weather she had been
  experiencing of late.</p>

  <p>The first downpour to dampen her spirits, after Peter's departure for Bar
  Harbour and Lydia's for Virginia, was a long and gloomy letter from Roberta
  reporting that she and Lucy Trimble had had a falling-out. This was probably
  a serious matter, for Roberta had no talent for making friends, and without
  the support of Lucy she would be quite wretched. And she must have taken the
  quarrel to heart, for she was not one to confide. When things went wrong with
  Roberta, she had always taken it out in sulking. Judging from the temper of
  this letter, Roberta's self-pity had developed a case of desperate
  homesickness.</p>

  <p>With much care Hannah composed a reply in which she counselled the sullen
  child to do her utmost to patch the rift, even if she felt sure that Lucy was
  to blame.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">When there's spilt milk (she wrote), it never pays to argue
  very long whether the person was to blame who dropped the pan, or the person
  who bumped the elbow. The only thing really worth doing, in that case, is to
  mop up the mess. And always it's the strong one that has it to do. Weak
  people stick up for their rights. They know how weak they are inside and are
  afraid others will notice it, so they defend themselves and worry for fear
  somebody will take advantage of them. The strong people don't go to much
  bother about defending themselves or their "rights". When the milk is spilt,
  and they're getting the blame for it, and feel sure it wasn't their own
  fault, they find the mop and say to themselves: "I'm bigger, I'm stronger,
  I'm quicker. I'll do it. I'll not be doing it because I'm to blame, but
  because the others aren't strong enough. It has to be done by somebody. I'll
  do it myself."</p>

  <p class="letter">Now, maybe you'll say that this is a conceited thing for
  anyone to think&mdash;"I'm stronger." And perhaps both you and Lucy have been
  holding back because neither one of you wants to seem stronger than the
  other. But, after all, dear, some people <i>are</i> stronger than others, not
  because they've made themselves so, but because they've been made so. And
  usually when the stronger one goes at it to mop up the mess, the weaker one
  is willing to help. And then everything is all right again. Sometimes it is
  even better than it was before. Smallpox is a dreadful thing, but if you have
  it hard and get over it you'll never have it any more; and then, if some good
  friend of yours should get it, you can safely be the nurse and maybe help
  save a life. I think it's wonderful, don't you, to have had something very
  painful that you know you are never going to have again, and be sure you can
  expose yourself to it without danger?</p>

  <p class="letter">It would be pleasant to have you here again at home,
  Roberta. If you really want to come, we will make things pleasant for you. Of
  course it is pretty hot here now, and we haven't any mountain breezes, and
  the grass is brown, and there isn't much to do because almost everybody is
  out of town. I'm a little afraid that if you come back you wouldn't feel good
  to remember that you and Lucy had parted on bad terms. If you decide to come
  home, please be sure to fix that all up with her first, for the nights are
  sultry and it is not easy to go to sleep here even if one's mind is at
  rest&mdash;and of course yours wouldn't be if you had come home with
  something unpleasant to fret about.</p><br>

  <p>The next morning Wallie arrived unannounced, in gay spirits, too, until he
  tried to account for his unexpected return. The explanation was confused and
  spluttery, and the noise it made increased as it grew more and more
  unconvincing.</p>

  <p>It seemed that some of the boys from a neighbouring camp&mdash;a rival
  institution&mdash;were thought to have damaged one of the canoes belonging to
  Wallie's camp, and some of the boys from Wallie's camp had gone over and
  sprinkled oil and tar on the other boys' beach. And so the master of the camp
  had picked on Wallie and sent him home, and here he was&mdash;stormy,
  persecuted, outraged. Hannah had to repress a smile when she observed the
  uncanny likeness of the boy's tantrum to Paul Ward's dramatic scene when the
  Ellises had stolen his refrigerator.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;we're glad you wanted to come home, anyhow," said Hannah.
  "Home's the best place in the world. Much more fun than being at a lake with
  a lot of rough boys and a cruel camp superintendent. You'll have a better
  time here, playing with Sally."</p>

  <p>Apparently this was the wrong thing for Hannah to have said, for Wallie
  began an earnest defence of camp life. As for Mr Feakins, the head master, he
  had wanted Wallie to go over with the other culprits to the neighbouring camp
  and make it right about the tar&mdash;that was all. He wasn't mean about it,
  and Hannah&mdash;he declared&mdash;was silly to think of Mr Feakins as
  cruel.</p>

  <p>"Anyway," defended Hannah, "I think those big boys are too rough for
  you."</p>

  <p>"They aren't any bigger than I am," growled Wallie.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you'd better telegraph to Mr Feakins, then, and tell him you're
  coming back to play the game with them."</p>

  <p>"Not on your sweet life I won't!" Wallie was tuning for another grand
  pandemonium.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," admonished Hannah, "you'd better lower your voice. The
  neighbours might think someone had been spanking you."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to see 'em! Spanking me! Not so's you could notice it!"</p>

  <p>One afternoon a week later, while Wallie roamed restlessly about the
  grounds and deviled the life out of Sally, Hannah was plunged into the depths
  by a letter from Adele&mdash;a long one&mdash;reporting the conversation she
  had just had with Thomas.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">And really, Hannah (Adele was saying on page eight), it
  seems a pity that Peter should be deprived of his inheritance. Thomas is
  thoroughly honest in his wish to make whatever amends he can. He not only
  wants to see Peter through college and a professional school, but will take
  him abroad on vacations, and give him the experience that is so necessary to
  a man if he is to deal with the people who operate our world.</p>

  <p class="letter">Of course I see your point too, and am entirely
  sympathetic, especially after all the unselfish loneliness you have endured
  to keep your secret safe. It was for Peter's sake that you have gone through
  all this heartbreak. Now I'm wondering if you shouldn't yield&mdash;for
  Peter's sake. I'm not begging you to do it, Hannah, but I think you should
  give it serious consideration. You've hoped that your boy might have a
  chance. Well&mdash;perhaps this is the way to give it to him. Do think it
  over.</p><br>

  <p>Hannah went to her room and sat on the edge of her bed, staring dully at
  the wall. She felt utterly desolated. Adele had gone over to the other side.
  Lydia was out of reach.</p>

  <p>After an hour she pulled herself together and went to the telephone. Mrs
  Trimble presently responded.</p>

  <p>"I am in serious trouble, Mrs Trimble," said Hannah unsteadily. "Could I
  come over to-morrow forenoon and get some advice?"</p>

  <p>"Try to come to-night, Hannah. I am driving over to Springfield in the
  morning to visit some friends, and don't expect to be back until Monday. Mr
  Trimble is out of town. No one will disturb us.... That's good. I shall look
  for you a little after eight."</p>

  <p>But Eleanor Trimble did not drive over to Springfield next morning, for
  she was on the train all day, <i>en route</i> to Bar Harbour.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was a drowsy midsummer Sunday afternoon. Almost everybody
  had driven up to the cove for better observation of the yacht race, leaving
  The Gables practically deserted.</p>

  <p>Fluffy pearl-white clouds, their heads tucked under their wings, slept
  motionless in a blue sky. Slanting sunshine glinted from lazy sails outside
  the harbour. On the horizon a south-bound coastal steamer slothed under a
  plume of smoke. Even the ocean was sprawled in a siesta at the turn of the
  tide, her long-drawn respirations seemingly born of indolence rather than
  fatigue.</p>

  <p>Adele's new book lay open, face down, on the flat granite rock where she
  had tossed it a half-hour ago. It was a meagrely plotted controversial novel
  wordily dealing with world politics&mdash;past, present, and
  pending&mdash;and she had been deeply interested last night by its
  discussions, especially by the profound deliverances of one Senator Chester
  Allaman, who had piled credible facts upon confirmed facts until he had run
  out of facts, after which he had dogmatized and moralized over the boundless
  muddle with all the assurance of the apostles of old who spoke as they were
  moved by the Holy Ghost.</p>

  <p>Last night, reading in her room, Adele had been stirred, alarmed,
  appalled, horrified. The world was quite evidently coming to an end;
  over-populated, underfed, the last frontier occupied; eugenically
  deteriorating, its racial colours clashing, its nationalistic greeds
  mounting, its mind upset, its emotions unstable, its nerves frazzled. Adele
  herself would undoubtedly be alive&mdash;in terror and tatters&mdash;when the
  ultimate explosion was touched off.</p>

  <p>But out here under this serene sky, on this huge durable rock facing a
  tranquil sea, with no evidence that the universe was in any manner perturbed
  and every indication that it was not only solvent but of conscience clear
  enough to be somnolent, Adele yawned into the crook of her bare elbow,
  pitched the book away, and remarked to herself that the Honourable Chester
  Allaman was probably a bag of wind.</p>

  <p>She sank back on her leather pillow and gazed hard at the skyline with
  narrowed, contemplative eyes. After all, wasn't it one's best business in
  life to be at peace with one's world? Wasn't it at once our most valuable
  heritage from life and our richest bequest to life&mdash;this sense of
  confidence in the integrity of the Plan? And weren't the old mandarins right
  when, confronting some sudden declivity in the inevitable ups-and-downs of
  their pilgrimage, they calmly faced the new vicissitude with their classic
  phrase, "This, too, shall pass"?</p>

  <p>Tipping back her head, Adele drew the translucent masses of clouds closer.
  She invoked their serenity, wishing she might hold it and abide in
  it&mdash;for ever. Peace! Not as any single era gives it, in grudged handfuls
  during an armistice, but the permanent peace of the spirit, the peace that is
  not established by treaty, the peace that nobody ever could define or
  describe to anybody else because it surpassed all understanding.</p>

  <p>How fortunate were the peace-lovers of all generations who had believed in
  it as confidently and effortlessly as they believed in breathing; and the
  peacemakers who contrived to live outside the dizzying whirlpool of frets and
  despairs, ifs and might-have-beens, remorses and revenges&mdash;how blest
  were they!</p>

  <p>A few people seemed to have a talent for it. Perhaps it was a gift rather
  than an achievement. Obviously the wrong way to get it was to struggle for
  it.</p>

  <p>Her thoughts turned to Hannah Parmalee. How often she had chuckled over
  Hannah's philosophy of non-combativeness. But wasn't Hannah right, in the
  long run?... Or was she?</p>

  <p>Suppose everybody tried to live that way. Suppose everybody from the
  beginning had tried to live that way. What kind of world would we have had by
  now? Hadn't civilization developed through striving, overcoming, mastering?
  It was all very pleasant and restful to lie here on this sunny seashore under
  these luminous white clouds and sleepily cast one's vote for the
  non-resistant life. Perhaps the sea-gulls lived it after the manner of the
  fowls of the air who, without sowing, reaping, gathering into barns, or
  fretting over their economics, managed to get along somehow. But even they
  had their little tiffs. And who wanted to live the life of a sea-gull,
  anyway? No&mdash;there had to be striving in the world. Certain audacious and
  courageous people simply had to quarrel with life as they found it.</p>

  <p>But what were these worried Mr Fixits getting for their pains? The
  Honourable Chester Allaman, for example, who talked all the way through a
  novel written to scare people out of their senses&mdash;what reward was
  his?... Or theirs who consented to be frightened? Take the whole basketful of
  admonitory prophets&mdash;antique and contemporary: mightn't it be found that
  there was just a trace of the sadistic in their dire forebodings? The noisy
  evangelist, ranting about a future life in hell and despising the economist
  for his grubby materialism, and the dismayed economist, presaging disaster to
  the present life on earth and despising the evangelist for his frantic
  imbecilities&mdash;weren't they both getting a neat little wallop out of
  their experience in terrorizing enfeebled minds? And was there so very much
  difference in the psychological repercussions of a burly parent whipping his
  half-grown daughter, and the emotional titillation of the pessimistic prophet
  flogging a bewildered public? Of course the heavy father was doing it for his
  child's good and the prophets were ordained to arouse and alarm the people.
  They usually insisted that it hurt them worse than they who were meeting the
  hot end of the paddle, but they had probably lied without meaning to. Wasn't
  Senator Allaman enjoying the same sweetly painful little spasms of unholy
  pity for the public's terror that had unquestionably compensated Jonah and
  Calvin and Cromwell and Edwards for their dour austerities? Senator Allaman,
  reflected Adele, might spend a profitable hour munching on this nasty
  probability.</p>

  <p>She sighed luxuriously, gazed with wide unfocused eyes into the deep blue
  above, and marvelled that so great a quantity of admonition on the part of
  the world's savants and seers had contained so little counsel on the
  desirability of a peaceful life&mdash;if not for the turbulent masses, at
  least for the individual. Hannah Parmalee knew more about the terms and
  conditions of peace than all the reformers and crusaders put together. They
  talked about it; she <i>had</i> it. They formulated resolutions about it; she
  quietly accepted it.</p>

  <p>Surely it was a pretty sad commentary on our ethical and spiritual
  leadership if one had to run away from the clatter of their mechanisms and
  the jingle of their cash collections and the clamour of their fears, to seek
  peace in communion with the sky and the sea.</p>

  <p>The trouble was that you couldn't lie here for ever on the warm rocks,
  consulting the clouds, for the comfort and peace of your soul; and perhaps
  this soothing experience was a bit deceptive because it floated in a sedative
  solution of languor and laziness. If the world was to advance, some people
  had to be up and doing. Some people had to think new thoughts and see to it
  that the new thoughts were made effective. And the old thoughts had to be dug
  up and out to make room. Moral and spiritual leaders were, in this respect,
  engaged in surgery. But were they skilled surgeons? Good surgery left a scar,
  of course, but not a festering wound. Too many of the moral and political and
  economic surgeons, though swift and fearless and competent operators, left
  their patients with a high fever. Maybe they worked too fast. Maybe their
  hands were not clean. They said to the public: "Here, you! Let me cut out
  what ails you, and you'll be all right!" So&mdash;they cut out what ailed
  'em, but they weren't all right. There was no more happiness or health or
  peace for anybody than there had been before. What the people needed most was
  a long rest from the racket and confusion of the forces that had volunteered
  to save their minds and souls and occupations and homes. Peace&mdash;that was
  what the people needed. And to get it they had to go out alone and commune
  with the silent sky after the manner of the ancient pagans.</p>

  <p>Maybe... Perhaps... But Adele now decided she had given enough time to
  this matter and quietly went to sleep, with the calm expectation that
  everything would hold together somehow until she woke up. In spite of the
  dismal forecasts, the show would carry on; new plots, new props, new faces,
  new masks, new lines&mdash;but essentially the same old show. And by no means
  an uninteresting old show, either, if you didn't let the harsh voices of the
  prompters annoy you too much.</p>

  <p>When she roused, Adele discovered that she was not alone. Some twenty feet
  away sat the attractive woman who had appeared in the dining-room at
  luncheon&mdash;obviously a newcomer, for no one seemed to be acquainted with
  her.</p>

  <p>The stranger turned her head as Adele sat up rubbing her eyes, and smiled
  amiably. She was not pretty, but her face was engagingly alive. She was
  simply, modishly dressed in white silk with a loosely knotted blue scarf. A
  white parasol with little blue polka dots lay on the rock beside her.</p>

  <p>"Quiet day," drawled Adele, feeling that this unattached person expected a
  gesture of recognition.</p>

  <p>"Too quiet," agreed Eleanor. "I'm lonesome. May I join you?"</p>

  <p>Adele replied, not untruthfully, that it would be a pleasure. For a little
  while they sat side by side exchanging inconsequentials and blandly taking
  each other's measure. They spoke their names, and Adele casually asked
  questions ostensibly for courtesy's sake, though her curiosity had been
  slightly stirred. Had Mrs Trimble ever been here before? She had not. Did she
  know anyone at The Gables? Not a soul. There was a pause, while Adele tried
  to think of a pleasant way to inquire why in the world Mrs Trimble had come
  here, for surely there were plenty of summer places where she might find old
  friends.</p>

  <p>"I came to <i>see you,"</i> said Eleanor quietly, smiling into Adele's
  widening eyes. "About Hannah, you know."</p>

  <p>"Hannah?" Adele's brows contracted.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;Hannah and Thomas and Peter."</p>

  <p>"And how are you related to Hannah?"</p>

  <p>"About the same way you are, I suppose. Friendly interest. Want me to tell
  you about it?"</p>

  <p>"Please. Oddly enough I was just thinking about Hannah. It was so restful
  here, and quiet. Same kind of quietness that Hannah seems to carry about with
  her. I never knew so calm a person."</p>

  <p>Eleanor smiled a little. "She wasn't so calm when I saw her last. Quite
  stirred up, in fact. That's why I came. Hannah's afraid she is going to lose
  her boy. He's all she has, you know."</p>

  <p>"But Hannah has already lost her boy, hasn't she? I mean, so far as their
  mother-and-son relationship is concerned. If she isn't intending to be his
  mother, why&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I see your point, Mrs Moore," interposed Eleanor. "But if
  Thomas Bradford insists on telling Peter he is his father, then Hannah
  necessarily comes into the picture&mdash;and she wants to avoid that.
  Undoubtedly you know how Hannah feels about her own position, and the reason
  she has for&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And it's a rather silly reason, I think," said Adele dryly. "I've tried
  to put myself in her place and be sympathetic. She was brought up to believe
  in the high fences that separate castes. She doesn't want to detain or
  embarrass Peter. And if Thomas hadn't shown such an earnest interest in the
  boy, perhaps her sacrifice might have been justified." She paused
  thoughtfully. "I suppose Hannah feels that I am her enemy."</p>

  <p>"No," replied Eleanor, "you're not her enemy, but I think she would like
  to have her case presented with a little more&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Enthusiasm," assisted Adele. "So she asked you to help."</p>

  <p>Eleanor shook her head. "I volunteered to come, Mrs Moore. I hope I'm not
  impertinent in taking a hand in this unusual game. It's a serious matter, I
  think&mdash;or I shouldn't have bothered. Of course, knowing Hannah's queer
  ideas as you do, you will understand how much she needs support. She wouldn't
  try to defend herself. Thomas could make off with Peter, and Hannah wouldn't
  fight or press her claims. All the more reason, then, why somebody should
  speak in her behalf. It began to appear that it was my job." She smiled
  companionably. "I beg you to believe that I'm not naturally a meddlesome
  person. I should have preferred to keep out of it."</p>

  <p>Adele said she felt sure of that and appreciated her loyalty to Hannah,
  adding, "I'll see that you have a chance to talk it over with Thomas, Mrs
  Trimble."</p>

  <p>"Do you think he'll resent my intrusion?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;if he does he'll not tell you so. You may count on his being
  polite. Thomas will listen respectfully to everything you have to say. But it
  won't do a speck of good. This is the only thing he has ever really wanted. I
  suppose Hannah has told you about his life and how listlessly he went
  trudging about taking orders without having any personal interests of his
  own. He's quite a different fellow since young Peter gave him a new reason
  for living."</p>

  <p>Eleanor smiled and said she would like to talk with him anyway. She felt
  she owed that much to Hannah.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>They met in the lounge next morning. Adele introduced them, presenting
  Peter also, who seemed disappointed when Thomas said he wouldn't be able to
  go sailing as he had promised. Clearly it was this new Mrs Trimble who had
  upset their plans for the day. Peter dutifully attempted to respond to her
  smile, but it was a feeble effort. Presently he mumbled an "Excuse me,
  please", and left them.</p>

  <p>Adele's explanation was brief. Mrs Trimble was a close friend of Professor
  and Mrs Ward, in whose home Hannah had lived for so many years. In the
  absence of the Wards, Hannah had confided her anxieties about Peter to Mrs
  Trimble, and here she was to ask some questions in Hannah's behalf.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it's almost inexcusable&mdash;my interference, as a total
  stranger to you," said Eleanor, smiling up into Thomas's eyes with all the
  guilelessness of a little child. "If you'd prefer not to talk about it, Mr
  Bradford, I'll not insist."</p>

  <p>Adele, directly facing Thomas, over the top of Eleanor's well-groomed
  bobbed head, drew a slightly ironical smile intended for his eye, but he was
  too much occupied to notice it.</p>

  <p>"By no means," declared Thomas. "We shall be grateful for any light you
  can throw on this matter, Mrs Trimble. I am glad you came. Shall we take a
  walk? You'll join us, Adele?"</p>

  <p>After a slight hesitation, Adele said she believed they would do as well
  without her, and Thomas did not press the invitation. The petite Trimble,
  reflected Adele, really should be given a sporting chance. Thomas would have
  his way, no doubt, but the Trimble lady would not make it a bit easy for him.
  Thomas was just a big boy. All men were just big boys; so important, so
  sufficient, until a pair of curly-lashed entreating eyes looked up rather
  dazed over the opportunity to solicit a pleasant word from Olympus. Men were
  all alike. A woman didn't have to carry a very big bag of tricks to achieve
  her purpose. And as for Mrs Trimble, she was admirably equipped to disarm
  Thomas. It was easy to see that he liked the molasses which she was so
  abundantly prepared to administer. Adele grinned and turned away.</p>

  <p>They walked far up the beach and sat, conversation on the way having been
  restricted to Thomas's queries and Eleanor's replies about life in the
  university town, their diversions, their occasional pleasure tours.</p>

  <p>Seated comfortably, they talked of the Wards and of Hannah, of Lydia
  Edmunds&mdash;and Peter.</p>

  <p>"It would be an entirely different matter," Thomas was saying, "if this
  Mrs Edmunds had adopted Peter. As the case stands, she is under no legal
  obligation to him. I appreciate all she has done for the boy. But suppose she
  married; suppose she died. Peter has no claim on her estate&mdash;her
  relatives would see to that. Hannah is not in a position to do anything for
  him."</p>

  <p>"But there is Mrs Moore, of course," observed Eleanor. "She would gladly
  come to Peter's rescue."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, I know," countered Thomas. "But Adele Moore's circumstances are
  as unstable as the other lady's. Adele might pop off and be married. I'm
  surprised she hasn't by this time. She is full of whims and hobbies and
  impetuosities. Besides, Adele is under no obligation to do anything for
  Peter. Nor is she a rich woman. And moreover&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Eleanor leaned towards him and smiled impishly.</p>

  <p>"Moreover," she repeated, <i>"you want him.</i> Isn't that what it all
  comes to?"</p>

  <p>Thomas made a faint gesture of defending his argument, but she laughed. It
  was a silvery, girlish, comradely laugh, and Thomas finding it decidedly
  engaging, capitulated with an unwilling grin.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then&mdash;" He pretended to be gruff. "Let's assume that my
  best argument is located at that point. I want my boy. I want to provide for
  him and make him my heir."</p>

  <p>"I know," said Eleanor gently. "Now let's talk about Hannah."</p>

  <p>"Of course. Why not?" Thomas tried to be casual.</p>

  <p>"Hannah will not contest your claim to Peter. It will upset everything she
  has had in mind for him and mock all the sacrifice she has made, through the
  years; but she will accept it. That's part of her religion or her philosophy
  or whatever it is." Eleanor paused for a moment and then continued slowly, as
  in a soliloquy: "That will make it a bit awkward; having one's own way at
  such a cost to someone else who refuses to contend."</p>

  <p>"I suppose she'll hate me for it."</p>

  <p>Eleanor shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;that's just the trouble. If you could feel that even in her
  heart Hannah was silently despising you as an enemy, it might be easier to
  press your claim. She will not do that. And she will keep on hoping, to the
  very last minute, that you will be generous enough to let things be as they
  are. Do you know what Hannah said to me the other night when she was telling
  me about all this? She said that she believed the love you had found for
  Peter would make you very tender. Somewhere she had been reading about the
  unusually hard rains that fell last spring in the desert, and how certain
  flowers bloomed that nobody could remember ever having seen before. The
  life-germ of them had been buried so deep in the dry ground, and so much
  windswept sand had been piled over them, that what little water there was
  couldn't reach down to give them nourishment. And then came this great flood
  of rain that renewed their strength. But they hadn't been dead; just dormant.
  Hannah thinks of you that way. And she believes and hopes that Peter's coming
  into your life will make something bloom in you&mdash;something that was
  always there, but hadn't been given a chance... I hope this doesn't sound too
  terribly sentimental. I'm afraid I'm not doing Hannah's little allegory full
  justice. To appreciate it, you would have to hear her say it. But I think
  it's quite an inspiring idea. Don't you?"</p>

  <p>Thomas recalled himself from his reverie, and sighed.</p>

  <p>"Well"&mdash;his voice was husky&mdash;"suppose something fine did bloom
  in me, what then? What should I do? Has Hannah a suggestion? Or have
  you?"</p>

  <p>Eleanor's eyes brightened. The opportunity she had been angling for seemed
  to have arrived.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you do everything for Peter that you would have done in the
  event of claiming him as your own? Let him continue to be Peter Edmunds.
  Arrange with Mrs Edmunds for his allowance. Counsel with her about his
  schooling. And learn Hannah's wishes, too. I think they will both want to
  conform to your ideas about that. It seems to me it would be such a fine,
  sporting thing to do. It really stirs me quite deeply to imagine how it would
  be. A genuine sacrifice for you, no doubt, but something that will make you
  proud of yourself, every day of your life."</p>

  <p>Thomas toyed with his blond moustache and grinned, a little
  self-consciously, at this imputation of nobility, but it was plain to see
  that her tribute to his magnanimity was a pleasant and novel experience.
  People hadn't ever thought of him as belonging to that category.</p>

  <p>"And it would make Peter so proud of you, too," continued Eleanor in an
  exalted tone. "The boy has been brought up to think so highly of good
  sportsmanship."</p>

  <p>"But he would never know!" Thomas's hands tossed this appeal aside with an
  impatient gesture. "How could he be proud of me for doing something for him
  in secret? As for his sportsmanship, I've noticed that, of course. I suppose
  we have this Mrs Edmunds to thank for his ideas on that subject. It isn't
  likely that Hannah, with her peculiar views on the advisability of sitting
  still and letting people run over you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Now that's where you misunderstand Hannah, Mr Bradford," declared Eleanor
  impressively. "Hannah is a living example of the very highest sportsmanship
  there is! Private courage! I can't see that there would be anything so very
  brave and fine about your claiming your son, whom you love and admire. But if
  you were to give him everything you would have given him as his acknowledged
  father, and do it without his ever knowing, <i>that is the kind of
  sportsmanship</i> Hannah likes best. If she has managed to fill Peter's head
  with such ideas, you should be glad of it."</p>

  <p>Thomas ungrudgingly nodded his consent to this. "Of course, of course.
  Lofty thought. 'He best deserves a knightly crest,' and so forth. Everybody
  agrees to that, I think. At least everybody agrees it's good poetry and makes
  a pretty legend. But, getting back to earth again where, after all, my own
  residence is maintained&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't be sarcastic, please," interposed Eleanor with a reproving smile.
  "I dislike satire, especially that kind. It's so damned insincere&mdash;and
  unfriendly."</p>

  <p>"Sorry. Excuse it, please. What I was trying to say is: You think such a
  programme, carried out by me, would make Peter proud of me. Now just what do
  you mean? The essence of this plan is its secretiveness. I'm to do something
  Peter will never know about, and my doing it will make him proud of me.
  Doesn't that sound a little bit silly to you?" Thomas chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," concluded Eleanor, "but it doesn't make quite so much
  difference how this idea sounds to <i>me.</i> I'm not presenting my own case
  or my own views. It's Hannah's affair. I have been telling you, as well as I
  know how, what Hannah believes."</p>

  <p>"Very good, then," said Thomas encouragingly. "How do you think Hannah
  would explain this dilemma?" His teasing warned her that she had moved into a
  difficult position.</p>

  <p>"Hannah would say," replied Eleanor gropingly, "that while Peter would
  never know exactly what you had done to make you great in his eyes, he would
  be aware that something had happened to make you a very important
  person."</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;it would do something to me, on the inside; something that
  would flavour all my thoughts and actions?" Thomas had dropped his bantering
  mood, and his tone was respectful.</p>

  <p>"Exactly! You've said it! Hannah thinks it is the secret renunciation, the
  giving-up, the letting-go, the sacrifice that nobody understands but the
  person who does it&mdash;Hannah thinks this generates inside you a peculiar
  power to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To do what?" queried Thomas sceptically, when she hesitated.</p>

  <p>"To do almost anything you like," replied Eleanor.</p>

  <p>"But you yourself," challenged Thomas, "don't believe a word of it, and
  privately you think it's a great lot of nonsense. What interests me is: How
  did you and Hannah ever get to talking in this vein? She is a domestic in the
  home of your friends. You're not in the habit of discussing philosophy and
  mysticism with the servants in your neighbourhood. I'm pretty sure of
  that."</p>

  <p>"True enough. But Hannah came to tell me her anxiety about Peter."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know; but it seems odd that a discussion of this matter about
  Peter should involve so much talk concerning renunciation and its power to
  make you over into something grand and noble. Do you mean to say that Hannah
  expected you to tell me all this in the hope of making an important person of
  <i>me?</i> It sounds very implausible."</p>

  <p>Eleanor did not at once respond to the question but sat with moody eyes
  intent on the lace handkerchief she was folding and refolding into prim
  squares. After a long silence she looked up into his eyes, regarded him with
  a slow, reluctant smile, and said, "No&mdash;you're right&mdash;Hannah wasn't
  trying to make an important person of you, but <i>me.</i> When she said these
  things about renunciation and giving up and letting go&mdash;and the glory of
  private courage&mdash;she was advising <i>me."</i></p>

  <p>"And you sat and took it&mdash;from a servant!" Thomas's voice was
  incredulous.</p>

  <p>"I sat and took it from a servant," echoed Eleanor in the same tone, "and
  something tells me it's the truth. I don't know yet." Her voice lowered until
  her words were barely audible. "I've promised myself to try it. But the
  occasion for experimenting with it hasn't arisen." She glanced up and smiled
  briefly. "It's one thing to make a good resolution, and quite another thing
  to enforce it."</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose your problem is anything on the order of mine," hinted
  Thomas. "It couldn't be, of course."</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't want to tell me?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Apparently you've been doing a lot of tall thinking about this," drawled
  Thomas.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;it really is an intriguing idea. Naturally, everybody is
  stirred by stories of secret heroisms performed without any promise of
  reward, but I don't believe very many people consider what sort of effect
  such acts would have on the adventurers themselves, I think Hannah knows that
  it works. I'm not sure that I'll ever know. I'm going to try."</p>

  <p>"Good luck, then," said Thomas companionably. "I don't suppose I'll ever
  know whether you succeeded."</p>

  <p>"Probably not."</p>

  <p>"I should have said that you had been succeeding at it already ... You
  really have something, you know... you're different." He laughed a little as
  her eyes widened with surprise. "You are so thoroughly urbane, sophisticated,
  experienced. I hope you don't mind my saying it has sounded deucedly
  queer&mdash;your serious talk about these things. They aren't discussed in
  your world&mdash;or mine. You know that. If anybody of our sort was to have
  overheard what we've been chattering about for the past half hour they'd
  think we were mentally unhooked. People like us don't take any stock in such
  theories."</p>

  <p>"I know," admitted Eleanor, "and I wonder why they don't. People who live
  in your social world and mine, a world of privilege and opportunity and easy
  access to all forms of culture&mdash;why shouldn't we be the very ones to see
  the reality and value of these spiritual forces? Just look at us! We have a
  chance to develop our emotions on a very high plane. Grand opera, symphony
  orchestras, world-wide travel. Everything that can exalt the spirit is
  ours&mdash;dawns in the mountains, sunsets on the sea, great paintings, great
  sculpture, great drama. Aren't we the people, after all, who should be the
  quickest to understand the possibilities of our hearts and recognize the
  power of these mysterious appeals to our emotions? If there is to be any
  nobility in human life, surely people of your advantages and mine are better
  equipped to know what it is all about than the underprivileged who have so
  few chances to be stirred and thrilled."</p>

  <p>"You mean we have to pay for our sunsets in the South Seas by doing
  something sacrificial," said Thomas, amused over her long speech.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Eleanor ignored the flippancy of his comment. "Why not?" she
  repeated, seriously. "Don't you think it is really bad for us to experience
  these gripping emotional appeals and never do anything to justify our right
  to receive them? Here we go, you and I, stirred by other people's fortitude,
  moved by other people's renunciations, learning about life at second-hand,
  and never once trying it out to see what it might make of us!"</p>

  <p>Thomas stretched both of his long arms to full length and drew a deep
  breath.</p>

  <p>"Are you trying to sell this idea to me&mdash;or to yourself?" he queried,
  amiably teasing.</p>

  <p>"To both of us; especially me." Eleanor rose.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I suppose one either believes it, or one doesn't," drawled
  Thomas, falling into step beside her. "Either you accept it or you don't. If
  you do, you aren't required to sell it to yourself any more."</p>

  <p>"Not the theory&mdash;no. As for the practice, that's another matter. I
  was amused at something Hannah said about that. She has her droll moments,
  you know." Eleanor laughed reminiscently. "Hannah says people sometimes come
  plop up against a challenge to their skill in bravery and they can't do
  anything much about it because they had never experimented. She says, 'It
  looks quite easy when a juggler keeps three tennis balls, a frying-pan, and a
  hatchet in the air at the same time, but I expect he began practising the act
  with only a couple of tennis balls.'"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>When he had come down to earth again after his big surprise, Peter wanted
  to tell somebody who didn't know about it yet, so he went to his room early
  that night and wrote Sally. Perhaps Aunt Hannah had told Sally, but he didn't
  think so. Aunt Hannah wouldn't really like the new plan very well, and maybe
  wouldn't want to talk about it to anyone. She hadn't objected to it, but why
  should she if his mother was agreed?</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Dear Sally (he wrote): I said I would write to you. It is
  funny to talk about being busy in a place like this but you eat breakfast and
  then it is time for dinner or somebody wants you to sail. I told you about Mr
  Bradford. Well, it is funny but I spend most of the time with him. There is a
  lagoon near here where we catch flounders. An old man with whiskers rows us
  in his boat and cuts bait. A flounder is round, not like a ball but a pie in
  case you never saw one or even if you did. And we play tennis and Uncle
  Thomas&mdash;he wants me to call him that and I do too&mdash;plays a fast
  game for two sets and then his wind gives out, from cigarettes he says and he
  does smoke a good many. Sally Ive some news for you. I am going to a military
  school in Virginia for boys on Sept. 13. Uncle Thomas went to school there
  when he was my age. I am coming home next week alone because Aunt Adele is
  going to Paris the next day. Maybe I will see you before school begins. Ask
  Aunt Hannah to bring you. Im afraid she wont like me in a uniform but my
  Mother will though and Aunt Adele and Uncle Thomas says he thinks it will be
  bully. He is coming to see me sometimes for he knows the headmaster. How is
  your tennis now Sally you are pretty good for a girl I think. Ask Aunt Hannah
  if you can come down with her. Uncle Thomas is taking me on a hike to-morrow.
  Last time we saw a red fox. It stood still a long time looking at us before
  it ran and then not very fast and it looked back once to see if we were
  coming and Uncle Thomas laughed. Maybe we will see one this time or a deer
  for there are some. Good-bye for this time. See if Aunt Hannah wont let you
  come with her.</p>

  <p class="letter">Your friend PETER.</p>

  <p class="letter">P.S.&mdash;Pleas excuse the blots. Ive a blister on my
  thumb from bowling. So has Uncle Thomas.</p><br>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE breach between Lucy Trimble and Roberta, dating from
  more than two years ago when they were nearing fifteen, had never healed
  properly. When their misunderstanding had arisen at the Adirondack summer
  camp, Roberta had taken it too seriously and had sulked over it too long.</p>

  <p>With a fair imitation of her mother's accomplishments in repairing damaged
  feelings, Lucy had cooed affectionate little entreaties in all the dulcet
  tones of the maternal gamut. But Roberta, morbidly relishing this flattering
  solicitude far too well to deprive herself of it by a prompt conciliation,
  continued to brood pensively over her wounds until her brightly buoyant
  friend grew bored and impatient.</p>

  <p>It is possible that their comradeship might have become tiresome to Lucy
  even if it had not experienced this acute stress. Inheriting Sam Trimble's
  sunny and equable disposition and Eleanor's talent for making herself
  agreeable in any company, Lucy's gay gregarious spirit was already chafed by
  the exactions of Roberta's jealously possessive devotion. Now that this
  monopolistic adoration had assumed a dourly reproachful air of injury, it was
  an insupportable burden.</p>

  <p>There was no one particular day when Lucy enforced a resolution to let
  Roberta Ward paddle her own social canoe. Perhaps it would have been a more
  humane act if an amputation had been performed. In that event Roberta,
  definitely aware of what had happened to her, might have made an effort to
  cultivate some promising friendships in other quarters. Instead, she
  persevered in her morose longing that the fracture might be nursed back to
  health.</p>

  <p>On the surface, relations were amiable enough as the two girls made the
  journey home together, that September, to enter upon their second year in
  high school. But the salt of their friendship had lost its savour. Whatever
  may have been Lucy's brief misgivings over this situation, to Roberta the
  affair was in the nature of a tragedy. Lacking any gifts for making friends,
  the quiet withdrawal of Lucy's interest left her in a perilous position
  socially. It began to be obvious to the unhappy girl that Lucy's patronage
  had accounted for the place she had occupied, and she was tortured with the
  thought that nobody had ever really wanted her; that she had been accepted
  only because of Lucy's ardent loyalty&mdash;on a "Love me, love my dog"
  basis.</p>

  <p>It turned out to be an embittering year for Roberta. Always, even from
  early childhood, a recluse and introvert, she went her own way, becoming less
  and less communicative at home and more and more distrustful of her rating in
  the opinion of her acquaintances at school. If the girls were casual in their
  greetings, Roberta interpreted their attitude as frosty indifference. If they
  were cordial, she accounted for it as an effort of theirs to show how much
  they pitied her. She was still invited to the more inclusive parties, but
  there were plenty of things going on in the inner circle of a dozen or more.
  These affairs she learned about after they had occurred. She felt utterly
  outcast.</p>

  <p>Once&mdash;it was the day school resumed after the Christmas
  holidays&mdash;Roberta had pocketed her pride and asked Lucy why she hadn't
  been invited to Betsy Partridge's birthday dinner.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know you weren't," Lucy had replied, making a brave attempt to
  look dismayed. "I noticed you weren't there, but I supposed something had
  turned up to&mdash;to keep you away."</p>

  <p>"No, you didn't," protested Roberta, sullenly. "You couldn't have helped
  knowing that I wasn't asked."</p>

  <p>"Well, after all"&mdash;Lucy shrugged slightly&mdash;"it wasn't my party.
  I asked you to mine, didn't I?"</p>

  <p>Roberta grinned feebly and commented, "Yes&mdash;the skating party for the
  whole class; everybody in town." She winked back the angry tears.</p>

  <p>"Betsy's mother arranged that little dinner as a surprise, Roberta,"
  explained Lucy gently. "Almost any sort of slip can happen in an affair like
  that. I wouldn't fret about it if I were you."</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't have to," murmured Roberta. "Everybody likes you."</p>

  <p>The bell rescued Lucy from the necessity of any further dissembling in
  Roberta's behalf. The constraint between them, now that it had been mutually
  discussed, was an established fact. Neither of them knew how to deal with it.
  Lucy was sorry enough, but what could you do with a person like Roberta? "Now
  I <i>ask</i> you!" she said to herself in exasperation.</p>

  <p>As the year wore on, Roberta drew more snugly into her shell, comforting
  herself with her drawing, and taking but scant interest in the few social
  events to which she was invited.</p>

  <p>Marcia worried about it, but lacked the capacity for finding a remedy. She
  suggested a Valentine party for Roberta, here at home, or at the City Club,
  or wherever she wished. Roberta had no interest in the plan, so they gave it
  up. Marcia was at her wits' end. The fact was that she herself had been
  accustomed to beating a retreat when events became too complicated for her.
  Her favourite method of dealing with a predicament was to go to her room,
  bury her face deep in the pillows, and cry until she had a red nose and a
  headache. With a disposition like that she was at a disadvantage in her
  efforts to counsel Roberta to be of good cheer and tackle her problem with a
  courageous smile.</p>

  <p>"I'm terribly anxious about Roberta," she confided to Eleanor. "She feels
  so&mdash;so out of things, this year; has it in her head that the girls don't
  like her; thinks Lucy isn't friendly."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" scoffed Eleanor. "Some childish disagreement, maybe. You
  remember how such things used to go when we were of that age. Whatever it is,
  you can depend on its blowing over presently. Why, Roberta was at our house
  only yesterday."</p>

  <p>"She was there on an errand," said Marcia obdurately. "It has been a good
  while since Lucy was over here. I know Roberta is too sensitive and
  reticent&mdash;but really&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, do you want me to speak to Lucy about it?" Eleanor's tone hinted
  that this procedure might be considered as a risky last resort not to be
  highly recommended.</p>

  <p>"No, no, no!" Marcia shook her head vigorously. "I'm sure Roberta wouldn't
  want <i>that!</i> If she can't have Lucy's friendship of her own free
  will&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Eleanor drew her chair closer and lowered her voice confidentially.</p>

  <p>"These children," she began, "are all too preoccupied with their own
  affairs to have the least bit of sympathy or understanding for each other's
  peculiarities. I suppose we were that way too at fifteen. My Lucy is a
  heedless youngster who just lives from moment to moment in a grand state of
  excitement. Your Roberta is inclined to be aloof and unaggressive.
  Temperamentally they are as opposite as the Poles. Your Sally is like
  Lucy&mdash;impetuous and full of ginger. Those two, if they were of an age,
  would hit it off. We'll just have to make up our minds, that Lucy and Roberta
  represent different types."</p>

  <p>The speech had promised more comfort than it was able to deliver, and when
  it was concluded there was a moment's silence.</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," murmured Marcia at length, drawing a deep sigh. "Sometimes
  I think we should send Roberta away to school; give her a chance to make
  friends in another environment."</p>

  <p>"It's a good thought," agreed Eleanor quickly. "A change like that might
  solve the whole problem for her." But they both knew, and each of them was
  aware that the other knew, how difficult it was going to be for Roberta to
  find contentment, no matter where she lived.</p>

  <p>Most of the children who came to the Wards were Sally's friends. It seemed
  to Roberta that the place was constantly jammed with noisy girls who
  clattered up and down the stairs, invading the pantry, banging the piano,
  slamming the doors&mdash;obnoxious creatures sticky with perspiration and for
  ever smelling like apples and butter. Nor were they any too considerate of
  Roberta's thin-skinned sensitivity when they encountered her, perhaps because
  she made no bones about her distaste for them; and, besides&mdash;though
  Roberta was too taken up with her own sorrows to make any reasonable
  allowance for this&mdash;they were at that abominable phase of dishevelled,
  rattle-headed, muddy-footed adolescence in which no normal child is
  distinguished for reverence.</p>

  <p>Sometimes Sally felt sorry for Roberta and made awkward little excursions
  into her moody sister's confidence, where she had always been unwelcome. Late
  on Saturday afternoon, she was likely to tear loose from the fudge-making
  bedlam in the kitchen and go plunging up to Roberta's sanctuary with an
  exuberant invitation to come down and share in the fun.</p>

  <p>"Now <i>wouldn't</i> that be jolly?" Roberta would reply scornfully. "With
  that bunch of animals!"</p>

  <p>Each member of the family, in his own way, was distressed about Roberta.
  Wallie, who had never drawn any prizes for altruism either inside the house
  or out of it, had long since given up trying to be gracious to her and rarely
  had anything more winsome to say than "Aw, snap out of it, can't you?" But he
  had his moments when he would have been glad enough to think of something he
  might do, without too much effort, towards the reconditioning of his sister's
  broken spirit. Privately it had annoyed him when Roberta and Lucy Trimble
  were no longer intimately associated; for he greatly admired Lucy, and missed
  her visits more than he cared to admit. Paul, now loaded with extra
  responsibilities since his elevation to the deanship, had nothing
  constructive to offer. Always volatile as a weathervane, with an amazing
  capacity for bouncing from the Slough of Despond to the Heights of Pisgah
  without any intermediate stop for refuelling, he could hardly be expected to
  understand his daughter's chronic dejection. Sometimes he pitied her from the
  bottom of his heart and resolved to leave no stone unturned in an effort to
  divert her, but when he approached her with his suggestions she exasperated
  him with her stubborn refusal to consent or even to appreciate his
  generosity. One day he would try to impute some grace to her by commending
  her on being such a thoughtful, quiet, dutiful daughter; the next day he
  would be likely to inquire acidly, at breakfast, whether friends were being
  requested to omit flowers. As for Marcia, she cried about it for hours on
  end, and then drove downtown to a beauty shop for repairs.</p>

  <p>None of them gave as much consecutive thought to the case as Hannah. Her
  worry was somewhat complicated by her misgivings, for it troubled her to
  remember that she had never given Roberta the affection she had bestowed on
  Wallie and Sally. Of course, she told herself, the spiritless child had
  always resented her overtures of friendship, but, even so, she might have
  made her preference for Sally a little less conspicuous. Through that winter
  and spring Hannah fairly racked her brain trying to think of something she
  might say or do to enliven Roberta, went to endless bother to plan the meals
  with Roberta's tastes in mind, catered to every little whim, and made special
  efforts to dignity and defer to her infrequent comments. But you positively
  couldn't do anything for Roberta.</p>

  <p>She was nearing seventeen now, and her isolation was becoming increasingly
  difficult to bear in the face of the inevitable pairing of her high-school
  classmates. Roberta thought them sickeningly silly, and said so with such
  withering contempt that nobody any longer bothered about inviting her to
  anything.</p>

  <p>Her drawing now served to compensate for her social losses. There was no
  question at all about Roberta's artistic talent. Her themes were decidedly
  unpleasant, but she handled them with astonishing skill and fidelity. By way
  of her father's influence she contrived to engage for private instruction at
  the hands of André Gallet, head of the Art Department at the University, who
  promptly reported that Roberta&mdash;if she applied herself might be expected
  to go far.</p>

  <p>It was a pleasant relief to have these good tidings about Roberta. The
  family was unanimous in applauding her. She was as cloistral and touchy as
  ever, but these unhappy distinctions could now be readily understood and
  condoned. As a genius, Roberta was to be pardoned for her eccentricities. The
  household was cheered, and much pains were taken to see that the artist was
  shielded from unnecessary shocks, jolts, abrasions&mdash;and intrusions upon
  the privacy which had become more and more insular.</p>

  <p>Twice a week, on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons from four to six,
  Roberta sat at the feet of M. Gallet, her deep melancholy eyes intent on his
  impulsive gestures, her drooping lips parted a little in admiration. She
  worked for Gallet as she never worked at anything before. And because she was
  the most gifted and indefatigable student he had ever taken on, he gave her
  the best he had to offer, now yelling at her until the big dark eyes swam
  with tears, now repentantly healing the bruise with encouraging little pats
  on her shoulder which made her habitually sluggish heart thump hard against
  her boyish chest.</p>

  <p>One day she slipped quietly out of the house, returning two hours later to
  announce casually to her mother that she had visited a tailor. Marcia was
  both amazed and delighted that Roberta, who had been so appallingly
  indifferent to her appearance for nearly two years, had actually taken the
  initiative in improving herself. In a few days the suit was delivered, a most
  severe brown whipcord, with highly built shoulders and plenty of mannish
  pockets. There was also a brown hat which a boy might have worn without
  explanation, and flat-heeled snub-nosed russet shoes. That afternoon she wore
  the rather startling ensemble to her session with Professor Gallet, who
  tactfully felicitated her on having adopted a costume at once as <i>chic,</i>
  so <i>distingué,</i> so&mdash;<i>tout à vous;</i> and Roberta, colouring a
  little, shyly murmured, <i>"Merci".</i></p>

  <p>She had hoped he would approve. The family, of course, could be counted on
  to deride her. That's what families were for&mdash;to frustrate originality
  and offer special premiums for conventionalized dullness.</p>

  <p>When she arrived home shortly before dinner, Roberta encountered them all,
  one by one. Paul grinned as he appraised her in the new rig and drawled,
  "We'll make a man of you yet." Sally gaily shouted, "Lookit!" Wallie, meeting
  her in the upper hall, laid the back of his hand against his forehead, reeled
  weakly, and said, very deferentially, "How do you do, sir?" Thoroughly
  frenzied, Roberta told him where he could go, after which she turned angrily
  to her room and banged the door in his face. Her savage retort made Wallie
  laugh; and she, interpreting it as further ridicule of her revolutionary
  garb, refused to come down to dinner.</p>

  <p>Hannah went up with a tray, but was not admitted.</p>

  <p>Roberta was something of a problem.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>There was nothing unusual about the crush. Neglected at school and
  misunderstood at home, Roberta devoted all her pent-up affection to Professor
  Gallet. He was too warm-hearted to snub her, too canny to make capital of her
  infatuation. Whatever moral scruples he may have had or lacked, he was not
  disposed to jeopardize his job by giving any encouragement to this sort of
  thing.</p>

  <p>Roberta's starry-eyed adoration became rather embarrassing to the arty
  Gaul, who, twice her age and comfortably domesticated with a roly-poly wife
  and four attractive children, had no notion of taking advantage of Professor
  Ward's prematurely neurotic daughter.</p>

  <p>She brought him flowers, an incomprehensible modernistic etching, and a
  couple of tall thin vellum-bound volumes of lowercase poetry composed under
  high emotional pressure by a frustrated soul who disapproved of the universe,
  denying the existence of God on one page and blaming Him on the next for
  having done a bad job.</p>

  <p>He thanked her pleasantly for the poems, and promised he would read them;
  and, when cornered a few days later for an appraisal, remarked shrilly that
  they were "tripe". Professor Gallet was proud of his American slang. Roberta
  wept, and accused him of not liking her any more, which was true.</p>

  <p>"It is the artistic temperament," consoled Professor Gallet. "We both have
  it! We suffer. Shall we now proceed to our work?" he added more
  practically.</p>

  <p>They proceeded to their work. The lessons were continued. But Roberta had
  lost a little more of her moral underpinning, and became quite a pitiable
  object as her self-confidence was drained of its few remaining red
  corpuscles.</p>

  <p>In this state of mental torture, she began to feel acutely unfriendly
  towards people who seemed happily adjusted to their environment. The chief
  object of her envy was Sally. Sally had everything. She was remarkably
  pretty. At fifteen she was flowering early into a vital maidenhood. Everybody
  loved her. She knew what to say, what to do, how to dress. She was athletic,
  clever, well balanced.</p>

  <p>Ever since Peter Edmunds had gone away to school, a correspondence had
  been maintained. At first it had dealt mostly with school affairs. Sally had
  written about the high-school sports and games. Peter had sent her his
  picture in uniform. Sally had hidden it. She had never resented the family's
  friendly chaffing about the local boys who showed her their shy and clumsy
  attentions, but she didn't want to take the risk of being teased about Peter.
  Bland and open about all her friendships and social engagements, her feeling
  for Peter Edmunds was a different matter. Nobody knew of it but Hannah, and
  it was not now a frequent topic of discussion, even between them. And when,
  rarely, Peter's name was mentioned, Sally realized that Hannah&mdash;so
  comradely on all other occasions&mdash;was increasingly distrait and eager to
  have done with the subject, almost as if she thought Sally had no right to
  talk about him.</p>

  <p>At first this had given Sally some anxious moments. It was so evident that
  Hannah quietly but firmly resented the friendship and wanted it discontinued.
  She searched the record of her own conduct to see if she could recall
  something she had said or done to bring this about. Had Peter reported to his
  mother that Sally had inadvertently let it slip&mdash;about Hannah's being
  their servant? Would this account for Hannah's attitude? Or was it something
  else?</p>

  <p>If Hannah heard from Peter, it was through the letters she received from
  his mother. These letters from Waterloo came frequently, and Hannah seemed
  always on the look-out for mail. But so did Roberta, if it came to that.
  Sometimes there seemed to be a race on, between Hannah and Roberta, who
  should meet the postman.</p>

  <p>One day Sally wrote to Peter that she hoped to come East next autumn, to a
  preparatory school in Northampton. He would like that, she believed. It took
  more than a little courage to tell him, and she awaited the reply with a
  nervous impatience that slightly slowed her rackety gallop up the stairs. And
  as the days passed, she refused a second helping at the table. Weeks went
  by&mdash;and there was no letter from Peter.</p>

  <p>At Christmas-time, Mrs Edmunds went to Virginia to visit her relatives and
  Peter. This much Sally extracted from Hannah. The lovely Christmas card she
  had sent to Peter (it had been selected with much care and had cost a dollar)
  brought no response. After two weeks had gone by, Sally ventured to tell
  Hannah of her perplexity. She tried to make it sound casual, and chuckled a
  little, as if it didn't matter much, but her unsteady voice gave her away.
  Hannah seemed rather touched over it as she replied: "I'm sure I don't know,
  dear. Boys of that age are very careless. I expect he's pretty busy."</p>

  <p>In March, Sally's mother noticed her listlessness and Doctor Bowen ordered
  her to take halibut liver oil, a tablespoonful of which was dutifully poured
  into the wash-basin every night before retiring. Sally made a resolute effort
  to be gay, but it was hard to do. Sometimes her pride had its innings for a
  few days, especially when they were rehearsing for the class play and the
  extra work distracted her mind. When that was over, she drifted again into
  the unaccountable periods of abstraction and inattention which everybody in
  the house knew "weren't a bit like Sally".</p>

  <p>The postman for the Marcellus Avenue district began his morning route at
  the corner only three houses away. He usually rang the bell while the Wards
  were eating breakfast. Some time ago, Roberta had developed the habit of
  meeting him at the door. Hannah would start from the kitchen, but Roberta
  usually intercepted her.</p>

  <p>Once Wallie had remarked, as Roberta laid her napkin aside and hurriedly
  pushed back her chair, "I don't see why you've got to break your neck every
  morning to grab the mail. You never get any, do you?"</p>

  <p>Paul remarked that this was an unnecessarily discourteous speech, and
  added that we could jolly well get along without such comments. Marcia sighed
  deeply. Sally's finely modelled brows contracted a little. A very unpleasant
  thought occurred to her, but she instantly dismissed it. Roberta was a
  difficult person to live with, but she wouldn't do a thing like that...
  and&mdash;of course&mdash;Hannah wouldn't!... No&mdash;Peter had found
  someone he liked better. He had been willing to write her an occasional
  letter so long as she was a thousand miles away, but when she had threatened
  to come East to school he had thought it high time to drop their friendship
  before it became embarrassing&mdash;and made some demands upon him.</p>

  <p>Hannah felt that <i>she</i> needed some halibut liver oil too. She had
  never been confronted with the apparent necessity for showing disloyalty to
  someone she loved, in the hope of serving what she believed to be a worthy
  cause. It was going to be better for Peter&mdash;and Sally, too&mdash;if
  their friendship was not allowed to develop into affection. She had devoutly
  hoped it might be broken off before it became serious. If something
  intervened between them now, they would get over it.</p>

  <p>But she felt very uncomfortable. Peter would write inquiring how Sally
  was. Sally would ask shy questions about Peter. Once, when Sally was
  particularly inquisitive, Hannah was all but on the point of tossing the
  whole case away, for she was carrying in her apron pocket a letter containing
  some pathetically wistful queries. How Sally's blue eyes would have sparkled,
  thought Hannah, if she had known the depth of Peter's continuing interest in
  her. But Hannah had gone through too much heart-breaking sacrifice on Peter's
  behalf to risk jeopardizing it all now for the sake of humouring Sally in her
  girlish fondness for this boy. Doubtless she would recover. She would forget
  it. In any event, Hannah had firmly decided to do nothing to aid them in
  promoting their friendship. There was too much at stake.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The past twenty months, in spite of anxieties about Roberta&mdash;and
  Wallie, too, for he was not doing a bit well in the university and spent most
  of his time tinkering with a decrepit motor chassis&mdash;had brought at
  least two great satisfactions to Hannah. She had half dreaded to see Paul
  come home from Europe. As for Eleanor Trimble's probable attitude towards the
  problem of their relationship, Hannah believed she would make every effort to
  re-establish their friendship on a sound and safe footing. But there was
  still Paul's feeling to be reckoned with.</p>

  <p>In her imagination Hannah had followed Paul and Marcia on their tour.
  Marcia would not be a very comfortable travelling companion. She had indulged
  herself at home in indolent habits, rarely breakfasting before ten, and had
  developed her natural talent for wasting time until the log of her journey
  through a typical day, had it been honestly set down in ink, would have made
  the laziest dog laugh. Marcia would be a ball-and-chain to Paul on a
  sight-seeing tour.</p>

  <p>Of course it wasn't quite fair to think of Mrs Ward as an unintelligent
  person, for she had had college training, and her associations were mostly
  with people whose interests required them to keep abreast of serious thought,
  but it surely must have irritated Paul sometimes to note the inattention in
  her bird's-egg blue eyes when conversations of importance were actively
  astir. Hannah could easily picture her toddling along beside Paul through the
  spacious and venerable halls of Oxford, and occasionally saying "Really!" but
  wishing it were time to take the train back to London.</p>

  <p>So far as the Paul-Eleanor problem was concerned, it would be much more
  simple, reflected Hannah, if he had gone abroad by himself. Returning, he
  would be so pleased to see his wife that nobody else, not even Eleanor
  Trimble, would have counted for very much. He would have idealized the pretty
  creature during his absence. His home-coming would be quite another matter
  with a weary and fretful Marcia in tow.</p>

  <p>But whether Eleanor Trimble's firm grip on her own emotions was so
  compelling as to be contagious, or whether Paul had resolutely determined on
  his own account to stay on the reservation at all costs to his personal
  feelings, Hannah was delighted to see what promised to be the happy outcome
  of an affair that had been brimming with danger.</p>

  <p>She often wondered whether the two of them had contrived to find a little
  time by themselves for an honest appraisal of their mutual attraction and a
  resolve to make it serve them rather than ruin them. This much Hannah never
  knew, though she strongly suspected that Paul and Eleanor must have talked it
  all over deliberately, judging from the considerable constraint between them
  on the occasion of their first evening together and the easy freedom of their
  contacts afterward.</p>

  <p>Of course, the chief reason for Hannah's happiness over this matter was
  undeniably practical. Now there would be no menace hanging over the
  Ward-Trimble friendship and no threat of scandals and separations.
  But&mdash;these considerations aside&mdash;it thrilled her to the very marrow
  as she watched the drama skilfully staged. After all was said that could
  possibly be said about the few outstanding acts and events which had a
  flavour of nobility, the most stirring experience anybody could expect to
  have in the course of a lifetime was the serene satisfaction of exerting a
  complete self-control under circumstances demanding that no outward sign be
  given of one's inner struggle.</p>

  <p>It was one kind of fortitude to grit one's teeth and silently sweat while
  the surgeon plied his trade. That sort of courage was good, and blessed were
  all they who had it. But the type of heroism that sent deliciously chilly
  little quivers twitching up and down Hannah's spine was the apparently
  effortless and tranquil demeanour of people who could endure hardness as good
  soldiers without turning a hair. Her admiration for Eleanor Trimble was so
  intense that she had difficulty in restraining it. And as for Paul, Hannah
  was of the opinion that there were very few people in the world like him, and
  impulsively told him so at midnight one Sunday when he came out to the
  kitchen after the Trimbles had left for home.</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Hannah," he had replied, a bit surprised by her frank remark.
  "But what made you say that?"</p>

  <p>"You know very well," she said, without looking up.</p>

  <p>"I came out for a box of matches," he explained.</p>

  <p>She reached a damp hand into the cupboard, and gave him a match-box. He
  lingered for an instant, and Hannah smiled into his inquisitive eyes.</p>

  <p>"I'm proud of you!" she said, barely above a whisper.</p>

  <p>A little embarrassed over this impetuous tribute, Paul filled his pipe to
  provide himself some occupation while sparring for an appropriate rejoinder.
  Presently he said, "Hannah, you're a remarkable woman."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;if I am&mdash;some of it's your fault."</p>

  <p>Paul patted her on the shoulder affectionately and turned towards the
  door. Tarrying, he drew a slightly diffident grin and drawled, "You see
  almost everything, don't you?"</p>

  <p>Hannah said she was glad she couldn't.</p>

  <p>"It's rather odd," he remarked reflectively. "You have always known so
  much about me&mdash;and I have known so very little about you."</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you some day," replied Hannah soberly, "if you really want me
  to."</p>

  <p>"Truly?"</p>

  <p>"Truly!"</p>

  <p>"Now?" He sauntered back.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;not now. It's a long story... it can wait."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>One of the most trying experiences of Hannah's life had arisen when it
  became evident that&mdash;in spite of her own wishes&mdash;Peter was to be
  sent to a military academy. If there was a principle worth sacrificing for
  above another it was the everlasting rightness of non-combative living. It
  had cost her heavily to practise that belief. If she had any one pet
  aspiration for her boy it was the hope that he might want to live without
  fighting. Now we were going to send him to a place that gave you scientific
  training for war. Lydia had calmly said that Colonel Livingstone, the head of
  the academy, was reputed to be a hard-boiled professional soldier of the old
  school. Hannah had seen his picture in the catalogue; stern, steely-eyed, a
  long scar on one bronzed cheek and a deep crease in the other where an early
  dimple had turned out to be a scowl&mdash;and jaws like a fox-trap.</p>

  <p>"Rather cross-looking, isn't he?" observed Hannah.</p>

  <p>"I'll wager," said Lydia calmly, "that this gentleman could bite the head
  right off of a hammer and puff it clear across the Rappahannock." Hannah had
  been demure and unreconcilable for an hour, and Lydia had hoped to say
  something droll enough to beguile a pensive smile.</p>

  <p>Hannah had made an earnest effort not to be resentful, but it did seem as
  if Thomas had wilfully done the one thing to their boy that she would have
  avoided at any price. She had tried to be understanding, but surely Thomas
  might have been a little more considerate of her feelings. Of course there
  were extenuating circumstances. Thomas and this Colonel Livingstone had
  prepared together at this academy when they were youngsters, forming an
  acquaintance that had outlasted the years. Later the colonel had gone to West
  Point and Thomas to Yale, but they had not forgotten their early days
  together in Virginia. It was natural, of course, that Thomas should want his
  boy to go there. Hannah had grieved when she saw her tall son in a cadet
  uniform, but there was nothing she could do about it.</p>

  <p>Thomas had promised he would not tell Peter about their relationship, at
  least until he was out on his own. He would furnish ample funds for Peter's
  education, to be deposited to Lydia's account and administered by her, with
  the proviso that Peter was to attend the preparatory school and college which
  Thomas chose. Whatever information Lydia cared to pass along to Hannah
  concerning plans for Peter was to be considered her own business, and if
  Hannah wished to offer suggestions she might do so through Lydia.</p>

  <p>Occasionally Thomas wrote to Lydia, when posting remittances, offering
  such reports of Peter's progress as he had learned through Colonel
  Livingstone.</p>

  <p>One Thursday morning in March, Hannah was met at the door in Waterloo by a
  very exuberant Lydia.</p>

  <p>"Lots of news for you," she exclaimed. "Just arrived. Fat letter from
  Thomas. Peter's been very bad. They've had to punish him. I'll tell you all
  about it. It's wonderful! You'll love it! I'm so thrilled! Take off your
  coat. Come out to the library."</p>

  <p>Thoroughly mystified, Hannah had followed Lydia, sinking weakly into a big
  leather chair and murmuring: "Don't tell me anything serious has happened to
  our boy. Oh&mdash;we shouldn't have let him go there, Lydia. Tell
  me&mdash;what has he done?"</p>

  <p>"It's a long story. Thomas says Peter let some other youngsters copy from
  his paper in a trig examination, and when Peter was brought up for it he told
  the professor he didn't know the other chap was copying. But unfortunately
  the culprit, in confessing, had declared that Peter knew all about it and had
  pushed the papers under his nose so he could see them better."</p>

  <p>"I suppose Peter wanted to do his friend a good turn," said Hannah, rising
  to his defence. "I'm glad he wasn't a tattle-tale."</p>

  <p>"Of course&mdash;but it was against the rules, and our Peter seems to have
  lied a little. So they cancelled his privileges&mdash;whatever that
  means&mdash;for ten days. One of the features of his punishment was that he
  was not to leave his barracks for any reason during that period."</p>

  <p>"But he wouldn't!" Hannah's face was troubled.</p>

  <p>"But he did! You see, Thomas was having a birthday. And he had written to
  Peter to meet him that next Saturday night, in Richmond. They would have
  dinner together and go to a show and Peter could return to school on the
  midnight train. And Peter didn't want to confess to Thomas that he was under
  punishment. So he sneaked out late that afternoon, in the face of orders not
  to leave the campus, and went to Richmond, where he spent the evening with
  Thomas, never breathing a word to him about the dreadful thing he had
  done."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Lydia! What did they do to him?" moaned Hannah.</p>

  <p>"Now don't hurry me, please. I'll tell you everything. He got back to the
  campus a little before two and hung about in the shadows of the trees until
  the sentry had passed, and then he edged his way along the buildings until he
  came to the Administration Hall. And there he smelled smoke. He looked into a
  basement window and saw a blaze."</p>

  <p>"How awful for him!" interposed Hannah. "I suppose he turned in an alarm
  and then they found out that he had been away."</p>

  <p>"No, he broke the window and let himself down into the basement, found the
  fire furiously burning, and while putting it out he singed his clothes and
  burned his hands severely. Then, instead of going to the hospital, he went to
  his room and tried to do something for his injuries by himself."</p>

  <p>"Lydia! How badly was he hurt?"</p>

  <p>"Badly enough so that explanations were in order. Next morning they
  discovered all the evidences of the fire, and found Peter's fountain-pen, and
  when he came to class they saw his bandaged hands. So, naturally, he was
  brought before Colonel Livingstone. Here is the letter that the Colonel wrote
  to Thomas, and also the report of his interview with Peter. You can read it
  for yourself." Lydia handed over the papers and sat gently rocking, as she
  waited with expectant eyes.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Dear Thomas (wrote the Colonel): I have been obliged to
  demote that young rapscallion Edmunds of whom you think so highly. I hope his
  punishment and humiliation will do him some good. He is a very headstrong
  youngster. I enclose a copy of the official stenographic report of my
  conference with him.</p><br>

  <p>Hannah turned to the impressive document with nervous fingers.</p><br>

  <p class="quote">Peter Edmunds, Major General in Company G, was then
  called:</p>

  <p class="quote">Colonel Livingstone: "Sergeant Edmunds, I understand you
  were under orders not to leave your barracks under any circumstances on the
  night of March thirteenth. Is that correct?"</p>

  <p class="quote">Edmunds: "Yes, sir."</p>

  <p class="quote">"Where were you on the night of March thirteenth?"</p>

  <p class="quote">"In Richmond, sir."</p>

  <p class="quote">"What were you doing there?"</p>

  <p class="quote">"Spending the evening with Mr Thomas Bradford, sir."</p>

  <p class="quote">"You knew you were violating a command of a superior
  officer?"</p>

  <p class="quote">"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p class="quote">"Did Mr Bradford know you were absent without leave?"</p>

  <p class="quote">"No, sir."</p>

  <p class="quote">"You knew the penalty for such conduct, did you not?"</p>

  <p class="quote">"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p class="quote">"It becomes my duty, then, to enforce the regulations. You
  lose your standing as a junior officer and are reduced to the ranks. You also
  forfeit all campus privileges for thirty days. You will also spend five days
  in the guardhouse, effective upon the adjournment of this conference. Is
  there anything you wish to say?"</p>

  <p class="quote">"No, sir."</p>

  <p class="quote">"That will do, then. You may go."</p>

  <p class="quote">"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p class="quote">"Just a moment: what is the matter with your hands?"</p>

  <p class="quote">"I burned them, sir."</p>

  <p class="quote">"I have had a report of that incident. Do you wish to make a
  statement about it?"</p>

  <p class="quote">"No, sir."</p>

  <p class="quote">"I am informed that on the night of March thirteenth you
  single-handedly extinguished a fire that might have destroyed this building.
  Is that true?"</p>

  <p class="quote">"I do not know, sir."</p>

  <p class="quote">"You do not know <i>what?"</i></p>

  <p class="quote">"Whether the fire would have destroyed the building,
  sir."</p>

  <p class="quote">"But you put it out?"</p>

  <p class="quote">"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p class="quote">"Have you been nourishing the hope that your gallantry or
  your injuries might give you immunity from punishment for your
  disobedience?"</p>

  <p class="quote">"No, sir."</p>

  <p class="quote">"Private Edmunds, when you have learned to obey orders you
  will probably make a good soldier."</p>

  <p class="quote">"Thank you, sir."</p>

  <p class="quote">"The Academy is deeply in your debt for a courageous
  act."</p>

  <p class="quote">"Thank you, sir."</p>

  <p class="quote">"I personally like you very much."</p>

  <p class="quote">"Thank you, sir."</p>

  <p class="quote">"Is there anything further you wish to say?"</p>

  <p class="quote">"Yes, sir. I like you very much too, sir."</p>

  <p class="quote">"That will be all, then, Private Edwards. You may report
  immediately at the guardhouse."</p><br>

  <p>Hannah's face was shining as she winked back the hot tears. Then, when she
  could speak, she said exultantly: "Lydia, I'll take back everything I've said
  about that place. Colonel Livingstone is wonderful! And <i>Peter!</i> My
  dear&mdash;I'm so proud! I've been repaid for
  everything&mdash;everything!"</p>

  <p>"And you won't fret any more about Peter's being in a school where they
  teach boys how to fight?"</p>

  <p>"Not if they teach that kind of fighting, Lydia." Hannah's wet eyes were
  radiant. <i>"That's the kind of fighting I believe in!"</i></p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The whole country was passing through a phase of unprecedented prosperity.
  Factories were running three shifts. Speculative stocks had fattened until
  their own grandmothers wouldn't have recognized them. The refrigerator
  business was booming. Paul Ward was well-to-do. He had been very successful
  in his adventures with the market.</p>

  <p>For some time it had been occurring to him that Hannah looked tired and
  drawn. One day late in May he said to her: "You need a vacation&mdash;not two
  weeks, this time, but a couple of months. How would you like to take an ocean
  voyage? Go back to England. Visit your relatives. See your old home. You've
  had this coming to you for a long time."</p>

  <p>Hannah tried to think of many reasons why she couldn't do it, but was
  overruled. Marcia, who had worried a little about Hannah's health, joined
  Paul in pressing the project. In a few days they had talked her into it, and
  now Paul was going downtown to arrange for her ship accommodations.</p>

  <p>"June sixteenth&mdash;the <i>Jefferson.</i> How's that?" he asked, hat in
  hand.</p>

  <p>Sally was in the kitchen chatting with Hannah when her father stepped in
  to make his inquiry.</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Mr Ward," said Hannah. "That will be fine."</p>

  <p>"We'll miss you dreadfully," said Sally.</p>

  <p>"I'll miss you too, dear. I wish you were going along. I know it will be a
  lonesome trip."</p>

  <p>Paul stroked his jaw thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said impulsively, "why not take Sally along?"</p>

  <p>"Do you mean it, Daddy?" she shouted, clutching at his sleeve. "Really?
  Could I, Daddy? Oh, would you, Hannah? Please!"</p>

  <p>Marcia drifted in to see what all the excitement was about. It wasn't a
  bad idea, she reflected. Perhaps Roberta could be handled more easily if she
  had her alone for a few weeks. And Roberta had been making things so
  difficult for Sally lately. Hannah would take care of the child, no question
  about that. Marcia approved the suggestion without debate. The whole affair
  was settled in fifteen minutes. Hannah's happiness shining in her eyes.</p>

  <p>Sally was so beside herself with joy that she ran up to tell Roberta. "I
  wish you were going too," she exclaimed, realizing as she said it that it
  wasn't quite true.</p>

  <p>"When I go abroad," sniffed Roberta dryly, "I'll hope to have more
  pleasant company than the family cook."</p>

  <p>"How can you say such things?" demanded Sally hotly.</p>

  <p>Roberta shrugged deeper into the pillows of her <i>chaise longue</i> and
  grinned contemptuously. She always enjoyed the sensation of getting a rise
  out of her amiable sister.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's so, isn't it?" she muttered. "Hannah is our cook, isn't she?
  Go along with her, if that's your idea of a congenial travelling
  companion."</p>

  <p>Wallie, who had a talent for earing-in on choice bits like this, laughed
  raucously from the hallway outside her open bedroom door and called:
  "Speaking of congenial travelling companions, I'd pity whoever went with
  <i>you."</i></p>

  <p>Roberta scrambled to her feet. Sally, assuming the door was now to be
  vigorously closed against Wallie's badgering, decided that her absence was
  probably desired and left the room. At Wallie's door she paused.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't yell things like that at Roberta."</p>

  <p>"Why should you care?" growled Wallie. "She's certainly been mean enough
  to you."</p>

  <p>"Cross, maybe," Sally admitted. "Not mean&mdash;any other way."</p>

  <p>Wallie elevated one eyebrow mysteriously.</p>

  <p>"She's jealous of you." He lowered his tone to a confidential warning. "I
  wouldn't trust that gal around the corner with a bag of peanuts. Not any
  more."</p>

  <p>Sally stood for a moment with troubled eyes pondering this remark and was
  about to ask Wallie just what he meant. Then, deciding not to pursue the
  painful subject further, she turned slowly away and went downstairs hoping to
  revive her spirits with Hannah.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>She was counting the days now. School was out. Two weeks from Saturday was
  to be the great day! It was hard to wait.</p>

  <p>One morning Hannah seemed much disturbed about something. She had had a
  letter. Sally sincerely hoped it wasn't anything that might interfere with
  their plans. She lingered in the kitchen and followed Hannah about through
  the house hoping to learn what was up, but no confidences were
  forthcoming.</p>

  <p>As the days passed, Hannah's abstracted manner persisted. Sally would
  endeavour by her own exuberance to re-enlist enthusiasm for the delightful
  voyage; and Hannah, rallying, would go through all the emotions of ecstatic
  anticipation from which nothing was lacking&mdash;but genuineness.</p>

  <p>Hannah would have given much to have been able to cancel the trip, but
  couldn't get the consent of her own mind to disappoint Sally. Besides, she
  was not in a position to offer a satisfactory explanation. The letter that
  had perplexed her was from Lydia, enclosing one she had just received from
  Peter. "Uncle" Thomas was taking him abroad for the summer. They were going
  to France first for a couple of weeks but would spend most of their time in
  England. They were sailing on the <i>Faversham</i> on the twelfth.</p>

  <p>Hannah was glad enough that her boy was to have this interesting
  experience, but it troubled her to consider the possibility of a chance
  encounter over there. She did not want to see Thomas.</p>

  <p>Above all, she did not want to meet Thomas in company with their son. The
  situation would be more than she could deal with.</p>

  <p>And she didn't want Peter and Sally to find each other.</p>

  <p>During their brief married life Thomas had often encouraged her to talk of
  her childhood home near Reigate in Surrey. What if Thomas should decide to
  tour with Peter in that neighbourhood? It was unlikely that he would want to
  do that, but it was hard to predict what Thomas might want to do. She went to
  Waterloo and talked it over with Lydia, who laughed at her apprehensions.</p>

  <p>"Don't be foolish, Hannah. There isn't a chance in a thousand that you
  will meet them. And why should Thomas think of taking Peter to visit your old
  home? He has promised to keep your secret and I believe you can trust him. He
  hasn't told Peter anything&mdash;about their relationship, or yours."</p>

  <p>"Are you quite sure of that, Lydia?" urged Hannah for the dozenth time.
  "How can you know?"</p>

  <p>"For the simple reason that Peter has never asked any questions. Do you
  suppose that boy would carry on as usual, saying nothing to me about it, if
  Thomas had confided?"</p>

  <p>"Then you think I'm entirely safe to go&mdash;and take Sally Ward with
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Of course!" Lydia dismissed Hannah's fears with a toss of her hand. "We
  needn't tell Peter you are going over. He'll not be looking for you. I
  wouldn't give it another minute's thought."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>There were plenty of young people aboard the <i>Jefferson,</i> most of
  them in touring parties directed by teachers. Sally was instantly drawn into
  their deck sports and social affairs. But there was also much time for
  leisurely chats with Hannah. It pleased her to see that there was a marked
  change in their relationship since leaving home for this voyage. Hannah
  wasn't treating her as if she were a child. Sally had been a bit anxious
  about that. It was comforting to feel that she had grown up.</p>

  <p>One afternoon, seated in their deck chairs reading, Sally glanced across
  to say, "Did you see Peter last week, when you were in Waterloo?"</p>

  <p>Hannah shook her head and after a little pause explained that Peter hadn't
  come home from school.</p>

  <p>"Did you write him that I was going to England with you?"</p>

  <p>"No, dear&mdash;I don't believe I did."</p>

  <p>Sally pretended to read another page.</p>

  <p>"I wonder why you didn't," she remarked softly, half to herself.</p>

  <p>Hannah reminded her that her decision to come along on the trip had been
  arrived at suddenly. "There were so many things to think about," she
  added.</p>

  <p>"Oh, well," said Sally, her eyes returning to the novel, "it probably
  wouldn't have interested him. I haven't heard from Peter for ever so long,
  you know."</p>

  <p>For a little while Hannah privately debated whether to let the matter drop
  without risking further discussion. But this seemed a rather cold-blooded
  attitude to take, in view of the singularly close comradeship they
  sustained.</p>

  <p>"Peter doesn't write to his Aunt Hannah very often, either," she replied
  quietly. "Their hours at the Military Academy are well filled, I
  suppose."</p>

  <p>"With doing what?" Sally wondered, half-querulously. "Marching and
  dressing-up and playing at being soldiers. Or maybe he doesn't tell you much
  about it." She laughed a little, teasingly. "He wouldn't want to annoy you
  with talk about such things, knowing how you feel about fighting. You didn't
  want him to go there, did you, Hannah?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;not at first."</p>

  <p>Sally's eyes widened, and suddenly sitting up very straight in her steamer
  chair she said, "You mean&mdash;you approve of it now?"</p>

  <p>"Well"&mdash;Hannah faltered, not finding it easy to define her
  sentiments&mdash;"I could have wished that Peter was some place else than in
  a military school, and I still dislike fighting as much as ever, but I'm
  grateful for the discipline he's getting. People have to train carefully to
  keep themselves well in hand&mdash;if they're to live without
  fighting&mdash;and I think Peter is getting that kind of experience."</p>

  <p>Sally laughed.</p>

  <p>"That's funny," she declared. "I never thought of boys going to a military
  school to learn how to keep from fighting."</p>

  <p>Hannah was silently thoughtful for some time. Then she laid her hand on
  Sally's and said:</p>

  <p>"I'm going to tell you a little story, dear, so you'll understand what I
  mean. I don't want you to think that I have changed my mind about war or the
  things that lead to war. But it is important, I think, that people should
  learn early how to control their feelings and take their medicine. This story
  is about something that happened to Peter last spring."</p>

  <p>Sally's eyes brightened attentively.</p>

  <p>Hannah told it slowly and in detail and when she came to the point of the
  formal interview between Colonel Livingstone and Peter she unlatched her
  handbag and handed Sally the much-folded document, silently observing the
  girl's increasingly serious face as she followed the typed lines. Presently
  Sally's eyes swam with tears.</p>

  <p>"Wasn't he marvellous?" she murmured, deeply moved.</p>

  <p>"Wonderful man," assented Hannah.</p>

  <p>"I mean Peter!" declared Sally. "Colonel Livingstone was an old
  meanie."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;not a meanie. Peter's performance was grand, of course, but I
  don't think he would or could have done that the first day he was there in
  school. He had to learn that kind of control by associating with men who
  believed in it. It's a great thing for Peter just to be able to see Colonel
  Livingstone every day, and breathe the same air."</p>

  <p>There was a long pause.</p>

  <p>"Did Peter write to you about it?" asked Sally.</p>

  <p>"Not a line," replied Hannah proudly, "nor to his mother. We found out
  about it through his&mdash;uncle."</p>

  <p>"Don't you suppose he was pleased with himself, though, over the way he
  carried on? I should have thought he would want you to know all about
  it&mdash;and his mother, too."</p>

  <p>"That's just it!" declared Hannah. "That's where the fineness of the whole
  thing comes in! Somehow they've managed to teach Peter the importance of
  private bravery&mdash;bravery that isn't bragged about. Sally, the greatest
  thing anybody can do is to build himself up strongly <i>on the inside.</i>
  The trouble with most people is that they don't think enough of the value of
  their own inner selves. If they do something courageous, they want credit for
  it, want to be flattered, want to tell it to others. And then, you see, the
  real value of it to themselves is gone."</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;because they've collected all their pay for it in their
  family's oh's and ah's?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly! They get all their reward from the outside instead of privately
  storing it up on the <i>inside!</i> It means a great deal, Sally, to have a
  lot of strength under lock and key, strength that nobody knows about but
  <i>you</i>&mdash;<i>only you."</i></p>

  <p>Sally sighed and smiled wistfully.</p>

  <p>"I expect," she ventured, groping for the words, "that people who go about
  with a lot of proud secrets about themselves, all locked up on the inside,
  are awfully lonely."</p>

  <p>Hannah shook her head decisively.</p>

  <p>"They're the people who are <i>never</i> lonely! Their memories are good
  company. It's the people who have no proud memories who are lonely, dear.
  They don't like to be by themselves because&mdash;well, there's nothing
  interesting there. The place is empty. <i>They have told everything
  away!"</i></p>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">CYNTHIA BRADFORD had become a very restless and discontented
  woman. Considering with what reptilious patience she had waited for the
  bright day when she might legally detach herself from Thomas without
  jeopardizing the bequest promised by her crotchety old mother-in-law, it was
  unfortunate that her freedom had not afforded her a higher degree of
  satisfaction.</p>

  <p>For years Cynthia had been envious of women friends who, finding life with
  their husbands irksome or upsetting, had "taken the cure" in some
  liberal-minded court. But no sooner was she herself at full liberty to do
  exactly as she pleased than it dismayed her to discover that she did not know
  exactly what it would be her pleasure to do.</p>

  <p>After six months of it, she heartily wished she was still Thomas
  Bradford's wife. He did not love her and never had, nor did she love him, but
  he had been considerate of her comfort, amiable, courteous, kind. And now she
  was missing him more than she had previously longed to be free of him. Every
  scrap of news about his movements was interesting. At Christmas-time and on
  his birthday she sent greetings to which he graciously but briefly responded,
  with a remote formality not calculated to encourage a renewal of their broken
  ties.</p>

  <p>Always a nomad, Cynthia's mileage had soared to dizzying figures. Had she
  been a <i>de luxe</i> motor-car, she would have been junked by now. She had
  gone to India and stayed until it was too rainy, and on to China until it was
  too dusty. She knew more about Egypt than the Egyptians. Sometimes she would
  spend a month in Florence and sometimes she would visit old friends in
  Cannes. She liked spring in England and autumn in Sorrento. But eventually
  she always came back to Paris. If you were obliged to live alone, said
  Cynthia, Paris was the least undesirable place in the world to do it in.</p>

  <p>There had been a brief period after the death of Martin Moore when it
  seemed that Adele might become a confidential comrade. But their intimacy had
  not lasted very long. Adele became inattentive to Cynthia's self-piteous
  chatter, and felt under no obligation to be the confidant for her tangled
  heart affairs. They did not quarrel; they just drifted apart. Whenever
  Cynthia returned to Paris after an extended absence she would call up Adele
  and they would have luncheon together. And that would be all for a while.
  Adele found these infrequent reunions difficult to handle. A couple of years
  ago, returning from a summer in the States, she had imprudently remarked that
  she had seen a little of Thomas at Bar Harbour. Cynthia confessed that she
  wished she had the courage to spend some time there, but couldn't take the
  risk of having her friends think she was sparring for a reconciliation.</p>

  <p>Yesterday, as they had sat together at Prunier's, Adele, weary unto death
  of Cynthia's monotonous prattle about Thomas, reflected that if she wanted to
  she could give her tiresome friend some amazing news. She wondered what
  manner of fit Cynthia might have if it were suddenly blurted out that Thomas
  was now spending the best of his time and thought on the education of his
  idolized son. They ate their fillet of sole Marguéry with a little bottle of
  Barsac and promised to see each other again very soon, privately aware that
  their next engagement would probably not occur for months.</p>

  <p>Adele was a bit annoyed, therefore, when she heard Cynthia's voice on the
  telephone next morning.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen to-day's <i>Matin?"</i> inquired Cynthia excitedly.</p>

  <p>"No. What about it?"</p>

  <p>"Thomas is here&mdash;at the Ritz."</p>

  <p>"Really?"</p>

  <p>"And his nephew is with him&mdash;a Peter Edmunds. Thomas has no nephew.
  What do you make of it?"</p>

  <p>Adele wished she had a little more time to organize a reply. Surely Thomas
  had been indiscreet in bringing Peter to Paris. Perhaps he hadn't realized
  the depth of Cynthia's interest in his movements. "Well," she drawled, "I
  suppose it is just one of those mistakes that newspapers insist on
  making."</p>

  <p>"Will you be seeing him?"</p>

  <p>"That depends on Thomas."</p>

  <p>"You aren't going to call him up?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I?"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Cynthia's curiosity was rapidly devouring her. She telephoned the Ritz for
  a reservation, packed a couple of wardrobe cases, summoned a taxi, and within
  an hour was giving herself little errands in the lobby, at the information
  desk, in the lounge, all over the place, indeed, changing her mind about
  lunching in the grill after she had had a careful look at it, and proceeding
  to the more imposing dining-salon, where she ate without appetite, her eyes
  attentive to the door.</p>

  <p>As for Adele, her interest had been stirred too by the news of Peter's
  presence in town. Doubtless Thomas would want to bring them together for a
  brief visit. Thomas knew where she lived&mdash;at the Crillon; or did he?
  Perhaps he had wanted to locate her, but had forgotten her address. She
  decided not to take the chance of missing a glimpse of Peter.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Dear Boy (she wrote): I see you are here with Uncle Thomas.
  For how long, and am I going to see you?</p>

  <p class="letter">Lovingly</p>

  <p class="letter">AUNT ADELE.</p><br>

  <p>Calling a messenger, she dispatched the note, and was much excited when
  the reply came at seven while she was dressing for dinner. Peter was anxious
  to see her. They had arrived only yesterday. Uncle Thomas hoped she could
  dine with them to-morrow evening.</p>

  <p>Three hours later Thomas telephoned to confirm the invitation. He was
  cordial, but it was easy to see that he had something perplexing on his
  mind.</p>

  <p>"I hadn't counted on seeing Cynthia," he remarked in a tone that gave away
  his anxiety. "It's just a bit awkward. She is here at the Ritz. We
  encountered her in the lobby this evening. Naturally I had to introduce
  Peter. I'm not at all keen on their knowing each other. They're both fairly
  good at asking questions, you know. Perhaps it would be more sensible if
  Peter and I pushed along to London. I should like to have a little chat with
  you about it."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you run over here now?" suggested Adele. "I'm quite at
  liberty."</p>

  <p>Thomas said he would do so. Tapping on Peter's adjacent door, he told him
  he would be out on an errand for a while. Peter had been tramping about all
  day at Versailles, and was glad enough not to have been included in whatever
  it was Uncle Thomas wanted to do. A few minutes after he had been left alone,
  he decided to go down and buy some French magazines to pass the time.</p>

  <p>There he met this Cynthia person again. Uncle Thomas hadn't said her last
  name; or, if he had, Peter had muffed it. She was extremely affable as she
  plied him with the usual questions asked of newcomers. How was he liking
  Paris, and was this his first time?... And where did he live, and was Mr
  Bradford really his uncle?</p>

  <p>Cynthia quite took Peter's breath away with the volume and velocity of her
  queries. They were expressed, however, in a rather disarming manner. It was
  obvious that this lady was eager to talk with almost anyone from her native
  land, and doubtless this was just her way of showing a friendly interest. She
  suggested&mdash;moving towards the lounge as she did so&mdash;that they sit
  down and have a little chat if Peter wasn't rushing off to do something
  else&mdash;and he couldn't think of any good reason for declining. In fact,
  it was difficult to disoblige her. Apparently she was the kind of a woman who
  took things in her own hands and merely permitted you to watch while she had
  her own way. So they strolled into the almost deserted red and gold lounge
  and sat together on a divan.</p>

  <p>Deciding that there was no occasion to be secretive with this lonesome
  woman who wanted to talk, Peter briefly replied to her questions, told her
  where he lived, where he went to school, how he had met Mr Bradford, who,
  having no family, had taken an interest in him probably because his own
  father was dead.</p>

  <p>"What an interesting story!" commented Cynthia. "I suppose Mr Bradford
  really seems like an uncle, now that you've seen so much of each other."</p>

  <p>Peter smiled and admitted that this was true. Cynthia laughed a little and
  gnawed her lip, her cryptic expression hinting that she might be about to
  impart some interesting sidelights on this matter.</p>

  <p>"Well," she continued, after a meditative pause, "if Mr Bradford is almost
  your Uncle Thomas, I think I could be considered almost your Aunt Cynthia.
  Perhaps you don't know that I was your Uncle Thomas's wife, once upon a
  time." She laughed again, rather nervously, and studied his face with
  amusement.</p>

  <p>"N-no," admitted Peter, slightly flustered. "But he never talks much about
  himself."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I shouldn't have told you. Maybe he didn't want you to know,
  though I can't see why not. There isn't anything private about it."</p>

  <p>Peter was finding it a warm evening, and patted the perspiration on his
  forehead with his handkerchief, Cynthia regarding him attentively. She
  chuckled, and laid a light hand on his arm.</p>

  <p>"You love him very much, don't you?" she said gently. "You've picked up so
  many of his little tricks." She leaned forward as if about to rise, noting
  that Peter was growing restless and quite at a loss for suitable rejoinders
  to her personal comments. "Well, now you've an Aunt Cynthia, so perhaps
  you'll let me call you Peter."</p>

  <p>He smiled briefly and nodded. It occurred to him that if he wasn't to be
  considered absolutely tongue-tied, it would be to his advantage to make some
  sort of remark.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," he said, with an effort to be pleasant. "One can always make
  room for another aunt."</p>

  <p>"Sounds as though you had quite an assortment," she observed
  invitingly.</p>

  <p>For a split second Peter was on the point of mentioning Aunt Adele, but
  his intuition warned him that this might lead to complications, for Aunt
  Adele lived here in Paris. Maybe Uncle Thomas might have some reasons for
  keeping his Cynthia out of their affairs. He decided not to say anything
  about Aunt Adele.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied&mdash;adding gallantly, "and they're all very nice."</p>

  <p>Cynthia rose.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it would be just as well if you didn't say anything to Mr
  Bradford about our talk, Peter. I can't think of any reason why he wouldn't
  want you to know about me, but maybe it would be better to let him tell you
  when he gets around to it. Agreed?"</p>

  <p>Peter was prompt to oblige her with a promise. Indeed, he had fully
  decided not to mention the incident. After all, it was none of his business,
  and it occurred to him to say so now, without realizing that his remark
  really implied a reproof to Cynthia for being so free with her chatter.</p>

  <p>"No, I'll not tell. Anyhow, it doesn't concern <i>me."</i></p>

  <p>Cynthia blinked rapidly a few times and flushed a little under her rouge.
  It had irritated her more than she was disposed to admit to herself that
  Thomas's indifference to their former relation was so bland he hadn't even
  troubled to mention her name to Peter.</p>

  <p>"Of course not," she replied crisply. "Thomas wouldn't bother to speak to
  you of his wives."</p>

  <p>Peter's brow arched a little, inquisitively, but he did not ask for any
  further light. They were retracing their steps to the lobby now, Cynthia with
  the uncomfortable sensation that the handsome young fellow's
  silence&mdash;after her last catty comment&mdash;had left her holding the
  conversational bag in the awkwardest possible manner.</p>

  <p>"There were two of us," she continued, hotly, clipping her words. "There
  was a Hannah somebody before me. Hannah Parmalee, or some such name...
  Well&mdash;I hope you have a good time here, Peter. I may not be seeing you
  again. I'm leaving in the morning." She extended her hand, and Peter took it
  mechanically.</p>

  <p>"Good night," he said, with eyes averted. Then he turned away towards the
  lift, forgetting that he wanted the magazines.</p>

  <p>He did not see Uncle Thomas again that night. Uncle Thomas had come in
  late, and hearing no stir in the adjoining room had probably decided that
  Peter was asleep.</p>

  <p>For a long time he sat by the window, his thoughts in a grand state of
  confusion. It was difficult to know where to begin in this almost
  unbelievable tangle of relationships. This Cynthia was really a quite
  terrible person, bent on having some kind of revenge. If she had been married
  to Uncle Thomas, which was probably true, he had done very well to be rid of
  her. Now she was going to get even with him by attempting to prejudice Peter
  against him. So much for that.</p>

  <p>But <i>Aunt Hannah?</i> Was this the reason why Uncle Thomas had taken so
  much interest in him? Because, once upon a time, Aunt Hannah had been his
  wife? Why, if this were true, Uncle Thomas really <i>was</i> his uncle! Peter
  grinned and then chuckled a little. This explained a great many things. Maybe
  Uncle Thomas felt badly about it and wanted to make it up to Aunt Hannah; had
  decided to be good to her nephew.</p>

  <p>And then he fell to thinking about Aunt Hannah's being a servant. Was it
  possible that Uncle Thomas&mdash;so generous and tender-hearted&mdash;would
  leave her in such a plight? Maybe he had wanted to help her and she wouldn't
  accept it. There never had been a person as independent as Aunt Hannah. The
  whole affair was very baffling indeed. He wished he dared talk to Aunt Adele
  about it, but that wouldn't be quite loyal to Uncle Thomas. Obviously, Uncle
  Thomas didn't want him to know anything about it, or he would have told him.
  But there had never been any secret about Aunt Hannah's being his aunt; why
  should there be a mystery about Uncle Thomas? Why hadn't they told him?</p>

  <p>Peter undressed and got into bed, but he was not sleepy. The intricate web
  refused to disentangle itself. The more he thought about it, the more
  perplexing it was. Well, he would have to wait until somebody who knew all
  about it was ready to tell him. He wasn't going to make Uncle Thomas unhappy
  with questions. Uncle Thomas was the grandest man alive, and he wouldn't
  annoy him. Their affections mustn't have the slightest strain put on it. It
  was too precious.</p>

  <p>And if Aunt Hannah hadn't wanted him to know about Uncle Thomas, that was
  her own business. She must have had some reason, and it wouldn't be anything
  to the discredit of either of them; he knew that.</p>

  <p>He finally dropped off to sleep wondering what Sally would think if she
  knew that his Uncle Thomas, of whom he had so often spoke and written, was
  indeed his real uncle. How her blue eyes would open in surprise! And why had
  Sally stopped writing to him? He wished he knew. Of course it couldn't have
  been because she had discovered some secret that disturbed her. That was
  nonsense. Sally had seen another boy that she liked better, and had forgotten
  him.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>They went down to Reigate in a motor-bus. London was just another great
  city to Hannah. She couldn't remember anything about it. But as they neared
  Reigate her childhood memories were stirred. Sally thought it better not to
  bother her with too many questions, for Hannah seemed wholly occupied with
  the attempted recovery of impressions received when a little girl.</p>

  <p>Howard Hall, where Dan Parmalee had learned about trees and shrubs and
  flowers, was on the easterly lip of the picturesque Holmsdale Hollow valley,
  within easy sight of Reigate. The high-road that served the massive old pile
  of weatherbeaten stone was an authentic strip of the storied Pilgrims'
  Way.</p>

  <p>Before they had left home, Sally's father had given her a book about
  Canterbury and the pilgrimages, knowing that Hannah would be taking her down
  to Reigate.</p>

  <p>"Maybe I had better read the <i>Canterbury Tales</i> too," said Sally.</p>

  <p>"That will hardly be necessary," advised Paul. "Not much in that book
  about Canterbury&mdash;or the pilgrims, either."</p>

  <p>They alighted from the motor-bus at the great wrought-iron gates of Howard
  Hall, and Hannah made inquiries of the lodge-keepers' wife.</p>

  <p>"Is anyone working here now," she asked, "named Parmalee?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the woman. "James Parmalee is the head gardener. And his
  daughter Hannah is a maid at the hall. And young James works in the garden,
  too."</p>

  <p>Sally was bright-eyed and excited. Imagine! Hannah had a namesake she had
  never seen. Wouldn't it be fun to see their meeting? Hannah explained their
  errand, and the lodge-keeper's wife told them to follow the drive. James
  would probably be found in the rose garden.</p>

  <p>"Does it look natural, Hannah?" asked Sally. "Won't it be interesting to
  see the little house you lived in? And Peter's mother, too. She was a little
  girl here, wasn't she?"</p>

  <p>"No, dear. Peter's mother is just a very good friend of mine. She never
  lived here."</p>

  <p>"Then you're not Peter's aunt?"</p>

  <p>Hannah, wholly occupied with the familiar old scenes, replied absently,
  "No&mdash;we just taught Peter to call me aunt."</p>

  <p>"And you're no relation at all?"</p>

  <p>"See, Sally! There's the rose garden, and some men working. I think we'd
  better inquire of them."</p>

  <p>They were regarded with interest as they approached. An older man,
  standing a little apart from the others, walked towards them slowly.</p>

  <p>"I am looking for James Parmalee," said Hannah. Her voice was unsteady.
  Sally wondered if this was not he, and whether Hannah didn't suspect it.</p>

  <p>"I am James Parmalee, ma'am." He was a tall man, with huge shoulders and
  big hands and deep-set grey eyes.</p>

  <p>"I am your sister Hannah." The words were spoken quietly.</p>

  <p>James Parmalee's face was a study in mystification. Then he drew a smile
  that established their relationship beyond all question. He advanced, rubbing
  a large hand on his brown smock, and offered it. "Glad you've come, Hannah.
  Is this your little girl, maybe?"</p>

  <p>Hannah explained Sally briefly.</p>

  <p>"I hear you have a Hannah, too, James. We will want to see her."</p>

  <p>"Yes, we'll be finding her. Here's my boy." He beckoned to the youngest of
  his crew. "Come here, James."</p>

  <p>Sally's heart thumped as he approached. <i>He looked like Peter!</i> If
  they had been brothers they couldn't have resembled each other any more
  closely!</p>

  <p>It was an eventful afternoon, with tea at the cottage. Hannah hadn't been
  able to remember Mrs James, whose people had lived down in Tunbridge Wells,
  but they were not long in getting acquainted. The girl Hannah resembled her
  mother. Sally was made much of by the family. She was delighted over the
  friendly way they accepted her into the party. It was difficult for her to
  keep from showing too much curiosity about young James. After a while he
  seemed to realize that Sally was checking him up with unusual interest, and
  the half-shy glance he gave her made him look more than ever like Peter.</p>

  <p>They spent the night at the cottage, and returned to London the next
  afternoon. After they were well started, Sally roused Hannah from a reverie
  by saying, "Isn't it funny how much James looks like Peter?"</p>

  <p>Hannah regarded her soberly for a moment and then said, with a smile,
  "Peter seems to be much on your mind, Sally... But&mdash;James really is a
  very handsome boy."</p>

  <p>They rode in silence for a while.</p>

  <p>"Hannah, did you ever wish you had children?" asked Sally
  irrelevantly.</p>

  <p>"Well, I have <i>you</i>, Sally. You're almost like my own." Hannah's tone
  was tender.</p>

  <p>"And Peter," assisted Sally.</p>

  <p>Hannah turned her face towards the window again and nodded. Then they were
  busy with their own thoughts, not speaking to each other again until they
  were slowing down for London. Sally couldn't help feeling that she had
  stumbled into a mystery.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Once Peter had determined not to pester his Uncle Thomas with any
  questions based on the impertinent assault that had been made on him by the
  awful Cynthia person, it was not a difficult matter to view his hero with the
  same feeling of admiration he had had before. How much of it was true he
  didn't know and had no means of finding out. He would forget it. Above all
  other objectionable organisms in the natural world, Peter loathed a tattler.
  Uncle Thomas had often said that tattlers were always cowards at heart, and
  invariably liars to boot. Perhaps that's what this Cynthia was. Uncle Thomas
  should have the benefit of all the doubts.</p>

  <p>The dinner with Aunt Adele hadn't been quite as much fun as he had
  anticipated, mostly because Uncle Thomas was very quiet and seemed
  preoccupied. As soon as they had left Paris he cheered up and was quite
  himself again. Peter was much pleased.</p>

  <p>Uncle Thomas knew London so well that he never had to inquire his way. Day
  after day he thought up new excursions, and he seemed to take delight in
  watching Peter's enthusiastic reactions to everything he was experiencing for
  the first time. They wandered along the Embankment searching for the old
  Water Gate. They spent hours in the Abbey. They went by underground miles and
  miles to bob up in fantastic old-worldish suburbs, each crowded with relics
  of important historical significance. They made short work of the famous art
  galleries and a long job of inspecting the Tower.</p>

  <p>One afternoon they went, in carnival mood, to the Regent Park Zoo. Uncle
  Thomas had been postponing this pleasure on the ground that monkey cages in
  midsummer were something he could jolly well do without, but he finally
  yielded to Peter's importunities, specifying that he himself would spend most
  of his time out of doors communing with the penguins.</p>

  <p>Peter was in an hilarious mood that day. When they came to the fenced
  enclosure where a patient elephant sleepily plodded around a half-acre circle
  carrying loads of sightseers for a sixpence, he dared Uncle Thomas to take a
  ride with him.</p>

  <p>"You may," consented Uncle Thomas indulgently, "but I've quite passed the
  time of life when people do such things."</p>

  <p>So Peter lined up in the queue and waited his turn. Uncle Thomas strolling
  on towards the penguin pool, where, he said, he would meet Peter when he was
  through with his silly adventure. Most of the passengers standing in line
  were younger than Peter, but he didn't much mind that. Presently he climbed
  the steps, took his seat on the wooden housing, and was soon being bobbed
  along on the elephant, feeling rather foolish as he looked down into the
  amused faces of the spectators.</p>

  <p>When they were half-way around the circle, his heart almost stood still.
  Sauntering along the path were Sally and Aunt Hannah! He called "Sally!" and
  the English lad on the bench beside him glanced up with an expression
  suggesting that this wasn't the way well-behaved people acted in London when
  they rode on elephants. He would have to wait until the stupid old
  monstrosity completed the journey back to the little mounting platform.</p>

  <p>The business of unloading was exasperatingly tedious, something like
  docking a steamship. At length Peter was on the ground again, pushing through
  the crowd.</p>

  <p>Hurrying around the enclosure to the place where he had seen Aunt Hannah
  and Sally, he stood for some minutes anxiously looking both ways. Then he
  joined the crowd moving in the direction they had taken, eagerly scanning
  faces and trying to see over the tops of people's heads. With mounting panic,
  he carried on, debating his course where paths diverged, and finally bringing
  up at the penguin pool, where he found Uncle Thomas sitting on a bench.</p>

  <p>"Well. Judging by the heat you have stirred up," observed Uncle Thomas,
  "it looks as if the elephant might have been riding <i>you!</i> What's all
  the excitement?"</p>

  <p>"I'm looking for Aunt Hannah," said Peter breathlessly, "and Sally. I saw
  them. Will you wait here, please, while I find them?"</p>

  <p>Uncle Thomas seemed suddenly perplexed.</p>

  <p>"I'd rather you didn't, Peter," he said soberly. "Your Aunt Hannah may
  find it embarrassing."</p>

  <p>"But Uncle Thomas, <i>I just have to see Sally!"</i></p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SO now Peter wasn't going to amount to anything, after all.
  Life had poured out some very bitter medicine, probably good for what ailed
  you at the moment, but this particular dose seemed unnecessarily
  distasteful.</p>

  <p>For twenty years no personal desire had seriously engaged Hannah's
  attention but the one constant hope for Peter's future. At all costs, this
  dear boy must be given a chance to make an honoured place for himself in a
  world for which his mother had obsequiously fetched and carried ever since
  she was a little girl.</p>

  <p>Hannah hadn't asked Life to grant her more than that, the assurance that
  her son's path might be cleared of obstacles. And to her Spartan mind, the
  chief obstacle to be cleared away was herself. It had not been easy to do,
  but she had done it.</p>

  <p>She was ill-prepared, this morning, to brace her disciplined emotions
  against this sickening blow. The letter from Lydia found her thoroughly
  exhausted and in mental turmoil. For the past five days, Paul Ward's critical
  condition, as he lay broken to bits and half delirious in the University
  Hospital, had worried her into a state of utter collapse. It was an
  unfortunate hour for the receipt of bad news.</p>

  <p>Now the dream that had sustained her for so long, through all weathers,
  had vanished. It would be almost impossible, she felt, to carry on any
  further without the girding of that one bright hope. The whole world had
  suddenly lost its meaning. The thing Hannah had lived for had been destroyed:
  Peter was not going to amount to anything, after all.</p>

  <p>The pages of Lydia's letter&mdash;and Thomas's&mdash;rattled in Hannah's
  agitated fingers as she re-read them. How could Lydia bring herself to the
  point of writing calmly of a disaster so complete and overwhelming? Thomas
  was arranging that Peter should be a genteel loafer like himself. He had
  planned it with crafty care.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">As I am intending to make Peter my heir (Thomas had written
  to Lydia), he will have no occasion to work. Now, at the close of his
  sophomore year, he faces a decision on this matter. As you know, Peter has
  always been interested in chemistry and has done very well indeed with his
  elementary study of it. He has talked much about his ambition to pursue this
  subject seriously and with a view to the practice of chemical engineering as
  a profession.</p>

  <p class="letter">But it isn't important that every man should undertake a
  profession. The few who find themselves able to live without a gainful
  occupation ought to be contented with their destiny and grateful for their
  freedom from toil. I have tried to explain to Peter that it isn't very good
  cricket for a man of independent means&mdash;as he will be if he follows my
  suggestions&mdash;to insist on elbowing some less fortunate fellow out of a
  chance to earn his living. Every time a well-to-do trains himself for a
  remunerative job, he is taking bread out of the mouths of people who need
  that work and would gladly perform it if they had a chance. This, in my
  opinion, is decidedly unethical.</p>

  <p class="letter">For some time I have been seriously considering the
  purchase of a sea-going yacht. It would give me an enormous amount of
  pleasure to have Peter with me on an extended cruise. We would be gone two
  years, probably. On our return, if Peter wishes to resume college work either
  here or abroad, for leisurely study of history, æsthetics, the humanities,
  philosophy, and other subjects which embellish a gentleman's life, I shall be
  quite agreed to his doing so. But I am firmly opposed to his entering upon a
  grubby experience of the noxious stews and stinks of a chemical laboratory,
  with nothing to come of it but hard work in some job that he doesn't
  need&mdash;and by rights shouldn't ask for. Aside from my personal wishes for
  Peter, there is a little matter of morals involved here which I hope will
  impress you&mdash;and Hannah, too.</p><br>

  <p>Hannah read this part of it dully. Her mind was too tired to consider it
  with any degree of fair judgment. She could think of no immediate arguments
  to refute Thomas's theories about the immorality of work performed by people
  who didn't have to. All she could see in this dismaying proposal of Thomas's
  was the ugly, stark-naked fact that he was planning to make a worthless
  nobody of their son. She closed her hot eyes, hung her head, and let the
  whole tragedy engulf her like a tidal wave.</p>

  <p>She had never given way to self-pity, and in the course of the long,
  difficult years she had shed very few tears on her own behalf. But really,
  wasn't this impending calamity too serious to be borne without putting up an
  uncompromising struggle? Was there any merit in sitting quietly and silently
  while this crime was committed? Was it for a disappointment like this that
  she had given up her child in his babyhood and waived all rights to his
  affection? And was it for this that she had practised all manner of little
  deceits to spare his pride and speed his way towards an honourable and
  respected career?</p>

  <p>The house was very quiet. Occasionally Hannah caught the sound of Mrs
  Ward's soothing tones as she tried to console Wallie, who had been lucky
  enough to come through his motor crash with no worse injuries than a
  fractured arm and a few clean gashes made by broken glass. It wasn't Wallie's
  physical hurts that distressed him: he would get over them in a couple of
  weeks. Wallie's aches now were in his heart, an apparently sincere regret
  over the reckless, smart-alecky driving that had put his father's life in
  jeopardy. Hannah couldn't remember ever having seen Wallie candidly repentant
  over any of his blunders. This one seemed to have sobered him.</p>

  <p>His mother was up there in his room now, telling him for the hundredth
  time that he mustn't brood over this any more; that he wasn't to blame; that
  he didn't mean to do it; that he hadn't realized how fast he was going; that
  it wasn't his fault if the tyre was defective.</p>

  <p>Hannah wondered whether that sort of consolation was constructive. She
  doubted if it was even kind. If Wallie was having a thoughtful hour,
  observing himself as a heedless menace to other people's lives, surely his
  painful injuries had brought him a right to whatever benefit he might now
  derive from his self-inspection. Doubtless Marcia Ward was getting a measure
  of comfort out of the sweetly maternal murmurs she was bestowing. "There,
  there!" she was cooing, gently. "Now, now!" But what Wallie needed most was a
  chance to look himself over in private. The fact was that the comfort Marcia
  offered him wasn't effective because it wasn't true. Wallie always drove too
  fast and had liked to brag about it in the face of admonitions, police
  warnings, arrests; and on one humiliating occasion a whole night in gaol at
  Kankakee, where he had been gathered in too late for bail to be arranged.</p>

  <p>Tinkering up old cars and driving them like a demon had been so much more
  interesting than the University that he had dropped out in the middle of his
  senior year, and hadn't done anything profitable since, to Paul's chagrin,
  disgust, and sorrow. They had had many bitter words about it.</p>

  <p>"Leaving your own future out of it, that doesn't interest you," Paul had
  stormed, "how do you suppose it makes <i>me</i> look&mdash;a university
  dean&mdash;enforcing discipline on refractory students? I try to tell some
  impudent youngster that he is a worthless cub who deserves a spanking, and I
  know he is grinning inside and wishing he dared to say to me, 'Maybe you'd
  better trot off home and give your own cub a licking!'"</p>

  <p>Hannah sat inert, conscious of the endearing tones of Marcia's voice
  absolving Wallie of all blame and bidding him stop his worrying over
  something he couldn't help. She wished she had a right to say to Mrs Ward,
  "If Wallie is having a little session with himself, why interfere with it?"
  And for a while she pondered the subject. If Paul wanted to forgive Wallie
  and say, "That's all right, my boy. Don't fret any more. We'll both forget it
  now," he had every right to do so; but did Marcia have the right to step in
  between Wallie and his remorse? It was a nice little point and deserved a lot
  of thinking about. There was a good deal of that going on. So many people
  thought they were doing a service by saying to their remorseful friends in
  some crisis of their own concocting: "Do quit worrying about it! You couldn't
  help it! Don't torture yourself any further!" But what right had <i>they</i>
  to be offering absolution so cheerfully and cheaply? Wouldn't it be ever so
  much better to let people torture themselves into some valorous decision to
  make things right, if possible? Take Wallie's case, for example. The
  catastrophe he had caused might almost pay for itself if it demanded that he
  mend his ways and make a decisive right-about-face into a useful life.</p>

  <p>"A useful life!" whispered Hannah. "Dear Peter, I wish I could do
  something for <i>you</i>!... But maybe"&mdash;she reflected&mdash;"maybe
  Peter will be strong enough to resist this temptation." Then she shook her
  head hopelessly. What could you expect of a twenty-year-old boy confronted
  with an alluring offer like that?</p>

  <p>She returned to Thomas's letter.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Of course (he was saying now) I haven't said to Peter that
  he must choose between a fortune and a profession. I haven't cared to put it
  that way. But the fact remains that if Peter proposes to earn his own living,
  there seems no good reason why he should inherit a legacy. If he wants to
  provide for his own future, that is his privilege. In that case, however, I
  should be disposed to leave my money to some worthy institution. I should not
  take such action to compensate for my own disappointment, or to penalize
  Peter for failing to conform to my wishes; I should be doing it because I
  think it would be the right and just thing to do under the circumstances.
  Peter now has this momentous matter under consideration. Naturally he is a
  bit upset over the necessity for making a decision. I do not wish to press
  him too urgently, but the fact is that I am not growing any younger, and if
  we are to take this cruise we should do it now.</p>

  <p class="letter">Peter may or may not solicit your counsel. After all, it is
  a personal matter; and regardless of whatever influences are brought to bear
  on him, the decision will be more satisfactory to him in the long run if it
  is made without too much help. I do not intend to coax him. I have stated my
  proposition. It is now up to him to accept or decline. I have given him until
  June first to scrap it out with himself. It has occurred to me that it was
  only fair and sportsmanlike for me to give you this information.</p><br>

  <p>Hannah reviewed Lydia's letter. It said:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">I'm afraid you're going to be disturbed about this, Hannah.
  You've always been so keen on Peter's making a great name for himself. But
  really, if he had this fortune he might do more actual good with it than he
  could by working in chemistry. Anyhow, it seems a pretty big thing for a
  young fellow to throw away, doesn't it? Do write and tell me how you feel
  about it.</p><br>

  <p>It was easy to see how Lydia felt about it. Hannah could hardly hope for
  any assistance from that quarter. Was there anything she could do?</p>

  <p>Sally had been so fond of Peter. What would she be likely to think of the
  problem he was facing? Perhaps she wouldn't care very much now. She never
  talked about him any more. Of course that didn't mean that Sally had left off
  thinking about him. There had not been much opportunity for a confidential
  chat with Sally recently&mdash;not since she had gone East to college.</p>

  <p>Hannah often wondered whether she had done the right thing that day at
  Regent's Park when, glimpsing Peter on the elephant, she had impulsively
  decided to hustle Sally away before she too saw him. It was a cruel thing to
  do, but what else could she have done? She dared not risk a meeting that
  would involve not only a renewal of Peter's and Sally's friendship but an
  inevitable collision with Thomas also. No&mdash;too much heartache had
  already been invested in this dilemma. Hannah had cried herself to sleep that
  night. She had so longed to see Peter. She had felt traitorous, running away
  from him.</p>

  <p>It was noon now. Sally would be coming back presently. She had been over
  at the University Hospital since early morning. There was nothing she could
  do but sit in the tiny lounge a few feet from her father's door and anxiously
  watch the faces of the white-robed people who went through it. They would
  smile sympathetically into Sally's worried eyes as they passed. The young
  students would probably have errands in that neighbourhood, hopeful of an
  introduction. Sally was growing more beautiful every day. Her childish
  chubbiness was gone, and the round little face had ovalled, but the wide blue
  eyes and the yellow-gold hair and the deep dimples remained to remind Hannah
  of those enchanted days when, yearning for her own child, she had cuddled
  Sally close to her breast.</p>

  <p>Pauls' serious condition had been very hard on Sally. She had been
  summoned home from Northampton by an inexcusably frantic telegram. Mrs Ward
  had dictated it over the 'phone, and it was as shrilly hysterical as she
  herself. So Sally had gone through all the agonies of losing her father, that
  night, on her lonesome journey.</p>

  <p>Hannah glanced at the kitchen clock. Sally had telephoned at eleven to say
  there was no change. She would come home for luncheon, she said, though she
  wasn't hungry. Hannah had received the message and relayed it to Mrs Ward,
  who, having found it impossible to sit over there and be stared at when there
  wasn't anything she could do, had decided to give her time to Wallie this
  morning. Wallie, she declared, needed her more, just now, than Paul.</p>

  <p>The front door opened, and Sally came in softly and went on through to the
  kitchen. Hannah glanced up inquiringly. Even in her worry and weariness Sally
  was, she thought, the most charming creature she had ever seen.</p>

  <p>"Doctor Lansing says it's about fifty-fifty, Hannah. But oh, he looks so
  tired and drawn&mdash;and so little, too, as if he'd been sick for years."
  Sally laid her pale cheek against Hannah's. "I'm awfully afraid. I don't see
  how he can possibly get well."</p>

  <p>"Your father," said Hannah, steadying her voice, "has always been a very
  strong man, with a remarkable power to pull himself through all sorts of
  trouble."</p>

  <p>"But that's just it! He isn't pulling! He's too badly hurt to try."
  Sally's voice was breaking. "Even when he's fully conscious he acts as if he
  didn't care. I said that to Doctor Lansing and he thought so too. He said it
  would certainly help if Daddy had any interest in getting well. I tried to be
  cheerful&mdash;and encouraging&mdash;but he just smiled a little and shook
  his head. I'm afraid he has given it up. It's so unlike him, Hannah. That's
  what frightens me."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Mrs Ward and Sally had driven over to the hospital at about two-thirty.
  Hannah had promised she would go up to Wallie's room occasionally and see if
  he wanted anything. At three, she had taken him a glass of iced pineapple
  juice and some freshly made ginger-snaps. Wallie had been lying with his face
  to the wall, but turned his head disinterestedly when Hannah came in.</p>

  <p>"Something to drink, eh?" he muttered, trying to be gracious. "Put it down
  there, Hannah. I don't believe I want anything now."</p>

  <p>"Rather not talk?"</p>

  <p>Wallie shook his head.</p>

  <p>"There isn't much to talk about, is there?" he said dully. "Feeling pretty
  wormy to-day, Hannah."</p>

  <p>"That's encouraging," remarked Hannah dryly.</p>

  <p>Wallie drew a sour grin and muttered that she was a great comfort, to
  which Hannah replied, "I think I <i>could</i> be, if I had a chance."</p>

  <p>This seemed to stir his curiosity slightly, and he sat up in bed, wincing
  as he protected his broken arm. Hannah helped him stack up the pillows, and
  handed him the cold glass.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said, after he had drained it. "If you've something you
  want to say, Hannah, say it. You've a chance now. Perhaps you're wanting to
  tell me I'm no good. If that's it, you'll be wasting your time&mdash;for I
  know it."</p>

  <p>Hannah sat down on the edge of the bed and faced him with sober eyes.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to tell you a story, Wallie," she said, in the same tone she had
  often used when he was a child. "It's about yourself when you were a small
  boy."</p>

  <p>"That ought to be diverting. I was very good, I think, and showed a great
  deal of promise&mdash;when I was a boy."</p>

  <p>"Well, not always, and certainly not on the occasion I am thinking about."
  Hannah's eyes strayed to the window, and her reminiscence took on the mood of
  a soliloquy. "You had insisted on keeping up when you should have been in
  bed. It was one of the very bad colds you used to have. You were determined
  to go to a basketball game&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yeah, I remember; and had pneumonia and nearly died. I wish to God I
  had!"</p>

  <p>Hannah nodded a tentative agreement to this statement.</p>

  <p>"I've wondered, too," she said, reflectively, "several times, during this
  past year, whether the costly investment your father made in you, the night
  of the crisis in your pneumonia, was really worth all the thousands of
  dollars he was willing to risk on you; for you were so very sick
  that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Wallie's dull eyes widened and his lips parted inquiringly.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I heard about that," he growled. "Father didn't have
  thousands of dollars to risk on anything then, did he?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll tell you all about it. It's time you knew. You should have
  been told before. It might have saved your father's life&mdash;if you had
  known. Of course I don't know how much effect it might have had on you, but
  it might have been worth trying."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Wallie, frowning impatiently, "carry on!"</p>

  <p>Hannah quietly carried on. She told it all. There was no effort to
  dramatize it, no necessity for dramatizing it; the strange chronicle
  furnished its own dramatics. And it was a long story, too, prefaced by a
  prologue that recited Paul's desperate struggle to help himself out of debt,
  his discouraging work with the refrigerator, his happy completion of his
  task, his frantic rage when his rights to it were stolen. And then came the
  stirring tale of that night when, with his little boy's life hanging by a
  fragile thread, he had promised to give up his sole remaining chance to save
  his fortune in the hope that some power beyond himself might save his
  son.</p>

  <p>Wallie's eyes were cloudy when Hannah paused.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe in such stuff," he muttered.</p>

  <p>"Neither did he," said Hannah gently. "That, I think, was the brave part
  of it. He didn't put any faith in it. But your life was so precious that
  he&mdash;he took a chance&mdash;anyway."</p>

  <p>There was a long silence.</p>

  <p>"He never told me," said Wallie.</p>

  <p>"No, he wouldn't... It isn't the sort of thing people talk about very
  much&mdash;especially when they're well and everything is running
  normally."</p>

  <p>Wallie leaned forward attentively on his good elbow.</p>

  <p>"Do you think my father believes that his final success with his
  refrigerator was related to that affair?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, Wallie."</p>

  <p>"But you do think he got some sort of&mdash;what you call 'power' out of
  it that helped him to his success?"</p>

  <p>Hannah nodded.</p>

  <p>Wallie was thoughtful for a while. Then, his own part in the whole
  wretched tragedy sweeping over him, he closed his eyes tightly and shook his
  head as when a swimmer shakes the water out of his hair. Suddenly his eyes
  were suffused with tears.</p>

  <p>"Do you think he still has it?" he asked earnestly.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, dear. If he has, he may be too far gone to lay hold on
  it."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you go over there and talk to him, Hannah?" Wallie's tone was
  firm, commanding. "You know more about it than anyone else. You two
  understand each other. Go there and tell him he has simply got to take hold!
  Tell him!"</p>

  <p>Hannah shook her head slowly; then, looking him steadily in the eyes, she
  said: "I'm not the one to tell him. Wallie. It wouldn't rouse him, coming
  from me."</p>

  <p>Impetuously, and for all the world like Paul's impulsiveness in moments of
  stress, Wallie swept back the sheet with his sound arm, thrust a well-muscled
  leg over the edge of the bed, his face twisted with emotion.</p>

  <p>"Then, by God, <i>I'll</i> go and tell him!" he shouted. "Get me my
  clothes."</p>

  <p>Hannah had hastily risen to clear the way for this unexpected outburst.
  Standing before him, she laid an outspread hand firmly on his forehead,
  tipped it back, and searched his agitated eyes with a look that stilled
  him.</p>

  <p><i>"What</i> are you going to tell him?" she demanded huskily. "What do
  <i>you</i> know about the power your father found? Do you think it would help
  him for you to gallop into his room and make a scene, when you wouldn't know
  what to say to him, and wouldn't know what you were talking about?"</p>

  <p>Wallie's shoulders slumped and he hung his head dejectedly.</p>

  <p>"You're right, Hannah," he muttered. "It would be nothing but noisy
  impudence. I'm not the one to do it."</p>

  <p>Hannah sat down on the bed beside him and took his good hand in both of
  hers.</p>

  <p>"Whatever is said to your father, Wallie, must be spoken very quietly.
  This power we have been talking about is not boisterous. You don't shout it
  at people. He wouldn't recognize it if you brought it to him that way."</p>

  <p>There was a long pause.</p>

  <p>"I wonder"&mdash;Wallie turned to face Hannah contritely&mdash;"I wonder
  if it would do any good if I went over there and said, quietly, so as not to
  upset him, 'If you'll only get well, I'll go back to school and&mdash;and try
  to pay up for what you did for me when <i>I</i> was sick'."</p>

  <p>Hannah's sudden intake of breath sounded like a sob.</p>

  <p>"I think he'd like that, Wallie," she said brokenly.</p>

  <p>"That would make him know I was in earnest&mdash;about wanting him to get
  well, wouldn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and it would be a comfort to him." Hannah hesitated for a
  moment. "Now, if you were able to go just one step farther with that, you
  might make him think of his power."</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Hannah, I'll do <i>anything!"</i></p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;don't dicker with Them. They might not like it. Come the whole
  way with your promise. Burn all your bridges! He did that for
  <i>you!"</i></p>

  <p>Wallie's fingers tightened on her hand.</p>

  <p>"Very well, Hannah," he said firmly, "I'll tell him that no matter what
  happens I'm going back to college, and I'm going to play the game straight
  with him from now on&mdash;whether he lives to see me do it, or not!"</p>

  <p>Hannah lifted his hand and pressed it hard against her breast, then laid
  her wet cheek against it caressingly. There was a long moment of silence.
  Then, dashing the tears from her eyes, she rose, walked steadily to the
  wardrobe, opened the door, and turning, said, "What suit do you want to
  wear?"</p>

  <p>"You mean you want me to go?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Hannah. "You're the one to tell him."</p>

  <p>"You think he'll know what I'm talking about?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and he'll know that <i>you know</i> what you're talking
  about."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Sally was starting back to Northampton on the eleven o'clock train. It was
  eight now. Hannah had been helping her with the packing. The door stood open.
  Mrs Ward, tenderly solicitous, fluttered in occasionally to show her
  interest, and restlessly fluttered out again to keep company with Wallie in
  his room across the hall.</p>

  <p>Upon each of her returns to him, Wallie dutifully put aside his
  mathematics and the drawing-board&mdash;he was working hard to take a
  calculus examination that he had flunked while in process of completing his
  education two years ago&mdash;and greeted her with an amiable smile.</p>

  <p>Marcia couldn't quite make Wallie out. Of course it was to be expected
  that Paul's definite improvement would take a heavy load off Wallie's heart.
  He had been so remorseful. Indeed Marcia had worried more than she liked to
  admit to herself over the ghastly possibility of his impulsively destroying
  himself. Now that his father had taken a new lease on life, Wallie's dour
  mood would be lifted. Doubtless in a day or two he would resume his normal
  habits of thought, a half-cynical, half-flippant attitude which, while it
  exasperated her at times, was ever so much better than his recent state of
  sullen self-scourging.</p>

  <p>But the Wallie who had risen from his sackcloth and ashes upon the
  announcement that his father would recover was a new Wallie with whom Marcia
  had had no previous acquaintance. The adolescent cockiness and bravado seemed
  to have been suddenly outgrown. Her pampered boy had become a man.</p>

  <p>The kinks in Marcia's world were straightening out. Paul was going to get
  well. Wallie was going back to school. In spite of her satisfaction, however,
  the Paul she had recovered seemed changed somehow; and as for Wallie, she was
  almost shy in his presence. Suddenly remembering something she must do,
  Marcia would leave his room, presently darting back again to see if she knew
  him any better.</p>

  <p>As for the interview Wallie had had with his father, she knew nothing more
  than that the boy had made some promises and Paul had reacted favourably to
  them. Now Paul wanted to be well again, and Wallie wanted to mend his
  conduct. All this was natural enough. But it had done something to both of
  them that wasn't quite explained by the simple facts in the case. They both
  seemed so thoughtful, so uncannily alike in their quiet seriousness. Marcia
  wondered if they were going to remain that way; and if so, whether she was
  going to understand them and like them as much as before. It was as if they
  had seen the same ghost, and it had laid the same tranquillizing finger on
  their lips.</p>

  <p>"Is your calculus interesting?" asked Marcia.</p>

  <p>"No," admitted Wallie, "I can't say that it is. I'm not studying it
  because I like it, but because I have to pass an examination in it."</p>

  <p>"I think colleges are silly," said Marcia sympathetically. "The idea of
  making people learn things they don't want to know&mdash;just to accumulate a
  required number of credits!"</p>

  <p>Wallie grinned.</p>

  <p>"Hannah says a little drudgery is good for you," he drawled.</p>

  <p>"Well, Hannah ought to know," observed Marcia, daintily dealing with a
  yawn. "She's had plenty of it. You and Hannah," she added, after a pause,
  "have become quite well acquainted lately. Whatever do you find to talk
  about&mdash;her hobby, maybe?"</p>

  <p>"Peace, and that sort of thing, you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;letting people use you for a doormat."</p>

  <p>"Quite the contrary. Hannah likes to talk about good, hard, stern
  discipline. She's an odd number, Mother. She thinks people ought to deal very
  gently with everybody but themselves. I rather fancy she wears a hair shirt
  herself."</p>

  <p>"Maybe. She never told me. Hannah keeps her own counsel better than anyone
  I ever met. I know little more about her past than she told me the first
  afternoon she came to us&mdash;when you were four. Perhaps she has told your
  father about herself. I don't know. They have always seemed to understand
  each other&mdash;rather better, I have sometimes felt, than I have understood
  either of them."</p>

  <p>"I guess you and Dad understand each other, all right," consoled Wallie.
  "I think I understand him, too, a little better than ever before. He's a
  wonderful person, you know. There's a lot to him that doesn't show up on the
  surface. But of course you know that."</p>

  <p>Marcia nodded, and wondered what Wallie was talking about. Paul was an
  open book. You could read his thoughts at a thousand yards. That had been one
  of his troubles, his inability to keep his plans to himself. She smiled.</p>

  <p>"Well," she remarked knowingly, "I never thought of your father as a
  deeply secretive person. He mighty nearly ruined himself one time, offering
  confidences to a man who was almost a stranger&mdash;that Ellis
  person&mdash;the one who stole his first refrigerator... and then he just
  backed down and let the fellow make off with it. There wasn't anything very
  deep about that. No&mdash;one of your father's chief charms has been his
  boyish enthusiasms. They have got him into trouble a few times, but I'd much
  rather see him that way than&mdash;than mysterious."</p>

  <p>"Hannah thinks it's a pretty good thing for a person to have a few little
  tricks tucked away."</p>

  <p>Marcia chuckled, and pursed her lips half derisively.</p>

  <p>"Like the smart fellow in the advertisement who studied French privately
  and amazed his girl by parley-vousing glibly at a restaurant?"</p>

  <p>Wallie laughed. "Hannah would have the fellow study French privately, I
  think, and then do all his parley-vousing without an audience."</p>

  <p>"I call that smug selfishness," said Marcia impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Well, Hannah believes in selfishness&mdash;of a sort. She thinks it's
  more important to be concerned about your relation to yourself than your
  relation to anyone else."</p>

  <p>"Including members of your own household, I presume."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Wallie, "including them, too."</p>

  <p>Marcia smiled a bit reproachfully into Wallie's eyes.</p>

  <p>"I hope you're not going to adopt that programme. Wallie, and&mdash;and
  leave <i>me</i> out." Marcia wished she hadn't said it. She had implied her
  observation of a change in his general attitude, and now had solicited an
  explanation which he might not wish to make. She hoped it would not cause any
  constraint between them. Wallie had made no response. So, finding the
  conversation perilously perched high and dry, with the tide going out, Marcia
  said she would run over and see how Sally was getting on with her packing.
  Finding the door closed, she went on downstairs slowly, feeling suddenly
  lonesome. Strolling to the kitchen, she halved a large grapefruit,
  painstakingly dug out the seeds, found two plates and spoons, and returned to
  Wallie, resolved to avoid the theme that had closed, unsatisfactorily, on a
  diminished seventh. As she passed Sally's door she heard the quiet murmur of
  Hannah's voice, and wished she knew what they were talking about.</p>

  <p>"Brought you something, darling," she said brightly.</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Marcia." Once in a great while he called her that and it made her
  almost foolishly happy.</p>

  <p>"I'll kiss you for that," she said&mdash;and did.</p>

  <p>"You're very pretty," said Wallie softly, which made everything all right
  again for Marcia. Wallie hadn't escaped her, after all.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>"You needn't have bothered to press that old foulard, Hannah," Sally was
  saying. "I haven't been wearing it anywhere but in my room."</p>

  <p>"I love this new white satin gown. It's exquisite." Hannah caressed it
  with finger-tips that were slightly dismayed over their roughness.</p>

  <p>"So do I, Hannah," Sally's tone was very tender. "Special reasons," she
  added, giving Hannah a comradely wink.</p>

  <p>"Wore it to a party, I suppose, where you found a very nice boy. Is that
  what you're trying to say? Want to tell me about him&mdash;or is it too sweet
  a secret?"</p>

  <p>Sally strolled across to the door and quietly closed it.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it really is too sweet a secret, and I want to tell you about him.
  First of all, he is a sophomore at New Haven." Sally paused and met Hannah's
  eyes soberly enough, but inwardly amused a little over her expression of
  sudden interest. "He has dark hair that must have been quite curly when he
  was a little boy, and rather deep-set grey eyes. He is tall and athletic.
  There is a deep cleft between his lower lip and his chin, and when he smiles
  his lips have a funny little pucker as if he had thought of something more
  than he didn't intend you to know. And when he looks at you
  sideways&mdash;like this&mdash;quite seriously, you wonder if he approves of
  you, and just as you're beginning to feel a little annoyed over this frank
  examination, and maybe are about to say, 'So what?' as saucily as you can,
  his lips pucker into that smile again that does things to your breathing. And
  the worst part of it is that you can't keep him from knowing about it. At
  least you feel that he does, and that doesn't help you any. But we haven't
  said a word."</p>

  <p>"Why, Sally!" murmured Hannah. "Imagine your falling in love. You're only
  a child." She sat down in a low chair, still holding the party dress folded
  across her arms. "I thought it was odd your bringing this gown along when
  there wouldn't be any use for it. Wanted to be able to look at it
  occasionally; was that it?"</p>

  <p>Sally nodded, and sank down on the cushion beside Hannah's chair.</p>

  <p>"Partly," she confessed shyly. "And partly because I wanted to show it to
  you." She slowly traced a pattern on Hannah's knee.</p>

  <p>"That's sweet," said Hannah unsteadily. "I suppose this boy will be seeing
  you now, every chance he gets."</p>

  <p>Sally's eyes were downcast as she continued to follow the little design on
  Hannah's dress with a nervous forefinger.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid not," she said demurely. "I think he means to go away&mdash;to
  be gone for a long time."</p>

  <p>Hannah swallowed hard and hoped her heart wasn't pounding so Sally could
  feel the beat of it.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen him often?" she asked huskily</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And now he's going away?"</p>

  <p>"He says he's afraid he can't do otherwise."</p>

  <p>"And you think he loves you?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Sally slowly, "I don't think he does&mdash;or he wouldn't
  go"</p>

  <p>"But of course you couldn't say that to him."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;certainly <i>not!</i> He hasn't said anything that would give me
  a right to object to his going&mdash;clear to Timbuctoo&mdash;and staying for
  ever!" Sally laid her cheek against Hannah's knee.</p>

  <p>Marcia tapped lightly on the door now, and came in to inquire how they
  were getting on, and could she do anything? It was nearly time for Sally to
  go.</p>

  <p>Hannah went downstairs to call a taxi, and Sally presently joined her in
  the kitchen. She seemed to have something important on her mind. Slipping an
  arm around Hannah, she said confidentially, "Do you know that Peter was in
  London when we were, and saw us at Regent's Park, and lost us in the
  crowd?"</p>

  <p>For an instant Hannah hesitated, debating a reply.</p>

  <p>"Peter was riding the elephant," Sally went on. "He saw us and as soon as
  he could he set out to find us. Hannah, I remember how flustered you were,
  and how anxious you seemed to get away from there. Tell me truly&mdash;did
  you see Peter?"</p>

  <p>Hannah nodded, without looking up.</p>

  <p>"Why did you do that, Hannah?" Sally's tone was very serious.</p>

  <p>"Because&mdash;because I thought it ever so much better if you and Peter
  didn't see each other any more."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I can't tell you."</p>

  <p>There was a momentary silence.</p>

  <p>"I've always felt that you would rather we kept apart, and I've often
  wondered why. You are so fond of Peter, and I think you are of me, too."</p>

  <p>"Maybe that's the reason, Sally."</p>

  <p>There was another pause.</p>

  <p>"But it wasn't you who kept Peter's letters from me; I know that,
  Hannah... Please tell me it wasn't you."</p>

  <p>"No, dear."</p>

  <p>"You're not offended&mdash;my asking?"</p>

  <p>"No, I'm glad you asked, so I could tell you." Hannah drew Sally close to
  her, and lowering her voice almost to a whisper said: "If I were you, I would
  try now to forget all about Peter. He's a dear boy, and I don't blame you for
  liking him, but&mdash;Sally, you mustn't count on him now."</p>

  <p>"How do you mean, Hannah&mdash;I mustn't count on him?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it's just a bit hard to say, for I love him very much, but I'm
  afraid that Peter isn't going to amount to anything after all."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was an unexpectedly gorgeous Sunday morning in mid-May,
  the first really warm day of the season. Yesterday there had been a chilly
  rain and Peter had feared their visit would have to occur indoors where there
  might be small opportunity for the confidential talk he wanted to have with
  Sally. This morning's blue sky and sunshine furnished a pleasant
  surprise.</p>

  <p>The sporty grey coupé which Uncle Thomas had given him on his last
  birthday industriously but quietly devoured the miles, levelled the hills,
  and straightened the curves on the scenic road to Northampton, where, in a
  little downtown park, Sally would be waiting at noon sharp for his arrival.
  It had been a month since he had seen her.</p>

  <p>A sudden inspiration had descended on Peter. It was an ideal day for a
  picnic. That would be ever so much more fun than a dingy booth in some
  wayside halt swarming with holiday motorists. There were a few things on his
  mind which could be discussed more satisfyingly out in the open. It had been
  difficult to have an uninterrupted talk with Sally.</p>

  <p>Pausing at a delicatessen shop in Hartford, he picked up the makings of an
  out-of-doors lunch. Sally would probably laugh when she unwrapped the things
  he had bought&mdash;the leather-bound edition of a roasted chicken, a
  dismaying quantity of big dill pickles, a huge bag of potato-chips, and a
  bottle of olives which he suspected would have to be opened like champagne as
  the christening of a ship.</p>

  <p>Stowing his purchases, Peter resumed his journey, the balmy breeze
  swirling about him in the open car and tipping up the flat brim of his soft
  grey hat after the manner of Napoleon's. But he did not feel much like
  Napoleon. His perplexities of the past few weeks had done something to his
  spirits. He was aware that this was a golden day and he knew he ought to be
  very happy, for he was going to see Sally, but he wished he might meet her in
  a less perturbed state of mind. It might be the last time they would meet for
  a couple of years, and who knew what might happen in the meantime? Certainly
  he was in no position to put in a claim to Sally, but to take the risk of
  letting someone else make off with her, while he was indolently ship-ahoying
  on the other side of the globe, was unthinkable. He had already tossed and
  fretted enough at night, worrying over his present problems, to realize what
  life would amount to, in far-away waters, brooding over the probability that
  he had lost her.</p>

  <p>It wasn't quite fair to be confronted, at his age, with the fateful
  decision Uncle Thomas had asked him to make. The majority of his classmates
  had no definite ideas about the professional courses they might elect and
  felt under no compulsion to declare what roads they meant to travel. Uncle
  Thomas wanted him to say, within the next six weeks, whether his proposal
  would be accepted. Begging for more time, Peter had wangled a small
  concession out of him, as to the date, but it mustn't be later than July
  first; for the yacht was ready, the crew already signed up, and Uncle Thomas
  restlessly pacing about, tugging his short moustache, and watching for the
  postman.</p>

  <p>Of course, Uncle Thomas had meant it all in the kindest possible way, and
  for that affection and generosity one must be deeply grateful. He had counted
  on this round-the-world voyage with such earnest expectation that it would be
  almost a crime to disappoint him. Uncle Thomas was the sort of person you
  wanted to humour in all his whims. He was such a helpless, pathetically
  lonesome creature, with not one interest in life except his devotion to
  Peter. It did no good to reflect hotly that Uncle Thomas was taking
  altogether too much for granted when he bought that yacht for the express
  purpose of the cruise, without consulting Peter's wishes. No&mdash;Uncle
  Thomas mustn't be hurt. You simply had to do what he wanted even if it ran
  counter to your own best interests.</p>

  <p>Examining his motives, Peter honestly believed it was this sense of duty
  to requite Uncle Thomas for his devotion that was driving him to an
  acceptance of the proposal. To be sure, it was&mdash;as his mother had
  written&mdash;no small matter to throw away a fortune. But he felt very sure
  that it would have been easier to forgo the promised legacy than endure the
  thought that he had proved himself ungrateful and inconsiderate of Uncle
  Thomas's feelings.</p>

  <p>The grey coupé insisted on passing a big truck on a hill; then, thinking
  better of it, lagged behind and loitered all the way up until the crest was
  reached and the coast was clear. Peter, suddenly free to speed on his way,
  wished the visibility on his problem would similarly lengthen and show him
  the road. That was the trouble: you couldn't estimate the future
  possibilities of your choice in this thing, no matter how you chose. Had it
  been a clean-cut decision between pleasure and duty, it might be easier to
  handle. But the duty part of it was not very urgent. He felt under no strong
  obligation to prepare himself for chemical engineering. Nobody had asked him
  to, not even his mother. She would be pleased, for sentimental reasons. But
  the fact that his father, whom he couldn't remember, had been a chemist, did
  not demand his taking to the same profession. And he wasn't even sure that he
  had any marked talent for it. He liked chemistry above all other subjects,
  but one might work in a laboratory for a lifetime without accomplishing
  anything very important. No&mdash;it was just one of those awkward problems
  that you couldn't deal with spiritedly. It offered no challenge, either one
  way or the other.</p>

  <p>Peter glanced at the clock and reduced his speed to forty-five. There was
  plenty of time. But it was difficult to idle along. One felt oneself under
  severe time-pressure, these days. You had a decision to make
  promptly&mdash;promptly!</p>

  <p>Naturally, Sally would think it quite dreadful for him to quit college
  now. There had been no chance to talk about it seriously. He had told her of
  Uncle Thomas's proposed cruise, and she had simply said, "How interesting!"
  Brought up in a professor's family, Sally would undoubtedly feel that a
  failure to finish one's course was next thing to a tragedy; or would she? It
  might be interesting to find out how strongly she felt on the subject.</p>

  <p>He devoutly wished he knew exactly where he stood with Sally. That might
  help him to a decision. It was clear enough that she liked him. They were
  thoroughly congenial. But, so far as he could see, their warm
  comradeship&mdash;in her own regard&mdash;was nothing more than a
  continuation of the childhood friendliness that had lapsed through no fault
  of their own.</p>

  <p>If only she hadn't been so blandly, guilelessly forthright in her attitude
  towards him! When she introduced him to her friends, you would have thought
  he was her brother. Even on the occasion of that first meeting, after they
  had been separated for so long&mdash;that purely accidental meeting at the
  tennis tournament in Boston&mdash;she had held his hand tightly in both of
  hers and, smiling up into his eyes, had exclaimed, <i>"Peter!</i> I thought I
  would never see you or hear from you again." There hadn't been anything coy
  or shy about it.</p>

  <p>Late that afternoon she had insisted on his joining her party of half a
  dozen, presenting him to them without the slightest trace of bashfulness or
  diffidence, and when she left&mdash;the Northamptonians were taking an early
  evening train&mdash;she said, "Will you answer my letters now, Peter, if I
  write to you?"</p>

  <p>"I like <i>that,"</i> he had countered, "after the way you let me
  down."</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;you did write to me, Peter?" she asked soberly.</p>

  <p>"Of course! Dozens! You didn't get them?"</p>

  <p>"Sorry, Peter."</p>

  <p>"But they were sent to your home address, Sally."</p>

  <p>And then Peter had been on the point of inquiring if anyone was living
  there who might not want them to write to each other, but decided that this
  wasn't the time or place to introduce so delicate a subject. Besides, it was
  time for her to go.</p>

  <p>Next day he had written to her. It was the beginning of a correspondence
  that had delighted him, and perplexed him, too; for Sally's candid interest
  in him was so open and above-board that he felt she would be amazed if she
  knew his own sensations in regard to her. She was his grown-up playmate; that
  was all.</p>

  <p>Then there had been the sophomore party at Northampton, with Sally showing
  him off to her friends, her arm slipped through his companionably, her
  fingers tightening on his sleeve, her wide blue eyes beaming up at him as
  artlessly as if she were his twin sister! She couldn't have the slightest
  speck of romantic affection for him&mdash;and do that!</p>

  <p>Thinking it all over, late that night, he pictured himself taking Sally
  out of the crowd and saying tenderly, "I think you're a darling! I think
  you're the most wonderful girl in the world!" And then Sally would
  unquestionably reply, without a bit of restraint, "I'm so glad, Peter. I
  think you're wonderful, too. Isn't it fun to be together?"</p>

  <p>Then there had been another party when he had actually contrived a moment
  alone with her, conscious that his heart was beating loud enough to be heard
  and finding his voice unsteady when he spoke to her.</p>

  <p>"You look simply stunning to-night, Sally," he had said, and she had
  replied instantly, "I hoped you would like me in this dress, Peter. It's the
  nicest one I ever had. Makes me look tall, don't you think?"</p>

  <p>It did make her look tall, but that wasn't half of it. The white satin
  gown modelled every lovely curve adorably. Sally didn't seem to know
  that.</p>

  <p>"I like my new shoes, too," she added, naïvely inviting his inspection as
  if he might have been her mother. <i>That,</i> reflected Peter, later, was
  the hell of it. She was so deucedly innocent and ingenuous. She took him for
  granted. Their relationship was the same as when they had played the hotly
  contested game of tennis on the school court in Waterloo. To Sally, he was
  still that boy with the friendly dog and the limping rabbits.</p>

  <p>Sometimes he grinned when he thought of the astonishment she might display
  in her startled eyes if he were to blurt out, suddenly, "You belong to me and
  I want you! Do you understand? I want you for mine&mdash;for ever!" That
  would be something different, something that had never crossed her mind. He
  would not be surprised if she winced, and pressed the backs of her fingers
  hard against her pretty mouth, and replied thickly, "Oh, Peter&mdash;you've
  spoiled everything! Why, my <i>dear,</i> I never thought of you that
  way!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>She ran out to the kerb, slammed the door that he had opened for her,
  slipped over very close beside him, and said softly, "Isn't it going to be a
  lark?"</p>

  <p>"It's worse than that," warned Peter, with a sidelong wink. "We're having
  a picnic."</p>

  <p>"On what?"</p>

  <p>"I brought some stuff along."</p>

  <p>"How wonderful!"</p>

  <p>"Better wait till you see it.... How did you leave your father?"</p>

  <p>"He's getting well. It will take some time. Wallie's going back to the
  University has bucked him up a lot. Daddy's so elated. But I wrote you that.
  Thanks for all the nice letters.... I know just the place for our picnic,
  Peter. Carry on until I tell you where to turn."</p>

  <p>"How was Aunt Hannah?"</p>

  <p>"Fit as a fiddle&mdash;except she doesn't want you to go cruising. She is
  fretting about it, a little. You know she takes a tremendous interest in
  everything you do. She wishes you wouldn't give up college."</p>

  <p>"I know&mdash;but she doesn't understand. Aunt Hannah"&mdash;Peter
  hesitated, not quite sure what he had intended to say&mdash;"doesn't
  understand."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I don't suppose you need to worry about what she thinks," said
  Sally comfortingly. "It's your own affair. It isn't quite the same as if she
  were your really truly aunt. In that case&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But she is, you know," contradicted Peter, eyes steadily on the busy
  road. "What made you think she wasn't?"</p>

  <p>"Because she told me," said Sally casually, "and I don't think she meant
  it as a secret. She said that she and your mother had just taught you to call
  her 'aunt' when you were a child. I should have thought you knew, by this
  time."</p>

  <p>The grey coupé had slackened speed until it was barely moving. Peter
  turned to face Sally with bewildered eyes.</p>

  <p>"But that can't be true!" he declared soberly. "You see, it's her being my
  aunt that explains everything about Uncle Thomas&mdash;and what he is doing
  for me." Peter drew the car to the side of the road, turned off the motor,
  and proceeded with his story. "I had expected to tell you all this, anyway.
  It clears up a lot of things. It will help you understand how I'm fixed. When
  I was in Paris, I learned accidentally that Uncle Thomas really <i>is</i> my
  uncle. And that accounts for everything he wants to do for me. My Aunt
  Hannah, once upon a time, was his <i>wife."</i></p>

  <p>"Peter! Are you sure? Did you ask him?"</p>

  <p>"No," he muttered, rather reluctantly. "Uncle Thomas hadn't told me about
  it and I didn't like to worry him with questions. He isn't the sort of person
  you feel free to examine about his own business."</p>

  <p>"You could have asked your mother," suggested Sally, in a tone of gentle
  reproof. "Surely she would tell you anything you want to know about it."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I suppose you would think that, Sally." Peter's face registered
  uncertainty about the reasonableness of what he was going to say. "But it's
  this way. Ever since I can remember, my mother and my Aunt Hannah have had a
  lot to talk about that apparently didn't concern me, at all. When I was a
  little boy, they used to sit and talk by the hour in low tones. I never
  thought there was anything strange about it. It was grown-up conversation
  that I wouldn't understand. In fact, I think it pleased me that my mother and
  my aunt were so devoted to each other, and I knew they were to me. There were
  plenty of things that adults had to say to one another that small children
  weren't expected to know. If Aunt Hannah and Mother had secrets, there wasn't
  anything unnatural about that."</p>

  <p>"And so you never asked any questions," observed Sally
  comprehendingly.</p>

  <p>Peter gave a little shrug and grinned.</p>

  <p>"There weren't any I wanted to ask, really. I think the first time I ever
  felt any curiosity about Aunt Hannah was when I found out that she worked at
  your house."</p>

  <p>"And I told you that," murmured Sally self-reproachfully. "I was awfully
  sorry, Peter. I'm always talking first&mdash;and thinking afterwards. And now
  I've done it again to-day, it seems. But I don't see why you should be kept
  in the dark about your own family relationships. That isn't quite fair!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe not. But it is just as I told you, Sally. I was brought up in an
  atmosphere pretty heavily charged with secrets. I assumed that the same thing
  was true with all children. I was discouraged from asking questions. And even
  now I hesitate to prod into my Aunt Hannah's story. There seems to be no
  doubt about her having been the wife of Uncle Thomas. They separated and he
  married again. It was his second wife who told me."</p>

  <p>Sally wondered how she had happened to do that, and Peter told her the
  circumstances in considerable detail.</p>

  <p>"What a horrible woman!" exclaimed Sally. "She must have had a lot of
  brass."</p>

  <p>"That's one reason I couldn't get up the courage to say anything to Uncle
  Thomas about the incident. I felt he'd probably had enough trouble with her.
  I didn't want to worry him with any mention of her&mdash;a quite killable
  creature."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps what she told you was untrue."</p>

  <p>"I think&mdash;" Peter deliberated for an instant. "I think I wanted to
  believe her&mdash;after the first shock of it, for it cleared up Uncle
  Thomas's affectionate interest in me. I gathered that he hoped to square with
  Aunt Hannah by befriending her nephew&mdash;his nephew, too, by marriage....
  And now it seems that I'm not his nephew, or Aunt Hannah's, either. The whole
  thing is very queer."</p>

  <p>Sally impulsively laid a hand on his arm and gave it a playful little
  push.</p>

  <p>"Then I think we had better forget it and have our picnic," she advised
  maternally. "It's this next country road to the left, Peter. There's a lovely
  pond and a grove, and maybe we will find some trilliums. Let's stop fretting
  about your Aunt Hannah."</p>

  <p>"But she isn't my Aunt Hannah, after all. That puts everything groggy
  again." Peter mechanically snapped the ignition on, spun the engine, and
  slipped in the gears. "What business has Uncle Thomas&mdash;making me his
  heir&mdash;if Aunt Hannah is no relation of mine?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe he likes you," suggested Sally gently. "I don't see how he could
  help it, really."</p>

  <p>Peter regarded her fleetingly with one of his oddly pursed smiles.</p>

  <p>"You like to spoof me, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not spoofing. If I were a man, like Uncle Thomas, and had no
  dependants and a million dollars, I'd give it all to you, Peter&mdash;just
  because you're so nice."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Sally," he said dryly, expectant of some whimsical rejoinder.
  Upon her failure to reply to this, he glanced towards her with a
  half-reproving smile and encountered eyes that seemed sincere. "Poker face!"
  he grumbled. "You ought to grin when you say things like that." He chuckled a
  little, and pretended a warning look. "Some time you'll tease me and
  I'll&mdash;I might take you seriously."</p>

  <p>"And then what?" inquired Sally lightly. "Box my ears?"</p>

  <p>"Which way do we go from here?" asked Peter, slowing down as a fork in the
  road approached.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I don't know," said Sally, half to herself. Then, suddenly
  attentive, "Oh&mdash;it's the one to the right, Peter. Not very far now. Over
  this little hill.... Don't be so serious, old owl. We're going on a
  picnic."</p>

  <p>"Was I so serious?" growled Peter.</p>

  <p>Sally nodded.</p>

  <p>"And funny, too," she added cryptically.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean&mdash;witty."</p>

  <p>"No," said Sally&mdash;"just funny."</p>

  <p>They drove on in silence for a little while, Peter attentive to the narrow
  road which had deteriorated to a mere grassy lane.</p>

  <p>"Cute hat," remarked Peter, after a brief appraising glance. "The pink
  ribbon brings out the blue in your eyes."</p>

  <p>"You're growing quite observing, little one," remarked Sally. "Fancy your
  knowing I have blue eyes!"</p>

  <p>"I like the pink sweater too," he continued courageously. "It fits you so
  well. I mean," he amended quickly&mdash;"it suits you exactly."</p>

  <p>"Then I'll wear it&mdash;always," she declared, "just for you."</p>

  <p>"Better remember what I told you," warned Peter, "about teasing
  me&mdash;with a straight face."</p>

  <p>"There it is, Peter! Isn't that lovely?" The placid little lake had
  suddenly come into view. "And only two cars. We'll have the place almost to
  ourselves."</p>

  <p>"Will you like that?" Peter heard himself saying, a bit unsteadily.</p>

  <p>"Of course! What a silly question!"</p>

  <p>Peter drew a deep sigh, gave her what he felt was a good imitation of a
  brotherly smile, and drawled, "Yes&mdash;it was, rather; wasn't it?"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>He sat, arms clasping his knees; and, at her request, making no move to
  help her unwrap the packages containing their luncheon. Seated there beside
  her on the steamer-rug, Peter was stirred to a feeling of inexpressible
  tenderness for Sally as she busied herself with the occupation that accented
  her womanhood, her potential wifehood. As he watched her pretty hands
  competently preparing the food he had brought, the act seemed to symbolize a
  natural bond between them. Peter wondered if such a thought had occurred to
  her, too, but doubted it.</p>

  <p>"Had you any plans," she asked, "for demobilizing this chicken?"</p>

  <p>"Let's be savages," said Peter, "and tear it to pieces with our bare
  hands."</p>

  <p>She passed it to him.</p>

  <p>"You do it, Peter. You're much more savage than I am."</p>

  <p>"Was I cross?" he asked, proceeding to dismember the chicken.</p>

  <p>"N-no&mdash;just glum&mdash;and remote."</p>

  <p>"I was thinking, Sally. I've a lot to think about. I'm going away."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;you're not going to-day. Let's enjoy ourselves together, this
  once more. Do tell me all about this cruise, Peter."</p>

  <p>Half-heartedly, he repeated what Uncle Thomas had said about their voyage,
  south to the Canal and into the Pacific; south, again, touching at Guayaquil,
  Callao, Iquique, Valparaiso, and on to Desolation Island&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Desolation Island sounds quite jolly. I suppose you'll be desolating
  there about the time of the tennis match in Forest Hills. We'll miss you,
  Peter.... Well&mdash;please go on. Then, from Desolation Island you sail
  to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"New Zealand. It's a long haul, too, forty-five hundred miles; and then to
  Sydney, and then down to Tasmania&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't like your going to Tasmania, Peter. I've heard the girls down
  there are so forward. By the way, how do you happen to be missing Tahiti? If
  I were a boy with nothing to do but cruise around with my uncle,
  I'd&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Peter gave her a reproachful look.</p>

  <p>"You're saying it the worst way, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"What would you like to have me do, Peter?" She lifted sober eyes, and
  then smiled a little. "You aren't hoping I'll try to make your trip sound
  glamorous, are you? That would seem as if I really wanted you to go."</p>

  <p>"And you don't?" he asked, so wistfully that it made Sally laugh.</p>

  <p>"Of course not, stupid!" Then, suddenly serious, she added pensively:
  "I'll be quite lost without you, Peter. We've been friends so long. Even when
  we were not hearing from each other, I knew we should meet again some time
  and play together. But now you're going so far and to be gone so long. I'll
  be awfully lonely."</p>

  <p>He glanced up to study her face. There was no question about the sincerity
  of what she was saying, but&mdash;<i>"play</i> together." That was her
  thought. They wouldn't be able to play together any more. Just good chums,
  that's what they were.</p>

  <p>"So many things might happen, Peter, in two years," she was
  continuing.</p>

  <p>"I know," he ventured. "You might fall in love with somebody and be
  married. And then we couldn't play together any more, without dragging the
  other fellow along." He tried to make this sound amusing, but Sally's smile
  was not spontaneous.</p>

  <p>"Peter, dear"&mdash;her voice was self-consciously unsteady&mdash;"I
  <i>am</i> in love."</p>

  <p>For an instant her confession fairly sickened him. It was as if he had
  been struck a sudden blow. Then, realizing the implications of any delay to
  felicitate her, he attempted a comradely smile, and said, "I'm glad you
  wanted to tell me, Sally."</p>

  <p>"I didn't want to really," she admitted, with averted eyes. "It wasn't
  easy to do."</p>

  <p>"It shouldn't have been so hard to tell <i>me,"</i> muttered Peter.
  "Almost like telling your brother.... College fellow, I suppose."</p>

  <p>Sally nodded, and began gathering up the fragments of their luncheon.</p>

  <p>"Just finishing," she said, casually enough.</p>

  <p>"But he'll let you complete your course, won't he?" demanded Peter, his
  tone imputing a large selfishness to this unworthy beggar, whoever he
  was.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," said Sally, without looking up. "We haven't begun to think
  about marriage. He's not in a position to make any plans."</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;money?"</p>

  <p>Sally nodded; then, swiftly abandoning her reflective mood, she glanced
  up, smiled, scrambled to her feet, and said, "Enough on that, Peter! Let's
  run down to the lake and pretend it's a finger-bowl."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The trip back to Northampton was distinguished for the long pauses in
  their conversation. Most of the talk was done by Peter who seemed anxious to
  justify himself in Sally's eyes.</p>

  <p>One little incident, as they were leaving their picnic ground, had
  temporarily confused them both. It had been a full five minutes afterwards
  before either of them could think of anything sufficiently casual to disguise
  the emotion suddenly stirred.</p>

  <p>The air was growing chilly. Peter had asked Sally, when they were making
  ready to start, if she was warm enough, and she had confessed a wish that she
  had brought a coat. Unlocking the back deck of the coupé, Peter drew out a
  camel's hair overcoat and invited her to slip into it. She turned, held out
  her arms, and he put it on her. His hands touched her neck and lingered there
  for a moment. Then, without releasing her, he drew her around until she faced
  him. For a moment he held the lapels of the coat close to her throat, with a
  pressure that couldn't possibly have been mistaken for anything but a caress.
  Sally looked up steadily into his eyes, and smiled. And he smiled into hers.
  His heart speeded. He had never been so close to Sally before. Her lips were
  parted, as if she might be about to ask a question.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid," he said rather huskily, "the sleeves are going to be a
  little long."</p>

  <p>She held them up, shook her hands free, and laid them gently on Peter's
  forearms. He proceeded to button the coat, seemingly reluctant to have done
  with his task.</p>

  <p>"It feels good, Peter," she said softly. "I'm glad you thought of it."</p>

  <p>There was a momentary pause, Peter's eyes narrowing a little as he
  regarded her indecisively. The pink tip of Sally's tongue moistened her lips,
  as she looked up with almost childish inquiry. "It has been such fun," she
  said.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Peter, with a deep-drawn breath. "Shall we go now?"</p>

  <p>They had been very quiet for nearly a mile. Then Peter wanted to talk
  again about Uncle Thomas. You see&mdash;it was <i>this</i> way. Uncle Thomas
  mustn't be hurt. Whether he was a real uncle or not didn't alter the case
  very much now. The fact was that he had invested heavily in the yacht for the
  express purpose of this voyage with Peter.</p>

  <p>"He should have asked you first, I think," commented Sally.</p>

  <p>"Of course&mdash;but that isn't the way Uncle Thomas does things. He
  assumes that everybody else likes what he likes. It was to be a wonderful
  surprise&mdash;don't you see? Uncle Thomas never dreamed that I might have
  some opinions on the subject."</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;when you come back," said Sally, "I suppose there will be
  another plan made for you&mdash;another voyage, maybe. Will you like that
  sort of life?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," admitted Peter glumly. "But it might be regarded as an
  education&mdash;of a sort. And there's nothing to keep me here. I
  mean"&mdash;he added&mdash;"I've no obligations. My mother is independent.
  And I've no other ties."</p>

  <p>They had agreed that it would be more prudent if Sally were dropped in the
  downtown district. Drawing up in front of the favourite hotel, Peter
  reluctantly opened the car door. Sally slipped out of the coat and laid it on
  the seat.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye," she said. "I suppose we shall not be seeing each other again.
  Examinations&mdash;and everything."</p>

  <p>Peter joined her on the pavement, signing to the doorman that he was not
  stopping. A small group of loungers regarded them with mild interest.</p>

  <p>"I don't like to say good-bye, Sally." Peter's tone was tender. "I'll be
  thinking about you&mdash;every day. I'll send you my addresses, if you don't
  think this bird of yours will object to your writing."</p>

  <p>"He won't care."</p>

  <p>"Maybe you'll not let him know," suggested Peter, hopeful of compounding a
  small intrigue to preserve their comradeship.</p>

  <p>Sally tipped her head in doubt about the fairness of this duplicity. "I'm
  afraid he'll have to know," she said dutifully.</p>

  <p>Peter reached out his hand and drew a dour little smile.</p>

  <p>"Seems a very formal way to part," he muttered.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it?" she agreed&mdash;"with everybody looking at us."</p>

  <p>He grew suddenly reckless.</p>

  <p>"I almost kissed you," he growled, "when I helped you on with my
  coat."</p>

  <p>Sally's eyes wavered for an instant.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said softly, "I know."</p>

  <p>"What would you have thought?"</p>

  <p>Sally laughed.</p>

  <p>"It might not have done me any good to think," she answered quietly.
  "You're ever so much bigger and stronger than I am... . 'Bye, Peter! Don't
  forget me!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Wallie met her at the train when she arrived home the second Friday
  afternoon in June. He had Lucy Trimble with him. The girls greeted each other
  amiably. Sally was surprised and amused over Wallie's proprietary attitude
  towards Lucy. There seemed to be a great deal of understanding between
  them.</p>

  <p>"You children," said Sally, while her baggage was being stowed in the car,
  "seem to have become very well acquainted since I saw you last."</p>

  <p>"You don't know <i>nothin',"</i> declared Wallie mysteriously.</p>

  <p>"In that case," drawled Sally, "I'll sit in the back seat with the
  freight, and you two cooing doves can hold hands."</p>

  <p>"You can see that college has broadened her experience, Wallie." Lucy
  turned around to bestow a companionable wink on her pert young friend.</p>

  <p>They teased each other pleasantly all the way home, with brief intervals
  for Sally's queries about the household. Her father was coming home from the
  hospital next week; spending most of his time now in the solarium, growing
  more and more restless to be up and doing. Roberta wasn't returning this
  summer. Yes&mdash;Mother was well and playing an enviable game of golf.
  Hannah?&mdash;well, Hannah hadn't been quite up to the mark lately; losing
  weight: something the matter.</p>

  <p>"She needs another vacation," thought Wallie.</p>

  <p>Sally made no comment. Poor Hannah&mdash;fretting her heart out over
  Peter's going away, and leaving college. But why should she let it trouble
  her so? After all&mdash;she wasn't responsible for Peter. And it wasn't quite
  like Hannah to be dismal very long about anything.</p>

  <p>Marcia was waiting for them at the door, bright-eyed with happiness. Sally
  gave her a bear-hug and they exchanged the murmured endearments customary at
  reunions, after which Marcia automatically patted her yellow curls back into
  their proper places.</p>

  <p>"Where's Hannah?"</p>

  <p>"We don't know," said Marcia, a little concerned. "She left the house
  shortly after luncheon. Always tells us when she goes away. Hannah has not
  been very well. I'm rather anxious about her."</p>

  <p>"If she hasn't shown up by dinner-time," said Wallie, "I'll do a little
  scouting for her&mdash;though I'm afraid I wouldn't know where to look.
  Hannah isn't very garrulous about her goings and comings."</p>

  <p>"She may have gone to see a doctor," suggested Lucy.</p>

  <p>"I don't think it's that," said Marcia. "She's worrying about
  something."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;don't people worry about their health?" demanded Wallie. "How
  about calling the hospital? She might have gone to the clinic."</p>

  <p>"Here she comes <i>now,"</i> exclaimed Sally, who was facing the open door
  to the street. "I don't see there's much the matter with her."</p>

  <p>Hannah was coming up the walk with a steady stride, a smile on her face,
  chin up, shoulders high.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll be damned," muttered Wallie. "Whatever it was that ailed her,
  she's got rid of it."</p>

  <p>"And I don't think it was at the hospital," observed Sally.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Hannah's decision to visit Paul had not been arrived at on impulse. She
  had been debating the matter for days. Something must be done to save Peter;
  and if so, it must be done promptly, for he was coming home on the twelfth to
  bid Lydia good-bye. He would be returning East within a week.</p>

  <p>There was no question about the renewed grip on life and hope and
  happiness that had come to Paul Ward. Wallie's report of his interview with
  his father&mdash;one of the most touching and stirring experiences Hannah had
  ever heard of&mdash;assured her that Paul had invited and received some
  revitalizing energy not in the keeping of medical science.</p>

  <p>And at the same time that Paul was renewing his courage and his health,
  Hannah's spiritual resources had run low. The goal she had pursued was now
  quite inaccessible. Everything she had worked for and sacrificed for had been
  destroyed by forces beyond her control. How often, through the years, Paul
  Ward had leaned full weight against her in his various predicaments. Now
  <i>he</i> had the strength. She wondered if she might warm her chilling faith
  at his reinvigorated fire. It would be a comfort to talk with him.</p>

  <p>Hannah hoped for a private interview. It was not going to be an easy
  matter to arrange. You never knew when Mrs Ward or Wallie would drop in at
  the hospital for a visit; not infrequently two or three times a day.</p>

  <p>This afternoon she could account for their movements. Mrs Ward would
  remain at home waiting Sally's arrival. Wallie had the car and was over at
  the Trimbles' for luncheon. This seemed to be the occasion she had been
  waiting for. Slipping quietly out of the house, she walked to the street-car
  and made the long, jolting trip to the hospital. There she had asked to see
  Professor Ward, and apparently his consent had been phrased enthusiastically;
  for, instead of a mere nod from the desk, Hannah was personally escorted to
  the door of Paul's room.</p>

  <p>"Hannah!" he cried. "I'm so glad you came!"</p>

  <p>She stood by his bedside, holding his hand tightly, intently studying his
  face. His experience had aged him, she thought; not into feebleness, though;
  into stability; into a new phase of&mdash;of refinement.</p>

  <p>"I have thought so much about you since I've been here," he said. "Thank
  you, Hannah, for putting my boy on his feet again&mdash;and his father, too.
  I have had an interesting demonstration of 'the will to power'.... Do sit
  down. Tell me about yourself. I'm afraid you're looking a bit fagged. Are you
  well?"</p>

  <p>"That's what I came to tell you, Paul. I am in trouble." She drew up a
  chair and tugged off her gloves. It wasn't going to be easy to tell him, for
  she intended, this time to tell him <i>everything</i>&mdash;or almost
  everything. She couldn't bring herself to report the friendship of their
  children. It would have involved a violation of Sally's confidence.</p>

  <p>"It's about Peter," she began. "You remember, don't you, the boy you met,
  many years ago, the time we rode home together on the train from
  Waterloo?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly. What's he doing now? Must be of college age. Fine lad, he was.
  He called you 'aunt', I remember. Isn't his mother able to handle him?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Hannah, "she isn't."</p>

  <p>"But why are you fretting about it?"</p>

  <p>There was a long pause.</p>

  <p>"Because <i>I</i> am his mother."</p>

  <p>Paul stared into her heavy eyes and muttered an ejaculation of
  amazement.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I'm bound to say you've done a very good job of keeping this a
  secret for twenty years. Go on, Hannah. Tell me all about it. Why didn't you
  want people to know? He's legitimate, isn't he? You told me you were married.
  Why didn't you own him?"</p>

  <p>The nurse came in then and Paul told her he was not to be disturbed for
  any reason whatsoever until he sent for her.</p>

  <p>"It's a long story," said Hannah. "I hope I'll not wear you out. But I've
  carried it as far as I can. I must confide it to someone very much stronger
  than I am, and get some help. That's why I came to you."</p>

  <p>Paul settled back into his pillows and signed to her to continue. She
  began in Surrey and told it all. Some of it went rapidly, sketchily; some of
  it brought tears, as when Philip died, and some of it brought
  smiles&mdash;Adele's comments on the risk involved in marrying Thomas. Paul's
  eyes were indignant when Thomas left her stranded in Chicago, and he
  muttered, "The cad!"</p>

  <p>"But I cannot join you in calling him that," said Hannah. "He was weak,
  self-indulgent, spineless, but&mdash;not a cad. At heart, a pretty fine
  fellow."</p>

  <p>The story proceeded; the visits to Waterloo, the decision to have the boy
  brought up as "Peter Edmunds", the circumstances of Adele's return to the
  extraordinary drama, Thomas's quick identification of his son at Bar Harbour
  and the promise Eleanor had wrung from him that he would not disclose his
  relationship to Peter.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to tell me that Mrs Trimble has known all about this? How did
  she happen to get into it?"</p>

  <p>And then Hannah related that part of the story, rather diffidently, for it
  was a delicate subject. Paul's eyes were averted.</p>

  <p>When she paused, he cleared his throat, and said huskily, "Eleanor told me
  she felt deeply indebted to you, Hannah. And for the same reason&mdash;so
  should I."</p>

  <p>"It was the other way about," insisted Hannah, shaking her head. "Mrs
  Trimble was a valuable friend to me."</p>

  <p>But now it must be made clear that young Peter was no weakling. Proudly,
  Hannah reported the little episodes which testified to the sort of boy he
  was. It gratified her immensely to tell Paul about the time Peter took his
  punishment gallantly at the Military Academy, and she showed him the
  cherished paper containing the interview with Colonel Livingstone.</p>

  <p>"A youngster like that is well worth saving," agreed Paul stoutly.</p>

  <p>So now we had come to the root of the matter. Hannah went into full
  details about Thomas's proposal, which would wreck every ambition she had
  nourished for her boy, so moved by the distressfulness of it that she often
  had to stop and collect herself before proceeding.</p>

  <p>"And now I've come to you, Paul, because I think you have laid fresh hold
  upon the power that I'm very much afraid I've lost. I still believe in it,
  but I'm not strong enough to use it."</p>

  <p>"Hannah"&mdash;Paul sat upright and laid his hand on hers. "Are you
  willing to make a little investment?"</p>

  <p>She smiled through her tears.</p>

  <p>"I persuaded you to do that, once, didn't I?" she remembered.</p>

  <p>"And it worked. Now you've a notion that I have regained some energy from
  'the Outside'. Are you willing to let me try to deal with your
  problem&mdash;and not ask me how I'm going about it&mdash;or ask me,
  afterwards, what I did?"</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;you're going to talk to Thomas?"</p>

  <p>"You're not to ask questions," repeated Paul firmly. "Are you willing to
  trust me?"</p>

  <p>Hannah regarded him soberly for a moment; then her eyes brightened, and
  she smiled.</p>

  <p>"Will you stop fretting about it?" he persisted.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Paul," she murmured. "I think"&mdash;Hannah drew a deep
  sigh&mdash;"I think I feel relieved&mdash;already. But&mdash;how are you
  going to get to Thomas&mdash;in your condition?"</p>

  <p>"That's my affair!" growled Paul, "and I'll thank you to keep your
  promise&mdash;now and hereafter."</p>

  <p>Hannah drew a puckery smile.</p>

  <p>"Remember the day you tried to break <i>yours?"</i></p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and you didn't let me. Keep that in mind. I can be hard,
  too!"</p>

  <p>She rose, and drew on her gloves.</p>

  <p>"Put up your right hand!" demanded Paul. "Repeat after me: 'I believe that
  Peter will fulfil my dreams for him'."</p>

  <p>With uplifted face, and eyes that took no account of Paul, Hannah raised
  her hand and said, almost exultantly, "I believe that Peter will fulfil my
  dreams for him!"</p>

  <p>"'I am not going to worry about him&mdash;any more!'"</p>

  <p>"I am not going to worry about him&mdash;any more."</p>

  <p>Paul sank back and closed his eyes. "There!" he muttered. "Now
  go&mdash;and see that you keep your word! It won't make much difference if
  you break your promise to <i>me.</i> I'll forgive you. But see to it that you
  keep your word with <i>Them!</i>&mdash;or Him&mdash;or It! I'm sure you know
  more about that part of it than I do."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">PETER had driven home. He would leave the coupé in Waterloo
  for his mother to use or sell as she liked. Then he would return by rail to
  New York and join Uncle Thomas for the cruise.</p>

  <p>Lydia noted many changes in him. The boyish sparkle and enthusiasm seemed
  stifled. It wasn't that Peter had taken on an air of gloom or grimness, nor
  was he inattentive or taciturn; but what he had to say lacked
  spontaneity.</p>

  <p>He talked freely about the contemplated voyage; exhibited maps, pictures,
  and the detailed shore itineraries which Uncle Thomas had toiled over with
  the expert assistance of the National Geographic people and other seasoned
  travellers.</p>

  <p>"He must have gone to endless trouble," reflected Lydia.</p>

  <p>"I think it was mostly the bother and expense he has invested," said
  Peter, "that finally brought me to a decision. I couldn't let him down."</p>

  <p>"But you really do want to go, don't you, Peter?" Lydia put down the group
  of pictures of Tamatave in Madagascar, lowered her lorgnette, and regarded
  him earnestly. "You're not doing this just to please Uncle Thomas, are
  you?"</p>

  <p>Peter toyed with his watch-chain and meditated a fair reply.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;that weighs heavily. Why shouldn't it? Perhaps, if I were
  entirely free to consult my own wishes, I might have postponed this trip
  until later. Naturally, Uncle Thomas feels that if we put it off until I have
  finished college, he might be too old to do it without fatigue, or I might
  find myself absorbed in my work&mdash;and not care to go, or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Or you might fall in love," assisted Lydia, smiling. "Maybe you have,"
  she added. "I don't want to pry, but something tells me there's another
  reason for your tardiness in deciding to go. Almost any young fellow would
  grab at the chance, I should think."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;it isn't that, Mother." Peter dismissed the suggestion with a
  brief gesture. "I don't mind telling you there is a girl who might have
  detained me, but&mdash;well&mdash;she's spoken for."</p>

  <p>"You met her in the East, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>Peter nodded, feeling that it was near enough to the truth.</p>

  <p>"I used to think you were fond of the pretty Ward girl. What was her
  name&mdash;Sally?" Lydia was trying too hard to make this sound casual and
  had overdone it a little, as she immediately suspected from the puzzled look
  Peter gave her.</p>

  <p>"I'm surprised you had any trouble recalling her name," he said meaningly.
  "Surely Aunt Hannah has talked enough about her to you."</p>

  <p>"Forgive me, Peter. I'm afraid it really was a leading question. But you
  can't blame your mother for being interested." She laughed softly.
  "Anyway&mdash;that's about all a woman has to think about."</p>

  <p>"I don't mind telling you," said Peter impulsively. "I am fond of Sally;
  have been always; but she is in love with someone else. I should have thought
  Aunt Hannah knew. Sally has always been so confidential with her."</p>

  <p>"I've been led to believe," said Lydia slowly, "that Sally Ward likes you
  tremendously. Your Aunt Hannah says she is always talking about you."</p>

  <p>"That's the trouble," muttered Peter. "She's just a mighty good
  friend&mdash;on a sort of 'pal' basis. Brother-'n'-sister kind of
  business."</p>

  <p>"Your Aunt Hannah, Peter&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"By the way, Mother"&mdash;Peter's voice was unsteady&mdash;"there's a
  question I should like to ask you."</p>

  <p>Lydia suddenly tipped her head to listen, rose quickly, and started
  towards the kitchen, explaining, as she went, "Sorry, Peter, something's
  boiling over out here."</p>

  <p>Peter listened, but couldn't hear anything. He grinned, rose, sauntered
  out into the hallway, lighted a cigarette. The old-fashioned front doorbell
  raised a loud clamour. He answered it, and took in a special-delivery letter
  addressed to himself and marked "Personal". It was brief, succinct,
  mysterious, dated from the University Hospital, but written on official
  University stationery.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">DEAR MR EDMUNDS:</p>

  <p class="letter">I wish to have a private talk with you on an urgent matter
  of mutual concern. I would come to see you but am unable to travel. May I
  suggest that upon receipt of this you come to me at your earliest
  convenience, informing no one. If this letter seems strange, be assured that
  it is no more unusual for you to be in receipt of it than for me to be
  writing it.</p>

  <p class="letter">Very truly yours,</p>

  <p class="letter">PAUL WARD.</p><br>

  <p>Peter's heart raced. What could Sally's father possibly want with him?
  Would it be something about Sally? He thrust the letter back into its
  envelope and into his pocket, retraced his steps to the library.</p>

  <p>"Didn't I hear the bell?" asked Lydia, who had again busied herself with
  the cruise pictures.</p>

  <p>"You just imagine you're hearing things this morning, Mother," drawled
  Peter. He gave her a slow, knowing wink, but she blandly refused to be
  flustered. A very well-balanced woman, he thought.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you'll be prowling back into the jungle&mdash;in Madagascar,"
  she said, intent upon a photograph of natives in fantastic barbarity.</p>

  <p>Peter's eyes brightened.</p>

  <p>"That reminds me&mdash;I've to take some typhoid shots. Might as well run
  over to the University Hospital and have one to-day; get the business over
  with. Haven't any shopping you want to do, have you? I'll take you
  along."</p>

  <p>She studied him for a moment with brooding eyes, and shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I must stay here and supervise dinner," she said. "The Wymans are coming,
  you know. Don't be late."</p>

  <p>"Very well&mdash;I'll start now, if you don't mind."</p>

  <p>Lydia went to the window and watched him go. From the same window, a few
  minutes before, she had watched the grey uniform of a postal employee
  receding down the street shortly after the doorbell had rung. Typhoid shots!
  Surely Peter was ingenious, and mighty quick on the trigger. The letter was
  from Sally, no doubt. She chuckled softly. Sally was going to give him some
  typhoid shots.</p>

  <p>Patty Wyman drove slowly by the house, looking very lovely in the green
  ensemble that matched her swanky little roadster. She had called Peter on the
  telephone yesterday and he had said, "I'll be seeing you." But he
  hadn't&mdash;yet. Patty would be looking for him this afternoon, doubtless.
  Lydia sighed, smiled, drew the lace curtains together, went out through the
  kitchen into the garden, and clipped a basketful of roses. She wondered
  whether Peter would give himself away when he returned. Probably not. He was
  pretty deep. She would say, "I hope they didn't hurt you." And he would rub
  his arm, and wince a little, maybe, and reply, "Not very much". And she would
  say, with a wink, "I hope you'll be able to eat your dinner, son." But he
  probably wouldn't tell her what she wanted to know. Well&mdash;why should he?
  She'd always had secrets from <i>him!</i></p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Peter felt that he would have recognized Professor Ward, but he had
  certainly changed a great deal. Of course, his recent illness would account
  for much of that. The Professor Ward he had met and instantly liked when he
  was a small boy seemed so youthful. It had been difficult to think of him as
  a professor. The greying man in the wheeled chair was the same person,
  frosted. The eyes were as friendly, the mouth as mobile, the dimple in the
  chin&mdash;Sally had one, too&mdash;was as deep.</p>

  <p>The greeting was without constraint.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, won't you? Thanks for coming. Much water has gone over the dam
  since I saw you last. You've grown to be quite a stalwart fellow."</p>

  <p>"I hope you're nearly well, sir. It was good of you to ask me in. If
  there's anything I can do for you, I'll be glad."</p>

  <p>"Peter, I am about to intrude upon your private affairs. It is not my
  custom, and I am not quite sure where to begin. But if you will be patient,
  I'll try to be brief."</p>

  <p>"Take your time, sir.... And thanks for your interest in me. I'm sure it
  will be to my advantage."</p>

  <p>"I hope so.... Some twenty years ago there appeared at my home a woman in
  distress. She had just been discharged from this hospital where she had borne
  a child. I was not informed of that fact at the time, though my wife knew.
  Perhaps she felt it might make some difference in my attitude towards our new
  maid if I were told. At all events, I did not know; nor would I have cared
  had I known; for the woman was capable, honest, clean, and extraordinarily
  kind."</p>

  <p>"My Aunt Hannah," said Peter.</p>

  <p>Paul Ward smiled, bowed slightly, and went on.</p>

  <p>"Hannah found us poor as church-mice; poorer, for church-mice do not
  borrow money they cannot pay, and aren't humiliated with monthly bills they
  aren't able to meet. This remarkable woman took us all in hand, helped us
  organize our home on a self-sustaining basis, saw us through every
  conceivable predicament; and, in short, made herself so indispensable that to
  have lost her would have been little short of a tragedy. Now she is in
  trouble, and it amounts almost to a personal grief to me. I thought you ought
  to know about it. Perhaps you might think of something we could do."</p>

  <p>"Anything, sir," declared Peter. "I'm very fond of my Aunt Hannah. What's
  the difficulty, please?"</p>

  <p>"It's this boy. You see&mdash;it was quite impossible for her to keep him,
  so he was given to other people."</p>

  <p>"And they have treated him badly?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;no, that isn't it." Paul shook his head, gazed for some time out
  at the window, and then returned to his narrative. "Perhaps I should
  say&mdash;though you unquestionably know this&mdash;that Hannah Parmalee was
  brought up with the most inflexible ideas on the subject of social caste. Her
  father was a gardener. She had spent her early life as parlourmaid,
  housekeeper, general servant. I don't think she ever rebelled against it, but
  it was her earnest hope that her child might grow up to take a less difficult
  place in the scheme of things. I think this is about the only ambition she
  has ever cherished, the hope that her boy would achieve rank, position,
  honour."</p>

  <p>Peter was listening attentively, his lips parted a little. He leaned
  forward in his chair, resting his weight on his elbows. Paul lifted a hand
  with outspread white fingers, as to say he was not quite ready for
  questions.</p>

  <p>"And so&mdash;she never disclosed herself as the boy's mother, feeling
  that if the relationship were known, it might prove to be an obstacle to his
  social and business success.... Now&mdash;neither you nor I are in a position
  to realize just what manner of heartbreaking sacrifice this would entail,
  because we have never been mothers, and aren't going to be. There has been
  omitted from our nature all the machinery for understanding that sort of
  mental anguish. But I think we have enough imagination to guess what it must
  have meant to Hannah, all through the years, to see her boy caressed by and
  caressing another mother, while she stood by, wistful, silent,
  hopeful&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How do you mean&mdash;'stood by'?" Peter's voice was husky. "Was she able
  to see him?" Paul nodded.</p>

  <p>"And he never knew?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;not until now."</p>

  <p>Peter stared hard at the floor, swallowed convulsively, and muttered,
  "Incredible!"</p>

  <p>"It <i>is,</i> rather."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;" Peter shook his head decisively. "You see, sir,
  this can't possibly be true. I know who my mother is. There really couldn't
  be any mistake about <i>that,</i> you know!"</p>

  <p>"All the more credit to Hannah for the way she kept the faith with
  you."</p>

  <p>Peter lifted almost indignant eyes. "Why are you telling me this&mdash;if
  she didn't want me to know?"</p>

  <p>"Because, you see, Hannah has dreamed for all the years of your amounting
  to something important. It was for this she gave you up; for this she
  sacrificed her rights as a mother. She does not know I am telling you, and I
  strongly suspect she would feel I had done her and you a grave injury. But
  you've a right to know what it has cost your mother to see you grow up to a
  point where you might live a useful, perhaps eminent life&mdash;and what
  unutterable grief it has caused her to see you throw that opportunity
  away!"</p>

  <p>Peter dug his finger-tips hard into his temples.</p>

  <p>"Aunt Hannah is <i>my mother!"</i> he muttered. "Uncle Thomas is <i>my
  father!</i> So&mdash;<i>that</i> accounts for it! It's true! ...
  <i>God!"</i></p>

  <p>"It is a severe shock, naturally," agreed Paul, after a little silence.
  "But it might be ever so much worse, you know. You're not making the
  discovery that you are illegitimate, nor are you confronted with a bad
  heritage. I know almost nothing about your father, beyond the fact that he is
  a person of large wealth, wide travel, and university training. But any young
  fellow who would be ashamed of having a woman like Hannah for his mother
  wouldn't deserve to have any relatives. Peter&mdash;of all the people I have
  known intimately, your mother is one of the bravest, one of the wisest."</p>

  <p>"I know she is all of that, sir," Peter assented in a barely audible
  voice. "It isn't that I have any wish to disown the relationship.
  But&mdash;it does bowl one over a bit."</p>

  <p>"Obviously&mdash;and it will take a little time before you can be expected
  to accommodate yourself to the idea."</p>

  <p>Peter glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I should go and see her at once. Is that your wish, sir?"</p>

  <p>"No, no, Peter! This is something that needs to be thought through with
  care. I learned about it only yesterday. I have had no time to give the
  problem my considered judgment, whatever that might be worth. But I doubt the
  wisdom of your rushing off to see Hannah."</p>

  <p>"Did she come here to tell you the story?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Hannah had carried her burden of perplexity as far as she could bear
  it. She came to me because&mdash;well, there wasn't anybody else available.
  She was reluctant to begin it; but, once fairly launched, she told it
  all."</p>

  <p>Peter found himself wondering how much discussion there had been on his
  friendship with Sally, but decided not to inquire. "Did she tell you how I
  happened to meet Uncle&mdash;my father? Did my Aunt Adele take me to Bar
  Harbour purposely to bring us together?"</p>

  <p>"No, that was an accident. And, by the way, Mrs Adele Moore is not your
  aunt. Your mother was employed in the home of her people when they were both
  young women."</p>

  <p>"Aunt Adele is no relation to me?" Peter's face was a study in
  mystification. "Then why did she bother with me at all?"</p>

  <p>"The most interesting part of your mother's career, Peter, is the quality
  of her friendships and the lasting impression she has made on the lives of
  many people presumably not of her station. Did you ever hear of Philip
  Raymond?"</p>

  <p>Peter vaguely remembered the name as one of his Aunt Hannah's childhood
  friends.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I had better tell you a little about that," said Paul. "It helps
  to an understanding of Hannah. You know all about her peculiar views on
  non-combativeness, non-resistance, and everything that goes with that state
  of mind."</p>

  <p>Peter smiled a little.</p>

  <p>"And she means it, too," he commented. "It hasn't been a mere academic
  theory with her."</p>

  <p>"She means it," echoed Paul seriously, "and she has some very excellent
  reasons for believing that her theory is sound. Perhaps that is why she has
  felt so utterly forsaken over your plan to be a person of leisure. Hannah
  always knew that if she didn't fight back, didn't enforce her rights, she
  would ultimately get what she wanted&mdash;and more&mdash;through the
  personal power generated by this passive attitude towards antagonisms. The
  one great reward she sought was to be realized through <i>you!</i> And now it
  had begun to appear that this reward would not be granted. The disappointment
  was breaking down the very structure and digging up the foundation of the
  faith upon which she had based every action of her life! It wasn't only that
  <i>you</i> were doomed to be a failure&mdash;according to her estimate of
  success; it was going to be a demonstration that her whole philosophy of life
  was an indefensible sophistry."</p>

  <p>"And this Philip Raymond?"</p>

  <p>"That's what I mean to tell you. Philip Raymond was responsible for
  Hannah's views. She loved him devotedly, believed everything he said, ordered
  her whole life after that pattern. It's a tender story, and I think you ought
  to hear it."</p>

  <p>Paul Ward had been deeply touched by Hannah's narration of that idyllic
  romance and its pathetic dénouement. Quietly, but impressively, he recited
  the little epic while Peter listened with brooding eyes. When it was
  finished, they both sat silently for a moment. Then Paul said, "The question
  you are facing now, Peter, seems to be reduced to the simple proposition:
  which one of your parents are you going to disappoint? It is obvious that you
  must disappoint one of them."</p>

  <p>Peter slowly nodded his head, without looking up.</p>

  <p>"You will have to balance the importance of your father's prospect of a
  cruise with you," continued Paul soberly, "against the importance of your
  mother's twenty years of sacrifice for you."</p>

  <p>"I see that," muttered Peter defencelessly.</p>

  <p>"You have your mother's faith to look out for, too, my boy. That's
  decidedly important, I think."</p>

  <p>"To <i>her,</i> yes&mdash;of course," agreed Peter.</p>

  <p>"It might become important to you, too," declared Paul. "It's an odd
  thing, but&mdash;you know Hannah has something, don't you? It is infectious.
  Once you've experimented with it, a little, you'll discover that it's by no
  means a mere theory!"</p>

  <p>Peter lifted his eyes and searched Paul Ward's pallid face.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean," he demanded, "that <i>you</i> believe in it!"</p>

  <p>"Yes! I believe in it! I am not a mystic, Peter. I do not consider myself
  a religious person. I know nothing about theology. I haven't any convictions
  on the subject of Deity&mdash;as to how He, They, or It subsist. But it has
  been definitely proved to me&mdash;thanks to Hannah&mdash;that there is a
  peculiar power available to those who are willing to accept it&mdash;and make
  use of it."</p>

  <p>Peter drew a long breath&mdash;and smiled.</p>

  <p>"I'm&mdash;I'm surprised," he said, after a little delay.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;if you ever have urgent occasion to try this out, and do it
  honestly, making some genuine investment as a suitable certificate of your
  sincerity, you'll be <i>still more surprised!"</i></p>

  <p>"If you don't mind my asking, sir&mdash;did you ever get what you
  wanted&mdash;by this process?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>"It's hard to believe, sir. My mind doesn't behave that way at all.
  Everything in me simply bristles at the thought of any practical reliance on
  the supernatural."</p>

  <p>"So did mine, Peter. I thought it was a mess of precious nonsense."</p>

  <p>Peter rose, thrust his hands deep in his pockets, and paced the length of
  the room.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;be that as it may&mdash;I must not let my&mdash;my mother
  down. I'll tell her I'm going back to college in the autumn. I may never
  amount to much, but I can try."</p>

  <p>Paul had a sudden impulse to reach out his hand and congratulate Peter on
  his decision; then thought better of it. Peter was not the sort to relish
  applause. He was Hannah's boy.</p>

  <p>"I presumed you would adopt that course," said Paul. "However&mdash;if you
  are agreeable to the suggestion, be in no hurry to talk to your mother. It
  occurs to me that Hannah might be seriously embarrassed if you went to her
  with an open acknowledgment of your relationship. Indeed, that will be
  exactly what she does <i>not</i> want! She has gone through a great deal to
  keep her secret; she thinks it would be to your disadvantage if it were known
  she is your mother. I think you would far better let it remain a secret, for
  her sake. Convey the information to her, any way you like, that you have
  decided to continue your college course and your professional training; but
  don't upset Hannah by telling her you know you are her son. I'm afraid that
  would spoil it all! She doesn't want you to know. Better respect her
  wishes."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps that's wise, sir," admitted Peter.</p>

  <p>"Don't tell <i>anybody,"</i> urged Paul.</p>

  <p>"Not even my mother?"</p>

  <p>"Meaning your foster-mother? No&mdash;not even Mrs Edmunds. Hannah kept
  this costly secret for your sake. Now you continue to keep it&mdash;for her
  sake."</p>

  <p>"I'll do as you say, sir, at least for the present."</p>

  <p>"I think this is all going to work out very happily, Peter."</p>

  <p>"I hope so, sir. I'll go now. My mother has guests this evening. She will
  be expecting me home."</p>

  <p>"You'll be entering Sheffield, this autumn?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir&mdash;majoring in Chemistry."</p>

  <p>"Your mother said that was your pet interest. I wish you well, Peter."</p>

  <p>There was a tap on the door, and it was pushed open a little way. Paul
  glanced up, frowning slightly.</p>

  <p>"Come!" he said, not very hospitably.</p>

  <p>She had never looked so thoroughly adorable in her life. It was a very
  simple, girlish, white frock, the blue scarf matching her eyes.</p>

  <p>Hesitating in the doorway, she glanced from one to the other
  mystifiedly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's you, Sally," said Paul. "Come on in, dear. Perhaps you remember
  Peter Edmunds. I think you played with him, a time or two, when you went with
  Hannah to Waterloo. Mr Edmunds has been talking to me about his college
  course&mdash;this autumn."</p>

  <p>For a moment Sally stood staring at Peter. Then her lips parted in a
  radiant smile. She walked towards him, holding out both hands.</p>

  <p>"Peter!" she said softly.</p>

  <p>He extended his hands to hers, but she did not take them. Instead, with
  outspread fingers she reached up and laid them on his shoulders. Putting his
  arms around her, he drew Sally very close. She looked up earnestly into his
  face.</p>

  <p>"You're not going away?" she murmured, shaking her head childishly.</p>

  <p>Peter's hands were trembling, as they tightened their hold.</p>

  <p>Paul Ward watched the strange tableau with open mouth and astonished eyes.
  They had forgotten his presence.</p>

  <p>"I didn't suppose you cared that much, dear," said Peter huskily.</p>

  <p>Sally's arms encircled his neck.</p>

  <p>"Care?" she whispered. "Oh&mdash;Peter!"</p>

  <p>He gathered her tightly to him and kissed her&mdash;a kiss that threatened
  to become permanent. Then, flushed and breathless Sally drew away, and
  suddenly became conscious of her father. She glanced towards him, the tears
  sparkling in her eyes; and Peter, considerably flustered, turned to face him,
  wondering what manner of explanation was in order.</p>

  <p>Paul grinned, and scratched his head.</p>

  <p>"Well"&mdash;he drawled, "I'm glad I had the forethought to introduce you
  to each other."</p>

  <p>Then they laughed, almost hysterically.</p>

  <p>"Come here, baby," said Paul.</p>

  <p>Sally stooped and kissed him. Peter standing by with her hand clasped
  tightly in his, wondered what her father might be thinking about all this. It
  was one thing for Professor Ward to extol his housekeeper as a woman of
  courage and wisdom; it would be quite another thing for Professor Ward to
  welcome the housekeeper's son into his family circle. Peter wished that
  Sally's father might have been given a chance to digest this a little. It
  seemed like taking him at a disadvantage.</p>

  <p>With one arm around Sally, Paul Ward extended his hand to Peter, looking
  him squarely in the eyes.</p>

  <p>"I believe you can be trusted," he said firmly, "to take good care of my
  girl."</p>

  <p>Peter's heart bounded with gratitude. It was not going to make any
  difference to Sally's father that he was Hannah's son. His eyes lighted with
  happiness.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir!" he exclaimed. "I'll do my best."</p>

  <p>Paul sank back into his pillows, smiling wearily.</p>

  <p>"Now, you two had better run along," he said, in a voice that betrayed his
  weakness. "I've had about all of you that I can stand&mdash;for one
  session."</p>

  <p>"Sally, what are you doing, for the rest of the day?" asked Peter
  impulsively.</p>

  <p>"Whatever you say, dear."</p>

  <p>"How about driving home with me for dinner? I want my mother to know. I'll
  bring you back afterwards."</p>

  <p>"May I, Daddy?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," consented Paul. "Quite the thing to do. Peter's mother will
  be glad to know you are both happy. Will this be a surprise to her?"</p>

  <p>"Very much so," said Peter. "It was to me, too, sir. You see, Sally and I
  have been close friends for a long time, but I didn't know she
  cared&mdash;not the way <i>I</i> cared."</p>

  <p>"Daddy, he's the stupidest boy in the whole world," Sally slipped her arm
  through Peter's and teased him with an impish smile. "Will you tell Wallie,
  when he comes to pick me up, that I'm provided for?... Peter, perhaps we
  should drive around by our house and let me get my coat, if we're to be out
  late. Mother will want to see you, too, I know."</p>

  <p>Peter's brows contracted a little.</p>

  <p>"You may wear mine, if it's chilly. I think I'd rather meet your mother
  when there's more time. Is that all right?"</p>

  <p>Sally nodded.</p>

  <p><i>"Everything,"</i> she replied softly, "is all right&mdash;now."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>There was a light in the kitchen when Sally quietly entered the house
  shortly after midnight. It would be Hannah waiting up for her. She meant to
  confide her great happiness to Hannah, of course, but had hoped she might be
  allowed to go directly to her room to-night without encountering anyone. The
  joy of this moment was too tenderly sweet to be shared.</p>

  <p>She expected to remember every detail of that evening's experience as long
  as she lived.</p>

  <p>They had left the hospital at four, decorously avoiding each other's eyes
  and hands until out of the building and safe in Peter's coupé.</p>

  <p>"It's wonderful, darling!" murmured Peter. "I can't believe it!" He took
  her hand in both of his and searched her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Come, Peter," she had said gently. "Push that little button and start
  your engine. Let's not do anything silly in plain sight of all these
  windows."</p>

  <p>They had carried themselves with great dignity until the town had been
  left behind and the open road was before them. Sally slipped over very close
  beside him.</p>

  <p>"I'll bet you haven't had a glimpse of Lincoln Lake since you've got
  home," said Peter. "It isn't far out of the way."</p>

  <p>"Sure we shan't keep your mother's dinner waiting?" wondered Sally
  dreamily.</p>

  <p>They had followed the gravel road then to the lake, stopping in the shade
  of a clump of maples. He had drawn her into his arms.</p>

  <p>"Darling," she had said, after a long sigh of contentment, "tell me about
  it. How did you happen to decide not to go away? Why did you come to see
  Daddy?"</p>

  <p>Peter had been silent for a moment, apparently trying to make up his mind
  how much to confide.</p>

  <p>"Sally, dear," he said, measuring his words, "it seems that my whole life
  has been a tangle of secrets that have been kept from me, for one reason and
  another. But there aren't going to be any secrets between <i>us!</i> Your
  father sent for me to-day. He wanted to tell me why he thought I should carry
  on with college and try to make something of myself."</p>

  <p>"I wonder if Hannah had been talking to him."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;she had." Peter's voice was unsteady.</p>

  <p>"That was odd. I'm awfully glad she did, Peter, dear." Sally had laid her
  palm caressingly against his cheek. "But&mdash;really&mdash;she didn't have a
  right to interfere in your affairs."</p>

  <p>Peter nodded his head.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;she had a right to, Sally. She is my mother."</p>

  <p>Sally knew she would never forget that moment; Peter's faraway look, her
  own sense of having been stunned to speechlessness. She had looked up into
  his sober face with astonished eyes. "Who told you?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Your father."</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;that's why your Uncle Thomas&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;that's why he wanted me to be with him."</p>

  <p>"I can't believe it, Peter. How did Hannah ever manage to keep this a
  secret?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;the circumstances all seemed to conspire. My mother took me
  when her own baby died."</p>

  <p>Sally had smiled sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"Mrs Edmunds is still your mother, I see."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;we decided to-day that it would be better not to let Aunt
  Hannah know that I have been told. Your father thinks it would make her
  unhappy. Do you think you can carry it off, with Aunt Hannah, and treat her
  the same as ever, Sally?"</p>

  <p>"I'll try. It won't be too difficult. Hannah has always seemed like
  another mother to me, dear."</p>

  <p>"And you're not disappointed&mdash;now that you know?"</p>

  <p>Sally had tightened her arm around his neck.</p>

  <p>"No, Peter. It won't make any difference. I'm glad you told me.
  And&mdash;I'll keep your secret. Shall I tell Daddy that I know?"</p>

  <p>"As you like, darling."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I'd better wait until he brings it up."</p>

  <p>"Maybe that would be better."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe I'll tell my mother, Peter. She might find it difficult
  to avoid letting Hannah know. It might spoil everything."</p>

  <p>"Maybe. You ought to know. Perhaps you're right."</p>

  <p>"Do you see what time it is? We must go." Sally had sat up straight,
  patting her tousled hair. "Your mother will think me a fright, Peter."</p>

  <p>"You can blame it on me. Shall we forget everything now, except that we
  have each other?"</p>

  <p>And so&mdash;they had forgotten everything, except that they had each
  other. Peter had driven the rest of the way to Waterloo at a speed that did
  not encourage conversation. They had arrived a little late. Mrs Edmunds had
  met them at the door.</p>

  <p>"Sally Ward, Mother," said Peter. "You remember, don't you?" He stopped
  and kissed her; then whispered something in her ear. Mrs Edmunds had seemed
  very happy about it. She had kissed Sally tenderly.</p>

  <p>"Peter has always wanted you, dear," she said softly. "I'm very glad for
  you both." She smiled into their eyes. "You make a handsome pair. There can
  be no doubt about that.... Come, now. The Wymans are here. Dinner is waiting.
  Peter, show Sally up to my room."</p>

  <p>"I'd forgotten," said Peter, as they ran upstairs arm in arm. "Patty
  Wyman's here. Be specially nice to her, darling."</p>

  <p>"Is she the girl you once said had big feet?" laughed Sally.</p>

  <p>"You remember everything, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps Patty would have preferred I hadn't come."</p>

  <p>Peter dismissed Patty with a shrug and a flick of the fingers, and they
  went down to the old-fashioned parlour where introductions were had. Mrs
  Edmunds announcing, quietly: "Sally Ward&mdash;Peter's fiancée." They had all
  been very cordial, Patty almost boisterously so.</p>

  <p>"Why, Peter!" she exclaimed. "How mean of you&mdash;not even to have told
  the neighbours!"</p>

  <p>And then Peter had grinned and confessed. "I've only known it, myself
  since about four o'clock." How amazed they had been!</p>

  <p>She couldn't remember much about what they had had to eat. Peter had
  carved the roast and had done it expertly. She had sat at the other end of
  the table beside Mrs Edmunds, who had leaned close enough to say, while Susie
  was brushing crumbs: "It will be sweet to have a daughter." And Sally had
  tried hard not to think about what she had heard, fearing her puzzlement
  might show in her face.</p>

  <p>The drive home&mdash;how tender! She wanted now to slip up to her room and
  be alone with the day's ecstasies.</p>

  <p>But Hannah would know she had come and would think it very queer if she
  went up without pausing to speak. Her heart raced a little. Hannah was such a
  knowing person. She always guessed what you were thinking about. You didn't
  have to tell her. She knew.</p>

  <p>"Not gone to bed yet?" called Sally, from the kitchen doorway.</p>

  <p>Hannah put down her book on the table and smiled a welcome.</p>

  <p>"Wallie said you had gone away with somebody&mdash;for dinner. I was a bit
  anxious about you, dear. It's late."</p>

  <p>"You can't imagine where I've been. I accidentally ran into Peter. He'd
  driven over on an errand&mdash;something for his mother. Then he wanted me to
  go home with him for dinner."</p>

  <p>Hannah's eyes widened with surprise.</p>

  <p>"How was Peter?" she asked, trying hard to keep her voice steady.</p>

  <p>"Wonderful!" Sally leaned on the back of Hannah's chair; and, bending
  forward, laid her flushed cheek against Hannah's ear. "Got something to tell
  you, darling," she murmured childishly. "Give you three guesses."</p>

  <p>She could feel a little tremor run over Hannah, a succession of stifled
  sobs.</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;and&mdash;Peter?" asked Hannah thickly.</p>

  <p>Sally pressed her face hard against Hannah's and nodded her head.</p>

  <p>Then Hannah turned, put an arm around Sally, looked up in perplexity, and
  said: "But&mdash;Peter can't take care of you, dear. He's&mdash;going
  away."</p>

  <p>"Peter has changed his mind, Hannah. He's not going. He expects to carry
  on in college&mdash;and be a chemist&mdash;and everything, just the way you'd
  hoped."</p>

  <p>Hannah drew a deep, shuddering sigh that seemed to throw off an
  insupportable weight. Then she clutched Sally's hands hard.</p>

  <p>"Did he decide that&mdash;because&mdash;because he didn't want to leave
  <i>you?"</i></p>

  <p>"Well"&mdash;Sally smiled archly&mdash;"perhaps that did have something to
  do with it."</p>

  <p>Hannah rose, clasped one hand rightly with the other, and slowly paced the
  room, apparently anxious to control her pent-up emotion.</p>

  <p>"I wanted Daddy to see Peter. I had expected to go to the hospital,
  anyway, you know."</p>

  <p>Hannah leaned a hand against the wall and went suddenly pale.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said hoarsely. "Did your father see him?"</p>

  <p>"Daddy's crazy about him!"</p>

  <p>"Does he know you and Peter are engaged?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;we told him. He's glad."</p>

  <p>Retracing her steps unsteadily to the table, Hannah sat down and cupped
  her face with both hands. She was deeply moved.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you pleased, Hannah?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, dear; I'm pleased. I'm glad you told your father."</p>

  <p>"He was wonderful about it."</p>

  <p>"Your father," said Hannah fervently, <i>"is a wonderful man!"</i></p>

  <p class="first">IT had turned quite cold in the night, and when Lydia was
  roused at seven by the exasperating racket Susie was making at the furnace, a
  powdery snow was being driven aimlessly about by a crazy gale.</p>

  <p>She stood by the window for a moment, shivering and depressed; then went
  back to bed to wait until the heat should begin to come up attended by the
  inevitable whiff of noxious coal gas.</p>

  <p>So&mdash;winter had come again, dismayingly prompt with its sullen grey
  sky. The winters, reflected Lydia, were growing longer; arriving
  earlier&mdash;this was only the thirteenth of November&mdash;and hanging on
  tiresomely through what had used to be spring. She wished this might have
  been a bright morning. A streak of genial sunshine would have lightened her
  mood. She felt old, and a bit terrified.</p>

  <p>Yesterday afternoon Mr Jennings had seemed so pessimistic about the
  country's financial condition. It hadn't been so much what Mr Jennings
  actually said as the spent manner in which he betrayed his forebodings with
  the beaten eyes and jerky gestures of an old man who has just missed the last
  train.</p>

  <p>"Are things as bad," she had asked, "as the papers have been saying?" And
  Mr Jennings had scowled grimly, rubbed his chin hard with shaky fingers and
  replied: "Well&mdash;it hasn't reached the proportions of a panic yet;
  except, of course, for people who had been playing the market."</p>

  <p>Lydia had tried to be comforted by that, even in the face of the banker's
  gloom, for she hadn't played the market. She wouldn't have known how. The
  whole business was as incomprehensible to her as the jargon of polo.</p>

  <p>"It's just a Wall Street mishap, then?" she had observed brightly.</p>

  <p>Mr Jennings had pulled an indulgent grin.</p>

  <p>"A Wall Street mishap, Mrs Edmunds," he solemnly replied, in the tone of
  the committal service, "is always an inconvenience to large numbers of
  people. And so far as playing the market is concerned, that has not been
  distinctly a New York recreation. Almost everybody is involved in it."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know," Lydia had confessed.</p>

  <p>"Of course not&mdash;and it's to your credit. You see, Mrs Edmunds, the
  whole country has been spending money that had no existence in fact. Wages
  have been good, credit has been easy. It has become a settled habit, with all
  sorts of people, to be pleased and contented with possessions on which they
  had paid a mere pittance. Almost nobody owned anything outright. Most of the
  nation's business was done on paper. Everybody had his safety-deposit locker
  stuffed with pretty pictures of large sums of money. Now that the bottom has
  dropped out of this picture business, they're all scared. Credit has suddenly
  closed up like a steel trap."</p>

  <p>"Are my bonds&mdash;all right?" she had inquired anxiously.</p>

  <p>"For the present&mdash;yes. You are fortunate not to have owned any
  speculative stocks."</p>

  <p>Mr Jennings had been called to the telephone then and she had taken a
  rather unceremonious leave when it became obvious that he had said everything
  he was likely to say to her and had more important problems on his distracted
  mind.</p>

  <p>She had left the bank then, mentally calling the roll of the people who
  were probably wondering what was to become of them. Hannah had often spoken
  of the Trimbles' keen interest in the ups-and-downs of stock speculation.
  They had lived extravagantly. It would be difficult for them to alter their
  habits. And there was Thomas Bradford! Peter had often remarked that Uncle
  Thomas grew very fidgety if the market was cutting capers. It would be too
  bad if Thomas lost his money, for he didn't have much else. She wondered if
  her brother Henry&mdash;but no; it wasn't likely that Henry would be
  involved. Henry didn't even carry coins loose in his pocket, but kept his
  change in a little purse. Before he spent a nickel, he had to unbutton the
  flap on his hip-pocket to get to the purse. She felt satisfied about Henry's
  immunity from the disaster that had overtaken the gamblers.</p>

  <p>Then Lydia had paid the gas and electric-light bills and walked home,
  haunted by the first sensation of insecurity that she had faced in her whole
  lifetime. At the old home, when she was a girl, they had rigidly economized,
  but she couldn't remember that they had ever been frightened. Jasper had
  turned a few sharp corners, early in their married life, but if he had
  fretted seriously over it he hadn't let her know. As a widow, there had never
  been a moment's concern about money. Sometimes when she was lonely and blue
  she would comfort herself with the assurance that at least there would always
  be a good living. Life wasn't always so rich and full as she might have
  wished, but she would be sheltered and fed and comfortable if she lived to be
  a hundred.</p>

  <p>Arriving home at three-thirty she had found a letter from Peter. He was
  well, happy in his work, and grateful for the cheque. He hoped her affairs
  were in good condition. Everyone was worried about the crash. How did she
  feel about her funds? Perhaps she had better plan an economy programme. "I
  can do with much less than you have been sending me," he had continued. "I
  have been very frugal lately; quite miserly, indeed, now that I've opened a
  savings account."</p>

  <p>Lydia had smiled at that. Peter was thinking of marriage.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">I am unhappy about Uncle Thomas (he went on). He has lost
  heavily. Of course, it won't be poverty. I mean&mdash;Uncle Thomas will still
  eat, and buy two tickets so he can travel in a Pullman drawing-room. But he
  has lost enough to make him sick. He wasn't very well, anyway. I didn't want
  to worry you, so said nothing much about it at the time, but Uncle Thomas was
  dreadfully let down by my refusal to go with him on the cruise. He wasn't
  cross or indignant; just inconsolably hurt. Maybe I did not handle it
  considerately enough. I was so hilarious over Sally that I fear I talked more
  about my own happiness than his disappointment. Then came this crack-up in
  the stock market. He seemed dazed, incredulous. It will be hard for him to
  reorganize his habits.</p>

  <p class="letter">I have a letter from him to-day. He is at Asheville for
  what he calls "a little recuperation". But it's more serious than that, for
  he writes from a sanatorium, and I know you couldn't drag him into that sort
  of place unless there was something the matter. I'm undecided what part I
  ought to play. If I go down there to see him, I know he will be embarrassed.
  It will only add to his discomfort if I leave my work to go popping in on him
  with my pity when there's really nothing I can do. But he has been so kind,
  and I have seemed so ungrateful. What do you think? Shall I go to
  him?</p><br>

  <p>Lydia sat for a long time gazing dully at the letter, wondering what would
  become of Thomas. People who had nothing but money were in a very awkward
  position if they lost much of it. But the last thing Thomas Bradford would
  want was anyone's pity&mdash;Peter's least of all. It would make him feel old
  and helpless.</p>

  <p>She was glad now that Peter did not know just how deeply he was indebted
  to Thomas. For years the monthly cheque had arrived early to be deposited to
  the account set aside for Peter. The June remittance had been the last one.
  Thomas had not written to explain that there wouldn't be any more, doubtless
  taking it for granted that Lydia would understand.</p>

  <p>Well&mdash;it wasn't as if Peter would have to leave college because
  Thomas had stopped paying for it. Lydia knew she would not be able to
  continue remittances in the same figures, but she could give him all he
  actually required. It comforted her to note Peter's suggestion, about a
  reduction of his allowance. She had been wondering how she was going to tell
  him.</p>

  <p>The bedroom was warming now and Lydia dressed to go down. The ground was
  white. It was Hannah's customary day to come. Perhaps she would change her
  mind when she saw the weather. But maybe not. Hannah had taken on new energy
  ever since Peter had decided to go back to school. It was amazing; she was a
  different woman. And she had seemed so unaccountably elated over the
  engagement of Sally and Peter. That was odd, for Hannah had never enthused
  over the prospect of the match; not that she didn't like Sally, but she
  wanted Peter kept away from the Wards. And now that Peter had done the very
  thing Hannah had been at such pains to forestall, she was fairly sitting on
  top of the world! Lydia had quizzed her about it, half-playfully, and
  Hannah&mdash;a little flustered&mdash;had said: "I suppose it was destined to
  happen, and we may as well make the best of it"&mdash;but she didn't have the
  appearance of a person resigning herself submissively to an inexorable fate.
  She was bubbling over with joy! There was something more, behind all this,
  believed Lydia, that she herself hadn't learned.</p>

  <p>Hannah came in briskly at eleven, rosy and out of breath. Susie was
  ordered to make a pot of coffee and give the furnace another punch.</p>

  <p>"I surely needed you, dear," said Lydia, stirring the grate fire. "I
  feared you might not come."</p>

  <p>"Why not? It's a very bracing day."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad somebody thinks so."</p>

  <p>Hannah laid a hand on Lydia's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"What is it, dear?" she asked gently. "Money&mdash;maybe?"</p>

  <p>"Not mine. It seems to be safe enough. But so many people are in trouble,
  friends of ours."</p>

  <p>"Who&mdash;for instance?"</p>

  <p>"Well, there's Thomas, for one. I don't suppose it's part of my job to
  worry over Thomas, but&mdash;" Lydia paused.</p>

  <p>"What about him?" demanded Hannah. "Tell me."</p>

  <p>The porter had made several trips to the vestibule, staggering through the
  swaying car with heavy bags and cases. It had begun to look as if almost
  everybody on the train would be getting off at Asheville. He had come now for
  Hannah's baggage. There wasn't much of it&mdash;a suitcase and an overnight
  bag. The porter insisted on rubbing her shoes, and when she inquired
  nervously whether they were almost there, he said: "Yas'm; in five minutes."
  Hannah's query was entirely superfluous, for the passengers were pulling on
  their coats; but she had wanted to try out her voice to see if it would sound
  as hollow and indecisive as she had feared. And it fulfilled her forebodings,
  sounding as if she were guilty of some crime and expected to be met by the
  police at the station.</p>

  <p>Ever since wakening, long before daylight, Hannah had been growing more
  and more stampeded by the thought of her errand. When the conductor stopped
  to return the unused portion of her ticket, she would have been very glad if
  he had said: "Sorry, madam, but you're on the wrong train. Your ticket reads
  to Asheville, and we're not going there."</p>

  <p>It wasn't as if her decision to see Thomas had been arrived at
  impetuously. The idea of going to him had not begun to take on tangible form
  until she was on the way home from her day with Lydia. Peter had wondered, in
  his letter, whether he ought to visit his Uncle Thomas. Lydia and Hannah had
  both agreed with him that this might have the wrong effect. It might only add
  to Thomas's humiliation and sense of defeat if Peter, who had so idolized
  him, made a journey to witness his hero's collapse.</p>

  <p>But <i>someone</i> should have a friendly talk with Thomas. He was sick,
  worried, lonely. It was not right to neglect him. Gradually the conviction
  deepened in Hannah's mind that she herself should go. The fact that Thomas
  had once neglected her at a time of her most urgent need of him was quite
  beside the point and could be forgotten.</p>

  <p>Next morning, Hannah had sought a word with Paul. She found him in the
  library studiously intent upon the paper which he had carried with him from
  the breakfast table contrary to his usual custom. Briefly she had confided
  her dilemma while he listened only half attentively.</p>

  <p>"By all means," he had urged, with businesslike promptness that
  discouraged any extended debate. "By all means go, Hannah. It will be a great
  satisfaction to you both. Thomas's illness provides a very good reason for a
  friendly interview." His eyes wandered again to the newspaper. "You should
  plan to go at once."</p>

  <p>"I'm not quite sure," Hannah replied uncertainly. "It isn't enough to go
  there in a friendly attitude. I ought to have something helpful to say to
  him. I should like to be able to do something for him."</p>

  <p>Aware now that Hannah was seriously pressing for advice rather than his
  mere consent to her journey, Paul had put down the paper, carefully polished
  his glasses, and deliberated.</p>

  <p>"You might not be able to do anything&mdash;directly," he announced
  judicially. "But in the face of your efforts to conciliate, Thomas may be
  able to do something for <i>himself.</i> Obviously, what he needs now is a
  restoration of his self-confidence, his self-esteem. Doubtless the memory of
  his bad treatment of you has been a very sore and sensitive spot in his mind
  all through the years. You're the only person who can help him heal that old
  lesion."</p>

  <p>"Is it so very important that the old lesion be healed <i>now?</i> Perhaps
  it doesn't bother him any more. It has been a long time."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but there have been plenty of distractions. Now that Thomas has
  ample time for reviewing his mistakes, the thing he did to you will loom
  large and hurt very painfully... Hannah, it might be interesting to
  inquire"&mdash;Paul's eyes narrowed thoughtfully as he paused to find the
  right words for a new idea&mdash;"It might be interesting to inquire whether
  the person who has been dreadfully wronged, injured, defrauded, is not
  morally obliged to assist the other fellow in relieving himself of his
  intolerable remorse."</p>

  <p>Hannah nodded an agreement to this, adding, in a tone barely audible, that
  not many people would find it easy to do.</p>

  <p>"No, not easy&mdash;but far easier than for the aggressor to make peace
  with the person he has wronged. This is part of your own philosophy, Hannah,
  and that philosophy is sound. See here! You have always maintained that the
  person who, having been injured or defrauded, makes no effort to avenge
  himself or reclaim his losses, achieves a peculiar strength of spirit. That
  is a demonstrable fact. You and I both know it's true. Now!&mdash;isn't it
  just as logical that the person who has perpetrated that fraud and inflicted
  that injury&mdash;and has been permitted to do it without hindrance or threat
  of redress&mdash;is <i>weakened</i> in spirit? And, if so, is it not the duty
  of the strong one to come to the rescue?"</p>

  <p>Hannah found herself deeply stirred.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Paul," she exclaimed, "that's magnificent!"</p>

  <p>He tipped back in his chair, interlaced his fingers behind his head and,
  smiling, into her eyes said slowly: "I suppose that this might be called the
  highest, the costliest, the final degree in the practise of personal
  disarmament, personal peace, private courage. You can do it, of course, for
  you've trained yourself in that school. Go to Thomas, Hannah. Then&mdash;I
  think you can feel that you've&mdash;<i>graduated?"</i></p>

  <p>There was a considerable silence. Hannah rose and walked towards the door,
  where, with her hand on the knob, she turned to say: "That was quite
  distressing news, wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>Paul's brows contracted into a dark frown. He tapped the paper with his
  glasses.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you mean&mdash;about Ellis's financial smash&mdash;and
  attempted suicide?"</p>

  <p>Hannah nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well?" growled Paul, deep in his throat.</p>

  <p>Hannah drew a puckery little smile.</p>

  <p>"Got what was coming to him, didn't he?" demanded Paul gruffly.</p>

  <p>"I was just wondering," said Hannah gently. "Perhaps <i>you</i> might earn
  one of those diplomas, too."</p>

  <p>For the first few moments they hardly realised what they were saying to
  each other, so occupied were they in their candid appraisals of the greying
  hair and the deeply chiselled lines which mapped the long journey they had
  made through the years since the day of their separation.</p>

  <p>Hannah would have known him anywhere. The things she had admired most had
  remained practically unchanged&mdash;the quadrant of spider-webbish crow's
  feet that had always added a touch of maturity and something almost like
  sagacity to the sidelong look he gave you; the rugged temples, where, under
  the pallor, a blue vein now pulsed ominously; the square chin that had always
  lied a little when presenting Thomas as a man of determination; the close-set
  ears, finely modelled, patrician&mdash;the ears he had bequeathed to Peter in
  such an unmistakably identifiable manner that Hannah had sometimes wondered
  if the ears wouldn't some day tell the secret of their relationship to the
  most indifferent observer; the soft, drawling voice that seemed always to be
  saying, no matter by what words "After all, what's the difference.... Why
  bother?... Forget it.... Take the cash and let the credit go." There had been
  times when it had seemed a very comforting voice.</p>

  <p>"This is an unexpected pleasure, Hannah," Thomas was saying evenly. "I
  wish I were in a position to show you about. It is quite beautiful here. I
  shall arrange some drives for you&mdash;if you will allow me."</p>

  <p>It wasn't going to be easy to talk about the things that really mattered.
  Thomas quietly, courteously directed the conversation for an hour, avoiding
  any mention of his misfortunes. The years, he declared pleasantly, had been
  very kind to Hannah, adding: "Some people have a talent for combating Time,"
  and when she smiled her appreciation, he continued playfully: "I observe that
  your theory of non-resistance did not rest on your submission to the ravages
  of oncoming age."</p>

  <p>Hannah was growing a bit restless. Thomas was taking pains to see that
  none of his inconsequential remarks tossed her a cue for some serious
  comment. Besides, there were plenty of interruptions which Thomas apparently
  welcomed. The nurse came and went on trivial errands, almost as if she had
  had instructions to do so. The doctor came, and Hannah was amiably presented
  as a long-time friend "practically a member of our family". The daily papers
  came. The librarian came. The chauffeur came. The mail came, followed
  presently by a special-delivery letter. Thomas asked to be pardoned while he
  read it. Hannah was beginning to feel superfluous.</p>

  <p>"I mustn't tire you," she said, when there was a brief undisturbed
  interval. "I had thought we might both be glad for a quiet talk. We parted
  under circumstances that made us sorry. I felt that it might ease our minds
  if we met again and assured each other of our friendship."</p>

  <p>Thomas, with a gentle gesture, dismissed any suggestion that there had
  been ill-feeling between them.</p>

  <p>"It is fine of you, Hannah," he declared companionably. "Surely you have
  no cause to regret your own attitude. It was most magnanimous.... As for
  me&mdash;well&mdash;" He shrugged a shoulder slightly. "Perhaps it's too late
  to talk about it. I've always been sorry."</p>

  <p>"I didn't come to discuss that," said Hannah reassuringly. "I understood
  the predicament you were in&mdash;when you left me. I have not harboured any
  resentment. It gives me pleasure to tell you that. I thought you might be
  glad to know it, now that you aren't very well and have need of a peaceful
  mind.... There's really nothing," she continued, after a pause which Thomas
  hadn't been disposed to make use of&mdash;"there's nothing to compare with a
  peaceful mind, particularly when one is alone&mdash;or ill."</p>

  <p>Thomas's face clouded.</p>

  <p>"You're right," he said crisply. "That's my trouble now. I'm not sleeping.
  I can crowd the daytime with little distractions, but at night, when
  everything is quiet, my mind is a riot. All the people who have taken me in
  come to taunt me. I've been robbed by men I trusted, men I'd known for years.
  I get to hating them&mdash;at night." He nervously slipped a hand under the
  sheet and fumbled in the vicinity of his heart. "It isn't good for me. But,
  somehow, I can't stop it."</p>

  <p>"Must you let them keep on robbing you?"</p>

  <p>"No," snapped Thomas obtusely, "they can't take anything else. I've been
  practically cleaned out."</p>

  <p>"Of money&mdash;you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Money&mdash;of course!" he growled, in an impatient tone that charged
  Hannah with stupidity. Then, suddenly sorry for his rudeness, he added less
  irascibly: "There's nothing left now to steal."</p>

  <p>"Except your peace," said Hannah quietly. "You couldn't help their taking
  your money. Now that they've got it, let them have it. But&mdash;please,
  Thomas&mdash;don't let them hurt you any more."</p>

  <p>He stirred restlessly. The nurse came in and he dismissed her with a jerk
  of his head towards the door. "See that we're not bothered for a while," he
  said, as she went out.</p>

  <p>"It's easy enough to say, Hannah. Perhaps it might even be easy enough to
  do&mdash;for a person of your fine calibre. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Hannah leaned forward, resting her elbow on the arms of her chair, and
  regarded Thomas compassionately.</p>

  <p>"May I tell you a strange story, about the man in whose home I have been
  employed for many years?"</p>

  <p>"Case like mine, I presume," surmised Thomas.</p>

  <p>She made no effort to speed or abridge her narrative. For a time it was
  evident that Thomas was listening for sheer courtesy's sake. But when the
  invention was ruthlessly stolen, after Paul's hope had been so radiantly
  illumined and a fortune was all but in his hand, it was gratifying to see
  Thomas growing keenly attentive. Thrusting a bent arm under his head, he
  followed her lips with absorbed eyes.</p>

  <p>"And then," continued Hannah, "the poor fellow went literally crazy,
  hacked his machine to fragments, and yelled to heaven that he would get even
  if it took his last cent."</p>

  <p>"And not much wonder!" approved Thomas. "He could have put them all behind
  the bars for a rascally job like that. I hope he did."</p>

  <p>"He didn't," said Hannah serenely. "And that has to be explained by
  another story.... Am I wearying you, Thomas?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all. Go right on. What did Ward do about it?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;before I tell you that&mdash;" And then Hannah proceeded to
  the almost incredible incident of Paul's promise made at the time of Wallie's
  desperate illness.</p>

  <p>"Religious fellow, eh?" commented Thomas dryly, at the end of it.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;not the least bit."</p>

  <p>"Umm&mdash;perhaps not in the conventional way&mdash;but he did believe in
  a faith-cure."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I don't think he had any faith at all. But he loved his child
  and was willing to gamble on <i>my</i> faith."</p>

  <p>"You really believed in it, I suppose.... Of course, I can see that you
  did." Thomas grimaced. "Ward put up the votive offering of money, and you put
  up your faith and together you worked a miracle: is that it?"</p>

  <p>Hannah refused to be disturbed. She smiled indulgently, and went on.</p>

  <p>"That's one way of saying it. But Mr Ward didn't actually 'put up the
  money'. It had already been stolen from him, you see. He simply consented to
  let them have it&mdash;and not fight back. The curious thing about it was
  that he didn't even hate the Ellises any more. He seemed to have possessed
  himself of some new energy to do things he had never been able to manage
  before. He became more important at the University, did twice the work with
  half the effort, and then&mdash;one day&mdash;he resumed his interest in the
  old invention and made another machine that completely surpassed the one
  they'd stolen. It made him very well-to-do."</p>

  <p>Thomas laughed unpleasantly.</p>

  <p>"And so&mdash;his God paid him off in cash. That was nice of Him....
  Forgive me, Hannah," he added, quickly sobering when he saw the pain in her
  eyes. "I'm afraid that wasn't very courteous."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;that's all right, Thomas. I'd much rather you'd be honest than
  polite. Paul did become wealthy, but that was only incidental. The really
  important reward he received was the gift of <i>personal peace.</i> From the
  day he decided not to make war on the Ellis brothers, he left off hating
  them. They did not trouble him any more&mdash;at night. He couldn't have
  bought that&mdash;not for a million!"</p>

  <p>"But he had to invest something to get it," observed Thomas thoughtfully.
  "I assume that you've been telling me all this because you think my case is
  similar. Perhaps it is. But I'm quite empty-handed, Hannah. Ward had
  something to offer&mdash;when his boy needed it."</p>

  <p>"I was just about to speak of that, Thomas." Hannah's voice was very
  tender. "Paul Ward was prepared to make almost any sort of sacrifice for his
  son. All that was to his credit, of course. But when he did it he knew that
  if his adventure was successful, he would have his boy restored to him. You
  and I both know what it means to give up something for the sake of a
  child&mdash;and never to experience the happiness of actually claiming him as
  our own. You say you have nothing to offer. My dear, you have already made
  your offering. Year after year, you have hidden your identity as Peter's
  father, permitting his foster-mother to take full credit for giving him his
  education, travel, luxuries, advantages of all sorts. You asked nothing in
  return. I think you deserve something for this investment."</p>

  <p>Thomas's eyes softened.</p>

  <p>"How about <i>you,</i> Hannah?" he said gently. "Surely your sacrifice was
  greater than mine."</p>

  <p>"I've had my pay," said Hannah.</p>

  <p>"In&mdash;in what you call&mdash;<i>personal peace</i>&mdash;you
  mean?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." She laid her hand gently on his and smiled into his eyes. "May I
  not share it with you, Thomas?"</p>

  <p>They regarded each other silently for a little while. Then with a deep
  sigh, Thomas shook his head doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"You've earned it, you know," persisted Hannah softly. "It's
  there&mdash;waiting for you&mdash;whenever you want to claim it."</p>

  <p>He smiled his appreciation of her solicitude, but gave no sign of belief
  in what she had been saying. Presently he reached up for the cord that
  dangled at the head of his bed and pressed the button. The nurse
  appeared.</p>

  <p>"Kindly serve luncheon here&mdash;for two," he said. And when the door had
  closed again, he remarked animatedly: "Hannah, it has been immensely good of
  you to come. How long can you stay?"</p>

  <p>"Until to-night. I'm leaving at ten. I've my work to do. I shall go home
  much happier for having talked with you."</p>

  <p>It was nine o'clock. Hannah had dropped in for a moment to say good-bye,
  and had left in high spirits. The nurse was busying herself with the
  customary duties of preparing her difficult patient for another restless
  night.</p>

  <p>"You have had a very active day, Mr Bradford," she remarked half-testily.
  "Much too much excitement."</p>

  <p>Thomas made no reply.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;how about it? Shall I give you a sleeping-powder or do you
  want your detective story?"</p>

  <p>"Neither," said Thomas, as from a considerable distance.</p>

  <p>"You'll ring&mdash;if you want me?"</p>

  <p>"I'll not be wanting you. Turn off the light, please."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch20"
     id="ch20">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SALLY tossed the flowers down towards the uplifted white
  arms of her bridesmaids, blew them a kiss, and continued up the stairs, Peter
  following closely.</p>

  <p>In the upper hall she tightened her fingers on his arm and whispered:
  "Let's go down the back way, darling, and find Hannah." It was dark in the
  narrow passage that led to the kitchen. For a long moment they paused before
  opening the door, and were a little breathless when they emerged into the
  crowded service quarters where Hannah was calmly supervising the swarm of
  extra help. They waved a hand to her and she came quickly to meet them, her
  eyes shining.</p>

  <p>"Thanks for everything, Hannah," said Sally. "The dinner was simply
  perfect! The only thing lacking was you. We wanted you&mdash;sitting beside
  us. I wish you had been willing to do it, dear. We must run now. We came down
  to say good-bye."</p>

  <p>"And we love you&mdash;very much," added Peter, slipping an arm about her.
  He lowered his tone and bent to murmur into her ear: "We'll be thinking about
  you&mdash;always."</p>

  <p>"I'm so proud of you both." Hannah's voice was unsteady. They came into a
  tight little circle, entwining their arms.</p>

  <p>"Will you take good care of Sally, Peter?"</p>

  <p>"You know I will, Aunt Hannah. And when we're settled in Schenectady,
  you're to be out first guest. Promise? We've definitely planned on that.
  Haven't we, Sally?"</p>

  <p>"And you're to stay as long as you can stand the rations."</p>

  <p>"We must be off now," said Peter. He drew Hannah into his arms and kissed
  her tenderly. She reached up both hands, pressed her palms against his
  cheeks, searched his eyes earnestly and whispered: "Oh&mdash;my boy&mdash;I'm
  so happy for you!"</p>

  <p>Hot tears welled up into Sally's eyes.</p>

  <p>"We'll be writing you, darling," she promised.</p>

  <p>Hannah clung to them for another moment.</p>

  <p>"You both&mdash;belong to me," she said brokenly. "I'll be awfully
  lonesome." Then resolutely brightening: "Run along, now. Be good to each
  other." She followed them to the door, nervously stroking Peter's sleeve.</p>

  <p>Marcia, never more stunningly beautiful, turned to Mrs Edmunds.</p>

  <p>"Did you ever see a more handsome pair? We may as well admit it, just
  between us, my dear. They are absolutely incomparable! I think Peter is
  really the most divine-looking thing I ever saw; and, of course, I think that
  Sally&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is adorably lovely," agreed Lydia. "But why shouldn't she be, if you
  don't mind my saying it to your face."</p>

  <p>Marcia didn't mind.</p>

  <p>"I'll be calling you Lydia now, may I? We'll be wanting to see much of
  you. Not just because we're related&mdash;but because we really want
  you."</p>

  <p>Lydia smiled her thanks. Marcia glanced towards the hallway, noted that
  the crowd was moving out on to the veranda, and turned to say: "I think I'll
  run up and see if I can do anything for Sally."</p>

  <p>"They'll have to hurry, won't they?" said Lydia.</p>

  <p>Wallie gave Lucy Trimble's hand an affectionate squeeze as he passed her,
  and called to Roberta, slim and slinky in black satin: "Better get your coat,
  young fellow. You haven't enough on. It will be chilly down there."</p>

  <p>"I'm not going," drawled Roberta. "There'll be enough of a mob without
  me."</p>

  <p>Wallie screwed up his face reprovingly. Roberta grinned and nonchalantly
  patted an elaborately sleek black curl that circled the huge red eardrop,
  withdrew the long red cigarette-holder, and blew a leisurely exhalation into
  Wallie's eyes.</p>

  <p>"But what will Sally think?" he muttered.</p>

  <p>Roberta shrugged an angular shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Sally," she replied dryly, "won't be thinking."</p>

  <p>Sam Trimble, playing a next-of-kin role, gave the belated messenger boy a
  quarter and signed for the telegram.</p>

  <p>"Guess I'll read it," he remarked. "Make sure it isn't something that
  might upset anybody." He winked to Adele wickedly, and opened the message.
  "Ah&mdash;it's from Peter's Uncle Thomas. Congratulations&mdash;and so
  forth.... Well&mdash;as I was saying, Mrs Moore, it's the utilities that's
  going to get a sock in the jaw."</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;another bigger sock?" queried Adele complacently.</p>

  <p>"Sure!" Sam hooked an elbow over the banister and prepared to elucidate.
  "You see&mdash;it's this way&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Give me a light first, won't you? This sounds as if it's going to be
  hard."</p>

  <p>There was a commotion above, and Peter and Sally, hand in hand, came
  racing down in their going away clothes. The congestion about the front door
  eased to let them pass.</p>

  <p>Lydia opened her arms as Peter neared her and was gathered into an
  affectionate embrace. Then he kissed Marcia, a bit shyly, all but muffing it
  in the jostling pack. Sally hugged her parents. Paul slapped Peter on the
  back.</p>

  <p>"Come on!" commanded Wallie. "You'll miss your train!"</p>

  <p>They scurried out. Car doors slammed. Lights gleamed. Motors churned.
  Marcia and Lydia joined the racket outside and were showered with
  confetti.</p>

  <p>Hannah slipped quietly, quickly up the stairs.</p>

  <p>Paul and Eleanor, in the front doorway, followed her with their eyes; then
  exchanged an inquiring glance.</p>

  <p>"Run along up with her," said Eleanor soberly. "She ought to have someone
  with her. It's damned pitiful&mdash;if you ask me."</p>

  <p>"Why don't <i>you</i> go?" Paul studied her eyes. "You know all about
  it."</p>

  <p>"About <i>what?"</i></p>

  <p>"About <i>everything."</i></p>

  <p>Eleanor's lips slowly parted in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Do <i>you?"</i> she whispered.</p>

  <p>Paul nodded.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure?&mdash;<i>everything?"</i></p>

  <p>"Everything! And it isn't pitiful at all. And Hannah will prefer to be
  alone&mdash;to watch them go. She'll see it through. You can depend on that.
  Hannah is at her very best when there's a demand for&mdash;for private
  courage.... Well&mdash;there they go. God bless 'em!"</p>

  <p>Hannah turned off the light in Sally's disordered bedroom and ran to one
  of the front windows. She drew aside the curtain, her heart pounding hard.
  The cars were moving down the driveway and out into the street.</p>

  <p>She pressed her knuckles deeply into her trembling lips, dabbed at her
  eyes with the corner of her white apron, drew a whimpering little sob, bowed
  her head, and leaned limply for a moment against the casing.</p>

  <p>Then she straightened, wiped her eyes, took a deep breath, squared her
  shoulders&mdash;and smiled.</p>
