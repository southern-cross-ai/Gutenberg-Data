<h2>CHAPTER I - THE TRAVELLERS</h2>

<p>It was suspected of him by many that he had no heart.</p>

<p>Repeatedly he allows this suspicion to be perceived in the
course of those confessions of his upon which I drew so freely for
the story of the first part of his odd life. In the beginning of
that story we see him turning his back, at the dictates of
affection, upon an assured career in the service of Privilege. At
the end of it we see him forsaking the cause of the people in which
he had prospered and, again at the dictates of affection,
abandoning the great position won.</p>

<p>Of the man who twice within the first twenty-eight years of his
life, deliberately, in the service of others, destroys his chances
of success, it is foolish to say that he has no heart. But it was
the whim of Andr&eacute;-Louis Moreau to foster this illusion. His
imagination had early been touched by the teaching of Epictetus,
and deliberately he sought to assume the characteristics of a
Stoic: one who would never permit his reason to be clouded by
sentiment, or his head to be governed by his heart.</p>

<p>He was, of course, by temperament an actor. It was as
Scaramouche, and as author, player and organizer of the Binet
Troupe that he had found his true vocation. Persisting in it his
genius might have won him a renown greater than the combined
renowns of Beaumarchais and Talma. Desisting from it, however, he
had carried his histrionic temperament into such walks of life as
he thereafter trod, taking the world for his stage.</p>

<p>Such temperaments are common enough, and commonly they are
merely tiresome.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis Moreau, however, succeeds in winning our
interest by the unexpectedness of what he somewhere frankly and
fantastically calls his exteriorizations. His gift of laughter is
responsible for this. The comic muse is ever at his elbow, though
not always obvious. She remained with him to the end, although in
this, the second part of his history, his indulgence of the old
humour is fraught with a certain bitterness in a measure as the
conviction is borne in upon him that in the madness of the world
there is more evil than was perceived even by those philosophers
who have sought to teach it sanity.</p>

<p>His flight from Paris at a moment when, as a man of State, a
great career was opening before him, was a sacrifice dictated by
the desire to procure the safety of those he loved: Aline de
Kercadiou, whom he hoped to marry; Monsieur de Kercadiou, his
godfather; and Madame de Plougastel, whose natural son it had been
so lately discovered to him that he was. That flight was effected
without adventure. Every barrier was removed by the passport
carried by the Representative Andr&eacute;-Louis Moreau, which
announced that he travelled on the business of the National
Assembly, commanded all to lend him such assistance as he might
require, and warned all that they hindered him at their peril.</p>

<p>The berline conveying them travelled by way of Rheims but
continuing eastward it began to find the roads increasingly
encumbered by troops, gun-carriages, service-wagons and
commissariat trains and all the unending impedimenta of an army on
the march.</p>

<p>So as to make progress, they were constrained to turn north,
towards Charleville, and thence east again, crossing the lines of
the National Army, still commanded by Luckner and La Fayette, which
awaited the enemy who for over a month now had been massing on the
banks of the Rhine.</p>

<p>It was this definite movement of invasion which had driven the
populace of France to frenzy. The storming of the Tuileries by the
mob, and the horrors of the 10th of August gave the answer of the
populace to the pompous minatory ill-judged manifesto bearing the
signature of the Duke of Brunswick, but whose real authors were
Count Fersen and the rash Queen. By its intemperate menaces this
manifesto contributed more perhaps than any other cause to the ruin
of the King whom it was framed to save, for the Duke of Brunswick's
threats to the people of France made the King appear in the guise
of a public danger.</p>

<p>This, however, was not the point of view of Monsieur de
Kercadiou, Lord of Gavrillac, travelling under the revolutionary
aegis of his godson to safety beyond the Rhine. In the
uncompromising expressions of the Duke, Quentin de Kercadiou heard
the voice of the man who is master of the situation, who promises
no more than it is within his power to perform. What resistance
could those raw, ill-clad, ill-nourished, ill-equipped,
ill-trained, ill-armed troops through whose straggling lines they
had passed, offer to the magnificent army of seventy thousand
Prussians and fifty thousand Austrians, fortified by twenty-five
thousand French &eacute;migr&eacute;s, including the very flower of
French chivalry?</p>

<p>The Br&eacute;ton nobleman's squat figure reclined at greater
ease on the cushions of the travelling carriage after his glimpse
of the ragged ill-conditioned forces of the Nation. Peace entered
his soul, and cast out anxiety. Before the end of the month the
allies would be in Paris. The revolutionary carnival was all but at
an end. There would follow for those gentlemen of the gutter a
period of Lent and penitence. He expressed himself freely in these
terms, his glance upon the Citizen-Representative Moreau, as if
challenging contradiction.</p>

<p>"If ordnance were all," said Andr&eacute;-Louis, "I should agree
with you. But battles are won by wits as well as guns and the wits
of the man who uttered the Duke's manifesto do not command my
respect."</p>

<p>"Ah! And La Fayette, then? Is that a man of genius?" The Lord of
Gavrillac sneered.</p>

<p>"We do not know. He has never commanded an army in the field. It
may be that he will prove no better than the Duke of
Brunswick."</p>

<p>They came to Diekirch, and found themselves in a swarm of
Russians, the advance-guard of the Prince of Hohenlohe's division
which was to move upon Thionville and Metz, soldiers, these
well-equipped, masterful, precisely disciplined, different indeed
from those poor straggling ragamuffins who were to dispute their
passage.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis had removed the tricolour sash from his
olive-green riding-coat and the tricolour cockade from his conical
black hat. His papers, a passport to service in France, but here a
passport to the gallows, were bestowed in an inner pocket of his
tightly-buttoned waistcoat, and now it was Monsieur de Kercadiou
who took the initiative, announcing his name and quality to the
allied officers, so as to obtain permission to pass on. It was
readily yielded. Challenges were little more than an empty
formality. Émigrés were still arriving, although no longer in their
former numbers, and, anyway, the allies had nothing to apprehend
from anyone passing behind their lines.</p>

<p>The weather had broken, and by sodden roads which almost hourly
grew heavier, the horses fetlocks deep in mud, they came by
Wittlieb, where they lay a night at a fair inn, and then with
clearer skies overhead and a morass underfoot they trailed up the
fertile valley of the Moselle by miles of dripping vineyards, whose
yield that year gave little promise.</p>

<p>And so, at long length, a full week after setting out, the
berline rolled past the Ehrenbreitstein with its gloomy fortress,
and rumbled over the bridge of boats into the city of Coblentz.</p>

<p>And now it was Madame de Plougastel's name that proved their
real passport for hers was a name well-known in Coblentz. Her
husband, Monsieur de Plougastel, was a prominent member of the
excessive household by means of which the Princes maintained in
exile an ultra-royal state, rendered possible by a loan from
Amsterdam bankers and the bounty of the Elector of Treves.</p>

<p>The Lord of Gavrillac pursuing habits which had become instinct
alighted his party at the town's best inn, the Three Crowns. True,
the National Convention, which was to confiscate the estates of
emigrated noblemen, had not yet come into being, but meanwhile
those estates and their revenues were inaccessible, and the Lord of
Gavrillac's possessions amounted to some twenty <i>louis</i> which
chance had left him at the moment of departure. To this might be
added the clothes in which he stood and some trinkets upon the
person of Aline. The berline itself belonged to Madame de
Plougastel, as did the trunks in the boot. Madame practising
foresight had brought away a casket containing all her jewels,
which at need should realize a handsome sum. Andr&eacute;-Louis had
left with thirty <i>louis</i> in his purse. But he had borne all
the expenses of the journey and these had already consumed a third
of that modest sum.</p>

<p>Money, however, had never troubled the easy-going existence of
the Lord of Gavrillac. It had never been necessary for him to do
more than command whatever he required. So he commanded now the
best that the inn could provide in accommodation, food and
wine.</p>

<p>Had they arrived in Coblentz a month ago, they must have
conceived themselves still in France, for so crowded had the place
been with &eacute;migr&eacute;s that hardly any language but French
was to be heard in the streets, whilst the suburb of Thal, across
the river, had been an armed camp of Frenchmen. Now that the army
had at last departed on its errand of extinguishing the revolution
and restoring to the monarchy all its violated absolutism, the
French population of Coblentz, as of other Rhineland towns, had
been reduced by some thousands. Many, however, still remained with
the Princes. They were temporarily back at Sch&ouml;nbornlust, the
handsome, magnificent Electoral summer residence which Clemens
Wenceslaus had placed at the disposal of his royal nephews: the two
brothers of the King, the Comte de Provence and the Comte d'Artois,
and the King's uncle, the Prince de Conde.</p>

<p>In return the Elector's generosity had been abused and his
patience sorely tried.</p>

<p>Each of the three Princes had come accompanied by his mistress,
and one by his wife as well, and they had brought into Saxony,
together with the elegancies, all the ribaldries, the gallantries
and the intriguings of Versailles.</p>

<p>Cond&eacute;, the only one of any military worth&mdash;and his
military worth and reputation were considerable&mdash;had
established himself at Worms and had organized there into an army
the twenty-five thousand Frenchmen who had gone to range themselves
under his banner for the crusade on behalf of Throne and Altar.</p>

<p>Monsieur and his brother the Comte d'Artois, however, were not
only the true representatives of royalty to these exiles, but the
enemies of the constitution which the King had accepted, and the
champions of all the ancient privileges the abolition of which had
been the whole aim of the original revolutionists. It was about
these Princes at Coblentz that a Court had assembled itself,
maintained at enormous cost at Sch&ouml;nbornlust for his royal
nephews by their long-suffering host. Their followers with their
wives and families disposed themselves in such lodgings as the town
offered and their means afforded. At first money had been
comparatively plentiful amongst them, and they had spent it with
the prodigality of folk who had never learnt to take thought for
the morrow. In that time of waiting they had beguiled their leisure
in the carefree occupations that were habitual to them. They had
turned the Bonn Road into an image of the Cours la Reine. They rode
and walked, gossiped, danced, gambled, made love, intrigued, and
even fought duels in despite of the Electoral edicts. Nor was that
all the scandal they gave. The license they permitted themselves
was so considerable that the kindly old Elector had been driven to
complain that the morals of his own people were being corrupted by
the unseemly conduct, the insolent bearing, the debauched habits
and the religious indifference of the French nobility. He even
ventured to suggest to the Princes that, example being so much more
powerful than precept, they should set their own houses in
order.</p>

<p>With eyebrows raised at an outlook so narrow and provincial, his
nephews pointed out to him in turn that the life of a prince is
never so orderly as when he has acquired a
ma&icirc;tresse-en-titre. And the gentle, indulgent old archbishop
could not find it in his heart to distress his royal nephews by
further insistence.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Kercadiou and his party reached Coblentz at noon on
the 18th of August. Having dined and made such toilet as was
possible to men without change of garments, they re-entered the
still bespattered berline, and set out for the Ch&acirc;teau, a
mile away.</p>

<p>The fact that they came straight from Paris, whence there had
been no news for the past ten days, ensured them instant audience.
By a broad staircase kept by glittering gold-laced officers and a
spacious gallery above, where courtiers sauntered, elegant of
manner, vivacious of speech, and ready of laughter as in the Oeil
de Boeuf at Versailles of old, the newcomers were brought to an
ante-chamber by a gentleman usher, who went forward to announce
them.</p>

<p>Even now that the majority of men had departed with the army,
there still remained here a sufficient throng, made up of the
outrageous retinue which these Princes insisted upon maintaining.
Prudence in expenditure, the husbanding of their borrowed
resources, was not for them.</p>

<p>After all, they still believed that the insubordination of the
French masses was but a fire of straw which even now the Duke of
Brunswick was marching to extinguish, a fire which could never have
been kindled but for the supineness, the incompetence, the
jacobinism of the King, to whom in their hearts these
&eacute;migr&eacute;s were no longer loyal. Their fealty was to
their own order, which within a few weeks now would be restored.
The Duke's manifesto told the canaille what to expect. It should be
to them as the writing on the wall to the Babylonians.</p>

<p>Our travellers made for a while a little group apart:
Andr&eacute;-Louis, slight and straight in his olive-green
riding-coat with silver buttons, the sword through the pocket, his
buckskins and knee-boots, his black hair gathered into a queue that
was innocent of any roll; Monsieur de Kercadiou, in black and
silver, rather crumpled, squat of figure, and middle-aged with the
slightly furtive manner of a man who had never accustomed himself
to numerous assemblies; Madame de Plougastel, tall and calm,
dressed with a care that set off her fading beauty, her gentle
wistful eyes more observant of her natural son Andr&eacute;-Louis
than of her surroundings; and Aline de Kercadiou, slight, virginal
and lovely in a rose brocade, her golden hair dressed high, her
blue eyes half-shyly taking stock of her surroundings.</p>

<p>They attracted no attention until a gentleman issuing from the
presence chamber, the salon d'honneur, made his way briskly towards
them. This gentleman, no longer young, of middle height, inclining
to portliness, moved even in his present haste with an air of
consequence which left no doubt of the opinion which he held
himself. He was resplendent in yellow brocade and glittered at
several points.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis had an intuition of his identity before he
reached them, before he was bending formally over the hand of
Madame de Plougastel, and announcing in an utterly emotionless
voice his satisfaction at beholding her at last in safety.</p>

<p>"It was by no wish of mine, madame, as I think you are aware,
that you remained so long in Paris. It would have been better, I
think, for both of us had you decided to make the journey sooner.
Now it was scarce worth the trouble. For very soon, following in
Monsieur's train, I should have come to you. However, I give you
welcome. I hope that you are well. I trust that you will have
traveled comfortably."</p>

<p>Thus, in stilted, pompous phrases, did the Count of Plougastel
receive his Countess. Without pausing for any reply from her, he
swung half-aside. "Ah, my dear Gavrillac! Ever the attentive
cousin, the faithful cavalier, is it not?"</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis wondered was he sneering, watched him
narrowly as he pressed Kercadiou's hand, and found himself there
and then moved to a profound dislike for this consequential
gentleman with the big head on its short thick neck, the big nose
that was Bourbon in shape and the chin too big for strength but not
for obstinacy when considered with the stupid mouth.</p>

<p>"And this is your adorable niece," the gentleman was continuing.
He had a curiously purring voice and an affected enunciation. "You
have grown in beauty and in stature, Mademoiselle Aline, since last
we met." He looked at Andr&eacute;-Louis, and checked, frowning, as
if in question.</p>

<p>"This is my godson," said the Lord of Gavrillac shortly,
withholding a name that had become a thought too famous.</p>

<p>"Your godson?" The black eyebrows were raised on that shallow
brow. "Ah!"</p>

<p>Then others, having realized Madame de Plougastel's identity,
came crowding, chattering about them, with rustle of silken skirts
and tapping of red-heeled shoes, until the Count, remembering the
august personage awaiting the travellers, rescued them from that
frivolous throng, and ushered them into the presence.</p>

<hr align="center" width="50%">
<a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>
<h2>CHAPTER II - SCH&Ouml;NBORNLUST</h2>

<p>Wondering was his own attendance either necessary or desirable,
but yielding to Monsieur de Kercadiou's gentle insistence,
Andr&eacute;-Louis found himself in a spacious pillared room that
was lighted by very tall windows. A beam of pallid sunshine,
breaking through heavy clouds, touched into vividness the colours
of the soft Aubusson carpet, glinted on the profuse gildings
against their white background, and sparkled in the great crystal
chandelier that hung from the painted ceiling.</p>

<p>In a gilded armchair, from either side of which a flock of
courtiers of both sexes was spread fanwise athwart the chamber,
Andr&eacute;-Louis observed a portly florid man in the middle
thirties, dressed in grey velvet finely laced in gold with the blue
ribbon of the Holy Ghost across his breast.</p>

<p>Without having yet reached the pronounced obesity of his brother
Louis XVI, which in time he was to exceed, the Count of Provence
already showed every sign of the same tendency. He had the big
Bourbon nose, a narrow brow, whence his face widened downwards to a
flabby double chin, and the full, excessively curling lips of the
sensualist. The blue eyes were full and fine under heavy smoothly
arching eyebrows. He had a look of alertness without intelligence,
of importance without dignity. And observing him,
Andr&eacute;-Louis read him accurately for stupid, obstinate and
vain.</p>

<p>The slight woman in white and blue sarcenet with the pumpkin
head-dress, hovering on his right, was the Countess of Provence. At
no time attractive, her countenance now almost repelled by its
sneering air of discontent. The younger woman on his left, who if
also without conspicuous beauty of features was agreeably formed
and of a lively expression, was the Countess of Balbi, his
recognized mistress.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Plougastel led his Countess forward. Monsieur
inclined his powdered head, mumbling a greeting, his eyes dull.
They quickened, however, when Mademoiselle de Kercadiou was
presented. They seemed to glow as they took stock of her delicate
golden loveliness, and the curl of the gross lips was increased
into a smile.</p>

<p>"We give you welcome, mademoiselle. Soon we shall hope to
welcome you to a worthier court, such as you were born to
grace."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle curtsied again with a murmured "Monseigneur," and
would have withdrawn but that he detained her.</p>

<p>It was amongst his vanities to conceive himself something of a
poet, and he chose now to be poetical.</p>

<p>How was it possible, he desired to know, that so fair a bloom
from the garden of French nobility should never yet have come to
adorn the court?</p>

<p>She answered him with commendable composure that five years ago,
under the sponsorship of her uncle, Etienne de Kercadiou, she had
spent some months at Versailles.</p>

<p>His highness protested his annoyance with himself and Fate that
he should have been unaware of this. He desired Heaven to inform
him how such a thing should ever have come to pass. And then he
spoke of her uncle Etienne, whom he had so greatly esteemed and
whose death he had never ceased to deplore. In this he was truthful
enough. There was a weakness in him which made him ever seek to
lean upon some particular person in his following, rendering a
favourite as much a necessity to him as a mistress. For a time this
place had been filled by Etienne de Kercadiou, who, had he lived,
might have continued to fill it, for Monsieur had this virtue that
he was loyal and steadfast in his friendships.</p>

<p>He detained her yet a while in aimless talk, whilst those about
him, perceiving here no more than an exhibition of gallantry in a
man whose callow ambition it was ever to appear in the guise of a
gallant, grew impatient for the news from Paris which was expected
from the men accompanying her.</p>

<p>Madame smiled sourly, and whispered in the ear of her reader,
the elderly Madame de Gourbillon. The Countess of Balbi smiled too
but it was the indulgent, humorous smile of a woman who if without
illusions is also without bitterness.</p>

<p>In the immediate background the Lord of Gavrillac waited with
his hands behind him, nodding his great head, the light of
satisfaction on his rugged pock-marked countenance to see his niece
honoured by so much royal notice. At his side Andr&eacute;-Louis
stood stiff and grim, inwardly damning the impudence with which his
highness smirked and leered at Aline before the entire court. It
was, he supposed, within the exercise of a royal prerogative to be
reckless of what scandal he might cause.</p>

<p>It may have resulted from this that when at last the Lord of
Gavrillac having been presented and required to announce the latest
news from Paris, begged leave to depute the task to his godson,
there sprang from Andr&eacute;-Louis' resentment a self-possession
so hard and cold as to be almost ruffling to the feelings of those
present.</p>

<p>His bow in acknowledgment of Monsieur's nod was scarcely more
than perfunctory. Then erect, the lean keen face impassive, his
voice metallic, he delivered the brutal news without any softening
terms.</p>

<p>"A week yesterday, on the tenth of the month, the populace of
Paris, goaded to frenzy by the manifesto of the Duke of Brunswick
and driven to terror by the news of a foreign army already on the
soil of France, turned with the blind ferocity of an animal at bay.
It stormed the Palace of the Tuileries and massacred to a man the
Swiss Guard and the gentleman who had remained there to defend the
person of his Majesty."</p>

<p>An outcry of horror interrupted him. Monsieur had heaved himself
to his feet. His countenance had lost much of its high colour.</p>

<p>"And the King?" he quavered. "The King?"</p>

<p>"His Majesty and the royal family found shelter under the
protection of the National Assembly."</p>

<p>An awed silence ensued, broken presently by Monsieur's
impatience.</p>

<p>"What else, sir? What else?"</p>

<p>"The Sections of Paris appear to be at present the masters of
the State. It is doubtful if the National Assembly can stand
against them. They control the populace. They direct its fury into
such channels as seems best to them."</p>

<p>"And that is all you know, sir? All you can tell us?"</p>

<p>"That is all, monseigneur."</p>

<p>The large prominent eyes continued to survey him, if without
hostility, without kindliness.</p>

<p>"Who are you, sir? What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Moreau, highness. Andr&eacute;-Louis Moreau."</p>

<p>It was a plebeian name, awakening no memories in that elegant,
frivolous world of woefully short memories.</p>

<p>"Your condition, sir?"</p>

<p>For Kercadiou, Aline and Madame de Plougastel the moment was
charged with suspense. It was so easy for Andr&eacute;-Louis to
avoid, as they hoped, full revelation. But he showed himself
contemptuous of subterfuge.</p>

<p>"Until lately, until a week ago, I represented the Third Estate
of Ancenis in the National Assembly."</p>

<p>He felt rather than perceived the horrified inward recoil from
him of every person present.</p>

<p>"A patriot!" said Monsieur, much as he might have said "a
pestilence."</p>

<p>Monsieur de Kercadiou came breathlessly to his godson's rescue.
"Ah, but, Monsieur, one who has seen the error of his ways. One who
is now proscribed. He has sacrificed everything to his sense of
duty to me, his godfather. He has rescued Madame de Plougastel, my
niece and myself from that shambles."</p>

<p>Monsieur looked at the Lord of Gavrillac, at the Countess of
Plougastel, and lastly at Aline. He found Mademoiselle de
Kerrcadiou's glance full of intercession, and it seemed to soften
him.</p>

<p>"You would add, mademoiselle?" he invited gently.</p>

<p>She was troubled. "Why...why only that considering his
sacrifice, I hope that Monsieur Moreau will deserve well of your
Highness. He cannot now return to France."</p>

<p>Monsieur inclined his fleshly head. "We will remember that only.
That we are in his debt for this. It will lie with Monsieur Moreau
to make it possible for us in the time that is fast approaching to
discharge this debt."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis said nothing. In the hostile eyes that were
bent upon him from every side his calm seemed almost insolent. Yet
two eyes in that assembly considered him with interest and without
hostility. They belonged to a stiffly-built man of middle height
and not more than thirty years of age, plainly dressed without
fripperies: a man with a humorous mouth above an aggressive chin,
and a prominent nose flanked by lively, quick-moving dark eyes
under heavy brows.</p>

<p>Presently, when the court had broken into groups to discuss this
dreadful news from Paris, and Andr&eacute;-Louis, ignored, had
withdrawn into one of the window embrasures, this man approached
him.</p>

<p>He carried a three-cornered hat with a white cockade, tucked
under his right arm. His left hand rested on the steel hilt of his
slim sword.</p>

<p>He came to a halt before Andr&eacute;-Louis.</p>

<p>"Ah, Monsieur Moreau! Or is it Citizen Moreau?"</p>

<p>"Why, which you please, monsieur," said Andr&eacute;-Louis,
alert.</p>

<p>"'Monsieur' will accord better with our environment." He spoke
with a soft, slurred accent, almost like a Spaniard, thus
proclaiming his Gascon origin. "Once, unless my memory betrays me,
you were better known by yet another title. The Paladin of the
Third Estate, was it not?"</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis was not abashed. "That was in 'eighty-nine,
at the time of the spadassinicides."</p>

<p>"Ah!" The Gascon smiled. "Your admission is of a piece with the
rest. I am of those who can admire gallantry wherever found. I love
a gallant enemy as I loathe a flabby friend."</p>

<p>"You have also a taste for paradox."</p>

<p>"If you will. You made me regret that I was not a member of the
Constituent Assembly, so that I might have crossed blades with you
when you made yourself the militant champion of the Third
Estate."</p>

<p>"You are tired of life?" said Andr&eacute;-Louis, who began to
mistrust the gentleman's motives.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, mon petit. I love life so intensely that I
must be getting its full savour; and that is only to be got when it
is placed in hazard. Without that"&mdash;he shrugged&mdash;"as well
might one be born an ox."</p>

<p>The declaration, thought Andr&eacute;-Louis, was one that went
excellently with the man's accent.</p>

<p>"You are from Gascony, monsieur," he said.</p>

<p>Mock gravity overspread the other's intrepid countenance. "Po'
Cap de Diou!" he swore as if to leave no doubt on the score of his
origin. "Now that is an innuendo."</p>

<p>"I am always accommodating. It is to help you on your way."</p>

<p>"On my way? But on my way to what, name of God?"</p>

<p>"To live intensely by the thrill of placing your life in
hazard."</p>

<p>"You suppose that that is what I seek?" The Gascon fell to
fanning himself with his hat. "Almost you put me in a heat, sir."
He smiled. "I see the train of thought: this enemy camp; the
general hostility to your opinions overriding even the generous
thing you have done. There is no graciousness at court, sir, as any
fool may perceive once his eyes cease to be dazzled by its
superficial glitter. You gather that I am no man of courts. Let me
add that I am certainly not the bully-lackey of any party. I
desired, sir, to become acquainted with you. That is all. I am a
monarchist to the marrow of my bones, and I detest your republican
principles. Yet I admired your championship of the Third even more
than I abhorred the cause you championed. Paradoxical, as you say.
I am like that. You bore yourself as I should have wished to bear
myself in your place. Where the devil is the paradox after
all?"</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis was brought to the point of laughter. "You
meet my stupidity with graciousness, sir."</p>

<p>"Pish! I am not gracious. I but desire our better acquaintance.
My name is de Batz; Colonel Jean de Batz, Baron of Armanthieu, by
Gontz, which is in Gascony, as you have guessed. Though how the
devil you guessed it, God alone knows."</p>

<p>Monsieur de Kercadiou was ambling towards them. The Baron made a
leg, valedictorily. "Monsieur!"</p>

<p>And, "Serviteur!" said Andr&eacute;-Louis, with an answering
courtesy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III - BARON DE BATZ</h2>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis was annoyed; not hotly annoyed; he was never
that; but coldly bitter. He expressed it without tact considering
his audience.</p>

<p>"The more I see of the nobility, the better I like the canaille;
the more I see of royalty, the more I admire the roture."</p>

<p>They sat&mdash;Andr&eacute;-Louis, Aline and M. de
Kercadiou&mdash;in the long narrow room appropriated by the Lord of
Gavrillac on the first floor of the Three Crowns. It was a room
entirely Saxon in character. There was no carpet on the waxed
floor. The walls were lined in polished pine adorned with some
trophies of the chase: a half-dozen stags' heads, with melancholy
glass eyes, the mask of a boar with enormous tusks, a hunting horn,
an antiquated fowling-piece and some other kindred odds and ends.
On the oak table, from which a waiter had lately removed the
remains of breakfast, stood a crystal bowl containing a great sheaf
of roses with which some lilies had been intermingled.</p>

<p>These flowers provided one source of Andr&eacute;-Louis'
ill-humour. They had been brought from Sch&ouml;nbornlust an hour
ago by a very elegant, curled and pomaded gentleman, who announced
himself as Monsieur de Jaucourt. He had delivered them with
expressions of homage from Monsieur to Mademoiselle de Kercadiou,
in the hope&mdash;so ran the royal message&mdash;that they might
brighten the lodging graced by Mademoiselle until more suitable
quarters should be found for her. The quarters in prospect were
disclosed by a note of which M. de Jaucourt was also the bearer, a
note from Madame to Mademoiselle de Kercadiou. And this was the
second source of Andr&eacute;-Louis' annoyance. The note announced
that Mademoiselle de Kercadiou was appointed a lady-in-waiting to
Madame. Aline's bright transport at this signal and unexpected
honour had supplied Andr&eacute;-Louis' annoyance with yet a third
source.</p>

<p>With deliberate rudeness upon apprehending M. de Jaucourt's
mission, he had gone to take his stand by the window, with his back
to his companions, watching the rain that fell in sheets upon the
churned mud of Coblentz. He had not even troubled to turn when M.
de Jaucourt had taken ceremonious leave. It was M. de Kercadiou who
had held the door for the departing messenger.</p>

<p>And now when at last Andr&eacute;-Louis condescended to speak,
his slight, agile, well-knit body moving restlessly in the gloom
and damp chill of that long chamber, it was to interrupt Aline's
delighted chatter in those uncompromising terms.</p>

<p>She was startled, astounded. Her uncle was scandalized. In the
old days for the half of those words he would have risen up in
wrath, stormed upon his godson, and banished him from his presence.
But in the course of that journey from Paris a lethargy had been
settling upon the Lord of Gavrillac. His spirit was reduced. It was
as if, bending under the strain of the grim events of some ten days
ago, he had suddenly grown old. Nevertheless, he reared his great
head to combat this outrageous statement, and there was a note of
anger in his voice.</p>

<p>"While you live under the protection of the one and the other it
were more decent to repress these republican insolences." Aline
surveyed him with a little frown above her candid eyes.</p>

<p>"What has disgruntled you, Andr&eacute;?"</p>

<p>He looked down upon her across the table at which she was
seated, and worship rose in him, as it ever did when he considered
her, so fresh, so pure, so delicate, so dainty, her golden hair
dressed high, but innocent of powder, a heavy curl resting on the
right of her milk-white neck.</p>

<p>"I am fearful of all that approach you lest they go unaware of
the holy ground upon which they tread."</p>

<p>"And now we are to have the Song of Songs," her uncle mocked
him. Whilst Aline's eyes were tender, the Lord of Gavrillac pursued
his raillery.</p>

<p>"You think that M. de Jaucourt should have removed his shoes
before entering this shrine?"</p>

<p>"I should have preferred him to have stayed away. M. de Jaucourt
is the lover of Madame de Balbi, who is the mistress of Monsieur.
In what relationship those two gentleman stand to each other as a
consequence I'll not inquire. But their brows would help to adorn
that wall." And he flung out a hand to indicate the antlered heads
that gazed down upon them.</p>

<p>The Lord of Gavrillac shifted uncomfortably in his chair. "If
you would practise towards my niece half the respect you demand for
her from others it would be more decent." Severely he added: "You
stoop to scandal."</p>

<p>"No need to stoop. It comes breast-high. It assails the
nostrils."</p>

<p>Aline, whose innocence had been pierced at last by his allusion,
coloured a little and looked away from him. Meanwhile he pursued
his theme.</p>

<p>"Madame de Balbi is a lady-in-waiting upon Madame. And that,
monsieur, is the honour proposed for your niece and my future
wife."</p>

<p>"My God!" ejaculated M. de Kercadiou. "What will you insinuate?
You are horrible."</p>

<p>"It is the fact, sir, that is horrible. I merely interpret it.
It but remains for you to ask yourself if that vicious simulacrum
of a Court is a fitting environment for your niece."</p>

<p>"It would not be if I believed you."</p>

<p>"You don't believe me?" Andr&eacute;-Louis seemed surprised. "Do
you believe your own senses, then? Can you recall how the news was
received yesterday? How slight a ripple it made on the face of
waters which it should have lashed into a storm?"</p>

<p>"Well-bred people do not abandon themselves in their
emotions."</p>

<p>"But they are grave at least. Did you observe much gravity after
the first gasp of consternation? Did you, Aline?" Without giving
her time to answer, he went on. "Monsieur held you in talk for some
time; longer perhaps than Madame de Balbi relished..."</p>

<p>"Andr&eacute;! What are you saying? This is outrageous."</p>

<p>"Infamous!" said her uncle.</p>

<p>"I was about to ask you of what he talked. Was it of the horrors
of last week? Of the fate of the King, his brother?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Of what, then? Of what?"</p>

<p>"I scarcely remember. He talked of...oh, of nothing. He was very
kind...rather flattering...What would you? I...I...talked...Oh, he
talked as a gentleman talks to a lady, I suppose."</p>

<p>"You suppose?" He was grim. The lean face with its prominent
nose and cheek-bones was almost wolfish. "You are a lady, and you
have talked with gentlemen before. Did they all talk to you as he
talked?"</p>

<p>"Why, in some such fashion. Andr&eacute;, what is in your
mind?"</p>

<p>"Ay, in God's name, what?" barked M. de Kercadiou.</p>

<p>"It is in my mind that at such a time Monsieur might have found
other occupation than to talk to a lady merely as gentlemen talk to
ladies."</p>

<p>"You make one lose patience." said M. de Kercadiou gruffly.
"Once the shock of the news was spent, where was the cause for
anxiety? Within a month the allies will be at the gates of Paris,
and the King will be delivered."</p>

<p>"Unless the provocation makes the people kill him in the
meantime. There was always that for Monsieur to consider. And
anyway, it is in my mind that Aline should not be a lady-in-waiting
in a group that includes Madame de Balbi."</p>

<p>"But in Heaven's name, Andr&eacute;!" cried the Lord of
Gavrillac. "What can I do? This is not an invitation. It is a
command."</p>

<p>"Madame is not the Queen. Not yet."</p>

<p>"As good as the Queen here. Monsieur is regent de posse, and may
soon be so de facto."</p>

<p>"So that," said Andr&eacute; slowly, almost faltering, "the
appointment is not to be refused?"</p>

<p>Aline looked at him wistfully, but said nothing. He got up
abruptly, stalked to the window again, and stood there tapping the
pane and looked out as before upon the melancholy rain, a queer
oppression at his heart. Kercadiou, whose scowl bore witness to his
annoyance, would have spoken but that Aline signalled silence to
him.</p>

<p>She rose and crossed to Andr&eacute;'s side. She set her
muslin-clad arm about his neck, drew down his head and laid her
smooth, softly-rounded white cheek against his own. "Andr&eacute;!
Are you not being very foolish? Very difficult? Surely, surely, you
do not do me the honour of being jealous of Monsieur? Of
Monsieur!"</p>

<p>He was softened by the caress, by the intoxicating touch of her
so new to him still, so rarely savoured yet in this odd week of
their betrothal.</p>

<p>"My dear, you are so much to me that I am full of fears for you.
I dread the effect upon you of life in that Court, where corruption
is made to wear a brave exterior."</p>

<p>"But I have been to Court before," she reminded him. "To
Versailles, yes. But this is not Versailles, although it strives to
put on the same appearance."</p>

<p>"Do you lack faith in me?"</p>

<p>"Ah, not that. Not that!"</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>He frowned; searched his mind; found nothing definite there. "I
do not know," he confessed. "I suppose love makes me fearful,
foolish."</p>

<p>"Continue to be fearful and foolish, then." She kissed his cheek
and broke from him with a laugh, and thereby put an end to the
discussion.</p>

<p>That same afternoon Mademoiselle de Kercadiou entered upon her
exalted duties, and when later M. de Kercadiou and his godson
presented themselves at Sch&ouml;nbornlust, and stood once more
amid the courtiers in that white-and-gold salon, Aline, a vision of
loveliness in coral taffetas and silver lace, told them of the
graciousness of Madame's welcome and of the condescension of
Monsieur.</p>

<p>"He spoke to me at length of you, Andr&eacute;."</p>

<p>"Of me?" Andr&eacute;-Louis was startled.</p>

<p>"Your manner yesterday made him curious about you. He inquired
in what relationship we stood. I told him that we are affianced.
Then, because he seemed surprised, I told him something of your
history. How once you had represented your godfather in the States
of Brittany, where you were the most powerful advocate of the
nobility. How the killing of your friend Philippe de Vilmorin had
turned you into a revolutionary. How in the end you had turned
again, and at what sacrifice you had saved us and brought us out of
France. He regards you very favourably, Andr&eacute;."</p>

<p>"Ah? He said so?"</p>

<p>She nodded. "He said that you have a very resolute air, and that
he had judged you to be a bold, enterprising man."</p>

<p>"He meant to say that I am impudent and do not know my
place."</p>

<p>"Andr&eacute;!" she reproached him.</p>

<p>"Oh, he is right. I don't. I refuse to know it until it is a
place worth knowing."</p>

<p>A tall, spare gentleman in black approached them, a swarthy man
in the middle thirties, calm and assured of manner. His cheeks were
deeply scored with lines, and hollow, as if from loss of teeth.
This and the close set of his eyes lent a sinister air to the not
unhandsome face. He came, he announced, to seek the acquaintance of
Monsieur Moreau. Aline presented him as Monsieur le Comte
d'Entragues, a name already well-known for that of a daring,
resolute royalist agent, a man saturated with the spirit of
intrigue.</p>

<p>He made amiable small talk until the Countess of Provence, a
foolish artificial smile on her plain face, descended upon them.
Archly scolding them for seducing her new lady-in-waiting from her
duties, she swept Aline away and left the two men together. But
they were not long alone. M. le Comte d'Artois very deliberately
approached them, a tall, handsome man of thirty-five, so elegant of
shape and movement that it was difficult to believe that he sprang
from the same stock as his ponderous brothers, King Louis and
Monsieur de Provence.</p>

<p>He was attended by a half-dozen gentlemen, two of whom wore the
glittering green and silver with scarlet collars which was the
uniform of his own bodyguard. Among the others Andr&eacute;-Louis
beheld the sturdy, sardonic M. de Batz, who flashed him a smile of
friendly recognition, and the pompous countenance of M. de
Plougastel, who nodded frigidly.</p>

<p>Monsieur d'Artois, gravely courteous, his fine eyes intent,
expressed satisfaction at the presence here of Monsieur Moreau in
the happy circumstances which brought him. Soon Andr&eacute;-Louis
began to suspect that there was calculation in all this. For after
M. de Artois' compliments came a shrewd questioning from M.
d'Entragues on affairs in Paris and the movements and immediate
aims of the revolutionary circles.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis answered frankly and freely where he could
and with no sense of betraying anyone. In his heart he believed
that the information he supplied could no more change the course of
destiny than a weather-prophet's judgments can control the
elements. This frankness conveyed the impression that he served the
cause of the monarchists, and Monsieur d'Artois commended him for
it.</p>

<p>"You will permit me to rejoice, Monsieur Moreau, in that a
gentleman of your parts should have seen at last the error of his
ways."</p>

<p>"It is not the error of my ways that matter: or was
deplorable."</p>

<p>The dry answer startled them. "What then, monsieur?" asked the
King's brother, as dryly.</p>

<p>"The circumstance that those whose duty it is to enforce the
constitution so laboriously achieved, should be allowing their
power to slip into the hands of scoundrels who will enlist a
desperate rabble to gain them the ascendancy."</p>

<p>"So that you are but half a convert, Monsieur Moreau?" His
highness spoke slowly. He sighed. "A pity! You draw between two
sets of canaille a distinction too fine for me. I had thought to
offer you employment in the army. But since its aim is to sweep
away without discrimination your constitutional friends as well as
the others, I will not distress you with the offer."</p>

<p>He swung abruptly on his heel and moved away, his gentlemen
followed him, with the exception of Plougastel and de Batz; and of
these Monsieur de Plougastel at once made it plain that he had
lingered to condemn.</p>

<p>"You were ill-advised," he said, gloomily self-sufficient. "To
come to Coblentz, do you mean, monsieur?"</p>

<p>"To take that tone with his highness. It was...unwise. You have
ruined yourself."</p>

<p>"I am used to that. I have often done it."</p>

<p>Considering how Andr&eacute;-Louis had last ruined himself with
the revolutionaries and that Madame de Plougastel was one of those
for whose sake he had done it, the hit, if sly, was shrewd and
palpable.</p>

<p>"Ah, we know. We know your generosity, monsieur," Plougastel
made haste to amend in some slight confusion. "But this
was...wanton. A little tact, monsieur. A little reticence."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis looked him between the eyes. "I'll practise
it now with you, monsieur."</p>

<p>He wondered why he disliked so much this husband of the lady
whose natural son he knew himself to be. His first glimpse of him
had been almost enough to make Andr&eacute;-Louis understand and
excuse his mother's frailty. This dull, pompous, shallow man, who
lived by forms and ready-made opinions, incapable of independent
thought, could never have commanded the fidelity of any woman. The
marvel was not that Madame de Plougastel should have had a lover,
but that she should have confined herself to one. It was, thought
Andr&eacute;-Louis, a testimonial to her innate purity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Monsieur de Plougastel was being immensely,
ludicrously dignified.</p>

<p>"I suspect, sir, that you laugh at me. I am too deeply in your
debt to be in a position to resent it. You should remember that,
sir. You should remember that." And he sidled away, a man
offended.</p>

<p>"It's an ungrateful task, the giving of advice," said de Batz,
ironical.</p>

<p>"Too ungrateful to be worth undertaking uninvited."</p>

<p>De Batz checked, stared, then frankly laughed. "You are quick.
Sometimes too quick. As now. And it's as bad to be too soon as too
late. As a fencing-master, you should know that. The secret of
success in life as in swordsmanship lies in a proper timing."</p>

<p>"All this will have a meaning," said Andr&eacute;-Louis.</p>

<p>"Why, that I had no notion of offering advice. I never give
unless I am sure of being thanked."</p>

<p>"I hope that you do yourself less than justice."</p>

<p>"Faith, I hope so too. You goad a man. You would make it almost
a pleasure to quarrel with you."</p>

<p>"Few have found it so. Is that your aim, Monsieur de Batz?"</p>

<p>"Oh! Far from it, I assure you." The Gascon smiled. "From what
you said to M. d'Artois just now I gather that you are at least a
monarchist."</p>

<p>"If I am anything at all, monsieur, which I sometimes doubt. I
wrought, of course, with those who sought to give France a
constitution, to set up a constitutional monarchy akin to that
which governs England. There was nothing hostile to the King in
this. Indeed, his majesty, himself, has always professed to favour
the idea."</p>

<p>"Whereby his majesty became unpopular with Messieurs his
brothers here and with the nobles, so that some thirty thousand of
them who support absolutism and privilege have emigrated and have
set up here a new court. France to-day is a little like the Papacy
when it had two sees, one in Rome and one in Avignon. This is the
stronghold of absolutism, and since you not only are an enemy of
absolutism but have actually divulged the fact, there is nothing
for you to do here. You have, in fact been told so by M.
d'Artois.</p>

<p>"Now it is not good for an able and enterprising young man to be
without employment. And for a monarchist abundant work is waiting
at this moment."</p>

<p>The Baron paused, his keen eyes on Andr&eacute;-Louis' face.
"Continue, pray, monsieur."</p>

<p>"It is kind of you to wish to hear me further." M. de Batz
looked about him. They stood in mid-apartment, cleaving as it were
the stream of sauntering courtiers. Away on their right, by the
great marble fireplace, Monsieur, in dark blue, with a star of
diamonds sparkling on his breast, sprawled untidily in an armchair.
Idly he had thrust the ferrule of his cane into the inner side of
his left shoe, and he was prodding with it there whilst
entertaining a group of ladies in a conversation too gay and lively
to be concerned with the heavy matters of the hour. Ever and anon
his laugh would float across the room. It was the loud,
unrestrained laugh of a foolish man; such a laugh as that which in
his brother Louis XVI had offended the fine susceptibilities of the
Marquise de L&acirc;ge, and there was a false note in it to the
sensitive ears of Andr&eacute;-Louis. He considered that he would
not trust either the intelligence or the sentiments of a man with
such a laugh. He frowned to see Aline foremost in the group, which
included the Countess of Balbi, the Duchess of Caylus and the
Countess of Montl&eacute;art; he was irritated by the expression in
the eyes which Monsieur continually bent upon Aline and by Aline's
apparent satisfaction in this royal notice.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Batz took him by the arm. "Let us move where we
shall be less in the way and better able to talk."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis suffered himself to be steered into the
embrasure of a window that overlooked the courtyard, where
carriages of every kind and description waited. The rain had ceased
and again, as yesterday at this hour, the sun was struggling to
pierce the heavy clouds.</p>

<p>"The King's position," M. de Batz was saying, "is grown
extremely precarious. He will have come to realize the wisdom of
the emigration of his brothers and the nobles which he condemned
when it took place. No doubt he realized it when he attempted to
follow them only to be turned back at Varennes. He will be ready
enough, therefore, to be fetched away now if it can be contrived.
As a monarchist, Monsieur Moreau, you should desire to see the
monarch out of peril. Would you be prepared to labour to contrive
it?"</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis took time to reply.</p>

<p>"Such a labour as that should be well rewarded."</p>

<p>"Rewarded? You do not believe, then, that virtue is its own
reward?"</p>

<p>"Experience has shown me that the virtuous commonly perish of
want."</p>

<p>The Baron seemed disappointed. "For so young a man you are oddly
cynical."</p>

<p>"You mean that my perceptions are not clouded by
emotionalism."</p>

<p>"I mean, sir, that you are not even consistent. You announce
yourself a monarchist, yet you remain indifferent to the fate of
the monarch."</p>

<p>"Because my monarchism is not personal to Louis XVI. It is the
office that matters, not the holder. King Louis XVI may perish, but
there will still be a king in France, even if he does not
reign."</p>

<p>The dark face of de Batz was grave. "You take a great many
words, sir, merely to say 'no'. You disappoint me. I had conceived
you a man of action, a man of bold enterprises. You reveal yourself
as merely...academic."</p>

<p>"There must be theory behind all practice, M. de Batz. I do not
quite know what you propose to do or how you propose to do it. But
the task is not one for me."</p>

<p>De Batz looked sour. "So be it. But I'll not conceal my regret.
It may not surprise you, sir, incredible though it may seem, that I
cannot find here a dozen gentlemen to engage with me in this
enterprise. When I heard you announce yourself a monarchist I took
heart, for you would be worth a score of these fribbles to me. I
might rake all France and never find a man more apt to my
need."</p>

<p>"You are pleased to flatter me, M. de Batz."</p>

<p>"Indeed, no. You have the qualities which the task demands. And
you will not lack for friends among those in power, who would help
you out of a difficult situation if you should fall into one."</p>

<p>But Andr&eacute;-Louis shook his head. "You overrate both my
qualities and my influence with my late associates. As I have said,
sir, the task is not one for me."</p>

<p>"Ah! A pity!" said de Batz frigidly, and moved away, leaving
Andr&eacute;-Louis with the impression that he had missed the only
chance of making a friend that was offered him at
Sch&ouml;nbornlust.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV - THE REVOLUTIONARY.</h2>

<p>THE days dragged on at Coblentz&mdash;days of waiting in which
the hours were leaden-footed&mdash;their monotony intensified for
Andr&eacute;-Louis by the persistent foulness of the weather, which
kept him within doors.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Kercadiou, however, was scarcely aware of it.
Her beauty, liveliness and amiability, winning the commendation of
all, had justified the warmth of her welcome at court. With
Monsieur and Madame alike she was in high favour and even Madame de
Balbi was observed to use her with great consideration, whilst of
the men about the Princes it was said that one-half at least were
in love with her and in hot rivalry to serve her.</p>

<p>It was a state of things that made for the happiness of
everybody but Andr&eacute;-Louis, doomed to idleness and
aimlessness in this environment into which he had been thrust, but
in which there seemed to be no place or part for him. And then
abruptly something happened which at last provided him with
occupation for his wits.</p>

<p>He was taking the air one evening when it was so foul underfoot
that only his restlessness could have sent him abroad. The wind had
dropped and the air was close. On the heights of Pfaffendorf,
across the Rhine, the green of the woods was lividly metallic
against a sullen background of storm-clouds. He trudged on,
following the yellow, swollen river, past the bridge of boats, with
the mass of Ehrenbreitstein beyond and the grim fortress, like some
grey, sprawling, ever-vigilant monster. He reached the confluence
that gives Coblentz its name, and turning to the left followed now
the tributary Moselle. Dusk was upon the narrow ways of the Alter
Graben when he reached them. He turned a corner into a street that
led directly to the Liebfrauenkirche, and came face to face with a
man who at close quarters checked in his stride, to pause for an
instant, then brushed swiftly past him and went on at an
accelerated pace.</p>

<p>It was so odd that Andr&eacute;-Louis halted there and swung
about. Four things he had sensed: that this man, whoever he might
be, had recognized him; that the meeting had taken him by surprise;
that he had been about to speak; and that he had changed his mind,
and then quickened his step so as to avoid a disclosure of himself.
Nor was this all. Whilst Andr&eacute;-Louis' face under the
narrow-brimmed conical hat was still discernible in the fading
daylight, the other's was in the masking shadow of a wide castor,
and as if that were not enough he wore a cloak that muffled him to
the nose.</p>

<p>Moved by curiosity and suspicion to go after him,
Andr&eacute;-Louis overtook him in a dozen swift strides, and was
tapping him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"A word with you, my friend. I think we should know each
other."</p>

<p>The man bounded forward and round, loosening his cloak and
disengaging his arms from its folds. In the very act of turning he
whipped out a small sword, and presented the point at
Andr&eacute;-Louis' breast.</p>

<p>"At your peril!" His voice was muffled by the cloak. "Be off,
you footpad, before I put half a yard of steel in your
entrails."</p>

<p>Being unarmed, Andr&eacute;-Louis hesitated for a couple of
heartbeats. Then he played a trick that he had practised and taught
in his fencing-master days in the Rue du Hasard, an easy trick if
resolutely performed, but fatal to the performer if in the course
of it he hesitates. With a rigid extended arm he knocked aside the
blade, engaging it at the level of his elbow; swiftly continuing
the movement, as if in a counterparry, he partially enveloped it,
seized the hilt by the quillons, and wrenched the weapon away.
Almost before the other could realize what had happened he found
the point of his own sword presented to his vitals.</p>

<p>"To take me for a footpad is a poor pretence. You wear too many
clothes for an honest man on so warm an evening. Let us look at
this face of yours, my friend." Andr&eacute;-Louis leaned forward,
and with his left hand pulled away the masking cloak, peering into
the face which showed white under the shadow of the wide hat.
Instantly, in recognition, he fell back, dropping the point of the
sword and exclaiming in his profound amazement.</p>

<p>Before him stood the Representative Isaac Le Chapelier, that
lawyer of Rennes who, having begun by being amongst
Andr&eacute;-Louis' most active enemies, had ended by being in many
respects his closest friend, the protector whose encouragement and
sponsorship had resulted in his election to the National Assembly.
To meet this distinguished revolutionary, who once had occupied the
Assembly's presidential chair, lurking here in a by-street of
Coblentz in obvious fear of detection was the last thing that
Andr&eacute;-Louis could have expected. When he had conquered his
astonishment he was moved to laughter.</p>

<p>"On my life, yours is an odd way to greet an old friend, Isaac!
Half a yard of steel in my entrails, eh?" On a sudden thought he
asked: "Have you come after me by any chance?"</p>

<p>Le Chapelier's answer was scornful. "After you? My God! You
think yourself of consequence if you suppose that a member of the
Assembly is sent to fetch you back."</p>

<p>"I did not ask you were you sent. I wondered if you had come out
of the love you bear me, or some such weakness. If that is not what
brings you to Coblentz, what does? And why are you afraid of
recognition? Are you spying here, Isaac?"</p>

<p>"Better and better," said the deputy. "Your wits, my dear, have
grown rusty since you left us. However, here I am; and a word from
you can destroy me. What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"You disgust me," said Andr&eacute;-Louis. "Here. Take your
sword. You conceive then that friendship carries no obligations.
Take your sword I say. There are people coming. We shall attract
attention."</p>

<p>The deputy took the proffered weapon, and rapidly sheathed it.
"I have learnt," he said, "to mistrust even friendship in Political
matters."</p>

<p>"Not from me. Our relations never taught you that lesson."</p>

<p>"Since you are here, I must suppose that you have turned your
coat again; that you've returned to the fold of privilege. That
will have its duties. It is what I realized the moment I set eyes
on you. That is why I should have preferred to avoid you."</p>

<p>"Let us walk," said Andr&eacute;-Louis, and taking Le Chapelier
by the arm he persuaded him along the way he had been going before
his progress was interrupted.</p>

<p>The deputy, reassured by now that he had no betrayal to fear
from this man with whom for years he had been so closely
associated, allowed himself to talk freely. He was in Coblentz on a
mission from the National Assembly to the Elector of Treves. The
Assembly viewed with the gravest concern this massing of
&eacute;migr&eacute; forces, and this sheltering of
&eacute;migr&eacute; intriguers and counter-revolutionary plotters
in these limitrophe provinces. Roused to action by the same
influences which in the people had produced the events of the 10th
of August, the Assembly had dispatched the Deputy Le Chapelier to
inform the Elector that France must regard this state of things as
an act of calculated hostility, of which, should it continue, the
Nation must signify its resentment.</p>

<p>"I may appear to be a little late," Le Chapelier concluded,
"since already the &eacute;migr&eacute;s may be said to be quitting
Coblentz, and the armies are on the march; but I am still in time
to contrive that their retreat shall be cut off, and that they
shall not return here to resume their activities. I am frank with
you, Andr&eacute;, because I care not how widely-known may be the
attitude of the Assembly. The only secrecy I ask of you is on the
subject of my presence. Your friends of the party of privilege can
be murderously vindictive. I must remain a day or two yet, because
I am to see the Elector again when he has considered his position.
Meanwhile, there is no profit in denouncing me to the French nobles
here."</p>

<p>"Profit or not, the recommendation is almost an impertinence."
With this Andr&eacute;-Louis changed the subject to inquire what
was known and said of his own flight from Paris.</p>

<p>Le Chapelier shrugged. "It is not yet understood. When it is,
you will have ruined yourself: for Mademoiselle de Kercadiou, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"For her and others."</p>

<p>"Quentin de Kercadiou has been proscribed as an
&eacute;migr&eacute;, his possessions confiscated. So has Monsieur
de Plougastel. Why you should have taken his wife under your wing
in your flight, Heaven alone knows. Have they made you welcome
here, at least?"</p>

<p>"Without excessive warmth," said Andr&eacute;-Louis.</p>

<p>"Ah! And now what do you do? Do you join this army of
invasion?"</p>

<p>"It has been signified to me that my views, which are merely
monarchist, preclude my serving in an army that is to fight in the
cause of privilege."</p>

<p>"Then why remain?"</p>

<p>"To pray for victory. My fortunes are bound up with it."</p>

<p>"Fool, Andr&eacute;! Your fortunes are bound up with us. Come
back with me before it is too late. The Assembly thinks too well of
you, remembers too well your services, not to take a lenient view,
not to accept whatever explanation we concoct. Your return to your
place will be easy if you are well supported, and you can count
upon my support, which is not negligible."</p>

<p>It was not indeed. Le Chapelier in those days was a considerable
power in the Assembly. He was the author of that law which bears
his name and which reveals the clarity of view and purity of
motives of the architects of the constitution. Mirabeau, in the
hour of need, as a measure of resistance to the abuse of privilege,
had shown the workers the power of the strike.</p>

<p>"To render yourselves formidable," he had told them, "you need
but to become immobile."</p>

<p>Le Chapelier, when once privilege had been swept away, perceived
the danger to the state of that new-found power of one of its
classes. The statute for which he was responsible forbade any
federation of workers for purposes of exactions, on the ground that
the Nation had not abolished despotism in the palace to make way
for despotism in the gutter.</p>

<p>His aegis, therefore, was not an aegis to be despised. Nor did
Andr&eacute;-Louis despise it, although he shook his head.</p>

<p>"You have a trick of turning up at moments of crisis, Isaac, and
pointing the way to me. But this time I do not follow it. I am
committed."</p>

<p>They were now in a narrow street behind the Liebfrauenkirche.
The dusk had deepened almost into night. From an open doorway a
shaft of light fell athwart the moist, gleaming kidney stones with
which the street was paved. Le Chapelier came to a halt.</p>

<p>"It is, then, it seems, but ave atque vale. We have met, then,
but to part again. I am lodged here."</p>

<p>A woman of broad untidy shape loomed in the doorway, and, seeing
who came, surveyed both him and his companion as they stood
revealed in the light.</p>

<p>"I am lucky to leave you with my entrails whole," Andr&eacute;
mocked him. "May you prosper, Isaac, until we meet again."</p>

<p>They shook hands. Le Chapelier went in. The door was closed by
the woman, who muttered a greeting to her lodger, and
Andr&eacute;-Louis set out to return to the Three Crowns.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V - THE RESCUE</h2>

<p>The afternoon of the following day saw Andr&eacute;-Louis at
Sch&ouml;nbornlust, drawn thither by Aline as by a magnet. But this
time when he presented himself the gentleman-usher who had passed
him into the presence on the two former occasions affected not to
know him. He inquired his name and sought it in a list he held of
those who had the entr&eacute;e. He announced that it was not
there. Could he serve Monsieur Moreau? Whom particularly did
Monsieur Moreau seek? There was a sly insolence in his manner that
stung Andr&eacute;-Louis. He perceived in it that, like half these
courtiers, the fellow had the soul of a lackey. But he dissembled
his vexation, pretended not to observe the nudges, glances and
smiles of those others who, like himself now, must not aspire
beyond the ante-chamber and who were enjoying the rebuff of one who
had so confidently gone forward.</p>

<p>He desired, he announced after a moment's thought, a word with
Madame de Plougastel. The gentleman-usher beckoned a page, a pert
lad in white satin, and dispatched him to bear the name of Monsieur
Moreau&mdash;Moreau, was it not?&mdash;to Madame la Comtesse de
Plougastel. The page looked at Monsieur Moreau as if he were a
tradesman who had come to collect a bill, and vanished beyond the
sacred portal which was guarded by two officers in gold-laced
scarlet coats, white waistcoats and blue breeches.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis took a turn in that spacious ante-chamber
among the members of the lesser nobility and the subaltern officers
who peopled it. They made up an oddly assorted crowd. Most of the
officers glittered in uniforms, the purchase of which had rendered
them bankrupt. The others and their womenfolk were in garments
which showed every stage of wear, from some that were modishly cut
and still bore the bloom of freshness, to others which, rubbed and
soiled and threadbare, were at the last point of shabbiness. But
those who wore them had in common with the rest at least the same
assumptions of haughtiness, the same air of quiet, well-bred
insolence, the same trick of looking down their aristocratic noses.
All the airs and graces of the Oeuil de Boeuf were to be found
here.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis suffered with indifference the cool stares
and the levelling of quizzing glasses to scan his unpowdered hair,
his plain long riding-coat and the knee-boots from which
yesterday's mud had been laboriously removed. But he was not
required to endure it long. Madame de Plougastel did not keep him
waiting, and by her friendly wistful smile of welcome this great
lady shattered the scorn with which those lesser folk had presumed
to regard her visitor.</p>

<p>"My good Andr&eacute;!" She set a fine hand upon his arm. "You
bring me news of Quentin?"</p>

<p>"He is better to-day, madame. He shows signs, too, of a recovery
of spirit. I came, madame...Oh, to be frank, I came with the hope
to see Aline."</p>

<p>"And me, Andr&eacute;?" There was gentle reproach in the
tone.</p>

<p>"Madame!" he said on a low note of protest.</p>

<p>She understood and sighed. "Ah yes, my dear. And they would not
let you pass. You are out of favour. M. d'Artois was not pleased
with your politics, and Monsieur does not regard you with too
friendly an eye. But soon this will cease to matter, and you will
be safely back at Gavrillac. Perhaps in the years to come I shall
see you there sometimes..." She broke off. Her eyes dwelt upon his
lean, keen, resolute face, and they were sadly tender. "Wait here.
I'll bring Aline to you."</p>

<p>When Aline came a ripple of fresh interest almost of mild
excitement ran through the antechamber. There were whisperings, and
from one woman whose whisper was not hushed enough
Andr&eacute;-Louis caught the words: "...the Kercadiou...and Madame
de Balbi will need to look to herself. She will require all her wit
to make up for her fading beauty. Not that she was ever
beautiful."</p>

<p>The allusion to Mademoiselle de Kercadiou was obscure. But
Andr&eacute;-Louis was moved to inward anger by a suspicion that
already the scandalmongers of the court were preying upon her
name.</p>

<p>She stood before him radiant in her gown of coral taffetas with
rich pointe de Venise about its d&eacute;colletage. She was a
little out of breath. She had but a moment, she declared. She had
slipped away for just a word with him. She was in attendance upon
Madame, and must not neglect her duties. Kindly she deplored in him
the indiscretion which had procured his exclusion from the
presence. But he could depend upon her to do her best to make his
peace for him with the Princes.</p>

<p>He received the proposal coldly.</p>

<p>"I would not have you in any man's debt on my account,
Aline."</p>

<p>She laughed at him. "Faith, sir, you must learn to curb this
lordly independence. I have already spoken to Monsieur, though not
yet with much result. The moment is not propitious. It is of..."
She broke off. "But no. I must not tell you that."</p>

<p>If his lips smiled the crooked half-mocking smile she knew so
well, his eyes were grave. "So that now you are to have secrets
from me."</p>

<p>"Why, no. What does it matter, after all? Their highnesses are
more mistrustful than usual because there is an emissary from the
Assembly secretly in Coblentz at present."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis' face betrayed nothing. "Secretly?" said he.
"A secret of Polichinelle, it seems."</p>

<p>"Hardly that, and, anyway, the emissary believes that no one
knows save the Elector with whom he has come to treat."</p>

<p>"And the Elector has betrayed him?"</p>

<p>Aline appeared to be very well informed. "The Elector is in a
dilemma. He confided in Monsieur d'Entragues. Monsieur d'Entragues,
of course, has told the Prince."</p>

<p>"I don't perceive the need for mystery. Who is the man? Do you
know?"</p>

<p>"I believe he is a person of some consequence in the
Assembly."</p>

<p>"Naturally, if he comes as an ambassador to the Elector." With
assumed idleness he asked: "They intend him no harm I suppose?
Messieurs the &eacute;migr&eacute;s, I mean."</p>

<p>"You do not imagine that they will allow him to depart again.
Only M. de Batz is so squeamish as to advocate that. He has reasons
of his own."</p>

<p>"Do they know then where to find this man?"</p>

<p>"Of course. He has been tracked."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis continued with his air of half-interest. "But
what can they do? After all, he is an ambassador. Therefore his
person is sacred."</p>

<p>"To the Elector, Andr&eacute;. But not to Messieurs the
&eacute;migr&eacute;s."</p>

<p>"We are in the Electorate, are we not? What can the
&eacute;migr&eacute;s do here?"</p>

<p>Aline's sweet face was solemn. "They will deal with him, I
suppose, as his kind deals with ours."</p>

<p>"By way of showing that there is no fundamental difference
between the two." He laughed to dissemble the depth of his interest
and concern. "Well, well! It's a piece of wanton stupidity for
which they may pay bitterly, and it's a gross breach of the
Elector's hospitality, since it may bring down grave consequences
upon him. Do you say, Aline, that the Princes are in this murder
business? Or is it just the intention of some reckless
hotheads?"</p>

<p>She became alarmed. Although he kept his voice low an undertone
of vehemence, of indignation, quivered in it.</p>

<p>"I have talked too freely, Andr&eacute;. You have led me on.
Forget what I have said."</p>

<p>He dismissed the matter with a careless shrug. "What difference
if I remember?"</p>

<p>He was to display that difference the moment she had left him to
return to her duties. He quitted the palace on the instant, and
rode back into the town at the gallop. Leaving his horse at the
stable of the Three Crowns, from which he had hired it, he made his
way at speed through the thickening dusk to the little street
behind the Liebfrauenkirche, praying that already he might not come
too late.</p>

<p>He had assurance almost as soon as he had entered the street
that he was in time, but no more than in time; already the
assassins were at their post. At his appearance three shadows
melted into the archway of a porte-cochere almost opposite Le
Chapelier's lodging.</p>

<p>He reached the door, and knocked with the butt of his
riding-whip. This whip was his only weapon, and he blamed himself
now for having neglected to arm himself.</p>

<p>The door was opened by the same broad woman whom yesterday he
had seen.</p>

<p>"Monsieur...The gentleman who is lodged with you? Is he
within?"</p>

<p>She scanned him by the light of the lamp in the passage behind
her.</p>

<p>"I don't know. But if he is, he will receive no visitors."</p>

<p>"Tell him," said Andr&eacute;-Louis, "that it is the friend who
walked home with him last evening. You know me again, don't
you?"</p>

<p>"Wait there." She closed the door in his face.</p>

<p>Presently whilst waiting, Andr&eacute;-Louis dropped his whip.
He stooped to recover it, and was some time about it. This because
he was looking between his legs at the porte-cochere behind him.
The three heads were there in view peering out, to watch him.</p>

<p>At last he was admitted. In the front room above stairs, Le
Chapelier, neat of apparel as a petit-maitre, a gold-rimmed
spy-glass dangling from a ribbon round his neck, smiled a
welcome.</p>

<p>"You've come to tell me that you have changed your mind that you
will return with me."</p>

<p>"A bad guess, Isaac. I've come to tell you that there is more
than a doubt about your own return."</p>

<p>The tired eyes flamed into alertness, the fine arched brows were
raised in surprise. "What's that? The &eacute;migr&eacute;s, do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"Messieurs the &eacute;migr&eacute;s. Three of their
assassins&mdash;at least three&mdash;are at this moment lying in
wait for you in the street."</p>

<p>Le Chapelier lost colour "But how do they know? Have
you...?"</p>

<p>"No I haven't. If I had I should not now be here. Your visit has
placed the Elector in a delicate position. Clemens Wenceslaus has a
nice sense of hospitality. He found himself between the wall of
that and the sword of your demand. In his perplexity he sent for M.
d'Entragues and told him of it in confidence. In confidence M.
d'Entragues passed on the information to the Princes. In confidence
the Princes appear to have told the whole court, and in confidence
a member of it told me an hour ago. Has it ever occurred to you,
Isaac, that but for confidential communications one would never get
at any of the facts of history?"</p>

<p>"And you have come to warn me?"</p>

<p>"Isn't that what you gather?"</p>

<p>"This is very friendly, Andr&eacute;." Le Chapelier was gravely
emphatic. "But why should you suppose that they intend to murder
me?"</p>

<p>"Isn't it what you would suppose, yourself?"</p>

<p>Le Chapelier sat down in the only armchair that plainly
furnished room afforded. He drew a handkerchief from his pocket and
mopped the sweat which had gathered in cold beads upon his
brow.</p>

<p>"You are taking some risk," he said. "It is noble, but in the
circumstances, foolish."</p>

<p>"Most noble things are foolish."</p>

<p>"If they are posted there as you say..." Le Chapelier shrugged.
"Your warning comes too late. But I thank you for it none the less,
my friend."</p>

<p>"Nonsense. Is there no back way out of this?"</p>

<p>A wan smile crossed the face of the deputy, which showed pale in
the candlelight.</p>

<p>"If there were they would be guarding it."</p>

<p>"Very well, then. I'll seek the Elector. He shall send his
guards to clear a way for you."</p>

<p>"The Elector has gone to Oberkirch. Before you could reach him
and return it would be daylight. Do you imagine that those
murderers will wait all night? When they perceive that I am not
coming forth again they'll knock. The woman will open, and..." He
shrugged, and left the sentence there. Then in hot, distressed
anger he broke out: "It's an infamy! I am an ambassador, and my
person is sacred. But these vindictive devils care nothing for
that. In their eyes I am vermin to be exterminated, and they'll
exterminate me without a thought for the vengeance they will bring
down upon their host the Elector." He got to his feet again,
raging. "My God! What a vengeance that will be! This foolish
archbishop shall realize the rashness of having harboured such
guests."</p>

<p>"That won't slake the thirst you'll have in Hell," said
Andr&eacute; Louis. "And, anyway, you're not dead yet."</p>

<p>"Why, no. Merely under sentence."</p>

<p>"Come, man. To be warned is already something. It's the
unsuspecting who walks foolishly into the trap. If, now, we were to
make a sally, both together, the odds are none so heavy. Two
against three. We might bring you off."</p>

<p>Hope dawned in Le Chapelier's face. Doubt followed. "Do you know
that there are but three? Can you be sure?"</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis sighed. "Ah! That, I confess, is my own
misgiving."</p>

<p>"Depend upon it, there will be more at hand. Go your way, my
friend, while you may still depart. I'll await them here with my
pistols. They will not know that I am warned. I may get one of them
before they get me."</p>

<p>"A poor consolation." Andr&eacute;-Louis stood in thought. Then:
"Yes, I might go my way," he said. "They've seen me enter. They
will hardly hinder my departure, lest by so doing they should alarm
you." His eyes grew bright with inspiration. Abruptly he asked a
question. "If you were out of this house, what should you do?"</p>

<p>"Do? I should make for the frontier. My travelling chaise is at
the Red Hat." Despondently he added "But what's that to the
matter?"</p>

<p>"Are your papers in order? Could you pass the guard at the
bridge?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes. My passport is countersigned by the Electoral
Chancellor."</p>

<p>"Why then, it's easy, I think."</p>

<p>"Easy?"</p>

<p>"We're much of a height and shape. You will take this
riding-coat, these white breeches and these boots. With my hat on
your head and my whip tucked under your arm, the woman of the house
will light Monsieur Andr&eacute;-Louis Moreau to the door. On the
doorstep you will pause, turning your back upon that gateway across
the street; so that whilst your figure is clear in the light, your
face will not be seen. You will say to the woman something like
this: 'You had better tell the gentleman upstairs that if I do not
return within an hour he need not wait for me.' Then you plunge
abruptly from the light into the gloom and make off, a hand in each
pocket, a pistol in each hand for emergencies."</p>

<p>The colour was stirring again in the deputy's pale cheeks. "But
you?"</p>

<p>"I?" Andr&eacute;-Louis shrugged. "They will let you go because
they will suppose that you are not Isaac Le Chapelier. They will
let me go because they will see that I am not Isaac Le
Chapelier."</p>

<p>The deputy wrung his hands nervously. He was white again. "You
tempt me damnably."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis began to unbutton his coat. "Off with your
clothes."</p>

<p>"But the risk to you is more than you represent it."</p>

<p>"It is negligible, and merely a risk. Your death, if you wait,
is a certainty. Come, man. To work!"</p>

<p>The change was effected, and at least the back view presented by
Le Chapelier in Andr&eacute;-Louis' clothes must in an uncertain
light be indistinguishable from that of the man whom those watching
eyes had seen enter the house a half-hour ago.</p>

<p>"Now call your woman. Dab your lips with a handkerchief as you
emerge. It will help to mask your face until you've turned."</p>

<p>Le Chapelier gripped both his hands. His myopic eyes were moist.
"I have no words, my friend."</p>

<p>"Praised be Heaven! Away with you. You have an hour in which to
be out of Coblentz."</p>

<p>A few minutes later when the door opened, something stirred in
the archway across the street. The watching eyes beheld the man in
the riding-coat and sugar-loaf hat who had entered a half-hour
before. They heard his parting message, loudly spoken, and saw him
go striding down the street. They made no move to hinder or to
follow.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis above, peering past the edge of the blind,
his ears attentive, was content.</p>

<p>A full hour he waited, and whilst waiting he considered. What if
these gentlemen issued no challenge, made no covert attack, but,
persuaded that he was Le Chapelier, shot him as he walked down the
street? It was a risk he had not counted. Counting it now, he
decided that it would be better to receive them here in the light
where, face to face, they would perceive their error.</p>

<p>Another hour he waited, now sitting, now pacing the length of
the narrow chamber in a state of nervousness induced by the
suspense, conjecture chasing conjecture through his mind. Then, at
long last, towards ten o'clock, a rattle of approaching steps on
the kidney stones of the street below, a mutter of voices directly
under the window, announced that the enemy was moving to the
assault.</p>

<p>Considering what the odds would be, Andr&eacute;-Louis wished
that he had pistols. But Le Chapelier had taken the only pair. He
fingered the cut steel hilt of the light delicate sword which Le
Chapelier had left him; but he did not draw it. A loud knock fell
on the door, and was twice repeated.</p>

<p>He heard the shuffling steps of the woman, the click of the
lifted latch, her voice raised in challenge, deeper voices
answering her, then her voice again, in an outcry of alarm, and at
last a rush of heavy feet along the passage and upon the
stairs.</p>

<p>When the door was flung rudely open, the three men who thrust
into the room beheld an apparently calm young gentleman standing
beyond the barrier of the table, with brows interrogatively raised,
considering them with a glance no more startled than the intrusion
warranted.</p>

<p>"What's this?" he asked. "Who are you? What do you want
here?"</p>

<p>"We want you, sir," said the foremost, under whose half-open
cloak Andr&eacute;-Louis perceived the green and silver of the
guards of M. d'Artois. He was tall and authoritative, in air and
voice a gentleman. The other two wore the blue coats with yellow
facings and fleur-de-lys buttons of the Auvergne Regiment.</p>

<p>"You are to come with us, if you please," said
green-and-silver.</p>

<p>So! It was not proposed to butcher him on the spot. They were to
lead him forth. Down to the river, perhaps. Blow his brains out and
thrust his body into the stream. Thus the Deputy Le Chapelier would
simply disappear.</p>

<p>"Come with you?" Andr&eacute;-Louis echoed the words like a man
who has not understood them.</p>

<p>"At once, if you please. You are wanted at the Electoral
Palace."</p>

<p>Deeper showed the surprise on Andr&eacute;-Louis' face. "At the
Electoral Palace? Odd! However, I come, of course." He turned aside
to take up hat and cloak. "Faith, you are only just in time. I was
about to depart, tired of waiting for Monsieur Le Chapelier." In
the act of flinging the cloak about his shoulders, he added: "I
suppose that it was he who sent you?"</p>

<p>The question stirred them sharply. The three of them were
craning their necks to scrutinize him.</p>

<p>"Who the devil are you?" demanded one of the Auvergnats. "If it
comes to that, who the devil may you be?"</p>

<p>"I've told you, sir," said green-and-silver, "that we
are&mdash;" He was interrupted by an oath from one of his
companions. "This is not our man."</p>

<p>The colour deepened in green-and-silver's face. He advanced a
step. "Where is Le Chapelier?"</p>

<p>"Where is he?" Andr&eacute;-Louis looked blank. "Where is he?"
he repeated. "Then he hasn't sent you?"</p>

<p>"I tell you we are seeking him."</p>

<p>"But if you come from the Electoral Palace, then? It is very
odd." Andr&eacute;-Louis assumed an air of mistrust. "Le Chapelier
left me two hours ago to go there. He was to have returned in an
hour. If you want him, you had better wait here for him. I can wait
no longer."</p>

<p>"Two hours ago!" the Auvergnat was saying. "Then it was the man
who..."</p>

<p>Green-and-silver cut sharply across the question which must
betray the watch they had kept. "How long have you been here?"</p>

<p>"Three hours at least."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Green-and-silver was concluding that the man in the
riding-coat whom they had supposed a visitor must have been the
deputy himself. It was bewildering. "Who are you?" he asked
aggressively. "What was your business with the deputy?"</p>

<p>"Faith! I don't know what concern that may be of yours. But
there's no secret. I had no business with him. He's an old friend
met here by chance, that's all. As to whom I am, I am named
Andr&eacute;-Louis Moreau."</p>

<p>"What? You are Kercadiou's bastard?"</p>

<p>The next moment green-and-silver received Andr&eacute;-Louis'
hand full and hard upon his cheek. There was a twisted smile on
Andr&eacute;-Louis' white face.</p>

<p>"To-morrow," said he coldly, "there will be one liar the less in
the world. To-night if honour spurs you fiercely."</p>

<p>The officer, white in his turn, his lip in his teeth, bowed
formally. The other two stood at gaze, startled. The entire scene
and their respective roles in it had abruptly changed.</p>

<p>"To-morrow will serve," said the officer, and added: "My name is
Tourzel, Clement de Tourzel."</p>

<p>"Your friends will know where to find me. I am lodged at the
Three Crowns with my godfather&mdash;my godfather, gentlemen, be
good enough to remember&mdash;Monsieur de Kercadiou."</p>

<p>His glance for a moment challenged the two Auvergnats. Then,
finding the challenge unanswered, he flung one wing of the cloak
over his left shoulder and stalked past them, out of the room, down
the stairs and so out of the house.</p>

<p>The officers made no attempt to detain him. The Auvergnats
stared gloomily at green-and-silver.</p>

<p>"Here's a nice blunder," said one of them.</p>

<p>"You fool, Tourzel!" cried the other. "You're a dead man."</p>

<p>"Peste!" swore Tourzel. "The words slipped out of me before I
knew what I was saying."</p>

<p>"And it must be a lie, anyway," said the first. "Does anyone
suppose that Kercadiou would allow his bastard to marry his
niece?"</p>

<p>Tourzel shrugged and attempted a laugh of bravado. "We'll leave
to-morrow till it dawns. Meanwhile we have this rat of a patriot to
settle to-night. It will be better after all to await him in the
street."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Andr&eacute;-Louis was walking briskly back to the
Three Crowns.</p>

<p>"You are late, Andr&eacute;," his godfather greeted him. Then,
as Andr&eacute;-Louis loosed his cloak, and the Lord of Gavrillac
perceived his black satin breeches and buckled shoes, "Parbleau!
You're neat," he said.</p>

<p>"In all my undertakings," answered Andr&eacute;-Louis.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI - THE APOLOGY</h2>

<p>In the course of the following morning, as Andr&eacute;-Louis
sat expecting Monsieur de Tourzel's friends, he was visited by an
equerry with a command to wait instantly upon Monsieur at
Sch&ouml;nbornlust. The carriage which had brought the equerry
waited at the door of the inn. The matter had almost the air of an
arrest.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis, who had no taste for wearing another man's
clothes longer than he must, and who was spurred in addition on
this occasion by less personal considerations, had sought a tailor
early that morning, and was once more characteristically arrayed in
a long fawn riding-coat with wide lapels. He professed himself
ready, and took leave of the Lord of Gavrillac, who, suffering from
a chill, was constrained to keep the house.</p>

<p>At Sch&ouml;nbornlust he was received in the ante-chamber,
almost empty at this early hour, by the swarthy, hollow-cheeked
Monsieur d'Entragues, whose narrow close-set eyes looked him over
coldly. Andr&eacute;-Louis', of course, was not a proper dress in
which to come to court, and was of a kind tolerated there only
because the impecunious state of many of the &eacute;migr&eacute;s
had perforce relaxed the etiquette in these matters.</p>

<p>Monsieur d'Entragues surprised him with questions on the subject
of his relations with Le Chapelier. Andr&eacute;-Louis made no
mystery. Le Chapelier and he had been friends, and at various times
associates, from the days of the Assembly of the States of Brittany
at Rennes, five or six years ago, He had met him by chance in the
street two evenings ago, and last night he had called at Le
Chapelier's lodging to pay him a friendly visit.</p>

<p>"And then?" quoth Monsieur d'Entragues, peremptory.</p>

<p>"And then? Oh, when I had been with him an hour or so, he
informed me that he was expected at the Electoral Palace, and
begged me to await his return, saying that he would not be more
than an hour away. I waited two hours, and then, when a Monsieur de
Tourzel and two other gentlemen called to see him, I departed."</p>

<p>M. d'Entragues' dark eyes had shifted from Andr&eacute;-Louis.
"It is all very odd."</p>

<p>"Very odd, indeed, to leave me waiting there like that."</p>

<p>"Especially as he can have had no intention of returning."</p>

<p>"But what do you tell me?"</p>

<p>"This man Le Chapelier left his lodging at nine o'clock."</p>

<p>"Yes. That would be the time."</p>

<p>"At a quarter past nine he was at the Red Hat Inn where he kept
his travelling chaise. At half-past nine the guard at the bridge
passed him over. He was on his way to France. Clearly he must have
been acting upon intentions formed before he left you, as you tell
me, to await his return."</p>

<p>"It must have been so if your information is correct. It is very
odd, as you say."</p>

<p>"You did not know that he would not return?" d'Entragues' eyes
were like gimlets.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis met their searching glance with a crooked
smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I am honoured. You take me for a half-wit. I sit for
two hours awaiting the return of a man who I know will not return.
Ah, but that is droll." And he laughed outright.</p>

<p>M. d'Entragues did not join in the laugh. "If you intended, for
instance, to cover his retreat?"</p>

<p>"His retreat?" Andr&eacute;-Louis was suddenly grave again. "His
retreat? But from what, then, was he retreating? Was he threatened?
Peste, Monsieur d'Entragues, you'll not mean that the visit of
Monsieur de Tourzel and his friends&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bah!" snapped d'Entragues to interrupt him. "What are you
assuming?" There was a flush on his dark face. He was uncomfortably
conscious that his zeal of investigation had half betrayed a design
which, having failed in execution, must never now be known.</p>

<p>But Andr&eacute;-Louis, maliciously vindictive, pursued him. "It
is you, monsieur, who make assumptions, I think. If you assume that
I stayed to cover a retreat, you must know that there was cause for
it. That is plain enough."</p>

<p>"I know nothing of the kind, sir. I only fear lest Monsieur Le
Chapelier should have suspected some danger, and so have been led
to make a departure which looks like a flight. Naturally Monsieur
Le Chapelier as an agent of these revolutionaries would know that
here he has only enemies, and this may have made him start at
shadows. Enough, sir! I'll conduct you to his highness."</p>

<p>In a small room communicating with the white-and-gold pillared
salon that served as presence chamber, the King's brother was
seated quill in hand at a table strewn with papers. He was attended
by the Comte d'Avaray, his favourite, a slight, pale,
delicate-looking man of thirty, with thin fair hair, who in
appearance, dress and manner affected the airs of an Englishman. He
was a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Madame de Balbi, to whom he owed a
position which his own talents had very materially
strengthened.</p>

<p>Devoted to Monsieur, it was his wit and resource which had made
possible the Prince's timely escape from Paris. Gentle, courteous
and affable, he had earned the esteem of the entire court if we
except the ambitious Monsieur d'Entragues, who beheld in him a
dangerous rival for Monsieur's favour.</p>

<p>His highness slewed himself half round in his chair to confront
Andr&eacute;-Louis. Andr&eacute;-Louis bowed profoundly. The Comte
d'Entragues remained watchful in the background.</p>

<p>"Ah, Monsieur Moreau." There was a smile on Monsieur's full
lips, but his prominent eyes under their heavy arched brows were
hardly friendly. "Considering your services to some persons we
esteem, I must deplore that my brother, M. d'Artois, should have
found your opinions and principles of such a complexion that he has
not been able to offer you any post in the army which is about to
deliver Throne and Altar from the enemy."</p>

<p>He paused there, and Andr&eacute;-Louis felt it incumbent upon
him to say something in reply.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I did not make it sufficiently clear to his highness
that my principles are strictly monarchical, monseigneur."</p>

<p>"Strictly perhaps, but inadequately. You are, I understand, a
constitutionalist. That, however, is by the way." He paused a
moment. "What was that officer's name, d'Entragues?"</p>

<p>"Tourzel, monseigneur. Captain Clement de Tourzel."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes. Tourzel. I understand, Monsieur Moreau, that you had
the misfortune to enter into a quarrel last night with Captain de
Tourzel."</p>

<p>"Captain de Tourzel had that misfortune, monseigneur."</p>

<p>The great eyes bulged at him. Monsieur d'Avaray looked startled.
D'Entragues in the background clicked softly with his tongue.</p>

<p>"To be sure, you have been a fencing-master," said Monsieur. "A
fencing-master of considerable repute, I understand." His tone was
cold and distant. "Do you think, Monsieur Moreau, that it is quite
proper, quite honourable, for a fencing-master to engage in duels?
Is it not a little like...like gaming with cogged dice?"</p>

<p>"That circumstance, monseigneur, should prevent unpardonable
utterances. A fencing-master is not to be insulted with impunity
because he is a fencing-master."</p>

<p>"But I understand, sir, that you were the aggressor: that you
struck Monsieur de Tourzel. That is so, d'Entragues, is it not? A
blow was struck?"</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis saved the Count the trouble of answering. "I
certainly struck Monsieur de Tourzel. But the blow was not the
aggression. It was the answer to an insult that admitted of no
other answer."</p>

<p>"Is this so, d'Entragues?" His highness became peevish. "You did
not tell me this, d'Entragues."</p>

<p>"Naturally, monseigneur, there must have been some provocation
for the blow."</p>

<p>"Then why am I not told? Why am I but half informed? Monsieur
Moreau, what was this provocation?"</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis told him, adding: "It is a lie, monseigneur,
that peculiarly defames my godfather since I am to marry his niece.
I could not let it pass even if I am a fencing-master."</p>

<p>Monsieur breathed noisily. He showed signs of discomfort, of
distress. "But this is very grave, d'Entragues. Almost...almost it
touches the honour of Mademoiselle de Kercadiou." It annoyed
Andr&eacute;-Louis that his highness should make this the reason
for his change of attitude. "You agree that it is grave,
d'Entragues?"</p>

<p>"Most grave, monseigneur."</p>

<p>Did this lantern-jawed fellow smile covertly, wondered
Andr&eacute;-Louis in suppressed fury.</p>

<p>"You will say two words from me to this Captain de Tourzel. You
will tell him that I am not pleased with him. That I censure his
conduct in the severest terms. That I regard it as disgraceful in a
gentleman. Tell him this from me, d'Entragues; and see that he does
not approach us again for at least a month."</p>

<p>He turned once more to Andr&eacute;-Louis. "He shall make you an
apology, Monsieur Moreau. Let him know that, too, d'Entragues: that
he must formally retract to Monsieur Moreau, and this at once. You
understand, Monsieur Moreau, that this matter can go no further.
For one thing, there is an edict in the Electorate against duelling
and we who are the Elector's guests must scrupulously respect his
laws. For another, the time is not one in which it consorts with
honour that gentlemen should engage in private quarrels. The King
needs&mdash;urgently needs&mdash;every blade in his own cause. You
understand, sir?"</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis bowed. "Perfectly, monseigneur."</p>

<p>"Then that is all, I think. I thank you for your attention. You
may retire, Monsieur Moreau." The plump white hand waved him away,
the heavy lips parted in a cold half-smile.</p>

<p>In the ante-chamber Monsieur Moreau was desired to wait until
Monsieur d'Entragues should have found Captain de Tourzel.</p>

<p>It was whilst he was cooling his heels there, the only tenant of
that spacious, sparsely-furnished hall, that Aline, accompanied by
Madame de Plougastel, entered by the folding doors from the salon.
He started towards them.</p>

<p>"Aline!"</p>

<p>But her expression checked his eagerness. There was a pallor
about the lower half of her face, a little pucker between the fine
brows, a general look of hurt sternness.</p>

<p>"Oh, how could you? How could you?"</p>

<p>"How could I what?"</p>

<p>"Break faith with me so. Betray what I told you in secret!"</p>

<p>He understood, and was not abashed. "It was to save a man's
life: the life of a friend. Chapelier was my friend."</p>

<p>"But you did not know that when you drew from me the
confidence."</p>

<p>"I did. I knew that Le Chapelier was in Coblentz, and,
therefore, that he must be the man concerned."</p>

<p>"You knew? You knew?" She looked at him in deepening anger.
Behind her stood Madame de Plougastel, sad-eyed after her little
smile of greeting. "And you said nothing of your knowledge. You led
me on to talk. You drew it all from me with pretended indifference.
That was sly, Andr&eacute;. Horribly sly. I'd not have believed it
of you."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis was almost impatient. "Will you tell me what
harm is done? Or do you tell me that you are angry because a man, a
friend of mine, has not been assassinated?"</p>

<p>"That is not the point."</p>

<p>"It is very much the point."</p>

<p>Madame de Plougastel sought to make peace. "Indeed, Aline, if it
was a friend of Andr&eacute;'s&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Aline interrupted her. "That is not the point at all,
madame, between Andr&eacute; and me. Why was he not frank? Why did
he use me so slyly, luring me into betraying a confidence Monsieur
had reposed in me, using me as if...as if I were a spy."</p>

<p>"Aline!"</p>

<p>"Did you do less? Will it appear less when it becomes known that
this man, this dangerous agent of your revolutionary friends, made
his escape because I betrayed the intentions concerning him?"</p>

<p>"It will never become known," said Andr&eacute;-Louis. "I've
talked to Monsieur d'Entragues. I've stopped his questions. His
mind is satisfied."</p>

<p>"There, Aline. You see," said Madame de Plougastel. "All is
well, after all."</p>

<p>"All is very far from well. How can there be any confidence
between us after this? I must keep a guard upon my tongue. How can
I be sure when I talk to Andr&eacute; whether I am talking to my
lover or to a revolutionary agent? If Monsieur knew, what would he
think of me?"</p>

<p>"That, of course, is important,'' said Andr&eacute;-Louis,
unable now to repress his irony.</p>

<p>"Do you sneer? Certainly it is important. If Monsieur honours me
with his confidence, am I to betray it? I am to appear in his eyes
either as a traitress or a little fool who cannot set a guard upon
her tongue. A pleasant choice. This man has escaped. He has gone
back to Paris to work evil against the Princes, against the
King."</p>

<p>"It comes to this then that you are sorry he was not
assassinated."</p>

<p>Being true, and yet not the whole truth, this put her further
out of patience.</p>

<p>"It is not true that he was to have been assassinated. And if it
were that is but the effect and I am dealing with the cause. Why
wilt you confuse them?"</p>

<p>"Because they are always inseparable. Cause and effect are but
the two sides of a fact. And in justice to me remember that he was
my friend."</p>

<p>"You mean that you think more of him than you do of me," she
said with feminine perversity. "For his sake you lied to me; for
your silence amounted to no less. You duped me, tricked me by your
seemingly idle questions and your false air of indifference. You
are too clever for me, Andr&eacute;."</p>

<p>"I wish that I were clever enough to make you see the folly of
all this."</p>

<p>Madame de Plougastel put a hand on her shoulder. "Aline, my
dear, can you find no excuse for him?"</p>

<p>"Can you, madame?"</p>

<p>"Why, every excuse since hearing that this man was his friend. I
would not have had him behave otherwise. Neither should you."</p>

<p>"It was not upon you he exercised his slyness, madame, or you
might think differently. Nor is that all, as you know. What is this
of a duel on your hands, Andr&eacute;?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that!" Andr&eacute;-Louis was airy, welcoming the change of
subject. "That arranges itself."</p>

<p>"Arranges itself! You've ruined yourself completely with
Monsieur."</p>

<p>"There at least, I can prove you wrong. I've seen Monsieur. His
highness is tolerably pleased with me. It is my opponent who is out
of favour."</p>

<p>"You ask me to believe this?"</p>

<p>"You may ascertain it for yourself. Monsieur pays attention to
facts; permits a connection between cause and effect which you
deny. When I had told him why I smacked M. de Tourzel's face he
gave me reason. Monsieur de Tourzel is to apologize to me. I am
waiting for him now."</p>

<p>"Monsieur de Tourzel is to apologize to you because you smacked
his face?"</p>

<p>"No, my sweet perversity. But for the reason he gave me to do
it."</p>

<p>"What reason?"</p>

<p>He told them, and saw distress in both their faces. "Monsieur,"
he added, "does not consider that a buffet suffices to extinguish
the offence. That may be out of tenderness for you, because he
perceived, as he said, that in a sense it touched your honour."</p>

<p>He saw her eyes soften at last, and winced to see it, accounting
it the reflection of her gratitude to Monsieur. "That was gracious
of his highness. You see, Andr&eacute;, how gracious, how generous
he can be."</p>

<p>Monsieur d'Entragues came in accompanied by Monsieur de Tourzel.
Andr&eacute;-Louis looked over his shoulder at them.</p>

<p>"I am wanted. Shall I see you again before I go, Aline?"</p>

<p>She had resumed her coldness. "Not to-day, Andr&eacute;. I must
consider all this. I am shaken. Hurt."</p>

<p>Madame de Plougastel leaned towards him. "Leave me to make your
peace, Andr&eacute;."</p>

<p>He kissed her hand, and then Aline's, which was very coldly
yielded. Then, having held the door for them, he turned to meet the
newcomers.</p>

<p>The tall, offending young officer was looking pale and vicious.
No doubt he had received the messages intimating Monsieur's
displeasure, and he saw his advancement imperilled by the events.
He came stiffly to attention before Andr&eacute;-Louis, and bowed
formally. Andr&eacute;-Louis returned the bow as formally.</p>

<p>"I am commanded by Monsieur to retract the words I used to you
last night, sir, and to apologize for them."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis disliked the studiously offensive tone.</p>

<p>"I am commanded by Monsieur to accept the apology. I gather that
we make this exchange of civilities with mutual regret."</p>

<p>"Certainly with regret on my side," said the officer.</p>

<p>"You may temper it, then, with the reflection that once your
duty to his majesty no longer claims your sword, you may call upon
me for anything that you may conceive I owe you."</p>

<p>Only Monsieur d'Entragues' intervention at that moment saved
Captain de Tourzel's countenance.</p>

<p>"Messieurs, what is this? Will you build a new quarrel out of
the old one? There is no more to be said between you. This affair
must go no further, nor must it be resumed under pain of Monsieur's
severe displeasure. You understand me, gentlemen?"</p>

<p>They bowed and separated and Andr&eacute;-Louis went back to his
inn in an indifferent humour.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII - MADAME DE BALBI</h2>

<p>At long last the great Prussian and Austrian legions, reinforced
by the chivalry of France, were moving forward. Longwy was being
invested and the campaign for Throne and Altar was beginning in
earnest, just one month later than it should have begun but for the
vagaries of the King of Prussia, the Agamemnon of this invading
host.</p>

<p>A month ago, when all was ready and the weather fine, this
Prussian giant had descended upon Coblentz and upon Charles William
of Brunswick-Wolfenb&uuml;ttel, who was the real commander-in-chief
and a soldier of repute. Suspending all effective movement, his
Majesty had wasted precious time upon reviews, parades and fetes to
celebrate a victory which had yet to be won.</p>

<p>The brothers of the King of France possessing no greater
military acumen than his majesty of Prussia were content enough to
co-operate in these junketings, and to waste upon them large sums
of the borrowed money which already was running woefully short.
Cond&eacute;, the only soldier among the Princes, fretted the while
in his camp at Worms over a delay that was all in favour of the
unready enemy, and grumbled&mdash;not without reason&mdash;that an
invisible hand withheld them perilously from attempting an assured
success.</p>

<p>Now, at last, all delays were ended; now that the rains had
converted the Rhineland into a world of mud. The Princes were at
once to rejoin the army of the &eacute;migr&eacute;s, and make a
pretence at least of commanding it, under the mentorship of
Cond&eacute; and the Mar&eacute;chal de Broglie. Their
ladies&mdash;that is to say, the wife of one of them and the
mistresses of both&mdash;were to leave Coblentz at once.</p>

<p>Madame was to repair to her father's court at Turin. But because
the King of Sardinia had already experienced the prodigality of his
sons-in-law (for each of the sons of France had married a princess
of Savoy) he strictly delimited the suite that was to attend her
highness. Some ladies-in-waiting, however, she must have, and to
Madame de Balbi and Madame de Gourbillon she would have added
Mademoiselle de Kercadiou but for certain activities on the part of
Madame de Balbi, activities which&mdash;so badly do we sometimes
blunder when we seek to shape our destinies&mdash;were to
precipitate in the end the very situation which with such clear
reckoning they were calculated to avert.</p>

<p>An Electoral carriage brought Madame de Balbi, in the pursuit of
these activities, one afternoon to the door of the Three
Crowns.</p>

<p>Now it happened that Monsieur de Kercadiou, complaining of the
cold and damp and of a general weariness resulting from his
condition, had put himself to bed, and Andr&eacute;-Louis was
sitting alone over a book when a footman, ushered by a
waiting-maid, brought the startling announcement of Madame la
Comtesse de Balbi's presence.</p>

<p>In bewildered conjecture Andr&eacute;-Louis consented to act as
his godfather's deputy, and desired that the Countess be brought
up.</p>

<p>She came, throwing back her gossamer light cloak and wimple, and
her presence and personality seemed to bring a radiance into that
long, low-ceilinged room. Her crisp, melodious tones offered
apologies for her intrusion and regrets for the condition and
absence of Monsieur de Kercadiou.</p>

<p>"But the matter is almost more personal to yourself than to your
godfather, Monsieur Moreau."</p>

<p>"I am honoured by your memory, madame," said Andr&eacute;-Louis,
surprised to hear his name so glibly from her lips. He I bowed as
he spoke, and offered her the armchair by the stove which Monsieur
de Kercadiou had lately vacated.</p>

<p>She laughed as she advanced to take it, a rich musical laugh
that reminded one of the note of a thrush.</p>

<p>"I suspect you guilty of modesty, Monsieur Moreau."</p>

<p>"You account it a guilt, madame?"</p>

<p>"Of course, since it fetters expression." She sat down, and
arranged her skirts.</p>

<p>Anne de Caumont La Force, unhappily married to that eccentric
libertine Count de Balbi, who had brutally ill-treated her before
he went mad and fortunately died, might from her appearance have
been of any age from twenty-five to thirty-five. In reality she was
already forty. She was small and elegantly dainty. Not beautiful,
in spite of a pair of superb eyes, alluring in their glances, but
endowed with an irresistible witchery to which all her
contemporaries bear witness.</p>

<p>The glance of those magnificent dark eyes seemed now to envelop
Andr&eacute;-Louis, to challenge him, almost to woo him.</p>

<p>"I had remarked you at Sch&ouml;nbornlust, monsieur, on the day
of your arrival, and I remarked you, let me say frankly, with
admiration for your superb aplomb. I know no quality that better
becomes a gentleman."</p>

<p>He would have answered her but the sparkling, voluble lady gave
him no time. She swept on. "It is really on your account that I am
here and as a result of the interest you inspire in me. Ah, but
reassure yourself, Monsieur Moreau, I am not one of those greedy
women who must find their every interest reciprocated and desire in
addition to arouse interest which they cannot reciprocate."</p>

<p>"I should not crave reassurance, madame, from an amiable
illusion."</p>

<p>"You turn a phrase, Monsieur Moreau. But, indeed, it was to be
expected in you. You have been an author I am told."</p>

<p>"I have been so many things, madame."</p>

<p>"And now you are the greatest thing of all: a lover. Ahd believe
one who knows. No man can aspire to more, for it brings him nearer
Heaven than is otherwise possible on earth."</p>

<p>"Your lovers, madame, will have discovered that."</p>

<p>"My lovers! Ah, that! You speak as if I measured them by the
bushel."</p>

<p>"It will ever rest with you, madame, how you measure them."</p>

<p>"Oh, I cry your mercy. This is a duel in which I risk defeat."
She was as grave as her roguish eye and the tilt of her nose
permitted. "It is to the lover that I have come to speak. For this
is even more his affair than it is an uncle's. Therefore, we may
leave Monsieur de Kercadiou in peace. Besides, it is not very easy
to say what I have come to say, and it may be less difficult to say
it to you alone. You will prove as understanding as I hope you will
prove discreet."</p>

<p>"Discreet as a confessor, be sure of that, Madame," said
Andr&eacute;-Louis, inwardly a little impatient.</p>

<p>The Countess considered a moment, her perfect hands smoothing
her petticoat of striped taffeta the while.</p>

<p>"When I shall have told you my errand you will be in danger of
supposing me just a jealous woman. I warn you against it. I have
much for which to answer. But jealousy is a vulgarity which I leave
to the vulgar."</p>

<p>"It is inconceivable, madame, that you should ever have had
occasion for it."</p>

<p>She flashed him a smile. "That may be the reason. Remember it
when you come to judge me. I am to speak, sir, of the lady whom I
am told you are to marry. Frankly, it is not on her own account
that her fate concerns me, but because of the...let us say
regard... which you, monsieur, inspire me."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis was stirred. "Her fate, madame? Is she, then,
in danger?"</p>

<p>She shrugged, thrust out a full sensual nether lip, and showed
two dimples in a smile. "Some would not account it danger. It
depends upon the point of view. In your eyes, Monsieur Moreau, she
certainly cannot be accounted safe. Do you even suspect at whose
desire she was appointed lady-in-waiting to Madame?"</p>

<p>"You will tell me that it was at Monsieur's," he replied
frowning.</p>

<p>She shook her head. "It was at the desire of Madame
herself."</p>

<p>He was suddenly at a loss. "But in that case, madame..." He
broke off.</p>

<p>"In that case you imagine that there is no more to say. You do
not think it may be necessary to discover Madame's object. You
assume it naturally to be a sympathy for that very charming person
Mademoiselle de Kercadiou. That is because you do not know Madame.
Mademoiselle de Kercadiou is singularly attractive. There is about
her an air of sweetness of freshness, of innocence that arouses
tenderness even in women. What, then, must it do in men? So far,
for instance, as Monsieur is concerned, I have seldom seen his
highness in such a state of deliquescence." There was something
contemptuous in her smile, as if she found the susceptible side of
Monsieur's nature entirely ridiculous. "Disabuse your mind of the
thought that jealousy makes me see what is not present. The Count
of Provence might trail a seraglio at his heels without perturbing
me."</p>

<p>"But you bewilder me, madame...Am I to believe that because
Monsieur...discovered attractions in Mademoiselle de Kercadiou that
is a reason why Madame should appoint her to a position that will
throw her in his way? Surely not that?"</p>

<p>"Just that, monsieur. Just that. Madame's nature is peculiar; it
is warped, soured, malicious. For the satisfaction of contemplating
injury to another she will endure even injury to herself. It
happens with such natures. I have the distinction of being detested
by Madame. This is all the more bitter in her because she is
constrained to suffer my attendance and to be civil to me. Now do
you understand?"</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis was visibly troubled. "I seem to. And
yet..."</p>

<p>"Madame would give her eyes to see me supplanted in the regard,
the affection of Monsieur. Does that help you?"</p>

<p>"You mean that to achieve this object, although the exchange can
nothing profit her, her highness desires to use Mademoiselle de
Kercadiou?"</p>

<p>"That is as concise as it is accurate."</p>

<p>"It is also infamous."</p>

<p>The Countess shrugged. "I should not use so fine a word. It is
just the petty malice of a stupid, parasitic woman who is without
useful thoughts to engage her."</p>

<p>"I perceive your good intentions, madame." Andr&eacute;-Louis
was very formal. "You desire to warn me. I am deeply grateful."</p>

<p>"The warning, my friend is hardly uttered yet. Madame sets out
to-morrow for Turin. I am to accompany her highness. My position at
court demands it. I beg that you will not laugh, Monsieur
Moreau."</p>

<p>"I am not laughing, madame."</p>

<p>"You have great self-restraint. I had already observed it." The
dimples showed again in her cheeks. Then she swept on: "Madame's
train has been reduced to vanishing point by the King of Sardinia,
who looks upon us as locusts. Her only ladies besides myself were
to be the Duchess of Caylus and Madame de Gourbillon. But now, at
the last moment, her highness has insisted that Mademoiselle de
Kercadiou be added. Do you perceive the aim, and what must follow?
If she leaves Mademoiselle de Kercadiou in Coblentz, that may well
be the last that she will ever see of her. You may be married, you
two, or other circumstances may arise to prevent her from ever
returning to court. But if Mademoiselle remains at her side, in a
month&mdash;in two months at most&mdash;when this campaign is
ended, we shall be back at Versailles, and your Aline will again be
dangled before Monsieur, whose heart may have grown fonder in the
absence. You understand me, I think, Monsieur Moreau."</p>

<p>"Oh, perfectly, madame." His tone was stern and not without a
touch of reproof. "Even that in your calculations you leave out of
all account Mademoiselle de Kercadiou's strength of character and
virtue."</p>

<p>The Countess de Balbi shrugged, pursed her full lips and
smiled.</p>

<p>"Yes. You have the fine spirit of a lover: to regard the virtue
of his mistress as a rock. But I, who am a mere woman, and who,
therefore, know women, who have lived a little longer than you, and
who have spent this life of mine in courts, I tell you that it is
imprudent to ground your faith on nothing more. Virtue, when all is
said, is an idea. And ideas are governed by environment. The
environment of a court plays havoc with virtue, my friend. Accept
my word for it. You know, at least, that nothing will so quickly
wilt a woman's reputation as the attentions of a prince. There is a
glamour about the office which no cloddishness in the holder can
completely extinguish. Princes in a woman's eyes are heirs to all
the romance of the ages, even when they are as unromantic in
themselves as our poor King Louis."</p>

<p>"You tell me nothing that I do not know, madame."</p>

<p>"Ah, true!" her irony flashed out again. "I had almost forgotten
that you are a republican."</p>

<p>"Not so. I am a constitutional monarchist."</p>

<p>"Faith, that's accounted even worse here at Coblentz." She rose
abruptly. "I have said all that I came to say. The rest is for
you."</p>

<p>"And for Mademoiselle de Kercadiou."</p>

<p>She looked at him, and shook her head. She set a dainty hand
upon his arm. Her smile broke dazzlingly upon her roguish face.
"Are you so much the gentle, serving, docile lover? This will not
answer. A woman needs to be ordered by the man to whom she has
given the right. If you cannot prevent Mademoiselle de Kercadiou
from going to Turin, why, faith, you do not deserve to win her, and
you were better not to do so."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis considered her gravely. "I do not think that
I am very clever with women, madame," he confessed, and so far as I
can discover it is the only lack of cleverness to which he ever did
confess.</p>

<p>"You'll lack experience. Indeed, you have the air of it."</p>

<p>She drew still nearer to him. Her superb eyes glowed upon him,
magnetically disturbing. "Do you reserve for men all your audacity?
Your enterprise?"</p>

<p>He laughed, ill at ease, bewildered, almost struggling with an
odd intoxication.</p>

<p>She sighed. "Why, yes. I fear you do. Well, well! Time may
instruct you better. You shall be remembered in my prayers,
Monsieur Moreau."</p>

<p>She held out her hand to him. He took it and bent to kiss it.
Almost, he says&mdash;which is fantastic&mdash;he was conscious of
a response in it to the pressure of his lips.</p>

<p>"Madame," he murmured, "you leave me conscious of an
obligation."</p>

<p>"Repay me by your friendship, monsieur. Think kindly of Anne de
Balbi, if only because she thinks kindly of you."</p>

<p>She rustled out, flashed him a last smile as he held the door,
and was gone, leaving him deeply perturbed and thoughtful.</p>

<p>Her judgment of him had been quite accurate, he knew. Masterful
in all else, he had no masterfulness in love. And this because in
love he saw no place for mastery. Love was not a thing to be
snatched, constrained, compelled. To be worth possessing it must be
freely given.</p>

<p>Intensely practical in all else, in love he was entirely
idealistic. How could he assume the master's tone, the overseer's
whip, and command where he desired to worship? He could pray and
plead. But if Aline should desire to go to Turin&mdash;and he could
well understand her wish to see the world&mdash;upon what grounds
was he to plead with her against it? What grounds existed? Had he
so little faith in her that he must suppose her unable to withstand
temptation? And what, after all, was the temptation? He smiled at
the mental picture of the Comte de Provence as a wooer. To Aline in
such a guise the Prince could only be ridiculous.</p>

<p>In his utter trust in Aline, Andr&eacute;-Louis would have found
peace, but for another thought that assailed him. However Aline
might be proof against temptation, he could not endure the thought
of her being subjected to the pain and annoyance of an amorous
persecution. Because of this possibility he must oppose her journey
to Turin. Since he could not hope to succeed by prayers and pleas
which would appear to be merely selfish and unreasonable he would
have recourse to Scaramouche's weapons of intrigue.</p>

<p>He sought his godfather, and stood by the bedside. "You are
desperately ill, sir," he informed him.</p>

<p>The great night-capped head was agitated on its pillows; alarm
dawned in the eyes. "What do you tell me Andr&eacute;?"</p>

<p>"What we must both tell Aline. I have just learnt that it is
Madame's intention to bear her off in her train to Turin. I know of
no other way to oppose her going save by arousing her concern for
you. Therefore be good enough to become very ill indeed."</p>

<p>The greying eyebrows came together. "To Turin. Ah! And you do
not wish her to go?"</p>

<p>"Do you, monsieur?"</p>

<p>Monsieur de Kercadiou hesitated. The notion of parting with
Aline was a little desolating. It would leave him very lonely in
this exile amid his makeshift surroundings. But Monsieur de
Kercadiou's life had been spent in preferring the wishes of others
to his own.</p>

<p>"If it should be her desire...life here would be so dull for the
child...</p>

<p>"But infinitely healthier, monsieur." Andr&eacute;-Louis spoke
of the perilous frivolity of court-life. If Madame de Plougastel
had also been in Madame's train, things would have been different.
But in the circumstances Aline would be utterly alone. Her very
inexperience would render her vulnerable to the vexations that lie
in wait for a young lady of her attractions. And it was possible
that, however eager she might now be at the prospect, once she
found herself away from them in distant Savoy, she might be unhappy
and they would not be at hand to avail her.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Kercadiou sat up in bed, and gave him reason. Thus
it fell out that when Aline arrived a little later she found two
conspirators awaiting her.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis received her in the living-room. It was their
first meeting since that sub-acid parting at
Sch&ouml;nbornlust.</p>

<p>"I am so glad you have come, Aline. Monsieur de Kercadiou is not
well at all. His condition gives me anxiety. It is fortunate that
you are about to be relieved of your duties with Madame, for your
uncle requires more attention than can be expected from strangers
or than a clumsy fellow like myself is able to supply."</p>

<p>He saw the dismay that overspread her face, and guessed that it
sprang from more than concern for her uncle, however deep this
might be in her tender heart. Her resolve to continue on her
dignity with Andr&eacute;-Louis was blotted out.</p>

<p>"I was to have accompanied Madame to Turin," she said, in tones
of deepest disappointment.</p>

<p>His heart leapt at the tense she already used.</p>

<p>"It's an ill wind that blows no good at all," said he gently.
"You will be saved the discomforts of a tedious journey."</p>

<p>"Tedious! Oh, Andr&eacute;!"</p>

<p>He feigned astonishment. "You do not think it would be tedious?
Oh, but I assure you that it would be. And then the court of Turin!
It is notoriously drab and dull. My dear, you have had a near
escape. You are fortunate to be provided with so sound a reason for
begging Madame to excuse you. Come and see Monsieur de Kercadiou,
and tell me if you think a doctor should be summoned."</p>

<p>Thus he swept her away, the matter settled without discussion.
Monsieur de Kercadiou, a bad actor and a little shamefaced, played
his part none too well. He feared unnecessarily to alarm his niece,
and she would have departed entirely reassured but for
Andr&eacute;-Louis.</p>

<p>"It is necessary," he said, when they were outside the invalid's
door, "to persuade him that he is none so ill. He must not be
alarmed. I have done my best, as you see. But I certainly think
that we must have a doctor to him, and I shall be glad when you are
here, Aline. So will he, I know, although he would be the last to
let you suspect it."</p>

<p>And so there was no further mention of Turin. In her anxiety on
Monsieur de Kercadiou's behalf, Aline did not even await Madame's
departure to come and install herself at the Three Crowns. If
Madame did not dissemble her vexation, at least she could not
withhold the leave which was sought upon such dutiful grounds.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis congratulated himself upon a victory cheaply
bought. Neither he nor Madame de Balbi who had inspired it was to
guess how the battle of Valmy and its sequel were to falsify their
every calculation.</p>

<hr align="center" width="50%">
<a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII - VALMY</h2>

<p>The army of twenty-five thousand &eacute;migr&eacute;s grew
impatient with the dwindling of restricted resources, the greater
part of which had been laid out on handsome uniforms, fine horses
and other equipment to render them dazzling on parade. The Princes
had taken their place at the head of these glittering troops, a
matter of considerable distress to Monsieur, who, of sedentary
habits, detested all form of physical exertion. Destiny, however,
had cast him for a definite part, and that part he must play,
however much Nature, indifferent to Destiny's requirements, might
have denied him the necessary endowments.</p>

<p>In the rear of this fine host came the long train of lumbering
army wagons and among these two great wooden structures on wheels
which contained the Princes' mint; the printing press for the
manufacture of the false assignats which already were flooding and
distressing Europe. Monsieur solemnly promised that the King of
France would honour this paper currency. He had also promised that
it should not be put into circulation until France was reached. But
this promise had not been kept; and by his foreign hosts and allies
Monsieur was at last to be constrained to abandon this facile
method of supplementing the dwindling millions he had borrowed.</p>

<p>Side by side with the &eacute;migr&eacute;s marched the Prussian
and Austrian armies. The &eacute;migr&eacute;s fondly believed that
these legions marched solely to liberate the King, to purge France
of anarchy and restore her to her rightful owners; marched, in
fact&mdash;in that phrase which had been coined in
Coblentz&mdash;to the deliverance of Throne and Altar. Fatuous
assumptions, these, of men who believed themselves to be the elect
of Europe, in whose service humanity was ready altruistically to
immolate her children. They had not heard the Austrian Emperor's
epigram when invoked to rescue Marie Antoinette: "It is true that I
have a sister in France; but France is not my sister." Austria had
produced too many archduchesses to be deeply perturbed about the
fate of one of them, even though this one should have become Queen
of France. What really interested Austria was that Lorraine had
once belonged to her Princes and might now be re-possessed, just as
Prussia was intent upon the annexation of Franche-Comt&eacute;.
Here was an excellent opportunity for both to readjust the accounts
which had been disturbed by that megalomaniac Louis XIV when he
ravaged the Palatinate.</p>

<p>Of this, however, nothing was yet said, and there was as yet no
suspicion in &eacute;migr&eacute; breasts that the aims of their
allies were not identical with their own. But there were signs. The
King of Prussia doomed the Princes to nullity in the command. They
and their followers were to be observers rather than auxiliaries.
One of the things they observed was that in a measure as the armies
advanced, the Austrians planted their black-and-yellow frontier
posts surmounted by the double-headed Austrian eagle.</p>

<p>Longwy was taken, and the Prussians thrust upon Verdun,
devouring the contents of every village on their way and then
setting them on fire, in fulfilment of the threat in the Duke of
Brunswick's manifesto against all those who ventured to resist the
invasion.</p>

<p>The Princes had assured their allies that once they were upon
French soil, the French masses, emancipated by their presence from
the fear of the revolutionaries, would make haste to range
themselves on the side of Throne and Altar.</p>

<p>If the inclination existed at all the conduct of the Prussians
did not foster it.</p>

<p>On the 30th August they were before Verdun, which they occupied
after a short bombardment, and the road to Paris lay now open
before them.</p>

<p>News of this reaching Paris two days later produced the
September massacres.</p>

<p>La Fayette was gone. He perceived that constitutionalism was
ended, that an attainder of treason awaited him, and that nothing
remained for him but to depart. He crossed the frontier, intending
by way of Holland to reach the United States. But he fell into
enemy hands, and against all the usages of nations was to suffer
years of miserable imprisonment.</p>

<p>Dumouriez was sent to replace him, and to oppose to the steady,
magnificent troops of Austria and Prussia, to the fine flower of
French chivalry and three hundred guns, a ragged host barely
twenty-five thousand strong, ill-armed, untrained and
undisciplined, supported by forty pieces of ordnance.</p>

<p>That futile inter-cannonade ensued which is magniloquently known
as the Battle of Valmy, in which there were three hundred French,
and less than two hundred allied casualties. A mysterious affair
which profoundly puzzled Bonaparte later. Incomprehensibly it
marked the end of the invasion. The Prussians who had depended upon
living on the country were almost entirely without food, they were
knee-deep in mud, and ravaged by dysentery attributed to the chalky
water. The rain continued to distress them. The horizon was
black.</p>

<p>Brunswick advised retreat. The King of Prussia as well as the
&eacute;migr&eacute;s, who were now desperate, opposed him. They
wanted to risk a battle with the object of seizing Chalons. But
Brunswick objected that they would be setting too much upon the
board in such a gamble. He argued that a defeat would mean the loss
of the entire army, and that upon the army depended the fate of the
Prussian monarchy.</p>

<p>His Majesty was persuaded, and on the thirtieth of September
began the dreadful retreat of that great host, attended by rain,
mud, famine, and dysentery.</p>

<p>To the &eacute;migr&eacute;s, as you may read in the memoirs
which some of them have left, this abrupt eclipse of their
confident hopes, almost without a real battle having been fought,
represented the end of the world and was a thing inexplicable.
Unanimously, almost, in these m&eacute;moirs they declare
themselves bought and sold, betrayed by their allies, or else that
Brunswick was a Freemason and the march on Paris had been forbidden
him by the lodges. The first part of the accusation may be true.
For it is a fact that on his return to Germany the debt-ridden Duke
of Brunswick paid out eight millions to his creditors. If Bonaparte
had known this the victory of Valmy might have been less of a
mystery to him.</p>

<p>The exhausted army struggled back through lands that avenged the
ravages they had suffered. They could offer now no sustenance to
the starving ravagers. Men and horses dropped exhausted in their
tracks and lay to die where they fell or to be massacred by the
peasants who constantly harassed them, thirsting to repay the
destroyers of their homesteads. And for the &eacute;migr&eacute;s,
as they toiled fainting through the white glutinous mud of
Champagne, the peasants were not the only enemies to be feared. The
very Prussians, starving like themselves, turned upon them to
pillage their baggage, destroying, as is the way of pillagers, what
they could not carry off. And there were women and children with
the &eacute;migr&eacute;s, families which had followed the army in
carriages, so confident that they were going home. Now these
delicate ladies cumbered the retreat of that routed host, shared
the hardships and suffered indignities unspeakable which did not
end even at the Rhine. For having crossed it, they now found
themselves contemptuously in prey to the rapacity of the Germans,
who took every advantage of their misfortune to strip them by fraud
if not by violence of what little they might yet possess.</p>

<p>The dreadful news was borne by the first stragglers to Coblentz
at about the same time as the news that in Paris the King had been
deposed, the monarchy abolished and the Republic proclaimed by the
National Convention at the first of its deliberations.</p>

<p>Louis XVI had been removed to the Temple a prisoner; and there
were even rumours that he was to be brought to trial, attainted of
treason in that he had invited foreigners in arms to invade
France.</p>

<p>This news brought dismay to a little house on the
Gr&uuml;nplatz, which Madame de Plougastel had rented upon the
departure of the Princes, and where her cousin Kercadiou, his niece
and Andr&eacute;-Louis were lodged with her. It put an end to the
term of happiness which had reigned there for the last five weeks.
The Princes, they presently heard, were at Namur and the Comte de
Plougastel was with them.</p>

<p>For Madame de Plougastel, the immediate outlook was not too
disconcerting. She was supplied if not with money at least with the
valuable jewels she had brought away with her, and these should
provide for many a day. But the Lord of Gavrillac was at the end of
his resources, and compelled at last, for the first time in his
life to bend his mind to the sordid details of provision for his
existence.</p>

<p>It was for Andr&eacute;-Louis to come to the rescue. In the
prosperous days of his fencing academy in Paris, seeking an
investment for his considerable savings, he had purchased a farm in
Saxony. This land he now proposed to re-convert into gold so as to
provide for their needs.</p>

<p>With twenty Louis borrowed from Madame de Plougastel, the half
of the sum she pressed upon him, he set out for Dresden to
negotiate the sale. All that we know of his activities there during
the next four months is contained in two letters that survive out
of several which appear to have passed between him and those he had
left behind in Coblentz. The first of these is written from Dresden
at the end of December.</p>

<blockquote><i>Monsieur my Godfather, An offer at last for these
lands of mine at Heimthal has been made of six thousand crowns,
which is to say thirty thousand limes. I paid, as I think you know,
over two thousand louis for them two years ago, and the purchase
was represented to me as a bargain at the time, and rightly so, as
far as I am able to judge from an inspection of the property. The
offer comes from the present Saxon tenant, who is imbued with the
rascally acquisitive instincts commonly, but not on that account
correctly, attributed to Hebrews. I say this the more feelingly
since my mentor in these matters is a Jew named Ephraim, but for
whose honesty I should long since have found myself in
difficulties. Acting as my banker here, he has regularly collected
rents and paid dues, and in consequence I find some six hundred
crowns at my disposal, no inconsiderable sum in such times as
these. It enables me, my dear godfather, to send you a draft on
Stoffel of Coblentz for two hundred crowns, which will provide for
your immediate necessities and those of my dear Aline.</i><br>
<br>

<p><i>My good Ephraim points out to me that my tenant, actuated by
the universal spirit in Germany at present towards French Émigrés,
hopes to trade upon my necessity and obtain the farm; or one half
of its value. He advises that sooner than submit to be robbed I
should rid myself of this tenant, and until some honest Purchaser
presents himself, I should farm the land myself. There is certainly
a living in it, if a modest one. But my inclinations are hardly
agrarian. Considering that the state of things in France becomes
steadily worse and encourages little hope of an early return to
Gavrillac, which by now, moreover, will have suffered confiscation,
it is necessary to do something to keep ourselves afloat. I revert
to my erstwhile notion of turning to account my knowledge of the
sword. I have talked of it with Ephraim and on the security of the
Heimthal property he will advance me the funds necessary to open
and equip here in Dresden an academy of arms, which I do not doubt
my capacity of rendering as prosperous as my old school in the Rue
du Hasard.</i><br>
<br>
</p>

<p><i>This is a pleasant town, with an agreeable society, in which
once it were perceived that you are independent, you would find a
cordial reception. I beg you, my dear godfather, to give it thought
and write to me. If you decide to join me I shall at once set about
carrying my project into effect, and at the same time discover a
suitable lodging for us all. It is not Peru that I offer you; but
at least it is modest comfort and tranquillity. I add a little
letter for Aline.</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He also adds inquiries on their health and recommends himself to
the remembrance of Madame de Plougastel.</p>

<p>The other surviving letter, from which we are similarly enabled
to gather the march of events, is from the Lord of Gavrillac. It is
dated from Hamm in Westphalia, on the fourth of the following
February.</p>

<blockquote>My dear Godson,<br>
<br>

<p><i>I write within a few hours of our arrival here to let you
know that we are now at Hamm, where Monseigneur the Comte de
Provence and Monseigneur the Comte d'Artois, by the hospitality of
the King of Prussia, have established themselves. Monsieur de
Plougastel is in their very restricted train, and has desired
Madame de Plougastel to join him here. Monsieur, learning that
Madame de Plougastel and I were together at Coblentz, was very
graciously moved, no doubt from his affection for my late brother,
since I have done nothing to deserve it for myself, to offer me
also the hospitality of his very diminutive court. And so we have
all come here together, and we are lodged at the Bear, a house kept
by kindly folk, and not expensive. The plight of the Princes is
pitiful in the extreme, and their quarters in Hamm are utterly
unworthy of persons of their exalted rank.</i><br>
<br>
</p>

<p><i>The hospitality of his Majesty the King of Prussia scarcely
goes beyond permission to reside here. Hope of redemption seems to
diminish daily. Yet the courage and fortitude of these Princes in
adversity is beyond belief, as it is beyond praise even in this
black hour when news comes from Paris of the horrible, incredible,
sacrilegious crime of the canaille in putting the King to death.
Monsieur has issued a declaration in which he assumes the regency,
proclaims the Dauphin King of France, and nobly announces his sole
ambition to be to avenge the blood of his brother, to break the
chains which trammel his family, to place the Dauphin on the
throne, and to restore to France her ancient constitution.</i><br>
<br>
</p>

<p><i>We are still, as Aline will have told you in her last letter,
under the same difficulty of making a decision for the future.
Rabouillet has contrived, at considerable peril to himself, to send
me fifty Louis saved before the confiscations took place, and he
tells me also good loyal soul, that he has buried the best of the
silver so that it should not be seized. Almost I begin to think
that your proposal which we treated perhaps too lightly at the
time, offers the only practical relief of our difficulties. But I
am reluctant to become a burden upon you, my dear godson, nor have
I the right.</i><br>
<br>
</p>

<p><i>Aline is well, and she sends you her affectionate greetings
with mine. She talks of you constantly from which it follows that
her thoughts are constantly with you and that she misses you. This
separation is not the least of our sorrows. But you are wise not to
sell your land at a sacrifice in a time when we do not know where
to look for our next resources.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>
<h2>CHAPTER IX - PROPOSAL</h2>

<p>Three days after the receipt of that letter and a week after it
was written, Andr&eacute;-Louis appeared abruptly and unannounced
in the town of Hamm, lying at the time under a pall of snow through
which the river Lippe flowed like a stream of ink.</p>

<p>Two sentences in the letter were responsible for that
precipitate journey: "I am reluctant to be a burden upon you," was
one of them, and the allusion to the sorrow of the separation the
other.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis came in person to demonstrate that this
sorrow at least could be determined and to combat his godfather's
scruples to receive assistance from him&mdash;scruples which he
regarded as fantastic.</p>

<p>He found the Bear to be a quite considerable inn, far better
than his first view of this low-lying little town on the
Lippe&mdash;not, indeed, much more than a village&mdash;would have
led him to expect. A staircase of polished pine ascended from the
common room to a gallery about three sides of which the guest
chambers were set, and the three best of these, despite shrinking
funds and hazardous outlook, had been appropriated by the Lord of
Gavrillac for himself and his niece.</p>

<p>Monsieur and Madame de Plougastel occupied a similar lodging on
the ground floor behind the common room, and two or three others of
those who made up the simulacrum of a court for the Regent of
France were also housed at the Bear.</p>

<p>It was late afternoon when Andr&eacute;-Louis drew rein in the
crisp-edged slush that was beginning to freeze before the door of
the inn.</p>

<p>Armstadt, the landlord, lounged forward, and perceiving an
unattended traveller on a jaded post-horse with an insignificant
valise strapped to his saddle, did not account it necessary to put
aside his porcelain pipe. But the brisk, peremptory tone in which
the traveller asked for the Lord of Gavrillac, the look in his dark
eyes, the sword he wore and the holsters in the saddle aroused the
landlord from his languor.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis' advent took them by surprise. Aline and
Monsieur de Kercadiou were together when he entered the room on the
gallery to which the landlord ushered him. They started up, crying
his name in amazement and then in gladness. Each seized him by a
hand to demand an explanation.</p>

<p>His lips sped from his godfather's hand to the lips of Aline,
which never had been more freely offered. Her eyes sparkled with
delight, and yet, with fond concern in their depths, scanned every
line of his countenance.</p>

<p>The reception warmed him like wine. He glowed in this atmosphere
of affection. All was very well. He was glad that he had come.</p>

<p>He was treated like the prodigal. At supper, which out of
consideration for him was served almost immediately, a goose filled
the role of the fatted calf, and there was the ham of a boar from
the Black Forest and a flagon of smooth perfumed golden
Rupertsberger into which the essences of a whole Rhineland summer
had been distilled.</p>

<p>For folk upon the brink of destitution it was none so bad,
thought Andr&eacute;-Louis.</p>

<p>Across the white napery, where glassware sparkled in the
candlelight, he silently, happily, toasted Aline, and found his
toast returned by moist eyes agleam with a new tenderness.</p>

<p>After supper he told them precisely what had brought him. He was
there to combat his godfather's reluctance to allow him to provide
for them in the only way in which he was capable of doing it.</p>

<p>He invited his godfather to look the facts in the face, to give
due weight to the events in France: the King beheaded, the monarchy
abolished, the estates of the nobles confiscated, their land
distributed among "those who had no land," as if to have had land
in the past were now a crime to be punished, and not to have had it
until now a virtue to be rewarded.</p>

<p>"Just as the Third Estate wrested power from the aristocracy,
intending to distribute it equitably throughout the entire nation,
so now the rabble has wrested power from the Third, intending to
monopolize it. Privilege is changing hands. Instead of privilege in
the palace, in the hands of men who by birth and breeding are
naturally fitted for government, however in the past they may have
abused it, we have now privilege in the gutter. The land wrested
from its owners for distribution, the moveables dispersed and sold
for the benefit of the nation, are the bribes with which a gang of
greedy scoundrels incites the populace to place the power in their
hands. This ignorant populace, deluded and flattered by them,
sustains by weight of numbers the men who make this use of it. The
ultimate result must be chaos and the ruin of France. Then, either
by force of arms or otherwise, a new state may be built on these
ruins; and order, equity and security shall again prevail.
Restitution may well be among its first activities. But the process
must be slow as time is measured in the lives of men. What will you
do while you wait? How will you live until then?"</p>

<p>"But my claim on you, Andr&eacute;?" cried the Lord of
Gavrillac, in repudiation.</p>

<p>"Will be the claim of kinship once Aline and I are married.
Think of us, my godfather. Are we to let our youth run to waste in
waiting for events that may not happen in our lifetime?" He turned
to Aline. "Surely, my dear, you agree with me. You see no gain in
this postponement?"</p>

<p>She smiled frankly and tenderly. Indeed, the tenderness she
displayed to him that night was to be a lasting memory of the
happiest hours he had ever known.</p>

<p>"My dear, in this I have no will that is not yours."</p>

<p>Monsieur de Kercadiou got up. He sighed. Perhaps the very source
of Andr&eacute;-Louis' exaltation that night was to him a source of
sadness. The utter surrender to Andr&eacute;-Louis revealed by
Aline's tone and manner, brought him perhaps a sudden sense of
loneliness. For years this niece, who was dear as a daughter, had
been all his family. He grew conscious now that he had lost
her.</p>

<p>He stood there a moment, a squat, brooding figure in his brown
velvet coat, his great head, which always seemed too heavy for his
body, sinking forward until his chin was on the laces at his neck.
"Well, well!" he said huskily. "We'll sleep on it, and talk of it
again to-morrow."</p>

<p>But in the morning he postponed discussion until later. He could
not stay for it then. He explained that he had duties to perform in
the Regent's chancellery which kept him engaged daily until a
little after noon.</p>

<p>"We are a very few to compose Monsieur's household," he said
sadly. "Each of us must do what he can."</p>

<p>At the door he paused. "We will talk of it all at dinner.
Meanwhile, I shall mention the matter to his highness. Oh, and as I
go I shall send word to Madame de Plougastel that you are
here."</p>

<p>The sun was shining out of a clear, frosty sky, and the snow
under foot was crisp as salt. After Madame de Plougastel had paid
them a short visit, in the course of which she gave encouragement
to the plan of early marriage and the rest, Aline and
Andr&eacute;-Louis went forth to take the air. Light of heart as
children they walked down the main street to the bridge, and here
they turned to follow a footpath by the glittering river about the
edge of which films of ice were slowly dissolving in the sun.</p>

<p>Their talk now was of the future. He described a house with a
fair garden on the outskirts of Dresden, which he had in view,
which could be rented and to the renting of which Ephraim would
help him. "But a little place, Aline; no greater than a cottage in
truth, and not the setting in which I would desire to see you
placed."</p>

<p>Hanging on his arm, she drew closer to him. "My dear, it will be
ours," she said in a crooning tone, and so closed the argument in
rapture.</p>

<p>Never, not since the incredible hour of her surrender on that
August morning following the day on which he had brought her out of
the horrors of Paris, had he known Aline so yielding, so meekly
loving, so entirely his own. Always had there been a measure of
restraint, and her will, as we know, had clashed more than once
against his own. Now such a thing seemed impossible ever again, so
discarded by her was all reserve, so submissive was she, so eager
to please.</p>

<p>It may have been his protracted absence that had rendered her
aware of the true depth of her feelings for him, brought her to
realize how necessary he had become to her happiness, to her
existence.</p>

<p>They came to a fence that ran down to the murmuring water.
Beyond it a little rivulet tumbled into the Lippe over a miniature
cascade, at the sides of which long icicles glittered iridescent in
the morning sun. At her request he hoisted her to the fence, so
that she might rest a moment before they retraced their steps.
Having set her there, he stood before her, and her hands were on
his shoulders, and her blue eyes smiled softly into his.</p>

<p>"I am so glad, Andr&eacute;, so glad, so glad that we are not to
part again, that this time you have come to me to stay."</p>

<p>He heard the words and, intoxicated by the fond tone in which
they were uttered, he missed the faint note of fear that beat in
the heart of it, that may have been the very source of her
utterance. He kissed her. Her face close to his, she looked deep
into his eyes.</p>

<p>"It is for always, Andr&eacute;?"</p>

<p>"For always, dear love. For always," he answered in a solemn
voice that made the phrase a vow.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X - DISPOSAL</h2>

<p>The Count of Provence&mdash;Regent of France since the execution
of his brother, Louis XVI&mdash;sat at a writing-table in the
window of a large, low-ceilinged room that was at once study,
audience-chamber and salon d'honneur, in the wooden ch&acirc;let at
Hamm that he was permitted to occupy by the indulgence of the King
of Prussia. His highness was learning in the bitter school of
experience that friends are for the fortunate.</p>

<p>Some few there were who clung to him. But these were men,
mutatis mutandi, in his own sad case; men who served him, and
continued to discern in him princely qualities, because their
future was bound up with his own.</p>

<p>Nevertheless his confidence was as unabated as his corpulence.
He preserved at once his bulk and his faith in himself and destiny.
He maintained upon slenderest means and in almost ignoble
surroundings a sort of state. Four ministers were appointed to deal
with his affairs, and with two secretaries and four servants, made
up his establishment and that of his brother, the Comte d'Artois,
who had joined him here after having been arrested for debt at
Maastricht. He had his ambassadors at all the courts of Europe; and
to accelerate the inevitable he spent long hours daily writing
letters in that fine, precise, upright hand of his to his
brother-rulers and to his sister-ruler, Catherine of Russia, in
whom he founded considerable hopes. One or two of his
correspondents meanwhile lent him a little money.</p>

<p>The only ladies attached to this court of his were Madame de
Plougastel and Mademoiselle de Kercadiou, the wife of one and the
niece of the other of the two gentlemen who were at present acting
as his secretaries. The Countess of Provence and her sister, the
Countess of Artois, remained forgotten in Turin at the court of
their father. Madame de Balbi, whose joyous nature found no scope
at the dour court of his Sardinian majesty and whose sybaritic
tastes could not have endured for a day the monastic privations of
Hamm, had established herself at Brussels, whilst awaiting those
better times which now seemed to recede instead of approaching. A
genuine affection for her being one of his redeeming
characteristics, Monsieur could not bring himself to send for her
and doom her to these Westphalian hardships. Besides, it was always
possible that she would have refused to come.</p>

<p>From its scant, severe furnishings you might almost judge the
room he now occupied to have been a monastery parlour. Gone were
the white-and-gold walls, the long mirrors, the crystal
chandeliers, the soft carpets, the rich brocades and the gilt
furniture of Sch&ouml;nbornlust. The only armchair present, and
this with a simple serge cushion, was that which his highness
occupied at his plain writing-table. For the rest, a chestnut press
against one wall, some plain chairs of oak or elm set about a table
of polished pine, made up the room's equipment. There was no carpet
on the floor. The window by which his highness's table was set
looked out upon a desolate and untidy garden.</p>

<p>In attendance upon him now were the young and delicate d'Avaray,
who was virtually his first minister of State; the tall, dry,
capable Baron de Flachslanden, his minister for Foreign Affairs;
the dark, restless d'Entragues, most active and zealous of secret
agents and most accomplished libertine; the Comte de Jaucourt, who
still performed the daily miracle of an irreproachable elegance of
apparel and who preserved the nimbus of romance which his
gallantries had earned him; the short, stocky self-sufficient Comte
de Plougastel; and, lastly, Monsieur de Kercadiou.</p>

<p>It was to Monsieur de Kercadiou that his highness was now
particularly addressing himself, whilst really speaking to them
all.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Kercadiou, not without some hesitation, had
suggested the possibility of his early retirement from the
inconsiderable duties which his highness graciously permitted him
to discharge.</p>

<p>His niece was about to marry Monsieur Moreau, who, to support
her, would open an academy of arms in Dresden. Monsieur de
Kercadiou was offered a home with them, and as his resources were
dwindling and the prospects of a return to France were now remote,
he did not think that he could in prudence or in justice oppose the
plan of the young people.</p>

<p>Dark grew the Prince's fleshly countenance as he listened. The
handsome liquid eyes considered the Br&eacute;ton gentleman in
surprise and displeasure.</p>

<p>"Prudence and justice, eh?" He smiled between wistfulness and
scorn. "Frankly, monsieur, I perceive neither the one nor the
other." He paused there a moment, and then abruptly asked: "What is
this man Moreau?"</p>

<p>"He is my godson, monseigneur."</p>

<p>Monsieur clucked impatiently. "Yes, yes. That we know, as also
that he was a revolutionary, one of the gentlemen responsible for
the present ruin. But what else is he?"</p>

<p>"What else? Why, by profession, originally a lawyer. He was
educated at Louis-le-Grand."</p>

<p>Monsieur nodded. "I understand. You evade my question. The
answer being really that he is nobody's son. Yet you do not
hesitate to permit your niece, a person of birth and distinction,
to enter into this m&eacute;salliance."</p>

<p>"I do not," said Monsieur de Kercadiou dryly. In reality,
although he concealed it, since it was a sentiment impossible to
display to royalty, he was moved to indignation.</p>

<p>"You do not?" The thick black brows were raised. The fine eyes
opened a little wider in astonishment. Monsieur looked at his
gentlemen: at Monsieur d'Avaray leaning on the window-sill beside
him, at the other four who made a group by the table in
mid-chamber. His expression clearly invited them to share his
amazement.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Plougastel was heard to utter a short soft
laugh.</p>

<p>"Your highness forgets the debt under which I lie to Monsieur
Moreau," said the Lord of Gavrillac in an attempt to defend at once
himself and his godson. He stood immediately before the Regent's
writing-table, with a deepened colour in his pink, pockmarked face,
a troubled look in his pale eyes.</p>

<p>Monsieur was sententious. "No debt in the world between yourself
and Monsieur Moreau can demand payment in such coin."</p>

<p>"But the young people love each other," Monsieur de Kercadiou
protested.</p>

<p>Monsieur displayed his irritation in a frown. Again he replied
sententiously.</p>

<p>"A young maid's fancy is easily captivated. It is the duty of
her natural guardians to shield her from the consequences of a
passing exaltation."</p>

<p>"I cannot so regard her sentiments, monseigneur."</p>

<p>His highness considered, then set himself to reason. As a
raisonneur he held himself in high esteem.</p>

<p>"I can understand that you should be deceived by our unhappy
circumstances, circumstances which, unless we are vigilant, may
lead to the loss of our sense of values. You are in danger of this,
I think, my dear Gavrillac. Common misfortune acting as a leveller
makes you lose sight of the difference, the ineffaceable
difference, that lies between persons born, like yourself and your
niece, and a man such as Monsieur Moreau. You are driven by
circumstances to admit inferiors to a sort of equality, you are
constrained to accept favours from them which dispose you to forget
that their place is still below the salt. I cannot presume to
command you in this matter, my dear Gavrillac. But let me exhort
you very earnestly, and entirely as a friend, to delay all decision
until you are happily restored to Gavrillac, and the things of this
world once more assume their proper relative proportions. Then you
will no longer be in danger, as now, of having your judgment
falsified."</p>

<p>Overwhelmed by this oration from royal lips, whose utterances
generations of loyalty to an idea rendered oracular in the ears of
men of his simple straightforward mind, Monsieur de Kercadiou found
himself in an agony of perplexity. The perspiration stood on his
brow. But still he braced himself to hold his ground.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur," he argued desperately, "it is precisely because
his return to Gavrillac seems now so remote, because we are in
sight of the end of our resources, that common prudence demands
that my niece should avail herself of the protection and provision
of this marriage."</p>

<p>The Regent drummed impatiently upon the table. "Are you really
of so little faith, that you speak of your return to Gavrillac,
which is to say our return to France, as a thing remote?"</p>

<p>"Alas, monseigneur! What else can I believe?"</p>

<p>"What else? What else?" Again Monsieur looked at the others as
if inviting them to share his impatience at such blindness. "Surely
you fail to read the signs. Yet they are very plain."</p>

<p>And now at last he launched upon a political discourse, which
summed up the European situation as he perceived it. He began by
pointing out that whatever apathy might hitherto have existed among
the sovereigns of Europe towards the events in France, this had at
last been rudely dispelled by the monstrous crime of the execution
of the King. Hitherto those rulers might have thought of advantages
to themselves in the paralysis which the revolution had laid upon
France. They might have imagined that they would be strengthened by
her removal from competition in the world's affairs. But now all
this was changed.</p>

<p>France as now governed was rightly perceived to be a canker-spot
of anarchy, a peril to civilization. Already the revolutionaries
were disclosing their aims to reform the whole world in accordance
with their own ideas&mdash;ideas which must always find response
among the worthless of every nation, for they were ideas which gave
the worthless the opportunities from which in a well-ordered
society their worthlessness must exclude them; in France the lowest
scoundrels, the very riff-raff of the nation, were in the saddle,
and their agents abroad were already at work disseminating these
pestilent, poisonous, anarchial doctrines: in Switzerland, in
Belgium, in Italy and in England the first hissings of this foul
serpent were already to be heard.</p>

<p>Could any man of vision really suppose that the great powers of
Europe would remain indifferent in the face of this? Was it not
evident that for their own sake, for the sake of their
self-preservation, they must rise up without delay and unite in
extirpating this canker, in delivering France from her present evil
thraldom, and purifying her of her disease before the contagion
spread to themselves?</p>

<p>Already from England, from Russia, from Austria and elsewhere,
Monsieur's agents wrote to inform him that activity was astir.
D'Entragues could tell them of the extent of this, of the imminence
of action, decisive action which must bring the revolutionaries to
their knees at any moment. That very morning d'Entragues, as he
could tell them, had received word that England had now joined the
coalition against France. It was great news if they properly
considered its significance. Hitherto, Pitt had been profiting by
the French revolution to magnify England, just as Richelieu had
profited by the English crisis of 1640 to ensure the ascendancy of
France. Yet now they heard that Chauvelin, the Republican minister
in London, had been dismissed from the court of St. James's. There
was a state of war between England and revolutionary France.</p>

<p>"Revive your faith, then, my dear Gavrillac," the Regent
concluded. "Postpone decisions wrung from you by present transient
necessities. As for these, had I but known that they are pressing,
restricted as are the means at my disposal, I could not have
consented to receive without remuneration the valuable secretarial
services you have been discharging. D'Avaray here will provide for
that in the future. You will see to it at once, d'Avaray; so that
from now onwards our good Gavrillac need be under no financial
anxiety."</p>

<p>Confused, confounded, shamed out of all further resistance,
Monsieur de Kercadiou began a quavering protest.</p>

<p>"Ah, but, monseigneur, aware as I am of the slenderness of your
own resources, I could not accept&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was interrupted almost sternly. "Not another word, monsieur.
I do no more than my duty by a zealous servant in depriving him of
every pretext to run counter to my wishes."</p>

<p>Bewildered, Monsieur de Kercadiou could only bow submission, and
then a knock at the door came to seal a discussion which his
highness had indicated was at an end. M. de Kercadiou moved away,
mopping his brow.</p>

<p>Plougastel went to open. A servant in plain livery entered and
stood murmuring to the Count. The Count turned to the Regent. His
pompous, affected voice made an announcement.</p>

<p>"Monsieur de Batz is here, monseigneur."</p>

<p>"Monsieur de Batz!" There was surprise in the tone. The fleshly
face grew set, the full sensual mouth tightened. "Monsieur de
Batz!" he repeated, this time on a note of scorn. "He has returned
then? For what has he returned?" He looked round as he asked the
question.</p>

<p>"Would it not be well to let him tell you, monseigneur?"
ventured d'Entragues.</p>

<p>The liquid eyes stared at him from under knit brows. Then his
highness shrugged his heavy shoulders, and spoke to Plougastel.
"Very well. Let him be admitted since he has the effrontery to
present himself."</p>

<hr align="center" width="50%">
<a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XI - THE SPLENDID FAILURE</h2>

<p>That Monsieur de Batz was certainly not lacking in effrontery,
his carriage showed. He came in with a swagger.</p>

<p>Although he had arrived in Hamm within the hour, he displayed no
stains of travel. A person of neat, tidy habits, he had carefully
restored himself to order at the inn. He wore an apricot velvet
coat and black satin smalls, stockings of black silk, and
red-heeled shoes with silver buckles. He carried a three-cornered
hat adorned by a white cockade. His brown hair was carefully
clubbed.</p>

<p>He came forward briskly, his keen lively eyes throwing passing
glances of recognition at the attendant gentlemen. He halted,
waited a moment for the Regent to extend his hand; but he was
nowise abashed when this did not happen. He bowed, his face set in
lines of utmost gravity, and waited as the etiquette prescribed for
his highness to address him.</p>

<p>The Regent, half twisted in his chair, considered him without
friendliness.</p>

<p>"So you have returned, Monsieur de Batz. We were not expecting
you." He paused, and added coldly, "We are not pleased with you,
Monsieur de Batz."</p>

<p>"Faith, I'm not pleased with myself," said the Baron whom
nothing could put out of countenance.</p>

<p>"We wonder that you should have troubled to return."</p>

<p>"I come to render my accounts, monseigneur."</p>

<p>"They are rendered. The events have rendered them. They have
very fully reported your failure."</p>

<p>The Gascon knit his brows. "With submission, monseigneur, I
cannot control Fate. I cannot say to Destiny 'Halte-l&agrave;! It
is de Batz who passes.'"</p>

<p>"Ah! You lay the blame on Destiny? She is the scapegoat of every
incompetent."</p>

<p>"I am not of those, monseigneur. If I were not extremely
competent, I should not be here. By now I should have put my head
through the little window of the guillotine in Paris.</p>

<p>"Your failure leaves you unabashed, sir."</p>

<p>"Failure must be measured by the attempt. I attempted a miracle
with no more than ordinary human powers."</p>

<p>"You were very confident of being able to perform it when you
induced us to entrust you with the task."</p>

<p>"Will your highness suffer a question? Was there amongst all the
twenty thousand French exiles who followed you at the time any
other who begged to be entrusted with it?"</p>

<p>"Another might have been found. I should have sought him, no
doubt, but for your overweening confidence in your own powers to
save the King."</p>

<p>Still de Batz kept his countenance in the face of this monstrous
obstinacy in ingratitude. But he could not quite exclude asperity
from his reply.</p>

<p>"Your highness would have sought him had it occurred to you that
such an attempt was possible. It does not follow that your highness
would have found him. But it does follow that had you found him he
must have failed."</p>

<p>"Must have failed? And why, if you please?"</p>

<p>"Because I failed. And where I failed, I'll take leave to inform
your highness that no man could have succeeded."</p>

<p>In the group by the table behind him someone laughed. De Batz
quivered as if he had been struck. But it was scarcely perceptible,
and beyond this he gave no sign. Monsieur was regarding him in cold
incredulity.</p>

<p>"Still, and in spite of all, the boastful Gascon!"</p>

<p>This was too much even for de Batz's self-control. He permitted
his tone to express an infinite bitterness. "Your highness is
pleased to rebuke me."</p>

<p>His highness was annoyed by the imputation of injustice. "Have
you not deserved it, monsieur? Did you not win our trust by your
emphatic assertions, your boastful promises? Did you not pledge me
your word that you would bring the King safely out of Paris if I
would entrust you with the means? I gave liberally all that you
demanded out of a treasury from which we could ill spare the gold;
gold which to-day might be used to nourish French gentlemen who are
starving in exile. What have you done with this gold?"</p>

<p>The Baron audibly caught his breath. His intrepid countenance
had turned pale under its healthy tan. "I can assure your highness
that I have not used a <i>louis</i> of it to my own advantage."</p>

<p>"I do not ask you what you have not done with it. But what you
have done."</p>

<p>"Your highness requires accounts of me?"</p>

<p>"Is not that the purpose of your return? To render your
accounts?"</p>

<p>The Baron shifted his position, so that by a half-turn of his
head he could survey every man in the room. His glittering eyes
looked at the pallid d'Avaray, still leaning on the window-sill.
The favourite's face was a mask. The Gascon's glance travelled on.
Flachslanden and Plougastel were rigidly glum. Kercadiou showed a
countenance of gentle sympathy. D'Entragues was sneering, and de
Batz remembered how from the outset d'Entragues&mdash;jealous of
any secret-agent work of which he was not himself the instigator
and guide&mdash;had opposed the undertaking, had stigmatized it as
crackbrained and impossible, and had argued against the supply of
means for it.</p>

<p>At the end of that moment's utter silence the Baron spoke very
quietly.</p>

<p>"I have kept no accounts in detail. I had not thought that it
would be required of me. I am not a trader to keep ledgers,
monseigneur; and this is not an affair of trade. But from memory I
will do my best to prepare a statement. Meanwhile I can assure you,
monseigneur, that the sums expended amount to more than twice those
which I had from your highness."</p>

<p>"What do you tell me, sir? Is this another Gasconnade! Whence
could you have procured the money?"</p>

<p>"If I say that I procured it, it must follow that I did. For,
although a Gascon, I have found no one yet of a temerity to doubt
my honour or to assume that I might soil myself by falsehood. I
spent the gold in corrupting some of the easily corruptible
canaille that has charge of the administration in France to-day.
Every man who could be of service to me, who could assist me in my
design, I bribed to neglect his duty.</p>

<p>"For the rest, monseigneur, my failure is to be attributed to
two factors which I did not take into account when I entered upon
this difficult and hazardous undertaking. The first of these is the
fact that the King was already a closely-guarded prisoner when I
reached Paris. I arrived some few days too late for the plan which
I had in mind. And for that delay, if you will do me the justice,
monseigneur, to carry your mind back to Coblentz, when first I laid
my plans before you, the blame attaches to Monsieur
d'Entragues."</p>

<p>D'Entragues started in surprise to exclaim angrily "To me, sir?
To me?"</p>

<p>"To you, sir," snapped de Batz, glad at last to fasten his teeth
in someone who was not shielded by rank. "Had you not contemned my
design, argued against it with his highness, described it as a
reckless gamble of means that could not be spared, I should have
started three weeks earlier. I should have been in Paris while the
King was still at large in the Luxembourg, a full fortnight before
he was conveyed a prisoner to the Temple; and my task would have
been easy."</p>

<p>"We have your word for that," said d'Entragues, with a curling
lip and a sidelong glance at Monsieur.</p>

<p>"You have, and you will be wise not to doubt it," said the Baron
sharply, so sharply that the Regent rapped the table to remind them
of his presence and the deference due to him.</p>

<p>"The second cause of your failure, Monsieur de Batz?" he asked,
to keep him to the point.</p>

<p>"This lay in a danger of which I was always aware, but the risk
of which I must accept. Finding my original intentions frustrated
by his majesty's captivity, I was under the necessity of
formulating another plan of campaign. A choice of alternatives
presented itself. Rightly or wrongly, I decided that an
eleventh-hour rescue was the one that offered the best chances. I
am still persuaded that I made a wise choice and that but for
betrayal I should have succeeded. The organization of this attempt
called for infinite labour, infinite caution, infinite patience.
All these I was able to supply. I got together a little band of
royalists, entrusting to each of them the enlisting of others. Soon
we were five hundred strong, and in constant touch with one
another. These five hundred I instructed, equipped and armed there
in Paris under the nose of the Convention and its Office of
Surveillance. I spent money freely to accomplish it.</p>

<p>"When it was clear that his Majesty would be brought to trial
and that the sentence was foregone, I completed my plan of action.
It was plain to all that whilst the more abandoned of the rabble
would look with satisfaction upon the execution of the King, the
main body of the people would regard it with fear and horror. This
main body was dominated by the noisy aggressiveness of a minority;
but a bold call at the right moment would arouse it from its
paralysis. There is a glamour about the person of a consecrated
king. He is less a human being than a symbol, the incarnation of an
idea; and to all men of any imagination or sensibility there is a
repugnance to see violence done to him. I founded my hopes upon
this. I would post my five hundred at a convenient point, which the
King must pass on his way to execution. When he reached it I would
give the signal. My five hundred would raise the cry of 'Live the
King!' and hurl themselves upon the guards."</p>

<p>He paused for a moment. The seven men in the room, caught in the
spell of his exposition, seemed scarcely to breathe. All eyes were
upon him.</p>

<p>"Can your highness doubt&mdash;can anyone doubt&mdash;what must
have followed? My five hundred would have supplied the nucleus for
a massed rising to rescue his Majesty. They would have supplied the
cutting edge to an axe that would have derived its weight of metal
from those who would instantly have flocked to join them. The
paralysis of the majority would have been broken." He sighed.
"Alas! Could any of you have been there as I was, at the appointed
place, at the corner of the Rue de la Lune, under the bastion of
the Bonne Nouvelle, could you have seen as I saw, the awe in the
ranks of those who waited to see the royal carriage pass on its way
to the Place de la Revolution as they now call the Place Louis XV,
could you have observed the scared silence of those thousands, you
would not have doubted what must follow upon my rallying cry and
the dash of my five hundred.</p>

<p>"Standing there, waiting in the crowd, I was not only confident
of success for the immediate design, but I had more than a hope to
start a conflagration in which the revolution would have been
consumed. Given such a rallying-point as we should have provided
for the thousands who mistrust the new r&eacute;gime and view with
horror the spread of anarchy and confusion, but who stand
spellbound for lack of resolute leadership, we might have brought
about such a rising as would have carried the King back to his
throne and swept away for ever the Convention and its supporting
rabble."</p>

<p>He paused again, and smiled wryly upon their intentness.</p>

<p>"But I was Gasconnading, as you would say, monseigneur. Of what
use to continue? I failed. Let that alone be remembered. The
intelligence to plot, the skill to combine, the energy and courage
that were ready to execute, of what account are these when the goal
is missed? When the narrow line that sometimes lies between success
and failure has not been crossed?"</p>

<p>His sarcasm stung them. Yet his highness overlooked it in the
breathless interest de Batz had aroused.</p>

<p>"But how came you to fail? How?"</p>

<p>A shadow crossed the Baron's face. "I have already told you. The
plan was betrayed by one of those&mdash;I know not which&mdash;in
whom I was compelled to trust."</p>

<p>"That was inevitable with so many in the secret," rasped
d'Entragues. "It should have been foreseen."</p>

<p>"It was foreseen. I am not quite a fool, Monsieur d'Entragues.
But to foresee is not always to be able to forestall, A man caught
in a burning house will foresee that if he jumps from a window he
may break his neck. But that should not prevent him from jumping
since, if he remains, he will be burned alive. I perceived the
risk, and I did what was humanly possible to guard against it. I
had no choice but to accept it. There was no other way."</p>

<p>"What happened, then?" his highness demanded. "You have not told
us that."</p>

<p>"The details?" De Batz shrugged again. "Oh, if they interest
you, monseigneur..." And he resumed: "I repeat that Paris as a body
did not desire the death of the King; that the Parisians were
appalled, awe-stricken in the face of a deed which savoured of
sacrilege, and from which they instinctively feared terrible
consequences to themselves. As I have said, no man who saw the
crowd in the streets on that January morning could have a doubt on
this. And the Convention was aware of it, the Committees of the
Sections were aware of it. From the Temple to the Place de la
Revolution, a double file of soldiers held the route in which all
traffic was that day forbidden.</p>

<p>"The King had for escort not merely a mounted regiment of
National Gendarmerie and a regiment of grenadiers of the National
Guard, but a battery of cannon that rolled thundering through the
streets immediately ahead of the royal carriage. This was densely
surrounded by guards. Its closed windows were smeared with lather,
so that not so much as a glimpse of the royal countenance should
act as an incitement to the spirit which the authorities knew to be
abroad. The tramp of marching feet, the rumble and rattle of the
gun-carriages and the rolling of the drums were the only sounds. A
silence such as that in which those thousands stood to see his
Majesty pass to execution must have been witnessed to be credited,
must have been experienced to realize its impressiveness, its
unnatural, uncanny solemnity.</p>

<p>"I dwell on this, monseigneur, to show you how far I was from
any miscalculation of the public spirit upon which I was depending.
The authorities were aware that their own existence was at stake
that day." He raised his voice with sudden vehemence. "I do not
hesitate to assert that their gamble in sending the King to
execution was infinitely more desperate than mine in conceiving the
attempt to rescue him."</p>

<p>He flung down that sentence like a gauntlet, and paused a moment
to see if any would take it up, his eyes challenging in particular
Monsieur d'Entragues. Then returning to his earlier, rather wistful
tone, he resumed his narrative.</p>

<p>"Before seven o'clock that morning I was at the point I had
chosen for the attempt, at the corner of the Rue de la Lune. I
climbed to the top of the bastion and waited. Time passed. The
crowd behind the military files increased in density and stood
silent in the chill of awe which went deeper than the chill of that
misty winter's morning. I scanned the throng for my five hundred,
in ever increasing anxiety. I could discover none of them. At last,
when already in the distance we could make out the approaching roll
of the drums, I was joined on my eminence by two of my followers,
the Marquis de la Guiche and Devaux. They shared my despair when I
was unable to explain the absence of the others.</p>

<p>"Afterwards, when all was over, I discovered that in the night
the Committee of Surveillance, furnished, no doubt by our betrayer,
with a list of the names and addresses of my five hundred, had
taken its measures.</p>

<p>"Two gendarmes had waited upon each of my royalists They were
placed under temporary arrest in their own lodgings, until noon,
until it should be too late for any attempt to thwart the
intentions of the Convention. No further measures were taken
against them. Five hundred men are not to be indicted upon the word
of a single traitor, and there was no evidence against them
otherwise. We had been too cautious. Also perhaps the moment was
not one for proceedings against men who had sought to avert a deed
by which the nation was temporarily appalled.</p>

<p>"That is all my tale. When the royal carriage was abreast of me,
I lost my head. It does not often happen, Gascon though I may be. I
leapt down from the bastion, Devaux and La Guiche followed me. I
attempted to break through the crowd. I waved my hat. I raised a
shout. Even then I hoped against hope that we three could
accomplish the task alone and give a lead that would be followed. I
raised a cry of 'Save the King!' Perhaps the thunder of the drums
drowned my feeble voice for all except those immediately about me.
These shrank from me in dread. Yet it is significant, monseigneur,
it shows yet again how well-judged were the assumptions upon which
I acted, that no attempt was made to seize me. I departed
unhindered with the only two of my band who like myself had not
spent the night at their usual lodging.</p>

<p>"That, monseigneur, is the full account of the failure of that
Gasconnade of mine. As for the moneys that I have spent."</p>

<p>"Leave that," the Regent peevishly interrupted him. "Leave
that." He sat there, his heavy body sagging limply, his double chin
sunk to his breast, vacant-eyed, lost in thought. The narrative had
shamed him for his cavalier reception of the intrepid Baron, and it
had shamed those others with him. Even d'Entragues, that hostile
critic, stood silent and abashed.</p>

<p>But in vain persons, shame is an emotion commonly with reactions
of resentment against those who have provoked it. Presently, while
de Batz waited, his highness rallied. He sat up, threw back his
head, wrapped himself in a mantle of dignity, and delivered himself
with pompous formality.</p>

<p>"We are grateful to you, Monsieur de Batz, for these
explanations, no less than for your activities, which we regret
with you should not have been attended by the success they appear
to have deserved. At the moment that would seem to be all,
unless..." He looked questioningly from d'Avaray to
d'Entragues.</p>

<p>Answering that glance, Monsieur d'Avaray silently shook his
head, made a faint gesture of protest with one of his delicate,
almost translucent hands. D'Entragues bowed stiffly.</p>

<p>"I have no comment, Monseigneur, for Monsieur de Batz."</p>

<p>The Baron looked at them with frank incredulity. They had no
comments!</p>

<p>"I realize, of course," he said, and so level was his tone that
they could only suspect his irony, "that what I have done deserves
no commendation. Judgment must always be upon results." And then,
in a vindictive desire to heap coals of fire upon their
heads&mdash;heads which he began to account ignoble and
contemptible&mdash;he went on smoothly: "But my task in the service
of the monarchy is far from ended. My little army of loyal men is
still on foot. I should not have quitted France but that I
accounted it my duty to make a full report to your highness in
person. Having made it, I crave your highness's leave to return,
and such commands as you may have for me."</p>

<p>"You propose to return? To Paris?"</p>

<p>"I have said, monseigneur, that I would not have left but for
the duty to report to you."</p>

<p>"And what do you hope to do there now?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;unless I have entirely forfeited your
confidence&mdash;your highness will instruct me in your
wishes."</p>

<p>The Regent was at fault. He turned to d'Entragues for
assistance. D'Entragues was equally destitute of ideas, and said so
in many words.</p>

<p>"We will consider, Monsieur de Batz," the Regent informed him.
"We will consider, and inform you. We need not detain you longer at
the moment."</p>

<p>With condescension, as if to temper the chill of that dismissal,
Monsieur held out his plump white hand. The Baron took it, bowed
very low over it, and bore it to lips that were faintly twisted in
a smile.</p>

<p>Then he straightened himself, turned sharply on his red heels
and, ignoring the others, marched stiffly out of that
cedar-panelled, low-ceilinged, uncarpeted audience-chamber.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII - THE VULNERABLE POINT</h2>

<p>On the steps of the Bear Inn next morning the Baron de Batz came
face to face with Monsieur Moreau. He halted in surprise. "Ah!"
said he. "It is our friend the Paladin."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Andr&eacute;-Louis. "It is our Gascon gentleman who
is in love with peril."</p>

<p>The Baron laughed on that, and proffered his hand.</p>

<p>"Faith! Not always. I have been through the worst peril that can
beset a man: the peril of losing his temper. Does it ever happen to
you?"</p>

<p>"Never. I have no illusions."</p>

<p>"You do not believe in fairies, or even in the gratitude of
princes?"</p>

<p>"It is possible to believe in fairies," was the gloomy answer.
Andr&eacute;-Louis was plunged in gloom. It appeared that his
journey from Dresden had been in vain. The Regent's opposition to
Monsieur de Kercadiou's departure had put an end to indecision. The
Regent's assurance, that their return to France was imminent,
encouraged Monsieur de Kercadiou to insist that the marriage must
wait until they should be back at Gavrillac. Against this,
Andr&eacute;-Louis had argued in vain. His godfather accounted
himself pledged and would not listen.</p>

<p>Yet because Aline was now on the side of Andr&eacute;-Louis, her
uncle consented to compromise.</p>

<p>"If," he had said, "within a year the path of our return does
not lie clearly open, I will submit to whatever you may decide." To
hearten them he added, "You will see that you will not have to wait
the half of that time."</p>

<p>But Andr&eacute;-Louis was not heartened. "Do not deceive
yourself, monsieur. In a year from now the only difference will be
that we shall be a year older, and sadder by the further extinction
of hope."</p>

<p>Because of this, his present meeting with de Batz was to prove
critical and bear unexpected fruit.</p>

<p>They moved into the common-room together and sat down to a
flagon of the famous Rupertsberger, with a dried sausage to prepare
the palate for its benign flavour. Over this the Baron told again,
and with greater wealth of detail, the story of his Parisian
adventure.</p>

<p>"It was a miracle that you escaped," was Andr&eacute;-Louis'
final comment, after he had expressed his wonder at so much cool
heroism.</p>

<p>De Batz shrugged. "Faith, no miracle at all. All that a man
needs is common sense, common prudence and a little courage. You
others here abroad judge by the reports that reach you of violence
and outrage; and since you hear nothing else you conceive that
violence and outrage have become the sole occupation of the
Parisians. Thus the man who reads history imagines that the past
was nothing but a succession of battles, since the infinitely
greater periods of peace and order call for no particular comment.
You hear of an aristocrat hunted through the streets, and hanged on
a lantern at the end of the chase, or of a dozen others carted to
the Place de la Revolution and guillotined, and you conceive that
every aristocrat who shows himself in public is either lanterned or
beheaded. I have actually heard it so asserted. But it is nonsense.
There must be in Paris to-day some forty or fifty thousand
royalists of one kind and another, moving freely: a fifth of the
total population. Another fifth of it, if not more, is of no
particular political colour but ready to submit to whatever
government is up.</p>

<p>"Naturally these people do not commit extravagances to attract
resentful attention. They do not wave their hats and shout 'Live
the King!' at every street corner. They go quietly about their
business; for the ordinary business of life goes on, and ordinary,
quiet citizens suffer little interference. It is true that there is
unrest and general uneasiness, punctuated by violent explosions of
popular temper accompanied by violence and bloodshed. But side by
side with it the normal life of a great city flows along. Men buy
and sell, amuse themselves, marry, get children, and die in their
beds, all in the normal manner. If many churches are closed and
only constitutional priests are suffered to minister, yet all the
theatres flourish and no one concerns himself with the politics of
the actors.</p>

<p>"If things were otherwise, if they even approached the
conception of them that is held abroad, the revolution would soon
come to an end, for it would consume itself. A few days of such
utter chaos as is generally pictured, and the means of sustaining
life would no longer circulate; the inhabitants of Paris would
perish of starvation."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis nodded. "You make it clear. There must be a
great deal of misconception."</p>

<p>"And a great deal that is deliberately
manufactured&mdash;counter-revolutionary rumours to stir up public
feeling abroad. The factory is over there in that wooden chalet,
where Monsieur keeps his court and his chancellery. It is
diligently circulated by the Regent's agents, who are scattered
over Europe, and marshalled by the ingenious Monsieur d'Entragues,
the muck-rake in chief."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis stared at him. "You express yourself like a
republican."</p>

<p>"Do not be deceived by it. Look to my actions. It is merely that
I permit myself the luxury of despising Monsieur le Comte
d'Entragues and his methods. I do not like the man, and he does me
the honour not to like me. A mean, jealous creature, with
inordinate ambitions. He aims at being the first man in the State
when the monarchy is restored, and he is fearful and resentful of
any man who might gain influence with the Regent. The man whom he
most hates and fears is d'Avaray, and unless the favourite looks
well to himself, d'Entragues will ruin him yet with Monsieur. For
he burrows craftily underground, leaving little trace upon the
surface. He is subtle and insinuating as a serpent."</p>

<p>"To come back," said Andr&eacute;-Louis, who cared nothing about
Monsieur d'Entragues. "It still remains a miracle that you should
have gone about such a task as yours in Paris and maintained the
air of pursuing what you call the ordinary business of life."</p>

<p>"I was prudent; of course. I did not often trip.&lt;"/p&gt;</p>

<p>"Not often! But to have tripped once should have broken your
neck."</p>

<p>De Batz smiled. "I carried a life-preserver. Monsieur furnished
me before I set out with a thousand <i>louis</i> towards the
expenses of my campaign. I was able to add to it four times as
much, and I could have added as much more as was necessary. You see
that I was well supplied with money."</p>

<p>"But how could money have availed you in such extremities?"</p>

<p>"I know of no extremity in which money will not avail a man. For
a weapon of defence as of offence, steel cannot begin to compare
with gold. With gold I choked the mouths of those who would have
denounced me. With gold I annihilated the sense of duty of those
who should have hindered me." He laughed into Andr&eacute;-Louis'
round eyes. "Aura sacra fames! The greed of it is common to
mankind; but never have I found that greed so fierce as among
Messieurs the sansculottes. That greed, I believe, is at the root
of their revolutionary fervour. I surprise you it seems."</p>

<p>"A little, I confess."</p>

<p>"Ah!" The Baron held his glass to the light, and considered the
faint opalescence which the wintry sunshine brought into the golden
liquid. "Have you ever considered equality, its mainsprings and
true significance?"</p>

<p>"Never. Because it is chimerical. It does not exist. Men are not
born equally equipped. They are born noble or ignoble, sane or
foolish, strong or weak, according to the blend of natures,
fortuitous to them, which calls them into existence."</p>

<p>The Baron drank, and set down his glass. He dabbed his lips with
a fine handkerchief.</p>

<p>"That is merely metaphysical, and I am being practical. It is
possible to postulate a condition of equality. It has, in fact,
been postulated by the apostles of that other singular delusion,
liberty. The idea of equality is a by-product of the sentiment of
envy. Since it must always prove beyond human power to raise the
inferior mass to a superior stratum, apostles of equality must ever
be inferiors seeking to reduce their betters to their own level. It
follows that a nation that once admits this doctrine of equality
will be dragged by it to the level, moral, intellectual and
political, of its most worthless class. This within practical
limitations. Because, after all, such qualities as nobility,
intelligence, learning, virtue and strength cannot be stripped from
those who possess them, to be cast into a commonwealth and shared
by all. The only things of which men can be deprived in that way
and to that end are their material possessions.</p>

<p>"Your revolutionaries, these dishonest rogues who delude the
ignorant masses with the cant of liberty, equality and fraternity
and with promises of a millennium which they know can never be
achieved, are well aware of this. They know that there is no power
that can lift from the gutter those who have inherited it. The only
attainable equality is one which will reduce the remainder of the
nation to that gutter, so as to make things still more
uncomfortable for the deluded unfortunates who writhe there. But
meanwhile, plying their cant, deceiving the masses with their false
promises, these men prosper in themselves. That is all their aim:
the ease they envied in those they have pulled down, the wealth
they coveted which procures this ease. These things they ensure for
themselves in unstinted measure."</p>

<p>"But is that possible in the France of to-day? Are the men who
made the revolution really deriving material profit from it?"</p>

<p>"What is there in this to astonish you? Is not the Assembly
recruited from the gutter, from famished failures in the law, like
Desmoulins and Danton, from starveling journalists like Marat and
H&eacute;bert, and unfrocked capuchins like Chabot. Shall these men
who are now in the saddle suddenly repress the envy which inspired
them or stifle the covetousness which went hand in hand with that
envy? They are all dishonest and corrupt, and if this applies to
those in command, shall it apply less to the underlings?" He
laughed. "I doubt if there is a man in the whole National
Convention whom I could not buy."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis was very thoughtful. "I understand a great
deal that hitherto had not occurred to me," he said slowly. "When
this movement first began, when I played my part in it, it was a
movement of idealists who sought to correct abuses, to bring to men
an equality of opportunity and an equality before the law which in
the past had been denied them."</p>

<p>"Nearly all those visionaries have been swept away by the tide
from the gutter to which they opened the floodgates. A handful
remains perhaps. The men of the Gironde, lawyers all, and men of
ability who make a great parade of republican virtue. But even they
have shown themselves dishonest. They voted for the death of the
King, against their principles, and merely so as to ensure that
they might cling to power. Oh, believe me, I wrought no miracle in
preserving myself in Paris, and it will require no miracle to
safeguard me there again."</p>

<p>"You are returning?"</p>

<p>"Of course. Shall I grow rusty in exile while there's work to be
done at home? I may have failed to save the King, thanks to that
blundering, jealous fool d'Entragues, who kept me wasting time in
Coblentz when I should have been in Paris; but I shall hope to
succeed better with the Queen."</p>

<p>"You mean to attempt her rescue?"</p>

<p>"I do not think it offers difficulties that gold and steel will
not overcome."</p>

<p>The wine was finished. Andr&eacute;-Louis stood up. His dark
eyes considered the resolute, carelessly smiling countenance of the
Baron.</p>

<p>"Monsieur de Batz," he said, "minimize it as you will, I think
you are the bravest man I have ever known."</p>

<p>"You honour me, Monsieur Moreau. Have you the ear of the
Regent?"</p>

<p>"I! Indeed, no."</p>

<p>"A pity! You might persuade him of the virtue you discern in me.
He has no great opinion of me at present. But I shall hope to
improve it. I owe it to myself."</p>

<p>They talked no more that day, but they met again as if by mutual
attraction on the morrow. And then it was Andr&eacute;-Louis who
talked, and the Baron who listened.</p>

<p>"I have been pondering what you told me yesterday, Monsieur de
Batz. If you accurately represent the situation, this revolutionary
stronghold is vulnerable, it seems to me, at several points. My
interest springs from my own aims. That is common enough if not
commonly admitted. I am frank, Monsieur le Baron. All my hopes in
life have become bound up with the restoration of the monarchy, and
I see no ground to expect that the restoration of the Bourbons will
ever be brought about as a result of European intervention. If the
monarchy is to be restored in France, the restoration must come as
a result of a movement from the inside. Almost I perceive&mdash;or
seem to perceive&mdash;from what you told me yesterday how this
movement might be given an impetus."</p>

<p>"How?" The Baron was alert.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis did not immediately answer. He sat in
silence, considering, as if passing his ideas in review before
giving them utterance. Then he looked round and up at the railed
galleries above the common-room. They were quite alone. It was
still too early in the day for the inhabitants of Hamm to come
there to their beer and cards and dice and backgammon.</p>

<p>He leaned across the narrow yellow table, directly facing the
Baron, and there was a glitter in his dark eyes, a faint stir of
blood on his prominent cheek-bones.</p>

<p>"You'll say this is a madman's dream."</p>

<p>"I've dreamt a good many of them myself. Take heart."</p>

<p>"Two things that you said yesterday have remained with me to be
the seed of thought. One was your exposition of the general
dishonesty, the corruptibility of those in power to-day in France.
The other was your assertion that if the chaos existed there which
abroad it is believed exists, the revolution would burn itself out
in a few days."</p>

<p>"Do you doubt either statement?"</p>

<p>"No, Monsieur le Baron. I perceive that power in France has been
tossed like a ball from hand to hand until it is now grasped by the
lowest men in the nation who can pretend to any governing ability.
It can be tossed no farther; that is to say no farther down."</p>

<p>"There are still the Girondins," said de Batz slowly. "They
hardly fit your description."</p>

<p>"But it follows, from what else you said, that they will be
swept away by the natural processes of the revolution."</p>

<p>"Yes. That seems inevitable."</p>

<p>"The men of the National Convention maintain themselves by the
confidence of the populace. The populace trusts them implicitly,
believes in their stark honesty. Other governments have been pulled
down because the men who formed them were exposed for corrupt
self-seekers, plundering the nation to their own personal profit.
This corruption the populace believes to be responsible for the
squalor of its own lot. Now all is changed. The people believe that
those rogues have been cast out, driven from France, guillotined,
destroyed; they believe that their places have been filled by these
honest, incorruptible men who would open their veins to give drink
to the thirsty people rather than misappropriate a part of the
national treasury."</p>

<p>"A nice phrase," said the Baron. "Pitched in the right key for
the mob."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis let the interruption pass. "If it could be
revealed to the people that these last hopes of theirs are more
corrupt than any that have gone before; if the people could be
persuaded that by cant, hypocrisy and lies these revolutionaries
have imposed themselves upon the nation merely so that they may
fatten upon it, what would happen?"</p>

<p>"If that could be proved, it would of course destroy them. But
how to prove it?"</p>

<p>"All things that are true are susceptible of proof."</p>

<p>"As a general rule, no doubt. But these fellows are too secure
to be assailed in that fashion."</p>

<p>Again Andr&eacute;-Louis was sententious. "No man is secure who
is dishonest in a position held upon faith in his honesty.
Monsieur, as you have said, sits there in his wooden chalet
composing reports for consumption in the courts of Europe. Would
not his ends be better served by reports for consumption by the
populace of France? Is it so difficult to arouse suspicion of men
in power even when they are believed to be honest?"</p>

<p>The Baron was stirred. "Name of a name of a name! But now you
utter a truth, mon petit. The reputation of a man in power is as
delicate as a woman's."</p>

<p>"You see. Let scandal loose against these knaves. Support it by
evidence of their dishonesties. Then one of two things must follow:
either a reaction in favour of the return of the old governing
classes or else chaos, utter anarchy and the complete collapse of
all the machinery of State, with the inevitable result of famine
and exhaustion. Thus the revolution burns itself out."</p>

<p>"My God!" said de Batz in a voice of awe. He took his head in
his hands, and sat brooding there, his eyes veiled. At last he
flashed them upon the eager face of the man opposite. "A madman's
dream, as you say and yet a dream that might be possible of
fulfilment. The conception of a Daemon."</p>

<p>"I make you a gift of it."</p>

<p>But the Baron shook his head. "It would need the mind that
conceived it to oversee its execution, to elaborate its details.
The task is one for you, Monsieur Moreau."</p>

<p>"Say rather for Scaramouche. It asks his peculiar gifts."</p>

<p>"Regard that as you please. Consider the results to yourself if
achievement were to crown the effort, as well it may if boldly
made. Yours will be the position of a kingmaker."</p>

<p>"Scaramouche the Kingmaker!"</p>

<p>De Batz disregarded the sneer. "And yours the great rewards that
await a kingmaker."</p>

<p>"You believe, then, in the gratitude of princes after all."</p>

<p>"I believe in a kingmaker's ability to enforce payment of his
wages."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louts fell into a daydream. It would be a sweet
satisfaction to have these men who had treated him so cavalierly
owe their restoration to his genius and lie in his debt for it;
sweet too, to prevail by his own effort, and rise by it to the
eminence which he accounted his natural place in a world of
numskulls, an eminence which he need have no hesitation in inviting
Aline to share.</p>

<p>The Baron aroused him to realities. 'Well?'' His voice rasped
with an eagerness that amounted to anxiety.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis smiled at him across the table "I will take
the risk of it, I think."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII - DEPARTURE</h2>

<p>Monsieur de Batz stood once more in the presence of the Regent,
in that plain room in the chalet at Hamm.</p>

<p>He stood before Monsieur's writing-table, in a rhomb of sunlight
that fell from the leaded panes of the window on Monsieur's left.
Windows and door were tight shut and the stale atmosphere of the
room was heavy with the earthy smell of burning peat from the clay
stove. From the eaves outside came a steady drip of melting snow,
for the thaw had set in that morning.</p>

<p>Three other men were in attendance. The delicate Comte d'Avaray,
his English air accentuated by plain blue riding-coat, buckskins
and knee boots with reversed tops, was seated near the middle of
the room, on the Baron's left. 'With him sat the dark, showy,
slimly vigorous Comte d'Entragues. The Regent's brother, the Comte
d'Artois, slight, elegant and restless, paced to and fro across the
room. He had been invited to attend so soon as the trend of the
Baron's proposal was apparent.</p>

<p>The Baron had been speaking, and now that he had ceased silence
was maintained until the Regent, who had thoughtfully sat biting
the end of his quill, invited the opinion of Monsieur d'Entragues
on what they had just heard. D'Entragues was at no pains to
dissemble his contempt.</p>

<p>"A wild enterprise. Utterly desperate. A gambler's throw."</p>

<p>Monsieur d'Artois halted in his pacing. He could assume airs of
an intelligence which he did not possess. He assumed them now,
preserving a wise silence.</p>

<p>The Regent levelled the glance of his full eyes upon de Batz.
"Agreed," said the Baron easily "Oh, agreed. But, for desperate
ills, desperate remedies."</p>

<p>Solemnly Monsieur d'Artois corrected him. "It cannot rightly be
said that this ill is desperate. It is very far from
desperate."</p>

<p>"I allude, monseigneur, to the situation of the royal prisoners.
That, I think it will be agreed, is desperate enough, and time will
not stand still for them. There is not a day to be lost if her
majesty is to be rescued from the terrible fate which has already
overtaken the late King. Monsieur d'Entragues describes this as a
gambler's throw. It is admitted. But what alternative does Monsieur
d'Entragues propose if the Queen and her family are not to be
abandoned to their fate?"</p>

<p>D'Entragues shrugged impatiently and crossed his legs again. "I
think you should answer that," said Monsieur d'Artois in his cold
level voice.</p>

<p>D'Entragues complied, perforce. "So far as an attempt to rescue
her majesty is concerned, my views are no reason why it should not
be made. It is even heroic of Monsieur de Batz to stake, as he will
be doing, his head upon the gamble. But when it comes to the other,
wider issues with which Monsieur de Batz wishes to concern himself,
I must frankly say that it is disconcerting to the agents already
acting under my directions to have this independent meddling."</p>

<p>"So that," said Monsieur ponderously, "you would advise that
whilst we sanction the Baron's enterprise on behalf of the Queen,
we do not authorize him to take any action having a wider
scope?"</p>

<p>"That is what I have the honour to advise, monseigneur."</p>

<p>And this might finally have closed the matter but for a gentle
interpolation at that moment by d'Avaray, who, if he seldom
intervened in affairs, never intervened without commanding the
Regent's attention.</p>

<p>"But what," he asked, "if the opportunity for a bold stroke
would present itself? Is it to be neglected?"</p>

<p>D'Entragues suppressed his annoyance at this opposition from the
Regent's favourite, whom he detested, yet whom he dared not openly
flout. He spoke as smoothly as he could.</p>

<p>"If the opportunity presents itself, my agents will be at hand
to take advantage of it. I can assure you, messieurs, that they
have the very fullest instructions from me."</p>

<p>But de Batz was emboldened by the unexpected support of Monsieur
d'Avaray. "Suppose that they do not perceive an opportunity which
presents itself to me, am I still on that account to neglect it? It
is not lucky, monseigneur, to let opportunity go unheeded. If I
attempt and fail, I do not perceive how this can thwart the
measures being taken by Monsieur d'Entragues' agents."</p>

<p>"The measures might be identical," cried d'Entragues, without
waiting for leave to speak. "And a clumsy failure on your part
would create alarm, directing vigilance to the very point where we
least desire it, where it may defeat us."</p>

<p>Thus began an argument which endured for a full hour by the
clock. Monsieur de Batz remained outwardly calm before this crass
opposition, whilst Monsieur d'Entragues, growing heated and at
moments, consequently, reckless in his arguments, laid himself open
to several palpable hits.</p>

<p>The end of it was that their highnesses, grudgingly and with all
the air of bestowing a high favour, condescended to hear Monsieur
de Batz in detail upon the plan which he pretended to have formed
for the overthrow of the revolutionary government. But now Monsieur
de Batz almost wrecked his chances of risking neck in the service
of these ungracious Princes by stating that he would prefer to
unfold his plans with the attendance of one who was largely their
author and who was to be his close associate in their
execution.</p>

<p>Peremptorily he was asked for the name of this person. When he
had supplied it the Princes and their two advisers looked at one
another whilst Monsieur d'Artois expressed the opinion that they
should know something more about this Monsieur Moreau before
investing him with authority to act on their behalf.</p>

<p>Still Monsieur de Batz betrayed no sign of his impatience, which
says much for his self-control. He went out to fetch
Andr&eacute;-Louis, who awaited the summons.</p>

<p>Their highnesses considered the neat trim figure without
enthusiasm. Monsieur d'Artois, indeed, who had not remembered him
by name but recognized him now at sight, frowned upon him in
silence. It was the Regent who addressed him.</p>

<p>"Monsieur de Batz has told us, monsieur, of your willingness to
co-operate with him in certain measures which he believes are
calculated to serve our interests in France. He tells us that you
are partly the author of the plan upon which he proposes to act,
but of which we have yet to learn the details." And with that chill
welcome he turned to Monsieur de Batz. "Now Monsieur le Baron, we
are listening."</p>

<p>The Baron was brisk. "Our plan is not so much to clean out the
Augean stable as to reveal its noisomeness in such a manner to the
people of France as to induce them to rise up and themselves
perform the necessary work of purification." Briefly he sketched
the main principles which would guide their task and some of the
measures by which they proposed so to corrupt those very
corruptible men that their corruption could no longer be
concealed.</p>

<p>Monsieur d'Artois became interested. D'Avaray's delicate face
was flushed with enthusiasm. D'Entragues continued coldly hostile,
whilst Monsieur turned grave eyes from one to another as if seeking
in their countenances the guidance of the reflection of their
thoughts.</p>

<p>Monsieur d'Artois moved across to stand beside his brother's
chair. Monsieur's glance interrogated him.</p>

<p>"The conception is of an engaging audacity," said the younger
prince. "Sometimes audacity succeeds. What more can one say?"</p>

<p>"I perceive," said the Regent, "no reasons against the attempt
being made. Do you, d'Entragues?"</p>

<p>D'Entragues shrugged. "None beyond those which I have already
had the honour to express to your highness. If I were to attach to
Monsieur de Batz a man of my own, who is now under my hand here, I
should have some assurance that there would be no working at
cross-purposes with my own agents in Paris."</p>

<p>Monsieur nodded solemnly. "What says Monsieur de Batz to
that?"</p>

<p>Monsieur de Batz smiled. "I welcome every recruit, always
provided that he possesses the qualities of courage and
intelligence which the work demands."</p>

<p>"I employ no others, monsieur," said d'Entragues with
arrogance.</p>

<p>"Could I permit myself to suppose it, monsieur?"</p>

<p>And then Monsieur d'Artois, who had been frowning, interposed.
"There is yet another quality necessary. I ask myself does Monsieur
Moreau possess it?"</p>

<p>The Regent, who had been pensively smiling, looked up as if
suddenly startled. But his brother ran on, fixing his glance keenly
and coldly upon Andr&eacute;-Louis.</p>

<p>"I call to mind, Monsieur Moreau, a conversation we had at
Sch&ouml;nbornlust, in the course of which you expressed yourself a
constitutionalist. Hitherto it has been my invariable rule to
demand a greater purity of ideals than that in those who follow us.
We do not aim at restoring a monarchy to France if it is to be a
constitutional monarchy. We shall re-establish there a monarchy in
the ancient forms, persuaded as we are that had our unfortunate
brother made no departure from this, the present unhappy state of
things would never have arisen. You will understand, Monsieur
Moreau, that, inspired by such ideals, we must hesitate to enlist
the services of any man who does not fully share them. You smile,
Monsieur Moreau?"</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis asked himself who would not have smiled at
this pompous address from a Prince Lackland to a man who was
proposing to get himself killed in his service. But he made a sharp
recovery of his gravity.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur," he replied, "assuming that we are successful in
this forlorn hope, the extent of our success will be to overthrow
the existing r&eacute;gime and open the way for the restoration.
What form the monarchy will take when restored will hardly rest
with us&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Maybe, maybe," the Prince coldly interrupted him. "But we must
still observe a discrimination, a fastidiousness even, in the
agents we enlist. We owe this to ourselves, to the dignity of our
station."</p>

<p>"I understand," said Andr&eacute;-Louis frosty in his turn, "the
purity of your ideals demands a purity in the weapons you
employ."</p>

<p>"You express it very happily, Monsieur Moreau. I thank you. You
will perceive that we have no other guarantee of the sincerity of
those who act as our agents."</p>

<p>"I venture to think, monseigneur, that I could supply a
guarantee of my own."</p>

<p>Monsieur d'Artois seemed surprised by the answer. "If you
please," he said.</p>

<p>"The best guarantee a man can give of his sincerity is to show
that his interest lies in keeping faith. Now with the restoration
of the monarchy is bound up the restoration of various nobles to
their confiscated domains. Amongst these there is my godfather,
Monsieur de Kercadiou, who will be restored to Gavrillac. He has
imposed it upon me that I must wait until this is accomplished
before I may fulfil my dearest hope, which is to marry Mademoiselle
de Kercadiou. You will perceive, monseigneur, my interest in
advancing the cause of the monarchy so that I may advance my own,
which is my chief concern."</p>

<p>Now that is not the way to address a prince, and no prince was
ever more conscious that he was a prince than Monsieur le Comte
d'Artois.</p>

<p>Cold anger quivered in the restrained voice in which he
answered, "I perceive it clearly, monsieur. It explains to me all
that I considered obscure in the aims of a man of your history and
sentiments, which in themselves are not calculated to inspire
confidence."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis bowed formally. "I am dismissed, I
think."</p>

<p>Coldly Monsieur d'Artois inclined his head in assent. De Batz in
a fury made a clicking sound with his tongue. But before he could
commit himself to any solecism that must have made matters worse,
the Regent, to the surprise of all, had intervened. He was almost
nervous in manner. His florid face seemed to have lost some of its
colour. The podgy hand he extended as he spoke could be seen to
shake.</p>

<p>"Ah, but wait! Wait, Monsieur Moreau! A moment, I beg!"</p>

<p>His brother looked down at him in angry uncomprehending
astonishment. It was unbelievable that it was the Regent of France
who had spoken. Monsieur, usually so cold, correct and formal, so
fully imbued with a sense of the dignity of his office, so
observant of etiquette that even to give audience in this wooden
hut at Hamm he donned the ribbon of the Holy Ghost and hung a dress
sword at his side, appeared completely to have forgotten what was
due to him. Otherwise he could not have addressed in that tone of
almost scared intercession a man who had permitted himself to be
insolent in speech and carriage. To Monsieur d'Artois this was the
end of the world. Not for a throne could he have believed that his
brother would so abase himself.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur!" he exclaimed in a voice that expressed his horror
and dismay.</p>

<p>But all the majesty seemed to have deserted the Regent. He spoke
mildly, conciliatorily. "We must not be ungenerous. We must keep in
view that Monsieur Moreau offers a very gallant service." He seemed
only just to have become aware of it. "It would be ungenerous
either to decline it, or to look too closely
into&mdash;ah&mdash;the general sentiments by which Monsieur Moreau
is&mdash;ah&mdash;inspired."</p>

<p>"You think so?" said Monsieur d'Artois tartly, his brows drawn
together at the root of his Bourbon nose.</p>

<p>"I think so," he was curtly answered, in a tone of finality, a
tone which seemed clearly to imply that it was the speaker who
occupied the throne and whose will was paramount. "Myself, I am
very grateful to Monsieur Moreau for his readiness to serve us by
an undertaking whose perils I do not underestimate. If, as we must
hope, the undertaking is successful, I shall express that gratitude
liberally. The extent of my liberality will be governed only by the
political opinions then held by Monsieur Moreau. He will perceive
how inevitable this is. But until then I do not think that his past
opinions and activities need concern us. I repeat, it would be
ungenerous to permit them to do so."</p>

<p>The amazement had deepened in his audience. This unusual and
sudden degree of graciousness bewildered them, with the possible
exception of the keen-witted alert Monsieur d'Entragues, who
thought that he understood the Regent's anxieties.</p>

<p>Monsieur d'Artois was crimson, his vanity affronted by an
opposition which had been displayed almost in the terms of a
rebuke. He took a haughty tone.</p>

<p>"The repetition is quite unnecessary. I was not likely to forget
that so uncompromising a word as 'ungenerous' had been used. I will
not dwell upon this now. Since our views of this matter are so wide
asunder, I can have no further part in it." And abruptly he turned
upon his heel.</p>

<p>The Regent scowled. "Monseigneur," he cried, "you are not to
forget that I occupy the place of the King."</p>

<p>"Your highness leaves me in no danger of forgetting it," was the
younger prince's bitter rejoinder, disloyal at once to the
representative of royalty and to the dead Sovereign. On that he
went out, slamming the door after him.</p>

<p>The Regent made a clumsy effort to dispel the discomfort left by
that departure.</p>

<p>"My brother, messieurs, takes in these matters an uncompromising
attitude, which we must respect, even if we do not feel called upon
to share it." He sighed. "There is a rigidity in his ideals, which
are very exalted, very noble." He paused, and then changed his
tone. "Little remains, I think, to be said. I have already
expressed, Monsieur de Batz, my appreciation of the endeavours
which you and Monsieur Moreau are about to exert. For anything else
that you require, Monsieur d'Entragues is at your service, and I am
happy that with him, too, an understanding should have been
reached."</p>

<p>"There is one other matter, monseigneur," said de Batz.
"Funds."</p>

<p>His highness was startled. He flung up his hands. "In the name
of Heaven, Monsieur de Batz! Do you ask us for money?"</p>

<p>"No, monseigneur. Merely for authority to provide it." And in
answer to the Regent's stare, he smiled significantly, "In the
usual way, monseigneur."</p>

<p>It was clear that his highness understood. But he was still not
comfortable. He looked at d'Entragues as if for guidance.</p>

<p>D'Entragues thrust out a deprecatory lip. "You know,
monseigneur, the trouble there has been already and the
undertakings you have given."</p>

<p>"But those," ventured Monsieur de Batz, "apply only here abroad,
and not to France."</p>

<p>The Regent nodded and considered. "You give me your word,
Monsieur le Baron, that these assignats will be employed only in
France?"</p>

<p>"Freely, monseigneur. I have still enough gold for our journey
across the Rhine."</p>

<p>"Very well, then. You must do what is necessary. But you realize
the danger?"</p>

<p>De Batz smiled confidently. "As for danger, it is the least of
those we shall confront, and I employ very skilful hands,
monseigneur."</p>

<p>Upon that his highness closed the audience with a few words of
valediction, and graciously proffered his hand to be kissed by
those two adventurers.</p>

<p>Outside in the sunshine, as they squelched their way through the
thawing snow, the Gascon loosed at last his annoyance in a volley
of profanity.</p>

<p>"If it were not that I rate the game above the stakes I should
have told their highnesses in round terms to go to the devil,
together with that infernal pimp d'Entragues. God of my life! To
have to go on one's knees to beg the honour of being permitted to
get one's self killed in their service!"</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis smiled upon his fury. "You do not realize the
honour of dying in their cause. Have patience with them. They are
merely players of parts. And Destiny has given them parts too big
for their puny wits. Fortunately for our self-respect Monsieur
turned gracious at the end."</p>

<p>"Which provides the morning's most surprising event. Hitherto he
has been the more intransigent, the more self-sufficient of the
twain."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis brushed the mystery aside. "Ah, well! I am
content that my dismissal was not confirmed. I have my own
interests to serve in the adventure. For I am Scaramouche,
remember. Not a knight-errant."</p>

<p>But it was as a knight-errant that Monsieur de Kercadiou and
Aline regarded him when they heard to what desperate adventure he
was pledged. Aline perceived only the dangers, and that evening
after supper, when for a little while she was alone with
Andr&eacute;-Louis, she gave expression to her fears for him.</p>

<p>He glowed at this fresh proof of her tenderness even whilst
distressed by her distress. He set himself to tranquilize her. He
dwelt upon the immunity which circumspection ensured, freely
quoting de Batz on the subject. But the mention of the Baron's name
was an incitement to her.</p>

<p>"That man!" she cried, a world of condemnation in her voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, but a very gallant gentleman," Andr&eacute;-Louis defended
him.</p>

<p>"A reckless harebrain, dangerous to all who are associated with
him. He makes me afraid, Andr&eacute;. He will not be lucky to you.
I feel it. I know it."</p>

<p>"Intuitions?" he said tolerantly, smiling down upon her where
she stood against him, her face upturned to his.</p>

<p>"Ah, do not sneer, Andr&eacute;," Agitation had brought her, who
rarely wept, to the verge of tears. "If you love me, Andr&eacute;,
you will not go."</p>

<p>"I go because I love you. I go so that at last I may win you for
my wife. Honours there will be, no doubt, and material gains to
crown success. But these stand for nothing in my calculations. It
is you I go to win."</p>

<p>"Where is the need, since I am won already? For the rest, we
could wait."</p>

<p>It was anguish to deny the intercession in those dear eyes. He
could but remind her that his word was pledged, doubly pledged: to
the Regent as well as to de Batz. He urged her to be brave and to
have in him some of the confidence which he had in himself.</p>

<p>She promised at last that she would try, and then to her promise
added: "Yet if you go, my Andr&eacute;, I know that I shall never
see you again. I have a premonition of evil."</p>

<p>"Dear child! That is but a fancy born of your distress."</p>

<p>"It is not. I need you. I need you near me. To guard me."</p>

<p>"To guard you? But from what?"</p>

<p>"I do not know. There is some danger. I sense it about
me&mdash;about us if we are apart. It is instinctive."</p>

<p>"And yet, dear love, you had no such instinct when I proposed to
go to Dresden."</p>

<p>"Ah, but Dresden is near at hand. At need a message could bring
you to me, or I could go to you. But once you are in France you are
as one trapped in a cage, cut off from the remainder of the world.
Andr&eacute;! Andr&eacute;! Is it, indeed, too late?"</p>

<p>"Too late for what?" said Monsieur de Kercadiou, who entered at
that moment.</p>

<p>She told him bluntly. He was shocked, outraged. Had she so
little loyalty, so little sense of every loyal man's duty in this
dreadful time that she should weaken Andr&eacute;'s heroic resolve
by a maudlin opposition? For once Monsieur de Kercadiou was really
angry, and he stormed upon her as he had never yet stormed in all
the years that she had been under his tutelage.</p>

<p>Limp, shamed, defeated, she withdrew; and next morning
Andr&eacute;-Louis rode out of Hamm to take the road to France.</p>

<p>With him rode Monsieur de Batz and a Monsieur Armand de
Lang&eacute;ac, a young gentleman of a Langu&eacute;doc family
attached to them by Monsieur d'Entragues.</p>

<p>They were disposed to be light-hearted. But in the ears of
Andr&eacute;-Louis rang ever Aline's cry: "If you go, my
Andr&eacute;, I know that I shall never see you again."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV - MOLOCH</h2>

<p>Moloch stood before the Palace of the Tuileries in the brilliant
sunshine of a June morning, and raised his hideous voice in a cry
for blood. The sprawling incarnation of him, that filled to
overflowing the Place du Carrousel, was made up of some eighty
thousand men under arms&mdash;to sectionary National Guards,
battalions of the new army about to set out for the Vend&eacute;e,
and ragged patriots brandishing musket, pike or sabre, the
bloodthirsty scourings of the streets. It was just such a mob as
Andr&eacute;-Louis had seen in this very place on the memorable and
terrible tenth of August of the previous year.</p>

<p>On that occasion they had come to storm a palace housing a king,
so that they might impose upon him their mutinous will, shaped and
directed by the incendiaries who employed them as a weapon. To-day,
once more in an insurrection that had been craftily engineered,
they came in their thousands to storm this same palace which now
housed the National Convention elected by the people themselves to
replace the departed monarch.</p>

<p>Then it had been Danton, the great tribune, massive and
overwhelming in body, brain and voice, the cyclops of Madame
Roland's detestation, who had inspired and led the populace. To-day
its leader was a poor creature of weakly frame, shabbily dressed,
his head swathed like a buccaneer's in a red kerchief, from which
black greasy rags of hair hung about a livid Semitic countenance.
He laboured in his walk, setting his feet wide. He was the Citizen
Jean-Paul Marat, the President of the powerful Jacobin Club,
surgeon, philanthropist and reformer, commonly styled the People's
Friend, from the title of the scurrilous journal with which he
poisoned the popular mind. And Danton was amongst those against
whom to-day he led this mob, which ten months ago Danton had led in
this same place.</p>

<p>The situation was not without a terrible humour; and Monsieur de
Batz, standing prominently on a horse-block by the courtyard wall
with Andr&eacute;-Louis beside him, smiled grimly as he looked on,
well-pleased with the climax for which these two had striven and
intrigued.</p>

<p>This is not to say that the ruin of the Girondin party, which
was now as good as encompassed&mdash;the only alternative being the
ruin of the entire Convention&mdash;was the work of de Batz and
Andr&eacute;-Louis. But it is beyond doubt that their part in it
had been important. Without the grains of sand which they had flung
at moments into the scales when these were too nicely balanced
between victory and defeat, it is not impossible that the
Girondins, who combined intelligence with courage, would have
overthrown their opponents and established, by the rule of
moderation for which they stood, the law and order necessary to
save the State. But from the moment when they first rendered
themselves vulnerable by procuring the arrest of the rabble's idol
Marat, de Batz, with the assistance of Andr&eacute;-Louis, had
worked diligently through his agents to fan the resentment into a
fury in the face of which no jury dared to convict the offending
journalist.</p>

<p>Marat's acquittal had been a triumph. Laurel-crowned the mob had
borne him to the Convention, so that there he might vent his spite
against the men who, inspired by decency, had sought his ruin.</p>

<p>After this had come the laudable attempt of the Girondins to
curb the insolence of the Commune of Paris, which by imposing its
will upon the elected representatives of the people of France made
a mock of government. They compelled the establishment of the
Commission of Twelve, to examine the conduct of the municipality
and control it.</p>

<p>The situation became strained. The party of the Mountain, with
Robespierre at its head, feared lest the Girondins should recapture
in the Convention the domination which they had held in the
Legislative Assembly. Certainly the available talent lay with this
band of lawyers and intellectuals, led by the formidable eloquent
Vergniaud, that shining light of the Bordeaux bar, whom someone has
called the Cicero from Aquitaine. In debate Robespierre could
produce on his side no champions to hold the lists against these.
In a man of Robespierre's temperament this was cause enough for
rancour, without the additional rancour he bore the Girondins for
having excluded him from office when theirs was the power. But for
outside influence these men of the Gironde must have prevailed.
Outside influence, however, was at work, and none more active in it
than de Batz, at once directed and seconded by Andr&eacute;-Louis.
It was Andr&eacute;-Louis who, employing his gifts of authorship,
composed those pamphlets printed in the presses of the Ami du
Peuple and widely circulated, in which the Girondins were charged
with counterrevolutionary conspiracy. Their moderation was
represented as a betrayal of their trust; the Commission of Twelve
set up by their influence was shown to be an attempt to hobble the
Commune, whose sole aim was to destroy despotism. Subtly was it
suggested that the royalist victories in the Vend&eacute;e, the
reactionary insurrections at Marseilles and Bordeaux and the defeat
of the Republican Army in Belgium, ending in General Dumouriez's
defection and flight, were the results of Girondist moderation and
weakness at a time when National necessity called for the
strongest, sternest measures.</p>

<p>Such had been the poison sedulously pumped into Parisian veins,
and here at last was the result in this rising of the inflamed
Parisian body: eighty thousand men and sixty guns, commanded by the
ridiculous General Henriot, who sat his horse with obvious
discomfort, to back Marat's demand that the traitors&mdash;and he
was prepared to name twenty-two of them&mdash;should be given
up.</p>

<p>There was a sudden movement in the crowd, and cries of: "They
come!"</p>

<p>A group of men had made its appearance at the door of the
Palace. It advanced, others crowding after it, to the number of
perhaps two hundred, a considerable proportion of the whole body of
representatives. At the head of these men walked that tall graceful
libertine, H&eacute;rault de S&eacute;chelles, President of the
Convention at this time. He wore his plumed hat, as was usual in
the chamber when proceedings were out of order.</p>

<p>Henriot thrust his horse forward a few paces. S&eacute;chelles
halted, and held up his hand for silence. He carried a paper, and
he raised his resonant voice to read it. It was a decree just
passed by the staggered body of legislators, commanding the instant
withdrawal of this armed insurrectionary force. But as Robespierre
had said (or was it Chabot?): "There is no virtue where there is no
fear." And the Government was without the means to arouse the fear
that inculcates virtue.</p>

<p>"I charge you to obey!" cried S&eacute;chelles, lowering his
paper and delivering himself resolutely.</p>

<p>"You have my orders, H&eacute;rault," he was truculently
answered by the mounted General.</p>

<p>"Your orders!" S&eacute;chelles paused. There was a murmur of
indignation behind him in the ranks of the representatives. "What
does the people want? The Convention has no thought or concern save
for the public welfare."</p>

<p>"What it wants, H&eacute;rault? You well know what it wants."
The General's tone was conciliatory. "We know that you are a good
patriot, H&eacute;rault, that you belong to the Mountain. Will you
answer for it upon your head that the twenty-two traitors in the
Convention will be delivered up within twenty-four hours?"</p>

<p>The president stood firm. "It is not," he began, "for the people
to dictate thus to the august body of..."</p>

<p>His voice was drowned in a roar, sudden as a thunder-clap, and
then, like thunder, protracted in a long roll of furious sound that
waxed and waned. Above the sea of heads, arms were thrust up
brandishing weapons.</p>

<p>H&eacute;rault de S&eacute;chelles stood firm. Behind him his
agitated fellow-representatives looked on, conceiving that they
were to fare even as in this very place those had fared against
whom ten months ago they had loosed the fury of this same
populace.</p>

<p>But Henriot, more uncomfortable than ever on a charger made
restive by the din, yet contrived to pacify and silence Moloch.</p>

<p>"The sovereign people," he said, "is not here to listen to
phrases but to issue its sovereign commands."</p>

<p>S&eacute;chelles played his last card. He advanced a step,
drawing himself up, and flinging out an arm in a superb gesture of
authority. His voice rang like a trumpet-call.</p>

<p>"Soldiers! In the name of the Nation and the law, I order you to
arrest this rebel."</p>

<p>Moloch curbed his derision and held his breath to hear the
answer.</p>

<p>Henriot drew his sabre.</p>

<p>"We take no orders from you. Return to your place, and deliver
up the deputies demanded by the people." In the bright sunshine the
flourish of his blade made a lightning-flash above his head.
"Cannoneers, to your posts!"</p>

<p>There was an obeying movement about the guns trained on the
Palace. Matches smouldered. H&eacute;rault de S&eacute;chelles and
his crowd of deputies, hastily, confusedly, retreated and vanished
into the building.</p>

<p>De Batz burst into laughter, which found an echo among those
about him. Grinning ragamuffins looked round and up at him
approvingly. Obscenely-decked jests were tossed to and fro.</p>

<p>The Baron waited to see the tragi-comedy played out. Nor was his
patience tried. Marat, supported by some scoundrels, had followed
the deputies into the hall of the Convention, there to name the
twenty-two whose exclusion was demanded. Resistance to such force
was idle. Robespierre and a small group of the party of the
Mountain passed the decree for the arrest of the Girondins. The
main body of the assembly sat awed, humiliated, appalled by this
dictation to which they were compelled to submit.</p>

<p>Thereupon Moloch raised the siege and the members of the
Convention, virtually prisoners until that moment, were allowed to
depart. They filed out to the accompaniment of the ironical cheers
of the multitude.</p>

<p>The Baron de Batz descended from his horse-block, and took
Andr&eacute;-Louis by the arm, "That rings down the curtain on the
first act. Come. There is no more to be done here."</p>

<p>They entered the human stream of the departing mob and were
borne by it into the cool shade of the gardens, where at last they
won release. Thence by the Terrace of the Feuillants and the Rue
St. Thomas du Louvre, they made their way towards the Rue de
M&eacute;nars.</p>

<p>Here in the heart of the Section Lepelletier of the Commune of
Paris, the Baron rented in the name of his servant, Biret-Tissot,
the first floor of number seven. The locality was well chosen for a
man in his precarious position. Of all the Paris sections, the
Section Lepelletier was the least revolutionary. Consequently its
members would have few revolutionary scruples against selling
themselves. Of how widely they were in the pay of de
Batz&mdash;from Pottier de Lille, the secretary of the
Revolutionary Committee of the section, down to Captain Cortey, who
commanded its National Guard&mdash;Andr&eacute;-Louis had already
come to realize.</p>

<p>As they went, the two fell naturally into talk of what was done.
Andr&eacute;-Louis had been rather gloomily silent.</p>

<p>"You have no scruples?" he asked at last. "Your conscience makes
you no reproaches?"</p>

<p>"Reproaches!"</p>

<p>"These men, after all, are the cleanest, the best, the most
upright and honest in that galley."</p>

<p>"They're in the galley no longer. They are overboard, and the
craft will go the more surely on to the rocks without them. Wasn't
this your aim?"</p>

<p>"True. And yet ruthlessly to sacrifice men of such worth..."</p>

<p>"Were they less ruthless in sacrificing the King?"</p>

<p>"They did not mean to send him to the guillotine. They did not
desire his death. They would have saved him by suspending
sentence."</p>

<p>"The more ruthless were they in voting for his death. A cowardly
act to save their waning popularity. Bah! If you have pity, save it
for worthier objects than this crew of windy ideologues, who are
ridden by Madame Roland, from Buzot her lover (in the spirit, so
she pretends) to that pedant, her spiritual cuckold of a husband.
To this in the end, by one road or another, must they have come. We
have but shortened the journey for them."</p>

<p>"What will be the end of them?"</p>

<p>"You have seen it. The rest is not important. It is odd to
reflect that there is not a man amongst them who was not one of the
architects of this Republic upon whose altar they are now
sacrificed. Lanjuinais, the founder of the Jacobin Club; Barbaroux,
who brought the Marseillaise to the work of revolution; St.
Etienne, responsible for the shaping of the civil constitution;
Brissot, who intoxicated men with his revolutionary writings;
Fauchet, the apostle of the Revolutionary Church; and the others
who encompassed the overthrow of the throne. Are these men for a
royalist's compassion? They're gone, and with them departs all
chance of law and order in the State. The very manner of their
going is the ruin of the Convention. Henceforth the august
law-givers are the slaves of the sovereign rabble, which to-day has
discovered its sovereignty. In the exercise of this sovereignty it
must of necessity perish, for anarchy is of necessity
self-destructive." After a pause he added on a note of elation,
gripping his companion's arm: "This is monarchy's greatest hour
since the Bastille was taken four years ago. Those who remain are
easily swept away by the same forces that have removed the
Girondins."</p>

<p>He clapped the gloomy Andr&eacute;-Louis on the shoulder.
"Rejoice, then, in Heaven's name, at this vindication of the
theories with which you startled me at Hamm."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV - PRELUDE</h2>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis and the Baron dined that afternoon with
Benoit, the wealthy Ang&eacute;vin banker in the Rue des
Orties.</p>

<p>In Benoit's well-appointed establishment, as in his own
well-nourished, hearty person, there was little to proclaim the
levelling doctrines of democracy, of which he enjoyed the
reputation of being a pillar. If his movements, gestures, accent
and turn of speech, and the very gravity of his bonhomie, suggested
a plebeian origin, he yet bore himself with a general air of genial
consequence. He was a man to whom wealth had brought assurance and
self-confidence and the poise permitted by a sense of security. Nor
was this security shaken by the successive earthquakes that
disturbed the nation, and in the course of which men of birth and
quality were being constantly engulfed. Together with the millions
in his safes, there was that which in these unquiet and dangerous
times amounted to an even more precious treasure in the shape of
records of transactions on behalf of some of the architects of the
revolution. There was no party in the State some of whose members
had not operated through Benoit and profited by the operations to
an extent the revelation of which might imperil their heads.
Recommended to him one by another, they had come to regard him as a
"safe man." And Benoit on his side knew himself for a safe man in
another sense, since he held these patriots as hostages for his
safety.</p>

<p>Benoit could have told the world the precise reason for Danton's
anxiety to decree the sacredness of property; he could have
explained exactly how the great tribune and powerful apostle of
equality was becoming so considerable a landowner in the district
of Arcis. He could have disclosed how that dishonest deputy
Philippe Fabre, who called himself d'Eglantine, had made thirty-six
thousand livres on a government contract for army boots whose
cardboard soles had quickly gone to pieces. He could have shown how
Lacroix and at least a dozen other national representatives, who a
couple of years ago had been starveling lawyers, were now able to
take their ease and keep their horses.</p>

<p>But Benoit was a "safe man," and to make assurance doubly sure
he wasted no opportunity of adding to his precious hostages. Like a
fat financial spider he span his stout web in the Rue des Orties
and enmeshed in it many a speculative fly from among all these
hungry, avid politicians, most of whom, in the opinion of de Batz,
merely required to be tempted so as to succumb.</p>

<p>Of all de Batz's associates in this campaign of mine and sap
which Andr&eacute;-Louis had devised, none was more highly prized
than Benoit of Angers. And since de Batz had shown him that the
advantage of their association could be reciprocal, Benoit prized
the Baron as highly in his turn. Also, being a man of some shrewd
vision, it is probable that he reposed no faith in the perdurance
of the present r&eacute;gime. Whilst avoiding politics, he saw to
it, as a prudent man of affairs, that he possessed friends in both
camps.</p>

<p>To-day's invitation to dinner was no idle act of courtesy.
Benoit's compatriot Delaunay, the representative for Angers in the
National Convention, was to be of the party. Delaunay was in need
of money. He had just succumbed to the charms of Mademoiselle
Descoings, the actress. But the Descoings was not to be cheaply
acquired even by a National Representative. She had lately learnt a
lesson on the subject. For a brief season she had been the mistress
of that coarse scoundrel Fran&ccedil;ois Chabot, dazzled at first
by his prominence in the party of the Mountain. Intimate
acquaintance with him had revealed to her that the effulgence of
his deputyship was far from compensating for the unpleasantness of
his habits and the sordid circumstances in which the lack of money
compelled him to live. So she had gone her ways, and Delaunay was
now discovering to his torment that the association with Chabot had
taught her to be exacting and exigent.</p>

<p>Now the Deputy Delaunay, a very personable, insinuating man of
forty, was shrewd enough to perceive the opportunities which his
position afforded him, and if he might have had scruples about
making use of them, these were entirely stifled by his need of the
Descoings. But to make money in the operations of which he
perceived the chance, it is necessary to have money, and Delaunay
disposed of none. So he had sought his Ang&eacute;vin compatriot
Benoit for the necessary financial assistance.</p>

<p>Benoit was not attracted by the partnership. He perceived,
however, that it might meet certain requirements of de Batz, which
the Baron had cautiously mentioned to him.</p>

<p>"I know a man," he said, "who commands ample funds, and who is
always on the alert for precisely such affairs as you have in mind.
I think you and he might very well accommodate yourselves. Come and
dine with me one day next week, and make his acquaintance."</p>

<p>Delaunay had readily accepted the invitation, and de Batz found
the Representative awaiting him when, with Andr&eacute;-Louis, he
was ushered into the banker's well-appointed parlour.</p>

<p>A man of great vigour and energy, this Delaunay, as was to be
seen at a glance. A little above middle height, he was massively
built, with an enormous breadth of shoulders. His features were
neat, and his mouth so small that it lent an almost infantile
character to his smooth, round, healthily-coloured face, and this
despite the grey of his thick clustering hair which was innocent of
powder. But there was nothing infantile in the keenness of the
intensely blue eyes under their black eyebrows or in the massive,
intelligent forehead.</p>

<p>The banker, tall, florid, inclining to middle-aged portliness,
and dressed with care from his powdered head to his buckled shoes,
breezily conducted them to table.</p>

<p>There was no evidence here of the scarcity of food that was
beginning to trouble Paris. A dish of trout stewed in red wine was
followed by a succulent goose a l'Angevine with truffles from
Perigord, to the accompaniment of a well-sunned and well-matured
wine of Bordeaux, which Delaunay praised in terms allusive to the
events of the day.</p>

<p>"One might almost forgive the men of the Gironde for the sake of
the grapes they grow." He held his glass to the light as he spoke,
and the glance of those intensely blue eyes grew tender as it
surveyed the murrey-tinted wine. He sighed. "Poor devils!" he said,
and drank.</p>

<p>The Baron raised his brows in wonder, for Delaunay was staunchly
of the Mountain party. "You pity them?"</p>

<p>"We can afford to pity those who are no longer able to harm or
hinder us." The Representative's voice was softly modulated, but,
like the rest of him, suggested great reserves of power.
"Compassion is at times a luxury; especially when accompanied by
relief. Now that the Girondins are broken, I can say: 'Poor
devils!' with a clear conviction that it is much better that we
should say it of them than that they should say it of us."</p>

<p>Not until dinner was done, and an Armagnac had come to succeed
the Bordeaux, did the banker break the ice of the business for
them, making himself the advocate of his compatriot.</p>

<p>"I have told the Citizen-Representative, my dear de Batz, that
you are a considerable man of affairs, and that you are
particularly interested in the purchase of large lots of
confiscated &eacute;migr&eacute; property so as to break it up and
sell it again piecemeal. I do not need to tell you that the Citizen
Delaunay could be of great assistance to you by virtue of the
information he receives in his capacity as a Representative."</p>

<p>"Ah, no! Ah, no That I must correct!" The Deputy was all
virtuous eagerness. "A misconception were so easily formed. I do
not say...I do not think that it would amount to an abuse of trust
if I took advantage of knowledge gained as a result of my position
in the government. After all, it is a recognized practice not only
in France but elsewhere. This, however, is not the knowledge that I
offer. It is a malicious world, and a man's actions, especially the
actions of a man of State, are so easily misunderstood or
misinterpreted. The knowledge that I offer, then, is the quite
exceptional knowledge of land values. I am country-bred, and all my
life the land has been my particular study. It is this knowledge
that I offer, you understand, citizen."</p>

<p>"Oh, but perfectly," said de Batz. "Perfectly. Do not give
yourself the trouble of explaining further. As for your knowledge
of land values, it is no doubt exceptional; but then, so is mine;
otherwise I should never have embarked upon these transactions. I
must regret, of course, that where the association might be of
value to me, it is withheld by certain scruples which I must not
presume to criticize."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you consider them without foundation in
reality?" said Delaunay, as if asking to be persuaded of the
fact.</p>

<p>De Batz excluded all persuasiveness from his reply. "I do not
perceive who would suffer by the use of the information which it
would be in your power to supply. And it is my view that where no
suffering is inflicted, no scruples can be tenable. But a man's
conscience is a delicate, sensitive thing. I am far from wishing to
offer arguments against sentiments which are conscientious."</p>

<p>Delaunay fell gloomily thoughtful. "Do you know," he said, "that
you have presented a point of view that had never occurred to
me?"</p>

<p>"That I can perfectly understand," said the Baron, in the tone
of one who finds a subject tedious and desires to drop it. And
dropped it might have been if Andr&eacute;-Louis had not thought
that it was time for him to take a hand.</p>

<p>"It may help you, Citizen-Representative, if you reflect that
these transactions are actually of advantage to the State, which
thus finds a ready purchaser for the properties it seeks to
liquidate."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes!" Delaunay was as eager now as he had appeared
reluctant before. "That is true. Very true. It is an aspect I had
not regarded."</p>

<p>Across the table Benoit winked slyly at de Batz.</p>

<p>"Let me turn it over in my mind, Citizen de Batz, and then
perhaps we might discuss the matter anew."</p>

<p>The Baron remained cold. "If it should be your pleasure," he
said, in a tone of maddening indifference.</p>

<p>Walking home, in the cool of the evening, to the Rue de
M&eacute;nars, Andr&eacute;-Louis was in excellent spirits.</p>

<p>"That fish will bite," he said. "You may land him when you will,
Jean."</p>

<p>"I perceived it. But, after all, he's small fry, Andr&eacute;. I
aim at bigger things."</p>

<p>"The big things are to be reached by stages. Not all at once,
Jean. Impatience never helps. A small fish, this Delaunay. Agreed.
But he may serve us as a bait for bigger ones. Do not despise him.
To change the metaphor, use him as the first rung of the ladder by
which we are to scale the Mountain. Or to change it yet again, let
him be the first of the sheep to show the way through the gap."</p>

<p>"To the devil with your metaphors!"</p>

<p>"Bear them in mind, none the less."</p>

<p>They reached number seven in the Rue de M&eacute;nars. De Batz
opened the wicket in the porte-cochere, and they entered the
courtyard of the unpretentious house. Within, sitting on the steps,
they found a burly, shabby fellow in a cocked hat too big for him,
set off by an imposing tricolour cockade. He rose at sight of them,
knocking the ashes from the short day pipe he had been smoking.</p>

<p>"The Citizen Jean de Batz, heretofore Baron de Batz?" he
challenged truculently.</p>

<p>"I am Jean de Batz. Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Burlandeux is my name. Officer of the municipal police." His
tone lent a sinister quality to the announcement.</p>

<p>The Baron was not impressed. "Your business,
Citizen-Municipal?"</p>

<p>The fellow's unclean face was grim. "I have some questions to
put to you. We should be better above. But as you please."</p>

<p>"Above, by all means." The Baron spoke indifferently. "I trust
you are not to waste my time, citizen."</p>

<p>"As to that, we shall see presently."</p>

<p>They went up to the first floor, Andr&eacute;-Louis through his
uneasiness admiring the Baron's perfect deportment. De Batz
knocked, and the door was instantly opened by Biret-Tissot, his
servant, a wisp of a man with a lean olive face, keen dark eyes,
and the wide mouth of a comedian.</p>

<p>De Batz led the way into a small salon, Burlandeux following,
and Andr&eacute;-Louis bringing up the rear. The municipal would
have checked him, but de Batz intervened. "This is my friend, the
Citizen Moreau. You may speak freely before him. God be praised I
have no secrets. Close the door, Andr&eacute;. Now,
Citizen-Municipal, I am at your service."</p>

<p>Burlandeux advanced deliberately into the elegant little salon
with its gilded furniture, soft carpet and S&egrave;vres pieces set
before the oval mirror on the overmantel. He took his stand with
his back to the long narrow window.</p>

<p>"Moreau, eh? Why, yes. He was named to me as your
associate."</p>

<p>"Correctly named," said de Batz. "And then?"</p>

<p>Before that peremptoriness Burlandeux came straight to business.
"You've been denounced to me, Citizen ci-devant, for anti-civism. I
learn that you hold meetings here of persons who are none too well
regarded by the Nation."</p>

<p>"With what purpose is it alleged that I hold these
meetings?"</p>

<p>"That is what I have come to ask you. When you've answered me I
shall know whether to lay the information before the Committee of
Public Safety. Let me see your card, citizen."</p>

<p>De Batz at once produced the identity-card issued by the section
in which he resided, a card which under a recent enactment every
citizen was compelled to procure.</p>

<p>"Yours, citizen?" the municipal demanded of Andr&eacute;-Louis
with autocratic curtness.</p>

<p>Both cards were perfectly in order, having been issued to their
owners by Pottier de Lille, the secretary of the section, who was
in the Baron's pay. Burlandeux returned them without comment. Their
correctness, however, did not dismay him.</p>

<p>"Well, citizens, what have you to say? You'll not pretend to be
patriots in these dainty pimpish lodgings."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis laughed in his face. "You are under the
common delusion, my friend, that dirt is a proof of patriotism. If
that were so, you would be a great patriot."</p>

<p>Burlandeux became obscene. "You take this tone with me, do you?
Ah, that! But we shall have to look into your affairs. You have
been denounced to me as agents of a foreign power."</p>

<p>It was de Batz who answered, coolly. "Ah! Members of the
Austrian Committee, no doubt." This was an allusion to a mare's
nest which some months earlier had brought into ridicule the
Representative Chabot, who claimed to have discovered it.</p>

<p>"By God, if you are amusing yourself at my expense, you'd better
remember he laughs best who laughs last. Come now, my fine fellows.
Am I to denounce you, or will you show me reason why I
shouldn't?"</p>

<p>"What reason would satisfy you?" wondered de Batz. "These
meetings that are held here? If they are not for treasonable
purposes, what are they?"</p>

<p>"Am I the only man in Paris to receive visitors?"</p>

<p>"Visitors! Oh, visitors! But these are not ordinary visitors.
They come too often, and always at the same time, and they are
always the same. That's my information. No use to deny it. No use
to tell me any of your lies."</p>

<p>The Baron's manner changed. "Will you leave by the door, or
shall we throw you from the window?"</p>

<p>The cool incisive tone acted like a douche upon the burly
municipal. He fell back a pace and drew himself up.</p>

<p>"Ah, name of a name! My damned little aristocrat..."</p>

<p>The Baron threw wide the door of the salon to interrupt him.
"Outside, you filth! Back to your dunghill! At the double!
March!"</p>

<p>"Holy Guillotine! We shall see if you talk like that when you
come before the Committee." The purple municipal moved to the door,
deliberately so as to save his dignity. "You shall be taught a
lesson, you cursed traitors with your aristocratic airs and graces.
My name is Burlandeux. You'll remember that."</p>

<p>He was gone. They heard the outer door slam after him.
Andr&eacute;-Louis smiled deprecation.</p>

<p>"That is not quite how I should have handled him."</p>

<p>"It is not at all how he should have been handled. He should
have been thrown from the window without warning. An indelicate
fellow! Let him go before the Committee. S&eacute;nard will do his
business."</p>

<p>"I would have given S&eacute;nard definite grounds upon which to
deal with him if you had been less precipitate. However, that will
be for another time. For he will certainly return to the assault.
You should curb your humours, Jean."</p>

<p>"Curb my humours before an obscenity like that!" The Baron
snorted. "Well, well! Where is Lang&eacute;ac?"</p>

<p>He summoned Tissot. Monsieur de Lang&eacute;ac had not yet
arrived. The Baron glanced at the Sevres timepiece, and muttered an
oath of exasperation.</p>

<p>"What's to astonish you?" wondered Andr&eacute;-Louis. "The
young gentleman is never punctual. A very unsatisfactory fellow,
Jean, this Lang&eacute;ac. If he's typical of the tools d'Entragues
employs it is not surprising that the Regent's credit prospers so
little in the courts of Europe. Myself, I should be sorry to have
him for my valet."</p>

<p>To aggravate his offence, when Lang&eacute;ac arrived at last,
out of breath, he came startlingly brave in a coat of black stripes
on a yellow ground, and a cravat that Andr&eacute;-Louis likened
unkindly to an avalanche.</p>

<p>"You want to take the eye, it seems. You'll be taking that of
the National Widow. She has a taste in over-coquettish young
gentlemen."</p>

<p>Lang&eacute;ac was annoyed. He had long since conceived a
dislike for Andr&eacute;-Louis, whose sneers he had earned every
time he deserved them, which was often. "You don't dress like a
sans-culotte, yourself."</p>

<p>"Nor yet like a zebra. It's well enough in a virgin forest, but
a little conspicuous in Paris for a gentleman whose pursuits should
make him study self-effacement. Have you heard of a revolution in
France? No wonder municipal officers grow suspicious of the
ci-devant Baron de Batz on the score of his visitors."</p>

<p>Lang&eacute;ac replied with vague invective, and so came under
the condemnation of de Batz.</p>

<p>"Moreau is right. That coat is an advertisement of anticivism. A
conspirator should be circumspect, in all things."</p>

<p>"For a gentleman," said the fatuous Lang&eacute;ac, "there are
limits to circumspection."</p>

<p>"But none for a fool," said Andr&eacute;-Louis.</p>

<p>"I resent that, Moreau! You are insufferable. Insufferable, do
you understand?"</p>

<p>"If you will make transcendentally foolish statements, by way of
justifying transcendentally foolish actions, can you expect
congratulations? But I am sorry you find me insufferable."</p>

<p>"And, anyway," said de Batz, "shall we come to business? I am
supposing that you will have something to report. Have you seen
Cortey?"</p>

<p>The question recalled Lang&eacute;ac from his annoyance. "I have
just left him. The affair is for Friday night."</p>

<p>De Batz and Andr&eacute;-Louis stiffened into attention.
Lang&eacute;ac supplied details.</p>

<p>"Cortey will be on guard at the Temple from midnight with twenty
men, every one of whom he swears he can trust, and Michonis will be
on duty in the Queen's prison and ready for us. Cortey has seen
him. Michonis answers for it that the other municipals will be out
of the way. Cortey would like a final word with you on the
arrangements as soon as may be."</p>

<p>"Naturally," said de Batz. "I'll see him to-morrow. We've two
days, and at need we could be ready in two hours."</p>

<p>"Is there anything for me to do?" asked Lang&eacute;ac, his
manner still a little sulky.</p>

<p>"Nothing now. You will be of Moreau's party, to cover the
retreat. You will assemble in the Rue Charlot at eleven o'clock.
See that you are punctual. We shall convey the royal ladies and the
Dauphin to Roussel's in the Rue Helv&eacute;tius for the night, and
we shall hope to get them out of Paris a day or two later. But I
will attend to all that. For you nothing more now, Lang&eacute;ac,
until eleven o'clock on Friday night."</p>

<hr align="center" width="50%">
<a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI - IN THE RUE CHARLOT</h2>

<p>Cortey, known when in uniform as Captain Cortey, the commandant
of the National Guard of the Section Lepelletier, kept when out of
uniform a grocer's shop at the corner of the Rue de la Loi. An
orderly citizen and at heart a monarchist, he had enlisted in the
guard of the section when it was still entirely monarchical. He
remained in it out of prudence now that its character had become
entirely republican.</p>

<p>Because in its ranks there were still a good many who shared his
sentiments it had been possible for Cortey to get together a little
band of men for the attempt that was now fixed for Friday night. It
was one of those periodic occasions on which it fell to the duty of
the Section Lepelletier to supply the guard for the Temple, where
the royal prisoners were confined.</p>

<p>As captain of the guard, it lay to a limited extent within
Cortey's power to select the men for duty under him, and one of the
twenty now selected was in the conspiracy for the rescue of the
Queen. They were to co-operate with de Batz and with Sergeant
Michonis, the municipal in charge of the guard within the
prison.</p>

<p>The plan, every detail of which had been carefully worked out,
was an extremely simple one. The municipals within the Temple were
not in the habit of wearying themselves unduly with a vigilance
which the locks and bolts and the National Guard on patrol duty
outside rendered superfluously formal. So long as one of their
number complied with the order of the Committee of General Safety
by stationing himself within the chamber occupied by the royal
prisoners, the others were in the habit of retiring to the Council
Chamber, and there, within hail in case of need, they commonly
spent the night playing cards.</p>

<p>For Friday night next, Michonis would, himself, assume the duty
of guarding the prisoners, and he had undertaken to answer for it
that his eight fellow-municipals should be out of the way. To the
three royal ladies he would convey three uniforms of the National
Guard which they were to assume by midnight. At that hour a party
of a dozen men, also in uniforms of the National Guard, would knock
for admission at the Temple Gate. The porter, supposing them to be
a patrol on a round of inspection within the prison, would offer no
obstacle to their entrance. They would ascend the tower to the
Queen's chamber, gag and bind Michonis, so that afterwards he
should present the appearance of having been overpowered. They
would then place the three disguised royal ladies and the little
Dauphin in their midst, descend the staircase, and issue with them
from the prison. It was not likely that the sleepy porter would
notice the increase in the number of persons composing the patrol.
If he did, it would be the worse for him, as for any other who
should happen to surprise them before they were clear of the
prison. In this respect the orders of de Batz were precise and
ruthless. Anyone challenging them was to be dispatched with cold
steel as silently as possible.</p>

<p>Once outside, the patrol would turn the corner into the Rue
Charlot. Here Andr&eacute;-Louis' little band would be waiting to
escort the royal ladies to a courtyard where Balthazar Roussel had
a coach in readiness in which to convey them across Paris to his
house in the Rue Helv&eacute;tius. There they must lie hidden until
the hue-and-cry had died down and an opportunity presented itself
to carry them off to Roussel's country house at
Brie-Comte-Robert.</p>

<p>The part of Cortey and his men would consist in keeping out of
the way of the false patrol which would substitute them. They might
subsequently be censured for incompetent vigilance; but hardly for
more.</p>

<p>As a result of Lang&eacute;ac's communication, de Batz and
Andr&eacute;-Louis paid a visit to Cortey's shop on the following
evening, for any final understanding that might be necessary with
the grocer-captain. Sergeant Michonis was with him at the time.
Whilst they were in talk in the otherwise untenanted shop,
Andr&eacute;-Louis, chancing to turn, beheld a bulky figure
surmounted by an enormous cocked hat silhouetted in the dim light
against the shop window, as if inspecting the wares exhibited
there.</p>

<p>He detached himself from the others and sauntered to the door,
reaching it just in time to see the figure beating a retreat down
the Rue des Filles St. Thomas.</p>

<p>De Batz presently joined him, emerging, and Andr&eacute;-Louis
gave him the news.</p>

<p>"We are under the observation of our friend Burlandeux. He must
have trailed us from the Rue de M&eacute;nars."</p>

<p>De Batz made light of it. "He has seen me buying groceries
then."</p>

<p>"He may link Cortey with us afterwards, and perhaps
Michonis."</p>

<p>"In that case I shall have to devote a little attention to him.
At present his affair must wait. There are more pressing
matters."</p>

<p>These matters were all carefully disposed of in the course of
the next twenty-four hours, and on Friday night Andr&eacute;-Louis
found himself pacing the length of the Rue Charlot in the
neighbourhood of the Temple with Lang&eacute;ac and the Marquis de
la Niche&mdash;the same who had been associated with de Batz in the
attempt to rescue the King. In their pacings they passed ever and
anon the cavernous porte-coch&egrave;re of No. 12, behind whose
closed gates the carriage waited with harnessed horses in the
charge of young Balthazar Roussel.</p>

<p>The moon riding near the full in the serene June sky, the street
lamps had not been lighted. Andr&eacute;-Louis and his companions
had chosen the side of the street where the shadows lay blackest.
They were not the only ones abroad in that quiet place at this
midnight hour. Another three&mdash;Devaux, Marbot and the Chevalier
de Larnache&mdash;made a similar pacing group that crossed and
recrossed the steps of the other three. Once when a patrol had come
marching down the street, these six had disappeared with almost
magic suddenness into the black shadows of doorways, to re-emerge
when the retreating footsteps of the soldiers had faded in the
distance.</p>

<p>Midnight struck, and the six of them came together at the corner
of the Rue du Temple, ready for the action which they now supposed
imminent.</p>

<p>Action was imminent, indeed; but not of the kind they
expected.</p>

<p>Burlandeux had been busy. He had carried a denunciation before
the Revolutionary Committee of his own section, which happened to
be that of the Temple. The terms of it are best given in those
employed by one of its members, a cobbler named Simon who,
officious, fanatical and greedy of fame, had gone off with it to
the Committee of Public Safety at the Tuileries.</p>

<p>He came, he announced, to inform them that the heretofore Baron
de Batz had been denounced to his section as a counterrevolutionary
conspirator. It had been observed that he associated too frequently
for innocence with a grocer named Cortey who was in command of the
National Guard of the Section Lepelletier. It had also been
observed that another assiduous visitor of this Cortey was the
municipal Michonis, who was employed at the Temple, and only last
night Cortey, Michonis, Batz and a man named Moreau held what
appeared to the observer to be a consultation in the grocer's
shop.</p>

<p>"That is all that our informer can tell us," the Citizen Simon
concluded. "But I am not a fool, citizens. I have my wits, God be
thanked, and they show me at once a suspicious and dangerous
combination in all this."</p>

<p>The half-dozen members of the Committee of Public Safety,
assembled in haste to hear the denunciation which the cobbler had
described as urgent, were not disposed to take him seriously. In
the absence of the president of the committee, the chair had been
taken by a Representative named Lavicomterie. Now it happened that
this Lavicomterie was one of de Batz's associates, whilst
S&eacute;nard, the secretary and factotum of the committee, who was
also present and whose voice carried a deal of weight with its
members, was in the Baron's pay. The mention of the Baron's name
had rendered both these patriots extremely attentive.</p>

<p>When the squat, unclean, repellent Simon had brought his
denunciation to a close, Lavicomterie led the opinion of his fellow
committee-men by a laugh.</p>

<p>"On my soul, citizen, if this is all the matter, you had best
begin by proving that these men were not buying groceries."</p>

<p>Simon scowled. His little eyes, beady as a rat's in his yellow
face, were malevolent.</p>

<p>"This is not a matter to be treated lightly. I will ask you all,
citizens, to bear in mind that this grocer takes turn at patrolling
the Temple. Michonis is regularly on guard there. Do you see
nothing in the association?"</p>

<p>"It makes it natural," ventured S&eacute;nard.</p>

<p>"Ah! And de Batz, then? This foreign agent? What are they doing
shut up in the shop with him and this other fellow who is his
constant companion."</p>

<p>"How do you know that de Batz is a foreign agent?" asked member
of the committee.</p>

<p>"That is in the information I have received."</p>

<p>Lavicomterie followed up his associate's question. "Where is the
evidence of so very grave a charge?"</p>

<p>"Can anyone suppose that a ci-devant aristocrat, a ci-devant
Baron would be in Paris on any other business?"</p>

<p>"There are a good many ci-devants in Paris, Citizen Simon," said
S&eacute;nard. "Do you charge them all with being foreign agents?
If not, why do you single out the Citizen de Batz?"</p>

<p>Simon almost foamed at the mouth. "Because he consorts with the
sergeant who is in charge of the guard at the Temple and with the
captain of the National Guard that is to do patrol duty there
to-night. Sacred name of a name! Do you still see nothing in
it?"</p>

<p>Lavicomterie would perhaps have brushed the matter finally aside
and dismissed the fellow. But a member of the committee, taking the
view that Michonis should instantly be sent for and examined, and
others supporting him in this, Lavicomterie dared offer no
opposition.</p>

<p>As a sequel soon after eleven o'clock that night, the Citizen
Simon, swollen in importance and accompanied by a body of half a
dozen lads of his section&mdash;for he was prepared at need to
exceed his orders and proceed upon his own
initiative&mdash;presented himself at the gate of the Temple.
Having displayed the warrant granted him by the Committee of Public
Safety, he made his way at once to the Queen's chamber in the
tower, to assure himself that all was well.</p>

<p>Silently he surveyed the three pale-faced ladies in black who
occupied that cheerless room and the boy who was now King of
France, asleep on a wretched truckle-bed, and turned his attention
to Michonis. He presented him with an order to surrender his charge
temporarily to the bearer, and himself attend at once before the
Committee of Public Safety, which was sitting to receive him.</p>

<p>Michonis, a tall, loose-limbed fellow, could not exclude from
his frank, good-humoured countenance a dismay that amounted almost
to anguish. At once he concluded that there had been betrayal. But
the danger of losing his own head over the business troubled him
less than the thought of the bitter sorrow that was coming to these
sorely-tried royal ladies whose hopes of deliverance now ran so
high. This seemed to him one of Fate's refinements of cruelty. He
was anxious, too, on the score of de Batz, who might now walk into
a trap from which there would be no escape. He was wondering how he
might warn the Baron when Simon, whose close-set eyes had been
watching his face, put an end to that conjecture by informing
Michonis that he would send him before the Committee of Public
Safety under guard.</p>

<p>"It is an arrest, then!" cried the dismayed municipal. "Your
order says nothing of that."</p>

<p>"Not an arrest?" He was answered with a close-lipped mile. "Just
a precaution."</p>

<p>Michonis displayed anger. "Your warrant for this?"</p>

<p>"My common sense. You may leave me to account for my
actions."</p>

<p>And so Michonis, in fear and suppressed fury, departed from the
Temple under the escort of two municipals, leaving Simon in charge
there in his place.</p>

<p>The other municipals, who had looked forward to a night of ease
over their cards, to which Michonis had educated them by now, were
ordered by Simon to those various posts of duty on the staircase
and elsewhere, which it had long since been regarded as superfluous
to guard.</p>

<p>When the false patrol arrived at a few minutes before midnight,
the diligent Simon was in the courtyard.</p>

<p>A lieutenant marched in his men&mdash;a dozen of them&mdash;and
in their wake, before the gates could be closed, came a civilian,
plainly dressed and brisk of step, whose face was lost in the
shadow of a wide-brimmed hat.</p>

<p>Challenged by the guard, this civilian presented a sheet of
paper. The sentry was unable to read; but the official aspect of
the paper was unmistakable, and the round seal of the Convention at
the head of it was an ideograph with which he was familiar.</p>

<p>Simon strolled forward. His own bodyguard of patriots was at
hand there for any emergency such as the suspected treason of
Cortey might provide.</p>

<p>"Who's this?" he asked.</p>

<p>A trim, stiffly-built figure stood unmoved before him, making no
attempt to answer. The sentry handed the paper to Simon, and held
up his lantern, so that the light fell on the sheet.</p>

<p>It was an order from the Committee of Public Safety to the
Citizen Dumont, whom it described as a medical practitioner, to
visit the Dauphin in his prison at the Temple and report at once
upon his health.</p>

<p>Simon read the paper a second time, scanning it closely.
Undoubtedly it was in order; seal and signature were all as they
should be. But Simon was by no means satisfied. With an exaggerated
sense of the authority in which he had so lately been vested, he
accounted it odd that he should not have been informed by the
committee of the existence of this order.</p>

<p>"This is a strange hour for such a visit," he growled,
mistrustfully, as he handed back the paper.</p>

<p>The civilian's answer was prompt. "It should have been paid some
hours ago. But I have other patients as important as this Capet
brat. My report must be made by morning."</p>

<p>"It is odd! Cursedly odd!" Muttering, Simon took the lantern
from the hands of the sentry and held it up so that the light
dissipated the shadows under that round black hat. He recoiled at
sight of the man of medicine's face.</p>

<p>"De Batz!" he ejaculated. Then with an unclean oath, almost in a
breath he added: "Arrest that man!"</p>

<p>Even as he spoke he sprang forward, himself to seize the
pseudo-doctor. He was met by a kick in the stomach that sent him
sprawling. The lantern was shivered on the cobbles, and before the
winded Simon could pick himself up the Baron had vanished. The men
of the patrol who helped him to rise detained him with a solicitude
for his injuries, for which he cursed them furiously whilst
struggling to deliver himself from their arms. At last he broke
away. "After him!" he screamed. "Follow me!" And he dashed through
the gateway, his own myrmidons at his heels.</p>

<p>The false lieutenant, a big fellow named Boissancourt, judged
that he had ensured for de Batz a sufficient start to enable him to
reach the neighbouring shelter of No. 12 in the Rue Charlot. As the
alarm now brought the whole guard of municipals streaming into the
courtyard, Boissancourt coolly marched out his patrol, and left the
porter to explain. To have followed Simon would have led to meeting
him on his return. Explanations must have ensued, with incalculable
consequences to themselves and also perhaps to Cortey. Boissancourt
judged it best in all the circumstances to march his patrol away in
the opposite direction and then disperse it. For to-night the blow
had failed.</p>

<p>So far as de Batz was concerned, Boissancourt's assumptions were
exact. The Baron made for the Rue Charlot. He obeyed instinct
rather than reasoned thought. He was as yet too confused to think.
All that he realized was that either by accident or betrayal the
carefully-prepared plot was ruined, and he himself in the tightest
corner he had yet known, not even excepting his adventure on the
morning of the King's execution. If he were caught to-night, whilst
still, as it were, red-handed, it would certainly be the end of
him. Not all the influence he could command would suffice to save
him from the tale of his attempt to gain access to the royal
prisoners.</p>

<p>He must trust, therefore, to speed; and so he ran as he had
never run before; and already the feet of his pursuers came
clattering after him.</p>

<p>To the six who waited at the corner of the Rue Charlot this
patter of running feet was the first intimation at once that the
moment for action had arrived and that this action was other than
that for which they were prepared. Their uneasiness swiftly mounted
to alarm at the sounds which followed: a shout, an explosion of
vociferation, and the rapidly approaching clatter that told of
flight and pursuit. No sooner had Louis realized it than the
pursued was amongst them revealing himself for de Batz in a
half-dozen imprecatory words which announced the failure and bade
them save themselves.</p>

<p>He scarcely paused to utter them before plunging on down the Rue
Charlot.</p>

<p>Instinctively the others would have followed him in his flight,
had not Andr&eacute;-Louis arrested them.</p>

<p>"Turn about, and hold them," he commanded crisply. "We must
cover his retreat."</p>

<p>It needed no more to remind them that this was, indeed, their
duty. At whatever cost to themselves the Baron's valuable life must
be preserved.</p>

<p>A moment later the pursuers were upon them, a half-dozen lads
led by the bow-legged Simon. It was a relief to discover that they
had to deal with civilians, for Andr&eacute;-Louis had entertained
an unpleasant fear that bayonets were about to make short work of
them.</p>

<p>Simon hailed them with confidence and authority. "To us,
citizens! After that fellow who passed you. He's a traitor
scoundrel."</p>

<p>He and his followers pressed forward looking for nothing here
but compliance and reinforcement. To their surprise they found
themselves flung back by the six who held the street. The Citizen
Simon raged furiously.</p>

<p>"In the name of the law! Out of the way! We are agents of the
Committee of Public Safety."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis derided them. "Agents of the Committee of
Public Safety! Any gang of footpads can call itself that." He stood
forward, his manner peremptory, addressing Simon. "Your card,
citizen? It happens that I am an agent of the committee,
myself."</p>

<p>As a ruse to gain time, nothing could have been better. Some
precious moments were wasted in sheer surprise. Then Simon grew
frenzied by the need for haste if the fugitive Baron was not to
escape him.</p>

<p>"I summon you to help me overtake that runagate scoundrel. We'll
make each other's better acquaintance afterwards. Come on!"</p>

<p>Again he attempted to advance, and again he was flung rudely
back.</p>

<p>"Not so fast. I'll make your acquaintance now, if you please.
Where is this card of yours, citizen? Out with it, or we'll march
you to the post of the Section."</p>

<p>Simon swore foully, and suspicions awoke in him. "By God! I
believe you all belong to this same gang of damned traitors.
Where's your own card?"</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis' hand went to the pocket of his
riding-coat.</p>

<p>"It's here." He fumbled for a moment, adding this to the wasted
time. When at last he brought forth his hand again, it grasped a
pistol by the barrel. The butt of it crashed upon the Citizen
Simon's brow, and sent him reeling back to tumble in a heap.</p>

<p>"Sweep them out of the way," cried Andr&eacute;-Louis, plunging
forward.</p>

<p>In an instant battle was joined and eleven men were a writhing,
thrusting, stabbing human clot. Hoarse voices blended discordantly;
a pistol shot went off. The street was awakening. Windows were
being thrown up and even doors were opening.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis, desperately beating off an attack that
seemed concentrated upon himself, suddenly caught the glow of
lanterns and the livid gleam of bayonets rounding the corner of the
Rue de Bretagne. A patrol was advancing at the double. At first he
thought it might be Cortey and his men, or Boissancourt, either of
which would perhaps have meant salvation. But realizing at once
from the direction of their approach that there was no ground for
the hope, he gave the word to scatter.</p>

<p>"Away! Away! Every man for himself!"</p>

<p>He turned to set the example of flight, when one of Simon's men
leapt upon him, and bore him down. He twisted even as he fell, drew
his second pistol with his left hand, and fired. It missed his
assailant, but brought down another of the patriots with a bullet
in his leg. Only two of them remained entirely whole, and these two
were both now upon Andr&eacute;-Louis. They were joined by Simon,
who, having recovered from the blow that had felled him, came
staggering towards them. Of the other three, one sat against a wall
nursing a broken head from which the blood was streaming, a second
lay face downward in the middle of the street, whilst the third,
crippled by the bullet in his leg, was howling dismally.</p>

<p>Of the royalists, the Chevalier de Larnache was dead, with a
knife in his heart, and Andr&eacute;-Louis lay inert, stretched out
by a blow over the head from one of his captors. The other four
royalists had vanished when the patrol reached the field of
battle.</p>

<p>Their escape was assisted by the fact that, entirely
misunderstanding the situation, the sergeant of the patrol ordered
his men to surround these disturbers of the peace, and the Citizen
Simon standing now before him, was still too dazed by the effects
of the blow to think of more than one thing at a time. At the
moment he was being required by the sergeant to give an account of
himself. He produced his civic card. The sergeant scanned it.</p>

<p>"What were you doing here, Citizen Simon?"</p>

<p>"What was I doing here? Ah, that! Sacred name of a pig, what was
I doing?" He almost choked in his fury. "I was defeating a royalist
plot to save the Widow Capet and her cub. But for me her
aristocratic friends would have got her away by now. And you ask me
what I am doing! As it is, the damned scoundrels have got off; all
but this one, who's dead, and this one we hold."</p>

<p>The sergeant was incredulous. "Oh, but a plot to save the
heretofore Queen! How could that have succeeded?"</p>

<p>"How?" Fiercer grew the Citizen Simon before this incredulity.
"Take me to the headquarters of the section. I'll explain myself
there, by God! And let your men bring along this cursed aristocrat.
On your lives, don't let him get away. I mean to make sure of this
one. It'll be one of the cursed fribbles for the guillotine,
anyway."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII - AT CHARONNE</h2>

<p>In the outskirts of the hamlet of Charonne, between four and
five miles from Paris, on the very edge of the Park of Bagnolet,
the Baron de Batz possessed a pleasant little property, which had
once, in the days of the Regency, been a hunting pavilion. It was
tenanted in 1793 by the talented Babette de Grandmaison, who until
lately had been a singer at the Italian Theatre. The property was
nominally owned by her brother Burette, who was the postmaster of
Beauvais. Burette was no more than a mask for the Baron de Batz.
Foreseeing that the property of the nobles, whether they emigrated
or remained in France, was doomed to confiscation, and acting with
that foresight which usually enabled him to carry out his
undertakings with safety if not always with success, the Baron had
made a simulated sale of this property to Burette, who was not
likely to be molested in his possessions.</p>

<p>In this country retreat on the day after the miscarried attempt
to save the Queen, the survivors of the rough-and-tumble in the Rue
Charlot were assembled with de Batz.</p>

<p>The Baron had succeeded last night in finding shelter at No. 12,
where, some hours later, when the alarm had died down, the others
had come one by one to join him. They had remained there until
morning. Then, because he had deemed it prudent to disappear from
Paris for some days, he had made his way to Charonne, quitting
Paris by the Enfer Barrier rather than by that of the Bastille
which led directly to the Charonne road. Thither he had bidden his
companions to follow him severally, and thither they had safely
come.</p>

<p>Lang&eacute;ac had arrived late in the afternoon, some hours
after the others, for Lang&eacute;ac accounted it his duty to
inform the Chevalier de Pomelles, who was d'Entragues' chief agent
in Paris&mdash;the head of the royalist committee which d'Entragues
had established there&mdash;of last night's events.</p>

<p>Lang&eacute;ac found de Batz at table with Devaux, Boissancourt,
La Guiche and Roussel. Babette de Grandmaison was also present, a
dark, handsome young woman who belonged body and soul to the Baron
and who shared now the dejection which, whilst general, sat most
heavily upon de Batz. As much as by the exasperating failure of his
cherished plot and by the apparently fortuitous wrecking of plans
so carefully prepared was de Batz now troubled by the fate of
Andr&eacute;-Louis, whom he had come to love and to whose gallant
stand he owed his own escape.</p>

<p>Lang&eacute;ac's arrival aroused the hope of news. De Batz
started up eagerly as the young man entered. Lang&eacute;ac met his
anxious questions with a shrug.</p>

<p>"I have no definite news. But there is no ground for any
hope."</p>

<p>De Batz displayed a fierce impatience. He was white, his eyes
blood-injected.</p>

<p>"Is he alive, at least?"</p>

<p>Lang&eacute;ac was entirely pessimistic, and rather languid.
"Does it matter? For his own sake I hope that he is not. It will be
the guillotine for him if he has survived. That is inevitable."</p>

<p>De Batz was beyond being civil. "Devil take your assumptions! I
do not ask for them. I ask for facts. If you have been unable to
glean any, say so, and I'll employ someone else to obtain them, or
else go myself."</p>

<p>Lang&eacute;ac's lips tightened sulkily. "I have already told
you that I bring no news."</p>

<p>"I should have known you wouldn't. You're so damned careful of
your skin, Lang&eacute;ac. Will you tell me what you've been doing
all these hours in Paris?"</p>

<p>Lang&eacute;ac faced him across the table. "I've not been taking
care of my skin, sir! And I resent your words. You have no right to
use them to me."</p>

<p>"I care nothing about your resentments." The Baron rapped his
knuckles on the table. "I ask you what you have been doing in
Paris. All that it imported me to know is whether Moreau is
alive."</p>

<p>The gigantic and rather phlegmatic Boissancourt, beside whose
chair Lang&eacute;ac was standing, leaned across to set a hand on
the Baron's arm. "Patience, de Batz, my friend," he boomed in his
great voice. "You have already been answered. After all,
Lang&eacute;ac can't work miracles."</p>

<p>The hawk-faced, impetuous young Marquis de La Guiche agreed with
bitterly ironical vehemence. "That's the truth, by God!"</p>

<p>Devaux sought to keep the peace. "The fact is, Lang&eacute;ac,
we are all a little fretted."</p>

<p>De Batz shrugged impatiently, and set himself to pace the room
in line with the three long windows that stood open to the lawn.
Babette's handsome eyes followed him, pain and anxiety in their
dark depths. Then she looked up at the resentful newcomer with a
sad little smile.</p>

<p>"You are standing, Monsieur de Lang&eacute;ac. Sit down and give
yourself something to eat. You will be tired and hungry."</p>

<p>"Tired, yes. God knows I'm tired. But too sick at heart for
hunger. I thank you, mademoiselle." He flung himself into a chair,
stretching his dusty legs under the table. He too was pale, his
red-brown hair dishevelled. "Give me some wine, Devaux."</p>

<p>Devaux passed him the bottle, whilst de Batz continued to pace,
like a caged animal. At last he halted.</p>

<p>"I must know," he announced. "I can't bear any more of this
uncertainty."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately," said Devaux, "Lang&eacute;ac is right. There is
no uncertainty. Oh, spare me your scowls, de Batz. God knows I am
as sick at heart as you are. But facts must be faced, and we must
count our losses without self-deception. Larnache was killed, and
if Moreau wasn't, he soon will be. He is irrevocably lost."</p>

<p>De Batz swore viciously. "If he's not dead," he added, "I'll get
him out of their hands somehow."</p>

<p>"If you try," said Devaux, "you will merely thrust your own head
through the window of the guillotine, and you owe it to us all and
to the cause not to do that. Come to your senses, man. This is not
a matter in which you can interfere. Not all the influence you can
command&mdash;not if you had twenty times the influence you
have&mdash;could you do anything. If you attempt it you'll doom
yourself by betraying your share in last night's events, which
rests at present on the word of only one man who could easily be
shown to have been mistaken in the dark. Resign yourself, my
friend. There are no battles without casualties."</p>

<p>De Batz sat down and took his head in his hands. There was a
lugubrious silence. Devaux, himself a member of a government
department, spoke with authority. Moreover, he was known for a man
of calm, clear judgment. Boissancourt and Roussel confirmed his
words. The Marquis de la Guiche, however, was more of the temper of
de Batz.</p>

<p>"If we knew at least how this thing happened!" he exclaimed.
"Was it just blundering Fate that intervened, or was there
betrayal?" He turned to Lang&eacute;ac. "You did not think of
seeking news of Michonis at his house?"</p>

<p>"You may call me a coward for that," the young man answered.
"But, frankly, I dared not. If there was betrayal, the house of
Michonis would be a trap for any of us."</p>

<p>The Baron's face remained sternly inscrutable.</p>

<p>"You have not yet told us what actually you did in Paris."</p>

<p>"I went to the Rue de M&eacute;nars, and I saw Tissot. There had
been no domiciliary visit there, which at least is hopeful, for in
the event of betrayal that is where investigations must have
begun."</p>

<p>The Baron nodded. "Yes. Well? After that?"</p>

<p>"After that I sought Pomelles."</p>

<p>La Guiche flung him a fresh sneer.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course you must report our failure to d'Entragues'
committee."</p>

<p>"You will remember, Monsieur le Marquis, that, after all, I am
d'Entragues' man."</p>

<p>"I should like you better if I could forget it, Lang&eacute;ac,"
said de Batz. "What had Pomelles to say?"</p>

<p>"I am required to start for Hamm at once, to report the
event."</p>

<p>At this the Baron's barely-suppressed fury burst forth
again.</p>

<p>"Ah, that, for instance! To be sure he'll be in haste to have my
failure reported, and your friend d'Entragues will rub his hands
over it. When do you start?"</p>

<p>"To-night, if you offer no objection."</p>

<p>"I? Offer objection? To your departure? My good Lang&eacute;ac,
I have never yet discovered a use for you. I thought I had last
night. But you have shown me how ridiculous was the assumption. Oh,
you may go to Hamm or to Hell when you please."</p>

<p>Lang&eacute;ac got up. "De Batz, you are intolerable!"</p>

<p>"Report it with the rest."</p>

<p>Lang&eacute;ac was shaking with indignation. "You make me glad
that our association is at an end."</p>

<p>"Then we are both pleased, Lang&eacute;ac. A safe journey to
you."</p>

<hr align="center" width="50%">
<a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII - LANG&Eacute;AC'S REPORT</h2>

<p>It may be that as a consequence of the terms on which they
parted Lang&eacute;ac permitted no hopefulness to mitigate the
pessimism of the report he presented to d'Entragues at Hamm a week
later.</p>

<p>And d'Entragues actually did rub his hands as de Batz had
foretold.</p>

<p>"That boastful Gascon's failure was foregone," he commented with
his crooked smile. "Nothing else ever attends his rhodomontades.
This would be a dark moment if our hopes had rested upon his
success. Fortunately her majesty's deliverance is as good as
assured by my own measures at Vienna. The Mar&eacute;chal de Coburg
has received instructions to propose an exchange of prisoners. The
members of the Convention whom Dumouriez delivered to Austria
against the imprisoned members of the royal family. I hear from
Monsieur de Trauttmansdorff that the proposal has been well
received, and there is now little doubt that the exchange will be
effected. So that the failure of Monsieur de Batz finds me without
tears." He paused. "What gentleman did you say his rashness has
lost to us?"</p>

<p>"The Chevalier de Larnache and Andr&eacute;-Louis Moreau."</p>

<p>"Moreau?" D'Entragues searched his memory a moment. "Oh, yes!
That other Rhodomont whom de Batz enlisted here. Why..." He checked
on a sudden thought. The expression of his dark, lean face was very
odd, thought Monsieur de Lang&eacute;ac as he watched it. Abruptly
the Count asked him: "Was Monsieur Moreau killed, do you say?"</p>

<p>"If he was not killed on the spot, which he may well have been,
he will certainly be dead by now. The Revolutionary Tribunal would
not be likely to spare a man arraigned on his indictment."</p>

<p>D'Entragues was plunged in thought. At last, "Well, well!" he
said. "You had better come with your tale to Monsieur. I think it
will interest him."</p>

<p>Within an hour or two of hearing Monsieur de Lang&eacute;ac's
report, the Comte de Provence paid a visit to the Lord of Gavrillac
at his lodging at the Bear Inn.</p>

<p>In a prince so rigid in the observance of forms, this was an
overwhelming condescension. But it was no longer a novelty where
Monsieur de Kercadiou and his niece were concerned. It was become a
habit on the part of his highness to drop in upon them in informal,
unceremonious fashion, and to sit in that room of theirs, his
mantle of rank if not entirely discarded at least so far loosened
on these occasions that he would discuss with them almost on terms
of equality the news of the day and the hopes and fears which he
built upon it.</p>

<p>Aline's preconceptions on the score of birth and rank discovered
for her in this, in the earnestness with which Monsieur would
canvass her opinions and in the attention with which he would
listen to them when expressed, a very subtle flattery. The regard
which he invariably showed her served to increase her regard both
for him and for herself. His patience in straitened circumstances,
his fortitude in the face of adversity, brought her to perceive in
him a personal nobility which gratified her every expectation, lent
a romantic glamour to his clumsy, almost plebeian exterior. In the
background, to confirm her perception in him of these truly
princely qualities and to quicken her admiration of them, stood
that born intriguer, the Mephistophelian d'Entragues with dark ends
of his own to serve.</p>

<p>The ambitions of the Comte d'Entragues aimed high, as we know.
He had known how to render himself indispensable to the Regent. It
was for him to maintain himself in this position, to the end that
when the restoration came he should be the first man in the State.
D'Avaray's high favour with Monsieur offered the only possible
obstacle to the ultimate full achievement of that ambition. The
Comte d'Avaray owed his position in the first instance to Madame de
Balbi. It was she who had placed him at Monsieur's side and between
them d'Avaray and de Balbi ruled his highness. Let Madame de Balbi
be thrust from her high place as ma&icirc;tresse-en-titre and
d'Avaray's security would be shaken at the same time. Therefore, it
was against her that d'Entragues directed his underground attack.
Several already had been the ladies who had aroused his hopes. But
the Regent in these affairs was just a callow, ostentatious boaster
Not only must he kiss and tell; but to him kissing without telling
would scarcely be worth the trouble. Through all his infidelities,
Monsieur had continued, after his fashion, faithful to Madame de
Balbi. But now at last d'Entragues foresaw an affair of quite
another order. Ever on the alert, he had observed in Monsieur's
eyes when they dwelt upon the delicate Mademoiselle de Kercadiou,
something upon which solidly to build his hopes. And the study of
Aline, herself, had confirmed him. Here, either his highness would
never prevail, or else, if he prevailed, Mademoiselle de
Kercadiou's rule would be absolute. Thus had d'Entragues come to
regard her as the one person who might achieve the complete and
permanent eclipse of the Balbi.</p>

<p>But like all truly efficient and dangerous intriguers,
d'Entragues never hurried matters; as long as he beheld them
travelling, however slowly, in the desired direction, he practised
patience. He had perceived the obstacle to his aims in Mademoiselle
de Kercadiou's attachment to Andr&eacute;-Louis Moreau. So whilst
on the one hand he was irritated by the intervention of de Batz in
a province which he regarded as his own, he found compensation in
the fact that de Batz was removing Moreau for the time being from
Mademoiselle de Kercadiou's neighbourhood. His satisfaction in this
had been immeasurably increased by the perception that Monsieur
himself had welcomed this removal. To this and to this only, had
d'Entragues assigned the sudden volte-face, the sudden assumption
of graciousness towards those two adventurers, in defiance even of
Monsieur d'Artois, by which the Regent had made sure that
Andr&eacute;-Louis Moreau should accompany the Baron de Batz to
France.</p>

<p>You conceive, therefore, the secret satisfaction with which
d'Entragues ushered Monsieur de Lang&eacute;ac and the story of
Moreau's end to his highness. And he fancied that the Regent's
glance had brightened even whilst he expressed grief at that young
adventurer's untoward death encountered in the service of the House
of Bourbon.</p>

<p>There was, however, no suspicion of brightness in the Regent's
glance when he went to pay his visit that afternoon to Monsieur de
Kercadiou. His gloom was so marked that as uncle and niece rose to
receive him, Aline cried out at once with sincere solicitude.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur! You have had bad news."</p>

<p>He stared at them lugubriously from the doorway. He fetched a
heavy sigh, half raised his right hand, then let it fall again.
"How quick, mademoiselle, are your perceptions! How very
quick!"</p>

<p>"Ah, monseigneur, who is not quick to perceive the signs of
distress in those we love and honour?"</p>

<p>He moved forward with that ponderous, jerky gait of his to the
chair which Monsieur de Kercadiou made haste to set for him. The
Comte d'Entragues, who was in attendance, paused to close the
door.</p>

<p>Some roses culled by Aline that morning stood in a bowl of green
ware upon the table, their presence lending a grace to the modest
chamber, their fragrance sweetening the air of it.</p>

<p>His highness settled himself in the chair. He yielded to the
habit of thrusting the ferrule of his cane into the side of his
shoe. His glance was upon the ground.</p>

<p>"My heart is heavy, indeed," he said. "The attempt to save her
majesty has failed, and failed in such circumstances that no
renewal of the attempt would appear possible."</p>

<p>There was a silence. The Regent fidgeted with his cane. Aline's
countenance betrayed her sincere distress. It was Monsieur de
Kercadiou at last who spoke.</p>

<p>"And Monsieur de Batz? Monsieur de Batz and those who were with
him?"</p>

<p>Monsieur avoided the straining eyes of Aline. His voice came
huskily. His tone suggested reservations. "Monsieur de Batz is
safe."</p>

<p>D'Entragues did not miss the shiver that ran through
Mademoiselle, or the sudden pallor that made her staring eyes look
black.</p>

<p>"And...and the others?" she asked in a dry, unsteady voice. "The
others? Monsieur Moreau? What of Monsieur Moreau, monseigneur?"</p>

<p>There was silence. Monsieur's glance continued intent upon the
waxed floor. It was clear that he could not bear to look at her. He
moved his shoulders a little. He sighed and his plump hand was
raised and lowered again in a gesture of helplessness. Gently
d'Entragues answered for him.</p>

<p>"We have cause to fear the worst, mademoiselle."</p>

<p>"You have cause...What cause? Tell me, monsieur."</p>

<p>"In God's name, monsieur!" cried Kercadiou.</p>

<p>Monsieur d'Entragues found it easier to address himself to the
Lord of Gavrillac. "There is room for no hope at all touching
Monsieur Moreau."</p>

<p>"You mean that he is...dead?"</p>

<p>"Alas, monsieur."</p>

<p>Kercadiou made an inarticulate noise, and put up his hands as if
to ward a blow. Mademoiselle, ashen-faced, staggered back to a
chair, and sat down abruptly, her hands limp in her lap, her eyes
staring straight before her.</p>

<p>The room and its tenants dissolved out of her vision. In its
place came a scene of crisp snow under sunshine dappled with the
shadows of snow-clad branches beside a dark-flowing stream; and
there keeping step with her strode Andr&eacute;-Louis, straight,
slim, masterful, alert and intensely alive. That was her last,
dearest memory of her vivid lover as he had walked with her on a
morning half a year ago.</p>

<p>And then she grew conscious once more of the room in which she
sat. She found the Regent standing over her, his hand upon her
shoulder. It seemed to her that it was his touch which had pulled
her back into the hideous present. He was uttering a protest, in
his thick, purring voice.</p>

<p>"D'Entragues, you were too abrupt. You should have used more
care, you fool."</p>

<p>Next she heard her own voice, oddly level and controlled. "Do
not blame Monsieur d'Entragues, monseigneur. Such news is best
given quickly and plainly."</p>

<p>"My poor child!" The purring note in his voice grew deeper. His
hand pressed more heavily upon her shoulder. "My poor child!" He
stood over her, portly, dull-eyed and silent for a long moment,
until he found the words he needed. "Of all the sacrifices made in
the sacred cause of Throne and Altar, I count none more heavy than
this." It might have seemed a startling exaggeration until he
explained it. "For, believe me, Mademoiselle, I would suffer
anything rather than that pain and sorrow should touch you."</p>

<p>"Monseigneur, you are good. You are very good." She spoke
mechanically. A moment later, looking at Monsieur d'Entragues, she
asked: "How did it happen?"</p>

<p>"Fetch Lang&eacute;ac," his highness commanded.</p>

<p>Lang&eacute;ac, who had been left waiting below, was brought up.
Nervously he stood before this sorrow, to tell the tale of those
events in the Rue Charlot.</p>

<p>Aline had no tears. Even now she could scarcely realize this
thing. Her senses were in rebellion against belief. It seemed so
impossible that Andr&eacute;&mdash;her Andr&eacute;, so quick, so
vital, so mercurial in mind and body&mdash;should be dead.</p>

<p>Gradually, as Lang&eacute;ac unfolded his tale, conviction was
borne in upon her. His story was that Moreau had been killed on the
spot. The probability was converted into certainty out of
charitable motives. It had been suggested by d'Entragues, and the
Regent had approved it, that thus she would suffer less than if she
were tortured by doubts of his possible survival merely that he
might perish on the guillotine.</p>

<p>"There I recognize him," she said quietly, when the tale was
done. "He gave himself to save another. That is the story of all
his life."</p>

<p>Still she had no tears. These were not to come until later, not
until she and Madame de Plougastel were in each other's arms,
seeking in each other strength to bear this common sorrow.</p>

<p>The Countess had heard the news from her husband. In his
ignorance of the relationship in which she stood to
Andr&eacute;-Louis he had conveyed it to her with a brutal lack of
mitigation.</p>

<p>"That boastful fool, de Batz, has failed again, as all might
have known he would. And his failure has cost some lives. All that
has been accomplished is to save Aline de Kercadiou from the
preposterous m&eacute;salliance she contemplated. Moreau has been
killed."</p>

<p>Receiving no answer, he turned to question her, and found that
she had fainted. Amazed, his amazement blent with a certain
unreasoned indignation, he stood frowning over her before making
any attempt to summon assistance.</p>

<p>When at last she was restored, he pompously demanded
explanations. She offered the best she could. She had known
Andr&eacute;-Louis from his childhood; and then there was her
sorrow on behalf of Aline, whose heart would be broken by this
dreadful thing. On that she had gone in quest of Mademoiselle de
Kercadiou, at once to bear consolation and to seek it, whilst the
Lord of Gavrillac, himself deeply afflicted, vainly sought to
comfort both.</p>

<p>Monsieur had departed in a gloom deeper than that in which he
had come. This was perhaps explained by his first words as they
walked in the bright sunshine towards the chalet.</p>

<p>"She would seem to have held that rascal in very deep
affection."</p>

<p>Monsieur d'Entragues, tall and elegant at his side, barely
repressed a smile.</p>

<p>"All things considered, it is perhaps as well that Monsieur
Moreau is out of the way."</p>

<p>"Eh? What?" The Regent stood still, a startled man. Had he heard
in the words of the Count an echo of his own thoughts.</p>

<p>Monsieur d'Entragues' view of the matter accorded with Monsieur
de Plougastel's. "Had he lived an unhappy m&eacute;salliance might
have resulted."</p>

<p>"Ah!" The Regent took a deep breath, and moved on. "That is my
own view of the matter. But I must wish that her distress had been
less sharp."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle de Kercadiou is young. At her age grief is soon
conquered."</p>

<p>"We must do our best to comfort the poor child,
d'Entragues."</p>

<p>"Why, yes. That becomes almost a duty."</p>

<p>"A duty, d'Entragues. A duty. That is the word. Moreau died in
my service, after all. Yes, a duty."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX - REPAYMENT</h2>

<p>Monsieur de Lang&eacute;ac's story that Andr&eacute;-Louis
Moreau had been killed in the Rue Charlot, which he and those who
charitably bade him tell it as charitably hoped might be true, was
entirely false.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis recovered consciousness long before they
brought him to the headquarters of the Section. In fact, he made
most of the journey thither upon his own feet. By the time his
senses cleared and coherent thought was added once more to mere
physical impressions, he came to the opinion subsequently expressed
by Monsieur de Lang&eacute;ac that it would have been a better
thing for him if he had been finished outright in that
rough-and-tumble. In that case his dying would have been completely
done by now; whereas at present it still lay before him; and he
would have to travel to it by the unpleasant way of the Place de la
Revolution and the National Barber. Of this there was in his mind
no shadow of doubt. Not even the far-reaching influence wielded by
de Batz could accomplish the miracle of delivering a man taken
red-handed in the business with which Andr&eacute;-Louis would be
charged.</p>

<p>It was long after midnight when they reached the headquarters of
the Section and at that hour there was no one there before whom he
could be brought for examination. Simon, himself, however, formally
demanded his name, age and place of abode so that he might enter
them upon the register. But Andr&eacute;-Louis could not suffer
Simon to go beyond these matters.</p>

<p>"You may be a police agent. But you are not a judge. And you
have no authority to question me. Therefore, I shall not answer
you."</p>

<p>They deprived him of his pistols, money, watch and papers. They
thrust him into a small, almost windowless room in a cellar, whose
only furniture was a three-legged stool and a pile of unclean straw
to serve for a bed, and there they left him for the night to
reflect upon the abrupt and unpleasant end to his kingmaking.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock in the morning they haled him from his cell,
and despite his demands for food, he was marched away with his fast
unbroken. Six National Guards of the Section formed his escort, and
Simon accompanied them.</p>

<p>They crossed the river by the Bridge of the Louvre and came to
the Tuileries before nine. There, in the spacious entrance hall,
the Citizen Simon was informed that the Committee of Public Safety
would not be in session until noon, as its members were in the
Convention. But the president was in his office, and would deal
with the matter if it was urgent. Simon, whose sense of his own
consequence was hourly increasing, noisily proclaimed it of the
greatest national urgency. The usher led the way up the great
staircase. Simon stepped beside him. Andr&eacute;-Louis followed
between two guards, the other four remained below.</p>

<p>They came by the wide gallery to a lofty chamber with gilded
furnishings and damask panels which still showed signs of the
damage suffered in the assault upon the Palace nearly a year
ago.</p>

<p>Here the usher left them, whilst he passed beyond a tall, ornate
door to announce the Citizen Simon's business to the president.</p>

<p>They were kept waiting some time. The grimy, bow-legged agent
began to grumble. Pacing the polished floor, he demanded to be
informed by no one in particular whether they had returned to the
days of the Capets and the manners of the despots that a patriot
should be left cooling his heels in an ante-chamber which the
Citizen Simon qualified by unprintable adjectives.</p>

<p>The two National Guards enjoyed his picturesque invective.
Andr&eacute;-Louis scarcely heard and certainly did not heed it.
His thoughts were leagues away, in the Bear Inn at Hamm, with his
Aline. How would she take the news of his end when it was borne to
her? She would suffer. That was inevitable. But he prayed that she
might not suffer too acutely, and that resignation and consolation
would follow soon. Later, perhaps, love might come to her again.
She might marry and be the happy mother of children. It was what he
must desire for her since he loved her. And yet the thought of it
seared his soul. She was so much his own that the contemplation of
her possible possession by another was intolerable. But for this he
might now be confronting his fate with a greater resignation.</p>

<p>His spirit sought to bridge the distance between them, to reach
her and make her aware of him. If only he could write to her: pack
into one final glowing letter all the passion and worship which he
had never yet expressed! But how was he from a revolutionary prison
to dispatch a letter to an aristocrat in exile? Even this little
consolation would be denied him. He must die without having told
her the half of his devotion.</p>

<p>He was roused from the anguish of these reflections by the
return of the usher.</p>

<p>With the opening of the door the Citizen Simon's grumblings
instantly ceased. This champion of equality shed the last vestige
of his magnificent independence when they entered the presence of
the president of the dread committee. Cringing a little, he waited
with exemplary patience while the neat, powdered head presented to
them continued bowed over the writing upon which its owner was
engaged.</p>

<p>In a silence broken only by the swift scratching of the writer's
pen, and the ticking of the Ormolu timepiece on the tall fluted
overmantel, they continued to wait. Even when the writing ceased,
and the president spoke at last, he did not look up. He continued
bowed over his table, which was covered by a claret-coloured serge
cloth reaching to the ground, and his eyes remained engaged upon
what he had written.</p>

<p>"What is this story of an attempt to procure the escape of the
Widow Capet from the Temple?"</p>

<p>The Citizen Simon began to speak. "May it please you,
Citizen-President," was the deferential opening with which he
introduced a tale in which he assigned himself a very noble part.
No false sense of modesty prevented him from making the fullest
parade of his acumen, intrepidity and burning patriotism. He was
still at the shrewdness of the inferences which had led to his
denunciation of Michonis when the president interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. I am informed of all that. Come to the business at
the Temple."</p>

<p>The Citizen Simon, flung out of balance by that hectoring
interruption, silently sought a fresh starting point. At last the
Citizen-President raised his head and confirmed the assumptions
Andr&eacute;-Louis had already formed from the voice, by disclosing
the narrow swarthy face and impertinent nose of Le Chapelier. But
it was a countenance oddly changed in the few months since
Andr&eacute;-Louis had last beheld it. It had lost flesh. The bone
structures were more prominent. A grey pallor overspread it. Lines
of care were deeply carved between the brows, and the eyes were the
eyes of a haunted man, strained and anxious. Andr&eacute;-Louis,
with pulses suddenly quickened, awaited an explosion. None came.
Beyond a momentary lift of his fine brows, so momentary that only
Andr&eacute;-Louis perceived it, Le Chapelier gave no sign of
recognition. Deliberately he levelled a gold-rimmed quizzing glass,
the better to survey the prisoner, and again his dry voice
spoke.</p>

<p>"Whom have you there?"</p>

<p>"But as I am telling you, Citizen-President, this is one of the
men who made possible the escape of that aristocrat scoundrel de
Batz. He had the impudence to declare himself an agent of the
Committee of Public Safety." And Simon pursued his tale of the
encounter in the Rue Charlot. But when it was done there was no
such panegyric as he was expecting and believed that he had earned;
there was not even a single word of commendation.</p>

<p>Instead, the president, ever impassive, asked a question, a
question that further quickened the prisoner's pulses.</p>

<p>"You say that this man proclaimed himself an agent of the
Committee of Public Safety. Did you take steps to verify that this
was not true?"</p>

<p>The Citizen Simon's mouth fell open. He stared foolishly. The
question was coldly repeated.</p>

<p>"Did you take steps to verify that the Citizen Moreau is not one
of our agents?"</p>

<p>Higher mounted the zealous patriot's amazement.</p>

<p>"You know his name, Citizen-President?"</p>

<p>"Answer my question."</p>

<p>"But...But..." The Citizen Simon was bewildered. He sensed here
something that was entirely wrong. He stammered, paused, then
plunged precipitatedly. "Why, this man is known to be a constant
associate of the ci-devant Baron de Batz, whom I have told you that
I surprised in the act of attempting to enter the Temple."</p>

<p>"That is not what I asked you," Le Chapelier's voice became of
an increasing asperity. "Do you know, citizen, that you do not
impress me very favourably. I have a low opinion of men who cannot
answer questions. It argues something amiss either with their
sagacity or their honesty."</p>

<p>"But, Citizen-President&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence! You will withdraw, and wait in the antechamber until I
send for you again. Take your men with you. Citizen Moreau, you
will remain." He tinkled a bell on his table.</p>

<p>Simon's ugly mouth was twisted in angry astonishment. But he
dared offer no answer to so definite an order from a despot
invested with the authority of that sacred trinity, liberty,
equality and fraternity.</p>

<p>The usher appeared, and Simon, scowling his chagrin, marched out
of the presence followed by his guards. The tall door closed again,
leaving Andr&eacute;-Louis and Le Chapelier alone together.</p>

<p>The deputy regarded the prisoner solemnly for some moments. Then
the thin lips smiled curiously.</p>

<p>"I heard some days ago that you were in Paris, Andr&eacute;. I
was wondering when you would have the politeness to pay me a
visit."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis met dryness with dryness.</p>

<p>"Acquit me of impoliteness, Isaac. I feared to intrude upon so
busy a man."</p>

<p>"I see. Well, you are here at last."</p>

<p>They continued to look at each other. Andr&eacute;-Louis found
the situation almost droll, but not very hopeful.</p>

<p>"Tell me," said Le Chapelier presently. "To what extent are you
involved with this de Batz?"</p>

<p>"He is a friend of mine."</p>

<p>"Not a very desirable friend in these days, especially for a man
of your history."</p>

<p>"Considering my history I am not perhaps a very desirable friend
for him."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not. But my concern is with you, now that you have had
the clumsiness to allow yourself to be taken. What the devil am I
to do with you?"</p>

<p>"I appreciate the concern, my dear Isaac. You will believe, I am
sure, that I am desolated to be the cause of it."</p>

<p>The president's myopic eyes considered him grimly.</p>

<p>"I have no difficulty in believing it. Fate, it seems, is
determined to fling us across each other's paths however we may
strive to travel in opposite directions. Tell me frankly,
Andr&eacute;. What is the truth of this business at the Temple last
night?"</p>

<p>"But how should I know? If you choose to believe the ridiculous
story of that foul dog who brought me here..."</p>

<p>"My difficulty is that belief in his story is not to be avoided.
And we want to avoid it; not only I, myself, but my colleagues on
the Committee of Public Safety. Your arrest gives it an awkward
measure of confirmation. You are extraordinarily inopportune,
Andr&eacute;."</p>

<p>"I make you my apologies, Isaac."</p>

<p>"Of course, I could have you quietly guillotined."</p>

<p>"I should prefer it to be done quietly if it must be done. I
have always deprecated ostentation."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately there's a debt between us."</p>

<p>"My dear Isaac! What is a debt between friends?"</p>

<p>"Shall we be serious?"</p>

<p>"If you can tell me of a more serious situation than mine you
will astonish me."</p>

<p>Le Chapelier made a movement of impatience. "You cannot suppose,
as you seem to be pretending, that I do not desire to help
you?"</p>

<p>"I have already perceived with gratitude indications of it. But
there must be a limit to your power in a State in which any
ragamuffin may dictate to a minister."</p>

<p>"One of these days, Scaramouche, you'll sacrifice your head for
a retort. At the moment you are luckier than you know. Probably
luckier than you deserve, not only in that chance brings you before
me instead of before the assembled committee, but because the
general situation demands that Simon's story should not be
believed. If you and your friends have been trying to rescue the
heretofore Queen, you have been uselessly endangering your necks.
I'll tell you a secret. Negotiations with Vienna are well advanced
to put her across the frontier in exchange for Bournonville and the
other deputies now in Austrian hands. Knowledge that an attempt has
been made to rescue her might inflame the populace and raise
obstacles to a desirable political measure. The tale of this
attempt to enter the Temple we could brush aside. But your arrest
creates a difficulty. There must be awkward disclosures when we put
you on your trial."</p>

<p>"I am desolated to prove so inconvenient."</p>

<p>Le Chapelier ignored the interruption. "On the other hand, if I
set you at liberty, we shall have that fellow Simon stirring up
trouble and denouncing us all as having been bought by Pitt and
Coburg."</p>

<p>"My poor Isaac! You appear to be upon the horns of a dilemma.
Your perplexities appropriate the sympathy I was reserving for
myself."</p>

<p>"Devil take you, Andr&eacute;!" Le Chapelier slapped the table
with his hand. "Will you cease to play Scaramouche, and show me
what I am to do?" He got up. "It is anything but easy. I am not the
committee, after all; and I shall have to render some account to my
colleagues. On what grounds can I let you go?"</p>

<p>He came forward and set a hand on Andr&eacute;-Louis' shoulder.
"Short of mounting the scaffold in your place, there is nothing I
will not do to save you."</p>

<p>"My dear Isaac!" This time there was no lightness in
Andr&eacute;-Louis' tone.</p>

<p>"You don't flatter me if it surprises you. There was that affair
at Coblentz."</p>

<p>"The cases are not by any means parallel. There I had no duty to
anyone, and I was consequently free to assist you. You,
unfortunately, are saddled with a duty to your office, which will
hardly&mdash;"</p>

<p>Le Chapelier interrupted him. "My office! Ha! My duty to that
wears thin, Andr&eacute;. Our revolution has taken a queer twist.
There are few of its original architects left. I might easily have
gone with the Girondins&mdash;the last of those who stood for
order."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis thought that he held the explanation of that
strained, haunted look which he had discovered on Le Chapelier's
face. The man must be sorely ridden indeed by misgivings and fears
to permit himself these expressions.</p>

<p>He took his hand from Andr&eacute;-Louis' shoulder, and paced
away, again to the table and back, his chin in his neckcloth, his
pallid brow furrowed by thought. Suddenly he checked to ask a
question.</p>

<p>"Will you accept service if I offer it to you?"</p>

<p>"Service?"</p>

<p>"It is at least to the good that you announced yourself to this
fellow Simon as an agent of the Committee of Public Safety."</p>

<p>"As an agent?" There was repudiation in the very tone of the
question.</p>

<p>"Does it shock you? Are you not already an agent of the
Bourbons? Is it unusual for agents to accept service from both
sides at once?" Le Chapelier spoke contemptuously. "I could explain
that I am setting you to watch the counter-revolutionaries, who
believe you to be one of themselves. Your service to me at Coblentz
was really a service to the revolutionary party. I published it in
committee on my return, and it will serve now as a guarantee of
your good faith. It would be readily believed that your presence
here, your association with certain counter-revolutionaries,
results from an arrangement made between us at Coblentz. Do you
understand?"</p>

<p>"Oh, perfectly. And I thank you." Andr&eacute;-Louis was
ironical. "But on the whole I think the guillotine will be
cleaner."</p>

<p>"I see that you don't understand at all. I am not asking you to
do anything more than accept enrolment. It is merely so as to
enable you to get away."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis frowned as he stared in surprise at the
other. "But you, Isaac? What then of you? If you sponsor me, and I
fail to perform the duties of the office; if I use it to make my
escape? What, then, of you?"</p>

<p>"Do not let that concern you."</p>

<p>"But it must. You will endanger your own neck."</p>

<p>Slowly Le Chapelier shook his head. He smiled with tight lips.
"I shall not be here to answer. I shall have ceased to count."
Instinctively he lowered his voice. "I am about to start for
England on a secret mission to Pitt, in an endeavour to detach the
English from the coalition. It is the last reputable service which
in the present pass a man of decency may render this unfortunate
country. When it is done, whether it succeeds or not, I do not
think that I shall return. For here," he added bitterly, "there
will be nothing more that an honest man can do. That is another
secret, Andr&eacute;. I disclose it, so that you may know precisely
what I offer."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis took only a moment to consider.</p>

<p>"In the circumstances, I should be worse than a fool if I
refused, or if I forgot to count myself lucky in your friendship,
Isaac."</p>

<p>Le Chapelier shrugged aside the commendation. "I pay my debts
where I can." He returned to his writing-table. "I have here your
civic card. I'll prepare your commission as an agent of the Public
Safety, and have it countersigned as soon as the committee sits,
which will be within the next two hours. You will wait in the
antechamber until I send it to you. Armed with it, you must protect
yourself." He held out his hand. "This time, Andr&eacute;, it is
good-bye, I think."</p>

<p>Their handclasp was firm, and it endured for a long moment,
during which they looked into each other's eyes. Then Le Chapelier
took up a bell from the table and tinkled it.</p>

<p>The usher came in. Le Chapelier, calm and dry of manner, gave
his instructions.</p>

<p>"The Citizen Moreau will await my orders in the antechambers.
Reconduct him, and send the Citizen Simon to me at once."</p>

<p>The bowlegged Simon, still deep in bewilderment, entered to
receive the belated thanks of the president of the Committee of
Public Safety for his diligence in the service of the Nation.
Instead he was offered a cold lecture upon the errors into which a
man may be led by acting with excessive zeal upon unreliable
information. He was assured that he had perpetrated a series of
blunders in the course of discovering a conspiracy which had never
existed, and in the pursuit of a conspirator who had never been
present, and he was warned that any further scaremongering on the
subject would be attended by the gravest consequences to
himself.</p>

<p>The Citizen Simon, going red and white by turns under that
incisive admonition, demanded at the end of it to know if he were
to reject the evidence of his own senses. There was a certain
feeble attempt at truculence in the posing of the question.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," the president answered him without hesitation,
"since those senses have proved so entirely unreliable. You have
maligned two valued servants of the Nation in the persons of
Michonis and Cortey, against whom you are unable to make good your
accusations, and you have assaulted yet another in the person of
the Citizen Moreau. These are grave matters, Citizen Simon. I will
remind you that we are no longer in the days of the despots when
the lives and liberties of men were at the mercy of any
functionary, and I recommend you in future to exercise more
circumspection. You are fortunate to be at liberty to go, Citizen
Simon."</p>

<p>The ardent champion of liberty, equality and fraternity stumbled
out of the room as if he had been bludgeoned.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX - MAMMON</h2>

<p>An ironical spice is added to the facts when it is considered
how few were the hours that elapsed between the departure of
Monsieur de Lang&eacute;ac from Charonne to bear the news of
Moreau's end to Hamm, and the arrival at Charonne of Monsieur
Moreau himself, and how narrow was the margin of time by which so
much of what followed might have been averted.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Lang&eacute;ac had set out provided with a forged
passport which was the competent work of Balthazar Roussel, whose
accomplishments in penmanship, engraving and other kindred arts
rendered him one of the most valuable members of the Baron's little
army of underground workers. It was Balthazar Roussel who was
responsible for the activities of the little printing-press
installed in a cellar of that country house at Charonne, which
provided by far the most perfect of all the false paper money of
the Republic with which France was flooded to the embarrassment of
the government and the constant depreciation of the currency. That,
however, is by the way.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Lang&eacute;ac had been gone not more than six
hours, and the June twilight was deepening when to that quiet,
lonely house at Charonne came at last Andr&eacute;-Louis Moreau
whom they were mourning.</p>

<p>They were assembled&mdash;de Batz, Devaux, Boissancourt, Roussel
and the Marquis de la Guiche&mdash;in the library: a long, low
chamber, communicating with the dining-room, and with windows
opening upon the lawn, beyond which rose the trees of the woods of
Bagnolet. They sat there in the gloaming with few words passing, a
little band of men too dejected and depressed by failure to address
themselves to the conception of any future plans.</p>

<p>Babette de Grandmaison came in to light the candles and draw the
curtains.</p>

<p>She had scarcely completed the task, when the door opened
abruptly, and Andr&eacute;-Louis, hat in hand, appeared upon the
threshold. There was a general gasp, a moment's astonished pause,
then a sudden rising, and Babette ran to fling her arms about the
newcomer's neck, kissing him resonantly on one cheek after the
other.</p>

<p>"This is to make sure that he is not a ghost," she informed the
company.</p>

<p>The Baron was wringing Andr&eacute;-Louis' hand as if he would
tear it from the wrist, his dark eyes preternaturally bright. He
was dragged forward, bombarded with questions, laughed over, almost
wept over, by those men whose gloom had been suddenly cast off.</p>

<p>He explained his escape, made possible by his old friend and
associate Le Chapelier, and by the fortunate circumstance that the
Committee of Public Safety desired no publication of any attempt to
rescue the Queen. They were consoled for their failure when they
learnt that her deliverance was as good as assured without any
exertion of their own. But there were reticences on both sides.
Andr&eacute;-Louis said nothing of his enrolment as an agent of the
Committee of Public Safety; this chiefly because he attached no
importance to it. De Batz, on his side, in deploring now that
Lang&eacute;ac should already have set out for Hamm, said nothing
of the conviction in which he had departed. But even as it was that
departure was sufficiently alarming to Andr&eacute;-Louis.</p>

<p>"He will inform them that I have been arrested!"</p>

<p>And upon that he vowed that unless a messenger could be found
upon the morrow who would so ride as to reach Hamm, if possible,
ahead of Lang&eacute;ac, he would set out himself to return to
Westphalia.</p>

<p>From this it followed that early next morning de Batz
accompanied him to Paris, in quest of the necessary messenger. They
began by paying a visit to Pommelles at Bourg
Egalit&eacute;&mdash;the old Bourg la Reine&mdash;and here,
providentially, as it seemed, they found a courier from d'Entragues
on the point of setting out to return to Hamm. His departure was
delayed no longer than it took Andr&eacute;-Louis to write a letter
to reassure Aline and his godfather on the subject of his fate.</p>

<p>This done, he remained with de Batz in Paris, so as to keep an
appointment on the morrow with the Representative Delaunay, at the
house of Benoit the banker. They could address themselves with a
better spirit to the major project with which this appointment was
concerned since the news Andr&eacute;-Louis had brought of the
government's intentions towards the Queen relieved de Batz of the
dejection consequent upon his failure. Delaunay came to the
appointment accompanied by yet another conventional named Julien, a
tall, dry man with a narrow, yellow face and sly eyes, an erstwhile
Protestant minister who had unfrocked himself and renounced the
faith so that he might exchange religion for politics. Delaunay had
by now entirely overcome any scruples about availing himself of the
advantages of his position in the government offered. And Julien,
who represented Toulouse in the Convention, had attached himself to
Delaunay in the hope of participating in the operations by which
the deputy for Angers was to enrich himself.</p>

<p>These hopes, however, received from Andr&eacute;-Louis, to the
general surprise, a check at the very outset of their interview. He
made difficulties. He pointed out to the conventionals a danger in
discovery.</p>

<p>"An enemy who seeks your ruin," he warned them, "might charge
you with peculation. And in these days, with suspicion in the very
air we breathe, an impeachment of your probity might easily
succeed, even if without foundation."</p>

<p>Taken aback, they demanded to know who need ever discover their
share in these transactions.</p>

<p>"You will grow rich," Andr&eacute;-Louis replied. "The source of
your wealth may be called in question."</p>

<p>"But by whom, in God's name?" cried Julien, galled to see wealth
within his reach and yet to be counselled against seizing it.</p>

<p>"By those who have the right. Your fellow conventionals, who
will be in prey to the envy you will excite. That is the risk you
will run."</p>

<p>Delaunay brushed the difficulty aside. A man in love, he was
reckless and impatient of obstacles between himself and the object
of his desires.</p>

<p>"Nothing is ever accomplished without risks."</p>

<p>The portly florid banker listened in mild bewilderment. De Batz
himself, without yet perceiving Andr&eacute;-Louis' aim, remained
impassive, even when the young man's next words served further to
daunt the allies it was desired to win.</p>

<p>"You are right, of course, citizen. But in your place I should
take every precaution before setting out upon a road which, without
them, may lead to the guillotine."</p>

<p>Julien shivered, and wrung one bony hand in the other. "Ah,
that, no! Name of God! If that's the risk&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait," growled Delaunay to silence him. "You speak of
precautions, Citizen Moreau. You have something in mind, that's
plain. Of what precautions are you thinking?"</p>

<p>"Were I in your place I know exactly what I should do. I should
begin by associating with myself in these operations some of the
more prominent men in the party of the Mountain, which to-day is
the only party that counts. I should make choice of some man well
in the public eye; some man who stands so high in public favour,
whose virtue is so well-established that he is unassailable; a man,
in short, whom it would be perilous to attack because scandal
against him would recoil upon the heads of those that utter it.
Such a man, whilst safe in himself by virtue of his unimpeachable
position, would render you safe by your association with him."</p>

<p>The incipient despondency of the two deputies began to lift.
Whilst Delaunay was thoughtfully nodding, Julien inquired bluntly
whether the Citizen Moreau had anyone in mind. The Citizen Moreau,
a trifle dubiously, named Robespierre, who was now virtually the
leader of the Mountain and whose star was rapidly ascending to its
zenith in the revolutionary firmament.</p>

<p>Delaunay laughed with a touch of scorn. "Morbleu! If we could
bring in Robespierre we should be safe indeed. But Robespierre! My
friend, you do not know the man. He is afraid of money. It is not
for nothing that they call him the Incorruptible. He is hardly
normal in his tastes. He is just a vanity in human shape. His only
appetite is for power. That he will achieve by any means, or perish
in the attempt. But apart from that he is purity itself. If I were
to show him how he might enrich himself, his almost certain answer
would be to impeach me for peculation before the revolutionary
tribunal, and send me to the guillotine. No, no, my friend. We can
leave out Robespierre."</p>

<p>"There is Danton," Julien suggested, tentatively. "No one can
pretend that his hands are clean in money matters. He is becoming a
considerable landowner, I am told; and there is little doubt that
he and his friend Fabre have been dipping their fingers into the
national treasury."</p>

<p>But Andr&eacute;-Louis would have neither one nor the other.</p>

<p>"They are already tainted, and, therefore, vulnerable. Your
need, citizens, demands men of spotless purity in money matters.
That is why I named Robespierre&mdash;"</p>

<p>Delaunay attempted impatiently to interrupt him. "But
Robespierre&mdash;"</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis held up his lean hand. "You have made me
realize that Robespierre is unapproachable. But consider him a
moment with me. Neither of you was in the Constituent Assembly, of
which I was a member, representing Ancenis. I remember the deputy
for the Third Estate of Arras from those days: an insignificant
little pedant, who gave himself airs, who very occasionally was
permitted to address the Assembly, and almost invariably sent it to
sleep by his dullness when he did so. In himself and left to
himself, Robespierre would never have become anything. Bumptious,
maladroit and tiresome, he would never have done more than weary
people. You agree with me, I hope."</p>

<p>The deputies remained stolid before this frankness of criticism
of one who since the fall of the Girondins had fast been rising to
the first place in the Convention. Andr&eacute;-Louis
continued.</p>

<p>"He has risen to the position he occupies as a result of the
efforts of his friends. Saint-Just sees God in him, or at least the
high-priest of such a divinity as Saint-Just desires to worship,
and it is Saint-Just's clear eloquence which mends Robespierre's
paucity of expression for ideas admittedly his own. Couthon is such
another champion. Basire another. Chabot another. You know them,
these pillars upon which Robespierre is supported. It is amongst
them that you must look for your associate. For if trouble followed
Robespierre would assuredly rise to protect any of these supporters
upon whom, for all his vanity, he knows that his own position is
dependent."</p>

<p>Convinced, they proceeded to pass them in review. Saint-Just, of
course, was the first whose qualifications they weighed. That
terrible young man, however, seemed invulnerable. Considering his
closeness to Robespierre, it was assumed that he might at present
share Robespierre's fear of money. Next, the cripple Couthon, with
his magnificent head and useless legs, seemed hardly a likely
subject for temptation. Basire was mentioned, and about Basire they
debated for some time, until at last Andr&eacute;-Louis, who knew
exactly what he wanted, urged Fran&ccedil;ois Chabot.</p>

<p>An unfrocked capuchin of appalling antecedents, Fran&ccedil;ois
Chabot was to such an extent the victim of two passions, women and
money, that Delaunay was of the opinion that in the pursuit of
either only his natural cowardice would deter him.</p>

<p>"The temptation," said Andr&eacute;-Louis, "must be made heavy
enough to counterbalance his fears."</p>

<p>The masks were off by now, and they were talking with the utmost
frankness. Andr&eacute;-Louis continued to expound.</p>

<p>"It is worth an effort to win Chabot. He stands high in the
councils of the Mountain. He stands higher still in the esteem of
the people. As a patriot his zeal has been shown to amount to
fanaticism. It was he who discovered the Austrian Committee, which,
as everybody knows, never existed at all. It was his denunciations
which helped to overthrow the Girondins. Next to Marat there is no
man in public life to-day whom the rabble worships more completely;
and to one who depends as Robespierre does upon the people's
favour, Chabot is an inestimable ally since he commands it. Bring
Chabot into these operations, whether concerned with speculation in
&eacute;migr&eacute; property, whether covering a still wider
field, and you may pursue them without fear of denunciation, if
only because the arch-denouncer will be your ally. Bring in Basire
as well by all means. But spare no effort to win Fran&ccedil;ois
Chabot."</p>

<p>And so it was agreed that his brother deputies should bring
Chabot to dine at Charonne one day soon, so that he might be
enmeshed in the viscous net that Andr&eacute;-Louis was preparing
for them all.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI - THE TEMPTING OF CHABOT</h2>

<p>Delaunay's impatience would brook no postponement of that
excursion to Charonne beyond the following D&eacute;cadi, the
Republican Sunday&mdash;for the Revolutionary Calendar, which
divided the week into ten days, the month into three weeks and the
year into twelve months, had by now been adopted. So, on the next
D&eacute;cadi, three days later, the two deputies and the banker
drove out to Charonne, taking with them that stalwart champion of
the Mountain, Fran&ccedil;ois Chabot, who represented the
department of Loir-et-Cher in the National Convention.</p>

<p>They dined early in the afternoon, in the garden, just the six
of them, with the Citoyenne Grandmaison to do the honours of the
table as hostess. La Guiche, Roussel and the others had temporarily
effaced themselves. Under the lime trees, from which the ardent
June sun was drawing the fragrance, a feast was spread with
abundance of choice wines to which the deputies did the fullest
justice.</p>

<p>Fran&ccedil;ois Chabot, now in his thirty-fifth year, was a
stiffly-built, vigorous little man with a lively, good-humoured
face that was fairly full in the cheeks. His nose was
disproportionately large, and made a line with his deplorable brow
which sloped away to be lost in a mass of brown curls. He had the
full lips of the sensualist and a prominent chin in which there was
a dimple. His eyes were good, and in their seeming alertness
simulated an intelligence altogether greater than that which lay
behind them. In dress he observed a patriotic and unclean
slovenliness; his clustering brown curls were ill-kempt, and
generally he did not suggest that soap and water played any
considerable part in his daily habits. In manners as in appearance
he was gross and uncouth, betraying constantly his plebeian
origin.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he was unquestionably a great man in the State, and
he seemed destined for yet further greatness. His popularity dated
back to the moment when he had discarded the capuchin habit so
impatiently worn for fifteen years, so that he might assume instead
the tricolour cockade and procure election to the Legislative
Assembly. No gesture could have been more symbolical of the
casting-off of the trammels of superstition, or could more sharply
and favourably have drawn attention to him. Of this he had known
how to take the fullest advantage. Eyes and ears were not turned in
vain upon the new deputy. His commonplace mind imposed no
restraints upon his use of the turgid eloquence that emotionally
sweeps the rabble off its feet. And then the ardent patriotism
revealed in his denunciations! He was a very sleuth-hound of
republicanism on the trail of every aristocratic or
counter-revolutionary activity.</p>

<p>Few orators occupied the tribune as frequently, both in the
Convention and the clubs. He discovered plot after plot, most of
which had no real existence, and if there were some in the
Convention who sneered at him and his interminable fiery
denunciations, yet his popularity with the mob rose ever higher, so
that even those who sneered were compelled to recognize him for a
power in the land, to be ranked among the half-dozen men at most to
whom the Nation looked for leadership.</p>

<p>The rugged, downright Danton made the mistake of despising him,
stigmatizing his denunciations as capucinades, in contemptuous
allusion to his conventual antecedents. This merely had the effect
of ranging Chabot entirely on the side of Robespierre in the great
struggle for mastery that was just beginning.</p>

<p>At the moment he came fresh from the triumph of his latest
denunciation which had been hurled at the Deputy Condorcet's
criticisms of the new constitution. Together with this, Chabot had
announced the discovery of the latest conspiracy against the State
in which he had implicated several prominent men. If there were
still in the Convention some who were daring enough to deride his
accusations, yet such was his authority that the seals had been
placed, by his demand, upon the private papers of three whom he
denounced.</p>

<p>After these labours, the deputy for Loir-et-Cher may have felt
that he owed himself a little relaxation. Delaunay's suggestion
that they should spend a day in the country, at a house where a
good table was kept with a charming hostess to preside over it,
came opportunely.</p>

<p>Delaunay had understated the case when he attributed only two
passions to Chabot. The capuchin's starved youth had left him a
sensualist in every direction. He loved good food and good wine as
much as he loved all the other pleasures of the flesh. Indeed, his
history justifies us in describing him as a glutton and a drunkard.
These proclivities he could rarely indulge save at other men's
tables, for despite his avidity for money he remained poor. He had
never discovered how money could be made, so ingenuous was he in
matters of finance; and it had never yet occurred to him that ways
of enriching himself were ready to the hand of a man who had
climbed to his position.</p>

<p>These omissions in the ex-capuchin's education were to be
repaired by Andr&eacute;-Louis under the limes in the garden at
Charonne. They had plied him steadily with wine, and added to it
the intoxication of skilful flattery, until the man's wits were
addled. He had grown increasingly voluble, and increasingly at ease
in his manners. He had addressed himself with an ever-growing
familiarity to the handsome Babette, and he was ogling her fondly
when the repast, being ended, she rose to withdraw. Protesting
against her departure, he rose with her, seized her about the waist
and sought to compel her to sit down again. In the struggle he even
kissed her, and there was a moment when Delaunay, aware of the
relations between de Batz and the lady, was afraid that the
lecherous capuchin would not only ruin their hopes, but himself
come to grief. The blood, indeed, was rising to the Gascon's
swarthy face when a kick and a wink from Andr&eacute;-Louis
recalled to him the need for prudence.</p>

<p>The dark, queenly Babette, meanwhile, played her difficult part
with skill. Dissembling her disgust at the uncouth deputy's too
physical attentions, she laughed lightly, almost coquettishly, as
she disengaged herself. With a promise to return so soon as the
household duties claiming her would permit, she tripped away across
the lawn.</p>

<p>Chabot was disposing himself to go in pursuit of her, when the
massive Delaunay heaved himself up, took the ex-capuchin by the
shoulders, and almost flung him down again on his chair.</p>

<p>"A little circumspection, name of a name," the Augevin growled
at him.</p>

<p>Chabot, almost winded by the violence, sat still. Only his
smouldering eyes followed the graceful figure as it moved across
the lawn to the long, low white house with its green shutters. He
was a little aggrieved. There had been a distinct implication in
Delaunay's mention of a charming hostess. Charming Chabot had
certainly found her. But surely of an excessive coyness, an utterly
unnecessary aloofness.</p>

<p>To create a diversion, de Batz poured wine for him. The deputy
fetched a sigh, and sipped it appreciatively, taking from it what
compensation he could for other joys which it seemed were to elude
him. And then at last, with some abruptness the conversation turned
on money. It was Benoit, the banker, who was also of the party who
tossed that ball among these players.</p>

<p>"Morbleu, de Batz," he said, "that last operation of yours must
have brought you in at least a hundred thousand francs."</p>

<p>Chabot, in the act of drinking, almost choked. A hundred
thousand francs! God of God! Were there such sums to be made? But
how? He was asking these questions almost before he knew it, and
Andr&eacute;-Louis was laughing as he answered him.</p>

<p>"On my soul, will you affect ingenuousness,
Citizen-Representative? Is it for a man of your eminence in the
State, a man of your influence and power to ask such a question?
For a hundred thousand livres that de Batz may make as a result of
infinite pain and labour, there's a million to be picked up without
effort by a man in your position."</p>

<p>Chabot's eyes held a look that was almost of consternation.</p>

<p>"If there is, I should be glad to know more precisely where. I
would so, by God!" He turned upon Benoit. "You, who are a banker, a
man who makes money by money, though God knows how, what have you
to say to that?"</p>

<p>Benoit explained to him the transactions in confiscated property
which could be rendered so profitable. A man in Chabot's position
would be among the first to know what was to be bought and what
margin of profit it would leave.</p>

<p>Chabot was shocked. "You mean, citizen, that I am to abuse the
position which by the people's trust and faith in me I am permitted
to occupy?" He grew stern. "Will you tell me how I could justify
myself before the tribunal of my conscience?"</p>

<p>"What justification does a man need who has done no harm?" quoth
Andr&eacute;-Louis.</p>

<p>"No harm?"</p>

<p>"It must be a surviving impression from your monastic days,
citizen, that there is harm in taking profit to yourself. One of
the superstitions of a worn-out and discarded kill-joy creed."</p>

<p>Chabot passed from amazement to amazement. "But...But
surely...The profit to myself, whence comes it? Is it not filched
from the sacred treasury of the republic? Is not that to commit a
sacrilege? Is it not a robbing of the inviolable altars of the
nation?"</p>

<p>Gently smiling, Andr&eacute;-Louis shook his head. He became
apostrophic. "Oh, virtuous excess of sensitiveness! What a
thrice-blessed age is this in which we live, that men of State,
departing from the corrupt habits of their kind in all ages, should
hesitate to appropriate even that which rightly belongs to them.
Citizen Chabot, I honour you for this hesitation as all men must
honour you. But at the same time I grieve that such lofty ideals
should give you so false a perspective of the facts; should make
you neglect to reach for those rewards which are your right, which
your labours in the cause of freedom have justly earned you. I
should grieve even more deeply if as a consequence of your neglect
of opportunity this wealth should be appropriated by the worthless,
by the hucksters and even by the friends of despotism, whilst you
and your noble kind continue to labour in necessitous
circumstances, almost in want. Will you allow these profits,
citizen, which you could spend so worthily to the great honour and
glory of the sacred cause of liberty, to fall instead into the
hands of corrupt reactionaries who may employ them to undermine the
very foundations of this glorious republic you have laboured with
such self-abnegation to establish? Have you no duty there,
Citizen-Representative?"</p>

<p>The Citizen-Representative blinked at him helplessly.</p>

<p>That flood of turgid rhetoric, of the very kind of which he
himself was so remarkable an exponent, which meaning nothing
explicitly yet seemed implicit with so much significance, befogged
the wits which the wine had already rendered torpid. Through this
fog gleamed with increasing vividness the prospect of riches whose
acquisition would not affront his sensitive conscience
or&mdash;which is really the same thing at bottom&mdash;imperil his
position.</p>

<p>The others maintained an impassive silence. Julien almost shared
Chabot's stupefaction, bewildered by the specious cant which
Andr&eacute;-Louis employed. Delaunay, more clear-sighted, was
under no illusions, whilst Benoit and de Batz silently admired both
the manner and the matter of Andr&eacute;-Louis' retort to the
deputy's cry of conscience.</p>

<p>"You mean, citizen?" said Chabot at last. "You mean that if I do
not take advantage of these opportunities, others will who might
turn the results to evil purposes?"</p>

<p>"I mean much more than that. These operations ensure a ready
liquidation of the confiscated properties with immediate returns to
the national treasury. What we do, we do openly. There is no stigma
attaching to it. The commission entrusted with the sale of lands
welcomes our collaboration, without which those sales would be
immensely retarded. If then it is not wrong in us, if, indeed, it
is considered right in us, can it be less right in you, who are so
fully entitled to rewards and have so little opportunity of
obtaining them in ordinary ways?"</p>

<p>This was a little clearer. It removed satisfactorily the
substance of Chabot's opposition. But the shadow remained.</p>

<p>"That is well for you, citizens," he answered slowly. "The place
you occupy does not leave you vulnerable to such reproaches as
might be aimed at me. It might be said, my enemies might make it
appear, that I turn my position to my own private benefit. My
purity of intention would thus become suspect, and under such
suspicion I should no longer be in case to serve my country."</p>

<p>"That is true. Men whose first aim is the service of mankind are
peculiarly susceptible to such attacks. Suspicion can wither your
powers, the breath of calumny can wilt your forces and lay low your
every noble endeavour. But before suspicion or calumny can touch
you, some knowledge of the facts must transpire. And what need any
know of your transactions?"</p>

<p>Chabot blinked again under his interlocutor's steady regard.
Excitement had drawn the blood from his round cheeks. He drained a
bumper that once more de Batz had filled for him, and wiped his
mouth with the back of his unclean hand.</p>

<p>"You mean that a thing done in secret..."</p>

<p>"Name of a name! Is a man to go through life opening the
recesses of his heart to the gaze of the multitude? Are
you&mdash;is any man&mdash;under the necessity of putting weapons
into the hands of his enemies? You have spoken, citizen, of the
tribunal of conscience. A noble image. So long as that is
satisfied, are you to trouble about anything else?"</p>

<p>Chabot took his head in his hand, leaning his elbow on the
table. "But if I grow rich..." He paused. The golden vision dazzled
him. He looked back on the grey, needy years, spent in a poverty
which had denied him all those lovely things of life which he knew
himself peculiarly equipped to enjoy. He thought of occasional
banquets to which he had been bidden, even such as this at which he
had just been a guest, and contrasted it with the lean fare to
which he was normally condemned by his restricted means, he, a man
of State, a power in France, one of the pillars of this glorious
republic which he had helped to found. Surely some reward was due
to him. Yet timidity made him hesitate. If he grew rich how was he
to enjoy his riches, how spread himself such tables, guzzle such
wines, command such mistresses as dark-eyed Babette who had
presided here, without betraying this improvement in his fortunes?
Something of the kind he expressed, to be promptly answered by
instances of other deputies, from Danton down, who had obviously
accumulated wealth without anyone daring to question its
sources.</p>

<p>"And these sources," said Andr&eacute;-Louis impressively, "are
far from being as pure and untainted as those which we reveal to
you."</p>

<p>A sudden suspicion flared in Chabot to stay him in the very
moment of surrender to these almost irresistible seductions.</p>

<p>"Why do you reveal them? What is your interest in me that you
should come to empty Fortune's cornucopia into my lap?"</p>

<p>It was de Batz who answered him, laughing frankly. "Faith, the
reason is not far to seek. We are not altruists,
Citizen-Representative. We desire your valuable company. We lead
you to the source. But we remain to drink at it with you. Am I
plain?"</p>

<p>"Ah! I begin to see. But then..." He hiccoughed. "Faith! I do
not yet see quite clearly."</p>

<p>Delaunay addressed himself to enlightening him. "Should I be in
this, Fran&ccedil;ois, if I perceived in it the least shade of
dishonesty? You are a man of ideals, and you have rarely been in
close contact with that greatest of realities, money. I am a man
experienced in finance. You may take my word for it that all here
is beyond reproach."</p>

<p>Dull eyes regarded him in silence from the deputy's flushed
face. Delaunay continued.</p>

<p>"Consider it this way: the only real sufferers in these
transactions are the &eacute;migr&eacute;s, who have crossed the
frontier so that they may make war upon the country that gave them
birth. It is their properties that are to be converted into gold so
that the hungry children of France may be fed. Our intervention in
these transactions will not lessen by a single hard the sums to be
poured into the national treasury. On the contrary, by accelerating
the liquidation we do good service to the people."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have perceived that," Chabot admitted, but still with a
lack of conviction, still fettered by timidity.</p>

<p>He fell into thought, and presently loosed his
retrospections.</p>

<p>"I have been rigorously bound by my scruples in the past. No
representative has gone upon more missions than have I, and in each
of them I could have made money had I not set my probity above all
else. At Castries I was entrusted with four thousand livres for
secret expenses, and I collected some twenty thousand livres in
fines and ransoms. Not a denier of this found its way into my
pockets. My hands have remained clean. And these are trifles
compared with other temptations that have come my way. The Spanish
minister offered me four millions if I would save Louis Capet from
the scaffold. It was a bribe that would have overwhelmed the
honesty of many a man. But strong in my patriotism and my sense of
duty to the Nation, the temptation never touched me."</p>

<p>It may have been true. But it still remained that the temptation
must have lacked point, since Chabot could not have accomplished
what was required. As well might the Spanish minister have offered
Chabot four millions for the moon.</p>

<p>"Your proposal, however," the representative ran on, "is of a
different order. I begin to see that in the manner you suggest I
might make a little money honestly. I have made, I confess, a
little in the past, a very little, by the favour of two good
friends of mine, those good fellows the brothers Frey. And they
have reproached me with having neglected my opportunities to make
more."</p>

<p>He ran on, parading his honesty and the strength with which in
the past he had resisted temptation. And he spoke at length of the
Freys, whose very adopted name implied as he pointed out their
patriotism and shining republicanism. Their original name was
Sch&ouml;nfeld. But they had discarded this when they had left
Vienna, quitting it because with the sentiments that inspired them
they could live no longer under a rule of despotism. The elder
brother, Junius, who so called himself after the founder of Roman
liberty, had refused the office of first minister to the Emperor
Joseph because he would not bend the knee to a tyrant. These were
men who had given proof of their idealism, abandoning wealth and
position, so as to come and live in the pure air of liberty in
France. They had been good friends to Chabot, and but for his
scruples might have been still better. They were skilled in
finance, being bankers by profession. He would take counsel with
them before he made a final decision in this matter in which he was
now invited to co-operate.</p>

<p>If this was a little disappointing to those schemers who had so
richly fed the ex-capuchin and so generously plied him with wine,
yet they could offer no further insistence without arousing
suspicions that might completely scare away so timid a quarry.</p>

<p>And then, even as he was disposing himself to depart, Chabot was
assailed by yet another doubt.</p>

<p>"After all, citizens, I was overlooking in my ignorance of
finance the fact that to make money in the ways you indicate, money
is necessary at the outset. And I have no money."</p>

<p>De Batz made short work of that difficulty. He cried out on a
note of protest: "Citizen-Representative! Can you conceive that a
man of your shining merits should lack friends to advance you what
capital may be necessary?"</p>

<p>Chabot looked at him, his glance a trifle unsteady.</p>

<p>"You mean that the Freys..."</p>

<p>"The Freys! I am not thinking of the Freys. I am thinking of
myself. If you associate yourself with us, it is but proper that I
should provide the necessary initial funds. You may draw on me, my
friend. I am here to serve you."</p>

<p>The wavering gaze of the representative continued to consider
the Baron.</p>

<p>"That would remove a difficulty," he admitted. "Well, well,
we'll talk of this again after I have taken counsel with Junius
Frey."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII - BRIBERY</h2>

<p>"Will you tell me," Andr&eacute;-Louis begged de Batz, "who, in
the name of Heaven, are these Freys, whom the unspeakable Chabot
has dragged so abruptly upon the scene, and by whose opinions he
sets such store?"</p>

<p>He sat once more under the limes, alone now with de Batz, at the
table still littered with the remains of the banquet spread for the
departed guests.</p>

<p>De Batz tapped his snuff-box and supplied the information.</p>

<p>"The brothers Frey were a pair of Austrian or Polish Jews,
bankers by trade, who had come to establish themselves in Paris
under a pretence of ardent republicanism, no doubt in the hope of
enriching themselves out of the general disorder. It was a proof of
courage. Their change of name is a part of their pretence. The
rest: the honours and the millions sacrificed, the confidence of
the Emperor, and the like, were just so many spurious trappings.
They haunted the clubs, particularly the Jacobins, and also the
Convention. They have known how to make friends among the members
of the Convention, and Lebrun, the Minister for Foreign Affairs,
was known to protect these scoundrels."</p>

<p>De Batz further informed him that with them lodged a fellow
named Proly, who, to the Baron's knowledge, was a spy in the pay of
Austria. This, at least, was definite enough for
Andr&eacute;-Louis. "That should enable us to absorb these Freys.
It becomes necessary since they influence Chabot."</p>

<p>On the morrow he dragged the Baron back to Paris and the Rue de
M&eacute;nars, despite the Baron's reluctance to return just
yet.</p>

<p>Within two hours of their arrival, this reluctance seemed more
than justified by a visit from the Municipal Burlandeux, who had
evidently kept the house under observation.</p>

<p>The burly officer swept aside Biret-Tissot, who opened the door
to him, announced truculently that he would be put off by no lies,
and swaggered insolently into the Baron's presence. He did not even
trouble to remove the great cocked hat that covered him.</p>

<p>"So, my cockerel, you've come back to your roost, eh? I've a
notion that the president of the Section will be glad to see you,
and will have a question or two to ask you."</p>

<p>De Batz contained himself almost with difficulty. "And the
subject, if you please?"</p>

<p>The municipal laughed coarsely. "Oh, ho! You play the innocent.
You have no suspicion, of course. You'll have no recollection of
having been at the Temple some nights ago."</p>

<p>De Batz shook his head. "I have not."</p>

<p>"And you never heard of an attempt to rescue the woman
Antoinette from her prison, I suppose?"</p>

<p>The Baron took time to answer, regarding him steadily the while.
"Now I know you for an impostor. It has been established by the
Committee of Public Safety that no such attempt was made, and
certainly the president of your Section never sent you to me on any
errand concerned with that."</p>

<p>"Ah! Very sure of yourself, are you not, Citizen Aristocrat? If
you were to step round to the headquarters of the Section with me,
we might persuade you that we are not so easily fooled, we other
sansculottes."</p>

<p>"Unless you quit my premises immediately, you may find me
stepping round to the Section on a very different errand, my
friend. Come now. Be off! I've no time to waste on you or your
kind."</p>

<p>"My kind!" The municipal's voice shrilled up in anger. "My kind!
Why, you damned aristocrat, what kind is mine? I'll tell you, name
of a name! It's the kind that sends your kind to the national
barber. I know enough about you to bring your head into the basket.
You can show off your airs and graces to Charlot when I've done
with you."</p>

<p>The door opened behind him. Andr&eacute;-Louis, attracted by
that storming voice, stepped quietly into the room. The municipal
wheeled sharply at the sound. Andr&eacute;-Louis' face was
solemn.</p>

<p>"That was an ill-omened name you mentioned, citizen. It is not
well to speak so familiarly of the executioner of Paris. It is
unlucky, my good Burlandeux."</p>

<p>"So it is. So it will be&mdash;for both of you, by God!"</p>

<p>"An idle oath. The Convention has abolished God. But why must
you persecute us, who have done you no harm, and might do you much
good?"</p>

<p>"Good? You do me good! I should like to see the good that you
can do me."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis preserved his gentleness. "Should you not
account it good to receive a hundred louis?"</p>

<p>Insult was arrested on the sansculotte's coarse lips. They
parted in astonishment. He stared a moment.</p>

<p>"A hundred louis!" Then he resumed with an increase of fury.
"Ah, that! Now I understand! You want to bribe me. You think a true
patriot is to be seduced by bribes. But not for two hundred
<i>louis</i> would I be false to my sacred duty."</p>

<p>"Let us say three hundred, then."</p>

<p>Burlandeux stood paralysed.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis became insinuating. "Oh, and not as a bribe.
We know how idle it is to seek to corrupt a true sansculotte such
as yourself, Burlandeux. It is just a little gift, a little earnest
of our appreciation of your friendship, a proof, indeed, of the
republican honesty of our own sentiments, which should set all your
doubts at rest."</p>

<p>"Fine words!" said Burlandeux hoarsely. "Fine words. But for
what, then, do you pay me, name of...?"</p>

<p>"We do not pay you. Let me explain. The Citizen Batz and I are
financiers, engaged in operations which you would hardly
understand. Arrests and the like upon suspicions, however
unfounded, are embarrassing to us. Whilst they cannot harm us
further, since we are really good patriots, yet they destroy our
credit and hamper us in several ways. To avoid interference it is
proper that we should share with patriots of established character
some portion of the profits we look to make. To you, Citizen
Burlandeux, as I have said, we are prepared to entrust three
hundred <i>louis</i> for distribution as you think fit. No doubt
you will be able to do much good with it."</p>

<p>Burlandeux looked from one to the other of them.
Andr&eacute;-Louis smiled ingratiatingly. The Baron was impassive.
He scarcely approved; yet he allowed Andr&eacute;-Louis to have his
way. The municipal did not reply immediately. His big chin sunk
into his unclean neck-cloth, he considered rather than combated the
temptation. He perceived that these aristocrats or foreign agents,
or whatever they might be, could be turned into milk-cows for his
profit. When he had drained these rascals, bled them white, it
would still be time to do his duty by the nation and fling them to
the headsman. Thus, with a conscience at ease, and with some
profanity, he assented.</p>

<p>De Batz, still reluctant, took at Andr&eacute;-Louis' request a
bundle of assignats from the drawer of a cabinet in that
daintily-appointed room, and counted off the sum agreed.</p>

<p>Burlandeux's eyes gleamed. As he pocketed them, he laughed.</p>

<p>"This is indeed a proof of patriotism, citizens. Count
Burlandeux your friend. And the friendship of Burlandeux&mdash;name
of God!&mdash;is a stout buckler in these uneasy days."</p>

<p>Not until he had gone did the Baron utter a word of
remonstrance.</p>

<p>"What purpose is there in this waste?"</p>

<p>"Waste? You didn't give him good ones, did you?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. But even so I don't distribute false assignats
quite so freely. We shall never now be rid of that scoundrel."</p>

<p>"So he reckons?" Andr&eacute;-Louis smiled. "Wait here until I
return. I will not keep you long."</p>

<p>He sought his hat, and departed without further explanations. He
walked briskly by way of the Feuillants and the Tuileries Gardens
to the Pavilion de Flore. Here he was informed that the Committee
of Public Safety was not sitting, but that the secretary of the
committee was in his office. Andr&eacute;-Louis desired to be
conducted to him.</p>

<p>The Citizen S&eacute;nard, one of the most valuable agents in
the pay of de Batz, was already acquainted with
Andr&eacute;-Louis.</p>

<p>A slight, sallow man, with a sharp face under a thatch of thick
hair prematurely grey which at a little distance had the appearance
of being powdered, he frowned darkly upon his visitor.</p>

<p>"Ah, morbleu! But this is infernally imprudent!" he muttered
under his breath.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis smiled. "Do not be alarmed, S&eacute;nard."
He laid his agent's card upon the table for the secretary's
inspection.</p>

<p>"What's this?" S&eacute;nard inspected the card in astonishment.
"Is it some of Roussel's handiwork?"</p>

<p>"Oh, come now. Are we so clumsy as to commit forgeries that
could so easily be detected? You should know those signatures:
Amar, Caillieux, Sevestre. Besides, your register will show that it
was issued by this office."</p>

<p>S&eacute;nard scrutinized the card and returned it. His frown
had deepened. "But, then...I don't understand."</p>

<p>"My dear S&eacute;nard, have you never before known a man to act
in two capacities?" He stared straight and significantly at the
secretary who was himself in the pay of both sides.</p>

<p>"I see. Which is to say, I am in the dark. In what capacity do
you appear at present?"</p>

<p>"But as the agent of the committee, of course. I have a duty to
perform. A denunciation to make. A municipal officer, attached to
the Lepelletier Section, Burlandeux by name, is engaged in corrupt
practices. I have allowed him to believe me to be the agent of some
foreign power, and he has accepted from me a bribe to hold his
tongue."</p>

<p>"This will require proof," said S&eacute;nard.</p>

<p>"It has been provided. Half an hour ago I paid this scoundrel
three hundred <i>louis</i> in assignats. If your agents act quickly
they may still find the money in his pocket. His station in life
would not permit the honest possession of such a sum. Let him
explain to the committee how he comes by it."</p>

<p>Slowly S&eacute;nard nodded. "Set the denunciation down in
writing, citizen, and I will give instant orders."</p>

<p>An hour later the Municipal Burlandeux between two National
Guards faced the president of his Section to explain his possession
of three hundred <i>louis</i>. The wretched man, perceiving in how
simple a gin he had been caught, raved and stormed, but said no
word that did not further incriminate him. He listened to a moving
address from the president upon civic virtue, the importance of
purity in public functionaries, and the hideousness of venality
which merited nothing less than death. Upon that he was marched off
to Bic&ecirc;tre, there to await his trial, with the assurance that
the guillotine would follow. The bundle of assignats was forwarded
to S&eacute;nard, and by the Committee of Public Safety returned to
its agent Andr&eacute;-Louis Moreau with a warm commendation of his
skill in unmasking a scoundrel who abused the office with which the
Nation had entrusted him.</p>

<p>"Do you still think that Burlandeux will further trouble us?"
Andr&eacute;-Louis asked De Batz.</p>

<p>De Batz, looking at him, shook his head. "There are times,
Andr&eacute;, when you almost frighten me."</p>

<p>"That is not my aim. It is for you to put me in the way of
frightening others."</p>

<p>That evening they set about the business of frightening the
brothers Frey.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII - THE BROTHERS FREY</h2>

<p>That frail beauty, Madame de Sainte-Amarande, and her still more
beautiful daughter had not yet ceased in these days of Prairial of
the Year 2 to do the honours of that famous gaming-house known as
the Fifty. The place, if already beginning to decline from its
former splendid exclusive character, was still the best patronized
of all the public places within the precincts of the Palais Royal,
and admission was still to be gained only by introduction.</p>

<p>Thither in quest of Proly, who was known to frequent it
assiduously, went the Baron de Batz that evening accompanied by
Andr&eacute;-Louis. The Baron was well-known there, and the doors
opened readily to him and to his companion.</p>

<p>They wandered through fairly well tenanted rooms, where
ponderously ornate furnishings and decorations were beginning to
show signs of wear. A few elegant, courtly men with powdered heads,
who a couple of years ago would have been of the only type to be
met there, were now outnumbered by the raffish pleasure-seekers
whom the revolution with its doctrines of equality had made free of
every public place and every house of entertainment. The women,
almost without exception, were the feminine counterpart and natural
companions of these interlopers.</p>

<p>De Batz studied the punters about a faro-table before passing
into the farther room where roulette was being played and where the
attendance was greater. There he espied the blonde, graceful,
pale-complexioned Proly, an inveterate gamester, seated at play.
They were in luck, for behind his chair stood Junius Frey, sturdy
and swarthy, a man in the early thirties, dressed with truly
republican simplicity.</p>

<p>De Batz pointed them out to his companion, and would have
conducted him to them, but at that moment a moderately tall and
very shapely girl in mauve and silver with heavy golden tresses
dressed high, and the clearest of blue eyes, in turning away from
the table came suddenly face to face with Andr&eacute;-Louis. A
frown was instantly effaced from between those fine brows.
Amazement dawned on the comely face, and in a moment it was
transfigured; the dainty lips parted to reveal her strong white
teeth.</p>

<p>"Scaramouche!" she cried, and was upon him, and had kissed him,
there before all the world, in a reckless surrender to impulse.</p>

<p>"Columbine!" he answered her in an equal amazement. For here
before him stood a companion of his old histrionic days, the
Columbine of the Binet troupe which he had directed to fortune
before bringing it to ultimate disaster.</p>

<p>A heavy figure loomed beside them. Delaunay's quiet voice
addressed Andr&eacute;-Louis.</p>

<p>"You already have the advantage of the Citoyenne Descoings'
acquaintance?"</p>

<p>Four words of explanation served to melt the deputy's scowl and
to reassure him that here was no enterprising rival for the favours
of a woman for whose sake Delaunay was ready to sell his country
and risk his head.</p>

<p>"And so," said Andr&eacute;-Louis, "you are the famous, the
fortunate Descoings!"</p>

<p>"The unfortunate Descoings," she answered him with a rueful
smile. "I have just lost a hundred <i>louis</i>."</p>

<p>"You play too steeply," Delaunay admonished her.</p>

<p>"Perhaps. But, my friend, it is money I need, not reproofs. Lend
me a hundred <i>louis</i>, Delaunay."</p>

<p>The round face seemed to grow rounder in blankness. The eyes
were troubled under their black brows. "Faith! I don't possess
them, little one."</p>

<p>"Fifty, then. I must make good my losses. You'll not deny me
fifty."</p>

<p>"It breaks my heart, child," said Delaunay. Her frown terrified
him. "My dear..."</p>

<p>It was a moment of crisis, as Andr&eacute;-Louis perceived.
Softly he murmured: "Can I be of assistance?"</p>

<p>"If you can lend me fifty <i>louis</i>, Scaramouche..." she was
beginning, when Delaunay elbowed him away from her, and followed
him. Over his shoulder he begged of her: "A moment, little one! A
moment!" Then to Andr&eacute;-Louis, when he had thrust him beyond
her hearing: "We are to operate together. That is settled. It is
only the moment that has not yet arrived. Advance me a hundred
<i>louis</i> out of the share that is ultimately to come to me, and
you make me your friend for life."</p>

<p>"My dear Delaunay!" Andr&eacute;-Louis' tone implied a protest
of any doubt in the other's mind. Forth from his pocket he pulled a
bundle of assignats, and thrust it into the deputy's big hand.
"Here are three hundred. Repay me when you please."</p>

<p>Incredulously, effusively, Delaunay thanked him and went off, to
rejoin and satisfy the Descoings.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis reflected that a packet of assignats which
had already served that day as one man's probable passport to the
guillotine was likely now to discharge the same office by another.
With that grim reflection he sauntered after de Batz, who was
already deep in conversation with Proly. The Baron had drawn the
gamester away from the table and also away from his swarthy
companion. The two were alone and a little apart when
Andr&eacute;-Louis came up with them. De Batz presented him. To
Proly, who knew de Batz for a royalist agent, just as de Batz knew
him for an Austrian spy, this was a sufficient introduction. A sort
of freemasonry existing between them, Proly was quite frank on the
subject of the Freys. But it added little to the Baron's previous
knowledge. The republicanism of the brothers was entirely a
pretence. They were in France only to satisfy their appetite for
money. They played their patriotic part extremely well. They
courted in particular the men of the Mountain, the men of the party
standing to-day about Robespierre who undoubtedly, thought Proly,
aimed at nothing less than a dictatorship. Not only Chabot, but
Simon of Strasbourg and Bentabolles were entirely under the
influence of the Freys, and Lebrun the minister, who owed them
favours, also gave them his protection.</p>

<p>De Batz was disappointed in the information. Not so
Andr&eacute;-Louis.</p>

<p>"There is enough and to spare. It is established that they are
hypocrites, and the conscience of a hypocrite is a sensitive thing,
a ragged panoply that leaves him vulnerable."</p>

<p>By Proly the two conspirators were presented to the unsuspecting
Junius. To de Batz he had little to say, but he remembered Moreau's
name from the days of the Legislative Assembly, and in his guttural
French effusively expressed his satisfaction at making the
acquaintance of a man who deserved so well at the hands of all
lovers of freedom. After that he talked fantastically of the
glories of the revolution and the overthrow of despotism which had
trampled the dignity of man under its monstrous feet.</p>

<p>They became such good friends that Andr&eacute;-Louis did not
hesitate to pay him a visit two days later at his handsome house in
the Rue d'Anjou.</p>

<p>Junius Frey, swarthy, paunchy and oily, coarsely dressed in his
affectations of sansculottism, opened wide metaphorical arms to
this member of that great army of intellectuals who had been the
pioneers in the great work of delivering France from the fetters of
tyranny in which she had writhed. Thus at great length, in the best
manner of the orators of the Jacobins, Junius Frey gave him
welcome. He presented him to his brother Emmanuel, who was a year
or two younger, a cadaverous man with an overgrown look, a furtive
manner and a high-pitched voice. They made an odd contrast. The
elder brother so intensely virile, the younger almost emasculate.
And there was also a sister, L&eacute;opoldine, a child of not more
than sixteen, although displaying already the appearance of a full
muliebrity, who so little resembled either of them that it was
difficult to believe them of the same blood. She was small and
shapely, of a lighter complexion than either of her brothers, with
clear-cut features, gentle brown eyes, and a mass of brown hair
swathed turbanwise about her head above the row of curls that
rippled on her wide brow.</p>

<p>Having been presented and duly informed of the exalted civic
virtues of the Citizen Andr&eacute;-Louis Moreau, she was permitted
to procure cake and wine for the visitor's refreshment, and
thereafter encouraged to efface herself.</p>

<p>Junius desired to know if there was any way in which he could
serve the Citizen Moreau. Emmanuel supplied a high-pitched
echo.</p>

<p>"Why, since you offer it, my friends, I will take advantage of
you."</p>

<p>He looked round the solidly appointed room in which they sat and
noted here none of the Spartan republicanism that distinguished the
dress and speech of his hosts.</p>

<p>"This machine," he said, "of which you do me the honour to
regard me as one of the constructors, marches none too well of
late."</p>

<p>"Alas!" Junius sighed profoundly. "The human factor! Can we hope
for perfection where that is present?"</p>

<p>"If we are earnest and sincere we should seek to eliminate as
far as possible the imperfections."</p>

<p>"A sacred duty," said Junius.</p>

<p>"A noble task," added Emmanuel, washing his enormous bony hands
in the air.</p>

<p>"We who are not of the government," said Andr&eacute;-Louis,
"should employ our talents so as to influence in the right
direction those who are."</p>

<p>"Assuredly. Oh, assuredly!" cried both as with one voice.</p>

<p>"Fran&ccedil;ois Chabot is your friend. You will, I know, have
given him the advantage of your wide, almost cosmopolitan, vision.
You will have employed your influence to whet him like a knife for
the incisive work that still lies before all right-minded
patriots."</p>

<p>"How well you express it," purred Junius.</p>

<p>"How perfectly!" cried Emmanuel.</p>

<p>"At the same time," Andr&eacute;-Louis continued in a tolerant
tone, "you have turned him to your own profitable account."</p>

<p>Junius was startled out of his oily complacency. "How so?"</p>

<p>"Oh, but who shall blame you? Money in such noble hands as yours
is held in trust for mankind. You would never employ it in any but
worthy aims. Such men as you make it your task to remove the
bandage from the eyes of Fortune. You render her discerning in the
distribution of her favours, acting in this as her deputy. It is
indeed a sacred charge. You render it the nobler by the risks you
incur, the risks of being misunderstood, misrepresented. But what
are these risks to men of your patriotic heroism?"</p>

<p>The brothers' eyes were intently upon him. In those of Junius
anger began to smoulder. Emmanuel's reflected only fear. Although
Andr&eacute;-Louis paused, they said nothing. They waited for him
to come further out into the open to display his aims more clearly,
before they countered. So Andr&eacute;-Louis, smiling amiably,
resumed.</p>

<p>"Now I, my friends, am actuated by very similar intentions. Like
yourselves I have perceived that here all is not as well as it
should be, not as well as we who helped to make this revolution
could desire. But we who originally made are the ones who can mend,
who can guide. Together with the Citizen de Batz, who is associated
with me, I have made certain proposals to the Representative
Chabot, which he is now considering. The result of these would be
to make for the aggrandisement of the sacred cause of Liberty. But
the esteem in which you, my friends, are held by the Citizen Chabot
is as high as it is no doubt deserved. He permits himself to be
guided by you, in which he is heartily to be applauded. He would
make no decision in the matter we set before him until he has taken
counsel with you. Perhaps he has already done so?"</p>

<p>Junius, shrewd enough to perceive already whither his visitor
was travelling, and relieved that it was no worse, spoke at last to
answer him.</p>

<p>"He has not."</p>

<p>"Then I come in good time. Aware as you are of my republican
virtues, your own will hardly suffer you to advise him other than
to associate himself with me in these little enterprises which de
Batz and I have in view."</p>

<p>He had done. He sat back in his chair, and waited. Emmanuel was
shifting nervously, looking from his brother to their visitor,
until Junius, who had sat stolidly throughout, at last delivered
himself.</p>

<p>"That, my dear Citizen Moreau, must depend upon the nature of
these enterprises when the Citizen Chabot reveals them to me. Our
duty to the cause&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was interrupted. Andr&eacute;-Louis raised a hand in protest.
"My dear Frey! Could I suggest any course from which it would be
your duty to turn him? Can you impute such a thing as that to me,
whose patriotism I venture to say stands as high as your own, and
rests, if you will suffer the comparison, upon better evidence in
our respective past actions?" He did not give the financier time to
answer, but went on: "Situated as we are, actuated as we are by the
same sentiments of an unquestionable purity, you must see, citizen,
as I see, that united we can be of great assistance to each other."
Very slyly he added. "Almost it might be said of us that united we
stand, severed we fall."</p>

<p>If the threat was delicately veiled, it was none the less
instantly apparent to Junius.</p>

<p>He laughed uncomfortably. "Really, Citizen Moreau! Really! What
you desire me to understand is that I shall find co-operation with
you valuable, opposition to you dangerous."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis smiled. "It does happen that I can pull
strings in both directions."</p>

<p>"In short, you are threatening me, I think."</p>

<p>"Threatening? My dear Citizen Frey! What a word to use!"</p>

<p>"Would it not be better to be plain?" Junius was severe.
Emmanuel sat timorously observant and effaced.</p>

<p>"That is what I have endeavoured. One may be plain without
employing terms of an unnecessary harshness."</p>

<p>"You appear, Citizen Moreau, to be a master of that art."</p>

<p>"Among several others," said Andr&eacute;-Louis airily. He
finished his wine, dusted some crumbs of cake from his neckcloth,
and got up. "I am relieved to have been so readily understood."</p>

<p>The Citizen Junius rose in his turn; his brother followed his
example.</p>

<p>"You do not trouble," said the elder Frey, "to seek my
answer."</p>

<p>"Your answer? But your answer to what? I have asked no question,
citizen. I have merely indicated a situation."</p>

<p>"And you are not even curious to know how I shall act in
it?"</p>

<p>"I place my trust entirely in your intelligence," said the
affable Andr&eacute;-Louis and took his leave with many expressions
of the satisfaction it had afforded him to become acquainted with
two such exemplary patriots as the brothers Frey.</p>

<p>"That's a damned impudent fellow." said Junius to Emmanuel when
Andr&eacute;-Louis had gone.</p>

<p>"In these days," said Emmanuel, "only those who are safe venture
to be impudent. And those who are safe are always dangerous. I
think we should be careful with the Citizen Moreau. What shall you
do, Junius?"</p>

<p>"Ah! What?" wondered Junius.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV - THE GENIUS OF D'ENTRAGUES</h2>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis' heart would never have been as light as it
was whilst he pursued his preparations for the blasting of
republican reputations as an important preliminary to the blasting
of the Republic itself and the restoration of the House of Bourbon
if he could have guessed how the events at Hamm were conspiring
towards the blasting of his own future.</p>

<p>We have seen the Count of Provence persuaded that it was his
duty to bear what consolation he could to Mademoiselle de Kercadiou
for the bereavement which the service of himself and his house had
brought to her; and we have seen the diligent and far-sighted Count
d'Entragues confirming Monsieur in that persuasion.</p>

<p>It was a duty to which Monsieur devoted himself assiduously and
his assiduity increased in a measure as the necessity for it
mercifully diminished.</p>

<p>Once the shock had spent itself and the realization of her loss
had fully overtaken her, Mademoiselle de Kercadiou braced herself
to face life again as bravely as she might. The abiding wound to
her spirit betrayed itself only in a wistfulness that served to
heighten the appeal of her delicate loveliness and the more
violently to stir those longings secretly harboured by the Regent.
His attendance upon her became soon a daily habit. Daily he would
escape from his labours of correspondence, so that he might wait
upon Mademoiselle de Kercadiou, leaving his affairs more and more
to d'Avaray and d'Entragues, and doing little besides holding the
balance between the continual disagreements of these two. Almost
daily now, when the weather was fine, the inhabitants of Hamm would
meet the portly, strutting Regent of France and the slender
golden-headed Mademoiselle de Kercadiou walking abroad alone like
any bourgeois couple.</p>

<p>Just as d'Entragues' confidence in the issue increased, so did
d'Avaray's misgivings grow heavier. His uneasiness on the score of
his friend Madame de Balbi drove him to write strongly to her in
Brussels where she was installed. But the Countess, a child of
pleasure who had found a pretext to depart from Turin because of
the dullness of the court there, was not moved to quit the gaieties
of Brussels for the monastic severity and penury of life at Hamm.
Besides, her confidence in herself would not admit the uneasiness
for which d'Avaray's letters so insistently stressed the reason.
Let Monsieur by all means beguile the tedium of existence at Hamm
by amusing himself with the insipidities of the Lord of Gavrillac's
niece. Madame de Balbi would know how to resume her empire when
life at the Regent's side demanded fewer sacrifices than those
imposed by his Westphalian environment. She was not quite so
explicit as this in her letters. But d'Avaray read the plain truth
more and more clearly between the lines, and he was distressed. He
did not share her opinion that Mademoiselle de Kercadiou was
insipid, and it was quite evident to him that Monsieur was very far
from sharing it. There were signs actually that Monsieur was
discussing affairs of State with the Lord of Gavrillac's little
niece, and than this nothing could have afforded a graver index of
the depth of his feelings for her.</p>

<p>It was perhaps less significant than d'Avaray supposed. It was
merely a measure of subtle flattery, which the Regent, rendered
crafty by the unusual difficulties of the approach, was employing
so as to avoid alarming Mademoiselle de Kercadiou.</p>

<p>Just as everything was flowing precisely as d'Entragues could
wish, the courier from Pomelles, who had left Paris within some
hours of Lang&eacute;ac's departure, arrived at Hamm a fortnight
behind time, having been delayed on the way by a fall from his
horse which had left him suffering from concussion. Fortunately for
him he was across the frontier when this happened, and so he
remained in friendly hands, his papers untouched, until he was in
case to resume his journey.</p>

<p>These papers delivered to Monsieur d'Entragues gave this subtle
gentleman a bad quarter of an hour. There was the news in the
letter from Pomelles of the survival of this Moreau, whom they had
so confidently been accounting dead, and, what was worse, there was
the letter from this cursed Moreau himself to Mademoiselle de
Kercadiou. But d'Entragues rang for a servant, and into his hands
delivered the newly arrived and dusty courier.</p>

<p>"You will be weary, monsieur," he said to the latter. "You will
find a room at your disposal above-stairs. You are at liberty to
rest. What food you require will be sent to you there. I must ask
you in the interests of State not to leave that room or hold
conversation of any kind with any person until I send for you
again."</p>

<p>Monsieur at that very moment was at one of his daily promenades
with Mademoiselle. Monsieur de Kercadiou was at work in a
neighbouring chamber in the chalet. D'Entragues sat frowning,
considering the sealed letter from Moreau, which had been enclosed
in the package from his Paris agent. This was a damned inconvenient
resurrection. He turned the letter over; he studied the seal; he
was moved to break it, and see what the fellow found to say to his
lady; but he resisted the temptation. He would wait until Monsieur
returned. For whatever he did, and he began to have a shrewd
suspicion of what it would be, he must have Monsieur's
authority.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Monsieur, with little suspicion indeed of the
disagreeable surprise awaiting him at home, was chatting amiably,
insinuatingly, with the gentle lady, who, pitying his loneliness
and his misfortunes, was so ready to afford him the companionship
he sought with such condescending deference.</p>

<p>"You do not know, child," he was saying in that thick, purring
voice of his, "what strength and comfort I gather from our
discussions; how they help me in my difficulties."</p>

<p>It was not by any means the first time that he had used some
such words during the last of the three weeks that were sped since
Lang&eacute;ac's return with his sinister tidings.</p>

<p>They chanced to be walking by the Lippe. It was the first time
they had gone that way, by the very path which she and
Andr&eacute;-Louis had trodden in February last, when the
countryside had lain white in the grip of frost. Now all was vernal
green, the meadows jewelled with flowers, the shrunken river
flowing cool and clear in the shade of willows heavy with feathery
leaf.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Kercadiou, in a long coat of dark green with
wide lapels and a broad black hat to render her whiteness the more
startling, stepped daintily beside the sluggish portly prince whose
height was shorter than her own by an inch or so.</p>

<p>"These talks have helped me, too," she said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>He checked, and turned to her, leaning upon his gold-headed
cane. They were quite alone here in the meadows by the river,
within sight of that very stile where Andr&eacute;-Louis and she
had paused on that day of their last week together. High overhead,
invisible in the blue, a lark was pouring out its liquid song.</p>

<p>"If I could believe that, my dear child!"</p>

<p>Wistfully she smiled upon the sudden gravity of his florid
countenance.</p>

<p>"Is it difficult to believe? In your preoccupations,
monseigneur, I have found some refuge from my own."</p>

<p>"Do you conceive the joy with which I hear you say it? It makes
me of some account, of some use in this world where nowadays there
seems to be no place for me or need of me."</p>

<p>"You exaggerate, monseigneur, to express the kindness you have
always shown me."</p>

<p>"Kindness? How inadequately that describes my feelings, Aline. I
have studied in my mind how I might serve you. Hence the
inexpressible satisfaction borne me by what you have now said. If
it could but be given to me to comfort you, to bring you abiding
consolation, then I should be the proudest, the happiest of
men."</p>

<p>"You should be that, monseigneur, who are the noblest." Her
gentle eyes considered him almost in wonder. He winced a little
under that clear regard. The colour deepened in his cheeks.</p>

<p>"I had not deserved," she added, "so great a condescension."</p>

<p>"What have you not deserved of me, Aline?" He took her arm in
the grip of his plump white fingers. "What is there that you may
not command of me? Of my love for you?"</p>

<p>Watching her keenly with his full eyes, that one handsome
feature of his otherwise dull face, he read in her troubled glance
that he had been premature. This delicious fruit had not yet
ripened under the covert ardour of his cautious wooing. She was
timid as a gazelle, and he scared her by the clumsiness of his
approach. He perceived the necessity to restore at once her
confidence. Gently, but resolutely, she was disengaging her arm
from his grip, a slight contact, yet one which did not make it
easier for him now to retreat. But retreat he did in the best order
he could summon. Looking deep into her eyes, he smiled very
gently.</p>

<p>"You suspect perhaps that I but indulge an idle gallantry. My
dear! My affection for you is very real, very deep and very
sincere, as it was for your Uncle Etienne whose memory I shall ever
cherish."</p>

<p>This, of course, gave a new meaning to his declaration, and in
effacing the suspicion she had conceived made her almost ashamed of
it. Hence a reaction in his favour which brought a flush to her
cheeks and made her falter in her reply.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur, you do me a great honour; too great an
honour."</p>

<p>"No honour could be too great for you. I am but a prince by
birth, whilst you are a princess by nature: noble in your soul with
a nobility loftier than any that is of human conferring."</p>

<p>"Monseigneur, you leave me confused."</p>

<p>"Your modesty does that. You have never realized yourself. That
is the way of rare natures such as yours. It is only the worthless
who harbour notions of their worth."</p>

<p>She battled feebly against this tide of flattery. "Monseigneur,
your own nobility lends a kindliness to your vision. There is
little worth in me."</p>

<p>"You shall not decry yourself. With me it is idle. I have too
much evidence of your goodness. Who but a saint would be so
compassionate of my loneliness as to give so freely of herself to
mitigate it?"</p>

<p>"What are you saying, monseigneur!"</p>

<p>"Is it less than the truth? Am I not lonely? Lonely and
unfortunate, almost friendless nowadays, reduced to poverty, living
in sordidness?" Thus he stirred her sympathy which was ever at the
call of those in need of it, her sweet womanly instinct to solace
the afflicted. "It is in such times as these that we know our true
friends. In this hour I can count my own upon the fingers of one
hand. I live here upon grudging charity, at once a prince and a
pauper, forsaken by all but a very faithful few. Can I do less than
repay in love the disinterested devotion which I can scarcely
contemplate without tears?"</p>

<p>They were retracing now their steps, moving slowly along the
river's brink, Aline deeply stirred by his lament and flattered to
be the recipient of his princely confidences, to have him lay bare
to her his secret and humiliating thoughts. She was conscious, too,
that these confidences were forging a stronger link between them.
As they moved, he continued to talk, passing to still deeper
intimacies.</p>

<p>"A prince's is never an enviable estate, even in the happiest
times. He is courted not for himself but for that which his favour
can bestow. He is ever in danger of mistaking sycophancy for love;
and if that happens which tests the relations he has formed, if
there comes a time when he must depend upon the merits of his own
self rather than upon the glitter of his rank, bitterness is
commonly his portion. How many of those whom I trusted most, whose
affection I deemed most sincere, stand by me to-day? There was one
of whom I believed that she would have remained at my side when all
others had forsaken me. Where is she now? Her affection for me when
put to the test is not strong enough to envisage poverty."</p>

<p>She knew that he alluded to Madame de Balbi, and at the pathos
in his voice her pity for him deepened.</p>

<p>"Is it not possible, monseigneur, that, aware of your straitened
circumstances, your friends hesitate to encroach upon them?"</p>

<p>"How charitable you are! How everything you say reveals a fresh
beauty of your soul! I have sought to flatter my vanity by just
such a conclusion. But the evidences deny it." He sighed
ponderously. Then his liquid eyes sought her countenance and he
smiled sadly into it. "Ah, but there are consolations. Your
friendship, my dear Aline, is the greatest of them. I hope that I
am not destined to lose it with the rest."</p>

<p>Her eyes were misty. "Since you value this poor friendship of
mine, monseigneur, you may be sure that it will never fail
you."</p>

<p>"My dear!" he said, and paused to take her hand, and bear it to
his lips.</p>

<p>Thus he effected in good order his retreat from a position
towards which he had prematurely advanced. He stood once more upon
the solid ground of friendship thence later, to direct an attack
for which experience told him that the opportunity would not now be
indefinitely postponed. And in the meantime her own sympathy should
be employed to undermine her defences.</p>

<p>But back at the chalet that evening he was to be informed by the
waiting d'Entragues of that other obstacle which he had been
accounting so definitely surmounted.</p>

<p>"He lives!" Monsieur had cried, and in that cry, in its pitch,
and the suddenly disordered appearance of him, he had completely
betrayed himself to his astute minister.</p>

<p>"Not only does he live; but he is well and active."</p>

<p>"My God!" said the Regent, and sat down heavily, taking his head
in his hands. There was a pause.</p>

<p>"I have a letter from him for Mademoiselle de Kercadiou,"
d'Entragues softly informed him. Monsieur said nothing. He sat on,
like a man stunned. D'Entragues waited in silence, watching him,
the ghost of a smile at the corners of his tight mouth. At last:
"Does your highness desire it to be delivered?" he asked.</p>

<p>Such was his tone that at last the Regent lowered his hands, and
looked at him. The round face was startled, almost scared.</p>

<p>"Delivered?" he asked hoarsely. "But what else, d'Entragues?
What else?"</p>

<p>D'Entragues drew a long breath audibly, like a sigh. "I have
been thinking, monseigneur."</p>

<p>"You have been thinking? And then?"</p>

<p>The letter was in d'Entragues' hands, poised by its edges
between his forefingers. He rotated it slowly as he spoke. "It
seems almost a refinement of cruelty." He paused there, and then,
in answer to the question in Monsieur's stare, he went on: "This
rash young man and that fanfarron de Batz continue in reactionary
activities, likely to result in nothing but the fall of their own
heads under the guillotine."</p>

<p>"What then? What is in your mind?"</p>

<p>D'Entragues raised his brows as if deprecating the sluggishness
of his master's wits. "This gentle young lady has already suffered
her bereavement. She has endured her agony. She has recovered from
it. Time has begun to heal the wound. Is her anguish to be suffered
all over again at some time in the near future, when that which in
this case was a misapprehension of that idiot Lang&eacute;ac shall
come to be the actual fact?"</p>

<p>Monsieur considered. His breathing was slightly laboured. "I
see," he said. "Yes. But if, after all, Moreau should survive all
these perils he is facing?"</p>

<p>"That is so improbable as not to be worth taking into account.
He has escaped this time by a miracle. Such miracles do not happen
twice in a man's life. And even if it did..." He broke off,
ruminating.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," the Regent rapped at him. "What then? What then?
That is what I want to know. What then?"</p>

<p>"Even then no harm would have been done, and perhaps some good.
It is clear to all that this is a m&eacute;salliance for
Mademoiselle de Kercadiou. She is deserving of something far better
than this nameless fellow, this bastard of God knows whom. If in
the persuasion that he is dead she puts him from her mind, as she
is doing already, and if before he comes to life again&mdash;if he
ever should, which is so very unlikely&mdash;her affections,
liberated from his thrall, shall have fixed themselves elsewhere,
upon someone worthier, would not that be something to the
good?"</p>

<p>The Regent was continuing to stare at him. "That letter?" he
said at last.</p>

<p>D'Entragues shrugged. "Need any know that it ever arrived? It is
a miracle that it did, The fellow who brought it suffered a
concussion that delayed him three weeks upon the road. He might
easily have suffered death."</p>

<p>"But, my God! I know of its existence."</p>

<p>"Could your highness blame yourself for silence where it may do
so much good, and when speech might be the cause of such ultimate
suffering to a lady who deserves well?"</p>

<p>The tortured prince took his head in his hands again. At long
last he spoke without looking up.</p>

<p>"I give you no orders, d'Entragues. I desire to know nothing
more of this. You will act entirely upon your own discretion."</p>

<p>The smile which hitherto had been a ghost took definite shape
upon the lips of Monsieur d'Entragues. He bowed to the averted
huddled figure of his prince.</p>

<p>"Perfectly, monseigneur," he said.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV - THE INTERDICT</h2>

<p>Life in Paris was becoming uncomfortable. The results of
government by Utopian ideals began to make themselves felt. In the
words of Saint-Just, "misery had given birth to the Revolution, and
misery might destroy it." The immediate cause lay in the fact that,
again to quote the fidus Achates of Robespierre, "the multitude
which had recently been living upon the superfluities of luxury and
by the vices of another class," found itself without means of
subsistence.</p>

<p>In less revolutionary language this means that the vast mass of
the people which found employment so long as there was a wealthy
nobility to employ it, was now, under the beneficent rule of
equality, unemployed and faced with destitution. Not only were
these unfortunates without the means to purchase food, but food
itself was becoming difficult to purchase. The farmers were
becoming increasingly reluctant to market their produce, in
exchange for paper money which was daily depreciating in value.</p>

<p>For this depreciation, partly resulting from the flood of
assignats in which the country was submerged, the Convention
denounced the forgers who were at work. The Convention beheld in
them the agents of the foreign despots who sought by these means to
push the Nation into bankruptcy. This was, of course, a gross
exaggeration; it possessed nevertheless some slight basis of truth.
We do know of the activities of that printing-press at Charonne,
and of the reckless prodigality with which de Batz was putting in
circulation the beautiful paper money manufactured there by the
extraordinarily skilful Balthazar Roussel. De Batz served two
purposes at once: directly, he corrupted by means of this
inexhaustible wealth those members of the government whom he found
corruptible: indirectly, he increased the flood of forgeries that
was so seriously embarrassing the Convention and diluting the
shrunken resources of the Nation.</p>

<p>Saint-Just had a crack-brained notion of relieving matters by
using grain as currency. Thus he felt that the agriculturists might
be induced to part with it in exchange for other substances. But
agriculturists, being by the very nature of their activities
self-supporting, the scheme, otherwise impracticable, held little
promise of success and was never put into execution. Industry and
manufacture languished. Conscription was absorbing some seven
hundred and fifty thousand men into its fourteen armies. But apart
from this there was little employment to be found. The tanneries
were idle, iron and wool were almost as scarce as bread. What
little was produced barely sufficed for home consumption, so that
nothing was left for export, and consequently the foreign exchanges
rose steadily against France.</p>

<p>To the physical depression arising out of this came in the early
days of that July of 1793, style esclave, Messidor of the Year 2 by
the calendar of Liberty One and Indivisible, a moral depression
resulting from the disasters to French arms, despite the
unparalleled masses which conscription had enrolled.</p>

<p>And when on the anniversary that year of the fall of the
Bastille came the assassination of the popular idol Marat by a
young woman concerned to avenge the unfortunate Girondins, Paris
went mad with rage.</p>

<p>Charlotte Corday was guillotined in a red shirt&mdash;the
Convention decreed Pantheon honours to the murdered patriot, and
never was there such a funeral as the torchlight procession in
which his remains were borne to their tomb.</p>

<p>Fran&ccedil;ois Chabot, discerning parallels between Marat's
position and his own, thundered in the Convention denunciations
which reflected his own fear of assassination.</p>

<p>But the Convention had other distractions. At the moment
Cond&eacute;e was occupied by the Austrians, and then in Thermidor
Valenciennes suffered the same fate and Kl&eacute;ber capitulated
at Mainz. The Vendee was in flagrant insurrection, and in the south
there were mutterings of a royalist storm.</p>

<p>A cause for all these disasters, and for the menace of worse
that seemed to overhang the land, had to be discovered by the
Utopians who had endowed France and who hoped to endow the world
with the glorious rule of Universal Brotherhood. It was discovered
in the machinations of aristocrats at home and of Pitt and Coburg
abroad. Against Pitt and Coburg the Convention could only inveigh.
But against her home conspirators she could take action. And to
this end was passed the Law of Suspects which was to overwhelm the
new Revolutionary Tribunal with work and bring the guillotine into
daily function.</p>

<p>Thus the Reign of Terror was established. Danton, newly-married,
having been active in establishing it, went off to his lands at
Arcis-sur-Aube, there to devote himself to agriculture and
uxoriousness. Robespierre became more than ever the focus of
popular hope and popular idolatry, with Saint-Just at his side to
inspire him, and his little group of supporters to ensure that his
will should be paramount. Already there were rumours that he aimed
at a dictatorship. Saint-Just had boldly declared that a dictator
was a necessity to a country in the circumstances in which France
found herself, without however explaining how this could be
reconciled with the purity of views which beheld tyranny in all
individual authority.</p>

<p>For Fran&ccedil;ois Chabot, that other stout henchman of the
Incorruptible Maxmilien, these continued to be busy days. The Law
of Suspects gave a free rein to his passion for denunciation, and
almost daily now his capucinades were to be heard from the tribune
of the Convention.</p>

<p>He would wade, he announced, through mud and blood in the
service of the people. He would tear out his heart and give it to
be eaten by the irresolute in republicanism, that thus they might
assimilate the pure patriotism by which it was inspired.</p>

<p>Daily now the bread queues increased at the bakers; daily the
populace, its passions whetted by famine, grew more bloodthirsty;
daily the tumbrils, with their escorts of National Guards and
rolling drums, rumbled down the Rue Saint Honor&eacute; to the
Place de la Revolution. Nevertheless the curtain still rose
punctually every evening at the Opera, there was an undiminished
attendance at the Fifty and other gaming-houses in the Palais
Egalit&eacute;&mdash;heretofore Palais Royal&mdash;and elsewhere,
and life in the main pursued a normal course on this swiftly
thinning crust of a volcano.</p>

<p>De Batz watched, organized and waited. His work lay in Paris,
and in Paris he would remain whatever might be happening elsewhere.
The Marquis de la Guiche, that most enterprising and daring of his
associates, who went by the name of Sevignon, would have lured him
away to join the insurrectionaries in the South. The Marquis,
himself a soldier, reminded de Batz that he was a soldier, too, and
pointed out that in the South a soldier's work awaited him. But de
Batz would not move, such was his faith in the schemes of
Andr&eacute;-Louis, and in the end La Guiche departed alone to
carry his sword where there was employment for it. The Baron did
not oppose his departure. But he regretted it deeply, for there was
no man more whole-heartedly devoted to the restoration of the
monarchy than this utterly fearless, downright Marquis de la
Guiche, who had been the only one to stand by him in that attempt
to rescue the King.</p>

<p>He overcame, however, his regrets and remained at the post he
had allotted himself. Here all was going as it should. At the
present pace the revolution could not last much longer. Soon now
this unfortunate populace must be brought to realize that its
sufferings were the result of the incompetence of its rulers and of
the chaos which had been born of their idealism. If, without
awaiting this, it could be made to discover that the elected were
corrupt and dishonest, and it could assign to their corruption, and
not merely to incompetence, the hunger which it was made to endure,
then a storm should arise that must sweep away for ever those windy
rhetoricians. This had been the thought of Andr&eacute;-Louis. The
soundness of its foundation was being confirmed by the march of
events observed at close quarters. Meanwhile the captivity of the
Queen and her family continued. A month and more had passed since
the attempt to rescue her, and nothing further had been heard of
the negotiations with Vienna for the exchange of prisoners. De Batz
began to be uneasy. Reasonably he suspected that the negotiations
had aborted. The Queen's salvation must depend now upon the speedy
exploding of the revolution. Therefore he spurred on
Andr&eacute;-Louis in the delicate task to which his confederate
had set his hand.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis required no spurring. The task itself
absorbed him. He approached it like a chess-player carefully
studying the sequence of moves by which the end was to be
reached.</p>

<p>Fran&ccedil;ois Chabot was his immediate object, to be gained by
the brothers Frey, mere pawns to be taken or not in passing as the
developments should indicate. And the Freys were making things easy
for him. His skilfully masked approach of defences, which the
brothers knew in their consciences to be extremely vulnerable, had
not failed of its intimidation. Junius, having considered, had
discovered that their security lay in welcoming an association
which they dared not take the risk of refusing. He had been helped
to his decision by a hint from Proly that de Batz was in alliance
with Moreau, and that de Batz wielded a wide and mysterious
influence, a power which it was not prudent to provoke.</p>

<p>So the Freys opened their doors to the Baron and his friend, and
had no immediate cause to regret it. On the contrary, the Baron,
disposing of very considerable sums, showed himself from the outset
able and willing to co-operate with the Freys in any of the
financial ventures which engaged them and for which funds were
necessary. Soon, indeed, the brothers came to congratulate
themselves upon an association which at first had been forced upon
them against their inclinations. The Baron displayed a shrewdness
in finance which commended him increasingly to the respect and even
friendship of the Freys, and which resulted in some transaction of
considerable profit to them both.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis, too, being associated with the Baron, was by
now on intimate terms with these Jewish bankers, a constant visitor
at their substantial house in the Rue d'Anjou, and at their
well-furnished table, which had first rendered apparent to the
starveling Chabot the advantages of accepting the friendship of
these very zealous apostles of liberty, equality, and fraternity.
The quiet, comely little L&eacute;opoldine never failed to make him
welcome to dinner at her brothers' house, and made no secret of the
fact that she found a pleasure in his company. Her gentle brown
eyes would soften as they watched him; her ears were attentive to
all that he said, and her lips ready to smile at any sally of his.
Thus very soon he was entirely at home with the Freys. They made
him feel&mdash;as they had made Chabot feel&mdash;almost one of the
family.</p>

<p>One evening after he and de Batz had dined at the Rue d'Anjou,
and whilst they were still at table, Chabot being of the party,
Junius expounded to them a scheme in which he believed that
millions could be made.</p>

<p>He and his brother were fitting out at Marseilles a corsair
fleet to operate in the Mediterranean, raiding not only the ships
of enemy powers but also those ports on the Spanish and Italian
coast which could easily be surprised.</p>

<p>Junius coloured the undertaking so speciously as to make it
appear of outstanding national importance, a patriotic enterprise
of advantage to the Republic since it harrassed her enemies.
Andr&eacute;-Louis appeared to be profoundly impressed. He praised
the project in high terms for both its financial and patriotic
soundness, that de Bate at once offered a contribution of a hundred
thousand livres.</p>

<p>Junius smiled approval upon him. "You are quick to judge
opportunity, my friend."</p>

<p>Chabot was looking at him with round eyes. "You have the
advantage of being wealthy," he said with a sigh of envy.</p>

<p>"If you would enjoy the same advantage, this is your
opportunity, Citizen-Representative."</p>

<p>"I?" Chabot smiled sourly. "I have not the necessary means to
acquire a share. My labours have all been in the service of
humanity. They bring no pecuniary reward."</p>

<p>"Think of the treasure you might have amassed in Heaven if the
Republic had not abolished it," said Andr&eacute;-Louis.</p>

<p>"My friend, you are flippant," the representative reproved him.
"You gibe upon sacred subjects. It is not worthy."</p>

<p>"Do you still regard Heaven as a sacred subject?"</p>

<p>"I so regard the Republic," Chabot thundered. "You permit
yourself to jest about it. A sacrilege."</p>

<p>De Batz intervened to place his purse at the disposal of the
representative, so that he might acquire a share in this venture.
Chabot, however, would not be tempted. If the business went awry,
as well it might, for the risks connected with it were not to be
denied, he would be without means to repay. He would be left in
debt, and that was a dangerous situation for a Representative of
the People. The Baron did not pursue the matter. He returned
instead to the subject of his own investment, settling the
details.</p>

<p>On their way home, through deserted streets at a late hour of
that summer night, Andr&eacute;-Louis approved him.</p>

<p>"You were quick to take the hint, Jean."</p>

<p>"Even although I did not perceive your aim. My trust in you
becomes almost child-like, Andr&eacute;."</p>

<p>"My aim is twofold. To seduce Chabot by showing him how easily
and safely he may grow rich by trusting us, and so to display our
powers to the Freys that they will not venture to oppose us,
whatever we demand. You shall see some pretty happenings
shortly."</p>

<p>But the month was out before Andr&eacute;-Louis made any further
move. He concerned himself, meanwhile, jointly with de Batz, in
some transactions in &eacute;migr&eacute; property by which
Delaunay and Julien were allowed to profit modestly, so as to
encourage them.</p>

<p>Then one August morning he went off alone to the Tuileries.
Awaiting the end of the morning session, he paced the hall mingling
with the incredibly assorted attendance attracted by different
motives to this vestibule of government. The preponderance was of
rough men of the people, uncouth, ill-kempt, loud of voice and foul
of utterance, some of them red-capped, all making great parade of
revolutionary colours. As a leaven there were amongst them a few
exquisites with powdered heads and striped coats, and a goodly
proportion of men of the lawyer class in sober, well-cut raiment
wearing their hair in clubs, with here and there the blue and white
of an officer or the blue and red of a National Guardsman; and
there were some women present, too, for the most part coarse
slatterns from the markets who took an interest in politics, bare
of arms and almost bare of bosom, the tricolour cockade in their
mob-caps. All intermingled and rubbed shoulders on terms of the
equality dictated by the revolutionary rule.</p>

<p>Sitting apart on one of the benches ranged against a wall,
Andr&eacute;-Louis watched the scene with interest whilst he
waited, himself scarcely observed. Ever and anon when a
representative or other person of consequence arrived or departed,
the thin crowd would range itself aside to give him passage, its
members saluting him as he passed, some respectfully but most of
them familiarly.</p>

<p>Many of these were known to Andr&eacute;-Louis. There was
Chabot, short, sturdy and ill-clad, with a red cap on his brown
curls, undisputedly the greatest man with the populace now that
Marat was dead. Pleasantries, at once obscene and affectionate,
hailed him as he strutted through the crowd, and were returned by
him in kind. In contrast, there was a young man of striking beauty
of face and figure, dressed with conspicuous elegance, with whom
none dared take such liberties. He was deferentially greeted as he
passed, and he acknowledged the greetings with a casual haughtiness
which no aristocrat of the old r&eacute;gime could have exceeded.
This was the terrible Chevalier de Saint-Just, a gentleman by
birth, a rogue by nature, who had lent the fire of his eloquence
and personality to hoist Robespierre to the first place in the
State.</p>

<p>There was another, an older man, also of a good presence and
careful attire, languid of air and affected of manner, in whom
Andr&eacute;-Louis recognized the dramatist and legislator Fabre,
who had assumed the poetical name of d'Eglantine and who had
attached himself to the tribune Danton.</p>

<p>At last among those issuing from the Convention he beheld the
man he awaited, and rose to intercept him.</p>

<p>"A word with you on a matter of national importance,
Delaunay."</p>

<p>The representative used him with the deference due to the man by
whom we hope to profit. They extricated themselves from the throng,
and sought the bench which Andr&eacute;-Louis had lately
occupied.</p>

<p>"Things move slowly, Delaunay."</p>

<p>"You don't reproach me with it, I hope," the representative
grumbled.</p>

<p>"We will never quicken them, never come to big operations until
Chabot's timidity is conquered."</p>

<p>"Agreed. But then?"</p>

<p>"This. The Freys, who control him, have sunk a fortune in a
fleet of corsairs." He supplied some details. "An interdict upon
that fleet would ruin them."</p>

<p>Delaunay was startled. "Do you want to ruin them?"</p>

<p>"Oh no. Merely to temper them. Merely to bend them to the proper
shape for our ends."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis talked for some time, and evidently to some
purpose; for three days later desolation descended upon that house
in the Rue d'Anjou. From the tribune of the Convention the Deputy
Delaunay had denounced the corsairs as robbers. "The Republic
cannot sanction brigands by sea or land!" That had been his text.
Upon this he had preached a sermon of Republican virtue and
probity, at the end of which he had demanded an interdict against
the corsair fleet. This had been voted by a Convention which had
little interest in the matter.</p>

<p>De Batz and Andr&eacute;-Louis sought the Freys. De Batz wore an
air of consternation. "My friends, this is ruin for me!" In
consternation he was answered that it was ruin for them no
less.</p>

<p>Emmanuel was in tears, whilst Junius so far forgot himself in
his rage as to inveigh against Chabot.</p>

<p>"That man has come here to guzzle at my table daily for the past
three months, and now when he might have stood my friend, when by a
word in time he might have averted this disaster, he keeps silent
and leaves us to our fate. That is a friend for you! Ah, name of
God!"</p>

<p>"You should have made him a partner in the venture," said de
Batz. "I attempted it; but you did not support me."</p>

<p>"At least," said Andr&eacute;-Louis, "make use of him in this
extremity. If you don't, it is ruin. You have a responsibility
towards de Batz, my friend. You will forgive my mentioning it."</p>

<p>"A responsibility. Oh, my God! He was a free agent. You knew
what you were doing. I laid all my cards on the table. You saw
precisely what was involved. Enough that we should be ruined in
ourselves without being charged with responsibility for the ruin of
others."</p>

<p>"And it won't help. What matters is to have things corrected, to
have this ban lifted. Get Chabot here. Invite him to dinner.
Amongst us we must constrain him."</p>

<p>Junius Frey obeyed; but he was not sanguine. He regarded an
appeal to Chabot as a forlorn hope, and Chabot justified him of
this when that same evening across the dinner table it was proposed
to him that he should stand their friend and procure the repeal of
the interdict.</p>

<p>"If I were to do as you require how should I ever justify myself
before the tribunal of my conscience?"</p>

<p>Before the condemnation in his glance the long, bony Emmanuel
seemed to wilt and even the sturdy Junius grew uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Giving no one time to answer him, Chabot launched himself upon
an oration, a magnificent capucinade, some of the best sentiments
of which were borrowed from the speech in which Delaunay had
demanded the troublesome decree, but the terms of which were
luridly Chabot's own. He inveighed fiercely against all dishonesty
and peculation. He dwelt at length upon the corrupting power of
gold which he described as the drag upon the wheels of progress
towards that universal brotherhood which was to transform the earth
into the likeness of a celestial abode.</p>

<p>"I remind you again," Andr&eacute;-Louis cut in dryly, "that the
Republic has abolished Heaven."</p>

<p>Thrown out of his rhetorical stride, Chabot glared annoyance. "I
speak in images," he announced.</p>

<p>"You should select them more in accordance with the creed of
reason," Andr&eacute;-Louis reproved him. "Otherwise you are in
danger of being suspected of cant, a disease of which you are
certainly a victim."</p>

<p>To Chabot this was almost paralysing.</p>

<p>"A victim of cant? I?" He could hardly speak.</p>

<p>"Your ardour misleads you. Your virtuous passion sweeps you
headlong down false tracks. Listen to me a moment,
Citizen-Representative. In this imperfect world it is not often
that good may be done without some harm resulting. In every
projected action a wise statesman must consider which is to
predominate. These corsairs are robbers. Admitted. To rob is a
crime, and a pure republicanism cannot condone crime. Again
admitted. But who is robbed? The enemies of France. For whose
profit? That of the French Republic. And that which profits the
Nation increases her strength and enables her the better to defeat
her enemies at home and abroad. Thus there is a little personal
harm to the end that there may be a great national good. This is a
phase you have not considered. Mankind is not to be served by
narrow views, Citizen-Representative. It is necessary to survey the
whole field at once. If I steal the weapons from an assassin I
commit a theft, which is a civic offence. But am I merely a robber,
or am I a benefactor of mankind?"</p>

<p>There was loud, excited approval from the Freys and from de
Batz. Little L&eacute;opoldine, who was at table with them,
considered with glowing eyes the keen, pale face of the speaker.
Chabot sat mute, bludgeoned by an argument which fundamentally was
sound.</p>

<p>But when, taking advantage of this, de Batz renewed the appeal
to him that he should make himself the champion of the corsairs and
procure the repeal of the interdict, the conventional bestirred
himself to resist. He waved a plump, ill-shaped and unclean
hand.</p>

<p>"Ah that, no! Shall I make myself the advocate of robbers? What
will be thought of me?"</p>

<p>"So long as you can answer before the tribunal of your
conscience, does it matter what will be thought of you elsewhere?"
asked Andr&eacute;-Louis.</p>

<p>Chabot scanned him for signs of mockery. But found none.
Andr&eacute;-Louis continued.</p>

<p>"Not to do that which you acknowledge to be right merely from
fear of the appearances, is hardly worthy of one who dwells in the
pure atmosphere of the Mountain."</p>

<p>"You are under a misapprehension," Chabot retorted. "A man in my
position, bearing the sacred trust imposed upon me by the People,
must set an example in all the virtues."</p>

<p>"Agreed. Oh, agreed. But is it a virtue merely to appear
virtuous when in your heart you know that your action is not
virtuous? Is the shadow more important than the substance,
Citizen-Representative?"</p>

<p>"It might be. Suspicion is but a shadow. There may be no
substance behind it. Yet if it fall across a man in these days..."
He completed the sentence by a jab with the edge of his hand
against his neck and a grim wink.</p>

<p>"So that it comes to this," said de Batz. "You are, after all,
governed not by virtue but by fear."</p>

<p>Chabot became annoyed, and the Freys bestirred themselves to
restore harmony. Junius filled the representative's glass, Emmanuel
piled his plate. They protested that the repast was being ruined by
the discussion. They would lose all the money engaged in the
corsair venture and every franc besides rather than spoil the
appetite of so worthy a guest.</p>

<p>"For the rest," said Junius, whilst Chabot fell once more to
eating, "when have you ever known me to advocate any measures that
were not founded upon the purest republican principles? Look into
my history, Fran&ccedil;ois, which I have so fully disclosed to
you. Remember all the sacrifices of fortune and of the toys that
despotism describes as honours which I have made in order to come
and dwell in the pure air of a republican nation that shall rival
the glories of ancient Rome. Should I, then&mdash;can you suspect
it?&mdash;mislead you now for the sake of a paltry personal profit;
a profit which I should never have sought if I had not seen that
France would profit to an even greater degree?"</p>

<p>Chabot continued to eat while he listened. He was noisy over it
and not at all nice to observe.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis followed up that shrewd assault upon the
ramparts of the representative's apprehensions.</p>

<p>"You do not perceive, and we have hesitated to point out to you,
that the action to which we urge you is one in which you should
cover yourself with glory. More shrewd than the superficial
Delaunay, who demanded this decree, you perceive that by favouring
the enemies of France it is actually harmful to the best interests
of the Republic. I warn you that another will not overlook this as
you have been doing, for it leaps to the eye as soon as mentioned.
Will you leave it for someone else to garner the laurels with which
we invite you to adorn your brows?"</p>

<p>With his mouth full, the representative stared at him. "What are
the arguments that would carry that conviction?"</p>

<p>"You possess them already in what I have said. You shall have
more if you need them. It is easy to plead convincingly and
eloquently when a man pleads truthfully. Magna est veritas et
prevalebit. Here we ask you to state nothing but the truth."</p>

<p>Chabot continued to stare at him, obviously shaken. Then he
emptied his glass at a draught. And whilst he wavered, de Batz
briskly pursued the attack.</p>

<p>"You have been prejudiced, Citizen-Representative, because you
have misunderstood us. You have imagined that we are asking a
service of you, when in fact we are showing you your
opportunity."</p>

<p>"That's it," said Junius. "Name of a name! This good Chabot
conceives that we are abusing the sacred duty of hospitality to
take advantage of a guest. Ah, Fran&ccedil;ois! Name of a name! But
that is to wrong me terribly."</p>

<p>"Leave it," said Andr&eacute;-Louis on a sudden note of
finality. "Since that is how Chabot feels, we must not press him. I
will see Julien this evening. He will thank me for the chance which
Chabot refuses."</p>

<p>But now Chabot displayed alarm.</p>

<p>"You go so fast!" he complained. "You reach conclusion before we
have even had discussion. If I should come to see clearly that this
interdict is against the best interests of the Nation, do you
imagine that I should hesitate to demand its repeal? You must tell
me more, Moreau. Let me have the arguments in detail. Meanwhile, I
take your word for it that they are as pure and convincing as you
all assert."</p>

<p>They applauded him. They congratulated him. They plied him with
wine, and whilst he sipped it they talked philosophy and the
Redemption of Man, the deliverance of the universe from the
thraldom of despotism under which humanity was writhing and all the
rest of the Utopian nonsense by which they would have reduced the
world to the famine-stricken, blood-soaked state of France.</p>

<p>It was all very moving. Chabot, under the influence of wine and
rhetoric, was brought to the verge of tears by pondering the
unhappy lot of his fellow-men. All this, however, did not prevent
him from turning a languishing eye ever anon upon the timid
L&eacute;opoldine. His imagination likened her to a little
partridge, so young, so shy and so tender; a toothsome morsel for
an apostle of Freedom, for a patriot who, in his superb altruism
and self-abnegation, was prepared to wade through mud and blood
that he might redeem the world.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI - CHABOT TRIUMPHANT</h2>

<p>"In future, Fran&ccedil;ois, you will have faith in me, I
think."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis stood with Chabot in the hall of the
Tuileries, the ante-chamber of the Convention, at the foot of the
great staircase which had run with blood a year ago, the blood
which had washed away the sins of despotism from that erstwhile
abode of tyranny, and fitted it to become the palace of the
national liberators. They stood under the shadow of the statue of
Liberty erected there, symbol of the young republic trampling upon
the ignominies of the overpast age of despots.</p>

<p>Chabot had ascended the tribune that morning to demand the
repeal of the interdict upon the corsairs. He had prepared his
speech with the collaboration of Andr&eacute;-Louis: a masterly
achievement couched in Chabot's best denunciatory vein. He had
denounced everybody denounceable: the reactionaries and foreign
agents at home, the foreign powers still under the yoke of tyranny,
arming their enslaved multitudes to make war upon the children of
Reason and Liberty. It was the sacred duty of all patriots to make
war upon that hydra of despotism whenever it reared any of its
hideous heads, to attack it at every point where it was vulnerable,
to bleed it white, so that its obscene form should no longer sprawl
athwart a tortured world, so that its foul breath should no longer
poison long-suffering humanity. That was at once a
mission&mdash;the mission of encompassing a rule of universal
brotherhood&mdash;and an act of self-defence. It could be opposed
only by vile reactionaries and insidious counterrevolutionaries. He
would welcome this opposition, for it would disclose the heads that
were ripe for the National scythe.</p>

<p>With that formidable threat he stayed opposition before it was
raised.</p>

<p>Then he passed on. He pointed out the vulnerability of their
enemies upon the seas. The ships of the Bourbon who ruled in Spain
and Naples, and whose subsidies maintained abroad the French
members of that evil brood, plied the Mediterranean. Austrians
sailed there, too, a menace to the shores of France. Even more
insidious the keels of the papal galleys ploughed those waters,
manned by the myrmidons of a pestilential church, whose poisonous
doctrines had for centuries held the souls of men in bondage.</p>

<p>To make war upon these, to conduct against them a holy
crusade&mdash;if he might employ a word of such evil associations
in connection with an aim so lofty and pure&mdash;a group of
enlightened patriots, whose first motive was the service of the
Republic One and Indivisible, had equipped, armed and manned a
fleet of vessels. An interdict had been placed upon these ships,
upon the ground that their aim was robbery, and that robbery, being
an act of anti-civism, was not to be countenanced by an enlightened
Republic. Oh, what a sophistry was here! How the shadow of evil was
employed to obscure the substance of the good. How were men, even
the best-intentioned, betrayed by narrow views!</p>

<p>You conceive the remainder of this turgid harangue. The
Convention listened, was moved to shame of itself for the decree
that it had passed. It might even have been moved to express its
condemnation of Delaunay for having demanded this decree, had not
Delaunay, in anticipation and self-defence, abased himself in frank
acknowledgment of his error as soon as the thunders of applause had
ceased to roll in acclamation of Chabot's address. They came not
only from the body of legislators, but from the galleries thronged
with sectionaries, the women from the markets, the men from the
gutter, the riff-raff of Paris which nowadays&mdash;ever since the
fall of the Girondins&mdash;crowded there to keep an eye on the
National representatives and to see that they discharged their
duties properly.</p>

<p>Never had Chabot enjoyed a greater triumph, and the noise would
be ringing even now in the ears of all Paris, borne from the hall
of the Convention by the rabble which had acclaimed him.</p>

<p>The man to whom he owed so much, who had persuaded him against
his every inclination to undertake this task, was justified of his
belief that Chabot would have faith in him in future.</p>

<p>The ex-capuchin, untidily dressed, his red cap pressed upon his
unkempt brown curls, stood flushed before him, with a sparkle in
his eyes, a suspicion of swagger in the carriage of his compact
figure, his dimpled chin held high above the soiled cravat so
loosely knotted that it left bare his muscular throat.</p>

<p>"Faith in you? It needed only that your arguments should be
clearly presented. I am never slow, Moreau, to perceive where lies
the interest of the people. That is my strength." And he passed on,
strutting with self-sufficiency.</p>

<p>De Batz materialized out of the crowd that filled the hall and
reached Andr&eacute;-Louis' side. He pointed with his cane.</p>

<p>"The Citizen-Representative carries his nose in the air."</p>

<p>"Sic itur ad astra," said Andr&eacute;-Louis. "He'll walk so now
with his gaze on the stars until he comes to the precipice. When he
goes over it he'll carry half the Republic with him."</p>

<p>They were joined by Delaunay, who was out of temper.</p>

<p>"Faith, you burrow and burrow like moles, you two. But what
comes of it?"</p>

<p>"You are impatient," said de Batz. "A vice, Delaunay."</p>

<p>"I am poor," said the deputy, "and I want money. I doubt if
Chabot will ever come into your operations. What need to wait?"</p>

<p>"There is none," said Andr&eacute;-Louis. "Invest all you can
procure in Freys' corsairs, and riches will follow. The
Mediterranean venture has the blessing of Chabot and of the Nation,
and is therefore safe for any patriot."</p>

<p>Junius Frey, aglow with satisfaction, came to join them, and
carried them off to the hospitalities of the Rue d'Anjou.</p>

<p>On their way they came upon Chabot at the corner of the Rue St.
Thomas du Louvre, addressing a crowd that formed a bread-queue
outside a baker's shop. He was haranguing these starvelings upon
republican virtue. He assured them that they suffered in the
noblest of all causes, and that the consciousness of this would
sustain them in these days of tribulation shared by all. He was
promising them that they would emerge into a season of fraternal
ease and plenty so soon as by their fortitude they had crushed the
vile enemies of freedom who sought to break their lofty republican
spirit by subjecting them to these hardships.</p>

<p>Despite their hunger, his fiery eloquence intoxicated them. A
hoarse cry was raised of "Vive Chabot!" and rang in the ears of his
friends as they approached the scene. Waving his red cap to the
famished crowd, Chabot went off, his own mouth watering at the
prospect of the succulent fare that awaited him in the Rue
d'Anjou.</p>

<p>They entered the courtyard, a cool, pleasant place on that day
of oppressive heat, so thick with shrubs as to have almost the
appearance of a little garden. In the middle a fountain played,
adorned by a figure of Liberty in bronze, by which the
ultra-republican Freys had replaced the sylvan god originally
presiding there.</p>

<p>They were merry at table. Chabot, exalted by his success, talked
much and drank more. He said such beautiful things that the Freys
were moved to embrace him, hailing him as the noblest patriot since
Curtius, a man worthy of the highest honours that a grateful nation
could bestow. Chabot embraced them in return. He insisted upon
embracing Andr&eacute;-Louis, by whom he had been inspired, and he
took advantage of this atmosphere of fraternity and republican love
to embrace also the little L&eacute;opoldine, who suffered it in
terror and sat afterwards with lowered eyes in a flaming agony of
shame.</p>

<p>Junius, acting upon a hint from Andr&eacute;-Louis, insisted
upon rewarding him.</p>

<p>"It is but fitting that you should share in the benefits that
will accrue to the Nation from your championship of the cause of
these patriotic corsairs. My brother and I are investing five
hundred <i>louis</i> for you in the venture."</p>

<p>Chabot demurred with great dignity. "A noble action should be
disinterested. Only thus can the motive remain pure."</p>

<p>"The investment these good Freys are making for you," said
Andr&eacute;-Louis, "will be multiplied by ten within six
months."</p>

<p>Chabot permitted himself a mental calculation. Five thousand
<i>louis</i> would be a little fortune. Temptation seized him. He
remembered perhaps the delectable Descoings who had slipped through
his fingers because he lacked the golden cords with which to bind
such a woman to himself, leaving him only the cross-eyed,
sour-tempered Julie Berger to comfort his loneliness. He considered
this generous repast which he had shared, whilst those wretches to
whom he had preached fortitude were tightening their belts in
bread-queues. And Andr&eacute;-Louis, innocent of appearance,
insidious of speech and manner, was driving the temptation
home.</p>

<p>"There is a dignity to be maintained by one who is a leader of
this great nation, and hitherto, Citizen-Representative, you have
lacked the means to maintain it. To such shining qualities, such
lofty altruism and such consuming patriotism as are yours, there is
no need to add the Spartan virtue of frugality."</p>

<p>The bibulous Chabot embraced them all again, with increasing
fervour, and as the little L&eacute;opoldine came last the greatest
fervour of those embraces fell to her. She fled thereafter in
confusion, on the verge of tears, it seemed to
Andr&eacute;-Louis.</p>

<p>Of this he was to have later confirmation. As he was departing
with de Batz, she appeared before them in the courtyard, emerging
from behind a clump of laurel. She was white and trembling.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Moreau," she begged, reverting to the unpatriotic
title in her distress.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis stood still. De Batz, after a glance and a
lift of his heavy brows, went tactfully on towards the wicket.</p>

<p>"I wanted to say, monsieur," she faltered, and here broke down
to begin again. "I hope you...you did not think that I...that I
welcomed the...the liberties of the Citizen Chabot."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis was taken aback. He stared at her, conscious
perhaps for the first time of her comeliness and the appeal of her
youth. He was troubled.</p>

<p>"The Citizen Chabot is a great man in the State, child," he
said, scarcely knowing what he meant.</p>

<p>"What has that to do with it? If he were the King himself it
would make no difference to me."</p>

<p>"I believe it, mademoiselle." He too forgot the rule under which
they lived. Very gently he added: "You are not answerable to me for
your actions."</p>

<p>She looked up at him shyly. Then her eyelids fluttered and her
soft brown eyes were lowered again. "I wanted you to know, Monsieur
Moreau."</p>

<p>He had never felt more utterly at a loss. Chabot's voice
sounded, loud and crowing, behind them on the stairs. She fled in
terror, to vanish again amid the laurels. Andr&eacute;-Louis, in
thankfulness for the interruption, went swiftly on.</p>

<p>Outside the wicket the Baron awaited him, and greeted him with a
searching look.</p>

<p>"It is not only politics that brings you to the Rue d'Anjou, mon
petit," he asserted, his tone sardonic.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis, the eyes of his soul at that moment on the
fair image of Aline de Kercadiou, answered him impatiently.</p>

<p>"You mistake me. I am not given to banalities. The child may
have sensed it in me. What do I know?" He was out of temper.
"Lengthen your stride," he added harshly. "That beast Chabot is
behind. He comes with a bursting belly to admonish starveling
patriots to tighten their belts for the greater glory of this
famine-stricken republic."</p>

<p>"You're bitter in your triumph."</p>

<p>"Triumph! A triumph of foulness over foulness! Those odious,
oily Jews with their greed and their hypocrisy! Chabot, the
convent-rat! Delaunay ready to sell his country that he may
purchase him his woman. And we, fawning upon them, that we may fool
them to their doom."</p>

<p>"If they are as foul as you perceive them, your conscience
should be easy on that score. Besides, there is an end to serve, a
cause to be upheld, which justifies any means."</p>

<p>"It is what I ask myself."</p>

<p>"Name of God, what ails you? Hitherto your calculating
ruthlessness has almost terrified me at moments. Are you
weakening?"</p>

<p>"Weakening?" Andr&eacute;-Louis made a rapid examination of
conscience. "No. I grow impatient. Impatient for the day that sends
the pack of them to the National Barber."</p>

<p>"Faith, then, you have but to proceed as you are doing. The day
is not far distant."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII - MATCHMAKING</h2>

<p>The Citizen-Representative Fran&ccedil;ois Chabot strutted into
his sordid lodgings in the Rue St. Honor&eacute; with the sense of
being by much a greater man than when he had left it that morning
to repair to the Convention. He felt indeed like some lesser Atlas
bearing the French Nation upon his shoulders.</p>

<p>Godlike and truculent, he came into those shabby two rooms and
the presence of Julie Berger. The one and the other offended him.
Here was an incongruous Olympus, an incongruous goddess. He spurned
her fawning greeting and stamped into the middle of the sordid room
to survey it with the eyes of scorn.</p>

<p>"May God damn me," was precisely what he said ("Que Dieu me
damn."), "if I will support this longer."</p>

<p>"What offends you, my cherished one?" quoth the cross-eyed in
conciliatory accents. Although a scold by nature, here instinct
warned her scolding would be out of season.</p>

<p>"What offends me? To the devil with it all, I say!" His left
hand on his hip, his head thrown back, he made a sweeping
comprehensive gesture with his free right arm. "To the devil with
it all! And to the devil with you! Do you know who I am?
Fran&ccedil;ois Chabot, Deputy for Loir-et-Cher in the National
Convention, the wonder of the intellectuals, the idol of the
people, the greatest man in France at this moment. And you ask me
who I am!"</p>

<p>"I did not ask you, my love," she protested mildly, perceiving
that his attack of egomania was unusually violent, and perceiving
also that he was not quite sober. "I know who you are. I know what
a great man you are. Do I not know it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you do?" He eyed the ponderous, sagging body so shabby in
its faded black, the pallid face that was robbed of comeliness by
its squint; he became conscious of the grime upon it, of the
horrid, ill-kempt condition of the brown hair, wisps of which
thrust untidily from her capacious mob-cap. There was almost
dislike of her in that glance of his. "Then, if you know it, how
can you suffer that I should continue in these surroundings. Is
this a dwelling for a representative of the sacred people? These
broken shards, this common furniture, this filthy uncarpeted floor!
All this detracts from the dignity of my office. I owe it to myself
and to the people whom I represent to house myself in dignity."</p>

<p>She tittered venomously. "Why, so you do, my friend. But dignity
costs money."</p>

<p>"Money? What is money?"</p>

<p>"Filth, so you say. But it's useful filth. It brings the things
you lack and I lack. What is the use of being a great man? What's
the use of having people run after you in the street, point you out
to one another, and shout 'Long live Chabot'? What's the use of all
this, my cherished one, when we have no money, when we live like
pigs in a sty?"</p>

<p>"Who says I have no money?" He snorted furiously. "Money! I have
all the money a man desires. It is at my command. I have but to put
forth my hand and take it."</p>

<p>"In the name of God, then, put forth your hand. Let me behold
this miracle."</p>

<p>"It is done. Mine is the purse of Fortunatus, the hand of
Midas."</p>

<p>"Whose purse?" quoth she, wondering had madness this time gone
too far for recovery.</p>

<p>He paced the chamber, his chin in the air, his gestures like
those of an actor at the Th&eacute;atre Fran&ccedil;ais. He talked
volubly, boasted freely. He owned a fleet in the Mediterranean; the
resources of the bank of the Brothers Frey were at his command. He
must be better housed than this, better clothed, better...He broke
off. He had been about to say better accompanied, but a timely
remembrance of her potentialities in venom checked him.</p>

<p>Yet although he did not utter the word, she sensed it, and her
smile changed. It grew bitter and cunning. She sat down to observe
him. Then she uttered words that administered a cold douche to his
exaltation, and brought him to a panic-stricken halt.</p>

<p>"So the Freys have bribed you, eh? They've paid you well to get
a repeal of the decree against their corsairs. Behold your fleet,
my friend."</p>

<p>His eyes stood forward on his face. He made a noise in his
throat like the inarticulate growl of a beast. For a moment she
cowered in terror, believing that he was about to leap upon her.
This indeed was his impulse: to strangle that vile throat of hers
so that never again should it utter such a blasphemy. But prudence
mastered rage. How much did this woman know?</p>

<p>"What's that you say, Jezebel?"</p>

<p>"What I know." She laughed at him, perceiving herself safe
again. "What I know. Do you suppose that I can't read because I am
cross-eyed, or do you suppose my education was neglected?"</p>

<p>"Read? What have you read?"</p>

<p>"The speech that was written for you by somebody; the Freys
belike. Ha, ha! You'd like the people to know that, wouldn't you?
That those foreign Jews put words into your mouth so that you may
seduce the representatives and the people, and that they pay you
for the dirty job. A patriot, you! You! The greatest man in France,
the wonder of the intellectuals, the idol of the people! You!" The
scold's nature had come uppermost. Malice poured from her in a foul
torrent of mockery.</p>

<p>"Silence, harridan!" He was livid. But she saw that he was no
longer dangerous. Pusillanimous she knew him, this woman from whom
he had no secrets, and she saw how fear was sobering and subduing
him.</p>

<p>"I'll not be silent. Not I. Why should I be silent?"</p>

<p>"Because if I have more of this, I'll fling you back into the
street from which I took you."</p>

<p>"So that I may tell the people how you sold yourself to the
Austrian Jews?"</p>

<p>He eyed her with formidable dislike. "Putaine!" With that vile
word he swung aside and went to sit down. He was suddenly limp. He
had nursed a snake in his bosom. This woman might have the will, as
she had the power, to ruin him. He must temporize, conciliate.
Threats could not avail him against one who held all the
weapons.</p>

<p>Meanwhile she raged on. That foul name contemptuously flung had
acted as a goad. Her strident voice&mdash;the voice with which
Nature seems ever to endow the shrew&mdash;shrilled up. It floated
out through the open windows, and could be heard in the street
below. Neighbours paused to listen, smiled and shrugged. The
Citizen-Representative Chabot was at one of his love-scenes with
his borgnesse. He might rule a Nation, but he would never rule that
woman.</p>

<p>He strove to calm her. "Quiet, my dear! In Heaven's name, a
little calm! Sh! The neighbours will hear you! Listen now, my dove!
Listen! I supplicate, my little one!"</p>

<p>Not until she was out of breath, invective momentarily
exhausted, did he really have an opportunity. He seized it, and
talked rapidly. He reasoned. It was not at all as she supposed. He
presented the case to her as the Freys and Andr&eacute;-Louis had
presented it to him. What he had done, he had done from a sense of
duty. The rewards that came to him were rewards that he might take
with an easy mind, and for which he could answer freely before the
tribunal of his conscience.</p>

<p>She listened, sneering. Then perceiving profit perhaps in
accepting these explanations, she ceased to sneer. She
demanded.</p>

<p>"I understand. I understand, my love. You are right. We should
be better housed, better fed, better clad. Look at me. I am in
tatters. Give me ten <i>louis</i>, that I may go and buy myself a
gown to do you credit." She rose and held out her hand.</p>

<p>"In a few days," he answered readily, thankful that the storm
had passed.</p>

<p>"Now," she insisted. "At once. Since you are rich I will not go
in rags a moment longer. Look at this gown. It goes to pieces if
you pull it."</p>

<p>"But I have no money yet. That is to come."</p>

<p>"To come? When?"</p>

<p>"What do I know? In a few days, a few weeks, perhaps."</p>

<p>"A few weeks!" She was shrill again. "Why, what a fool you are,
Chabot! In your place..." She checked.</p>

<p>More cunning than Chabot in the minutiae of life, she perceived
what he had overlooked, the omission which in his place she would
never have been so foolish as to have made. As it was she could
correct it.</p>

<p>Two mornings later she blossomed forth in a new gown, striped
red and black, high-waisted as the fashion was, new shoes and
stockings, and a new mob-cap under which her hair for once was
tidily disposed. The Citizen-Representative opened his eyes, and
demanded explanations. She tittered and was archly mysterious.</p>

<p>"We are not all of us such fools as you, Chabot. I am not one to
go thirsty when there's a well within reach."</p>

<p>That was all that she would tell him, and he went off perplexed,
the mystery unsolved. Junius Frey could have solved it for him, and
had thought of doing so. But upon further reflection the financier
preferred to seek the Citizen Moreau and his friend de Batz, of
whose judgment and ability he had by now been afforded such signal
proof.</p>

<p>He found them at home when Tissot admitted them to their lodging
in the Rue de M&eacute;nars. He made no attempt to minimize his
uneasiness, which indeed scarcely needed expressing, for the signs
of it were in his countenance. He rumbled forth a flood of
lamentations in his deep guttural voice. He announced that they
were sold, betrayed. That puffed-up fool Chabot had allowed their
secret to be discovered. His indiscretion had forged a sword which
was being held over the head of Junius. He was being shamelessly
blackmailed.</p>

<p>"Blackmailed!" It was Andr&eacute;-Louis who stirred to that
word, adducing the whole story from it. "Let me know by whom. I
have a short way with blackmailers."</p>

<p>His grim confidence in himself was inspiring. Frey entered into
explanations. Chabot had a housekeeper&mdash;this was the euphemism
he employed to describe Julie&mdash;who was a traitress. She had
discovered details of the business of the corsairs, and she had
come to him yesterday to demand money.</p>

<p>"Did you give her any?"</p>

<p>"What else could I do? For the moment I have stopped her mouth
with twenty <i>louis</i>."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis shook his head. "Not enough."</p>

<p>"Not enough! Oh, my God! But I am then to give everything away?
Chabot himself has had&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No matter what Chabot has had. You should have given her two
hundred. That would have compromised her. I would have done the
rest for you."</p>

<p>But de Batz joined issue with him. "You can't deal with her as
you dealt with Burlandeux. She is in possession of dangerous
facts."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis retired from the debate, and left it to de
Batz and Junius. They concluded nothing. And this, after. Junius
had gone again, his panic undiminished, de Batz revealed to be
precisely what he desired. He rubbed his hands and laughed.</p>

<p>"The thing is done, I think. Let the fair Julie precipitate the
avalanche."</p>

<p>But Andr&eacute;-Louis was scornful. "Is that your notion of an
avalanche, Jean? Why, it's scarcely a snowball. Let Julie dare to
throw it at the idol of the mob, and her head will pay for her
temerity. I waste no thought on her. I have work to do this
morning. I am to write an article for the Pere Duchesne in praise
of Chabot, for his labours of two days ago." He smiled grimly. "The
higher we hoist him, the heavier the crash when he comes down. And
I have promised H&eacute;bert an article demanding the
expropriation of all foreign property in France. That should be
popular."</p>

<p>You may still read both those articles, the one a paean of
praise, the other a bitter Philippic, both couched in the
flamboyant inflammatory jargon of that Age of Reason, and both
bearing the signature Scaramouche, a nom de guerre which he was
already rendering famous.</p>

<p>De Batz, however, was dubious of the timeliness of the second
article. He accounted it premature, and said so at length. "It will
definitely ruin the Freys, and we may still need them for our
purposes."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis laughed. "It would ruin the Freys if it were
not for Chabot. Chabot will be moved to protect them. Don't you
see? That is the trap in which I hope to take him. Lebrun will help
him. Both will be compromised, and the compromising of two such
prominent conventionals should set up a fine stench for the
people's nostrils."</p>

<p>But de Batz was persuaded that Chabot would take fright, and
leave the Freys to their fate. "The fellow is a poltroon. You are
forgetting that."</p>

<p>"I am forgetting nothing. In the matter of money Chabot has
tasted blood: the merest taste. But it has given him an appetite
for more. He'll not allow the source of it be cut off without a
struggle. Leave this to me, Jean. I see very clearly where I am
going."</p>

<p>De Batz, however, for all his faith in his remorselessly shrewd
and energetic associate, was not reassured. He brooded over the
matter. With brooding his persuasion grew that it would require
stronger bonds than those now binding Chabot to the Freys before
the conventional could be moved to take the risk of defending the
brothers from the proposed decree of expropriation. Here was a
problem for his ready wits. The thought of Julie Berger intruded
upon his brooding, and suddenly he was inspired. The inspiration
took him forthwith to the Rue d'Anjou.</p>

<p>The brothers received the Baron in the green-and-white salon,
over whose elegancies presided an austere bust of Brutus set upon a
tall marble-topped console. Conceiving his visit to be concerned
with this distressing business of the Berger, they enlarged upon it
at once.</p>

<p>"Be easy," the Baron confidently reassured them. "What she can
do at present is less than nothing. She holds no proof. A man in
Chabot's position is not to be destroyed by an unsupported
denunciation. It would recoil upon the head that utters it. If
Julie were to commit this indiscretion, fling this handful of mud
at the popular idol, she would get herself torn to pieces for her
pains. Make that clear to her next time she seeks you, and send her
packing."</p>

<p>Thus he elaborated the opinion conveyed to him in a half-dozen
words by Andr&eacute;-Louis.</p>

<p>The Freys considered the point of view, and were partially
pacified. But only in so far as the past was concerned.</p>

<p>"This time it may be so," said Junius. "But there will always be
danger so long as that evil-disposed woman is about. She may
surprise other secrets. Chabot is not discreet. He drinks too much,
and when he's drunk he's given to boasting. Sooner or later she may
be in a position to ruin him, and, what is worse&mdash;oh, I am
frank with you, citizen&mdash;she will be in a position to ruin
those who are associated with him."</p>

<p>"She must be eliminated," said the Baron, so grimly that it
startled them.</p>

<p>Emmanuel shivered and breathed noisily. Junius stared.
"How?"</p>

<p>"That's to be discovered. But discovered it must be. It is more
important even than you yet realize. For very soon you may be
needing Chabot's support as you have never yet needed it."</p>

<p>That shook them afresh. Scared interrogation was in the eyes of
both. De Batz flung his bombshell.</p>

<p>"It has just come to my knowledge that there is a movement on
foot to demand that the confiscation be decreed of the property of
all foreigners resident in France."</p>

<p>This was terrifying. Emmanuel, in a long shabby coat that added
to his overgrown appearance, stood paralysed, with fallen jaw.
Junius, on the other hand, mixed rage with his panic. He turned
purple and grew voluble. Such a thing would be an outrage. It was
against the comity of nations. It must be the work of madmen. The
Convention would never yield to any such demands.</p>

<p>"The Convention!" In utter frankness de Batz permitted himself
to be scornful. "Are you still under the delusion that the
Convention governs France. It may do. But the mob governs the
Convention. Vox populi, vox dei, my dear Junius. That is the
watchword of the Republic. The mob, directed by the Jacobins and
the Cordeliers, is the real master. H&eacute;bert is to print an
article demanding this expropriation. The demand will be so popular
that the Convention will be powerless to resist it even if it has
the will to do so."</p>

<p>Emmanuel found his quavering voice to demand the source of the
Baron's information.</p>

<p>"That is not important. Accept my word for it that the article
is already written. Within a few days it will be printed and read.
Within a few days again you will see the decree promulgated. That
is inevitable."</p>

<p>Junius accepted conviction. "I suppose that sooner or later it
was inevitable in such a country as this, with a people such as
this." He was bitter about the land of his adoption, this land
which was being swept by the exhilarating and purifying winds of
Liberty.</p>

<p>His conviction shattered Emmanuel's last hopeful doubt. His weak
eyes looked tearfully at his sturdy brother.</p>

<p>"Oh. my God! Oh, my God! This is ruin! Ruin! The end of
everything!"</p>

<p>De Batz agreed with him. "It is certainly grave."</p>

<p>Junius let his anger run free. Furiously he held forth upon his
patriotic sentiments, his republicanism, his services to and his
sacrifices in the holy cause of Liberty. He dwelt upon the
friendships he had formed in the Jacobins and the Convention, spoke
of the national representatives who had been free of his table and
who had enjoyed even to the point of abuse the hospitality which he
dispensed to all true patriots. It was unthinkable that he should
be so ill-requited.</p>

<p>"It's an ungrateful world," de Batz reminded him. "Fortunately I
am able to warn you in time."</p>

<p>"In time? In time for what? You mock me, I think. What measures
can I take?"</p>

<p>"You have a stout friend in Chabot."</p>

<p>"Chabot! That poltroon!" Wrath was rendering Junius
illuminatingly frank.</p>

<p>"He served you well in the matter of the corsair fleet."</p>

<p>"He had to be driven to it, simple as it was. How should we
drive him now, and if the decree is passed what can he do? Even
he?"</p>

<p>"True, he would be powerless, then. You must act before the
decree is promulgated."</p>

<p>"Act!" Junius strode wildly about the room on his sturdy legs.
"How can I act? What is in your mind, Citizen de Batz?"</p>

<p>"Make his interests one with your own, so that he rises or falls
with you. Oh, a moment. I have given this matter thought for
naturally it interests me too. If you sink, my friend Moreau and I
will suffer heavily in our investments with you. This is no time
for half measures, unless you are prepared to see all your wealth
absorbed into the national treasury, and yourselves cast naked upon
the world. Chabot can save you if you can arouse in him the courage
and the will to do so."</p>

<p>"Heiliger Gott! Tell me how it is to be done. How? There's the
difficulty."</p>

<p>"No difficulty at all. Bind Chabot to you in bonds that will
make your cause his own, and so compel him for his own sake to
champion it."</p>

<p>"Where am I to find such bonds?" demanded Junius at the height
of exasperation.</p>

<p>"In God's name where?" cried Emmanuel, wagging his narrow
head.</p>

<p>"They are under your hand. The only question is will you care to
employ them.</p>

<p>"That would not be the question. I should like to know what
bonds I possess that I would not employ in such an extremity."</p>

<p>de Batz tapped his snuff-box and proffered it. Junius swept the
courtesy aside by an impatient gesture; Emmanuel declined by a
gentle shrinking. They were breathing hard in their impatience. But
the Gascon was not to be hurried. Between poised finger and thumb,
delicately, he held the pinch.</p>

<p>"Chabot is fortunately unmarried. You have an eminently
marriageable and very attractive sister. Have you not observed that
Chabot is susceptible to the attraction? This may offer a means to
save your fortune."</p>

<p>Smiling quietly upon their stupefaction, he snapped down the lid
of his snuff-box with the thumb of one band, whilst with the other
he bore the pinch to his nostrils.</p>

<p>Junius, his feet planted wide, his dark brows knit, stood
glowering at him in silence. It was Emmanuel who first found his
voice.</p>

<p>"Not that! Not little L&eacute;opoldine! Ah, that...that is too
much. Too much!"</p>

<p>But de Batz paid no heed to him. He knew that decision lay with
the elder brother, and that no merely emotional explosions from
Emmanuel would influence it. He dusted some fragments of snuff from
his cravat, and waited.</p>

<p>At last Junius growled a question. "Is Chabot in this? Have you
discussed it with him?"</p>

<p>De Batz shook his head. "He is not even aware that the decree is
to be demanded. And he should be kept in ignorance until you have
him fast. That is why it is necessary to act quickly."</p>

<p>"Why should you suppose that he will agree?"</p>

<p>"I have seen the way he looks at your sister."</p>

<p>"The way he looks at her! That satyr! It's the way he looks at
every woman. The result of a monastic education."</p>

<p>"But L&eacute;opoldine!" Emmanuel was complaining. "You could
not contemplate it, Junius."</p>

<p>"Of course not. Besides, what could it avail us in the end? And
we do not even know that Chabot desires a wife."</p>

<p>"The desire might be quickened." De Batz sat back in his chair,
crossing his legs. "A dowry might determine the matter. It need not
be exorbitant. Chabot's views of money are still comparatively
modest. Say a couple of hundred thousand francs."</p>

<p>Junius exploded. His visitor must suppose that his supplies were
inexhaustible. He had to pay here and pay there and pay everywhere.
He could not move without paying. He was growing tired of it.</p>

<p>"If you let things take their course, you'll have no more
troubles of that kind," said the sardonic de Batz. "After all, you
must one day be marrying your sister, and you will have to provide
her with a dowry. Could you possibly marry her to greater advantage
than to one who is already almost the first man in France, and may
soon stand firmly in that position? Think of your republican
sentiments, my friend."</p>

<p>Suspecting mockery, Junius eyed him not without malevolence.</p>

<p>"But Chabot!" Emmanuel was bleating in horror. "Chabot!"</p>

<p>"Bah!" said Junius at length. "What, after all, can the marriage
profit us? Shall we be foreigners any the less when it is made?
Shall we be the less liable to these expropriations?"</p>

<p>De Batz smiled the smile of superior shrewdness. "Evidently you
have not perceived the possibilities. It might, indeed, be that the
brothers-in-law of a representative of Chabot's consequence would
never be regarded as foreigners; that no legislation against
foreign property could be understood to include theirs. This may
come to be the case. But I have something more solid and assured
for you."</p>

<p>"You will need to have, by Heaven!"</p>

<p>"Once your sister is married to Chabot, she, at least, will have
ceased to be a foreigner. Marriage will bestow upon her the French
nationality of her distinguished husband. Her funds will be in no
danger of confiscation whatever happens. Do you see how simple it
becomes? You transfer to her&mdash;to her and Chabot&mdash;all your
possessions, and that is the end of your difficulties."</p>

<p>"The end of my difficulties!" Junius' deep voice went shrill in
protest. "You tell me that will be the end of my difficulties! I am
to make over all my property to my sister, to my sister and her
husband Chabot, and that makes me safe, does it? But at that rate,
my friend, I might as well suffer confiscation."</p>

<p>De Batz waved a hand to quiet him. "You assume too much. The
transference I suggest need not amount to the surrender of a single
franc. I have thought it out. In the marriage contract you enter
into an engagement to pay Chabot's wife over a term of years
certain sums which in the aggregate will amount to your total
present possessions. Don't interrupt me, or we shall never be done.
Such an engagement, absorbing all you possess, will leave nothing
available for confiscation."</p>

<p>Junius could contain himself no longer. "You substitute one form
of confiscation by another. Fine advice, as God lives!"</p>

<p>"I do nothing of the kind. Observe my words more closely. I say
that you enter into an engagement to pay. I did not say that you
actually pay."</p>

<p>"Oh! And the difference?"</p>

<p>"The engagement is of no effect. You engage to donate. Now a
donation, under our existing laws, is valid only if formally
accepted. L&eacute;opoldine being a minor has no legal power to
accept. The donation must be accepted for her by a guardian or
trustee. You will overlook this legal necessity, and you may rest
assured that the omission will never be noticed. Whilst, then,
leaving the donation without validity, so that neither Chabot nor
your sister could ever claim fulfilment, it will, nevertheless,
create the appearances necessary to place your fortune beyond the
reach of confiscation. That, my good friends, is the way to save
it. And it is the only way."</p>

<p>It was indeed, as Junius at last perceived. A guttural German
oath was his intimation that the light of this revelation had
momentarily dazzled him.</p>

<p>"Oh, but L&eacute;opoldine! My little L&eacute;opoldine!"
Emmanuel was quavering in tearful protest.</p>

<p>Savagely Junius turned upon him. "Don't distract me with your
bleating." He took a turn in the room, and came to a halt with his
shoulders to the overmantel and the clock of S&egrave;vres biscuit.
The earlier gloom had passed from his face. There was a lively
keenness in his dark eyes. Thoughtfully he stroked his long,
pendulous nose. "It is the way. Undoubtedly it is the way," he
muttered. "Oh, but one cannot hesitate to take it, provided that
Chabot..."</p>

<p>"I will answer for Chabot. The prospect of so much wealth will
bring him to your will. Be sure of that. If more is necessary
remind him that the looseness of his frequent amours is putting a
weapon into the hands of his enemies. The day of aristocratic vice
is overpast. The people demands purity of life in its
representatives. He must not lie exposed to scandal. It is time he
sought refuge from it in matrimony. That is the second argument.
The third is L&eacute;opoldine herself."</p>

<p>Junius nodded his big head. Emmanuel regarded him in distress
without daring to protest again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII - L&Eacute;OPOLDINE</h2>

<p>The Baron de Batz came back to the Rue de M&eacute;nars, to find
Andr&eacute;-Louis in shirt sleeves, writing the closing words of
his encomium on Chabot. He was in high spirits, the result of
fruitful concentration.</p>

<p>"I have endowed Fran&ccedil;ois Chabot with all the virtues of
Brutus, Cicero, and Lycurgus." There was a sparkle in the dark
eyes, a flush on the lean face as he flung down his pen. "A great
morning's work!"</p>

<p>But de Batz accounted his own labours of greater consequence.
"Whilst you have been merely praising Chabot, I have been marrying
him."</p>

<p>With a touch of pride he reported his transaction with the
Freys. He was met by stark dismay.</p>

<p>"You have done this? Without consulting me?"</p>

<p>De Batz was not only disappointed of the praise for which he had
looked; he was piqued.</p>

<p>"Without consulting you? Am I to consult you upon every step I
take?"</p>

<p>"It would be more prudent, and more courteous. I have consulted
you at every step."</p>

<p>There was argument upon this, and it began to assume a tone of
acerbity. De Batz set himself to point out all the advantages which
this marriage must bring to the campaign they were conducting.
Andr&eacute;-Louis broke in upon these indications.</p>

<p>"I know all that. I perceive it all. But the means! It is with
the means that I am quarrelling. There is a limit to those we may
employ. A limit imposed by decency, which no cynicism may
overstep.</p>

<p>"On my soul, this comes well from you. You shrink from cynicism?
You? Why, what the devil ails you?"</p>

<p>"We'll play this game without using that unfortunate child as a
pawn in it."</p>

<p>De Batz passed from amazement to amazement. "Of what account is
she?"</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis smote the table with his open palm. "She has
a soul. I do not traffic in souls."</p>

<p>"I could tell you of others who possess souls. Others whom you
hound relentlessly. Has Chabot no soul, or Delaunay, or Julien, or
the Freys, or that fellow Burlandeux whom you sent to the
guillotine without a twinge of conscience? Or Julie Berger, with
whom you would have dealt in the same way?"</p>

<p>"Those persons are vile. I give them what they seek. Burlandeux
wanted blood. He got it. His own. But why quibble? Will you compare
the beasts we are engaged in exterminating with this poor
inoffensive child?"</p>

<p>And now de Batz, remembering a moment in the courtyard of the
Rue d'Anjou, broke into laughter and derision.</p>

<p>"I see, I see! The little partridge, as Chabot calls her, was to
be preserved for you. I am sorry, my friend. But we are the
servants of a cause that admits of no such personal
considerations."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis came to his feet. He was white with anger.
"Another word in this strain, and we quarrel, Jean."</p>

<p>Swift as lightning came the peppery Gascon's riposte: "That is a
thing I never avoid."</p>

<p>Their breathing slightly quickened, they eyed each other with
defiance whilst a man might count to twelve. Andr&eacute;-Louis was
the first to master himself. He turned aside.</p>

<p>"This way lies madness, Jean. It is not for you and me,
surrounded as we are by dangers any one of which may at any moment
send either of us to the guillotine, to set up a quarrel."</p>

<p>"The word was yours," said the Baron.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was. You stung me with your imputation of base
motives. It seemed an offence less against me than against someone
who is to me an inspiration. To imply that I should be wanting in
fidelity..." He broke off. De Batz was surveying him with a
surprise that was faintly cynical. "It is the thought of her, who
is pure and spotless, as I am sure is this poor child of the Freys,
that makes the prospect horrible. If there were any such conspiracy
against my Aline! I contemplate the agony to her, and grow the more
conscious of the agony involved for little L&eacute;opoldine. She
must not be a pawn in this game, Jean. She must not be a victim of
our intrigues. She must not be part of the price at which we are to
purchase the head of Chabot for the advancement of the House of
Bourbon. We are on the fringe of infamy. And I will have no part in
it, or countenance it."</p>

<p>De Batz heard him out with tightening lips and narrowing eyes,
his Gascon temper roused by this unexpected opposition, this
hostility to a piece of strategy in which he had been taking pride.
But he curbed his feelings. As Andr&eacute;-Louis had said, the
circumstances surrounding them were too dangerous to admit of their
quarrelling between themselves. The matter must be settled by
argument. De Batz must adopt conciliation.</p>

<p>"No need to harangue me at such lengths, Andr&eacute;. I am
sorry if my thought offended you, and I am relieved that your
interest in the girl is not personal. That would have been a
serious obstacle."</p>

<p>"Not more serious than it is."</p>

<p>"Ah, wait. You have insufficiently considered. You have lost
sight of the aim. Great ends are not to be served without
sacrifice. If we are to let emotion or sentiment govern us, we
should never have set our hands to this task. It is not for
ourselves that we labour. We are here to rescue a whole people from
damnation, to recover a throne for its rightful owners, and to
bring back to France the best of her children who have been driven
into exile. Are we to boggle over the sacrifice of an insignificant
little foreign Jewess in the course of a scheme which may send a
hundred heads to the guillotine? Can we be nice? Will you remember
that we are kingmakers?"</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis knew that there was no answer save on the
grounds of sentiment. But so repugnant was the vision of that pure,
innocent child being flung in prey to the loathsome, crapulous,
blood-stained ex-capuchin, that Andr&eacute;-Louis could not harden
himself against it.</p>

<p>"It may all be as you say," he answered. "And yet this thing
shall not be. It will recoil upon us. Evil will come of it. I have
been ruthless, as you say. At moments my ruthlessness has left you
aghast. But I am not ruthless enough for this. It is too foul."</p>

<p>Still de Batz kept a tight grip upon his restive patience. "Oh,
I admit the foulness. But there are other foulnesses to be
combated, to be avoided. We want no repetitions of the September
massacres, and such horrors. For that you never hesitated to lay a
train that will end in bringing a score of Girondin heads under the
knife of the guillotine. They are fine heads, too. Yet you quibble
about this child of no account. We cannot be selective in our
means. This is the only certain way, and I have taken it."</p>

<p>"It is not the only way. Others would have been found as
effective. It was only a question of patience."</p>

<p>"Patience! Patience, when the Queen is languishing, tortured and
insulted in prison, and may at any moment be haled forth to trial
and ignominious death, together with her children? Patience, when
the little King of France is in the hands of assassins who are
ill-treating him and brutalizing him? Don't you see that it is a
race between us and the forces of evil that are at work to destroy
those sacred members of the royal family? And you can talk of
patience! You yield to gusty emotion over a negligible girl, to
whom we do no worse wrong than thrust her into a wedlock to which
she may at first be reluctant. Where is your sense of proportion,
Andr&eacute;?"</p>

<p>"In my conscience," he was fiercely answered. "I am not
responsible for the sufferings of the Queen, and I..."</p>

<p>"You will be responsible for their protraction beyond what is
necessary if you neglect any means to curtail them."</p>

<p>"The Queen herself would not desire her freedom, her safety, at
this evil price."</p>

<p>"As a mother and a queen she must desire that of her children at
any price."</p>

<p>"It remains that this price is one which my conscience will not
suffer me to pay. It is idle to argue with me, Jean. I will not
suffer it to be done."</p>

<p>"You will not suffer it? You?" And then, quite suddenly, de Batz
broke into a laugh. He had seen something to which anger had been
blinding him.</p>

<p>"You will not suffer it!" he cried yet again, but on an entirely
different note, a note of unalloyed derision. "Prevent it then, my
friend."</p>

<p>"That is my intention."</p>

<p>"And how will you accomplish it?"</p>

<p>"I shall go to the Freys at once."</p>

<p>"To ask for L&eacute;opoldine's hand in marriage for yourself?
Not even so would you prevent it, unless you could inspire them
with a faith in yourself greater than their faith in Chabot. Why,
you fool, Andr&eacute;! Do you dream that those avid Jews, faced
with destitution and starvation unless they take prompt measures to
entrench themselves, are going to allow any scruples about
L&eacute;opoldine to check them? Faith! You are amusing, do you
know? You are moved to a tenderness for their sister greater than
that which they feel themselves, and this with no intention to make
her either your mistress or your wife. Do you begin to see that you
are ridiculous?"</p>

<p>"It does not make me ridiculous simply to be less foul than
those about me."</p>

<p>"In which you include me, no doubt. Well, well, I'll suffer it.
I must allow something to your knight-errant's chagrin."</p>

<p>"I'll prevent it somehow, God helping me."</p>

<p>"It will tax your quixotry, short of murdering Chabot, which
would merely bring you to the guillotine. You are beating your head
against a wall of sentiment, mon petit. Leave it. Ours is a serious
mission. Sacrifices there must be. At any moment we may be
sacrificed ourselves. Does not that justify us of everything?"</p>

<p>"It cannot justify us of this. And I will have no part in it."
He was vehement.</p>

<p>De Batz ill-humouredly shrugged his shoulders and turned
away.</p>

<p>"So be it. There is no need why you should have part in it. The
train is laid. Not all your efforts could now stamp it out. Salve
your conscience with that. The rest will happen of itself."</p>

<p>It was true enough. It was happening even then. For in his panic
Junius allowed no time to be lost. And Fate conspired with de Batz
by sending Chabot to dine with the Freys that day after the sitting
of the Convention.</p>

<p>L&eacute;opoldine was in her usual place at table, flushing and
uncomfortable, her pudicity affronted by the increasingly ardent
oglings of Chabot, her flesh creeping when he pawed her soft round
arm and leered into her eyes as he called her his little partridge.
Once before Emmanuel, observing this amorousness in the
ex-capuchin, had proposed to his brother that L&eacute;opoldine
should not be brought to table when Chabot was present, and Junius
had been disposed to adopt the suggestion. But to-day things were
different. Symptoms which previously had dismayed Emmanuel and
annoyed Junius were now not welcomed.</p>

<p>When the meal was done, and Chabot sat back replete and at ease,
his greasy redingote unbuttoned, Junius opened the attack.
L&eacute;opoldine had gone about her household duties, and the
three men sat alone. Emmanuel was nervous and fidgety. Junius
stolid as an Eastern idol for all his inner anxieties.</p>

<p>"You have a housekeeper, Chabot."</p>

<p>"So I have," said Chabot with disgust.</p>

<p>"She is dangerous. You must get rid of her. One of these days
she will sell you. She has been to demand a present from me, as the
price of her silence upon our transactions with the corsairs. That
is not a woman to retain about you."</p>

<p>Chabot was disturbed. He cursed her roundly and obscenely. She
was a vile baggage; insolent and ill-natured. It was only wanting
that she should turn blackmailer as well.</p>

<p>"But, after all, what can I do?"</p>

<p>"You can send her packing before she is in a position seriously
to compromise you. Such a woman is unworthy of association with a
republican of your integrity."</p>

<p>Chabot scratched his unkempt head and grunted. "All that is very
true. Unfortunately the association has already gone rather far.
You may not have observed that she is about to become a
mother."</p>

<p>It was a momentary set-back for Junius. But only momentary.</p>

<p>"All the more reason to get rid of her."</p>

<p>"You don't understand. She asserts that I am the father of this
future patriot."</p>

<p>"Is it true?" came the quavering voice of Emmanuel.</p>

<p>Chabot blew out his cheeks, and raised his shoulders; he
inflated his chest. The impeachment was not one that in any case
would have disturbed him. "I am like that. What use to inveigh
against it? It is no more than human, I suppose. I was never built
for celibacy."</p>

<p>"You should take a wife," said Junius sternly.</p>

<p>"I have thought about it."</p>

<p>"At the moment it would afford you a sound pretext for ridding
yourself of that squinting beldame. You cannot keep a wife and a
mistress under the same roof. Even the Berger must recognize that,
and so she may be less vindictive than if you put her in the street
for any other reason."</p>

<p>Chabot was scared. "But you've said that she is blackmailing you
with her knowledge of that corsair transaction." He got up,
upsetting his chair in his perturbation. "May God damn me, I knew I
was engaging in a dangerous business. I should have sent you all to
the devil before ever I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Calm, man! Calm!" Junius thundered. "Was ever anything achieved
by panic? Of what can she accuse you, after all? Are you so poorly
regarded that the breath of a vindictive woman can blow you away?
Where are her proofs of what she asserts? You have but to say that
she lies, and the National Barber will do the rest. A little
firmness, my friend. That is all you need. Show her plainly what
will be the consequences of denouncing you."</p>

<p>Chabot took courage.</p>

<p>"You are right, Junius. A patriot of my integrity, a servant of
the nation, a pillar of the Republic such as I am is not to be
dismissed upon the word of a jealous harridan. If she dares to
attempt such a disservice to France, it will be my duty to immolate
her upon the altar of Liberty."</p>

<p>"Spoken like a Roman," Junius commended him. "Yours is the true
spirit, Chabot. I am proud to be your friend."</p>

<p>The egregious ex-capuchin bolted the outrageous flattery. He
threw back his head in proud consciousness of his worth.</p>

<p>"And I'll be guided by you, Junius. I will take a wife."</p>

<p>"My friend!" Junius rose, and went to enfold the representative
in his powerful arms. "My friend! It is what I have hoped and
desired. Thus the spiritual fraternity that already unites us
through the republican sentiments we share will be strengthened by
this carnal bond." Symbolically he tightened an embrace which was
already rendering the flabby Chabot a little out of breath. "My
friend! My brother!" He loosed him and turned to the younger Frey.
"Embrace him, Emmanuel. Take him to your heart in body as you have
already done in spirit."</p>

<p>The lanky Emmanuel complied. Chabot's breathlessness was
increased by astonishment. Something here seemed to have been
assumed, and he did not discern what.</p>

<p>"Our little L&eacute;opoldine will be overjoyed," said Junius.
"Overjoyed."</p>

<p>"Your little L&eacute;opoldine?" Chabot was in a dream.</p>

<p>Junius, his head on one side, was smiling benignly upon the
representative.</p>

<p>"Millionaires and noblemen have asked for the hand of my sister,
and they have been refused. The ci-devant Duke of Chartres might
sue for her, and even if he were a patriot, instead of a vile
aristocrat, he should not win her. If you do not take her, Chabot,
nobody in France shall have her."</p>

<p>Chabot's amazement became stupefaction. "But..." he stammered.
"But I...I have no fortune...I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Junius interrupted him. The rich voice was raised in
vehemence.</p>

<p>"Fortune? If you had that, you would not be the pure patriot
that you are, which is why I account you worthy of my sister. She
will be well dowered, Chabot. Two hundred thousand livres, so that
there may be no change in the mode of life to which we have
accustomed her. And on her wedding day we will give up to her these
apartments. You shall come and live here with her. Emmanuel and I
will remove ourselves to the floor above. Thus all arranges
itself."</p>

<p>Chabot's eyes looked as if they would drop from his face. Here,
at long last, was the reward of virtue! Not for nothing had he
trodden the flinty path of duty. Not for nothing had he set his
hand to the plough of reform and toiled in such self-abnegation for
the good of humanity and of France. His labours were at last to
yield the wages due. Two hundred thousand livres, a handsome
lodging, and the little partridge, so plump and soft and meek.</p>

<p>When, the shock of surprise being spent, he was able to assure
himself that all this was real, that he was not passing through a
dream, he had an impulse to fall on his knees and return thanks to
the betrayed God of his early days. But his stout republican spirit
saved him in time from such a heresy against the newly-adopted
Goddess of Reason who governed this enlightened Age of Liberty.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX - THE BAIT</h2>

<p>If to Chabot the prospect of marriage was a dream, to
L&eacute;opoldine, when she was informed of it, it was a
nightmare.</p>

<p>For the first time in her docile young life she was in rebellion
against the will of the masterful brother who was so much her
senior. She would not marry the Citizen-Representative. She
announced it flatly. To describe that august personage she employed
such terms as hateful, detestable, repellent. He was not even
clean, and she knew that he was not good.</p>

<p>They argued. She passed from indignant resistance to dismay when
she perceived for how little her own wishes were to count. Finally
she came to intercession and tears.</p>

<p>Emmanuel was so moved that he wept with her. But the Roman
fibres of the sterner Junius remained unshaken. Aware that the weak
points in her defences were her gentle kindliness of spirit and her
sense of duty, he directed his attack upon these. He told her the
truth. Ruin stared them in the face. Their only chance of evading
it lay in this marriage. She, at least, would no longer be a
foreigner, and to her they would transfer the greater part of their
possessions, nominally as her dowry, actually to be held in trust
for them by her and her husband.</p>

<p>By coming to live with them, Chabot would render their fine
house in the Rue d'Anjou his domicile, and none would dare to lay
impious hands upon the domicile of that august representative of
the sovereign people.</p>

<p>So far Junius was frank with his sister. Where he practised
deception was in pretending that the representative had sought her
hand. In such a time of peril far from daring to reject the suit of
a statesman of Chabot's eminence, he had welcomed it as a
Heaven-sent chance to save themselves and to save her at the same
time. For what must her fate be if they were ruined?</p>

<p>He passed on to speak of Chabot. The man might be a little rough
externally, but this could be improved. To so ardent a lover a hint
of how to render himself more acceptable to his mistress would
suffice. For the rest that rough exterior covered a noble, kindly
soul, aflame with republican zeal. Had it been otherwise could she
suppose that Junius would ever have consented to sacrifice her? All
was not gold that glittered, and much that did not glitter was
gold.</p>

<p>If all the arguments he summoned could not suffice to conquer
her repugnance, at least they defeated her opposition. If
thereafter she was not resigned, at least she was submissive,
regarding herself as a suitable sacrificial victim for the
salvation of her brothers.</p>

<p>But there was one whom she desired should know the truth.
Perhaps she hoped that the knowledge might move him to work some
miracle for her deliverance.</p>

<p>And so on the morrow Andr&eacute;-Louis received the following
pathetic little note:</p>

<blockquote><i>Citizen Andr&eacute;-Louis,</i><br>
<br>

<p><i>My brother Junius tells me that I must marry the
Citizen-Representative Chabot. That this is necessary for our
security. I care nothing for my security. I would not buy it at
this price, as I hope you will believe, Citizen Andr&eacute;-Louis.
But I must care for the security of my brothers. I suppose this is
my duty. Women are the slaves of duty. But I do not love the
Citizen Chabot. I think I am greatly to be pitied. I want you to
know this. Good-bye, Citizen Andr&eacute;-Louis.</i><br>
<br>
</p>

<p><i>The unhappy L&eacute;opoldine.</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis laid the letter before de Batz. "You perceive
the appeal between the lines," he said, his countenance dark.</p>

<p>De Batz read, sighed and shrugged. "What can I do? If the
sacrifice could have been avoided I should have avoided it. I am no
butcher of chickens. You know that I should not hesitate to
sacrifice myself. Let that be my justification for consenting to
sacrifice another."</p>

<p>"It is no justification. You are master of yourself. Your fate
is in your own hands."</p>

<p>"Is any man's fate in his own hands? Besides, it is the fate of
a people that is concerned." His voice grew harshly imperious.
"Ruthlessness becomes a sacred duty."</p>

<p>"What reply am I to make?"</p>

<p>"None. That will be kindest. The poor child seems to hope that
she is something to you. In that hope she writes. Your silence will
dispel it. She will the more readily submit to her destiny."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis, seated dejectedly on the striped settee,
took his head in his hands. "That foul capuchin," he groaned. "As
God lives he shall bitterly repent it."</p>

<p>"Of course he will. But he is no more responsible than the girl
herself. In a sense he is as much a victim, although he does not
yet perceive of what. But he will."</p>

<p>"And the Freys? These inhuman brothers who for the sake of their
own profit throw their sister to that beast?"</p>

<p>"They shall also repent. Take comfort in that."</p>

<p>"And you, then? You who are responsible for it all?"</p>

<p>"I?" Erect and tense, de Batz looked at him with brooding eyes.
"I am in God's hands. At least, however impure the course I take, I
take it from no impurity of motive. I serve an idea, not myself. In
this I am purer than you are. Perhaps on that account I am immune
from the scruples that trouble you."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis thought of Aline, of his hopes of her which
were the mainspring of his share in these tortuous activities. To
bring his hopes to fruition he was prepared to go to almost any
lengths, but not to the length of sacrificing an innocent child to
the evil lust of that beast Chabot. Aline herself would shrink from
him in horror, her purity outraged, if she thought him capable of
adopting such means to reach her. Yet, as de Batz had pointed out,
he was powerless now to prevent this thing.</p>

<p>The anger surging in him from that impotence came to be
concentrated on Chabot. Because of L&eacute;opoldine he would
pursue him the more ruthlessly, and already he perceived the means
by which he could discredit and smash him utterly.</p>

<p>He was in that mood of vindictiveness when later in the day he
was visited by Delaunay and Julien.</p>

<p>De Batz was absent, and Andr&eacute;-Louis sat, pencil in hand,
at his writing-table on which there was a litter of papers. He sat
in shirt and breeches and with the venetians closed to exclude the
sunlight, for the early September day was stiflingly hot. He was at
work on the details of the scheme which he had conceived for the
speedy ruin of Chabot. Delaunay came to issue something in the
nature of an ultimatum. He and Julien desired to know when the
operations in &eacute;migr&eacute; property on a large scale were
to take place. Months had gone since first the matter had been
mooted, and so far little had been done. They had been guided
entirely by the wishes of the Citizen de Batz. But unless there
were some prospect of real activity they proposed to operate
independently.</p>

<p>"And thereby run your heads into the lunette of the guillotine."
Andr&eacute;-Louis lounged in his chair, one leg thrown over the
arm of it, and looked up at them with a mocking eye. "Well, well!
To be sure they are your own heads, and you may do as you please
with them."</p>

<p>"Will you tell me for what we are waiting?" Delaunay asked, his
habitual stolidity unimpaired by the young man's raillery.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis tapped the writing-table with his pencil.
"The ground is still insufficiently prepared. Chabot has not yet
been persuaded to come into the enterprise."</p>

<p>"To Hell with Chabot!" said Julien fervently.</p>

<p>"By all means," Andr&eacute;-Louis agreed. "But not until we
have done with him. You forget that his eminence is to be our
shield. You are too impatient. Difficult enterprises are to be
prepared slowly and executed quickly. That is the way to succeed in
them."</p>

<p>Delaunay fell to grumbling in his deep, slow voice. "Devil take
it all! At this rate it will be next summer before we may look for
the harvest."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis was thoughtful, his half-closed eyes upon the
papers on the table before him. He unhooked his leg from the arm of
his chair, and sat up.</p>

<p>"You are pressed, eh, Delaunay? The Descoings begins to find
your promises lean fare? She is impatient of more solid
nourishment? If that's your trouble, I have here something else,
something that offers an immediate return."</p>

<p>"That's the proposal for me," said Julien.</p>

<p>"And, faith, for me. What is it?"</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis expounded briefly a scheme which for some
days now had been engaging his attention. It concerned the India
Company&mdash;the Compagnie des Indes&mdash;one of the few
commercial enterprises in France whose credit had remained
unimpaired by the upheaval of the Revolution.</p>

<p>"Under the law of the Eighth Frimaire of the Year One the shares
of a Company become subject to the payment of certain dues on the
occasion of each transfer of ownership. Have you observed that the
India Company has been evading this law? I see that you haven't.
You want to grow rich, yet you don't know where to look for wealth.
The Company, let me tell you, has replaced its shares by bonds
similar to those issued by the State. Of these no transfers are
required. All that is necessary is accomplished by a simple entry
in the Company's register. Thus the tax is successfully
evaded."</p>

<p>He took up a sheet that was covered with figures. "It's a simple
form of fraud, and its success lies in its simplicity. I have
computed that as a result the State has already been swindled of
over two millions."</p>

<p>He paused, and looked up at the representatives, who stared back
at him in round-eyed silence, until at last Delaunay broke out:</p>

<p>"But how the devil are we to profit by that?"</p>

<p>"By denouncing the fraud in the Convention, and foreshadowing
some decree that will sow terror in the hearts of the
shareholders."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"The price of the stock will fall to nothing. That will be your
time to buy it. After you have bought, you will frame the decree.
Indeed, you may frame two decrees: one that will completely ruin
the Company, and another that will deal indulgently with its
transgression. You will then give the directors to choose between
the two. You offer the indulgent one at a certain price&mdash;say,
a quarter of a million. With ruin as the only alternative, the
directors must pay. Then, with the restoration of confidence, the
shares will quickly rise again. You sell at twenty, fifty, perhaps
a hundred times what you paid for them. In this way you will make
two separate profits, and the second one may be enormous. It will
be limited only by the courage with which you buy." He smiled up
into their bulging eyes. "Simple, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Julien pronounced him a remorseless rogue, and swore under his
breath to express his amazed appreciation of this rascally scheme.
Delaunay's habitual stolidity gave way to laughter in which there
was a scared note.</p>

<p>"You're a fine fellow, on my soul! I imagined that I knew
something of finance. But this..."</p>

<p>"This is the fruit of genius. Chabot becomes more than ever
necessary to us."</p>

<p>"Chabot?" Delaunay's face lengthened. "That means delay
again."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis was firm and emphatic. "Not only Chabot but
some other prominent and popular Montagnard. Bazire, for instance,
whom you would have brought in before. He, too, stands close to
Robespierre, and carries weight."</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"It is necessary." Andr&eacute;-Louis got up, and faced them
standing. His manner increased in authority. "A commission will
have to be appointed for the purpose of framing the two decrees
which you will require. You must take care in advance that you have
at hand the right men to compose it, men whose interests in the
matter will be identical with your own. That is why these others
must be brought in beforehand."</p>

<p>The object was clear to them at once. "If Chabot should refuse?"
Delaunay asked.</p>

<p>"Conquer his hesitation by the offer of money down. Promise him
a hundred thousand francs&mdash;more if necessary&mdash;for his
immediate co-operation. I will supply the money." He pulled open a
drawer of his writing-table, and took out a bundle of assignats
bound with tape. He flung it down. "There it is. Take it, and
bestir yourselves. This is no pettifogging affair. There's a chance
of fortune if you go about it with address."</p>

<p>Spurred by the prospect of swift and easy fortune, they went
about the business with all the address they could command. That
same night at the Jacobins they jointly tackled Chabot, and bluntly
put the matter to him. At first he recoiled in terror. The very
magnitude of the operation daunted him. It seemed to him that where
the profits were so vast the risks must be grave. But to show him
that in the matter of a profit personal to himself there was no
risk or doubt, Delaunay thrust under his nose the hundred thousand
francs he had received for the purpose.</p>

<p>"Take them. They are yours as an earnest of all that you may
make. And there are millions to be made."</p>

<p>Chabot gasped as he pondered that bundle of assignats. "But if I
expose the fraud of the India Company, how can I
afterwards&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It will not be for you to do that," Julien interrupted him. "I
will bell the cat. Your part will be to ask for a commission of
investigation, and get yourself appointed to it with us and with
one or two others we shall name to you. All you will have to do
will be to frame the decrees."</p>

<p>Cupidity growing in his glance Chabot continued to eye the
proffered money.</p>

<p>"Give me a moment," he begged his tempters, and mopped his brow.
"What will be said when it is discovered that I have been buying
the shares of the Company? What will&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Simpleton!" said Delaunay contemptuously. "Do you suppose that
any of us will do that? We shall appoint Benoit or another to buy
and sell for us. Our hands will not be seen at all."</p>

<p>Peremptorily he added: "It is you or another, Chabot. I give you
the first chance because we are old friends. But resolve yourself.
Will you take the money and join us or must I offer it
elsewhere?"</p>

<p>Before that immediate and terrible risk, Chabot capitulated. He
stuffed the bundle into the breast of his shabby coat. Then he made
a little oration.</p>

<p>"If I consent, it is only because I perceive that no harm can
result to the Republic, or to any sound patriot. These rascally
directors of the India Company, who have been defrauding the
national treasury, will be the only sufferers; and it is proper
that they should be punished for their dishonesty. Yes, my friends.
Before the tribunal of my conscience I stand clear. If it were
otherwise let me assure you that no prospect of gain, however
considerable, would move me to take part in this."</p>

<p>Julien looked at him with wonder in his deep-set eyes. "Nobly
spoken, Chabot. How worthy you ever prove yourself of the great
trust the people repose in you. A man of your purity of republican
principles is destined for the highest honours his country can
bestow upon him."</p>

<p>And the unfrocked priest, suspecting no irony in the speech of
that rascally unfrocked parson, bowed his head. "I covet no
honours. I desire but to perform the duty which my country has
imposed upon me. The burden was not of my seeking. But I will carry
it while my legs will bear me up, and while breath does not fail
me."</p>

<p>They left him, to go and seek Bazire. As they went, "Do you
know, Julien," said Delaunay in his gentle, sluggish voice, "that
the little rascal believes himself?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX - THE INDIA COMPANY</h2>

<p>Informed of the successful association with the scheme not only
of Chabot but also of Bazire, that other prominent deputy and
pillar of the dominant party of the Mountain, Andr&eacute;-Louis
repaired on the morrow to the Convention, to hear Julien make his
preliminary denunciation.</p>

<p>De Batz accompanied him, and together they found seats in the
gallery, among the idle riff-raff which daily crowded it, and so
often interrupted the proceedings of the legislators below in order
to make clear to them how they should interpret the will of the
sovereign people. For we are now in Fructidor of the Year 2 of the
French Republic One and Indivisible, by the Calendar of Freedom.
The Reign of Terror is sweeping to its climax. The dreadful Law of
Suspects is being widely enforced. The law of the maximum has been
enacted in an endeavour to restrain the constant rise in the price
of the necessaries of life which keeps pace with the constant
depreciation of the paper money of the Republic. The
lately-established Revolutionary Tribunal is submerged in business.
Fouquier-Tinville, the public prosecutor, most zealous and
industrious of public servants, can barely find time to eat or
sleep. Executions are multiplying. The great daily spectacle is the
passing of the tumbril to the Place de la Revolution where the axe
of the guillotine clanks busily at the hands of Charles Sanson, the
public executioner, fondly and familiarly known to the rabble as
Charlot. The bread and meat queues grow longer and sadder; hunger
becomes more general among the poor, the bread more and more foul.
But the people suffer it out of faith in the integrity of the
legislators, counting upon their assurances that this Lenten time
is but the prelude to a season of plenty. Meanwhile, to delude and
pacify them, doles are distributed to the indigent, largely as a
result of the activities of the astute Saint-Just.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the curtain continues to rise punctually at the
opera, the caf&eacute;s and eating-houses continue to be crowded at
the usual hours by those who can afford to pay. Fevrier's in the
Palais Royal does a brisk trade; at Venua's banquets are nightly
spread for the prosperous and well-nourished representatives of a
starving people. Life pursues its course, and such men as de Batz,
if of sufficient circumspection and assurance, may move freely.</p>

<p>And freely de Batz moved, his clothes scrupulously elegant, his
hair dressed with the same care as of old, his manner as assured
and haughty as in the days before the fall of the Bastille. His
confidence was based upon that great army of agents and associates,
gradually recruited, which by now was permeating every stratum of
Parisian life. Andr&eacute;-Louis, moving as freely, relied in any
emergency that might arise upon the protection of his civic card,
which announced him for an agent of that dread body the Committee
of Public Safety.</p>

<p>Thus these two came openly and without diffidence to mingle with
the crowd in the gallery of the Convention.</p>

<p>There was little to interest them until the sturdy figure of
Chabot was seen mounting the tribune to address the assembly, and
they rubbed their eyes to behold a transmogrified Chabot. No longer
was he the unkempt, unclean, red-bonneted sansculotte. He came
spruce as a dandy in a tight-fitting brown frock and snowy cravat,
his hair combed and tied. The assembly stared, assuming that at
last he followed the fashion set by his illustrious leader the
great Robespierre. This until the declaration he came to make
suggested another explanation. He was there to proclaim himself a
lover; and it was supposed that, like a bird at mating time, he had
assumed this gay plumage suitably to fill the part.</p>

<p>"Before I pass to the questions of public interest upon which it
is my duty to address you, I desire to touch upon a matter entirely
personal to myself."</p>

<p>Thus he opened, pausing there to resume a moment later. "I take
this opportunity of announcing to you that I am about to marry. It
is known that I have been a priest, a capuchin. I should therefore
lay before you the motives that have urged me to this resolve. As a
legislator I have thought that it was my duty to set an example in
all the virtues. It has been made a reproach against me that the
love of women has played too large a part in my life, and I have
come to perceive that I can best silence that calumny by taking the
wife that the law accords to me. The woman I am to marry is of
recent acquaintance. Brought up like the women of her country in
the greatest reserve, she has been screened from the eyes of
strangers. I do not pretend where she is concerned to be in love
with anything beyond her virtue, her talents and her patriotism.
And it is the reputation of these gifts in myself which have
discovered for me the road to her affections."</p>

<p>He proceeded to add that no priest should soil his nuptials, or
any superstitious ceremonies defile them, and thereby showed how
well he knew his audience. For if the declaration brought no more
than a murmur of applause from his fellow-legislators it produced a
thunder of acclamation from the rabble in the galleries.</p>

<p>Thereafter he passed to matters of business so slender that they
revealed themselves for the pretext and not the reason of his
presence in the tribune.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis had listened to him in anger and contempt.
Filled with pitying concern for L&eacute;opoldine, he was at this
moment more intent that his India-Company scheme should result in
her deliverance than in the restoration of the Bourbons.</p>

<p>Chabot's place in the tribune was taken by Julien, that other
scoundrelly apostate, and Andr&eacute;-Louis leaned forward eagerly
to hear the attack he was to deliver against the India Company, the
burning phrases with which Andr&eacute;-Louis himself had supplied
this puppet. Julien, however, in concert with Delaunay, had
improved upon the original plan. His present address resolved
itself into one of those flamboyant exhibitions of logorrhea on the
subject of virtue and purity in private and in public life, to
which members of the Convention were in these days becoming more
and more addicted. It was in the course of this, and no more than
in passing, that he alluded to the India Company, as one of those
organizations abusing the shelter of the State in which it
flourished and turning that shelter to purposes not always
beneficial to the State itself.</p>

<p>The allusion brought a sudden attentive stillness to an assembly
which hitherto had been a little restless. Somewhere a voice
challenged him to be more precise, declared that if he had charges
to bring he should bring them specifically, and not by
innuendo.</p>

<p>"The reproof is just," said Julien with perfect composure. "When
I began to speak I had no intention of touching upon this, or else
I should have armed myself with the details necessary for a full
exposure of an abuse that must be within the knowledge of many of
you. For it can be no secret to those of you who are zealous and
watchful that the India Company advanced considerable sums of money
to the heretofore King, whereby the deliverance of France from the
odious rule of despotism was materially retarded."</p>

<p>His allusion to their watchfulness and zeal was a cunning gag in
their mouths. Which of these deputies, by contradicting him or by
demanding instantly the evidential details, would betray himself as
without zeal and vigilance? Not one, as he well knew. And he left
the matter there.</p>

<p>When later Bazire, who had also been taken by surprise, asked
him if, indeed, he were in a position to prove what he had said,
Julien smiled his sour, cynical smile and shrugged.</p>

<p>"What do proofs matter? The price of the stock will show
to-morrow whether my shaft has gone home."</p>

<p>That his shaft had indeed gone home there could be no doubt two
days later, by when the stock of the India Company had fallen from
1,500 to 600 francs. Already there was panic among the
stockholders.</p>

<p>The next move was made a week later, and it came from
Delaunay.</p>

<p>He pretended in the speech with which he electrified the
Convention, that as a result of the allegations against the
Compagnie des Indes which his confrere Julien of Toulouse had let
fall in that place, he had been looking into the affairs of the
Company, and what he discovered in them had appalled him. From this
he passed to a fulminating denunciation of the fraud which the
Company had practised in evading a tax justly imposed by the
Nation. To defraud the Republic of moneys due to her, was to
deprive her of her life's blood. Delaunay did not hesitate to
describe as a sacrilege the defalcations of which the India Company
was guilty.</p>

<p>The term was received with applause. On Robespierre's
atrabilious countenance the tiger-cat grin was observed to spread
as if in commendation.</p>

<p>Then, even as he had wrought up their passions, Delaunay now
chilled them again by the motion he put forward. He proposed to
dissolve the India Company, placing her directors under the
obligation of proceeding to the liquidation of her affairs.</p>

<p>So inadequate to the crime was the proposed punishment that the
Convention, after a gasp of surprise that was almost of anger,
broke into a babble of discussion. The president rang his bell for
silence, and Fabre d'Englantine was seen to be ascending the
tribune to voice the general feeling.</p>

<p>He moved deliberately, a man slightly above middle height, of
graceful build and careful attire. He had been many things in turn:
actor, author, poetaster, painter, composer, thief, murderer,
blackguard, and gaolbird. In every part assumed, however, the
historian had predominated, and still unmistakably histrionic were
his movements, speech and gestures now, that by histrionic arts he
had won to a position of eminence in this grotesque parliament.
Those very arts served to make him popular with the masses whose
sympathies are so easily captured by externals.</p>

<p>The man, however, was not without ability, and in his sonorous,
slightly affected voice he displayed now the prompt grasp of
affairs of which his mind was capable.</p>

<p>He began by complimenting Delaunay upon his diligence in
unveiling the turpitude of the India Company; but deplored the
inadequacy of the motion with which Delaunay proposed to deal with
it.</p>

<p>"If the Company's administrators are to be left in charge of the
Company's liquidation, they are supplied with the means of
indefinitely perpetuating it."</p>

<p>Delaunay, like Andr&eacute;-Louis who had dictated those very
terms, was well aware of this, and awaiting precisely such an
objection. Had no one else voiced it, the task would have fallen to
Bazire, that other member of this conspiracy. It was a little
disconcerting that one who was not in the plot should intervene at
this point. But it could not, after all, be serious in its
consequences; because they could never have hoped to pack the
commission entirely.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Fabre, warming to his subject, was becoming more and
more inexorable. He professed astonishment that Delaunay should
have demanded anything less than the total and immediate extinction
of the Company. No measures could be too strong against such a pack
of scoundrels. He demanded that the property of these delinquents
should immediately be impounded.</p>

<p>This was pushing matters a little further than the conspirators
had reckoned. But opinions in the assembly were soon shown to be
divided; the Representative Cambon expressed the view that Fabre's
demands were too intransigent; that they would be productive of a
disorganization in the world of commerce, such as could not
ultimately be to the advantage of the Nation. Others followed him,
each anxious to parade the purity of his patriotism and earning the
applause of the gallery, and the debate might have gone on for ever
had not at last Robespierre risen in his place to set a term to
it.</p>

<p>Long since departed were the days when men sighed and yawned to
behold the mincing Representative from Arras preparing to address
the assembly in his dull, monotonous voice. The power that he had
become, and for which so much was due to his young ally Saint-Just,
was apparent in the almost awed silence that fell upon the assembly
immediately upon his rising. Even the ribalds in the gallery who
had emancipated themselves from all respect of persons seemed now
to hold their breath before that slight, frail figure. He was
dressed with a care that was almost effeminate, in a close sky-blue
frock over a striped satin waistcoat. Below this he wore black
satin smalls, silk stockings, and buckled shoes whose heels were
built up so as to increase his stature. His head emerged from a
snowy, elaborately-tied cravat, the hair carefully dressed and
powdered.</p>

<p>He stood a moment in silence, his horn-rimmed spectacles pushed
up on to his forehead, his myopic eyes peering forth from that
lean, pallid countenance with its curiously tip-tilted nose and
wide, almost lipless mouth that was ever set in a tiger-cat
grin.</p>

<p>Then the dull, unimpressive voice droned forth. He desired that
the counsel of Fabre should be given weight. But this only after
due investigation should have confirmed the charges made. For the
rest, the matter was not one for the great body of the Convention
but for a commission which he desired should be formed at once, not
only to investigate but to decree the measures to be taken.</p>

<p>With that, cold and impassive as he had risen, he resumed his
seat. His fiat had gone forth. These were not days in which any man
in France would dare to call it in question, unless it were that
fearless cyclops Danton, who was still absent, honeymooning at
Arcis-sur-Aube. Robespierre had demanded that a commission be
formed.</p>

<p>This was Chabot's clue. It had been concerted that the demand
should come from Delaunay. That it came from a higher authority was
all the better. Chabot rose from his seat on Robespierre's
immediate left to support the wish expressed by his august leader,
and to propose that Delaunay himself should be included in the
commission. His real object was thus to connect himself with the
business so that he too might be named. This followed easily and
naturally. Beyond that, however, things did not quite run the
prescribed course. It had been arranged that Julien and Bazire
should name each other for service on that commission, and as five
members would compose it, thus there would have been an
overwhelming preponderance of these in the financial
conspiracy.</p>

<p>Fabre's intervention, however, had brought him into prominence,
and his nomination was inevitable. So, too, was Cambon's, who had
spoken to mitigate the harshness of Fabre. To these was added
Ramel, who had also intervened in the debate, and upon that, at
last, the matter was closed.</p>

<p>That evening the conspirators, a little dismayed by the turn of
events, a little dubious now of the result, foregathered in the Rue
de M&eacute;nars to take counsel with Andr&eacute;-Louis.</p>

<p>He was out of temper and caustic, and he lashed Bazire and
Julien for having neglected to make an opportunity for themselves
in the course of the debate. It would have been especially easy for
Julien to have got himself appointed to the commission, considering
that he was already associated in the mind of the assembly with the
affairs of the India Company.</p>

<p>"It was Fabre who sent things awry," Julien excused himself.</p>

<p>De Batz interposed. "Why recriminate? What does it matter? Does
any man believe in the incorruptibility of that mummer? Do you know
his history? Bah! You can have his soul for a hundred thousand
francs." He pulled a bundle of assignats from a drawer of the
secretaire. "Here, Chabot! Buy him with that. Thus, whatever Cambon
and Ramel may wish, you will be sure of a majority on your
commission."</p>

<p>He had acted upon a sudden inspiration. And when those four
traffickers in their mandate had taken their departure, he laughed
deep in his throat as he looked at Andr&eacute;-Louis.</p>

<p>"Thus things fall out even better than you designed. To entangle
Fabre d'Englantine in the business as well as the others was more
than I had hoped just yet! He's worth as much as Julien, Delaunay
and Bazire all added together. The gods fight on our side,
Andr&eacute;-Louis, as we might have known they would; for the gods
are all aristocrats."</p>

<p>Rumours that the Compagnie des Indes was about to be
extinguished by order of the Convention spread immediate panic
among the stockholders. Within twenty-four hours the shares had
fallen even below the level last prognosticated by Delaunay. The
miracle was that there should be buyers for them at any price. And
yet buyers there were. At one twentieth of their real value, the
shares, so fearfully cast upon the market, were instantly
absorbed.</p>

<p>Benoit, the Angevin banker, was known to be the buyer. He was
derided by his financial colleagues for his pains. He was denounced
to his face as mad to pay even the vilest price for paper whose
only purpose hereafter could be to wrap up bread. But Benoit
remained unperturbed.</p>

<p>"What would you? I am a gambler. I take my chances. The
commission has yet to decide the fate of the Company. If the
decision is utterly ruinous to it, my loss will be none so heavy.
If it is otherwise I shall have made a fortune."</p>

<p>He bought of course for Delaunay, Julien and Bazire. Chabot at
the last moment lacked the necessary courage. Delaunay urged him to
invest the half of the hundred thousand francs he had received for
supporting the scheme. But Chabot was fearful of losing it. In the
end, he might not prevail with Fabre; and if Fabre remained
uncorrupted all would be lost. Already Fabre's intervention had
made it impossible to lay alternative decrees before the directors
of the India Company and blackmail them into buying the decree that
would save them from destruction.</p>

<p>Delaunay reported the matter to Andr&eacute;-Louis.
Andr&eacute;-Louis dealt with it summarily. Chabot must be
implicated neck-deep, inextricably, and for this some speculation
on his part was of the first importance. But this was not what
Andr&eacute;-Louis said.</p>

<p>What he said was: "Chabot must stand to profit by the
preservation of the Company or else he will not work for it. His
cowardice will make him take the easier road, and rest content with
his hundred thousand francs. If he will not buy shares, himself, we
must buy them for him." He thrust upon Delaunay a wad of assignats.
"Let Benoit buy him twenty-thousand francs' worth, and take them to
him. Point out to him that on the day when the India Company's
credit is clear of this cloud, those shares will be worth half a
million. To resist that it would be necessary that Chabot should
not be human. And God knows he's so human as to be almost bestial."
Chabot's resistance did not prove insuperable. The prospect of the
half-million was a persuasion not only to accept but also to set
about the seduction of Fabre d'Englantine.</p>

<p>Ten days passed, and still the commission had not sat. It was
time to get to work. Chabot sought Fabre, to learn when it would
please him to attend to the matter. Fabre displayed indifference.
"I will suit my convenience to your own as far as I am able."</p>

<p>"I will consult the others, and send you word," Chabot
replied.</p>

<p>The others whom he consulted were Delaunay, Julien and Bazire,
of whom only the first had any official concern in the matter.
Unofficially, however, their concern was a common one.</p>

<p>"You may act when you please," Julien informed him. "And the
sooner the better. We have bought to the limit of our
resources."</p>

<p>So they had, and another who had bought heavily, informed by his
friend Delaunay of the inner movement in this business, was Benoit,
himself, for his own account. The extent of his purchases gave him
a more than ordinarily keen interest in the manipulation, and out
of this it presently followed that he began to seek for a reason
why de Batz and Moreau, whom he knew for the moving spirits in the
scheme, should themselves have abstained from purchasing,
neglecting so rare an opportunity of easy fortune. Benoit made
exhaustive inquiries. Positively neither de Batz nor Moreau had
bought a single share. What the devil was the meaning of it?</p>

<p>He tackled de Batz with some such question at the very first
opportunity. De Batz was off his guard, and did not sufficiently
weigh his reply.</p>

<p>"It's a speculation. I do not speculate. I trade along lines
that are secure."</p>

<p>"But then, why the devil did you trouble to work out this
scheme?"</p>

<p>And de Batz still more incautiously replied: "I did not. It is
Moreau's scheme."</p>

<p>"Ah! Then why has Moreau not bought?"</p>

<p>De Batz affected innocence. "Has he not? Ha! Curious!" And he
changed the subject.</p>

<p>Benoit agreed with him in his heart that it was curious.
Infernally curious. So curious that he must find the explanation of
it. Since he could seek it nowhere else, he sought it of
Andr&eacute;-Louis himself upon the morrow. Fear of heavy pecuniary
loss can spur some men as strongly as the fear of loss of life
itself, and Benoit, whose whole existence had been dedicated to the
service of Mammon, was of these. So it was a truculent, combative,
dangerous Benoit who descended next morning upon
Andr&eacute;-Louis. He found the young man alone in the Rue de
M&eacute;nars.</p>

<p>Benoit came straight to the point. Andr&eacute;-Louis, standing
before him in the Baron's gay salon, heard him with an astonishment
of which he betrayed no faintest sign. His lean, keen countenance
remained rigid as a mask. If before he answered in words he uttered
a short laugh, yet it was a laugh that told Benoit nothing.</p>

<p>"I do not know that I owe you any explanation. But I'll gratify
your curiosity. I do not like the commission that has been
appointed. If Fabre d'Englantine keeps of the same mind as that in
which he addressed the Convention on this subject, the India
Company will be extinguished."</p>

<p>"Then why," demanded the portly banker, his countenance more
florid than usual this morning, his little eyes narrowed to observe
the other's unrevealing countenance, "why did you send Fabre a
hundred thousand francs to change his mind? Why do you spend such a
sum if you have no interest to speculate on the result?"</p>

<p>"Since when, Benoit, have I been accountable to you for what I
choose to do? What is your right to question me?"</p>

<p>"My right? God of God! I have embarked two hundred and fifty
thousand francs upon this scheme of yours..."</p>

<p>"Of mine?"</p>

<p>"Ay, of yours. Don't waste time in denying it. I know what I
know."</p>

<p>"You know too much, Benoit."</p>

<p>"For your safety, you mean?"</p>

<p>"No, Benoit. For your own." And smoothly though the words were
spoken, there was a cold, steely edge to them that made the banker
suddenly apprehensive.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis was watching him with glittering eyes.
Slowly, incisively, letting his words fall like drops of icy water,
Andr&eacute;-Louis asked a question that voiced the very threat
already trembling on the banker's lips. "Will you tell the
Revolutionary Tribunal that this piece of chicanery concerned with
the India Company is a thing of my invention, done at my
instigation? Will you?"</p>

<p>"And if I did?"</p>

<p>The glittering eyes never left his own. They held his glance in
a singular magnetic fascination.</p>

<p>"What is your evidence? Who are your witnesses? A group of venal
rascals who traffic in their mandate, who abuse their position in
the State, to grow rich by blackmail and by fraudulent speculation.
Yes, fraudulent, Benoit, and fraudulent in the grossest manner.
Will the word of these rogues, these thieves&mdash;for it is upon
their word that you have it that this scheme is mine&mdash;destroy
a man whose hands are clean, who cannot be shown to have purchased
a single share in the India Company? Or will it destroy a man like
you, who, taking advantage of the fraud, has invested a quarter of
a million in the Company's stock? Which do you think, Benoit?"
Again came that short, toneless laugh. "And there you have the
answer that you sought. Now you know precisely why I have
neglected, as you say, this opportunity to make a fortune."</p>

<p>Benoit, his face the colour of clay, his jaw fallen, his
breathing shortened, stood there and trembled. He had his answer
indeed.</p>

<p>"My God!" he groaned. "What game do you play here?"
Andr&eacute;-Louis advanced upon him. He set a hand upon the
banker's fleshly shoulder in its gay green coat.</p>

<p>"Benoit," he said quietly, "you have the reputation&mdash;it is
whispered of you, no more&mdash;of being a safe man. But not all
those whom you have served, not if each were as influential as
Robespierre himself, could keep you safe if this were known.
Remember that, Benoit. I, too, am a safe man. Take comfort in the
thought. Keep faith with me, and I'll keep faith with you. Keep
faith with me, and you may yet keep your head whatever heads may
fall. Break it, mention this matter to a single soul and be sure
that Charlot will make your toilet for you within forty-eight
hours. And now that we understand each other suppose that we talk
of other things."</p>

<p>Benoit departed, enlightened and yet in darkness. Something was
moving here, something deep, dangerous and portentous of which even
knowledge might be perilous. Yet that knowledge he would seek, but
not until he had made himself safe by ridding himself of the
evidences of his participation in the India Company business. He
would sell his stock at once, content at need to suffer a loss
where by waiting he might clear a colossal profit. Then, being rid
of that dangerous burden with nothing on his hands to betray him,
he could laugh at the threat which imposed silence. But the stock
was impossible to sell at any price by now, since all those who
were in the secret had already purchased to the limit of their
available resources.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI - GERMINATION</h2>

<p>The ci-devant Chevalier de Saint-Just, that flaming torch of
patriotism and republican integrity, was about to depart on a
mission of importance to Strasbourg, where a strong hand was just
then required. No stronger hand could the party of the Mountain
supply than that of this elegant, fiercely eloquent, ardently
zealous young idealist. Such was the reputation into which he had
come. Engrossed in national work, he was accounted of an asceticism
unusual in his age, of a purity of life that was a model to
mankind, and of an incorruptibility that rendered him a fit
lieutenant to Robespierre, that Great Incorruptible. His
youth&mdash;he was scarcely more than a boy&mdash;his well-knit,
graceful figure, his handsome face with the golden curls clustering
thickly about his smooth white brow, and his indubitable talents
had raised him by the autumn of '93 to the position of a popular
idol. If he had contrived to place Robespierre supreme, as the
first man in France, he had at the same time not been neglectful of
himself. With his talents, remorselessness and ambition, it is
possible that he was content to play the acolyte; it is equally
possible that he dreamed of ultimately wresting to himself the
office of high-priest in the republican temple.</p>

<p>His last act in the Convention before departing on that
Strasbourg mission had served to increase his popularity. He had
moved that decree for the confiscation of all foreign property, the
foreshadowing of which had led to the tightening of the relations
between Chabot and the Freys. And he had moved it in an address
which was a challenge of France to the world in arms against her.
Her frontiers were being violated by the mercenaries of the
despots; her blood was being shed in the sacred cause of freedom;
whilst the vile agents of Pitt and Coburg were sapping her
strength, by tapping the veins of her commercial and social life.
They must strike the enemy wherever he was to be met. They must
strike him here in their midst no less than on the frontiers: let
all foreign property in France be placed under seal.</p>

<p>That motion was carried. The ardent terms in which it had been
advocated were reported, circulated and extolled by every true son
of France.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the Freys, Chabot was already married to their
sister. Some days before, poor little L&eacute;opoldine had
submitted to the horrible ordeal, had been immolated by her
brothers on the foul altar of Mammon. The worthless assignment they
had made rendered their property immune from the decreed
confiscation. Chabot, the unclean, licentious ex-capuchin, turned
fop, was installed in the handsome apartments on the first floor of
the Freys' house, and thus to be regarded as its inquiries.</p>

<p>The delectable Oldie, as he now called her, the little partridge
whose maiden plumpness had so whetted his lascivious appetite, was
now his own possession, and her dowry was on a scale that in itself
should make him rich, had made him rich already. And even this
dowry had ceased to signify. Soon now he would count his wealth
from other sources in hundreds of thousands, for with
re-established confidence the stock of the India Company must soar
rapidly back towards the high figure from which it had so
precipitately tumbled. Wealth, greatness and honours awaited
Fran&ccedil;ois Chabot. Very clearly his eyes perceived the golden
glow on his horizon. Robespierre had been a fool to be afraid of
money, to neglect opportunities to enrich himself which his
position gave him. For money, as Chabot had so lately discovered,
was the stoutest staff upon which a man could lean. With it, before
all was done, he would try a fall with Robespierre himself, and
Robespierre, caught without any golden panoply about him, should go
down to make way for Fran&ccedil;ois Chabot.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he would neglect no opportunity of focussing the
popular attention. He would keep all eyes upon himself, so that his
republican ardour might dazzle the beholders. With this in view he
was of those who in an impassioned speech demanded the trial too
long delayed of the infamous Austrian woman, that wicked Messalina,
the Widow Capet.</p>

<p>The Convention yielded promptly. It dared do no other even if it
had wished. Already popular feeling against this woman had made it
prudent to abandon the secret negotiations with Austria for the
exchange of prisoners, by which she would have been delivered. The
execution of the King had been in the nature of a dangerous
experiment. In decreeing it the Convention had staked its
existence. It would stake that existence now, and undoubtedly lose
it if it hesitated in dealing mercilessly with this woman to whom
so many national calamities were attributed.</p>

<p>And so at three o'clock in the morning on the 2nd of October,
the unfortunate widow of Louis XVI was conveyed in a closed
carriage, faced by two municipals to guard her, from the prison of
the Temple to the guillotine's antechamber, the Conciergerie.</p>

<p>When it was known on the morrow, Andr&eacute;-Louis was oddly
bitter. He smiled sourly upon de Batz, who sat crushed with
horror.</p>

<p>"And so," he said slowly, "the sacrifice of poor little
L&eacute;opoldine has been in vain. It has not sufficed, after all,
to propitiate your dreadful gods. They must have a queen in
holocaust."</p>

<p>The Baron leapt up with flaming eyes. "Do you mock?"</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis shook his head. "I do not mock. I view the
ruin, the futile ruin of a sweet young life. It was to save a
queen, you said. I told you that no good would come of it."</p>

<p>Livid, de Batz swung away from him. "I spoke of more than the
Queen. But why argue? You have moved too slowly with your infernal
caution."</p>

<p>"That is unjust. I was spurred to swiftest movement in the hope
of precipitating the avalanche in time to save
L&eacute;opoldine."</p>

<p>"L&eacute;opoldine L&eacute;opoldine! Can you think of nothing
else? Not even the fate of the Queen of France can eclipse her from
your thoughts. What do I care for all the L&eacute;opoldines in the
world when that anointed head may fall unless I can work a miracle?
And that fat fool at Hamm will mock again; will call me a Gascon
and a boaster."</p>

<p>"Does that matter? Is your vanity to be concerned?"</p>

<p>"It is a question of my honour," de Batz fiercely retorted.
Thereafter for a week he scarcely ate or slept, and was seldom at
his lodging in the Rue-de-M&eacute;nars. He scoured the city. He
hunted out his army of loyal associates. He held conferences,
propounded plans, each more reckless than the other for the
deliverance of the unhappy Queen. Rougeville, one of his
associates, even claimed thereafter to have penetrated the
Conciergerie and to have spoken with her Majesty in an attempt to
prepare the ground for an evasion. But all was vain. There was not
even the forlorn hope of delivering her by some such desperate
attempt on the road to the Place de la Revolution as that by which
nine months ago he had proposed to save the King. Those were early
days, and after all the King had still some friends even among the
Republicans, whereas the Queen, thanks to the infamous propaganda
that had been steadily at work, was universally execrated.</p>

<p>That propaganda was to continue industrious to the end. There
are no limits to the invention by which men seek to justify the
wrong they do. Hitherto they had been content to brand this poor
tarnished queen as a Messalina. But not even this was enough for
the foul mind of H&eacute;bert.</p>

<p>Her trial, lasting two days, had closed with the death sentence
at four o'clock on the morning of Wednesday the Moth October. Some
hours later she set out in the tumbril, dressed all in white, her
hands pinioned behind her. From the mob-cap with which she was
coiffed escaped the ragged ends of the grey hair rudely cropped by
the executioner's valet in the course of the last toilet. But she
sat erect, disdainful, her heavy Austrian lip protruding in scorn
of the loathly rabble that booed her as she passed to her
death.</p>

<p>It was an imposing last procession. All Paris was under arms.
The drums rolled. Thirty thousand troops of foot and horse had
turned out, and lined the route. Cannon was mounted at every
commanding point. Did she contrast it with that other procession,
twenty-three years ago, in which as the lovely young archduchess of
fifteen she had first come among these people who then, as now, and
yet in what different sentiment had yelled themselves hoarse at
sight of her?</p>

<p>De Batz, a man anguished and almost demented, was in the crowd
to hear the shouts of "Death to tyrants! Live the Republic!" which
greeted the fall of that royal head.</p>

<p>Disordered in mind, as in appearance, he came back to the
Rue-de-M&eacute;nars and to Andr&eacute;-Louis who had abstained
from going forth that day. But not on that account had he remained
either ignorant of or indifferent to what was taking place. He rose
as de Batz entered.</p>

<p>"So. It is finished," he said quietly.</p>

<p>Out of the Baron's livid face a pair of flaming, blood-injected
eyes regarded him in fury.</p>

<p>"Finished? No. It is about to begin. What you have heard from
here was but the overture. It is time to ring up the curtain. Time
to make an end."</p>

<p>His self-control had completely left him. He had the air of a
drunkard or a madman, and he raved like one. He reviled all things,
beginning with himself and ending with the people. It shamed him,
he declared, that the same blood should run in his veins as in the
veins of these tigers. They were vile as no people in the world
ever had been or ever could be vile. They were inhuman, bestial
imbeciles. But they should soon be brought to their senses. Even to
such sub-human wits as theirs the corruption of their masters in
the Convention should be made apparent. Their passions, so easily
inflamed, should be inflamed indeed, so as to consume the evil
satyrs who were responsible for this horror. All of these, he
swore, should go the way the Queen had gone that morning. If
Andr&eacute;-Louis did not share his stormy emotions, he certainly
shared his resolve. Because he remained cold and self-contained, he
was in fact, as he had always been, as he would be to the end, the
deadlier of the two.</p>

<p>There followed days of watchful waiting for the moment to ring
up the curtain on the drama of which he had so craftily prepared
the scenario.</p>

<p>First came, less than a fortnight later, the mockery of a trial
of the twenty-two Girondins, who had languished in prison since
last June. Robespierre judged that the hour for this had struck. It
would drive home the assertion that the party of the Mountain, of
which he was the undisputed head, was now the paramount party in
the State. Their execution followed: a wholesale butchery this,
providing in the Place de la Revolution a spectacle of blood on a
scale not yet witnessed there.</p>

<p>Yet it was a spectacle which restored to de Batz something of
his old remorseless spirit. Almost he smiled even as, with a sigh,
he said: "Poor devils! All young, all able! But even as for their
own advancement they did not hesitate to murder the King, so must
their own murder be approved by all monarchists since it must
advance the cause of the monarchy. Saturn-like the Convention
begins to devour its own children. It is upon this that we have
depended. Let the work thus begun be pushed forward ruthlessly,
until, when it is seen in the departments that the representatives
themselves are being guillotined, none will be found to brave the
danger of replacing them, and the Convention will be reduced to a
handful of contemptible fellows to be used or to be brushed aside."
In a breath he added, "Is the business of the India Company ripe
yet?"</p>

<p>"It is ripening fast," Andr&eacute;-Louis informed him. Already
some days previously the commission had pronounced, upon the vote
of the majority, that the extinction of the Company could not be
countenanced, since it would be against the national interest. That
finding, published unostentatiously, was already abroad, and
confidence was being restored. "The stock is rising again daily.
Whether our friends have taken their profits or not scarcely
matters. They have certainly made them. I am preparing now a
memorial for some representative or other ambitious enough to bell
the cat."</p>

<p>"Whom have you in mind?"</p>

<p>"Philippeaux. There's a crude honesty about him. Also, he is a
moderate, and therefore a natural enemy of the extremist Chabot. I
have sounded him in a casual way. I pointed out to him how odd a
thing it is that so many members of the Convention have latterly
become men of property. I asked him innocently what possible
explanation there could be for this. He became angry. Used the word
calumny; voiced a suspicion that rumours indicated the existence of
a plot to bring the Convention into discredit."</p>

<p>"That was shrewd enough," said de Batz.</p>

<p>"I promised him particulars. I am preparing them."</p>

<p>He prepared them so well that the Representative Philippeaux,
convinced, mounted the tribune of the Convention to cast a
bombshell into the assembly. This happened on a November morning a
week later, and for the moment put an end to the discussion of
abstract questions which had been occupying so much time since
Danton's return from his luxurious retirement. The murder of the
Girondins had been the immediate cause of his reappearance. That
and the summons from his friend Desmoulins, who began to dread the
daily increasing ascendancy of Robespierre. Danton, the man chiefly
responsible for the butchery of the 10th of August, when the
gutters had run with blood, was there now to preach in his powerful
voice a gospel of moderation.</p>

<p>It startled de Batz, who accounted the movement premature. At
the same time, he perceived in it the beginnings of a
counter-revolutionary tendency, and it confirmed the opinion he had
long, held that when the time to use him came, he would find in
Danton the man to play in France the part that Monk had played in
England.</p>

<p>And then, even whilst these things were engaging the Baron's
attention, this was suddenly diverted to more immediate matters by
the speech of Philippeaux. The curtain was raised, indeed; the
drama for which there had been such long and laborious preparation
was at last about to commence.</p>

<hr align="center" width="50%">
<a name="ch32" id="ch32"></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII - UNMASKED</h2>

<p>A big, heavy man this Philippeaux, with a ponderous voice that
came sluggishly but impressively forth. A voice that compelled
attention if it did not charm.</p>

<p>The unconscious puppet of Andr&eacute;-Louis Moreau, he uttered
words which he believed to be his own to express sentiments which
were also his. Scarcely aware of it, so craftily had
Andr&eacute;-Louis used him, he repeated the very phrases with
which Andr&eacute;-Louis, in a magnificent assumption of republican
zeal, had almost deafened him the day before.</p>

<p>"Let the mask of charlatanism fall!" had been
Andr&eacute;-Louis' fierce apostrophe, and Philippeaux's fancy,
captured by the image had not scrupled to appropriate it for his
own.</p>

<p>"Let the mask of charlatanism fall!" was now the opening cry
with which he startled the Convention. "Let virtue stand forth
naked, so that the people may behold her. Let the people know that
those who proclaim themselves the friends of the people are indeed
labouring for the people's welfare. And let us begin by being
rigorous with ourselves."</p>

<p>He paused there, and then, to the gaping assembly which so far
had understood nothing, he flung his terrible gage of battle.</p>

<p>"I demand that every member of the Convention shall declare
within one week from to-day what was the extent of his fortune
before the Revolution. If this has since increased, the extent of
the increase shall be indicated and the means by which it has been
brought about. I move a decree under which any member of the
Convention who shall not have satisfied this demand within the
appointed time shall be declared a traitor to his country."</p>

<p>If the majority of the Convention heard him unmoved by any
panic, yet there was a considerable minority to whom Philippeaux's
motion brought the icy touch of fear. For many there were who had
grown wealthy in ways which it could not suit them to disclose. Of
all these none were more deeply stricken than the members of that
little group responsible for the India Company manipulation.
Chabot, Delaunay, Bazire and Julien were swept by terror. Julien,
the shrewdest of them all, and possibly the greatest rascal,
considered instant flight. He perceived that all was lost; saw
clearly the penalty that must wait upon revelation. He was grateful
that Philippeaux gave them a week in which to render their
accounts. Within that week, Julien would see to it that he was
beyond the reach of the talons of the law. Delaunay remained stolid
after the first shock. He was as deliberate of mental as of
physical movement. He required time in which to consider this
thing, to study its every side. Meanwhile he would jump at no
conclusions. Bazire had the quality of courage. He would make no
weak surrender. He would fight this matter as long as he had
breath. Chabot's instinct, too, was to fight. But in him the
instinct sprang from the opposite cause. It sprang from fear. His
was the instinct of the animal at bay. And frenziedly, like an
animal at bay, without thought or calculation, he was fighting
presently in the tribune, recklessly combating the motion of
Philippeaux.</p>

<p>Hardly ever had he spoken upon any theme without founding his
arguments upon a denunciation. Always for Chabot was there someone
to denounce, someone to hound to trial and the scaffold. It was as
the arch-denouncer that his popularity was established. So now.
Pale, breathless, a little wild of eye and manner, he
denounced.</p>

<p>"Counter-revolutionaries are at work to sow dissension in the
Convention, to bring its members under unjust suspicion." Thus he
began, little suspecting how true was what he said. "Who has told
you, citizens, that these counter-revolutionaries do not aim at
sending you to the scaffold? It has been whispered to me, but until
this moment I have not believed it, that we are to be taken in
turn. One to-day, Danton to-morrow: after him Billaud-Varennes;
they will end at Robespierre himself." Thus recklessly, yet oddly
accurate without suspecting it, he named names, hoping perhaps to
range those whom he mentioned on his side. "Who has told you that
it is not the aim of these traitors to solicit upon forged evidence
a decree of accusation against the foremost patriots here?"</p>

<p>Let him throw into his rhetorical questions all the force of
which he was capable, he remained conscious that he stirred the
main body of his audience below to no interest, whilst above him in
the galleries there was a dull muttering, that reminded him of the
first distant rumblings of thunder. Was the storm about to break
about his head? Had he come so far, merely to end like this? His
terror deepened. He clutched the ledge of the tribune to support
himself. He stood on tiptoe in some vague hope of dominating by an
increase of height. He moistened his dry lips with his tongue, and
began again.</p>

<p>But he was no longer the great denouncer. He was suddenly become
a suppliant. And his supplication, in accents such as none had yet
heard from the truculent little ex-capuchin's lips, was that the
Convention should never admit a decree which might strike a single
one of its members before he had been heard.</p>

<p>A voice interrupted him. "And the Girondins, Chabot? Were they
heard?"</p>

<p>His staring wild eyes sought the speaker among the serried ranks
of the legislators sitting below him. His wits became paralysed. He
had no answer to that interpellation. It was as if the blood of the
murdered Girondins rose up to choke him.</p>

<p>Then the words that he might have uttered came in another voice,
a steady, dominant voice. It was the voice of Bazire, the man who
had kept his courage, and with his courage his wits. He had risen
in his place.</p>

<p>"The Girondins," he declared firmly, "were condemned by public
opinion. There is no parallel. Here and now it is pretended upon
the vaguest charges to direct an attack against true friends of
liberty. I support the proposal of Chabot. I demand that it be
adopted."</p>

<p>There was one who opposed him, one who, whilst agreeing that a
deputy should be heard before being charged, yet demanded that any
who attempted to evade the proposed decree should be declared
outside the law.</p>

<p>Bazire, however, was equal even to this. "No sentence can be
passed upon one who evades accusation. Such a man would merely be
acting upon an elementary instinct of liberty. When the Girondins
decreed Marat's arrest, Marat went into hiding. Dares any man to
blame the conduct of that great hero?"</p>

<p>Of course none dared. And then Julien, taking courage from the
audacity of his confederate, added a word that brought the matter
to an end.</p>

<p>"A private individual who evades accusation is not outlawed on
that account. Will you, then, make sterner taws for the
representatives of the people than for private individuals?"</p>

<p>A Convention in which too many had cause to desire no such
investigation as Philippeaux demanded was glad to fasten upon the
logic of Julien's question as a means of closing the debate. The
principle of Chabot's proposal was accepted, and the little group
of swindlers associated with him breathed freely again.</p>

<p>It looked, indeed, as if Chabot had triumphed. But the man who
had inspired Philippeaux was at hand to inspire others. From the
gallery Andr&eacute;-Louis had listened and observed. That evening
he might have been seen dining at Fevrier's with an out-at-elbow
lawyer named Dufourny, who enjoyed a reputation for advanced
patriotism and was a prominent figure in the Jacobin Club.</p>

<p>On the following evening the two were again to be seen together,
this time in the Jacobin Club, itself; and there Dufourny raised
his voice against the conduct yesterday of Chabot and Bazire in
their opposition to Philippeaux, and to invite the Jacobins to
demand of the Convention a strict examination of the motives of
those two representatives.</p>

<p>The proposal was received with an applause which in itself
revealed the extent to which suspicion of Chabot, until yesterday
so dominantly popular a figure, had already undermined his
position.</p>

<p>Chabot, who was present, felt his knees knocking together in
their new satin breeches. He could have wept to think how easily he
had been caught in that snare of money. But there was worse to
come. Dufourny had but opened the floodgates. The torrent was yet
to roll forth.</p>

<p>Yielding to counsels of despair, Chabot conquered his terror so
far as to ascend the tribune there to render his explanations.</p>

<p>He began again in his old denunciatory terms. He spoke of
treason and conspiracy and of the agents of Pitt and Coburg. But
for once the phrases with which he had been wont to rivet the
attention of the vulgar earned him only derision. He was
interrupted, he was mocked, he was ordered to speak to the point,
to tell them not of Pitt and Coburg, but of himself. And then, when
under that volley of sarcasm, for which no past experience had
prepared him, he faltered, sweated, stammered, and finally turned
in defeat to descend from the tribune, a woman's voice made his
blood run cold with her shrill cry:</p>

<p>"To the guillotine!"</p>

<p>That terrible apostrophe was taken up on every side until the
vaulted hall rang with it.</p>

<p>It arrested his descent. Leaden-hued of face, he stood and
raised his clenched hand above his head. Because it was seen that
he was about to speak, the clamours fell silent.</p>

<p>In a cracked voice, oddly unlike his usual smooth, oily accents,
he screamed at them: "In despite of my enemies, in despite of
revolutionary women, it shall come to be recognized that I am the
saviour of the public weal!"</p>

<p>With that vague assertion he stumbled down the steps on knees
that were turned to water under him.</p>

<p>He collapsed weakly on a bench against the wall near the
tribune, conscious only of glances that were unfriendly and
mocking, turned upon him who yesterday had seemed to himself a
demi-god.</p>

<p>Dufourny leapt to replace him in the tribune.</p>

<p>"He dares to call himself the saviour of the public weal! He
dares! This man who has braved public opinion by marrying a
foreigner, an Austrian!"</p>

<p>Chabot reared his head at that. This was an attack from a fresh
quarter, on fresh grounds. Did the old one not suffice? Was there a
plot here to destroy him? Looking wildly round, his glance met the
dark eyes of Andr&eacute;-Louis Moreau, regarding him curiously.
And something in that glance went through him like a sword of ice.
What was Moreau doing here? And what had he been doing in company
with that scoundrel Dufourny? He groped in vagueness, then
abandoned that to listen to the damning words that Dufourny was
pouring forth.</p>

<p>"What effrontery, what contempt for the people and for popular
feeling in the very hour chosen by Chabot for such a marriage! He
celebrates it at a time when Antoinette stood for her crimes before
the Revolutionary Tribunal, when the nation, beset by the hirelings
of foreign despots, was at the height of its execration of
foreigners; when our brothers who are upon the frontiers have left
us their widows, their sisters, their relatives to comfort and
succour. It is in such a moment that Chabot contracts a wealthy
marriage with an Austrian woman."</p>

<p>Execration answered and confirmed him. Dufourny paused until it
had passed.</p>

<p>"A woman is a garment for a man. If such a garment was necessary
for Chabot, he should have remembered that the nation had
proscribed foreign materials. Before taking such a wife, a man
should inform himself if those to whom she is related are not
legitimately to be suspected of having bonds of interest with the
enemies of France."</p>

<p>At this Chabot bounded to his feet. On this at least he could
deliver a clear answer. He began to defend the Freys, to speak of
Junius as a worthy member of this very club, a philosopher, a
patriot, the first thinker in Europe, one who had made sacrifices
in coming to live in the benign shadow of the Tree of Liberty.</p>

<p>"Sacrifices which enable him to reckon his wealth in millions,"
a voice interrupted him.</p>

<p>Even in the disordered state of his senses he fancied that he
recognized the voice for that of Andr&eacute;-Louis Moreau. But he
was given little time in which to reflect. The clamours thundered
about him again. He was accused now of prevarication, of impudent
falsehoods uttered to protect an Austrian Jew, a ghoul who battened
on the calamities of the nation, an agent of Coburg's in their
midst.</p>

<p>And to his offences against the nation was added now the
accusation of an offence against humanity. Again it was Dufourny
who voiced it, waiting for a moment of silence so that no syllable
of it should be lost.</p>

<p>"Before this marriage of yours, Chabot, you had a companion, a
mistress, a Frenchwoman, who has since become a mother. What have
you done with her? Why did you abandon her, leaving her to starve,
together with your child?"</p>

<p>At this a menace of violence from the women was added to the
general execration. It was remembered against him that he had been
a priest. The very apostasy, which hitherto had magnified him into
a shining example of progressive republicanism, was discounted now
as something done in the indulgence of a dissolute nature.</p>

<p>Under this formidable onslaught the ignoble spirit of this man,
who had so callously procured the breaking of so many noble
spirits, broke at last completely. He burst into tears, and with
wild, lachrymose denunciations of those who now denounced him, he
staggered forth from that club which had become for him a place of
terrors.</p>

<p>He went home to the elegant apartments and the recently-acquired
luxuries of the Rue d'Anjou, luxuries for which it now seemed that
he was likely to pay with his neck, and as he went he asked himself
what enemy was this who so suddenly and without warning had leapt
at him out of the void to fasten upon his throat.</p>

<p>The Freys heard his story in dismay. He spared them nothing. But
when he spoke of that secret, invisible enemy, the dismay of Junuis
was converted into contempt. Junius was a hard-headed, practical
man of affairs. He had no patience with mere instinctive feelings
and with a babble of ghostly antagonism. He demanded substance,
proofs, and fancied, being practical, that he discovered them for
himself.</p>

<p>"Pish! A secret enemy. What secret enemy should you have? Is
there some husband whose wife you have debauched? Someone you have
swindled? Or the friend or relative of someone whom you have
guillotined? Can you think of any such?"</p>

<p>Chabot could not. He had in his time been guilty of all these
crimes and more. But he was not aware that he had left any avenger
on his heels.</p>

<p>"Well, then. Well, then! Your secret enemy is simply the vulgar
envy which any access of prosperity will provoke. Shall a man of
your position, of your popularity&mdash;the greatest man in France
next to Robespierre&mdash;be swept away by that mean sentiment? The
Jacobins may storm, inflamed by this scoundrel Dufourny. But the
Jacobins are not the People. It is the People, the sovereign
People, who are the ultimate arbiters in France to-day. Make your
appeal to them. They will not forsake you. Take courage, man."</p>

<p>He took it, under the vigorous drive of that undaunted Jew. In
the night he considered his position and the course to be taken,
and he reached a resolve before morning. He would go to
Robespierre. The Incorruptible could not be indifferent to his
fate. He was too valuable to the party of the Mountain, and a
struggle lay ahead of that party.</p>

<p>There were rumours of strife to come, arising out of the
discrepancy between Danton's views of policy and Robespierre's.
Robespierre would need to rally all his friends about him for that
contest. And of them all, with the possible exception of
Saint-Just, who had been climbing so rapidly of late, none was more
valuable than Chabot.</p>

<p>His confidence restored by this reflection and by the perception
now of the tale he was to tell, he went off betimes to the Rue
Saint Honor&eacute; and the house of the cabinet-maker Duplay,
where the Incorruptible was lodged.</p>

<hr align="center" width="50%">
<a name="ch33" id="ch33"></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII - THE INCORRUPTIBLE</h2>

<p>Across a courtyard stacked with broad planks of cedar, walnut
and mahogany, where wood-shavings curled and clung about his
ankles, and where a couple of young men were industriously sawing a
baulk of timber, the Citizen-Representative Chabot gained the house
and ascended the dark staircase to the first floor.</p>

<p>His knock was answered by Elizabeth Duplay, one of the two
daughters of the cabinet-maker with whom Maximilien Robespierre was
lodged, one of the two vestals who ministered to the arch-priest of
the Republic. No breath of scandal had ever blown over these
relations. If Robespierre feared money, he feared women more.
Indeed, an aversion to women had always marked his nature, a
curious aversion which upon occasion had found an expression almost
feral.</p>

<p>The great Montagnard lived simply and was readily accessible.
Moreover, Elizabeth Duplay had often opened to the
Citizen-Representative Chabot, and he was well-known to her,
although at the moment and in the uncertain light of the landing
she had to look twice before she recognized under his preposterous
finery one whom she had never seen other than red-bonneted and
ill-clad, like a man of the people.</p>

<p>He was ushered into a fair room that overlooked the street, a
room simple, austere, immaculate as the man who tenanted it. The
windows were hung with curtains of Persian blue, softening and
subduing the daylight, and there was about the sparse furniture, as
about the man himself, a neat and elegant asceticism.</p>

<p>Robespierre stood before his writing-table, a slight, almost
boyish, figure in a tight coat that was striped in two shades of
blue, and all about him&mdash;evidences of his abnormal vanity and
egotism&mdash;reproductions of himself served to decorate his
shrine. Here it was a sketch by David; there the portrait in oils
which had hung in the Salon two years ago; from the overmantel a
bust of himself looked down upon the original, reproducing the
meanness of the square face, the cruel spite that was never absent
from the lips of that wide mouth, belying the humour to have been
suspected from the tilt of his curious nose that was so wide at the
root.</p>

<p>When Chabot entered, he was in the act of squeezing an orange
into a broad cup. He suffered from an insufficiency of bile, and to
excite it drank orange-juice continuously. To see who came, he
thrust the horn-rimmed spectacles upwards on to his massive
forehead, sparsely covered by the curls of his scrupulously dressed
and powdered hair. His myopic green eyes peered across the room,
and the set grin that never left his lips widened slightly in
recognition.</p>

<p>Beyond that he made no welcoming movement. But having set down
the cup, and placed the orange hemisphere upon a plate beside its
other half, he stood waiting for Chabot to speak. It was an ominous
reception, which in itself informed Chabot of that which he most
dreaded.</p>

<p>He closed the door and came forward. He did not strut this
morning. He dragged his feet a little. Of the swaggering forward
thrust of his incipient paunch which normally announced his
aggressive self-sufficient nature there was little sign. He was
pale, and blear-eyed. Even the Polichinelle nose that sprouted from
that lamentably sloping forehead seemed to have shrunk overnight to
less aggressive proportions. The coward latent in every bully had
come to the surface. He had spent the wakeful night in tears, in
lamentations of his fate, which he assigned to the malignity of
others rather than to any fault in himself. He had played the
hypocrite so long that it is possible that he deceived even
himself, and that actually he believed at least some part of the
tale with which he came to seek the assistance of the one man in
France whose power might shield him.</p>

<p>"I disturb you early, Robespierre. But my duty requires it. I
come to save the Republic. I hold the thread of the most dangerous
conspiracy that has yet been organized for the ruin of
Liberty."</p>

<p>For a long moment the green eyes considered him. They were
ice-cold in their regard, and ice-cold was the voice in which at
last the arch-priest of Liberty delivered himself.</p>

<p>"Why then, you must reveal it."</p>

<p>"Of course. But to do this it is necessary that I should
continue to associate with the conspirators. I have pretended to be
one with them so that I might penetrate their designs. I have
pretended to yield to the temptation of sharing in their plunder,
so that I might discover the extent of their aims. I begin to
perceive that these are counter-revolutionary: that a terrible, and
incredible conspiracy is at work; actively at work; and already
widespread. It is in my power to have these men taken red-handed,
the proofs upon them."</p>

<p>"No man could render a greater service to his country."</p>

<p>"Ha! You see that. You see that!"</p>

<p>"It leaps to the eye." If there was irony in the cold, level
voice, it was too subtle for Chabot. He was beginning to take
courage.</p>

<p>"It does. Of course it does."</p>

<p>"You must not hesitate, Chabot." And then he added: "You will
have proofs. What are they?"</p>

<p>And now what the little scoundrel said was strictly true. He
pulled out a packet of assignats.</p>

<p>"Here are a hundred thousand francs. They were handed to me as a
bribe not to oppose certain financial projects of these scoundrels.
If I had yielded to my natural impulse, which was to reject with
horror this monstrous proposal and at once denounce the villains
who made it, I must have missed the chance of sounding their design
to its infamous depths. You see, Robespierre, how hard a choice was
laid before me; what self-control I was forced to summon to my aid.
But the thing has gone far enough. I scarcely dare let it go
further lest I should myself come under suspicion. For the sake of
my country, for the sake of the Republic which has never had a more
loyal servant, I have placed myself in jeopardy. But I must clear
this up. It is my intention at once to take this packet to the
Committee of Public Safety and at the same time reveal the names of
the traitors."</p>

<p>"Then why do you come to me? You are wasting valuable time. The
Committee of Public Safety will certainly receive you with the
cordiality and gratitude for which the occasion calls."</p>

<p>Chabot stood hesitating, uneasy, shifting on his feet.</p>

<p>"Make haste, my friend," the Incorruptible admonished him. "Make
haste." He stepped aside from the table as he spoke, moving
stork-like on his thin legs in their thin silk stockings above his
preposterously high heels.</p>

<p>"Yes...but...name of a name! I don't want it supposed from my
association with these vile conspirators that I am one of
them."</p>

<p>"Why should it be? Who could suppose this of you?" But there was
no warmth of conviction in that voice. Its tone remained
dead-level. Its words were mechanical if they were not actually
mocking.</p>

<p>"There are the appearances. All men are not as you, Robespierre.
They have not your nice balance of judgment. They make hasty
assumptions upon insufficient grounds. That is why I feel myself in
need of some security."</p>

<p>"It is a question, you say, of saving your country. Can such a
patriot as you are hesitate from personal considerations?"</p>

<p>"No." Chabot was vehement. He adopted something of his
tribune-manner. "I am ready enough to die for my country. But I do
not want to die under a stigma of guilt. I must think of my family:
my mother and my sister. I do not want them to die of broken
hearts, and it is what would happen to them. Especially my sister.
A fierce patriot my sister, who said to me once, not long ago:
'Fran&ccedil;ois, if ever it should happen that you should betray
the cause of the People, I should be the first to plunge a dagger
into your heart.'"</p>

<p>"The Roman spirit," was Robespierre's comment.</p>

<p>"Oh, a Roman of the Romans my sister."</p>

<p>Robespierre nodded. "You are fortunate in your family." He
strutted back to the table, and once more took up the half-orange,
and the cup and resumed his squeezing, speaking coldly the
while.</p>

<p>"Your alarm is surely idle. You have no cause to doubt that the
Committee of Public Safety will co-operate with you in whatever
measures may be necessary to discover this conspiracy."</p>

<p>Chabot turned cold. "To be sure. To be sure. But if I had some
guarantee, if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have," said the icy voice. "Your intentions are your
guarantee. What better could you desire?"</p>

<p>"With you, no more. You know me, Robespierre. You, whose glance
penetrates to the heart of things and of men, perceive my
intentions clearly. But others may not weigh all the factors quite
so scrupulously."</p>

<p>Robespierre set down the half-orange that was now squeezed to
exhaustion. He took up the other half. Holding it to the rim of the
cup, he paused, and his green eyes squarely encountered Chabot's
uneasy glance.</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do?"</p>

<p>Promptly came Chabot's answer.</p>

<p>"Help me to save the country. Associate yourself with me in this
glorious task worthy of your great patriotism. Join hands with me,
so that together we may crush this hydra of treason. That is the
task I offer you. A task whose fulfillment will cover you with
glory."</p>

<p>But not even the fantastic vanity of Robespierre could tempt him
to succumb to this appeal.</p>

<p>"I would not rob you of a single ray of the glory which belongs
to you, Chabot. Besides, I am tidy in all my habits. I like a
proper observance of the forms, and you are out of order here. You
should not have come to me at all. Your place is before the
Committee of Public Safety. Go to the Committee, then, without
further waste of time." And the Incorruptible lowered his eyes to
the task in hand, and began to squeeze the second half of his
orange.</p>

<p>Chabot understood that he was dismissed. He was not sure that he
was not condemned. He gulped in panic, and with his panic was mixed
a high measure of incredulity. To one who had been a capuchin, and
who as a capuchin had listened to confessions, the stupidity and
wickedness of the human heart should have brought no surprises. Yet
surprised he was by the wickedness and stupidity which he now
construed to be actuating Robespierre. Was it really possible that
in his overweening conceit this pompous little dullard was
underestimating the value to him of such a man as Chabot? Did the
creature really think that he had climbed by his own merit and his
own unaided effort to the high place he held? Did his vanity blind
him to the fact that it was by association with such men as Chabot,
Bazire and Saint-Just that he had been hoisted into his supremacy?
And dared he withhold his protecting aegis now from one of these?
Dared he allow him to be cast to the lions? Had he no thought for
the weakening of his own position that must result from the loss of
such a supporter as Chabot?</p>

<p>It was incredible. But, beholding him there so calmly squeezing
his orange, and pressing the extruded pulp against the rim of his
cup, Chabot could no longer doubt that however incredible the thing
was true.</p>

<p>He mumbled words which Robespierre supposed to be of
leave-taking. Actually it was a Latin tag: "Quem Deus vult
perdere..." And on that he went out on feet uncertain as a
drunkard's.</p>

<p>He repaired straight to the Tuileries, and into the presence of
the Committee of Public Safety, five members of which were in
session, Bar&egrave;re presiding. On the way he had collected his
courage once more. He had but to think of the past, of the triumphs
his eloquence had won, of the great man that he had become. It was
unimaginable that he should not be believed.</p>

<p>He maintained his recovered confidence even when he stood before
that terrible Committee, whose members, already fully informed
through their ubiquitously active spies of last night's events at
the Jacobins, received him with a coldness such as none would
yesterday have dared to show to so great a man.</p>

<p>He told his tale in terms of passionate rhetoric; the burning
patriot, the saint who was ready at need to become a martyr in the
holy cause of Liberty. He did not move them. They were not the mob.
They were cold, calculating men of affairs. Not even the fact that
they were of his own party, men of the Mountain all of them,
disposed them in his favour.</p>

<p>It was in vain that he paraded the astuteness by means of which
he had fooled the conspirators into believing him one of
themselves, in vain that he expounded and exalted his devotion to
the cause of liberty, in vain that in a supreme gesture of contempt
he flung the hundred thousand francs upon the table before them.
And it was equally in vain that he demanded of them a safe-conduct,
so as to enable him to continue his investigations. It may have
occurred to them that he might use it to place himself beyond the
frontier.</p>

<p>At last, before their impassivity, he realized that he was lost.
Desperately he played his last card.</p>

<p>"These traitors are to meet at my house to-morrow evening at
eight o'clock." And now at last he named names, thinking perhaps to
impress them with those of three members of the Convention, of the
party of the Mountain, one of whom, indeed, was of the first
importance: Bazire, Delaunay, Julien and the banker Benoit.</p>

<p>Thus the little craven betrayed his associates in the hope of
saving his own neck by turning witness against them.</p>

<p>"Send to my house to-morrow at eight, and you shall take the
lot. I'll have them there for you."</p>

<p>"You establish your patriotism," said Bar&egrave;re. But he was
smiling curiously. He added: "But are you sure that you have named
them all?"</p>

<p>Chabot sucked in his plump cheeks under the shock of that
question. It suggested that he told the Committee nothing that it
did not already know. Indeed, not quite all that it did know. It
seemed he was only just in time.</p>

<p>"Faith, I was forgetting one, who is of less importance. A
fellow named Moreau."</p>

<p>"Ah yes," said Barere still with that curious smile on his
high-bred face. "I thought you had overlooked Moreau. Well, well,
it is understood. At eight o'clock to-morrow." The others
nodded.</p>

<p>Chabot lingered, perplexed. There had been no word of thanks,
yet they seemed to dismiss him. It could not be.</p>

<p>"Why do you wait, Chabot?" It was Billaud-Varennes who put the
question.</p>

<p>"Is that all?" he asked, bewildered.</p>

<p>"Unless you have more to say, that is all. Until eight o'clock
to-morrow."</p>

<p>He went out awkwardly, like a dismissed lackey rather than a
master turning his back upon his servants; for until this morning
that had more nearly approached their respective positions.</p>

<p>He walked home haunted by that enigmatic smile on the lips of
Bar&egrave;re. What had the insolent fellow meant by it? Was he
presuming upon what had happened last night at the Jacobins to be
putting on airs and graces with a patriot of Chabot's consequence?
The damned aristocrat! For Bertrand Bar&egrave;re de Vieuzac of
Tarbes was a gentleman by birth. He belonged to a class that Chabot
from his earliest days had hated with the instinctive hatred of the
base for his betters. It was a fact concerning him that Chabot had
overlooked. He would be giving a little attention presently to this
Monsieur Bar&egrave;re de Vieuzac. He would have the damned head
off that vile aristocrat before many weeks were over.</p>

<p>And how the devil did he come to know that Andr&eacute;-Louis
Moreau was in the affair?</p>

<p>If Chabot had possessed the answer to that question, he would
have been a little less confident about his future ability to deal
with Bar&egrave;re. He was not to know that upon the table of the
Committee of Public Safety had lain since yesterday a full report
of the India Company swindle from the pen of the Committee's very
diligent secret agent Andr&eacute;-Louis Moreau, and that the
Committee had already decided upon its course of action which was
nowise influenced by the visit of Chabot.</p>

<p>It was not quite the course of action now agreed with him. The
arrests took place next day and they took place at eight o'clock.
But it was at eight o'clock in the morning, without waiting for
Chabot to bring the conspirators together. They were arrested
separately. Chabot, half-stupefied, wildly protesting error in
terms of coarsest blasphemy, then as wildly protesting that the
person of a deputy was inviolable, was dragged from the side of his
little Poldine, who stopped her ears, shuddering at his
obscenities. With each of the others named&mdash;excepting only
Andr&eacute;-Louis Moreau&mdash;it fared the same. And at the same
hour yet another was arrested: Fabre d'Eglantine whom Chabot had
not named, but whom Andr&eacute;-Louis had not omitted from his
report.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV - THORIN'S LETTER</h2>

<p>By noon that day the town was in a ferment. Crowds were
assembling in the Gardens of the Tuileries. Crowds paraded through
the streets howling death to all and sundry. Crowds besieged the
hall of the Jacobins. Crowds clamoured about the precincts of the
Convention. From the galleries the women of the markets hurled
shrill insults at the absent fallen legislators, demanding to know
whom they could trust.</p>

<p>That demand was on the lips of every patriot that morning. If
Chabot was false to his duty, whom could they believe true to it?
If Chabot abused his position to swindle the people, whom could
they believe honest?</p>

<p>There were those who mingled with the crowds to fan their anger,
and direct its course; men of rough patriotic appearance from the
red bonnets on their heads to the clogs on their feet, who fiercely
proclaimed that France had exchanged one set of tyrants for another
which battened still more greedily upon her misery. An unfortunate
dandy crossing the terrace of the Feuillants was seized and
butchered as an expression of popular rage, for no better reason
than because his head was powdered and some virgo had raised the
cry that he dusted his head with flour whilst the people had no
bread.</p>

<p>Things began to look so wicked that the National Guards were
brought out to restore some order and afford protection to the
threatened Conventionals until the people's anger should have
cooled.</p>

<p>De Batz kept his room in the Rue-de-M&eacute;nars, so that any
of those industrious agents of his at their inflammatory work
should know where to find him if he were needed. He chafed there in
impatience, pacing to and fro in the little salon, and pausing ever
and anon to listen to the uproar of that November morning. He was
fretted too by the absence of Andr&eacute;-Louis, who had gone out
early, leaving no word of what business took him abroad.</p>

<p>It was a little past noon when he returned. His pallor, the
compression of his lips, and a feverish glitter in his eyes gave
evidence of suppressed excitement.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" de Batz greeted him.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis took off the great-coat in which he was
wrapped. "To receive the thanks of the Committee of Public Safety."
And to the frowning Baron he gave at last the news of what he had
done, of the report which he had drawn up for the Committee's
information.</p>

<p>"You did this?" There was a rumble of resentment in the Gascon's
voice.</p>

<p>"Faith, it was becoming necessary to establish my position. An
agent must do something to justify himself. After the outbreak in
the Convention yesterday I foresaw what must happen. I have the
measure of Chabot. If I anticipated the betrayal of his associates
which he would inevitably make, I hurt no one and profited myself.
I take long views, Jean."</p>

<p>"But very secret ones." De Batz was annoyed. "Why did you
withhold your confidence?"</p>

<p>"You might have opposed me. You can be obstinate. Besides, I
haven't withheld it. I am telling you now. There was no need to
tell you at all."</p>

<p>"Much obliged for your frankness. Whom did you denounce in your
report?"</p>

<p>"All those whom I judged that Chabot would denounce&mdash;all
save one, Benoit, whom I excluded but whom Chabot betrayed. I might
have known he would. Yet Benoit may save himself. As for the
others, they make up a fine baker's batch!" He used the cynical
term "fourn&eacute;e" that was already current to describe the
daily immolations.</p>

<p>He explained himself a little more. Some of the Baron's
annoyance melted. But not all of it. He still complained that
Andr&eacute;-Louis was too secretive.</p>

<p>"Have I blundered anywhere? You hear what is going on."
Andr&eacute;-Louis defended himself. "My God, Jean, we've raised a
storm that will take some calming."</p>

<p>It was so, indeed. You may read in the Moniteur of the
agitations of the days that followed; the furious invectives in the
Convention against corruption, by which those who remained sought
to restore in themselves the shaken confidence of the people; the
very terms of the accusation levelled at Chabot and his associates:
"Peculation and conspiracy tending to vilify and destroy by
corruption the Revolutionary Government."</p>

<p>But the storm was not yet to be allayed. To placate the wrath of
the outraged people, many more arrests were decreed, arrests which
included the brothers Frey and even the unfortunate
L&eacute;opoldine. Robespierre himself took fright at the violence
of this earthquake which shook the Mountain to its very
foundations, and threatened to hurl him from his eminence on its
summit. He sent in haste to recall Saint-Just from Strasbourg, so
that in this hour of dreadful need he might have beside him that
bright revolutionary arch-angel.</p>

<p>Saint-Just arrived, and went earnestly and craftily to work to
restore the shaken confidence.</p>

<p>Oratory is impressive according to the lips from which it falls.
Saint-Just's lips were believed to be pure. There was faith in him
because of his reputation for asceticism and Spartan frugality. He
had been an example of all the civic virtues. The purity of morals
which he passionately demanded was no more than that which he
practised himself.</p>

<p>So that when Saint-Just came to condemn in unmeasured terms the
corruption of those fellow Conventionals who had been imprisoned,
it seemed to the people that at last they heard their own voice
presenting an indictment to the Convention.</p>

<p>And so craftily did Saint-Just go to work that he not merely
stilled resentment against the Mountain, he actually made capital
for it out of the event.</p>

<p>He made of the shameless peculation which had brought about the
downfall of Chabot and his associates a pretext for all those evils
under which the people groaned and had been growing restive. They
went hungry, he assured them, because a pack of rogues had
embezzled the public substance. He thanked Heaven that discovery
had come before the harm was beyond repair.</p>

<p>So soon as the devoted legislators who remained had straightened
out the tangle left by that corruption, there would be an end to
all distress.</p>

<p>Conquered by his arguments, above all believing in that closing
promise, confidence was at last restored, and with it peace and the
will to endure the inevitable hardships which the transition from
tyranny to liberty was imposing.</p>

<p>Saint-Just's victory on behalf of his party was assisted by a
fortunate turn in the tide of war. He was able to point to the good
work he had done in Strasbourg. Toulon, it was true, remained a
focus of reactionary activity, held by royalists and foreigners
thanks to the wiles of the perfidious Pitt. But elsewhere the arms
of the Republic were victorious, and on the frontiers the enemies
of liberty were being firmly held.</p>

<p>Further to divert the public attention came a side-show, a
struggle of Titans. Danton and H&eacute;bert were locked in
death-grips, and it says much for the indomitable courage of Danton
that he should have chosen this moment for a trial of strength with
one who exercised such control over the Commune, the police, the
Revolutionary Army and even the Revolutionary Tribunal, as the
scoundrelly editor of the P&egrave;re Duchesne, the man who more
than any other was the advocate of bloodshed, the enemy of all
authority, the anarch who, having laboured to dethrone a king, had
since laboured to dethrone God Himself.</p>

<p>Danton's constructive mind accounted that the ground had been
sufficiently cleared by the immolation of the Girondins. In his
view it was time to restore order and authority. He had come back
from Arcis to preach moderation, and he had met the ruthless
opposition of H&eacute;bert. Battle was joined between them.</p>

<p>Robespierre held aloof, watching, well content. Whether
intoxicated with the growth of his power he perceived the way to a
dictatorship, or whether he would be content with a triumvirate in
which he would rule with his two acolytes Saint-Just and Couthon,
it was to his interests that the rival forces represented by
H&eacute;bert and Danton should first engage each other. He would
deal with the survivor when the time came.</p>

<p>Equally watchful was de Batz. It was not without disappointment
that he had seen that very promising storm allayed by the eloquence
of Saint-Just. At the same time he lent an ear to
Andr&eacute;-Louis' confident assurances that what had been done
once could be done again.</p>

<p>"Next time," said Andr&eacute;-Louis, "there will be no
recovery. Public confidence, badly shaken by this blow, will
collapse completely under a second one. Be sure of that."</p>

<p>"I can be sure of that, but not of another opportunity."</p>

<p>"Opportunity comes to him who watches. And I am watching.
Robespierre is the only incorruptible. This struggle between Danton
and H&eacute;bert may bring much to light at any moment. I am
working with Desmoulins in the Dantonist interest, and so I am at
the very centre of present political activities."</p>

<p>Inspired by some of his confidence, de Batz possessed himself in
patience, and laboured unremittingly. His make-believe patriots
were mingling with the crowds again, inflaming public opinion in
Danton's favour upon every opportunity. His pamphleteers were at
work, and Andr&eacute;-Louis as a contributor to the Vieux
Cordelier was seconding with his pen the labours of Desmoulins. He
liked Desmoulins, detecting in him a kindred spirit; and he could
work with him the more agreeable, since this young man at least was
not one of the faggots that was being dried for the fire.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. Unremittingly Andr&eacute;-Louis studied the
ground to discover a fresh vulnerable point in the position of the
Mountain. It arose out of Desmoulins' alliance with Danton that he
too kept an eye on the future, and worked for the time when Danton,
having disposed of H&eacute;bert, should come to measure himself
against the Robespierrists. In the course of this he made certain
attacks upon Saint-Just. They were playful as yet, aiming at no
more than to raise a laugh or two at Saint-Just's expense. But one
of them had stung the young representative into a wickedly menacing
retort.</p>

<p>"He regards his head," Desmoulins had written, "as the
cornerstone of the Republic, and he carries it on his shoulders
with the reverence due to the Saint Sacrament."</p>

<p>A few days after this, early one morning in November, Desmoulins
broke in upon the labours of Andr&eacute;-Louis. He was excited.
His fine eyes were a little wild, and the brown hair was tumbled
about a face that might have been noble but for the pockmarks and
the pouting lips. The aggravation of his habitual stutter was a
further index of the young man's perturbation.</p>

<p>"This fellow Saint-Just takes himself a thought too seriously.
Regards himself as a cross between Brutus and Saint Aloysius of
Gonzaga. But there's more of Cassius in him than of either of
those."</p>

<p>"You imagine that you bring me news," said Andr&eacute;-Louis,
surprised only by the outburst. He rose from his table as he spoke,
and went to throw some fir-cones on the dwindling fire, for there
was a fog abroad and the morning was chill and damp.</p>

<p>"Ah, but do you know what he is saying? That whilst I have
written of him that he carries his head like a Saint Sacrament, he
will see to it that I shall carry mine like a Saint Denis. What do
you think of that?"</p>

<p>As Saint Denis carries his head in the crook of his arm there
was only one thing to think of it.</p>

<p>"It's a pretty retort."</p>

<p>"Pretty! It drips blood. A nice threat to be putting about.
He'll have me guillotined, will he? He'll make me lose my head for
a jest. I think he must have lost his own already since he dares to
threaten a man openly in such terms."</p>

<p>"It's imprudent," Andr&eacute;-Louis agreed soberly.</p>

<p>"More imprudent than he reckons, or than you suspect, my friend.
I am not the man to scuttle before menaces. If this is a
declaration of war, I am ready for it." He lugged a paper from his
breast. "Here's a windfall. Read this. It should strip the mask
from this hypocrite. He won't look so much like Saint Aloysius
then."</p>

<p>It proved to be a letter from a man named Thorin who wrote from
Bl&eacute;rancourt in bitter denunciation of Saint-Just, whom he
styled obviously of malice aforethought, the ci-devant Chevalier de
Saint-Just. It charged Saint-Just with having debauched Thorin's
young wife and carried her off to Paris, where he kept her secretly
as his mistress; and this at a time when, as all the world knew,
Saint-Just had just become affianced in marriage to the sister of
the Deputy Lebas.</p>

<blockquote><i>He is true,</i> wrote the indignant husband, <i>to
the dissolute aristocratic stock from which he springs. This
ci-devant Chevalier de Saint-Just, who postures in Paris as a
reformer, has yet to reform himself. The ci-devant Chevalier de
Saint-Just is a thief and a scoundrel, as I am in a position to
prove. They tell me that in the Convention he is an advocate of
purity in private as in public life. Let his own advocacy be
applied to him. Let him be purified. The guillotine is the great
national purifier.</i></blockquote>

<p>The writer went on to say that he addressed himself to
Desmoulins because from certain phrases in the Vieux Cordelier he
conceived that Desmoulins at least had begun to suspect the real
nature of this debauched hypocrite. He desired not only to avenge
the outrage he had suffered, but also to protect the unfortunate
woman whom Saint-Just was no doubt upon the point of casting out to
die upon the streets.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis took a deep breath. This came so opportunely
to his needs that he could hardly believe in so much good fortune.
If these accusations could be established Saint-Just would lie at
their mercy. Here, indeed, was the vulnerable point
Andr&eacute;-Louis had been seeking.</p>

<p>In ordinary circumstances, and despite the cant of purity to
which the Conventionals, especially since the fall of Chabot, were
becoming so addicted, the matter of carrying off another man's wife
would have been none too seriously viewed. But the circumstances
dressed up the event into a monstrosity. The fact that Saint-Just
had just betrothed himself to the sister of Lebas, discounted the
possibility of any condoning genuine affection towards Madame
Thorin, and made her just the victim of his reckless lust.</p>

<p>The capital to be made of it was enormous. It would have been
enormous, following upon the India Company swindle, whatever member
of the Mountain had been concerned. But that it should be
Saint-Just, the popular idol, the first of Robespierre's
supporters, the very man who had denounced the corruption of
Chabot, and by faith in himself restored faith in his party,
rendered incalculable the consequences of exposure, and transcended
the wildest hopes that Andr&eacute;-Louis could have
entertained.</p>

<p>But there was no need for haste. First let Danton send the
H&eacute;bertists the way of the Girondins. Then, when the arena
was cleared for the final inevitable struggle between Danton and
Robespierre, would be the time to strike a blow with this in which
its consequences must destroy the Robespierrists and the revolution
with them.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis returned the letter.</p>

<p>"Yes." he said slowly "if you act cautiously, you have him.
That's a good phrase about the ci-devant Chevalier de Saint-Just.
You might remember it, and use it presently. There's a world of
prejudice packed into it for patriotic minds. It's a good phrase,
too, about his being true to the dissolute aristocratic stock from
which he springs. I shall remember it. This Thorin seems an alert
fellow. You must send for him. Bring him up to Paris. Have him
under your hand when the time comes. He may be able to reveal other
things. He says there that Saint-Just is a thief as well as a
scoundrel. He may allude to other thefts besides that of his wife.
Lose no time, Camille. But remember to be cautious."</p>

<p>Desmoulins remembered everything but that. It was something he
had never learned. He talked freely, forgetting that Saint-Just was
still a popular idol; more than ever a popular idol since the late
disillusion occasioned by the disclosures of the Chabot scandal.
His dark hints were reported to Saint-Just, and evidently
understood by him, for some ten days later Desmoulins came again in
quest of Andr&eacute;-Louis, and this time he was in a condition of
dismay.</p>

<p>"The scoundrel has checkmated us. Thorin has come to Paris. But
he has come under arrest. He's lodged in the Conciergerie."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis was grave for a moment. Then he laughed.
"That's not checkmate, unless it's checkmate to himself. He has
magnificently deepened the extent of his turpitude."</p>

<p>But Desmoulins, white-faced, shook his head. "You suppose him a
fool. You're wrong. Thorin has been arrested for participation in a
royalist conspiracy. If it were not for that, Danton could smash
Saint-Just to pulp this moment from the tribune of the Convention.
Two questions would accomplish it. But to those questions that
astute devil has his answers. Thorin is a royalist conspirator. The
tale of his wife, an unsupported lie. She does not live with
Saint-Just. He is too clever for that. He keeps her in concealment.
I have been investigating and without Thorin's evidence there is
nothing to connect her with him."</p>

<p>"Damn your investigations," said Andr&eacute;-Louis. "That is
what has put Saint-Just on the alert. And then this fool
Thorin...To conspire..." He checked suddenly "What do you know of
the conspiracy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that! A trumped-up business, I should say. Easy enough in
these days."</p>

<p>"Yes. Easy enough. Easier for a man in Saint-Just's position to
issue a letter of cachet than ever it was for any King Louis. This
is what these villains make of liberty."</p>

<p>"Say that again," cried Desmoulins, and seized a pencil and a
scrap of paper from the writing-table.</p>

<p>"I'll say it again; but you must not use it until the time
comes."</p>

<p>"When will that be?"</p>

<p>"After I have been to Bl&eacute;rancourt."</p>

<p>"What?" Desmoulins straightened himself to look at him in
wonder.</p>

<p>"That is where the truth will lie. I'll go and see if I can
extract it. But while I am absent, not a word, not a single word of
the business, and above all, not a line about Saint-Just in the
Vieux Cordelier. An incautious premature word, and Saint-Just will
have the heads of the lot of us. He can do it, remember. The arrest
of Thorin shows you that he can do anything."</p>

<p>Desmoulins, intimidated&mdash;for he was really brave only with
the pen&mdash;swore to obey, then asked him how he proposed to
proceed.</p>

<p>"That's to be considered," said Andr&eacute;-Louis.</p>

<p>He considered it later with de Batz, who beheld at last in the
plan which Andr&eacute;-Louis expounded the fruition of all their
labours. And Andr&eacute;-Louis had come back to his first
impression.</p>

<p>"In arresting Thorin the blackguard over-reached himself. That
is, if at Bl&eacute;rancourt I can accomplish what I hope to
accomplish."</p>

<p>"If you do," said de Batz, "our battle will be won. Robespierre
and his Mountain will never survive the fresh storm we'll raise,
following so soon upon the last. You will definitely have opened
the way for the return of the King."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV - MESSENGERS</h2>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis had grown leaner than his habit in those
days, and this riot from any Lenten fare. For however hunger might
tighten its grip upon the people, there was no fasting for those
who could pay&mdash;and the Baron was certainly of these.</p>

<p>It was the mental strain of that time of intrigue and anxious
labour that had worn him; and mingled with this a yearning that
seemed to gnaw his vitals, intensified by the utter absence of
direct news from Aline de Kercadiou. He assured himself that it was
at the dictates of prudence that she had not sent him any letter by
any of the occasional messengers who passed between Monsieur
d'Entragues and his Paris agent, the Chevalier de Pomelles, and he
sought to content himself with the personal assurances which one or
two of these had been able to give him that Mademoiselle de
Kercadiou continued at Hamm with her father and that she was
well.</p>

<p>There had been a curious passage with Lang&eacute;ac, met by
merest chance at Pomelles' house at Bourg-Egalit&eacute;. One of
Andr&eacute;-Louis' periodic visits to the royalist agent in quest
of news had happened to synchronize with the arrival there of
Lang&eacute;ac coming straight from Hamm. It was the young
royalist's first visit to Paris since his flight after the
miscarried affair at the Temple.</p>

<p>At sight of Andr&eacute;-Louis he had visibly lost colour and
his eyes had dilated, so that Andr&eacute;-Louis had exclaimed:
"How now, Lang&eacute;ac. Am I a ghost?"</p>

<p>"Faith! It is what I ask myself."</p>

<p>It was Andr&eacute;-Louis' turn to stare. "Do you mean that you
have supposed me dead for all these months?"</p>

<p>"What else was I to suppose?"</p>

<p>"What else? What else? Name of a name! But Verney followed you
to Hamm with the news of my survival. Did you never hear of
it?"</p>

<p>Lang&eacute;ac's expression was odd. He looked uncomfortable.
His eyes shifted under the other's keen regard, and it was only
after a long moment that he answered: "Ah, Verney. Verney was
delayed on the road&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But he got there ultimately," Andr&eacute;-Louis interrupted
him impatiently. The sluggishness of Lang&eacute;ac's wits had
always moved him to impatience. He had never concealed from
Lang&eacute;ac that he accounted him a fool, and Lang&eacute;ac had
resented this with all a fool's mean bitterness.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," he answered slowly, sneering. "He got there
ultimately. But I had left by then."</p>

<p>"Yet you have been there since. You are just arrived from there.
Did you never hear that I survived?"</p>

<p>"I never heard you mentioned that I can remember," drawled
Lang&eacute;ac. And further to put him down he added, "Why should
they mention you?"</p>

<p>Exasperated Andr&eacute;-Louis looked at the Chevalier de
Pomelles, who sat gravely listening. "He asks me that? I suppose
they know at Hamm what keeps me here in Paris. I suppose they are
aware that I risk the guillotine every day of the week in my
endeavours to wreck the revolution, and bring the House of Bourbon
back to France. I suppose they know it, Monsieur de Pomelles?"</p>

<p>"Oh, but of course they know it." The Chevalier was emphatic.
"They know it and esteem it."</p>

<p>That had happened two months ago, in September. Thereafter
Monsieur de Lang&eacute;ac had lingered in Paris until the fall of
Chabot and the popular ferment that had followed it. De Batz had
thought it right that some account of this should be sent to the
Regent, and with Andr&eacute;-Louis had sought Pomelles for the
purpose. Pomelles had agreed with him, and having Lang&eacute;ac
under his hand, proposed to use him as the bearer of the news.
There was at that moment in the minds of the members of the
Royalist Committee in Paris some little doubt as to the Regent's
precise whereabouts. Whilst there was no positive news that he had
yet left Hamm, it was known that his duty lay in Toulon, where the
royalists supported by Admiral Hood with the British fleet and by
some Spanish troops were making their resolute stand. The presence
amongst them of the representative of the House of Bourbon, on
whose behalf this stand was being made, was being so urgently
demanded that it was probable he would already have set out to
place himself at their head. But in the absence of positive
information, Lang&eacute;ac's instructions were that he should go
to Hamm in the first instance, following the Regent thence if he
should already have departed, and making his way to Toulon by sea
from Leghorn or some other convenient Italian port, since by land
the place was unapproachable.</p>

<p>As he was setting out Andr&eacute;-Louis came to ask of him the
favour of bearing a letter to Mademoiselle de Kercadiou. It was a
letter whose chief object was to beg her to send him, be it but a
line in her own hand, herself to confirm the assurances he received
indirectly that all was well with her and with his godfather.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Lang&eacute;ac accepted perforce the commission, and
there could be little doubt that he had executed it, since it was
known that in spite of those insistent demands for the Regent's
presence in Toulon, his highness was still at Hamm when
Lang&eacute;ac arrived there, and indeed for some time
thereafter.</p>

<p>His lingering there was a circumstance exasperating to a good
many of Monsieur's supporters, and to none more exasperating than
to the Comte d'Avaray, whose affection for him was sincere, who had
his honour at heart, and who was distressed to know that his
neglect of it in this hour of crisis was by many being assigned to
pusillanimity.</p>

<p>It may well be that pusillanimity and sloth played some part in
that reluctance to depart from the dull security of Hamm. Monsieur
d'Entragues, however, did not think so, and Monsieur d'Entragues
was not happy. To him, whatever reasons there may have been to
account for the Regent's inaction, it was clear that one of them
was his infatuation for Mademoiselle de Kercadiou. Out of his
cynical knowledge of men Monsieur d'Entragues was persuaded that
the real cure for this lay in possession. Therefore he had
practised patience. But time was passing. The Regent's interests
demanded his presence in Toulon. Yet if he advised this, he might
miss his chance of encompassing the supplanting of Madame de Balbi,
and so, of assuming a definite and abiding ascendancy over
d'Avaray. Thus d'Entragues was confronted with a choice of evils,
and in his heart he cursed the prudishness of Mademoiselle de
Kercadiou which had made her withstand in all these months the
assiduous wooing of his highness.</p>

<p>What, in Heaven's name, did the girl want? Had she no sense of
duty to a prince of the blood? It was not even as if she were
restrained by any mawkish sense of duty in any other quarter, since
she believed that her unspeakable plebeian lover Moreau had
perished four months ago. And what the devil ailed his highness
that he should be so patient and so nice? Since Monsieur knew his
own mind, why didn't he take a short way with the girl? He loved to
be accounted a libertine. Why the devil couldn't he behave like
one?</p>

<p>D'Entragues had thoughts of giving him a hint to that effect.
But he hesitated. And meanwhile d'Avaray was at the Regent's elbow,
pressing him with talk of honour and duty to go and encourage by
his presence those who were ready to lay down their lives for him
in Toulon.</p>

<p>Things were in this pass when Lang&eacute;ac arrived at Hamm
with the news of the events in Paris which were shaking the credit
of the Convention in the eyes of the people. He reported himself to
d'Entragues, and d'Entragues carried him off to the Regent, and was
the only witness to the interview in that long bare room of the
chalet, where his highness kept a diminished court, now that his
brother d'Artois had departed for Russia to solicit the support of
the Empress.</p>

<p>The morning had been an unhappy one for his highness. D'Avaray
had been more than usually insistent upon the Prince's duty in
Toulon. The news brought by Lang&eacute;ac dissipated some of his
gloom.</p>

<p>"It is something at last," he approved. "More I confess than
ever I had expected from that Gascon braggart."</p>

<p>In correcting the ungracious Prince's impression, it may be that
Lang&eacute;ac spoke to his instructions without reflecting, or it
may be that like a mean sycophant he was in haste to curry favour
by discrediting the Baron.</p>

<p>"It is, monseigneur, less the work of Monsieur de Batz than of
Moreau."</p>

<p>"Moreau?" The bulging eyes of his highness grew round in their
stare. Then, recollection returning to him, he frowned. "Ah!
Moreau? He is still alive, then?" He conveyed the impression that
he was not pleased. A difficult man, thought Lang&eacute;ac.</p>

<p>"He has an uncanny gift of life, monseigneur."</p>

<p>His highness appeared to have lost interest in the news. Shortly
he thanked Monsieur de Lang&eacute;ac for his diligence, and
dismissed him.</p>

<p>Monsieur d'Entragues conducted him. A lodging was prepared for
him in the chalet. But this was not the cause of the Count's
civility.</p>

<p>"Touching this man Moreau," he said, when they were outside the
Regent's room; "it were best that you did not mention to anybody
the fact that he is still alive. Reasons of State. You
understand?"</p>

<p>"Not to anybody?" Lang&eacute;ac questioned. His foolish face
was vacuous.</p>

<p>"That is what I said, sir. You will mention it to nobody."</p>

<p>"But that is impossible. I have a letter from him. A letter for
Mademoiselle de Kercadiou. If she is still here in Hamm&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was interrupted. "The letter changes nothing. You will give
it to me. I ask for it in the name of his highness. And you will
forget that you bore it." Under Lang&eacute;ac's puzzled regard, he
repeated: "Reasons of State. Grave reasons of State, which I am not
at liberty to explain to you."</p>

<p>There was a pause. Then Lang&eacute;ac shrugged, surrendered the
letter and gave the required promise. It is possible that his
unfriendliness towards Andr&eacute;-Louis may have helped to render
him indifferent.</p>

<p>The Comte d'Entragues returned to his highness. "This man Moreau
has written again," he dryly announced.</p>

<p>"Written?" The Regent looked up at him. His eyes were dull.</p>

<p>"To Mademoiselle de Kercadiou. I have the letter here. We can
hardly suffer it to be delivered now. It will betray the fact that
there have been other letters."</p>

<p>His highness was quick to grasp the implication. "Damn your
meddling, d'Entragues. Is this all that's to come of it? If this
fellow Moreau survives in the end your suppression of his letters
will come to be discovered. How shall we look then?"</p>

<p>"My shoulders will bear that burden, monseigneur. No need to
betray your highness' part in a measure charitably intended. And,
anyway, it is unlikely that he will survive. His luck cannot hold
for ever."</p>

<p>"Ha! But if it does?"</p>

<p>The Count's lean, swarthy face, so deeply scored with lines
despite his comparative youth, was inscrutable. The glance of his
dark eyes was steady. "Does your highness ask me?"</p>

<p>"You heard me."</p>

<p>"In your place, monseigneur," he said quietly and slowly, "I
should so have contrived by now that news of Moreau's survival, if
it reached Mademoiselle de Kercadiou at all, should reach her too
late to be welcome, too late to matter."</p>

<p>"My God! What are you suggesting?"</p>

<p>"That your highness has been too patient."</p>

<p>The Regent appeared to be scandalized.</p>

<p>D'Entragues elaborated. "To be patient in these matters is no
mark of gallantry. Women are not flattered by it. They'll sooner
forgive an excess of ardour. Lukewarm desire is a reflection on
their charms."</p>

<p>"Morbleu, d'Entragues! You're a villain."</p>

<p>"In the service of your highness I am whatever will serve you
best. And where's the villainy? I have never known you hesitate to
employ those powers which past experience must have shown your
highness that you possess over all women. Why should you hesitate
to employ them now? Toulon awaits you impatiently. Yet you cannot
decide to go. I perfectly understand this reluctance. What I do not
understand is that you should be jeopardizing everything to
this&mdash;your highness will forgive the word&mdash;to this
infatuation."</p>

<p>"A thousand devils, d'Entragues!" His highness was peevish. "Now
you talk like d'Avaray, who has presumed to preach me a sermon on
my duty which lasted for over an hour."</p>

<p>"I talk not at all like d'Avaray. D'Avaray does not understand
your difficulties. He offers you a choice of evils. You are to be
false to your duty or false to your feelings. I show you how both
may be served. Set out for Toulon. But take Mademoiselle de
Kercadiou with you."</p>

<p>"Ah! The advice is easily given. But would she come? Would she
come?"</p>

<p>D'Entragues' steady glance continued levelled upon the big,
florid countenance of his master. The faintest of smiles, in which
there was a tinge of cruelty, hovered about his thin lips. Slowly,
significantly, at last, he said: "In certain circumstances there is
no doubt that she would go."</p>

<p>The bulging eyes shifted to avoid the minister's glance.</p>

<p>"And Kercadiou?" he asked. "What of him? Would he..." He could
not find words in which to conclude the sentence.</p>

<p>D'Entragues shrugged. "Monsieur de Kercadiou has no higher sense
than the sense of his duty to the blood royal. It would surprise me
if he had not the same sense of the duty of his womenfolk. But if
you doubt it, monseigneur, if the presence of Monsieur de Kercadiou
restrains you..."</p>

<p>Into the Count's thoughtful pause flashed the Prince's swift
assertion: "It does. Damnably. What else do you suppose has
restrained me? What else is responsible for this patience of mine
which you presume to deplore?"</p>

<p>"It would be easy to remove him," said the intriguer
quietly.</p>

<p>He disclosed the means. Let the Regent announce his departure
for Toulon, which, after all, could no longer be delayed. He would
go by way of Turin and Leghorn. There was an urgent message to be
sent to the Prince de Conde in Belgium, and meanwhile, Monsieur de
Langeac, their usual messenger, would already have been despatched
elsewhere. The only other person whom the Regent could spare from
attendance to bear those letters to Conde was Monsieur de
Kercadiou. His niece could hardly accompany him on such a mission.
She would remain in Hamm. The presence there of Kercadiou's cousin,
Madame de Plougastel, would make this easy.</p>

<p>The Regent sat considering, his chin upon his breast. His face
had lost some of its high colour. Temptation, so fiendishly
presented, had him by the throat.</p>

<p>"And afterwards?" he asked.</p>

<p>The Comte d'Entragues permitted himself a cynical little
laugh.</p>

<p>"Preventive measures may have been employed against your
highness in the past. I do not know. But has your highness ever
been troubled afterwards?"</p>

<p>And so it came to pass that in the afternoon, Lang&eacute;ac,
barely rested from his journey, was riding out of Hamm again, this
time charged with the arrangement of relays along the road by which
his highness was to travel in the course of the next few days. It
was only after his departure that the urgent need of a courier for
the Prince de Conde was discovered, and Monsieur de Kercadiou
invited, in default of any other, to undertake the task. It was not
for the Lord of Gavrillac to shirk a duty, whatever it might be, in
the service of his Prince. His instructions were that upon the
performance of his errand he was to return to Hamm, and there await
the further orders of the Regent.</p>

<p>If Aline was anxious on her uncle's behalf, she displayed no
sign of it. Anxieties on her own she had none. She would await his
return in Hamm. Meanwhile, the only care she manifested was
concerned with the details of his equipment for the journey.</p>

<p>Not only in the chalet, but among the few &eacute;migr&eacute;s
elsewhere in the village there was now relief and satisfaction. At
last Monsieur was to bestir himself to action and hasten to
Toulon.</p>

<p>The only person whom the events at all disgruntled was the Comte
de Plougastel. Younger than the Lord of Gavrillac by ten years, of
great physical vigour and endurance, accustomed moreover to come
and go as an ambassador of the Princes, he took it as a personal
reflection upon his ability in these matters that Monsieur de
Kercadiou should have been preferred to him for that mission to the
camp of the Prince de Conde. He complained of it to
d'Entragues.</p>

<p>"To be frank, I find it very odd. I am curious to know in what I
have deserved Monsieur's displeasure."</p>

<p>"His displeasure. My dear Plougastel! It is the very contrary.
His highness esteems you so highly that he desires you near his
person in this crisis."</p>

<p>Plougastel's face lightened. "I am, then, to accompany him to
Toulon?"</p>

<p>"That is hardly possible, however desirable to his highness. You
will understand that Monsieur's attendance on that journey must be
reduced to the bare minimum."</p>

<p>"But then?" Plougastel was frowning again. "Monsieur
d'Entragues, it seems to me that you contradict yourself. Monsieur
does not send me on a mission of a kind in which I am experienced.
He sends in my place a man who is barely equal to the fatigue of
the journey. Especially in this December weather. He does this
because he desires me near his person. Yet in two days' time, when
he departs for Toulon, I am to be left behind."</p>

<p>D'Entragues was smooth with him. "Things often appear
contradictory without being so at heart. His highness has his own
ends to serve. I can tell you no more. If you are not satisfied,
you must ask Monsieur himself."</p>

<p>Plougastel departed more aggrieved than he had come, and went to
plague his countess with his ill-humoured conjectures.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI - THE INTERRUPTION</h2>

<p>Aline sat in the room above stairs which for nearly a year now
she and her uncle had occupied at the Bear Inn. Never in her life
had she felt more alone than on this evening of that day on which
Monsieur de Kercadiou had set out on his long ride to Conde in
Belgium. The loneliness of it seemed to renew the sense of
bereavement which had been with her in those black weeks just after
she had received the news of the death of Andr&eacute;-Louis. She
was weary at heart and despondent. Life seemed a dreary
emptiness.</p>

<p>She had supped alone, very sparingly and mechanically. The table
had been cleared, and the candles snuffed. In a kindly sympathetic
apprehension of her loneliness, the landlord had come in person to
perform this little service and solicitously to inquire if there
was anything still lacking for her comfort.</p>

<p>She sat sadly dreaming, a book of Horace in her lap, a
translation of the Odes. It was not a volume she would have chosen
for her own entertainment. Yet it had been her constant companion
in these last five months. It had been a favourite with
Andr&eacute;-Louis; and she read what he had so often read, merely
so that she might turn her mind into channels in which his own had
flowed. Thus she sought the fond delusion of a spiritual
communion.</p>

<p>But to-night the words she had read remained meaningless.
Loneliness weighed too heavily upon her. To dispel it, at last,
towards ten o'clock, came the Regent.</p>

<p>He entered quietly and unheralded. He had been a frequent
visitor in this unconventional manner, coming upon her at all hours
of the day in the last three months.</p>

<p>Softly he closed the door, and from the threshold stood
observing her. He had removed his round hat; but he was still
heavily cloaked, and his shoulders were lightly powdered with
snow.</p>

<p>From the street below at that moment rose the hoarse voice of
the night watchmen calling the hour of ten. Rising slowly to
receive him, that call prompted the form of her greeting.</p>

<p>"It is late for your highness to be abroad."</p>

<p>A smile softened the stare of the prominent eyes. "Late or
early, my dear Aline, I exist to serve you." He loosened his cloak,
slipped it from his shoulders, and moved forward to fling it across
a chair. Then the heavy, paunchy figure marched upon her with its
lilting strut. He came to a halt very close to her upon the hearth,
and mechanically spread one of his podgy white hands to the blaze;
for the solicitudinous landlord had lately made up the fire.</p>

<p>He considered her in silence. He seemed tongue-tied, and an odd
nervousness, an indefinable apprehension began to creep upon
her.</p>

<p>"It is late," she said again. "I was about to retire. I am none
so well to-night, and very weary."</p>

<p>"Ay, you are pale. My poor child. You will be lonely, too. It
was this decided me to seek you, despite the hour. I feel myself to
blame." He sighed. "But, child, necessity knows no laws. I had to
send to Conde and there was none left at hand but your uncle whom I
could employ."</p>

<p>"My uncle, monseigneur, was very willing. We are dutiful. Your
highness has no ground for self-reproach."</p>

<p>"Not unless you have reproaches for me."</p>

<p>"I, monseigneur? If I have a reproach for you it is for having
given yourself concern on my behalf. You should not have troubled
to seek me so late. And it is snowing. You should not have
come."</p>

<p>"Not come? Knowing you lonely here?" Very gently, yet with an
odd ardour he complained. "How far you still are from understanding
me, Aline." He took her hands. "You are cold. And how pale!" He
lowered his eyes from her face to continue his survey of her. She
wore a taffeta gown of apple green cut low in the bodice as the
mode had prescribed when it was made. "I vow your cheeks put your
breast to shame for whiteness."</p>

<p>For this, it seemed, he could have found no better medicine than
his words. A flush overspread her pallid face, and gently she
sought to disengage her hands. But he maintained his grip.</p>

<p>"Why, child, will you be afraid of me? This is unkind. And I
have been so patient. So patient that I scarcely know myself."</p>

<p>"Patient?" There was a kindling in her eyes, a frown between
them. All timidity left her, to be replaced by dignity.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur, it grows late. I am here alone. I am sensible of
your interest. But you do me too much honour."</p>

<p>"Not half the honour I desire to do you. Aline, why will you be
cruel? Why will you be indifferent to my suffering? Does this soft
white bosom hold a heart of stone? Or is it that you do not trust
me? They have told you that I am fickle. They malign me, Aline. Or
else, if I have been fickle, it is yours to cure me of that. I
could be constant to you, child. Constant as the stars."</p>

<p>He loosed one of her hands, to set his ponderous arm about her
shoulders. He sought to draw her to him, but found in her an
unsuspected strength which the soft, flabby fellow could not
subdue.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur, this is not worthy." She wrenched herself free,
and stood straight and tense before him, her head high. He watched
the play of the candlelight in her hair of gold, the ebb and flow
of colour in her delicate cheeks, the curve of her lovely throat,
and became exasperated by her unreasonableness. Was he not a prince
of the blood? Who, after all, was she? The daughter of a rustic
Breton nobleman, the child of a house of no account; yet she
fronted him with the airs of a duchess. Worse. For there was no
duchess in France, he was convinced, would have offered such cold
reserves to his wooing. Of all the princes of the blood he stood
nearest to the throne and was likely to be king one day. Did she
overlook this in her silly prudishness? Was she insensible to the
honour which he did her, to the honours which might be hers?</p>

<p>But he gave utterance to none of these unanswerable arguments.
There was a cold rustic virtue here that was not to be melted by
them. In his anger his passion was in danger of transmutation.
Indeed, it stood delicately poised upon the borderline. He was
moved almost to a desire to hurt her. Obeying it, he might have
taken a short way with the little fool; but he loathed all violent
action. He was too overburdened with flesh and too scant of breath;
and from the manner in which she had disengaged herself from his
grasp he actually doubted if his strength would prove a match for
hers.</p>

<p>He must have recourse to subtlety. He had always more faith in
his wits than in his sinews.</p>

<p>"Not worthy?" he echoed. He looked at her sadly, his big liquid
eyes full of a pathetic pleading. "So be it, child. You shall
school me in worth. For if there is one thing in this world of
which I would be worthy, you are that thing. I set worthiness of
that above worthiness of the throne itself." Thus he reminded her
how near the throne he stood. But it seemed to have no weight with
the little fool.</p>

<p>She continued wrapped in a dignity which made her seem of
ice.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur, I am alone here," she was beginning and there she
checked to look at him more keenly, the throb of a sudden thought
perceptible in her quickening glance.</p>

<p>She reviewed in a flash the past months in which he had imposed
his companionship upon her; remembered the esteem in which she had
held it, the flattery which she had accounted it. She recalled
occasional attempts of his to overstep the boundaries of a platonic
friendship, but how quickly on each occasion he had retreated the
moment she had shown it to be unwelcome. Reviewing all those lapses
now in the aggregate, she blamed herself for having lacked the wit
to perceive whither he was ultimately aiming. In her blindness and
in her very listlessness, it seemed to her now that she had
encouraged him by continuing a companionship in which such lapses
had been repeated. Not a doubt but he had classed her with those
who, like the woman in the song, vowing that she would ne'er
consent, consented. Perhaps he had thought her restrained by the
lack of proper opportunity. And now he had created it.</p>

<p>"Was it for this," she asked him, "that you sent my uncle on a
mission to the Prince de Conde? To leave me here defenceless?"</p>

<p>"Defenceless? What a word, Aline! What defence do you need other
than that of your will? Would any dare do violence to it? Not I, at
least."</p>

<p>"You reassure me, monseigneur." Was she ironical, he wondered.
And then, with an inclination of her dainty head, she added: "I
beg, monseigneur, that you will leave me."</p>

<p>But he remained squarely planted on his stout legs, and with his
head a little on one side surveyed her, archly smiling. "I am not
used to be dismissed," he reminded her.</p>

<p>She put a hand to her brow in a gesture of weariness. "Your
highness will forgive me. But etiquette here..."</p>

<p>"You are right, and I am wrong. What need to regard etiquette
between us, my dear?"</p>

<p>"I understood that you insisted upon the rights of your
rank."</p>

<p>"With you? As if I should! Have I ever done so? Have I ever been
the Prince to you?"</p>

<p>"You have always been the Prince to me, monseigneur."</p>

<p>"Then it has not been by my insistence. To you I have never
desired to be more than just a man; the man for whom you might come
to care, Aline; the man whose devotion might melt you into
perceiving some worth in him. Does it offend you, child, to hear me
say I love you? Does it offend you that I offer you my worship, as
I offer you my destiny, my very life?"</p>

<p>He was the suppliant now. The fat voice was softly modulated.
There was something akin to a tear in it. And he went on without
giving her time to answer him.</p>

<p>"You have aroused in me feelings that seem to have changed my
nature. I have no thought but of you, no care but to be near you,
no fear but the fear of losing you. Is all this nothing to you?
Nothing it may be. But offend you it cannot. If you are indeed a
woman, and God knows you are that, Aline, it must move you to
compassion for me. I suffer. Can you be insensible? Will you see a
man so tortured that he must end by being false to himself, false
to his mission, false to his very duty because you have made him
mad?"</p>

<p>"This is wild talk, monseigneur!" she cried out, and then
abruptly presented him with the question: "What does your highness
want of me?"</p>

<p>"What I want?" he faltered. Plague take the girl. Could a man be
more explicit? Did she think to checkmate him by asking him to
express the inexpressible? "What I want!" He opened wide his arms.
"Aline!"</p>

<p>But here was no eagerness to respond to the invitation and fling
herself upon that portly, royal bosom. She continued to regard him
with a quizzically bitter little smile.</p>

<p>"If you will not say it, monseigneur, why, then, I will. Thus we
shall be clear. You are asking me to become your mistress, I
think."</p>

<p>If she thought to abash him by thus reducing to its precise
terms the relationship he sought, she was profoundly at fault. His
great liquid eyes opened a little wider in astonishment.</p>

<p>"What else can I offer you, my dear? I am already married. And
if I were not, there would still be my rank. Though I swear to you
that it should count for little with me if it were an obstacle in
my way to you. I would barter all for you, and count myself the
gainer. I swear I should."</p>

<p>"That is easily sworn, monseigneur."</p>

<p>Gloom descended upon him. "You do not believe me. You do not
believe even the evidence of your own senses. Why am I here? Why do
I tarry in Hamm at such a time as this? For many weeks now it has
daily been dinned into my ears that my place is in Toulon with
those who are making a stand there for throne and altar. Three days
ago there arrived here a gentleman sent to me by the royalist
committee in Paris, who permitted himself to point out to me my
duty, to demand in the name of the nobility of France that I should
render myself at once to Toulon and place myself at the head of the
forces there. The terms of the demand were presumptuous. And yet I
was robbed of even the satisfaction of resenting them, because in
my heart I knew that they were justified. I know that I have been
false to my duty, to myself, to my house, and to the brave
defenders of Toulon. And why have I been false? Because my love for
you has put trammels upon me which will not permit me to move. I am
chained here, chained to the spot that holds you, Aline. My house
may be destroyed, my chances of succeeding to the throne may
perish, my honour may go hang before I will be false to my love for
you. Does that tell you nothing? Does it afford you no proof of my
sincerity? Does it give you no glimpse into the depth of it? Can
you still, when you consider this, suppose that I am offering you
some trivial and transient passion?"</p>

<p>That she was deeply moved, deeply shaken, he perceived at once.
The mantle of dignity in which she had so coldly wrapped herself
was permitted to slip from her shoulders. She was pale, and her
eyes no longer met his ardent glance with their earlier defiant
fearlessness. Although her words still sought to fence him off,
they lacked their former bold uncompromising tone.</p>

<p>"But that is all over now. You have conquered this unworthy
weakness, monseigneur. You start for Toulon on the day after
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Do I? Do I, indeed? Who will guarantee that? Not I, by my
soul."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" She was looking at him in alarm, leaning
forward towards him. He was instantly aware of it; instantly aware
that what he had alarmed was her sense of what was due, her concern
for those men of her own aristocratic class who had raised the
royal standard at Toulon and who were depending upon his presence
amongst them. He was quick to perceive how her loyalties were
aroused, how intolerable to her must be the thought that those
gentlemen should look for him in vain.</p>

<p>"What do I mean?" he answered slowly, a crooked smile on his
full sensuous lips. "I mean, Aline, that the fate of Toulon, the
fate of the royalist cause itself is in your hands at this moment.
Let that prove to you the depth of my sincerity."</p>

<p>She drew nearer by a step. Her breath quickened. "Oh, you are
mad!" she cried. "Mad! You are a prince, the representative of
France. Will you allow a whim, a caprice, to make you false to your
duty, false to those brave souls who count upon you, who are
exposing their lives for you and your house?"</p>

<p>She had come so near to him in her intentness that he was
scarcely under the necessity of moving so as to place his left arm
round her. He drew her close. Passively she suffered it, listening
for his reply, so engrossed in it perhaps as scarcely to be
conscious of what he did, or, at least, scarcely caring.</p>

<p>"At need I will do no less," he answered her. "What do I care
for anything in this world compared with the care I have for you?
My conduct shall prove it. I'll throw away the chances of a throne
at need, to show you how little a thing is a throne to me when set
against your love, Aline."</p>

<p>"Ah, but you must not. You must not! Oh, this is madness."</p>

<p>She struggled within the coil of his arm. But it was a feeble
protesting struggle, very different from that masterful wrench with
which earlier she had disengaged herself. "Do you mean that you
will not go to Toulon?" There was a horror in her voice as she
asked the question.</p>

<p>"That is what I mean, at need. It is in your hands, Aline."</p>

<p>"How in my hands? How in my hands? What are you saying? Why will
you put this thing&mdash;this dreadful thing&mdash;upon me?"</p>

<p>"To afford you the proof you need."</p>

<p>"I need no proof. You owe me no proof of anything. There is
nothing between us to be proved. Nothing. Let me go, monseigneur!
Ah, let me go!"</p>

<p>"Why so I will, if you insist." But he held her firmly to him.
His face was within an inch or two of her own, so white and
piteous, so distractingly lovely. "But first hear me, and
understand me. I will not go to Toulon&mdash;I take oath here that
I will not go&mdash;that I will not leave Hamm&mdash;unless I have
assurance of your love, unless I have proof of it, my Aline; proof
of it, do you understand?"</p>

<p>As he ended his right arm went round her to reinforce his left,
he drew her closer still against him, and his lips descended upon
hers and held them.</p>

<p>Under that kiss she shivered, and thereafter lay limp in his
embrace. Thus for a few heart-beats she suffered him to hold her,
and in that time her thoughts travelled far down the past and far
into the future, for thought knows naught of time and is not to be
held within its narrow confines. Andr&eacute;-Louis, her lover, the
man for whom she would have kept herself, and to keep herself for
whom none could ever have robbed her of her strength, had been dead
these six months. She had mourned him, and she had entered into the
resignation without which life on earth would be unbearable to so
many. But something had gone from her which had left her without
definite orientation. What did she matter now? To whom could she
matter ever again? If this gross Prince desired her; if his desire
of her pushed him to such mad lengths that unless he had his way he
would betray those of her class and blood who depended upon him,
then for their sake, for the sake of her loyalties, for the sake of
all that she had been reared to reverence let her sacrifice
herself.</p>

<p>Thus, in some nebulous way, during that dreadful moment of his
embrace, did her thoughts travel. And then she grew conscious of a
sound behind and beyond him. For a moment thereafter his arms
continued to enfold her, his lips still pressed her own which were
so cold and unresponsive, suffering him in such deadly indifference
to have his will upon them. Then he, too, became aware of that
movement. He broke away from her abruptly, and turned.</p>

<p>The door had opened, and on the threshold two gentlemen stood at
gaze. They were the Comte d'Entragues and the Marquis de La Guiche.
The Count's mobile countenance wore a faint, cynical smile of
complete understanding. The Marquis, spurred and booted and
splashed from travelling, looked on with a black scowl on his
hawk-face. And it was he who spoke, his voice harsh and rasping,
void of all the deference in which royalty is to be addressed.</p>

<p>"We interrupt you, monseigneur. But it is necessary. The matter
is urgent, and cannot wait."</p>

<p>The Regent, at a disadvantage, sought to array himself in frosty
dignity. But in such an emergency his figure did not assist the
operation. He achieved pompousness.</p>

<p>"What is this, messieurs? How dare you break in upon me?"</p>

<p>D'Entragues presented his companion and his explanations in a
breath. "This is Monsieur le Marquis de La Guiche, monseigneur. He
has just arrived in Hamm. He is from Toulon with urgent
messages."</p>

<p>He might have said more, but the furious Regent gave him no
time.</p>

<p>"There is no urgency can warrant such an intrusion when I am
private. Am I become of no account?"</p>

<p>It was the Marquis de la Guiche who answered him, his voice
stingingly incisive. "I begin to think so, monseigneur."</p>

<p>"What's that?" The Regent could not believe that he heard
correctly. "What did you say?"</p>

<p>La Guiche, dominant, masterful, his face wicked with anger,
ignored the question.</p>

<p>"The matter that brings me cannot wait."</p>

<p>The Regent, in increasing unbelief, looked down his nose at him.
"You are insolent. You do not know your place. You will wait upon
my convenience, sir."</p>

<p>But the other's voice, growing more harshly vibrant, flung back
at him: "I wait upon the convenience of the royalist cause,
monseigneur. Its fate is in the balance, and delays may wreck it.
That is why I insisted with Monsieur d'Entragues that he should
bring me to you instantly wherever you might be." And without more,
contemptuous, peremptory, he added the question: "Will you hear me
here, or will you come with us?"</p>

<p>The Regent gave him a long arrogant stare before which the
other's intrepid glance never wavered. Then his highness waved him
out with one of his plump white hands.</p>

<p>"Go, sir. I follow."</p>

<p>De La Guiche bowed stiffly and went, d'Entragues accompanying
him and closing the door.</p>

<p>The Regent, white and trembling, turned again to Mademoiselle de
Kercadiou. There was a black rage in his heart. But he mastered it
to speak to her.</p>

<p>"I will return presently, child," he promised her.
"Presently."</p>

<p>He took his strutting way to the door, leaving his cloak where
it lay.</p>

<p>Dazed with fear and shame, for she had read the thoughts of La
Guiche as if they had been printed on his face, she watched
Monsieur depart. She stood, with one hand clutching at her heaving
bosom, until his footsteps, accompanied by those of his two
companions, had faded on the stairs. Then she span round, went down
on her knees by a chair, and burying her face in her hands lay
there convulsed by sobs.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII - THE CANDID MARQUIS</h2>

<p>Monsieur was trembling from head to foot when he stepped out of
that room on the first floor of the Bear Inn. He was at once racked
by chagrin at the inopportuneness of the interruption and swept by
anger at the manner of it.</p>

<p>On the gallery he found the two gentlemen awaiting him.
D'Entragues lounged against the rail. La Guiche stood tense. He
too, was trembling. But it was with anger only. Hot-tempered,
downright, this intrepid soldier, with his contempt of courts, was
the bearer of a message of some peremptoriness which he did not now
intend to soften.</p>

<p>In the moment of waiting for the Regent to follow them, the
Marquis had looked with flaming eyes at d'Entragues.</p>

<p>"So it is true, then!" he had said in deepest bitterness.
D'Entragues had shrugged, cynical ever in words as in smile. "What
is there to grow hot about?"</p>

<p>La Guiche's glance of contempt had been as a blow. Beyond that
he made no answer. He disdained to waste words on this fribble. He
would save what he had to say for the Prince.</p>

<p>And now the Prince stood before them, his big face white, his
glance one of haughty annoyance.</p>

<p>In the common-room, which the gallery overlooked, some townsfolk
sat over their cards and backgammon. The interview could not take
place here within public earshot. This Monsieur at once perceived,
despite his disordered condition.</p>

<p>"Follow me," he commanded, and led the way down the stairs.</p>

<p>The landlord ushered them presently into a little room on the
ground floor, lighted candles from the taper which he carried, and
left them.</p>

<p>And now the Regent, shaking himself like a turkey-cock and
puffing out his chest, prepared to loose upon them his
displeasure.</p>

<p>"It seems that I am come so low that even my privacy is to be
invaded; that there are even gentlemen of birth so indifferent to
the respect that is due to my person as not to hesitate to thrust
themselves upon me without leave. I will reserve what else I have
to say until I hear your explanations."</p>

<p>La Guiche did not keep him waiting. He answered him
contemptuously.</p>

<p>"You may not consider it worth saying, monseigneur, when you
have heard. The explanations are abundant, and I warn you that they
are not pleasant."</p>

<p>"It would surprise me if they were." The Prince actually
sneered. His ill-humour vented itself blindly, as does ever the
ill-humour of a stupid man. "I have almost abandoned hope of
hearing any news that is not unpleasant; so ill-served am I."</p>

<p>"Ill-served!" The Marquis went white to the lips. His eyes
blazed. In that hour no taunt could more effectively have inflamed
him, and he cast to the winds the last vestige of respect for the
august person he addressed. "Ill-served does your highness say? My
God!" An instant he paused. Then he plunged recklessly into his
report. "I am from Toulon, which declared for you, declared for the
King three months ago. Ever since we raised the royal standard
there our strength has grown. The royalists of the Midi have
flocked to us; even some who were not royalists, but whom the fall
of the Girondins has exasperated against the present government,
have come to join us. The English fleet under Admiral Hood is
there, and troops have come to our support from Spain and from
Sardinia. From Toulon it was our chance to raise the South, to stir
it to a movement that would have swept France clear of her
revolution.</p>

<p>"To accomplish this, to awaken enthusiasm, to stiffen courage,
we required the presence there of one of the Princes of the Blood;
of yourself, monseigneur, who are the representative of France, the
virtual head of the house for which we are fighting. The
demonstration of our devotion should have sufficed to bring you to
us. When it did not, we sent messenger after messenger to you, to
invite you, to implore you, almost to command you, to assume your
proper place at our head. As weeks passed and grew into months, and
still neither your own sense of what was fitting nor our
intercessions could move you, our courage began to dwindle. Men
began to ask themselves how could it happen that a Prince of the
Blood could be so negligent of his duty to men who were offering up
their lives out of their sense of duty to him."</p>

<p>Violently the Regent interrupted him. "Monsieur! You transcend
all tolerable terms. I will not listen to you until you choose to
address me with a proper deference. I will not listen to you."</p>

<p>"By God, you shall, if they are the last words I ever speak."
The Marquis stood between the Regent and the door, and so commanded
the situation physically. His anger gave him command of it morally
as well.</p>

<p>"Monsieur d'Entragues, I appeal to you," cried the Prince. "Do
your duty to me."</p>

<p>The embarrassment in which Monsieur d'Entragues had listened to
La Guiche's unmeasured terms was painfully increased by this
appeal.</p>

<p>"What can I do, monseigneur, if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing. You can do nothing," the Marquis harshly assured him.
"Nothing except be silent."</p>

<p>The Regent took a step forward. The sweat gleamed on his white
face. He made an imperious gesture. "Let me pass, monsieur. I will
listen to no more to-night. To-morrow if you are in a better frame
of mind I may receive you."</p>

<p>"To-morrow, monseigneur, I shall be gone. I ride again at dawn.
I am on my way to Brussels, in the service of your House and your
cause. So you must hear me to-night. For I have that to say which
you must know."</p>

<p>"My God, Monsieur de La Guiche! You have the temerity to do me
violence. To constrain me."</p>

<p>"I have a duty, monseigneur," the Marquis thundered, and he
swept on. "You are to know that in the last month rumours have been
growing in Toulon which do not flatter you; they have reached a
pitch at which they threaten jeopardy to your cause."</p>

<p>"Rumours, sir?" The Regent was arrested. "What rumours?"</p>

<p>"It is being said that you continue absent because, whilst
yonder in the South men faint and bleed and die for you, you are
kept here by a woman; that you are concerned only with the unworthy
pursuit of gallantry; that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By God, sir! I'll not endure another instant of this...this
outrage. The infamous lie!"</p>

<p>"Lie!" echoed the Marquis. "Do you say it is a lie, monseigneur?
Do you say it to me, who have just come upon you in the arms of
your wench?"</p>

<p>"D'Entragues!" The name came in a scream from the Regent's
twisted lips. "Will you suffer this? Will you suffer this insult to
your Prince? Compel this man to let me pass. I will not stay
another instant. And I shall not forget this, Monsieur de La
Guiche. Be sure that I shall not forget it."</p>

<p>"I desire you to remember it, monseigneur," he was fiercely
answered.</p>

<p>And now d'Entragues bestirred himself. He stepped forward.
"Monsieur le Marquis," he began, and set a hand upon La Guiche's
shoulder. He was suffered to say no more. With a violent sweep of
his left arm the Marquis sent him hurtling backwards until he
brought up breathless against the wall.</p>

<p>"A moment, and I've done. I come to you, monseigneur, from the
Comte de Maudet, who commands in Toulon, as you should know. His
instructions were precise. I was to see you in person, and tell you
in person what is being said. I was to bid you, not on the grounds
of duty, but on the grounds of honour, to attempt even at this late
hour to still these rumours and repair the harm to your cause by
rendering yourself at once to Toulon before it is too late; before
in sheer lassitude, and despondency of fighting for one who shows
so little disposition to fight for himself, those loyal men throw
down their arms.</p>

<p>"I have done, monseigneur. This is the last summons you will
receive. Even at this late hour your appearance in Toulon may
revive fainting spirits and give the lie to a dishonouring rumour
which it breaks my heart to know for the truth. Goodnight,
monseigneur."</p>

<p>Abruptly he turned and stepped to the door. He pulled it open.
The Regent, shaking, gasping, sweating, looked at him
balefully.</p>

<p>"Be sure that I shall not forget a word of this, Monsieur le
Marquis."</p>

<p>The Marquis bowed, his lips tight, passed out, and closed the
door.</p>

<p>Stepping into the common-room, he almost stepped into the arms
of the landlord, whom the raised voices had attracted to the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Curtly he desired to be conducted to the chamber appointed to
him for the night. There as curtly he desired to be called early,
and on that cut short the landlord's solicitude for his comfort.
But as the landlord was departing, the Marquis stayed him.</p>

<p>"What is the name of the lady in that room where I found his
highness?"</p>

<p>"That is Mademoiselle de Kercadiou."</p>

<p>The Marquis echoed the name, "Kercadiou!" Then he asked: "How
long has she been here? Here in Hamm?"</p>

<p>"Why, she arrived here from Coblentz at the same time as his
highness."</p>

<p>The Marquis shrugged disgustedly, and on that dismissed the
subject and the landlord.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the withdrawal of the Marquis had momentarily
increased the Regent's fury. As the door closed he had swung to his
remaining companion.</p>

<p>"D'Entragues! Will you suffer that ruffian to depart so?"</p>

<p>D'Entragues, almost as pale and shaken as his master by the
storm through which they had passed, was making for the door when
the Regent checked him.</p>

<p>"Stay! Wait! What does it matter? Let him go. Let him go." He
shook limp hands at the end of his raised arms. "What does it
matter? What does anything matter?" He reeled to a chair, and
sagged down into it. He mopped his brow. He whimpered
inarticulately. "Am I never to reach the bottom of this cup of
bitterness? Is this plague of sansculottism so widespread that even
men of birth forget their duty? What am I, d'Entragues? Am I a
Prince of the Blood, or just a child of the soil, an enfant de
roture? That a man, a gentleman born, should have been such a
scoundrel as to stand before my face and utter such things!
D'Entragues, it is the end of the world. The end of the world!"</p>

<p>He whimpered again. Body bowed in dejected collapse, arms
hanging limp between his knees, he sat there and wagged his great
head. After a while he spoke without looking up.</p>

<p>"Go, d'Entragues. You were of little use when there was anything
to be done. Nothing remains now. Go. Leave me."</p>

<p>The Count, glad to escape an atmosphere of so much discomfort,
mumbled "Monseigneur!" and took his departure, closing the door
softly.</p>

<p>The Regent sat on. Every now and then he uttered a long
shuddering sigh, provoked by the memory of the terrible indignity
he had suffered, by contemplation of a plight so sad that he was no
longer sheltered from insult.</p>

<p>At long length he rose, ponderously, wearily. He stood in
thought, his chin in his hand. His breathing grew steady, his
heart-beats normal again. He began to recover his composure.
Confidence returned. It would not always be thus. God would never
permit a Prince of the Blood to live out his life in such
circumstances. And when sanity was restored to the world, and each
man was returned to his proper place in it, the Marquis de La
Guiche should be fittingly schooled in duty and be made to pay for
his presumption.</p>

<p>It was a heartening reflection. It made him square his
shoulders, raise his head again, and resume his normal princely
carriage. And it must have brought back to him the memory of that
interview above-stairs so brutally interrupted in so very promising
a moment. For quite suddenly, with a shrug that seemed to cast off
every preoccupation, he quitted the room, crossed the outer
chamber, and once more ascended the stairs.</p>

<p>The landlord, watching him with curiously speculative eyes,
observed that he trod lightly. He continued to watch him until he
had entered the apartments of Monsieur de Kercadiou. Then with a
shrug the landlord went to snuff the candles.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII - THE CITIZEN-AGENT</h2>

<p>It must have been somewhere in the neighbourhood of
Christmas&mdash;his notes are not precise on the point&mdash;when
Andr&eacute;-Louis left Paris on his journey into Picardy, there to
assemble the material necessary for the master-stroke by which he
now confidently counted upon smashing Saint-Just.</p>

<p>"If you succeed," de Batz had said to him at parting, "the end
will be in sight. While you are gone the battle between Danton and
H&eacute;bert will be fought out. The issue of that struggle is
foregone. H&eacute;bert will be crushed. The H&eacute;bertists will
go the way of the Girondins, and the ground will have been cleared
for the final struggle for supremacy between Robespierre and
Danton. Bring back the means to pull down Saint-Just in shame and
disgrace, and Robespierre falls with him, torn down by a people who
will by then have lost all their illusions. Before the trees are
budding again in the Tuileries Gardens the throne will have been
set up once more and you will be celebrating your nuptials at
Gavrillac. So to it, Andr&eacute;, with all your courage and all
your wit. You carry Caesar and his fortunes."</p>

<p>He carried them in a berline down to the little town of
Bl&eacute;rancourt in the Aisne. He travelled of course as an agent
of the terrible Committee of Public Safety, armed with
unimpeachable credentials, and he was accompanied by the colossus
Boissancourt, who went with him in the guise of secretary.</p>

<p>His travelling carriage drew up before the principal inn which
until lately had been known as the Auberge des Lys. This, however,
being a sign too closely associated with the royal standard, had
recently been changed to the Auberge du Bonnet Rouge, and a
Phrygian cap had now been painted over the fleurs-de-lys which had
clustered on the old escutcheon.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis had dressed himself for the part with studied
care. "I take the stage in character," he had informed
Boissancourt. "Scaramouche never had a worthier role. We must not
neglect the details."</p>

<p>These consisted of a brown frock, tight-fitting, and none too
new; buckskins and knee boots with reversed tops; a tricolour sash
of taffeta, which he had carefully soiled, a neckcloth loosely
knotted, and a round black hat displaying a tricolour cockade.
Saving that there were no plumes in his hat, and that he had
replaced by a small-sword the sabre usually affected, he had all
the appearance of a representative <i>en mission</i>, which was the
impression that he desired to create without insistence.</p>

<p>With the massive Boissancourt rolling solemnly after him, he
swaggered into the inn with all that truculence of manner which
distinguished the revolutionary officials, those despots of the new
regime who modelled themselves upon their worse imaginings of the
despots of the old.</p>

<p>Authoritatively he announced his quality and condition,
presented Boissancourt as his secretary, demanded the best rooms
the landlord could afford him, and desired that the Mayor of
Bl&eacute;rancourt and the President of its Revolutionary Committee
be summoned at once to attend him.</p>

<p>He made a terrifying stir with his short, sharp sentences, his
peremptory manner and his penetrating glance. The landlord bowed
himself double in servility. Would the Citizen-Emissary&mdash;he
knew not how else to call him, and dared not be so familiar as to
call him merely Citizen&mdash;deign to step this way. The
Citizen-Emissary would understand that this was but a poor house.
Bl&eacute;rancourt was little better than a rustic village. But
such as it was the Citizen-Emissary could depend that the best it
commanded would be placed at his disposal. To conduct him, the
bowing landlord moved backwards before him as if he were royalty.
He protested as he went. His rooms were not such as he could wish
to offer the Citizen-Emissary. But the Citizen-Emissary would
recognize that he was a poor man, after all, just a country
landlord, and perhaps the Citizen-Emissary would not be too
exigent.</p>

<p>The Citizen-Emissary, following the retreating, cringing vintner
along the narrow stone-flagged passage, addressed his
secretary.</p>

<p>"How times have changed, Jerome! And how much for the better.
You perceive how the inspiring principles of democracy have
penetrated even to this poor little rustic town. Observe the
amiable deportment of this good landlord, who now fills his lungs
with the pure air of liberty. How different from the base servility
of the old days when the despots stalked through the land. Oh
blessed Liberty! Oh glorious Equality!"</p>

<p>Boissancourt blinked, and choked down his laughter.</p>

<p>But the landlord smirked and grinned and cringed the more under
that commendation, and so bowed them into a small, square room
whose window opened directly on to the courtyard. It was a
sitting-room. It was commonly used as a dining-room for travellers
desiring to be private. But, of course, during the
Citizen-Emissary's honouring visit, it would be reserved entirely
for his own use. A bedroom connected with it, and, if the
Citizen-Emissary approved, there was another bedroom across the
passage which might serve for the Citizen-Emissary's secretary.</p>

<p>The Citizen-Emissary took a turn in the room, surveying it
disdainfully, his nose in the air. The walls were whitewashed. Some
few pictures decorated them. The great man from Paris inspected
them. One was a reproduction of David's "Death of Marat." Before
this the Citizen-Emissary bowed his head as if before a shrine.
Another was an entirely apocryphal portrait of Doctor Guillotin.
There was a print of the Place de la Revolution with the guillotine
in its midst, and a legend under it: "The National Razor for the
Shaving of Traitors." There was a portrait of Mirabeau, and a
cartoon representing the triumph of the people over
despotism&mdash;a naked colossus with one foot upon a coroneted and
another upon a mitred homunculus.</p>

<p>"It is very well," said the Citizen-Emissary. "If these
represent your sentiments, I felicitate you."</p>

<p>The landlord, a mean, shrivelled little fellow, rubbed his hands
in gratification. He grew voluble on the subject of his principles.
The Citizen-Emissary, rudely contemptuous, interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. No need to protest so much. I shall see for myself
while I am here. There is a good deal I desire to see for myself."
There was something minatory in his tone and smile. The landlord
observed that his eyes were bitter. He fell silent, waiting.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis ordered dinner. The landlord desired him to
be particular.</p>

<p>"That is for you," he was told. "We have travelled, and we are
hungry. See that you feed us in a manner becoming servants of the
Nation. It will be a test of patriotism. After dinner I will see
your Mayor and the President of your Committee. Let them be
warned."</p>

<p>A wave of his hand dismissed the cringing rascal. Boissancourt
closed the door. He subdued his deep booming voice to mutter:</p>

<p>"In God's name, don't overdo it."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis smiled, and Boissancourt, too, observed that
Andr&eacute;-Louis' eyes were bitter.</p>

<p>"That is impossible. There never have been such despots in the
land as the apostles of equality. Besides, it's amusing to see
these poor rats dance to the tune which they themselves have
called."</p>

<p>"Maybe. But we are not here to amuse ourselves."</p>

<p>If the dinner was to be a test of patriotism, the landlord
proved himself a patriot of the stoutest. There was a broth
containing the essences of real meat, a tender and well-nourished
capon roasted with loving care, a bottle of wine which made them
dream themselves on the banks of the Garonne and the purest wheaten
bread they had tasted in months. There were other things that
mattered less. They were waited upon by the landlord's wife and
daughter with fearful solicitude.</p>

<p>"Well, well. They don't starve in the country, it seems," said
Boissancourt, "whatever they may do in Paris."</p>

<p>"Members of the government do not starve anywhere," snapped
Andr&eacute;-Louis. "That is what we are presently to demonstrate
to the starving people."</p>

<p>After dinner, when the table had been cleared, the Mayor of
Bl&eacute;rancourt arrived, a portly, moon-faced little man of
forty, named Foulard, sandy-haired, with dark little eyes that were
red and sore-looking. An air of consequence invested him.
Perceiving it, Andr&eacute;-Louis took the offensive at the outset.
He did not rise to receive the Mayor. He looked at him across the
table, on which some papers were now spread, and there was reproof
in the glance which he fixed upon the sash of office in which that
functionary's paunch was swathed.</p>

<p>"So you are the Mayor, eh? You're a thought too well nourished,
citizen. In Paris patriots grow lean."</p>

<p>The Citizen Foulard was taken aback. The assurance went out of
him visibly. His little eyes blinked at the massive Boissancourt
standing behind Andr&eacute;-Louis' chair. But he was too
intimidated by his reception to point out that there were no signs
of emaciation about the Citizen-Emissary's secretary.</p>

<p>"Life," he stammered, "is...is not so...so hard on us in the
country."</p>

<p>"So I perceive. You grow fat. And you do other things. It is
about these other things that I am here." Thus aggressively he took
the initiative. The Mayor, who had come to question, found that it
was himself was to be questioned; and before the harsh menace of
that voice, the stern contempt of that lean countenance, he grew
instantly submissive. "Before we come to business, Citizen-Mayor,
you had better take a look at my credentials, so that you may know
my authority." He took up a card from the table. It was his
commission as an agent of the Committee of Public Safety. He
proffered it.</p>

<p>The Citizen Foulard came forward almost timidly. He studied the
card a moment, and returned it. "Perfectly, Citizen-Agent.
Perfectly."</p>

<p>"And now we are waiting for your President and your Commandant."
Under the table Andr&eacute;-Louis tapped his booted foot
impatiently. "You do not hurry yourselves in
Bl&eacute;rancourt."</p>

<p>The door opened as he spoke, and the landlord announced:
"Citizen-Emissary, the Citizen-President and the
Citizen-Commandant."</p>

<p>They came in with airs of arrogance. Thuillier, the local
despot, the provincial pro-consul, who was Saint-Just's friend and
agent, was rendered very sure of himself by virtue of his intimate
association with that great man. He came first, a vigorous,
youthful fellow of middle height, with glossy black hair, a swarthy
complexion, and an expression rendered truculent by his heavily
undershot jaw. He was ill-dressed in black, and as President of the
local Revolutionary Committee he was girt with a sash of office. He
was closely followed by Lieutenant Lucas, who commanded the
detachment of National Guards stationed in Bl&eacute;rancourt, and
was nominally styled the Commandant. The Lieutenant was young and
fair, and looked amiable. In his blue uniform with its white
facings and red woollen epaulettes he had almost the air of a
gentleman.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis' eyes played over them. He retained his seat,
and his expression remained forbidding. Weighing the Citizen
Thuillier at a glance, he did not give him time to speak, but
adopted tactics similar to those which had succeeded with the
Mayor.</p>

<p>"You have kept me waiting. In the days of the despots the time
of an official might be wasted with impunity. In these days it is
recognized that his time is not his own to waste. It belongs to the
Nation which employs him."</p>

<p>Like the Mayor before him, Thuillier was visibly shaken.
Formidable must be the authority of a man who permitted himself to
take such a tone with the President of a Revolutionary Committee.
But since Thuillier's self-assurance was better grounded than the
Mayor's, it was not so easily demolished. Recovering, he spoke
arrogantly.</p>

<p>"You do not need to instruct me in my duty, citizen."</p>

<p>"I trust not. But if I perceive the need, I shall not hesitate.
Best look at this, Citizen-President." And again he proffered his
commission.</p>

<p>Thuillier scanned it. He observed that among the signatures it
bore was that of Saint-Just. He was impressed, the more so since he
was vague on the subject of the functions of an agent of the
Committee of Public Safety. He had had to deal before now with one
or two representatives en mission, and was well aware of their wide
powers. An agent of the Committee of Public Safety was something
new in his experience. Aware that it could not be otherwise, since
agents of the committee were never sent upon such missions,
Andr&eacute;-Louis assumed that he would be taken at his own
self-valuation, and that he must depend upon arrogance to establish
by implication that the authority vested in him was unlimited.</p>

<p>"Let the Commandant see it too, so that he may know by what
authority I give him orders should the need to do so arise."</p>

<p>Here was an encroachment. Thuillier frowned. "If you have orders
for the Commandant, he will take them from the Mayor or from
me."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis looked him sternly between the eyes. "As long
as I am in Bl&eacute;rancourt, the National Guard will take its
orders also from the Committee of Public Safety, through me, its
agent. Let that be clear. I am not here to trifle or to argue about
forms. I have business to discharge. Grave business. Let us come to
it. Boissancourt, set chairs for the citizens."</p>

<p>They took the chairs which Boissancourt placed for them beyond
the table, facing Andr&eacute;-Louis, and the three of them looked
at the Citizen-Agent and waited. The Mayor blinked his red-rimmed
eyes in apprehension. Thuillier scowled haughtily. Lucas lounged,
nursing his sabre, his air indifferent.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis sat back and pondered them, his expression
wolfish.</p>

<p>"And so," he said slowly, "it seems that here in this
innocent-looking little country village you permit yourselves to
conspire, you harbour reactionaries, you plot against the Republic
One and Indivisible."</p>

<p>Thuillier attempted to speak. "There has been&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do not interrupt me. I am informed of what there has been. I am
concerned with the business which has led to the arrest of the man
Thorin."</p>

<p>At last full understanding dawned upon Thuillier. This agent had
been sent to Bl&eacute;rancourt by Saint-Just himself so as to
procure&mdash;manufacturing what was necessary&mdash;such evidence
as would suffice to send the betrayed and inconvenient husband of
Madame Thorin to the guillotine. Thuillier perceived his duty
clearly. It was to work hand in hand with this very efficient agent
of the Public Safety. He no longer scowled. He assumed instead a
sympathetic gravity.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes. That is a sad case, citizen. Bl&eacute;rancourt
blushes to think of it."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis' answer was startling. "I should think better
of Bl&eacute;rancourt, and of you, if there were some evidence of a
disposition to cut out this cancer."</p>

<p>"You mean?"</p>

<p>"Come, citizen. Do not trifle with me. Where are the proofs of
this good will, of this patriotic zeal?"</p>

<p>"But have we not arrested this villain Thorin, and sent him to
Paris for trial?"</p>

<p>"For conspiracy," said Andr&eacute;-Louis pregnantly. He waited
a moment. "Come, come! Where are the others? Where are this
scoundrel's associates, his fellow-conspirators? Have you arrested
them yet?"</p>

<p>Thuillier became impatient. "What are you talking about? We do
not know of any others."</p>

<p>"You do not?" Andr&eacute;-Louis raised his brows. Sarcasm was
in his sudden smile. "You wish me to understand perhaps that in
Bl&eacute;rancourt a man may conspire alone? That this is a
peculiarity of the inhabitants of the Aisne?"</p>

<p>The Mayor was penetrated by the acuteness of the
observation.</p>

<p>"Name of a name!" he ejaculated, and turned to Thuillier. "But
of course the fellow must have had associates. A man does not
conspire alone, as the Citizen-Agent says."</p>

<p>"You perceive it? I am glad there is some intelligence in
Bl&eacute;rancourt, even if one must rummage to find it. Well,
Citizen-President, you do not appear to have been very diligent.
You discover that Thorin is conspiring. You arrest him for it, and
you leave the matter there. You do not take the trouble to
ascertain who are his fellow-conspirators. Faith! I think it is
high time the Committee of Public Safety looked into the
matter."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis took up a pencil, and made some notes
rapidly.</p>

<p>The Mayor looked blank stupefaction. Thuillier sat scowling
again, but dumb. He realized that the less he said the better.
Things were not quite as he had supposed at first. He must leave it
for his friend Saint-Just to say what there was to be said to this
pert, meddlesome young agent. He wouldn't meddle much more by the
time Saint-Just had done with him. Lucas maintained an easy
interested air in the proceedings. He, after all, was merely the
instrument of the executive, and there was no responsibility upon
him for any of its blunders or short-comings.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis looked up. Thuillier was to realize that this
pert young meddler had not yet done with him.</p>

<p>"What was the nature of this conspiracy, Citizen-President? Its
precise nature?"</p>

<p>Thuillier shifted ill-humouredly on his chair. "Do you expect me
to carry all the business of my committee in my head?"</p>

<p>"Why, no. Have you had many conspiracies in
Bl&eacute;ranc&oacute;urt?"</p>

<p>"We have had no other."</p>

<p>"Yet you cannot remember the nature of this, the only one? You
betray but a faint interest, I fear. You will have notes, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"I don't know whether I have or not."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis raised his brows, and for a long moment
stared at the President.</p>

<p>"Citizen, let me admonish you to be serious. This man must have
been before your committee for examination."</p>

<p>"He was not. I examined him myself."</p>

<p>"That is very irregular. But even so, you must have made some
notes. A note of the case. You will have that."</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose I have. But how do I know where it is now?"</p>

<p>"You must seek it, Citizen-President. You do not appear even yet
to perceive the gravity of the matter. When we have the details of
the conspiracy we should have some clue to the identity of Thorin's
fellow-conspirators."</p>

<p>"That is true," the Mayor agreed ponderously.</p>

<p>"We shall be able to track down these scoundrels who are still
at large to work their evil against the Republic. You perceive
that, I hope, Citizen-President."</p>

<p>"I perceive it. Yes. I perceive it. Of course I perceive it."
Thuillier was at bay. He showed his teeth. "But a thousand devils!
I tell you I have no notes."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis looked at him long and searchingly, until
Thuillier got to his feet in a rage.</p>

<p>"Why do you stare at me?"</p>

<p>"You have no notes? What am I to understand by this?"</p>

<p>Thuillier, trusting to the protection of his friend Saint-Just,
on whose behalf he had acted, permitted himself to lose his
temper.</p>

<p>"You may understand what the devil you like. I am tired of your
questions. Do you think that I am to be browbeaten by a mouchard.
For that is what you are, I suppose. Do you think&mdash;"</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis interrupted him. "Silence, my man! Silence!
Sainte Guillotine! Do I represent the Committee of Public Safety,
or what do I represent? Am I to have insolences from the President
of a provincial revolutionary committee. Here's a fine state of
things! Do you think I want speeches from you? You'll answer to
what I ask you, and no more. But, indeed, I don't think there is
much more to ask you."</p>

<p>"I am glad of that, at least," said Thuillier with a toss of his
dark head and in an irrepressible flash of insolence. He sat down
again, and crossed his legs, a swift movement eloquent of his
anger.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis looked at him keenly. Then he took up a pen,
dipped it, drew a sheet of paper towards him, and wrote briskly.
For a few moments there was no sound in the room but the scratching
of his quill and the gusty, ill-tempered breathing of the Citizen
Thuillier. At last it was done. The agent cast aside the pen, and
sat back waving the sheet so as to dry the ink. Whilst he waved it,
he spoke, and now not only to Thuillier, but to Foulard as
well.</p>

<p>"The situation, then, is this: a fortnight ago the Citizen
Thorin was arrested by order of the President of the Committee of
Bl&eacute;rancourt on a charge of conspiracy, and sent to Paris to
the Conciergerie, where he remains a prisoner. I am sent here to
discover the nature of the conspiracy and the names of those who
conspired with Thorin. The President can tell me neither the one
nor the other. He informs me in insolent terms that he has no
notes. It is not for me to draw inferences. The Committee of Public
Safety will do that. But it is already clear that only two
inferences are possible. Either the Citizen-President has been
criminally negligent of his duty, or else he is concerned to shield
these other plotters."</p>

<p>"What do you say?" Thuillier was on his feet again.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis went on steadily and relentlessly. "It will
be for the Committee to determine which inference it will adopt.
Meanwhile, my own duty is quite clear. Citizen-Mayor, will you be
good enough to countersign this order?" And he held out towards
Foulard the paper on which he had written.</p>

<p>The Mayor read; Thuillier, his face dark with rage, stared at
him, and from him to Andr&eacute;-Louis.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked at last.</p>

<p>"My God!" said the Mayor at the same moment.</p>

<p>"It is an order for your arrest, of course," said
Andr&eacute;-Louis.</p>

<p>"For my arrest? Arrest me? Me?" The President recoiled. He was
suddenly white under his deep tan.</p>

<p>"You will have perceived the necessity, Citizen-Mayor," said
Andr&eacute;-Louis.</p>

<p>The Citizen-Mayor licked his lips meditatively. His red-rimmed
eyes were narrowed. He took up the pen. Was Andr&eacute;-Louis
deceived, or did a smile flicker over the little man's lips as he
bent to sign? It was not difficult to imagine how such a man as
Thuillier, tyrannically abusing his position as President of the
Revolutionary Committee, must have bullied and humiliated the
Mayor, or what old scores the Mayor was now settling by that
pen-stroke for which the responsibility lay elsewhere.</p>

<p>And then the dumbfounded Thuillier recovered himself at
last.</p>

<p>"Are you mad? Don't sign, Foulard! Don't dare to sign! By God,
man, I'll have your head for this!"</p>

<p>"Ha! Make a note of that threat, Boissancourt. It shall be
reported with the rest. And let me remind you, Citizen Thuillier,
that your own head is none so secure at this moment. You'll best
protect it by a submissive conduct, reserving what else you may
have to say until you come to stand your trial." He took the paper
and turned to the gaping officer. "Here is your order,
Citizen-Commandant. You will lodge the Citizen Thuillier in the
local gaol, and you will hold him there pending my further orders.
You will have him guarded by men of trust and you will see to it
that he holds no communications whatever without an order from me.
He is to send no letters, receive no letters, and he is to be
allowed to see no one at all. You are responsible for this. I warn
you that the responsibility is a heavy one."</p>

<p>"By God it is," said the livid Thuillier. "Some of you will have
to answer for this. Some of you will lose your heads over it."</p>

<p>"Take him away," said Andr&eacute;-Louis.</p>

<p>The Commandant saluted, and, order in hand, turned to
Thuillier.</p>

<p>"Come, Citizen-President."</p>

<p>Thuillier stood there a moment, his jaws working, his lips
moving, but uttering nothing. Then he shook a fist at
Andr&eacute;-Louis. "You wait, my pert jackanapes! You wait! You'll
see what happens to you."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis looked at him with contempt. "I am concerned
to see what happens to you, you traitor. I could foretell it with
reasonable certainty."</p>

<p>He waved him away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX - EVIDENCE</h2>

<p>When the sounds of the protesting, threatening Thuillier's
removal had at last faded, Andr&eacute;-Louis, who had risen,
addressed himself to Foulard.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it, Citizen-Mayor?"</p>

<p>The paunchy little man washed his unclean hands in the air and
wagged his head in grave and sorrowful condemnation.</p>

<p>"I do not like it. I tell you frankly, Citizen-Agent, I do not
like it."</p>

<p>"What don't you like? Be clear, man."</p>

<p>The Mayor jumped. "I don't like the conduct of Thuillier. It is
not frank. It is not the conduct of a patriot."</p>

<p>"Ha! You perceive that too. I was sure from the moment I saw you
that I could count upon your intelligence. Though it isn't
intelligence that is lacking in Bl&eacute;rancourt. It's loyalty,
zeal, patriotism. You conspire here, and the President of your
committee shelters the conspirators."</p>

<p>"You think that? You believe that?"</p>

<p>"Don't you?" boomed Boissancourt.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to think; what to believe."
Andr&eacute;-Louis smiled unpleasantly.</p>

<p>"We must find you something. We may find it among that rascal's
papers. Come, citizen, Show me the way to Thuillier's house. You
will come with us, Boissancourt."</p>

<p>Thuillier had his lodging at the end of the village in a house
that was set back in a tangled, neglected garden, very desolate in
its present December nakedness. It was a ramshackle place kept by
the Widow Grasset and her maiden sister, both women in middle life.
Thuillier occupied two rooms on the ground floor. A brief survey of
the bedroom justified Andr&eacute;-Louis in dismissing it. He
passed to the sitting-room where evidently Thuillier dispatched the
matters concerned with his official position. There were some books
on a shelf. Andr&eacute;-Louis looked them over cursorily; a
'Contrat Social', some volumes of Voltaire's 'Si&ecirc;cle de Louis
XIV', one or two works on philosophy, a translation of Ovid, a copy
of the 'Roman de la Rose', and many others, making up a curious
assortment.</p>

<p>A writing-table stood in the window. There were some papers upon
it. He looked through them. They were of no particular account. He
opened the two drawers set in it. There was nothing in them of the
least consequence.</p>

<p>Then, the Mayor following him ever, and Boissancourt bringing up
the rear, he passed to a mahogany bureau that stood in a recess of
the wall. It was locked.</p>

<p>Having broken it open, Andr&eacute;-Louis sat down to go through
its contents. The Mayor by his invitation pulled up a chair so as
to sit beside him and participate in his investigation.
Boissancourt, standing on his other side, assisted as directed.</p>

<p>The December daylight had long since faded, and they had been
working for three hours by candlelight in that chill, untidy room
before they brought their labours to a close. From that rigorous
sifting had resulted a little bundle of papers, which Boissancourt
tied together. Then the bureau was closed again, and by
Andr&eacute;-Louis' orders the Mayor affixed his seals to it.
Similarly they sealed up the two rooms, informing the startled
Widow Grasset that they were not to be opened save upon an official
order from the Committee of Public Safety or by its accredited
representatives.</p>

<p>Back in his room at the Bonnet Rouge, where meanwhile a fire had
been kindled to thaw the august limbs of the Citizen-Agent,
Andr&eacute;-Louis went more closely over the appropriated
documents with the Mayor, whilst Boissancourt, in his capacity of
secretary, sat making such notes as were required by his
master.</p>

<p>The great prize was a letter from Saint-Just, which Thuillier
had incautiously kept in spite of a note at foot enjoining him
instantly to destroy it. It was a month old, its terms were
deliberately vague and it made no mention of Thorin by name. But
they were not so vague that when read in the light of subsequent
events they left very much doubt as to the charge upon which Thorin
had been arrested.</p>

<blockquote><i>If this Pantaloon,</i> Saint-Just wrote,
<i>continues to squeal as you now report, grave inconvenience may
result to me. Purity of life is so popular at this present that I
have embraced the advocacy of it. That should be enough for you.
You will infer the rest, and understand the inconveniences.
Something must be done. No use to write to me to order things
differently here. Even if I were to do so, this man could still be
mischievous. His silence must be ensured. I leave it to your wits
to discover the way. Take counsel at need with B.S.J. You may both
depend upon my gratitude.</i><br>
<br>

<p><i>Greetings and fraternity,</i><br>
<br>
</p>

<p><i>Your life-long friend, F. Saint-Just.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p>On matters hinted in this letter, Andr&eacute;-Louis proceeded
to an examination of the Mayor.</p>

<p>"Pantaloon in the comedy is always a poor cuckold.. That a
cuckold is in question is confirmed by the next sentence. What
cuckold here in Bl&eacute;rancourt could be inconvenient to the
Representative Saint-Just?"</p>

<p>This was putting a pistol to the Mayor's head. However fearful
Foulard might be, he could not elude it.</p>

<p>"There was Thorin."</p>

<p>"Thorin!" Andr&eacute;-Louis affected astonishment. "Thorin! But
that is the name of this conspirator."</p>

<p>"Just so," said the Mayor.</p>

<p>"The man whose silence must be ensured. Do you know,
Citizen-Mayor, that it begins to look as if there was here a
conspiracy of quite another sort. Thuillier, who discovered it,
cannot tell us what it was about, or who was in it, save this
unfortunate Thorin. What is the truth about Thorin? What is his
story?"</p>

<p>Out it came. It was known in the village that Saint-Just had
seduced Thorin's wife. Since his going to Paris she had
disappeared, and it was rumoured that she had followed him, and
that he kept her there.</p>

<p>Boissancourt wrote briskly, reducing the statement to
writing.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis offered a comment. "A nice story concerning
one who has 'embraced the advocacy of purity, which is now so
popular'." He passed on.</p>

<p>"Then this B.S.J. There are two notes here signed with these
initials. In one B.S.J. suggests that some person or other unnamed
should be placed under arrest. In the other, as if answering a
question, he writes: 'How do I know what you should do with him? In
your place I would send him to Soissons to be guillotined.' That
may allude to the unfortunate Thorin. Who is this B.S.J.? Do you
surmise?"</p>

<p>"It must be Bontemps; a fellow named Bontemps who lives at
Chaume, who calls himself Bontemps Saint-Just."</p>

<p>"Calls himself? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"He is a relative of the Representative Saint-Just. It'll be his
right to call himself that, no doubt. But he's more generally known
as Bontemps."</p>

<p>"What's his station in life?"</p>

<p>"He'll be a horse-leech by trade. But he's farming now. He's
come by a deal of &eacute;migr&eacute; property lately." The Mayor
seemed almost to sneer.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis looked up, sharply alert.</p>

<p>"What do you mean with your come-by? He's bought it, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"I suppose he has. But I never heard tell that he had any
money."</p>

<p>Keener grew the eyes of Andr&eacute;-Louis.</p>

<p>"This is interesting. The fellow has no money. Yet he buys
land."</p>

<p>"Oh, a deal of land, all round La Beauce. A deal of land." The
Citizen-Agent was thoughtfully silent a while.</p>

<p>"It might be as well to have a talk with this Bontemps
Saint-Just," he said at last. "He had better explain these notes."
Then he changed the subject. "To return to Thorin. What do you know
about him?"</p>

<p>"Nothing to his good. A ne'er-do-well, a drunkard, a
wife-beater. Small blame to his wife for going off with the Citizen
Saint-Just. And that's why so little has been heard of it. No one
was sorry when he was laid by the heels."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis was stern. "Whatever he may have been does
not lessen the offence of swearing away his life on a false
charge."</p>

<p>"I am not saying so, Citizen-Agent," quavered the Mayor.</p>

<p>"What relations does he possess?"</p>

<p>"A married sister. She's over in Chaume, too. And there's a
cousin of his in the village here."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Andr&eacute;-Louis stood up. "Let them wait until
tomorrow. It is close upon midnight. You will seek me here in the
morning at nine o'clock, Citizen-Mayor. We shall have a busy day
before us. Boissancourt, put these papers away in safety. Good
night, Citizen-Mayor."</p>

<p>Foulard took his departure, a weary man, glad to escape at last
from the presence of that terrible agent of the Committee of Public
Safety.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis and Boissancourt smiled at each other. "By
God, you're brisk!" said Boissancourt.</p>

<p>"It's in the part of Scaramouche. He succeeds by forestalling.
It was imperative to arrest Thuillier at once so as to prevent him
from communicating with Paris. The rest was the reward of virtue,
and the highest reward of all was to discover the end of this
thread that leads to the Citizen Bontemps. We should find there far
more than ever I hoped or suspected when I came to
Bl&eacute;rancourt."</p>

<p>They did. They rode out to Chaume on the following morning,
accompanied by the Mayor, the Commandant, and six troopers of the
National Guard. Soon after ten they were at the gates of the
diminutive but elegant ch&acirc;teau which was one of the recent
acquisitions of Bontemps and wherein he had taken up his residence.
Its original owner, the Vicomte de La Beauce, had been guillotined
some months ago, and the legitimate heir was somewhere in
exile.</p>

<p>Bontemps himself emerged at the clatter of their arrival in the
courtyard. Dressed like a peasant, he was a young man of thirty,
tall and vigorous, and with a face that was everywhere full save in
the chin. The result was a rather foolish and weakly expression.
But there was no weakness in the terms he used, when the Commandant
announced to him that by order of the Committee of Public Safety he
was under arrest. Having exploded into a succession of vehement
minatory questions, such as whether they had by any chance gone
mad, whether they had counted the cost of what they did, whether
they were aware of his relationship with the Representative
Saint-Just, what they thought the representative would have to say
with them for this egregious error, he came at last to a relevant
demand to know the grounds upon which he was arrested.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis stood truculently before him. He had cocked
his round hat in front and plastered the tricolour cockade upon the
face of it. "The grounds will be fully established by the time we
have gone through your papers."</p>

<p>The chinless countenance of Bontemps changed colour and went
slack. But in a moment he had rallied.</p>

<p>"If you depend on that, it means you have no charge. How can you
arrest me without formulating a charge? You are abusing your
authority, if, indeed, you have any. You are committing an outrage,
for which you shall answer."</p>

<p>"You know too much law for an honest man," said
Andr&eacute;-Louis. "And, anyway, it's out of date. Have you never
heard of the Law of Suspects? We arrest you under that. On
suspicion."</p>

<p>"You won't allay it by violence," said Boissancourt. "Best take
it quietly."</p>

<p>Bontemps appealed to the Mayor. The Mayor answered him in a
paraphrase of the words of Boissancourt, and Bontemps, growing
prudently sullen, was locked in a room with a guard at the door and
another under the window.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis wasted no time in questioning the two men and
the elderly woman who made up the household of Bontemps. He desired
of them no more than an indication of where the Citizen Bontemps
kept his papers. They spent three hours ransacking them, the Mayor
and Boissancourt assisting Andr&eacute;-Louis in his search. When
it was complete, and Andr&eacute;-Louis had found what he sought,
certain notes and one or two letters relating to the purchase of
the La Beauce lands, they dined on the best that the little chateau
could supply them; an omelette, a dish of partridges, a couple of
bottles of the best wine in Bontemps' well-stocked cellar.</p>

<p>"He's just a damned aristocrat it seems, this Bontemps," was all
the thanks Andr&eacute;-Louis bestowed on the household for that
excellent repast.</p>

<p>Then he had the table cleared, and improvised a tribunal in the
pleasant dining-room, which was brightened by the wintry sunshine.
Writing materials were placed on the table. Andr&eacute;-Louis
disposed himself in an armchair before it, with Boissancourt pen in
hand on his right, and the Mayor of Bl&eacute;rancourt on his
left.</p>

<p>Bontemps, pale, ill at ease and sullen, was brought in under
guard. The Commandant lounged in the background, an official
spectator.</p>

<p>The examination began. Bontemps was formally asked his name,
age, condition, place of abode and occupation, and his answers were
set down by Boissancourt. To the last question he replied that he
was a proprietor and farmer.</p>

<p>"How long have you been that?" was the inconvenient
question.</p>

<p>Bontemps hesitated, then answered. "For the last year."</p>

<p>"And before that? What were you?"</p>

<p>"A horse-leech."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis looked at him appraisingly. "I understand
that your patrimony was negligible. You are a young man, Citizen
Bontemps. How long did you practise as a horse-leech?"</p>

<p>"Five or six years."</p>

<p>"Hardly the time in which to amass a fortune. But you were
thrifty, I suppose. You saved money. How much did you save?"</p>

<p>Bontemps shrugged ill-humouredly. "What the devil do I know what
I saved. I keep no accounts."</p>

<p>"On the contrary I have a good many accounts before me here
which you have kept. Don't waste my time, citizen. Answer me. How
much did you save?"</p>

<p>Bontemps became rebellious. "What is your right to question me?
You're a damned spy of the committee's, not a judge. You have no
authority to try me. It may be within your powers to arrest me,
though I doubt even that. And anyway, when the
Citizen-Representative Saint-Just comes to hear of it, you'll have
a bad quarter of an hour, I promise you. Meanwhile, my friend, the
most you can do, the most you dare do is to send me to Paris for
trial. Send me, then. Send me, and be damned to you. For I am
answering none of your questions. Citizen-Mayor, are you going to
abet this fellow? Name of God! You had better go carefully. You had
better be warned. The guillotine goes briskly in Paris. You may
come to acquaintance with it for this outrage. The
Citizen-Representative Saint-Just will require a strict account of
you. That's not a man with whom it's safe to trifle, as you should
know."</p>

<p>He paused, flushed now with the excitement that had welled up in
him whilst he declaimed.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis spoke quietly to Boissancourt. "Set it all
down. Every word of it." He waited until the pretended secretary
had ceased to write, then he turned again to the prisoner. He spoke
for once very quietly without any of the truculence he had hitherto
employed. Perhaps because of the contrast his tone was the more
impressive.</p>

<p>"You labour under an error based on the old forms of law. I have
said that you know too much law, but that it is out of date. If you
are an honest man you will give me every help in deciding whether
you are to be sent for trial or not to Soissons. For that is where
you will be sent. Not to Paris. The guillotine goes just as briskly
in Soissons. As for the Citizen-Representative Saint-Just, upon
whose protection you seem to count, you are not to suppose that
under the present rule of fraternity and equality there is any man
in the State with power to protect a malefactor." His tone hardened
again. "I have said that your notions are out of date. You seem
under the impression that we are still living in the age of the
despots. One other thing. Let me tell you that unless you can
dispel the suspicions to which these papers of yours give rise,
unless you can satisfactorily explain certain unfavourable
circumstances which they suggest, the Citizen-Representative
Saint-Just will be fully occupied in answering for himself." With a
sudden fierceness, he added, bringing his fist down upon the table
as he spoke. "The Republic is no respecter of persons. Get that
into your head, Citizen Bontemps. Liberty, equality, and fraternity
are not idle words."</p>

<p>The Mayor mumbled eager agreement. He went on to urge the
prisoner to answer, and to clear himself.</p>

<p>"I can't perceive," said Andr&eacute;-Louis, "why you should
hesitate, unless it is out of some false sense of loyalty. False,
because no loyalty can save the principal offender. All that you
can accomplish by silence and resistance is to find yourself
convicted as a full accessory."</p>

<p>Bontemps was not merely cowed; he was visibly frightened.
Andr&eacute;-Louis' fierce threat shook his confidence in the
protection which Saint-Just might be able to afford him. If that
protection were removed then was he lost indeed.</p>

<p>"Name of God!" he broke out. "Of what is it that you accuse me?
You have not told me even that. I have done nothing for
myself."</p>

<p>"You described yourself as a proprietor and farmer. I desire to
know the source of the wealth which has enabled you to acquire
these extensive tracts of land in La Beauce."</p>

<p>"I described myself wrongly, then." Fear squeezed the truth from
him. "A farmer, yes. I have become a farmer. It is more lucrative
than being a horse-leech. But a proprietor, no. I am an agent, no
more. What use to question me? You have my papers. They will have
shown you that I am no more than an agent."</p>

<p>"Whose agent?"</p>

<p>Bontemps still hesitated for a moment. He wrung his hands.
Although the air of the room was so cold that their breathing made
a mist upon it, yet there were beads of sweat on his pale, bulging
brow below the straggle of red-brown hair. At last he answered.
"The Citizen-Representative Saint-Just's." As if to excuse the
betrayal wrung from him, he added: "The papers must have shown
it."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis nodded. "They do. At least, they indicate it
very strongly." Again he waited for Boissancourt to finish
writing.</p>

<p>"In the course of the last year, you appear to have received
moneys which will aggregate to close upon half a million francs if
we make the computation reducing all to the present depreciated
values of the Republic's currency."</p>

<p>"If you compute it in that way, I suppose it would amount to
about that figure."</p>

<p>"One particularly heavy remittance of a hundred thousand francs
reached you only a month ago."</p>

<p>"Yes. Just about a month ago."</p>

<p>"On the seventh of Frimaire, to be exact."</p>

<p>"If you have the date, why question me?"</p>

<p>"This money was sent to you from Strasbourg, I think."</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"You know whence the Citizen Saint-Just wrote. For it was he who
sent it to you, was it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It came from him. It came from Strasbourg, I believe. Yes.
Anything else?"</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis sat back. "Set it all down, Boissancourt.
Every word of it. It is important." He turned to the Mayor. "I am
discovering much more than I bargained for; a conspiracy of quite
another sort from that which I came to investigate. At the
beginning of Frimaire the Citizen Saint-Just was in Strasbourg. He
was levying heavy punitive fines there. Gold was flowing into his
hands to be held in trust by him for the National Treasury, money
destined to relieve the sufferings of the faithful people. The
Citizen Saint-Just appears to have misappropriated some of this to
his own uses. That is what emerges from this investigation. You
might add a note to that effect, Boissancourt, for reference later.
And take care of these documents. They supply the evidence." He
paused, considering for a moment. "That, I think, will do for the
moment. I have no more questions. You may remove the prisoner."</p>

<p>Boissancourt finished writing, and presented the minute of the
examination to Andr&eacute;-Louis. He read it carefully, and signed
it. Then he passed it to the Mayor for his countersignature, which
was supplied so soon as the Mayor had also satisfied himself that
the statement was exact. He looked pale and scared when he set down
the pen.</p>

<p>"Name of a name! You have stirred up some terrible matters,
citizen."</p>

<p>"And it's my belief we are only at the beginning of them."</p>

<p>The Mayor shivered. After all, the sunlight had passed from the
room, and it was very cold there. "We are treading very dangerous
ground, citizen."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis stood up. "Very dangerous to malefactors," he
answered with a hardness that reassured the Mayor. "Very dangerous
to false patriots who cheat the Republic of her dues, who abuse
their office to serve private interests. There is no danger to any
other. The Nation will know how to reward those who labour to
destroy corruption. There should be great things in store for you,
Citizen-Mayor. I hope that you deserve your good fortune."</p>

<p>"I have always been a good patriot."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it. Do your duty and fear nothing. Fiat
officium, ruat coelum. Let us be going. You will order the
Commandant to bring along this fellow Bontemps, and to bestow him
safely in the gaol at Bl&eacute;rancourt until we send for
him."</p>

<a name="ch40" id="ch40"></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XL - THE DOSSIER</h2>

<p>In what was still to do at Bl&eacute;rancourt,
Andr&eacute;-Louis employed a feverish diligence. For he never lost
sight of the fact that if a rumour of his activities should reach
Paris there would be an abrupt end to his investigations, and his
head would probably pay the price of his assumptions of authority.
Therefore it was necessary to complete the work with all speed
before discovery overtook him.</p>

<p>Also, as the days passed, the members of the Revolutionary
Committee, whose President he had arrested, began to grow restive.
It may be that these gentlemen were none too easy in their
consciences, and not knowing where these investigations, which
seemed to be spreading in ever-widening circles, could come to an
end, began to be fearful on their own account. They began to
question among themselves the extent of the authority of this agent
of the Committee of Public Safety. Fortunately, the Mayor stood his
friend, and gave him timely warning of these mutterings.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis took instant action. He ordered the committee
to be convened, and appeared before it. The ten members composing
it&mdash;all of them local tradesmen&mdash;rose to receive him when
he briskly entered the room in the Mayor's house where they were
assembled, Foulard, himself, amongst them.</p>

<p>Peremptorily Andr&eacute;-Louis ordered them to sit, and himself
remained standing. The historian in him knew that thus he would
more effectively dominate them. He planted his feet wide, set his
hands behind him, and, hat on head, scowled upon them with those
dark eyes of his which he could render so bitter. Thus for a long,
almost breathless moment in which he seemed to be weighing them.
Then his voice, harsh and arrogant, lashed them without mercy.</p>

<p>"I hear of grumblings amongst you, citizens. It has come to my
knowledge that some of you take the view that I am exceeding my
authority; that you resent the extent to which I am searching into
events that have been happening here in Bl&eacute;rancourt. Let me
give you a timely word of warning. If you have a care for your
heads, you will heed it. If you had a proper sense of duty to the
Republic, a proper patriotism, you would welcome researches whose
aim is to uproot that which is noxious to the common welfare; you
would welcome all steps, even though they should transcend the
bounds of my authority, which are calculated to serve that aim. But
let me tell you that far from exceeding my authority I have not yet
exerted it to the full. An agent of the Committee of Public Safety
is vested with the powers of the Committee itself, and responsible
only to the Committee for his actions. If you desire to test my
powers to the full, continue to question them. I may then extend my
investigations into the affairs of the questioners. For it will be
my duty to assume that who resents my inquisitions has in his own
conduct cause to fear them." He paused to let that inference sink
home. They sat silent and a little abashed, looking furtively at
one another.</p>

<p>He resumed with an increase of asperity. "If I do not instantly
proceed to discover who are the grumblers, and to look into their
affairs, it is because my hands are full already. I am content at
present to confine myself to the task entrusted to me by the
Committee, and to such matters as may arise directly out of it. But
at the first sign of any obstacle placed in my way, of any hostile
criticism of my actions which might have the result of creating
difficulties for me, I shall pursue my critic without mercy or
scruple. I will show you, citizens, if you give me reason to think
it necessary, that the cause of liberty is not to be denied or
impeded. I will show you this, if I have to take off some of your
heads to make it clear. There's nothing like blood to wash away
mutiny. And mutinous heads are best bestowed in the executioner's
basket. Bear that in mind, citizens, and do not give me cause to
speak to you again, or it will be in a very different tone."</p>

<p>He paused again. He saw in their hang-dog looks that he had
cowed them.</p>

<p>"If any of you has anything to say to me, let him take this
opportunity. If any of you has any complaint to voice, let him do
so fearlessly and frankly now."</p>

<p>A lantern-jawed fellow named Prieur, a grocer in the village,
who in these rhetorical days had developed certain gifts of rustic
oratory, shambled to his feet. He rose to reassure the
Citizen-Agent that here all were loyal servants of the Committee of
Public Safety; that far from placing any obstacles in his path or
criticizing the measures which in his wisdom he thought fit to take
on the Committee's behalf, their anxiety was to afford him every
facility for the full performance of his duty. He went on to assure
the Citizen-Agent that no man present had any ground upon which to
fear the closest investigation of his actions. Whatever he might
have added further was never uttered, for there Andr&eacute;-Louis
rudely interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Do you make yourself the sponsor of your colleagues? How can
you do that? Speak to your own affairs, my friend, if you want me
to attach credit to your words."</p>

<p>Abashed, Prieur could only repeat in faltering accents his
opening assurances. When he sat down another rose to say precisely
the same thing, and after him a third, whom Andr&eacute;-Louis
refused to hear.</p>

<p>"Am I to listen to each of you in turn assuring me of your
loyalty? I have not the time to waste. And what are words? Let
rather your actions afford me evidence of your civic virtues."</p>

<p>Upon that he wished them a good day, and abruptly left them.</p>

<p>They gave him no more trouble. On the contrary, after that
interview, each member of the Revolutionary Committee vied with his
colleagues to display a helpful zeal.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Andr&eacute;-Louis made all haste to complete the
evidence of the formidable case he was preparing. At the end of a
week he was in a position to take the final step.</p>

<p>Again he ordered the Mayor to convene the Revolutionary
Committee. He constituted it into a court of inquiry, and elected
to preside over it himself. He commanded that Thuillier and
Bontemps should be brought before it.</p>

<p>Before admitting either, however, he had a statement to make and
a question to ask.</p>

<p>"You have been brought here to examine the apparently anti-civic
conduct of two citizens of the district, one of whom, Thuillier, is
your own President. The aim of your inquiry is to determine whether
they are to be sent for trial, or whether, their conduct
satisfactorily explained, they may be restored to liberty.</p>

<p>"The Citizen Thuillier ordered the arrest here a month or so ago
of a man named Thorin whom he charged with conspiracy. Thuillier
himself signed the order for this man's arrest, and it was
countersigned of necessity by one of you. The Citizen-Commandant
Lucas does not at this date remember by whom the order was
countersigned. I shall be glad if he who countersigned it will now
disclose himself."</p>

<p>There was a pause. Andr&eacute;-Louis did not permit it to be
unduly protracted.</p>

<p>"I can, of course, send to Paris for the order itself, and thus
ascertain. But it will save time and trouble, and it may also avoid
suspicion attaching to him, if the member in question will frankly
declare himself."</p>

<p>Prieur cleared his throat, and leaned forward in his place at
that long table. "I believe I countersigned that order."</p>

<p>"You believe?"</p>

<p>"I countersigned so many that I hesitate to be more precise. But
I am almost sure of the order for Thorin's arrest."</p>

<p>"You are almost sure? Stand up, citizen. Come now. You must be
quite sure. Thuillier must have said something to impress it upon
your memory. He must have urged some good reason for this step.
That is what I desire to know."</p>

<p>"Ah yes. I remember now." The Adam's apple in Prieur's stringy
throat rose and fell as he swallowed hard. His knuckly hand moved
nervously on the green baize cloth that covered the table against
which he leaned. "I remember. Yes, of course. Thuillier told me
that Thorin had been guilty of conspiring against the
Republic."</p>

<p>"Was that all he told you? Surely he must have satisfied you
that this was true before you signed away a man's life? Come,
citizen. You have nothing to fear if only you will be frank with
the committee. It will, I know, be clear that you have been
victimized. Thuillier was your President. It was natural that you
should repose confidence in his word. But there must have been
something more than his word."</p>

<p>"He told me that he acted upon orders from Paris?"</p>

<p>"Paris could know nothing of a conspiracy in Bl&eacute;rancourt
save upon information from Bl&eacute;rancourt. You see that,
Citizen Prieur?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes. I see that. I see that now. Now that you mention
it."</p>

<p>"But you did not see it at the time?"</p>

<p>"I trusted the Citizen-President."</p>

<p>"That is what I have been supposing." Andr&eacute;-Louis for
once was amiable. "But he must have said whose were the orders he
had received from Paris?"</p>

<p>Prieur looked desperately round him. He found all eyes turned
upon him, and all were grave. Some seemed to condemn him. He
swallowed again, and at last decided to answer.</p>

<p>"He told me that the orders were from the Citizen-Representative
Saint-Just."</p>

<p>There was a lively stir, and some murmurings at the mention of
that formidable name. Boissancourt, at the table's end, wrote down
the answer.</p>

<p>"Did he tell you anything of the nature of the conspiracy?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, Citizen-Agent. I asked, naturally. He answered that it
was none of my business."</p>

<p>"It did not occur to you that it was very much your business?
That if there was a conspiracy here, there must be other
conspirators, and that the arrests could not be confined to this
Thorin? This did not occur to you, Citizen Prieur?"</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis had resumed his Rhadamanthine manner.
Prieur's uneasiness increased.</p>

<p>"It may have passed through my mind. But the Citizen-President
was insistent, and...and..."</p>

<p>"He coerced you, you would say?"</p>

<p>Prieur nodded slowly. "It comes to that, I suppose."
Andr&eacute;-Louis looked at him in silence. Then abruptly he
shifted his ground.</p>

<p>"Let us pass on. The order was from the Citizen-Representative
Saint-Just. Tell me, citizen, had you ever before heard the name of
this man Thorin connected in any way with that of Saint-Just?"</p>

<p>"I had heard what everybody in Bl&eacute;rancourt has heard.
Thorin made no secret of his trouble. He accused Saint-Just of
having seduced his wife, of having taken her to Paris, where it is
said that he keeps her now. Anyone in Blerancourt will tell you
this."</p>

<p>"Ah! It explains a note from Saint-Just found among the papers
of Thuillier. Yes, I think it explains it completely. You have
that, Boissancourt?" He paused. He was smiling a little. "It is
practically established that there has, indeed, been a conspiracy
with which Thorin is connected. But he seems to be connected with
it rather as the victim. You may sit down, Citizen Prieur.
Citizen-Commandant, order Thuillier to be brought before us."</p>

<p>Prieur sank down limply into his seat. His colleagues surveyed
him between censure and compassion.</p>

<p>Thuillier was brought in between guards. He walked firmly, his
head high, his glance arrogant, his jaw more prominent than
ever.</p>

<p>He broke into menaces, uttered with a deal of foulness, as to
what would happen to them all when his friends in Paris came to
know of this. Andr&eacute;-Louis let him run on. Then with a
crooked smile he turned to the committee.</p>

<p>"You hear his assurances, his confidence in his friends in
Paris&mdash;by which he means his friend in Paris. This unhappy
Thuillier is under the delusion that the rule of tyranny still
prevails in France; that there has merely been a change of tyrants.
He and his friend in Paris are likely very soon to discover their
error." To the prisoner he added: "My secretary, there, is setting
down every word you utter. So you had better weigh your words
carefully, because the Committee of Public Safety will certainly
weigh them. In fact, if you will accept a piece of friendly advice,
you will be silent. You have been brought here not to speak, but to
listen."</p>

<p>Thuillier glowered at him, but prudently accepted his
advice.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis was brief. "There is no need to question you.
The case is complete. It is established&mdash;very fully
established&mdash;by the documents found in your possession, which
I have here, and by the evidence of a member of this committee,
that you arrested Thorin and sent him to Paris upon orders from the
Citizen Saint-Just. That the charge of conspiracy upon which he was
arrested was entirely false is also established by the utter lack
of evidence of any conspiracy at all, and by the fact that no other
arrest has been made on this ground. As I pointed out to you
before, a man cannot conspire alone. Seeking further, we find in
these sworn statements of Thorin's sister and Thorin's cousin, that
the Representative Saint-Just carried off the wife of this Thorin
and has kept her under his protection in Paris. All the village can
testify that Thorin was raging and complaining in a manner likely
to bring the Representative Saint-Just into deserved disrepute. The
Citizen Saint-Just's despotic act in having this man thrown into
prison is at once explained.</p>

<p>"The Representative Saint-Just will have to answer for himself
when I lay my report before the Committee of Public Safety. You
will have to answer for having been his accomplice in this
abhorrent act of tyranny, in this loathsome abuse of trust. If you
have anything to say that will mitigate your part, this is your
opportunity."</p>

<p>"I have nothing to say." Thuillier grimaced in his rage. "These
are all rash assumptions, for which your head may have to pay. You
are meddling in dangerous matters, citizen, as you will discover.
So are you all, you imbeciles! Do this man's bidding like a pack of
silly sheep, and like a pack of silly sheep you'll come to the
shambles for it."</p>

<p>"Take him out," Andr&eacute;-Louis commanded. "Take him back to
gaol, and let him lie there until orders concerning him come from
Paris."</p>

<p>Thuillier, swearing and threatening to the end, was dragged out
by his guards.</p>

<p>Next Bontemps was introduced. Andr&eacute;-Louis made even
shorter work of him. It was established that in the course of the
last year he had acquired lands in La Beauce to the value of close
upon a half million francs. It was also established by documents
found in his possession that in this he had merely acted as the
agent for the Citizen-Representative Saint-Just, who had supplied
him the money for these enormous purchases. The lands in question
had thus become the property of Saint-Just. They were registered in
the name of Bontemps merely so that Saint-Just's dishonest
acquisitions should not be disclosed.</p>

<p>Bontemps admitted it.</p>

<p>Summaries of his case and of that of Thuillier having been drawn
up by Boissancourt, Andr&eacute;-Louis required the signatures to
them of every member of the present committee.</p>

<p>That completed the formidable dossier, with which at last
Andr&eacute;-Louis departed from Bl&eacute;rancourt, leaving behind
him a little township shaken to its foundations by his passage.
Armed with the dossier he counted upon shaking Paris as
effectively.</p>

<hr align="center" width="50%">
<a name="ch41" id="ch41"></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XLI - THE THUNDERBOLT</h2>

<p>It was in mid-Niv&ocirc;se&mdash;which is to say, in the early
days of the New Year&mdash;when Andr&eacute;-Louis reappeared in
Paris.</p>

<p>His return was opportune, and the hour fully ripe for that which
he came back to do.</p>

<p>The contest between the parties of anarchy and moderation, the
bitter struggle between the foul H&eacute;bert and the Titanic
Danton touched its end. Feeling himself crushed under the weight of
Danton's oratory which held him up to derision as an imbecile who
succeeded only in making the revolution an object of hatred and
ridicule, H&eacute;bert in his madness attempted to head an
insurrection.</p>

<p>That was the end of him.</p>

<p>Beholding him stagger and desiring to speed his end, Robespierre
roused himself from the inert vigilance in which hitherto he had
observed the combat of his two rivals. Foreseeing his own trial of
strength with the survivor, which must follow, he loosed now his
valiant henchman Saint-Just against H&eacute;bert. This terrible
young man, with the golden head and the liquid eyes through which
his sadic soul looked out compassionately upon the world, delivered
the death-blow in a speech of burning impassioned eloquence in
which purity and virtue were flaunted like banners in the wind.</p>

<p>H&eacute;bert and those associated with him were arrested for
conspiracy to the State. Their doom was sealed.</p>

<p>And so, at last, the lists were cleared for the final struggle
for supremacy. Already Dantonists and Robespierrists were buckling
their harness. If Danton prevailed it was, as we know, the view of
de Batz that he might be wont to play in France the part that Monk
had played in England, and lend his influence to the restoration of
the throne. But if the fall of Robespierre could be brought about
in such a way as to cover his party with infamy, in such a way as
to make clear to the famished people that they had been deluded by
a gang of corrupt self-seeking scoundrels, whose doctrines of
equality and fraternity had been so much hypocrisy employed to
magnify themselves, then the hopes of de Batz would be changed to
certainty. The end of the revolution and the revolutionaries would
be assured.</p>

<p>You conceive, therefore, how breathless was his greeting of
Andr&eacute;-Louis on his return from Bl&eacute;rancourt, how eager
his demands for news of how the adventure there had sped, what
fruits it had borne.</p>

<p>There exists among the papers of Andr&eacute;-Louis Moreau the
draft of an article which he had prepared for the Vieux Cordelier.
This draft he now laid before de Batz. Here are the terms of
it:</p>

<blockquote>Citizens: If chaos is upon the face of the land and
starvation in your midst, it is because the despotism from which
you hoped to deliver France when you gave her a constitution, has
had no other result than to substitute one set of tyrants for
another. The fault does not lie in the constitution. Properly
administered it would have borne all the rich fruits expected of
it. But the constitution has not been properly administered. The
government has been in the hands of self-seeking scoundrels,
corrupt and hypocritical, whose only object has been to serve their
own interests, abuse their sacred trust, and enrich themselves at
the price of your own starvation. When it became necessary for the
party of the Mountain to which Fran&ccedil;ois Chabot belonged, for
the Robespierrists amongst whom he was regarded as a leader, to
exculpate themselves from the stain which his villainy had cast
upon them all, there was none more eloquent in expressing
abhorrence of that man's misdeeds than the Representative Florelle
de Saint-Just. It was Saint-Just more than any other who, by his
denunciations of Chabot and his fellow-conspirators against the
public welfare, calmed your just wrath and restored your shaken
faith in the National Convention. Saint-Just convinced you that
with the removal of those scoundrels the work of purification was
complete; and he promised you under a purer government a speedy end
to the misery which he cajoled you into continuing out of
patriotism to endure. You listened to him where you might not have
listened to another, because he had known how to persuade you that
he was the soul of truth and the mirror of purity in his private as
in his public life. In your eyes Saint-Just affected the austerity
of Scipio. In the Convention, when questions of public morals are
to be debated, Saint-Just is ever given the lead out of regard for
his virtues even more than for his talents.<br>
<br>

<p>It is my task, citizens, to pluck the mask from this
arch-hypocrite, this fidus Achates of the Incorruptible
Robespierre. I accuse this public idol, this false Republican, this
ci-devant Chevalier de Saint-Just, of a corruption infinitely
deeper, of abuses infinitely more scandalous than any of those for
which he denounced Chabot and Chabot's colleagues in rascality.<br>
<br></p>

<p>I hold proofs, complete and overwhelming, that this wolf in
sheep's wool, this aristocrat in a tricolour cockade, this
ci-devant Chevalier de Saint-Just, is true to the worst form of the
aristocratic stock from which he springs.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Under the old regime, no privilege was more terrible, no power
more odious than that by which an innocent but inconvenient man
might be flung into prison under a letter of cachet, and left to
rot there without trial, forgotten, blotted out, dead whilst still
alive. This abomination the Chevalier de Saint-Just has dared to
revive for his own inexpressibly vile purposes. Of this abuse of a
power entrusted to him in the name of Liberty and of the service of
humanity, the ci-devant Chevalier de Saint-Just is guilty. On a
false charge he has caused the arrest and imprisonment of a man who
was inconvenient to him, a man whom he feared because it was in
that man's power and it was that man's right to denounce the
debauchery of this Apostle of morality, this austere professor of
all the Virtues.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here follows in detail the story of Thorin, an account of
Saint-Just's secret relations with Thorin's wife, and an insistence
upon the circumstance that Saint-Just is betrothed in marriage to
the sister of the Representative Lebas.</p>

<p>Then comes the story of the plundered half-million, and of the
broad acres at La Beauce acquired by Saint-Just in the name of his
agent and relative Bontemps, a subterfuge which must have left his
misappropriations undetected but for an accidental discovery at
Bl&eacute;rancourt made in the course of investigating the case of
the Citizen Thorin.</p>

<p>The article closes with a brief peroration in which the
sufferings of the people are subtly stressed, the corruption which
has caused it is bitterly denounced, and the head of this corrupt
hypocrite is demanded.</p>

<p>De Batz read that note to the end with quickened pulses and a
flush upon his sallow face. His eyes were gleaming when he looked
up into Andr&eacute;-Louis'.</p>

<p>"And the proofs of this? The proofs?" he asked half-fearfully,
from sheer incredulity.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis displayed a roll of documents bound with
tape.</p>

<p>"They are all here. For every word in that note there is more
than proof. Depositions of Thorin's sister and his cousin,
concerning the relations between Thorin's wife and Saint-Just.
Notes of proceedings, and admissions of Thuillier and of Bontemps
all duly attested. Documents found among the papers of Thuillier,
particularly a letter in Saint-Just's hand instructing him in the
matter of Thorin's arrest and suppression. Documents found among
the papers of Bontemps, corroborating his attested admissions that
he had purchased in his own name land to the value of half a
million francs for Saint-Just. All are here. Nor is that the end of
the evidence. Thorin's cousin and sister may be brought from
Bl&eacute;rancourt to testify. Thorin himself will have to be
produced and heard. Thuillier and Bontemps are in gaol at
Bl&eacute;rancourt whence they will have to be brought before the
Convention to give evidence. It is complete. The avalanche must
follow upon publication."</p>

<p>De Batz trembled with agitation. "My God! My God! This more than
compensates for the fall of Toulon. No royalist victory there could
have been worth as much as this. It's a miracle. We have them. The
Chabot business scarcely cold, and now this! It's not merely the
end of the Robespierrists, it's the end of the revolution. This
thunderbolt when it falls will shatter the convention. It could not
come more seasonably. The people are at the end of their endurance.
Do you imagine that they will consent to continue to starve to keep
these rascals in power? By God, I'll get my men to work as they
have never worked before. If we can't drive Paris into a frenzy
over this, then I'm a fool."</p>

<p>He set a hand on Andr&eacute;-Louis' shoulder and smiled into
his eyes. "You have done well, my kingmaker. It was your dream from
the outset that day at Hamm. It is your hand and your wits that
have made the dream a reality that have forged this thunderbolt.
And yours, Andr&eacute;, shall be the credit. If there is any
gratitude at all in princes rich shall be your reward."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Andr&eacute;-Louis with a wistful smile. "Rich it
shall be, for it brings me all the riches that I covet. It brings
me Aline. Aline, at last, at long last."</p>

<p>De Batz laughed like a boy as he clapped him on the shoulder.
"My dear Romantic!" he ejaculated.</p>

<p>"It moves your mockery, eh, Jean?"</p>

<p>"My mockery? No. My wonder." He grew sober. "Perhaps my envy.
Who knows? If ever I had possessed such an inspiration to high
endeavour I might have accounted, as you do, all other ambitions
mean. I can understand it if I have never experienced it. God bring
you to your heart's desire, mon petit. You have earned it, and one
day soon the King of France shall thank you." He took up the bundle
of documents which Andr&eacute;-Louis had cast upon the table.
"Bestow these in safety until Desmoulins comes to look them over in
the morning. I'll send him word by Tissot."</p>

<p>There was a cabinet in a corner of the room, a rococo piece of
the time of the fifteenth Louis, veneered in mahogany with Arcadian
landscapes painted in its panels. Inside, one half of the back was
secretly contrived to slide across the other half, disclosing a
recess in the wall, where de Batz concealed all compromising
papers. Of this cabinet each of them possessed a key, and it was in
the recess behind it that Andr&eacute;-Louis now bestowed those
precious documents.</p>

<p>That done, he left the house to go and pay a visit to the
Chevalier de Pomelles, at Bourg-Egalit&eacute;, not as de Batz
supposed with the object of informing him of his success at
Bl&eacute;rancourt, but because of his consuming anxiety for direct
news of Mademoiselle de Kercadiou. Surely by now some messenger
would have arrived in Paris bearing the answer which he had begged
to his last letter.</p>

<p>De Batz let him go. He might even have accompanied him if it had
not been that the immediate consequences of Andr&eacute;-Louis'
return were to make him very busy. There was much to do to prepare
his agents for the inflammatory campaign that would lie before them
in the course of the next few days, as soon as they should have
flung their bombshell; and de Batz would not waste a moment, now
that he had something definite upon which to go to work.</p>

<p>He was still busy when Andr&eacute;-Louis returned after
nightfall. Yet absorbed as he was in the task to which he had set
his wits and his hands, he did not on that account fail to observe
the dejection in the young man's countenance. The earlier eagerness
seemed all to have departed out of him; of the exhilaration
begotten of his success there was no sign remaining.</p>

<p>At first de Batz misread these signs. "You are overtired,
Andr&eacute;. You should have left Pomelles until to-morrow."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis flung off his cloak, and stepped to the
blazing fire. He stood with his hand upon the overmantel, leaning
his forehead on his arm.</p>

<p>"I am not tired, Jean. I am disheartened. I came back in such
confidence that by now at last there would be this sorely-awaited
letter. And there is nothing."</p>

<p>"So that was why you were in such haste to seek Pomelles?"</p>

<p>"It passes all understanding. Two couriers have come from Hamm
since Lang&eacute;ac arrived there with my letter. Yet there is no
word from her." He wheeled to face de Batz. "My God! Do you know
that it is almost more than I can bear. It is close upon a year
since we parted, and in all this time, whilst I have written letter
after letter, I never received a single line. I have been patient,
and I have kept my wits on what there was to do. But behind it all
there has ever been an ache, a yearning." He broke off with an
impatient gesture. "Oh, talking will not help."</p>

<p>De Batz desired to comfort him.</p>

<p>"My dear Andr&eacute;, consider that this silence probably
results from a fear that if a letter were to miscarry it might
betray you."</p>

<p>"I did consider it. That is why in my last I begged definitely,
insistently, for be it no more than two lines over her initials. It
is not like Aline to ignore such a request."</p>

<p>"Yet the explanation may be a simple one. And meanwhile you have
been assured by almost every messenger arriving from Hamm that
Mademoiselle de Kercadiou is well. Lang&eacute;ac had seen her just
before he last came to Paris, a couple of months ago. That should
reassure you."</p>

<p>"It does not. It makes it all the more odd." He turned again,
and once more leaned his forehead on his arm.</p>

<p>The Baron rose and went to set an arm affectionately about his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Come, child, you are tired, and when we are tired we are
pessimists. We fear the unimaginable at every turn. You know, I
repeat, that she is well. Let that content you for the little while
that now remains. Soon, very soon, you will have the happiness of
seeing not her pothooks but herself. You will hear your praises
from her lips. God, child, I envy you the joy to come. Dwell on
that. The rest is naught."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis straightened himself. He tried to smile. But
the effort did not quite succeed. "Thanks, Jean. You are a good
fellow. But there's an evil premonition upon me. It's born perhaps
of the sickness that comes of hope deferred."</p>

<p>"Premonition? Bah! Leave premonitions to old wives, and let's to
supper. I've a couple of bottles of a Gascony wine that's as big a
braggart as I am. It will paint the future a bright rose for
you."</p>

<p>But proof was fast approaching that this evil premonition was
anything but idle, that this dejection in the hour of triumph was
justified by facts. The bearer of it was the Marquis de La Guiche,
who had reached Paris that same evening.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLII - PRINCELY GRATITUDE</h2>

<p>De la Guiche arrived at the Rue-de-M&eacute;nars at nine o'clock
on the following morning, whilst de Batz and Andr&eacute;-Louis,
having broken their fast, still sat at table discussing the
immediate measures to be taken. A message had been dispatched to
Camille Desmoulins begging him to come at once, so that
Andr&eacute;-Louis might acquaint him with the famous note which he
had prepared, and determine with him, and perhaps with Danton as
well, what form of publication it should be given; whether it
should appear as an article in the Vieux Cordelier, or form the
basis of a denunciation to be launched from the tribune of the
Convention.</p>

<p>The unexpected arrival of La Guiche took them by surprise, and
created a momentary diversion of their thoughts from this
all-engrossing topic. De Batz sprang forward to embrace this oldest
of his associates, who latterly and for so long had been absent
from his side, serving the cause of the monarchy in other
regions.</p>

<p>"La Guiche! Wherever you spring from, you could not be more
opportune. You come in the very nick of time to lend a hand in the
triumph of our long endeavours. What good angel sent you?"</p>

<p>The warmth of the welcome momentarily broke La Guiche's
solemnity. A thin smile crossed the white hawk-face, but was gone
almost as soon as it appeared.</p>

<p>"I see that you haven't heard," he said.</p>

<p>The gravity of his countenance, the dejection in his eyes, gave
pause to both of them.</p>

<p>"Heard what?" asked de Batz.</p>

<p>"Pomelles was arrested late last night by order of the Committee
of Public Safety. His papers have been seized. If I had arrived in
Paris an hour earlier I might have been taken with him, for my
first visit was to Bourg-Egalit&eacute; to report events abroad. I
am from Brussels."</p>

<p>He loosened and removed his cloak, and bestowed it on a chair
together with his conical hat which was adorned by a tricolour
cockade. He stood forth, tall, slim, and elegant in a wine-coloured
frock, buckskins and boots, his lustrous bronze hair tied in a
ribbon of black silk.</p>

<p>De Batz stood before him momentarily dismayed and shaken. He was
thinking quickly, anxiously watched by both his companions. Then,
characteristically, he shrugged.</p>

<p>"Bad luck for Pomelles. It's the fortune of war. Who embarks on
these enterprises must be prepared to leave his head in them. I
always have been, God knows. But I've moved more carefully than old
Pomelles. I often warned him that he did not take enough
precautions. His continued immunity was increasing his
carelessness, and now..." He shrugged again and spread his hands.
"Poor devil!"</p>

<p>"The fact is," said La Guiche grimly, "nothing prospers with us.
Toulon has fallen."</p>

<p>"That is stale news. We have known it for over three weeks, and
we've grown reconciled. If Toulon has fallen, the royalist rising
in the Vendee has gathered impetus. The loss in one place has been
more than counterbalanced in the other."</p>

<p>But La Guiche was not disposed to optimism. "If I am a judge at
all, the stand in the Vendee will end like that of Toulon and every
other stand that has been made for the House of Bourbon."</p>

<p>"There's no reason for that fear," cut in Andr&eacute;-Louis.
"And anyway there's a stand to be made here in Paris that can
hardly fail." Briefly he sketched the situation for La Guiche.</p>

<p>The newcomer's countenance brightened a little as he listened.
"Faith! That's the first really good news I've heard in weeks. The
first ray of light in all this gloom."</p>

<p>He pulled up a chair and sat down by the fire, spreading one of
his fine hands to the blaze. The January morning was sharp. There
had been a frost in the night, and the sun had not yet dispelled
the chill mists that hung upon the city.</p>

<p>"There is nothing among Pomelles' papers, I suppose, that would
incriminate you?"</p>

<p>De Batz shook his head. "Nothing. Pomelles was d'Entragues' man.
I work independently. I should never have kept my head so long, had
it been otherwise."</p>

<p>"Can you do nothing for this poor devil, Jean? He is an old
friend of mine, and he's done stout service. I would gladly take a
risk for him."</p>

<p>"Perhaps. It is possible that I could buy him off. I've bought
off so many. But nearly all the Conventionals who worked with me
are awaiting the guillotine at this moment. Still there's
Lavicomterie, and there's L'Huillier, who is on the Committee of
Public Safety. I'll see them at the Tuileries to-day, and try to
enlist their help."</p>

<p>He sat down. Andr&eacute;-Louis followed his example, speaking
as he drew out a chair from the table. "It's bad luck. A few more
days and there would have been no more question of arresting him.
Yes. It's bad luck."</p>

<p>"Bad luck, as you say," the Marquis agreed from where he sat
facing the other two. "But we have the luck that we deserve. Which
is to say, not luck at all, but the natural effect of the causes
that we provide." He spoke with a singular bitterness that provoked
from de Batz a sharp denial.</p>

<p>"Ah, that no. I'll not suffer you to say it. Fate has fooled us
rather mischievously at moments. But our endeavours have deserved
well."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am not speaking of you and your loyal band here in Paris.
I am thinking of that fat fool in Hamm."</p>

<p>"My God, La Guiche! You are speaking of the Regent."</p>

<p>"Who may one day be King. I am well aware of it."</p>

<p>De Batz frowned, between annoyance and perplexity. "You haven't
turned sansculotte by any chance?"</p>

<p>"I've been tempted to do so ever since the fall of Toulon."
Andr&eacute;-Louis shared the Baron's impatience.</p>

<p>"Toulon! Toulon! You have it on the brain. Do you deny that we
were ill served by fortune there?"</p>

<p>"I do. We were ill served by the Comte de Provence. I place the
responsibility for that defeat upon him."</p>

<p>"Upon him? Oh, this is madness!"</p>

<p>La Guiche curled his lip. "Madness, is it? Do you know the
facts? Do you know that for months the defenders of Toulon
clamoured for the presence of the Prince. They desired him at their
head. Message after message was sent to him by Maudet, urging him,
beseeching him to come; representing to him how his presence would
stimulate those who had raised the royal standard for him."</p>

<p>"But he went in the end," said Andr&eacute;-Louis.</p>

<p>"He set out to go. When it was too late. Even then I believe
that he set out only because I shamed him into it. He started for
Toulon at the very moment when, weary of resistance, the royalists
were about to own defeat. Discouraged by the indifference to their
heroism and sufferings shown by the continual absence of the head
of the house on whose behalf they sacrificed themselves, their will
to conquer had gradually left them."</p>

<p>Still de Batz loyally defended his Prince. "It may not have been
possible for him to leave Hamm before. How can you judge?"</p>

<p>"Because it happens that I know. A woman kept the Regent in
Hamm. The pursuit of a banal amour was of more consequence to that
sluggish imbecile than his duty or all the blood that was being
shed for him."</p>

<p>"Are you mad, La Guiche!"</p>

<p>La Guiche smiled weary contempt. "Not now. I was almost mad when
I made the discovery. But I have since come to realize that the
cause is greater than the man; that the cause is all; the man
nothing. Because of this I have but one regret. That I did not
pistol him when I found out what kept him from his sacred duty. It
was neither more nor less than dishonouring rumour proclaimed it.
Whilst that loyal band was bleeding to death for him in Toulon, he
was retained in Hamm by nothing more than the soft embraces of
Mademoiselle de Kercadiou. With her he consoled himself for the
faithlessness of Madame de Balbi, of whom it is reported in
Brussels that she has taken a Russian lover."</p>

<p>With a last angry shrug the Marquis slewed round in his chair to
face the fire, and again held out his hands to the blaze.</p>

<p>In the room behind him the silence was unnatural. The other two
seemed scarcely to draw breath. For some moments the only sound was
the soft ticking of the S&eacute;vres clock on the overmantel,
marking the hour of half-past nine. De Batz felt as if a hand had
suddenly clutched his heart. He sat rigidly, staring straight
before him, afraid to turn his head lest he should see the face of
Andr&eacute;-Louis, who sat just out of arm's length on his
right.</p>

<p>As for Andr&eacute;-Louis, he had jerked himself bolt upright at
the mention of Aline's name. He sat now, as if carved of wood or
marble, his face, indeed, of a marble pallor.</p>

<p>Thus for half a dozen heart-beats. Then the Marquis, growing
conscious of that uncanny stillness, turned, and, puzzled, looked
from one to the other of them.</p>

<p>"What the devil ails you?"</p>

<p>The question dissolved the bonds that had pinioned
Andr&eacute;-Louis. He rose, and stood very straight and stiff. He
spoke slowly, his tone cold and incisive.</p>

<p>"An evil tongue is the flag of a cruel heart. I have listened to
you in growing disbelief, Monsieur le Marquis. The last foul lie
you uttered proves the worthlessness of all the rest."</p>

<p>And now both La Guiche and de Batz were on their feet as well,
the Baron nervous for once in his life. La Guiche curbed his quick
temper by an effort.</p>

<p>"Moreau, you must be out of your senses. These are not terms
that I will suffer any man to employ towards me."</p>

<p>"I am aware of it. You have a remedy."</p>

<p>De Batz thrust himself forward, so that he could stop the rush
of either of them.</p>

<p>"What's this? What's this? Mordiou! This is no time for private
quarrels amongst ourselves. We have a cause to serve..."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis interrupted him. "I have other things to
serve as well, Jean. There is something that I set even above the
cause. The honour of Mademoiselle de Kercadiou, which this liar has
besmirched."</p>

<p>La Guiche took a step forward.</p>

<p>"Ah that, Parbleu! There may be a revolution in France. But not
all the revolutions in the world&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quiet, in the name of God!" The Baron's grip was upon the arm
of the Marquis. "Listen a moment, both of you. Listen, I say! La
Guiche, you do not understand. You do not know what you have
said."</p>

<p>"Not know what I have said?" La Guiche looked down his nose at
him. "A thousand devils, Jean! Am I an evil tongue as he has called
me? Am I a man lightly to slur a woman's honour?"</p>

<p>"It is what you have proved yourself," barked
Andr&eacute;-Louis, the eyes blazing in his bloodless face.</p>

<p>And de Batz anxiously, to cover that fresh provocation, ran on:
"You have listened to tales, to gossip, to scandal which is ever
about the name of a prince, which&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listened to scandal, you fool? Should I monger scandal? I speak
to what I know. This tale, this scandal was current in Toulon when
I was there. Because of it, because of the harm it was doing
Monsieur's cause, Maudet dispatched me to Hamm, to inform Monsieur,
so that he might come at once before it was too late to save even
his honour. There I taxed d'Entragues with it, and d'Entragues
could not deny it. But that is not all. I demanded to be taken
instantly before the Regent. In my indignation I would not be
denied. I was taken, and I surprised him in the arms of his woman.
I saw him, I tell you, with these eyes. Do I make myself plain? I
found him in the arms of Mademoiselle de Kercadiou, in
Mademoiselle's room at the Bear Inn, whither I was conducted."</p>

<p>De Batz loosed his arm, and fell back uttering a groan of
despair. He looked at Andr&eacute;-Louis, and pity smote him at the
sight of the young man's face.</p>

<p>"You say that you saw...that you saw..." Andr&eacute;-Louis
could not utter the words. The voice that had been so cold and hard
broke suddenly. "Oh, my God! My God! Is this true, La Guiche? Is
this true?"</p>

<p>The sudden change from anger to grief, from menace to pleading,
bewildered the Marquis. He put aside his own indignation to answer
solemnly.</p>

<p>"As God's my witness, it is true. Should I swear away a woman's
honour?"</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis continued to stare at him for a moment. Then
he covered his white face with trembling hands, his knees were
loosened, and he sank down upon his chair again. Recollection had
supplied something to confirm this dreadful story. His thoughts
flashed back to Coblentz. Again Madame de Balbi stood before him in
that room of the Three Crowns, warning him against Monsieur's
interest in Aline, and against Madame's intention of taking Aline
with her to Turin. He remembered words almost heated that had
passed between Aline and himself when she had censured him for
endangering the esteem which his highness showed her. And he, poor
fool, had never drawn the obvious inference from that heat. He
remembered that scene in the Prince's room at Hamm when Monsieur
had slighted his brother so as to remove all obstacles to
Andr&eacute;-Louis' departure for Paris with de Batz. He reviewed
it all in the revealing light of La Guiche's terrible disclosure,
and perceived that here was the reason why in all these months
Aline had never written, why she had ignored his last and so
insistent prayer to send him just two lines in her own hand. And
there was more.</p>

<p>He sat there, a man in agony, his elbows on his knees, his face
in his hands.</p>

<p>"That slug!" he sobbed. "That obscene, gross slug crawl upon my
pure white lily!"</p>

<p>La Guiche recoiled, a sudden horror on his face. His questioning
glance asked unnecessary confirmation of de Batz, and de Batz
unnecessarily confirmed.</p>

<p>"They were betrothed, La Guiche."</p>

<p>La Guiche was flung into an agony of remorse. "Andr&eacute;! My
poor Andr&eacute;! I did not know, Andr&eacute;. Forgive me. I did
not know. I did not dream..."</p>

<p>In silence Andr&eacute;-Louis made a gesture as of dismissal.
But the Marquis remained rooted there, his hawk face twisted into
lines of pain and anger.</p>

<p>"What a Prince to serve! What a Prince to die for. What a
consistence in his conduct! He could not come to join those who
were fighting his battles in Toulon, because he could not leave the
pursuit of the woman who belonged to the man who was fighting his
battles here in Paris. There's princely gratitude. Had I known all
when in Hamm I should certainly have pistolled him."</p>

<p>He tossed his arms to the ceiling as if in a protest to the
heavens beyond it, then swung to the fire, and stood with hunched
shoulders, staring gloomily into the heart of it.</p>

<p>De Batz crossed the room to set a hand affectionately, silently,
upon Andr&eacute;'s bowed shoulders. But he had no words. His heart
was sick within him. Not only was his grief deep and sincere, but
he was profoundly annoyed that the news should have come to numb
Andr&eacute;-Louis' faculties at a time when he would need them all
for the final task that now lay before them.</p>

<p>"Andr&eacute;!" he said at last, very gently. "Courage,
Andr&eacute;!"</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; roused himself. "Go," he said quietly. "Go, both of
you."</p>

<p>De Batz looked at him, then looked across at La Guiche, who had
turned his head. He signed to him, and together they quietly went
out, leaving Andr&eacute;-Louis alone with his sorrow.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIII - ON THE BRIDGE</h2>

<p>De Batz spent the morning at the Tuileries with the Citizen
Sevignon, as La Guiche was known to those with whom he had any
acquaintance there. They employed the time in doing what was
possible to influence the release of the Chevalier de Pomelles. But
their efforts promised little success. Lavicomterie, upon whom de
Batz was chiefly depending, pronounced the case a dangerous one in
which to meddle. The evidence before the Committee of Public Safety
was, he understood, of an overwhelming nature, and it had been
examined by Saint-Just, whose bloodthirst would hardly suffer the
unfortunate agent's escape. Still, cautiously, Lavicomterie would
see what could be done.</p>

<p>S&eacute;nard, the secretary of the committee, that other
valuable secret associate of the Baron's, also promised to do
anything that might be safely possible. But in his view, as in
Lavicomterie's, Saint-Just was the insurmountable obstacle.</p>

<p>"Well, well!" said de Batz. "At least delay Pomelles' trial. We
shall see what the next few days will bring forth."</p>

<p>To La Guiche, as they stepped down into the chill damp of the
gardens, he was more explicit. "If we can gain a few days all
should be well, for in a few days the obstacle will have been
removed."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it was in no state of elation that the two came
back to the Rue-de-M&eacute;nars for the mid-day meal. They found
Andr&eacute;-Louis seated before the fire, which was now burning
low, his foot upon the brass fender, his elbow on his knee, his
chin in his hand. He turned his head, and showed them a face that
was grey and drawn with pain, the face of a man who had suddenly
aged. Having seen who came he resumed his contemplation of the
fire.</p>

<p>De Batz went to set a hand upon his shoulder. "Come,
Andr&eacute;. Leave brooding. I know it hurts. But you must take
heart. There are things to do that will shift your thoughts from
your own wrongs. That will help."</p>

<p>"There is nothing more for me to do. I have finished."</p>

<p>"That is what you feel now. The blow is heavy. But your youth
will lend you the strength to bear it. Turn your mind to other
things. Oh, I know my world, Andr&eacute;. I am a deal older than
you, and I have not lived quite in vain, or without coming into
some knowledge of the human heart. Distraction is what you need,
and there is no distraction like work."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis stared up at him and laughed. It was an
expression of pain. "Work? What work?"</p>

<p>"Why, the work that lies before us. I have sent for Desmoulins;
he should have been here by now. When he comes&mdash;"</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis interrupted him.</p>

<p>"I have finished, I tell you. Finished with kingmaking."</p>

<p>"Faith," said La Guiche, "I should feel the same in his case."
De Batz walked slowly away, his chin on his breast. At the window
he turned. He sighed.</p>

<p>"If this infernal news had reached us before his work was done
at Bl&eacute;rancourt..." He spread his hands, his face
expressive.</p>

<p>"It would have been disastrous to the cause of his highness the
Regent, would it not?" said Andr&eacute;-Louis.</p>

<p>"Naturally," said the Marquis. "And I should not have blamed
you."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis took his foot from the fender, and slewed
round in his chair.</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear you say that, La Guiche."</p>

<p>"Glad?" quoth de Batz, who did not like either the young man's
tone, or his expression. "Do you mean something, Andr&eacute;?"</p>

<p>"If I ever meant anything." He paused, then added, "Desmoulins
has been here in your absence, Jean, and he has gone again."</p>

<p>"You gave him the documents. Good. No time need be lost. What
did he say? Wasn't he elated?"</p>

<p>"I did not mention the matter."</p>

<p>"But then..." de Batz checked, frowning. "You didn't give him
the documents? But don't you realize the danger of keeping them? At
any moment Saint-Just may hear from Bl&eacute;rancourt."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis laughed again, that odd, hard, mirthless
laugh. "On that score at least you need have no anxiety. He will
find nothing. There are the documents, Jean." And he pointed to a
heap of black ashes that lay on the narrow hearth, half-concealed
by the fender.</p>

<p>The Baron came forward, staring as if the eyes would drop from
his head. He fetched out a rough oath in a voice suddenly hoarse.
"Do you mean that you have burnt them? That you have burnt the
proofs? The fruit of all that labour?"</p>

<p>"It surprises you?" Andr&eacute;-Louis rose, thrusting back his
chair.</p>

<p>"Not me!" said La Guiche.</p>

<p>De Batz swung upon the Marquis, his face purple.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;my God!&mdash;do you realize what he has burnt? He
has burnt the evidence that would have sent Saint-Just to the
guillotine and brought down the Robespierrists in execration. He
has burnt the cause. That is what he has burnt. He has destroyed
the labour of months; rendered fruitless everything that we have
done." He checked, and turned again, raging, to Andr&eacute;-Louis.
"Oh, it is impossible! You haven't done this. You couldn't have
done it. You dared not do it. You are fooling me. You thought of it
perhaps, and you are making me realize the vengeance that you might
have taken."</p>

<p>Coldly Andr&eacute;-Louis answered him. "I am telling you what I
have done."</p>

<p>De Batz was trembling from head to foot in his anger. He raised
his clenched fist, and held it poised a moment, as if about to
strike Andr&eacute;-Louis. Then he let it fall heavily to his side
again.</p>

<p>"You scoundrel! Those papers were not yours to destroy. They
belonged to the cause."</p>

<p>"My betrothed was not his to destroy. She belonged to me."</p>

<p>"God of Heaven! You'll drive me mad. Your betrothed! Your
betrothed and the Regent! What is either of them when the fate of a
nation is at issue? Is only the Regent concerned in this?"</p>

<p>"The Regent or his family," said Andr&eacute;-Louis. "It is all
one to me."</p>

<p>"All one to you, you fool! Is it all one to you that a cause,
the monarchy itself, was at stake?"</p>

<p>"The monarchy means the House of Bourbon. I have not served the
House of Bourbon one half so vilely as the House of Bourbon has
served me. The harm that I have done to the House of Bourbon may be
repaired. The harm that a member of it, the very one for whom I
laboured and risked my life, has done to me can never be repaired.
Could I continue in his service after this?"</p>

<p>"To leave his service was your right," said La Guiche quietly,
sadly, "but not to destroy that which was not strictly yours."</p>

<p>"Not strictly mine? Did I not discover and collect those
documents? Did I not hourly risk detection and imperil my neck in
doing it, so that I might make kings for France out of such base
scoundrels as this Comte de Provence? And you say they are not
strictly mine? Mine or not, they are destroyed. It is
finished."</p>

<p>Stricken by anger and despair, de Batz could only inveigh.</p>

<p>"And so in a fit of spite, you villain, you wreck all our hopes
in the very moment of success. You render vain all that has been
done, wasted all the lives that have been sacrificed&mdash;Chabot,
Delaunay, Julien and the rest. The Freys, and even little
L&eacute;opoldine. The little L&eacute;opoldine about whom you were
so tender. All just waste. Oh, my God! Everything sacrificed on the
altar of your damned resentment. All because&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, have done!" rasped Andr&eacute;-Louis. "I've heard enough.
When you are calmer, perhaps you will understand."</p>

<p>"What will I understand? Your villainy?"</p>

<p>"The agony that inspired me." He passed a hand wearily across
his brow. "Jean," he said hoarsely, "if any consideration could
have restrained me, it must have been the thought of what this
would mean to you. But it did not occur to me at the time. We have
been good comrades, Jean. I am sorry it should end thus."</p>

<p>"You may take your regrets to Hell," said de Batz. "And that is
where I wish you." He paused merely so as to brace himself to
continue: "This is what comes of putting faith in a man who is
without loyalties to any but himself, a man who is now a royalist,
now a revolutionary, now a royalist again, as suits his own
personal ends; just consistent only in that all the time he is
Scaramouche. As God's my witness, I marvel that I don't kill you
for what you have done." With infinite contempt he repeated:
"Scaramouche!" And on the word, he struck Andr&eacute;-Louis hard
across the face with his open hand.</p>

<p>Instantly La Guiche was at his side, seizing his arm,
restraining him, interposing himself between them.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis, his breathing quickened, the impression of
the Baron's fingers showing faintly red upon the livid pallor of
his face, smiled faintly.</p>

<p>"It is no matter, La Guiche. No doubt he is as right by his own
lights as I am by mine."</p>

<p>But this only served to feed the Gascon's furious temper.</p>

<p>"You'll turn the other cheek, will you? You mealy-mouthed
moralist! You cheap-jack philosopher. Get you back to your theatre,
you clown. Go!"</p>

<p>"I go, de Batz. I could have wished that we had parted
otherwise. But it's no matter. I'll keep the blow, in memory of
you." He stepped past him, to the door. "Good-bye, La Guiche."</p>

<p>"A moment, Moreau," the Marquis cried. "Where are you
going?"</p>

<p>But Andr&eacute;-Louis did not answer him, the truth being that
he did not know. He stumbled out, and closed the door. From a peg
in the passage he took down his cloak and hat and sword, and with
these passed out, and descended the stairs.</p>

<p>In the courtyard below he was arrested. As he issued from the
house, a man in a heavy coat and a round hat was entering by the
porte-cochere followed by two municipals. It hardly required that
escort to announce the police spy. He stood in the path of
Andr&eacute;-Louis, scrutinizing him.</p>

<p>"You lodge here, citizen? What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Andr&eacute;-Louis Moreau, agent of the Committee of Public
Safety."</p>

<p>This man, however, was not intimidated by the description. "Your
card?"</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis produced it. The fellow looked at it, and
nodded to his municipals. "You are my man. Order for your arrest."
He waved a paper under Andr&eacute;-Louis' nose.</p>

<p>"The charge?" inquired Andr&eacute;-Louis, momentarily taken
aback.</p>

<p>The man turned on his heel contemptuously. Over his shoulder, as
he retreated, he spoke to his men. "Fetch him along."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis asked no further questions, offered no
protest. He had no doubt of the explanation. News had come to
Saint-Just from Bl&eacute;rancourt, and the representative had been
quick to act. And the papers which by now should have been in the
hands of Desmoulins, the papers with which he could have paralysed
all action on the part of Saint-Just, and by the production of
which he could have justified his unauthorized activities at
Bl&eacute;rancourt, were just a heap of ashes over which de Batz
was no doubt still raging above stairs.</p>

<p>If it was matter for anything, thought Andr&eacute;-Louis, it
was matter for laughter. And he laughed. His world had crumbled
about him.</p>

<p>They marched him across the Tuileries Gardens, along the quay,
over the Pont Neuf to the Conciergerie. In the porters' lodge they
searched him. They found upon him, besides a watch and some
assignats, to the value of perhaps a thousand livres, nothing of
worth or consequence. These effects were restored to him, and he
was marched away by dark, vaulted, stone-flagged passages below
stairs to a solitary cell where they left him to meditate upon the
imminent and abrupt ending of his odd career.</p>

<p>If he meditated upon it, he did so without dismay. There was
such pain in his heart, such numbness in his mind that he could
contemplate his end with complete indifference.</p>

<p>In a curious detachment he reviewed now the work he had done in
Paris since that June morning which had seen the fall of the
Girondins. It was not nice. It was all rather sordid. In his
kingmaking he had pursued the tactics of the agent provocateur. It
was ignoble. But at least it was appropriate in that it was done in
the service of an ignoble prince. It would be best to end it all,
to sleep, and to be free at last. Of Aline he sternly endeavoured
not to think at all, since he could not bear the image which the
thought of her brought to stand before his mental eyes.</p>

<p>Late that night, as he sat in the dark, the key grated in his
door. It opened, and in the yellow light of a lantern, two men
stood framed in the doorway. One took the lantern from the other,
spoke some words, entered, and closed the door. He came forward,
and set the lantern on the soiled deal table. He was a slender,
elegant young man with the face of an Antinous under a cluster of
golden hair. His eyes were large, liquid and tender, but as they
looked upon Andr&eacute;-Louis who sat unmoved, the lines of the
handsome face were stern. It was Saint-Just.</p>

<p>"So you are the rogue who went to play comedy at
Bl&eacute;rancourt?" He spoke on a note of quiet derision.</p>

<p>Something of the old spirit of Scaramouche flared up from that
dejected soul.</p>

<p>"I am rather a good comedian, don't you think, my dear
Chevalier."</p>

<p>Saint-Just frowned, annoyed by the title. Then he faintly smiled
as he shook his golden head. "Not good enough for comedy. I hope
you'll play tragedy better. The stage is set for you on the Place
de la Revolution. The play is The National Barber."</p>

<p>"And you are the author, I suppose. But there may be a part
there for you, too, before very long, in a play called 'Poetic
Justice' or 'The Biter Bit.'"</p>

<p>Saint-Just continued to regard him steadily. "You are possibly
under the delusion that you will be given an opportunity to talk
when you come to trial? That you will be able to tell the world of
certain things you ferreted out at Bl&eacute;rancourt?"</p>

<p>"Is it a delusion?"</p>

<p>"Entirely. For there will be no trial. I have given my
instructions. There will be a mistake. A mistake for reasons of
State. You will be included, entirely by accident, in the next
batch sent to execution. The mistake&mdash;the so regrettable
mistake&mdash;will be discovered afterwards."</p>

<p>He ceased speaking and waited.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis shrugged indifferently. "Who cares?"</p>

<p>"You think that I am bluffing you?"</p>

<p>"I see no other object in your coming here to tell me this."</p>

<p>"Ah! It does not occur to you that I might wish to give you a
chance."</p>

<p>"I thought that would follow. After the bluff, the bargain."</p>

<p>"A bargain, yes; if you choose. But bluff there is none. You
stole certain papers from Thuillier at Bl&eacute;rancourt."</p>

<p>"Yes, and others from Bontemps. Hadn't you heard?"</p>

<p>"Where are they now?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say you haven't found them? Yet you'll have
searched my lodgings, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Don't play the fool, Moreau." The gentle voice acquired a rasp.
"Of course I have had your lodgings searched&mdash;searched under
my own supervision."</p>

<p>"And you haven't found the letters? But how vexatious for you! I
wonder where they can have got to."</p>

<p>"So do I," snapped Saint-Just. "My curiosity is so lively that
I'll give you your life and a safe-conduct in exchange for the
information."</p>

<p>"In exchange for the information?"</p>

<p>"In exchange for the letters, that is to say."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis took his time, regarding him. Under his
admirable self-control, an anxiety was to be guessed in Saint-Just.
"Ah! That's different. I am afraid it's beyond my power to give you
the letters."</p>

<p>"Your head will fall if you don't, and that to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Then my head must fall. For I can't give you the letters."</p>

<p>"What do you hope to gain by obstinacy? The letters will buy
your life. Where are they?"</p>

<p>"Where you'll never find them."</p>

<p>There followed a considerable pause, during which Saint-Just
continued steadily to regard him. The representative's breathing
had quickened a little. In the yellow light of the lantern his
colour seemed to have darkened.</p>

<p>"I am offering you your only chance of life, Moreau."</p>

<p>"How you repeat yourself," said Andr&eacute;-Louis.</p>

<p>"You are resolved not to tell me?"</p>

<p>"I have told you. I have nothing to add."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Saint-Just quietly, yet with obvious
reluctance. "Very well!" He picked up the lantern, and walked to
the door. There he turned. He held up the lantern, so that its
light fell full upon the prisoner's face. "For the last time: will
you buy your life with them?"</p>

<p>"You're tiresome. Go to the devil."</p>

<p>Saint-Just pressed his lips together, lowered the lantern, and
went out.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis sat alone in darkness once more. He told
himself that no doubt he was rightly punished for what he had done.
Then he relapsed into his weary indifference of what might
follow.</p>

<p>Early next morning a gaoler brought him a lump of horrible black
bread and a jug of water. He drank the water, but made no attempt
to touch the repulsive bread. After that he sat on, in a dull
numbed state of body and of mind, and waited.</p>

<p>Sooner than he had expected, less than an hour after serving him
that breakfast, the gaoler appeared again. He held the door open,
and beckoned him.</p>

<p>"You are to come with me, citizen."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis looked at his watch. It was half-past nine.
Singularly early for the tumbrils to be setting out. Was he,
perhaps, to have a trial, after all? At the thought a tiny flame of
hope was kindled, almost despite him, in his soul.</p>

<p>But it was extinguished when he found himself conducted to the
hall where the toilet of the condemned was usually performed. Here,
however, a great surprise awaited him. The vaulted place was
tenanted by a single person: a short, trim, sturdy figure dressed
in black. It was de Batz.</p>

<p>The Baron advanced to meet him. "I have an order for your
release," he said, quietly grave. "Come along."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis wondered if he was still asleep in his cell
and dreaming. His sensations were curiously unreal, and the gloom
of the hall on that January morning served to add to their
unreality. In this vague condition he stepped beside de Batz to the
porters' lodge, where they were detained. The Baron presented a
paper, and the concierge scratched an entry in a book, then grinned
up at them from under his fur bonnet.</p>

<p>"You're lucky, my lad, to be leaving us so soon. And on foot.
It's more usual to ride from here in style. A good-day to you!"</p>

<p>They were outside on the quay, under the grey sky, beside the
yellow swollen river. They walked along in silence towards the Pont
Neuf. Midway across this a quacksalver was setting up his booth. A
little way beyond him, Andr&eacute;-Louis slackened his pace. The
Baron slackened with him.</p>

<p>"It is time we talked, Jean. There will be some explanation of
this morning walk."</p>

<p>The Baron looked at him, and the sternness of his face
relaxed.</p>

<p>"I owed you what I have done. That is all. For one thing, I
struck you yesterday. Because you might desire satisfaction of me
one day for the blow, I could not meanly leave you to perish."</p>

<p>Despite himself Andr&eacute;-Louis smiled at the Gasconnade.
"Was that your only reason for doing whatever you have done?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. I owed it you on other grounds. As an amend, if
you choose." He leaned upon the parapet of the bridge, looking down
at the water swirling against the piers. Andr&eacute;-Louis leaned
beside him. They were practically alone there. Briefly, gloomily,
tonelessly, de Batz informed him of what had happened.</p>

<p>"Tissot witnessed your arrest yesterday in the courtyard. He
brought us word of it at once, of course, and as we did not know
what might follow, but knew that we were not safe, ourselves, we
made off at once, and went to earth at Roussel's in the Rue
Helv&eacute;tius. We were thankful to get away, and no more than in
time. I left Tissot to observe. He reported to me last night that
within a few minutes of our departure, Saint-Just, himself, arrived
with a couple of municipals. They ransacked my lodgings so
thoroughly that they have left them in a state of wreckage.</p>

<p>"Your action in not giving the documents to Desmoulins, so that
with them we could now defy Saint-Just, placed us all in a position
of great danger. It became necessary to meet it. I went to
Saint-Just two hours ago. He was still in bed. But he was glad to
see me, and received me with threats of instant arrest, with the
guillotine to follow, unless I chose to purchase my life and
liberty by surrendering to him the letters which you had stolen
from Thuillier and Bontemps.</p>

<p>"I laughed at him. 'Do you suppose, Saint-Just, that I should
walk into your house without being aware that this is how you would
receive me, and, therefore, without taking my precautions? You are
not really clever, Saint-Just. You succeed in imposing yourself
upon those who are even more foolish than yourself; that is all.
When you threaten to take off my head, you really threaten to take
off your own. For the one follows upon the other as inevitably as
effect upon cause.'</p>

<p>"That gave him something to think about.</p>

<p>"'You have come to bargain with me?' he said.</p>

<p>"'A moment's reflection must have shown you that I could come
for no other purpose, and you might have spared the breath you
wasted in threats.'</p>

<p>"He seemed relieved, poor fool. 'You have brought me the
letters, then?'</p>

<p>"'Either you are ingenuous, Saint-Just, or you think that I am.
No, my friend, I have not brought you the letters, and I never
shall. I have brought you a warning, that is all. A warning that if
you raise a finger against me, and unless you do what else I
require, those letters will instantly be in the hands of
Danton.'</p>

<p>"That put him in a panic. 'You would never dare,' he roared.</p>

<p>"'But why not?' I asked him. 'It is you who will not dare to
refuse me, now that you know that your head will pay the price of
your refusal. For you can be under no delusion as to what use
Danton will make of the letters. Their publication will show that
the ci-devant Chevalier de Saint-Just (that is how they will speak
of you, how they are sneaking of you already) the ci-devant
Chevalier de Saint-Just is true to the evil aristocratic stock from
which he springs. That he enriches himself at the expense of the
nation, and that he abuses his power to issue letters of cachet so
as to put away the inconvenient persons he has wronged. And that he
covers it all under a mantle of virtue, of asceticism,
hypocritically preaching purity in private as in public life. A
nice tale, Saint-Just. A nice tale to be told by a man with the
proofs in his hand.'</p>

<p>"He sprang at me like a tiger, his hands reaching for my throat.
I laid him low by a kick in the stomach, and invited him to leave
violence, come to his senses, and consider his position and
mine.</p>

<p>"He gathered himself up, in a rage. He sat down, half-naked as
he was, on his tumbled bed and talked foolishly at first, then more
wisely. I should have all I wanted in return for the letters.</p>

<p>"But I shook my head at him. 'I do not trust you, Saint-Just. I
know your record. You are a low, dishonest scoundrel, and only a
fool would take your word. It is for you to take mine. And take it
you must because you cannot help yourself. I'll keep faith with you
as long as you keep faith with me. Do as I require of you, and I
give you my word of honour that no man shall ever see those
letters. You may consider them as good as destroyed, and you may
sleep in peace. But I do not surrender them, because if I did so I
should have no guarantee that you would not play me false. In other
words, I retain them so as to keep you honest.'</p>

<p>"That, of course, was not the end of it. We talked for nearly
half an hour. But at last he came to it, as it was clear that he
must. What choice had he? Better take the risk of my keeping faith
with him than face the certainty I had given him that the letters
would go to Danton at once. He ended by surrendering. He would
attempt nothing against me, and he would give me at once an order
for your release and a safe-conduct for you, in case it should now
be necessary, so as to enable you to depart the country."</p>

<p>There was silence. They continued to lean upon the parapet.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis fetched a ponderous sigh. "You have been
generous, Jean. I did not deserve this at your hands."</p>

<p>"I am aware of it." De Batz was stern. "But I struck you
yesterday, and I say again, it is in my code that I must preserve
the life of any man who has grounds for demanding satisfaction of
me."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis turned sideways against the stone parapet, so
as to face the Gascon "But you also said that you have another
reason?"</p>

<p>"It is true. I have preserved you also because I require of you
in return a last service to the cause."</p>

<p>"Ah, that, no! Name of God, I will not raise a
finger&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait, child! Hear first what the service is. It is one that you
may actually desire to discharge. If you don't I'll not insist. I
invite you to seek out the Comte de Provence. He should be at Turin
by now, under the hospitality of his father-in-law, the King of
Sardinia. Tell him of what has happened here and of how we had
brought matters to the very threshold of success for him. Then tell
him how the chance was destroyed and why."</p>

<p>It took Andr&eacute;-Louis aback. "To what purpose this?"</p>

<p>"The story has a moral. It may serve as a warning to him.
Considering it, he may come into some acquaintance with honour. Let
him know that his wanton neglect of it on this occasion has cost
him more than the loss of Toulon. Thus he may render himself more
worthy of the position he holds at the head of the monarchical
cause in France, and he may see to it in future that he holds that
position by virtue of something more than his birth. You may say
that I sent you. Tell him that if I remain it is because I trust
that this bitter lesson will not be wasted." He paused, and the
keen dark eyes flashed as he turned them upon his companion. "Will
you go?"</p>

<p>A smile of infinite bitterness broke across the haggard face of
Andr&eacute;-Louis.</p>

<p>"I will go, Jean."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIV - ACCOUNT RENDERED</h2>

<p>It may interest those who are concerned to analyse the sequel of
events, the multiplication of circumstance, amoeba-like by fission,
to speculate upon what might have been the end of this story of
Andr&eacute;-Louis Moreau, but for that mission upon which the
Baron de Batz dispatched him, as a last service to the cause. Among
his surviving papers there is no hint of what alternative he might
have found.</p>

<p>Neither are there any details of the journey to Turin upon which
he obediently set out. Remembering that the long line of French
frontier from Belgium to the Mediterranean was an armed camp and
that he would have to pass through it, the difficulties he
encountered must have been considerable. We are also left to infer
this from the fact that it was not until the early days of the
following April that he rode into the capital of the Kingdom of
Sardinia. He arrived there at just about the time that the
triumphant Robespierrists, whose fate for a moment had lain in the
hollow of his hand, were assuming the undisputed mastery of France.
Danton's great head had rolled into the executioner's basket, and
Robespierre, ably supported by his terrible acolytes, Saint-Just
and Couthon, was establishing with these two an evil triumvirate
whose power was absolute. The restoration of the monarchy had never
seemed so distant.</p>

<p>Turin, which Andr&eacute;-Louis had deemed his goal, was to
prove but a halting-place upon the way. He learned there that the
Comte de Provence, unable to find an abiding refuge at the court of
his timid father-in-law, had, after many humiliating appeals, been
accorded in Verona the hospitality of the Republic of Venice. This
as a result of representations made on his behalf by Russia and
Spain, who undertook presently to provide for him more
permanently.</p>

<p>His highness had been received by the Most Serene Republic
subject to certain rigorous conditions. He was to do nothing that
should compromise the Republic's strict neutrality. The title of
Regent which he had assumed would not there be recognized, nor must
he look for any of the courtesies normally commanded by a person of
royal blood.</p>

<p>To comply he had assumed the title of Comte de Lisle, and he was
quietly installed in the summer residence of the patrician family
of Gazzola, near the Capuchin Convent in the suburbs of Verona. It
was a simple, unpretentious villa, clad in jessamine and
clematis.</p>

<p>His little court was much the same as it had been at Hamm. It
was composed by the Counts d'Avaray and d'Entragues; two
secretaries, one of whom was the Comte de Plougastel; a surgeon,
Monsieur Colon; and four servants. The remainder of those who
followed him or sought him in his exile were lodged in the inns of
the town. For the rest, his existence was as impecunious as it had
been in Westphalia, and he was constrained to continue the practice
of a frugality unwelcome to one who loved good cheer as much as he
did.</p>

<p>To seek him in these surroundings Andr&eacute;-Louis rode out
from Turin again, and took the road through Piedmont and across the
fertile plain of Lombardy where spring had spread already her
luxuriant carpets. It was on an April day that he rode at last
dusty and travel-worn into the lovely, ancient, brick-and-marble
city of the Scaligers, and drew rein in the courtyard of the Due
Toni in the Piazza dei Signori.</p>

<p>Here, scarcely had he set foot to the ground, whilst an ostler
led away his horse, and the landlord stood to receive his commands,
a lady dressed for walking, in a long claret cloak and a wide black
hat, who issued from the inn, was brought to a staggering halt on
the very threshold by the sight of him.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis found himself looking into the face of Madame
de Plougastel, a white face in which the lips were parted, the eyes
wide and the eyebrows raised, its whole expression blending
astonishment and fear.</p>

<p>To him, too, there was, of course, surprise in the meeting. But
it was slight and transient. Her presence here was very natural,
and she was of those he must have sought before again
departing.</p>

<p>He bared his head, and bowed low with a murmured: "Madame!"</p>

<p>Thereupon, after another instant's gaping pause, she brushed
past the landlord and came to clutch the traveller by his two
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Andr&eacute;-Louis!" she cried, her note almost interrogative.
"Andr&eacute;-Louis! It is you. It is you."</p>

<p>There was a queer tenderness in her voice that moved him. He
feared that she was about to weep. He schooled himself to reply in
quiet, level tones.</p>

<p>"It is I, Madame. I take you by surprise, no doubt."</p>

<p>"No doubt? You take me by surprise. By surprise?" And now it
seemed as if she wanted to laugh, or as if she balanced between
laughter and tears. "Whence are you? Whence do you spring?" she
asked him.</p>

<p>"Why, from France, of course."</p>

<p>"Of course? You say of course? You spring from the grave, and
you say I come from France, of course."</p>

<p>But as now it was his turn to stare, she took him by the
arm.</p>

<p>"Come you in," she said, and almost dragged him with her across
the threshold, leaving the landlord to shrug his shoulders and to
inform the waiting ostler in confidence that they were all mad,
these French.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis was conducted along a gloomy, unevenly-paved
passage, and ushered into an austere but fairly spacious
sitting-room on the left of it. A rug was spread on the stone
floor. The ceiling was rudely frescoed in a pattern of fruit and
flowers. The sparse furniture was of dark walnut, roughly carved.
The tall mullioned windows, about which green creepers rioted,
looked out upon a garden splashed with sunshine.</p>

<p>He stood bemused in mid-apartment whilst for a moment again she
surveyed him. Then, still bemused, she had taken him in her arms.
She was kissing him fondly and fondly murmuring his name before he
took alarm at her transports.</p>

<p>"Madame! Madame! In Heaven's name, collect yourself,
madame."</p>

<p>"Can I help it, Andr&eacute;-Louis? Can I help it? I have
believed you dead, and mourned you these months, and now...and
now..." She was weeping.</p>

<p>"You have believed me dead?" He stood suddenly stiff within the
compass of those maternal arms. His quick mind, that ever moved by
leaps, was racing over all that was implied in that assertion.</p>

<p>And then the door behind them opened. A harsh voice spoke.</p>

<p>"I have been waiting, madame, for..." The voice checked, and
then exclaimed: "Name of God! What is this?"</p>

<p>They fell apart. Andr&eacute;-Louis turned. On the threshold,
the door wide behind him, stood Monsieur de Plougastel, his brows
knit, his face darkening.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis stood confused, fearful for his mother. But
she, helped perhaps by her excitement, by the singleness of her
thought, displayed no awkwardness.</p>

<p>"But look who it is, Plougastel."</p>

<p>The Count craned his neck to stare. "Moreau!" he said. He too
was faintly surprised. But in the main indifferent. This godson of
Kercadiou's was nothing to him, and he had always thought his wife
ridiculous in her attachment to this good-for-nothing, simply
because she had known him as a child. "We thought you dead," he
added, and closed the door.</p>

<p>"But he's alive! Alive!" exclaimed Madame in a quivering
voice.</p>

<p>"So I perceive." Monsieur de Plougastel was dry. "God knows if
he's to be envied."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis, now white and grim, desired to know how such
a thing had been assumed, and heard, of course, that Lang&eacute;ac
had borne the tale to Hamm of his having been killed in the attempt
to rescue the Queen.</p>

<p>"But Lang&eacute;ac was followed by another messenger who
carried the true story, and also a letter from me to Aline. I know
that he arrived safely."</p>

<p>"The letter never did," Madame asserted.</p>

<p>"But that is impossible, madame. I know that the letter arrived.
And it was not by any means the last. I sent several others, and
some of the messengers I have since seen, and I have heard from
them that those letters were delivered. What does it mean? Can
Aline have wished to&mdash;"</p>

<p>Madame interrupted him. "Aline mourned you for dead. Aline never
had any news of you directly or indirectly after the tale that
Lang&eacute;ac brought of your death. Of that you can be sure. I
can answer for what Aline believed as I can answer for what I
believed, myself."</p>

<p>"But then? My letters?" he cried almost in exasperation.</p>

<p>"It is impossible that she should have received them. Impossible
that she would not have told me. She knew my own..." she checked,
remembering Plougastel's presence, choked down the word "anguish"
and replaced it by "concern." Then she continued: "But apart from
that, I know, Andr&eacute;, I know that she remained in the
conviction that you were dead."</p>

<p>He stood there clenching and unclenching his hands, his chin on
his breast. There was something here he could not fathom. Links
were missing from the chain he sought to complete.</p>

<p>Abruptly he asked of her and of the Comte de Plougastel, who
remained coldly aloof, the question beating in his mind. "How was
it possible that these letters were not delivered to her?" And
swift on the heels of this came his next fierce question, addressed
directly to the Count. "By whose contriving was it? Do you know,
Monsieur de Plougastel?"</p>

<p>Plougastel raised his brows. "What do you mean? Do I know?"</p>

<p>"You were in attendance upon Monsieur. It may be within your
knowledge. That these letters reached Hamm leaves no doubt.
Lang&eacute;ac assured me of it so far as the one he carried for me
was concerned. He told me that he left it with Monsieur
d'Entragues, to be delivered. Monsieur d'Entragues?" Again it was
Plougastel he questioned. "Ay, it lies between Monsieur d'Entragues
and the Regent."</p>

<p>It was Madame de Plougastel who answered him.</p>

<p>"If those letters reached the hands of Monsieur d'Entragues,
they must have been suppressed, Andr&eacute;."</p>

<p>"It is the conclusion I had formed, madame," said
Andr&eacute;-Louis, whilst the Count stormed at his lady for an
assertion which he described as monstrous.</p>

<p>"It is not the assertion that is monstrous, but the fact," she
retorted. "For clearly it must be the fact."</p>

<p>Monsieur de Plougastel empurpled. "Madame, in all my life I have
never known you practise discretion in your assumptions. But this
transcends all bounds."</p>

<p>What further form his voluble protest took Andr&eacute;-Louis
did not wait to ascertain. He heard his storming voice, but did not
heed his words. Abruptly he quitted the room, and went forth to
demand his horse and directions touching the whereabouts of the
Casa Gazzola.</p>

<p>He came to that modest villa in the outskirts, tethered his
horse within the gateway and strode purposefully to the door within
the creeper-clad porch. It stood open to the little hallway. He
rapped with the butt of his riding-whip on the panel, and to the
servant who came in answer to the summons announced himself a
courier from Paris.</p>

<p>This made a stir. Only a moment was he kept waiting in the hall
until d'Entragues, scrupulously dressed as ever, graceful and
consequential as if they were at Versailles, came hurrying forth.
At sight of Andr&eacute;-Louis the Count checked, and the
expression of the dark, handsome face with its deeply graven,
rather sinister lines underwent a perceptible change.</p>

<p>"Moreau!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis bowed. He was very coldly self-possessed now,
his face set and grim. "Your memory flatters me, Monsieur le Comte.
You believed me dead, I think?"</p>

<p>D'Entragues missed the mockery in his tone. He stammered in the
precipitance of his affirmative reply, in his expressions of
satisfaction at this evidence that the rumours had been unfounded.
Then dismissing all that in haste, he ended on the question: "Are
you from Paris, do you say?"</p>

<p>"With extraordinary news."</p>

<p>To d'Entragues' excited demand for details Andr&eacute;-Louis
swore that he had not breath to tell his tale twice, and desired to
be taken at once to the Regent.</p>

<p>He was ushered into the presence chamber, which, if of no better
proportions, was at least more dignified than that of Hamm. The
floor was marbled and the ceiling trivially frescoed with cupids
and garlands, the work of some journeyman artist's hand. There was
a carved press, a gilded coffer, some tall chairs in dark leather
with faded gildings were ranged against the wall, and in the middle
of the well-lighted room a table with corkscrew legs at which his
highness sat at work. He appeared to have increased in bulk and
weight, but his face had lost some of its high colour. He was
neatly dressed, and his head was powdered. He wore the ribbon of
the Holy Ghost and a small dress sword. At the table's farther end
sat the Comte d'Avaray, pallid, fair and frail.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Moreau, with news from Paris, monseigneur,"
d'Entragues announced.</p>

<p>His highness laid down his pen and looked up. Liquid eyes that
seemed full of pathos pondered the newcomer, noted the dust upon
him and the erect carriage of his slender, vigorous figure.</p>

<p>"Moreau?" he echoed. "Moreau?" The name was awakening memories
in the royal mind. They came with a rush, and at their coming the
colour rose in the great face and then receded again. The voice
strove to maintain its level tone. "Ah, Moreau! And from Paris,
with news, you say?"</p>

<p>"With great news, monseigneur," Andr&eacute;-Louis replied. "I
am sent by the Baron de Batz to give your highness the full details
of the underground campaign we have been conducting against the
revolutionaries, and of the stages by which we possessed ourselves
of the keys to ultimate success."</p>

<p>"Success?" the Regent echoed. He leaned forward eagerly.
"Success, sir?"</p>

<p>"Your highness shall judge."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis was very cold and formal in his manner. He
began with the fall of the Girondins, stressing the part which de
Batz and he had played in this by their propaganda.</p>

<p>"They were the most dangerous of all the foes of monarchy," he
explained, "because they were sane and moderate in their notions.
If they had prevailed they would have set up an orderly republican
government under which the people might have been content.
Therefore their removal was a great forward step. It left the
government entirely in the hands of incompetent men. Disruption and
famine followed. Discontent arose and a disposition to violence
which only required clear direction so as to be turned into the
proper channels.</p>

<p>"This is what we set out to do: to expose for the venal
scoundrels that they were the men whom the people trusted; and to
show the connection between this rascality and the sufferings and
privations which in the name of Liberty the people were
undergoing."</p>

<p>Briefly he sketched the India Company scandal in which they had
implicated Chabot, Bazire and the other prominent men of the
Mountain party, momentarily bringing that party into disrepute and
suspicion. He showed how again their active propaganda had
intensified the feeling.</p>

<p>"It was a bad moment for the Robespierrists. They knew
themselves sorely shaken in the public esteem. But they rallied.
Saint-Just, the ablest of them all, the champion and guiding spirit
of Robespierre, boldly grasped the nettle and preached a crusade of
purification against all those who trafficked in their mandate, to
which trafficking he assigned the public distress.</p>

<p>"For a moment confidence was restored. But it left the
Robespierrists shaken, and another such blow at the right moment
must lay them low."</p>

<p>He went on to mention the return of Danton, and to dwell upon
Danton's moderate and rather reactionary spirit, aroused by the
excesses of the H&eacute;bertistes and Robespierrists. He showed
how confidently de Batz counted upon Danton to bring back the
monarchy once the others were out of the way, and he went on to the
measures taken for their elimination. Danton had begun by attacking
H&eacute;bert and his gang, and he had destroyed them, aided at the
last moment by Robespierre.</p>

<p>And then, at last, he came to the steps which he personally had
taken so as to expose the venality, hypocrisy and secret tyranny of
that popular idol Saint-Just, clearly convincing the Regent that
the revolution would never survive Saint-Just's fall.</p>

<p>"I come back to Paris," he said, "with the completest proofs of
Saint-Just's villainy and corruption." He detailed them, and went
on, "Desmoulins is to expose him in the Vieux Cordelier as a
beginning. Then another&mdash;and that other will be Danton
himself&mdash;will follow up the publication by an attack in the
Convention, an attack which is not to be met, an attack under which
Saint-Just must inevitably go down, dragging Robespierre with him,
and leaving the party discredited, despised, detested. Danton will
remain at the head of a state faced by a people weary of revolution
and finally disillusioned on the subject of revolutionists, finally
persuaded that their faith has been abused."</p>

<p>He paused. They were silent, intent, moved by an excitement
which had been visibly growing in a measure as the clear narrative
proceeded. As he paused there was a movement almost of impatience
from d'Avaray, whose pale eyes were fixed upon him. The Regent, no
less intent, mumbled:</p>

<p>"Well, sir? Well?"</p>

<p>D'Entragues' keener wits had been a little puzzled by the tense
Andr&eacute;-Louis was employing. "Do you mean," he asked, "that
this is the situation which is now established?"</p>

<p>"This is the situation we had established just before I left
Paris. It was something to compensate for the fall of Toulon and
the royalist defeat in the South, something worth a dozen royalist
victories in the field, for it opens the door for the unopposed
return of the monarchical party. Your highness perceives this?"</p>

<p>The Regent was trembling in his excitement.</p>

<p>"Of course I perceive it. It is astounding. I can scarcely
believe in so much good fortune at last, after all that we have
suffered."</p>

<p>"I am glad that you perceive the inevitability of the success to
follow, monseigneur."</p>

<p>"By now it must have followed," cut in d'Avaray. "If this was
the state of affairs you left in Paris, the rest must already have
happened."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis stood looking at them with brooding eyes. The
normal pallor of his face had deepened in the last moment or two;
the ghost of an oddly-mocking smile had crept round the corners of
his lips.</p>

<p>"Come, sir," cried the Regent breathlessly. "Have you any doubt
of what Monsieur d'Avaray says? Surely no doubt is possible."</p>

<p>"No doubt would have been possible if the plan for which we had
laboured had been executed. If the weapons of success of which I
had obtained possession had been wielded."</p>

<p>D'Entragues took a step towards him. The Regent and d'Avaray
leaned forward. From the three of them simultaneously came the awed
question: "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I should not be troubling you with this report if the Baron de
Batz had not desired me to lay it before you," said
Andr&eacute;-Louis by way of preface. Then he explained himself.
"On my return from Bl&eacute;rancourt with those proofs which I had
employed my wits and risked my head to obtain, I made the discovery
that during all those months when I had been braving death in Paris
in the service of the monarchical cause, the head of that cause had
been taking advantage of my absence to seduce the lady whom he knew
was promised to me in marriage. It is only now, since my arrival
here this morning, that I have discovered the full extent of this
betrayal. So as to remove the barriers which the lady's honour and
loyalty must present to his ignoble aims, this disloyal prince did
not scruple to have me represented as dead, and to suppress my
letters to her, which would have proved me living. An incredible
story, is it not, messieurs?"</p>

<p>In the momentary pause that he made, they were too dumbfounded
to interpose a word. Dispassionately he continued.</p>

<p>"When I discovered this, I perceived that no good could come to
any country under the rule of a prince so treacherous and base.
Therefore I thrust into the fire those papers which by destroying
the Robespierrists must have opened the gates for your highness's
speedy return to France.</p>

<p>"That is all my report, messieurs," he concluded quietly. "I
should not, I repeat, have troubled to journey here to make it, but
that the Baron de Batz considered that your highness should have
it. He perceives a moral in the tale, which he hopes&mdash;since he
remains behind to continue to labour in your service&mdash;your
highness will also perceive, and, perceiving it, perhaps study to
become worthy of the high destiny to which you may yet be
called."</p>

<p>"You dare?" said d'Avaray, leaping to his feet.</p>

<p>"Oh no. These words are not mine. They are the message from
Monsieur de Batz. Myself, I nourish no such hope. If I had no
illusions on the subject of the gratitude of princes, at least I
had illusions on the subject of their honour when I set out at the
risk of my life to become a kingmaker. But it has never been among
my illusions that a man can run counter to his nature." He
shrugged, and ceased at last, his dark eyes travelling from one to
the other of them, the curve of his lips expressing his unutterable
contempt.</p>

<p>The Prince sat back, white to his twitching mouth, his body
limp. D'Avaray, with eyes flaming in a livid face, remained
standing where he had risen. D'Entragues, the only one to preserve
his colour, faced Andr&eacute;-Louis at closer quarters and conned
him with narrowing, wicked eyes.</p>

<p>"You scoundrel! Not only have you committed this atrocious
crime, but you dare to come here and tell us of it to our face, so
lost to respect of his highness that you can permit yourself to
speak as you have done."</p>

<p>"Did you use the word 'respect', Monsieur d'Entragues?" He
laughed into the dark countenance that was within a foot of his
own. "It need not surprise you or him that my feeling is something
very different. Let him be thankful that his royal blood places him
beyond the reach of the satisfaction it is my right to claim."</p>

<p>The Regent rocked in his chair "This insolence! My God, this
insolence! To what have I fallen?"</p>

<p>"To what, indeed!" said Andr&eacute;-Louis.</p>

<p>But now, d'Avaray, quivering with anger for his master, came
swiftly round the table. "It shall be punished, monseigneur. I
claim to act for you where your rank forbids you to act for
yourself." He confronted Andr&eacute;-Louis. "That for your
insolence, you poor rascal," he said, and swept his fingers across
the young man's cheek.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis fell back, and bowed to him, even as the
Regent struggled to his feet.</p>

<p>"No, no! D'Avaray! It shall not be. I forbid it, do you hear? I
forbid it. Let him go. What do his words matter? You cannot meet a
man so base, a nameless bastard. To the door with him. D'Entragues,
Monsieur Moreau to the door."</p>

<p>"The door for me, certainly, Monsieur d'Entragues," said
Andr&eacute;-Louis, and turned on his heel.</p>

<p>D'Entragues, stepping swiftly ahead of him, flung wide the door,
and stood haughtily aside to let him pass. On the threshold
Andr&eacute;-Louis paused and turned.</p>

<p>"I am lodged at the Two Towers, Monsieur d'Avaray. And I shall
be there until to-morrow if you want me, or if you feel that this
is a matter which you may pursue in honour."</p>

<p>But the Regent anticipated his favourite. "If you are still
there to-morrow, by God I'll send my grooms to give you the
thrashing you deserve."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis smiled his contempt. "You are consistent,
monseigneur." And on that went out, leaving rage and shame behind
him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLV - BACK TO HAMM</h2>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis carried away from the Casa Gazzola a
bitterness that choked him. For all the calm self-command he had
exhibited to the end, he had that day torn open again the dreadful
wound in his soul so that the Regent might behold it. And the
compensating satisfaction to him had been less than he had thought
to find in the discharge of that scornful errand upon which de Batz
had sent him.</p>

<p>He had failed, he knew, to pierce the armour of egotism in which
Monsieur was empanoplied. Monsieur, whilst affronted and angry, had
yet remained untouched in his conscience by any sense of having
merited the outrage to his dignity which Andr&eacute;-Louis Moreau
had perpetrated. He resented the words uttered in his presence much
as he might have resented an offensive gesture from some urchin in
the streets of Verona. Fools and egotists remain what they are
because of their self-complacency and lack of the faculty of
self-criticism. It is not within their power to view their actions
in the light in which they are revealed to others. Blind to the
cause which they may have supplied, they have only indignation for
effects which are hostile to themselves.</p>

<p>Something of this Andr&eacute;-Louis considered as he rode back
to the Two Towers. It did not sweeten his mood or provide balm for
his suffering. His vengeance had failed because the man at whom it
was aimed could not perceive that it was deserved. It required more
than words to hurt such men as the Comte de Provence. He should
have given them more. He should have insisted upon satisfaction
from that fool d'Avaray. Or, better still, he should have put a
quarrel upon d'Entragues, that sly scoundrel who had played the
pander to the extent of suppressing his letters, or, at least, of
being a party to their suppression. He had forgotten d'Entragues'
part in the business in the concentration of his resentment against
the chief and unassailable offender. But, after all, it was no
great matter. What real satisfaction could lie in visiting upon
those lackeys, d'Entragues and d'Avaray, the sins of their
master?</p>

<p>As he dismounted in the courtyard of the Two Towers he was
suddenly overwhelmed by a sense of his aimlessness. It was as if
his life had suddenly come to an end. He knew not whither now to
turn his steps, for nowhere did any purpose await him.</p>

<p>The landlord met him on the threshold with the information that
a room had been prepared for him, and at the same time with a
message from Madame de Plougastel, requesting him to wait upon her
at the earliest moment.</p>

<p>"Conduct me to her," he said indifferently.</p>

<p>Still with the dust of travel upon him and his fast unbroken, he
was ushered into that same room in which a couple of hours ago he
had left her. She was alone when he entered, standing by the
window, from which she had witnessed his return. She turned eagerly
as the door opened, and came some little way to meet him. Her
manner was strained and anxious.</p>

<p>"You are kind to come so promptly, Andr&eacute;-Louis. I have so
much to say to you. You left so hurriedly before I could even
begin. Where have you been?"</p>

<p>"To the Casa Gazzola to let them know that I am still
alive."</p>

<p>"It was what I feared. You have not been imprudent? You have
done nothing hasty or rash, Andr&eacute;-Louis?" She was
trembling.</p>

<p>His lips writhed as he answered her. "There was nothing I could
do, madame. The harm is past repairing. I could only talk. I doubt
if I impressed them."</p>

<p>He saw relief in her face.</p>

<p>"Tell me about it. Ah, but sit down, child."</p>

<p>She waved him to one of two chairs that stood by the window, and
herself took the other one. He sank down wearily, dropping hat and
whip upon the floor beside him, and turned all the misery of his
haggard eyes upon her gentle, wistful face.</p>

<p>"You saw Monsieur?" she asked him.</p>

<p>"I saw him, madame. I had a message for him from Monsieur de
Batz." Briefly he repeated what he had told the Regent. She heard
him out, a little colour creeping into her cheeks, a bitter little
smile gradually taking shape about her sensitive lips. When at last
he had done, she nodded.</p>

<p>"It was merited. All of it was merited. Although in doing what
you did in Paris you betrayed a cause, yet I cannot blame you. And
I am glad with you that you had the satisfaction of telling him.
Never think that the bitterness of it will not penetrate to his
heart, or that he will not understand how his own treachery and
disloyalty have brought this failure upon him. He is very fitly
punished."</p>

<p>"I am not so easily satisfied, madame. I doubt if any punishment
I could have visited upon him would have been enough to satisfy me
for the ruin he has wrought in wantonness."</p>

<p>"Ruin?" she echoed. She was staring at him with widening eyes.
"The ruin he has wrought?"</p>

<p>"Is that too much to call it?" He was bitter. "Can any power
undo it, or repair it?"</p>

<p>She paused before replying. Then quietly asked him, "What has
been reported to you, Andr&eacute;?"</p>

<p>"The vile truth, madame; that he made Aline his mistress; that
he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, no! That, no!" she cried, and came to her feet as she
spoke. "It is not true, my Andr&eacute;."</p>

<p>He raised his head, and looked at her with his weary eyes. "Pity
misleads you into deceiving me. I have it on the word of a witness,
and he a man of honour."</p>

<p>"You must mean Monsieur de La Guiche."</p>

<p>"How well you know. Yes, it was La Guiche who told me, without
knowing how much he was telling me; La Guiche who discovered her in
the Regent's arms, when he&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again he was interrupted. "I know, I know. Ah, wait, my poor
Andr&eacute;! Listen to me. What La Guiche reported that he had
seen is true. But all the rest, all the assumptions from it are
false. False! And you have been tortured by this dreadful belief.
My poor child!" She was beside him, her hand upon his head,
soothing, caressing, gathering to her starved mother's heart some
comfort for the comfort that she brought him. And whilst she went
on to speak, to give him the facts within her knowledge, he held
his breath and kept his body rigid.</p>

<p>"How could you have thought that your Aline is of those who
yield. Not even the belief in your death could have robbed her of
her pure strength. Long and patiently Monsieur laid siege to her.
In the end, I suppose, that patience wearied. He was required
elsewhere. They were demanding his presence in Toulon. So, to be
rid of Monsieur de Kercadiou, he sent him to Brussels on a
pretexted errand, and went that night to bear Aline company in her
loneliness. Feeling herself helpless because alone there, and
terrified by his vehemence, she suffered the embrace which Monsieur
de La Guiche surprised, and which Monsieur de La Guiche
interrupted. Wait, Andr&eacute;! Hear the end. The Regent left her
upon the insistence of Monsieur de La Guiche, who was very angry,
and, I believe, very unmeasured in his terms, wanting even in
respect to his highness. They went into another room, so that
Monsieur might hear the message of which the Marquis was the
bearer. No sooner had they gone than Aline came down to me with the
tale of what had passed. She was filled with horror and loathing of
Monsieur, and between terror of what had been and the fear of its
repetition, she implored me to keep her with me and to shelter
her." A moment Madame de Plougastel paused, and then added slowly
and solemnly: "And she did not leave my side again until two days
later, after Monsieur had departed from Hamm."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis came to his feet. He stood before her, his
eyes level with her own, his sight blurred.</p>

<p>"Madame! Madame! Is this the truth?" His tone was piteous.</p>

<p>She took his hands in hers. She spoke wistfully. "Could I
deceive you, Andr&eacute;-Louis? You know that whoever might lie to
you, I never should. Not even out of charity, my child, in such a
matter as this."</p>

<p>There were tears in his eyes. "Madame," he faltered, "you give
me life."</p>

<p>She smiled upon him with an ineffable sadness. "Then I give it
to you for the second time. And I thank God that it is in my power
to give it." She leaned forward and kissed him. "Go to your Aline,
Andr&eacute;-Louis. Go with confidence. Give no further thought to
Monsieur. You have punished him for the evil of his intentions. Be
thankful that there was no more to punish."</p>

<p>"Where is she? Aline?" he asked.</p>

<p>"At Hamm. When we left to follow the Regent to Turin, Monsieur
de Kercadiou had not yet returned from Brussels, so that she was
compelled to await him there. Besides, she had nowhere to go, poor
child. I left her money enough to suffice them for some time. Make
haste to her, Andr&eacute;-Louis."</p>

<p>He set out next day, fortified by the blessing and prayers of
the gentle lady who was his mother, and who took consolation for
the thought that perhaps she might never see him again in the
reflection that he went at last to his happiness.</p>

<p>He spared on that journey neither himself nor horseflesh. He was
well supplied with money. In addition to a bundle of assignats with
which he had paid his way in France, he had received from de Batz
at parting a belt containing fifty <i>louis</i> in gold to which he
had scarcely yet had recourse. But he had recourse to it freely
now. It went prodigally on horseflesh, and to surmount all
obstacles and smooth all difficulties.</p>

<p>Within a week, on a fair April day, he came worn and jaded, but
with his heart aglow, into the little Westphalian town on the
Lippe. He rolled almost exhausted from the saddle at the door of
the Bear Inn, and staggered across the threshold looking like the
ghost for which he was presently to be taken.</p>

<p>When the gaping landlord in answer to his questions had told him
that Monsieur de Kercadiou and his niece were above stairs,
Andr&eacute;-Louis bade him go tell the Lord of Gavrillac that a
courier had just arrived for him.</p>

<p>"Say no more than that. Do not mention my name to him, within
Mademoiselle's hearing."</p>

<p>Then he reeled to a chair and sank into it. But he was on his
feet again a few moments later when his godfather came down in
answer to the summons.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Kercadiou checked at sight of him, and changed
colour; then uttered his name in a voice that rang through the inn,
and came running to embrace him, repeating his name again and again
between tears and laughter.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Louis babbled foolishly in his godfather's
arms.</p>

<p>"It is I, monsieur my godfather. It is indeed I. I have come
back. I have done with politics. We are going farming. We are going
to my farm in Saxony. I always knew that farm would be useful to us
one day. Now let us go and find Aline, if you please."</p>

<p>But there was no need to go in quest of her. She was there
mid-way upon the stairs. Her uncle's voice pronouncing
Andr&eacute;-Louis' name had drawn her forth. Her lovely face was
piteously white, and she was trembling so violently that she could
scarcely stand.</p>

<p>At sight of her Andr&eacute;-Louis disengaged himself from the
arms of Monsieur de Kercadiou, and casting off his weariness as if
it had been a cloak, he leapt up to meet her. He came to a halt a
step below her, his upturned face on a level with her throat. She
put her arms round his neck, and drew his dark head against her
breast. Holding him so, she whispered to him, "I was waiting for
you, Andr&eacute;. I should always have been waiting for you. To
the end."</p>
