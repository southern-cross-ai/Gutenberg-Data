<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a>
</h2>

<p>SAMUEL FREEPORT was a younger son. His father made no provision
for him beyond getting him a commission in one of his late
Majesty's Regiments of Foot; for he was quite satisfied that Sam's
propensities would induce him to squander every shilling. The old
man, therefore, on leaving the world, recommended him to the care
of his brothers, who were three in number.</p>

<p>Sam had been very lucky in promotion. At the age of twenty-four
he had his company. He had given it out that he was to come in for
an enormous fortune at his father's decease, and he was not a
little disgusted when the melancholy truth was broken unto
him&mdash;namely, that he was dependent on his elder brethren, with
whom he had no sort of sympathy.</p>

<p>The only consolation that Freeport found in these circumstances
was afforded by his vanity, which prompted him to think he might
marry a dowager duchess, or some single heiress equally wealthy.
Our hero was wrong in his opinion&mdash;that he was the handsomest
man in the world. At the same time, he was what may be termed a
very good looking fellow. He stood about five feet ten, had a fine
open countenance, laughing blue eyes, and a small mouth, about
which was ever playing a very winning smile. He was a favourite
with most people, but a "pet" in his corps; for all the members,
from the colonel to the junior ensign, loved him for his good
temper, and excessively kind heart. Sam used frequently to draw
largely on his imagination, but no one ever heard him say an
ill-natured word against any man breathing. The sole object of his
invention was the amusement of those who listened to his stories.
In proportion to his warmth of heart he had a coolness of
disposition; which in other men would have amounted to impudence;
but in Sam Freeport it was wit.</p>

<p>At the time when he heard of his father's death, the corps was
ordered to march from Huddersfield to York, and in the month of
December entered that ancient city, at about four o'clock in the
afternoon, the band playing vigorously:--</p>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:10%">"Oh! they marched through the town,<br>
With their banners so gay."</p>
<br>

<p>Sam gave a boy sixpence to show him the way to the White Horse.
He called for the landlord, and inquired whether the Earl of
Dunburley was staying there. He was answered in the negative. Sam
expressed his surprise, as he said his lordship told him he would
certainly be there on the 18th. The landlord suggested that
something might have interfered with his lordship's intentions. Sam
said it was very likely, and then inquired if anything was going on
in York.</p>

<p>"Why no, sir, nothing particular; and until the assize ball, I
take it, we shall not have much gaiety. The Newshams give an
evening party to-night, to which I believe everybody is
invited."</p>

<p>"Who is Newsham?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Newsham, sir, is our leading attorney, and transacts the
business of all the first men in the county."</p>

<p>"I wonder if he could give me any intelligence of my friend,
Lord Dunburley?"</p>

<p>"It is not at all improbable, sir."</p>

<p>"Where does he live? Can I get a chaise here?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir."</p>

<p>A chaise was ordered, and Sam Freeport was conveyed to the house
of Mr. Newsham, "the leading attorney."</p>

<p>After apologizing for calling at such an hour, Sam Freeport said
he wished to consult Mr. Newsham on a matter of business; that he
had some twenty thousand pounds in the funds, which he wished to
draw out, and invest at a more profitable rate of
interest&mdash;for instance, upon mortgage of landed property in
Yorkshire.</p>

<p>Mr. Newsham remarked that the matter could be very easily
effected, and Sam gave him the necessary instructions for a power
of attorney. He then inquired after his friend the Earl of
Dunburley, and affected a mysterious astonishment when informed
that his lordship had gone upon the continent.</p>

<p>"Which is the first inn in York, Mr. Newsham?"</p>

<p>"The White Horse!"</p>

<p>"Thank you," returned Sam, looking at his watch. "I fear I am
too late for mess, and must&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am about to dine, and if you will give me the pleasure of
your company, I shall be delighted!"</p>

<p>Sam said, "You are very kind; really&mdash;I&mdash;shall have
much pleasure."</p>

<p>Mr. Newsham and Sam dined tête-à-tête. Mrs. Newsham and her four
daughters had dined at half-past two, and had been hard at work
since that hour in making preparations for the forthcoming gaiety.
By eight o'clock Sam had disposed of more than one bottle of very
superior Madeira, which had been presented to his host by a client
of whom he was not a little proud.</p>

<p>It was a peculiarity of Freeport that he discarded all sorts of
formality and stiffness on very short acquaintance, and when his
host broke to him that they had a party at which he hoped Sam would
be present, Sam replied, "My dear fellow, Newsham, it will delight
me. I like your company and conversation, and I'd go to the other
end of the world to serve you."</p>

<p>This, coming from a man who had twenty thousand pounds in the
funds, and who was for investing it on mortgage, touched Newsham's
heart, and made him respond in these words&mdash;"Captain Freeport,
I not only respect you as the friend of Lord Dunburley, but I
regard you with esteem for your inherent good qualities."</p>

<p>"Give me your hand," said Sam. (Newsham gave it.) "Never mind my
good qualities and Dunburley; but if you love me, call me Captain
Freeport no longer, but simply Sam."</p>

<p>A note, or rather a memorandum, came in to Mr. N. from his wife.
It ran thus:&mdash;"It is now past nine, and there are you sitting,
telling those stupid stories of yours, and never thinking that
people are coming, and that room will be wanted for the coffee.
When <i>are</i> we to expect you to leave that room?"</p>

<p>Newsham wrote in pencil,&mdash;"Don't be angry, love; I'll come
presently. Captain Freeport, of the&mdash;&mdash;Foot (a man of
large fortune), is with me on business."</p>

<p>Sam saw there was a domestic screw loose, and proposed going
home to dress. Newsham said, "Your quarters are at some distance.
You will do very well as you are." But Sam was too vain to yield to
this, and left his host for the purpose of attiring himself in his
uniform.</p>

<p>Sam had a faithful servant, named Blew, who always awaited his
master's coming, no matter at what hour. As soon as Sam's voice was
heard, the candles were lighted, and everything in readiness.
Orders were given to get out the articles of dress which Sam
required; and while Blew was engaged in obeying the mandate, Sam
pored over his MS. book of complimentary quotations, culled from
the British poets of all times. He didn't know a soul of the party
to which he was going, and therefore looked for something as
general as possible. The following struck him as <i>"very
good,"</i> and he applied himself to commit it to
memory:&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:10%">"Oh, were those eyes in heav'n<br>
They'd through the starry region shine so bright<br>
That birds would sing, and think it was the morn."</p>
<br>

<p>Sam had repeated these verses at least eighteen times; but as he
pulled on his gloves, he thought it would be right to test his
accuracy, and therefore called on Blew to take the book and
<i>hear</i> him.</p>

<p>"Oh were those eyes in heaven, the birds would chirp and swear
it's morning."</p>

<p>"Not exactly, sir," said Blew; "you've missed the middle
line."</p>

<p>"What middle line?"</p>

<p>"They'd through the starry region shine so bright."</p>

<p>"What's the use of the starry region? They're much better
without it."</p>

<p>"So <i>I</i> should say, sir; but it is here in the book."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind that. What is it? 'O were the birds in heaven,
they'd swear those eyes'&mdash;What is it?"</p>

<p>Blew repeated&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:10%">"Oh, were those eyes in heaven,<br>
The birds would sing, and think it was the morn."</p>
<br>

<p>"I've left out the middle line, sir."</p>

<p>"Let us have another look at the book," said Sam. "There, now I
have it. Tell Mr. Harroway I have dined out, and gone to a
ball."</p>

<p>The air had had some effect upon Freeport, and he felt as though
some of Mr. Newsham's Madeira had got into the heels of his boots:
not that he was intoxicated, or thereto approaching. His capacity
for wine was enormous, and he had tested it too frequently to admit
of his yielding to the strongest of grape juice. With his mental
faculties quite clear, and his body perfectly erect, he experienced
merely a slight to-and-fro movement from the knees downwards.</p>

<p>Mr. Newsham stood near the door of the dancing-room to receive
his warm-hearted acquaintance. Freeport was now introduced to the
lady of the house and her daughters&mdash;four very good looking
girls, who were all dressed exactly alike.</p>

<p>There was a rich and comfortable look about the abode of the
leading attorney, and Sam suddenly made up his mind to be on very
good terms with the family, as long as the corps was quartered in
York.</p>

<p>The girls were not handsome, nor were they what is termed
"highly accomplished." But they were famed for feats of
horsewomanship, and their manners were somewhat masculine, and
strikingly in contrast with their graceful and very feminine
appearance. Their conversation, too, was peculiar. It partook so
much of out-door matters.</p>

<p>It was Anne Newsham's birth-day. Anne was the youngest but one.
Freeport solicited her to dance with him. She rose abruptly from
the ottoman, and took his arm.</p>

<p>"How do you like York?" said Anne, beginning the
conversation.</p>

<p>"I have hardly had an opportunity of judging yet: but the little
I have seen has made a very favourable impression," replied Sam,
sweetly.</p>

<p>"That's all gammon and spinach," observed his partner, with an
honest laugh.</p>

<p>"I assure you it is a fact," urged Sam, not a little taken
aback.</p>

<p>"Do you intend to join the hunt, Captain Freeport?"</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly."</p>

<p>"That's right, and get all your friends to do the like. We shall
have a noble meeting this year, I hope."</p>

<p>"Do you take much interest in these matters?"</p>

<p>"Did not the governor tell you that we girls have been in at the
death of every fox that has been killed near this for the last four
years?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Then that's a wonder; for he tells every one."</p>

<p>It was impossible to know, and not to like the Misses Newsham,
albeit they were such very bold girls and said such very odd
things. Sam was charmed with Anne, and when the dance was over he
lingered by her chair, and talked about "the chase."</p>

<p>Before Sam left her he took an opportunity of getting rid of his
quotation,</p>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:10%">"Oh were those eyes in heaven,<br>
The birds would sing, and think it was the morn."</p>
<br>

<p>"More fools they," said Anne, looking him full in the face, and
squinting hideously. "The birds of the air are not green enough for
that, Captain Freeport."</p>

<p>Sam laughed loudly, and when Anne looked straight again, he felt
a decided affection for her.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you will find York a very dull place, Captain
Freeport," observed the hostess.</p>

<p>"Were it ever so dull," said Sam, "your contribution to the
society would enliven it."</p>

<p>"The girls are very lively, certainly," conceded Mrs. Newsham.
"But the place itself&mdash;I suspect you will not like the place.
It is so fearfully quiet&mdash;too much so for young people."</p>

<p>"I shall like it all the better for that," replied Sam, readily.
"I am very fond of sociality, but I cannot say I enjoy much gaiety
and racket."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Newsham, "that's just what I feel. A few
friends and a merry laugh: but the racket of continual parties is
to me past all endurance."</p>

<p>"You are quite right," quoth Freeport. "If you know people, know
'em well; and if you can't know 'em well, why don't know 'em at
all. That's my principle."</p>

<p>"And so it is mine," said Mrs. Newsham.</p>

<p>"And if that principle were acted up to," added Sam, "there
would no longer be any truth in the saying, that 'you may have a
church full of acquaintances, but the pulpit will hold all your
friends.'"</p>

<p>Mrs. Newsham was approached by a very important personage, of
about forty-five.</p>

<p>Freeport took the opportunity of getting away, and making up to
Newsham, who had just heard, so he said, of a splendid opportunity
of investing capital. By the time this little matter was talked
over, it was twelve o'clock, and supper was announced to be on
table.</p>

<p>Before Freeport left the house, Mrs. Newsham asked Sam to take
luncheon with them on the following day. The reader will readily
imagine he did not refuse.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a>
</h2>

<p>"WHERE were you last night, Sam?" asked Mr. Harroway.</p>

<p>"At an evening party," was the reply. "Managed it
beautifully."</p>

<p>"But <i>where</i> were you?"</p>

<p>"That's another matter. By and bye I'll introduce you, if you
behave yourself. Very nice family indeed. Hospitable
father,&mdash;sensible mother,&mdash;and the jolliest girls I ever
met in the whole course of my life, and no brother. By the bye,
Harroway, as I told one of the girls I had the best stud in the
kingdom, I wish you would let me act as owner of one or two of your
best animals&mdash;the chesnut and the grey for instance."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Harroway; "but don't forget they are
mine&mdash;don't in an enthusiastic moment make a present of them,
as you did by Jemmy Linton's family teapot."</p>

<p>"Never fear!" said Sam. "I'll buy a brace of good beasts as soon
as my credit is well-established in this place; but in the meantime
I must show myself off on yours; and if it would not make any great
difference to you, I should like to own your Stanhope."</p>

<p>"Very well, Sam; anything you like."</p>

<p>"I'll introduce you the day after to-morrow. I can't do so
before then, because I am establishing a little affair, and you
might be in the way. Do you see, Harroway? Fine girl&mdash;noble
spirit&mdash;and money doubtless."</p>

<p>Harroway laughed, and Sam donned a very becoming "Mufty," in
spite of a positive order that no officer should appear in public,
except in uniform. The colonel was a very tight hand; but he had
grown tired of talking to Freeport about regimental matters, and in
consequence, Sam enjoyed a much envied impunity. It was generally
said of Freeport that he was the best fellow, but the worst officer
in the British army.</p>

<p>With a complacent smile, Sam Freeport mounted the valuable grey
of his obliging chum, Lieut. Harroway, who was worth some six
thousand a year. Harroway's groom followed Sam on the chesnut, to
the door of Mr. Newsham's house, where our hero dismounted. The
girls, from the drawing-room windows, admired the beautiful
creatures in the street, as they were led up and down by the
groom.</p>

<p>Mr. Newsham had risen very early and prepared the power of
attorney; but Sam said he had received letters from London, which
would delay the execution till somebody or other's formal consent
was obtained to his selling out his property in the stocks. The
girls seemed glad to see Sam, and their mother greeted him very
warmly. At the suggestion of Anne, the horses were sent round to
the stable.</p>

<p>The time passed rapidly away, and it was now three o'clock. The
girls were going to ride that evening, and Sam offered to escort
them. His offer was accepted, and at four the cavalcade moved out
of the old city. Anne Newsham, at Sam's special request, rode the
grey, and he took the chesnut. As soon as they were outside the
walls, Anne Newsham called out to her eldest sister, "Jessie, lead
the way across country."</p>

<p>"Come along!" cried Jessie, and putting her horse at a ditch,
she cleared it, and galloped across a long field, towards a
five-barred gate in the corner. Jessie was followed by Jane and
Maria. Anne wished to ride in company with Freeport, and "waited"
on him. Sam was an extremely bad horseman in a field, and he funked
the ditch; but he was ashamed to show his fear, and dashed at the
leap like a man. The chesnut took it, but Sam came on the animal's
shoulder. Anne "lifted" the grey over, and patted him on the neck
as soon as the leap was cleared.</p>

<p>"Here's a pretty business," said Sam to himself as they
approached the five-barred gate, and saw the other girls topping
it. Anne again reined in to wait on Freeport. Sam curbed up the
chesnut, and wouldn't let him take the gate; at the same time he
called him "an obstinate rascal" for not doing so.</p>

<p>"He will follow me," cried Anne, and she put the grey over the
gate with the most perfect ease imaginable.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" src=
"1600601h-images/IMAGE-1.jpg"><br>
<br>
</p>

<p>"If I break my neck, here goes," muttered Sam. He gave the eager
steed his head, and was in the next field instanter. Sam was very
nearly off: but he explained this by saying that "the brute bucked
it."</p>

<p>"I love a Buck Jumper," cried Anne, her cheeks glowing, and her
eyes sparkling with excitement, as they galloped side by
side&mdash;towards a hedge, which the other girls were making
for.</p>

<p>"I'm blowed if I like any jumper at all," thought Sam, "and if I
get safe out of this, you'll not catch me coming cross-country
again."</p>

<p>The hedge was a teazer, and Anne wished to show Sam her style of
riding. "Yohicks!" she cried, as the grey leapt with his light
burden, and cleared it gallantly. The chesnut followed, Sam holding
like grim death; but he was thrown, and with difficulty clung to
the reins, and prevented the chesnut leaving him to walk. Anne
Newsham roared with laughter, while she observed, "you are not much
hurt."</p>

<p>"Yes I am though," responded Sam. "He stamped upon me." (This
was not true, but Sam had had enough of jumping, and didn't feel
inclined for any more.)</p>

<p>"Let us take to the road," suggested Sam.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Anne. "Get up&mdash;I'll show you the
way."</p>

<p>Freeport got up, and they jogged on together. There was
something very captivating about Anne Newsham's voice; and she was
a great talker.</p>

<p>"I envy you this dear horse," said Anne, as she leapt him out of
the field she had just leapt him into.</p>

<p>"Do you?" said Sam; "then he is yours."</p>

<p>"No, no, Captain Freeport. I would not deprive you of him."</p>

<p>"But you shall," urged Sam&mdash;"you shall give me yours in
exchange."</p>

<p>"My horse is not so valuable a creature as this, but a very good
one, and I love him dearly. No, no, Captain Freeport&mdash;keep
your grey. If I should ask you to lend him to me for the next stag
hunt I know you wont refuse."</p>

<p>"Refuse!" exclaimed Sam. "If you asked me to cut the throats of
the pair of 'em I'd do it this moment."</p>

<p>"Are you sincere?" asked Anne.</p>

<p>"Sincere!" replied Sam. "Just pull up, and I'll get off and go
down on my knees and swear it."</p>

<p>The other girls had left Sam and Anne a long way behind, and
reached home half an hour before them. Sam made out that he was
very much bruised, and set up all sorts of wry faces when he got
into the house. He contrived, however, to eat a very hearty dinner,
and to enjoy the walnuts which Anne cracked for him when they all
drew their chairs round the fire, and Newsham filled the glasses
with the choice Madeira.</p>

<p>Sam became warmed with the wine, he felt determined to effect an
exchange by giving Anne the grey for her own riding horse. She
declined hearing of such a thing at first, but inasmuch as he
became importunate, she observed, "Well, Captain Freeport, as you
insist on a swap, of course I can't hold out any longer. I'll send
you Mazeppa to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"Mazeppa! Why, that's the name of the grey," said Sam.</p>

<p>"How very odd!" ejaculated Anne and all her sisters.</p>

<p>Now, the horse's name was not Mazeppa, but Gaffer Grey; and
under that name he had won several steeple chases; but it pleased
Sam to have a coincidence at the sacrifice of fact.</p>

<p>It was nearly eleven o'clock before Sam Freeport returned to his
quarters. Harroway was not there, and Sam smoked a solitary
cheroot, and talked to Anne Newsham, in his imagination,
preparatory to turning in for the night.</p>

<p>"I say, Sam&mdash;here's a very nice bit of horseflesh come here
for you," said Harroway, next morning, shaking by the shoulder the
sleeping Sam. "Where did you pick him up?"</p>

<p>"Bit of what?" said Sam, rubbing his eyes with his forefinger
knuckles.</p>

<p>"Horseflesh."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's some mistake; it is not for me. What a fellow you are,
to come and cruelly disturb a man in the middle of a delightful
dream."</p>

<p>"How could I tell what you were dreaming about? By the bye, is
it true that you put a lassie upon the grey yesterday, and that the
grey bolted with her?"</p>

<p>This brought to Sam's recollection that the "bit of horseflesh"
was intended for him. He looked Harroway full in the face, and then
roared with laughter at his own thoughts.</p>

<p>"Is it a very nice animal that has come for me?" inquired
Sam.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Harroway; "a very nice animal indeed."</p>

<p>"What's his colour?"</p>

<p>"Bay, with black points."</p>

<p>"What's his height? Is he equal to my weight?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But you don't mean to say you have been such a fool as to
buy a horse without seeing him&mdash;especially in Yorkshire?"</p>

<p>"I bought him on description."</p>

<p>"Then you deserve to be taken in."</p>

<p>"What's the animal worth?"</p>

<p>"Prom £85 to £100. What did you give for him?"</p>

<p>"More than that. By Jove! George, I am afraid we have been
done."</p>

<p>"Don't say <i>'we,'</i> Sam, for you can't call that horse a
regimental purchase, you know."</p>

<p>"No," laughed Sam. "It's a regular individual stick, George. It
can't be helped. There's no use in crying over spilt milk, is
there?"</p>

<p>"No!&mdash;but what did you pay for him?"</p>

<p>"You say he is not worth more than £100."</p>

<p>"Not a stiver more."</p>

<p>"Then, by Jove, George, I am ashamed to tell you."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because you'll repeat it, and I'll get laughed at. I'll impart
it in confidence, if you like,&mdash;on your giving me your word
and honour as a gentleman you will never mention the transaction to
a soul breathing."</p>

<p>"On my word and honour, Sam, I never will."</p>

<p>"Then, my dear George, for that little bit of horseflesh I
swapped your grey to a girl&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The devil you did!" exclaimed Harroway, fearfully put out, for
the horse had several engagements, and his sporting owner was very
proud of him&mdash;"Then I'll be hanged, Sam, if I allow him to
go."</p>

<p>"Oh; you must, George. Consider, my dear sub, your captain's
honour is at stake. Would you have me ruined for the sake of a
horse?"</p>

<p>"I declare, Freeport," said Harroway, emphatically, "that you
are, without exception, the greatest fool in the kingdom, where
women are concerned."</p>

<p>"It's all very true, George. But what can a man do&mdash;when a
nice girl admires your horse, and pats it on the neck, and calls it
a sweet creature."</p>

<p>"Why, let her admire it."</p>

<p>"But suppose you happen to know, she admires you, as well as the
horse?"</p>

<p>"Never mind&mdash;stick to your property."</p>

<p>"But I can't, George."</p>

<p>"Then I wish to heaven you'd stick to other people's."</p>

<p>Freeport roared with laughter, and Harroway, in supreme disgust,
walked up and down the room, muttering, "It serves me right!"</p>

<p>"What a flinty-hearted fellow you are, to be sure!" said Sam. "I
don't think you know what a pleasing sensibility means! Come now,
say candidly, had you ever a single tender emotion?"</p>

<p>The question made Harroway laugh, notwithstanding he was very
much provoked.</p>

<p>"Look here!" said Sam, stretching forth his hand. "Put down the
value of the grey against me in your pocket-book&mdash;value him at
what you like. I shall marry an heiress one of these days, and then
I'll pay you the amount, and you shall have interest at 8 per cent,
out of my pay. You have got lots of money, and are always beating
your brains to now how to invest it. You ought to look on this as a
deuced lucky transaction. You never got such a high rate of
interest in your life."</p>

<p>"Can't you get off the swap?"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't ask such a thing for the world&mdash;I'd rather pay
you a thousand pounds for the horse."</p>

<p>"I hope the chesnut is safe," said Harroway, in a doubting
tone.</p>

<p>"Quite. Let me see&mdash;yes&mdash;I stuck to the
chesnut&mdash;that is to say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I didn't dispose of him, or swap him."</p>

<p>"Then you don't take him out any more&mdash;recollect that."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I'll never trust myself again, George&mdash;I shall
tell the girls I have sold you the chesnut because he bucked the
hedge and spilt me."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Sam?"</p>

<p>"Why the fact of the matter is this," began Sam&mdash;and he
detailed all that took place on the day previous. Harroway, on
hearing of his fall, was convulsed with laughter, and by the time
Sam had finished, his sub's chagrin at losing Gaffer Grey was
almost extinct. "Now then," ejaculated Sam; "I'll get up, have
breakfast&mdash;and about half after twelve we will go together and
visit the girls, George."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a>
</h2>

<p>GEORGE HARROWAY, was duly presented to Mrs. Newsham and her
daughters, by Sam Freeport. The exchange of horses that had taken
place between Anne and Sam was soon brought in as a topic of
conversation.</p>

<p>"Don't you think Captain Freeport was rather green, Mr.
Harroway?" asked Anne.</p>

<p>"That's a charming little animal of yours which my friend now
possesses," replied Harroway.</p>

<p>"I would not part with him for all the horses in the county,"
said Sam; "I never rode such an easy graceful creature in the whole
course of my existence."</p>

<p>"Why, you have never been upon his back yet," observed
Harroway.</p>

<p>There was a general laugh against Freeport, in which he could
not help joining.</p>

<p>"You are fond of the chase, I understand?" said Harroway to
Anne.</p>

<p>"Yes, we are all fond of it," she replied.</p>

<p>"I am rejoiced to hear that; as we shall meet in the field.
Captain Freeport has been good enough to sell me his chesnut, and
he is almost as good as your grey."</p>

<p>"We shall see in a day or two," said Anne. "The hounds meet on
Thursday. Captain Freeport, I hope to see you on Mazeppa."</p>

<p>"Most assuredly," said Sam. "Who'd be absent?"</p>

<p>* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>"Are they not jolly girls, George?" inquired Freeport, when they
got into the street.</p>

<p>"Very," was the laconic reply. "Anne is a remarkably fine
girl."</p>

<p>"And she's gone, sir!"</p>

<p>"How do you mean, gone?"</p>

<p>"Why, she's head over ears in love with me, sir. The governor is
a wealthy man, I fancy; but then there are four of 'em, and people
have a dislike to divide their property during lifetime. I am
afraid I can't afford to marry her, George: I wish I could. No,
sir, I must have an heiress. Nothing short of an heiress will do
for a man in my circumstances."</p>

<p>At this moment a brass plate bearing the words, "BLINK,
SURGEON," in large letters, met Freeport's eye. "What a queer
name?" he exclaimed. "I wonder what sort of a fellow Blink is,
George? Blink! Blink! I have a curiosity to see Blink. I'll bet you
a crown I will describe Blink nearer than you do."</p>

<p>"Done!" cried Harroway.</p>

<p>"How are we to decide it?" asked Harroway.</p>

<p>"That's easily done," said Sam. "I can be sick, and go to
consult him. Come along!"</p>

<p>Freeport told Harroway to rap at the door, and keep from
laughing.</p>

<p>Blink was a good looking, well made young man, who had just
commenced practice. He was politeness itself: and he listened to
Sam's symptoms with a very patient ear.</p>

<p>"When did the pain first come on?" said Blink.</p>

<p>"About a week ago," said the patient, in a feeble voice. "Our
doctor pronounced it to be liver; but I am certain it is no such
thing."</p>

<p>"Decidedly not liver," said Blink&mdash;"Have you any difficulty
of breathing!"</p>

<p>"Very considerable." (Sam gasped.)</p>

<p>"How is the appetite?"</p>

<p>"None at all. Can't touch a thing. I sicken at the sight of
food."</p>

<p>"Have you any depression of spirits?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;especially as the evening approaches." (Sam looked
wretchedly sorrowful.)</p>

<p>Blink promised to send Sam a draught that would do him good; and
to call upon him next day. Sam then informed George Harroway, in a
broken tone of voice&mdash;loud enough for Blink to hear
him&mdash;that he had forgotten his purse, and George must give
Blink a guinea.</p>

<p>Harroway felt compelled to pay Blink, and having done so, he led
Sam Freeport out of the room, at a snail's pace.</p>

<p>"That's a drawn bet, George," said Sam, as soon as they got a
short distance from Blink's door.</p>

<p>"And I suppose I may say the same of my one pound one? You are
the most, expensive companion that ever lived, Sam"</p>

<p>"I never knew a fellow who cared so much about money. What's the
use of your wealth to you, if you don't enjoy it?"</p>

<p>"Now then, you have saddled yourself with a
doctor&mdash;<i>I'm</i> not going to pay him any more."</p>

<p>"How 'saddled?' Can't I say his one dose cured me, and I feel as
well as ever I did in my life?"</p>

<p>Blink thought it a very great compliment, that an officer, who
had two doctors in his regiment, ready to give advice gratis,
should come to consult him in a case of difficulty. He looked upon
this as a good sign; and in order that it might be made the most
of, Blink paid a round of visits, and incidentally introduced the
circumstance to every one whom he saw. Amongst other friends, on
whom Blink called, were the Newshams. He did not see the ladies,
but he mentioned Freeport's name to Newsham, and the dreadful state
of health&mdash;in short, precarious condition in which he then
was. Newsham was astounded, as well he might be. The inquiries
made, and the replies given, placed it beyond all doubt that Sam
was Blink's Freeport, even if there were another in the regiment of
that name.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Newsham returned, her husband said, "You will be very
sorry to hear that Captain Freeport is in a very precarious
condition."</p>

<p><i>"What?"</i> exclaimed Anne, loudly.</p>

<p>"How do you mean?" said Mrs. Newsham.</p>

<p>"He was here not an hour ago," said Jessie.</p>

<p>"And seemed very well," added Jane.</p>

<p>"No accident, I hope!" said Maria.</p>

<p>"When you have done conjecturing," said Newsham, "I'll enlighten
you. But with so many people all talking at once, it is quite
impossible to make oneself heard."</p>

<p>Newsham then narrated the particulars of his interview with
Blink.</p>

<p>"If he is in Blink's hands," said Anne, "he certainly is in a
very precarious state. What could have induced him to go to
Blink?"</p>

<p>"Blink is not very bright," remarked Newsham.</p>

<p>"Bright?" said Mrs. Newsham. "No, I should think he was
not?"</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Newsham, "if he has made a will, and arranged
all his affairs?"</p>

<p>Anne was horrified at the idea. And she ran up stairs, and wrote
to Freeport:&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:5%"><i>"Saturday.</i><br>
<br>
"MY DEAR SIR,&mdash;I am very sorry to hear of your sudden illness.
Take my advice and have nothing to say to Blink. He is the greatest
fool I ever met in my life. I wouldn't trust a cat to his judgment.
Now <i>pray</i> get rid of him. You have no idea how surprised we
were to hear of this. I am afraid you suffered more from your fall
than you were willing to confess.<br>
<br>
"Believe me, very sincerely,<br>
<br>
"ANNE NEWSHAM."</p>
<br>

<p>Sam and Harroway had just returned from a billiard room, when
this note was put into the former's hand.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you, George, she loved me?" said Sam, handing the
note to Harroway. "Look at her anxiety when she hears I am
ill."</p>

<p>Harroway was vastly amused when he perused Anne Newsham's
favour, and the recollection of the scene with Blink made his sides
to shake with laughter.</p>

<p>"What am I to say, George?" asked Sam. "How shall I reply to the
dear girl's epistle?'"</p>

<p>"Tell her the truth," replied Harroway. "Say it was a lark.
She'll enjoy it. For evidently Blink is no favourite of hers."</p>

<p>"Do you think I am a fool, George?" responded Freeport. "No, no.
If I were to tell the truth, the old governor would fancy that my
£20,000 in the funds was all moonshine, and that our acquaintance
originated in one of those larks. That'll never do, George."</p>

<p>"Here goes," said Sam. "I'll write her a letter which will
entail a lengthy correspondence; and there's nothing on earth so
delightful as writing to, and hearing from, a girl that you really
like&mdash;unless it be talking to her."</p>

<p>Sam then wrote as follows, and read out to Harroway as he
proceeded.</p>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:5%">"<i>Saturday.</i><br>
<br>
"MY DEAR MISS ANNE NEWSHAM,<br>
<br>
Your note has occasioned in me surprise and delight. Surprise that
you should hear I am ill, delight that my supposed sufferings
should awaken your sympathy. I am happy to say that I never felt
better in the whole course of my life.<br>
<br>
"I shall see you in church to-morrow morning, but as we have to
walk there and back like so many children, I shall not be able to
speak to you before noon.<br>
<br>
"With regards and compliments to Mrs. Newsham, believe me very
sincerely yours,<br>
<br>
"S. FREEPORT."</p>
<br>

<p>It was nearly nine, when from his dressing-room window George
Harroway espied Blink, asking questions of a sergeant, evidently as
to the whereabouts of Captain Freeport's quarters.</p>

<p>"Sam! Sam!" roared Harroway, "here's Blink, by all that's
beautiful!"</p>

<p>"Blew!" cried out Sam. "Mind if the doctor asks you how I am
this morning, say I'm as right as a trivet. The medicine was
magic."</p>

<p>"Faith, I will, sir," said Blew.</p>

<p>"There's a step on the stair. Show him in, Blew," said Sam.</p>

<p>Blew met Blink on the landing. Sure enough he put the very
question which the foxy Freeport anticipated, and he received the
prepared answer.</p>

<p>"How are you, Mr. Blink?" said Sam. "Sit down; take a chair, and
a cup of coffee&mdash;and a weed."</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you so much better," said Blink.</p>

<p>"Better!" cried Sam; "I never was so astonished in my life. I
took the draught last night, went to bed at eight o'clock, and
slept like a top till five this morning, and awoke feeling strong
and hungry; and if you'll stay till breakfast, which is on the very
point of coming on table, you'll see me make away with half a dish
of beefsteaks."</p>

<p>"It was witchcraft," said Harroway.</p>

<p>"It was <i>some</i> craft or other," continued Sam. "Here's a
man one day not fit to crawl, and the next in robust health, and
able to walk a mile and a half. What system do you call that,
Blink? Curing a man slick off with one dose&mdash;Hom&#339;opathy,
or what?"</p>

<p>"Oh dear, no! The Hom&#339;opathic system is the reverse of my
system."</p>

<p>"What! Do you mean to say the Hom&#339;opathic system
<i>kills</i> a fellow the first dose? By Jove, what a system!
Harroway, do you hear that? Here are the steaks, hissing hot.
Blink, a steak?"</p>

<p>Blink drew his chair to the table. He had already breakfasted;
but the gravy and Harvey sauce looked so tempting he could not
refuse.</p>

<p>"How the deuce did you manage it?" said Sam, eating and talking
as fast as possible.</p>

<p>"What?" asked Blink.</p>

<p>"To cure me in that extraordinary way."</p>

<p>"I knew what was the matter with you," responded Blink, "the
moment I looked into your eye."</p>

<p>"The deuce you did! What&mdash;was there a greenish hue spread
over the surface of the pupil? You are sure it was not the
liver?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure."</p>

<p>"Well, what was it?"</p>

<p>"Why, it's an entirely new disease."</p>

<p>"Well, <i>but what?</i> I think a man has every right to know
what has been the matter with him."</p>

<p>"It was fever in the gizzard."</p>

<p>This conversation was more than Harroway could listen to without
laughing, so he made a hasty retreat to the next room.</p>

<p>"Have you got out a patent for that medicine?" asked Sam.</p>

<p>"No, but I mean to do so."</p>

<p>"And I'd lose no time, if I were you. I'll give you a
certificate of the effect it had on me. But there's one thing; I
should not like you to mention that I have consulted you, as our
doctors would be jealous. You must know what jealous fellows all
professional men are!"</p>

<p>Blink agreed to maintain silence, and shortly after took his
departure.</p>

<p>Freeport got ready for church, and was on the point of going
down stairs, when an enormous Newfoundland dog, called "Sailor,"
the property of Harroway, jumped up, and placed his dirty paws on
the breast of Sam's jacket.</p>

<p>"Here's a business," said Sam. "Look here&mdash;d&mdash;&mdash;n
the dog&mdash;I can't go to church in this condition; and the
hooking and eyeing of this affair is a matter of twenty minutes
<i>at least.</i>"</p>

<p>"Come as you are," said Harroway. "Nobody will take notice. It
will be dry before we get to church. Come along."</p>

<p>"The brute ought to be taught better manners," said Sam. "He
ought to be cured of these tricks by a single dose. He's got fever
in the gizzard, George. Let's give him Blink's specific. Blew,
bring the bottle!"</p>

<p>Harroway was curious to see the effect the medicine would have
upon the animal, and therefore made no objection to Freeport's
administering it, as he did through the wine funnel. They then
marched to church with the regiment.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" src=

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHATTER_IV" id="CHATTER_IV">CHATTER IV.</a>
</h2>

<p>ON returning from church, George Harroway went to luncheon with
the colonel, and Sam Freeport sought his own rooms preparatory to
going down to see the Newshams. He was met at the entrance to his
quarters by Blew, who said, "This is a fearful business, sir; I
don't know what Mr. Harroway will say."</p>

<p>"What's the matter <i>now?</i>" inquired Sam.</p>

<p>"Sailor's a corpse, sir!"</p>

<p>"A what?"</p>

<p>"A dead corpse&mdash;without a particle of life in it. That
physic must have been a strong poison, sir!"</p>

<p>Sam stood, and became very pale.</p>

<p>"You had not been gone five minutes, sir," said Blew, "before
the poor creature laid down and rolled in the agonies of spasms;
but in less than an hour his sufferings were ended, for he died on
the hearth-rug before the fire, and there he lies now, till Mr.
Harroway sees him, and orders him decent burial. If the dog was
analyzed, I am pretty sure he'd be found to contain poison."</p>

<p>Freeport went upstairs, and sure enough there was poor Sailor,
stretched out in death. Sam was extremely annoyed; for the dog was
a great favourite with himself as well as his chum.</p>

<p>"Go, and fetch Dr. Blink," said Sam to Blew, describing the
street, and the house, and the brass plate. "Run! say I have got a
relapse."</p>

<p>Blink was not long in responding to the call. He brought with
him another draught, which he hoped to administer to the patient;
for he carried it in his hand into the room.</p>

<p>"You are a pretty fellow to make up medicines!" said Sam, half
laughing and half annoyed. "Here is a work of desolation for you."
(He pointed to the dog). "I wouldn't have taken a hundred guineas
for him; and here you go and settle him with one dose. What's that,
<i>another</i> in your hand?"</p>

<p>Blink was naturally taken all aback.</p>

<p>"The fact is this," said Sam; "I had a suspicion of your
physic&mdash;a sort of presentiment, and I didn't take it. After
you left this I gave it to that dog; and when we returned from
church, the dog was found dead."</p>

<p>Blink wanted to laugh it off; but Sam said, "Now, look here."
(He took the phial from Blink's hand.) "Is this from the same
bottle?"</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<p>"Then if I give it to a dog, and he dies within half an hour,
will you be satisfied this is <i>poison?</i>"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Why, because what would poison a dog wouldn't poison a
man."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;a dog as big as that? Look at his size."</p>

<p>"Its the formation of the stomach."</p>

<p>"Well, will <i>you</i> consent to take a couple of table
spoonsful of the mixture?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, because I have no fever in the gizzard. And that, of
course, accounts for the death of the dog. The medicine was
intended to act on a diseased gizzard. The dog's gizzard probably
is in good order; and, if so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The medicine would stick in it, and kill him, eh?"</p>

<p>"You had better have the dog analyzed, sir, by the
assistant-surgeon, sir," suggested Blew.</p>

<p>This threw Blink in a state of excitement and alarm. He kept his
prussic acid near one of the medicines which formed this draught;
and it was just possible that he had made the mistake, as the two
were of the same colour and appearance. So it turned out. Blink
begged Sam not to mention the circumstance, as it would be his
ruin; and Sam not only promised him to be silent, but he made
Harroway make a similar promise, before he would let him into the
particulars of the dog's demise.</p>

<p>"There's a fatality, Sam, hanging over all your acts in York,"
said Harroway. "I mean as far as I am concerned."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"Why, in the course of three days, you have deprived me of my
best horse, and made me pay one guinea for the destruction of my
favourite dog."</p>

<p>"You draw such gloomy pictures of life," said Sam, "that you
make me quite melancholy. Here have I introduced you to a most
amiable and agreeable family, and this summing up of your losses is
the ungrateful return."</p>

<p>Harroway reproached himself, as he looked in Sam's good humoured
and benevolent face, and slapping him on the back he observed:
"Well, never mind, old boy."</p>

<p>"George," said Sam, "you could do me a very great favour."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Why, keep away from the hunt to-morrow morning. You can easily
say we have drills and parades."</p>

<p>"Why should I do that?"</p>

<p>"Because I cannot manage this jumping business, and it will look
so odd if you go and I stay away. I cannot stick on a beast's back
when he leaps."</p>

<p>"You have not practised, Sam; that's the reason. Stick your
knees well in, keep your hands well down, and throw yourself back
as soon as the horse springs, and it is as easy as cribbage."</p>

<p>"I don't mind being scratched and bruised; but I funk my neck,
George."</p>

<p>"Nonsense. Join the field. That little horse will carry you
beautifully. He looks a most pluckey little animal."</p>

<p>"Like his dear mistress," said Sam. "Well, I suppose I must go;
for it would look very bad to stay away after making an engagement
with her."</p>

<p>The morning came, the horses were saddled, and a four-mile walk
commenced by Sam and George Harroway. When they reached the place
where the hounds met, they beheld a good concourse of men in red
coats, and four ladies in dark green habits. These were "the
Newsham girls" as they were called. Anne rode up to Sam and bade
him good morning, and then spoke to Harroway, and Sam's steed
"Mazeppa."</p>

<p>In half an hour there was a find, and ere long the fox broke
cover, and the hounds were in full cry.</p>

<p>To Sam Freeport's great disgust he could not keep up with Anne
and Harroway. They were better mounted than any one in the field,
and in riding neither of them could be well surpassed.</p>

<p>Seeing that he was all behind in the chase, and that it was
useless to go on any further, Sam pulled up, and said to himself:
"This is not the sport for women to join in, and if she wont give
it up I'll think no more about her. George Harroway may have her if
he likes. Scratching one's face to pieces, and running the risk of
breaking one's neck every five minutes, is much too serious a
business to be called sport. No, no, Anne, you must cut this, or I
must cut you."</p>

<p>Extremely vexed, Sam turned round and made for home, which he
reached by nine or ten o'clock.</p>

<p>Harroway admired Anne Newsham for the very quality which Sam
Freeport disliked. Her skill in handling her horse, her judgment in
making points, and thus sparing the animal, while she placed
herself well in the field, as far as regarded being in at the
death, quite captivated George Harroway; and had he not felt it
would be wrong to be a rival of Sam's, he would have made desperate
love to her. As it was he was only "very attentive;" and Anne
Newsham was equally pleased with George Harroway's horsemanship,
and paid him some very pretty compliments, in plain language, while
the fox was being torn to pieces.</p>

<p>"What pretty eyes that girl has got!" said Harroway, after they
had dined, and he had composed himself snugly in his easy
chair.</p>

<p>"What of that?" said Sam. "I know she has."</p>

<p>"And although she does not strike one as being pretty at first,
yet when you come to talk to her she has a very charming face. The
cheeks are prettily shaped, and her teeth are so white and regular,
and her neck is very good, and she talks such good sound sense
without any kind of affectation."</p>

<p>"She seems to have made an impression upon you, my dear George.
But you need not trouble yourself, old fellow. You would stand a
deuced poor chance against me anywhere, George; and in this
particular matter, the girl's <i>gone,</i> sir, as I told you the
other day."</p>

<p>"Well, I know that. But surely there was no harm in my praising
her in your presence?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. But young men of your age often flatter
yourselves, and here it would be of no use."</p>

<p>"We had a most delightful day."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt you had; but it will be the last you'll have
with her, I can tell you. I shall put a stop to her riding for the
future."</p>

<p>"Why should you do that?"</p>

<p>"Because I don't like it."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say you are going to propose to her, Sam?"</p>

<p>"I am; and if she accepts me, it will be on a distinct
understanding that she leaves off galloping and jumping and going
on like mad in the presence of every body that attends the
meet."</p>

<p>"She'll never give up the chase."</p>

<p>"I should like to bet you a mild thousand pound she does if I
ask her."</p>

<p>"I wont bet, Sam, because I should win your money; but mark my
word, she'll laugh at the proposal fettered with such a
condition."</p>

<p>"Well, we shall see."</p>

<p>There was a heavy fall of snow that night, and next morning it
froze fearfully hard. This was a gloomy prospect for Harroway,
whose heart and soul were in the chase. But for Sam Freeport it was
quite the contrary. It put a decided stop to the hunting.</p>

<p>Two days after the conversation just narrated, Freeport called
on the Newshams, and took the girls shopping. While the other
sisters were engaged selecting silks for dresses for the assize
ball, Sam coolly walked Anne out of the shop and down the street,
to talk to her on what he called a serious subject.</p>

<p>"You cannot be ignorant," he began, "that I like you very
much."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I know you do," she replied.</p>

<p>"I more than like you&mdash;I <i>love</i> you."</p>

<p>"Well, I am not sorry for it, for I feel happy when you are
talking to me."</p>

<p>"Will you marry me?"</p>

<p>"I will consider your proposal."</p>

<p>"And we'll be happy?"</p>

<p>"That would depend upon how we agree. I am not extravagant, and
far from inconsiderate; but, I am very fond of having my own way,
and if I am put out I can show my temper, as well as other
people."</p>

<p>"I'll give up everything in the world to you."</p>

<p>"You would be a fool to do that."</p>

<p>"There are some things I should expect you to give up for
me."</p>

<p>"Let me hear what they are."</p>

<p>"Hunting and waltzing."</p>

<p>She stared at him in astonishment, and replied&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Surely you are not serious?"</p>

<p>"Yes I am."</p>

<p>"I would not give up either one or the other for any man
living!"</p>

<p>"Just fancy my feelings, if I saw any other man put his arm
round your waist."</p>

<p>"Fiddlestick! Why, you waltz yourself!"</p>

<p>"Yes; but that is a different matter."</p>

<p>"No, no. And as for hunting, I couldn't think of giving it up.
I've been used to it, and I like it. It's a glorious amusement. You
have been smoking this morning, and I am very much mistaken if you
have not had a glass of brandy-and-water."</p>

<p>Sam blushed, and acknowledged his weakness, whereon Anne Newsham
said&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, suppose I asked you to give up cheroots and the stimulus
which diluted spirits affords you&mdash;and I dare say, if the
truth be known, you have been used to both for the last six or
seven years&mdash;would you not think me very selfish?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not; I would not touch either of them."</p>

<p>"What nonsense! Now, just fancy, when you had lighted a nice
cheroot, if I were to come up and insist on your throwing it away,
because I disliked the smell of that horrid tobacco&mdash;(I don't
dislike it, recollect; on the contrary, I rather like it&mdash;but
I say suppose)&mdash;would you not feel very much disgusted, and
think me a very selfish person for debarring you from what was a
pleasure? And suppose I saw you walk up to the sideboard&mdash;pour
a little brandy into the bottom of a tumbler, and then goggle out
the water on it from the jug&mdash;suppose I was to call out 'What,
guzzling again?' would you not wish me further? Of course you
would, and very naturally."</p>

<p>"I don't think I should."</p>

<p>"Well, you are too good for me&mdash;I judge by my own feelings.
Give up waltzing and hunting! You might just as well ask me to pull
out all my pretty teeth, shave off all my hair, and wear a bag wig.
I couldn't think of it."</p>

<p>"Then accept me unconditionally."</p>

<p>"No. As your wife it would be extremely improper in me to
indulge in pleasures which I knew were distasteful to
yourself."</p>

<p>"Then you refuse me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Sam sighed&mdash;said "Very well"&mdash;and led her back to the
shop, where her sisters were still busily engaged in making
purchases.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a>
</h2>

<p>"GEORGE," said Sam, to Harroway, "I have completely altered my
mind. It is possible that my brothers may refuse to pay my debts;
and her governor may make some beebaws and pothooks about a
"settlement," which, you know, I could not make, so I have
determined to abandon the suit. Poor girl, she'll be, no doubt, a
good deal cut up and disappointed; but it will be all for the best
in the end, I think."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it will, Sam."</p>

<p>"I should very much like to be married; but, in my
circumstances, an heiress or a dowager is absolutely indispensable.
As Anne likes hunting, too, it would be unreasonable to ask her to
forego it. What do you say?"</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you, Sam."</p>

<p>"I suspect an old lady would suit me best, George. One that
would call me <i>Captain</i> Freeport&mdash;allow me a sort of
stipendiary cash credit&mdash;go out alone in her carriage, and
leave me to do just as I pleased. This assize ball is coming off
shortly, and I'll look out there. Meanwhile, I'll make love to the
colonel's niece, for the sake of amusement. She's a very fine
looking girl, George."</p>

<p>"She's all that, Sam," quoth Harroway, who was rather pleased
that he might now make love to Anne Newsham without clashing with
his friend Freeport.</p>

<p>The colonel's niece, Miss Winnerly, was not the style of girl
that Freeport admired: she was so very timid, meek, and retiring.
It was an effort to make her speak up loud enough to be heard. She
played very well, and she sang sweetly, when she could be prevailed
upon to take courage, and favour the company. She never had the
slightest objection to a quadrille; but if any one asked her to
waltz, she said "I'd rather not," in a tone which almost implied
she was offended&mdash;if not shocked&mdash;at the bare idea of
such a thing.</p>

<p>Sam Freeport was certainly a very weak mortal in matters
connected with the heart. He used to say of himself that he was all
heart; and from the way he used to go on, the saying might be
easily believed. He had been to the colonel's house every morning
for eight days running; for after Anne Newsham's refusal he never
ventured near the family, and to live without ladies' society was
more than he felt equal to. There was a cold and distant manner in
Miss Winnerly, for which Sam Freeport could not account; but still
he persevered in his attentions&mdash;the sole object in view being
to arouse an affection for him.</p>

<p>The colonel and his wife both thought this would be a very good
match. The former poured into Sam's ear the advantage of a married
life&mdash;the comfort, the happiness, the everything, while the
latter sung the praises of the generous Sam to the young lady for
whom they designed him.</p>

<p>Easily caught and easily led, Sam Freeport was worked up to
propose; and he did so in such a warm and impressive manner that
the young lady accepted him with seeming gladness. Everything was
arranged speedily; for Sam had nothing to settle, and his intended
spouse was not an heiress. Nor was there anything on either side to
be given up; at least, the parties never asked each other questions
on this head.</p>

<p>The wedding-day was near at hand&mdash;the bridal robes had come
home&mdash;Sam had bought the ring at Barber's, besides a small but
tasty collection of jewellery for his bride elect. The colonel had
ordered a sumptuous breakfast&mdash;the corps was to give them a
ball on their return from Thorp-Arch. But lo! one fine morning, the
very day before the wedding-day, Miss Winnerly was not to be found.
They searched the house, they looked down the well, they opened a
large oak chest which the colonel kept his books and papers in;
but, alas! Miss Winnerly was nowhere to be found!</p>

<p>Sam said, "I'm blowed if I can account for this!"</p>

<p>The colonel evidently suspected something, but didn't like to
speak his mind. George Harroway had been let into the secret by
Blew, who didn't dare mention it to his master; nevertheless,
George held his tongue, and left them to their own imaginings.</p>

<p>Sam thought the best way to show his grief would be to keep his
bed, and pretend to live on gruel, sago, and arrowroot.</p>

<p>The second evening after Miss Winnerly's mysterious
disappearance, the colonel called on Sam, and said,</p>

<p>"My dear Freeport, I have at last discovered the truth. I can
well understand your disappointment, but you must cheer up, and
make the best of it. We shall always look upon you as our nephew,
and our house will, as usual, always be yours. It is a very fearful
business, very fearful!"</p>

<p>"What, has she drowned herself?" said Sam.</p>

<p>"No," replied the colonel. "Worse than that."</p>

<p>"Good Heavens! what can have happened?" said Sam. "Put me out of
my misery by telling me the worst. Has she cut her throat?"</p>

<p>"I wish she had," sighed the colonel.</p>

<p>"You'll drive me mad," said Sam, "if you keep me any longer in
suspense."</p>

<p>"The fact is, Freeport," said the colonel&mdash;"the fact is
that she has eloped with the bandmaster to Gretna Green!"</p>

<p>Sam Freeport groaned heavily&mdash;pulled the counterpane over
his head&mdash;and laughed hysterically!</p>

<p>The colonel said "Bear it like a man."</p>

<p>"Bear it!" said Sam, exposing his head; "what a lucky thing, to
be sure!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" inquired the astounded colonel.</p>

<p>"Why, they might have gone off afterwards. Consider what an
awful business <i>that</i> would have been!"</p>

<p>The bandmaster, it would seem, had taught Miss Winnerly, to play
on the piano.</p>

<p>The assize ball came on, and Sam sallied forth in search of an
heiress or a dowager. The first person he met, on entering the
room, was Anne Newsham, on the arm of Harroway, who could not
resist telling Anne the story just narrated. Anne extended her hand
to Freeport, and Sam shook it warmly.</p>

<p>"May I condole with you?" said she.</p>

<p>"Condole? No!" replied Sam. "But you may congratulate me on
having escaped, within the last fortnight, poison and something
worse."</p>

<p>The band struck up, and Harroway and Anne took their places.</p>

<p>"Brilliant assembly!" remarked Freeport to a youth whom he had
not seen before.</p>

<p>"Very," replied the youth.</p>

<p>"Great many people here whom I have never seen."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;very many people, like myself, are visitors in
York."</p>

<p>"Oh, that accounts for it. Who is that lady with the tiara of
diamonds and emeralds?"</p>

<p>"That's Mrs. Missevery."</p>

<p>"Fine looking old girl! Where does she come from?"</p>

<p>"She comes from a place called 'The Cliffs,' about six miles
from this."</p>

<p>"Where's her husband?"</p>

<p>"That I can't say&mdash;he's dead!"</p>

<p>"What was he?"</p>

<p>"He was the owner of large ironworks, to the westward."</p>

<p>That was quite sufficient to make Freeport keen for her
acquaintance. He walked up to a sleepy looking steward, who seemed
to take no interest in his office, and borrowing his favour, Sam
pinned it, conspicuously, on the breast of his coat. He then sought
a young ensign, and insisted on his being led up to the old lady
and introduced.</p>

<p>"Ask her to dance," said Sam. "She's sure to refuse you, and
then you can walk away as soon as you like."</p>

<p>The willing youth, Mr. Wilson, obeyed his superior officer, and
was duly presented to Mrs. Missevery as Lord Arthur Bloomfield. He
could scarcely keep from laughing in her face when he said, "May I
have the pleasure of dancing the next quadrille with you?"</p>

<p>The old lady bowed, thanked him, but declined.</p>

<p>Ere five minutes had elapsed, Captain Freeport and Mrs.
Missevery were in close and animated conversation. Sam found out
whom she liked in the room&mdash;and praised them. He also
discovered whom she <i>dis</i>liked&mdash;and pulled them to
pieces.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" src=
"1600601h-images/IMAGE-3.jpg"><br>
<br>
</p>

<p>"Do dance one quadrille with me?" said Sam.</p>

<p>"I have not danced for years."</p>

<p>"That's the greater reason you should dance now."</p>

<p>The lady smiled and wavered, and Freeport offered his arm, and
carried her along with him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Missevery was plain, stout, and vulgar; but good
natured.</p>

<p>The attentions of young men, especially if they were chatty, and
good-looking people, like Freeport, pleased her, and she was
somewhat vain that an officer who could know nothing about her
wealth should prefer her society to that of younger and
better-looking members of her sex.</p>

<p>"Do you know the Newshams?" asked Mrs. Missevery.</p>

<p>"Slightly&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"Do you think the girls good looking?"</p>

<p>"Why I can hardly say."</p>

<p>"For my part, I cannot see what people have to admire in
them."</p>

<p>"Oh! there's nothing whatever to admire in them, if you mean
that."</p>

<p>"Not the slightest pretensions to beauty."</p>

<p>"Not the slightest; on the contrary, I should say they were
plain."</p>

<p>"So I say. But you will get very few people to agree with
you."</p>

<p>"Never mind. I'll back our taste against that or those who hold
a contrary opinion. Wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I should. But they ride very well."</p>

<p>"So do my stable boys," said Sam, satirically.</p>

<p>This delighted Mrs. Missevery, who was a butt of Anne
Newsham's.</p>

<p>"That's rather a pretty girl," said she, looking towards a very
beautiful young creature of about eighteen or nineteen.</p>

<p>"Decidedly," replied Sam. "But, do you know, I dislike girls?
They talk such nonsense. They are so insipid&mdash;and, as my
cousin, Lord Byron, used to say,</p>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:10%">"'The nursery lisps out in all they
utter,<br>
And then they always smell of bread and butter!'"</p>
<br>

<p>"Oh no. Till they pass thirty, they have not a single
companionable charm: at least, in <i>my</i> opinion they have
not."</p>

<p>Mrs. Missevery thought Sam one of the most sensible men she had
ever seen in a red coat; and though she had never given much of her
attention to Lord Byron's works, she was glad to have made the
acquaintance of his cousin.</p>

<p>"Would you like any particular set of quadrilles?" asked Sam,
who always had charge of the band, a circumstance which made the
bandmaster's proceedings the more absurd and ridiculous.</p>

<p>"No thank you. I like a slower, quieter music. You have a very
nice band."</p>

<p>"So do I like slow music. Yes, the band is a very good
one&mdash;thanks to myself, for I have taken great pains with it.
In a few minutes you shall hear a very beautiful piece composed by
our own bandmaster, as the air to those beautiful lines of Sir
Walter Scott&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:10%">"'Why weep ye by the tide, Ladye?'"</p>
<br>

<p>"Excuse me for one moment."</p>

<p>Sam walked into the room where the band was playing. "Wilkins,"
said Sam, to the man who played the clarionet, "what are you going
to give us next?"</p>

<p>"A waltz, sir."</p>

<p>"Then, instead of playing a waltz, play 'Jock o' Hazeldean.'
Mark that! And if Mr. Harroway, or any body else, tells you to
stop, say you are acting under Captain Freeport's orders. Do you
understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Sam joined Mrs. Missevery, and awaited the air with much anxiety
and inward laughter.</p>

<p>Harroway, with Anne Newsham, passed the door of the music room.
He made a motion of the hand as a signal for the band to strike
up.</p>

<p>"What on earth is this?" said Anne Newsham, who was expecting
something very different to the demi-doleful strain that struck
upon the ear of the assembly.</p>

<p>"The band's certainly drunk!" exclaimed George Harroway. "Sit
here, Miss Newsham, for a moment, and I will see what they are
about."</p>

<p>Harroway walked into the other room, where he found them sober
enough; but to his surprise he beheld the French horn, the bassoon,
and the first fife, convulsed with laughter, for the men saw the
fun.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by this, Wilkins?" said Harroway. "Do you call
this a waltz?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. It's by order of the captain," said the man rapidly,
and then he applied himself to his instrument, and made it
<i>speak,</i></p>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:10%">"And she went o'er the waters wide<br>
Wi' Jock o' Hazeldean."</p>
<br>

<p>The bandmaster's name was Hazeldean.</p>

<p>The thought flashed across George's mind, and he could not help
joining in laughter with the French horn, who tried, but without
success, to vie with the clarionet in giving effect to Captain
Freeport's whim. The poor man was overcome with merriment.</p>

<p>"This must be for Captain Freeport's consolation," said Anne,
when her partner came back to her.</p>

<p>"He ordered it to be played, it seems," said George. "It is just
like him."</p>

<p>"Really, he is the oddest man I ever saw," said Anne. "Where is
he?"</p>

<p>"Yonder&mdash;mark the action of his hand. See how he is talking
to that old lady in the false hair."</p>

<p>"I declare he has got hold of that old hag, Mrs. Missevery! Such
a monster! The most disgusting creature in existence! The greatest
enemy I have in the world! Perhaps the only one! I feel jealous. I
do indeed!"</p>

<p>"Don't say that," said George Harroway, rather nettled by the
remark. "If you are jealous of her, I shall be jealous of him."</p>

<p>"What stuff!" was Anne's reply. "My sister Jessie, who is a very
knowing hand, says you are all only birds of passage, and it just
suits your book to make yourselves agreeable for the time being;
and after what I have seen, I am inclined to believe her. Captain
Freeport, you know, said all sorts of pretty things to me, only the
other day, and look at him now. Look&mdash;look! He is certainly
going to kiss her. Look at him. Look! And see how the old hag is
coquetting. What a funny, foolish world it is, to be sure."</p>

<p>George sighed, as he looked at the artificial flowers which were
tacked at the top of Anne Newsham's white muslin dress.</p>

<p>"Why do you sigh?" she asked. "You'll make me yawn."</p>

<p>The smitten subaltern made a bold reply, which pleased the girl,
although she distrusted him. She admired his large languishing
eyes, as much as his courage and skill in the field.</p>

<p>"The hounds meet the day after to-morrow," she observed, "and if
your feelings don't go with this delightful thaw, talk to me
then."</p>

<p>"That is understood," said Harroway, emphatically. "Now, then,
we'll have a waltz in earnest. There they go. Come along."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a>
</h2>

<p>"WHO is that young man dancing with Anne Newsham?" asked Mrs.
Missevery.</p>

<p>"That's George Harroway," replied Sam; "but you don't mean to
say you call him young?"</p>

<p>"Why, he can't be more than three or four and twenty."</p>

<p>"He'll never see five and thirty again. Certainly not. Let me
see. He is just one year and a half my junior."</p>

<p>"You wear uncommonly well. I should not have taken either of you
to be thirty."</p>

<p>"The dress has a great deal to do with it. It makes a man look
very much younger than he really is."</p>

<p>"What age, now, would you take <i>me</i> to be?" asked Mrs.
Missevery (with a smile), drawing herself up, and sitting as erect
as possible.</p>

<p>"Why, I am very seldom out," said Sam. "Let me see. Why, I
should say I had the advantage of you by four or five years."</p>

<p>Mrs. Missevery shook her head.</p>

<p>"Not so much as that?" suggested Sam.</p>

<p>"We are within one year," said the lady.</p>

<p>The fact was Mrs. Missevery was forty-seven; but according to
her own account she was only seven and <i>thirty</i>.</p>

<p>"I hope you don't think thirty-seven old," said Sam.</p>

<p>"No; but it is not young," she replied.</p>

<p>"We've still enough of light and life for some gay soarings
yet," quoted the insinuating Sam.</p>

<p>"I hope so."</p>

<p>"Let's have a trial in this waltz," said Sam; and before the
lady had time to deny him, she was on her legs, and whisked round
the room with the rest of the dancers. Mrs. Missevery had never
waltzed in her life before: of the step she had not the most remote
idea; but she did her best, and held on by Sam's epaulette, as
though it was for her very life.</p>

<p>Anne Newsham gave vent to her feelings in a scream which rang
through the Assembly Rooms. "The idea&mdash;the vanity of that old
cat!" she said to her partner. "The idea! she must be mad! Who
could ever have thought the old goose would be guilty of such a
misdemeanour? Look! she has her eyes shut. She must be getting
giddy. I should like to see them come down. This is too much. I
must sit down to enjoy the fun."</p>

<p>Mrs. Missevery <i>was</i> giddy; for when Sam brought her up,
she still held on by the epaulette, and fancied everybody was
walking on the ceiling. When she "came to," she observed Anne
Newsham laughing at her, and another poor girl in hysterics, and
the subject of a scene herself. Mrs. Missevery darted a look of
indignation at Anne, and then remarked to Sam, "Really, the bold
effrontery of that girl, Anne Newsham, is beyond everything!"</p>

<p>Sam agreed, and took her to the refreshment table, where he told
her she waltzed with a lighter step than any one in the room.</p>

<p>Freeport was of the same opinion as Butler as to the way that
widows should be wooed, and he therefore determined to carry Mrs.
Missevery and her "iron works to the westward," by assault.</p>

<p>"I should like to have you as a partner for life," said Sam.</p>

<p>Mrs. Missevery smiled.</p>

<p>"But I fear," he added, "that some other is more fortunate."</p>

<p>"I am at my own disposal," said Mrs. Missevery, proudly.</p>

<p>"Would that you were at mine!" ejaculated Sam.</p>

<p>Mrs. Missevery distended her aged eyelids, and her "adorer"
handed her to a retired part of the room; and before he led her
forth to the next dance, she was "engaged" to him.</p>

<p>She informed him that she had a good fortune; which made him
declare that he despised wealth, and never thought of it when
happiness was the object in view.</p>

<p>When the ball was over, Sam saw Mrs. Missevery to her carriage.
Just before he closed the door, he contrived to impart a kiss on
the glove of her left hand.</p>

<p>"Well, Sam, how did you enjoy yourself?" inquired Harroway, when
they got home, at about three o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>"Never enjoyed myself more in my life," was the reply.</p>

<p>"What was the meaning of making that old woman waltz? You were
nearly the death of poor Anne."</p>

<p>"Why, I wanted to turn her head, preparatory to making an inroad
upon her heart. She is worth a mint of money, and no end of iron
works to the westward."</p>

<p>"Well, have you succeeded?"</p>

<p>"Of course. I never was refused in my life. The thing is
settled, sir. She's mine."</p>

<p>"How she clutched you in the waltz!"</p>

<p>"Didn't she! And, by Jove, George, only look at the condition
she has left the bullion in; and no end of 'em are gone! Never
mind, she'll make it all good by and bye! There's nothing like
iron, after all. I say, did you notice her diamonds? Wouldn't they
make fine shirt studs!"</p>

<p>Harroway was too deeply engaged in thinking of Anne to take much
heed of Freeport's discourse. The girl had made him love her, and
he longed for the next meeting of the hounds.</p>

<p>Freeport called on his betrothed, and made himself remarkably
agreeable. She invited him to "The Cliffs" (her "beautiful
estate"), whither she purposed proceeding on the morrow.</p>

<p>Sam expressed the great delight he should experience in seeing
her in her own home, and accepted the invitation.</p>

<p>That "horrid Anne Newsham" was the principal theme on which Mrs.
Missevery touched, and (laughing all the while in his heart)
Freeport gave her great encouragement to pursue the subject.</p>

<p>The hounds met the very day that Sam paid his visit to "The
Cliffs." After a run of two or three miles, George Harroway and
Anne paired off towards a point which the fox was not likely to
make, and left the field entirely.</p>

<p>The girl pulled up, and, looking tenderly in his face, said,
"Now then, what are you going to say? Don't tell me anything you
don't mean. But, before you begin, I ought to tell you what passed
between Captain Freeport and myself a day or two before the ball.
It is right you should know it at first, because it might influence
you hereafter."</p>

<p>She then informed him of all that passed&mdash;Sam's proposal,
and her subsequent refusal.</p>

<p>The disclosure made Harroway laugh; at the same time it
strengthened his regard for the honest-hearted girl, with whom he
felt he could be happy. He then told her of what he was possessed.
She said she was glad he was wealthy, for she had a horror of
poverty.</p>

<p>Harroway intimated that he would ask her father's consent, which
would be granted as a matter of course.</p>

<p>"You may ask him," said the girl. "But if he refused, it would
be of no consequence. They have taught us to do as we like, and we
are too old now to forget the lesson. There's a prospect for you!
What do you say to that?"</p>

<p>"I'm content to take my chance," replied Harroway.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the meaning of this?" cried the girl. "The fox went
round the bottom of yonder hill, and here they come, pressing him
hard. Bravo! we are in at the death after all! How vexed my sisters
will be! They are not here! Don't tell them this was all luck, but
judgment; and mark how vigorously they will argue the point."</p>

</h2>

<p>WHETHER it was the over exertion at the ball&mdash;an exertion
she was not accustomed to&mdash;or whether it was the excitement
which her forthcoming wedding occasioned&mdash;or whether it was
neither the one nor the other, it is impossible to say: but when
Freeport reached the Cliffs, he found Mrs. Missevery "rather
poorly." She had a severe headache, and complained of slight fever.
Sam very tenderly told her she should be careful of herself; but
she declared that she never gave way to illness; and after
luncheon, she put on her shawl and bonnet, and showed her husband
elect all over the estate. It was her wont to be wheeled about in a
Bath chair, but on this occasion she walked, and leant upon
Freeport's arm. It was truly a very nice estate, and it was kept in
excellent order. The gravel walks of the garden were so nicely
rolled, and the trees even were "tidiness" itself. Freeport praised
everything; but more than once he exclaimed, "But what are these
compared with yourself! They bring comfort with them, it is true;
but happiness flows from another spring. It comes from a kindred
concatenation of ideas, and a reciprocity of sentiment."</p>

<p>Mrs. Missevery fancied the air had done her good, and towards
evening her spirits mounted higher.</p>

<p>Sam parted with her in the library, which was well stocked with
elegantly bound and gold lettered books.</p>

<p>The next day, Freeport's anxiety led him early to "The Cliffs."
He was grieved to the heart to find that Mrs. Missevery was now
very unwell. The expression of his face was sorrowful in the
extreme, and he was kindness and attention personified. He read the
"Corsair" to her, and several other minor poems by the same author;
and he wrung from her a promise that she would take medical advice.
She mentioned "Mr. Blink," a rising young man, of whom she had
heard a very high opinion expressed. Sam said he had never had an
opportunity of judging of Blink's talent, but that the doctor of
his corps was a very able practitioner, and he was sure he would
most gladly render his advice, and with her (Mrs. Missevery's)
permission, he would bring him to see her on the following day. So
pressing and importunate was Freeport in this behalf, his intended
wife consented, and Dr. Flood was introduced to Mrs. Missevery,
having been previously warned by Sam that if he didn't cure her
quick he would never speak to him again.</p>

<p>Mrs. Missevery did not improve under Dr. Flood's hands; on the
contrary, she grew worse, and was in danger&mdash;a matter of which
she was duly sensible. She sent one night for Newsham, and
dismissing her attendants, she spoke with him in private. It was
her intention, she said, to leave all her estate, real and
personal, to Captain Freeport, of the&mdash;&mdash;Foot, with the
exception of a legacy of £10,000 to her nephew. She begged that the
will might be drawn up without delay; but enjoined Newsham, as a
professional man, not to break a word of this to a soul until after
her demise, should such contingency happen.</p>

<p>It did not take Newsham long to draught a will of that kind. He
copied it out on half a sheet of paper, and it was duly signed,
sealed, and delivered in the presence of himself, her steward, and
the nurse (the two latter witnesses being ignorant of the will's
contents). The anxiety of Freeport was beyond description. He was
perfectly wretched.</p>

<p>Mrs. Missevery died&mdash;and Sam was so "cut up," he nearly did
the same.</p>

<p>Newsham called on Freeport one morning, and found him sitting
over the fire in a most lugubrious state of mind. "I have come to
condole with you," said Newsham.</p>

<p>"What's the use of condolence," said Sam, "when a man has
suffered an irreparable loss? Irreparable, Newsham,
irreparable!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know <i>that</i>," observed Newsham.</p>

<p>"But I do, my good fellow, and that's enough."</p>

<p>"It's a very fine property," remarked the attorney. "The
personalty is considerably above the £10,000 she has disposed of in
favour of her nephew."</p>

<p>"Look here, Newsham," said Sam. "No man likes a joke more than I
do&mdash;but this is past a joke. Don't tantalize me, or I'll get
savage."</p>

<p>"No, don't get savage," quoth Newsham, "but listen to this." He
withdrew the original will from his pocket, and read as
follows:</p>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:5%">"I, SUSAN MISSEVERY,<br>
<br>
relict of the late John Missevery, late of the Cliffs, in the
county of York, do hereby will and bequeath all my estate, real and
personal, wheresoever and whatsoever it may be, to Samuel Freeport
of the&mdash;&mdash;Regiment of Foot, absolutely and for ever. But
I charge the said estate with the following legacy, that is to say
the sum of ten thousand pounds to my nephew, Robert Sparrow, of
Hollyrook. And I do hereby appoint the said Samuel Freeport to be
the sole executor of this my last will and testament. In witness
whereof, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c."</p>
<br>

<p>"You don't mean to say that is genuine?" said Sam, doubting his
own ears as well as Newsham's tongue.</p>

<p>"There's her signature," said Newsham.</p>

<p>"Never saw it before in my life. But if <i>you</i> know it,
that's enough. Now, then, what's to be done? Have a glass of
Madeira and a biscuit."</p>

<p>"You must take out probate," said Newsham.</p>

<p>"What's probate?"</p>

<p>"You must get the will proved in the diocese. Bat if you like to
leave it to me, I'll have it arranged for you."</p>

<p>"Well, do, like a good fellow. Who'd have thought it, eh?"</p>

<p>"I knew of it seven days ago."</p>

<p>"Then, why didn't you tell me?"</p>

<p>"Because I was enjoined not to do so. There's a time for all
things, Freeport."</p>

<p>"So there is, Newsham. You are quite right. Everything is mine,
except £10,000, eh? Very well, I am satisfied. She was a good old
creature."</p>

<p>All the attorneys in York were so jealous that Newsham should
get the "pickings" out of the testator's estate, that they declared
Mrs. Missevery was not of sound mind when she signed the will. This
reached the nephew's ear, and he took advice as to whether he could
not set the will aside, and claim the whole property as heir at
law, and several learned gentlemen said that they were of opinion
"if the testator were not of sound mind the will might be set
aside, but if the testator were of sound mind, it could not be set
aside." They further remarked that "the sanity or otherwise would
form the subject of a special issue," and recommended "if the will
were contested that a special jury should be applied for."</p>

<p>The nephew of Mrs. Missevery was determined to go to law, and a
"caveat"&mdash;(that is what they called it)&mdash;was entered in
the Ecclesiastical Court. Sam was extremely annoyed at these
proceedings; but Newsham assured him there was no danger, as the
onus of proof would lie on the other side, and no single act of the
lady's could be brought forward in support of her insanity. Sam
said he was ready to swear she was the most rational woman he ever
met; and Newsham coincided with him entirely. When the case was
ripe for trial, however, Freeport began to grow nervous, and
suggested to his attorney that "it would be advisable to have a
compromise with the fellow."</p>

<p>Newsham said, "I thank you are very foolish."</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied Sam. "I should not like the thing brought
before the public. Let him consent to give me the £10,000 and the
jewels and the plate, and I'll give up everything else. I'd give up
<i>all,</i> but the fact is, Newsham, I find my father has not left
me anything, and I can't afford it. My brothers are all rich men,
and I have not a sixpence."</p>

<p>"Well," said Newsham, "if you are determined on a compromise,
let <i>me</i> manage it."</p>

<p>"Do, like a good fellow, Newsham," said Sam; "I don't want to be
hard, you know. Settle it. Settle it amicably."</p>

<p>Newsham attended to his instructions. He had agreed that the
nephew was to take the real estate, and give up to his (Newsham's)
client the whole of the personalty, £17,500 in the funds&mdash;the
jewellery and plate&mdash;the furniture, carriages, horses, &amp;c.
&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>Freeport signed "a release," which by the way he never looked
at, and Newsham paid him over £10,000, gave him the tiara of
diamonds and emeralds, and a few old rings&mdash;the carriage and
the horses&mdash;and&mdash;the residue he put into his own
pocket!</p>

<p>It was thus that Sam Freeport gave up some £28,000 worth of real
property, independent of the <i>bonus</i> taken by Newsham.</p>

<p>George Harroway was a remarkably close man in his private
affairs&mdash;the very reverse of his friend Freeport in this
particular; and he never once hinted to any one that he had any
idea of matrimony, or any partiality for Anne Newsham. The young
lady had also been silent or the subject, even with the members of
her own family; for Harroway had given her a very good reason why
the matter should not be talked about just then.</p>

<p>Sam Freeport persuaded himself that Anne had still a slumbering
love for him&mdash;which he might as well awaken, and while he was
about it, put the question&mdash;get accepted&mdash;and then
married. He had business to settle with Newsham the morning that he
made the above resolve, and he thought he might as well communicate
to his "father-in-law&mdash;that was to be," the matter which
hovered about his heart.</p>

<p>"Very well, Newsham, I understand all about this," said Sam,
folding up a long deed which the attorney had explained. "And I
have signed it, and it's all right. But there's another little
matter I should like to talk to you about, Newsham. All through my
life I have been straightforward and honest."</p>

<p>"Nothing like it," said Newsham, "and I look upon that £10,000
you are to receive as the reward. Yes, there is truth in the
proverb, 'Honesty is the best policy, and virtue reaps her own
reward.'"</p>

<p>"Never mind virtue," said Sam impetuously. "Look here, Newsham.
You are of course aware that I proposed to your daughter Anne, and
that she would not have me at any price?"</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed the astonished father. "Surely you are
mistaken."</p>

<p>"Not I. I never was mistaken in my life. Certainly not in a
business of that kind. She must have mentioned it."</p>

<p>"Not she," said Newsham. "You don't know that girl, Freeport.
I'll be bound she never mentioned it to a soul."</p>

<p>"She is assuredly a great trump," observed Sam. "I like her ten
times better than ever. Well Newsham, what I was going to say is
this. I feel very much disposed to renew the suit. I've got this
ten thousand pounds, and I dare say you would give her two or three
thousand pounds more, and on the interest of that money and my pay,
we should be able to make it out very comfortably."</p>

<p>"You ought to," remarked Newsham.</p>

<p>"Well then," said Sam, "if you have no objection, I'll try her
again. Of course you must be aware&mdash;and so must she&mdash;that
although I liked Mrs. Missevery very much, and all that sort of
thing you know, Newsham, nevertheless the disparity of years, and
one thing or other, rendered it absurd to suppose that I was very
deeply in love with her. Do you understand, Newsham? Do you
see?"</p>

<p>"Oh, perfectly," said Newsham&mdash;"perfectly."</p>

<p>"Then you'll put in your good parental word for me," suggested
Sam.</p>

<p>"Why, yes. I'll leave her to act as she pleases; but I'll say
the match would give me great satisfaction, and get her mother to
say the same."</p>

<p>"Give us your hand," cried Sam. "I'll come down quietly
to-morrow morning and breakfast with you, and perhaps you will
manage to get me an opportunity of putting the question?"</p>

<p>Newsham said, "Oh yes. That shall be done."</p>

<p>After a little further conversation, Freeport left Newsham, and
proceeded to his quarters, where he found George Harroway reading
the last new novel.</p>

<p>"I say George," said Sam, "what was the price you put upon the
grey that I gave to that trump of a girl, Anne Newsham?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, Sam. Don't mention it. I have had such pleasure in
seeing the dear girl ride him, that more than once I have been glad
to think you made her the present."</p>

<p>"That's all very well, George; but circumstances render it
necessary and proper that I should pay you for him, and as I have
the money, I wish to do so."</p>

<p>"What circumstances?"</p>

<p>"Why, look here, George. Anne Newsham will be mine, after all. I
have this moment got her governor's consent, and the mother, too,
is all on my side."</p>

<p>"You don't say so?"</p>

<p>"It's a fact, sir."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>Sam asseverated so strongly that George believed him on that
occasion.</p>

<p>"Under these circumstances," said George, "you ought to pay for
him. He cost me 400 guineas, and I don't want to make anything by
him."</p>

<p>"Here you are," said Sam, writing out a cheque for the amount.
"What a nice thing it is to have money in a bank to draw on, eh,
George?"</p>

<p>"So you have resolved to have Anne, after all?" remarked
Harroway, folding up the cheque, and putting it into his waistcoat
pocket. "Well, Sam, I wish you luck and happiness with her. But
have you said anything to Anne herself on the subject?"</p>

<p>"Not yet; but she'll accept me, sir. Who could resist a man like
me?" Freeport rose from his chair, confronted the mirror, and while
he arranged his scarf, and adjusted his collar, he sang the chorus
of his favourite (by the way his only) song.</p>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:10%">"'It's thus I play the enchanter's
part,<br>
And scatter bliss around;<br>
And not a tear or aching heart<br>
Shall in the world be found.'"</p>
<br>

<p>"George, why don't you take to playing the enchanter's
part?"</p>

<p>"It is so difficult, Sam."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, man, strike up to Jane&mdash;she is a jolly girl,
too. What's the use of remaining single? Blew!"</p>

<p>"Sir!"</p>

<p>"Go over and tell the major I shall dine with him this
evening."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a>
</h2>

<p>THE moment Freeport left the room, Harroway made his toilet, and
drove down to the Newshams. The girls were not at home, and George
gleaned from Mrs. Newsham that they had gone to the bookseller's.
He drove there, and found them buying cardboard and pencils. Anne
was taken aside, and informed of "Sam's intentions."</p>

<p>"I would give the world to be present when he makes the
declaration," said Harroway. "Could not you contrive to conceal me
under the sofa, or behind a curtain?"</p>

<p>Anne wrinkled her intelligent brow, and laughed with those
sparkling and speaking grey eyes of hers.</p>

<p>"I'll write to you, dear George, to-night," she whispered,
"after my father has spoken to me."</p>

<p>The words "Dear George"&mdash;the first endearing sentence she
had ever expressed to Harroway&mdash;almost made him giddy, and he
prudently hurried away from her presence, lest he should make a
fool of himself before her sisters.</p>

<p>Harroway was engaged to dine with the colonel, but he made an
excuse and stayed at home, anxiously awaiting Anne's letter. Nine
o'clock came, and no signs of it. Ten o'clock, and no letter came.
Eleven&mdash;Sam came home singing all the way up the stairs, "the
enchanter's part." Harroway pretended to be asleep. Sam tried to
awake him, but he would not be aroused. Presently, he heard Sam
stealing away on tip-toe, and, half opening one eye, he saw him
take the cork out of the brandy bottle, and burn it over the
candle. Harroway knew that Sam intended to black him, but still he
would not stir. Freeport approached him, and hummed. "It's thus I'd
play" (he gave George an immense eye-brow) "the enchanter's
part"&mdash;(another eye-brow)&mdash;"and scatter bliss" (a streak
down the nose) "a rou-u-n-nd." (Moustache.) "And not a tear" (an
imperial) "or aching heart" (a touch on the right cheek) "should in
the world" (a touch on the left cheek) "be found!" (a spot on the
forehead).</p>

<p>It was very difficult for George to keep his countenance during
this performance; nevertheless, he managed it until Sam retired,
chuckling, and singing away as lustily as possible.</p>

<p>In less than ten minutes, Freeport was sound asleep, and
snoring. Harroway then got up, and taking Sam's own cork, proceeded
to his bedside, and then and there repaid the compliment. Scarcely
had he returned to his easy chair, when he heard a footstep in the
passage. The door was opened, and a servant appeared, holding in
his hand a letter.</p>

<p>Harroway took it from him, and read as follows&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:5%">"MY DEAR, GEORGE,<br>
<br>
Sure enough all you told me is quite true. I am to see Captain
Freeport to-morrow morning. My father and mother are decidedly of
opinion he will make me a very good husband, and I have feigned to
yield to their wishes, and accept his offer. I give advice to, and
doctor nearly all the old women in York; and if you will dress
yourself up in the clothes I send you, you will readily gain
admittance about half-past eight. Mind you go round by the gate, to
the back door, and ask for <i>Miss Anne.</i> I will contrive to
conceal you in the little sitting-room, where I intend to listen to
my Sammy's vows. It is twelve o'clock, and I am shivering with
cold. So good night, my dear George, and believe me, for ever, your
Anne.<br>
<br>
"P.S.&mdash;We breakfast at nine. If you could manage to be here at
about a quarter-past, and send in a note for me, I could come out,
and arrange it beautifully."</p>
<br>

<p>"There's a carpet-bag for you, sir," said the servant.</p>

<p>"Then bring it here," said Harroway.</p>

<p>The carpet-bag was produced, and when the servant had departed,
its contents were examined. There was an old drugget gown, a red
shawl, a cap, and a dingy black silk bonnet. The turn out was
typical of an old woman in want of assistance. Harroway concealed
the garb furnished by Anne, and sought his couch. As for sleeping,
it was out of the question, and he did not attempt it.</p>

<p>At daylight, Sam Freeport came into Harroway's room (as was his
wont) for coffee.</p>

<p>"Why, you must have been drunk last night, George," said Sam,
after opening the shutter, and seating himself at the foot of
George's bed.</p>

<p>"What makes you think that, Sam?"</p>

<p>"Why, somebody has been blacking your face. I never saw such a
figure in the whole course of my life. Get up, and look at yourself
in the glass."</p>

<p>"Well, I confess I was a little overcome, Sam; but you must have
been in the same condition."</p>

<p>"Never! Nobody ever saw <i>me</i> drunk!"</p>

<p>"Then, how comes your face to be blacked also?"</p>

<p>Sam got up and went to the dressing table.</p>

<p>"I say, George," said Sam, mysteriously, and bringing the
looking-glass to the bedside&mdash;"look here! The fellow that
blacked you must have blacked me; for we seem to be both touched up
alike."</p>

<p>* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Such a figure as George Harroway was, in the adopted apparel, it
would be very difficult to describe. Verily, he looked "a monster."
Anne did not keep him long waiting, for she anticipated the cook's
message, and left the breakfast table as soon as she heard loud
voices in the kitchen.</p>

<p>In the small sitting-room, where the scene was to be enacted,
there was a large couch, with a loose brown holland cover&mdash;and
under that couch crawled George Harroway.</p>

<p>"Make yourself as comfortable as you can," said Anne. "Here,
take the pillows. We shall not be long, for he looks very impatient
to put the question to me. Now, don't laugh, or you'll spoil it
all."</p>

<p>* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Newsham and his wife left the breakfast-room, and Freeport told
Anne that he wished to speak to her in private.</p>

<p>"What can you have to say to me?" said Anne, leading him into
the little room.</p>

<p>"I want to talk to you quietly," said Sam, as they both sat down
upon the couch.</p>

<p>"Well," said she.</p>

<p>"Be mine!" said Sam, seizing her hand.</p>

<p>She looked at him, and said, in a serious tone, "Captain
Freeport, do you really think I could marry a murderer?"</p>

<p>"A what?"</p>

<p>"A murderer. It is commonly reported, and generally believed,
that you killed poor old Mrs. Missevery."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! You don't mean to say that anything so horrid is laid
to my charge?"</p>

<p>"They say that you and the doctor of the regiment killed
her&mdash;at least, that is the story set afloat by Dr. Blink."</p>

<p>"What an ungrateful villain! Mrs. Missevery, it is true, wanted
to call him in; but I persuaded her not to do so. You, yourself,
said that you would not trust him with a <i>cat,</i> and to my
knowledge and cost he was not to be trusted with a dog. If the
killing of Mrs. Missevery is your only objection, I can soon
overcome that."</p>

<p>"Well, but taking your innocence for granted, are you sincere
when you say you love me?"</p>

<p>"Sincere? Ay, I never loved a soul in my life except
yourself."</p>

<p>"And would you, through long, long years be the same kind and
affectionate creature to me that you would now have me to
believe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to the end of the world."</p>

<p>"And never thwart me, nor aggravate me, nor put me out, but just
suffer me to do as I pleased, and let me waltz and hunt?"</p>

<p>"Of course I would&mdash;for ever and ever."</p>

<p>"Mr. Harroway says you are very fickle."</p>

<p>"Harroway, like most other persons, has his failings as well as
his virtues. George is a very good boy&mdash;I love him dearly;
but, unfortunately, he cannot always confine himself to truth."</p>

<p>"Then you are <i>not</i> fickle?"</p>

<p>Sam went upon his knees before Anne Newsham, and made the most
impassioned declaration. But just as he was coming to a crisis,
George Harroway began to imitate a cat, and mewed most
piteously.</p>

<p>"Hist! get out!" cried Sam, stamping his foot to frighten away
the supposed puss.</p>

<p>"<i>Mew! Mew!! Mew!! Whow-who-o-ou-whow!</i>"</p>

<p>"Don't be unkind to the poor cat!" said Anne to Sam, who was
getting angry at the interruption.</p>

<p>"I would not hurt the cat for the world," said Sam; "but let me
put her out of the room."</p>

<p>"Be gentle with her," said Anne.</p>

<p>"Never fear," replied Sam, lifting up the cover.</p>

<p>No one could have recognised Harroway in his disguise; and when
he grinned, Sam fancied it was some old woman who had escaped from
the lunatic asylum. His jaw fell; and surprise was stamped upon
every feature of his face.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" inquired Anne, as Freeport withdrew from
the couch in amazement. "Say what&mdash;what is the matter?" She
got up and clasped her hands.</p>

<p>"'Pon my soul, the cat's a human being!" said Sam, "or else it
is a ghost."</p>

<p>"Not Mrs. Missevery's, I hope!"</p>

<p>"That I can't say; but really it is not very unlike her."</p>

<p>George Harroway resumed his <i>"mew,"</i> and his <i>"whow,"</i>
and Anne shrieked, pretended to faint, and fell into Freeport's
arms. Newsham soon rushed in, followed by the rest of the family.
None of them knew <i>what</i> to think. How could they? Sam felt
most anxious to satisfy them, as speedily as possible, that Anne's
alarm was not <i>his</i> doing, and he therefore said to Newsham,
"Just look under the sofa."</p>

<p>Newsham looked; but he saw nothing. George crawled out the
moment Anne shrieked, and contrived to get away from the house
unseen&mdash;except by some of the servants, who took no notice of
him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a>
</h2>

<p>HARROWAY got safely home, and speedily divested himself of his
disguise. When Freeport made his appearance, he found George busily
engaged writing letters.</p>

<p>"Well, Sam, is it all right?" inquired Harroway.</p>

<p>"I am happy to say it is, George; but a most extraordinary thing
took place there. Listen to this."</p>

<p>Freeport here narrated very circumstantially all that related to
the old woman under the sofa.</p>

<p>"Are you sure that Newsham is not making a fool of you?" said
Harroway.</p>

<p>"Quite sure. What makes you think that?"</p>

<p>"Why, they say that he is in league with Mrs. Missevery, who is
still living, and that you will never get a farthing of the
money."</p>

<p>Freeport stared at George in a stupor.</p>

<p>"It looks very like a trick," continued Harroway.</p>

<p>"And now that I come to put this and that together," said Sam,
"I feel disposed to agree with you."</p>

<p>"Have you touched any of the money yet, Sam?"</p>

<p>"No. But it is all there in the bank."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. The cheque for four hundred guineas is refused
payment, on the ground of 'no assets.'"</p>

<p>"You don't say so?"</p>

<p>"A fact. Old Newsham has probably discovered that you hoaxed him
about the £20,000 in the funds, and he has done this as a return;
and serve you right."</p>

<p>"But isn't it very strange that Flood should be taken in, too?
He saw her, and declared it was impossible she could recover.
What's the use of doctors, if they don't know these things,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Not at all strange. You know how easy it is to deceive a
doctor, and make yourself out very ill, when you are as well as can
be."</p>

<p>"Very true, George; yes, you're right. But I am not going to let
that pettyfogging old vagabond play me a trick of this kind without
telling him my mind. Give me a sheet of paper. Mr. Newsham, sir,
What shall I say, George?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be intemperate, but <i>facete.</i> Just
say&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:5%">"SIR,<br>
<br>
When you see Mrs. Missevery again, which I trust will be before
long, give my love to her. It was not a bad joke of
yours&mdash;that of killing the old girl for my benefit; but as I
cannot touch the money, why&mdash;<br>
<br>
I remain, yours, in great disgust,<br>
<br>
"S. FREEPORT."</p>
<br>

<p>Sam wrote the above, and despatched it. The following is the
reply it elicited. Newsham was indebted to his daughter Anne for
the suggestion:&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:5%">"SIR,<br>
<br>
From the tenour and substance of your note, I believe you to be an
insane person; and if you remain in York, I shall apply to the
authorities to have a restraint placed upon your actions.<br>
<br>
"Yours obediently,<br>
<br>
"J. NEWSHAM."</p>
<br>

<p>"Here's a go," cried Sam. "He says I'm mad, George. I must
insist on his making an apology; and if he don't
I'll&mdash;&mdash;; no, I wont touch him, because he's Anne's
father."</p>

<p>Harroway, fearing the joke might be carried too far, let his
friend into the whole secret. Freeport had played so many tricks
off upon George, that he could not be angry; and when he found out
that the money was not a delusion, but in the bank, he laughed very
heartily. To face the Newshams again was more than even Freeport's
coolness was equal to; and a circumstance soon occurred that took
him to London.</p>

<p>The colonel heard of the band having played "Jock o' Hazeldean,"
and he was very wroth with Sam. He gave an order that the band
should not go out again to parties; and a hint was dropped that,
for the future, Captain Freeport would not be allowed to go away
whenever he pleased, to be absent continually from parade, and in
total ignorance of everything that related to his company and the
regiment.</p>

<p>The major, who was a great friend of Freeport's, advised him to
exchange, if he couldn't make up his mind to conform; "for," said
he, "if you ever give the colonel another chance, he will not fail
to bring you to a court martial."</p>

<p>"As for exchanging," said Sam, "I might get out of the
frying-pan into the fire; and as for recollecting when this is to
be done, and that is to be inspected, and when committees sit, and
all that sort of thing, it is more than I can do. I've got lots of
money now; and I am a single man, with no incumbrances&mdash;no
wife&mdash;no children&mdash;no nothing&mdash;to provide for. Why
shouldn't I retire on half pay? Here am I, with ten thousand
pounds, and a tiara of diamonds and emeralds. I'll go up to town
and keep open house in Portland Place. Hang me if I don't."</p>

<p>George Harroway and Anne Newsham were married in York Cathedral,
on the 1st of February, 18&mdash;. The former was in his
twenty-third year, and the latter had just seen her nineteenth.
Harroway was a handsome man; but he was not a man of talent. He was
far from a fool; but his intellect was certainly not above
mediocrity. Anne was not handsome, but she was good looking; and in
point of ability and ready wit, very few men had an advantage over
her, while not one in a thousand of her own sex could be placed in
competition.</p>

<p>In common with her sisters, Anne Newsham received "a good plain
education," but she was not "accomplished." In point of general
information on matters connected with the world, Anne was
remarkably well stocked; and she could talk rationally and sensibly
on any topic&mdash;no matter what it might be. Her knowledge of
horses, dogs, and whatever appertained to sport, appeared to be
instinctive. She had a kind and warm heart, but her light and
off-handed remarks would have led many persons to suppose the
contrary.</p>

<p>When Freeport arrived in town, he hired a cab to take him to the
house of his elder brother in Belgrave Square, where he was well
received, and closely interrogated as to the amount he had come in
for. Rumour had set it down at £150,000; but, without going into
particulars, Sam said it was "somewhere about ten thousand a-year."
His family had always regarded Sam as a drain&mdash;as so much a
year out of pocket; the reader therefore may conclude that his
avowal of such affluent circumstances was listened to with
considerable satisfaction.</p>

<p>Sam brought with him to London an order on Denison, Heywood,
Kenneth, &amp; Co., for £9350, the balance of his account with the
Yorkshire banker, and this amount was placed to a floating credit.
There was no house vacant at the time in Portland Place; but Sam
had set his heart upon that locality, and went into lodgings for a
month or six weeks, when he was accommodated with a very desirable
residence, lately occupied by a gentleman who was going abroad for
the benefit of his health. Gillow furnished it in a remarkably neat
manner; and Blew (whose discharge was purchased by Sam), was
ordered to take care of everything, and see that nothing was
spoilt.</p>

<p>Freeport was at one time very fond of driving, but he had Mrs.
Missevery's carriage and horses sent to London, and therefore he
never appeared except in a heavy landau, and a handsomer turn-out
was not to be met with in the Park. Before long Sam Freeport's
house was an <i>"open"</i> one in all conscience. It was the
rendezvous of nearly all the young officers about town. When Sam
was there, he welcomed them heartily; when he was not, Blew did the
needful. A dowager duchess with an immense jointure, or a very rich
heiress, was constantly flitting before him; but somehow or other
Freeport could never see a pretty face without falling violently in
love with it, and no man ever suffered more from a multiplicity of
affections. In less than four months Sam had proposed to seven
ladies, and was accepted by every one; but, to use his own phrase,
"a hitch about the settlements, or <i>something or other,</i>"
always stood in the way of his happiness, and, as far as matrimony
was concerned, a fatality was hanging over him.</p>

<p>In all other matters Freeport had a run of luck which was almost
too great for credence. Without the slightest idea of the
<i>game</i> of whist, he would cut in at a table, and against the
best play win almost every rubber, holding three or four honours
every other deal. At races, he would back a horse against the
field, because he fancied the name, and as sure as fate the animal
he selected would win. If a picture, or anything else, were knocked
down to him at an auction, somebody would offer him something for
his bargain. He would take five at billiards from a man who was
able to give him twenty, and win the game by a succession of crows.
Even in the most trifling things he was the luckiest fellow living.
If, by accident, he knocked the lightest of claret glasses off the
table, it would be taken up unbroken. If, from an exuberance of
animal spirits, he "bonneted" a man at a fair, no one ever seemed
to see him do it, and somebody else was sure to get attacked by the
party who found himself aggrieved. If he happened to get into a
scrape, he had always at command some speech by which he was
immediately exempt from the consequences of his transgression.</p>

<p>One night Sam went alone to the Surrey Theatre, and took a
private box all to himself&mdash;on the second tier of
boxes&mdash;that he might gaze on an actress without interruption
or remark. In those days, the Surrey was lighted up with oil. The
lamp immediately opposite to Freeport was as dull as an oil lamp
could be, and fancying that it was "a patent screwing-up affair,"
Sam leant forward and began to screw away most vigorously. He
screwed, and screwed, but without effect; and at length he capsized
the oil, which trickled down into the pit, and caused a fearful
commotion amongst the respectable part of the community therein
seated. Loud were the cries of "Shame! shame!" "What are you at,
sir?" "Turn him out." "Blackguard!" "Where's the police?" When
Freeport saw the eyes of the nation, as it were, upon him, he
laughed convulsively, which made him shake the lamp the more, and
the oily shower was thereby increased. The manager of the Surrey
very soon appeared, expostulated in extremely indignant terms, and
requested to know who Sam was.</p>

<p>"Are you ignorant, sir, who I am?" inquired Sam.</p>

<p>"I am," said the manager.</p>

<p>"Then, sir, that circumstance alone," rejoined Sam, "induces me
to look over the abrupt and uncourteous nature of your conduct and
address. <i>I am the Solicitor-General, sir.</i> I came here to
admire the acting for which this theatre is becoming famous; but
the lights and the language are of a nature which certainly do not
meet with my approval, and if the Lord Chamberlain does not take
away your licence, it will not be for the want of
representation."</p>

<p>The manager begged Sam not to be hasty, and said it was a
mistake and a misunderstanding&mdash;that the house was going to be
lighted with gas&mdash;that Miss Vincent was going to be
engaged&mdash;that "THE WOOD DEMON" was soon coming out, and he
hoped that the Solicitor-General would not take offence.</p>

<p>"Under these circumstances," said Sam, in the gravest manner
possible, "of course the case is altered. No man has the drama more
at heart than I have. I glory in the drama. I do, upon my honour.
They may talk as they please about <i>suo sibi gladio,</i> but the
drama is a nationality. Come to my chambers, in King's Bench Walk,
to-morrow, and I may give you an idea or two on this subject which
may be of use to you."</p>

<p>The manager bowed, said he felt highly gratified that the
Solicitor-General was so kind, and that he would not fail to avail
himself of so distinguished a compliment.</p>

</h2>

<p>GEORGE HARROWAY'S mother was extremely disgusted at the idea of
her son having married the daughter of a country attorney, and she
endeavoured to suppress the "occurrence" in the <i>Times</i> and
the <i>Chronicle,</i> and the paper published at Bath, where she
resided. She had no notion, nor could she have been made to
understand, that in the county where her son married, he, with his
£6,000 a-year, was looked upon as a mere cypher, or nonentity,
while Anne Newsham was the favourite of all the most important
personages. The Earl of Lingfield had given up his house to the
young couple for their honeymoon, and had gone to stay at
Wipley&mdash;and "confound the little minx for saying she would
never marry to be an old man's nurse!"</p>

<p>Harroway asked his wife one morning to read the newspapers to
him. This was a favourite employment of Anne's, and George loved to
listen to her remarks. She took up the <i>Morning Post,</i> and
found it full of Captain Freeport of the&mdash;&mdash;Foot. It was
"understood (so the editor probably heard from Sam's own lips) that
Captain Freeport would stand for Middlesex."</p>

<p>It was "<i>not</i> true that Captain Freeport was one of the
eight in the forthcoming match on the Thames. That gentleman
proposed to leave London for Paris on the 24th instant."</p>

<p>"Stanhope Leicester, Esq., has been appointed a member of the
committee for adjudging the prizes at the Smithfield Cattle Show,
in the room of Captain Freeport, who will be absent from the
metropolis when the show takes place."</p>

<p>"Anne, dear, you are inventing?" cried Harroway.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I am not, George," she replied. "And here he is again!
<i>Bell's Life</i> informs us that the famous match at billiards,
between Major Warde and Captain Freeport, and on which such heavy
stakes were pending, was won by the latter officer, who in the last
game scored 42, running, off the red ball."</p>

<p>"There's nothing else worth reading in this paper," said Anne.
"Give me the <i>Chronicle,</i> George." After perusing it for a few
minutes, she exclaimed, "Why, George, here's more of Freeport, and
probably this accounts for his trip to Paris. 'We are given to
understand that an action for breach of promise of marriage will
shortly be tried in the court of Queen's Bench. The plaintiff is
the widow of a deceased alderman, and the defendant a captain in
the army, well known in the sporting world, and famous for his
unbounded hospitality. Serjeant Wilde and Mr. Campbell are retained
for the plaintiff. The Solicitor-General, Mr. Maule, Mr. Thesiger,
and several other gentlemen whose names we have not heard, for the
defendant.'"</p>

<p>The above was scarcely read, when the letter-bag was handed over
to George. There was an epistle from Freeport himself. The seal was
broken hastily.</p>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:5%">"MY DEAR GEORGE,<br>
<br>
Now, don't laugh at what I am going to tell you, for it is a very
serious business. I am up to my ears and eyes in a law suit, and am
now off for Paris. If it goes against me, which it may, you know,
I'm an exiled man for ever. The fact is this,&mdash;I proposed to
an elderly lady, whom I first saw at my brother's house. The whole
thing was a lark from beginning to end. I did it to satisfy my
brother's wife that the old lady's grief for her late husband, who
has only been dead three months, was all moonshine. However, I have
engaged no end of lawyers, and if they don't bring me through, I'll
never trust a lawyer again. I wish you could get Newsham to come up
here and manage it; for these London fellows are so horribly
dilatory, and seem to take no interest in a fellow's concerns. If I
get clear of this, I'll never speak to a woman again, young or old.
Tell your wife that this creature, who fancied I was in earnest, is
as ugly as the old woman under the sofa. The misfortune is, that
they all suppose I have ten thousand a-year, and if they go and
give damages in proportion, I shall be left without a sixpence.
Already have I paid away to these lawyer fellows £500 in
fees&mdash;only fancy, eh?<br>
<br>
"Tell Newsham he must come up to be my friend. He will find
everything comfortable in my house, where I have left Blew in
charge. Ask him if they can seize the furniture, &amp;c. The tiara
of diamonds and emeralds I've got with me. They'll not get that, I
warrant 'em. I took on that tiara as a talisman of good luck which
I'll never part with.<br>
<br>
With best love to your wife, believe me your affectionate friend in
trouble at present, "<br>
<br>
S. Freeport.<br>
<br>
"P.S.&mdash;My address is Meurice's Hotel, Paris."</p>
<br>

<p>This letter was enclosed to Newsham, who was very fond of
showing his importance, and who wanted at that moment to go to
London. He wrote to Sam for a power of attorney, which Sam very
readily and gladly gave him, and thanked him at the same time for
yielding to his entreaties.</p>

<p>Harroway and his wife were strolling round the grounds one clear
cold evening. The former had his gun with him, to shoot a hawk
which had made sad havoc amongst the earl's tumbler pigeons. The
gun was on half cock, but by some accident it went off, and the
whole contents of the barrel passed through the body of Anne's
Scotch terrier, and killed him. The dog was a great favourite with
every one&mdash;it was such a sharp and clever looking dog. Anne
was sorely distressed at his fate; but the more distressed at what
she thought was their bad luck. This feeling took so strong a hold
of her, that the once bold Anne Newsham was now quite timid. She
lost her nerve, even on horseback, and she feared to allow her
husband out of her sight.</p>

<p>"It may be this <i>place</i> that is unlucky, George," she said.
"Let us leave it, and go back to York."</p>

<p>Harroway yielded, and they returned to occupy a house he had
rented equi-distant from Newsham's and the barracks. But the
locality, it seemed, had nothing to do with their luck.</p>

<p>About two o'clock one morning&mdash;before they had been settled
a week&mdash;the house was discovered to be on fire, and it was
with the greatest difficulty that Harroway and his wife got down
the staircase, which was in flames. They lost nearly everything
that was of a perishable nature, but George only laughed at this,
to dissipate the gloom which the accident cast over Anne's once
bright face.</p>

<p>"What nonsense it is to cry over trifles," he would exclaim,
"and talk about bad luck. These things happen to other people, and
why should they not happen to us?"</p>

<p>Harroway obtained leave, and they went to spend a few days with
an old bachelor, who lived a short distance from the city, until
another abode was got ready for them.</p>

<p>On the estate was a small lake, and there was a small boat for
the amusement of those who were fond of rowing. George induced Anne
to get into the boat, and he rowed round the margin. When they
returned, he discovered that he had lost a little plain gold ring,
which his wife had placed on his finger the day they were married,
requesting him at the time never to remove it without her
permission. It was impossible to conceal the loss from her. She
missed it, and asked what had become of it. Harroway told the
truth, and Anne was miserable.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a>
</h2>

<p>NEWSHAM arrived in London, and settled himself in Captain
Freeport's mansion in Portland Place. Blew was all civility, and
gave a very disparaging account of everybody on earth, except his
master, who was (he said) a perfect gem of a man&mdash;without
fault or blemish. Acting on the power of attorney, Newsham very
soon took the case out of the London attorney's hands, and he
wouldn't have anything to say to any of the counsel then employed,
because none of them had ever gone the northern circuit, and
consequently "didn't know what sharpness meant."</p>

<p>He admitted that the case was a very bad one, and that on "the
merits" Freeport stood no more chance than a cat without claws.
<i>"But,"</i> said Newsham, to himself, "if Billy Snuffles does not
take a fatal legal objection before the case is closed, I'll eat my
own head off."</p>

<p>The person spoken of as Billy Snuffles was the best black letter
lawyer in England. He was a man of great talent, and had an immense
practice; and no man ever had such luck in his profession. It was
quite equal to his client's luck at cards or billiards. Newsham had
first brought him into notice, and had been his constant friend for
many years. Snuffles (he was never known by any other name) said
Sam's letters to the lady were very strong and positive indeed, and
he could not see how on earth they were to be "rebutted." "But,
Newsham," said he, "a case is not lost till it is won, and in the
course of our experience we have seen some queer things turn
up."</p>

<p>"We have indeed," replied Newsham, "and I sincerely hope we
shall do 'em in this. We must watch and hope; give 'em their
tether, and let 'em go on."</p>

<p>The day of trial came on. The Attorney-General made a most
brilliant speech, and earned his hundred guineas well. He
represented his client as a lady of great personal charms and
varied accomplishments, and the widow of a gentleman of rank.
Freeport was described as "a most inhuman person"&mdash;as a
"trifler with the feelings of innocence"&mdash;"a man revelling in
wealth, and gloating over the impunity which it gives to the
possessor."</p>

<p>Sam's letters were then read and commented upon, and they caused
no little laughter from the bench, the bar, the jury, and the
public&mdash;the expressions were so curious. As for Newsham, who
knew Sam well, he could scarcely do his duty&mdash;he giggled
so.</p>

<p>The awful time came for the defence. Snuffles looked at Newsham,
and Newsham looked at Snuffles, who, by instinct, as it were, said
to the bench, "My Lords, I think there is no case to go to the
jury." He then turned over the leaves of his brief, on which he had
taken notes, and suddenly muttered to himself, "I thought not."</p>

<p>"May it please your Lordships," said Snuffles, "there is no
proof whatever of my client having refused to marry this lady; and
if she's the delightful creature described by my learned friend, I
doubt not he would marry her to-morrow."</p>

<p>Hereupon there was a terrible commotion amongst the wigged
heads, and some chuckling on the part of Newsham. A fierce argument
then took place, which resulted in the following judgment from the
Lord Chief Justice:&mdash;"We are of opinion that the plaintiff
must be <i>nonsuited.</i> The letters of Captain Freeport are
certainly evasive, and many persons would glean that he never
intended to marry the plaintiff; or if he ever did so intend, he
had changed his mind. At the same time, that is not sufficient for
the Court. Proof of refusal is necessary; and proof of refusal we
have none. The plaintiff asks the defendant when he intends to
perform his promise. The defendant, in reply, says, 'My love, what
do you say to joining a pleasure party to Margate?' The lady's
solicitor then addresses the defendant, and the defendant tells him
he is 'astonished at his impudence.' It would be monstrous to
torture this into evidence of refusal. The plaintiff must be
<i>nonsuited.</i>"</p>

<p>"Has the master won it, sir?" inquired Blew, quite pale with
anxiety, when Newsham came out of court.</p>

<p>"Of course!" replied Newsham. "What do you suppose I came up
from Yorkshire for?"</p>

<p>"Long life to you!" cried Blew. "Your equal is not to be met
among any of these blackguards who have been a pursuing of him. The
captain himself must have thought it hopeless, or never would he
have fled the kingdom. He's game to the backbone; though I must
confess he was awfully cast down when they took him into court
about the business."</p>

<p>Sam came back from Paris post haste, and embraced Newsham, whom
he called his "deliverer."</p>

<p>"How did you manage it, Newsham, eh!" asked Sam.</p>

<p>"It was Lombard-street to a China orange," replied Newsham, out
of breath from the violence of Sam's embrace.</p>

<p>"I wish the old girl was Lombard-street," said Sam. "We should
have no more law suits, Newsham. I'm blowed if we should. Look
here, Newsham. Have they made you comfortable, old boy? It was not
the act of an insane person to send for <i>you</i>&mdash;was it?
Look here. You said once you'd put a restraint on my actions. I
wish to heaven you could put a restraint on everybody else's
actions. By Jove, that Lord Denman looks as if he'd transport a man
without remorse, and cast a poor devil in damages, just for a lark.
What's the meaning of their wearing those big wigs? What about
George? How does he get on? Have they had a fight yet, or do they
continue to coo like turtle doves? It was a great mistake in Anne
not marrying me. How rosy you look, old boy! One would fancy you
had been to Paris, where everybody paints and makes themselves up.
Look at me. I'm now a perfect mass of rouge, and <i>cosmetique,</i>
and black, and pearl powder, and I don't know what all. I never saw
such pockets as they've got to their billiard tables; not bigger
than the top of that inkstand&mdash;just the size of the ball. I
had not a chance. Lost every game. Luckily, I didn't bet. Let's
have dinner, Newsham."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a>
</h2>

<p>HARROWAY had been married three months, when one morning, after
parade, he heard the major casually remark, "I am very sorry to
hear that Mr. Glenworthy, the great banker, has destroyed
himself."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said some one else. "What's the meaning of that?"</p>

<p>"They say," replied the major, "that the bank must go; they have
rather overdone the thing."</p>

<p>Harroway was interested in this bank&mdash;that is to say, he
was a proprietor to the extent of one year's saving from his
income; but so close was he respecting his private affairs, he did
not join in the conversation, further than remarking, "Poor fellow!
I am very sorry to hear it."</p>

<p>Instead of going home to his wife, George Harroway went to
Newsham's. He found the old man absent and fidgety, and unusually
incoherent in his replies, and what appeared very odd to Harroway,
was that Newsham regarded the self-destruction of the best client
he ever had as a mere matter of course.</p>

<p>"I hope there is no truth in the report that the bank is likely
to break, for I should not like to lose that £4,500" said
George.</p>

<p>"Oh dear, no!" said Newsham. "Oh dear, no! quite
safe&mdash;quite safe!"</p>

<p>The old man fixed his little sharp grey eye upon his son-in-law,
and, after vacantly staring at him for at least a minute, burst
into tears, and covered his face with his hands.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked George.</p>

<p>"Oh God!" said Newsham, pressing his forehead, while the tears
rolled down his cheeks, "this is worse than all!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" inquired Harroway.</p>

<p>"You will soon know. Too soon, I fear. I can never survive
it."</p>

<p>"If you mean that the bank has gone, or is going," said
Harroway, "you need not let that trouble you. Your interest is not
greater than mine; and a loss twice as great might very easily be
survived. It is a bore to lose money in this way; but it can't be
helped. Those who venture should be prepared for kicks sometimes,
as well as halfpence."</p>

<p>"God help you!" cried the old man. "Don't curse me!"</p>

<p>Newsham looked twenty years older in the space of an hour. He
was a very young-looking man for his age; but suddenly he seemed to
break up, and become grey-headed. Harroway observed this wonderful
change, and begged him to open his heart.</p>

<p>"Know the worst at once!" cried the old man. "The bank has
gone&mdash;crash&mdash;I am ruined! And we all are ruined! And you
are ruined!" He could say no more; his head fell upon his chest,
and he seemed stupid with his own reflections.</p>

<p>Harroway was hurt for the old man's sake, but he did not
understand how he himself could be ruined. The bulk of his property
was "all safe in government funds." He roused the old man, and
begged him to explain. But all he could elicit was
this,&mdash;"They will take out judgment against the
wealthiest."</p>

<p>The phrase was unintelligible to the young man, and he proceeded
to question further, but to no purpose.</p>

<p>Newsham became like a madman, and Harroway wrote a note to Anne,
who was always looked up to in cases of difficulty, to come
immediately. Anne came, and found her father quite childish. He
laughed, and then wept, and then laughed again. She thought he had
been drinking, and was surprised; for it was not Newsham's wont to
indulge during the day.</p>

<p>"He says we are all ruined," said George.</p>

<p>The old man clutched a letter which he drew from his waistcoat
pocket, and this letter Anne contrived to snatch from her father's
hand. With eager eyes she read as follows:&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:5%">"Newsham, these are the last lines my pen
will ever write. I cannot live to see the awful wreck which is so
close at hand, and the ruin of all those who are nearest and
dearest to me&mdash;friends, relatives, and connexions. The fault
is all mine. Poor dear Anne. Her husband's all, to go in this way!
I am glad I never saw his face. Farewell Newsham."</p>
<br>

<p>"This is from Mr. Glenworthy," said Anne. "What can it
mean?"</p>

<p>"He has destroyed himself," said George, "and your father says
the bank has gone. I had only £4500 there. How does he make out I
lose my all?"</p>

<p>The old man smiled, and then shut his eyes.</p>

<p>Anne, who had often listened to discussions about the
responsibility of parties, saw it at once, and she said in a solemn
tone&mdash;"Then, George, we <i>are</i> ruined! All <i>is</i> gone!
I felt this was impending!"</p>

<p>George Harroway turned deathly pale. He had an hereditary
fondness for wealth, and knew the importance attached to it. Far
from being purse-proud, he inwardly rejoined in the knowledge that
he was worth much money. To hear that it was all gone&mdash;to
suspect only that it was in danger&mdash;was too fearful a blow to
bear up against. He seated himself in a large chair, clutched the
arms of it, and looked perfectly aghast. His wife knelt before him,
and begged him to listen to her&mdash;to act like a man&mdash;but
he seemed deaf and dumb. His senses were apparently in complete
abeyance. In vain did she say to him, "George, dear, I have been
the cause of this misfortune; had it not been for me, you would
never have risked your fortune thus, and lost it; but you are still
young, George, and bright days may yet be in store for us. The loss
of your riches ought not to diminish your happiness. So long as we
have enough to live upon, we can fancy we have countless heaps of
gold. Speak to me, George, and help me to give some consolation to
my poor old father, who, at his age, will have to begin life anew
in poverty. We shall be better off than many of our neighbours, for
we do not stand alone in this calamity. The man who has destroyed
himself has left behind him a wife and thirteen children, who never
knew what it was to have whim or wish ungratified. George, do not
stare so unmeaningly."</p>

<p>This last sentence caught Harroway's ear, and he replied, "Anne,
dear, you told me once you had a horror of poverty. Well do I
remember that."</p>

<p>"True!" she cried, clutching his arm, and looking into his eyes
to rivet the attention she had aroused. "True, George. But then I
thought it was far off. Now that it is near, George, I can laugh at
its horrors. For me it has no horrors. As the inhabitant of a
wretched hovel with you, I could be as happy as though the walls of
a palace surrounded us. Whatever be our fate, let us battle with
it, George, dear."</p>

<p>"Good girl!" said old Newsham, proudly, moved by her firm voice
and the courage she showed&mdash;"brave girl! You are worth a
thousand fortunes&mdash;even such as mine, which was twice as great
as his, though nobody knew it but myself and that poor man who is
now no more."</p>

<p>Harroway was equally struck with the courage of his wife, and
embracing her, he called on God to spare her unto him so long as he
should live.</p>

<p>* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Sam Freeport carried on faster than ever, after his return from
Paris. He sent for a French cook, whose dishes were the admiration
of the best qualified judges. Of his wines there never was any
other opinion than that they were unexceptionable.</p>

<p>But Freeport became tired of hearing himself called "that
excellent fellow, Sam." The life palled on him, and at length he
preferred the conversation with Blew about old times, to that of
any of his numerous visitors.</p>

<p>"It's a great bore, Blew, to be a man of fortune," said Sam one
morning. "I don't feel half so happy as when I had not a sixpence,
and had to tax my wits how to raise the wind for current expenses.
If the old regiment was not ordered out to Bangalore, or some such
place or other in the East, I think I'd try and get back."</p>

<p>"How would you manage with the colonel, sir?"</p>

<p>"Oh! as for that, I could soon manage. I could get the servant
maid to say I saved the child's life, by preventing a mad dog from
attacking her&mdash;and they'd yearn towards me instanter."</p>

<p>"London is not a very nice place, after all, sir," suggested
Blew. "I think you would like Belfast much better, sir."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," rejoined Sam. "It is not the place. One is
just the same to me as another. It is the regiment, Blew. It is the
mess&mdash;wherever that is, that's the place for me. I
was&mdash;let me see&mdash;16 from&mdash;27&mdash;that's eleven
years with the regiment, and no man was ever so much loved in it.
If I can manage it, Blew, I'll go back. What do you say, will you
take to pipe-clay again, eh?"</p>

<p>"Wherever you go, I'll follow, sir. But I'll never 'list again,
sir. If the regiment is going to Bangylower, sir, you'd better
change your mind, and get into the regiment that's at Belfast.
You'd be delighted with Belfast, sir. The Belfast ladies is the
beautifullest ladies in the whole world, sir, with their dark blue
eyes, and their nut brown hair, and their ivory teeth, and their
little mouths."</p>

<p>"Don't go on any more about them," said Sam, "or you'll make me
break my vow, never to have anything to say to them again. Besides,
the ladies are very handsome in the Indies, or else the pictures of
'em don't speak the truth."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, it don't signify to me. Wherever you go, there will
your faithful servant Blew be in attendance. I'm so used to the
irregular life you have led me for the last nine years, that any
other life would be the death of me."</p>

<p>Freeport was a man who never pondered. When an idea came into
his head, he carried it out at once. Blew was therefore requested
to call in the bills&mdash;to let the house for the remainder of
the term&mdash;and put everything in train for a start to any part
of the world, on a day's notice.</p>

<p>Sam had been seven months in town, and in that time had parted
with more than half of his money; and it was doubtful whether the
residue would cover his outstanding debts. He had no Horse Guards
interest himself; but his brother knew several persons who had, and
they were always glad to exert it whenever called upon to do
so.</p>

<p>Sam paid his elder brother a visit one morning&mdash;the first
since the trial, and was about to unbosom himself, and tell the
whole truth, when his brother, with a solemn face remarked, that it
was "a bad look out for poor young Harroway?"</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Sam. "Has Anne bolted, or what? She
was a rum girl, and I'm quite satisfied she never loved
<i>him.</i>" Here he looked at himself in the glass.</p>

<p>"No, poor fellow!" said Sam's elder brother. "He has not only
lost everything, but he is hunted to death by bailiffs."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" ejaculated Sam. "How's that? George was beastly
rich, and a most careful fellow, too."</p>

<p>"He lost it by the failure of a Joint Stock Bank. One of your
imperial affairs, Sam."</p>

<p>"Not the Bank that Newsham is concerned in?"</p>

<p>"The same!"</p>

<p>"Has it broke?" inquired Sam, with well feigned anxiety.</p>

<p>"Yes. Didn't you see it in the papers?"</p>

<p>"Oh, heavens!" exclaimed Sam,&mdash;reeling towards the
couch&mdash;"then I'm a ruined man!"</p>

<p>"I hope you had nothing in it, Sam?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes. Everything was there deposited at interest. Oh
Edward! this is an awful business. You have turned me deadly faint.
Let me have a glass of Madeira. Is there no remedy against a bank
that breaks?"</p>

<p>Sam's brother's heart palpitated fiercely when he heard this;
but as Sam seemed so dreadfully cut up, he thought it as well to
console him by saying he would not lose all, and that eventually it
would be recovered from the proprietors.</p>

<p>"Eventually!" whined Sam. "That's all very well, but what am I
to do in the mean time? starve, or what? Can I live upon my half
pay?"</p>

<p>"No, Sam, you need not starve. You can very easily get upon full
pay again, and until the first instalment is paid you from the bank
proprietors, Robert and myself will make you some allowance, which
you can refund."</p>

<p>"It's an awful business!" murmured Sam, burying his head in the
sofa pillows. "But thank Heaven it is no worse! Poor George
Harroway! I pity him from the very bottom of my heart!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a>
</h2>

<p>HARROWAY quietly gave up all that he had, as soon as he found it
would be taken away from him by legal process. An estate which was
left to his mother for life had been settled upon Anne. It was
situated near the New Forest, and though it was very extensive, it
was not very profitable. His mother had some five or six hundred a
year besides; but then she was in debt, and in absolute want of
ready money;&mdash;so much so, that she had been compelled to rent
the estate and reside in Bath.</p>

<p>Harroway, for months, lived in constant dread of being arrested
and taken to prison to satisfy some of the <i>new</i> creditors who
were springing up in all directions and parts of the kingdom.
Newsham's household property was sold off, and the old man went for
a season to York Castle. Every one that Newsham had any influence
over,&mdash;and their name was legion&mdash;was in the same
condition as himself&mdash;penniless&mdash;and beggared. Mrs.
Newsham and her three unmarried daughters went to Liverpool.</p>

<p>"Really, George, dear," said Anne, one night (as she sat mending
George's socks, over a tallow candle), "we are not so badly off,
after all. Poverty is not half so bad as I took it to be&mdash;as
far as I can see, it only teaches us what we can do
without&mdash;for my part, I am quite as happy in this merino dress
as I should be in the most expensive velvet&mdash;and although this
light is not so bright as it might be," (she snuffed it as she
spoke,) "yet it brings us much nearer together, for we have both to
get near to it&mdash;you to read and I to sew. It was a kind act of
my old god-father to buy our books and give them to us&mdash;for we
seem to read them with twice the pleasure. George, I bought you
some cigars to-day&mdash;for it is a curious thing, whenever you
smoke I never have the toothache. I dare say you will think this
very selfish in me; but really, George, if you knew what I suffered
from my teeth, you would forgive me. You will find them on the
sideboard yonder, dearest. I wish you would begin, for I felt a
twinge just now."</p>

<p>Harroway was quick enough to see that Anne's reason for buying
cigars was not dictated by selfishness. But he would not dispel the
pleasure he could see she felt in practising this innocent
deception, and he readily complied with her wishes. As he lighted
the cigar with a coal, which he took up with the tongs, a tear
glistened in each eye&mdash;a tear of gratitude to fate, which,
while it robbed him of all his worldly goods, had given him an
equivalent in a woman whom he could love, honour, and respect.</p>

<p>"There's one thing, George," continued Anne, "which annoys me
beyond description; and I shall not be sorry when the day arrives
for us to leave England for another country, where no one will know
anything about us. What I allude to is being regarded with pity by
so many people. I detest being pitied; it makes my blood boil with
rage. I remember one day rushing an old horse at a bank which was
too much for him; and the beast came down, and gave me the most
flying purl I ever had in my life. I sprained my ankle very
severely, and hurt my left hand; but the pain was nothing like so
bad as what I felt on hearing some person say, <i>Poor thing!</i>
There's something so dreadfully humiliating in being called 'Poor
thing,' or 'Poor creature.' I would much rather have a slap in the
face. I think, if I was a man, I would strike any person who pitied
me. '<i>Poor</i> Mrs. Harroway!'" she imitated a lady of their
acquaintance. "Only fancy that coming from a woman who has a
disgusting dwarf for a husband, whom I would not be united to for
fifty thousand a-year&mdash;an ill-nurtured, peevish, jealous,
unpopular creature&mdash;much more like a ragged, knock-knee'd pony
than a man. '<i>Poor</i> Mrs. Harroway!'"</p>

<p>"Hark, dear!" cried Harroway, half frightened. "There's some one
below. Listen! he said <i>'Where is he?'</i> I hope they will never
separate us."</p>

<p>"That they shall <i>never</i> do, George," said Anne. "We will
go together."</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door.</p>

<p>Anne called out in a firm voice, "Come in;" and she drew herself
up to face whoever it might be.</p>

<p>The door was partially opened, and a head appeared, whence
issued, in a deep bass voice,</p>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:10%">"I know a bank whereon the wild thyme
grows."</p>
<br>

<p>"Come in, Sam," cried Harroway&mdash;(and Anne laughed
heartily). "What has brought you down here?"</p>

<p>"Fate, sir, Fate," was the reply. "Well, sister Anne, I am glad
to see you looking cozy and comfortable over a mutton fat. How are
you? What is it the poet says&mdash;contentment&mdash;joy&mdash;and
something or other, eh? Well, never mind. It will be all the same
in less than a hundred years."</p>

<p>Here Freeport slapped George on the back, and inquired what they
had had for dinner.</p>

<p>"Roast mutton," said Anne; "and we are going to have it cold
to-morrow, and hashed the day after."</p>

<p>"No you are not," said Sam. "I want to see it now. I am cruel
hungry. Have you any pickles?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Anne, "and George still drinks gin and water."</p>

<p>"Then we shall have a happy repast," said Sam; "and over it I
will tell you all about myself. Blew is outside&mdash;he'll get
everything ready, if your servants are out of the way. Don't get
up, sister Anne. My man knows where everything is kept by
instinct."</p>

<p>"We lock everything up now, Sam," said George. "I'll go and get
it out for you."</p>

<p>While Freeport was discussing the cold mutton and pickles, he
gave the Harroways to understand that in a few days he would be
gazetted to the old corps&mdash;that he had spent all his money,
and had done his brothers most beautifully. He declared that the
happiest moments he had spent since they parted were the present;
and the joyous expression of his countenance was sufficient to
satisfy them he spoke the truth. Sam voted an idle life a great
nuisance, a sentiment which amused Harroway vastly. He intended, he
said, to call on the colonel, and not take the slightest notice
that they had ever had any differences. "In short," said Sam, "I'll
write and ask him for a room in his house."</p>

<p>When Anne saw her husband's face overspread with
laughter,&mdash;when she heard him break out occasionally into a
roar, at the narration, by Sam, of scenes that he had taken a part
in, she was delighted that he had paid them a visit; and when
Freeport praised her father's ability, and said&mdash;"Mark my
words, if Newsham don't turn all this business to a good account,
and before five years pass away, accumulate no end of a
fortune,"&mdash;she was truly enchanted. These last observations
seemed to inspire Harroway with hopes, and he took another glass of
grog on the strength of them.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a>
</h2>

<p>ANNE retired, but Sam kept his friend up the whole night long.
From the next room Anne could hear them screaming with laughter.
She lay awake, listening to the noise, which was like the sweetest
music to her ears.</p>

<p>The following morning, while Harroway and his wife, and
Freeport, were at breakfast, Blew came into the room, and said to
his master, "There's an ill-looking thief, sir&mdash;I beg your
pardon, ma'm, for using the expression (he looked at
Anne)&mdash;prowlin' about the premises, with B-A-Y-L-E-A-F marked
on his ugly countenance."</p>

<p>"With what, Blew?"</p>

<p>"Bailiff, sir&mdash;I'd take an oath of it."</p>

<p>"What makes you think that?" asked Sam.</p>

<p>"Why, sir, he's got one of those netted comforters on his neck,
and he's got one of those thick fusten shootin' coats. But,
however, sir, I'd swear he was a bailiff, if it was only by his
high-lows&mdash;they are laced nattily up the front, with leather
strings, sir."</p>

<p>"Look here, Blew!" said Sam, handing him a large carving
fork&mdash;"just mount guard at the door, and see that he does not
come in here for the next quarter of an hour."</p>

<p>"Faith, I'll not let him in for the next twelve-month, if it
comes to that," said Blew, who left the room, and seated himself on
the top stair, where he hummed&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:10%">"O say, thou dear possessor of my
breast!<br>
Where's now my boasted liberty and rest?<br>
Where those gay moments which I once have known<br>
And where that heart I fondly thought my own?<br>
<br>
"From place to place I solitary roam,<br>
Abroad uneasy, nor content at home,<br>
I scorn the beauties other eyes adore&mdash;<br>
The more I view them, think thine own the more."</p>
<br>

<p>When Blew left the room, Harroway put down his knife and fork,
looked up at the ceiling, and groaned heavily.</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of that?" asked Sam. "Surely, you don't funk
a bailiff? Lord, man, they're nothing, when you are used to
'em."</p>

<p>"Mr. Harroway does not funk a bailiff, or anything else, Captain
Freeport," said Anne, taking up Sam rather too sharply, considering
she was his hostess. "But you'll recollect, Captain Freeport, that
Mr. Harroway is a married man, and not quite so selfish as the rest
of the world. He knows that to be taken away from this would annoy
me, and therefore the chance of it annoys him."</p>

<p>"Well, if he doesn't funk, why should he make that disagreeable,
dismal noise?"</p>

<p>Harroway saw the blood rushing into his wife's cheeks&mdash;the
veins in the neck swelling&mdash;and the eyelids moving quickly,
preparatory to an outbreak; and he placed his hand gently on her
arm, and said, "Anne, dearest, don't dispute. Sam is quite right. I
<i>do</i> funk these fellows. They worry my soul out."</p>

<p>"And you shall laugh at 'em, old George," said Sam, tapping him
significantly on the shoulder, and winking his left eye. "Listen to
me, Mrs. Harroway, and you are all right."</p>

<p>When the colour was receding from Anne's cheeks, and gradually
diffusing itself&mdash;when she was changing from anger to
gratitude&mdash;when she saw that Freeport knew George's failing as
well as herself, and that his object was to cheer and aid
him&mdash;her face was perfectly beautiful&mdash;the eyes were
heavenly.</p>

<p>"Look here," continued Sam, "you don't know that fellow Blew,
Mrs. Harroway. He is one of the most invaluable men that ever
served his country or a master. I'll be bound to say that that man
will know before to-morrow morning what officer in the corps has
the best shirts and pocket-handkerchiefs, and I shall never be at a
loss for a respectable get-up in that particular. I leave
everything to Blew. He's worth £200 a year to me."</p>

<p>One recollection flashed across George's mind; and
notwithstanding he <i>did</i> funk the bailiff, he fell back in his
chair and laughed hysterically, and his wife did the like at the
bare idea that a man could be so consummately cool, and have the
face to confess it.</p>

<p>"Irish linen&mdash;Scotch cambric&mdash;book muslin&mdash;such
an assortment, eh, George?"</p>

<p>"Sam! Sam! Do leave off, or you'll be the death of me," laughed
George.</p>

<p>"It's all right," responded Freeport. "Blew would never let the
fellow in without orders. You know, he'd poke his eye out with that
fork just as soon as look at him. Now, then, look here. Not one
minute before Blew came in, I had made up my mind to go to the
mess, after breakfast, and get two bottles of our old Madeira, and
take them down to the castle, and spend the day with
Newsham&mdash;talk about the beastly past and a better future, and
cheer the old man's heart up."</p>

<p>Poor Anne burst into tears. The kindly feeling that accompanied
Sam's words was too much for her.</p>

<p>"Come! come!" cried Sam&mdash;"none of this. I don't funk
bailiffs, or anything of that sort; but, by Jove! to see a woman
like you shed tears turns me regularly topsy-turvy."</p>

<p>Sam's large blue eyes distilled several drops; but he ate a
radish savagely, and looked at his plate, so that they were unseen
by those who sat at table with him.</p>

<p>After a brief pause, Sam began again: "Look here, George, you
and sister Anne had better leave this to-night, at about eight
o'clock. Post over to Wakefield, and go on to Barnsly; there rest a
day, and then take the coach up to London. The colonel will give
you leave, for he never denied any man a reasonable request in his
life. The regiment leaves England in two months, and you can live
quietly in ambush till then. At about twelve o'clock, I will put on
your blue frock coat, and go out. As soon as I see the bailiff,
I'll pretend to elude his grasp. He'll walk along side of me for a
minute or so, and when I look at him, he'll say, 'Mr. Harroway, I
wish to speak with you.' I'll mend my pace, and try to wind him.
He'll then <i>touch</i> me, George. I know these fellows so well,
you know. When he touches me, I'll stop. Then he'll show the writ,
and then I'll offer him a couple of sovereigns. That will insult
him; for no bailiff will take a tip lower than ten pound. After
some parley, I'll do the civil, and crave for a parting with my
wife. He'll grant this, in hopes of a glass of grog. When I return
you must pretend, sister Anne, to weep and be dreadfully downcast,
and I'll make a speech like the dying confession of a man going to
be hanged. When I am gone, let that be a signal for you two to be
off, as soon as you can get ready; but I'll write you a letter when
I am safely caged. Recollect, that in this corps we are all
brothers and sisters. We are the only family in the world that does
not quarrel; and the reason is, we never give each other cause
to.&mdash;Do we, George?"</p>

<p>"No, Sam, I am happy to say we never do. Your difference with
the colonel is the only one I can remember; and I hope, and verily
believe <i>that</i> even will blow over."</p>

<p>"Blow over!" echoed Freeport. "Blow over! I'd bet you ten
thousand a year&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The door opened, and a portly gentleman entered. Blew, with the
fork in his hand, and his eye on his master, closed it after
him.</p>

<p>It was the colonel. He walked up to Freeport and shook him by
the hand. "I knew you were here," said the colonel, "when I saw
that rascal Blew sitting on the stairs picking his teeth with a
carving fork. I am told you are to rejoin us; and believe me, my
dear Sam, when I say I am very happy to hear it."</p>

<p>"I was this moment, sir, about to pay my respects to yourself
and Mrs. Sneed; but circumstances of what they call 'an untoward'
or 'an unfroward' nature&mdash;which this boy Harroway can
explain&mdash;will, I fear, debar me that pleasure for some days to
come. Meanwhile, you will oblige me by conveying to Mrs. Sneed my
kindest remembrances and regards. I shall not be gazetted, sir,
till the 13th or 14th of next month."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a>
</h2>

<p>SAM was accosted by the bailiff, and eventually arrested; but
the offer of a bribe of two sovereigns was so great an insult that
Freeport was not allowed "the tender parting" he anticipated. He
was taken to the Castle forthwith, and the heavy doors closed upon
him. Sam expected to find Newsham dreadfully cast down and
dejected; but, to his surprise, he found the old man hard at work,
giving instructions to his head clerk.</p>

<p>"Well, old boy," said Sam, as soon as he was in Newsham's
presence, "who'd have thought of ever meeting with <i>you</i> in a
cage? I fancied you were much too knowing a bird to get caught, eh,
Newsham?"</p>

<p>"What, my dear friend, Freeport!" exclaimed the old man. "I am
very glad to see you. This is the place, Freeport, to test the
sincerity of friendship; and when I get out again, I shall be wiser
than I have been. It was very kind of you to come and see me. Sit
down."</p>

<p>"Not a bit kind," replied Sam. "I was brought here; arrested,
sir, in York, for £2500."</p>

<p>"Are you serious?"</p>

<p>"I am," whispered Sam in the old man's ear. "The bailiff took me
for George; they are going to start away for London to-night. When
they get there, I suppose I can easily get out of this?"</p>

<p>"Of course you can, and have a splendid action of trespass
against the sheriff into the bargain. Capital! capital! How were
they? Does my girl still keep her spirits up?"</p>

<p>"Doesn't she!" cried Sam. "She's much the best man of the two.
George's spirits departed with his gold!"</p>

<p>"It was an awful blow," said the old man, jauntily. "Just see
how grey it has made me. But we must make the best of it."</p>

<p>"Of course," ejaculated Sam. "It's a folly to talk of life's
troubles. There's always two sides of the way. I told 'em you would
turn it to account; and I know you will&mdash;wont you, old
fellow?"</p>

<p>Newsham smiled, and remarked, "If <i>I</i> don't, depend upon it
no one else can. We shall see. Why, within the last three days,"
whispered Newsham, confidentially, "I have shifted some £250,000
worth of responsibility from the shoulders of other people to my
own; and the certificate will rub off all that along with the rest.
By the bye, Freeport, all Mrs. Missevery's property, which was left
to you, went with that of others."</p>

<p>"What a lucky fellow I am," said Sam. "For if I had got it, I
should have left it to you to manage, and it would have been lost.
Now that just establishes my theory&mdash;namely, that a man like
me has no business with more than he absolutely wants. I don't mean
to say I should have cried about it; but I might, Newsham, you
know, and made myself unhappy; but as I never had it, why, of
course, I have no cause for lamentation. I gave it out, however,
that I was deeply involved; and when I write to my brother from
'York Castle,' I shall certainly get something for present
expenses&mdash;as a sort of consolation. What a rascally world this
is, to be sure, Newsham, eh? Swindling ought to be made legal in
this age."</p>

<p>"No, no, my good sir," said the old man, "you must not destroy
the fabric of business. The laws are all very well as they stand.
They require no sort of alteration. To try and mend the law, is to
make it worse."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose you know best," said Sam. "Let us have a glass
of Madeira, and then I'll go and stroll round the place, and let
you go on with your work. At what hour do you dine?"</p>

<p>"At the usual hour," said Newsham. "One or two people, who
expect future favours, are very attentive and supply my wants. You
will find lots of good company here, taking the air and exercise,
and the greater part of them abuse me. It is very natural they
should; but still it ought to teach us a lesson never to advise men
what to do with their money. If they are fortunate, you are the
wisest and best creature in the world; if they are
<i>un</i>fortunate, then you are the greatest rascal that ever
breathed, even if you lose as much as the whole of them put
together."</p>

<p>True enough, there was an abundance of company in the castle.
Men of all ages and ranks, and they all seemed to know each other.
Sam was a stranger in the crowd, but he did not long remain so. A
very old man, who stood about six feet two inches high, and whose
thick hair was as white as the driven snow, approached him, and
bowed in the most graceful and dignified manner imaginable.</p>

<p>"Have you ever been in a jail before?" inquired the old man,
with a pleasing inquisitiveness.</p>

<p>"Never, but I have often been devilish near it," returned Sam,
in his own peculiar quaint way.</p>

<p>The old man smiled, and said, "I am glad to see your troubles do
not sit heavily on your head, sir."</p>

<p>"I have not a trouble in the world," said Sam. "What's the use
of having troubles when they can be so easily removed by people
themselves?"</p>

<p>"That's the spirit of philosophy, sir," said the old man, "and I
wish I could impart it to these poor folks around. See what
dejection is everywhere visible! The only joy they have is when the
door opens to admit a companion in distress. Yonder stands a man,
with his eyes upon the ground, whom I have known for the last
twenty years. He was a very opulent corn factor. When I spoke to
him yesterday, he didn't recollect me. That poor youth, with his
hands in his empty pockets, is the son of a man who died immensely
rich. He represents one of the oldest families in the riding. The
boy inherited his father's gambling propensities, and has lost
everything. His heart seems broken."</p>

<p>"He could not have had any to break," observed Sam. "A stout,
burly-looking fellow like that taking on about losing money! He
ought to be ashamed of himself. I pity women and children who
suffer, but I don't pity the speculators at all."</p>

<p>"The man in the white top-coat, leaning against the wall, is a
great ironmonger," continued the old man. "His losses have driven
him to drink, and from the expression of his face, I should say he
was drunk now. His course, I fear, will be pursued by many."</p>

<p>"I am glad to say," said Sam, "I had nothing to do with it. I am
here as a security."</p>

<p>"I have been an inmate of these walls for the last four years,"
said the old man, "and I shall probably never get out of them. I
was a defaulter in my accounts, though I never knew what became of
the deficiency."</p>

<p>AWAY from his friends in the regiment, and domiciled in obscure
lodgings in the Edgeware Road, George Harroway began to mope. He
would look out upon the street, and stare for an hour together,
without speaking a word. Anne used to talk incessantly, but her wit
and vivacity began to lose their effect. He could not help laughing
at her remarks; but his face would relapse, almost immediately,
into that gloomy expression which seemed to have there settled
itself. Whenever they went out to walk, Anne led him wherever she
listed. "It is all the same to me," was his constant reply to her
questions.</p>

<p>One Sunday evening, they strolled towards the Serpentine.
Harroway cast his eyes upon the water and sighed. A tremor ran
through his wife's every vein, and a thousand horrible thoughts
crowded upon her. She employed all her art to get him to take a
part in a conversation; but notwithstanding that he said "Yes" and
"No" occasionally, it was very evident he was not listening to what
she said.</p>

<p>When they returned, Anne had the misfortune to break a small
looking glass. Her heart sunk within her when she beheld the
fragments on the floor. There is an old superstition in Yorkshire
that whoever breaks a looking-glass will be unlucky for seven
years. But she rallied, and went down to dinner with a face beaming
with smiles. Their means were very limited, for the paymaster was
the only person they could rely upon; nevertheless, George Harroway
insisted on sending to a neighbouring public house for a dozen of
port wine, and, for the first time since he had been married, he
got very drunk indeed. Anne thought little of this; but lo! the
next morning, immediately after breakfast, he opened, with his own
hand, another bottle, and took a draught out of a tumbler. His wife
remonstrated, and Harroway begged of her to "mind her own
business." Before five o'clock in the evening he was again
intoxicated, and talked like a madman. He accused Anne of being the
cause of all his misfortunes, in consequence of her reckless
extravagance and passion for gambling&mdash;her vanity in supposing
she knew anything about horses, and letting him in for £10,000 on
the last Derby. The poor girl had never betted in her life, beyond
a pair of gloves or a new bonnet, but still she admitted the truth
of all he declared, and kneeling beside him, as he lay upon the
couch, she implored his pardon for all her past imprudence, and
promised to behave better in future. This unqualified confession of
error soothed the excited mind of Harroway, and ere long he fell
asleep, and breathed the laboured breath of heavy intoxication.</p>

<p>Anne sat beside him, stitching her fingers off, and stifling her
sighs lest they should, by chance, disturb him.</p>

<p>At about eight o'clock there was a postman's rap at the door,
which awoke George Harroway, and startled his wife. The former
stared around the room in astonishment. Poor fellow, he had been
dreaming of other circumstances than those which oppressed him.
While his wife broke the seal of the letter, which was to her
address, George turned round and was about to compose himself once
more to slumber.</p>

<p>"George, George, dear!" she exclaimed. "Here is some luck at
last. Somebody has sent us a bank-note for £50."</p>

<p>"I'd bet it is a bad one. One of those d&mdash;&mdash;d imperial
affairs!" he grunted.</p>

<p>"No, dear George. Look at it. I wonder who it can be! Not a
word, and the handwriting of the address I never saw before. We
shall go on swimmingly now, George."</p>

<p>"Of course, we'll make a fortune!" observed Harroway.</p>

<p>"We'll not do that, dear George," said Anne, good temperedly;
"but we can take a trip to Calais, George, and enjoy ourselves
until the regiment embarks. George! don't go to sleep again. Sit up
and talk."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to sleep, dear," said Harroway, pettishly, and in
another minute he was snoring loudly.</p>

<p>Anne sat working till twelve o'clock, then, collecting her
thoughts, as well as she could, she tried to form a
<i>future</i>.</p>

<p>To her intense horror, Harroway awoke, and craved for some
brandy and water. She gave it, with feigned cheerfulness, but the
bottle had nearly fallen from her hand.</p>

<p>Day after day was spent in idleness and dissipation by Harroway,
and in pain and anxiety by his wife. It was necessary for her to
cash the £50 note, to meet some little bills, which demanded urgent
settlement. She went to her dressing-case, where the note was
placed, and to her dismay it was not to be found. She searched her
drawers, her work-basket, and every place where it might have been
deposited for safety (although she was certain she put it in the
dressing-case), but it was not to be found. Doubtless it had been
stolen. Since the great calamity Anne had never alluded to their
bad luck, but the words were constantly on Harroway's lips. Anne,
therefore, did not like to tell him of their loss. She tested her
ingenuity to know how the sum could be replaced. There was but one
way&mdash;the sale of her watch, and a variety of trinkets which
she never wore, and which he was not likely to miss.</p>

<p>The landlady effected this little matter, and disposed of the
property at a moderate sacrifice of value.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a>
</h2>

<p>FROM York Castle, Sam Freeport wrote the following letter to his
friend Harroway:</p>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:5%">"MY DEAR GEORGE,<br>
<br>
I am so very happy here with Newsham, that I should like to remain
for a month longer; but the time is nearly up, and I must prove to
the sheriff, that I am not you but myself, and by these means get
out. A more decent set of people I have never met, and I feel under
some obligations to you, old boy, for giving me an opportunity of
making their acquaintance. There is no fear of being bitten by mad
dogs here&mdash;no fear of being run over by carriages; 'pon my
word, George, it is a most desirable residence for any man of
retired habits, and to an antiquary it ought to be a luxury. Here's
Julia Caesar, and the Clifford Tower, and it is impossible to say
what all. The living is unexceptionable. Newsham has no end of
friends, who are very bountiful. Blew brings down the mess Madeira;
but as Newsham says the sheriff is responsible for putting me here
instead of you, I think I shall call upon him to pay for it. Old
Newsham is making no end of money. I say, George, what a jolly
thing a profession is, if a fellow happens to be clapt in jail.
Bobby Tort is to come down here to see me to-morrow for a few
minutes; but I will make him stop all day, and no doubt he will get
well rowed when he goes home. I owe you £7 for a bill you paid at
the White Horse on my account. That elder brother of mine is a
regular brick. Believe me, my dear George, with kind regards to
sister Anne, your loving SAM."</p>
<br>

<p align="center"><img alt="" src=
"1600601h-images/IMAGE-4.jpg"><br>
<br>
</p>

<p>When George Harroway received this letter, he was in an
extremely bad humour, in consequence of some imaginary impertinence
shown to them by the landlady, who was (Harroway said) attempting
to presume upon their poverty, and give herself airs. He read the
letter, sneered, and muttered, "Sam Freeport is an unmeaning,
flippant fool."</p>

<p>"Don't abuse poor Freeport," cried Anne. "Really, George, I
think he is the most kind-hearted creature breathing."</p>

<p>"Do you? Just read that," said her husband, and he tossed the
letter to her; and rising from the table, paced the room in
anger.</p>

<p>"My beloved George!" cried Anne; "you must have misunderstood
Freeport. It is impossible to conceive a more kind letter. Read it
again, dearest."</p>

<p>"I have read it once, and that is enough," responded Harroway.
"I bear misfortunes as well as most men; but I will not allow
Freeport or any one else to twit me about my circumstances."</p>

<p>"Surely he never intended to do so, George."</p>

<p>"Well, Anne, if you like to take his part to my prejudice, there
is an end of it; but I know Freeport better than you do, and I say
he did. I never paid £7 for Freeport to the White Horse man, and
what does he mean by sending it? Why, to insult me, to show you how
poor I am, because you refused him, and married me. I can see
through his motives."</p>

<p>Harroway was a great deal too much excited to admit of being
reasoned with, and Anne pretended to agree with him, and denounce
Freeport; but before she went to bed, she got hold of George's
pocket-book, where Sam's York account was kept, and sure enough,
there it was written, "paid Sam's bill at the White Horse, £7 3s.
6d."</p>

<p>The next morning, when this was triumphantly shown to Harroway,
he positively denied ever having said one syllable against Sam,
whom he declared to be the best fellow that ever broke bread.</p>

<p>Poor Anne fancied that her husband's reason was deserting him,
and in the thought she almost lost her own. He took it into his
head to be jealous of Sam Freeport, and scowled at his wife
whenever the name was mentioned, or the man himself alluded to.</p>

<p>There was another matter which excited Harroway. He was
excessively proud of Anne's personal appearance, and observing that
her walking dress was getting somewhat shabby, he proposed that she
should get another.</p>

<p>"I tell you what it is, Anne," said he; "if you can't come out
in a good dress and clean kid gloves, I will not be seen with you;
and if you have not got the money just now, why, pawn your watch,
which is of no use to you."</p>

<p>Anne had longed for an opportunity to reveal the secret which
tormented her, and now that opportunity appeared, she determined
not to lose it, and told the whole truth. Harroway became
furious&mdash;not because the £50 note had been stolen&mdash;not
because she had sold the watch&mdash;but because, he said, she had
deceived him. "How can I place confidence in a woman who acts in
that way?" he vociferated. "A man may tell his wife as many
falsehoods as he may deem it expedient; but for a woman to deceive
her husband&mdash;oh! Anne, Anne, I could not have believed you
guilty of such a thing!"</p>

<p>She could have shed a flood of tears at the reflection and this
reproach: but she repressed them, and argued the point with great
dignity and tact.</p>

<p>Amidst all these miseries, Anne sat down and wrote cheerful
letters to her family and friends&mdash;letters which spoke of her
happiness that her dear husband bore up so well against his severe
misfortunes, and made her contented with the lot which it had
pleased Providence to assign them. Her honest heart accused her of
falsehood; but she felt convinced that the goodness of her motive
would, before any tribunal, extenuate, if not absolutely pardon the
offence.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a>
</h2>

<p>THE day came when Harroway and his wife were to embark with a
detachment of the regiment for Madras. The detachment was under the
command of Freeport, a circumstance which annoyed Sam beyond
measure, for he hated responsibility of any kind. There was now a
marked difference in George Harroway's manners. He became captious
and argumentative. If his friends did not pay attention to
everything he said, he would say to himself, "Ah, I am a poor devil
now, and am slighted, of course." If, on the other hand, they made
more of him than formerly (as was the case), he would feel his
altered circumstances the more keenly, and become repugnant, and
frequently offensive in his remarks.</p>

<p>"May I read to you, George?" Anne would sometimes ask.</p>

<p>"If you like&mdash;but I don't care about it," he would reply;
and in the middle of a passage which she imagined would
particularly interest him, he would begin to whistle "Isle of
beauty, fare thee well!"</p>

<p>Wretched as was Anne, she still kept up those bright looks which
she wore in days when her heart was light and happy. Nothing seemed
to daunt her. In stormy weather, or in calm weather&mdash;when the
wind was fair or foul&mdash;she was always the same good tempered,
lively looking Mrs. Harroway, ready to do a kindness for any one,
or raise a laugh amongst others, though her own breast ached with
its sadness. Sam Freeport could not imagine she was unhappy, and
the more he looked at her the more he liked her; and he looked at
her so often that, for the third time in his life he fell in love
with her, and could think of nothing but Anne from morning till
night.</p>

<p>Harroway, one day at table, observed Sam's tender looks. He kept
his eye closely on his wife, to see if she returned them, or gave
him any encouragement. She did not, but Sam still gazed on. After
dinner they repaired to the deck, and Freeport, as usual, asked
Anne to walk with him. She took his arm, and they paced the deck
together&mdash;Sam saying all sorts of pretty things, and Anne
reasoning with him on their absurdity; but in so pretty a manner
that he could not be offended though he was hurt. George watched
them, and his soul seemed all on fire. The loss of his property was
for the time forgotten, in the insult which he conceived was
offered to his honour. Formerly he would have laughed at the scene
before him; but now it almost drove him to madness. In order to
conceal his rage from the eyes of others he retired to his cabin.
On entering it he saw the brandy-bottle on the swinging-tray, and
to give a zest to the anathemas of which he delivered himself, he
took a large portion, and very slightly diluted it.</p>

<p>Anne observed George leave the deck, and as soon as she possibly
could, without appearing rude to Freeport, she followed him. He was
stretched on his couch, with his eyes closed. She placed her hand
upon his feverish forehead, which he removed, coldly and
contemptuously. She inquired if he were ill. He replied, "Begone, I
hate you!"</p>

<p>"Why do you hate me?" she asked, in an under tone, lest the
servants in the cuddy should hear her.</p>

<p>"You know the cause," he murmured.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I do not know that you have any cause to hate me,
George," she cried. "You may be sorry that you ever saw me; but I
have been a good wife to you, and as long as I live I will never be
otherwise."</p>

<p>"It is false, Anne!"</p>

<p>"It is not, George!"</p>

<p>"You have given Freeport encouragement to pay you more attention
than it is proper you should receive, and I'll be revenged.
Freeport shall answer for it."</p>

<p>"I'll swear to you, George&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I would not believe you, if you were to swear till to-morrow
morning," he interrupted her; and rising from the couch he was
about to leave the cabin, but Anne turned the key quickly, and
stood before the door.</p>

<p>"Let me out this moment!" cried Harroway, the opposition
inflaming the excitement already caused by the ardent spirit.</p>

<p>"Never," she exclaimed, "till you can behave as a reasonable
man."</p>

<p>"I am determined!"</p>

<p>"You shall not."</p>

<p>He seized her by the arm. She leaned back more firmly against
the door, looked him steadily in the face, and begged him not to
make a noise and a fool of himself at the same time. He loosed his
hold, and resuming his seat upon the couch, he burst into tears.
His wife had scarcely seated herself beside him, when Freeport
rapped at the cabin door, and called out, "George, come on deck and
smoke a cheroot. Here's a sail in sight&mdash;a
homeward-bound&mdash;and we shall speak her in an hour!"</p>

<p>"George is asleep," cried Anne; and in order to convince Sam she
had spoken the truth, she called out, "George, dear, awake! There
is a sail in sight. Thank you, Captain Freeport; we will be on deck
presently."</p>

<p>In a very short time Harroway became composed and rational. He
craved forgiveness, which was granted; and putting on his cloak, he
proceeded with Anne to the deck. They sat upon one of the hencoops,
and watched the vessel, impelled by the strong trade wind, bounding
towards her home, and seeming to exult in her speed.</p>

<p>With the exception of Mrs. Harroway, there was not a soul on
board that would not have gladly returned to England, had it been
in their power to do so, so great was the horror entertained of
India; and the nearer the homeward bound vessel approached them,
the more silent and thoughtful the whole party became. The
homeward-bound took her studding sails in, hauled her mainsail up,
and backed her mainyard, and came within hail.</p>

<p>Presently, a hoarse voice exclaimed, "Halloa! Sam Freeport! how
are you?"</p>

<p>"How are you?" roared Sam in return, waving his cap, and then,
taking the glass from the captain of the ship, he descried a man
who had formerly been in his regiment, but had exchanged into
another, in the hope of getting on better in India.</p>

<p>"Who is it, Sam?" inquired Harroway.</p>

<p>"Raxton," replied Sam, "looking as yellow as a buttercup."</p>

<p>Raxton and Harroway were great friends as youngsters. Holding on
by the mizen shrouds, Harroway greeted him.</p>

<p>"What, George!" exclaimed Raxton, "are <i>you</i> going out?
What's the state of the consols, my Rothschild?"</p>

<p>After a few civilities were exchanged, the ships parted, and
each steered her own course.</p>

<p>Gloomy as they all seemed, and were, Mrs. Harroway's tongue soon
put them in good humour; and before they went down to tea, it was
universally admitted that <i>"whatever happens in this world is all
for the best."</i> In the evening whist was proposed, and played
till nine o'clock, when the company retired to rest, contented and
happy, with the exception of one&mdash;namely, she to whom all were
indebted for such contentment and such happiness. She dreaded that
her husband would be guilty of some folly that would cost him his
commission; or that his tendency to excesses would endanger his
life; or that something might happen to herself, and leave him
without a protector to save him from absolute ruin and disgrace.
Fate seemed to sneer at them. The wools which <i>she</i> had
purchased to make slippers for her husband, had faded; the bobbins
and cotton turned out rotten; the needles were rusted and useless;
even the miniature of her father had suffered from the sea air, and
the paint had peeled off from the ivory.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a>
</h2>

<p>WHEN the troop ship, after a tedious passage, arrived at Madras,
orders were received that the regiment was to proceed to Bengal.
Sam went on shore, and made the acquaintance of nearly all the
community. He procured for the Harroways an invitation to stay with
one of the judges while the vessel was refitted.</p>

<p>Freeport's first impressions of India were very favourable.
People in those days were more hospitable than in these, and the
treatment they received precisely came up to Freeport's idea of the
way exiles in the east should behave towards one another. Harroway,
too, was agreeably disappointed; and after leaving Madras he was
comparatively steady&mdash;to his wife's intense satisfaction.</p>

<p>Sam was advised to hire servants in Madras for the mess, and he
did so, and christened "the twelve" after the months in the year,
"January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August,
September, October, November, December."</p>

<p>When the detachment under Sam's command had landed in Calcutta,
and were safely housed in Fort William, the ship which brought them
into port took fire, and was burnt to the water's edge. Fortunately
for the Harroways, Blew had taken all their traps out of her, when
he removed those of his master; nearly every one else had been less
urgent in getting their boxes out of the hold, and lost them. Sam
always declared that if he had not been on board, George's luck
would have burnt or sunk the ship, when they were out at sea; and
in this opinion he was not singular in the regiment.</p>

<p>Freeport very soon established himself in the good graces of the
Calcutta community; and being in command of the detachment, with
the band, he made himself of great importance before the bulk of
the corps arrived.</p>

<p>"We'll establish the mess at once," said Sam; and the mess was
established. "We'll sink formalities, and call on everybody!" said
Sam, and the proposition was agreed to.</p>

<p>One morning Freeport stepped over to Harroway's quarters, and
said as they had been to various evening parties, it struck him
they ought to give a ball. Mrs. Harroway suggested that they should
wait till the remainder of the regiment arrived, but Sam declared
that they ought to do it then or never, for if they waited the
<i>eclat</i> would be gone.</p>

<p>Harroway agreed with Sam; and Anne instantly withdrew her
objection, and consented to write the invitations.</p>

<p>Sam was determined that everything should be done in "first rate
style," and gave orders which placed the mess funds in a rather
rickety condition.</p>

<p>The evening came, and Freeport took an early dinner with the
Harroways. He insisted on lending Anne Mrs. Missevery's tiara of
diamonds and emeralds, and the brooch and bracelets to match. She
declined, on the ground that a plain book muslin dress was not
sufficiently handsome for such ornaments, and they would be
preposterous. George instantly said that it was very evident she
knew nothing about dress, or she would know that the simpler and
plainer the dress, the better the jewellery, if it were good,
looked on the person. Anne then accepted Sam's offer, and he sent
Blew for the case. When it was opened, they had all a very hearty
laugh.</p>

<p>"They are really <i>very</i> handsome!" exclaimed Anne, as she
replaced them in the case. "How often have I heard these things
talked about! They are said to be part of a set which a noble lord
sold in York, without the permission of the rightful owner. The
affair was hushed up, but the first night Mrs. Missevery wore them
there was an immense sensation in the room; for a young lady called
out, 'Mamma, I declare there is a woman in your tiara of
diamonds!'"</p>

<p>"And they will cause a sensation to-night, I hope," said Sam. "I
like sensations. You are right, Mrs. Harroway; they are very
handsome indeed. I cannot afford to give them to you, because I
keep them for luck; and hitherto they have done me much
service."</p>

<p>"Do you know," said Anne, "I am afraid to wear them. They are
very valuable, and I am so extremely unfortunate with borrowed
property."</p>

<p>"They certainly are valuable," said Sam, "for Hamlet offered me
fifteen hundred guineas for the set." (This was true.) "But you
need not be afraid. Let Blew keep them till you are ready to go. No
harm can happen to them."</p>

<p>Freeport and the Harroways went early to receive the guests. It
was a most curious circumstance; but the first lady who entered the
room so extremely resembled Mrs. Missevery, when dressed for a
ball, that Sam was half frightened, and when she fixed her eyes so
intently, and stared at the magnificent tiara, Anne had great
difficulty in persuading herself that India was not the receptacle
for the departed, and Mrs. Missevery was certainly "moving in the
society." Harroway declared himself of opinion that it was no other
person; and when the room filled, and Sam led the lady forth to
dance "for luck, and out of respect for the dear departed," both
Harroway and his wife were involuntarily carried back to the
memorable night which had been so propitious for Sam Freeport.</p>

<p>The tiara, in good sooth, <i>did</i> cause a sensation; and Anne
felt the eyes of every lady in the room upon the top of her head.
One lady, who was very proud of her own jewellery, remarked in
Sam's hearing, that they must be paste; and such opinion soon
became general.</p>

<p>Amongst others present was a young girl, with large blue eyes
and light flaxen hair. She had a tall commanding figure, and was,
on the whole, a very showy personage. Her countenance was
peculiarly winning&mdash;though the expression of her face had very
little meaning in it. Her complexion was most beautifully fair and
brilliant; and she appeared to have a vast number of admirers. She
was married to an elderly gentleman, who seldom accompanied her to
parties; and on this night he was enjoying a rubber at the club,
and playing for much higher stakes than he could afford to
lose.</p>

<p>Unlike Freeport in this particular, as in many others, George
Harroway knew the names of very few people in the room; but
curiosity prompted him to inquire that of the lady just described.
He was informed she was a Mrs. Rosny.</p>

<p>"Rosny!" exclaimed Harroway, within himself (quoting a speech of
Henry IV. of France)&mdash;"love me and serve me, for I am fully
satisfied with thee!"</p>

<p>Ere many minutes had elapsed, Harroway and Mrs. Rosny were
seated side by side on a couch, and chatting <i>tête-à-tête.</i>
Anne was delighted to see this, for his indifference to everyone
had become tedious and disagreeable.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rosny thought Harroway the handsomest man she had ever
beheld. He could see she admired him, and therefore he strove to
please her by pretty compliments.</p>

<p>Various people approached her, amongst others, Sam himself, and
reminded her of engagements to dance; but she excused herself to
all, and sat out. Harroway led her to the supper-table, and after
they returned to the ball-room, their incipient flirtation
continued.</p>

<p>"George is coming out in a new line," remarked Freeport to
Anne.</p>

<p>"Is he?" she replied, feigning she had not observed him.</p>

<p>"Look at him!" returned Sam. "He has been talking to that pretty
woman all night, and she seems regularly head over ears."</p>

<p>The fact was, Sam was a little piqued.</p>

<p>"I should not be at all surprised; for you will admit he is the
handsomest man in the room," said Anne.</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind," said Sam, laughing. "He is not anything
like so handsome as I am."</p>

<p>"Well, as I am beginning to grow jealous," she replied, "just
see if you can prevail, and attract her by your winning ways."</p>

<p>"Now then, observe!" said Sam; and he left Mrs. Harroway, and
approached Mrs. Rosny and George.</p>

<p>The lady answered some query Sam put to her, but in such a
manner as convinced Freeport she wished he would stay away. That
colossus of coolness was not to be driven off, and he went on
questioning further; but only with the same effect. The more
impatience Mrs. Rosny betrayed, the more resolved was Freeport to
remain. At length he got a chair, and seated himself on her left
hand. Harroway and Mrs. Rosny remained silent, and looked steadily
upon the floor. Several ladies were about to quit the room for
their homes, when Sam was compelled to give up his persecution, and
see them into their carriages. The moment he was gone, Mrs. Rosny's
face beamed with smiles, and she resumed the very interesting
conversation with George Harroway which Sam Freeport so abruptly
interrupted.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harroway watched them closely. The repulse to Freeport
amused her, but she was at a loss to account for the extraordinary
change which had come over the conduct of her spouse. She was not
jealous, but she thought his attentions were too marked, and the
lady's unqualified acceptance of them rather unbecoming. There they
sat until the room was almost empty, when Harroway very tenderly
put Mrs. Rosny's shawl over her shoulders, and led her to her
carriage.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</a>
</h2>

<p>"I AM charmed with Calcutta!" cried Harroway, the following
morning, at breakfast. "There is a light-heartedness about the
place which pleases me vastly."</p>

<p>"I am glad you like it, as we are likely to remain here for some
time," said Anne. "And how did you enjoy yourself last
evening?"</p>

<p>"Exceedingly!" he replied. "That Mrs. Rosny is one of the most
agreeable persons you can imagine. We must make their
acquaintance."</p>

<p>"Then you had better call upon them," suggested Anne.</p>

<p>"I intend doing so," said Harroway. "It strikes me that while we
are here we had better make ourselves comfortable."</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you, George, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that moment Freeport entered the room to inform them that the
rest of the corps were coming up the river Hooghley.</p>

<p>Sam was in anything but a good temper. Mrs. Rosny (whom he spoke
of as "a cold unmeaning thing") had sorely wounded his vanity, and
this was a grave and serious matter with Freeport. On being
questioned by Harroway, as to what he was going to do with himself
that day, he replied that he intended to take a boat, and proceed
down the river to meet the colonel.</p>

<p>When Freeport took his departure, Harroway made a particularly
neat toilet, and placing himself in a palanquin, he repeated to the
bearers some Hindostani words which he had committed to memory the
night before. After being jolted for five-and-twenty minutes, he
arrived at a large gate. The Durwan very politely inquired, in a
mysterious way, <i>"Kon saheb?"</i>&mdash;What gentleman? "Doctor
Saheb," said George; and the gates were instantly thrown open, and
"bang" went a gong.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rosny was suffering from a severe headache (so she said),
but she contrived to talk in an animated tone, and occasionally to
laugh and show her beautiful teeth. Harroway thought, and so did
many others, that she looked even prettier by daylight than by
candle-light. The visit was prolonged to an hour's length, when the
gong again sounded. Mrs. Rosny said, "this must be my lord and
master!" and begging Harroway to stay tiffin, she removed herself
to the opposite side of the marble table, and sat as prim as the
mistress of a boarding-school just about to say grace before
meat.</p>

<p>What was Mrs. Rosny's surprise to see Captain Freeport enter the
room! What was Harroway's discomfiture! What was Sam's disgust on
beholding George! Sam had gone to pay his respects&mdash;charged
with cut and dried speeches and quotations from Byron, Shelley, and
Keats. At the gate he had been refused admittance, but <i>by
chance</i> he threw his arms out, opened wide his eyes, and said,
"I'm a doctor!"&mdash;when he was let in immediately. "I thought,
Freeport, you had gone to meet the colonel," said Harroway, after
an awkward pause.</p>

<p>"Couldn't get a boat," said Sam, rather doggedly.</p>

<p>"The bore, perhaps," suggested Mrs. Rosny. "At this season of
the year&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! a horrible bore! Horrible! Horrible!" ejaculated Freeport,
giving action to the words, and glancing at George Harroway. "Never
knew such a bore in the whole course of my life!"</p>

<p>Sam made up his mind to sit his friend out; but in this he was
foiled also; for his friend would not move; and they left the house
together.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what it is, George," said Sam&mdash;when they got
into the road&mdash;"you have no more consideration in you than a
Chinese image. I went there by appointment, as you might have seen,
and there you sat, like a gawky, although I gave you as broad a
hint as could be. The same thing occurred last night. You wouldn't
go&mdash;although you saw, as plainly as possible, you were wanted
to make yourself scarce. I'm surprised that a man who has lived so
much in the world, isn't more a man <i>of</i> it!"</p>

<p>"Really, Sam, I am very sorry," returned Harroway. "I had no
idea of your engagements, my dear fellow; but it shall never happen
again."</p>

<p>"Very well, then; you understand the thing now," said Sam.</p>

<p>"Oh! perfectly," said Harroway. "Come and take luncheon with us,
and say no more about it."</p>

<p>"It's an understood thing?" said Sam, making his fore finger and
thumb into a bargaining note of interrogation, and looking the acme
of knowingness.</p>

<p>"An understood thing!" repeated Harroway, with a frowning
seriousness, while inwardly he was consumed with laughter.</p>

<p>When he reached his quarters in Port William, George was greeted
by his wife. She seized both his hands, and said, "George, dear! a
letter from my father brings us very, very good news!"</p>

<p>"Impossible?" cried Harroway, fancying from her extreme
joyousness that the bulk of his fortune was coming back to him.
"What is it?" and he grew pale with anxiety for the reply.</p>

<p>"The purchase money is placed at the agents', George, and there
is no chance now of your losing the step! Was it not good of the
dear old man to think of us before any one else?"</p>

<p>"Why, that's certainly better than nothing," quoth Harroway.
"Yes&mdash;very good of him indeed."</p>

<p>Anne's heart fell from its zenith of joy into an abyss of
misery; but she hid her feelings, and turning to Freeport, she
said&mdash;"I have never thanked you for lending me those handsome
ornaments. I have redelivered them safely into Mr. Blew's
custody."</p>

<p>Sam was vexed with George's coldness, and he replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, I never intended you to return them. I intended you to
keep them. I was only joking, when I said I could not afford to
part with them. I don't value 'em at one straw. Keep 'em, or sell
'em, or do what you like with 'em!"</p>

<p>"Indeed not!" said Anne. "I would not think of it; at the same
time, I am not insensible of your generosity. They are emblems of
fortune with you; with us, they might be the very reverse."</p>

<p>"You are quite right not to accept so handsome a present, and
deprive Freeport of so many valuables," observed Harroway; "but as
far as luck is concerned, I should say it would be utterly
impossible to change ours for the worse. I should not be at all
surprised to hear, by the next ship that arrives, that the agents
have failed, and the purchase money is only sixpence in the
pound."</p>

<p>"Well, dear, and that would not be the death of us!" said Anne,
laughing.</p>

<p>"Of course it would not," said Harroway.</p>

<p>"What nonsense to talk about the agents breaking," said Sam.
"The thing is quite absurd!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a>
</h2>

<p>MR. and Mrs. Rosny requested the pleasure of Mr. and Mrs.
Harroway's company to dinner, and the invite was accepted. The
style in which their friends lived struck the subaltern and his
wife with amazement. The table glittered with silver and glass, and
literally groaned with the weight of the viands placed upon it. The
word "sumptuous" but feebly conveys to the mind the order of
extravagance that there prevailed. Mr. Rosny was a merchant in an
extensive way of business, and enjoyed a considerable amount of
public confidence. His hospitality was as unbounded as was Sam's
when that gentleman kept open house in Portland Place.</p>

<p>Anne enjoyed herself very much. The scene was new to her. But
Harroway was exceedingly vexed and disappointed that he could not
sit beside the hostess&mdash;that honour having fallen to a person
of greater importance. He handed in a lady, who must have thought
him a most uncouth monster; for he never once opened his lips to
her, beyond performing the commonest civilities. It was half past
ten o'clock before the ladies rose from the table, and long before
then Freeport had yielded to the effects of the punkah, and was
sound asleep in his chair.</p>

<p>Harroway was one of the first to go into the drawing room, and
when Mr. Rosny was left alone, he attempted to arouse his sleeping
guest; but in vain. A grunt, and "all right!"&mdash;or "don't be a
childish fool!" was the only response his endeavours met with.</p>

<p>The servants, after their master had retired to the drawing
room, thought <i>they</i> might as well try to awaken the sleeper;
but annoyed with their importunity, and fancying that he was at
mess between two impudent ensigns, he folded his arms tightly
across his chest, and then threw his elbows out, suddenly; and so
effective was the deed, that the servants filed off right and left,
and suffered Freeport to sleep on in peace and quietness.</p>

<p>Towards midnight the party broke up, and the host and hostess
sought repose after the labour of entertaining so many persons who
were comparative strangers to them. The oil in the greater part of
the wall-shades was burnt out; and when the bearers went to
extinguish such of the flickering ministers as remained, they did
not observe that Freeport was still sleeping in the dining
room.</p>

<p>At about two o'clock in the morning Freeport awoke. He had not
the most remote idea of where he was; but fancied he was at home,
of course. All was dark around him&mdash;and he wished to find the
door and go quietly to bed. He arose from his chair and felt for
the wall, which he found after stumbling over several chairs, and
other articles of furniture that stood in his way. Running his hand
along the wall in search of the door, Freeport at length came to
it, and very carefully walked out, and got into the drawing room.
He there fell over several things, and at last came in contact with
something muffled up in a blanket. He kicked it, and said, "Get up,
you wretch! How often have I told you never to sleep here? I'm not
going to have my sitting room turned into a dormitory for you black
brutes. Get up you!"</p>

<p>It was an <i>ayah</i> that Sam stumbled over. The affrighted
woman rushed up stairs into Mr. Rosny's loom, and declared there
was a Sahib below stairs.</p>

<p>"<i>Kia</i> bat?" (What do you say?) asked Mr. Rosny.</p>

<p>"Ek Sahib," (a gentleman) said the affrighted ayah,
shuddering.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" exclaimed Mrs. Rosny. "That woman is always eating
opium and smoking bang. She's mad," and then, addressing the ayah
Mrs. Rosny said, "<i>Jou, pawgal.</i>" (Begone, you fool!)</p>

<p>Freeport thought the disturbed person, who was sleeping on the
carpet, was still in the room, and he growled out, "Get some
<i>hog</i>" (ag&mdash;fire), he meant to say, "Buttye lao" (bring a
light); but as he was not answered, he roared, "Blew!" with all his
might and main.</p>

<p>It never occurred to Rosny that Sam had been left asleep, and
his wife knew nothing about it.</p>

<p>"Blew! you vagabond!" roared Sam.</p>

<p>The native servants became alarmed, and ran out of the
house.</p>

<p>"Egad! there <i>is</i> somebody," said Rosny. "What's the
meaning of this?"</p>

<p>Rosny was not what is termed "a plucky man," by any means, and
though his curiosity was very great, he was nevertheless remarkably
slow in gratifying it.</p>

<p>"Don't, for heaven's sake, my love, go down stairs," cried Mrs.
Rosny. "You may be assassinated."</p>

<p>"<i>I'm</i> not afraid!" said Rosny; but if he were not afraid,
it is odd that he took full five minutes to slip on his dressing
gown, and went no further than the landing, when he called out, in
a subdued voice&mdash;"Bear<i>er</i>! B<i>ear</i>er!"</p>

<p>Sam heard him, and imagining that the voice proceeded from an
officer who had rooms in the same staircase, he exclaimed, "Ah, you
may sing out 'Bearer' till you are as black in the face as they
are! but if I can get a candle, I'll settle some of their hashes,
and teach Master Blew a lesson into the bargain."</p>

<p>Such an expression as "settling the hash," seemed to Rosny so
bloodthirsty that he hardly knew how to act. He determined to "face
the foe," so he said; but then he proceeded to dress; and seemed
very particular about his garments. Mrs. Rosny, who was commonly a
timid creature, on this occasion was very brave. She seized the
taper and rushed down stairs as fast as possible.</p>

<p>"Good Heavens! Mrs. Rosny!" exclaimed Sam, when he saw her,
"what is all this? What brought <i>you</i> here? Welcome to this
dreary abode!"</p>

<p>"What brought <i>you</i> here?" said the lady, laughing.</p>

<p>Sam looked round the room, the truth flashed across him
<i>instanter</i>&mdash;and he made the most humble apology.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rosny then raised a loud and ringing laugh, which she knew
would reach her husband's ears, and bring him down stairs. Down he
came, and on beholding Freeport (his heart being freed from its
alarms), he joined his wife in the laugh, and pronounced the whole
affair to be "a deuced good joke."</p>

<p>* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>At half past eleven next morning Sam called at the house, in the
hope of finding Mrs. Rosny alone, and talking over the unfortunate
affair which had happened; but to his horror and dismay, there was
George Harroway, who seemed quite as much at home there as was Mr.
Rosny himself. Freeport now saw that his presence was <i>de
trop,</i> and, having made up his mind to flirt with Mrs. Harroway,
he abridged his visit, and returned to the fort.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rosny seemed vastly amused with the adventure of the past
night, and while she buried her pretty face in her hands, and
laughed at her own thoughts, she shook her ambrosial curls in a way
which made George Harroway think her a perfect Hebe.</p>

<p>The hours sped quickly while Harroway and Mrs. Rosny discoursed,
with impressiveness, on an infinity of subjects. It was tiffin
time. George was invited to remain, and did so; and it was past
four o'clock before he got home, where he found Sam Freeport
superintending the putting up of a piano, which he said he had
"bought at a sale&mdash;just for luck."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a>
</h2>

<p>HARROWAY suggested to his wife the propriety of fitting up their
quarters in something like "style," and proposed attending an
auction for the purpose of making purchases. She gave several
reasons why they should do nothing of the kind:&mdash;1st. She
heard the Colonel say they were likely to move up the country
earlier than was expected; 2nd, they had already sufficient for
their wants and position; and, 3rd, they had no money, and could
only make an outlay by running into debt. All these reasons were
over-ruled, as absurd, childish, and ridiculous. "As for
<i>debt</i>," her husband observed, "I am told it is the custom of
the country."</p>

<p>Anne had heard her husband often boast that he never owed a
shilling in his life for more than a few days together, and this
change of sentiment she regarded as a bad omen. She argued the
point strenuously; but she might have spared herself the trouble,
for he became extremely irate, and vowed that in future he would
never consult her respecting any of his affairs.</p>

<p>Day after day there came into their quarters some costly article
of furniture, glassware, china, plate, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. And
at length a carriage and pair was purchased, and a very handsome
saddle horse. The facility with which he gained credit edged
Harroway on, and in less than one month he was upwards of £1,000 in
debt, when in reality he could not have commanded a hundred.</p>

<p>Since their acquaintance with the Rosnys, Harroway had become
very abstemious, both at home and abroad. His wife had strong
suspicions, but she did not venture to breathe them. The Rosnys, at
Harroway's request, were invited to dine, and then those suspicions
grew into a certainty, and Anne felt that the friendship which
existed between her husband and Mrs. Rosny had better terminate,
ere it led to the unhappiness of all parties. Had she been
satisfied that her husband could take care of himself&mdash;had she
been assured that he would not have fallen to ruin, and perhaps
destitution, her pride would have induced her to return to England,
and never see his face again. But she saw before her his downfall,
if she left him to himself; and bitter would have been the
reflection to her that one who commenced life so auspiciously
closed his career in infamy and disgrace, when, by judicious
conduct on her part, it might be in her power to save him. It was
no fault of hers, but she felt that his union with her was the
cause of his pecuniary misfortunes, and of whatever alteration
those misfortunes had wrought in his disposition, his nature, and
his habits. How was she to act? That was the question. Others,
besides Sam Freeport, paid her great attention, and she could
easily have flirted, and made Harroway jealous. But that would have
brought on the very crisis she wished to avoid. To feign not to see
the growing attachment on her husband's part, would be to give him
an impunity. As for the lady, Anne saw that her preference for
George was purely a preference of the day, and that as soon as he
left her locality, he would not hold the faintest place in her
memory, and that whatever place he then held would be very speedily
filled up by some other admirer.</p>

<p>Mr. Rosny seemed rather pleased than otherwise at the attentions
his wife received, while for Harroway he evinced a particular
liking and regard. This increased Anne's difficulty, and she really
knew not what to do. Wherever Mrs. Rosny's carriage was to be seen,
there was Harroway (who got the nick-name of "the count") riding by
the side of it. No matter whether Mr. Rosny was present or absent,
it was all the same. Freeport had frequently expostulated with his
friend, but to no purpose. He was invariably answered with a
laugh.</p>

<p>There was to be a public ball in Calcutta, in celebration of the
glories of some hero, and Anne intended going; but when the evening
came she declined doing so, apparently to her husband's
satisfaction, a circumstance which wounded her to the soul. She had
reason to be glad she stayed away, for George had scarcely left her
when she received a long letter from her father. He spoke of his
circumstances in the most cheering terms, and the certainty, if he
were spared for a few years longer, of retrieving all, or at least
realizing a handsome fortune for his family, herself included. But
strange to say, the money the old man sent to London was not
deposited, for the purchase of Harroway's company, according to his
instructions, and was lost by the failure of the house through
which it was remitted. But her father faithfully promised that
before long, and in good time, the amount should be
forthcoming.</p>

<p>"I declare," sighed Anne, as she folded up the letter, "the ill
luck is all upon his own side, and if he had not lost all his money
in the way he did, he would have lost it in some other."</p>

<p>And then she debated with herself whether she should show the
letter to her husband or not.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a>
</h2>

<p>AT the ball, Mrs. Rosny appeared in great splendour. Not only in
her beauty, but in her dress, did she outshine every other lady
present. Harroway was waiting at the door, and took her from her
husband's arm the moment she arrived on the landing. Rosny did not
remain ten minutes in the room. He seemed far from collected and
comfortable, and retreated hastily and unobserved.</p>

<p>"Oh! such a thing is going to happen!" said Mrs. Rosny, looking
up imploringly in George's face, and shuddering, while a pretty
smile played about her lips.</p>

<p>"I hope not," said Harroway.</p>

<p>"Oh, it must, I fear," said the lady. "You will hear of it
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"What is it?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"A calamity," she sighed.</p>

<p>"It will not affect <i>you,</i> I hope," said George,
tenderly.</p>

<p>"Not me, perhaps," she remarked. "But poor Mr. Rosny. He will be
obliged to go away."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to call that a calamity," remarked Harroway,
with a quiet laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, but that's not all. It's quite dreadful, really. Such a
thing, to be sure! But it can't be helped."</p>

<p>"Do tell me," said George. "If you have a sorrow, let it be my
happiness to share it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I will, after this dance," she replied. "What is it to
be? A quadrille?"</p>

<p>"No; a waltz."</p>

<p>"I'm so glad of that," quoth the lady. "I hate quadrilles."</p>

<p>When the dance was over, Harroway led Mrs. Rosny to a quiet part
of the room.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" she said; "I am almost afraid to tell you; but you
must not mention it to a soul."</p>

<p>"On my life, I will not," said George, impatient to be
informed.</p>

<p>"If they could only have put it off for another month," said the
lady, pouting her lip, and picking to pieces a rose-bud, "I should
not have cared; but Rosny says it will not look well for me to
appear in public while he is away, and there is to be that fancy
ball on the twenty-third, and my dress and everything is all ready.
I never knew anything so provoking. Though I can't see what I have
to do with the firm."</p>

<p>Harroway begged her to be explicit; and she then told him in
confidence that the firm of which her husband was a partner, would
suspend payment on the following day, and that "<i>poor</i> Mr.
Rosny" was then on his way to the Danish Settlement.</p>

<p>Where the "Danish Settlement" might be, George Harroway was
profoundly ignorant; but he supposed it was somewhere in, near, or
contiguous to Denmark, and certainly not in India. He knew,
however, the misery and the utter wretchedness which usually
attends the crash of a mercantile firm in the mother country, and
he supposed the results were the same in the east. He supposed,
moreover, that Rosny had deceived her, innocent young creature, as
to the privations she would have to endure, and what would be the
altered state of their circumstances. Harroway knew what he himself
had suffered, and he sympathised with Mrs. Rosny from the very
bottom of his heart; and when she arose to fill an engagement to
dance with some one else, he watched her take her place with the
tenderest emotions that pity can call up. He wondered whether Rosny
would really take himself off to another country and leave that
fair face and fragile form without a protector, in a land where she
had no relations, and probably few friends, now that the winter of
their circumstances had set in. Verily, in these matters, was
George Harroway very green. What were his sighs and longings, as he
looked at that woman, to possess the fortune that he <i>once</i>
possessed! Casting aside all courtesy, he took her from her partner
the moment the quadrille was concluded, and led her to a couch,
where he talked to her, not despondingly, but in a very serious
strain. The more she laughed, and the gayer she looked, the more
George Harroway sorrowed for her lot. He told her, as a means of
alleviating the jagged feelings she would probably experience, that
he was once worth six thousand pounds a year, and that, at the
present time, he was "worse off than worth nothing;" and although
she replied, with an unmeaning smile, ill-becoming her words, "So
Captain Freeport mentioned the other evening," he attributed it
solely to that ignorance of worldly affairs which a truly feminine
character ought to possess. Her recurrence to the forthcoming fancy
ball reminded him of a young child amused at the pomp attendant on
its parent's funeral. Her levity and cheerfulness increased his
feeling for her, and it was with difficulty he refrained from
tears. Some other person claimed her as his partner, and she was
again obliged to leave George Harroway's side. He walked into the
refreshment-room, and while he swallowed a glass of champagne, he
cursed his ill luck; for to his acquaintance with her, and to his
friendship with her husband, he attributed the failure of the firm
and the reverses of fortune Rosny and his wife were about to
experience. The night waned, and the ball-room thinned.</p>

<p>Harroway saw Mrs. Rosny to her carriage, bade her good night,
blessed her, and promised to see her on the following day; then,
returning to the supper-room, he drowned her griefs and his own
together in a bottle of his favourite wine.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a>
</h2>

<p>FOR the want of something better to do, and being extremely
annoyed with Harroway, Sam Freeport, at the ball, paid very great
attention to a Miss Pannoety, a <i>brunette,</i> who spoke English
with a foreign accent. It was neither a French, German, Italian, or
Spanish accent. Miss Pannoety was not good-looking; but plain, and
very thin. In looks, she was the very reverse of Mrs. Rosny; and
perhaps this had something to do with Freeport's selection of her,
for Mrs. Rosny was entirely out of Sam's favour. Some one told
Freeport that Miss Pannoety had three lacks of rupees; and, to a
question "how many thousand pounds sterling is that?" he was
informed, "Thirty." "Thirty thousand pound sterling," reckoned Sam,
"would give me about twelve hundred pound a year. Well, I may go
further and fare worse&mdash;<i>I'll have her.</i> There will be no
chance of her making me unhappy, at all events. She looks old
enough to make up her mind at once, and say 'yes' or 'no;' and
before I part with her this night, I'll put the question."</p>

<p>After rehearsing to himself two or three little speeches which
were likely to captivate "the brunette," Sam seated himself beside
her, and commenced the attack. The flattery soothed Miss
Pannoety&mdash;she was not used to it&mdash;no man before had been
bold enough to tell her she was beautiful, and hint that she had "a
soft Ionian face"&mdash;a "child of the Isles." She was thrown into
a kind of coma, and when the question came, she was only too glad
to answer in the affirmative.</p>

<p>It was extraordinary the progress that Freeport could make in a
few hours. He used to run immense risks of failure; for, in
reality, he did not care.</p>

<p>The following day, Freeport called upon Anne, to tell her of his
success in having engaged himself to an heiress, a woman worth
thirty thousand pounds. Anne could not laugh at his facetiousness,
for she was too unhappy; but she listened to his description of
"the brunette," and made several remarks.</p>

<p>"You don't seem cheerful to-day. What is the matter?" inquired
Sam.</p>

<p>"Nothing in the world," she replied. "But I am weary."</p>

<p>"What has become of George?"</p>

<p>"I know not. He went out immediately after breakfast, and I have
not seen him since."</p>

<p>"I tell you what it is," said Sam, "George is making a great
fool of himself, and you ought not to allow it."</p>

<p>"He means nothing," returned Anne; "and why should not he amuse
himself, poor fellow? Besides, how can <i>I</i> control him?"</p>

<p>"Well, you ought to try," urged Sam. "I have spoken to him two
or three times; but he only laughs at me. If I was a married man,
in his circumstances, I'd be ashamed to go on as he does."</p>

<p>Anne could not help smiling; but it was a great exertion. After
a brief discourse, Freeport took his departure, and left Mrs.
Harroway to her own reflections. George was at that moment
conversing with Mrs. Rosny. His sorrow had very considerably abated
since she told him that the house and furniture, carriages, horses,
&amp;c. &amp;c., were settled upon herself, and couldn't be
touched, besides two lacks of rupees (£20,000) in bank of Bengal
shares.</p>

<p>"<i>Poor</i> Mr. Rosny," she exclaimed, "this is the second time
it has happened. The first time caused the death of my predecessor.
Everything went. But, thank Heaven, people are wiser now-a-days,
and Rosny learnt prudence in his last misfortune. But then there's
something so horrid in seeing one's name in the papers, and then to
be cooped up for a month, just for the sake of appearances! Oh,
dear, it is quite dreadful! I have a very great mind to take a trip
to Penang for my health. I wish we could make a party."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't go to Penang, pray!" cried George. "Come and stay
with us till Rosny can return."</p>

<p>"I am afraid of the Fort. They say it is unhealthy. But I should
be delighted if you could come and stay here. I could go out with
Mrs. Harroway, and she would protect me."</p>

<p>"Of course you could," said Harroway. "There could not be the
slightest objection to that?"</p>

<p>"And I might go to the fancy ball with you?"</p>

<p>"Of course you could. Why not? I'll propose it to my wife as
soon as I get home.</p>

<p>"Had I not better write to Mrs. Harroway, and ask her?"
suggested Mrs. Rosny.</p>

<p>"Ah! perhaps that will be best," conceded Harroway.</p>

<p>"<i>Poor</i> Mr. Rosny!" sighed the lady. "We had a very
pleasant party last evening&mdash;had we not?"</p>

<p>* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Freeport called on "the brunette," and found her to be a woman
of business, as well as of "keen sensibility." She was full of the
breaking up of Rosny &amp; Co., which, by this time, was all over
Calcutta. The brunette discussed the amount of dividend that would
be probably forthcoming, and she estimated it at a remarkably low
figure. She pulled Mrs. Rosny into very little pieces, and told Sam
an infinity of stories which were <i>piquant</i> and amusing. The
brunette's father was a merchant, who did business in a safe and
quiet way, and he had also "a foreign accent," for when his
daughter introduced Sam, he said, "How do you do, sare?"</p>

<p>The brunette was infected with a family pride, which induced her
to be continually discanting on her grandfather, who had been "in
the Sudder Board." (What the Sudder was Sam had not the most remote
idea.)</p>

<p>The brunette, too, had a way of interlarding her conversation
with Hindustani words, such as <i>"mutlub" "pench," "gup" "mahin
hoga," "chul" "acha," "cheechee," "bundobust,"</i> and so forth. On
Sam, who was ignorant of every tongue but his own, these words were
thrown away, and what was worse, they frequently destroyed the
context. In "society" the brunette was on her guard, and did not
use these familiar parts of speech; but in her home, nature would
out, and nothing in this world could hold them in.</p>

<p>The brunette, by daylight, disappointed Freeport, and he had to
tax his powers of dissemblance to the very utmost to enable him to
conceal his feelings. He stayed tiffin, and when the sun had gone
down, he rode out with the brunette and her fat father in their
carriage, a sort of Patagonian landau. On the course Sam crossed
his arms, and laid himself back, in a very commanding attitude, and
whenever he met any of his friends or acquaintances, he bowed with
a profundity that was quite overpowering. Sam saw Mrs. Harroway,
and his face was instantly lighted up with a smile, and he kissed
his hand in such a manner that she was forced to laugh heartily as
soon as the Pannoety's carriage had passed, although she was truly
wretched. Anne felt <i>alone</i> in India. Freeport's fun reminded
her of other days, and after the momentary merriment which it
occasioned was over, her recollections were replete with bitterness
and disgust.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a>
</h2>

<p>"INDEED not! I will do nothing of the kind!" exclaimed Anne,
after reading a letter from Mrs. Rosny, and destroying it.</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked her husband.</p>

<p>"An invitation to spend a fortnight with Mrs. Rosny&mdash;she is
so lonely, poor thing."</p>

<p>"And why shouldn't you accept it, Anne?"</p>

<p>"Because, George, I prefer remaining in my own house."</p>

<p>"Is not that very selfish of you?"</p>

<p>"It may be. But she must have older friends than myself, and
more congenial spirits in this place."</p>

<p>"Here is a poor woman in distress of mind, her husband forced to
flee, and leave her alone; she asks you a favour, and you refuse to
grant it, because you like your own house better than hers, and
will not give it up for a fortnight. Selfish! dreadfully
selfish!"</p>

<p>"I will never be an inmate of her house, George."</p>

<p>"Then, under the circumstances, invite her to stay with you,
instead. That is the least you can do."</p>

<p>"No, nor shall she ever come here, except as a mere
visitor."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because I dislike her."</p>

<p>"That's no reason at all," urged Harroway, "why you should not
be civil. If you wont go there, you must invite her to come here.
The fact is, you believe all the idle tales and stories that have
got abroad to the poor innocent creature's disparagement. It is the
penalty that every pretty woman has to pay&mdash;to be pulled to
pieces and run down by all the plain ones that surround her."</p>

<p>"Really, George, you don't take me to be a downright fool, do
you?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. That's the reason I argue the point. Come, come;
either accept her invite, or ask her to remain with us till old
Rosny can return?"</p>

<p><i>"Never!"</i> replied Anne, firmly.</p>

<p>Harroway strolled to the quarters of his friend Sam, whom he
found entertaining the brunette's fat father. Harroway was
introduced as "our colonel," and resuming his seat, Sam recommenced
the most extravagant rhodomontade imaginable, and appealed to "the
colonel," ever and anon, to confirm his statements, or assist his
memory. When the brunette's father had taken leave, and driven from
the door, Sam said,</p>

<p>"Now, George, we will have a mild glass of grog, and a cheroot,
as of yore&mdash;talk of old times, or of the present&mdash;if you
think them more agreeable. Look here, George, I feel disposed to
back out of my engagement with the brunette. Instead of having
thirty thousand pounds, she has not got a fifth part of it, and
that the fellow hints about settling, and all that. Besides,
brunettes are so very common in this country, I should prefer a
blonde. But the misfortune is, I have been fool enough to write to
her no end of letters, out of that book of mine, and there might be
some difficulty, you know, in getting off the bargain. What would
you recommend?"</p>

<p>"Really, Sam, I don't know how to advise you. It was very
foolish, certainly in you, putting pen to paper."</p>

<p>"Of course it was. But it is done, and it can't be helped. I
shall know better another time. What could I say&mdash;eh,
George?"</p>

<p>"Oh, say you've changed your mind, or say you can't afford to
marry."</p>

<p>"But then that's no excuse," argued Sam. "Look here, George," he
continued, stretching his humorous face forwards, and laughing the
while; "couldn't I say that an order has just been received from
the Horse Guards, to the effect that no officer in the Queen's
service can marry without the Queen's consent, on pain of
forfeiting his commission?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you might say that," replied Harroway, smiling at the
idea; "but would they believe it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd make 'em believe it," said Sam, puffing away, and
looking all confidence in his own powers of persuasion. "Why,
George, if it comes to believing it, I'd sit down in their
presence, and write a formal letter to Lord Hill, asking him if he
would procure the consent of the Queen to my uniting myself in
wedlock to Clementina Georgiana Pannoety, daughter of Augustus
Frederick Pannoety, and grand-daughter of the Sudder
Board,&mdash;requesting his Lordship, at the same time, to send his
reply to the said Clementina Georgiana&mdash;and then, you know, I
could leave them to forward it, and pay the postage&mdash;eh,
George? It strikes me that that's a very good way."</p>

<p>"You'll be getting into a scrape," said Harroway.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," laughed Sam. "I don't think I could get into
a scrape with the authorities, if I tried; and if I did, I could
very soon get out of it."</p>

<p>"There will be no harm in making the experiment," remarked
Harroway. "But I am doubtful of the success, Sam."</p>

<p>"Sure to succeed, George," exclaimed Freeport. "Would you
believe it, my dear fellow, they positively don't know where
Portland Place is! There's an amount of ignorance for you&mdash;eh,
George?"</p>

<p>"Do you intend going to this fancy ball on the 23rd, Sam?"
inquired Harroway.</p>

<p>"Of course I do," replied Freeport, "and we are going to have a
group. I shall appear as <i>Othello,</i> the brunette as
<i>Desdemona,</i> and the old fellow as <i>Iago</i>. I wish you'd
come as <i>Cassio,</i> George, just to heighten the effect."</p>

<p>"You are joking, Sam," said Harroway.</p>

<p>"I give you my word and honour I am not," he replied. "Dresses
of the most costly material were ordered this very morning; and I
read the play to the brunette, and very nearly burst out laughing,
when I came to that part about 'scaring a skin as white as
monumental alabaster.' Oh, such a lark, George! She had never heard
of the play before!"</p>

<p>After immoderate laughter, in which his friend joined, Harroway
regretted that he would be unable to take a part in the group, as
he had made up his mind to go as Henry II.</p>

<p>"What's the fun of going as Henry II.?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing&mdash;a mere whim."</p>

<p>Sam looked at Harroway steadily, and said&mdash;"I shall advise
Mrs. Harroway to go as the Duchess of Guienne."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said Harroway, pretending not to understand
him.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know who your Fair Rosamond is to be, my good fellow. I
tell you what it is, George, I never saw a man so altered as you
are in the whole course of my life."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a>
</h2>

<p>FREEPORT was anxious to have Anne's approval of his plan for
getting rid of his engagement with the brunette; and, for this
purpose, he called upon her. But before he touched upon the topic,
he alluded to the costume in which her spouse was to appear.</p>

<p>"Henry the Second?" said Anne; and then, thinking for a few
moments, she tossed her head in disgust. "And how do <i>you</i>
intend to go, Captain Freeport?" she inquired.</p>

<p>Sam told her the whole story of "the group."</p>

<p>"Do you know, I am disposed to be very mischievous?" said Anne.
"And you would do me a great favour if you would aid me in a little
rebellion against my lord and master. If you had not George's
welfare at heart, I would not ask you."</p>

<p>"What is it? I'll do anything in the world for you, from
resigning the service up to jumping into the river," cried Sam.</p>

<p>"Nothing so dreadful as either," said Anne, with a dejected
smile. "But if you could go as Henry the Second yourself, and take
the brunette as 'Fair Rosamond,' it would afford me great
satisfaction to witness the vexation it would occasion in
others."</p>

<p>"Glorious! glorious!" ejaculated Sam. "I'll do it, with all my
heart. I'll teaze George to death, and Mrs. Rosny too, when we meet
there. But how can I get the dresses, eh?"</p>

<p>"You can easily find out where George and his Rosamond are
getting their dresses made up, and order the <i>facsimiles.</i> Go
to Madame Gervaine's. But I doubt not you will devise means to
carry out the detail, now that I have made the suggestion."</p>

<p>"All right," said Sam. "Yes; leave it all to me. I will go to
the brunette at once, and I will tell her it is impossible to
procure the proper black for Othello's face, and we must go in some
other characters. What's more, I will make her take me in her
palanquin carriage, and order the dresses. How disgusted George
will be. It's capital. How came you to think of it?"</p>

<p>"There's no time to be lost," said Anne. "You must get them made
up at once, or you will be too late."</p>

<p>Freeport borrowed a friend's buggy, drove to the brunette's
mansion, talked her over in a few minutes, and was soon on his way
with her to Madame Gervaine's.</p>

<p>On the tables were spread out, as "decoy ducks," a variety of
costumes in various stages of perfection. Some were correct enough
to be recognised, others required explanation. The most magnificent
of the collection was a skirt of rich rose-coloured satin, a jacket
of deep blue velvet, trimmed with ermine, with long sleeves richly
embroidered in gold; and for the head-dress was a veil, also
embroidered in gold.</p>

<p>"And what may this be?" inquired Sam, pointing to the dress just
described.</p>

<p>"Fair Rosamond!" was the reply.</p>

<p>"And who may be going as fair Rosamond?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That I am not permitted to say," said the milliner.</p>

<p>"Then do not, by any means," said Sam; and then turning to the
brunette he remarked&mdash;"I have not seen anything that would
become <i>you</i> half so much as would that. Take my
advice&mdash;have one like it."</p>

<p>The milliner was fearful of offending Mrs. Rosny by making up a
duplicate of her dress; but then the brunette was too good a
customer, and too touchy, to be told that the dress of Fair
Rosamond would not become her. There was Madame Gervaine between
her two good customers; one of them she was sure to lose. The
brunette gained the day, because she was the best and most regular
pay; and Mrs. Rosny was already so deep in the books, that if she
withdrew and settled accounts, the loss of her custom would be of
very little consequence. Then was brought forth the costume of
Henry II., or something that that monarch was supposed to
wear&mdash;velvet and gold, purple satin, and so forth; and these
materials, when put into shape, were to cost Sam Freeport four
hundred and fifty rupees, or forty-five pounds.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a>
</h2>

<p>HARROWAY had not the slightest idea that his wife would go to
the ball; and he seemed a little ruffled when she expressed her
intention. Nor did he quite understand her willingness to escort
Mrs. Rosny. His dress was intended, (so he told his wife,) as that
of "David the First, King of Scotland."</p>

<p>Freeport and the brunette were very early. They sat under the
canopy, or "in the bower," as Sam called it&mdash;till the room was
well filled, and then they sallied forth for admiration.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rosny made a point of always being late, and it was nearly
eleven before herself and the Harroways made their appearance on
the night in question. They had not been in the room more than one
minute when Mrs. Rosny beheld Miss Pannoety and Captain
Freeport.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" src=
"1600601h-images/IMAGE-5.jpg"><br>
<br>
</p>

<p>"Well, I declare!" she gasped. "Oh, that horrible creature! I
could really sit down and cry with passion."</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked George Harroway.</p>

<p>"To think, after all my trouble and anxiety, that that
abominable shrivelled wizened mahogany thing should appear as my
double! This, I suppose, is one of Captain Freeport's practical
jokes!"</p>

<p>Harroway and his wife both caught sight of Sam and his brunette.
Harroway was extremely annoyed, and sympathized with Mrs. Rosny;
but Anne laughed out loudly&#8212;and thus threw salt on Mrs.
Rosny's lacerated feelings.</p>

<p>"I am sorry now that I sent the carriage away," said Mrs. Rosny.
"I would go home at once&mdash;I am ashamed to show myself.
Horrible creature!"</p>

<p>"What, <i>another</i> Fair Rosamond!" said an old friend of Mrs.
Rosny's&mdash;extending his hand.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to call <i>that</i> creature fair?" she
answered, and turned away. "Let us sit down in some obscure corner.
Did you ever know anything so provoking, Mrs. Harroway?"</p>

<p>"Very provoking," quoth Anne. "But don't let any one see that
you are annoyed. Disguise your feelings. Just walk round, and never
notice them. The contrast ought to delight you. I will remain here.
Now walk round the room quietly, with Mr. Harroway."</p>

<p>The advice was followed; and ere long Mrs. Rosny and Harroway
were followed by Sam Freeport and his "fair Rosamond." Miss
Pannoety had no notion that her double was to be Mrs. Rosny.</p>

<p>"You must pay her a compliment," said Sam, "as soon as you catch
her eye. Tell her how nice she looks, and ask her to be our
<i>vis-à-vis</i> in the next dance."</p>

<p>"What are the people grinning at?" said Mrs. Rosny to Harroway.
Had she looked round, she would have seen Sam setting all sorts of
ridiculous faces. Sam did not care about her chagrin. She had
several times severely wounded his vanity, and to wound hers in
return was sweet rather than otherwise. Nor had he the slightest
consideration for his friend George.</p>

<p>Presently, Harroway and Mrs. Rosny halted opposite to Anne's
chair, when Freeport drew up Miss Pannoety and "formed
line,"&mdash;placing the two ladies shoulder to shoulder.</p>

<p>Miss Pannoety then complimented Mrs. Rosny; but she received no
answer. Sam then asked George if they wanted a <i>vis-à-vis</i>.
Harroway tried to get up a scowl; but it ended in a titter. This
enraged Mrs. Rosny, and leaving his arm, she sat beside Anne, who
enjoyed the scene, and gloried in its success.</p>

<p>A more vain woman than Mrs. Rosny never existed. She had gone to
that ball fully determined to be the character of the evening; and
when she saw Harroway and Sam laughing together, she concluded that
she had been betrayed, by one in whom she reposed the greatest
confidence&mdash;and she determined never to speak to George after
that night. Her suspicions, moreover, were confirmed. Sam had left
his Rosamond in the bower, while he went to "apologize" to
Harroway, and after they had laughed in each other's faces, Sam
slipped his arm through that of his brother monarch, and led him up
to Miss Pannoety.</p>

<p>"Let me introduce my friend, Colonel Harroway," said Sam, "and,
if you are not engaged, he will be delighted to dance the next
quadrille with you."</p>

<p>She said she would be "very happy."</p>

<p>Harroway felt that he was in a very awkward
position&mdash;saddled with a Rosamond, whom he wished to
avoid&mdash;but he was obliged to bow. Sam was afraid George might
run away, and not come near her again&mdash;so he saw Miss Pannoety
well on his arm, and left them in conversation. Freeport now
approached Mrs. Rosny, and requested the honour; but she coldly
declined, and looked across the room.</p>

<p>"Will <i>you,</i> Mrs. Harroway?" said Sam, addressing Anne.
"Will <i>you</i> give me the happiness?"</p>

<p>Anne consented, and soon found herself opposite to her husband
and Sam's brunette.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rosny now encouraged all her discarded <i>beaux</i> to pay
her attention, and she was literally surrounded and hidden by them;
and when George Harroway attempted to disperse the mob, and engross
all her attention and smiles, he felt repulsed, and cut dead.</p>

<p>Before supper time Mrs. Rosny disappeared from the room, and
left the Harroways to get home in the best manner they could,
which, by the way, was in Sam Freeport's friend's buggy. It was
thus Mrs. Harroway, by a little clever ingenuity, put a
satisfactory end to her husband's desperate flirtation with "the
perfect Hebe."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER
XXVIII.</a>
</h2>

<p>A FEW days after the ball, Harroway came to his senses. He
stayed at home, talked to his wife, read to her, and was, in every
respect, what he used to be when he had not a care in the world.
One morning, they rose at break of day and walked by the river's
side towards Garden Reach. The cold weather was about to set in,
and the birds chirped as though they belonged to a colder clime.
The river was assuming a bluish tint, and seemed vying with the
sky. The ships even wore a jaunty air; and when the sun got up, a
happier scene could hardly be gazed upon.</p>

<p>"Look, dear George," cried Anne, "see how the sun dissipates
yonder fog, and laughs at it. Oh! how I hope we may survive all our
misfortunes and folly, and that the evening of our life may yet be
cheerful and happy."</p>

<p>"You may well say 'folly,'" returned Harroway. "Well, Anne, for
your sake, as well as my own, I hope the omen may be propitious.
Misfortune makes some men wise, but of others it makes perfect
fools."</p>

<p>"Never mind that," returned Anne; "let us look to the future and
not to the past. Do you know, dear George, I feel quite excited and
joyous."</p>

<p>They walked along the road, talking of other times, till Anne
felt rather fatigued, and proposed returning. They had not
re-crossed the Hastings Bridge when a large dark cloud appeared
exactly before them, and from it issued vivid forked lightning,
which was followed by loud thunder. They hastened towards home, but
before they reached the Fort, large drops began to fall, and by the
time they passed the gate both of them were completely drenched. In
their sight, and within twenty yards, a sepoy on guard was struck
dead by the lightning, and his musket twisted like a corkscrew. It
was an awful storm, and while it lasted neither Harroway nor his
wife spoke a single word. When it passed over, they sat down to
breakfast, and in the middle of the meal Sam Freeport walked into
the room, looking more dejected than can be described.</p>

<p>"Have you heard of a man being killed at the gate?" inquired
Sam.</p>

<p>"Yes; we were unfortunate enough to see it," replied Anne.</p>

<p>"And have you heard," said Sam, looking at George, "that that
plausible scoundrel who dined at our mess last week, and for whom I
went security for £800, has walked out of the country, and left me
to pay it?"</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say so?" exclaimed Harroway, turning
pale.</p>

<p>"I do, indeed," said Sam, "and how I am to stump up, without
parting with the tiara, I really don't know."</p>

<p>"How foolish of you to go security for any man, especially for
one whom you could know so very little of," remarked Anne.</p>

<p>"For any man!" echoed Sam, with a laugh. "For any man, eh? Bless
your soul! I have gone security for half a dozen since I have been
in Calcutta. They told me it was a mere matter of form; and, as
such, I signed the bond. I never supposed for a moment that the
fellow would be such a vagabond as to leave me in the lurch by
running out of the country. I say, George, that's an Indian matter
of form, eh?" and at the last sentence Sam laughed; but to Mrs.
Harroway's discomfiture her husband did not join him, but looked
very serious and twitched his whiskers.</p>

<p>"Go security?" reiterated Sam, savagely munching a muffin, "Go
security? Let me see. I have gone security for one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven&mdash;for seven fellows; and take them at an
average of, say £800 a piece, that's seven times
eight&mdash;fifty-six&mdash;five thousand six hundred pounds! Where
they'd get anything like that out of a captain of a marching
regiment, with nothing but his pay, a handsome face, and an
extravagant disposition, I don't know. <i>As for the tiara,</i> I'm
blowed if they shall ever have that, for I told Blew before I came
here to consider it his own property, till I told him to the
contrary."</p>

<p>"But you were not the only security, were you?" asked Anne. "If
there is another, you will only have to pay half."</p>

<p>"No," replied Sam, "there <i>is</i> another, for the fellow
asked me to be 'one of two;' but suppose, as the major says, the
other security has not got a sixpence to bless himself with. What
then? Why, they can come down upon me for the whole of it. It's
quite awful! It's the first bit of bad luck I have had since I have
been possessed of the tiara. This is a bit of <i>George's</i> luck.
Isn't it, George?"</p>

<p>Harroway became very uncomfortable, and began to abuse the
country, and one of the table servants for no fault whatever.</p>

<p>Harroway was on duty that day, and he put on his uniform to go
out. As he was brushing his whiskers, his eye caught sight of his
flute, and he mechanically took it up, and while he was thinking of
Sam's conversation, he attempted to sound it. But the instrument
would not sound, and in a fit of rage, Harroway raised his strong
arm and smashed it to pieces against the window sill, uttering, at
the same time, some violent words; then, rushing down the
staircase, he proceeded to the men's barracks.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.</a>
</h2>

<p>"WHAT on earth am I to do, Anne?" said Harroway to his wife,
when he returned from duty. "I am in a great difficulty, and trust
to you for the best advice."</p>

<p>"What difficulty?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Why, the fact is, Anne," he continued, "I put my name to a
piece of paper for that fellow of whom Sam spoke the other day, and
the chances are that I shall have to pay for it."</p>

<p>"How very provoking!" she exclaimed. "Well, George, I did not
think you could be so foolish. How came you to put your name to a
paper?"</p>

<p>"That's more than I can tell you. The way he came over me was
perfectly magical. It was at an auctioneer's show rooms. He came
up, and told me a very amusing story, and two or three bits of
scandal&mdash;admired the cut of this blouse, and declared it the
most gentlemanlike thing he had ever seen&mdash;begged the loan of
it as a pattern&mdash;slipt his arm through mine&mdash;asked me to
do him a favour&mdash;walked me up to a desk&mdash;put a pen in my
hand and a slip of paper&mdash;and before I had time to think of
what I was doing, or make inquiry of him, he was possessed of my
autograph; for I wrote 'G. Harroway, Lieut. H.
M.&mdash;&mdash;Regt.'"</p>

<p>"George! George! How could you be such a fool?" cried Anne.</p>

<p>"I tell you I don't know," he answered. "For his character, as
far as money matters are concerned, was at the lowest ebb at the
very time. He just wheedled me out of my name as you would wheedle
a knife, or a piece of broken bottle, out of a young child's
hand."</p>

<p>"But who is he?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's a very well-known character. I met him at
&mdash;&mdash;'s, and &mdash;&mdash;'s, and I once tiffed with him
at Rosny's counting-house."</p>

<p>"And what may be the amount, pray, for which you have made
yourself responsible?"</p>

<p>"Ah, dear! that is the worst part of it," said Harroway. "All I
know is, that he got my signature at the foot of a blank slip of
paper, and now that he has fled the country, I am pretty certain he
made use of it."</p>

<p>Poor Anne became faint with anxiety. Had she known the worst,
she could have faced it; but here was something hanging over them,
and they knew not to what extent it would affect them in life, or
character even.</p>

<p>Day followed day, and Harroway heard no tidings of his
"autograph." They were beginning to hope and believe that it had
not been made use of, or that George was known to have nothing, and
was protected by his poverty from the pains of responsibility. But,
alas! one morning he received the following letter from an agency
house.</p>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:5%">"Calcutta &mdash;&mdash;<br>
<br>
"DEAR SIR,<br>
<br>
Your promissory note for Rs. 4500, at thirty days date, in favour
of Mr. Quickley, and by him indorsed to us, fell due yesterday. We
shall feel obliged by your taking up the same with as little delay
as possible.<br>
<br>
"We remain, dear sir, yours faithfully,<br>
<br>
"GROVILE &amp; Co."</p>
<br>

<p>"Thank Heaven it is no worse!" cried Anne, as she saw George's
jaw fall, after rending the above. "I declare to you, George, I am
comparatively quite happy. It might have been ten times the
amount."</p>

<p>"But how is it to be paid?" asked Harroway.</p>

<p>"Why, we must sell off all these useless things, and be
contented with walking instead of riding."</p>

<p>"Well, but all these things have to be paid for, recollect."</p>

<p>"That is another matter; you must at once meet this debt you are
called upon to pay. Let that Mr. Blew, who is always attending
auctions and buying and selling, come and clear the rooms out and
dispose of everything for what it will fetch; and you must go in
person to these people, Grovile &amp; Co., and say the affair shall
be settled in a few days."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.</a>
</h2>

<p>THE household furniture, plate, glass, &amp;c. &amp;c., which
Harroway fancied were perfect bargains&mdash;"dirt
cheap"&mdash;sold for something less than half of the cost. As for
the carriage and horses, and the Arab, the whole were knocked down
for the price of the carriage alone. The proceeds were
enough&mdash;barely enough&mdash;after deducting commission and so
forth, to pay off the promissory note and the interest thereon.
Sam, too, had a sale, but on a different principle to George's. He
left all to Blew, and told him to do the best he could; and Blew
wrote out a description of everything, and sent it round to all the
residents of the Fort. They were informed that "those articles, the
property of a distinguished field officer, were for disposal by
private contract." The prices, which were double of what Sam had
bid for them, were readily realized, and the amount handed over to
him; but it did not suffice to meet his share of the 8,000 rupees,
which he had to pay for Mr. Quickley.</p>

<p>It was now to be considered how Harroway was to pay for the
furniture. The sircars (clerks) were becoming troublesome, and the
auctioneers began to write polite notes. Freeport also wanted
money, and went over to the Harroways to have a consultation.</p>

<p>"I hear," said Sam, shutting his left eye, and looking very
knowing out of the right, "that there is a bank that lends money on
very moderate terms, and the best thing we could do, George, would
be to have a 'dig' at it."</p>

<p>"What are the terms?" asked Anne.</p>

<p>"The terms are these," said Sam. "You must undertake to pay off
so much a month, and get two fellows to be surety for you. Now,
George, I have been surety for so many they will no doubt take me
as a surety for <i>you,</i> and you can very easily get another,
for there are lots of people of our acquaintance who are in the
same sort of circumstances as ourselves, and would be glad of an
exchange of names. You can, of course, be security for <i>me.</i>
What amount do you want, George, eh?"</p>

<p>"I think about seven hundred pounds will do, Sam. Wont it,
Anne?" asked George.</p>

<p>"About that sum," she answered, "or borrow an even six hundred,
George. But how can you liquidate such an amount out of the savings
of a subaltern's pay?"</p>

<p>"That's my look out," exclaimed Sam. "Ain't I going to be his
security? I'll take care that he pays it."</p>

<p>There was no other way of raising money, and money had to be
raised. Anne, therefore, made no further remark.</p>

<p>"I think I will borrow one thousand pounds, while I am about
it," said Sam, "and pay it off by instalments as soon as I can, or
else I'll make my brothers liquidate it, just to make them bear
their absent brother in mind; or, if my luck gets bad, sell the
tiara."</p>

<p>These arrangements were agreed upon. The money was advanced with
wonderful despatch, and Harroway, on the guarantee of Sam Freeport
and a penniless lieutenant, undertook to pay off two hundred rupees
(£20) a month from his pay, leaving themselves something less than
one hundred (£10) a month to live upon. How it was managed it is
almost impossible to understand, but not only did Harroway and his
wife live within their very limited means, but they contrived to
make a good appearance.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.</a>

<p>FREEPORT carried on in his usual way. He gave his quiet little
parties, to which he asked the most extraordinary people that
Calcutta could produce. His engagement with Miss Pannoety was for
some weeks considered as "still pending," as the letter to Lord
Hill was despatched, and everything depended on the answer. But at
last it was broken off in the following manner:&mdash;Mr. Pannoety
fancied that his daughter was pining, and attributing it to the
anxious state of her mind, in regard to the royal consent or
refusal, he resolved to tempt Sam with a glorious offer, which was,
that he, Freeport, should retire from the army, marry Clementina
Georgina, join his father-in-law in business as a partner, and take
a third of the profits, which were then very considerable.</p>

<p>As soon as Freeport received the letter which contained this
offer, he laid it before his friend, Mrs. Harroway, for her advice.
At the same time he expressed himself, in jest, disposed to join
Pannoety.</p>

<p>"Don't think of it for one moment," said Anne.</p>

<p>"I think I must," said Sam. "She is not handsome, certainly; but
look at the wealth."</p>

<p>"Be advised, and remain as you are," urged Anne.</p>

<p>"Well, but just compare the circumstances," he argued. "Here am
I with the responsibility and bother of my company on my shoulders;
obliged to be up at gun-fire; present every evening at four
o'clock; whereas, if I was old Pannoety's partner, I should be
literally rolling in wealth, and living in the lap of ease,
comfort, luxury, and splendour."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind," said Anne. "Before a week had passed
away, you would be wretched. Recollect how glad you were to return
to the regiment from your open house in Portland Place."</p>

<p>"Ah, but I am older now," Sam remarked.</p>

<p>"Not at all," Anne returned. "You will be the same person that
you are now, and were then, if you live to be a hundred years
old."</p>

<p>"Very well, I suppose I must be guided by your advice," conceded
Sam; "but how am I to answer him."</p>

<p>"Ask him if those are the only conditions on which he will
consent to your marriage with his daughter; and if he says 'yes,'
then beg to decline, and there will be an end of it."</p>

<p>Freeport did precisely as Anne suggested, and his engagement was
soon at an end. In honour, or rather in celebration of the event,
he gave a dinner party to a dozen friends. But the very next
morning he made several visits, and fell desperately in love with a
fair and pretty face, which caused him great uneasiness for many a
long day.</p>

<p>The young lady to whom Freeport lost his heart had just arrived
in India. She was gratified with the attention Sam paid her, and
she grew to like him exceedingly. Mrs. Harroway had seen her, and
pronounced her to be "a very nice person," which delighted Sam, and
caused him to propose earlier than he otherwise intended. A more
tender and touching epistle than the one he copied out of his book,
could scarcely be conceived, and it carried the girl and her
friends along with it, and gained for Sam the victory he so much
desired. All was arranged, and on an early day Freeport was to lead
the young lady to the altar. But, alas, for the mutability of human
affairs!</p>

<p>Mrs. Rosny had never forgiven Freeport for marring the effect of
her appearance at the fancy ball, and as soon as she heard that he
had broken off the match with the brunette, Mrs. Rosny became
curious to glean a few particulars, and she therefore called, for
the second time in her life, on Miss Pannoety&mdash;who complained
bitterly of Freeport's conduct, and called Sam a monster; and after
a little she produced some of his letters.</p>

<p>"No one would believe a man could be so deceitful," exclaimed
Mrs. Rosny.</p>

<p>"Indeed they could not," said the brunette.</p>

<p>"I wish you would allow me to show these letters to a friend of
mine," said Mrs. Rosny.</p>

<p>"You may do what you please with them," said the brunette; "they
are of no use to me now."</p>

<p>As soon as she was in possession of the packet, Mrs. Rosny
hastened home to peruse its contents. She was edified and amused,
and from excessive laughter she was compelled to stop reading for
several minutes together. But this laughter did not compensate for
his depriving her of George Harroway's conversation and attentions.
When she thought of that, she was quite furious. Mrs. Rosny
therefore enclosed a fair portion of Sam's impassioned letters to
the brunette, and sent them anonymously to the young lady to whom
he was about to be married. There could not be any doubt about the
handwriting; it was recognised instantly as Freeport's. The style,
too, was unmistakeable; and the bold impudence with which he had
copied out stanza after stanza from various old authors&mdash;and
addressed them as "lines to Clementina Georgina"&mdash;was
peculiarly striking. The young lady showed these letters to her
friends, and those friends would not near of the match, to Sam's
intense vexation and trouble. He shut himself up for a week, and
kept his bed.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.</a>
</h2>

<p>THE Harroways continued to live very quietly and happily for
several months, when there arose a new source of anxiety for Anne.
A film appeared over both of George's eyes, and there seemed to be
doubts whether he would not entirely lose his sight. This lasted
for about five weeks, and during that period Anne had not a good
night's rest. She was almost afraid to hope, lest her hopes should
be blighted. She watched him by night and by day, and when he was
disposed to listen she would read to him until he fell asleep.</p>

<p>The film disappeared, and Harroway was himself again; but the
mental anxiety, and bodily labour were too much for Anne's
strength, and as soon as she knew her husband's sight was safe, she
felt completely exhausted and unable to lift her head. She always
endeavoured to raise a cheerful laugh, whenever George came to talk
to her; but she frequently failed, and showed how weak she was by
giving way to tears instead. A doctor who was called in recommended
"Darjeeling" as the only possible cure; but, as Anne very truly
remarked, "he might as well recommend the moon; for although it
might be all very well for people in poor Mr. Rosny's position to
migrate from place to place, heedless of expense, yet it was not
everybody that had the means of moving three or four hundred miles
in this country."</p>

<p>But without "Darjeeling," Anne recovered, and set herself to
bring up all arrears in her accounts. A few days after she was able
to sit up, a home letter, from her father, was put into her hands.
She trembled as she opened it, lest it should disclose some painful
news. But it did not. On the contrary, it began by stating that
"the money for purchase was deposited, and all was quite safe this
time; that the aspect of affairs with him was very cheering; that
he was overwhelmed just then with business, and could not write
further."</p>

<p>"Now, mark my words," said Harroway. "There will never be a step
in the corps so long as I stand first for purchase. It is very good
and generous in the old man, to be sure, Anne; but such is the
nature of our luck&mdash;a kindness is thrown away upon us."</p>

<p>The regiment was ordered to leave Calcutta, and proceed to a
station some distance in the interior. Harroway obtained leave to
remain behind for a month&mdash;as they thought it would be better
to proceed alone than in company with the corps. When the
month&mdash;a very tedious one to them&mdash;had passed away, a
budgerow (large boat) was hired, and the Harroways embarked for
their destination. It was at about the end of the cold weather; the
change of scene and the quiet of the boat were extremely grateful
to them, and they felt happier than they had been for some time
past. Harroway had taken charge of a valuable double barrelled gun
for a friend, and when they anchored for the evening, he amused
himself and his wife by going on shore, and shooting whatever was
deemed worthy of powder and shot. In the morning they watched the
natives catch the fish, and when they were on their journey, they
would sit aloft&mdash;Anne sketching the various places they
passed, while Harroway read aloud to her. They were so comfortable,
and so contented with the life they then led, that they could have
wished that the journey was twice the distance. At length they were
within one day's run of the station they were ordered to, and
everything was carefully put up for removal from the boat, as soon
as they landed.</p>

<p>There was a sunken log off Patna, some few years ago, which was
fatal to very many boats, and to some of their passengers; and the
evil genius that pursued the Harroways run their budgerow so
completely cross this log that the action of the stream capsized
her. They had just time to get into the cooking boat, when the
budgerow was forced into the deep water, where she went down.
Harroway and his wife stood upon the bank, watching, in mute
astonishment, the place where the waters had swallowed up all that
they had in the world.</p>

<p>"When is this luck to end?" said George, despondingly.</p>

<p>"I think, dear, it must have ended now," cried Anne. "If it had
not, one of us would have been drowned. As it is, we are spared to
each other, and in good health. Really, George, dearest, we ought
to be thankful for that."</p>

<p>"That's <i>one</i> way of looking at it, certainly," said
George.</p>

<p>"And it is the only one, depend on't," she laughed.</p>

<p>* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>At Patna they received great kindness and attention from the
principal authority present, and in the evening they were forwarded
on to Dinapore in an easy carriage, and conducted to Captain
Freeport's bungalow.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the meaning of all this?" cried Sam, when he heard
their voices. "I have been down at the ghaut all the evening,
straining my eyes looking for your boat, and Blew is down there
now, waiting for you."</p>

<p>"We landed at Patna," said Anne.</p>

<p>"What made you do that?" asked Sam.</p>

<p>"We couldn't help ourselves," replied Harroway.</p>

<p>"Why, how's that?" questioned Sam.</p>

<p>"The boat went down, and was lost," cried Anne.</p>

<p>"Well, by Jove!" ejaculated Sam, "I never knew such people in my
life! Never mind&mdash;you will have a run of good fuck yet,
George. It is impossible that this can last. Make yourselves as
comfortable as possible to-night, and to-morrow we will devise
means for the future. You had better remain in this place, and I
will go and take up my quarters with some one else."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER
XXXIII.</a>
</h2>

<p>THE following morning, at breakfast, Blew brought in Freeport's
letters&mdash;at least a dozen. Sam opened them, made himself
acquainted with the contents, and then commented thereon. There was
a dun from the bank, for a monthly instalment; there was a request,
on the part of a wine, beer, and cheroot merchant, that a
remittance might be made; there was a small account for patent
leather boots; there was a letter from a friend, giving him a true
account of his last love's looks, and promising to ascertain, if
possible, whether she relented, and whether there was a chance of
his gaining his heart's most earnest wish; then came a bill for
ices and soda-water; and several pretty little letters from ladies,
who kept him informed of all the gossip of Calcutta. To each and
every of these epistles, he replied in a characteristic strain. But
that to the wine, beer, and cheroot merchant's address must be here
given, as a specimen of Freeport's business
correspondence:&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p>"DEAR SIR,</p>

<p style="margin-left:5%">I am in receipt of your favour,
requesting a remittance, and have the pleasure to enclose you an
order for fifty rupees&mdash;the balance shall be forthcoming on an
early day. You will oblige me by requesting your people to send me
another batch of cheroots&mdash;exactly like the last; and, if it
would not put you to too much trouble, I should like you to procure
for me four or five very superior cricket bats, and half a dozen
balls, and a few packs of playing cards. You will be glad to hear
that the troops, both European and native, in this station, enjoy
the most perfect health, and, from various inquiries made in the
district, I am happy to state that a most abundant harvest may be
expected. The indigo crops are promising, and the fertility
generally is beyond description. Several accidents have of late
taken place on the river; but though the sacrifice of property has
been great, no lives have been lost. The weather is still
delightful, although the middle of the days is somewhat too warm to
be pleasant.<br>
<br>
With reference to the playing cards, I should like them to have
enamelled backs. Those that are not enamelled, are very unpleasant
to deal, after they are a little used.<br>
<br>
"Believe me, dear Sir, yours faithfully,<br>
<br>
"SAM. FREEPORT."</p>
<br>

<p>Harroway and Anne laughed loudly when Sam read the above to
them. He had never been out of cantonments, and he was quite
ignorant of the health of the troops generally, and of the state of
the crops; but as he said himself, "What can it signify? I wish to
be civil and polite, and as long as I say something on these
matters, why the object is effected."</p>

<p>But what was their amusement when they saw the substance of
Sam's information embodied as a leader in one of the Calcutta daily
newspapers!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV.</a>
</h2>

<p>"THIS is what I call living very mildly," observed Harroway to
his wife, one morning; "this is cantonment life in the East."</p>

<p>"Why, George, if we do not live very mildly, we can never meet
our engagements," she replied; "and remember, that to be dunned is
more than you can bear."</p>

<p>"But then I want to see the people, and <i>know</i> them,"
returned Harroway. "What say you, shall I conform to the custom of
the country, and make a round of calls? I confess I always fancy
one looks like a hungry wolf prowling about in search of dinners;
but it must be done."</p>

<p>"Indeed not, George," she urged; "we cannot afford to entertain,
and therefore I think we had much better stay at home."</p>

<p>Harroway gave in, and in accordance with his wife's desire he
called upon no one in the station. Many persons set them down as
very odd people; others fancied that they gave themselves airs;
others declared they were probably saving money and stingy; others
surmised that Harroway had been promoted from the ranks, and that
his wife did not feel at home in society, and therefore shunned it;
while a few scandal-creating creatures hinted that there were some
queer stories about them.</p>

<p>There was a cricket match played one Thursday forenoon, and
George Harroway was one of an eleven. He made a very good score,
and when he carried his bat off the field, he was complimented by
the lookers-on, who sat beneath the shade of the tent. A
middle-aged gentleman, whom Harroway had not seen before, opened a
conversation with him, and George invited him to dine at the mess
that evening, and the invitation was accepted.</p>

<p>It happened that on the evening in question there was a very
large dinner party at the house of the officer commanding the
station, and all the married people of Harroway's corps, himself
and his wife excepted, formed a part of the company.</p>

<p>The wife of Harroway's guest was one of the most mischievous
tattlers that ever set folk by the ears. She was very fond of
putting this and that together, like the servant-maid in the play,
and then arriving at a conclusion, which was unalterable. She was
now perfectly satisfied and convinced that when the ladies of the
regiment spoke of the Harroways as "unfortunate people," they did
not use the word "wicked" out of mere charity. "I don't mean to
say," she reasoned with her husband, "that they are not man and
wife <i>now</i>; but take my word for it, Major
Goggleheigh&mdash;&mdash;" (She had a way of tossing her head
instead of finishing her malicious sentences.)</p>

<p>The imputation flew with a rapidity which was almost incredible,
and talking about the really unfortunate and unoffending couple
soon became a means with many of beguiling some portion of the
tedious hours of the hot weather.</p>

<p>One evening Sam Freeport walked down to the ghaut, as was his
custom whenever a steamer arrived, to make the acquaintance of new
arrivals, and on the way back he was accompanied by a steady-going
officer, then commanding the wing of a regiment of native infantry.
Harroway's name was incidentally mentioned, and the "queer story"
was alluded to. Freeport was seldom seen in a passion, or even
ruffled in temper; but on hearing so vile and false an insinuation
directed against a man to whom he had been under numberless
obligations in bygone times, and against a woman whom he regarded,
and truly, as a paragon of virtue, and all else that exalts the
female character, his reason seemed suddenly to forsake him, and it
was with great difficulty he refrained from breaking his walking
stick over the head of the man whose lips had repeated so shameful
a rumour.</p>

<p>As soon as he could speak, Freeport demanded the authority. The
officer said that he did not remember any person in particular who
mentioned it, but that the circumstance was very commonly talked
about. This enraged Freeport more than ever, and he swore that he
would never rest till he found out the guilty persons, and punished
them. He sought the colonel, who expressed his extreme sorrow, and
promised to do all in his power to set the matter at rest. But this
did not satisfy Freeport. He called upon every one, out of his
corps, with whom he was intimate, and questioned them closely. At
length he traced the offence to the Goggleheighs, and to the
major's house he proceeded in haste and anger. There was
considerable shuffling and evasion, which Sam was not disposed to
let pass without lengthy comment and severe reproach. He demanded
in writing an admission of the error, and an expression of sorrow
on the major's part; and his demand was complied with.</p>

<p>Freeport debated with himself whether he would be justified or
not in withholding from Harroway what had come to his knowledge.
There was a good deal in favour of his putting Harroway in
possession of the facts, and, on the other hand, there was a good
deal against his adopting such a course. At length he tested the
propriety of his measures by asking himself whether,&mdash;if it
were his own case,&mdash;whether, if he stood in Harroway's
position, he would like to be informed, or kept in ignorance of
what had been said, and what was probably still believed beyond the
precincts of the station? The result of his deliberation was this:
he walked to Harroway's poor abode, took George aside, and simply
stated all that had taken place. Harroway's eyes flashed fire, his
lips quivered, he clenched his fists, and his face was overspread
with paleness, induced by the violence of his passion.</p>

<p>Harroway promised Freeport faithfully that he would not be
guilty of impropriety, and that he would look upon Major
Goggleheigh's apology as sufficient; and no doubt he was at the
time quite sincere: but, alas! his own ill-luck threw him, a few
days afterwards, and before his wrath had subsided, into the
company of the very man whom of all others it were well that he
should avoid.</p>

<p>There was another cricket-match, and Harroway went in,
determined to make "no end of a score." The cricket-ground was in
sight of Harroway's bungalow, and Anne had borrowed an opera-glass
(from the major's wife) to see "dear George's beautiful batting,"
of which, by the way, she used to talk a great deal, whenever she
wanted to make him on good terms with himself. <i>The very first
ball put George Harroway out!</i></p>

<p>The other side, and their backers, raised a hearty cheer, which
was succeeded by screams and loud huzzas, and several very
enthusiastic persons jumped about like cannibals, and then threw
themselves down on the ground and laughed more like maniacs than
reasonable men. The "fun" was enormous, though the wit, perhaps,
was very much out of proportion. Harroway could neither understand
nor believe that the ball touched the middle stump, albeit there it
was, stretched at full length on the field. His astonishment
redoubled the shouts, for he had been heard to say, "I'll go in
first, and see the other ten out." As he walked to the tent,
Harroway looked towards his bungalow, and thought how dreadfully
annoyed poor Anne would be when she heard those cheers which
proclaimed his defeat, and reflected that the corps had not a ghost
of a chance since he was unable to score a notch. He was correct in
supposing Anne was annoyed, for she shed tears, not for the corps'
disappointment, but because she knew how hurt George would be when
he saw the round "0" opposite to "Harroway" in the printed report
of the match in the newspapers.</p>

<p>The first person who accosted Harroway when he reached the tent
was Major Goggleheigh. "You are not so fortunate to-day, Mr.
Harroway," said he, with an unmeaning and would-be-kind sniggle.
Harroway dropped his bat, walked up to Major Goggleheigh, and
replied, "By heavens! Sir, if ever you dare speak to me again,
I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;&mdash;" Here he raised his clenched fist to
a level with his chest, whereupon a young ensign&mdash;a very
knowing boy, of his regiment&mdash;rushed up, and placing his arm
round the infuriated man's waist, he led him, as he would lead a
child, away from the dangerous vicinity. By the time he was led
back to the tent, Major Goggleheigh had taken his departure.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.</a>
</h2>

<p>WHEN Harroway got home his wife condoled with him, but attempted
to laugh off the misfortune of being put out by the first ball. She
thought he was very foolish to think so much about such a trifle,
and could not comprehend how it could make so deep an impression
upon his spirits. He never spoke a word the whole evening, and was
extremely cross. There was another circumstance that puzzled
Anne.</p>

<p>Sam Freeport came to the house, looking unusually lugubrious,
and took George into the verandah, where she heard George
emphatically declare, <i>"I don't care one&mdash;&mdash;. I'd do it
again."</i> Anne began to imagine George had been foolish enough to
bet larger sums than he had been able to pay, on his own powers at
cricket. This suspicion harassed her, and she was almost driven to
distraction. When they returned to the room, Harroway asked
Freeport to take a cheroot and a glass of brandy and water; but,
for the first time in the recollection of Anne, Sam made some
excuse, and sorrowfully took leave.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you, George?" Anne inquired.</p>

<p>"Nothing in the world," said Harroway. "Why do you ask
that?"</p>

<p>"Because you appear disturbed."</p>

<p>"I am no more disturbed than you are, nor half so much."</p>

<p>"Well, I am very glad to hear it, George; I thought you were
annoyed at being put out so early to-day."</p>

<p>"Then, if you thought that, why did you ask what was the matter
with me?"</p>

<p>Anne retired, and left her husband alone. He paced the room till
a very late hour, talking to himself, and when he was tired out,
threw himself into the easy chair, and fell asleep.</p>

<p>The next morning the major called at Harroway's quarters, and
asked the servants if their master had risen. The servants said
"No," which was the case. The major used occasionally to look in
after parade, to have a gossip with the Harroways, and when Anne
heard his voice, she went out into the sitting-room to receive him,
and ordered coffee.</p>

<p>"What has become of Harroway this morning?" asked the major.</p>

<p>"He sat up very late last night, and he is tired," replied Anne,
and she called out, "George, don't be lazy! Here is the major!"</p>

<p>Harroway made no reply.</p>

<p>An hour passed away in a confused conversation, both on the part
of the major and Mrs. Harroway. The former had a painful duty to
perform, and the latter saw that there was some unpleasantness at
hand, though she had no idea of what it could be.</p>

<p>It was getting late, and high time for the major to go home for
breakfast, but Harroway did not make his appearance. George
pretended to be asleep, and was deaf to the numerous calls of his
wife.</p>

<p>"I must see George," said the major. "Make him get up."</p>

<p>Anne went into his room and aroused Harroway from his reverie.
He pronounced it a great bore to be disturbed in that way, but
after making a hasty toilet he came out.</p>

<p>The meeting was a very awkward one on the major's part. He had
known Harroway as a mere boy, and had always liked him; and for
Mrs. Harroway he had the highest regard and esteem.</p>

<p>Anne saw that the major wished to say something to her husband
in private, and she therefore left the room.</p>

<p>"How could you have been so mad as to raise your hand to that
man, George?" said the major.</p>

<p>"I know not," Harroway answered. "I have borne him a resentment,
and he spoke to me and grinned, when I was recently annoyed by
another matter of trifling import."</p>

<p>"The fact is," said the major, "you have exposed yourself to be
tried."</p>

<p>"I cannot help it," sighed Harroway. "Has anything been done in
the business?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and I am grieved to say, George, I am now present to place
you under an arrest."</p>

<p>After a silence of some minutes, Harroway went into his
dressing-room and brought out his sword, which the major took away
with him.</p>

<p>Anne could not comprehend these mysterious proceedings, and she
was fearful of questioning her husband in his present state of
temper. It was not long, however, before he made her acquainted
with his position, and the probable consequences of his rashness.
The announcement amazed her, but she did not reprove him for what
seemed beyond remedy. She was grieved that upon so small a
provocation (for Harroway had never informed her of the first
cause) her husband could resort to so violent an act; and those who
were equally ignorant with herself regarded him as insane.
Freeport, who was a perfect creature of hope, thought that nothing
more than a severe reprimand from supreme authority would be the
result. Harroway, on the other hand, who was a creature of despair,
predicted that he would be <i>cashiered</i>. Anne knew not what to
think, and none of her acquaintances could help her to an idea. All
doubt, however, was speedily set aside by a communication from head
quarters, to the effect that a general court-martial was to be
assembled for Lieutenant Harroway's trial.</p>

<p>Now that she was no longer in suspense, but informed of the
worst, Anne set herself to consider how her husband could best
defend himself. Harroway then deemed it his duty, and only just to
himself, to assure her that the remark on the cricket ground was
not the provocation he received, but that it merely afforded an
opportunity of resenting in person the insult and the wrong of
which he then apprized her.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for them, the very persons whom they most wished
to advise with were members of the court, namely, the major and Sam
Freeport, and they, of course, kept aloof.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.</a>
</h2>

<p>THE day for the trial arrived, and George Harroway stood charged
with "conduct unbecoming the character of an officer, in having,
at&mdash;&mdash;, on the &mdash;&mdash; day of &mdash;&mdash;,
18&mdash;, raised his hand in a menacing manner against Major
Goggleheigh, of the &mdash;&mdash; Regt., and uttered, at the same
time, threatening words."</p>

<p>There could be no doubt as to George Harroway's guilt. All he
desired was to bring before the tribunal the fact of having been
deeply injured by Major Goggleheigh, and being accosted by him when
he had just suffered a disappointment. He desired this, in the hope
of modifying the opinion of the court as to the heinousness of the
offence in a military point of view. To effect this object, he put
a question to Major Goggleheigh, when one of the members (who, by
the way, had read a great deal of military law, but who was utterly
ignorant of its principles, or even the power of words) suggested
that George's question was a leading one, and quoted Hough to
support his dictum, that "such questions could not be allowed."</p>

<p>There seemed to be a difference of opinion on this knotty point,
and the court was "cleared" in consequence.</p>

<p>While Harroway was cooling his heels outside the court, he could
not help expatiating with the adjutant on the absurdity and the
injustice of his being excluded from the discussion; and there
certainly appeared to be a good deal of truth and common sense in
his remarks.</p>

<p>The court, after half an hour's deliberation&mdash;(if fourteen
men, including the Deputy Judge Advocate General, all talking
together on a point of which two thirds of the number had not the
least glimmering of an idea&mdash;can be called "deliberating,")
was opened, and the prisoner was informed that the question was
considered "irrelevant." Harroway then proposed another, when the
member who was well read in Hough and Simmonds instantly suggested
that "the court had met to try the prisoner, and not Major
Goggleheigh."</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt about <i>that</i>," said Sam Freeport,
drily. "Nevertheless, I can't see why Major Goggleheigh should not
say whether or not he had lately repeated matters in public to the
prisoner's prejudice."</p>

<p>"I don't see that at all," replied the objector. "It is clearly
laid down in Simm&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Clear the court!" cried another member, in a loud voice, which
startled the president, and the court was cleared accordingly.</p>

<p>The president had never been on any court martial before. From
his boyhood upwards, till he attained his majority, he had been on
staff employ, and since then it had been his good fortune never to
be called upon to perform such disagreeable duty. He had not the
most remote idea of the principles or the rules of evidence, and
(poor man!) throughout the whole trial he appeared far more
frightened and embarrassed than the prisoner. His inward prayer
was, evidently, that he might never be called upon to give his
casting vote on any question.</p>

<p>The debate was a stormy one&mdash;and Harroway and the adjutant
could almost hear the words of several of the members. The Deputy
Judge Advocate's voice had been overwhelmed in the cross fire that
was kept up between "the well-read man" and Sam Freeport, and the
commentaries from all quarters (except from the president's
quarter) which their respective observations elicited. The tumult
in about twenty minutes dwindled to a calm, and the fact of "the
court's open" was duly announced by the junior member. "The
well-read man," by quoting the authorities (which, by the bye, had
no bearing on the point at issue), carried the day against the
common-sense view of Sam Freeport, and the prisoner was informed
that his second question could not be allowed.</p>

<p>It is not an easy matter for a man, who is unused to
interrogation, to frame questions under favourable circumstances;
but when the natural difficulty is increased by artificial means,
the case becomes desperate. Harroway then wished to know whether
the witness could in any way account for what must have appeared to
him a very unwarrantable outrage&mdash;without reference to the
cricket match.</p>

<p>The well-read man instantly suggested that the witness could
only answer that question from hearsay, and hearsay evidence was
inadmissible.</p>

<p>"Not at all," cried several members with reference to the
witness's ability to speak from personal knowledge.</p>

<p>"Then I'll show it to you very clearly laid down," responded
"the well-read man"&mdash;"with reference to the law;" and he
forthwith dipped into Kennedy.</p>

<p>The well-read man had the reputation of being a very clever
fellow, and when he read aloud the trite truth&mdash;a great
admirer of his exclaimed: "Sure enough. There it is. He is quite
right!"</p>

<p>A murmuring ensued. The president looked to the right and left,
in a painful state of dubitation, until "Clear the court" was
resounded&mdash;when the prisoner and the adjutant left the room
for the third time.</p>

<p>"They are continually clearing the court," remarked Harroway,
when he got outside, "but hang me if it does not seem to be muddier
and muddier after every clearance!"</p>

<p>The Deputy Judge Advocate having obtained a patient hearing on
this occasion, he pointed out very clearly, that there was not the
slightest objection to any of the questions put by the prisoner,
whereupon "the well-read man" reminded the D. J. A. G. that it was
not very respectful to the court to pronounce an opinion on
questions which the court had solemnly decided, and the majority of
the members concurring in this view, the D. J. A. G. was requested
to be more guarded in future.</p>

<p>The D. J. A. G. was a new hand&mdash;lately appointed to the
department&mdash;and smarting under the rebuke, he maintained
silence during the subsequent discussions. The third question was
then thrown overboard, and the court was opened once more.</p>

<p>Harroway had about him the very apology which Major Goggleheigh
had given to Freeport; but Anne had prudently advised him not to
produce it, except for the purpose of contradicting Major
Goggleheigh, if he deposed to no knowledge of former provocation.
Feeling himself, however, at an utter loss as to the means of
bringing his point forward, he produced the apology, and requested
that Major Goggleheigh might be asked whether or not it was in his
handwriting?</p>

<p>The well-read man (Heaven save us from such men!) intimated to
the court that "before <i>documentary evidence (!)</i> could be
received, it was necessary that the court should know what was its
nature, in order that the court might judge as to the propriety of
making it a matter of record or not."</p>

<p>The murmur which commonly precedes the opening of a discussion
had just commenced, when Harroway, in a firm and respectful tone
thus addressed the president: "I remember, sir, about four years
ago, being present at a famous trial in the Court of Queen's Bench.
The witness deposed to certain facts which were not in accordance
with what he had stated in a letter, and the counsel, who was
examining the witness, doubled up the letter in such a way that the
words, 'yours very truly,' and the signature could only be seen,
and then he asked him whether the handwriting was his or not. The
witness owned it, and the letter was then read out in court. Now,
sir, if that was irregular, I think it would not have been
allowed."</p>

<p>The president breathed hard, and looked straight before
him&mdash;(oh! such a vacant look!)</p>

<p>"Have you any report of that case? Can you mention any book
where it is to be found?" inquired the well-read man.</p>

<p>"I have not," replied Harroway.</p>

<p>"Then," said the well-read man, looking round the court with an
air of triumph, occasioned by a consciousness of his own sagacity,
"then, I am afraid the court would not be justified in trusting to
the prisoner's memory, especially when Hough speaks so plainly as
he does."</p>

<p>"What Hough is that?" asked Sam.</p>

<p>"The major!" replied the well-read man, proudly.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't place much reliance on <i>his</i> opinions,"
observed Sam. "As for the case alluded to by the prisoner, I
remember it well. I was present at the time."</p>

<p>"<i>With</i> the prisoner, perhaps?" suggested the well-read
man.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, <i>with</i> the prisoner."</p>

<p>"Clear the court!" cried the president, for the want of
something else to say&mdash;and the court was cleared
accordingly.</p>

<p>"Well, if military law is not a perfect farce," exclaimed
Harroway, "all I can say is, that it is very like one."</p>

<p>"It is like most human institutions, my good fellow," remarked
the adjutant, who was a shrewd man, "it is open to be greatly
abused by an indiscriminate selection of those who are eligible by
rank (though not qualified) to dispense the duties entrusted to
them."</p>

<p>"Oh! hang your philosophy!" remarked Harroway, laughing. "I'm a
<i>practical</i> man, my dear sir."</p>

<p>"The court's adjourned till to-morrow!" cried out the junior
member. "Come in!"</p>

<p>"The case ought to have been settled in an hour," muttered
Harroway. "Confound your human institutions, say I. I only wish
they were a little more humane, and not so trying to the
temper!"</p>

<p>* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Harroway related to his wife all that he could remember of the
day's proceedings. She was not well pleased; for it seemed to her
that the majority of votes, which prevented him putting such
reasonable questions, would carry a verdict and severe sentence
against him. She therefore modified his defence very considerably,
and directed the appeal more to the passions than to the reason of
the tribunal. As far as Harroway could judge, he thought there were
nine against him, and four favourably disposed. They talked over
what they might do, if the worst came to the worst, and although
Anne put a very bright face upon their prospects, in good truth
they were far from cheering.</p>

<p>While Harroway and Anne were debating about what might be done
in the event of his being cashiered, a very different scene was
being enacted at the house of the president, who had a dinner party
on that evening, to which Sam Freeport had been invited. The
president took Sam into a corner of the drawing room, and reverted
to the court martial, while a young lady was squalling away at the
piano&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:10%">"A place in thy memory, dearest,<br>
Is all that I claim;<br>
To pause, and look back when thou hearest<br>
The sound of my name."</p>
<br>

<p>"What do you think of this business?" asked the president.</p>

<p>"I only hope," said Sam, "they don't publish the reports of
courts martial in this country."</p>

<p>"No; they don't," said the president. "But why?"</p>

<p>"Because," said Sam, "they will take us to be a parcel of born
idiots. I don't like to tell you what is generally said&mdash;but
really&mdash;oh! How very nicely this young lady sings!"</p>

<p>"Never mind the singing," said the president, in great anxiety.
"What do they say?"</p>

<p>"I don't like to tell you," said Sam. "'Pon my word, how
beautifully she touches her instrument; and, except Persiani, I
never knew a woman who had her execution of voice."</p>

<p>"Never mind her voice," said the imbecile president of the
general court martial; "tell me what they say?"</p>

<p>"Then it must be in strict confidence," said Sam, looking as
grave as possible.</p>

<p>"Oh, in <i>strict</i> confidence," said the agitated old
man.</p>

<p>"Well," whispered Sam, "they say&mdash;mind you, they say, but I
don't&mdash;they say that when the commander-in-chief comes to read
the whole affair, he will give us all a most owdacious wigging; and
as for you, he'll make you an invalid."</p>

<p>"God bless me, you don't say so!" responded the president. "Why,
I should only draw 900 Rs. (£90) a month, and perhaps get a mere
nothing for retiring?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you will draw," said Sam. "I only tell you
what people say."</p>

<p>"How could it be averted?" asked the president.</p>

<p>"Why, by taking a firm line," replied Sam. "By exercising your
authority, and putting a stop to a parcel of ridiculous discussions
and forecastle quibbles, which will bring the whole of us into
disgrace, and make us marked men for life."</p>

<p>"But how can I do it?" said the president.</p>

<p>"Why, by snubbing the first man that makes ridiculous
objections. But, recollect, you must be firm," said Sam.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll be firm!" said the president. "Yes, you are quite
right&mdash;I'll be firm. I don't want firmness."</p>

<p>"I know you don't," quoth Sam. "But what I desire is to see you
exercise it."</p>

<p>"The invalids?" soliloquized the president, in Sam's presence
and hearing. "The invalids? I'll write to my friend, the
adjutant-general to-morrow, and tell him I am suffering' acutely
from <i>tic douloureux</i>."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER
XXXVII.</a>
</h2>

<p>ON the second day of the trial, a change came over the spirit of
the court. The prisoner was allowed to put whatever questions he
pleased, and the well-read man was in a minority on all the points
he mooted. The president was not so firm as might have been
expected from his promise; still, his fears of being invalided for
imbecility awakened him to a sense of his authority, and he tore up
all the slips of paper which the well-read man threw across the
table, without looking at the observations thereon written. The
proceedings were at length closed, the verdict found, the
punishment awarded, and the packet despatched to the supreme
authority, for confirmation or otherwise. Harroway made up his mind
that his commission was gone; but his wife had a presentiment that
nothing so calamitous as that would happen to them. Twenty-five
tedious days passed away, and the Harroways were hourly expecting
their doom. At about two o'clock one morning, Sam Freeport's voice
was heard in the verandah. He was shouting out, "Bearer, open the
dur-wazy (door)&mdash;quick, you!" Harroway got up, and welcomed
his old friend warmly, although he believed him to be the harbinger
of bad news.</p>

<p>"Here's a pretty business," said Sam.</p>

<p>Harroway was afraid to inquire.</p>

<p>"Just what I expected!" Sam continued. "They made a mess of it,
and you are all right!"</p>

<p>What a relief was that sentence to the mind of Harroway, and to
the mind of his wife, who was listening on tip-toe at the door.</p>

<p>Anne dressed hastily, and went out to hear the particulars,
which Sam declared to be these:</p>

<p>"The court," said he, "found you guilty, and sentenced you to be
placed at the bottom of the list of the lieutenants; but the
commander-in-chief is of opinion that you ought to have been
<i>cashiered,</i> and therefore he has not approved of the sentence
given by the court, and you are therefore to be released from
arrest, and ordered to return to your duty. The colonel has this in
a private letter. The general order will not be here for the next
five days."</p>

<p>"How very fortunate!" exclaimed Anne.</p>

<p>"You may well say that," returned Sam; "but it is just my luck
that befriended him. If I had not got that apology from old
Goggleheigh, you could never have produced it, and then your case
would have been better than it was, and the loss of rank
sufficient; for, don't you see, George, that after accepting an
apology, your conduct was the less excusable; and this view has
doubtless been taken at head quarters. I hope it will teach you a
lesson to be more careful in future. Let us have some brandy and
water. It is of no use going to bed now, as I must be up for parade
in a couple of hours."</p>

<p>They sat talking till the day dawned. Freeport was as happy at
the result as were the Harroways themselves; and most heartily did
he make them laugh by his imitation of the president, and various
other members of the court martial.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER
XXXVIII.</a>
</h2>

<p>FREEPORT was now put to his wits end to ward off the importunity
of his creditors. He had to sell everything he possessed to meet
trifling debts and pay his servants. Instalment after instalment
remained unpaid to the bank, and the secretary was beginning to
grow weary of receiving very lengthy letters about everything but
the payment of what was due and owing. It is true, Sam sometimes
alluded to it in a P.S., but not often. Harroway had been applied
to on Sam's account; and he told the truth&mdash;namely, that he
had paid, and would pay his own debt; but that it was entirely out
of his power to meet the engagement entered into for his
friend.</p>

<p>Freeport was then threatened with an action; but he remonstrated
against so harsh and arbitrary a proceeding in such warm, or rather
such cool terms, and recommended patience, so forcibly, as the
quickest way to get paid all, that his epistle had a marked effect.
He then took it into his head to bore the bank for an additional
loan; and his correspondence with the secretary was becoming so
bulky and unprofitable, that it was deemed advisable to let Captain
Freeport alone, and say nothing about the original debt, at least
for the time being; and that was all Freeport wanted.</p>

<p>It was resolved at last to sue Sam for the amount of his
balance&mdash;some nine thousand rupees; and a writ of summons was
accordingly served upon him. He caused the document to be framed
and glazed, and had it hung up amongst his pictures, resting
assured they would never go to such lengths as they threatened. But
he was disappointed. One evening, on going down to the ghaut to
meet the steamer, he met a Calcutta bailiff, who instantly made his
acquaintance.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say," said Sam, in an expostulatory attitude,
and putting his hat well on one side, while he whiffed away at his
cheroot&mdash;"you don't mean to say you have arrested me?"</p>

<p>"I must do my duty, sir," observed the bailiff.</p>

<p>"Of course you must," said Sam; "England expects that every man
will do his duty. Of course you must. Well, my good sir, how shall
we travel? The prospect of meeting my old friends in Calcutta
delights me. Shall we go by land, or by water? I hope you are well
provided with money to defray our expenses; for, as you may
reasonably suppose, I am very hard up, indeed."</p>

<p>"I think, sir, we had better go down by the steamer, sir,"
responded the bailiff. "They tell me, sir, there will be a downward
boat the day after to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I am agreeable to anything," said Sam. "Meanwhile, come away to
my quarters."</p>

<p>As they proceeded to Sam's bungalow, Sam asked the bailiff an
infinity of questions on various topics. The trip from Calcutta;
the fare on board the flats; the temperature on the river; the
healthy condition, or otherwise, of the metropolis, &amp;c. &amp;c.
&amp;c.</p>

<p>"Have a glass of Madeira and a biscuit," said Sam, when they
entered the bungalow.</p>

<p>The bailiff thanked him.</p>

<p>"Look here," whispered Sam, extending his eyelids; "I shouldn't
like it known just yet that I am arrested; for it is very probable
that I may be able to arrange it in the course of to-morrow, or
next day; and I have a few friends coming to take a quiet dinner
this evening, and play a rubber of whist. Couldn't you put on a
frog coat, and a stock, and come out as a military man, just for a
day or so, or until we go away together?"</p>

<p>The bailiff smiled, and Freeport continued:</p>

<p>"Oh, of course you can. Come in here, and I'll rig you out. Be
reserved, and say as little as possible."</p>

<p>Freeport had taken charge of a host of things belonging to an
old friend of his, in the 3rd Dragoons, and amongst them was a
frogged coat, an undress cap, and other articles of uniform.</p>

<p>Having dressed the bailiff up, he gave him the name of his
friend, "Captain Drones, of the 3rd Dragoons."</p>

<p>The bailiff gave Freeport to understand that he couldn't allow
him out of his sight; but upon Sam's word of honour that he would
never think of an "escape," or anything of the sort, the
restriction was taken off, and a mutual understanding arrived at.
Freeport, in the meanwhile, wrote a letter to the doctor, and
begged to be placed on the sick-list for a few days, as he had a
violent bleeding at the nose, which was always increased by the
sound of musketry.</p>

<p>The evening came, and Freeport's guests dropped in one by one,
and were respectively introduced to his friend, "Captain Drones."
The dinner was placed on the table, and the bailiff took his seat
on the host's right hand. Sam wanted to fill him with wine, but the
bailiff was cautious and abstemious. Sam was frequently observed to
laugh&mdash;at nothing, seemingly&mdash;but the party assembled
little dreamt of what was passing through his brain, and what
intense fun it was to him to reflect on "how deuced well the man
looked in decent uniform."</p>

<p>When the dinner was over, Blew ran out the card tables; and
while he was doing so, George Harroway remarked to Freeport, that
Drones was a very mild sort of fellow.</p>

<p>"Ah! poor fellow," said Sam. "He has a good deal on his mind at
present. The fact is, he is not himself, George. A better hearted
fellow never existed. The more you know him, the more you will like
him. He is a very reserved and haughty man; he always was; but it
wears off in time. Just let me ask him if he will cut in."</p>

<p>Freeport glided across the room, and inquired of the bailiff if
he would have a hand at cards? The bailiff had not the slightest
objection, for he was fond of whist, and played remarkably well. It
was his good fortune to be the major's partner, and they scored up
a heavy rubber against Sam and George Harroway.</p>

<p>"I say, old Drones," said Sam to the bailiff, "by Jove, if you
go on in this way, blow me if you will ever get paid. Recollect,
you have a horrid bad prospect before you. Eh, old boy? Drink a
glass of Madeira."</p>

<p>The bailiff loosened his stock and chuckled in a manner which
made Sam Freeport laugh so uproariously he could not pour out the
wine without spilling it over the counters.</p>

<p>It is extraordinary how prepossessed some men become with others
with whom they win money at cards, or any other game of chance. The
major grew to like Drones, and thought him a very amiable person.
He looked over the defect in Drones' pronunciation of the English
language, and regarded his dropping the letter "h" rather as a
misfortune than a fault.</p>

<p>"Don't you see a great difference, Captain Drones, in Sam?"
asked Harroway, with a view to teaze Freeport. "Has he not aged
awfully?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," answered Sam. "Am I, Drones? Eh? Play away,
old boy. A club led. Aged! Not a bit of it. I'm as young as ever.
Ain't I, Drones?"</p>

<p>"I don't see much difference," said the bailiff.</p>

<p>"Of course you don't," continued Sam. "Who ever did? Play away!
Singing, 'Ring a ting ting a ting tong, this world it runs round
upon wheels.' I say, Drones; don't look over my hand. It's a
d&mdash;&mdash;d bad habit you have contracted since we played
together last."</p>

<p>The bailiff denied the charge in a very serious manner; so much
so, that the major and Harroway mistook the man's nature for an
inimitable display of humour, and they began to laugh loudly, an
amusement in which Sam Freeport heartily joined.</p>

<p>"Come over and breakfast with us to-morrow morning," said the
major to Freeport.</p>

<p>"I am afraid we can't do that," Sam replied, "for Drones has
some business to settle with Smyth, and I am going to take him down
in the morning."</p>

<p>"Then come and take a quiet dinner with <i>us</i>," said
Harroway, "and we will have a rubber afterwards."</p>

<p>"I am afraid we can't do that either," said Sam, "for reasons
which I will explain to you by and bye.&mdash;What's that? A heart?
I've got none. There's a trump. Take it up, George. There's
another!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXXIX">CHAPTER XXXIX.</a>
</h2>

<p>"DRONES! Drones! Derrick Drones!" pondered Anne, when Harroway
informed her of the name of Freeport's guest. "Why, George, that
must be the man of whom Freeport tells so many good stories."</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth, I thought him dull," replied Harroway.
"But then Sam says he is not himself just now."</p>

<p>"According to Freeport's description, he must be a man of
infinite humour, and I have some curiosity to see him. He has only
one eye. Has he not?"</p>

<p>"No. He has as many eyes as I have. What made you think that?"
asked Harroway.</p>

<p>"Because I am convinced Sam has told me that his friend had the
misfortune to lose an eye. Are you sure, George?"</p>

<p>"Sure! Why, you cannot suppose I would be mistaken on a point
like that? I am not blind of either of my eyes, thank heavens!"</p>

<p>Now this was one of those points which Anne never would give up.
All that Freeport had told her of Drones she remembered, and
amongst other things, that he had but one eye. She therefore
reverted to the question, and caused Harroway to be vexed.</p>

<p>"I tell you what it is," he exclaimed, "the man has most perfect
sight, and that's enough. Say no more about it."</p>

<p>"But really, George, it is so provoking to be contradicted on a
matter of which I am so certain. It is not impossible for you to be
mistaken. What could have induced Freeport to describe a man as
blind of one eye, if he had perfect sight?"</p>

<p>"Very well; have it so!" murmured Harroway. "Have it so: but I
am quite prepared to swear the contrary of your view. There let it
rest. I shall say no more about it." And thereupon, after the
fashion of most persons who make similar declarations, he began a
long harangue on the obstinacy and positiveness of the female
character.</p>

<p>Anne retaliated, and the dispute was not likely to be closed
that night; for both parties were perfectly satisfied that the
other was wrong. To put an end to the matter, and to show his wife
the absurdity of pitting hearsay against sight, he wrote the
following note to Freeport, and despatched it at once:&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:5%">"My dear Sam,<br>
<br>
Has your friend Derrick Drones one eye or two?<br>
<br>
Yours, G. H."</p>
<br>

<p>To this Freeport replied,&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:5%">"Only one: but keep it secret. How came
you to guess, eh?"</p>
<br>

<p>"This is more than I can understand, Anne," exclaimed Harroway,
when the reply came back. "It seems you are right, after all. But I
would not hesitate to take my oath this moment that he has two
eyes. To me it is inexplicable how there could be any difference on
such a point."</p>

<p>* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Sam introduced the bailiff to every one who called upon him, and
three days passed over without any negotiation respecting the debt.
He had just made up his mind to obtain a month's leave on very
urgent private affairs, when it struck Sam that he might pledge the
tiara of diamonds, and raise the money from a wealthy merchant in
the station, when, to his intense joy and satisfaction, he received
a letter from his brother, containing a bill upon a mercantile
house in Calcutta for one thousand pounds. Sam had no difficulty in
discounting this bill at twelve per cent., and two and a half
commission; and the bailiff being "satisfied," he embarked on a
downward boat, and returned to the City of Palaces.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XL" id="CHAPTER_XL">CHAPTER XL.</a>
</h2>

<p>THE mail which brought Freeport the means of paying his heaviest
debt, brought the Harroways a very odd letter from old Newsham. It
was incoherent in some parts and indefinite in others; but the
strain throughout was wild, joyous, and light-hearted. Still it did
not afford Anne much happiness, for she feared her father was
engaged in some rash and glowing speculation, which would reduce
him a second time to poverty, and make him, perhaps for ever, the
inhabitant of a prison. Harroway did not view it in this light,
thinking that it augured a certain fortune, in which they would
share, eventually.</p>

<p>The Sonepore race meeting was about to take place, and Freeport
proposed that the Harroways should go. Anne objected on the ground
of expense, but George over-ruled the objection, and bade her make
ready.</p>

<p>They had never before seen so many persons, all known to each
other, encamped together. The novelty of the scene rendered it
pleasing, and, forgetful of all their debts and difficulties, they
felt perfectly happy.</p>

<p>The races commenced, and the stand was crowded with spectators.
Very large odds were loudly offered on a favourite steed, and
without looking at the animals, Freeport cried out "done;" and
Harroway, trusting to Sam's luck, followed his example. In less
than a quarter of an hour they were each sixteen hundred rupees
richer. Sam was satisfied, and, like a prudent man, declined to run
any more risks. Harroway, on the contrary, feeling a glow of good
luck, had another venture or two and lost back the sixteen hundred
rupees, and several hundreds besides. Small as the sum actually
was, it was to them a great consideration, and how to pay it, and
be punctual with the instalment to the bank, caused Anne a good
deal of anxiety, and made her very uncomfortable during the
remainder of the meeting. All the while she was laughing, and
amusing the many who flocked around to listen to her merry and
witty tongue, she was calculating their means, and inwardly
denouncing her husband's folly.</p>

<p>As they were returning to their home, and crossing the river,
Anne said to her husband, "Since you have given an order on the
paymaster for your losings, it behoves us to think how we are to
provide for the monthly call."</p>

<p>"There's lots of time to think of that," was Harroway's
remark.</p>

<p>"No; there is very little time," she replied. "The day is
drawing near, and it would look bad to be behind hand."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't bother about it now. I am thinking of something
else," he retorted.</p>

<p>"It strikes me, George," she rejoined, with a most winning and
humorous smile, "that we cannot do better, under the present
circumstances, than dispose of our plate and take to German
silver."</p>

<p>Harroway was horrified at the proposition, but he could not help
joining in her laugh.</p>

<p>"There is a great deal of fun," she observed, "in thinking of
the poverty of the rich. Is there not, George?"</p>

<p>"I don't see any fun in it at all," he replied.</p>

<p>"Don't you, dear?" she rejoined. "Well, I declare it is very
amusing. Do you know, I feel certain that before long we will be in
very different circumstances, and the most pleasant reminiscences
of our lives will be these days of pinching, screwing, and
contriving. The sum you have lost is small, very small; and it
might, you know, have been great, very great, for you had immense
temptation and I wonder how you withstood it; but, at the same
time, it behoves us to meet the affair, and so to arrange that it
may not give us any temporary or subsequent annoyance."</p>

<p>"You are a good old creature, Anne," said Harroway, conscious of
his own inferiority of mind. "You may do just as you like."</p>

<p>They landed and walked to their home, but not a servant was to
be seen. They entered the bungalow, and Harroway called loudly for
candles, but no answer. He proceeded to the out buildings, and
found them deserted also. A lucifer match gave them a light, and
with the aid of a small wax taper they discovered that the abode
had been stript of all that was of any value. In the bed-room, the
ayah was found, stretched upon the floor in a state of
unconsciousness. The poor woman (the only faithful servant they
had) was under the influence of some very powerful narcotic,
evidently administered some twenty-four hours previous to the
arrival of her master and mistress.</p>

<p>Anne rushed to her dressing-table to get some
<i>sal-volatile</i> from the medicine chest, but the medicine chest
also had been carried away. Her work-box even was gone. Nothing
remained but the bare table, a few chairs, and an old mattress to
lie down upon. The servants had conspired, robbed the house, and
made a safe retreat into some other part of the country.</p>

<p>"IT is pretty certain that the bank will get no instalment this
month, although we shall be obliged to take to German silver,"
observed Harroway. "What are we to do?"</p>

<p>"I confess I am unable to devise any scheme, George. Unless you
can ask those whom you assisted in former days to assist you, now
that you are in a difficulty," replied Anne.</p>

<p>"There is only one man who is in a position to lend me money,"
said Harroway, "and I used to accommodate him so often before he
came in for what he has, that really I feel justified in asking
him; albeit, the prospect of repayment is certainly very remote. It
is a disagreeable thing to remind a man of an obligation; but there
is no help for it in my case." With these words, Harroway walked
quickly to the house of a young lieutenant, not very far distant
from his own abode. He found his friend in an unsettled state of
mind, and a groan frequently escaped him.</p>

<p>"You don't seem very comfortable this morning, Beavy," said
Harroway. "What is the matter?"</p>

<p>"Did you ever feel conscious of having been cheated?" asked
Beavy.</p>

<p>"Often," replied Harroway.</p>

<p>"Then you know how vexatious it is?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it is most annoying to feel that you have been
cheated."</p>

<p>"And by a scoundrel whose very physiognomy, independent of his
manners, ought to have induced you to shun him as a low,
disreputable villain, who ought to be scouted. But there is some
excuse for me. I had taken too much wine."</p>

<p>"I hope you have not been stuck?" said Harroway.</p>

<p>"Stuck?" echoed Beavy. "Stuck? I have been cheated out of six
thousand rupees by that Captain Rooke, at écarté. Here is a copy of
the scoundrel's ill-spelt note, reminding me that he is 'off
to-morrow, and if it would be convenient,' &amp;c."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry to hear it," returned Harroway. "But it serves
you right; for you heard his character discussed the other night at
the mess table; and you must have heard it said that he 'rooked'
Rosbourne out of nearly a thousand pounds, by taking points from
Rosbourne, and flattering his skill, when it was well known he
could have given Rosbourne eighteen out of twenty-four."</p>

<p>"All very true," quoth Beavy. "All very true; only the
misfortune is, George, we always find out our folly when it is too
late to repair it."</p>

<p>It was not the time to ask for a loan from his friend; and
Harroway paid a visit to Freeport, who was just as badly off as
himself.</p>

<p>"Why don't you ask Beavy to pay the instalment for you?" said
Sam. "He would do it in a minute."</p>

<p>"I doubt not he would," said Harroway; "but then he has just
suffered an awkward loss, and I don't like to ask him."</p>

<p>"What loss?" inquired Sam; and Harroway related the
particulars.</p>

<p>Freeport was very angry, and sent to Beavy to appear before him
immediately.</p>

<p>"So you have been a regular fool, to play with a noted
leg&mdash;have you?" commenced Freeport, when Beavy entered the
room. "Have you paid him?"</p>

<p>"No, not yet," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Then do so at once. Send him a cheque instanter. I have not the
most remote doubt on my mind you were cheated; for I am quite
satisfied no man with such a villanous countenance as that fellow
has could play fair if he tried. If his luck were ever so good, he
would assist it with his art. But never mind, <i>I'll</i> have a
hand with him, and we'll see if he rooks me. He drops his cards,
does he? A card-dropper, eh? Pay him the money, Beavy, and if I
don't get every penny of it back again, never trust to me
again."</p>

<p>Freeport sat down, and wrote the following note:&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:5%">"MY DEAR ROOKE,<br>
<br>
Give me the pleasure of your company to tiffin, after which we will
have a little mild play.<br>
<br>
Yours,<br>
<br>
S. FEEEPORT."</p>
<br>

<p>Rooke took the bait, and at about half-past one he was at
Freeport's bungalow. Sam greeted him very graciously, and after a
hasty, but hearty meal, they were both engaged. Sam played away in
his usual careless maimer&mdash;looking about the room,
occasionally patting his dog on the back, and discoursing with
Rooke on indifferent subjects, unconnected with the game, while his
adversary was intent on the points and counters. Freeport won
several games, and as many gold mohurs; and Rooke proposed to
increase the stakes to <i>five</i> gold mohurs.</p>

<p>Sam assented, and they fired away again. Rooke was dealing, and
while Sam was drinking a glass of beer out of a large pewter
tankard, gave himself eight cards, instead of five; four of these
cards he contrived to drop "by accident," and, by the same
"accident," only picked up one of them. The remainder were left
till the hand was played out, when Rooke afforded himself an
opportunity of putting them into the pack. The score was getting
heavy against Freeport, and Rooke was becoming remarkably
<i>facete</i> and loquacious.</p>

<p>"By the powers, look at that!" he would ejaculate, whenever Sam
turned up a king. "Blood an' ouns! what a narrow escape I had."
(This phrase always followed his marking a point.) "Marry, come up,
my jewel!" (This was whenever he looked out for a king himself, and
<i>got</i> one.)</p>

<p>"What are you about?" cried Sam, as Rooke fished up one of his
dropped cards.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" src=
"1600601h-images/IMAGE-6.jpg"><br>
<br>
</p>

<p>"I've dropped a card. Who's play is it?" said Rooke.</p>

<p>"You dropped a whole handful," replied Sam. "Just look under the
table."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" cried Rooke, somewhat disconcerted, and looking
under the table. "Faith, there are cards down, but <i>I</i>
couldn't have dropped them."</p>

<p>"Do you take me for a fool?" asked Sam. "Do you suppose I have
not observed you do the same sort of thing at least a dozen
times&mdash;and always at this particular point of the game?"</p>

<p>Rooke became very pale. With a tremendous effort he recovered
himself, and asked Sam what he meant. The reply was, "I believed
you to be a cheat and a scoundrel before, and now I am certain of
it."</p>

<p>Rooke got up, with the intention of leaving the room; but Sam
cut off his escape by standing in the doorway. "You are not going
to get off so easily as you expect, my good fellow. I find you
guilty of disgraceful malpractices, and I'll punish you," said
he.</p>

<p>"What nonsense it is, kicking up a row," said Rooke, feeling
alarm at the fixed and firm look of the good-natured Freeport. "If
you dispute the thing, why the account does not stand, and there's
an end of it."</p>

<p>"No, there's not," quoth Freeport. "I believe you victimized a
young officer of my regiment last night, and you were paid this
morning. He declared you had cheated him, and my object in asking
you to come and play here, was to find out how you did it. I am
happy to think I have been successful. Are you prepared to disgorge
your last night's winnings?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but say nothing about it," said Rooke, handing over
Beavy's cheque, with a sigh. "There now, it is all right. I hate
disputes."</p>

<p>"What an atrocious villain you are," replied Sam. "And I fear
there are more of your kidney in this country; fellows who sit
down, without the slightest remorse, and rob a young man of his
means, and plunge him into debt for the remainder of his life. If I
should ever rise to be the commander-in-chief, I'll take a line of
my own, and hang such scoundrels as you are."</p>

<p>"What's the use&mdash;&mdash;" (Rooke was about to speak.)</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, sir," roared Sam, "or I will send for my
servant to horsewhip you. The number of fathers, brothers, and
sisters that are caused anxiety and annoyance by such harpies as
you, is beyond calculation."</p>

<p>"Come, come, now&mdash;&mdash;" (Again Rooke tried to
speak.)</p>

<p>"By the Lord Harry," exclaimed Freeport, "if you interrupt me
any more, I'll have your hands tied behind your back, and I'll send
for the band, and have you dragged through the cantonments to the
tune of the Rogue's March. I am a quiet fellow, generally; but when
I am roused, I am a British lion. Is there any chance of a
notorious swindler like you commanding a regiment? What are you?
How do you stand in your corps?"</p>

<p>(Rooke was a senior captain at this time. He hid his face in his
hands, and writhed under the address from Freeport.)</p>

<p>Freeport resumed&mdash;"I have been informed, on the most
undoubted authority, that you are now receiving a monthly payment
of fifty rupees from a mere boy&mdash;out of his pay&mdash;for
money won from him at cards. Is that true, or not?"</p>

<p>"Oh, quite false!" said Rooke.</p>

<p>"You <i>lie,</i> sir," returned Freeport; "and unless you
confess it&mdash;nay more, unless you give me the boy's name, and
write to absolve him from further payments&mdash;leaving me to
forward your letter&mdash;I will bring the whole matter to the
notice of the authorities."</p>

<p>"For God's sake!" cried Rooke.</p>

<p>"You wicked monster," ejaculated Sam, "to say such a thing. My
terms are these; and I call on you to conform to them. There's the
pen and ink and paper."</p>

<p>Rooke attempted to write, but his hand shook so fearfully he
could scarcely pen a word sufficiently plain to be read.</p>

<p>"What have you written?" said Sam, snatching the paper from him.
"You begin with 'My dear Charley.' Are you not ashamed of yourself?
You will be hung yet; and if I should happen to be within a
reasonable distance of the place of execution, I'll go and see you
swing. I feel that I could smoke a cheroot, and have pleasure in
observing your agonies. Now I come to look at you, I remember
having seen you some few years ago at a billiard room in
Dublin."</p>

<p>"Never was in Dublin in my life," said Rooke.</p>

<p>"What!" cried Sam; "I would swear to you! You were constantly
playing with that famous marker. I know you by your eye: and now I
come to think of it, they told me that you had won £10,000 of an
Indian prince? How did you do it? By billiards, cards, or
<i>dice,</i> or by what, <i>eh?</i> Did you ever win ten thousand
of such a person, or not?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you were in Dublin?"</p>

<p>"Now you mention it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mention it, you villain! Yes, I <i>will</i> mention it."</p>

<p>By this time Sam was pretty well exhausted, and he abruptly
showed Captain Rooke the door. As that gentleman was walking out,
Freeport raised his foot.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLII" id="CHAPTER_XLII">CHAPTER XLII.</a>
</h2>

<p>FREEPORT never mentioned to any of his brother officers the
particulars of what passed between himself and Captain Rooke. He
returned to Lieutenant Beavy his cheque, and suggested that George
Harroway was in sad want of money, and he (Beavy) ought to offer
him assistance. The suggestion was acted upon, and the Harroways
were temporarily relieved from their distress of mind.</p>

<p>The climate of India began to make a fearful inroad on the
constitution of Anne, and the continued dread in which she lived of
some calamity overwhelming them completely altered her
appearance.</p>

<p>Harroway saw this, and it made him more miserable than could be
well described. Anne's clear intelligent eye lost its brightness;
her laugh was as frequent, but nothing like so hearty; and those
indomitable spirits, which, hitherto, were rarely known to flag,
were now kept up only by a violent effort of nature. She aged
suddenly, as it were, in appearance; and the mind seemed to follow
her looks. The regiment was ordered to proceed upwards, to another
station, and it was necessary to prepare for the march. They had
very little to "pack up," but Anne had scarcely strength to perform
that duty. As for Harroway, he was, in all such matters, perfectly
useless.</p>

<p>It gave Freeport great pain to observe the marked difference in
Anne, and he felt as much for her as did her husband. It pained him
to see her smile at his pleasantries, for her smiles were full of
hollowness and despair; and what was more painful still, she seemed
to cultivate her own original wit for the purpose of leading others
to suppose she was not unhappy; and many a time and oft, when her
quaint sayings elicited peals of laughter, she could not disguise
that she shared not in the enjoyment she occasioned.</p>

<p>"I hate, detest, abominate, and abhor this country," said
Harroway, shutting up the regimental order book, which gave the
detail of the march. "I have a great mind to sell out and go
home."</p>

<p>"Don't think of such a thing," said Anne. "You would be very
foolish to give up your profession now; and after all, dear George,
this is a better poor man's country than England. There is no want
here; and by living prudently we can always live happily."</p>

<p>These words had scarcely passed Anne's lips, when the major was
announced. He did not even speak to Anne, but walking up to
Harroway, he shook him by the hand, and said, "What a lucky fellow
you are, George. I am very glad of it."</p>

<p>"Oh, very lucky," replied Harroway; "very lucky. Sit down,
major. What is the news?"</p>

<p>"Nothing particular; but I think you need not have been so
reserved."</p>

<p>"About what?" inquired Anne.</p>

<p>"Now, none of your mystery," said the major. "And George, too,
pretending to keep the thing quiet, is uncommonly good."</p>

<p>"You are the mysterious person, major," said Anne. "I have not
an idea of what you are alluding to, and I am sure George has
not."</p>

<p>"Charlotte was acquainted with the old lady," said the major,
"and we never knew, strange to say, that you, George, had any
expectations in that quarter."</p>

<p>"Upon my life, you are talking parables, major," remarked
Harroway, "and neither of us can fathom them!"</p>

<p>"Have you not had any letters by this mail?" asked the
major.</p>

<p>"Not one!" replied both Harroway and his wife.</p>

<p>"Did you know an old lady named Blaney?" said the major, looking
at Harroway.</p>

<p>"Of course I did," he answered. "She was a first cousin of my
father's. Old Blaney was a West India merchant."</p>

<p>"Well, she is dead," quoth the major.</p>

<p>"I hope she is happy, and has left us something," said Anne, who
had never heard her name before.</p>

<p>"Left you something!" quoth the major. "But you are trifling
with me. You must have heard of it."</p>

<p>"I assure you, we have heard of nothing," Harroway asserted.</p>

<p>"Then I am delighted to be the first to tell you that you have
come in for a large fortune," said the major; "at least a hundred
thousand pounds! Mrs. Blaney has left you all she possessed."</p>

<p>"It cannot be true," said Harroway. "And, if she did, depend
upon it there would be some flaw or other, which would deprive me
thereof. Besides, had it been the case, major, some one of my
friends or relatives would surely have written to me."</p>

<p>Anne believed that her husband had come in for Mrs. Blaney's
fortune; but George only smiled at her hopes. But he listened
attentively to her <i>pros</i> and <i>cons,</i> and never slept a
wink the whole night.</p>

<p>The next morning brought the Harroways not less than
twenty-three overland letters. The very postage on them drained
Anne's purse of the last piece of silver. The budget portended a
change of circumstances, and they knew not which envelope to break
open first. Old Newsham's well-known hand invited the earliest
notice&mdash;the more especially as his letter was addressed to
Harroway, and not to his daughter, as usual.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, George?" said Anne, when she saw her
husband's hand tremble, and the colour recede from his cheek, while
he was reading.</p>

<p>"He says," replied Harroway, "that he is a
millionaire&mdash;that we are to return to England immediately, and
that he will restore to me the whole of the fortune he was the
cause of my losing. He adds, that his wildest visions are all
realized; and begs to be kindly remembered to Sam Freeport. I can
read no more," replied Harroway. "I feel quite as faint as I did in
that dreadful moment when I was made sensible of having lost it
all. Indeed, dear, I am not equal to this."</p>

<p>Anne shuddered, and grew chill, on the momentary reflection that
her thoughts for the future had ceased&mdash;that come what would,
or could, George would no longer have to struggle for the means of
livelihood. They sat looking at each other for at least ten minutes
without speaking. At length Harroway laughed idiotically, and
opened another letter.</p>

<p>"Can this possibly be real?" exclaimed Harroway.</p>

<p>"What, George?" said Anne, fancying that he alluded to what her
father had written.</p>

<p>"Why, Anne, that Mrs. Blaney has left me the whole of her
property, which is stated to be worth £76,000. The major was right,
it seems. This letter is from a disappointed young gentleman, who
throws himself on my bounty&mdash;so he writes."</p>

<p>Anne could not trust her husband's eyes, and attempted to read
the letter herself; but her tears prevented her.</p>

<p>Harroway opened a third letter, which came from a man named
Bates. It ran thus:&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:5%">"MY DEAR HARROWAY,<br>
<br>
You broke off our correspondence, some years ago, by expressing an
opinion that you neither credited my word, nor trusted my honour. I
was your debtor, without the means of paying you; and my
circumstances, bad as they were, were embittered by so severe a
remark. I have just come in for moneys which ought to have fallen
to me long before you ever had an opportunity of wounding my
feelings; and I lose not a moment to remit you the sum of seven
hundred and twenty-five pounds, and trust, that in acknowledging
the receipt, you will do me the justice to admit that, numerous as
the blackguards of this world may be, I am not worthy of being
included in the category."</p>
<br>

<p>"Seven hundred and twenty-five pounds!" cried Harroway.
"Bah!"</p>

<p>"Don't look at it in that way, George," said Anne. "Think of
yesterday, and of our conversation last night, and you will not
feel half so proud, George. We have committed several lies to
paper, since we have been in difficulties, and it is hard to judge
our neighbours uncharitably."</p>

<p>"What a teetotum world it is, to be sure!" said Harroway, after
reading the fourth letter, and without reference to his wife's
admonition. "Look at that. I have got my promotion, for only £300
above the regulation. Send the bearer out for wax lights, my love;
it is impossible to read by these mutton fats; and only look at the
mass of correspondence I have got to wade through. Hulloa! here is
a curious affair, sealed with a thimble, and directed to Mr.
Captain George Arroway, 'Squire, Leftinnent of the &mdash;&mdash;
Regt. of Foot in the Fort of William in the East Indies of
Bengal."</p>

<p>Anne was too happy to laugh at the odd address of this letter;
but when George put it on one side, and laughed, and muttered to
himself, "we can look at you by-and-bye," her curiosity was
excited, and she begged him to give it to her. He complied with her
request, and looked her in the face, prepared to hear that it
disclosed some unimportant act of boyish folly, which in poverty
would have jagged his very soul, but which in affluence he could
turn into jest.</p>

<p>Anne opened the epistle, and read as follows&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:5%">"HONERED SIR,<br>
<br>
If you please Sir my husbind ringed the bels, Sir, for you weddin,
and thou you gave the Clergeemen his fea, and pade evry body still
my husbin was never recompensed, poor man, who dide in aperplexy,
and was sorely distressed for bred at the time. I ear you are
coinin gold in indee, and if this be true I only ope you will be so
good as to remember the day as when you karried offe the most
amiablest of girls that ever warked on God a mighty's hearth.<br>
<br>
"I in great respect remain your obedient<br>
<br>
"SARAH WADHAM."</p>
<br>

<p>George Harroway laughed heartily, when he heard this appeal; but
his wife shed tears, from the sheer reflection that, had that
letter reached them only a few days before, it would have given her
more pain than all the debts that ever were hanging over them.
Through the vista of wealth, she could see, in her imagination, old
Sally Wadham's face, and while she read to her husband the
remaining letters, which were of no import, the days of childhood
became so vivid, she could not believe that there was a roaring sea
between herself and the walls of dear old York.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIII" id="CHAPTER_XLIII">CHAPTER XLIII.</a>
</h2>

<p>THE Harroways were vastly amused at the change which came over a
few of their limited acquaintance. Persons who had been barely
civil, became oppressively polite. Not that they expected any
favours from these rich folks. The devotion appeared to be paid to
their wealth, for the sake of its power. The poor subaltern might
have called all round, anxiously wishing for an invite; but in
vain. The same man, with so many thousands a year, was teased for
his conversation.</p>

<p>Freeport borrowed sufficient to pay off all his debts; and Anne
in her secret heart would have been delighted had they amounted to
double the amount, that George might show him how welcome he was to
their help. Sam, with all his coolness and quaintness, was a man of
good principle, and fearing lest he should die, and George Harroway
never be paid, he insisted on Anne taking care of his tiara of
diamonds and emeralds, on the plea that he was afraid it might be
lost on the march, as Blew had taken to drinking. He felt that his
luck would be in danger, but he preferred running the risk to
leaving Harroway without security. He "made a fool of himself" when
he parted with his "best of friends," and covering Anne's hands
with kisses, he shed tears which would have made George jealous had
they escaped any other man.</p>

<p>"I know not what there can be in this country to make me like
it," said Anne, as they embarked on the steamer, "but I leave it,
George, with a thousand regrets."</p>

<p>"Mention it not," replied her husband. "When I once put foot on
British soil, I shall shudder at the very name of India."</p>

<p>"That is very ungrateful of you," she rejoined. "Even this dull
place, wherein I have spent many an anxious and wretched hour,
seems to say <i>'good bye'</i> to me in so kind a way that I am
sorry to part with it."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIV" id="CHAPTER_XLIV">CHAPTER XLIV.</a>
</h2>

<p>WHEN they arrived at Calcutta, Rosny got hold of Harroway and
wanted him to embark a sum of money in an "opium spec," which was
to yield a profit in five months, of quadruple the outlay, but
George smiled, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, Rosny. I have been stung once, and now I am all for
<i>safety</i>."</p>

<p>"Come and dine with us to-morrow evening," said Rosny. Harroway,
without thinking, mechanically answered, "We shall be very happy."
He was sorry that he accepted the invitation, a moment afterwards,
for he feared Anne would be displeased; but it could not be
avoided, and he didn't like to retract, lest Rosny should take it
ill.</p>

<p>Anne was indignant and irate, when informed of the engagement,
and she threw so much of her own spirit into her remarks, she
reminded Harroway that although she had been a forbearing and a
passive woman, as a poor man's wife, she was no longer to be
trifled with; she reminded him warmly of his neglect of her, and
notwithstanding he tried to laugh it off, he felt humbled in her
presence. His manners, however, were so kind, and he so readily
offered to write an excuse, that Anne's alarms were soon dispelled,
and she experienced a strong curiosity to witness the meeting, and
some sorrow that she had so severely reproached him.</p>

<p>The Rosnys were living in the same extravagant style, and in the
same house. They had a large party, and by the time the Harroways
were announced the greater portion of the company had
assembled.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rosny wore her most becoming dress, and her prettiest
smiles. She shook Anne warmly by the hand, and greeted her, and
said how happy she was they had met again; but when she pressed
George's hand, gently, she became pale, agitated, awkward, and
silly. She endeavoured to disguise her confusion by talking rapidly
and in a lively strain, but she gave utterance to the most
exquisite nonsense. Rosny was a remarkably shrewd and sharp man,
and he could see an immense deal; but then he was a man of peculiar
temperament, and had a strong dislike to looking. He opened a
conversation with Mrs. Harroway, all about the Upper Provinces,
where he had never been; and he contrasted them with the lower, and
dwelt with emphasis on the superiority of "tone" in the society of
the latter. Anne yielded, for while she was assenting to
propositions, it was easy enough to use her quick grey eyes, and
observe her spouse and Mrs. Rosny, who were chatting together very
cozily at the other end of the room, Mrs. Rosny having led him
there to show him a beautiful engraving, which, to her infinite
disgust, the provoking-man admired, and commented upon in the most
matter-of-fact manner possible, without once looking tenderly into
the large and lustrous blue eyes, which had in readiness for him a
most imploring expression. She raised her marble arm, and pointed
her pretty little finger to a figure in the picture which she most
admired, or pretended to admire, and while she did this, she showed
the dimple in her elbow; but the heart of Harroway had grown as
cold as the stone to which I owe my metaphor. She sighed audibly;
and Harroway was cruel enough to ask her if she had ever travelled
in one of the company's accommodation boats; and when those
delicate coral lips sorrowfully said "No," he was unfeeling enough
to say, "Then you have no idea of the comfort of them. The
Government deserves the greatest credit, really; for I question
whether they pay or not. They carry, comparatively speaking, very
little cargo, and the number of passengers cannot be very great."
All this, too, was uttered in a rather loud and demi-pompous
demi-affected tone, so different from the gurgling whisper adopted
by Mrs. Rosny when she dilated on the merits of the
engraving&mdash;"the young Jewess appealing to the inquisition in
Spain."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rosny was determined that Harroway should flirt with her.
She had shown him extreme kindness when most people were
indifferent to him, when he was a "mere nobody," as it were; and
now that Rosny described him as a man of "enviable capital," she
considered that her honour, or rather her reputation, was at stake
if she did not gain an ascendancy and enlist his affections afresh;
but the winningness of even a very handsome and very lively woman
was of little avail with a man of whom misfortune had made a
perfect fool, and whose reason had returned with the tide of
prosperity. The cold "good night" which Captain Harroway bade Mrs.
Rosny cut her to the soul; but it made her a more exemplary woman
than ever she had been before, although old Rosny thought her a
much more tiresome creature.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLV" id="CHAPTER_XLV">CHAPTER XLV.</a>
</h2>

<p>THE regiment reached its destination, and Sam Freeport made the
acquaintance of all the leading people at the time referred to. The
never-ending topic of conversation was banks and investment of
capital. Freeport listened very attentively to several of the chief
orators on these subjects, and picked up all the conventional
jargon applicable thereto. He then set himself up as a first-rate
financier, and discoursed on all sorts of monetary transactions, in
such wise as to induce all who listened to him to believe that he
knew more about such matters than most men in the country. The
result was that Sam Freeport was invited, in a most complimentary
letter, to become a bank director.</p>

<p>Sam said that his money was all locked up in England, and he
could not, therefore, command the required qualification. That
difficulty, however, was very soon got ever. A single share was
transferred to him, and registered in his name, and sure enough,
there was Samuel Freeport, Esq., published to the world as a bank
director.</p>

<p>The officers of his corps were convulsed with laughter when they
came to hear of it; and Sam's open and avowed declaration that he
would never refuse any poor devil a loan, no matter who he might
be, tended to increase the merriment. His remarks in "the
minute-book" were extremely clever, if they were only looked at as
"wordy nothings," bearing the appearance of deep thought and
considerable experience. For some time Sam neither did any harm nor
good. He attended regularly, for the sake of the chat over his cup
of coffee, and voted with the majority whenever there was a
difference of opinion. But at length there became a balance of
power, and a show of party, when Sam Freeport (a man who never
could keep an account in his life, or look after his own little
means), virtually regulated the disposal of operations, which, with
justice, might be deemed "stupendous." Sam saw pretty well which
way the wind was blowing, and determined to be fair to both
parties. He therefore, before going to a meeting, would spin a
rupee in the air, and call out, "if it is Billy, the king, I vote
for Bosher, if it is a woman, I vote for Slew;" and acting honestly
up to his resolution, he frequently got the credit of being a
variable and inconsistent director, who did not know his own mind
for two meetings together. But Sam also got the credit of being a
very straightforward, upright, and conscientious man, and no
parsnips in this world were ever more plentifully buttered with the
real lacteal produce, than was Sam Freeport with sweet words from
both parties. Frequently would he laugh to himself, while in the
act of shaving, and exclaim&mdash;"Upon my soul, it is quite
refreshing to hear such universal testimony to one's perfect
knowledge of all business transactions," and then, spinning the
rupee, he would add, "well, what's the odds, so long as we're
happy? Here goes!"</p>

<p>One Wednesday morning Sam Freeport, as usual, attended in his
directorial capacity. A very important question was discussed. It
involved a very strong measure, which might be viewed in fifty
different lights by the proprietary and the public at large. His
co-directors, as usual, were divided, and it came to Sam's turn to
give his opinion. He forgot, at the moment, whether Bosher or Slew
had won the toss, and the very fact of his forgetfulness made Sam
go off into a violent fit of laughter, whereupon he was reminded by
every one that the question was one of great weight.</p>

<p>"I have a deuced good mind to vote with <i>you,</i>" said Sam,
to a gentleman (Slew) who could not help laughing at Freeport's
expression of face. "We are evidently the only people who
agree."</p>

<p>"How do you mean?" said Bosher, a little frightened, for he was
deeply interested in the issue.</p>

<p>"Why, that the whole thing is a regular farce," replied Sam.</p>

<p>"I don't see that," said Slew.</p>

<p>"Don't you?" said Sam. "Then I'll vote with Bosher, and prove
it."</p>

<p>There was an immense sensation, during which Bosher cried
out&mdash;"Vote, Freeport, vote away&mdash;vote, my good
fellow&mdash;Slew is badgering you&mdash;vote away, Freeport."</p>

<p>"No, I'm blow'd if I will!" cried Sam. "Look here! While our
deliberation was confined to a sort of pawn-broking business, I
contented myself with voting by <i>head</i> or <i>tail</i>."</p>

<p>"Explain," cried Slew, indignantly.</p>

<p>"I understand you, Freeport," cried Bosher, in a conciliatory
tone. "But vote away, Freeport, and discuss it afterwards."</p>

<p>"No! no!" quoth Sam. "I am not so easily to be caught, old boy.
What I mean is this: I have thought it more impartial to spin a
rupee in the air, and thus leave to Providence and chance an honest
correction of human passions and prejudices, self-interest, and so
forth; but since I find a really weighty and important question, I
am awakened to a sense of my own impropriety in pretending to
control what I don't comprehend; and if two-thirds of us did the
same, it would be an act in accordance with our consciences,
however displeasing it might be to our vanity. The idea of this
farce being enacted twice a week, eh!"</p>

<p>Sam threw himself back in his chair, and roared with laughter;
then, suddenly assuming a grave face, and bending forward, he
remarked:</p>

<p>"I only hope it may never be turned into a tragedy. From this
hour I have done with it. But, before I go, I will record the only
sensible minute perhaps I have made in the books&mdash;namely, that
it would be much better to give a man fifty thousand rupees a year
for the entire management of the concern, and place him above
temptation, and make him more responsible, than pay as we do now,
and be subject to this absolute mockery."</p>

<p>"You are quite wrong," cried Bosher.</p>

<p>"I can't see that," said Slew. "But vote away, Freeport. It is
getting late, and I want to smoke a cheroot. Vote, my dear fellow.
Bosher is cantankerous&mdash;vote away!"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," retorted Sam. "It would be rascally, I think,
in me, with nothing at stake here, to trifle with the interests of
men who have thousands of pounds embarked in the Institution. I
reproach myself for doing what I have done already. I retire. Good
bye to you. I wish you all success."</p>

</h2>

<p>IN order to prove, beyond all question, that he had become a
steady character, and was a completely altered man, Sam Freeport
transmitted to his relatives in England, copies of the newspapers
wherein he flourished as a bank director. He moreover interlarded
his letters so thickly with "percent.," "premium," "dividends,"
"stock," "reserve," &amp;c., &amp;c., that they believed his heart
and soul were devoted to money making. His rich brother, who was a
man of liberal spirit, was delighted at the change that he fancied
had come over Sam; and feeling conscious that Sam's extravagant and
careless turn of mind had alone prevented the old man from sharing
his property more favourably to the youngest son, he determined on
doing the proper thing, and increase Samuel's store. Four thousand
pounds were accordingly remitted to Sam, as a gift, and a hope was
expressed that it would soon be doubled by prudent management.</p>

<p>When Freeport received the letter, he chuckled, rubbed his
hands, and resolved on going home on medical certificate. Another
fortnight found him packing up his traps, and very shortly after he
was in Calcutta, where he threw away a goodly sum of money on
frivolities, and renewed his acquaintance with Mrs. Rosny, who was
more civil and kind to him than when he was quartered in the
Fort.</p>

<p>No man ever left the shores of India, perhaps, with so extensive
a circle of acquaintance as Sam Freeport. He appeared to know
everybody, and everybody knew him. His visit to England was without
any object beyond that of seeing the Harroways, and talking over
troubles which were past and gone.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLVII" id="CHAPTER_XLVII">CHAPTER XLVII.</a>
</h2>

<p>AFTER a few days' stay in Bath, the Harroways set off for York.
It was a dark and foggy night when they entered the city; but Anne
fancied she could see the inmates of every house they passed. How
sweet to the ear was the dialect of her town's-people, and how
impatient did she become to arrive at her father's door. A wagon in
one of the narrow streets impeded their progress, and the post boy
was obliged to rein in and walk the horses. Anne hurriedly put down
the glass window, and called out to him to go on faster, faster! It
was not possible; and presently they had to stop; for the post-boy
having bullied the wagoner, he gave his horses a rest. The chances
were they would be half an hour detained in that narrow street, and
Anne suggested to her husband that they should walk, and leave the
carriage to follow them. It was cold, and Harroway had just awoke
from a sound sleep. He therefore recommended patience. But Anne
opened the door and sprung out, and he was compelled to follow.</p>

<p>"Is this what you call walking, Anne?" laughed Harroway, as he
ran after his wife.</p>

<p>"'The more haste the less speed,' I declare," cried Anne. "I am
weary, George&mdash;support me!"</p>

<p>She leant upon his arm, and walked quietly, till they reached
the well-known door.</p>

<p>Old Newsham was all alone. Since he had taken to dabbling in
stocks so extensively as he then was doing, he suffered none of his
family to be in the house with him. His mind was bent on figures,
and the slightest interruption almost drove him mad. He expected
his favourite child every moment; yet he was intent on a very
intricate calculation, and debating with himself the best way of
making a good "hedge" in a grand project he had just engaged in. A
long and loud rap at the door assured him Anne had arrived, albeit
he heard not the sound of carriage wheels. Still, old Newsham
stayed to multiply 93 by 66 before he seized the candle and rushed
from his office to the hall. He could not have recognised Anne, but
for her voice and her eyes. They, alone, were unchanged. He used to
be very proud of Anne's girlish looks, and he felt sorry to find
they had departed. She did not look old, but <i>passe'</i>; and
this, Newsham did not expect to find in Anne, at twenty-three years
of age.</p>

<p>But time had altered Newsham, even more than it had altered his
daughter. His hair was as white as snow; his forehead, from
continual thought and anxiety, was a mass of small wrinkles or
furrows; his eyes were restless, and always wide open; he had a
way, too, of pinching his fingers, and biting his under lip, which
Anne had never observed in him before. Formerly, Newsham was a very
talkative man, and his manners were blandness and suavity
personified; but he had become so reserved and silent, that his
demeanour almost amounted to rudeness. He had not exchanged more
than a dozen sentences with Harroway and Anne, when he touched upon
business.</p>

<p>"I will restore to you," said Newsham, seizing his pen, and
making figures on the blotting-paper, "I will restore to you the
amount of property you lost through my advice, and an awful sum it
is to give up, certainly (he sighed). But, recollect, Captain
Harroway, that the money you embarked as an investment ought to be
deducted; for, if a man speculates on another's advice, and loses,
he ought to pay for it himself."</p>

<p>"Oh! certainly," said Harroway&mdash;"certainly."</p>

<p>"And then, there is another thing," said Newsham. "That money
which I <i>first</i> deposited for the purchase of your company,
that ought to be deducted. It was on your account, you know."</p>

<p>"By all means," conceded Harroway.</p>

<p>"With interest," observed Newsham.</p>

<p>"Yes, with interest."</p>

<p>"Of course, the money that I deposited a second time you will
repay to me, because you have the value of it in your
promotion?"</p>

<p>"That, of course!"</p>

<p>"That, also, with interest?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And there are several other matters of smaller importance, but
which I must have deducted. Now, to-morrow, I shall not have one
moment to spare; I have a meeting here, to transact some very
important business. Here are bills on my bankers, in London, which
will be accepted on presentation. The amount is one hundred
thousand pounds; for the rest, you must give me a little time."</p>

<p>"This is much more than ever I expected," replied Harroway.
"But, tell me, will the payment distress you?"</p>

<p>"Distress me!" sneered the old man, with a toss of his head.
"The world is too full of fools for all that!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLVIII" id="CHAPTER_XLVIII">CHAPTER

</h2>

<p>ANNE did not feel so happy in the home of her childhood as she
had anticipated. She had pictured to herself that it would remind
her of days and scenes when she had never tasted of sorrow, and
when the heart seemed bursting with its excessive joy. But all was
changed. The walls were bare, and there was a cold,
poverty-stricken appearance about the whole place, which made her
miserable. They could hear Newsham pacing the room, and talking to
himself. Anne got up, crept down stairs, and looked through the
half-opened door. There stood her father, gesticulating, as though
he were making a speech in a confidential manner, and explaining to
a number of persons something which they did not comprehend. Then,
he sat down, and grinned placidly; then, he seized his pen, and
wrote with wonderful rapidity. She thought the old man must be mad,
or that he had some project in his head which had for its end,
delusion, deceit, and illicit gain. The thought that either the one
or the other suspicion was well-founded wounded her to the soul.
She returned to her room, and imparted her suspicions to her
husband; and she further suggested the prudence of George's
realizing his money and securing it. Harroway laughed at her ideas
of danger; but that wonderful foresight, which some women are
possessed of, caused her to press the matter; and at length she
brought him over to be guided by her advice, and insisted on his
going to London, without delay, and losing not a moment in drawing
his money from her father's bankers. Anne began to doubt, indeed,
whether so large a sum was forthcoming, and thought that, perhaps,
the old man only fancied he was possessed of so much wealth as he
talked about. This created in Harroway a kindred doubt; and the
next morning, at daylight, he took a place in the mail coach for
London, leaving Anne alone with her father.</p>

<p>When Anne came down to breakfast, the change in her father's
habits was even more visible than ever. Instead of everything
around him being clean and comfortable, if not costly, there was a
filthy tablecloth, spread upon the commonest deal wood table, two
or three cups and saucers, of various patterns, bone-handled
knives, and steel forks, pewter spoons&mdash;and all the other
table appointments to match. He asked a few questions about India;
but evidently they were not asked out of mere curiosity, but with a
view to some speculation. He was about to order a carriage and
horses to convey Anne to Thorp Arch, where her sisters and her
mother were residing; but suddenly he checked his hand, and told
Anne she had better write in her husband's name. The meanness which
characterised this act of her father's was very palpable, and it
shocked, while it amused her. A half-starved cat, which belonged to
the cook (the only servant he kept) came and mewed piteously beside
Anne's chair, and she instantly cut a piece of the cold mutton and
gave it to the poor creature.</p>

<p>"Good God, child!" cried Newsham, "where on earth did you learn
such extravagance? Consider the starving creatures in the streets,
who would be glad of that wholesome meat! Rats and mice, and such
vermin, are the proper food for dogs and cats. When they cease to
provide for themselves they become useless. Never bestow your
bounty upon animals."</p>

<p>"You used to be very fond of dogs and cats, father," said Anne,
smiling.</p>

<p>"I know, my dear, I used to be very fond, in former days. I hope
you have not forgotten the meaning of <i>fond</i>. But I know
better now. I made a calculation the other day, and I proved that,
if I had saved all the money which I threw away on dinners,
parties, and follies, for a period of seventeen years, and had gone
on compounding the interest every three or six months, the
difference would have been to me no less than forty-three thousand
pounds. Supposing I had saved £700 the first year&mdash;the
interest of that for three months at 4 per cent, would have been
£7. The interest of that £707 for three months more, would have
made it amount to £714 14s., and so on. Then when the second year's
savings came to be added, it would have gone on like a snow ball,
till at last it would have been a mountain. Compound
interest&mdash;Compound interest! Oh, it's a wonderful&mdash;a
glorious&mdash;thing, when you come to think of it. And so very
simple, too. A child may see it. The money that is squandered in
this world is beyond conception. Here is a pewter table spoon. If
it were of silver, its value would be ten shillings&mdash;if I kept
it for twenty years&mdash;it would cost me £30 or £40, if not more.
Think of that! Oh!"</p>

<p>"But then you give up comforts," argued Anne.</p>

<p>"Indeed not," responded the old man, "I am as comfortable now as
ever I was in my life. I want nothing beyond what you see
here."</p>

<p>"Then your argument cuts both ways. What is the use of great
wealth, if you do not want it?" urged Anne.</p>

<p>"You speak foolishly," said Newsham. "But it is my fault. I
brought you up in absurd notions of show&mdash;instead of teaching
you the benefits of substantiality. It cannot be helped now. Here
is the carriage. I will see you all on Sunday."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIX" id="CHAPTER_XLIX">CHAPTER XLIX.</a>
</h2>

<p>HARROWAY, in person, presented his bills on Newsham's London
banker. It was an anxious five minutes that he passed while the
old, bald headed man who was at the head of the firm inspected
them&mdash;pressed his forehead&mdash;muttered "three days' sight,"
and referred to a large ledger which was spread open before
him.</p>

<p>The old man put on his spectacles&mdash;looked at
Harroway&mdash;and said, in a slow and measured voice&mdash;"Mr.
Newsham has advised me of these bills. He says they are drawn in
favour of his son-in-law. Are you that party, or his agent?"</p>

<p>Harroway replied, "I am Captain Harroway&mdash;the party in
whose favour they are drawn."</p>

<p>"Who are your bankers, may I ask?"</p>

<p>"At present I have none."</p>

<p>"Then, perhaps you would have no objection to open an account
here?"</p>

<p>"Not the least. I formerly banked with a house in King William
street; but they didn't behave very well to me on one
occasion."</p>

<p>The old man, with a trembling hand, wrote "accepted" across the
bills, and handed them to Harroway. "When they become due," said
he, "if you bring them here, we will carry the amount to your
credit."</p>

<p>Harroway bowed assent, and left the office. He felt somewhat
nervous, without knowing why, and although his bankers in the city
had not behaved well to him, still he knew them to be shrewd men of
business, and it struck him he would consult them. On entering the
little parlour, he was instantly recognised, shaken warmly by the
hand, and congratulated on having come in for Mrs. Blaney's
property.</p>

<p>After a few minutes, Harroway produced Newsham's "accepted"
drafts, and explained all the circumstances relating to them. The
partners looked at each other, and smiled&mdash;much to Harroway's
discomfiture.</p>

<p>"I hope it is all right?" said Harroway.</p>

<p>There was no reply&mdash;and this circumstance, combined with
the last words of his wife, ("George, now, whatever you do, get
your money, and make it safe,") put Harroway on tenter hooks. He
inquired if they would negotiate the bills. They answered
"No&mdash;not without a guarantee and security." He then asked if
they had reasons for doubting the solvency of the acceptors. One of
the partners remarked that the acceptors were mixed up in a bubble
for constructing a city on the banks of the Ohio, which was to
become the emporium of the whole world; and that for weeks past,
their credit was doubtful. Harroway then told them what the old man
said about "opening an account," and he asked the advice of his old
bankers. They advised him to place the sum to floating account, and
draw it out by degrees, and here they gave a decided opinion that,
if he attempted to draw the whole sum out at once, the firm might
suspend payment.</p>

<p>Harroway did not sleep for more than twenty minutes together
until the bills became due. He called on the acceptors, and his
fears were almost dispelled by the jaunty air the old man put on,
and the encomiums he passed on Newsham's gigantic powers of mind,
and extraordinary good fortune. He was advised by the old man, not
to allow the money to remain with the bank, but to invest in
American bonds, or buy an estate. This inspired Harroway with
confidence, and he said he "would rather let it remain." Harroway
was invited by the old man to give him the pleasure of his company
to dinner that evening.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_L" id="CHAPTER_L">CHAPTER L.</a>
</h2>

<p>ANNE'S mother and sisters were overjoyed to meet with her again.
But Anne observed a great difference in them. Although their style
of living was in striking contrast to the style she observed in her
father's domicile, still there was a discontented manner in her
mother, which her sisters seemed to partake of. She delivered her
father's message&mdash;that he would see them on the following
Sunday; but it grieved her to find that, instead of the
announcement being hailed with joy, it was heard in silence, and
with apparent regret. Anne began to think that George's money was
in jeopardy, and in that thought she was extremely anxious. She
questioned her relations about her father's affairs, but gleaned no
information; for the best of reasons&mdash;they were unable to
afford any. This redoubled her fears, and Anne longed for the hour
when a letter from George would relieve her mind. The Sunday
morning came, and Newsham arrived at Thorp Arch. All his children
were present, and Mrs. Newsham reminded him of that circumstance;
but he merely tapped his front tooth with his forefinger nail, and
abstractedly remarked that it was "very gratifying indeed."</p>

<p>In the evening the old man walked with his family in the garden;
but in the midst of a conversation he would stop suddenly, and make
calculations on the gravel walk, with his oak stick. He asked Anne
what had become of Freeport, and before she could reply, he quite
forgot having mentioned his name.</p>

<p>Newsham's return to York was a relief to his family; and yet,
when he was gone, they appeared more unhappy than when he was
amongst them. The old servants had heard of "Miss Anne's" return,
and came from a distance to welcome her back, and give her a
blessing. They, too, were changed, and spoke of "bygone days" with
a sigh.</p>

<p>Anne received a letter from her husband; but it was so vague and
indefinite she knew not what to make of it. He believed (he said)
all would be right, and would inform her as soon as it was settled.
She questioned her mother again and again, as to their means; but
she could glean nothing further than that her father had amassed an
immense sum, by speculations, and that he was endeavouring to
double it.</p>

<p>It was the 1st of February&mdash;the anniversary of Anne's
marriage; Newsham was reminded of it, and he came to spend the day
at Thorp Arch. He was unusually cheerful and gay, and more like
what he was in former days. Towards evening dark clouds gathered in
the west, and several flashes of vivid lightning, unaccompanied
with thunder, issued therefrom. Towards nine o'clock the wind
whistled round the house, and old Newsham had an extra glass of
toddy, and sat over the fire, chatting merrily. The wind lulled
about half-past ten, and the family retired to bed. At midnight,
the wind got up again, and increased till it blew a strong gale. By
two o'clock it blew a hurricane, which roared so loudly that it was
almost impossible for men to hear one another's voices. The houses
shook, the chimneys of nearly all of them fell with a crash; and
even on the dry land the stoutest hearts were struck with terror
when they contemplated the fury of the elements. The Newsham family
congregated in one small room, and endeavoured to pacify Anne, who,
when she was awakened, was dreaming that she saw George on the deck
of a Hull steam boat; and nothing would satisfy her that he had not
taken his passage in one of those boats, and was then on his way to
join her. The gale continued throughout the whole of the next day.
The cattle, in the fields, instinctively threw themselves down at
full length, to avoid being driven along and dashed against
whatever might stand in their way&mdash;the birds were blown
towards the southward, unable to stem the howling blast; the
largest trees were torn up by the roots, and those which stood were
stript of their smaller branches; the world seemed coming to an
end, and in the general alarm old Newsham forgot the magnitude of
his transactions, and all that related to them.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LI" id="CHAPTER_LI">CHAPTER LI.</a>
</h2>

<p>NEWSHAM'S London banker, a Mr. Brade, was once a conspicuous
member of society, but having narrowly escaped being convicted of
murder for having shot an antagonist in a duel, he was not known,
by the married and the moral, except as a man of business and a
wealthy banker. Late in life he had married a young lady, who
commenced her career as a singer upon the boards of the French
Opera, in Paris, and who subsequently came to England as governess
to a family connexion of Brade's. She was a very pretty little
Parisian, and she had the most compact little figure imaginable.
Her manners were extremely captivating, and she sang with great
skill and taste. She called herself "Madame La Comtesse de Fleur"
when she first came to England; but she was generally known, after
marriage, as "Madame Brade." She was not "visited" (as the phrase
goes), and she cared very little about that; for she had immense
resources within herself, and she preferred being the queen of all
her husband's bachelor acquaintance, to sharing with others the
admiration that is bestowed upon her sex in large assemblies.</p>

<p>The evening on which Harroway dined with Mr. Brade, he met some
ten or twelve persons who were utter strangers to him. There was a
novel writer of some celebrity, who had made a "heroine" of Mrs.
Brade; there was a magazine poet, who had written at least five and
thirty sonnets to her, and had published them in his favourite
periodical; there was a renowned wit, who invariably allowed Madame
to have the advantage of him in repartee, and turn the laugh that
he raised against himself; there was one Frank Derriden, famed for
his funny songs and irresistible humour; there was a great
antiquarian who had just returned from Egypt; there was a comedian,
into whose face no man could look (until he got used to it) without
laughing immoderately; and there were several partners of various
banks. Harroway was struck with the extraordinary manner in which
Madame Brade divided her attentions. Every one whom she spoke to
fancied he was "the favoured guest," so varied and so winning was
the expression of her face. Before he had been ten minutes in her
company, he seemed to know her just as well as if he had been
acquainted with her all his life. She had taken the trouble (as she
did on all occasions) of previously inquiring from Brade what was
Harroway's profession, what part of the country he came from, where
he had travelled, &amp;c. &amp;c.; and she had an <i>impromptu</i>
conversation, already made for him&mdash;a conversation that fitted
him exactly. There was a degree of levity in Madame Brade's manner;
but then it was mingled with so much <i>empressement</i> and
seeming candour, that it pleased rather than disgusted even the
most scrupulous. During the evening she sang several pieces from
the fashionable operas of the day, and, off the stage, Harroway had
never heard the like before. His soul was entranced; and as he
drove to his rooms in Suffolk-place, he said to himself, "Hang me
if any banker with a wife like that can be an unsafe man. While I
am in town I shall cultivate their acquaintance."</p>

<p>* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>The following morning Harroway called on Madame, and had the
satisfaction of hearing all the people he had met on the previous
night pulled to little pieces, one by one. His vanity was flattered
by certain praises Madame bestowed not <i>upon</i> him, but
<i>at</i> him. The fact was, she saw what was his weak
point&mdash;namely, a full appreciation of riches&mdash;and she
directed her discourse straight for the heart. Harroway was
captivated, and thought her the most delightful creature on the
face of the earth.</p>

<p>On the night of the 2nd of February, Harroway went to a ball;
but finding it rather stupid, he returned early. It occurred to him
that, before retiring, he would write several letters, and he was
in the act of sealing them, when he felt a hand upon his left
shoulder. He was startled, for he had seen no one enter the room.
He turned round sharply, and beheld the face and form of old
Newsham, who appeared to be dripping wet. "Good heavens, sir!"
exclaimed Harroway, "what has brought you to London?"</p>

<p>"Save your money! Trust not to Brade!" was all he heard (or
seemed to hear&mdash;for he was all alone in the apartment).</p>

<p>Harroway was very much alarmed, but he had the presence of mind
to look at his watch. It was ten minutes past one. He tried to
persuade himself that his sight had deceived him; and yet the
pressure on his shoulder was so heavy and palpable, he could not
doubt his sense of feeling as well as of sight. He called the
servants up and questioned them; but one and all protested that the
door had not been opened since he came in. Remain alone he could
not, and therefore he ordered a hackney-coach to be called, went
again to the ball, and stayed till the last of the guests departed,
which was not till nearly five o'clock.</p>

<p>Although he was wearied, Harroway could not close his eyes. The
wrinkled brow and white hair, the bony cheek and compressed mouth
of Newsham, were too indelibly stamped on his memory.</p>

<p>The hour of business came, and he went into the city. He drew on
Brade for half of the amount in his hands. The cheque was honoured,
and on the following day Harroway drew for the remainder. That also
was paid. Then was the time for Harroway's old bankers to "smash"
their great rival and foe. They caused a steady run for a few hours
on Brade's bank, and they broke it!</p>

<p>Harroway was walking down Regent-street, about four o'clock one
afternoon, ruminating on a thousand things, and wishing for the
morrow, that he might be once more on the road towards his wife.
Harroway was in one of those moods when the eye sees, but observes
not; and although he looked in the face of nearly every man and
woman he met, he could not have recollected their features a moment
afterwards. Suddenly, he was seized round the waist, or rather the
hips, and held aloft in the air, by some strong man, who held his
head down, so as to render recognition impossible. After a few
moments, however, he was placed on the ground, and to his wonder
and amazement (for Sam had never told him of his movements) he
beheld Freeport, whose first words were, "Lord, how light you've
got, George! You're a mere feather! What have you been doing, to
make away with yourself in this manner, eh?"</p>

<p>"Good gracious Sam, is that <i>you?</i>" cried Harroway. "What
can have brought you home?"</p>

<p>"Cashiered, sir! cashiered, sir!" answered Sam, in his own
off-handed way. "It can't be helped&mdash;walk along. You must have
heard of it."</p>

<p>"Indeed not," exclaimed Harroway, with a dejected
countenance.</p>

<p>"It could not be helped!" repeated Sam, sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"What was it for?" inquired George, anxiously; but conscious
that it was for no disreputable offence that would affect Sam's
honour.</p>

<p>"The fact is," said Sam, laughing loudly in George's face, "the
fact is, George, they found me guilty of paying ready money for a
variety of things I bought at an auction. What a spoon you are,
George, to be taken in so easily!"</p>

<p>It was an immense relief to Harroway to hear that Freeport was
not cashiered, and right glad was he to see Sam's face again. He
forgot, for the time being, all about his affairs, and proceeded to
ask a hundred questions, and give replies to an equal number.</p>

<p>"Now then, George, let us think of dining. Where do you hang
out?" said Freeport.</p>

<p>"I am staying in lodgings here, in Suffolk Place."</p>

<p>"Lodgings! lodgings!" exclaimed Sam. "A man of your property in
lodgings! Bless my heart, I'm living at the Burlington! And what's
more, I've got a small party this evening. Men in our position in
life, George, can't afford to live in lodgings. Military men of our
rank in lodgings!"</p>

<p>As Sam uttered these words, he assumed a pompous air, buried his
chin in his cravat, and swaggered haughtily along the pavement,
until Harroway stood still, and begged and prayed of him to desist,
and not make him laugh so loudly and indecently in the public
streets.</p>

<p>"Breathes there a man so dead," asked Sam, looking searchingly
into Harroway's face, with an expansive wave of the hand, "who
never to himself hath said&mdash;this is my own my native
land!"</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, Sam, desist!" cried Harroway. "Look, man,
everybody is staring at us!"</p>

<p>"Well, let 'em stare, poor devils," responded Sam. "What did we
come back from Bengal for, but to be stared at? Stare, sir! It is
one of the few glorious privileges of a Briton! Let 'em stare. The
first fellow that I catch staring, I'll shake hands with him."</p>

<p>An old gentleman, with long grey hair, and jet black
moustachoes, caught Freeport's eye. Sam confronted him, and
Harroway bit his lips to preserve gravity.</p>

<p>"How do you do? I'm glad to see your grace out again!" said Sam,
bowing.</p>

<p>The old gentleman bowed, and, in a courteous voice, replied:</p>

<p>"I am General Wight."</p>

<p>"A thousand pardons, General," said Sam. "I thought I was
addressing the Duke of Devonshire."</p>

<p>"Not the least offence," returned the General, with a smile, and
passed on, as Sam raised his hat, gracefully.</p>

<p>"I cannot stand this," laughed Harroway.</p>

<p>"Then I don't know how you will stand the way I mean to gull my
party this evening, about India," observed Freeport. "Really,
George, the people of England will believe anything. Not only the
people, sir, but the higher classes&mdash;men, who you would
suppose ought to know something. But no, sir, you may cram them
without limit or reserve. Hang me, if I have not a good mind to buy
a lot of medals, and give myself out as the hero of Rangoon and
Scringapatam&mdash;the saviour of our dominions in the
east&mdash;stand for the city of London, sir&mdash;get
returned&mdash;carried about on men's shoulders, sir&mdash;and
dragged through the streets in a phaeton, decorated with
flags!"</p>

<p>"You exaggerate their ignorance, Sam," said Harroway. "They are
not so bad as all that."</p>

<p>"Very well, you shall see," said Freeport; "only don't laugh,
and throw a doubt on my statements by doing so."</p>

<p>* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Freeport's party consisted of five gentlemen, whose acquaintance
he had but recently made. There was a member of Parliament (a
Welch-man); a major, on the half-pay list; an unattached colonel,
who had been in the West Indies (and who was in the habit of
telling as many "stories" about them, seriously, as did Sam of the
East Indies, in jest); a student of Lincoln's-Inn, who was then
employed in writing an article on the Afghanistan campaign, for
publication in one of the reviews. This gentleman was naturally
anxious to hear a man who had been in "the very thick of it," speak
his mind openly, and without prejudice to any one. The fifth guest
was a decrepit doctor, who never had had any practice, and who was
never likely to have any, though he was the author of several very
scientific medical books.</p>

<p>The half-pay major had been a very sporting character in his
day, and the cloth was no sooner removed than he said to Sam:</p>

<p>"I say, Freeport, what sort of racing have you in India?"</p>

<p>"The best in the whole world!" said Sam. "I have seen a field of
five-and-thirty Arabs start for a welter. Harroway, don't be a
cork; tool that carriage round, please."</p>

<p>"What's a welter worth?" said the major.</p>

<p>"Oh, four or five hundred gold mohurs, or so," said Sam, with
matter-of-fact coolness.</p>

<p>"And what's a gold mohur?"</p>

<p>A gold mohur?&mdash;Five pound ten."</p>

<p>"Is the pace good?"</p>

<p>"Wonderful!" cried Sam. "My best Arab once did his mile in 1-13,
and was beaten hollow!"</p>

<p>"Were you fortunate on the turf?"</p>

<p>"Very! I won nine thousand pound at the last meeting, at
Crammeramdambore!"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon&mdash;where?"</p>

<p>"Crammerromdodombore," said Sam, emphatically, but boldly,
having forgotten the word he had himself invented.</p>

<p>"How do you manage for jockeys?"</p>

<p>"Natives. People of the country."</p>

<p>"Do they ride well?"</p>

<p><i>"Beau-eu-eu-tifully!"</i> cried Sam, as he lighted a cheroot.
"Very superior to your Day, and your Robinson, and those fellows. A
native, you know, never loses his self-possession. If an English
jockey is collared by his adversary&mdash;if he finds a horse
suddenly on his own beast's quarter&mdash;I don't know whether you
have observed it, but <i>I</i> have frequently&mdash;he becomes
anxious, and sometimes uses the spur and the whip when he might
prudently reserve it; but a <i>native</i> jockey, sir&mdash;a
native of <i>India</i>&mdash;he's as collected, and as cool as a
cucumber; there's none of your top-sawyer movement of the elbows
with him&mdash;none of your muscular movement of the legs." [Here,
Sam Freeport threw himself into the attitude of a jockey
hard-pressed, but gently feeling the animal's mouth, and slightly
grinding him up to the pace required.] "Lord, sir, close as
wax&mdash;the eye intent&mdash;it is beautiful to see them ride!
They have such nerve&mdash;such judgment&mdash;such
temper&mdash;such command. Harroway, do oblige me by passing the
port and sherry coach, and making the claret and madeira follow.
You remember that boy of mine, Harroway, called Corryborry? How
beautifully he used to ride, eh?"</p>

<p>"Superb!" responded Harroway, perceiving that Sam had a <i>carte
blanche</i>. "Superb!"</p>

<p>"I was once compelled to put that boy to a very severe trial,"
continued Sam, looking at the major. "I had a heavy sum on the
event. In this country, it would be considered cruel, but in India
it would not; for endurance and fortitude, without a murmur, is the
characteristic of the genuine Indian, such as he was. I had a match
for 500 gold mohurs. One of my horses against another stable;
Corryborry was to ride. Twice round the course, a distance of four
miles. The boy, sir, said he was a stone too much for the horse,
and that I must lose if I started for the race. These fellows are
deuced knowing, and I listened to him eagerly. After a little, the
faithful Ethiopian remarked: 'Puspration se hoga.' Puspration means
sweating, as you may suppose," said Sam; "se hoga, signifies you
may do it by those means."</p>

<p>"God bless me!" cried the doctor.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," resumed Sam, "it was the cold weather, and I
wrapped the boy up in blankets, placed him before a roaring coal
fire, and poured in hot grog to an incredible extent. Like all the
Hindu race, he seemed to like it, and you never saw a fellow in
such a state of intoxication in your life. Meanwhile, he was
perspiring like fury, and fancying he was in a river, he began to
strike out, as though he were swimming. This made him perspire more
than ever, and at last he was regularly exhausted, and called for
more grog, which I gave him. Well, Sir, as he had to ride the day
after this, I thought it right to make him sober, and sent for a
particular herb, which grows in all the gardens."</p>

<p>"What's the name of the herb?" asked the doctor.</p>

<p>"The native name is kabdub," replied Sam; "but I forget the
botanical name. Do you remember it, George?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I do not," said Harroway.</p>

<p>"Well, the botanical name does not signify," said Sam. "But all
I can say is, that it brought the boy to in no time; and when he
got into the scales the next day&mdash;by Jove! sir, so far from
being a stone over weight, I was forced to put a shot-belt round
his waist, give him a heavy whip to carry, and put the heaviest
stirrups I could find on the racing saddle, just to bring him up to
the minimum weight agreed upon."</p>

<p>"How horribly cruel!" cried the member of parliament.</p>

<p>"Horribly cruel, I admit," said Sam. "But then, we get into the
habit of cruelty in India. We have such examples set us by the
government, one can't help being cruel."</p>

<p>"How do you mean?" inquired the member</p>

<p>"Why, look how the government exacts its rents from the
Zimeedars!" expostulated Freeport.</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"What do I mean?" echoed Sam. "Why, if a poor wretch does not
stump up to the very day, don't they put a ring through his nose,
and drag him through the market-places?"</p>

<p>The member of parliament stared with astonishment.</p>

<p>"Not only the Zimeedars, but the Zimeedaranees," continued
Freeport. "Oh, it's shameful!"</p>

<p>"What are Zeemaranees?" said the member.</p>

<p>"Why, women&mdash;handsome women!" responded Sam, indignantly.
"Women, sir&mdash;<i>lovely</i> women! Have you never seen pictures
of Hindu women with a ring through the nose?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but I thought that was an ornament," said the member.</p>

<p>"Ornament, eh?" said Sam. "Ah, that's how the East India Company
humbug you all! Ornament, eh? Ask Lord Auckland if it's ornament.
What about the Begum Bammeroo's case?"</p>

<p>"I never heard of that," said the member.</p>

<p>"No; of course you didn't," said Sam, filling his glass. "You
never hear of anything. 'Keep it dark,' is the East India Company's
private motto. 'Senatus Anglicæ virtutes omnibus,' and so forth, is
all bosh! You never heard of the Begum Bammeroo's
case&mdash;eh!"</p>

<p>"Never!"</p>

<p>"Harroway, you know all the particulars," said Sam. "Just relate
them."</p>

<p>"Why, really, Sam," replied Harroway. "I don't think it is worth
while. Bygones should be bygones; and it appears to me there is no
prospect of redress."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said the member. "What we want is
evidence."</p>

<p>"Oh, if you want evidence," said Sam, "get up a committee in the
House of Commons, and call on me. I'll give evidence enough about
the state of things in India. Why, sir, you would hardly believe
that not one man in five hundred that you meet in that country, has
a shoe to his foot, a rag on his back, or a covering for his head,
to protect him from the vertical rays of a burning sun. And yet,
here are you all, sitting deliberately in cold debate, and
imagining that the Indian is nursed in the lap of luxury, and
leading a life of affluence and ease!"</p>

<p>"But is there not a free press there?" said the member.</p>

<p>"A free press!" quoth Sam. "Bless your innocent heart, they are
all in the Company's pay. The government there allows them so much
a month to put a good face on everything, and the governor-general
is obliged to come down with something handsome besides. Just ask
Sir John Hobhouse about the free press of India. What could be more
infamous than burking the case of the unfortunate Begum of
Bammeroo?"</p>

<p>"What <i>was</i> it?" asked the member.</p>

<p>"Why, the facts are simply these," said Sam, slowly knocking the
ash off his cheroot with his little finger, and taxing his
imagination to the highest point. "About two years and a half
ago&mdash;just as we were proceeding to
Afghanistan&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The maddest project that ever was undertaken in this world,"
said the student, who was writing on the question.</p>

<p>"Of course it was," conceded Sam; "downright insanity; but of
that anon. I'll tell you all about it, for I was there, on Keane's
staff, and consequently I know everything relating to it."</p>

<p>"Well, but what about the Begum Bammeroo?" said the member,
impatiently.</p>

<p>"The Begum Bammeroo," resumed Sam, "was the only child of the
Dorogah of Juanpore&mdash;an island to the westward of Chundfurm,
in the Central Provinces."</p>

<p>"What is a dorogah?" asked the member.</p>

<p>"A dorogah," said Sam, "is a kind of Scotch laird, or a species
of Prince of Padua, who has come in for his property."</p>

<p>"I understand."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, during the lifetime of the dorogah, he caused an
immense quantity of golahs to be dug."</p>

<p>"What are golahs?"</p>

<p>"Golahs are pits for holding salt&mdash;and he represented to
the government that the number of these golahs was only nineteen;
but after his death, it was discovered that the number was
twenty-seven. On this the secretary to the government put himself
in communication with the minister of the Begum's court, and
without consulting the Begum, who knew nothing about the matter,
the minister swore hard and fast that there was not a golah in the
whole principality. The Governor-general looked on this as a piece
of utter deceit, and he said to himself, 'if, as a mere girl, she
can be capable of this, what will she do when she comes to grow
older?' and without any further ado, he confiscates all her
<i>jagger</i>."</p>

<p>"What's a jagger?"</p>

<p>"Her lands, her principality. Well, sir, the Begum makes an
appeal to the nearest court, through her lawyer, Mr. Daw; and the
judge, Mr. Ogelby&mdash;in hopes of getting into favour with
Auckland, the viceroy&mdash;imprisons the Begum for life, and
sentences Mr. Daw to five years on the roads; and there's the
lawyer now, breaking stones, and the innocent Begum immured in a
garret of her ancestral castle. That's what they call the blessings
of British rule!"</p>

<p>"How strange this has never reached the ears of the Imperial
Parliament!" exclaimed the member.</p>

<p>"Not a bit strange!" said Sam. "It is a part of the system of
concealment that is carried on. As I told you before, you know
nothing of India. As long as you get a return of the exports and
the imports, you are satisfied."</p>

<p>"This state of things shall certainly be brought forward," said
the member.</p>

<p>"And call on me to bear you out," said Sam. "I was born a
liberal; and, by all that's palatable, I will die a liberal.
Harroway, I am quite tired of calling on you to send round the
wine. If you don't drink yourself, my dear fellow, be considerate
towards other people."</p>

<p>"The mortality amongst the troops is very great, I understand,"
said the doctor.</p>

<p>"I should think it was," replied Sam. "It is by no means
uncommon for a company to be 110 strong one day, and on the next
not turn out 25, including the captain and the subs.</p>

<p>"Dear me, you don't say so!"</p>

<p>"I do, though! Cholera, sir, cholera! And yet they go on feeding
the men on buffalo beef, which the medical profession there say is
the very keystone of the disease!"</p>

<p>"I can readily understand that," said the doctor.</p>

<p>"Of course you can," said Sam; "and so can any rational man. But
what can you do against a despotic and obstinate government?
Eh?"</p>

<p>"Very true!" cried every member of the party, George Harroway
included.</p>

<p>Freeport went on, telling the most preposterous fabrications,
which were listened to with interest and avidity, until half-past
twelve o'clock, when the company dispersed&mdash;each member being
delighted that he had acquired some information respecting our
dominions in the East. The member asked Sam, on parting, to allow
himself to be proposed as a member of the Travellers' Club, to
which Sam assented on the reiterated assurance that it was "very
select, and by no means promiscuous.'</p>

<p>"Now, George, we will have a quiet glass of brandy and water and
a weed," said Sam, as soon as his guests had departed. "If I have
overrated the amount of ignorance of the better class of Englishmen
regarding India, you have only to tell me so; if not, why hold your
tongue. What you have heard me say to-night is nothing to be
compared to what I have told my brothers and their wives; and I
give you my word and honour they are as shrewd a set of people, in
all matters connected with this country, as you will meet with in
the United Kingdom. Keep to truth, and you are looked upon as
prosy. Tell them all sorts of lies, and you are regarded as
entertaining and instructive."</p>

<p>"I suspect your friend, the member, will be making a fool of
himself, by acting on your information."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," responded Sam. "He'll forget all about it
before to-morrow evening. He is a rich man, and not an agitator;
and India is so far off, nobody in this country cares a brass
farden what goes on there, except those pecuniarily interested; and
as long as they get their dividends, why, what do they care?"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LII" id="CHAPTER_LII">CHAPTER LII.</a>
</h2>

<p>THE storm had abated towards the evening of the 2nd of February,
and old Newsham became impatient to get back to York. He found a
letter from Brade, amongst others, and he opened it hastily, read,
and trembled; and, seizing the candle, he walked round and round
the room, muttering to himself. Newsham knew that if Brade's bank
failed he would be shackled for years; and the remonstrance about
the bills in Harroway's favour alarmed him. He placed the light
upon the table, seated himself in his large chair, and began to
think how he could meet so awful a contingency as the bankruptcy of
the house of Brade. A bright thought had just flashed across his
brain, and he took a pen in his hand, and looked up at the ceiling.
The pen fell from his hand, his eyes were fixed, not staring, for
the expression, though intent, was subdued; his lips lay apart, and
the whole frame was motionless. He longed to call out for help, but
the voice had gone away. He tried to grasp a pencil to write down a
few words to his wife, to tell her what he had, where it was, and
how to dispose of it; but there he sat, and gazed, unable to move
hand, or foot, or eye. Death, holding in one hand the scythe, and
the hour-glass in the other, stood out in high relief from the
ceiling and beckoned to poor old Newsham to depart with him. He
struggled violently, and endeavoured to rise from his chair, but
Death seemed to laugh at his efforts, and dismayed him. He coveted
the kisses of his children, and a parting word from them, but there
was no hope. His head fell upon his shoulder, and he slept away
from the world as calmly as a weary child reposes its head upon its
mother's breast. He was found next morning by the cook, who raved,
and ran to one of the prebends, to make known the event. His family
came; but no one, except Anne, dared gaze upon poor old Newsham. In
death, the wrinkles had all disappeared, and his forehead was as
smooth as her own. There was a placid smile upon the face, which
looked more youthful than Anne could ever remember it in life. She
seized the hand, which struck a chill unto her heart, and she
faintly screamed as the peculiar electric coldness pervaded her
every vein. She kissed her dead father tenderly, and bitter tears,
"affection's fondest tribute to the dead," trickled from her own
warm cheek upon his. The room was soon crowded, and a middle-aged
man, whom Anne had not seen for many a year, led her away from the
painful scene, and after speaking some words of kindness and
comfort, returned to be the foreman of the jury assembled to
inquire into the causes of the old man's death.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LIII" id="CHAPTER_LIII">CHAPTER LIII.</a>
</h2>

<p>HARROWAY was not surprised to hear of Newsham's death. The
unsettled state of his affairs gave great trouble and anxiety. The
demands upon his estate came in thickly enough; but those upon whom
he had corresponding, or even greater claims, were not disposed to
show themselves. It was a well known fact, that old Newsham might
have retired from business with an immense fortune, but no one knew
where it was, or how invested. His papers, which were intelligible
enough to himself, were mysteries to other people, and the more
they were examined the more inexplicable they became.</p>

<p>After many fruitless attempts to ascertain what was the real
condition of the estate, Harroway advised the widow to avoid
responsibility, and have nothing to say to it; to let it go, pay
its own debts, and get paid as it best could. A provision for the
widow and her children was guaranteed by Harroway for life, and
they left that part of the world where they had experienced so many
changes, and retired to a quiet country town in an adjacent
county.</p>

<p>Harroway and Anne took a tour upon the Continent, and Sam
Freeport betook himself to London, to write a book about the East,
with a view (he said) of getting himself into notice, and
eventually procuring the government of some colonial possession,
where he might leave everything to his ministers, and lead the life
of an absolute monarch. The work progressed but slowly. <i>"Little
and good"</i> was the author's motto, and he therefore filled only
half a sheet of paper <i>per diem</i>. When the work had extended
to what Sam calculated to be three volumes, he took it to a
bookseller, and consulted him about the publication. What was his
disgust to learn that it would only make a decent sized pamphlet.
The mere name of "pamphlet" was enough to shock Freeport. What he
wanted was a <i>work&mdash;a regular work.</i></p>

<p>A government, that of Madras, fell vacant, and Sam sent in his
application, with the following P.S.:&mdash;"I am prepared to carry
out all sorts of economy; and as a proof of my sincerity in making
this statement, I should have no objection to take the office at
two-thirds of the present salary." But it was not on the cards (to
use Freeport's own phrase), and his hopes were blighted by the
claims of others.</p>

<p>Time wore on, and Freeport's means began to dwindle; his
brothers warned him that they would make no further advances, and
that the best thing he could do would be to join his regiment at
once, and endeavour to live on his pay.</p>

<p>"And this is my last five pound note!" soliloquised Sam, as he
smilingly took the piece of paper out of his purse, and kissed; it
for good luck. "Yes, by Jove, you are my last five pound note. In
you consisteth all my worldly wealth. I wish I knew some rich widow
or heiress whom I might endow with you."</p>

<p>"I'll keep you, my darling," continued Sam, folding up the note
and putting it into his pocket. "You shall be a sort of 'reserve
fund;' 'bonus;' a 'par privilege;' a 'divi<i>dend</i>.' Now I
thoroughly understand what they meant by a 'reserve fund.' Yes, you
are my 'reserve fund;' and, though you are a little one, and not
likely to grow any bigger, why, what does it signify, so long as we
have lots of credit? Eh?"</p>

<p>Most men, in Freeport's circumstances, would have glanced at the
past, and sorrowed over the sums they had literally thrown away;
but it was not Freeport's nature to do anything of the kind. With
the past he never troubled himself, and through life he had
invariably felt that no man had a right to make himself miserable,
or anticipate misfortune.</p>

<p>A card was placed in Sam's hand, bearing the name of Mr.
Wrexton, a young gentleman to whom he had on several occasions
shown some civility. The young gentleman was shown up, and after a
few minutes' conversation he invited Freeport to go down into the
country with him. Sam said he was getting very tired of town, and
the change would delight him. The young gentleman remarked that his
aunt, whom he was about to visit, was a very hospitable old lady,
and generally managed to afford her guests a good deal of
amusement. Freeport made his arrangements at once; and it was
understood that they were to start at nine o'clock the next
morning.</p>

<p>Sam beguiled the time with his incessant talk; and from the big
way in which he spoke of his affairs in general, and his portly
manner conjoined, a stranger might readily have concluded that he
was one of the wealthiest and most influential men in all
England.</p>

<p>Towards evening they arrived at a lodge, and after wending their
way through a long avenue of oaks, they were put down at the door
of an old, two storied, brick house, which was nearly covered with
ivy. Freeport was introduced, and Mrs. Wrexton expressed her
happiness to see him. The house seemed full of guests, married and
single, and some seven or eight children, attended by half the
number of nursery maids, were running about the hall, previous to
going to bed. The dinner hour came, and Freeport joined the rest of
the party. There were some six or seven gentlemen, and as many
ladies; and with wonderful rapidity Sam speculated upon all of
them. At dinner time he found himself beside a lady in deep
mourning. Freeport was quite charmed with her conversation, and she
fully appreciated his original remarks and good-natured wit. Sam
felt perfectly happy, and his feelings were depicted in his face.
It was evident to the lady that Sam had not a painful thought or
care in the world, and this she attributed to easy
circumstances.</p>

<p>* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>In the course of the evening, "the lady in deep mourning" was
asked to sing. She went to the piano, and after playing one or two
rather mournful airs, she filled the room with her delicious notes,
and elicited much applause.</p>

<p>"Who <i>is</i> she?" whispered Freeport, to young Wrexton.</p>

<p>"She is the widow, I believe," whispered Wrexton. "But I never
saw her before."</p>

<p>"She is a monstrously fine woman!" observed Sam, in the lowest
tone of voice.</p>

<p>"Very much so," rejoined the other.</p>

<p>Sam moved quietly up to the piano, and resumed the conversation
which was abruptly broken off when the lady left the dinner table.
She looked up in his face, and inquired prettily if he chanted. Of
course he did, and without much pressing, "favoured the company"
with "the old enchanter's part"&mdash;(the lady playing the
accompaniment.)</p>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:5%">"And not a tear or aching heart<br>
Should in the world be found."</p>
<br>

<p>When the ladies retired, young Wrexton proposed whist. To oblige
them and make a fourth, Freeport took a hand; but his thoughts were
elsewhere, and he kept revoking, trumping his partner's tricks,
playing out of his turn, and making other mistakes of a nature very
disagreeable to persons who attend to the game.</p>

<p>The following morning various excursions were in progress. Some
were for visiting a curious rock, some miles distant; others rode
on horseback to the nearest town&mdash;and young Wrexton shouldered
his gun and roamed round the woods for the purpose of getting a
pheasant or two. But Sam declared he had a severe headache, and
therefore preferred lounging about the library, and reclining on a
couch. The truth was this: the widow, at breakfast, refused to join
any party, and Sam stayed at home [he was "at home" everywhere] in
the hope of having a quiet chat with her. And he succeeded in his
design; for as he reclined on a couch in the library, when the
house was deserted by its inmates, the door was opened, and the
lady walked up to one of the shelves, and took down a book, without
observing Freeport (of course) and without being observed, as she
fancied. Sam arose and approached her; but when he spoke, the book
fell, she uttered a faint shriek, turned round, and expressed her
surprise. No woman but an actress could have done it half so
well.</p>

<p>The lady placed her hand upon her heart, as though she wished to
prevent its palpitating; and she breathed quickly through a sweetly
pretty smile. Sam Freeport was on his knees
<i>instanter</i>&mdash;languishingly praying for pardon, which was
granted with a kindliness and grace beyond the power of any pen to
describe, and which few minds can imagine.</p>

<p>Freeport admired the widow excessively, and for her personal
attractions, notwithstanding she was some years older than himself,
would he have married her, had he been a man of fortune; but as he
had but a solitary £5 in the world, or as (in his own words) all
his wealth was in his waistcoat pocket, he was delighted to reflect
that she was well off.</p>

<p>Freeport's attentions became "marked," and it was very clear
that the widow was glad to receive them. One moonlight night, the
visitors strolled upon the lawn in front of the house. After
walking for a short time, Sam led the lady of his love away from
the party, and down the avenue, towards the gate. She looked round
several times, as though she dreaded to go so far away; but Sam
walked on, talking in the most impressive manner, and bidding her
not to be alarmed, and assuring her there were no ghosts or
goblins.</p>

<p>The widow sighed, and so did Sam.</p>

<p>They stopped suddenly, and looking into the widow's face, which
was perfectly beautiful in the moonlight, Sam asked her to be his.
She made no response that could be heard; but she looked assent,
and shortly afterwards spoke to him more endearingly than he was
usually addressed.</p>

<p>Freeport sealed the contract, and they returned together to the
lawn, to be quizzed by young Wrexton, who had himself a great
regard for the widow.</p>

<p>The lady under whose protection the widow was living felt
annoyed that she should wander forth alone with Captain Freeport,
and she showed her feelings so plainly that the widow was very
angry, and in an irritated moment, she spoke in terms which
amounted to ingratitude. This brought down the censure of another
lady, and this worked up the widow into a passion, and she cried,
and declared that she was persecuted.</p>

<p>It was agreed between them that Freeport should proceed to
London, and that the widow should follow, and on her arrival in
town they were to be united.</p>

<p>Sam accordingly took leave of his kind hostess, and returned to
the Burlington; and in his absence, young Wrexton made such
desperate love to the widow, that his aunt became frightened for
his safety, and rejoiced when she left the house, with the avowed
intention of becoming Mrs. Freeport.</p>

<p>With what joy did Sam Freeport receive his intended bride! In
his ecstasy, he quite forgot he was without the means to defray the
expenses of their wedding. But he contrived to borrow £50 from an
old friend, for the purpose.</p>

<p>A week passed very merrily away, and madame proposed that they
should visit France. Her spouse was "quite agreeable to go
anywhere;" but he delicately hinted that his funds were low just
then, and that, if she could conveniently come down, it would save
him a great deal of trouble.</p>

<p>She stared, on hearing this declaration; and, imagining he was
in jest, she smiled.</p>

<p>"Who's your banker?" asked Sam, raising a cup of tea to his
lips.</p>

<p>"Alas!" she cried, "I have no bank."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say you have no money," said Sam, elevating
his eyebrows, and laughing.</p>

<p>"Not one sous. But somewhat in debt!"</p>

<p>Sam whistled, and then remarked:</p>

<p>"Well, my angel, I don't know how we are to manage, for I am
blowed if I have got any."</p>

<p>"I thought," said Mrs. Freeport, seriously, "that you had a
large private fortune."</p>

<p>"I can't help what you <i>thought</i>," he replied, "any more
than I can help what I thought myself; but what I tell you is a
fact."</p>

<p>"I am deceived!" exclaimed Mrs. Freeport.</p>

<p>"So am I, by Jove!" replied Sam; "but what's the odds, as long
as we are happy?"</p>

<p>* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>The Harroways purchased an estate in Leicestershire, and thither
repaired. George kept his hunters, and enjoyed his meets with the
hounds; but his wife could never be prevailed upon to mount a
horse. But she was very happy, nevertheless, and a great favourite
with every one in their neighbourhood. And Anne became the mother
of a fine little boy, to the vast joy of her husband, who was
longing for an heir to succeed to his property.</p>

<p>Sam Freeport and his wife were compelled to return to India, for
the captain's leave was almost expired. He borrowed some money of
George Harroway to purchase his wife's outfit, and in the letter
which contained his demand he inserted the following ominous
sentence&mdash;"I say, George, dear, tell sister Anne, with my
love, that marriage, with me, has been rather a queer
business."</p>
