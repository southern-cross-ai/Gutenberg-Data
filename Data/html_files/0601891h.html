<h2><a id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="first">NOW the rumbling of the great organ swelled to
a roar, pressing, like a rising giant, against the vaulted
ceiling, to burst through it.</p>

<p>Freder bent his head backwards, his wide-open, burning eyes
stared unseeingly upward. His hands formed music from the chaos
of the notes; struggling with the vibration of the sound and
stirring him to his innermost depths.</p>

<p>He was never so near tears in his life and, blissfully
helpless, he yielded himself up to the glowing moisture which
dazzled him.</p>

<p>Above him, the vault of heaven in lapis lazuli; hovering
therein, the twelvefold mystery, the Signs of the Zodiac in
gold. Set higher above them, the seven crowned ones: the
planets. High above all a silver-shining bevy of stars: the
universe.</p>

<p>Before the bedewed eyes of the organ-player, to his music,
the stars of heavens began the solemn mighty dance.</p>

<p>The breakers of the notes dissolved the room into nothing.
The organ, which Freder played, stood in the middle of the
sea.</p>

<p>It was a reef upon which the waves foamed. Carrying crests of
froth, they dashed violently onward, and the seventh was always
the mightiest.</p>

<p>But high above the sea, which bellowed in the uproar of the
waves, the stars of heaven danced the solemn, mighty dance.</p>

<p>Shaken to her core, the old earth started from her sleep. Her
torrents dried up; her mountains fell to ruin. From the ripped
open depths the fire welled up; The earth burnt with all she
bore. The waves of the sea became waves of fire. The organ
flared up, a roaring torch of music. The earth, the sea and the
hymn-blazing organ crashed in and became ashes.</p>

<p>But high above the deserts and the spaces, to which creation
was burnt, the stars of heaven danced the solemn mighty
dance.</p>

<p>Then, from the grey, scattered ashes, on trembling wings
unspeakably beautiful and solitary, rose a bird with jewelled
feathers. It uttered a mournful cry. No bird which ever lived
could have mourned so agonisingly.</p>

<p>It hovered above the ashes of the completely ruined earth. It
hovered hither and thither, not knowing where to settle. It
hovered above the grave of the sea and above the corpse of the
earth. Never, since the sinning angel fell from heaven to hell,
had the air heard such a cry of despair.</p>

<p>Then, from the solemn mighty dance of the stars, one freed
itself and neared the dead earth. Its light was gentler than
moonlight and more imperious than the fight of the sun. Among
the music of the spheres it was the most heavenly note. It
enveloped the mourning bird in its dear light; it was as strong
as a deity, crying: "To me...to me!"</p>

<p>Then the jewelled bird left the grave of the sea and earth
and gave its sinking wings up to the powerful voice which bore
it. Moving in a cradle of light, it swept upwards and sang,
becoming a note of the spheres, vanishing into Eternity...</p>

<p>Freder let his fingers slip from the keys. He bent forward
and buried his face in his hands. He pressed his eyes until he
saw the fiery dance of the stars behind his eyelids. Nothing
could help him&mdash;nothing. Everywhere, everywhere, in an
agonising, blissful omnipresence, stood, in his vision, the one
one countenance.</p>

<p>The austere countenance of the virgin, the sweet countenance
of the mother&mdash;the agony and the desire with which he
called and called for the one single vision for which his racked
heart had not even a name, except the one, eternal,
you...you...you!</p>

<p>He let his hands sink and raised his eyes to the heights of
the beautifully vaulted room, in which his organ stood. From the
sea-deep blue of the heavens, from the flawless gold of the
heavenly bodies, from the mysterious twilight around him, the
girl looked at him with the deadly severity of purity, quite
maid and mistress, inviolability, graciousness itself, her
beautiful brow in the diadem of goodness, her voice, pity, every
word a song. Then to turn, and to go, and to vanish&mdash;no
more to be found. Nowhere, nowhere.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;!" cried the man. The captive note struck against
the walls, finding no way out.</p>

<p>Now the loneliness was no longer bearable. Freder stood up
and opened the windows. The works lay, in quivering brightness,
before him. He pressed his eyes closed, standing still, hardly
breathing. He felt the proximity of the servants, standing
silently, waiting for the command which would permit them to
come to life.</p>

<p>There was one among them&mdash;Slim, with his courteous face,
the expression of which never changed&mdash;Freder knew of him:
one word to him, and, if the girl still walked on earth with her
silent step, then Slim would find her. But one does not set a
blood-hound on the track of a sacred, white hind, if one does
not want to be cursed, and to be, all' his life long, a
miserable, miserable man.</p>

<p>Freder saw, without looking at him, how Slim's eyes were
taking stock of him. He knew that the silent creature, ordained,
by his father, to be his all-powerful protector, was, at the
same time, his keeper. During the fever of nights, bereft of
sleep, during the fever of his work, in his work-shop, during
the fever when playing his organ, calling upon God, there would
be Slim measuring the pulse of the son of his great master. He
gave no reports; they were not required of him. But, if the hour
should come in which they were demanded of him, he would
certainly have a diary of faultless perfection to produce, from
the number of steps with which one in torment treads out his
loneliness with heavy foot, from minute to minute, to the
dropping of a brow into propped up hands, tired with
longing.</p>

<p>Could it be possible that this man, who knew everything, knew
nothing of her?</p>

<p>Nothing about him betrayed that he was aware of the upheavel
in the well-being and disposition of his young master, since
that day in the "Club of the Sons." But it was one of the slim,
silent one's greatest secrets never to give himself away, and,
although he had no entrance to the "Club of the Sons" Freder was
by no means sure that the money-backed agent of his father would
be turned back by the rules of the club.</p>

<p>He felt himself exposed, unclothed. A cruel brightness, which
left nothing concealed, bathed him and everything in his
workshop which was almost the most highly situated room in
Metropolis.</p>

<p>"I wish to be quite alone," he said softly.</p>

<p>Silently the servants vanished, Slim went...But all these
doors, which closed without the least sound, could also, without
the least sound, be opened again to the narrowest chink.</p>

<p>His eyes aching, Freder fingered all the doors of his
work-room.</p>

<p>A smile, a rather bitter smile, drew down the corners of his
mouth. He was a treasure which must be guarded as crown jewels
are guarded. The son of a great father, and the only son.</p>

<p>Really the only one&mdash;?</p>

<p>Really the only one&mdash;?</p>

<p>His thoughts stopped again at the exit of the circuit and the
vision was there again and the scene and the event...</p>

<p>The "Club of the Sons" was, perhaps, one of the most
beautiful buildings of Metropolis, and that was not so very
remarkable. For fathers, for whom every revolution of a machine-wheel
spelt gold, had presented this house to their sons. It was
more a district than a house. It embraced theatres, picture-palaces,
lecture-rooms and a library&mdash;In which, every book,
printed in all the five continents, was to be found&mdash;race tracks
and stadium and the famous "Eternal Gardens."</p>

<p>It contained very extensive dwellings for the young sons of
indulgent fathers and it contained the dwellings of faultless
male servants and handsome, well-trained female servants for
whose training more time was requisite than for the development
of new species of orchids.</p>

<p>Their chief task consisted in nothing but, at all times, to
appear delightful and to be incapriciously cheerful; and, with
their bewildering costume, their painted faces, and their eye-masks,
surmounted by snow-white wigs and fragrant as flowers,
they resembled delicate dolls of porcelain and brocade, devised
by a master-hand, not purchaseable but rather delightful
presents.</p>

<p>Freder was but a rare visitant to the "Club of the Sons." He
preferred his work-shop and the starry chapel in which this
organ stood. But when once the desire took him to fling himself
into the radiant joyousness of the stadium competitions he was
the most radiant and joyous of all, playing on from victory to
victory with the laugh of a young god.</p>

<p>On that day too...on that day too.</p>

<p>Still tingling from the icy coolness of falling water, every
muscle still quivering in the intoxication of victory he had
lain, stretched out, slender, panting, smiling, drunken, beside
himself, almost insane with joy. The milk-coloured glass ceiling
above the Eternal Gardens was an opal in the light which bathed
it. Loving little women attended him, waiting roguishly and
jealously, from whose white hands, from whose fine finger-tips
he would eat the fruits he desired.</p>

<p>One was standing aside, mixing him a drink. From hip to knee
billowed sparkling brocade. Slender, bare legs held proudly
together, she stood, like ivory, in purple, peaked shoes. Her
gleaming body rose, delicately, from her hips and&mdash;she was
not aware of it&mdash;quivered in the same rhythm as did the
man's chest in exhaling his sweet-rising breath. Carefully did
the little painted face under the eye-mask watch the work of her
careful hands.</p>

<p>Her mouth was not rouged, but yet was pomegranate red. And
she smiled so unselfconsciously down at the beverage that it
caused the other girls to laugh aloud.</p>

<p>Infected, Freder also began to laugh. But the glee of the
maidens swelled to a storm as she who was mixing the drink, not
knowing why they were laughing, became suffused with a blush of
confusion, from her pomegranate-hued mouth to her lustrous hips.
The laughter induced the friends, for no reason, only because
they were young and carefree, to join in the cheerful sound.
Like a joyously ringing rainbow, peal upon peal of laughter
arched itself gaily above the young people.</p>

<p>Then suddenly&mdash;suddenly&mdash;Freder turned his head.
His hands, which were resting on the hips of the drink-mixer,
lost hold of her, dropping down by his sides as if dead. The
laughter ceased, not one of the friends moved. Not one of the
little, brocaded, bare&mdash;limbed women moved hand or foot.
They stood and looked.</p>

<p>The door of the Eternal Gardens had opened and through the
door came a procession of children. They were all holding hands.
They had dwarves' faces, grey and ancient. They were little
ghost&mdash;like skeletons, covered with faded rags and smocks.
They had colourless hair and colourless eyes. They walked on
emaciated bare feet. Noiselessly they followed their leader.</p>

<p>Their leader was a girl. The austere countenance of the
Virgin. The sweet countenance of the mother. She held a skinny
child by each hand. Now she stood still, regarding the young men
and women one after another, with the deadly severity of purity.
She was quite maid and mistress, inviolability&mdash;and was,
too, graciousness itself, her beautiful brow in the diadem of
goodness; her voice, pity; every word a song.</p>

<p>She released the children and stretched forward her hand,
motioning towards the friends and saying to the children:</p>

<p>"Look, these are your brothers!"</p>

<p>And, motioning towards the children, she said to the
friends:</p>

<p>"Look, these are your brothers!"</p>

<p>She waited. She stood still and her gaze rested upon
Freder.</p>

<p>Then the servants came, the door-keepers came. Between these
walls of marble and glass, under the opal dome of the Eternal
Gardens, there reigned, for a short time, an unprecedented
confusion of noise, indignation and embarrassment. The girl
appeared still to be waiting. Nobody dared to touch her, though
she stood so defenceless, among the grey infant-phantoms, Her
eyes rested perpetually on Freder.</p>

<p>Then she took her eyes from his and, stooping a little, took
the children's hands again, turned and led the procession out.
The door swung to behind her; the servants disappeared with many
apologies for not having been able to prevent the occurrence.
All was emptiness and silence. Had not each of those before whom
the girl had appeared, with her grey procession of children, so
large a number of witnesses to the event they would have been
inclined to put it down to hallucination.</p>

<p>Near Freder, upon the illuminated mosaic floor, cowered the
little drink-mixer, sobbing uncontrolledly.</p>

<p>With a leisurely movement, Freder bent towards her and
suddenly twitched the mask, the narrow black mask, from her
eyes.</p>

<p>The drink-mixer shrieked out as though overtaken in stark
nudity. Her hands flew up, clutching, and remained hanging
stiffly in the air.</p>

<p>A little painted face stared, horror-stricken at the man. The
eyes, thus exposed, were senseless, quite empty. The little face
from which the charm of the mask had been taken away, was quite
weird.</p>

<p>Freder dropped the black piece of stuff. The drink-mixer
pounced quickly upon it, hiding her face. Freder looked around
him.</p>

<p>The Eternal Gardens scintillated. The beautiful beings in it,
even if, temporarily, thrown out of balance, shone in their
well-cared-for-ness, their cleanly abundance. The odour of
freshness, which pervaded everywhere, was like the breath of a
dewy garden.</p>

<p>Freder looked down at himself. He wore, as all the youths in
the "House of the Sons," the white silk, which they wore but
once&mdash;the soft, supple shoes, with the noiseless soles.</p>

<p>He looked at his friends. He saw these beings who never
wearied, unless from sport&mdash;who never sweated, unless from
sport&mdash;who were never out of breath, unless from sport.
Beings requiring their joyous games in order that their food and
drink might agree with them, in order to be able, to sleep well
and digest easily.</p>

<p>The tables, at which they had all eaten, were laid, as
beforehand, with untouched dishes. Wine, golden and purple,
embedded in ice or warmth, was there, proffering itself, like
the loving little women. Now the music was playing again. It had
been silenced when the girlish voice spoke the five soft
words:</p>

<p>"Look, these are your brothers!"</p>

<p>And once more, with her eyes resting on Freder:</p>

<p>"Look, these are your brothers!"</p>

<p>As one suffocating, Freder sprang up. The masked women stared
at him. He dashed to the door. He ran along passages and down
steps. He came to the entrance.</p>

<p>"Who was that girl?"</p>

<p>Perplexed shrugs. Apologies. The occurrence was inexcusable,
the servants knew it. Dismissals, in plenty, would be
distributed.</p>

<p>The Major Domo was pale with anger.</p>

<p>"I do not wish," said Freder, gazing into space, "that anyone
should suffer for what has happened. Nobody is to be
dismissed...I do not wish it..."</p>

<p>The Major Domo bowed in silence. He was accustomed to whims
in the "Club of the Sons."</p>

<p>"Who is the girl...can nobody tell me?"</p>

<p>"No. Nobody. But if an inquiry is to be made?"</p>

<p>Freder remained silent. He thought of Slim. He shook his
head. First slowly, then violently. "No&mdash;One does not set a
bloodhound on the track of a sacred, white hind."</p>

<p>"Nobody is to inquire about her," he said, tonelessly.</p>

<p>He felt the soulless glance of the strange, hired person upon
his face. He felt himself poor and besmirched. In an ill-temper
which rendered him as wretched as though he had poison in his
veins, he left the club. He walked home as though going into
exile. He shut himself up in his workroom and worked. At nights
he clung to his instrument and forced the monstrous solitude of
Jupiter and Saturn down to him.</p>

<p>Nothing could help him&mdash;nothing! In an agonising
blissful omnipresence stood, before his vision the one, one
countenance; the austere countenance of the virgin, the sweet
countenance of the mother.</p>

<p>A voice spoke:</p>

<p>"Look, these are your brothers."</p>

<p>And the glory of the heavens was nothing, and the
intoxication of work was nothing. And the conflagration which
wiped out the sea could not wipe out the soft voice of the
girl:</p>

<p>"Look, these are your brothers!"</p>

<p>My God, my God&mdash;</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p>With a painful, violent jerk, Freder turned around and walked
up to his machine. Something like deliverance passed across his
face as he considered this shining creation, waiting only for
him, of which there was not a steel link, not a rivet, not a
spring which he had not calculated and created.</p>

<p>The creature was not large, appearing still more fragile by
reason of the huge room and flood of sunlight in which it stood.
But the soft lustre of its metal and the proud swing with which
the foremost body seemed to raise itself to leap, even when not
in motion, gave it something of the fair godliness of a
faultlessly beautiful animal, which is quite fearless, because
it knows itself to be invincible.</p>

<p>Freder caressed his creation. He pressed his head gently
against the machine. With ineffable affection he felt its cool,
flexible members.</p>

<p>"To-night," he said, "I shall be with you. I shall be
entirely enwrapped by you. I shall pour out my life into you and
shall fathom whether or not I can bring you to life. I shall,
perhaps, feel your throb and the commencement of movement in
your controlled body. I shall, perhaps, feel the giddiness with
which you throw yourself out into your boundless element,
carrying me&mdash;me, the man who made&mdash;through the huge
sea of midnight. The seven stars will be above us and the sad
beauty of the moon. Mount Everest will remain, a hill, below us.
You shall carry me and I shall know: You carry me as high as I
wish..."</p>

<p>He stopped, closing his eyes. The shudder which ran through
him was imparted, a thrill, to the silent machine.</p>

<p>"But perhaps," he continued, without raising his voice,
"perhaps you notice, you, my beloved creation, that you are no
longer my only love. Nothing on earth is more vengeful than the
jealousy of a machine which believes itself to be neglected.
Yes, I know that...You are imperious mistresses...Thou shalt
have none other Gods but me. Am I right? A thought apart from
you&mdash;you feel it at once and become perverse. How could I
keep it hidden from you that all my thoughts are not with you. I
can't help it, my creation. I was bewitched, machine. I press my
forehead upon you and my forehead longs for the knees of the
girl of whom I do not even know the name..."</p>

<p>He ceased and held his breath. He raised his head and
listened.</p>

<p>Hundreds and thousands of times had he heard that same sound
in the city. But hundreds and thousands of time, it seemed to
him, he had not comprehended it.</p>

<p>It was an immeasurably glorious and transporting sound. As
deep and rumbling as, and more powerful than, any sound on
earth. The voice of the ocean when it is angry, the voice of
falling torrents, the voice of very close thunderstorms would be
miserably drowned in this Behemoth-din. Without being shrill it
penetrated all walls, and, as long as it lasted, all things
seemed to swing in it. It was omnipresent, coming from the
heights and from the depths, being beautiful and horrible, being
an irresistible command.</p>

<p>It was high above the town. It was the voice of the town.</p>

<p>Metropolis raised her voice. The machines of Metropolis
roared; they wanted to be fed.</p>

<p>Freder pushed open the glass doors. He felt them tremble like
strings under strokes of the bow. He stepped out on to the
narrow gallery which ran around this, almost the highest house
of Metropolis. The roaring sound received him, enveloped him,
never coming to an end.</p>

<p>Great as Metropolis was: at all four corners of the city,
this roared command was equally perceptible:</p>

<p>Freder looked across the city at the building known to the
world as the "New Tower of Babel."</p>

<p>In the brain-pan of this New Tower of Babel lived the man who
was himself the Brain of Metropolis.</p>

<p>As long as the man over there, who was nothing but work,
despising sleep, eating and drinking mechanically, pressed his
fingers on the blue metal plate, which apart from himself, no
man had ever touched, so long would the voice of the machine-city
of Metropolis roar for food, for food, for food...</p>

<p>She wanted living men for food.</p>

<p>Then the living food came pushing along in masses. Along the
street it came, along its own street which never crossed with
other people's streets. It rolled on, a broad, an endless
stream. The stream was twelve files deep. They walked in even
step. Men, men, men&mdash;all in the same uniform, from throat
to ankle in dark blue linen, bare feet in the same hard shoes,
hair tightly pressed down by the same black caps.</p>

<p>And they all had the same faces. And they all appeared to be
of the same age. They held themselves straightened up, but not
straight. They did not raise their heads, they pushed them
forward. They planted their feet forward, but they did not walk.
The open gates of the New Tower of Babel, the machine center of
Metropolis, gulped the masses down.</p>

<p>Towards them, but past them, another procession dragged
itself along, the shift just used. It rolled on, a broad, an
endless stream. The stream was twelve files deep. They walked in
even step. Men, men, men&mdash;all in the same uniform, from
throat to ankle in dark blue linen, bare feet in the same hard
shoes, hair tightly pressed down by the same black caps. And
they all had the same faces. And they all seemed one thousand
years old. They walked with hanging fists, they walked with
hanging heads. No, they planted their feet forward but they did
not walk. The open gates of the New Tower of Babel, the machine
centre of Metropolis, threw the masses up as it gulped them
down.</p>

<p>When the fresh living food had disappeared through the gates
the roaring voice was silent at last. And the never ceasing,
throbbing hum of the great Metropolis became perceptible again,
producing the effect of silence, a deep relief. The man who was
the great brain in the brain-pan of Metropolis had ceased to
press his fingers on the blue metal plate.</p>

<p>In ten hours he would let the machine brute roar anew. And in
another ten hours, again. And always the same, and always the
same, without ever loosening the ten-hour clamp.</p>

<p>Metropolis did not know what Sunday was. Metropolis knew
neither high days nor holidays. Metropolis had the most saintly
cathedral in the world, richly adorned with Gothic decoration.
In times of which only the chronicles could tell, the star-crowned
Virgin on its tower used to smile, as a mother, from out
her golden mantle, deep, deep down upon the pious red rooves and
the only companions of her graciousness were the doves which
used to nest in the gargoyles of the water-spouts and the bells
which were called after the four archangels and of which Saint
Michael was the most magnificent.</p>

<p>It was said that the Master who cast it turned villain for
its sake, for he stole consecrated and unconsecrated silver,
like a raven, casting it into the metal body of the bell. As a
reward for his deed he suffered, on the place of execution, the
dreadful death on the wheel. But, it was said, he died
exceedingly happy, for the Archangel Michael rang him on his way
to death so wonderfully, touchingly, that all agreed the saints
must have forgiven the sinner already, to ring the heavenly
bells, thus, to receive him.</p>

<p>The bells still rang with their old, ore voices but when
Metropolis roared, then Saint Michael itself was hoarse. The New
Tower of Babel and its fellow houses stretched their sombre
heights high above the cathedral spire, that the young girls in
the work-rooms and wireless stations gazed down just as deep
from the thirtieth story windows on the star-crowned virgin as
she, in earlier days, had looked down on the pious red rooves.
In place of doves, flying machines swarmed over the cathedral
roof and over the city, resting on the rooves, from which, at
night glaring pillars and circles indicated the course of flight
and landing points.</p>

<p>The Master of Metropolis had already considered, more than
once, having the cathedral pulled down, as being pointless and
an obstruction to the traffic in the town of fifty million
inhabitants.</p>

<p>But the small, eager sect of Gothics, whose leader was
Desertus, half monk, half one enraptured, had sworn the solemn
oath: If one hand from the wicked city of Metropolis were to
dare to touch just one stone of the cathedral, then they would
neither repose nor rest until the wicked city of Metropolis
should lie, a heap of ruins, at the foot of her cathedral.</p>

<p>The Master of Metropolis used to avenge the threats which
constituted one sixth of his daily mail. But he did not care to
fight with opponents to whom he rendered a service by destroying
them for their belief. The great brain of Metropolis, a stranger
to the sacrifice of a desire, estimated the incalculable power
which the sacrificed ones and martyrs showered upon their
followers too high rather than too low. Too, the demolition of
the cathedral was not yet so burning a question as to have been
the object of an estimate of expenses. But when the moment
should come, the cost of its pulling down would exceed that of
the construction of Metropolis. The Gothics were ascetics; the
Master of Metropolis knew by experience that a multi-millionaire
was more cheaply bought over than an ascetic.</p>

<p>Freder wondered, not without a foreign feeling of bitterness,
how many more times the great Master of Metropolis would permit
him to look on at the scene which the cathedral would present to
him on every rainless day: When the sun sank at the back of
Metropolis, the houses turning to mountains and the streets to
valleys; when the stream of light, which seemed to crackle with
coldness, broke forth from all windows, from the walls of the
houses, from the rooves and from the heart of the town; when the
silent quiver of electric advertisments began; when the
searchlights, in all colours of the rainbow, began to play
around the New Tower of Babel; when the omnibuses turned to
chains of light-spitting monsters, the little motor cars to
scurrying, luminous fishes in a waterless deep-sea, while from
the invisible harbour of the underground railway, an ever equal,
magical shimmer pressed on to be swallowed by the hurrying
shadows&mdash;then the cathedral would stand there, in this
boundless ocean of light, which dissolved all forms by
outshining them, the only dark object, black and persistant,
seeming, in its lightlessness, to free itself from the earth, to
rise higher and ever higher, and appearing in this maelstrom of
tumultous light, the only reposeful and masterful object.</p>

<p>But the Virgin on the top of the tower seemed to have her own
gentle starlight, and hovered, set free from the blackness of
the stone, on the sickle of the silver moon, above the
cathedral.</p>

<p>Freder had never seen the countenance of the Virgin and yet
he knew it so well he could have drawn it: the austere
countenance of the Virgin, the sweet countenance of the
mother.</p>

<p>He stooped, clasping the burning palms of his hands around
the iron railing.</p>

<p>"Look at me, Virgin," he begged, "Mother, look at me!" The
spear of a searchlight flew into his eyes causing him to close
them angrily. A whistling rocket hissed through the air,
dropping down into the pale twilight of the afternoon, the word:
Yoshiwara...</p>

<p>Remarkably white, and with penetrating beams, there hovered,
towering up, over a house which was not to be seen, the word:
Cinema.</p>

<p>All the seven colours of the rainbow flared, cold and
ghostlike in silently swinging circles. The enormous face of the
clock on the New Tower of Babel was bathed in the glaring cross-fire
of the searchlights. And over and over again from the pale,
unreal&mdash;looking sky, dripped the word: Yoshiwara. Freder's
eyes hung on the clock of the New Tower of Babel, where the
seconds flashed off as sparks of breathing lightning, continuous
in their coming as in their going. He calculated the time which
had passed since the voice of Metropolis had roared for food,
for food, for food. He knew that behind the throbbing second
flashes on the New Tower of Babel there was a Wide, bare room
with narrow windows, the height of the walls, switchboards on
all sides, right in the centre, the table, the most ingenious
instrument which the Master of Metropolis had created, on which
to play, alone, as solitary master.</p>

<p>On the plain chair before it, the embodiment of the great
brain: the Master of Metropolis. Near his right hand the
sensitive blue metal plate, to which he would stretch out his
right hand, with the infallible certainty of a healthy machine,
when seconds enough had flicked off into eternity, to let
Metropolis roar once more&mdash;for food, for food, for
food&mdash;</p>

<p>In this moment Freder was seized with the persistent idea
that he would lose his reason if he had, once more, to hear the
voice of Metropolis thus roaring to be fed. And, already
convinced of the pointlessness of his quest, he turned from the
spectacle of the light crazy city and went to seek the Master of
Metropolis, whose name was Joh Fredersen and who was his
father.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="first">THE brain-pan of the New Tower of Babel was
peopled with numbers.</p>

<p>From an invisible source the numbers dropped rhythmically
down through the cooled air of the room, being collected, as in
a water-basin, at the table at which the great brain of
Metropolis worked, becoming objective under the pencils of his
secretaries. These eight young men resembled each other as
brothers, which they were not. Although sitting as immovable as
statues, of which only the writing fingers of the right hand
stirred, yet each single one, with sweat-bedewed brow and parted
lips, seemed the personification of Breathlessness.</p>

<p>No head was raised on Freder's entering, Not even his
father's.</p>

<p>The lamp under the third loudspeaker glowed white-red.</p>

<p>New York spoke.</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen was comparing the figures of the evening
exchange report with the lists which lay before him. Once his
voice sounded, vibrationless:</p>

<p>"Mistake. Further inquiry."</p>

<p>The first secretary quivered, stooped lower, rose and retired
on soundless soles. Joh Fredersen's left eyebrow rose a trifle
as he watched the retreating figure&mdash;only as long as was
possible without turning his head.</p>

<p>A thin, concise pencil-line crossed out a name.</p>

<p>The white-red light glowed. The voice spoke. The numbers
dropped down through the great room. In the brain-pan of
Metropolis.</p>

<p>Freder remained standing, motionless, by the door. He was not
sure as to whether or not his father had noticed him. Whenever
he entered this room he was once more a boy of ten years old,
his chief characteristic uncertainty, before the great
concentrated, almighty certainty, which was called Joh
Fredersen, and was his father.</p>

<p>The first secretary walked past him, greeting him silently,
respectfully. He resembled a competitor leaving the course,
beaten. The chalky face of the young man hovered for one moment
before Freder's eyes like a big, white, lacquer mask. Then it
was blotted out.</p>

<p>Numbers dropped down through the room.</p>

<p>One chair was empty. On seven others sat seven men, pursuing
the numbers which sprang unceasingly from the invisible.</p>

<p>A lamp glowed white-red.</p>

<p>New York spoke.</p>

<p>A lamp sparkled up: white-green.</p>

<p>London began to speak.</p>

<p>Freder looked up at the clock opposite the door, commanding
the whole wall like a gigantic wheel. It was the same clock,
which, from the heights of the New Tower of Babel, flooded by
searchlights, flicked off its second-sparks over the great
Metropolis.</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen's head stood out against it. It was a crushing
yet accepted halo above the brain of Metropolis.</p>

<p>The searchlights raved in a delirium of colour upon the
narrow windows which ran from floor to ceiling. Cascades of
light frothed against the panes. Outside, deep down, at the foot
of the New Tower of Babel boiled the Metropolis. But in this
room not a sound was to be heard but the incessantly dripping
numbers.</p>

<p>The Rotwang process had rendered the walls and windows
sound-proof.</p>

<p>In this room, which was at the same time crowned and
subjugated by the mighty time-piece, the clock, indicating
numbers, nothing had any significance but numbers. The son of
the great Master of Metropolis realised that, as long as numbers
came dripping out of the invisible no word, which was not a
number, and coming from a visible mouth, could lay claim to the
least attention.</p>

<p>Therefore he stood, gazing unceasingly at his father's head,
watching the monstrous hand of the clock sweep onward,
inevitably, like a sickle, a reaping scythe pass through the
skull of his father, without harming him, climb upwards, up the
number-beset ring, creep around the heights and sink again, to
repeat the vain blow of the scythe At last the white-red light
went out. A voice ceased.</p>

<p>Then the white-green light went out, too.</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>The hands of those writing stopped and, for the space of a
moment, they sat as though paralysed, relaxed, exhausted. Then
Joh Fredersen's voice said with a dry gentleness:</p>

<p>"Thank you, to-morrow."</p>

<p>And without looking round:</p>

<p>"What do you want, my boy?"</p>

<p>The seven strangers quitted the now silent room. Freder
crossed to his father, whose glance was sweeping the lists of
captured number-drops. Freder's eyes clung to the blue metal
plate near his father's right hand.</p>

<p>"How did you know it was I?" he asked, softly.</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen did not look up at him. Although his face had
gained an expression of patience and pride at the first question
which his son put to him he had lost none of his alertness. He
glanced at the clock. His fingers glided over the flexible
keyboard. Soundlessly were orders flashed out to waiting
men.</p>

<p>"The door opened. Nobody was announced. Nobody comes to me
unannounced. Only my son."</p>

<p>A light below glass&mdash;a question. Joh Fredersen
extinguished the light. The first secretary entered and crossed
over to the great Master of Metropolis.</p>

<p>"You were right. It was a mistake. It has been rectified," he
reported, expressionlessly.</p>

<p>"Thank you." Not a look. Not a gesture. "The G&mdash;bank has
been notified to pay you your salary. Good evening."</p>

<p>The young man stood motionless. Three, four, five, six
seconds flicked off the gigantic time-piece. Two empty eyes
burnt in the chalky face of the young man, impressing their
brand of fear upon Freder's vision.</p>

<p>One of Joh Fredersen's shoulders made a leisurely
movement.</p>

<p>"Good evening," said the young man, in a strangled tone.</p>

<p>He went.</p>

<p>"Why did you dismiss him, father?" the son asked.</p>

<p>"I have no use for him," said Joh Fredersen, still not having
looked at his son.</p>

<p>"Why not, father?"</p>

<p>"I have no use for people who start when one speaks to them,"
said the Master over Metropolis.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he felt ill...perhaps he is worrying about somebody
who is dear to him."</p>

<p>"Possibly. Perhaps too, he was still under the effects of the
too long night in Yoshiwara. Freder, avoid assuming people to be
good, innocent and victimized just because they suffer. He who
suffers has sinned, against himself and against others."</p>

<p>"You do not suffer, father?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You are quite free from sin?"</p>

<p>"The time of sin and suffering lies behind me, Freder."</p>

<p>"And if this man, now...I have never seen such a thing...but
I believe that men resolved to end their lives go out of a room
as he did..."</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>"And suppose you were to hear, to-morrow, that he were
dead...that would leave you untouched...?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Freder was silent.</p>

<p>His father's hand slipped over a lever, and pressed it down.
The white lamps in all the rooms surrounding the brain-pan of
the New Tower of Babel went out. The Master over Metropolis had
informed the circular world around him that he did not wish to
be disturbed without urgent cause.</p>

<p>"I cannot tolerate it," he continued, "when a man, working
upon Metropolis, at my right hand, in common with me, denies the
only great advantage he possesses above the machine."</p>

<p>"And what is that, father?"</p>

<p>"To take delight in work," said the Master over Metropolis.
Freder's hand glided over his hair, then rested on its glorious
fairness. He opened his lips, as though he wanted to say
something; but he remained silent.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose," Joh Fredersen went on, "that I need my
secretaries' pencils to check American stock-exchange reports?
The index tables of Rotwang's trans-ocean trumpets are a hundred
times more reliable and swift than clerk's brains and hands.
But, by the accuracy of the machine I can measure the accuracy
of the men, by the breath of the machine, the lungs of the men
who compete with her."</p>

<p>"And the man you just dismissed, and who is doomed (for to be
dismissed by you, father, means going down!...Down!...Down!...)
he lost his breath, didn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Because he was a man and not a machine..."</p>

<p>"Because he denied his humanity before the machine." Freder
raised his head and his deeply troubled eyes. "I cannot follow
you now, father," he said, as if in pain. The expression of
patience on Joh Fredersen's face deepened.</p>

<p>"The man," he said quietly, "was my first secretary! The
salary he drew was eight times as large as that of the
last."</p>

<p>"That was synonymous with the obligation to perform eight
times as much. To me. Not to himself. To-morrow the fifth
secretary will be in his place. In a week he will have rendered
four of the others superfluous. I have use for that man."</p>

<p>"Because he saves four others."</p>

<p>"No, Freder. Because he takes delight in the work of four
others. Because he throws himself entirely into his
work&mdash;throws himself as desiringly as if it were a
woman."</p>

<p>Freder was silent. Joh Fredersen looked at his son. He looked
at him carefully.</p>

<p>"You have had some experience?" he asked.</p>

<p>The eyes of the boy, beautiful and sad, slipped past him, out
into space. Wild, white light frothed against the windows, and,
in going out, left the sky behind, as a black velvet cloth over
Metropolis.</p>

<p>"I have had no experience," said Freder, tentatively, "except
that I believe for the first time in my life to have
comprehended the being of a machine..."</p>

<p>"That should mean a great deal," replied the Master over
Metropolis. "But you are probably wrong, Freder. If you had
really comprehended the being of a machine you would not be so
perturbed."</p>

<p>Slowly the son turned his eyes and the helplessness of his
incomprehension to his father.</p>

<p>"How can one but be perturbed," he said, "if one comes to
you, as I did, through the machine-rooms. Through the glorious
rooms of your glorious machines...and sees the creatures who are
fettered to them by laws of eternal watchfulness...lidless
eyes..."</p>

<p>He paused. His lips were dry as dust.</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen leant back. He had not taken his gaze from his
son, and still held it fast.</p>

<p>"Why did you come to me through the machine-rooms," he asked
quietly. "It is neither the best, nor the most convenient
way."</p>

<p>"I wished," said the son, picking his words carefully, "Just
once to look the men in the face&mdash;whose little children are
my brothers&mdash;my sisters..."</p>

<p>"H'm," said the other with very tight lips. The pencil which
he held between his fingers tapped gently, dryly, once, twice,
upon the table's edge. Joh Fredersen's eyes wandered from his
son to the twitching flash of the seconds on the clock, then
sinking back again to him.</p>

<p>"And what did you find?" he asked.</p>

<p>Seconds, seconds, seconds of silence. Then it was as though
the son, uprooting and tearing loose his whole ego, threw
himself, with a gesture of utter self-exposure, upon his father,
yet he stood still, head a little bent, speaking softly, as
though every word were smothering between his lips.</p>

<p>"Father! Help the men who live at your machines!"</p>

<p>"I cannot help them," said the brain of Metropolis. "Nobody
can help them. They are where they must be. They are what they
must be. They are not fitted for anything more or anything
different."</p>

<p>"I do not know for what they are fitted," said Freder,
expressionlessly: his head fell upon his breast as though almost
severed from his neck. "I only know what I saw&mdash;and that it
was dreadful to look upon...I went through the machine-rooms&mdash;
they were like temples. All the great gods were
living in white temples. I saw Baal and Moloch, Huitziopochtli
and Durgha; some frightfully companionable, some terribly
solitary. I saw Juggernaut's divine car and the Towers of
Silence, Mahomet's curved sword, and the crosses of Golgotha.
And all machines, machines, machines, which, confined to their
pedestals, like deities to their temple thrones, from the
resting places which bore them, lived their god&mdash;Like
lives: Eyeless but seeing all, earless but hearing all, without
speech, yet, in themselves, a proclaiming mouth&mdash;not man,
not woman, and yet engendering, receptive, and
productive&mdash;lifeless, yet shaking the air of their temples
with the never-expiring breath of their vitality. And, near the
god-machines, the slaves of the god-machines: the men who were
as though crushed between machine companionability and ma chine
solitude. They have no loads to carry: the machine carries the
loads. They have not to lift and push: the machine lifts and
pushes. They have nothing else to do but eternally one and the
same thing, each in this place, each at his machine. Divided
into periods of brief seconds, always the same clutch at the
same second, at the same second. They have eyes, but they are
blind but for one thing, the scale of the manometer. They have
ears, but they are deaf but for one thing, the hiss of their
machine. They watch and watch, having no thought but for one
thing: should their watchfulness waver, then the machine awakens
from its feigned sleep and begins to race, racing itself to
pieces. And the machine, having neither head nor brain, with the
tension of its watchfulness, sucks and sucks out the brain from
the paralysed skull of its watchman, and does not stay, and
sucks, and does not stay until a being is hanging to the sucked-out
skull, no longer a man and not yet a machine, pumped dry,
hollowed out, used up. And the machine which has sucked out and
gulped down the spinal marrow and brain of the man and has wiped
out the hollows in his skull with the soft, long tongue of its
soft, long hissing, the maching gleams in its silver-velvet
radiance, anointed with oil, beautiful, infallible&mdash;Baal
and Moloch, Huitzilopochtli and Durgha. And you, father, you
press your fingers upon the little blue metal plate near your
right hand, and your great glorious, dreadful city of Metropolis
roars out, proclaiming that she is hungry for fresh human marrow
and human brain and then the living food rolls on, like a
stream, into the machine-rooms, which are like temples, and
that, just used, is thrown up..."</p>

<p>His voice failed him. He struck his fists violently together,
and looked at his father.</p>

<p>"And they are all human beings!"</p>

<p>"Unfortunately. Yes."</p>

<p>The father's voice sounded to the son's ear as though he were
speaking from behind seven closed doors.</p>

<p>"That men are used up so rapidly at the machines, Freder, is
no proof of the greed of the machine, but of the deficiency of
the human material. Man is the product of change, Freder. A
once-and-for-all being. If he is miscast he cannot be sent back
to the melting-furnace. One is obliged to use him as he is.
Whereby it has been statistically proved that the powers of
performance of the non-intellectual worker lessen from month to
month."</p>

<p>Freder laughed. The laugh came so dry, so parched, from his
lips that Joh Fredersen jerked up his head, looking: at his son
from out narrowed eyelids. Slowly his eyebrows! rose.</p>

<p>"Are you not afraid, father (supposing that the statistics
are correct and the consumption of man is progressing
increasingly, rapidly) that one fine day there will be no more
food there for the man-eating god-machines, and that the Moloch
of glass, rubber and steel, the Durgha of aluminium with
platinum veins, will have to starve miserably?"</p>

<p>"The case is conceivable," said the brain of Metropolis.</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Then," said the brain of Metropolis, "by then a substitute
for man will have to have been found."</p>

<p>"The improved man, you mean&mdash;? The machine-man&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said the brain of Metropolis.</p>

<p>Freder brushed the damp hair from his brow. He bent forward,
his breath touching his father.</p>

<p>"Then just listen to one thing, father," he breathed, the
veins on his temples standing out, blue, "see to it that the
machine-man has no head, or, at any rate, no face, or give him a
face which always smiles. Or a Harlequin's face, or a closed
visor. That it does not horrify one to look at him! For, as I
walked through the machine-rooms to-day, I saw the men who watch
your machines. And they know me, and I greeted them, one after
the other. But not one returned my greeting. The machines were
all too eagerly tautening their nerve-strings. And when I looked
at them, father, quite closely, as closely as I am now looking
at you&mdash;! was looking myself in the face...Every single
man, father, who slaves at your machines, has my face&mdash;has
the face of your son..."</p>

<p>"Then mine too, Freder, for we are very like each other,"
said the Master over the great Metropolis. He looked at the
clock and stretched out his hand. In all the rooms surrounding
the brain-pan of the New Tower of Babel the white lamps flared
up.</p>

<p>"And doesn't it fill you with horror," asked the son, "to
know so many shadows, so many phantoms, to be working at your
work?"</p>

<p>"The time of horror lies behind me, Freder."</p>

<p>Then Freder turned and went, like a blind man&mdash;first
missing the door with groping hand, then finding it. It opened
before him. It closed behind him, and he stood still, in a room
that seemed to him to be strange and icy.</p>

<p>Forms rose up from the chairs upon which they had sat,
waiting, bowing low to the son of Joh Fredersen, the Master of
Metropolis.</p>

<p>Freder only recognized one; that was Slim.</p>

<p>He thanked those who greeted him, still standing near the
door, seeming not to know his way. Behind him slipped Slim,
going to Joh Fredersen, who had sent for him.</p>

<p>The master of Metropolis was standing by the window, his back
to the door.</p>

<p>"Wait!" said the dark square back.</p>

<p>Slim did not stir. He breathed inaudibly. His eyelids
lowered, he seemed to sleep while standing. But his mouth, with
the remarkable tension of its muscles, made him the
personification of concentration.</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen's eyes wandered over Metropolis, a restless
roaring sea with a surf of light. In the flashes and waves, the
Niagara falls of light, in the colour-play of revolving towers
of light and brilliance, Metropolis seemed to have become
transparent. The houses, dissected into cones and cubes by the
moving scythes of the searchlights gleamed, towering up,
hoveringly, light flowing down their flanks like rain. The
streets licked up the shining radiance, themselves shining, and
the things gliding upon them, an incessant stream, threw cones
of light before them. Only the cathedral, with the star-crowned
Virgin on the top of its tower, lay stretched out, massively,
down in the city, like a black giant lying in an enchanted
sleep.</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen turned around slowly. He saw Slim standing by
the door. Slim greeted him. Joh Fredersen came towards him. He
crossed the whole width of the room in silence; he walked slowly
on until he came up to the man. Standing there before him, he
looked at him, as though peeling everything corporal from him,
even to his innermost self.</p>

<p>Slim held his ground during this peeling scrutiny.</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen said, speaking rather softly:</p>

<p>"From now on I wish to be informed of my son's every
action."</p>

<p>Slim bowed, waited, saluted and went. But he did not find the
son of his great master again where he had left him. Nor was he
destined to find him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="first">THE man who had been Joh Fredersen's first
secretary stood in a cell of the Pater-noster, the never-stopping
passenger lift which, like a series of never-ceasing well-buckets,
transsected the New Tower of Babel.&mdash;With his
back against the wooden wall, he was making the journey through
the white, humming house, from the heights of the roof, to the
depths of the cellars and up again to the heights of the roof,
for the thirtieth time, never moving from the one spot.</p>

<p>Persons, greedy to gain a few seconds, stumbled in with him,
and stories higher, or lower, out again. Nobody paid the least
attention to him. One or two certainly recognised him. But, as
yet, nobody interpreted the drops on his temples as being
anything but a similar greed for the gain of a few seconds. All
right&mdash;he would wait until they knew better, until they
took him and threw him out of the cell: What are you taking up
space for, you fool, if you've got so much time? Crawl down the
stairs, or the first escape...</p>

<p>With gasping mouth he leant there and waited...</p>

<p>Now emerging from the depths again, he looked with stupified
eyes towards the room which guarded Joh Fredersen's door, and
saw Joh Fredersen's son standing before that door. For the
fraction of a second they stared into each other's overshadowed
faces, and the glances of both broke out as signals of distress,
of very different but of equally deep distress. Then the totally
indifferent pumpworks carried the man in the cell upwards into
the darkness of the roof of the tower, and, when he dipped down
again, becoming visible once more on his way downwards, the son
of Joh Fredersen was standing before the opening of the cell and
was, in a step, standing beside the man whose back seemed to be
nailed to the wooden wall.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" he asked gently.</p>

<p>A hesitation in drawing breath, then the answer, which
sounded as though he were listening for something:
"Josaphat..."</p>

<p>"What will you do now, Josaphat?"</p>

<p>They sank. They sank. As they passed through the great hall
the enormous windows of which overlooked the street of bridges,
broadly and ostentatiously, Freder saw, on turning his head,
outlined against the blackness of the sky, already half
extinguished, the dripping word: Yoshiwara...</p>

<p>He spoke as if stretching out both hands, as just if closing
his eyes in speaking:</p>

<p>"Will you come to me, Josaphat?"</p>

<p>A hand fluttered up like a scared bird.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;?" gasped the stranger.</p>

<p>"Yes, Josaphat."</p>

<p>The young voice so full of kindness...</p>

<p>They sank. They sank.
Light&mdash;darkness&mdash;light&mdash;darkness again.</p>

<p>"Will you come to me, Josaphat?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" said the strange man with incomparable fervour.
"Yes!"</p>

<p>They dropped into light. Freder seized him by the arm and
dragged him out with him, out of the great pump-works of the New
Tower of Babel, holding him fast as he reeled.</p>

<p>"Where do you live, Josaphat?"</p>

<p>"Ninetieth Block. House seven. Seventh floor."</p>

<p>"Then go home, Josaphat. Perhaps I shall come to you myself;
perhaps I shall send a messenger who will bring you to me. I do
not know what the next few hours will bring forth...But I do not
want any man I know, if I can prevent it, to lie a whole night
long, staring up at the ceiling until it seems to come crashing
down on him..."</p>

<p>"What can I do for you?" asked the man.</p>

<p>Freder felt the vice&mdash;Like pressure of his hand. He
smiled. He shook his head. "Nothing. Go home. Wait. Be calm.
Tomorrow will bring another day and I hope a fair one..."</p>

<p>The man loosened the grip of his hand and went. Freder
watched him go. The man stopped and looked back at Freder, and
dropped his head with an expression which was so earnest, so
unconditional, that the smile died on Freder's lips&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, man," he said. "I take you at your word!"</p>

<p>The Pater-noster hummed at Freder's back. The cells, like
scoop-buckets, gathered men up and poured them out again. But
the son of Joh Fredersen did not see them. Among all those
tearing along to gain a few seconds, he alone stood still
listening how the New Tower of Babel roared in its revolutions.
The roaring seemed to him like the ringing of one of the
cathedral bells&mdash;like the ore voice of the archangel
Michael. But a song hovered above it, high and sweet. His whole
young heart exulted in this song.</p>

<p>"Have I done your will for the first time, you great
mediatress of pity?" he asked in the roar of the bell's voice.</p>

<p>But no answer came.</p>

<p>Then he went the way he wanted to go, to find the answer.</p>

<p>As Slim entered Freder's home to question the servants
concerning their master, Joh Fredersen's son was walking down
the steps which led to the lower structure of the New Tower of
Babel. As the servants shook their heads at Slim saying that
their master had not come home, Joh Fredersen's son was walking
towards the luminous pillars which indicated his way. As Slim,
with a glance at his watch, decided to wait, to wait, at any
rate for a while&mdash;already alarmed, already conjecturing
possibilities and how to meet them&mdash;Joh Fredersen's son was
entering the room from which the New Tower of Babel drew the
energies for its own requirements.</p>

<p>He had hesitated a long time before opening the door. For a
weird existence went on behind that door. There was howling.
There was panting. There was whistling. The whole building
groaned. An incessant trembling ran through the walls and the
floor. And amidst it all there was not one human sound. Only the
things and the empty air roared. Men in the room on the other
side of this door had powerless sealed lips. But for these men's
sakes Freder had come.</p>

<p>He pushed the door open and then fell back, suffocated.
Boiling air smote him, groping at his eyes that he saw nothing.
Gradually he regained his sight.</p>

<p>The room was dimly lighted and the ceiling, which looked as
though it could carry the weight of the entire earth, seemed
perpetually to be falling down.</p>

<p>A faint howling made breathing almost unbearable. It was as
though the breath drank in the howling too.</p>

<p>Air, rammed down to the depths, coming already used from the
lungs of the great Metropolis, gushed out of the mouths of
pipes. Hurled across the room, it was greedily sucked back by
the mouths of pipes on the other side. And its howling light
spread a coldness about it which fell into fierce conflict with
the sweat-heat of the room.</p>

<p>In the middle of the room crouched the Pater-noster machine.
It was like Ganesha, the god with the elephant's head. It shone
with oil. It had gleaming limbs. Under the crouching body and
the head which was sunken on the chest, crooked legs rested,
gnome&mdash;Like, upon the platform. The trunk and legs were
motionless. But the short arms pushed and pushed alternately
forwards, backwards, forwards. A little pointed light sparkled
upon the play of the delicate joints. The floor, which was
stone, and seamless, trembled under the pushing of the little
machine, which was smaller than a five-year-old chief.</p>

<p>Heat spat from the walls in which the furnaces were roaring.
The odour of oil, which whistled with heat, hung in thick layers
in the room. Even the wild chase of the wandering masses of air
did not tear out the suffocating fumes of oil. Even the water
which was sprayed through the room fought a hopeless battle
against the fury of the heat-spitting walls, evaporating,
already saturated with oil-fumes, before it could protect the
skins of the men in this hell from being roasted.</p>

<p>Men glided by like swimming shadows. Their movements, the
soundlessness of their inaudible slipping past, had something of
the black ghostliness of deep-sea divers. Their eyes stood open
as though they never closed them.</p>

<p>Near the little machine in the centre of the room stood a
man, wearing the uniform of all the workmen of Metropolis: from
throat to ankle, the dark blue linen, bare feet in the hard
shoes, hair tightly pressed down by the black cap. The hunted
stream of wandering air washed around his form, making the folds
of the canvas flutter. The man held his hand on the lever and
his gaze was fixed on the clock, the hands of which vibrated
like magnetic needles.</p>

<p>Freder groped his way across to the man. He stared at him. He
could not see his face. How old was the man? A thousand years?
Or not yet twenty? He was talking to himself with babbling lips.
What was the man muttering about? And had this man, too, the
face of Joh Fredersen's son?</p>

<p>"Look at me!" said Freder bending forward.</p>

<p>But the man's gaze did not leave the clock. His hand, also,
was unceasingly, feverishly, clutching the lever. His lips
babbled and babbled, excitedly.</p>

<p>Freder listened. He caught the words. Shreds of words,
tattered by the current of air.</p>

<p>"Pater-noster...that means, Our Father!...Our Father, which
are in heaven! We are in hell. Our Father!...What is thy name?
Art thou called Pater-noster, Our Father? Or Joh Fredersen? Or
machine?...Be hallowed by us, machine. Pater-noster!...Thy
kingdom come...Thy kingdom come, machine...Thy will be done on
earth as it is in heaven...What is thy will of us, machine,
Pater-noster? Art thou the same in heaven as thou art on
earth?...Our Father, which art in heaven, when thou callest us
into heaven, shall we keep the machines in thy world&mdash;the
great wheels which break the limbs of thy creatures&mdash;the
great merry-go-round called the earth?...Thy will be done,
Pater-noster!...Give us this day our daily bread...Grind,
machine, grind flour for our bread. The bread is baked from the
flour of our bones...And forgive us our trespasses...what
trespasses, Pater-noster? The trespass of haying a brain and a
heart, that thou hast not, machine?. And lead us not into
temptation...Lead us not into temptation to rise against thee,
machine, for thou art stronger than we, thou art a thousand
times stronger than we, and thou art always in the right and we
are always in the wrong, because we are weaker than thou art,
machine...But deliver us from evil, machine...Deliver us from
thee, machine...For thine is the kingdom, the power and the
glory, for ever and ever, Amen...Pater-noster, that means: Our
Father...Our Father, which are in heaven..."</p>

<p>Freder touched the man's arm. The man started, struck
dumb.</p>

<p>His hand lost its hold of the lever and leaped into the air
like a shot bird. The man's jaws stood gaping open as if locked.
For one second the white of the eyes in the stiffened face was
terribly visible. Then the man collapsed like a rag and Freder
caught him as he fell.</p>

<p>Freder held him fast. He looked around. Nobody was paying any
attention, either to him or to the other man. Clouds of steam
and fumes surrounded them like a fog. There was a door near by.
Freder carried the man to the door and pushed it open. It led to
the tool-house. A packing case offered a hard resting place.
Freder let the man slip down into it.</p>

<p>Dull eyes looked up at him. The face to which they belonged
was little more than that of a boy.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" said Freder.</p>

<p>"11811..."</p>

<p>"I want to know what your mother called you...."</p>

<p>"Georgi."</p>

<p>"Georgi, do you know me?"</p>

<p>Consciousness returned to the dull eyes together with
recognition.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know you...You are the son of Joh Fredersen...of Joh
Fredersen, who is the father of us all..."</p>

<p>"Yes. Therefore I am your brother, Georgi, do you see? I
heard your Pater-noster..."&mdash;The body flung itself up with
a heave.</p>

<p>"The machine&mdash;" He sprang to his feet. "My
machine&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Leave it alone, Georgi, and listen to me..."</p>

<p>"Somebody must be at the machine!"</p>

<p>"Somebody will be at the machine; but not you..."</p>

<p>"Who will, then?"</p>

<p>"I."</p>

<p>Staring eyes were the answer.</p>

<p>"I," repeated Freder. "Are you fit to listen to me, and will
you be able to take good note of what I say? It is very
important, Georgi!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Georgi, paralysed.</p>

<p>"We shall now exchange lives, Georgi. You take mine, I yours.
I shall take your place at the machine. You go quietly out in my
clothes. Nobody noticed me when I came here. Nobody will notice
you when you go. You must only not lose your nerve and keep
calm. Keep under cover of where the air is brewing like a mist.
When you reach the street take a car. You will find more than
enough money in my pockets. Three streets further on change the
car. And again after another three streets. Then drive to the
Ninetieth Block. At the corner pay off the taxi and wait until
the driver is out of sight. Then find your way to the seventh
floor of the seventh house. A man called Josaphat lives there.
You are to go to him. Tell him I sent you. Wait for me or for a
message from me. Do you understand, Georgi?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>But the "Yes" was empty and seemed to reply to something
other than Freder's question.</p>

<p>A little while later the son of Joh Fredersen, the Master of
the great Metropolis, was standing before the machine which was
like Ganesha, the god with the elephant's head.</p>

<p>He wore the uniform of all the workmen of Metropolis: from
throat to ankle the dark blue linen, bare feet in the hard
shoes, hair firmly pressed down by the black cap.</p>

<p>He held his hand on the lever and his gaze was set on the
clock, the hands of which vibrated like magnetic needles.</p>

<p>The hunted stream of air washed around him making the folds
of the canvas flutter.</p>

<p>Then he felt how, slowly, chokingly, from the incessant
trembling of the floor, from the walls in which the furnaces
whistled, from the ceiling which seemed eternally to be in the
act of falling down, from the pushing of the short arms of the
machine, from the steady resistance of the gleaming body, terror
welled up in him&mdash;terror, even to the certainty of
Death.</p>

<p>He felt&mdash;and saw, too&mdash;how, from out the swathes of
vapour, the long soft elephant's trunk of the god Ganesha
loosened itself from the head, sunken on the chest, and gently,
with unerring finger, felt for his, Freder's forehead. He felt
the touch of this sucker, almost cool, not in the least painful,
but horrible. Just in the centre, over the bridge of the nose,
the ghostly trunk sucked itself fast; it was hardly a pain, yet
it bored a fine, dead-sure gimlet, towards the centre of the
brain. As though fastened to the clock of an infernal machine
the heart began to thump. Pater-noster...Pater-noster...
Pater-noster...</p>

<p>"I will not," said Freder, throwing back his head to break
the cursed contact: "I will not...I will...I will not..."</p>

<p>He groped for he felt the sweat dropping from his temples
like drops of blood in all pockets of the strange uniform which
he wore. He felt a rag in one of them and drew it out. He mopped
his forehead and, in doing so, felt the sharp edge of a stiff
piece of paper, of which he had taken hold together with the
cloth.</p>

<p>He pocketed the cloth and examined the paper.</p>

<p>It was no larger than a man's hand, bearing neither print nor
script, being covered over and over with the tracing of a
strange symbol and an apparently half-destroyed plan.</p>

<p>Freder tried hard to make something of it but he did not
succeed. Of all the signs marked on the plan he did not know
one. Ways seemed to be indicated, seeming to be false ways, but
they all led to one destination; to a place which was filled
with crosses.</p>

<p>A symbol of life? Sense in nonsense?</p>

<p>As Joh Fredersen's son, Freder was accustomed swiftly and
correctly to grasp anything called a plan. He pocketed the plan
though it remained before his eyes.</p>

<p>The sucker of the elephant's trunk of the god Ganesha glided
down to the occupied unsubdued brain which reflected, analysed
and sought. The head, not tamed, sank back into the chest.
Obediently, eagerly, worked the little machine which drove the
Pater-noster of the New Tower of Babel.</p>

<p>A little glimmering light played upon the more delicate
joints almost on the top of the machine, like a small malicious
eye.</p>

<p>The machine had plenty of time. Many hours would pass before
the Master of Metropolis, before Joh Fredersen would tear the
food which his machines were chewing up from the teeth of his
mighty machines.</p>

<p>Quite softly, almost smilingly, the gleaming eye, the
malicious eye, of the delicate machine looked down upon Joh
Fredersen's son, who was standing before it...</p>

<p>Georgi had left the New Tower of Babel unchallenged, through
various doors and the city received him, the great Metropolis
which swayed in the dance of light and which was a dancer.</p>

<p>He stood in the street, drinking in the drunken air. He felt
white silk on his body. On his feet he felt shoes which were
soft and supple. He breathed deeply and the fullness of his own
breath filled him with the most high intoxicating
intoxication.</p>

<p>He saw a city which he had never seen. He saw it as a man he
had never been. He did not walk in a stream of others: a stream
twelve flies deep...He wore no blue linen, no hard shoes, no
cap. He was not going to work. Work was put away, another man
was doing his work for him.</p>

<p>A man had come to him and had said: "We shall now exchange
lives, Georgi; you take mine and I yours..."</p>

<p>"When you reach the street, take a car."</p>

<p>"You will find more than enough money in my pockets..."</p>

<p>"You will find more than enough money in my pockets..."</p>

<p>"You will find more than enough money in my pockets..."</p>

<p>Georgi looked at the city which he had never seen...</p>

<p>Ah! The intoxication of the lights. Ecstasy of
Brightness!&mdash;Ah! Thousand-limbed city, built up of blocks
of light. Towers of brilliance! Steep mountains of splendour!
From the velvety sky above you showers golden rain,
inexhaustibly, as into the open lap of the Danae.</p>

<p>Ah&mdash;Metropolis! Metropolis!</p>

<p>A drunken man, he took his first steps, saw a flame which
hissed up into the heavens. A rocket wrote in drops of light on
the velvety sky the word: Yoshiwara...</p>

<p>George ran across the street, reached the steps, and, taking
three steps at a time, reached the roadway. Soft, flexible, a
black willing beast, a car approached, stopped at his feet.</p>

<p>Georgi sprang into the car, fell back upon the cushions, the
engine of the powerful automobile vibrating soundlessly. A
recollection stiffened the man's body.</p>

<p>Was there not, somewhere in the world&mdash;and not so very
far away, under the sole of the New Tower of Babel, a room which
was run through by incessant trembling? Did not a delicate
little machine stand in the middle of this room, shining with
oil and having strong, gleaming limbs? Under the crouching body
and the head, which was sunken on the chest, crooked legs
rested, gnome&mdash;Like upon the platform. The trunk and legs
were motionless. But the short arms pushed and pushed and
pushed, alternately forwards, backwards, and forwards. The floor
which was of stone and seamless, trembled under the pushing of
the little machine which was smaller than a five-year-old
child.</p>

<p>The voice of the driver asked: "Where to, sir?"</p>

<p>Straight on, motioned Georgi with his hand. Anywhere...</p>

<p>The man had said to him: Change the car after the third
street.</p>

<p>But the rhythm of the motor-car embraced him too
delightfully. Third street...sixth street...It was still very
far to the ninetieth block.</p>

<p>He was filled with the wonder of being thus couched, the
bewilderment of the lights, the shudder of entrancement at the
motion.</p>

<p>The further that, with the soundless gliding of the wheels,
he drew away from the New Tower of Babel, the further did he
seem to draw away from the consciousnes of his own self.</p>

<p>Who was he&mdash;? Had he not just stood in a greasy patched,
blue linen uniform, in a seething hell, his brain mangled by
eternal watchfulness, with bones, the marrow of which was being
sucked out by eternally making the same turn of the lever to
eternally the same rhythm, with face scorched by unbearable
heat, and in the skin of which the salty sweat tore its
devouring furrows?</p>

<p>Did he not live in a town which lay deeper under the earth
than the underground stations of Metropolis, with their thousand
shafts&mdash;In a town the houses of which storied just as high
above squares and streets as, above in the night, did the houses
of Metropolis, which towered so high, one above the other?</p>

<p>Had he ever known anything else than the horrible sobriety of
these houses, in which there lived not men, but numbers,
recognisable only by the enormous placards by the house-doors?</p>

<p>Had his life ever had any purpose other than to go out from
these doors, framed with numbers, out to work, when the sirens
of Metropolis howled for him&mdash;and ten hours later, crushed
and tired to death, to stumble into the house by the door of
which his number stood?</p>

<p>Was he, himself, anything but a number&mdash;number
11811&mdash;crammed into his linen, his clothes, his cap? Had
not the number also become imprinted into his soul, into his
brain, into his blood, that he must even stop and think of his
own name?</p>

<p>And now&mdash;?</p>

<p>And now&mdash;?</p>

<p>His body refreshed by pure cold water which had washed the
sweat of labour from him, felt, with wonderful sweetness, the
yielding relaxation of all his muscles. With a quiver which
rendered all his muscles weak he felt the caressing touch of
white silk on the bare skin of his body, and, while giving
himself up to the gentle, even rhythm of the motion, the
consciousness of the first and complete deliverance from all
that which had put so agonising a pressure on his existence
overcame him with so overpowering a force that he burst out into
the laughter of a madman, his tears falling uncontrollably.</p>

<p>Violently, aye, with a glorious violence, the great city
whirled towards him, like a sea which roars around
mountains.</p>

<p>The workman No. 11811, the man who lived in a
prison&mdash;Like house, under the underground railway of
Metropolis, who knew no other way than that from the hole in
which he slept to the machine and from the machine back to the
hole&mdash;this man saw, for the first time in his life, the
wonder of the world, which was Metropolis: the city, by night
shining under millions and millions of lights.</p>

<p>He saw the ocean of light which filled the endless trails of
streets with a silver, flashing lustre. He saw the will-o'-the-wisp
sparkle of the electric advertisements, lavishing
themselves inexhaustibly in an ecstasy of brightness. He saw
towers projecting, built up of blocks of light, feeling himself
seized, overpowered to a state of complete impotence by this
intoxication of light, feeling this sparkling ocean with its
hundreds and thousands of spraying waves, to reach out for him,
to take the breath from his mouth, to pierce him, suffocate
him...</p>

<p>And then he grasped that this city of machines, this city of
sobriety, this fanatic for work, sought, at night, the mighty
counterpoise to the frenzy of the day's work&mdash;that this
city, at night, lost itself, as one insane, as one entirely
witless, in the intoxication of a pleasure, which, flinging up
to all heights, hurtling down to all depths, was boundlessly
blissful and boundlessly destructive.</p>

<p>Georgi trembled from head to foot. And yet it was not really
trembling which seized his resistless body. It was as though all
his members were fastened to the soundless evenness of the
engine which bore them forwards. No, not to the single engine
which was the heart of the motor-car in which he sat&mdash;to
all these hundreds and thousands of engines which were driving
an endlessly gliding, double stream of gleaming illuminated
automobiles, on through the streets of the city in its nocturnal
fever. And, at the same time, his body was set in vibration by
the fire-works of spark-streaming wheels, ten-coloured lettering
snow-white fountains of overcharged lamps, rockets, hissing
upwards, towers of flame, blazing ice-cold.</p>

<p>There was a word which always recurred. From an invisible
source there shot up a sheaf of light, which bursting apart at
the highest point, dropped down letters in all colours of the
rainbow from the velvet-black sky of Metropolis.</p>

<p>The letters formed themselves into the word: Yoshiwara.</p>

<p>What did that mean: Yoshiwara&mdash;?</p>

<p>From the iron-work of the elevated railway-track a yellow-skinned
fellow hung, head downwards, suspended by the crocks of
his knees, who let a snow-storm of white sheets of paper shower
down upon the double row of motor-cars.</p>

<p>The pages fluttered and fell. Georgi's glance caught one of
them. Upon it stood, in large, distorted letters: Yoshiwara.</p>

<p>The car stopped at a crossing. Yellow-skinned fellows, in
many-coloured embroidered silk jackets, wound themselves, supple
as eels, through the twelvefold strings of waiting cars. One of
them swung himself onto the foot-board of the black motor-car in
which Georgi sat. For one second the grinning hideousness stared
into the young, white, helpless face.</p>

<p>A sheaf of hand-bills were hurled through the window, falling
upon Georgi's knee and before his feet. He bent down
mechanically and picked up that for which his fingers were
groping.</p>

<p>On these slips, which gave out a penetrating, bitter-sweet,
seductive perfume, there stood, in large, bewitched-looking
letters, the word: Yoshiwara...</p>

<p>Georgi's throat was as dry as dust. He moistened his cracked
lips with his tongue, which lay heavy and as though parched in
his mouth.</p>

<p>A voice had said to him: "You will find more than enough
money in my pockets..."</p>

<p>Enough money...what for? To clutch and drag near this city&mdash;
this mighty, heavenly, hellish city; to embrace her with both
arms, both legs, in the irnpotence of mastering her; to despair,
to throw oneself into her&mdash;take me!&mdash;take
me!&mdash;To feel the filled bowl at one's lips&mdash;gulping,
gulping&mdash;not drawing breath, the brim of the bowl set fast
between the teeth&mdash;eternal, eternal insatiability,
competing with the eternal, eternal overflow, overpouring of the
bowl of intoxication...</p>

<p>Ah&mdash;Metropolis!...Metropolis!...</p>

<p>"More than enough money..."</p>

<p>A strange sound came from Georgi's throat, and there was
something in it of the throat-rattle of a man who knows he is
dreaming and wants to awake, and something of the gutteral sound
of the beast of prey when it scents blood. His hand did not let
go of the wad of bank-notes for the second time. It screwed it
up in burning convulsive fingers.</p>

<p>He turned his head this way and that, as though seeking a way
out, which, nevertheless, he feared to find...</p>

<p>Another car slipped silently along beside his, a great,
black-gleaming shadow, the couch of a woman, set on four wheels,
decorated with flowers, lighted by dim lamps. Georgi saw the
woman very clearly, and the woman looked at him. She cowered
rather than sat, among the cushions of the car, having entirely
wrapped herself in her gleaming cloak, from which one shoulder
projected with the dull whiteness of a swan's feather.</p>

<p>She was bewilderingly made-up&mdash;as though she did not
wish to be human, to be a woman, but rather a peculiar animal,
disposed, perhaps to play, perhaps to murder.</p>

<p>Calmly holding the man's gaze, she gently slipped her right
hand, sparkling with stones, and the slender arm, which was
quite bare and dull white, even as the shoulder, from the
wrappings of her cloak, and began to fan herself in a leisurely
manner with one of the sheets of paper on which the word
Yoshiwara stood...</p>

<p>"No!" said the man. He panted, wiping the perspiration from
his forehead. Coolness welled out from the fine, strange stuff
with which he dried the perspiration from his brow.</p>

<p>Eyes stared at him. Eyes which were fading away. The
all-knowing smile of a painted mouth.</p>

<p>With a panting sound Georgi made to open the door of the taxi
and to jump out into the road. However, the movement of the car
threw him back on to the cushions. He clenched his fists,
pressing them before both eyes. A vision shot through his head,
quite misty and lacking in outline, a strong little machine, no
larger than a five-year-old child. It's short arms pushed and
pushed and pushed, alternately forwards, backwards,
forwards...The head, sunken on the chest, rose, grinning...</p>

<p>"No!" shrieked the man, clapping his hands and laughing. He
had been set free from the machine. He had exchanged lives.</p>

<p>Exchanged&mdash;with whom?</p>

<p>With a man who had said: "You will find more than enough
money in my pockets..."</p>

<p>The man bent back his head into the nape of his neck and
stared at the roof suspended above him.</p>

<p>On the roof there flamed the word:</p>

<p>Yoshiwara...</p>

<p>The word Yoshiwara became rockets of light which showered
around him, paralysing his limbs. He sat motionless, covered in
a cold sweat. He clawed his fingers into the leather of the
cushions. His back was stiff, as though his spine were made of
cold iron. His jaws chattered.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;!" said Georgi, tearing his fists down. But before
his eyes which stared into space, the word flamed up:</p>

<p>"Yoshiwara..."</p>

<p>Music was in the air, hurled into the nocturnal streets by
enormous loudspeakers. Wanton was the music, most heated of
rhythm, of a shrieking, lashing gaiety...</p>

<p>"No&mdash;!" panted the man. Blood trickled in drops from his
bitten lips.</p>

<p>But a hundred multi-coloured rockets wrote in the velvet-black
sky of Metropolis, the word:</p>

<br>

<p class="sign">YOSHIWARA...</p>

<br>

<p>Georgi pushed the window open. The glorious town of
Metropolis, dancing in the drunkenness of light, threw itself
impetuously towards him, as though he were the only-beloved, the
only-awaited. He leant out of the window, crying:</p>

<p>"Yoshiwara&mdash;"</p>

<p>He fell back upon the cushions. The car turned in a gentle
curve, round in another direction.</p>

<p>A rocket shot up and wrote in the sky above Metropolis:
Yoshiwara.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="first">THERE was a house in the great Metropolis which
was older than the town. Many said that it was older, even, than
the cathedral, and, before the Archangel Michael raised his
voice as advocate in the conflict for God, the house stood there
in its evil gloom, defying the cathedral from out its dull
eyes.</p>

<p>It had lived through the time of smoke and soot. Every year
which passed over the city seemed to creep, when dying, into
this house, so that, at last it was a cemetery&mdash;a coffin,
filled with dead tens of years.</p>

<p>Set into the black wood of the door stood, copper-red,
mysterious, the seal of Solomon, the pentagram.</p>

<p>It was said that a magician, who came from the East (and in
the track of whom the plague wandered) had built the house in
seven nights. But the masons and carpenters of the town did not
know who had mortared the bricks, nor who had erected the roof.
No foreman's speech and no ribboned nosegay had hallowed the
Builder's Feast after the pious custom. The chronicles of the
town held no record of when the magician died nor of how he
died. One day it occurred to the citizens as odd that the red
shoes of the magician had so long shunned the abominable plaster
of the town. Entrance was forced into the house and not a living
soul was found inside. But the rooms, which received, neither by
day nor by night, a ray from the great lights of the sky, seemed
to be waiting for their master, sunken in sleep. Parchments and
folios lay about, open, under a covering of dust, like silver-grey
velvet.</p>

<p>Set in all the doors stood, copper-red, mysterious, the seal
of Solomon, the pentagram.</p>

<p>Then came a time which pulled down antiquities. Then the
words were spoken: The house must die. But the house was
stronger than the words, as it was stronger than the centuries.
With suddenly falling stones it slew those who laid hands on its
walls. It opened the floor under their feet, dragging them down
into a shaft, of which no man had previously had any knowledge.
It was as though the plague, which had formerly wandered in the
wake of the red shoes of the magician, still crouched in the
corners of the narrow house, springing out at men from behind,
to seize them by the neck. They died, and no doctor knew the
illness. The house resisted its destruction with so great a
force that word of its malignity went out over the borders of
the city, spreading far over the land, that, at last, there was
no honest man to be found who would have ventured to make war
against it. Yes, even the thieves and the rogues, who were
promised remission of their sentence provided that they declared
themselves ready to pull down the magician's house, preferred to
go to the pillory, or even to the scaffold, rather than to enter
within these spiteful walls, these latchless doors, which were
sealed with Solomon's seal.</p>

<p>The little town around the cathedral became a large town and
grew into Metropolis, and into the centre of the world.</p>

<p>One day there came to the town a man from far away, who saw
the house and said: "I want to have that."</p>

<p>He was initiated into the story of the house. He did not
smile. He stood by his resolution. He bought the house at a very
low price, moved in at once and kept it unaltered.</p>

<p>This man was called Rotwang. Few knew him. Only Joh Fredersen
knew him very well. It would have been easier for him to have
decided to fight out the quarrel about the cathedral with the
sect of Gothics than the quarrel with Rotwang about the
magician's house.</p>

<p>There were in Metropolis, in this city of reasoned,
methodical hurry, very many who would rather have gone far out
of their way than have passed by Rotwang's house. It hardly
reached knee-high to the house-giants which stood near it. It
stood at an angle to the street. To the cleanly town, which knew
neither smoke nor soot, it was a blot and an annoyance. But it
remained. When Rotwang left the house and crossed the street,
which occurred but seldom, there were many who covertly looked
at his feet, to see if, perhaps, he walked in red shoes.</p>

<p>Before the door of this house, on which the seal of Solomon
glowed, stood Joh Fredersen.</p>

<p>He had sent the car away and had knocked.</p>

<p>He waited, then knocked again.</p>

<p>A voice asked, as if the house were speaking in its
sleep:</p>

<p>"Who is there?"</p>

<p>"Joh Fredersen," said the man.</p>

<p>The door opened.</p>

<p>He entered. The door closed. He stood in darkness. But Joh
Fredersen knew the house well. He walked straight on, and as he
walked, the shimmering tracks of two stepping feet glistened
before him, along the passage, and the edge of the stair began
to glow. Like a dog showing the track, the glow ran on before
him, up the steps, to die out behind him.</p>

<p>He reached the top of the stairs and looked about him. He
knew that many doors opened out here. But on the one opposite
him the copper seal glowed like a distorted eye, which looked at
him.</p>

<p>He stepped up to it. The door opened before him.</p>

<p>Many doors as Rotwang's house possessed, this was the only
one which opened itself to Joh Fredersen, although, and even,
perhaps, because, the owner of this house knew full well that it
always meant no mean effort for Joh Fredersen to cross this
threshold.</p>

<p>He drew in the air of the room, lingeringly, but deeply, as
though seeking in it the trace of another breath...</p>

<p>His nonchalant hand threw his hat on a chair. Slowly, in
sudden and mournful weariness, he let his eyes wander through
the room.</p>

<p>It was almost empty. A large, time-blackened chair, such as
are to be found in old churches, stood before drawn curtains.
These curtains covered a recess the width of the wall.</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen remained standing by the door for a long time,
without moving. He had closed his eyes. With incomparable
impotence he breathed in the odour of hyacinths, which teemed to
fill the motionless air of this room.</p>

<p>Without opening his eyes, swaying a little, but aim-sure, he
walked up to the heavy, black curtains and drew them apart.</p>

<p>Then he opened his eyes and stood quite still...</p>

<p>On a pedestal, the breadth of the wall, rested the head of a
woman in stone...</p>

<p>It was not the work of an artist, it was the work of a man,
who, in agonies for which the human tongue lacks words, had
wrestled with the white stone throughout immeasurable days and
nights until at last it seemed to realise and form the woman's
head by itself. It was as if no tool had been at work
here&mdash;no, it was as if a man, lying before this stone, had
called on the name of the woman, unceasingly, with all the
strength, with all the longing, with all the despair, of his
brain, blood and heart, until the shapeless stone took pity on
him letting itself turn into the image of the woman, who had
meant to two men all heaven and all hell.</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen's eyes sank to the words which were hewn into
the pedestal, roughly, as though chiselled with curses.</p>

<br>

<p class="sign">HEL</p>

<p class="sign">Born</p>

<p class="sign">To be my happiness, a blessing to all men.</p>

<p class="sign">Lost to Joh Fredersen</p>

<p class="sign">Dying in giving life to his son, Freder</p>

<br>

<p>Yes, she died then. But Joh Fredersen knew only too well that
she did not die from giving birth to her child. She died then
because she had done what she had to do. She really died on the
day upon which she went from Rotwang to Joh Fredersen, wondering
that her feet left no bloody traces behind on the way. She had
died because she was unable to withstand the great love of Joh
Fredersen and because she had been forced by him to tear asunder
the life of another.</p>

<p>Never was the expression of deliverance at last more strong
upon a human face than upon Hel's face when she knew that she
would die.</p>

<p>But in the same hour the mightiest man in Metropolis had lain
on the floor, screaming like a wild beast, the bones of which
are being broken in its living body.</p>

<p>And, on his meeting Rotwang, four weeks later, he found that
the dense, disordered hair over the wonderful brow of the
inventor was snow-white, and in the eyes under this brow the
smouldering of a hatred which was very closely related to
madness.</p>

<p>In this great love, in this great hatred, the poor, dead Hel
had remained alive to both men...</p>

<p>"You must wait a little while," said the voice which sounded
as though the house were talking in its sleep.</p>

<p>"Listen, Rotwang," said Joh Fredersen. "You know that I treat
your little juggling tricks with patience, and that I come to
you when I want anything of you, and that you are the only man
who can say that of himself. But you will never get me to join
in with you when you play the fool. You know, too, that I have
no time to waste. Don't make us both ridiculous, but come!"</p>

<p>"I told you that you would have to wait a little while,"
explained the voice, seeming to grow more distant.</p>

<p>"I shall not wait. I shall go."</p>

<p>"Do so, Joh Fredersen!"</p>

<p>He wanted to do so. But the door through which he had entered
had no key, no latch. The seal of Solomon, glowing copper-red,
blinked at him.</p>

<p>A soft, far-off voice laughed.</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen had stopped still, his back to the room. A
quiver ran down his back, running along the hanging arms to the
clenched fists.</p>

<p>"You should have your skull smashed in," said Joh Fredersen,
very softly. "You should have your skull smashed in...that is,
if it did not contain so valuable a brain..."</p>

<p>"You can do no more to me than you have done," said the
far-off voice.</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen was silent.</p>

<p>"Which do you think," continued the voice, "to be more
painful: to smash in the skull, or to tear the heart out of the
body?"</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen was silent.</p>

<p>"Are your wits frozen, that you don't answer, Joh
Fredersen?"</p>

<p>"A brain like yours should be able to forget," said the man
standing at the door, staring at Solomon's seal.</p>

<p>The soft, far-off voice laughed.</p>

<p>"Forget? I have twice in my life forgotten something...Once
that Aetro-oil and quicksilver have an idiosyncracy as regards
each other; that cost me my arm. Secondly that Hel was a woman
and you a man; that cost me my heart. The third time, I am
afraid, it will cost me my head. I shall never again forget
anything, Joh Fredersen."</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen was silent.</p>

<p>The far-off voice was silent, too.</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen turned round and walked to the table. He piled
books and parchments on top of each other, sat down and took a
piece of paper from his pocket. He laid it before him and looked
at it.</p>

<p>It was no larger than a man's hand, bearing neither print nor
script, being covered over and over with the tracing of a
strange symbol and an apparently half-destroyed plan. Ways
seemed to be indicated, seeming to be false ways, but they all
led one way; to a place that was filled with crosses.</p>

<p>Suddenly he felt, from the back, a certain coldness
approaching him. Involuntarily he held his breath.</p>

<p>A hand grasped along, by his head, a graceful, skeleton hand.
Transparent skin was stretched over the slender joints, which
gleamed beneath it like dull silver. Fingers, snow-white and
fleshless, closed over the plan which lay on the table, and,
lifting it up, took it away with it.</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen swung around. He stared at the being which
stood before him with eyes which grew glassy.</p>

<p>The being was, indubitably, a woman. In the soft garment
which it wore stood a body, like the body of a young birch tree,
swaying on feet set fast together. But, although it was a woman,
it was not human. The body seemed as though made of crystal,
through which the bones shone silver. Cold streamed from the
glazen skin which did not contain a drop of blood. The being
held its beautiful hands pressed against its breast, which was
motionless, with a gesture of determination, almost of
defiance.</p>

<p>But the being had no face. The beautiful curve of the neck
bore a lump of carelessly shaped mass. The skull was bald, nose,
lips, temples merely traced. Eyes, as though painted on closed
lids, stared unseeingly, with an expression of calm madness, at
the man&mdash;who did not breathe.</p>

<p>"Be courteous, my parody," said the far-off voice, which
sounded as though the house were talking in its sleep. "Greet
Joh Fredersen, the Master over the great Metropolis."</p>

<p>The being bowed slowly to the man. The mad eyes neared him
like two darting flames. The mass began to speak; it said in a
voice full of a horrible tenderness:</p>

<p>"Good evening, Joh Fredersen."</p>

<p>And these words were more alluring than a half-open
mouth.</p>

<p>"Good, my Pearl! Good, my Crown-jewel!" said the far-off
voice, full of praise and pride.</p>

<p>But at the same moment the being lost its balance. It fell,
tipping forward, towards Joh Fredersen. He stretched out his
hands to catch it, feeling them, in the moment of contact, to be
burnt by an unbearable coldness, the brutality of which brought
up in him a feeling of anger and disgust.</p>

<p>He pushed the being away from him and towards Rotwang, who
was standing near him as though fallen from the air. Rotwang
took the being by the arm.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Too violent," he said. "Too violent. My
beautiful parody, I fear your temperament will get you into much
more trouble."</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Joh Fredersen, leaning his hands
against the edge of the table-top, which he felt behind him.</p>

<p>Rotwang turned his face towards him, his glorious eyes
glowing as watch fires glow when the wind lashes them with its
cold lash.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" he replied. "Futura...Parody...whatever you like
to call it. Also: delusion...In short: it is a woman...Every
man-creator makes himself a woman. I do not believe that humbug
about the first human being a man. If a male-god created the
world (which is to be hoped, Joh Fredersen) then he certainly
created woman first, lovingly and revelling in creative sport.
You can test it, Joh Fredersen: it is faultless. A little
cool&mdash;! admit, that comes of the material, which is my
secret. But she is not yet completely finished. She is not yet
discharged from the workshop of her creator. I cannot make up my
mind to do it. You understand that? Completion means setting
free. I do not want to set her free from me. That is why I have
not yet given her a face. You must give her that, Joh Fredersen.
For you were the one to order the new beings."</p>

<p>"I ordered machine men from you, Rotwang, which I can use at
my machines. No woman...no plaything."</p>

<p>"No plaything, Joh Fredersen, no...you and I, we no longer
play. Not for any stakes...We did it once. Once and never again.
No plaything, Joh Fredersen but a tool. Do you know what it
means to have a woman as a tool? A woman like this, faultless
and cool? And obedient&mdash;Implicitly obedient...Why do you
fight with the Gothics and the monk Desertus about the
cathedral? Send the woman to them Joh Fredersen! Send the woman
to them when they are kneeling, scourging themselves. Let this
faultless, cool woman walk through the rows of them, on her
silver feet, fragrance from the garden of life in the folds of
her garment...Who in the world knows how the blossoms of the
tree smell, on which the apple of knowledge ripened. The woman
is both: Fragrance of the blossom and the fruit...</p>

<p>"Shall I explain to you the newest creation of Rotwang, the
genius, Joh Fredersen? It will be sacrilege. But I owe it to
you. For you kindled the idea of creating within me, too...Shall
I show you how obedient my creatures is? Give me what you have
in your hand, Parody!"</p>

<p>"Stop..." said Joh Fredersen rather hoarsely. But the
infallible obedience of the creature which stood before the two
men brooked no delay in obeying. It opened its hands in which
the delicate bones shimmered silver, and handed to its creator
the piece of paper which it had taken from the table, before Joh
Fredersen's eyes.</p>

<p>"That's trickery, Rotwang," said Joh Fredersen.</p>

<p>The great inventor looked at him. He laughed. The noiseless
laughter drew back his mouth to his ears.</p>

<p>"No trickery, Joh Fredersen&mdash;the work of a genius! Shall
Futura dance to you? Shall my beautiful Parody play the
affectionate? Or the sulky? Cleopatra of Damayanti? Shall she
have the gestures of the Gothic Madonnas? Or the gestures of
love of an Asiatic dancer? What hair shall I plant upon the
skull of your tool? Shall she be modest or impudent? Excuse me
my many words, you man of few! I am drunk, d'you see, drunk with
being a creator. I intoxicate myself, I inebriate myself, on
your astonished face! I have surpassed your expectations, Joh
Fredersen, haven't I? And you do not know everything yet: my
beautiful Parody can sing, too! She can also read! The mechanism
of her brain is as infallible as that of your own, Joh
Fredersen!"</p>

<p>"If that is so," said the Master over the great Metropolis,
with a certain dryness in his voice, which had become quite
hoarse, "then command her to unriddle the plan which you have in
your hand, Rotwang..."</p>

<p>Rotwang burst out into laughter which was like the laughter
of a drunken man. He threw a glance at the piece of paper which
he held spread out in his fingers, and was about to pass it,
anticipatingly triumphant, to the being which stood beside
him.</p>

<p>But he stopped in the middle of the movement. With open
mouth, he stared at the piece of paper, raising it nearer and
nearer to his eyes.</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen, who was watching him, bent forward. He wanted
to say something, to ask a question. But before he could open
his lips Rotwang threw up his head and met Joh Fredersen's
glance with so green a fire in his eyes that the Master of the
great Metropolis remained dumb.</p>

<p>Twice, three times did this green glow flash between the
piece of paper and Joh Fredersen's face. And during the whole
time not a sound was perceptible in the room but the breath that
gushed in heaves from Rotwang's breast as though from a boiling,
poisoned source.</p>

<p>"Where did you get the plan?" the great inventor asked at
last. Though it was less a question than an expression of
astonished anger.</p>

<p>"That is not the point," answered Joh Fredersen. "It is about
this that I have come to you. There does not seem to be a soul
in Metropolis who can make anything of it."</p>

<p>Rotwang's laughter interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Your poor scholars!" cried the laughter. "What a task you
have set them, Joh Fredersen. How many hundredweights of printed
paper have you forced them to heave over. I am sure there is no
town on the globe, from the construction of the old Tower of
Babel onward, which they have not snuffled through from North to
South. Oh&mdash;If you could only smile, Parody! If only you
already had eyes to wink at me. But laugh, at least, Parody!
Laugh, rippingly, at the great scholars to whom the ground under
their feet is foreign!"</p>

<p>The being obeyed. It laughed, ripplingly.</p>

<p>"Then you know the plan, or what it represents?" asked Joh
Fredersen, through the laughter.</p>

<p>"Yes, by my poor soul, I know it," answered Rotwang. "But, by
my poor soul, I am not going to tell you what it is until you
tell me where you got the plan."</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen reflected. Rotwang did not take his gaze from
him. "Do not try to lie to me, Joh Fredersen," he said softly,
and with a whimsical melancholy.</p>

<p>"Somebody found the paper," began Joh Fredersen.</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;somebody?"</p>

<p>"One of my foremen."</p>

<p>"Grot?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Grot."</p>

<p>"Where did he find the plan?"</p>

<p>"In the pocket of a workman who was killed in the accident to
the Geyser machine."</p>

<p>"Grot brought you the paper?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And the meaning of the plan seemed to be unknown to
him?"</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen hesitated a moment with the answer.</p>

<p>"The meaning&mdash;yes; but not the plan. He told me he has
often seen this paper in the workmen's hands, and that they
anxiously keep it a secret, and that the men will crowd closely
around him who holds it."</p>

<p>"So the meaning of the plan has been kept secret from your
foreman."</p>

<p>"So it seems, for he could not explain it to me."</p>

<p>"H'm."</p>

<p>Rotwang turned to the being which was standing near him, with
the appearance of listening intently.</p>

<p>"What do you say about it, my beautiful Parody?"</p>

<p>The being stood motionless.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;?" said Joh Fredersen, with a sharp expression of
impatience.</p>

<p>Rotwang looked at him, jerkily turning his great skull
towards him. The glorious eyes crept behind their lids as though
wishing to have nothing in common with the strong white teeth
and the jaws of the beast of prey. But from beneath the almost
closed lids they gazed at Joh Fredersen, as though they sought
in his face the door to the great brain.</p>

<p>"How can one bind you, Joh Fredersen," he murmured, "what is
a word to you&mdash;or an oath...Oh God...you with your own
laws. What promise would you keep if the breaking of it seemed
expedient to you?"</p>

<p>"Don't talk rubbish, Rotwang," said Joh Fredersen. "I shall
hold my tongue because I still need you. I know quite well that
the people whom we need are our solitary tyrants. So, if you
know, speak."</p>

<p>Rotwang still hesitated; but gradually a smile took
possession of his features&mdash;a good natured and mysterious
smile, which was amusing itself at itself.</p>

<p>"You are standing on the entrance," he said.</p>

<p>"What does that mean?"</p>

<p>"To be taken literally, Joh Fredersen! You are standing on
the entrance."</p>

<p>"What entrance, Rotwang? You are wasting time that does not
belong to you..."</p>

<p>The smile on Rotwang's face deepened to serenity.</p>

<p>"Do you recollect, Joh Fredersen, how obstinately I refused,
that time, to let the underground railway be run under my
house?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I do! I still know the sum the detour cost me,
also!"</p>

<p>"The secret was expensive, I admit, but it was worth it. Just
take a look at the plan, Joh Fredersen, what is that?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps a flight of stairs..."</p>

<p>"Quite certainly a flight of stairs. It is a very slovenly
execution in the drawing as in reality..."</p>

<p>"So you know them?"</p>

<p>"I have the honour, Joh Fredersen&mdash;yes. Now come two
paces sideways. What is that?"</p>

<p>He had taken Joh Fredersen by the arm. He felt the fingers of
the artificial hand pressing into his muscles like the claws of
a bird of prey. With the right one Rotwang indicated the spot
upon which Joh Fredersen had stood.</p>

<p>"What is that?" he asked, shaking the hand which he held in
his grip.</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen bent down. He straightened himself up
again.</p>

<p>"A door?"</p>

<p>"Right, Joh Fredersen! A door! A perfectly fitting and well
shutting door. The man who built this house was an orderly and
careful person. Only once did he omit to give heed, and then he
had to pay for it. He went down the stairs which are under the
door, followed the careless steps and passages which are
connected with them, and never found his way back. It is not
easy to find, for those who lodged there did not care to have
strangers penetrate into their domain...I found my inquisitive
predecessor, Joh Fredersen, and recognised him at once&mdash;by
his pointed red shoes, which have preserved themselves
wonderfully. As a corpse he looked peaceful and
Christian&mdash;Like, both of which he certainly was not in his
life. The companions of his last hours probably contributed
considerably to the conversion of the erstwhile devil's
disciple..."</p>

<p>He tapped with his right forefinger upon a maze of crosses in
the centre of the plan.</p>

<p>"Here he lies. Just on this spot. His skull must have
enclosed a brain which was worthy of your own, Joh Fredersen,
and he had to perish because he once lost his way...What a pity
for him..."</p>

<p>"Where did he lose his way?" asked Joh Fredersen.</p>

<p>Rotwang looked long at him before speaking.</p>

<p>"In the city of graves, over which Metropolis stands," he
answered at last. "Deep below the moles' tunnels of your
underground railway, Joh Fredersen, lies the thousand-year-old
Metropolis of the thousand-year-old dead..."</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen was silent. His left eyebrow rose, while his
eyes narrowed. He fixed his gaze upon Rotwang, who had not taken
his eyes from him.</p>

<p>"What is the plan of this city of graves doing in the hands
and pockets of my workmen?"</p>

<p>"That is yet to be discovered," answered Rotwang.</p>

<p>"Will you help me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Tonight?"</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>"I shall come back after the changing of the shift."</p>

<p>"Do so, Joh Fredersen. And if you take some good
advice..."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Come in the uniform of your workmen, when you come
back!"</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen raised his head but the great inventor did not
let him speak. He raised his hand as one calling for and
admonishing to silence.</p>

<p>"The skull of the man in the red shoes also enclosed a
powerful brain, Joh Fredersen, but nevertheless, he could not
find his way homewards from those who dwell down there..."</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen reflected. He nodded and turned to go.</p>

<p>"Be courteous, my beautiful Parody," said Rotwang. "Open the
doors for the Master over the great Metropolis."</p>

<p>The being glided past Joh Fredersen. He felt the breath of
coldness which came forth from it. He saw the silent laughter
between the half-open lips of Rotwang, the great inventor. He
turned pale with rage, but he remained silent.</p>

<p>The being stretched out the transparent hand in which the
bones shone silver, and, touching it with its finger-tips, moved
the seal of Solomon, which glowed copperish.</p>

<p>The door yielded back. Joh Fredersen went out after the
being, which stepped downstairs before him.</p>

<p>There was no light on the stairs, nor in the narrow passage.
But a shimmer came from the being no stronger than that of a
green-burning candle, yet strong enough to lighten up the stairs
and the black walls.</p>

<p>At the house-door the being stopped still and waited for Joh
Fredersen, who was walking slowly along behind it. The house-door
opened before him, but not far enough for him to pass out
through the opening.</p>

<p>The eyes stared at him from the mass-head of the being, eyes
as though painted on closed lids, with the expression of calm
madness.</p>

<p>"Be courteous, my beautiful Parody," said a soft, far-off
voice, which sounded as though the house were talking in its
sleep.</p>

<p>The being bowed. It stretched out a hand&mdash;a graceful
skeleton hand. Transparent skin was stretched over the slender
joints, which gleamed beneath it like dull silver. Fingers,
snow-white and fleshless, opened like the petals of a crystal
lily.</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen laid his hand in it, feeling it, in the moment
of contact, to be burnt by an unbearable coldness. He wanted to
push the being away from him but the silver-crystal fingers held
him fast.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," Joh Fredersen, said the mass head, in a voice
full of a horrible tenderness. "Give me a face soon, Joh
Fredersen!"</p>

<p>A soft far-off voice laughed, as if the house were laughing
in its sleep.</p>

<p>The hand left go, the door opened, Joh Fredersen reeled into
the street.</p>

<p>The door closed behind him. In the gloomy wood of the door
glowed, copper-red, the seal of Solomon, the pentagram.</p>

<p>When Joh Fredersen was about to enter the brain-pan of the
New Tower of Babel Slim stood before him, seeming to be slimmer
than ever.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Joh Fredersen.</p>

<p>Slim made to speak but at the sight of his master the words
died on his lips.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;?" said Joh Fredersen, between his teeth.</p>

<p>Slim breathed deeply.</p>

<p>"I must inform you, Mr. Fredersen," he said, "that, since
your son left this room, he has disappeared!"</p>

<p>"What does that mean?...disappeared!"</p>

<p>"He has not gone home, and none of our men has seen
him..."</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen screwed up his mouth.</p>

<p>"Look for him!" he said hoarsely. "What are you all here for?
Look for him!"</p>

<p>He entered the brain-pan of the New Tower of Babel. His first
glance fell upon the clock. He stepped to the table and
stretched out his hand to the little blue metal plate.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="first">THE man before the machine which was like
Ganesha, the god with the elephant's head, was no longer a human
being. Merely a dripping piece of exhaustion, from the pores of
which the last powers of volition were oozing out in large drops
of sweat. Running eyes no longer saw the manometer. The hand did
not hold the lever&mdash;It clawed it fast in the last hold
which saved the mangled man-creature before it from falling into
the crushing arms of the machine.</p>

<p>The Pater-noster works of the New Tower of Babel turned their
buckets with an easy smoothness. The eye of the little machine
smiled softly and maliciously at the man who stood before it and
who was now no more than a babel.</p>

<p>"Father!" babbled the son of Joh Fredersen, "to-day, for the
first time, since Metropolis stood, you have forgotten to let
your city and your great machines roar punctually for fresh
food...Has Metropolis gone dumb, father? Look at us! Look at
your machines! Your god-machines turn sick at the chewed-up cuds
in their mouths&mdash;at the mangled food that we are...Why do
you strangle its voice to death? Will ten hours never, never
come to an end? Our Father, which art in heaven&mdash;!"</p>

<p>But in this moment Joh Fredersen's fingers were pressing the
little blue metal plate and the voice of the great
Metropolis.</p>

<p>"Thank you, father!" said the mangled soul before the
machine, which was like Ganesha. He smiled. He tasted a salty
taste on his lips and did not know if it was from blood, sweat
or tears. From out a red mist of long-flamed, drawn-out clouds,
fresh men shuffled on towards him. His hand slipped from the
lever and he collapsed. Arms pulled him up and led him away. He
turned his head aside to hide his face.</p>

<p>The eye of the little machine, the soft, malicious eye,
twinkled at him from behind.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, friend," said the little machine.</p>

<p>Freder's head fell upon his breast. He felt himself dragged
further, heard the dull evenness of feet tramping onwards, felt
himself tramping, a member of twelve members. The ground under
his feet began to roll; it was drawn upwards, pulling him up
with it.</p>

<p>Doors stood open, double doors. Towards him came a stream of
men.</p>

<p>The great Metropolis was still roaring.</p>

<p>Suddenly she fell dumb and in the silence Freder became aware
of the breath of a man at his ear, and of a voice&mdash;merely a
breath&mdash;which asked:</p>

<p>"She has called...Are you coming?"</p>

<p>He did not know what the question meant, but he nodded. He
wanted to get to know the ways of those who walked, as he, in
blue linen, in the black cap, in the hard shoes.</p>

<p>With tightly closed eyelids he groped on, shoulder to
shoulder with an unknown man.</p>

<p>She has called, he thought, half asleep. Who is
that...she...?</p>

<p>He walked and walked in' smouldering weariness. The way would
never, never come to an end. He did not know where he was
walking. He heard the tramp of those who were walking with him
like the sound of perpetually falling water.</p>

<p>She has called! he thought. Who is that: she, whose voice is
so powerful that these men, exhausted to death by utter
weariness, voluntarily throw off sleep, which is the sweetest
thing of all to the weary&mdash;to follow her when her voice
calls?</p>

<p>It can't be very much further to the centre of the
earth...</p>

<p>Still deeper&mdash;still deeper down?</p>

<p>No longer any light round about, only, here and there,
twinkling pocket torches, in men's hands.</p>

<p>At last, in the far distance, a dull shimmer.</p>

<p>Have we wandered so far to walk towards the sun, thought
Freder, and does the sun dwell in the bowels of the earth?</p>

<p>The procession came to a standstill. Freder stopped too. He
staggered against the dry, cool stones.</p>

<p>Where are we, he thought&mdash;In a cave? If the sun dwells
here, then she can't be at home now...I am afraid we have come
in vain...Let us turn back, brother...Let us sleep...</p>

<p>He slid along the wall, fell on his knees, leant his head
against the stone...how smooth it was.</p>

<p>The murmur of human voices was around him, like the rustling
of trees, moved by the wind...</p>

<p>He smiled peacefully. It's wonderful to be tired...</p>

<p>Then a voice&mdash;a voice began to speak...</p>

<p>Oh&mdash;sweet voice, thought Freder dreamily. Tender beloved
voice, your voice, Virgin-mother! I have fallen asleep...Yes, I
am dreaming! I am dreaming of your voice, beloved!</p>

<p>But a slight pain at his temple made him think: I am leaning
my head on stone...I am conscious of the coldness which comes
out of the stone...I feel coldness under my knees...so I am not
sleeping&mdash;! am only dreaming...suppose it is not a
dream....? Suppose it is reality...?</p>

<p>With an exertion of will which brought a groan from him he
forced open his eyes and looked about him.</p>

<p>A vault, like the vault of a sepulchre, human heads so
closely crowded together as to produce the effect of clods on a
freshly ploughed field. All heads turned towards one point: to
the source of a light, as mild as God.</p>

<p>Candles burnt with sword&mdash;Like flames. Slender, lustrous
swords of light stood in a circle around the head of a girl,
whose voice was as the Amen of God.</p>

<p>The voice spoke, but Freder did not hear the words. He heard
nothing but a sound, the blessed melody of which was saturated
with sweetness as is the air of a garden of blossoms with
fragrance. And suddenly there sprang up above this melody the
wild throb of a heart-beat. The air stormed with bells. The
walls shook under the surf of an invisible organ.
Weariness&mdash;exhaustion&mdash;faded out! He felt his body
from head to foot to be one single instrument of
blissfulness&mdash;all strings stretched to bursting point, yet
tuned together into the purest, hottest, most radiant accord, in
which his whole being hung, quivering.</p>

<p>He longed to stroke with his hands the stones on which he
knelt. He longed to kiss with unbounded tenderness the stones on
which he rested his head. God&mdash;God&mdash;God&mdash;beat the heart
in his breast, and every throb was a thank-offering. He looked
at the girl, and yet he did not see her. He saw only a shimmer;
he knelt before it.</p>

<p>Gracious one, formed his mouth. Mine! Mine! My beloved! How
could the world have existed before you were? How must God have
smiled when he created you! You are speaking?&mdash;What are you
saying?&mdash;My heart is shouting within me&mdash;! cannot
catch your words...Be patient with me, gracious one,
beloved!</p>

<p>Without his being aware of it, drawn by an invisible
unbreakable cord, he pushed himself forward on his knees, nearer
and nearer to the shimmer which the girl's face, was to him. At
last he was so near that he could have touched the hem of her
dress with his outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"Look at me, Virgin!" implored his eyes. "Mother, look at
me!"</p>

<p>But her gentle eyes looked out over him. Her lips said:</p>

<p>"My brothers..."</p>

<p>And stopped dumb, as though alarmed.</p>

<p>Freder raised his head. Nothing had happened&mdash;nothing to
speak of, only that the air which passed through the room had
suddenly become audible, like a raised breath, and that it was
cool, as though coming in through open doors.</p>

<p>With a faint crackling sound the swords of flame bowed
themselves. Then they stood still again.</p>

<p>"Speak, my beloved!" said Freder's heart.</p>

<p>Yes, now she spoke. This is what she said:</p>

<p>"Do you want to know how the building of the Tower of Babel
began, and do you want to know how it ended? I see a man who
comes from the Dawn of the World. He is as beautiful as the
world, and has a burning heart. He loves to walk upon the
mountains and to offer his breast unto the wind and to speak
with the stars. He is strong and rules all creatures. He dreams
of God and feels himself closely tied to him. His nights are
filled with faces.</p>

<p>"One hallowed hour bursts his heart. The firmament is above
him and his friends. 'Oh friends! Friends!' he cries, pointing
to the stars. 'Great is the world and its Creator! Great is man!
Come, let us build a tower, the top of which reaches the sky!
And when we stand on its top, and hear the stars ringing above
us, then let us write our creed in golden symbols on the top of
the tower! Great is the world and its creator! And great is
man!"</p>

<p>"And they set to, a handful of men, full of confidence, and
they made bricks and dug up to the earth. Never have men worked
more rapidly, for they all had one thought, one aim and one
dream. When they rested from work in the evening each knew of
what the other was thinking. They did not need speech to make
themselves understood. But after some time they knew: The work
was greater than their working hands. Then they enlisted new
friends to their work. Then their work grew. It grew
overwhelming. Then the builders sent their messengers to all
four winds of the world and enlisted Hands, working Hands for
their mighty work."</p>

<p>"The Hands came. The Hands worked for wages. The Hands did
not even know what they were making. None of those building
Southwards knew one of those digging toward the North. The Brain
which conceived the construction of the Tower of Babel was
unknown to those who built it. Brain and Hands were far apart
and strangers. Brain and Hands became enemies. The pleasure of
one became the other's burden. The hymn of praise of one became
the other's curse.</p>

<p>"'Babel!' shouted one, 'meaning: Divinity, Coronation,
Eternal, Triumph!</p>

<p>"'Babel' shouted the other, meaning: Hell, Slavery, Eternal,
Damnation!</p>

<p>"The same word was prayer and blasphemy. Speaking the same
words, the men did not understand each other.</p>

<p>"That men no longer understood each other, that Brain and
Hands no longer understood each other, was to blame that the
Tower of Babel was given up to destruction, that never were the
words of those who had conceived it written on its top in golden
symbols: Great is the world and its Creator! And great is
man!</p>

<p>"That Brain and Hands no longer understand each other will
one day destroy the New Tower of Babel.</p>

<p>"Brain and Hands need a mediator. The Mediator between Brain
and Hands must be the Heart..."</p>

<p>She was silent. A breath like a sigh came up from the silent
lips of the listeners.</p>

<p>Then one stood up slowly, resting his fists upon the
shoulders of the man who crouched before him, and asked, raising
his thin face with its fanatical eyes to the girl: "And where is
our mediator, Maria?" The girl looked at him, and over her sweet
face passed the gleam of a boundless confidence.</p>

<p>"Wait for him," she said. "He is sure to come." A murmur ran
through the rows of men. Freder bowed his head to the girl's
feet, His whole soul said: "It shall be I."</p>

<p>But she did not see him and she did not hear him. "Be
patient, my brothers!" she said. "The way which your mediator
must take is long...There are many among you who cry, Fight!
Destroy!&mdash;Do not fight, my brothers, for that makes you to sin.
Believe me: One will come, who will speak for you&mdash;who will
be the mediator between you, the Hands, and the man whose Brain
and Will are over you all. He will give you something which is
more precious than anything which anybody could give you: To be
free, without sinning."</p>

<p>She stood up from the stone upon which she had been sitting.
A movement ran through the heads turned towards her. A voice was
raised. The speaker was not to be seen. It was as if they all
spoke:</p>

<p>"We shall wait, Maria. But not much longer&mdash;!"</p>

<p>The girl was silent. With her sad eyes she seemed to be
seeking the speaker among the crowd.</p>

<p>A man who stood before her spoke up to her:</p>

<p>"And if we fight&mdash;where will you be then?"</p>

<p>"With you!" said the girl, opening her hands with the gesture
of one sacrificing. "Have you ever found me faithless?"</p>

<p>"Never!" said the men. "You are like gold to us. We shall do
what you expect of us."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the girl, closing her eyes. With bowed head
she stood there, listening to the sound of retiring feet&mdash;feet
which walked in hard shoes.</p>

<p>Only when all about her had become silent and when the last
footfall had died away she sighed and opened her eyes.</p>

<p>Then she saw a man, wearing the blue linen and the black cap
and the hard shoes, kneeling at her feet.</p>

<p>She bent down. He raised his head. She looked at him.</p>

<p>And then she recognised him.</p>

<p><br>
(Behind them, in a vault that was shaped like a pointed
devil's-ear, one man's hand seized another man's arm. "Hush!
Keep quiet!" whispered the voice, which was soundless and yet
which had the effect of laughter&mdash;like the laughter of
spiteful mockery.)</p>

<p><br>
The girl's face was as a crystal, filled with snow. She made
a movement as if for flight. But her knees would not obey her.
Reeds which stand in troubled water do not tremble more than her
shoulders trembled.</p>

<p>"If you have come to betray us, son of Joh Fredersen, then
you will have but little blessing from it," she said softly, but
in a clear voice.</p>

<p>He stood up and remained standing before her.</p>

<p>"Is that all the faith you have in me?" he asked gravely.</p>

<p>She said nothing, but looked at him. Her eyes filled with
tears.</p>

<p>"You..." said the man. "What shall I call you? I do not know
your name. I have always called you just 'you' all the bad days
and worse nights, for I did not know if I should find you again,
I always called you only, 'you.'...Will you tell me, at last,
what your name is?"</p>

<p>"Maria," answered the girl.</p>

<p>"Maria...That should be your name...you did not make it easy
for me to find my way to you, Maria."</p>

<p>"And why did you seek your way to me? And why do you wear the
blue linen uniform? Those condemned to wear it all their life
long, live in an underground city, which is accounted a wonder
of the world in all the five continents. It is an architectural
wonder&mdash;that is true. It is light and shining bright and a
model of tidiness. It lacks nothing but the sun&mdash;and the
rain&mdash;and the moon by night&mdash;nothing but the sky. That
is why the children which are born there have their
gnome&mdash;Like faces...Do you want go down into this city
under the earth in order the more to enjoy your dwelling which
lies so high above the great Metropolis, in the light of the
sky? Are you wearing the uniform, which you have on to-day, for
fun?"</p>

<p>"No, Maria. I shall always wear it now."</p>

<p>"As Joh Fredersen's son?"</p>

<p>"He no longer has a son...unless&mdash;you, yourself, give
him back his son."</p>

<p><br>
(Behind them, in a vault that was shaped like a pointed
devil's-ear, one man's hand was laid upon another man's mouth.
"It is written," whispered a laugh: "Therefore shall a man leave
his father and his mother and cleave unto his wife...")</p>

<p><br>
"Won't you understand me?" asked Freder. "Why do you look at
me with such stern eyes? You wish me to be a mediator between
Joh Fredersen and those whom you call your brothers...There can
be no mediator between heaven and hell who never was in heaven
and hell...I never knew hell until yesterday. That is why I
failed so deplorably, yesterday, when I spoke to my father for
your brothers. Until you stood before me for the first time,
Maria, I lived the life of a dearly loved son. I did not know
what an unrealisable wish was. I knew no longing, for everything
was mine...Young as I am, I have exhausted the pleasures of the
earth, down to the very bottom. I had an aim&mdash;a gamble with
Death: A flight to the stars...And then you came and showed me
my brothers...From that day on I have sought you. I have so
longed for you that I should gladly and unhesitatingly have
died, had somebody told me that that was the way to you. But as
it was, I had to live and seek another way..."</p>

<p>"To me, or to your brothers...?"</p>

<p>"To you, Maria...I will not make myself out to you to be
better than I am. I want to come to you, Maria&mdash;and I want
you...I love mankind, not for its own sake, but for your
sake&mdash;because you love it. I do not want to help mankind
for its own sake, but for your sake&mdash;because you wish it.
Yesterday I did good to two men; I helped one whom my father had
dismissed. And I did the work of the man, whose uniform I have
on...That was my way to you...God bless you..."</p>

<p>His voice failed him. The girl stepped up to him. She took
his hands in both her hands. She gently turned the palms upward,
and considered them, looked at them with her Madonna-eyes, and
folded her hands tenderly around his, which she carefully laid
together.</p>

<p>"Maria," he said, without a sound.</p>

<p>She let his hands fall and raised her's to his head. She laid
her finger-tips on his cheeks. With her fingertips she stroked
his eyebrows, his temples, twice, three times.</p>

<p>Then he snatched her to his heart and they kissed each
other...</p>

<p>He no longer felt the stones under his feet. A wave carried
him, him and the girl whom he held clasped to him as though he
wished to die of it&mdash;and the wave came from the bottom of
the ocean, roaring as though the whole sea were an organ; and
the wave was of fire and flung right up to the heavens.</p>

<p>Then sinking...sinking...endlessly gliding down&mdash;right
down to the womb of the world, the source of the
beginning...Thirst and quenching drink...hunger and
satiation...pain and deliverance from it...death and
rebirth...</p>

<p>"You..." said the man to the girl's lips. "You are really the
great mediatress...You are all that is most sacred on
earth...You are all goodness...You are all grace...To doubt you
is to doubt God...Maria&mdash;Maria&mdash;you called
me&mdash;here I am!"</p>

<p><br>
(Behind them, in a vault that was shaped like a pointed
devil's-ear, one man leant towards another man's ear. "You
wanted to have the Futura's face from me...There you have your
model..."</p>

<p>"Is that a commission?"</p>

<p>"Yes.")</p>

<p><br>
"Now you must go, Freder," said the girl. Her Madonna eyes
looked at him.</p>

<p>"Go&mdash;and leave you here?"</p>

<p>She turned grave and shook her head.</p>

<p>"Nothing will happen to me," she said. "There is not one,
among those who know this place, whom I cannot trust as though
he were my blood brother. But what is between us is nobody's
affair; it would vex me to have to explain&mdash;" (and now she
was smiling again)&mdash;"what is inexplicable...: Do you see
that?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "Forgive me..." I</p>

<p><br>
(Behind them, in a vault that was shaped like a pointed
devil's-ear, a man took himself away from the wall.)</p>

<p><br>
"You know what you have to do," he said in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Yes," came the voice of the other, idly, sleepily, out of
the darkness. "But wait a bit, friend...I must ask you
something..."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Have you forgotten your own creed?"</p>

<p>For one second a lamp twinkled through the room, that was
shaped like a pointed devil's ear, impaling the face of the man,
who had already turned to go, on the pointed needle of its
brilliance.</p>

<p>"That sin and suffering are twin-sisters...you will be
sinning against two people, friend..."</p>

<p>"What has that to do with you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing...Or&mdash;little. Freder is Hel's son..."</p>

<p>"And mine..."</p>

<p>"Yes.</p>

<p>"It is he whom I do not wish to lose."</p>

<p>"Better to sin once more?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And?"</p>

<p>"To suffer. Yes."</p>

<p>"Very well, friend," and in the voice was an inaudible laugh
of mockery: "May it happen to you according to your
creed...!"</p>

<p>The girl walked through the passages that were so familiar to
her. The bright little lamp in her hand roved over the roof of
stone and over the stone walls, where, in niches, the
thousand-year-old dead slept.</p>

<p>The girl had never known fear of the dead; only reverence and
gravity in face of their gravity. To-day she saw neither wall
nor dead. She walked on, smiling and not knowing she did it. She
felt like singing. With an expression of happiness, which was
still incredulous and yet complete, she said the name of her
beloved over to herself.</p>

<p>Quite softly: "Freder..." And once more: "Freder..."</p>

<p>Then she raised her head, listening attentively, standing
quite still...</p>

<p>It came back as a whisper: An echo?&mdash;No.</p>

<p>Almost inaudibly a word was breathed:</p>

<p>"Maria..."</p>

<p>She turned around, blissfully startled. Was it possible that
he had come back.</p>

<p>"Freder&mdash;!" she called. She listened.</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>"Freder&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p>But suddenly there came a cool draught of air which made the
hair at her neck quiver, and a hand of snow ran down her
back.</p>

<p>There came an agonized sigh&mdash;a sigh which would not come
to an end...</p>

<p>The girl stood still. The bright little lamp which she held
in her hand let its gleam play tremblingly about her feet.</p>

<p>"Freder...?"</p>

<p>Now her voice, too, was only a whisper.</p>

<p>No answer. But, behind her, in the depths of the passage she
would have to pass through, a gentle, gliding slink became
perceptible: feet in soft shoes on rough stones...</p>

<p>That was...yes, that was strange. Nobody, apart from her,
ever came this way. Nobody could be here. And, if somebody were
here, then it was no friend...</p>

<p>Certainly nobody whom she wanted to meet.</p>

<p>Should she let him by&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>A second passage opened to her left. She did not know it
well. But she would not follow it up. She would only wait in it
until the man outside&mdash;the man behind her&mdash;had gone
by.</p>

<p>She pressed herself against the wall of the strange passage,
keeping still and waiting quite silently. She did not breath.
She had extinguished the lamp. She stood in utter darkness,
immovable.</p>

<p>She listened: the gliding feet were approaching. They walked
in darkness as she stood in darkness. Now they were here. Now
they must..they must go past...But they did not go. They stood
quite still. Before the opening to the passage in which she
stood, the feet stopped still and seemed to wait.</p>

<p>For what...? For her...?</p>

<p>In the complete silence the girl suddenly heard her own
heart...She heard her own heart, like pump-works, beating more
and more quickly, throbbing more and more loudly. These loud
throbbing heartbeats must also be heard by the man who kept the
opening to the passage. And suppose he did not stay there any
longer...suppose he came inside...she could not hear his coming,
her heart throbbed so.</p>

<p>She groped, with fumbling hand, along the stone wall. Without
breathing, she set her feet, one before the other...Only to get
away from the entrance...Away from the place where the other was
standing...</p>

<p>Was she wrong? Or were the feet really coming after her?
Soft, slinking shoes on rough stones? Now the agonised, heavy
breathing, heavier still, and nearer...cold breath on her
neck....Then&mdash;Nothing more. Silence. And waiting. And
watching&mdash;keeping on the look-out...</p>

<p>Was it not as if a creature, such as the world had never
seen: trunkless, nothing but arms, legs and head...but what a
head! God&mdash;God in heaven!...was crouching on the floor
before her, knees drawn up to chin, the damp arms supported
right and left, against the walls, near her hips, so that she
stood defenceless, caught? Did she not see die passage lighted
by a pale shimmer&mdash;and did not the shimmer come from the
being's jelly-fish head?</p>

<p>"Freder!" she thought. She bit the name tightly between her
jaws, yet heard the scream with which her heart screamed it.</p>

<p>She threw herself forwards and felt&mdash;she was
free&mdash;she was still free&mdash;and ran and stumbled, and
pulled herself up again and staggered from wall to wall,
knocking herself bloody, suddenly clutched into space, stumbled,
fell to the ground, felt...Something lay there...what?
No&mdash;No&mdash;No&mdash;!</p>

<p>The lamp had long since fallen from her hand. She raised
herself to her knees and clapped her fists to her ears, in order
not to hear the feet, the slinking feet coming nearer. She knew
herself to be imprisoned in darkness and yet opened her eyes
because she could no longer bear the circles of fire, the wheels
of flame behind her closed lids&mdash;</p>

<p>And saw her own shadow thrown, gigantic, on the wall before
her, and behind her was light, and before her lay a
man&mdash;</p>

<p>A man?&mdash;That was not a man...That was the remains of a
man, with his back half leaning against the wall, half slipped
down, and on his skeleton feet, which almost touched the girl's
knees, were the slender shoes, pointed and purple-red...</p>

<p>With a shriek which tore her throat, the girl threw herself
up, backwards&mdash;and then on and on, without looking round,
pursued by the light which lashed her own shadow in springs
before her feet&mdash;pursued by long, soft, feathery
feet&mdash;by feet which walked in red shoes, by the icy breath
which blew at her back.</p>

<p>She ran, screamed and ran&mdash;</p>

<p>"Freder...! Freder...!"</p>

<p>Her throat rattled, she fell.</p>

<p>There were some stairs...Crumbling stairs...She pressed her
bleeding hands, right and left, against the stone wall, by the
stone steps. She dragged herself up. She staggered up, step by
step...There was the top.</p>

<p>The stairs ended in a stone trap-door.</p>

<p>The girl groaned: "Freder...!"</p>

<p>She stretched both fists above her. She pushed head and
shoulders against the trap-door.</p>

<p>And one more groan: "Freder..."</p>

<p>The door rose and fell back with a crash.</p>

<p>Below&mdash;deep down&mdash;laughter...</p>

<p>The girl swung herself over the edge of the trapdoor. She ran
hither and thither, with outstretched hands. She ran along
walls, finding no door. She saw the lustre which welled up from
the depths. By this light she saw a door, which was latchless.
It had neither bolt nor lock.</p>

<p>In the gloomy wood glowed, copper-red, the seal of Solomon,
the pentagram.</p>

<p>The girl turned around.</p>

<p>She saw a man sitting on the edge of the trap-door and saw
his smile.</p>

<p>Then it was as though she were extinguished, and she plunged
into nothing...</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="first">THE proprietor of Yoshiwara used to earn money
in a variety of ways. One of them, and quite positively the most
harmless, was to make bets that no man&mdash;be he never so
widely travelled&mdash;was capable of guessing to what weird
mixture of races he owed his face. So far he had won all such
bets, and used to sweep in the money which they brought him with
hands, the cruel beauty of which would not have shamed an
ancestor of the Spanish Borgias, the nails of which, however,
showed an inobliterable shimmer of blue; on the other hand, the
politeness of his smile on such profitable occasions originated
unmistakably in that graceful insular world, which, from the
eastern border of Asia, smiles gently and watchfully across at
mighty America.</p>

<p>There were prominent properties combined within him which
made him appear to be a general representative of Great Britain
and Ireland, for he was as red-haired, chaff-loving and with as
good a head for drink as if his name had been McFosh, avaricious
and superstitious as a Scotsman and&mdash;In certain
circumstances, which made it requisite, of that highly bred
obliviousness, which is a matter of will and a foundation stone
of the British Empire. He spoke practicality all living
languages as though his mother had taught him to pray in them
and his father to curse. His greed appeared to hail from the
Levant, his contentment from China. And, above all this, two
quiet, observant eyes watched with German patience and
perseverance.</p>

<p>As to the rest, he was called, for reasons unknown,
September.</p>

<p>The visitants to Yoshiwara had met September in a variety of
emotions&mdash;from the block-headed dozing away of the well-contented
bushman to the dance-ecstatic of the Ukrainer.</p>

<p>But to come upon his features in an expression of absolute
bewilderment was reserved for Slim, when, on the morning after
his having lost sight of his young master, he set throbbing the
massive gong which demanded entrance to Yoshiwara.</p>

<p>It was most unusual that the generally very obliging door of
Yoshiwara was not opened before the fourth gong-signal; and that
this was performed by September himself and with this expression
of countenance deepened the impression of an only tolerably
overcome catastrophe. Slim bowed. September looked at him. A
mask of brass seemed to fall over his face. But a chance glance
at the driver of the taxi, in which Slim had come tore it off
again.</p>

<p>"Would to God your tin-kettle had gone up in the air before
you could have brought that lunatic here yesterday evening," he
said. "He drove away my guests before they even thought of
paying. The girls are huddling down in the corners like lumps of
wet floor-cloth&mdash;that is, those who are not in hysterics.
Unless I call in the police I might just as well close the
house; for it doesn't look as though that chap will have
recovered his five senses by this evening."</p>

<p>"Of whom are you speaking, September?" asked Slim.</p>

<p>September looked at him. At this moment the tiniest hamlet in
North Siberia would have flatly refused to have been proclaimed
the birth-place of so idiotic looking an individual.</p>

<p>"If it is the man for whom I have come here to look,"
continued Slim, "then I shall rid you of him in a more agreeable
and swifter manner than the police."</p>

<p>"And for what man are you looking, sir?"</p>

<p>Slim hesitated. He cleared his throat slightly. "You know the
white silk which is woven for' comparatively few in
Metropolis..."</p>

<p>In the long line of ancestors, the mainfold sediment of whom
had been crystalised into September, a fur-trader from
Tarnopolis must also have been represented and he now smiled out
from the corners of his great-grandson's wily eyes.</p>

<p>"Come in, sir!" the proprietor of Yoshiwara invited Slim,
with true Singalese gentleness.</p>

<p>Slim entered. September closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>In the moment when the matutinal roar of the great Metropolis
no longer bellowed up from the streets, another roar from inside
the building became perceptible&mdash;the roar of a human voice,
hotter than the voice of a beast of prey, mad-drunk with
triumph.</p>

<p>"Who is that?" asked Sum, involuntarily dropping his own
voice.</p>

<p>"He&mdash;!" answered September, and how he could stow the
smooth and pointed vengefulness of whole Corsica into the
monosyllable remained his own secret.</p>

<p>Slim's glance became uncertain, but he said nothing. He
followed September over soft and glossy straw mats, along walls
of oiled paper, narrowly framed in bamboo.</p>

<p>Behind one of these walls the weeping of a woman was to be
heard&mdash;monotonous, hopeless, heartbreaking, like a long
spell of rainy days which envelope the summit of Fuji Yama.</p>

<p>"That's Yuki," murmured September, with a fierce glance at
the paper prison of this pitiful weeping. "She's been crying
since midnight, as if she wanted to be the source of a new salt
sea...This evening she will have a swollen potato on her face
instead of a nose...Who pays for it?&mdash;I do!"</p>

<p>"Why is the little snowflake crying?" asked Slim, half
thoughtlessly, for the roaring of the human voice, coming from
the depths of the house occupied all the ears and attention he
possessed.</p>

<p>"Oh, she isn't the only one," answered September, with the
tolerant mien of one who owns a prosperous harbour tavern in
Shanghai. "But she is at least tame. Plum Blossom has been
snapping about her like a young Puma, and Miss Rainbow has
thrown the Saki bowl at the mirror and is trying to cut her
artery with the chips&mdash;and all on account of this white
silk youngster."</p>

<p>The agitated expression on Slim's face deepened. He shook his
head.</p>

<p>"How did he manage to get such a hold over them..." he said,
and it was not meant to be a question. September shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Maohee..." he said in a sing-song tone, as though beginning
one of those Greenland fairy tales, which, the quicker they sent
one to sleep are the more highly appreciated.</p>

<p>"What is that: Maohee?" asked Slim, irritably. September drew
his head down between his shoulders. The Irish and the British
blood-corpuscles in his veins seemed to be falling out,
violently: but the impenetrable Japanese smile covered this up
with its mantle before it could grow dangerous.</p>

<p>"You don't know what Maohee is...Not a soul in the great
Metropolis knows...No...Nobody. But here in Yoshiwara they all
know."</p>

<p>"I wish to know, too, September," said Slim. Generations of
Roman lackeys bowed within September as he said, "Certainly,
sir!" But they did not get the better of the wink of the
heavy-drinking lying grandfathers in Copenhagen. "Maohee, that
is...Isn't it odd, that, of all the ten thousand who have been
guests here in Yoshiwara and who had experienced in detail what
Maohee stands for, outside they know nothing more about it?
Don't walk so fast, sir. The yelling gentleman down there won't
run away from us&mdash;and if I am to explain to you what Maohee
means..."</p>

<p>"Drugs, I expect, September&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"My dear sir, the lion is also a cat. Maohee is a drug: but
what is a cat beside a lion? Maohee is from the other side of
the earth. It is the divine, the only thing&mdash;because it is
the only thing which makes us feel the intoxication of the
others."</p>

<p>"The intoxication&mdash;of the others...?" repeated Slim,
stopping still.</p>

<p>September smiled the smile of Hotei the god of Happiness, who
likes little children. He laid the hand of the Borgia, with the
suspiciously blue shimmering nails on Slim's arm.</p>

<p>"The intoxication of the others&mdash;Sir, do you know what
that means? Not of one other&mdash;no, of the multitude which
rolls itself into a lump, the rolled up intoxication of the
multitude gives Maohee its friends..."</p>

<p>"Has Maohee many friends, September?"</p>

<p>The proprietor of Yoshiwara grinned, apocalyptically.</p>

<p>"Sir, in this house there is a round room. You shall see it.
It has not its like. It is built like a winding seashell, like a
mammoth shell, in the windings of which thunders the surf of
seven oceans; in these windings people crouch, so densely
crowded that their faces appear as one face. No one knows the
other, yet they are all friends. They all fever. They are all
pale with expectation. They have all clasped hands. The
trembling of those who sit right down at the bottom of the shell
runs right through the windings of the mammoth shell, right up
to those, who, from the gleaming top of the spiral, send out
their own trembling towards it..."</p>

<p>September gulped for breath. Sweat stood like a fine chain of
beads on his brow. An international smile of insanity parted his
prating mouth.</p>

<p>"Go on, September!" said Slim.</p>

<p>"On?&mdash;On?&mdash;Suddenly the rim of the shell begins to
turn...gently...ah how gently, to music&mdash;such as would
bring a tenfold murderer-bandit to sobs and his judges to pardon
him on the scaffold&mdash;to music on hearing which deadly
enemies kiss, beggars believe themselves to be kings, the hungry
forget their hunger&mdash;to such music the shell revolves
around its stationary heart, until it seems to free itself from
the ground and, hovering, to revolve about itself. The people
scream&mdash;not loudly, no, no!&mdash;they scream like the
birds that bathe in the sea. The twisted hands are clenched to
fists. The bodies rock in one rhythm. Then comes the first
stammer of: Maohee...The stammer swells, becomes waves of spray,
becomes a spring tide. The revolving shell roars:
Maohee...Maohee...! It is as though a little flame must rest on
everyone's hair parting, like St. Elm's fire...Maohee...Maohee!
They call on their god. They call on him whom the finger of the
god touches today...No one knows from where he will come
today...He is there...They know he is amongst them...He must
break out from the rows of them...He must...He must, for they
call him: Maohee...Maohee! And suddenly&mdash;!"</p>

<p>The hand of the Borgia flew up and hung in the air like a
brown claw.</p>

<p>"And suddenly a man is standing in the middle of the shell,
in the gleaming circle, on the milk-white disc. But it is no
man. It is the embodied conception of the intoxication of them
all. He is not conscious of himself...A slight froth stands on
his mouth, His eyes are stark and bursting and are yet like
rushing meteors which leave waving tracks of fire behind them on
the route from heaven to earth...He stands and lives his
intoxication. He is what his intoxication is. From the thousands
of eyes which have cast anchor into his soul the power of
intoxication streams into him. There is no delight in God's
creation which does not reveal itself, surmounted by the medium
of these intoxicated souls. What he says becomes visible, what
he hears becomes audible to all. What he feels: Power, desire,
madness, is felt by them all. On the shimmering area, around
which the shell revolves, to music beyond all description, one
in ecstasy lives the thousandfold ecstasy which embodies itself
in him, for thousands of others..."</p>

<p>September stopped and smiled at Slim.</p>

<p>"That, sir, is Maohee..."</p>

<p>"It must indeed be a powerful drug," said Slim with a feeling
of dryness in his throat, "which inspires the proprietor of
Yoshiwara to such a hymn. Do you think that that yelling
individual down there would join in this song of praise?"</p>

<p>"Ask him yourself, sir," said September.</p>

<p>He opened the door and let Slim enter. Just over the
threshold Slim stopped, because at first he saw nothing. A
gloom, more melancholy that the deepest darkness, spread over a
room, the dimensions of which he could not estimate. The floor
under his feet inclined in a barely perceptible slope. Where it
stopped there appeared to be gloomy emptiness. Right and left,
spiral walls, billowing outwards, swept away to each side.</p>

<p>That was all Slim saw. But from the empty depths before him
came a white shimmer, no stronger than if coming from a field of
snow. On this shimmer there floated a voice, that of a murderer
and of one being murdered.</p>

<p>"Light, September!" said Slim with a gulp. An unbearable
feeling of thirst gnawed at his throat.</p>

<p>The room slowly grew brighter, as though the light were
coming unwillingly. Slim saw, he was standing in one of the
windings of the round room, which was shaped like a shell. He
was standing between the heights and the depths, separated by a
low banister from the emptiness from which came the
snow&mdash;Like light and the murderer's voice and the voice of
his victim. He stepped to the banister, and leaned far over it.
A milk-white disc, lighted from beneath and luminous. At the
edge of the disc, like a dark, rambling pattern on a plate-rim,
women, crouching, kneeling there, in their gorgeous attire, as
though drunken. Some had dropped their foreheads to the ground,
their hands clutched above their ebony hair. Some crouched,
huddled together in clumps, head pressed to head, symbols of
fear. Some were swaying rhythmically from side to side as if
calling on gods. Some were weeping. Some were as if dead.</p>

<p>But they all seemed to be the hand-maids of the man on the
snow-light illuminated disk.</p>

<p>The man wore the white silk woven for comparatively few in
Metropolis. He wore the soft shoes in which the beloved sons of
mighty fathers seemed to caress the earth. But the silk hung in
tatters about the body of the man and the shoes looked as though
the feet within them bled.</p>

<p>"Is that the man for whom you are looking, sir?" asked a
Levantine cousin from out September, leaning confidently towards
Slim's ear.</p>

<p>Slim did not answer. He was looking at the man.</p>

<p>"At least," continued September, "it is the youngster who
came here yesterday by the same car as you to-day. And the devil
take him for it! He has turned my revolving shell into the fore-court
of hell! He has been roasting souls! I have known Maohee&mdash;
drugged beings to have fancied themselves Kings, Gods, Fire, and
Storm&mdash;and to have forced others to feel themselves Kings,
Gods, Fire, and Storm. I have known those in the ecstasy of
desire to have forced women down to them from the highest part
of the shell's wall, that they, diving, like seagulls, with
outspread hands, have swooped to his feet, without injuring a limb,
while others have fallen to their death. That man there was no
God, no Storm, no Fire, and his drunkenness most certainly
inspired him with no desire. It seems to me that he had come up
from hell and is roaring in the intoxication of damnation. He
did not know that the ecstasy for men who are damned is also
damnation...The fool! The prayer he is praying will not redeem
him. He believes himself to be a machine and is praying to
himself. He has forced the others to pray to him. He has ground
them down. He has pounded them to a powder. There are many
dragging themselves around Metropolis to-day who cannot
comprehend why their limbs are as if broken..."</p>

<p>"Be quiet, September!" said Slim hoarsely. His hand flew to
his throat which felt like a glowing cork, like smouldering
charcoal.</p>

<p>September fell silent, shrugging his shoulders. Words seethed
up from the depths like lava.</p>

<p>"I am the Three-in-one&mdash;Lucifer&mdash;Belial&mdash;
Satan&mdash;! I am the everlasting Death! I am the everlasting
Noway! Come unto me&mdash;! In my hell there are many mansions!
I shall assign them to you! I am the great king of all the
damned&mdash;! I am a machine! I am the tower above you all!
I am a hammer, a fly-wheel, a fiery oven! I am a murderer and
of what I murder I make no use. I want victims and victims do
not appease me! Pray to me and know: I do not hear you! Shout
at me: Pater-noster! Know: I am deaf!"</p>

<p>Slim turned around; he saw September's face as a chalky mask
at his shoulder. Maybe that, among September's ancestresses
there was one who hailed from an isle in the South sea, where
gods mean little&mdash;spirits everything.</p>

<p>"That's no more a man," he whispered with ashen lips. "A man
would have died of it long ago...Do you see his arms, sir? Do
you think a man can imitate the pushing of a machine for hours
and hours at a time without its killing him? He is as dead as
stone. If you were to call to him he'd collapse and break to
pieces like a plaster statue."</p>

<p>It did not seem as though September's words had penetrated
into Slim's consciousness. His face wore an expression of
loathing and suffering and he spoke as one who speaks with
pain.</p>

<p>"I hope, September, that to-night you have had your last
opportunity of watching the effects of Maohee on your
guests..."</p>

<p>September smiled his Japanese smile.</p>

<p>He did not answer.</p>

<p>Slim stepped up to the banister at the edge of the curve of
the shell in which he stood. He bent down towards the milky
disc. He cried a high sharp tone which had the effect of a
whistle:</p>

<p>"Eleven thousand eight hundred and eleven&mdash;!"</p>

<p>The man on the shimmering disc swung around as though he had
received a blow in the side. The hellish rhythm of his arms
ceased, running itself out in vibration. The man fell to earth
like a log and did not move again.</p>

<p>Slim ran down the passage, reached the end and pushed asunder
the circle of women, who, stiffened with shock, seemed to be
thrown into deeper horror more by the end of that which they had
brought to pass than by the beginning. He knelt down beside the
man, looked him in the face and pushed the tattered silk away
from his heart. He did not give his hand time to test his pulse.
He lifted the man up and carried him out in his arms. The
sighing of the women soughed behind him like a dense,
mist-coloured curtain.</p>

<p>September stepped across his path. He swept aside as he
caught Slim's glance at him. He ran along by him, like an active
dog, breathing rapidly; but he said nothing.</p>

<p>Slim reached the door of Yoshiwara. September, himself,
opened it for him. Slim stepped into the street. The driver
pulled open the door of the taxi; he looked in amazement at the
man who hung in Slim's arms, in tatters of white silk with which
the wind was playing, and who was more awful to look on than a
corpse.</p>

<p>The proprietor of Yoshiwara bowed repeatedly while Slim was
climbing into the car. But Shin did not give him another glance.
September's face, which was as grey as steel, was reminiscent of
the blades of those ancient swords, forged of Indian steel, in
Shiras or Ispahan and on which, hidden by ornamentation, stand
mocking and deadly words.</p>

<p>The car glided away: September looked after it. He smiled the
peaceable smile of Eastern Asia.</p>

<p>For he knew perfectly well what Shin did not know, and what,
apart from him, nobody in Metropolis knew, that with the first
drop of water or wine which moistened the lips of a human being,
there disappeared even the very faintest memory of all which
appertained to the wonders of the drug, Maohee.</p>

<p>The car stopped before the next medical depot. Male nurses
came and carried away the bundle of humanity, shivering in
tatters of white silk, to the doctor on duty. Slim looked about
him. He beckoned to a policeman who was stationed near the
door.</p>

<p>"Take down a report," he said. His tongue would hardly obey
him, so parched was it with thirst.</p>

<p>The policeman entered the house after him.</p>

<p>"Wait!" said Slim, more with the movement of his head than in
words. He saw a glass jug of water standing on the table and the
coolness of the water had studded the jug with a thousand
pearls.</p>

<p>Sum drank like an animal which finds drink on coming from the
desert. He put down the jug and shivered. A short shudder passed
through him.</p>

<p>He turned around and saw the man he had brought with him
lying on a bed over which a young doctor was bending.</p>

<p>The lips of the sick man were moistened with wine. His eyes
stood wide open, staring up at the ceiling, tears upon tears
running gently and incessantly from the corners of his eyes,
down over his temples. It was as though they had nothing to do
with the man&mdash;as though they were trickling from a broken
vessel and could not stop trickling until the vessel had run
quite empty.</p>

<p>Slim looked the doctor in the face; the latter shrugged his
shoulders. Slim bent over the prostrate man.</p>

<p>"Georgi," he said in a low voice, "can you hear me?" The sick
man nodded; it was the shadow of a nod. "Do you know who I am?"
A second nod.</p>

<p>"Are you in a condition to answer two or three questions?"
Another nod.</p>

<p>"How did you get the white silk clothes?" For a long time he
received no answer apart from the gentle falling of the tear
drops. Then came the voice, softer than a whisper.</p>

<p>"...He changed with me..."</p>

<p>"Who did?"</p>

<p>"Freder...Joh Fredersen's son..."</p>

<p>"And then, Georgi?"</p>

<p>"He told me I was to wait for him..."</p>

<p>"Wait where, Georgi?" A long silence. And then, barely
audible: "Ninetieth Street. House seven. Seventh floor..." Slim
did not question him further. He knew who lived there. He looked
at the doctor; the latter's face wore a completely impenetrable
expression.</p>

<p>Slim drew a breath as though he were sighing. He said, more
deploringly than inquiringly:</p>

<p>"Why did you not rather go there, Georgi..." He turned to go
but stopped still as Georgi's voice came wavering after him;
"...The city...all the lights...more than enough money...It is
written...Forgive us our trespasses...lead us not into
temptation..."</p>

<p>His voice died away. His head fell to one side. He breathed
as though his soul wept, for his eyes could do so no longer. The
doctor cleared his throat cautiously. Slim raised his head as
though somebody had called him, then dropped it again.</p>

<p>"I shall come back again," he said softly. "He is to remain
under your care..."</p>

<p>Georgi was asleep.</p>

<p>Slim left the room, followed by the policeman.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" Slim asked with an absent-minded look at
him.</p>

<p>"The report, sir."</p>

<p>"What report?"</p>

<p>"I was to take down a report, sir."</p>

<p>Slim looked at the policeman very attentively, almost
meditatively. He raised his hand and rubbed it across his
forehead.</p>

<p>"A mistake," he said. "That was a mistake..."</p>

<p>The policeman saluted and retired, a little puzzled, for he
knew Slim.</p>

<p>He remained standing on the same spot. Again and again he
rubbed his forehead with the same helpless gesture.</p>

<p>Then he shook his head, stepped into the car and said:</p>

<p>"Ninetieth block...."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="first">"WHERE is Georgi?" asked Freder, his eyes
wandering through Josaphat's three rooms, which stretched out
before him&mdash;beautiful, with a rather bewildering
super-abundance of armchairs, divans and silk cushions, with
curtains which goldenly obscured the light.</p>

<p>"Who?" asked Josaphat, listlessly. He had waited, had not
slept and his eyes stood excessively large in his thin, almost
white face. His gaze, which he did not take from Freder, was
like hands which are raised adoringly.</p>

<p>"Georgi," repeated Freder. He smiled happily with his tired
mouth.</p>

<p>"Who is that?" asked Josaphat.</p>

<p>"I sent him to you."</p>

<p>"Nobody has come."</p>

<p>Freder looked at him without answering.</p>

<p>"I sat all night in this chair," continued Josaphat,
misinterpreting Freder's silence. "I did not sleep a wink. I
expected you to come at any second, or a messenger to come from
you, or that you would ring me up. I also informed the watchman.
Nobody has come, Mr. Freder."</p>

<p>Freder still remained silent. Slowly, almost stumblingly he
stepped over the threshold, into the room raising his right hand
to his head, as though to take off his hat, then noticing that
he was wearing the cap, the black cap, which pressed the hair
tightly down, he swept it from his head; it fell to the ground.
His hand sank from his brow, over his eyes, resting there a
little while. Then the other joined it, as though wishing to
console its sister. His form was like that of a young birch tree
pressed sideways by a strong wind.</p>

<p>Josaphat's eyes hung on the uniform which Freder wore.</p>

<p>"Mr. Freder," he began cautiously, "how comes it that you are
wearing these clothes?"</p>

<p>Freder remained turned away from him. He took his hands from
his eyes and pressed them to his face as though he felt some
pain there.</p>

<p>"Georgi wore them..." He answered. "I gave him mine..."</p>

<p>"Then Georgi is a workman?"</p>

<p>"Yes...I found him before the Pater-noster machine. I took
his place and sent him to you..."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he'll come yet," answered Josaphat.</p>

<p>Freder shook his head.</p>

<p>"He should have been here hours ago. If he had been caught
when leaving the New Tower of Babel, then someone would have
come to me when I was standing before the machine. It is
strange, but there it is; he has not come."</p>

<p>"Was there much money in the suit which you exchanged with
Georgi?" asked Josaphat tentatively, as one who bares a wounded
spot.</p>

<p>Freder nodded.</p>

<p>"Then you must not be surprised that Georgi has not come,"
said Josaphat. But the expression of shame and pain on Freder's
face prevented him from continuing.</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down, Mr. Freder," he begged. "Or lie down?
You look so tired that it is painful to look at you."</p>

<p>"I have no time to sit down and not time to lie down,
either," answered Freder. He walked through the rooms,
aimlessly, senselessly, stopping wherever a chair, a table,
offered him a hold. "The fact, is this, Josaphat: I told Georgi
to come here and to wait here for me&mdash;or for a message from
me...It is a thousand to one that Slim, in searching for me, is
already on Georgi's track, and it's a thousand to one he gets
out of him where I sent him..."</p>

<p>"And you do not want Slim to find you?"</p>

<p>"He must not find me, Josaphat&mdash;not for anything on
earth..."</p>

<p>The other stood silent, rather helpless. Freder looked at him
with a trembling smile.</p>

<p>"How shall we obtain money, now, Josaphat?"</p>

<p>"That should offer no difficulty to Joh Fredersen's son."</p>

<p>"More than you think, Josaphat, for I am no longer Joh
Fredersen's son..."</p>

<p>Josaphat raised his head.</p>

<p>"I do not understand you," he said, after a pause.</p>

<p>"There is nothing to misunderstand, Josaphat. I have set
myself free from my father, and am going my own way..."</p>

<p>The man who had been the first secretary to the Master over
the great Metropolis held his breath back in his lungs, then
released it in streams.</p>

<p>"Will you let me tell you something, Mr. Freder?"</p>

<p>"Well..."</p>

<p>"One does not set oneself free from your father. It is he who
decides whether one remains with him or must leave him.</p>

<p>"There is nobody who is stronger than Joh Fredersen. He is
like the earth. As regards the earth we have no will either. Her
laws keep us eternally perpendicular to the centre of the earth,
even if we stand on our head...When Joh Fredersen sets a man
free it means just as much as if the earth were to shut off from
a man her powers of attraction. It means falling into
nothing...Joh Fredersen can set free whom he may; he will never
set free his son..."</p>

<p>"But what," answered Freder, speaking feverishly, "if a man
overcomes the laws of nature?"</p>

<p>"Utopia, Mr. Freder."</p>

<p>"For the inventive spirit of man there is no Utopia: there is
only a Not-yet. I have made up my mind to venture the path. I
must take it&mdash;yes, I must take it! I do not know the way
yet, but I shall find it because I must find it..."</p>

<p>"Wherever you wish, Mr. Freder&mdash;! shall go with
you..."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Freder, reaching out his hand. He felt it
seized and clasped in a vice&mdash;Like grip.</p>

<p>"You know, Mr. Freder, don't you&mdash;" said the strangled
voice of Josaphat, "that everything belongs to
you&mdash;everything that I am and have...It is not much, for I
have lived like a madman...But for to-day, and to-morrow and the
day after to-morrow..."</p>

<p>Freder shook his head without losing hold of Josaphat's
hand.</p>

<p>"No, no!" he said, a torrent of red flowing over his face.
"One does not begin new ways like that...We must try to find
other ways...It will not be easy. Slim knows his business."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Slim could be won over to you...." said Josaphat,
hesitatingly. "For&mdash;strange though it may sound, he loves
you..."</p>

<p>"Slim loves all his victims. Which does not prevent him, as
the most considerate and kindly of executioners, from laying
them before my father's feet. He is the born tool, but the tool
of the strongest. He would never make himself the tool of the
weaker one, for he would thus humiliate himself. And you have
jus t told me, Josaphat, how much stronger my father is than
I..."</p>

<p>"If you were to confide yourself to one of your
friends..."</p>

<p>"I have no friends, Josaphat."</p>

<p>Josaphat wanted to contradict, but he stopped himself. Freder
turned his eyes towards him. He straightened himself up and
smiled&mdash;the other's hand still in his.</p>

<p>"I have no friends, Josaphat, and, what weighs still more, I
have no friend. I had play-fellows&mdash;sport-fellows&mdash;but
friends? A friend? No, Josaphat! Can one confide oneself to
somebody of whom one knows nothing but how his laughter
sounds?"</p>

<p>He saw the eyes of the other fixed upon him, discerned the
ardour in them and the pain and the truth.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said with a worried smile. "I should like to
confide myself to you...I must confide myself to you,
Josaphat...I must call you 'Friend' and 'Brother'...for I need a
man who will go with me in trust and confidence to the world's
end. Will you be that man?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;?" He came to him and laid his hands upon his
shoulders. He looked closely into his face. He shook him. "You
say: 'Yes&mdash;!' Do you know what that means&mdash;for you and
for me? What a last plummet-drop that is&mdash;what a last
anchorage? I hardly know you&mdash;! I wanted to help you&mdash;!
I cannot even help you now, because I am poorer now than you
are&mdash;but,
perhaps, that is all to the good...Joh Fredersen's son can,
perhaps, be betrayed&mdash;but I, Josaphat? A man who has
nothing but a will and an object? It cannot be worth while to
betray him&mdash;eh, Josaphat?"</p>

<p>"May God kill me as one kills a mangy dog..."</p>

<p>"That's all right, that's all right..." Freder's smile came
back again and stood, clear and beautiful in his tired face. "I
am going now, Josaphat. I want to go to my father's mother, to
take her something which is very sacred to me...I shall be here
again before evening. Shall I find you here then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Freder, most certainly!"</p>

<p>They stretched out their hands towards each other. Hand held
hand, gripped. They looked at each other. Glance held glance,
gripped. Then they loosened their grip in silence and Freder
went.</p>

<p>A little while later (Josaphat was still standing on the same
spot on which Freder had left him) there came a knock at the
door.</p>

<p>Though the knocking was as gentle, as modest, as the knocking
of one who has come to beg, there was something in it which
chased a shiver down Josaphat's spine. He stood still, gazing at
the door, incapable of calling out "Come in," or of opening it
himself.</p>

<p>The knocking was repeated, becoming not in the least louder.
It came for the third time and was still as gentle. But just
that deepened the impression that it was inescapable, that it
would be quite pointless to play deaf permanently.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" asked Josaphat hoarsely. He knew very well
who was standing outside. He only asked to gain time&mdash;to draw
breath, which he badly needed. He expected no answer; neither
did he receive one.</p>

<p>The door opened. In the doorway stood Slim.</p>

<p>They did not greet each other; neither greeted the other.
Josaphat: because his gullet was too dry: Slim: because his
all-observing eye had darted through the room in the second in which
he put his foot on the threshold, and had found something: a
black cap, lying on the floor.</p>

<p>Josaphat followed Slim's gaze with his eyes. He did not stir.
With silent step Slim went up to the cap, stooped and picked it
up. He twisted it gently this way and that, he twisted it inside
out.</p>

<p>In the sweat-sodden lining of the cap stood the number,
11811.</p>

<p>Slim weighed the cap in almost affectionate hands, He fixed
his eyes, which were as though veiled with weariness on Josaphat
and asked, speaking in a low voice:</p>

<p>"Where is Freder, Josaphat?"</p>

<p>"I do not know..."</p>

<p>Slim smiled sleepily. He fondled the black cap. Josaphat's
hoarse voice continued:</p>

<p>"...But if I did know you would not get it out of me,
anyway..."</p>

<p>Slim looked at Josaphat, still smiling, still fondling the
black cap.</p>

<p>"You are quite right," said he courteously. "I beg your
pardon! It was an idle question. Of course you will not tell me
where Mr. Freder is. Neither is it at all necessary...It is
quite another matter..."</p>

<p>He pocketed the cap, having carefully rolled it up, and
looked around the room. He went up to an armchair, standing near
a low, black, polished table.</p>

<p>"You permit me?" he asked courteously, seating himself.</p>

<p>Josaphat made a movement of the head, but the "Please do so,"
dried up in his throat. He did not stir from the one spot.</p>

<p>"You live very well here," said Slim, leaning back and
surveying the room with a sweeping movement of his head.
"Everything of a soft, half-dark tone. The atmosphere about
these cushions is a tepid perfume. I can well understand how
difficult it will be for you to leave this flat."</p>

<p>"I have no such intention, however," said Josaphat. He
swallowed.</p>

<p>Slim pressed his eyelids together, as though he wished to
sleep.</p>

<p>"No...Not yet...But very soon..."</p>

<p>"I should not think of it," answered Josaphat. His eyes grew
red, and he looked at Slim, hatred smouldering in his gaze.</p>

<p>"No...Not yet...But very soon..."</p>

<p>Josaphat stood quite still: but suddenly he smote the air
with his fist, as though beating against an invisible door.</p>

<p>"What do you want exactly?" he asked pantingly. "What is that
supposed to imply? What do you want from me&mdash;?"</p>

<p>It appeared at first as though Slim had not heard the
question. Sleepily, with closed eyelids, he sat there, breathing
inaudibly. But, as the leather of the chairback squeaked under
Josaphat's grasp, Slim said, very slowly, but very clearly:</p>

<p>"I want you to tell me for what sum you will give up this
flat, Josaphat."</p>

<p>"...When?..."</p>

<p>"Immediately."</p>

<p>"...What is that supposed to mean...Immediately?..."</p>

<p>Slim opened his eyes, and they were as cold and bright as a
pebble in a brook.</p>

<p>"Immediately means within an hour...Immediately means long
before this evening..."</p>

<p>A shiver ran down Josaphat's back. The hands on his hanging
arms slowly clenched themselves into fists.</p>

<p>"Get out, sir..." he said quietly. "Get out of here&mdash;!
Now&mdash;! At once&mdash;! Immediately!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The flat is very pretty," said Slim. "You are unwilling to
give it up. It is of value to one who knows how to appreciate
such things. You will not have time to pack any large trunks,
either. You can only take what you need for twenty-four hours.
The journey&mdash;new outfit&mdash;a year's expenses&mdash;all
this is to be added to the sum: what is the price of your flat,
Josaphat?"</p>

<p>"I shall chuck you into the street," stammered Josaphat with
feverish mouth. "I shall chuck you seven stories down into the
street&mdash;through the window, my good sir!&mdash;through the
closed window&mdash;If you don't get out this very second!"</p>

<p>"You love a woman. The woman does not love you. Women who are
not in love are very expensive. You want to buy this woman. Very
well. The threefold cost of the flat...Life on the Adriatic
coast&mdash;In Rome&mdash;on Teneriffe&mdash;on a splendid
steamer around the world with a woman who wants to be bought
anew every day&mdash;comprehensible, Josaphat, that the flat
will be expensive...but to tell you the truth, I must have it,
so I must pay for it."</p>

<p>He plunged his hands into his pocket and drew out a wad of
banknotes. He pushed it across to Josaphat over the black,
polished mirror&mdash;Like table. Josaphat clutched at it,
leaving his nail marks behind on the table-top and threw it into
Shin's face. He caught it with a nimble, thought-swift movement,
and gently laid it back on the table. He laid a second one
beside it.</p>

<p>"Is that enough?" he asked sleepily.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;!" shouted Josaphat's laughter.</p>

<p>"Sensible!" said Slim. "Very sensible. Why should you not
make full use of your advantages. An opportunity like this, to
raise your whole life by one hundred rungs, to become independant,
happy, free, the fulfilment of every wish, the
satisfaction of every whim&mdash;to have your own, and a
beautiful woman before you, will come only once in your life and
never again. Seize it, Josaphat, if you are not a fool! In
strict confidence: The beautiful woman of whom we spoke just now
has already been informed and is awaiting you near the aeroplane
which is standing ready for the journey...Three times the price,
Josaphat, if you do not keep the beautiful woman waiting!"</p>

<p>He laid the third bundle of banknotes on the table. He looked
at Josaphat. Josaphat's reddened eyes devoured his. Josaphat's
hands fumbled across blindly and seized the three brown wads.
His teeth showed white under his lips; while his fingers tore
the notes to shreds, they seemed to be biting them to death.</p>

<p>Slim shook his head. "That's of no account," he said
undisturbedly. "I have a cheque-book here, some of the blank
leaves of which bear the signature, Joh Fredersen. Let us write
a sum on the first leaf&mdash;a sum the double of the amount
agreed upon up to now...Well, Josaphat?"</p>

<p>"I will not&mdash;!" said the other, shaken from head to
foot.</p>

<p>Slim smiled.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "Not yet...But very soon..."</p>

<p>Josaphat did not answer. He was staring at the piece of
paper, white, printed and written on, which lay before him on
the blue-black table. He did not see the figure upon it. He only
saw the name upon it:</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen.</p>

<p>The signature, as though written with the blade of an
axe:</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen.</p>

<p>Josaphat turned his head this way and that as though he felt
the blade of the axe at his neck.</p>

<p>"No," he croaked. "No, no, no...!"</p>

<p>"Not enough yet?" asked Slim.</p>

<p>"Yes!" said he in a mutter. "Yes! It is enough."</p>

<p>Slim got up. Something which he had drawn from his pocket
with the bundles of banknotes, without his having noticed it,
slid down from his knees.</p>

<p>It was a black cap, such as the workmen in Joh Fredersen's
works used to wear...</p>

<p>A howl escaped Josaphat's lips. He threw himself down on both
knees. He seized the black cap in both hands. He snatched it to
his mouth. He stared at Slim. He jerked himself up. He sprang,
like a stag before the pack, to gain the door.</p>

<p>But Slim got there before him. With a mighty leap he sprang
across table and divan, rebounded against the door and stood
before Josaphat. For the fraction of a second they stared each
other in the face. Then Josaphat's hands flew to Slim's throat.
Slim lowered his head. He threw forward his arms, like the
grabbing arms of the octopus. They held each other, tightly
clasped, and wrestled together, burning and ice-cold, raving and
reflecting, teeth-grinding and silent, breast to breast.</p>

<p>They tore themselves apart and dashed at each other. They
fell, and, wrestling, rolled along the floor. Josaphat forced
his opponent beneath him. Fighting, they pushed each other up.
They stumbled and rolled over armchairs and divans. The
beautiful room, turned into a wilderness, seemed to be too small
for the two twisted bodies, which jerked like fishes, stamped
like steers, struck at each other like fighting bears.</p>

<p>But against Slim's unshakeable, dreadful coldness the white-hot
fury of his opponent could not stand its ground. Suddenly,
as though his knee joints had been hacked through, Josaphat
collapsed in Slim's hands, fell on his knees and remained there,
his back resting against an over-turned armchair, staring up
with glassy eyes.</p>

<p>Slim loosened his hold. He looked down at him.</p>

<p>"Had enough yet?" he asked, and smiled sleepily.</p>

<p>Josaphat did not answer. He moved his right hand. In all the
fury of the fight he had not lost hold of the black cap which
Freder had worn when he came to him.</p>

<p>He raised the cap painfully on to his knees, as though it
weighed a hundredweight. He twisted it between his fingers. He
fondled it...</p>

<p>"Come, Josaphat, get up!" said Slim. He spoke very gravely
and gently and a little sadly. "May I help you? Give me your
hands! No, no. I shall not take the cap away from you...I am
afraid I was obliged to hurt you very much. It was no pleasure.
But you forced me into it."</p>

<p>He left go of the man, who was now standing upright, and he
looked around him with a gloomy smile.</p>

<p>"A good thing we settled the price beforehand," he said. "Now
the flat would be considerably cheaper."</p>

<p>He sighed a little and looked at Josaphat.</p>

<p>"When will you be ready to go?"</p>

<p>"Now," said Josaphat.</p>

<p>"You will not take anything with you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You will go just as you are&mdash;with all the marks of the
struggle, all tattered and torn?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Is that courteous to the lady who is waiting for you?"</p>

<p>Sight returned to Josaphat's eyes. He turned a reddened gaze
towards Slim.</p>

<p>"If you do not want me to commit the murder on the woman
which did not succeed on you&mdash;then send her away before I
come..."</p>

<p>Slim was silent. He turned to go. He took the cheque, folded
it together and put it into Josaphat's pocket.</p>

<p>Josaphat offered no resistance.</p>

<p>He walked before Slim towards the door. Then he stopped again
and looked around.</p>

<p>He waved the cap which Freder had worn, in farewell to the
room, and burst out into ceaseless laughter. He struck his
shoulder against the door post...</p>

<p>Then he went out. Slim followed him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="first">FREDER walked UP the steps of the cathedral
hesitatingly; he was walking up them for the first time. Hel,
his mother, used often to go to the cathedral. But her son had
never yet done so. Now he longed to see it with his mother's
eyes and to hear with the ears of Hel, his mother, the stony
prayer of the pillars, each of which had its own particular
voice.</p>

<p>He entered the cathedral as a child, not pious, yet not
entirely free from shyness&mdash;prepared for reverence, but
fearless. He heard, as Hel, his mother the Kyrie Eleison of the
stones and the Te Deum Laudamus&mdash;the De Profundis and the
Jubilate. And he heard, as his mother, how the powerfully
ringing stone chair was crowned by the Amen of the cross
vault...</p>

<p>He looked for Maria, who was to have waited for him on the
belfry steps; but he could not find her. He wandered through the
cathedral, which seemed to be quite empty of people. Once he
stopped. He was standing opposite Death.</p>

<p>The ghostly minstrel stood in a side-niche, carved in wood,
in hat and wide cloak, scythe on shoulder, the hour-glass
dangling from his girdle; and the minstrel was playing on a bone
as though on a flute. The Seven Deadly Sins were his
following.</p>

<p>Freder looked Death in the face. Then he said:</p>

<p>"If you had come earlier you would not have frightened
me...Now I pray you: Keep away from me and my beloved!"</p>

<p>But the awful flute-player seemed to be listening to nothing
but the song he was playing upon a bone.</p>

<p>Freder walked on. He came to the central nave. Before the
high altar, over which hovered God Incarnate, a dark form lay
stretched out upon the stones, hands clutching out to each side,
face pressed into the coldness of the stone, as though the
blocks must burst asunder under the pressure of the brow. The
form wore the garment of a monk, the head was shaven. An
incessant trembling shook the lean body from shoulder to heel,
and it seemed to be stiffened as though in a cramp.</p>

<p>But suddenly the body reared up. A white flame sprang up: a
face; black flames within it: two blazing eyes. A hand rose up,
clutching high in the air towards the crucifix which hovered
above the altar.</p>

<p>A voice spoke, like the voice of fire:</p>

<p>"I will not let thee go, God, God, except thou bless me!"</p>

<p>The echo of the pillars yelled the words after him. \</p>

<p>The son of Joh Fredersen had never seen the man before. He
knew, however, as soon as the flame-white face unveiled the
black flames of its eyes to him: it was Desertus the monk, his
father's enemy...</p>

<p>Perhaps his breath had become too loud. Suddenly the black
flame struck across at him. The monk arose slowly. He did not
say a word. He stretched out his hand. The hand indicated the
door.</p>

<p>"Why do you sent me away, Desertus?" asked Freder. "Is not
the house of your God open to all?"</p>

<p>"Hast thou come here to seek God?" asked the rough, hoarse
voice of the monk.</p>

<p>Freder hesitated. He dropped his head.</p>

<p>"No." He answered. But his heart knew better.</p>

<p>"If thou hast not come to seek God, then thou hast nothing to
seek here," said the monk.</p>

<p>Then Joh Fredersen's son went.</p>

<p>He went out of the cathedral as one walking in his sleep. The
daylight smote his eyes cruelly. Racked with weariness, worn out
with grief, he walked down the steps, and aimlessly onwards.</p>

<p>The roar of the streets wrapped itself, as a diver's helmet,
about his ears. He walked on in his stupefaction, as though
between thick glass walls. He had no thought apart from the name
of his beloved, no consciousness apart from his longing for her.
Shivering with weariness, he thought of the girl's eyes and
lips, with a feeling very like homesickness.</p>

<p>Ah!&mdash;brow to brow with her&mdash;then mouth to
mouth&mdash;eyes closed&mdash;breathing....</p>

<p>Peace...Peace...</p>

<p>"Come," said his heart. "Why do you leave me alone?"</p>

<p>He walked along in a stream of people, fighting down the mad
desire to stop amid this stream and to ask every single wave,
which was a human being, if it knew of Maria's whereabouts, and
why she had let him wait in vain.</p>

<p>He came to the magician's house. There he stopped.</p>

<p>He stared at a window.</p>

<p>Was he mad?</p>

<p>There was Maria, standing behind the dull panes. Those were
her blessed hands, stretched out towards him...a dumb cry: "Help
me&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Then the entire vision was drawn away, swallowed up by the
blackness of the room behind it, vanishing, not leaving a trace,
as though it had never been. Dumb, dead and evil stood the house
of the magician there.</p>

<p>Freder stood motionless. He drew a deep, deep breath. Then he
made a leap. He stood before the door of the house. Copper-red,
in the black wood of the door, glowed the seal of Solomon, the
pentagram.</p>

<p>Freder knocked.</p>

<p>Nothing in the house stirred.</p>

<p>He knocked for the second time.</p>

<p>The house remained dull and obstinate.</p>

<p>He stepped back and looked up at the windows.</p>

<p>They looked out in their evil gloom, over and beyond him.</p>

<p>He went to the door again. He beat against it with his fists.
He heard the echo of his drumming blows shake the house, as in
dull laughter.</p>

<p>But the copper Solomon's seal grinned at him from the
unshaken door.</p>

<p>He stood still for a moment. His temples throbbed. He felt
absolutely helpless and was as near crying as swearing.</p>

<p>Then he heard a voice&mdash;the voice of his beloved.</p>

<p>"Freder&mdash;!" and once more: "Freder&mdash;!"</p>

<p>He saw blood before his eyes. He made to throw himself with
the full weight of his shoulders against the door...</p>

<p>But in that same moment the door opened noiselessly. It swung
back in ghostly silence, leaving the way into the house
absolutely free.</p>

<p>That was so unexpected and alarming that, in the midst of the
swing which was to have thrown him against the door, Freder
caught both his hands against the door-posts, and stood fixed
there. He buried his teeth in his lips. The heart of the house
was as black as midnight...</p>

<p>But the voice of Maria called to him from the heart of the
house: "Freder&mdash;! Freder&mdash;!"</p>

<p>He ran into the house as though he had gone blind. The door
fell to behind him. He stood in blackness. He called. He
received no answer. He saw nothing. He groped. He felt
walls&mdash;endless walls...Steps...He climbed up the steps...</p>

<p>A pale redness swam about him like the reflection of a
distant gloomy fire.</p>

<p>Suddenly&mdash;he stopped still, clawing his hand into the
stonework behind him&mdash;a sound was coming out of the
nothingness: The weeping of a woman sorrowing, sorrowing unto
death.</p>

<p>It was not very loud, but yet it was as if the source of all
lamentation were streaming out of it. It was as though the house
were weeping&mdash;as though every stone in the wall were a
sobbing mouth, set free from eternal dumbness, once and once
only, to mourn an everlasting agony.</p>

<p>Freder shouted&mdash;he was fully aware that he was only
shouting in order not to hear the weeping any more.</p>

<p>"Maria&mdash;Maria&mdash;Maria&mdash;!"</p>

<p>His voice was clear and wild as an oath: "I am coming!"</p>

<p>He ran up the stairs. He reached the top of the stairs. A
passage, scarcely lighted. Twelve doors opened out here.</p>

<p>In the wood of each of these doors glowed, copper-red, the
seal of Solomon, the pentagram.</p>

<p>He sprang to the first one. Before he had touched it it swung
noiselessly open before him. Emptiness lay behind it. The room
was quite bare.</p>

<p>The second door. The same.</p>

<p>The third. The fourth. They swung open before him as though
his breath had blown them off the latch.</p>

<p>Freder stood still. He screwed his head down between his
shoulders. He raised his arm and wiped it across his forehead.
He looked around him. The open doors stood agape. The mournful
weeping ceased. All was quite silent.</p>

<p>But out of the silence there came a voice, soft and sweet,
and more tender than a kiss...</p>

<p>"Come...I Do come...! I am here, dearest...!"</p>

<p>Freder did not stir. He knew the voice quite well. It was
Maria's voice, which he so loved. And yet it was a strange
voice. Nothing in the world could be sweeter than the tone of
this soft allurement&mdash;and nothing in the world has ever
been so filled to overflowing with a dark, deadly
wickedness.</p>

<p>Freder felt the drops upon his forehead.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he asked expressionlessly.</p>

<p>"Don't you know me?"</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"....Maria...."</p>

<p>"You are not Maria..."</p>

<p>"Freder&mdash;I," mourned the voice&mdash;Maria's voice.</p>

<p>"Do you want me to lose my reason?" said Freder, between his
teeth. "Why don't you come to me?"</p>

<p>"I can't come, beloved..."</p>

<p>"Where are you?"</p>

<p>"Look for me!" said the sweetly alluring, the deadly wicked
voice, laughing softly.</p>

<p>But through the laughter there sounded another voice-being
also Maria's voice, sick with fear and horror.</p>

<p>"Freder...help me, Freder...I do not know what is being done
to me...But what is being done is worse than murder...My eyes
are on..."</p>

<p>Suddenly, as though cut off, her voice choked. But the other
voice&mdash;which was also Maria's voice, laughed, sweetly,
alluringly, on:</p>

<p>"Look for me, beloved!"</p>

<p>Freder began to run. Senselessly and unreasoningly, he began
to run. Along walls, by open doors, upstairs, downstairs, from
twilight into darkness, drawn on by the cones of light, which
would suddenly flame up before him, then dazzled and plunged
again into a hellish darkness.</p>

<p>He ran like a blind animal, groaning aloud. He found that he
was running in a circle, always upon his own tracks, but he
could not get free of it, could not get out of the cursed
circle. He ran in the purple mist of his own blood, which filled
his eyes and ears, heard the breaker of his blood dash against
his brain, heard high above, like the singing of birds, the
sweetly, deadly wicked laugh of Maria...</p>

<p>"Look for me, beloved!...I am here!...I am here!..."</p>

<p>At last he fell. His knees collided against something which
was in the way of their blindness; he stumbled and fell. He felt
stones under his hands, cool, hard stones, cut in even squares.
His whole body, beaten and racked, rested upon the cool hardness
of these blocks. He rolled over on his back. He pushed himself
up, collapsed again violently, and lay upon the floor. A
suffocating blanket sank downwards. His consciousness yielded
up, as though drowned...</p>

<p>Rotwang had seen him fall. He waited attentively and
vigilantly to see if this young wildling, the son of Joh
Fredersen and Hel, had had enough at last, or if he would pull
himself together once more for the fight against nothing.</p>

<p>But it appeared that he had had enough. He lay remarkably
still. He was not even breathing now. He was like a corpse.</p>

<p>The great inventor left his listening post. He passed through
the dark house on soundless soles. He opened a door and entered
a room. He closed the door and remained standing on the
threshold. With an expectation that was fully aware of its
pointlessness, he looked at the girl who was the occupant of the
room.</p>

<p>He found her as he always found her. In the farthest corner
of the room, on a high, narrow chair, hands laid, right and
left, upon the arms of the chair, sitting stiffly upright, with
eyes which appeared to be lidless. Nothing about her was living
apart from these eyes. The glorious mouth, still glorious in its
pallor, seemed to enclose within it the unpronounceable. She did
not look at the man&mdash;she looked over and beyond him.</p>

<p>Rotwang stooped forward. He came nearer to her. Only his
hands, his lonely hands groped through the air, as though they
wanted to close around Maria's countenance. His eyes, his lonely
eyes, enveloped Maria's countenance.</p>

<p>"Won't you smile just once?" he asked. "Won't you cry just
once? I need them both&mdash;your smile and your tears...Your
image, Maria, just as you are now, is burnt into my retina,
never to be lost...I could take a diploma in your horror and in
your rigidity. The bitter expression of contempt about your
mouth is every bit as familiar to me as the haughtiness of your
eyebrows and your temples. But I need your smile and your tears,
Maria. Or you will make me bungle my work..."</p>

<p>He seemed to have spoken to the deaf air. The girl sat dumb,
looking over and beyond him.</p>

<p>Rotwang took a chair; he sat down astride it, crossed his
arms over the back and looked at the girl. He laughed
gloomily.</p>

<p>"You two poor children!" he said, "to have dared to pit
yourselves against Joh Fredersen! Nobody can reproach you for
it; you do not know him and do not know what you are doing. But
the son should know the father. I do not believe that there is
one man who can boast ever having got the better of Joh
Fredersen: You could more easily bend to your I will the
inscrutable God, who is said to rule the world, than Joh
Fredersen..."</p>

<p>The girl sat like a statue, immovable.</p>

<p>"What will you do, Maria, if Joh Fredersen takes you and,
your love so seriously that he comes to you and says: Give me
back my son!"</p>

<p>The girl sat like a statue, immovable.</p>

<p>"He will ask you: 'Of what value is my son to you?' and if
you are wise you will answer him: 'Of no more and of no less
value than he is to you!...' He will pay the price, and it will
be a high price, for Joh Fredersen has only one son..."</p>

<p>The girl sat like a statue, immovable.</p>

<p>"What do you know of Freder's heart?" continued the man. "He
is as young as the morning at sunrise. This heart of the young
morning is yours. Where will it be at midday? And where at
evening? Far away from you, Maria&mdash;far, far, away. The
world is very large and the earth is very fair...His father will
send him around the world. Out over the beautiful earth he will
forget you, Maria, before the clock of his heart is at
midday."</p>

<p>The girl sat like a statue, immovable. But around her pale
mouth, which was like the bud of a snowrose, a smile began to
bloom&mdash;a smile of such sweetness, of such depths, that it
seemed as though the air about the girl must begin to beam.</p>

<p>The man looked at the girl. His lonely eyes were starved and
parched as the desert which does not know the dew. In a hoarse
voice he went on:</p>

<p>"Where do you get your sainted confidence from? Do you
believe that you are Freder's first love? Have you forgotten the
'Club of the Sons,' Maria? There are a hundred women
there&mdash;and all are his! These loving little women could all
tell you about Freder's love, for they know more about it than
you do, and you have only one advantage over them: You can weep
when he leaves you; for they are not allowed to weep...When Joh
Fredersen's son celebrates his marriage it will be as though all
Metropolis celebrated its marriage. When?&mdash;Joh Fredersen
will decide that...With whom?&mdash;Joh Fredersen will decide
that...But you will not be the bride, Maria! The son of Joh
Fredersen will have forgotten you by the day of his
wedding."</p>

<p>"Never!" said the girl. "Never&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>And the painless tears of a great, true love fell upon the
beauty of her smile.</p>

<p>The man got up. He stood still before the girl. He looked at
her. He turned away. As he was crossing the threshold of the
next room his shoulder fell against the door-post.</p>

<p>He slammed the door to. He stared straight ahead. He looked
on the being&mdash;his creature of glass and metal&mdash;which
bore the almost completed head of Maria.</p>

<p>His hands moved towards the head, and, the nearer they came
to it, the more did it appear as if these hands, these lonely
hands, wished not to create but to destroy.</p>

<p>"We are bunglers, Futura!" he said.
"Bunglers!&mdash;Bunglers! Can I give you the smile which you
make angels fall gladly down to hell? Can I give you the tears
which would redeem the chiefest Satan, and make him
beatify?&mdash;Parody is your name! And Bungler is mine!"</p>

<p>Shining cool and lustrous, the being stood there and looked
at its creator with its bafflng eyes. And, as he laid his hands
on its shoulders, its fine structure tinkled in mysterious
laughter...</p>

<p>Freder, on recovering, found himself surrounded by a dull
brightness. It came from a window, in the frame of which stood a
pale, grey sky. The window was small and gave the impression
that it had not been opened for centuries.</p>

<p>Freder's eyes wandered through the room. Nothing that he saw
penetrated into his consciousness. He remembered nothing. He
lay, his back resting on stones which were cold and smooth. All
his limbs and joints were wracked by a dull pain.</p>

<p>He turned his head to one side. He looked at his hands which
lay beside him as though not belonging to him, thrown away, bled
white.</p>

<p>Knuckles knocked raw...shreds of skin...brownish
crusts...were these his hands?</p>

<p>He stared at the ceiling. It was black, as if charred. He
stared at the walls; grey, cold walls...</p>

<p>Where was he&mdash;? He was tortured by thirst and a ravenous
hunger. But worse than the hunger and thirst was the weariness
which longed for sleep and which could not find it.</p>

<p>Maria occurred to him...</p>

<p>Maria?...Maria&mdash;?</p>

<p>He jerked himself up and stood on sawn-through ankles. His
eyes sought for doors: There was one door. He stumbled up to it.
The door was closed, was latchless, would not open.</p>

<p>His brain commanded him: Don't be surprised at
anything...Don't let anything startle you...Think...</p>

<p>Over there, there was a window. It had no frame. It was a
pane of glass set into stone. The street lay before it&mdash;one
of the great streets of the great Metropolis, seething with
human beings.</p>

<p>The glass window-pane must be very thick. Not the least sound
entered the room in which Freder was captive, though the street
was so near.</p>

<p>Freder's hands fumbled across the pane. A penetrating
coldness streamed out of the glass, the smoothness of which was
reminiscent of the sucking sharpness of a steel blade. Freder's
finger tips glided towards the setting of the pane...and
remained, crooked, hanging in the air, as though bewitched. He
saw: Down there, below, Maria was crossing the street...</p>

<p>Leaving the house which held him captive, she turned her back
on him and walked with light, hurried step towards the
Maelstrom, which the street was...</p>

<p>Freder's fists smote against the pane. He cried the girl's
name. He yelled: "Maria...!" She must hear him. It was
impossible that she did not hear him. Regardless of his raw
knuckles he banged with his fists against the pane.</p>

<p>But Maria did not hear him. She did not turn her head around.
With her gentle but hurried step she submerged herself in the
surf of people as though into her very familiar element.</p>

<p>Freder leaped for the door. He heaved with his whole body,
with his shoulders, his knees, against the door. He no longer
shouted. His mouth was gaping open. His breath burnt his lips
grey. He sprang back to the window. There, outside, hardly ten
paces from the window, stood a policeman, his face turned
towards Rotwang's house. The man's face registered absolute
nonchalance. Nothing seemed to be farther from his mind than to
watch the magician's house. But the man who was striving, with
bleeding fists, to shatter a window pane in his house could not
have escaped even his most casual glance.</p>

<p>Freder paused. He stared at the policeman's face with an
unreasoning hatred, born of fear of losing time where there was
no time to be lost. He turned around and snatched up the rude
foot-stool, which stood near the table. He dashed the foot-stool
with full force at the window pane. The rebound jerked him
backwards. The pane was undamaged.</p>

<p>Sobbing fury welled up in Freder's throat. He swung the
foot-stool and hurled it at the door. The foot-stool crashed to
earth. Freder dashed to it, snatched it up and struck and
struck, again and again, at the booming door, in a ruddy, blind
desire to destroy.</p>

<p>Wood splintered, white. The door shrieked like a living
thing. Freder did not pause. To the rhythm of his own boiling
blood, he beat against the door until it broke, quivering.</p>

<p>Freder dragged himself through the hole. He ran through the
house. His wild eyes sought an enemy and fresh obstacles in each
corner. But he found neither one nor the other. Unchallenged, he
reached the door, found it open and reeled out into the
street.</p>

<p>He ran in the direction which Maria had taken. But the surf
of the people had washed her away. She had vanished.</p>

<p>For some minutes Freder stood among the hurrying mob, as
though paralysed. One senseless hope befogged his brain:
Perhaps&mdash;perhaps she would come back again...if he were
patient and waited long enough...</p>

<p>But he remembered the cathedral&mdash;waiting in
vain&mdash;her voice in the magician's house&mdash;words of
fear&mdash;her sweet, wicked laugh...</p>

<p>No&mdash;no waiting&mdash;! He wanted to know.</p>

<p>With clenched teeth he ran...</p>

<p>There was a house in the city where Maria lived. An
interminably long way. What should he ask about? With bare head,
with raw hands, with eyes which seemed insane with weariness, he
ran towards his destination: Maria's abode.</p>

<p>He did not know by how many precious hours Slim had come
before him...</p>

<p>He stood before the people with whom Maria was supposed to
live: a man&mdash;a woman&mdash;the faces of whipped curs. The
woman undertook the reply. Her eyes twitched. She held her hands
clutched under her apron.</p>

<p>No&mdash;no girl called Maria lived here&mdash;never had
lived here....</p>

<p>Freder stared at the woman. He did not believe her. She must
know the girl. She must live here.</p>

<p>Half stunned with fear that this last hope of finding Maria
could prove fallacious too, he described the girl, as memory
came to the aid of this poor madman.</p>

<p>She had such fair hair...She had such gentle eyes...She had
the voice of a loving mother...She wore a severe but lovely
gown...</p>

<p>The man left his position, near the woman, and stooped down
sideways, hunching his head down between his shoulders as though
he could not bear to hear how that strange young man there, at
the door, spoke of the girl, for whom he was seeking. Shaking
her head in angry impatience for him to be finished, the woman
repeated the same unvarnished words: The girl did not live here,
once and for all...Hadn't he nearly finished with his
catechism?</p>

<p>Freder went. He went without a word. He heard how the door
was slammed to, with a bang. Voices were retiring, bickering.
Interminable steps brought him to the street again.</p>

<p>Yes...what next?</p>

<p>He stood helpless. He did not know which way to turn.</p>

<p>Exhausted to death, drunken with weariness, he heard, with a
sudden wince, that the air around him was becoming filled with
an overpowering sound.</p>

<p>It was an immeasurably glorious and transporting sound, as
deep and rumbling as and more powerful than any sound on earth.
The voice of the sea when it is angry, the voice of falling
torrents, the voice of very close thunder-storms would be
miserably drowned in this Behemoth-din. Without being shrill it
penetrated all walls and, as long as it lasted, all things
seemed to swing in it. It was omnipresent, coming from the
heights and from the depths, being beautiful and horrible, being
an irresistible command.</p>

<p>It was high above the town. It was the voice of the town.</p>

<p>Metropolis raised her voice. The machines of Metropolis
roared; they wanted to be fed.</p>

<p>"My father," thought Freder, half unconsciously, "has pressed
his fingers upon the blue metal plate. The brain of Metropolis
controls the town. Nothing happens in Metropolis which does not
come to my father's ears. I shall go to my father and ask him if
the inventor, Rotwang, has played with Maria and with me in the
name of Joh Fredersen."</p>

<p>He turned around to wend his way to the New Tower of Babel.
He set off with the obstinacy of one possessed, with screwed up
lips, sharp lines between the eyebrows, clenched fists on his
weak, dangling arms. He set off as though he wanted to pound the
stone beneath his feet. It seemed as though every drop of blood
in his face had collected in his eyes alone. He ran, and, on the
interminable way, at every step, he had the feeling: I am not he
who is running...I am running, a spirit, by the side of my own
self...I, the spirit, am forcing my body to run onwards,
although it is tired to death...</p>

<p>Those who stared at him when he arrived at the New Tower of
Babel seemed to be seeing, not him, but a spirit...</p>

<p>He was about to enter the Pater-noster, which was pumping its
way, a scoop-wheel for human beings, through the New Tower of
Babel. But a sudden shudder pushed him away from it. Did there
not crouch below, deep, deep, down, under the sole of the New
Tower of Babel, a little, gleaming machine, which was like
Ganesha, the god with the elephant's head? Under the crouching
body, and the head, which was sunken on the chest, crooked legs
rested, gnome&mdash;Like, upon the platform. The trunk and legs
were motionless. But the short arms pushed and pushed and
pushed, alternately, forwards, backwards, forwards.</p>

<p>Who was standing before the machine now, cursing the Lord's
Prayer&mdash;the Lord's Prayer of the Pater-noster machine?</p>

<p>Shivering with horror, he ran up the stairs.</p>

<p>Stairs and stairs and stairs...They would never come to an
end...The brow of the New Tower of Babel lifted itself very near
to the sky. The tower roared like the sea. It howled as deep as
the storm. The hurtling of a waterfall boomed in its veins.</p>

<p>"Where is my father?" Freder asked the servants.</p>

<p>They indicated a door. They wanted to announce him. He shook
his head. He wondered: Why were these people looking so
strangely at him?</p>

<p>He opened a door. The room was empty. On the other side, a
second door, ajar. Voices behind it. The voice of his father and
that of another...</p>

<p>Freder suddenly stood still. His feet seemed to be nailed to
the floor. The upper part of his body was bent stiffly forwards.
His fists dangled on helpless arms, seeming no longer capable of
freeing themselves from their own clench. He listened; the eyes
in his white face were filled with blood, the lips were open as
though forming a cry.</p>

<p>Then he tore his deadened feet from the floor, stumbled to
the door and pushed it open...</p>

<p>In the middle of the room, which was filled with a cutting
brightness, stood Joh Fredersen, holding a woman in his arms.
And the woman was Maria. She was not struggling. Leaning far
back in the man's arms, she was offering him her mouth, he
alluring mouth, that deadly laugh...</p>

<p>"You...!" shouted Freder.</p>

<p>He dashed to the girl. He did not see his father. He saw only
the girl&mdash;no, neither did he see the girl, only her mouth
and her sweet, wicked laugh.</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen turned around, broad and menacing. He let the
girl go. He covered her with the might of his shoulders, with
the great cranium, flamed with blood, and in which the strong
teeth and the invincible eyes were very visible.</p>

<p>But Freder did not see his father. He only saw an obstacle
between him and the girl.</p>

<p>He rushed at the obstacle. It pushed him back. Scarlet hatred
for the obstacle choked him. His eyes flew around. They sought
an implement&mdash;an implement which could be used as a
battering ram. He found none. Then he threw himself toward as a
battering ram. His fingers clutched into stuff. He bit into the
stuff. He heard his own breath like a whistle, very high and
shrill. Yet within him there was only one sound, only one cry:
"Maria&mdash;!" Groaningly, beseechingly: "Maria&mdash;!!"</p>

<p>A man dreaming of hell shrieks out no more, in his torment,
than did he.</p>

<p>And still, between him and the girl, the man, the lump of
rock, the living wall...</p>

<p>He threw his hands forward. Ah...look!..there was a throat!
He seized the throat. His fingers snapped fast like iron
fangs.</p>

<p>"Why don't you defend yourself?" he yelled, staring at the
man.</p>

<p>"I'll kill you&mdash;! I'll take your life&mdash;! I'll
murder you&mdash;!"</p>

<p>But the man before him held his ground while he throttled
him. Thrown this way and that by Freder's fury, the body bent,
now to the right, now to the left. And as often as this happened
Freder saw, as through a transparent mist, the smiling
countenance of Maria, who, leaning against the table, was
looking on with her sea water eyes at the fight between father
and son.</p>

<p>His father's voice said: "Freder..."</p>

<p>He looked the man in the face. He saw his father. He saw the
hands which were clawing around his father's throat They were
his, were the hands of his son.</p>

<p>His hands fell loose, as though cut off...he stared at his
hands, stammering something which sounded half like an oath,
half like the weeping of a child that believes itself to be
alone in the world.</p>

<p>The voice of his father said: "Freder..."</p>

<p>He fell on his knees. He stretched out his arms. His head
fell forward into his father's hands. He burst into tears, into
despairing sobs...</p>

<p>A door slid to.</p>

<p>He flung his head around. He sprang to his feet. His eyes
swept the room.</p>

<p>"Where is she?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"She&mdash;..."</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"She...who was here..."</p>

<p>"Nobody was here, Freder..."</p>

<p>The boy's eyes glazed.</p>

<p>"What did you say&mdash;?" he stammered.</p>

<p>"There has not been a soul here, Freder, but you and I."</p>

<p>Freder twisted his head around stiffly. He tugged the shirt
from his throat. He looked into his father's eyes as though
looking into well-shafts.</p>

<p>"You say there was not a soul here...I did not see you...when
you were holding Maria in your arms...I have been dreaming...I
am mad, aren't I?..."</p>

<p>"I give you my word," said Joh Fredersen, "when you came to
me there was neither a woman nor any other living soul
here..."</p>

<p>Freder remained silent. His bewildered eyes were still
searching along the walls.</p>

<p>"You are ill, Freder," said his father's voice.</p>

<p>Freder smiled. Then he began to laugh. He threw himself into
a chair and laughed and laughed. He bent down, resting both
elbows upon his knees, burrowing his head between his hands and
arms. He rocked himself to and fro, shrieking with laughter.</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen's eyes were upon him.</p>

<h2><a id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="first">THE aeroplane which had carried Josaphat away
from Metropolis swam in the golden air of the setting sun,
rushing towards it at a tearing speed, as though fastened to the
westward sinking ball by metal cords.</p>

<p>Josaphat sat behind the pilot. From the moment when the
aerodrome had sunk below them and the stone mosaic of the great
Metropolis had paled away into the inscrutable depths, he had
not given the least token that he was a human being with the
faculty for breathing and moving. The pilot seemed to be taking
a pale grey stone, which had the form of a man, with him as
freight and, when he once turned around, he looked full into the
wide open eyes of this petrified being without meeting a glance
or the least sign of consciousness.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Josaphat had intercepted the movement of the
pilot's head with his brain. Not immediately. Not soon. Yet the
vision of this cautious, yet certain and vigilant movement
remained in his memory until he at last comprehended it.</p>

<p>Then the petrified image seemed to become a human being
again, whose breast rose in a long neglected breath, who raised
his eyes upwards, looking into the empty greenish blue sky and
down again to the earth which formed a flat, round carpet, deep
down in infinity&mdash;and at the sun which was rolling
westwards like a glowing ball.</p>

<p>Last of all, however, at the head of the pilot who sat before
him, at the airman's cap which turned, neckless, into shoulders
filled with a bull&mdash;Like strength and a forceful calm.</p>

<p>The powerful engine of the aeroplane worked in perfect
silence. But the air through which the aeroplane tore was filled
with a mysterious thunder, as though the dome of heaven were
catching up the roaring in the globe and throwing it angrily
back again.</p>

<p>The aeroplane hovered homelessly above a strange earth, like
a bird not able to find its nest.</p>

<p>Suddenly, amid the thunder of the air, the pilot heard a
voice at his left ear saying, almost softly: "Turn back..."</p>

<p>The head in the airman's cap was about to bend backwards. But
at the first attempt to do so it came in contact with an object
of resistance, which rested exactly on the top of his skull.
This object of resistance was small, apparently angular and
extraordinarily hard.</p>

<p>"Don't move!" said the voice at his left ear, which was so
soft, yet making itself understood through the thunder of the
air. "Don't look round, either! I have no revolver with me. Had
I had one handy I should probably not be here. What I have in my
hand is an implement the name and purpose of which are unknown
to me. But it is made of solid steel and quite sufficient to
smash in your skull with should you not obey me
immediately...Turn back!"</p>

<p>The bull&mdash;Like shoulders under the airman's cap raised
themselves in a short, impatient shrug. The glowing ball of the
sun touched the horizon with an inexpressibly light hovering
movement. For a few seconds it seemed to dance along it in soft,
blazing rhythm. The nose of the aeroplane was turned towards it
and did not alter its course by a hand's breadth.</p>

<p>"You do not seem to have understood me," said the voice
behind the pilot. "Turn back! I wish to return to Metropolis, do
you hear? I must be there before nightfall...well?"</p>

<p>"Shut your mouth," said the pilot. "For the last time, will
you obey or will you not&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Sit down and keep quiet, back there...damn it all, what do
you mean by it&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"You won't obey&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"What the hell..."</p>

<p>A young girl, turning the hay in a wide, undulating field, by
the last light of the setting sun, had sighted the rushing bird
above her, in the evening sky and was watching it with eyes
heated by work and tired by the summer.</p>

<p>How strangely the aeroplane was rising and falling! It was
making jumps like a horse that wants to shake off its rider.</p>

<p>Now it was racing towards the sun, now it was turning its
back upon it. The young girl had never seen so wild and unruly a
creature in the air before. Now it had swung westwards and was
dashing in long, spurting bounds along the sky. Something freed
itself from it; a broad, silver-grey cloth, which swelled itself
out.</p>

<p>Drifted hither and thither by the wind, the silver-grey cloth
fluttered down to earth&mdash;In the webs of which a gigantic,
black spider seemed to be hanging.</p>

<p>Screaming, the young girl began to run. The great, black
spider spun itself lower and lower on the thin cords. Now it was
already like a human being. A white, death&mdash;Like face bent
earthwards. The earth curved itself gently towards the sinking
creature. The man left go of the cord and leaped. And fell.
Picked himself up again. And fell once more.</p>

<p>Like a snow-cloud, gentle and shimmering, the silver-grey
cloth sank over him, quite covering him.</p>

<p>The young girl came running up.</p>

<p>She was still screaming, wordlessly, breathlessly, as though
these primitive shrieks were her actual language. She bundled
the silver silken cloth up before her young breast with both
arms in order to bring the man who lay beneath it into the light
again.</p>

<p>Yes, he lay there now, stretched out at his length on his
back, and the silk which was so strong as to have borne him tore
under the grip of his fingers. And where his fingers lost hold
of the silk, to find another patch which they could tear, there
remained moist, red marks upon the stuff, such as are left
behind by an animal that had dipped its paws into the blood of
its enemy.</p>

<p>The girl was silenced by the sight of these marks.</p>

<p>An expression of horror came into her face, but, at the same
time, an expression such as mother-beasts have when they scent
an enemy and do not want to betray themselves nor their
offspring in any way.</p>

<p>She clenched her teeth together so forcibly that her young
mouth became quite pale and thin. She knelt down beside the
young man and lifted his head into her lap.</p>

<p>The eyes opened in the white face which she was holding. They
stared into the eyes which were bending over them. They glanced
sideways and searched across the sky.</p>

<p>A rushing black point in the scarlet of the westerly sky,
from which the sun had sunk...</p>

<p>The aeroplane...</p>

<p>Now it had indeed carried out its will and was flying towards
the sun, further and further westward. At its wheel sat the man
who would not turn back, as dead as could be. The airman's cap
hung down in shreds from the gaping skull, on to the
bull&mdash;Like shoulders. But the fists had not lost hold of
the wheel. They still held it fast...</p>

<p>Farewell, pilot...</p>

<p>The face which lay in the young girl's lap began to smile,
began to ask.</p>

<p>Where was the nearest town?</p>

<p>There was no town, far and wide.</p>

<p>Where was the nearest railway?</p>

<p>There was no railway, far and wide.</p>

<p>Josaphat pushed himself up. He looked about him.</p>

<p>Stretching out far and wide were fields and meadows, hemmed
in by forests, standing there in their evening stillness. The
scarlet of the sky had faded away. The crickets chirped. The
mist about the distant, solitary willows brewed milky white.
From the hallowed purity of the great sky the first star
appeared with still glimmer.</p>

<p>"I must go," said the man with the white, deathlike face.</p>

<p>"You must rest, first," said the young girl.</p>

<p>The man's eyes looked up at her in astonishment. Her clear
face, with its low, unintelligent brow and its beautiful,
foolish mouth stood out, as if under a dome of sapphire, against
the sky which curved above her.</p>

<p>"Aren't you afraid of me?" asked the man.</p>

<p>"No," said the young girl.</p>

<p>The head of the man fell into her lap. She bent forward and
covered up the shivering body with the billowing, silver
silk.</p>

<p>"Rest..." said the man with a sigh.</p>

<p>She made no reply. She sat quite motionless.</p>

<p>"Will you awaken me," asked the man&mdash;and his voice
quavered with weariness&mdash;"as soon as the sun comes?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the young girl. "Keep quiet..."</p>

<p>He sighed deeply. Then he lay still.</p>

<p>It grew darker and darker.</p>

<p>In the far distance a voice was to be heard, calling a name,
long drawn out, again and again...</p>

<p>The stars stood glorious above the world. The distant voice
was silent. The young girl looked down upon the man whose head
lay in her lap. In her eyes was the never sleeping watchfulness
which one sees in the eyes of animals and of mothers.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="first">WHENEVER Josaphat tried, during the days which
followed, to break through the barrier which was drawn around
Freder, there was always a strange person there, and always a
different one, who said, with expressionless mien:</p>

<p>"Mr. Freder cannot receive anybody. Mr. Freder is ill." But
Freder was not ill&mdash;at least not as illness generally
manifests itself among mankind. From morning until evening, from
evening until morning, Josaphat watched the house, the crown of
the tower of which was Freder's flat. He never saw Freder leave
the house. But for hours at a time he saw, during the night,
behind the white-veiled windows, which ran the breadth of the
wall, a shadow wandering up and down&mdash;and saw at the hour
of twilight, when the rooves of Metropolis still shone, bathed
in the sun, and the darkness of the ravines of its streets was
flooded out by streams of cold light, the same shadow, a
motionless form, standing on the narrow balcony which ran around
this, almost the highest house in Metropolis.</p>

<p>Yet what was expressed by the shadow's wandering up and down,
by the motionless standing still of the shadow form, was not
illness. It was uttermost helplessness. Lying on the roof of the
house which was opposite Freder's flat, Josaphat watched the man
who had chosen him as friend and brother, whom he had betrayed
and to whom he had returned. He could not discern his face but
he read from the pale patch which this face was in the setting
sun, in the shower-bath of the searchlight, that the man over
there, whose eyes were staring across Metropolis, did not see
Metropolis.</p>

<p>Sometimes people would emerge beside him, would speak to him,
expecting an answer. But the answer never came. Then the people
would go, crushed.</p>

<p>Once Joh Fredersen came&mdash;came to his son, who stood on
the narrow balcony, seeming not to know that his father was
near. Joh Fredersen spoke to him for a long time. He laid his
hand on his son's hand, which was resting on the railing. The
mouth received no answer. The hand received no answer. Only once
did Freder turn his head, then with difficulty, as though the
joints of his neck were rusted. He looked at Joh Fredersen.</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen went.</p>

<p>And when his father had gone Freder turned his head back
again on idle joints and stared out once more across Metropolis,
which was dancing in a whirl of light, staring with blind
eyes.</p>

<p>The railing of the narrow balcony on which he stood appeared
as an insuperable wall of loneliness, of deep, inward
consciousness of having been deserted. No calling, no
signalling, not even the loudest of sounds penetrated this wall
which was washed about by the strong, lustrous surf of the great
Metropolis.</p>

<p>But Josaphat did not want to have ventured the leap from
heaven to earth, to have sent a man, who was but performing his
duty, into infinity, impotently to make a halt before this wall
of loneliness.</p>

<p>There came a night which hung, glowing and vapourous over
Metropolis. A thunder storm, which was still distant, burnt its
warning fires in deep clouds. All the lights of the great
Metropolis seemed more violently, seemed more wildly to lavish
themselves on the darkness.</p>

<p>Freder stood by the railing of the narrow balcony his hot
hands laid on the railing. A sultry, uneasy puff of wind tugged
at him, making the white silk which covered his now much
emaciated body to flutter.</p>

<p>Around the ridge of the roof of the house right opposite him
there ran, in a shining border, a shining word, running in an
everlasting circuit around, behind itself...</p>

<p>Phantasus...Phantasus...Phantasus...</p>

<p>Freder did not see this row of words. The retina received
it&mdash;not the brain.</p>

<p>Eternal hammering similarity of the wandering word...</p>

<p>Phantasus...Phantasus...Phantasus...</p>

<p>Suddenly the word picture was extinguished and in its place
numbers sparkled out of the darkness, disappearing again, again
emerging, and this coming and disappearing, coming again and
again disappearing, and coming anew had the effect in its
unmistakability, of a penetrating, persistent call.</p>

<p>90....................7....................7.................</p>

<p>90....................7....................7.................</p>

<p>90....................7....................7.................</p>

<p>Freder's eyes caught the numbers.</p>

<p>90....................7....................7.................</p>

<p>They turned around, they came back again.</p>

<p>90....................7....................7.................</p>

<p>Thoughts stumbled through his brain.</p>

<p>90&mdash;? and 7&mdash;? a second 7&mdash;?</p>

<p>What did that mean?...How obtrusive these numbers were.</p>

<p>90....................7....................7.................</p>

<p>90....................7....................7.................</p>

<p>90....................7....................7.................</p>

<p>Freder closed his eyes. But now the numbers were within him.
He saw them flame up, sparkle, go out...flame up, sparkle, go
out.</p>

<p>Was that&mdash;no...or yes?</p>

<p>Did not these numbers, some time ago, what seemed to him an
immeasurably long period ago, also convey something to him?</p>

<p>90&mdash;&mdash;90&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Suddenly a voice in his head said:</p>

<p>Ninetieth Block...Ninetieth Block...House seven...seventh
floor...</p>

<p>Freder opened his eyes. Over there, on the house just
opposite, the numbers jerked up, asked and called...</p>

<p>90....................7....................7.................</p>

<p>Freder bent forward over the railing so that it seemed he
must hurtle into space. The numbers dazzled him. He made a
movement with his arm as though he wanted to cover them up or
put them out.</p>

<p>They went out. The shining border went out. The house stood
in gloom, only half its height washed around by the shimmer from
the white street. The stormy sky, becoming suddenly visible, lay
above its roof and&mdash;lightning seemed to be crackling.</p>

<p>In the faded light, over there, stood a man.</p>

<p>Freder stepped back from the railing. He raised both hands
before his mouth. He looked to the right, to the left; he raised
both arms. Then he turned away, as if removed by a natural power
from the spot on which he stood, ran into the house, ran through
the room, stopped still again...</p>

<p>Carefully...carefully now...</p>

<p>He reflected. He pressed his head between his fists. Was
there among his servants, one single soul who could be trusted
not to betray him to Slim?</p>

<p>What a miserable state&mdash;what a miserable
state&mdash;!</p>

<p>But what alternative had he to the leap in the dark, the
blind trust&mdash;the ultimate test of confidence?</p>

<p>He would have liked to extinguish the lights in his room, but
he did not dare to, for up to this day he had not been able to
bear darkness about him. He paced up and down. He felt the
perspiration on his forehead and the trembling of his joints. He
could not calculate the time which elapsed. The blood roared in
his veins like a cataract. The first flash of lightning
flickered over Metropolis, and, in the tardy responding rumble
of thunder the rushing of the rain at last, mixed itself
soothingly. It swallowed up the sound of the opening of the
door. When Freder turned around Josaphat was standing in the
middle of the room. He was dressed in workman's uniform.</p>

<p>They walked up to each other as though driven by an outward
power. But, halfway, they both stopped and looked at each other,
and each had for the other the same horrified question on his
face. Where have you been since I saw you last? To what hell
have you descended?</p>

<p>Freder with his feverish haste, was the first to collect
himself. He seized his friend by the arm.</p>

<p>"Sit down!" he said in his toneless voice, which occasionally
held the morbid dryness of things burnt. He sat down beside him,
not taking his hand from the arm. "You waited for me&mdash;In
vain and in vain...I could not send you a message, forgive
me!"</p>

<p>"I have nothing to forgive you, Mr. Freder," said Josaphat,
quietly. "I did not wait for you...On the evening on which I was
to have waited for you, I was far, far away from Metropolis and
from you..."</p>

<p>Freder's waiting eyes looked at him.</p>

<p>"I betrayed you, Mr. Freder," said Josaphat.</p>

<p>Freder smiled, but Josaphat's eyes extinguished his
smile.</p>

<p>"I betrayed you, Mr. Freder," repeated the man. "Slim came to
me...He offered me much money...But I only laughed...I threw it
at his head. But then be laid on the tables slip with your
father's signature...You must believe me, Mr. Freder; He would
never have caught me with the money. There is no sum of money
for which I would have sold you...But when I saw your father's
hand-writing...I still put up a fight. I would gladly have
throttled him. But I had no more strength...JOH FREDERSEN was
written on the slip...I had no more strength then..."</p>

<p>"I can understand that," said Joh Fredersen's son.</p>

<p>"Thank you...I was to go away from Metropolis&mdash;right far
away...I flew...The pilot was a strange man. We kept flying
straight towards the sun. The sun was setting. Then it occurred
to my empty brain that now the hour would come in which I was to
wait for you. And I should not be there when you came...I wanted
to turn back. I asked the pilot. He wouldn't. He wanted to carry
me away by force, farther and farther from Metropolis. He was as
obstinate as only a man can be when he knows Slim's will to be
behind him. I begged and I threatened. But nothing was of any
use. So then, with one of his own tools, I smashed in his
skull."</p>

<p>Freder's fingers, which were still resting on Josaphat's arm,
tightened their hold a little; but they lay still again
immediately.</p>

<p>"Then I jumped out, and I was so far away from Metropolis
that a young girl who picked me up in the field did not know the
great Metropolis even by name...I came here and found no message
from you, and all that I found out was that you were ill..."</p>

<p>He hesitated and was silent, looking at Freder.</p>

<p>"I am not ill," said Freder, looking straight ahead. He
loosened his fingers from Josaphat's arm and bent forward,
laying the palms of both hands flat on his head. He spoke into
space..."But do you believe, Josaphat, that I am mad?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"But I must be," said Freder, and he shrank together, so
narrow that it seemed as if a little boy, filled with a mighty
fear, were sitting in his place. His voice sounded suddenly
quite high and thin and something in it brought the water to
Josaphat's eyes.</p>

<p>Josaphat stretched out his hand, fumbled, and found Freder's
shoulder. His hand closed around his neck and drew him gently
towards him, holding him still and fast.</p>

<p>"Just tell me about it, Mr. Freder!" he said. "I do not think
there are many things which seem insuperable to me since I
sprang, as though from heaven to earth, from the aeroplane which
was steered by a dead man. Also," he continued in a soft voice,
"I learnt in one single night that one can bear very much when
one has some one near one who keeps watch, asks nothing and is
simply there."</p>

<p>"I am mad, Josaphat," said Freder. "But&mdash;I don't know if it is
any consolation&mdash;! am not the only one..."</p>

<p>Josaphat was silent. His patient hand lay motionless on
Freder's shoulder.</p>

<p>And suddenly, as though his soul were an over-filled vessel,
which had lost its balance, toppled over and poured out in
streams, Freder began to speak. He told his friend the story of
Maria, from the moment of their first meeting in the "Club of
Sons," to when they saw each other again right down under the
earth in the City of the Dead&mdash;his waiting for her in the
cathedral, his experiences in Rotwang's house, his vain search,
the curt "no" at Maria's home, up to the moment when, for her
sake, he wanted to be the murderer of his own father&mdash;no,
not for her sake: for that of a being who was not there, whom he
only believed himself to see...</p>

<p>"Was that not madness&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Hallucination, Mr. Freder..."</p>

<p>"Hallucination&mdash;? I will tell you some more about
hallucination, Josaphat, and you mustn't believe that I am
speaking in delirium or that I am not fully master of my
thoughts. I wanted to kill my father...It was not my fault that
the attempt at parricide was unsuccessful...But ever since that
moment I have not been human...I am a creature that has no feet,
no hands and hardly a head. And this head is only there
eternally to think that I wanted to kill my own father. Do you
believe that I shall ever get free from this hell&mdash;? Never,
Josaphat. Never&mdash;never in all eternity. I lay during the
night hearing my father walking up and down in the next room. I
lay in the depths of a black pit; but my thoughts ran along
behind my father's steps, as though chained to his soles. What
horror has come upon the world that this could happen? Is there
a comet in the heavens which drives mankind to madness? Is a
fresh plague coming, or Anti-Christ? Or the end of the world? A
woman, who does not exist, forces herself between father and son
and incites the son to murder against the father...It may be
that my thoughts were running themselves a little hot at the
time...Then my father came in to me..."</p>

<p>He stopped and his wasted hands twisted themselves together
upon his damp hair.</p>

<p>"You know my father. There are many in the great Metropolis
who do not believe Joh. Fredersen to be human, because he seems
not to need to eat and drink and he sleeps when he wishes to;
and usually he does not wish to...They call him The Brain of
Metropolis, and if it is true that fear is the source of all
religion then the brain of Metropolis is not very far off from
becoming a deity...This man, who is my father came up to my
bed...He walked on tiptoe, Josaphat. He bent over me and held
his breath...My eyes were shut. I lay quite still and it seemed
to me as though my father must hear my soul crying within me.
Then I loved him more than anything on earth. But if my life had
been dependent on it, I should still not have been able to open
my eyes. I felt my father's hand smoothing my pillow. Then he
went again as he had come, on tip-toe, closing the door quiet
soundlessly behind him. Do you know what he had done?"</p>

<p>"No...."</p>

<p>"No...I don't see how you could. I only realised it myself
some hours later...For the first time since the great Metropolis
had stood, Joh Fredersen had omitted to press on the little blue
metal plate and to let the Behemoth-voice of Metropolis roar
out, because he did not wish to disturb his son's sleep..."</p>

<p>Josaphat lowered his head; he said nothing. Freder let his
intertwined hands sink.</p>

<p>"Then I realised," he continued, "that my father had quite
forgiven me...And when I realised that, I really fell
asleep..."</p>

<p>He stood up and remained standing, seeming to be listening to
the rushing of the rain. The lightning was still flashing out
over Metropolis, the angry thunder bounding after. But the
rushing of the rain drowned it.</p>

<p>"I slept..." Freder went on&mdash;so softly that the other
could scarcely follow his words&mdash;"then I began to dream...I
saw this city&mdash;this great Metropolis&mdash;In the light of
a ghostly unreality. A weird moon stood in the sky; as though
along a broad street this ghostly, unreal light flowed down upon
the city, which was deserted to the last soul. All the houses
were distorted and had faces. They squinted evilly and
spitefully down at me, for I was walking deep down between them,
along the glimmering street.</p>

<p>"Quite narrow was this street, as though crushed between the
houses; it was as though made of a greenish glass&mdash;like a
solidified, glazen river. I glided along it and looked down;
through it into the cold bubbling of a subterranean fire.</p>

<p>"I did not know my destination, but I knew I had one, and
went very fast in order to reach it the sooner. I quietened my
step as well as I could, but its sound was excessively loud and
awakened a rustling whisper over the crooked house-walls as
though the houses were murmuring against me. I quickened my pace
and ran, and, at last, raced along, and the more swiftly I raced
the more hoarsely did the echo of the steps sound after me, as
though there were an army at my heels. I was dripping with
sweat...</p>

<p>"The town was alive. The houses were alive. Their open mouths
snarled after me. The window-caverns, open eyes, winked blindly,
horribly, maliciously.</p>

<p>"Graspingly, I reached the square before the
cathedral....</p>

<p>"The cathedral was lighted up. The doors stood open&mdash;no, they
did not stand open. They reeled to and fro like swing doors
through which an invisible stream of guests was passing. The
organ rolled, but not with music. Croaking, bawling, screeching
and whimpering sounded from the organ and intermingled were
wanton dance tunes, wailing whore-songs."</p>

<p>"The swing-doors, the light, the organ's witches sabbath,
everything appeared to be mysteriously excited, hurried, as
though there were no time to be lost, and full of a deep evil
satisfaction."</p>

<p>"I walked over to the cathedral and up the steps. A door laid
hold of me, like an arm, and wafted me gustily in the
cathedral.</p>

<p>"But that was as little the cathedral as the town was
Metropolis. A pack of lunatics seemed to have taken possession
of it, and not even human beings, at that. Dwarf&mdash;Like
creatures, resembling half monkey, half devil. In place of the
saints, goat&mdash;Like figures, petrified in the most
ridiculous of leaps, reigned in the pillar niches. And around
every pillar danced a ring, raving to the bawling of the
music.</p>

<p>"Empty, ungodded, splintered, hung the crucifix above the
high altar, from which the holy vessels had vanished."</p>

<p>"A fellow, dressed in black, the caricature of a monk, stood
in the pulpit, howling out in a pulpit-voice:"</p>

<p>"Repent! The kingdom of heaven is at hand!'</p>

<p>"A loud neigh answered him."</p>

<p>"The organ-player&mdash;! saw him, he was like a demon&mdash;stood
with his hands and feet on the keys and his head beat time to
the ring-dance of the spirits."</p>

<p>"The fellow in the pulpit pulled out a book, an enormous,
black book with seven locks. Whenever his fingers touched a lock
it sprang up in flame and shot open."</p>

<p>"Murmuring incantations, he opened the cover. He bent over
the book. A ring of flames suddenly stood around his head."</p>

<p>"From the heights of the cathedral it struck midnight. But it
was as though it was not enough for the clock to proclaim the
hour of demons just once. Over and over again did it strike the
ghastly twelve, in dreadful, baited haste."</p>

<p>"The light in the cathedral changed colour. Were it possible
to speak of a blackish light this would be the expression best
applied to the light. Only in one place did it shine, white,
gleaming, cutting, a sharply whetted sword: there where death is
figured as a minstrel."</p>

<p>"Suddenly the organ stopped, and suddenly the dance. The
voice of the preacher-fellow in the pulpit stopped. And through
the silence which did not dare to breathe rang the sound of a
flute. Death was playing. The minstrel was playing the song
which nobody plays after him, on his flute which was a human
bone.</p>

<p>"The ghostly minstrel stepped from out his side-niche, carved
in wood, in hat and wide cloak, scythe on shoulder, the hour-glass
dangling from his girdle. Playing his flute, he stepped
out of his niche and made his way through the cathedral. And
behind him came the seven Deadly Sins as the following of
Death."</p>

<p>"Death performed a circle around every pillar. Louder and
ever louder rang the sound of his flute. The seven Deadly Sins
seized hands. As a widely swung chain they paced behind Death;
and gradually their paces became a light dance."</p>

<p>"The seven Deadly Sins danced along behind Death, who was
playing the flute."</p>

<p>"Then the cathedral was filled with a light which seemed to
be made from rose-leaves. An inexpressibly sweet, overpowering
perfume hovered up', like incense, between the pillars. The
light grew stronger and it seemed to ring. Pale red lightning
flashed from the heights collecting itself in the central nave,
to the magnificent radiance of a crown."</p>

<p>"The crown rested on the head of a woman. And the woman was
sitting upon a scarlet-coloured beast, having seven heads and
ten horns. And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet and
decked with gold, precious stones and pearls. She had in her
hand a golden cup. On the crowned brow of the woman there stood,
mysteriously written: Babylon."</p>

<p>"Like a deity, she grew up and radiated. Death and the seven
Deadly Sins bowed low before her."</p>

<p>"And the woman who bore the name Babylon had the features of
Maria, whom I loved..."</p>

<p>"The woman arose. She touched the cross-arched vault of the
lofty cathedral with her crown. She seized the hem of her cloak
and opened it. And spread out her cloak with both hands...Then
one saw that the golden cloak was embroidered with the images of
manifold demons. Beings with women's bodies and snakes'
heads&mdash;beings half bull, half angel&mdash;devils adorned
with crowns, human faced lions."</p>

<p>"The flute song of Death was silenced. But the fellow in the
pulpit raised his yelling voice:"</p>

<p>"Repent! The kingdom of heaven is at hand!"</p>

<p>"The church-clock was still hammering the wild twelve-time of
midnight"</p>

<p>"The woman looked Death in the face. She opened her mouth.
She said to Death: 'Go!'"</p>

<p>"Then Death hung the flute on his girdle, by the hourglass,
took the scythe down from his shoulder and went. He went through
the cathedral and went out of the cathedral."</p>

<p>And from the cloak of the great Babylon, the demons freed
themselves, come to life, and flew after Death.</p>

<p>"Death went down the steps of the cathedral, into the town;
black birds with human faces rustling around him. He raised the
scythe as if indicating the way. Then they divided themselves
and swooped apart. The broad wings darkened the moon."</p>

<p>"Death flung back his wide cloak. He stretched himself up and
grew. He grew much taller even than the houses of Metropolis.
The highest hardly reached to his knee."</p>

<p>"Death swung his scythe and made a whistling cut. The earth
and all the stars quivered. But the scythe did not seem to be
sharp enough for him. He looked about him as though seeking a
seat. The New Tower of Babel seemed to suit Death. He sat down
on the New Tower of Babel, propped up the scythe took the
whet-stone from his girdle, spat on it and began to whet the scythe
Blue sparks flew out of the steel. Then Death arose and made a
second blow. A rain of stars poured down from the sky."</p>

<p>"Death nodded with satisfaction, turned around and set off,
on his way through the great Metropolis."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="first">"YES," said Josaphat hoarsely, "but that was a
dream..."</p>

<p>"Of course it was a dream...And they say dreams are bubbles,
don't they? But just listen to this, Josaphat...I emerged from
this dream back into reality with a feeling of sadness, which
seemed to hack me, as with a knife, from head to foot. I saw
Maria's brow, that white temple of goodness and virginity,
besmirched with the name of the great harlot of Babylon. I saw
her send Death out over the city. I saw how abominations upon
abominations loosened themselves from about her and fluttered
away, swarming through the city&mdash;plague spirits, messengers
of evil before the path of Death. I stood out there and looked
over at the cathedral, which seemed to me to be desecrated and
soiled. Its doors stood open. Dark, human snakes were creeping
into the cathedral, and collecting themselves upon the steps. I
thought: Perhaps, among all those pious people, is my Maria
too...I said to my father: 'I wish to go to the cathedral...' He
let me go. I was no captive. As I reached the cathedral the
organ was thundering like the Trump of Doom. Singing from a
thousand throats. Dies Irae...The incense clouded above the head
of the multitude, which was kneeling before the eternal God. The
crucifix hovered above the high altar, and, in the light of the
restless candles, the drops of blood on the thorn-crowned brow
of the son of Mary seemed to come to hie, to run. The saints in
the pillar-niches looked at me sadly, as though they knew of my
evil dream.</p>

<p>"I sought Maria. Oh, I knew quite well that all the thousands
could not hide her from me. If she were here I should find her
out, as a bird finds its way to its nest. But my heart lay as if
dead in my breast. Yet I could not help looking for her. I
wandered about the place where I had already waited for her once
before...Yes&mdash;so may a bird wander about the place where
was its nest which it cannot find again, because the lightning
or the storm has destroyed it.</p>

<p>"And, when I came to the side-niche, in which Death stands,
as a minstrel, playing upon a human bone, the niche was empty,
Death had disappeared...</p>

<p>"It was as though the Death of my dream had not returned home
to his following...</p>

<p>"Do not speak, Josaphat! It is really of no importance...a
coincidence...The carving was, perhaps, damaged&mdash;I do not
know! Believe me: it is of no importance.</p>

<p>"But now a voice yelled out:</p>

<p>"'Repent! The kingdom of heaven is at hand!'</p>

<p>"It was the voice of Desertus, the monk. His voice was like a
knife. The voice peeled bare my spine. Deathly stillness reigned
in the church. Among all the thousands round about, not one
seemed to breathe They were kneeling and their faces, pale masks
of horror, were turned towards the preacher.</p>

<p>"His voice flew through the air like a spear."</p>

<p>"'Repent! The kingdom of heaven is at hand!' Before me, by a
pillar, stood a young man, once a fellow member of mine, of the
'Club of the Sons.' If I had not personally experienced how
vastly human faces can change, in a short time, I should not
have recognised him."</p>

<p>"He was older than I, and was, it is true, not the happiest
of us all, but the gayest. And the women loved him and feared
him equally, for he was in no way to be captivated, either by
laughter or by tears. Now he had the thousand-year-old face of
men, who, yet living, are dead. It was as if a cruel executioner
had removed his eyelids, that he was condemned never to sleep,
so that he was perishing of weariness."</p>

<p>"But it surprised me more than all to find him here, in the
cathedral, for he had been, all his life long, the greatest of
scoffers."</p>

<p>"I laid my hand on his shoulder. He did not start. He only
just turned his eyes&mdash;those parched eyes."</p>

<p>"I wanted to ask him: 'What are you doing here, Jan?' But the
voice of the monk, that awful, spear-hurling voice, threw its
sharpness between him and me...The monk Desertus began to
preach..."</p>

<p>Freder turned around and came to Josaphat with violent haste,
as though a sudden fear had taken him. He sat down by his
friend, speaking very rapidly, with words which tumbled over
each other in streaming out.</p>

<p>At first he had hardly listened to the monk. He had watched
his friend, and the congregation which was still kneeling, head
pressed to head. And, as he looked at them, it seemed to him as
though the monk were harpooning the congregation with his words,
as though he were throwing spears, with deadly, barbed hooks,
right down into the most secret soul of the listeners, as though
he were tugging groaning souls out of bodies, quivering with
fear.</p>

<p>"Who is she, who has laid fire to this city? She is herself a
flame&mdash;an impure flame. You were given of a brand, might.
She is a fiery blaze over man. She is Lilith, Astarte, Rose of
Hell. She is Gomorrha, Babylon&mdash;Metropolis! Your own
city&mdash;this fruitful, sinful City!&mdash;has born this woman
from out the womb of its hell. Behold her! I say unto you:
Behold her! She is the woman who is to appear before the
judgment of the world."</p>

<p>"He who has ears to hear, let him hear."</p>

<p>"Seven angels shall stand before God, and there shall be
given unto them seven trumpets. And the seven angels, which have
the seven trumpets, shall prepare themselves to sound. A star
shall fall from heaven to earth and there shall be given up the
key to the pit of the abyss. And it shall open the pit of the
abyss and there shall go up a smoke out of the pit as the smoke
of a great furnace; and the sun and the air shall be darkened by
reason of the smoke of the pit. And an angel shall fly in mid
heaven, saying with a great voice: 'Woe, woe, woe, for them that
dwell on the earth!' And another angel shall follow after him
and shall say: 'Fallen, fallen, is Babylon the great!'"</p>

<p>"Seven angels come out from the heavens, and they hear in
their hands the bowls of the wrath of God. And Babylon the great
will be remembered in the sight of God, to give unto her the cup
of the wine of the fierceness of His wrath&mdash;she who is
sitting there upon a scarlet-coloured beast full of the names of
blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. And the woman is
arrayed in purple and scarlet, decked with gold and precious
stones and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup, full of
abominations and unclean things. And upon her forehead a name is
written: Mystery...Babylon the Great...The Mother of Harlots and
of the Abominations of the Earth."</p>

<p>"He who has ears to hear, let him hear! For the woman whom ye
see is the great city, which reignest over the kings of the
earth. Come forth, my people, out of her, that he have no
fellowship with her sins! For her sins have reached even unto
heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities!</p>

<p>"Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city! For in
one hour is thy judgment come! In one hour shalt thou be made
desolate. Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye saints, and ye
apostles; for God will judge your judgment on her. And a strong
angel takes up a stone and casts it into the sea, saying: Thus
with a mighty fall, shall Babylon the great city be cast down,
and shall be found no more at all!"</p>

<p>"He who has ears to hear, let him hear! The woman who is
called Babylon, the Mother of the Abominations of the Earth,
wanders as a blazing brand through Metropolis. No wall and no
gate bids her halt. No tie is sacred. An oath turns to mockery
before her. Her smile is the last seduction. Blasphemy is her
dance. She is the flame which says: 'God is very wrath.' Woe
unto the city in which she shall appear!" Freder bent across to
Jan.</p>

<p>"Of whom is he speaking?" he asked, with strangely cold lips.
"Is he speaking of a person?...of a woman?..." He saw that the
brow of his friend was covered with sweat. "He is speaking of
her," said Jan, as though he were speaking with paralysed
tongue. "Of whom?"</p>

<p>"Of her...don't you know her?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Freder, "whom you mean..." And his
tongue, too, was heavy, and as though made of clay.</p>

<p>Jan gave no answer. He had hunched up his shoulders as though
he were bitterly cold. Bewildered and undecided, he listened to
the intermediate rolling of the organ.</p>

<p>"Let us go!" he said tonelessly, turning around. Freder
followed him. They left the cathedral. They walked along
together in silence for a long time. Jan seemed to have a
destination of which Freder did not know. He did not ask. He
waited. He was thinking of his dream and of the monk's
words.</p>

<p>At last Jan opened his mouth; but he did not look at Freder,
he spoke into space:</p>

<p>"You do not know who she is...But nobody knows...She was
suddenly there...As a fire breaks out...No one can say who
fanned the flame...But there it is, and now everything is
ablaze..."</p>

<p>"A woman...?"</p>

<p>"Yes. A woman. Perhaps a maid, too. I don't know. It is
inconceivable that this being would give herself to a man...(Can
you imagine the marriage of ice?)...Or if she were to do so,
then she would raise herself up from the man's arms, bright and
cool, in the awful, eternal virginity of the soulless..."</p>

<p>He raised his hand and seized his throat. He tugged something
away from him which was not there. He was looking at a house
which lay opposite him, on the other side of the street, with a
gaze of superstitious hostility, which made his hands run
cold.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you?" asked Freder. There was
nothing remarkable about this house, except that it lay next to
Rotwang's house.</p>

<p>"Hush!" answered Jan, clasping his fingers around Freder's
wrist.</p>

<p>"Are you mad?" Freder stared at his friend. "Do you think
that the house can hear us across this infernal street?"</p>

<p>"It hears us!" said Jan, with an obstinate expression. "It
hears us! You think it is a house just like any other? You're
wrong...It began in this house..."</p>

<p>"What began?"</p>

<p>"The spirit..."</p>

<p>Freder felt that his throat was very dry. He cleared it
vigorously. He wanted to draw his friend along with him. But he
resisted him. He stood at the parapet of the street, which
sheered down, steep as a gorge, and he was staring at the house
opposite.</p>

<p>"One day," he said, "this house sent out invitations to all
its neighbours. It was the craziest invitation on earth. There
was nothing on the card but: 'Come this evening at ten o'clock!
House 12, 113th Street!' One took the whole thing to be a joke.
But one went. One did not wish to miss the fun. Strangely enough
no one knew the house. Nobody could remember ever having entered
it, or having known anything of its occupants. One turned up at
ten. One was well dressed. One entered the house and found a big
party. One was received by an old man, who was exceedingly
polite, but who shook hands with nobody. It was an odd thing
that all the people collected here seemed to be waiting for
something, of which they did not know. One was well waited upon
by servants, who seemed to be born mutes, and who never raised
their eyes. Although the room in which we were all gathered was
as large as the nave of a church, an unbearable heat prevailed,
as though the floor were glowing hot, as though the walls, were
glowing hot, and all this in spite of the fact that, as one
could see, the wide door leading to the street stood open.</p>

<p>"Suddenly one of the servants came up from the door to our
host, with soundless step, and seemed wordlessly, with his
silent presence, to give him some information. Our host
inquired: 'Are we all met?' The servant inclined his head. "Then
close the door." It was done. The servants swept aside and lined
themselves up. Our host stepped into the middle of the great
room. At the same moment so perfect a silence prevailed that one
heard the noise of the street roaring like breakers against the
walls of the house.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," said the old man courteously, "may I
have the honour of presenting my daughter to you!"</p>

<p>He bowed to all sides, and then he turned his back. Everyone
waited. No one moved.</p>

<p>"Well, my daughter," said the old man, with a gentle, but
somehow horrible voice, softly clapping his hands.</p>

<p>"Then she appeared on the stairs and came slowly down the
room..."</p>

<p>Jan gulped. His fingers, which still held Freder's wrist in
their clutch, gripped tighter, as though they wished to crush
the bones.</p>

<p>"Why am I telling you this?" he stammered. "Can one describe
lightning? Or music? Or the fragrance of a flower? All the women
in the hall suddenly blushed violently and feverishly and all
the men turned pale. Nobody seemed capable of making the least
movement or of saying a single word...You know Rainer? You know
his young wife? You know how they loved each other? He was
standing behind her. She was sitting, and he had laid his hands
on her shoulders with a gesture of passionate and protective
affection. As the girl walked by them&mdash;she walked, led by
the hand of the old man, with gentle ringing step, slowly
through the hall&mdash;Rainer's hands slipped from his wife's
shoulders. She looked up at him, he down at her; and in the
faces of those two were burnt, like a torch, a sudden, deadly
hatred...</p>

<p>"It was as though the air was burning. We breathed fire. At
the same time there radiated from the girl a coldness&mdash;an
unbearable, cutting coldness. The smile which hovered between
her half-open lips seemed to be the unspoken closing verse of a
shameless song.</p>

<p>"Is there some substance through the power of which emotions
are destroyed, as colours are by acids? The presence of this
girl was enough to annul everything which spells fidelity in the
human heart, even to a point of absurdity. I had accepted the
invitation of this house because Tora had told me she would go
too. Now I no longer saw Tora, and I have not seen her since.
And the strange thing was that, among all these motionless
beings who were standing there as though benumbed, there was not
one who could have hidden his feelings. Each knew how it was
with the other. Each felt that he was naked and saw the
nakedness of the others. Hatred, born of shame, smouldered among
us. Tora was crying. I could have struck her...Then the girl
danced. No, it was no dance...She stood, freed from the hand of
the old man, on the lowest step, facing us, and she raised her
arms about the width of her garment with a gentle, a seemingly
never-ending movement. The slender hands touched above her
hair-parting. Over her shoulders, her breasts, her hips, her knees,
there ran an incessant, a barely perceptible trembling. It was
no frightened trembling. It was like the trembling of the final
spinal fins of a luminous, deep sea fish. It was as though the
girl were carried higher and higher by this trembling, though
she did not move her feet. No dance, no scream, no cry of an
animal in heat, could have so lashing an effect as the trembling
of this shimmering body, which seemed, in its calm, in its
solitude, to impart the waves of its incitement to every single
soul in the room.</p>

<p>"Then she went up the steps, stepping backwards, with
tentative feet, without lowering her hands, and she disappeared
into a velvet-deep darkness. The servants opened the door to the
street. They lined up with backs bent.</p>

<p>"The people still sat motionless.</p>

<p>"'Good night, ladies and gentlemen!' said the old man..."</p>

<p>Jan was silent. He took his hat from his head. He wiped his
forehead.</p>

<p>"A dancer," said Freder, with cold lips, "but a
spirit...?"</p>

<p>"Not a spirit! I will tell you another story...A man and a
woman, of fifty and forty, rich and very happy, have a son. You
know him, but I will not mention any names...</p>

<p>"The son sees the girl. He is as though mad. He storms the
house. He storms the girl's father: 'Let me have her! I am dying
for her!' The old man smiles, shrugs his shoulders, is silent,
is exceedingly sorry, the girl is not to be attained.</p>

<p>"The young man wants to lay hands on the old man, but he is
whirled out of the house and thrown into the street, by he does
not know whom. He is taken home. He falls ill and is at Death's
door. The doctors shrug their shoulders.</p>

<p>"The father, who is a proud but kindly man, and who loves his
son above anything on earth, makes up his mind to visit the old
man, himself. He gains entrance to the house without difficulty.
He finds the old man, and with him, the girl. He says to the
girl: 'Save my son!'"</p>

<p>"The girl looks at him and says, with the most graciously
inhuman of smiles: 'You have no son...'</p>

<p>"He does not understand the meaning of these words. He wants
to know more. He urges the girl. She always gives the same
answer. He urges the old man&mdash;he lifts his shoulders. There
is a perfidious smile about his mouth..."</p>

<p>"Suddenly the man comprehends...He goes home. He repeats the
girl's words to his wife. She breaks down and confesses her
sin&mdash;a sin which, after twenty years, has not yet died
down. But she is not concerned with her own fate. She has no
thought apart from her son. Shame, desertion,
loneliness&mdash;all are nothing; but the son is
everything."</p>

<p>"She goes to the girl and falls on her knees before her: 'I
beg you, in the name of God's mercy, save my son...!' The girl
looks at her, smiles and says: 'You have no son...' The woman
believes that she has a lunatic before her. But the girl was
right. The son, who had been a secret witness to the
conversation between the husband and the mother, had ended his
life..."</p>

<p>"Marinus?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"...A terrible coincidence, Jan, but still, not a
spirit."</p>

<p>"Coincidence?&mdash;Not a spirit?&mdash;And what do you call
it, Freder," continued Jan, speaking quite close to Freder's
ear, "when this girl can appear in two places at once?"</p>

<p>"That's absolute rubbish..."</p>

<p>"Rubbish&mdash;? It's the truth, Freder! The girl was seen
standing at the window in Rotwang's house&mdash;and, at the same
time, she was dancing her sinful dance in Yoshiwara...."</p>

<p>"That is not true&mdash;!" said Freder.</p>

<p>"It is true!"</p>

<p>"You have seen the girl...In Yoshiwara&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"You can see her yourself, if you like...."</p>

<p>"What's the girl's name?"</p>

<p>"Maria..."</p>

<p>Freder laid his forehead in his hands. He bent double, as in
the throes of an agony, which otherwise God does not permit to
visit mankind.</p>

<p>"You know the girl?" asked Jan, bending forward.</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"But you love her," said Jan, and behind these words lurked
hatred, crouched to spring.</p>

<p>Freder took his hand and said: "Come!"</p>

<p><br>
"But," continued Freder, fixing his eyes upon Josaphat, who
was sitting there quite sunken together, while the rain was
growing gentler, like hushed weeping, "Slim was suddenly
standing there, beside me, and he said: 'Will you not return
home, Mr. Freder?' "</p>

<p>Josaphat was silent for a long time: Freder, too, was silent.
In the frame of the open door, which led out to the balcony,
stood, hovering, the picture of the monster clock, on the New
Tower of Babel, bathed in a white light. The large hand jerked
to twelve.</p>

<p>Then a sound arose throughout Metropolis.</p>

<p>It was an immeasurably glorious and transporting sound, as
deep and rumbling as, and more powerful than any sound on earth.
The voice of the ocean when it is angry, the voice of falling
torrents, the voice of very close thunder storms, would be
miserably drowned in this Behemoth din. Without being shrill, it
penetrated all walls, and, as long as it lasted, all things
seemed to swing in it. It was omnipresent, coming from the
heights and from the depths, being beautiful and horrible, being
an irresistible command.</p>

<p>It was high above the town. It was the voice of the town.</p>

<p>Metropolis raised her voice. The machines of Metropolis
roared: They wanted to be fed.</p>

<p>The eyes of Josaphat and Freder met.</p>

<p>"Now," said Josaphat, "many are going down into a city of the
dead, and are waiting for one who is called Maria, and whom they
have found as true as gold..."</p>

<p>"Yes!" said Freder, "you are a friend, and you are quite
right...I shall go with them..."</p>

<p>And, for the first time this night, there was something like
hope in the ring of his voice.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="first">IT was one hour after midnight.</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen came to his mother's house.</p>

<p>It was a farmhouse, one-storied, thatch-roofed, overshadowed
by a walnut tree and it stood upon the flat back of one of the
stone giants, not far from the cathedral. A garden full of
lilies and hollyhocks, full of sweet peas and poppies and
nasturtiums, wound itself about the house.</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen's mother had only one son and him she had very
dearly loved. But the Master over the great Metropolis, the
Master of the machine-city, the Brain of the New Tower of Babel
had become a stranger to her and she hostile to him. She had had
to look on once and see how one of Joh Fredersen's machine-Titans
crushed men as though they were dried up wood. She had
screamed to God. He had not heard her. She fell to the ground
and never got up again. Only head and hands retained their
vitality in the paralysed body. But the strength of a legion
blazed in her eyes.</p>

<p>She opposed her son and the work of her son. But he did not
let her alone; he forced her to him. When she angrily vowed she
wished to live in her house&mdash;under the thatched roof, with
its vault, the walnut tree&mdash;until her dying day, he
transplanted house and tree and gaily blossoming garden to the
flat roof of the stone house-giant which lay between the
cathedral and the New Tower of Babel. The walnut tree ailed one
year long; and then it became green again. The garden blossomed,
a wonder of beauty, about the house.</p>

<p>When Joh Fredersen entered this house he came from sleepless
nights and evil days.</p>

<p>He found his mother as he always found her: sitting in the
wide, soft chair by the open window, the dark rug over the now
paralysed knees, the great Bible on the sloping table before
her, in the beautiful old hands the delicate figured lace at
which she was sewing; and, as ever, when he came to her, she
silently laid aside the fine work and folded her hands firmly in
her lap as though she must collect all her will and every
thought for the few minutes which the great son spent with his
mother.</p>

<p>They did not shake hands; they did not do that, any more.</p>

<p>"How are you, mother?" asked Joh Fredersen.</p>

<p>She looked at him with eyes in which gleamed the strength of
a heavenly legion. She asked:</p>

<p>"What is it you want, Joh?"</p>

<p>He sat down opposite her and laid his forehead in his
hands.</p>

<p>There was nobody in the great Metropolis, not anywhere else
on earth who could have boasted ever having seen Joh Fredersen
with sunken brow.</p>

<p>"I need your advice, mother," he said, looking at the
floor.</p>

<p>The mother's eyes rested on his hair.</p>

<p>"How shall I advise you, Joh? You have taken a path along
which I cannot follow you&mdash;not with my head, and certainly
not with my heart. Now you are so far away from me that my voice
can no longer reach you. And if it were able to reach you, Joh,
would you listen to me were I to say to you: Turn back&mdash;?
You did not do it then and would not do it to-day. Besides, all
too much has been done which cannot be undone, you have done all
too much wrong, Joh, and do not repent, but believe yourself to
be in the right. How can I advise you then...</p>

<p>"It is about Freder, mother...?"</p>

<p>"...about Freder?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What about Freder..."</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen did not answer immediately.</p>

<p>His mother's hands trembled greatly, and, if Joh Fredersen
had looked up, the fact could not have remained hidden from him.
But Joh Fredersen's forehead remained sunken upon his hands.</p>

<p>"I had to come to you, mother, because Hel is no longer
alive...."</p>

<p>"And of what did she die?"</p>

<p>"I know: of me...You have made it clear to me, mother, often
and cruelly, and you have said I had poured boiling wine into a
crystal. Then the most beautiful of glass must crack. But I do
not repent it, mother. No, I do not repent it...For Hel was
mine..."</p>

<p>"And died for it..."</p>

<p>"Yes. Had she never been mine perhaps she would still be
alive. Better that she should be dead."</p>

<p>"She is, Joh. And Freder is her son."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that, mother?"</p>

<p>"If you did not know just as well as I, Joh, you would not
have come to me to-day."</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen was silent. Through the open window, the
rustling of the walnut tree was to be heard, a dreamy, touching
sound.</p>

<p>"Freder often comes to you, mother, doesn't he?" asked Joh
Fredersen.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"He comes to you for aid against me..."</p>

<p>"He is in great need of it, Joh..."</p>

<p>Silence. Then Joh Fredersen raised his head. His eyes looked
as though sprinkled with purple.</p>

<p>"I have lost, Hel, mother," he said. "I can't lose Freder
too..."</p>

<p>"Have you reason to fear that you will lose him?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I am surprised," said the old lady, "that Freda: has
not yet come to me..."</p>

<p>"He is very ill, mother..."</p>

<p>The old lady made a movement as though wishing to rise, and
into her archangel eyes there came an angry glitter.</p>

<p>"When he came here recently," she said, "he was as healthy as
a tree in bloom. What ails him?"</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen got up and began to walk up and down the room.
He smelt the perfume of flowers streaming up from the garden
through the open window as something inflicting pain which
ripped his forehead into lines.</p>

<p>"I do not know," he said suddenly, quite disjointedly, "how
this girl could have stepped into his life. I do not know how
she won this monstrous hold over him. But I heard from his own
lips how he said to her: My father no longer has a son,
Maria..."</p>

<p>"Freder does not lie, Joh. So you have lost him already."</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen did not answer. He thought of Rotwang. He had
said the same words to him.</p>

<p>"Is it about this that you have come to me, Joh?" asked his
mother. "Then you could have spared yourself the trouble. Freder
is Hel's son. Yes...That means he has a soft heart But he is
yours too, Joh. That means he has a skull of steel. You know
best, Joh, how much obstinacy a man can summon up to attain to
the woman he wants."</p>

<p>"You cannot make that comparison, mother. Freder is almost a
boy, still. When I took Hel to me I was a man, and knew what I
was doing. Hel was more needful to me than the air to breathe I
could not do without Hel, Mother. I would have stolen her from
the arms of God himself."</p>

<p>"From God, Joh, you can steal nothing, but something can be
stolen from man. You have done that. You have sinned, Joh. You
have sinned towards your friend. For Hel loved Rotwang and it
was you who compelled her."</p>

<p>"When she was dying, mother, she loved me...."</p>

<p>"Yes. When she saw that you, too, were a man, when your head
was beating against the floor and you were crying out. But do
you believe, Joh, that this one smile in her dying hour
outweighs all that which brought about her death?"</p>

<p>"Leave me my belief, Mother..."</p>

<p>"Delusion..."</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen looked at his mother.</p>

<p>"I should very much like to know," he said with darkened
voice, "on what you feed your cruelty towards, me, mother."</p>

<p>"On my fears for you, Joh&mdash;on my fears!"</p>

<p>"You need have no fears for me, mother..."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Joh&mdash;oh yes! Your sin walks behind you like a
good dog on the trail. It does not lose your scent, Joh&mdash;it
remains always and always at your back. A friend is unarmed
against his friend. He has no shield before his breast, nor
armour before his heart. A friend who believes in his friend is
a defenceless man. A defenceless man was it whom you betrayed,
Joh."</p>

<p>"I have paid for my sin, mother...Hel is dead. Now I have
only Freder left. That is her legacy. I will not give up Hel's
legacy. I have come to you to beg of you, mother: help me to win
Freder back."</p>

<p>The old lady's eyes were fixed on him, sparkingly.</p>

<p>"What did you answer me, Joh, when I wanted to stop you on
your way to Hel?"</p>

<p>"I don't remember."</p>

<p>"But I do, Joh! I still remember every syllable. You said: 'I
don't hear a word you say&mdash;! only hear Hel! If I were to be
blinded&mdash;! should still see Hel! If I were to be
paralysed&mdash;with paralysed feet, I should still find my way
to Hel!&mdash;' Freder is your son. What do you think, Joh, he
would answer me were I to say to him: give up the girl you
love...?"</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen was silent.</p>

<p>"Take care, Joh," said the old mother. "I know what it means
when your eyes grow cold, as now, and when you grow as pale as
one of the stones of the wall. You have forgotten that lovers
are sacred. Even if they are mistaken, Joh, their mistake itself
is sacred. Even if they are fools, Joh, their folly itself is
sacred. For where lovers are, there is God's garden, and no one
has the right to drive them out Not even God. Only their own
sin."</p>

<p>"I must have my son back," said Joh Fredersen. "I had hoped
you would help me, and you would certainly have been the
gentlest means I could have chosen. But you will not, and now I
must seek another means..."</p>

<p>"Freder is ill, you say..."</p>

<p>"He will get well again..."</p>

<p>"So you will continue in your way?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I believe, Joh, that Hel would weep were she to hear
you!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps. But Hel is dead."</p>

<p>"Well, come here to me, Joh! I will give you a word to take
with you on your way, which you cannot forget. It is easy to
retain."</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen hesitated. Then he walked up to his mother. She
laid her hand on the bible which lay before her. Joh Fredersen
read:...Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he reap...</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen turned around. He walked through the room. His
mother's eyes followed him. As he turned toward her, suddenly,
violently, with a violent word on his lips he found the gaze of
her eyes set upon him. They could hide themselves no longer, and
neither did they wish to&mdash;such an almighty love&mdash;such
an almighty love, in their tear-washed depths that Joh Fredersen
believed himself to see his mother to-day for the first
time.</p>

<p>They looked at each other for a long time, in silence.</p>

<p>Then the man stepped up to his mother.</p>

<p>"I am going, now, mother," he said, "and I don't believe I
shall ever come to you again...."</p>

<p>She did not answer.</p>

<p>It seemed as though he wanted to stretch out his hand to her,
but, half-way he let it drop again.</p>

<p>"For whom are you crying, mother," he asked, "for Freder or
for me?"</p>

<p>"For you both," said the mother, "for you both, Joh..." He
stood in silence and the struggle of his heart was in his face.
Then, without giving his mother another look, he turned around
and went out of the house, over which the walnut tree
rustled.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="first">IT was midnight and no light was burning. Only
through the window there fell the radiance of the city, lying
like a pale gleam upon the face of the girl who sat, leaning
back against the wall, without moving, with closed eyelids, her
hands in her lap.</p>

<p>"Will you never answer me?" asked the great inventor.</p>

<p>Stillness. Silence. Immobility.</p>

<p>"You are colder than stone, harder than any stone. The tip of
your finger must cut through the diamond as though it were
water...I do not implore your love. What does a girl know of
love? Her unstormed fortresses&mdash;her unopened
Paradises&mdash;her sealed-up books, whom no one knows but the
god who wrote them&mdash;what do you know of love? Women know
nothing of love either. What does light know of light? Flame of
burning? What do the stars know of the laws, by which they
wander? You must ask chaos&mdash;coldness, darkness, the eternal
unredeemed which wrestles for the redemption of itself. You must
ask the man what love is. The hymn of Heaven is only composed in
Hell...! do not implore your love, Maria. But your pity, you
motherly one, with the virgin face..."</p>

<p>Stillness. Silence. Immobility.</p>

<p>"I hold you captive...Is that my fault? I do not hold you
captive for myself, Maria. Above you and me there is a Will
which forces me into being evil. Have pity on him who must be
evil, Maria! All the springs of good within me are choked up. I
thought them to be dead; but they are only buried alive. My
being is a rock of darkness. But deep within the sad stone I
hear the springs rushing...If I defy the Will which is above you
and me...If I destroy the work I created after your image...It
would only be what Joh Fredersen deserves and it would be better
for me!...He has ruined me, Maria&mdash;he has ruined me! He
stole the woman from me, who was mine, and whom I loved. I do
not know if her soul was ever with me. But her pity was with me
and made me good. Joh Fredersen took the woman from me. He made
me evil. He, who grudged the stone the imprint of her shoe, made
me evil to take her pity from me. Hel is dead. But she loved
him. What a fearful law it is by which the beings of Light turn
themselves to those of Darkness, but pass \ by those in the
shade. Be more merciful than Hel was, Maria! I will defy the
Will which is above you and me. I will open the doors for you.
You will be able to go where you list and nobody shall stop you.
But would you remain with me of your own free will, Maria? I
long to be good...will you help me?"</p>

<p>Stillness. Silence. Immobility.</p>

<p>"Neither do I implore your pity, Maria. There is nothing on
earth more incompassionate than a woman who only loves one
single being...You cool murderesses in the name of Love...You
goddesses of Death, with your smile!...The hands of your Beloved
are cold. You ask: 'Shall I warm your hands for you, Beloved?'
You do not wait for his 'Yes.' You set fire to a city. You burn
down a kingdom, so that you can warm the hands of your Beloved
at its blaze...You rise up and pluck from the heaven of the
world its most radiant stars, without caring that you destroy
the Universe and put the dance of the Eternal out of balance.
'Do you want the stars&mdash;Beloved?' And if he says 'No' then you
let the stars fall...Oh! you blessed harmdoers! You may step,
fearfully inviolable, before the throne of God and say: 'Get up,
Creator of the World! I need the throne of the World for my
beloved!...' You do not see who dies by your side if only the
one is living. A drop of blood on the finger of your Beloved
frightens you more than the destruction of a continent...All
this I know, and have never possessed it. I...I&mdash;No, I do
not call upon your pity, Maria. But I call upon your
fidelity..."</p>

<p>Still. Silence. Immobility.</p>

<p>"Do you know the subterranean City of the Dead? There, I used
a girl called Maria, nightly to call her brothers together. I
Her brothers wear the blue linen uniform, the black caps, I the
hard shoes. Maria spoke to her brothers of a mediator, who would
come to deliver them. 'The Mediator between Brain and Hands must
be the Heart...' Wasn't it so?&mdash;The brothers of the girl
believed in the girl. They waited. They waited long. But the
mediator did not come. And the girl did not come. She sent no
message. She was not to be found. But the brothers believed in
the girl, for they had found her as true as gold. 'She will
come!' they said. 'She will come again! She is faithful. She
will not leave us alone! She said: 'The mediator will
come!'...Now he must come...Let us be patient and let us
wait'...! But the mediator did not come. And&mdash;the girl did
not come. The misery of the brothers has grown from day to day.
Where once a thousand murmured&mdash;now murmur ten thousand.
They will no more be fed with hope. They languish for fight, for
destruction, for ruin, for downfall. And even the believers,
even the patient ones ask: 'Where is Maria? Can it be that gold
is faithless?' Will you leave them without an answer,
Maria?"</p>

<p>Stillness. Silence. Immobility.</p>

<p>"You are silent...You are very obstinate...But now I shall
tell you something which will surely break your obstinacy...Do
you think I am holding you captive here for fun? Do you think
Joh Fredersen knew no other way of getting you out of his son's
sight than shutting you up behind the Solomon's seal on my
doors? On no, Maria&mdash;oh no, my beautiful Maria! We have not
been idle all these days. We have stolen your beautiful soul
from you&mdash;your sweetsoul, that tender smile of God. I have
listened to you as the air has listened to you. I have seen you
angry and in the depths of despair. I have seen you burning and
dull as the earth. I have listened to you praying to God, and
have cursed God because he did not hear you. I have intoxicated
myself with your helplessness. Your pitiful weeping has made me
drunken. When you sobbed the name of your Beloved, I thought I
must die, and reeled...And thus, as one intoxicated, as one
drunken, as one reeling, I became a thief of you, Maria, I
created you anew&mdash;! became your second God! I have stolen
you absolutely! In the name of Joh Fredersen, the Master over
the great Metropolis, have I stolen your ego from you, Maria.
And this stolen ego&mdash;your other self&mdash;sent a message to your
brothers, calling them by night into the City of the
Dead&mdash;and they all came. When you spoke to them before,'
you spoke for Peace...but Joh Fredersen does not want Peace any
more&mdash;do you see?&mdash;He wants the decision! The hour has
come! Your stolen ego; may not speak for Peace any more. The
mouth of Joh Fredersen speaks from out it...And among your
brothers there will be one who loves you and who will not
realize&mdash;who will not doubt you, Maria...Only just give me
your hands, Maria&mdash;only your hands, no more...I do not ask
for more...your hands must be wondrous. Pardon is the name of
the right, Redemption of the left...If you give me your hands I
will go with you into the City of the Dead, so that you can warn
your brothers, so that you can unmask your stolen ego&mdash;so
that the one who loves you finds you again and does not have to
doubt you...Did you say anything, Maria?"</p>

<p>He heard the soft, soft weeping of the girl. He fell, where
he stood, upon his knees. He wanted to drag himself along on his
knees to the girl. And suddenly stopped still. He listened. He
stared. He said in a voice which was almost like a shriek, in
its wide-awake attention:</p>

<p>"Maria...? Maria&mdash;don't you hear...? There's a strange
man in the room..."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the quiet voice of Joh Fredersen.</p>

<p>And then the hands of Joh Fredersen seized the throat of
Rotwang, the great inventor...</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="first">A VAULT, like the vault of a
sepulchre&mdash;human heads so closely crowded as to produce the
effect of clods of a freshly ploughed field. All faces turned to
one point: to the source of a light, as mild as God. Candles
burnt with sword&mdash;Like flames. Slender, lustrous swords of
light stood in a circle around the head of a girl.</p>

<p>Freder stood pressed into the background of the arch&mdash;so far
from the girl that he perceived of her face nothing but the
shimmer of its pallor, the wonder of the eyes and the blood-red
mouth. His eyes hung upon this blood-red mouth as though it were
the middle point of the earth, to which, by eternal law, his
blood must pour down. Tantalising was this mouth...All the seven
Deadly Sins had such a mouth...The woman on the scarlet-coloured
beast, who bore the name Babylon on her forehead, had such a
mouth...</p>

<p>He pressed both hands to his eyes in order no longer to see
this mouth of deadly sin.</p>

<p>Now he heard more clearly...Yes, that was her voice, the
voice which sounded as though God could refuse it nothing...Was
that really it? The voice came from out the blood-red mouth. It
was like a flame, hot and pointed. It was full of a wicked
sweetness...</p>

<p>The voice said: "My brothers..."</p>

<p>But no peace proceeded from out these words. Little red
snakes hissed through the air. The air was hot&mdash;an agony to
breathe..</p>

<p>Groaning heavily, Freder opened his eyes.</p>

<p>Dark, angry waves were the heads before him. These waves
frothed, raged and roared. Here and there a hand shot up into
the air. Words sprang up, foam flecks of the surf. But the voice
of the girl was like a tongue of fire, drawing, enticing,
burning above the heads.</p>

<p>"Which is more pleasant: water or wine?"</p>

<p>"...Wine is more pleasant!"</p>

<p>"Who drinks the water?"</p>

<p>"...We!"</p>

<p>"Who drinks the wine?"</p>

<p>"...The masters! The masters of the machines!"</p>

<p>"Which is more pleasant: meat or dry bread?"</p>

<p>"...Meat is more pleasant!"</p>

<p>"Who eats the dry bread?"</p>

<p>"...We!"</p>

<p>"Who eats the meat?"</p>

<p>"...The masters! The masters of the machines!"</p>

<p>"Which is more pleasant to wear: blue linen or white
silk?"</p>

<p>"...White silk is more pleasant to wear!"</p>

<p>"Who wears the blue linen?"</p>

<p>"...We!"</p>

<p>"Who wears the white silk?"</p>

<p>"...The masters! The sons of the masters!"</p>

<p>"Where is it more pleasant to live: upon or under the
earth?"</p>

<p>"...It is more pleasant to live upon the earth!"</p>

<p>"Who lives under the earth?"</p>

<p>"...We!"</p>

<p>"Who lives upon the earth?"</p>

<p>"...The masters! The masters of the machines!"</p>

<p>"Where are your wives?"</p>

<p>"...In misery!"</p>

<p>"Where are your children?"</p>

<p>"...In misery!"</p>

<p>"What do your wives do?"</p>

<p>"...They starve!"</p>

<p>"What do your children do?"</p>

<p>"...They cry!"</p>

<p>"What do the wives of the masters of the machines do?"</p>

<p>"...They feast!"</p>

<p>"What do the children of the masters of the machines do?"</p>

<p>"...They play!"</p>

<p>"Who are the providers?"</p>

<p>"...We!"</p>

<p>"Who are the squanderers?"</p>

<p>"...The masters! The masters of the machines!"</p>

<p>"What are you?"</p>

<p>"...Slaves!"</p>

<p>"No!&mdash;what are you?"</p>

<p>"...Dogs!"</p>

<p>"No!&mdash;what are you?"</p>

<p>"...Tell us!&mdash;tell us!"</p>

<p>"You are fools! Blockheads! Blockheads! Throughout your
morning, your midday, your evening, your night, the machine
howls for food, for food, for food&mdash;! You are the food! You
are the living food!&mdash;The machine devours you like fodder
and then spews you up again! Why do you batten the machines with
your bodies?&mdash;Why do you oil the joints of the machines
with your brains?&mdash;Why do you not let the machines starve,
you fools?&mdash;Why do you not let them perish,
blockheads&mdash;? Why do you feed them&mdash;! The more you
feed them the more they greed for your flesh, for your bones,
for your brains. You are ten thousand! You are a hundred
thousand! Why do you not throw yourselves&mdash;a hundred
thousand murdering fists&mdash;upon the machines and strike them
dead&mdash;? Yaw are the masters of the machines&mdash;you! Not
the others who walk in their white silk&mdash;! Turn the world
about&mdash;! Stand the world on its head&mdash;! Murder the
living and the dead&mdash;! Take the inheritance from living and
dead&mdash;I You have waited long enough&mdash;! The hour has
come!"</p>

<p>A voice shouted from among the multitude:</p>

<p>"Lead us on, Maria&mdash;!"</p>

<p>A mighty wave&mdash;all the heads broke forward. The blood-red
mouth of the girl laughed and flamed. The eyes above it
flamed, huge and greenish black. She raised her arms with an
unspeakably difficult, burden-raising, sweet, mad gesture. The
slim body grew and stretched itself up. The girl's hands touched
above her hair-parting. Over her shoulders, her breasts, her
hips, her knees, there ran an incessant, a barely perceptible
trembling. It was as though the girl were carried higher and
higher by this trembling, though she did not move her feet.</p>

<p>She said: "Come...I Come...! I will lead you...! I will dance
the dance of Death before you...! I will dance the dance of the
Murderers before you...!"</p>

<p>The multitude moaned. The multitude gasped. The multitude
stretched out its hands. The multitude bowed head and neck low,
as though its shoulders, its backs, should be a carpet for the
girl. The multitude fell on its knees with a groan, one single
beast felled with the hatchet. The girl raised her foot and
stepped upon the neck of the outstretched beast...</p>

<p>A voice shouted out, sobbing with rage and pain:</p>

<p>"You are not Maria&mdash;!"</p>

<p>The multitude turned around. The multitude saw a man standing
in the background of the arch, a man, from whose shoulders the
coat had fallen. Under the coat he wore the white silk. The man
was more ghastly to see than one who has bled to death. He
stretched out his hand and pointed to the girl. He yelled
out:</p>

<p>"You are not Maria!! No&mdash;!! You are not
Maria&mdash;!!"</p>

<p>The heads of the multitude stared at the man who was a
stranger among them, who wore the white silk...</p>

<p>"You are not Maria&mdash;!" he yelled. "Maria preaches
peace&mdash;and not murder&mdash;!"</p>

<p>The eyes of the multitude began to glare dangerously.</p>

<p>The girl stood bolt upright in the neck of the multitude. She
began to totter. It seemed as though she would fall&mdash;fall
over on to her white face in which the blood-red mouth&mdash;the mouth
of deadly sin, flamed like hell-fire.</p>

<p>But she did not fall. She held herself upright. She swayed
slightly, but she held herself upright. She stretched out her
arm and pointed at Freder, calling in a voice which sounded like
glass:</p>

<p>"Look&mdash;! Look&mdash;! The son of Joh Fredersen&mdash;!
The son of Joh Fredersen is among you&mdash;!"</p>

<p>The multitude shouted. The multitude hurled itself around.
The multitude made to lay hold of the son of Joh Fredersen.</p>

<p>He did not resist. He stood pressed against the wall. He
stared at the girl with a gaze in which belief in eternal
damnation was to be read. It seemed as if he were already dead,
and as though his lifeless body were falling, ghostlike upon the
fists of those who wished to murder him.</p>

<p>A voice roared:</p>

<p>"Dog in white silken skin&mdash;!!"</p>

<p>An arm shot up, a knife flashed out...</p>

<p>Upon the billowing neck of the multitude stood the girl. It
was as if the knife came flying from out her eyes...</p>

<p>But, before the knife could plunge into the white silk which
covered the heart of the son of Joh Fredersen, a man threw
himself as a shield before his breast, and the knife ripped open
blue linen. Blue linen was dyed purple-red...</p>

<p>"Brothers...!" said the man. Dying, yet standing upright, he
was covering the son of Joh Fredersen with his whole body. He
turned his head a little to catch Freder's glance. He said with
a smile which was transfigured in pain:</p>

<p>"Brothers..."</p>

<p>Freder recognised him. It was Georgi. It was number eleven
thousand eight hundred and eleven which was now going out, and
which, going out, was protecting him.</p>

<p>He wanted to push past Georgi. But the dying man stood like
one crucified, with out-stretched arms and hands clawing into
the edge of the niches which were behind him. He held his eyes,
which were like jewels, fixedly set on the multitude which was
storming towards him.</p>

<p>"Brothers..." he said.</p>

<p>"He said: 'Murderers...Brother murderers...'" said the dying
mouth.</p>

<p>The multitude left him alone and raced on. On the shoulders
of the multitude the girl was dancing and singing. She sang with
her blood-red mouth of deadly sin!</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">"We've passed sentence upon the machines!<br>
We have condemned the machines to death!<br>
The machines must die&mdash;to hell with them!<br>
Death!&mdash;Death!&mdash;Death to the machines&mdash;!"</p>

<p><br>
Like the rush of a thousand wings the step of the multitude
thundered through the narrow passages of the City of the Dead.
The girl's voice died away. The steps died away. Georgi loosened
his hands and pitched forward.</p>

<p>Freder caught him. He sank upon his knee. Georgi's head fell
upon his breast.</p>

<p>"Warn...warn..the town..." said Georgi.</p>

<p>"And are you dying&mdash;?" gave Freder as answer. His
bewildered eyes ran along the walls in the niches of which slept
the thousand-year-old dead. "There is no justice in this
world!"</p>

<p>"Uttermost justice..." said eleven thousand eight hundred and
eleven. "From weakness&mdash;sin...From sin&mdash;atonement...Warn
the town!&mdash;Warn...!"</p>

<p>"I'm going to leave you alone&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"I beg you to...beg you&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Freder got up, despair in his eyes. He ran to the passage, in
which the multitude had died away.</p>

<p>"Not that way&mdash;!" said Georgi. "You won't get through
that way any more&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"I know no other way...."</p>

<p>"I'll take you..."</p>

<p>"You are dying, Georgi! The first step is your
death&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Won't you warn the town? Do you want to be an
accessory?"</p>

<p>"Come!" said Freder.</p>

<p>He raised Georgi up. With his hand pressed to his wound, the
man began to run.</p>

<p>"Pick up your lamp and come!" said Georgi. He ran so that
Freder could hardly follow him. Into the ten-thousand-year-old
dust dripped the blood which welled up from the freshly
inflicted wound. He held Freder's arm clasped, pulling him
forwards.</p>

<p>"Hurry!" he murmured. "Hurry&mdash;there's not time to
lose!"</p>

<p>Passages&mdash;crossings&mdash;passages&mdash;
steps&mdash;passages&mdash;a flight of stairs which led steeply
upward...Georgi fell at the first step. Freder wanted to hold
him. He pushed him away.</p>

<p>"Hurry!" he said. He indicated the stairs with his head.
"Up&mdash;! You can't go wrong now...hurry up&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"And you, Georgi?&mdash;and you&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;" said Georgi, turning his head to the wall&mdash;"I
am not going to answer any more questions..."</p>

<p>Freder let go of Georgi's hand. He began to run up the
stairs. Night embraced him&mdash;the night of Metropolis&mdash;this
light-mad, drunken night.</p>

<p>Everything was still the same as usual. Nothing indicated the
storm which was to break out from inside the earth, under
Metropolis, to murder the machine-city.</p>

<p>But it seemed to Joh Fredersen's son as if the stones were
giving way under his feet&mdash;as though he heard in the air
the rushing of wings&mdash;the rushing of the wings of strange
monsters: beings with women's bodies and snakes'
heads&mdash;beings, half bull, half angel&mdash;devils adorned
with crowns&mdash;human faced lions....</p>

<p>It seemed to him as if he saw death sitting on the New Tower
of Babel, in hat and wide cloak, whetting his propped up
scythe..</p>

<p>He reached the New Tower of Babel. Everything was as usual.
The Dawn was fighting the first fight with the Early Morning. He
looked for his father. He did not find him. Nobody could say
where Joh Fredersen had gone at midnight.</p>

<p>The brain-pan of the New Tower of Babel was empty.</p>

<p>Freder wiped from his brow the sweat which was running in
drops over his temples.</p>

<p>"I must find my father&mdash;!" he said. "I must call
him&mdash;cost what it may!"</p>

<p>Men, with servants eyes looked at him. Men who knew nothing
apart from blind obedience&mdash;who could not advise, still
less help...</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen's son stepped into his father's place, at the
table where his great father used to sit. He was as white as the
silk which he wore as he stretched out his hand and pressed his
fingers on the little blue metal place, which no man ever
touched apart from Joh Fredersen.</p>

<p>...Then the great Metropolis began to roar. Then she raised
her voice&mdash;her Behemoth-voice. But she was not screaming
for food&mdash;no, she was roaring: Danger...</p>

<p>Above the gigantic city, above the slumbering city, the
monster-voice roared: Danger&mdash;! Danger&mdash;!</p>

<p>A barely perceptible trembling ran through the New Tower of
Babel, as if the earth which bore it were shuddering, frightened
by a dream, betwixt sleeping and waking....</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="first">MARIA did not dare to stir. She did not even
dare to breathe She did not close her eyes for quaking fear
that, between the lowering and raising of her eyelids, a fresh
horror could come upon her and seize her.</p>

<p>She did not know how much time had elapsed since the hands of
Joh Fredersen had closed around the throat of Rotwang, the great
inventor. The two men had been standing in the shadow; and yet
it seemed to the girl as if the outline of both of their forms
had remained behind in the darkness, in fiery lines: The bulk of
Joh Fredersen, standing there, his hands thrown forward, like
two claws;&mdash;Rotwang's body, which hung in these claws, and
which was dragged away&mdash;pulled forth&mdash;through the
frame of the door, which closed behind them both.</p>

<p>What was happening behind this door?...</p>

<p>She heard nothing. She listened with all her senses&mdash;but
she heard nothing, not the least sound....</p>

<p>Minutes passed&mdash;endless minutes...There was nothing to
be heard, neither step nor cry...</p>

<p>Was she breathing, wall to wall, with murder?</p>

<p>Ah&mdash;that clutch at Rotwang's neck...That form, being
dragged away, pulled from darkness into deeper darkness....</p>

<p>Was he dead?...Was he lying behind that door, in a corner,
face twisted around to his back, with broken neck and glazed
eyes? Was the murderer still standing behind that door?</p>

<p>The room, in which she was seemed suddenly to become filled
with the sound of a dull thumping. It grew louder and louder,
more and more violent. It deafened the ears and yet remained
dull...Gradually she realised: It was her own heart-beat...If
somebody had come into the room, she would not have heard him,
her heart was beating so.</p>

<p>Stammered words of a childish prayer passed through her
brain, confusedly and senselessly..."Dear God, I pray Thee, bide
with me, take care of me, Amen."...She thought of
Freder...No&mdash;don't cry, don't cry&mdash;!</p>

<p>"Dear God, I pray Thee...."</p>

<p>This silence was no longer bearable! She must see&mdash;must
be certain.</p>

<p>But she did not dare to take a step. She had got up and could
not find courage to return to her old seat. She was as though
sewn into a black sack. She held her arms pressed close to her
body. Horrors stood at her neck and blew at her.</p>

<p>Now she heard&mdash;yes, she heard something. Yet the sound
did not come from inside the house; it came from far away. This
sound even penetrated the walls of Rotwang's house, which were
otherwise penetrated by no sound, wherever it came from.</p>

<p>It was the voice of Metropolis. But she was screaming what
she had never screamed before.</p>

<p>She was not screaming for food. She was screaming:
Danger&mdash;! Danger&mdash;! The screaming did not stop. It
howled on, incessantly. Who had dared to unchain the voice of
the great Metropolis, which otherwise obeyed no one but Joh
Fredersen? Was Joh. Fredersen no longer in this house? Or was
this voice to call him?&mdash;this wild roar of: Danger&mdash;!
Danger&mdash;! What danger was threatening Metropolis? Fire
could not be alarming the city, to make her roar so, as though
she had gone mad. No high tide was threatening Metropolis. These
elements were subdued and quiet.</p>

<p>Danger&mdash;of man?...Revolt&mdash;?</p>

<p>Was that it&mdash;?</p>

<p>Rotwang's words fluttered through her brain...In the City of
the Dead&mdash;what was going on in the City of the Dead? Did
the uproar come from the City of the Dead? Was destruction
welling up from the depths?</p>

<p>Danger&mdash;! Danger&mdash;! screamed the voice of the great
city.</p>

<p>As though by power of a thrust within, Maria ran, all at
once, to the door and tore it open. The room which lay before
her, just as that which she had left, received its solitary
light&mdash;and sparely enough&mdash;through the window. At the
first glance round, the room seemed to be empty. A strong
current of air, coming from an invisible source, streamed, hot
and even, through the room, bringing in the roaring of the town
with renewed force.</p>

<p>Maria stooped forward. She recognised the room. She had run
along these walls in her despairing search for a door. There was
a door, which had neither bolt nor lock. Copper-red, in the
gloomy wood of the door, glowed the seal of Solomon, the
pentagram. There, in the middle, was a square, the trap-door,
through which, some time ago, a period which she could not
measure, she had entered the house of the great inventor. The
bright square of the window fell upon the square of the
door.</p>

<p>A trap, thought the girl. She turned her head around....</p>

<p>Would the great Metropolis never stop roaring&mdash;?</p>

<p>Danger&mdash;! Danger&mdash;! Danger&mdash;! roared the
town.</p>

<p>Maria took a step, then stopped again.</p>

<p>There was something lying over there. There was something
lying there on the floor. Between her and the trap-door,
something was lying on the floor. It was an unrecognisable heap.
It was something dark and motionless. It might be human, and
was, perhaps, only a sack. But it lay there and must be passed
around if one wanted to reach the trap-door.</p>

<p>With a greater display of courage than had ever before in her
life been necessary, Maria silently set one foot before the
other. The heap on the floor did not move...She stood, bending
far forward, making her eyes reconnoitre, deafened by her own
heart-beat and the roar of the uproar-proclaiming city.</p>

<p>Now she saw clearly; What was lying there was a man. The man
lay on his face, legs drawn tightly to his body, as though he
had gathered them to him to push himself up and had then not
found any more strength to do it. One hand lay thrown over his
neck, and its crooked fingers spoke more eloquently than the
most eloquent of mouths of a wild self-defence.</p>

<p>But the other hand of the heap of humanity lay stretched far
away from it, on the square of the trapdoor, as though wishing,
in itself, to be a bolt to the door. The hand was not of flesh
and bone. The hand was of metal, the hand was the master-piece
of Rotwang, the great inventor.</p>

<p>Maria threw a glance at the door, on which the seal of
Solomon glowed. She ran up to it, although she knew it to be
pointless to implore this inexorable door for liberty. She felt,
under her feet, distant, quite dull, strong and impelling, a
shake, as of distant thunder.</p>

<p>The voice of the great Metropolis roared: Danger&mdash;!
Maria clasped her hands and raised them to her mouth. She ran up
to the trap-door. She knelt down. She looked at the heap of
humanity which lay at the edge of the trapdoor. She knelt down.
She looked at the heap of humanity which lay at the edge of the
trap-door, the metal hand of which seemed obstinately to be
defending the trap-door. The fingers of the other hand, thrown
over the man's neck, were turned towards her, poised high, like
a beast before the spring.</p>

<p>And the trembling shake again&mdash;and now much mightier&mdash;
Maria seized the iron ring of the trap-door. She pushed it up.
She wanted to pull up the door. But the hand&mdash;the hand
which lay upon it&mdash;held the door clutched fast.</p>

<p>Maria heard the chattering of her teeth. She pushed herself
across on her knees towards the motionless heap of humanity.
With infinite care, she grasped the hand which lay, as a steel
bolt, across the trap-door. She felt the coldness of death
proceeding from this hand. She pressed her teeth into her white
lips. As she pushed back the hand with all her strength, the
heap of humanity rolled over on its side, and the grey face
appeared, staring upwards...</p>

<p>Maria tore open the trap-door. She swung herself down, into
the black square. She did not leave herself time to close the
door. Perhaps it was that she had not the courage, once more to
emerge from the depths she had gained, to see what lay up there,
at the edge of the trap-door. She felt the steps under her feet,
and felt, right and left, the damp walls. She ran through the
darkness, thinking only half-consciously: If you lose your way
in the City of the Dead....</p>

<p>The red shoes of the magician occurred to her...</p>

<p>She forced herself to stand still, forced herself to
listen....</p>

<p>What was that strange sound which seemed to be coming, from
the passages round about?...It sounded like yawning&mdash;It
sounded as though the stone were yawning. There was a
trickling...above her head a light grating sound grew audible,
as though joint upon joint were loosening itself...Then all was
still for a while. But not for long. Then the grating sound
began again...</p>

<p>The stone was living. Yes&mdash;the stone was living...The
stones of the City of the Dead were coming to life.</p>

<p>The shock of extreme violence shook the earth on which Maria
was standing. Rumbling of falling stones, trickling,
silence.</p>

<p>Maria was pitched against the stone wall. But the wall moved
behind her. Maria shrieked. She threw up her arms and raced
onwards. She stumbled over stones which lay across her way, but
she did not fall. She did not know what was happening but the
rustle of mystery which the storm drives along before
it&mdash;the proclamation of a great evil, hung in the air above
her, driving her forward.</p>

<p>There&mdash;a light in front of her! She ran towards it. An
arched vault...Great burning candles...Yes, she knew the place.
She had often stood here and spoken to those whom she called
"brothers."...Who, but she, had the right to light these
candles? For whom had they burnt today? The flames blew sideways
in a violent draught of air; the wax dropped.</p>

<p>Maria seized a candle and ran on with it. She came to the
background of the arched vault. A coat lay on the floor. None of
her brothers wore such a coat over his blue linen uniform. She
bent down. She saw, in the thousand-year-old dust of the arched
vault, a trail of dark drops. She stretched out her hand and
touched one of the drops. The tip of her finger was dyed red.
She straightened herself up and closed her eyes. She staggered a
little and a smile passed over her face as though she hoped she
were dreaming.</p>

<p>"Dear God, I pray Thee, bide with me, take care of
me...Amen..."</p>

<p>She leant her head against the stone wall. The wall quaked.
Maria looked right up. In the dark, black vaulting of the stone
roof above her, there gaped a winding cleft.</p>

<p>What did that mean...?</p>

<p>What was there&mdash;above her?</p>

<p>Up there were the mole-tunnels of the underground railway.
What was happening up there&mdash;? It sounded as though three
thousand giants were playing nine-pins with iron mountains,
throwing them, one against the other, amid yells...</p>

<p>The cleft gaped wider. The air was filled with dust. But it
was not dust. It was ground stone.</p>

<p>The structure of the City of the Dead quaked right down to
the centre of the earth. It was as if a mighty fist had suddenly
opened a sluice&mdash;but, instead of water, a maelstrom of
stones hurtled from the dammed-up bed&mdash;blocks, mortar,
crumbles, stone-splinters, ruins poured down from the
arch&mdash;a curtain of stones&mdash;a hail of stones. And above
the falling and the smashing was the power of a thunder which
was roaring, and roaring long and resonantly, through the
destruction.</p>

<p>A current of air, an irresistible whirl, swept the girl aside
like a blade of straw. The skeletons rose up from the niches:
bones rose up erect and skulls rolled! Doomsday seemed to be
breaking over the thousand-year-old City of the Dead.</p>

<p>But above the great Metropolis the monster-voice was still
howling and howling.</p>

<p>Red lay the morning above the stone ocean of the city. The
red morning saw, amidst the stone ocean of the city, rolling
along, a broad, an endless stream.</p>

<p>The stream was twelve files deep. They walked in even step.
Men, men, men, all in the same uniform; from throat to ankle in
the dark blue linen, bare feet in the same hard shoes, hair
tightly pressed down by the same black caps.</p>

<p>And they all had the same faces. Wild faces, with eyes like
fire-brands. And they all sang the same song&mdash;song without
melody, but an oath&mdash;a storm vow:</p>

<br>
<p class="verse">"We've passed sentence upon the machines!<br>
We have condemned the machines to death!<br>
The machines must die&mdash;to hell with them!<br>
Death!&mdash;Death!&mdash;Death to the machines&mdash;!"</p>

<p><br>
The girl danced along before the streaming, bawling
multitude.</p>

<p>She led the multitude on. She led the tramping multitude
forward against the heart of the Machine city of Metropolis.</p>

<p>She said: "Come...! Come...! Come...! I will lead you...II
will dance the dance of Death before you...I will dance the
dance of the murderers before you...!"</p>

<p>"Destroy&mdash;destroy&mdash;destroy&mdash;!" yelled the
crowd.</p>

<p>They acted without plan, and yet following a law. Destruction
was the name of the law; they obeyed it.</p>

<p>The multitude divided. A broad stream poured itself,
frothing, down into the tunnel of the underground railway.</p>

<p>The trains were standing ready on all the tracks.
Searchlights wedged themselves into the darkness which crouched
in the shafts, above the rails.</p>

<p>The multitude yelled. Here was a plaything for giants! Were
they not as strong as three thousand giants? They dragged the
drivers from the drivers' places. They released the trains and
let them run&mdash;one after the other&mdash;forward&mdash;
forwards!</p>

<p>The rails rumbled. The thundering carriage snakes,
glitteringly lighted, hurled along by their emptiness, dashed
into the brownish darkness. Two, three, four of the drivers
fought like men possessed. But the mob sucked them up. "Will you
shut your mouths, you dogs&mdash;? We are the masters! We want
to play! We want to play like giants!"</p>

<p>They howled the song&mdash;the song of their deadly
hatred:</p>

<p class="verse">"We've passed sentence upon the machines!<br>
We have condemned the machines to death!"</p>

<p>They counted the seconds:</p>

<p>"Fifty-nine&mdash;sixty&mdash;sixty-one&mdash;sixty-two&mdash;
now&mdash;!&mdash;Somewhere in the depths of the tunnel, a crash,
as if the globe were splitting...Once&mdash;and once again...The
mob howled:"</p>

<p class="verse">"The machines must die&mdash;to hell with them!<br>
Death!&mdash;Death!&mdash;Death to the machines&mdash;!"</p>

<p><br>
Then&mdash;! What happened then?&mdash;Then!!&mdash;From one of the
tunnels there broke forth a train, like a steed of fire, with
sparkling lights, driverless, at a tearing speed&mdash;galloping
death.</p>

<p>From whence did this hell-horse come?&mdash;Where were the
giants, who were thus giving answer to the giants' game of the
mob? The train vanished, amid shrieks&mdash;and, some seconds
later, came the tearing crash from the depths of the pit. And
the second train was crashing onwards, sent off by unknown
hands.</p>

<p>The stones shook loose under the feet of the mob. Smoke
gushed up from the pit. Suddenly the lights went out. Only the
clocks, the whitish-shimmering clocks, hung, as patches of
light, in a darkness which was filled with long, dim, drifting
clouds.</p>

<p>The mob pressed towards the stairs and up them. Behind them,
unchained demons, pulling their reeling carriages along behind
them, the engines, now released, hurled themselves on, to fall
upon each other and break into flames...</p>

<br>

<p>Metropolis had a brain.</p>

<p>Metropolis had a heart.</p>

<p>The heart of the machine city of Metropolis dwelt in a white,
cathedral&mdash;Like building. The heart of the machine city of
Metropolis was guarded by one single man.</p>

<p>The man's name was Grot, and he loved his machine.</p>

<p>The machine was a universe to itself. Above the deep
mysteries of its delicate joints, like the sun's disc, like the
halo of a divine being, stood the silver spinning wheel, the
spokes of which appeared, in the whirl of revolution, as a
single gleaming disc. This disc filled out the back wall of the
building, with its entire breadth and height.</p>

<p>No machine in all Metropolis which did not receive its power
from this heart.</p>

<p>One single lever controlled this marvel of steel. All the
treasures of the world heaped up before him would not, for Grot,
have outweighed this, his machine.</p>

<p>When, at the grey hour of dawn, Grot heard the voice of the
great Metropolis roaring, he glanced at the clock on the brow of
the wall where was the door, and thought: "That's against all
nature and regularity..."</p>

<p>When, at the red hour of sunrise, Grot saw the stream of the
multitude rolling along, twelve files deep, led by a girl&mdash;
dancing to the rhythm of the yelling mob, Grot set the lever of
the machine to "Safety," carefully closed the door of the
building and waited.</p>

<p>The mob thundered against his door.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;knock away!" thought Grot. "That door can stand a
good bit..."</p>

<p>He looked at the machine. The wheel was spinning slowly. The
beautiful spokes were playing, plainly to be seen. Grot nodded
to his beautiful machine.</p>

<p>"They will not trouble us long," thought he. He waited for a
signal from the New Tower of Babel. For a word from Joh
Fredersen. The word did not come.</p>

<p>"He knows," thought Grot, "that he can rely on me..."</p>

<p>The door quaked like a giant drum. The mob hurled itself, a
living battering ram, against it.</p>

<p>"There are rather a lot of them, it seems to me," thought
Grot. He looked at the door, it trembled, but it held. And it
looked as though it would still hold for a long time.</p>

<p>Grot nodded to himself in deep contentment. He would; have
loved to light his pipe, if only smoking had not been forbidden
here. He heard the yelling of the mob, and rebound upon rebound
against the singing door with a feeling of smug fierceness. He
loved the door. It was his ally. He turned around and looked at
his machine. He nodded at it affectionately: "We
two&mdash;eh?...What do you say to that boozy lot of fatheads,
machine?"</p>

<p>The storm before the door wound itself up into a typhoon. It
was the hackling fury born of long resistance.</p>

<p>"Open the door,&mdash;!!" hackled the fury. "Open the door,
you damned scoundrel&mdash;!!"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't that just suit you!" thought Grot. How well the
door was holding! His gallant door!</p>

<p>What were those drunken apes out there singing about? "We've
passed sentence upon the machines! We have condemned the
machines to death!" Ho ho ho&mdash;! He could sing
too&mdash;could Grot! He could sing drunken songs, just fine! He
kicked with both heels against the pedestal of the machine, upon
which he was sitting. He pushed the black cap down lower in his
neck. With his red fists resting upon his knees, opening wide
his mouth, he sang with his whole throat, while his little, wild
eyes were fixed on the door:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">"Come on, you boozy lot, if you dare!<br>
Come if you want a good hiding, you lousy apes!<br>
Your mother forgot<br>
To pull your pants tight<br>
When you were little, you guttersnipes.<br>
You're not even fit for pigs' swill!"<br>
You fell from the rubbish cart.<br>
When it took the big curve!<br>
And now you stand before the door.<br>
Before my gallant door, and bawl:<br>
 Open the door! Open the door!<br>
Let the devil open it for you,<br>
You hen's bugs."</p>

<p><br>
The pedestal of the machine boomed under the drumming rhythm
of his boot-heels...</p>

<p>But suddenly they both stopped: drumming and singing. An
exceedingly powerful, exceedingly white light flared up three
times, under the dome of the building. A sound-signal, as gentle
and as penetrating as the gong-beat of a temple bell, became
audible, overpowering every sound.</p>

<p>"Yes!" said Grot, the guard of the Heart-machine.</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet. He raised his broad face, which shone
with the joyful eagerness of obedience. "Yes, here I am!"</p>

<p>A voice said, slowly and clearly:</p>

<p>"Open the door, and give up the machine!"</p>

<p>Grot stood motionless. Fists like hammers hung down from his
arms. He gulped. But he said nothing.</p>

<p>"Repeat instructions," said the quiet voice.</p>

<p>The guard of the heart machine swung his head violently this
way and that, like a weighty bundle.</p>

<p>"I...I didn't understand," he said, gaspingly.</p>

<p>The quiet voice spoke in a more forceful tone:</p>

<p>"Open the door and give up the machine!"</p>

<p>The man still said nothing, gazing stupidly upward.</p>

<p>"Repeat instructions," said the quiet voice.</p>

<p>The guard of the Heart-machine drew in a great draught of
air.</p>

<p>"Who is speaking there&mdash;?" he asked. "What lousy swine
is speaking there&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Open the door, Grot..."</p>

<p>"The devil I will&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"...and give up the machine!"</p>

<p>"The machine&mdash;?" said Grot, "the&mdash;my machine?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the quiet voice.</p>

<p>The guard of the Heart-machine began to shake. His was a
quite blue face, in which the eyes stood like whitish balls, The
mob, which was throwing itself, as a buffer, against the ringing
door yelled, hoarse with yelling:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">"The machines must die&mdash;to Hell with them!<br>
Death! Death! Death to the machines!"</p>

<br>

<p>"Who is speaking there?" asked the man, so loudly that his
words were a scream.</p>

<p>"Joh Fredersen is speaking."</p>

<p>"I want the password."</p>

<p>"The password is one thousand and three. The machine is
running on half power. You have set the lever to
'Safety...'"</p>

<p>The guard of the Heart-machine stood like a log. Then the log
turned itself clumsily around, staggered to the door, and tore
at the bolts.</p>

<p>The mob heard it. It yelled triumph. The door flew open. The
mob swept aside the man who was standing on its threshold. The
mob hurled itself towards the machine. The mob made to lay hands
upon the machine. A dancing girl was leading the mob on.</p>

<p>"Look&mdash;!" she shouted. "Look&mdash;! The beating heart
of Metropolis! What shall be done to the heart of Metropolis?</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">"We've passed sentence upon the machines!<br>
We have condemned the machines to death!<br>
The machines must die&mdash;to hell with them!"</p>

<br>

<p>But the mob did not catch up the girl's song. The mob stared
over, at the machine&mdash;at the beating heart of the great
machine city, which was called Metropolis, and which they had
fed. They pressed up slowly, as a single body, before the
machine, which gleamed like silver. In the face of the mob stood
hatred. In the face of the mob stood superstitious fear. Desire
for the last destruction stood in the face of the mob.</p>

<p>But before it could take expression Grot, the guard, threw
himself before his machine. There was no filthy word which he
did not raise to chuck into the face of the mob. The dirtiest
term of revilement was not dirty enough for him to apply to the
mob. The mob turned red eyes upon him. The mob glared at him.
The mob saw: The man there, in front of them, was abusing them
in the name of the machine. For them, the man and the machine
melted into one. Man and machine deserved the same hatred. They
pushed forward against man and machine. They seized the man and
meant the machine. They roared him down. They stamped him
underfoot. They dragged him hither and thither and out of the
door. They forgot the machine, for they had the man&mdash;had the
guard of the heart-beat of all the machines thinking that, in
tearing the man away from the Heart-machine, they were tearing
the heart from the breast of the great machine city.</p>

<p>What should be done to the heart of Metropolis?</p>

<p>It should be trodden underfoot by the mob.</p>

<p>"Death!" yelled the victorious mob. "Death to the machines!"
yelled the victorious mob.</p>

<p>They did not see that they no longer had a leader. They did
not see that the girl was missing from the procession.</p>

<p>The girl was standing before the Heart-machine of the city.
Her smile was cool and silver. She stretched out her hand, which
was more delicate than glass, she seized the weighty lever,
which was set to "Safety." She pressed the lever round, still
smiling, then walked out, with light, mad, step.</p>

<p>Behind her the machine began to race. Above the deep
mysteries of its delicate joints, like the sun's disc&mdash;like
the halo of a divine being&mdash;stood the silver racing wheel,
the spokes of which appeared, in the whirl of revolution, as a
single circling disc.</p>

<p>The heart of Metropolis, Joh Fredersen's city, began to run
up a temperature, seized by a deadly illness...</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="first">"FATHER&mdash;!!"</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen's son knew quite well that his father could not
hear him, for he, the son, was standing in the lowest part: of
the pedestal of the New Tower of Babel, whither the twitching
pulse of the street had thrown him, and his father was high,
high, above the boiling of the city, the untouched brain, in the
cool brain-pan. But yet he shouted for him and had to shout, and
his shout, itself, was a cry for help and an accusation.</p>

<p>The round structure of the New Tower of Babel was throwing up
people who pushed out into the street, laughing as if insane.
They were sucked up by the pulp of those in the street. The New
Tower of Babel was deserted. Those who had occupied its rooms
and passages&mdash;those who had been poured by the buckets of
the Pater-noster works down to the depths, up to the
heights&mdash;who had taken up their positions on the
stairs&mdash;who had received instructions and passed them
on&mdash;who had suffocated amidst figures&mdash;who had
listened in to the whispers of the world&mdash;all, all streamed
out from the New Tower of Babel as blood streams out from a cut
vein, until it stood there, horribly empty&mdash;bled white.</p>

<p>But the machines went on living.</p>

<p>Yes, they seemed to be coming to life for the first time.</p>

<p>Freder, who stood&mdash;a crumb of humanity&mdash;alone, in
the hugeness of the round structure, heard the soft, deep,
rushing howl, like the breath of the New Tower of Babel, growing
louder and louder, clearer and clearer, and he saw, on turning
round, that the empty cells of the Pater-noster were speeding
more and more rapidly, more and more hurriedly, upwards and
downwards. Yes, now it was as if these cells, these empty cells,
were dancing upwards and downwards and the howling which
transsected the New Tower of Babel seemed to proceed from out their
empty jaws.</p>

<p>"Father&mdash;!!" shouted Freder. And the whole round
structure roared with him, with all its lungs.</p>

<p>Freder ran, but not to the heights of the Tower. He ran to
the depths, driven by horror and curiosity&mdash;down into the
hell&mdash;guided by luminous pillars&mdash;to the abode of the
Pater-noster machine, which was like Ganesha, the god with the
elephant's head.</p>

<p>The luminous pillars by which he ran did not shine as usual
with their white, icy light. They blinked, they flashed
lightning, they flickered. They burnt with an evil, green light.
The stones, over which he ran, swayed like water. The nearer he
came to the machine-room, the more bellowing did the voice of
the tower become. The walls were baking. The air was colourless
fire. If the door had not burst open by itself&mdash;no human
hand could have opened it, for it was like a glowing curtain of
liquid steel.</p>

<p>Freder held his arm flung before his forehead, as if wishing
to protect his brain from bursting. His eyes sought the
machine&mdash;the machine in front of which he had once stood.
It was crouching in the centre of the howling room. It shone
with oil. It had gleaming limbs. Under the crouching body and
the head which was sunken on its chest, crooked legs rested,
gnome-like, upon the platform. The trunk and legs were
motionless. But the short arms pushed and pushed and pushed,
alternately forwards, backwards, forwards.</p>

<p>And the machine was quite abandoned. Nobody was watching it.
Nobody's hand held the lever. Nobody's gaze was fixed on the
clock, the hands of which chased through the grades as though
gone mad.</p>

<p>"Father&mdash;!!" shouted Freder, about to hurl himself
forward. But at the same moment it was as if the hunched up body
of the wild machine, which was like Ganesha, raised itself up to
a furious height, as though its legs stretched themselves upon
stumpy feet, to make a murderous leap, as though its arms no
longer stretched themselves to push&mdash;no, to seize, to seize
to crush&mdash;as though the howling voice of the New Tower of
Babel broke from the lungs of the Pater-noster machine alone,
howling:</p>

<p>"Murder&mdash;!"</p>

<p>And howling unceasingly:</p>

<p>"Murder&mdash;!"</p>

<p>The flame curtain of the door flew sideways, whistling. The
monster-machine rolled itself down from the platform with
pushing arms. The whole structure of the New Tower of Babel
quivered. The walls shook. The ceiling groaned.</p>

<p>Freder turned around. He threw his arms about his neck and
ran. He saw the luminous pillars stabbing at him. He heard a
rattling gasp at his back and felt the marrow dry up, and ran
and ran. He ran towards doors, pushed them open, slammed them to
behind him and raced onwards.</p>

<p>"Father&mdash;!!" he shouted&mdash;and with a feeling as if
his brain were overturning: "Our Father, Which art in
heaven&mdash;"</p>

<p>Upstairs. Where did these stairs lead to&mdash;? Doors
thundered open, rebounding against walls.</p>

<p>Aaah&mdash;! The temples of the machine-rooms? Deities, the
machines&mdash;the shining Lords&mdash;the god-machines of
Metropolis! All the great gods were living in white temples!
Baal and Moloch and Huitzilopochtli and Durgha! Some frightfully
companionable, some terribly solitary. There&mdash;Juggernaut's
divine car! There&mdash;the Towers of Silence! There&mdash;Mahomet's
curved sword! There&mdash;the crosses of Golgotha!</p>

<p>And not a soul, not a soul in the white rooms. The machines,
these god-machines, left terribly alone. And they were all
living&mdash;yes they were really living&mdash;an enhanced, an
enflamed life.</p>

<p>For Metropolis had a brain.</p>

<p>Metropolis had a heart.</p>

<p>The heart of the machine-city of Metropolis dwelt in a white,
cathedral&mdash;Like building. The heart of the machine-city of
Metropolis was, until this day and this hour, guarded by one
single man. The heart of the machine-city of Metropolis was a
machine and a universe to itself. Above the deep mysteries of
its delicate joints, like the sun's disc&mdash;like the halo of
a divine being&mdash;stood the silver-spinning wheel, the spokes
of which appeared in the whirl of revolution, as a single,
gleaming, disc.</p>

<p>No machine in all Metropolis which did not receive its power
from this heart.</p>

<p>One, single lever controlled this marvel of steel.</p>

<p>With the lever set to "Safety" all the machines would play
with their curbed power, like tame animals. The shimmering
spokes of the sun-wheel would circle, clearly to be
distinguished, above the Heart-machine.</p>

<p>With the lever set to "6"&mdash;and it was generally set
there&mdash;then work would spell slavery. The machines would
roar. The powerful wheel of the Heart-machine would hang, an
apparently motionless mirror of brightest silver, above it. And
the mighty thunder of the machines, produced by the heart-beat
of this one, would arch itself, a second heaven, above
Metropolis, Joh Fredersen's city.</p>

<p>But never, as yet, since the construction of Metropolis, had
the lever been set to "12."</p>

<p>Now it was set to "12." Now the lever was set to "12." A
girl's hand, more delicate than glass, had pressed around the
weighty lever, which was set to "Safety," until it touched "12."
The heart of Metropolis, Joh Fredersen's great city had begun to
run up a temperature, seized by a deadly illness, chasing the
red waves of its fever along to all the machines which were fed
by its pulse.</p>

<p>No machine in all Metropolis which did not receive its power
from this heart.</p>

<p>Then all the god-machines were taken with the fever...</p>

<p>From the Towers of Silence there broke forth the vapour of
decomposition. Blue flames hovered in the space above them. And
the towers, the huge towers, which used otherwise to turn about
but once in the course of the day, tottered; around on their
pedestals in a drunken, spinning dance, full to bursting
point.</p>

<p>Mahomet's curved sword was as circular lightning in the air.
It met with no resistance, it cut and cut. It grew angry because
it had nothing to cut. The power which, squandered too
uselessly, was still increasing, now gathered itself together
and, hissing, sent out snakes, green, hissing snakes, in all
directions.</p>

<p>From the projecting arms of the crosses of Golgotha there
swept long, white, crackling springs of sparks.</p>

<p>Swaying under impacts which had shaken the earth itself, the
unslain, the man-crushing car of Juggernaut began to glide,
began to roll&mdash;checked itself, hanging crookedly on the
platform&mdash;trembled like a ship, perishing on the rocks,
lashed by the breakers&mdash;and shook itself free, amidst
groans.</p>

<p>Then, from their glittering thrones, Baal and Moloch,
Huitzilopochtli and Durgha arose. All the god-machines got up,
stretching their limbs in a fearful liberty. Huitzilopochtli
shrieked for the jewel-sacrifice. Durgha moved eight murderous
arms, crackling the while. Hungry fires smouldered up from the
bellies of Baal and Moloch, licking out of their jaws. And,
roaring like a herd of a thousand buffaloes, at being cheated of
a purpose, Asa Thor swung the infallible hammer.</p>

<p>A lost grain of dust among the soles of the gods, Freder
reeled his way through the white rooms, the roaring temples.</p>

<p>"Father&mdash;!!" he shouted.</p>

<p>And he heard the voice of his father:</p>

<p>"Yes!&mdash;Here I am!&mdash;What do you want?&mdash;Come here to
me!"</p>

<p>"Where are you?"</p>

<p>"Here&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"But I can't see you&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"You must look higher!"</p>

<p>Freder's gaze flitted through the room. He saw his father
standing on a platform, between the outstretched arms of the
crosses of Golgotha from the ends of which long, white,
crackling sprigs of sparks blazed. In the hellish fires his
father's face was as a mask of unmistakable coldness. His eyes
were blue-gleaming steel. Amidst the great, raving machine-gods,
he was a greater god, and lord of all.</p>

<p>Freder ran over to him, but he could not get up to him. He
clung to the foot of the flaming cross. Wild impacts crashed
through the New Tower of Babel.</p>

<p>"Father&mdash;!" shrieked Freder. "Your city is going to
ruin&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen did not answer. The sweeping sprigs of flame
seemed to be breaking from his temples.</p>

<p>"Father&mdash;! Don't you understand&mdash;? Your city is
going to ruin!&mdash;Your machines have come to life!&mdash;They
are dashing the town to pieces&mdash;They are tearing Metropolis
to tatters!&mdash;Do you hear&mdash;? Explosion after
explosion&mdash;! I have seen a street in which the houses were
dancing upon their shattered foundations&mdash;just like Little
children dancing upon the stomach of a laughing giant...A
lava-stream of glowing copper poured itself out from the split-open
tower of your boiler-factory, and a naked man was running before
it, a man whose hair was charred and who was roaring: 'The end
of the world has come&mdash;!' But then he stumbled and the
copper stream overtook him...Where the Jethro works stood, there
is a hole in the earth which is filling up with water. Iron
bridges are hanging in shreds between towers which have lost
their entrails, cranes are dangling on gallows like men hanged.
And the people, incapable of flight as of resistance, are
wandering about among houses and streets, both of which seemed
doomed..."</p>

<p>He clasped his hands about the stem of the cross and threw
his head back into his neck, to see his father quite clearly,
quite openly in the face.</p>

<p>"I cannot believe, father, that there is anything mightier
than you! I have cursed your overwhelming might&mdash;your
overwhelming might which has filled me with horror, from the
bottom of my heart. Now I run to you and ask you on my knees:
Why do you allow Death to lay hands on the city which is
your's&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Because Death has come upon the city by my will."</p>

<p>"By your will&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"The city is to perish&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know why, Freder?"</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>"The city is to go to ruin that you may build it up
again..."</p>

<p>"&mdash;I&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"You."</p>

<p>"Then you are laying the murder of the city on my
shoulders?"</p>

<p>"The murder of the city reposes on the shoulders of those
alone who trampled Grot, the guard of the heart-machine, to
death."</p>

<p>"Did that also take place by your will, father?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"Then you forced them to commit the crime&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"For your sake, Freder; that you could redeem them..."</p>

<p>"And what about those, father, who must die with your dying
city, before I can redeem them!"</p>

<p>"Concern yourself about the living, Freder&mdash;not about
the dead."</p>

<p>"And if the living come to kill you&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"That will not happen, Freder. That will not happen. The way
to me, among the raving god-machines, as you called them, could
only be found by one. And he found it. That was my son."</p>

<p>Freder dropped his head into his hands. He rocked it to and
from as if in pain. He moaned softly. He was about to speak; but
before he could speak a sound ripped the air, which sounded as
though the earth were bursting to pieces. For a moment,
everything in the white room seemed to hover in space, a foot
above the ground&mdash;even Moloch and Baal and Huitzilopochtli
and Durgha, even the hammer of Asa Thor and the Towers of
Silence. The crosses of Golgotha, from the ends of the beams of
which long, white crackling sprigs of sparks were blazing, fell
together and then straightened up again. Then everything crashed
back into its place with furious emphasis. Then all the lights
went out. And from the depths and distance the city howled.</p>

<p>"Father&mdash;!" shouted Freder.</p>

<p>"Yes.&mdash;Here I am.&mdash;What do you want?"</p>

<p>"...I want you to put an end to this nightmare&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Now?&mdash;now&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"But I don't want any more people to suffer&mdash;! You must
help them&mdash;you must save them, father&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"You must save them. Now&mdash;Immediately!"</p>

<p>"Now? no!"</p>

<p>"Then," said Freder, pushing his fists out far before him, as
if pushing something away from him, "then I must seek out the
man who can help me&mdash;even if he is your enemy and
mine."</p>

<p>"Do you mean Rotwang?"</p>

<p>No answer. Joh Fredersen continued:</p>

<p>"Rotwang cannot help you."</p>

<p>"Why not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He is dead."</p>

<p>Silence. Then, tentatively, a strangled voice which
asked:</p>

<p>"Dead...</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How did he come...so suddenly...to die?"</p>

<p>"He died, chiefly, Freder, because he dared to stretch out
his hands toward the girl whom you love."</p>

<p>Trembling fingers fumbled up the stem of the cross.</p>

<p>"Maria, father&mdash;Maria...?"</p>

<p>"So he called her."</p>

<p>"Maria&mdash;was with him?&mdash;In his house&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Freder."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;! see.&mdash;! see&mdash;!...And now&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>"Freder?"</p>

<p>No answer came.</p>

<p>"Freder&mdash;?"</p>

<p>But a shadow ran past the windows of the white machine-cathedral.
It ran, ducked down, hands thrown behind its neck, as
if it feared that Durgha's arms could snatch at it, or that Asa
Thor could hurl his hammer, which never failed, at it from
behind, in order, at Joh Fredersen's command, to prevent its
flight.</p>

<p>It did not penetrate into the consciousness of the fugitive
that all the machines were standing still because the heart, the
unguarded heart of Metropolis, under the fiery lash of the "12,"
had raced itself to Death.</p>

<p class="first">MARIA felt something licking at her feet, like
the tongue of a great, gentle dog. She bent down to fumble for
the animal's head, and felt that it was water into which she was
groping.</p>

<p>From where did the water come? It came silently. It did not
splash. Neither did it throw up waves. It just rose&mdash;unhurriedly,
yet persistently. It was not colder than the air round about. It
lapped about Maria's ankles.</p>

<p>She snatched her feet back. She sat, crouched down,
trembling, listening for the water which could not be heard.
From where did it come?</p>

<p>It was said that a river wound its way deep under the city.
Joh Fredersen had walled up its course when he built the
subterranean city, the wonder of the world, for the workmen of
Metropolis. It was also said that the stream fed a mighty water-basin
and that there were pump-works there, which were powerful
enough, inside of less than ten hours either completely to empty
or to fill the water basin&mdash;in which there was room for a
medium-sized city. One thing was certain&mdash;that, in the
subterranean, workmen's city, the throbbing of these pumps was
constantly to be heard, as a soft, incessant pulse-beat, if one
laid one's head against a wall&mdash;and that, if this pulse-beat
should ever become silent, no other interpretation would be
conceivable than that the pumps had stopped, and that then the
river was rising.</p>

<p>But they had never&mdash;never stopped.</p>

<p>And now&mdash;? From where was the silent water
coming?&mdash;Was it still rising&mdash;?</p>

<p>She bent forward. She did not have to stretch her hand down
very low to touch the cool brow of the water.</p>

<p>Now she felt, too, that it was flowing. It was making its way
with great certainty of aim in one direction. It was making its
way towards the subterranean city&mdash;Old books tell of saintly
women, whose smile at the moment of preparing themselves to gain
the martyr's crown, was of such sweetness that the torturers
fell at their feet and hardened heathens praised the name of
God.</p>

<p>But Maria's smile was, perhaps, of a still sweeter kind. For,
when setting about her race with the silent water, she thought,
not of the crown of eternal bliss, but only of death and of the
man she loved&mdash;</p>

<p>Yes, now the water seemed horribly cool, as her slender feet
dipped down into it, and it murmured as she ran along through
it. It soaked itself into the hem of her dress, clinging tight
and making progress more and more difficult. But that was not
the worst. The worst was that the water also began to have a
voice.</p>

<p>The water quoth: "Do you know, beautiful Maria, that I am
fleeter than the fleetest foot? I am stroking your sweet ankles.
I shall soon clutch at your knees. No one has ever embraced your
tender hips. But I shall do so, and before your steps number a
thousand more. And I do not know, beautiful Maria, if you will
reach your destination before you can refuse me your
breast...</p>

<p>"Beautiful Maria, Doomsday has come! It is bringing the
thousand-year-old dead to life. Know, that I have flooded them
out of their niches and that the dead are floating along behind
you! Do not look round, Maria, do not look round! For two
skeletons are quarrelling about the skull which floats between
them&mdash;swirling around and grinning. And a third, to whom
the skull really belongs, is rearing up within me and falling
upon them both...</p>

<p>"Beautiful Maria, how Sweet are your hips...Is the man whom
you love never to find that out? Beautiful Maria, listen to what
I say to you: only a little to one side of this way, a flight of
stairs leads steeply upward, leading to freedom...Your knees are
trembling...how sweet that is! Do you think to overcome your
weakness by clasping your hands? You call upon God, but believe
me: God does not hear you! Since I came upon the earth as the
great flood, to destroy all in existence but Noah's ark, God has
been deaf to the scream of His creatures. Or did you think I had
forgotten how the mothers screamed then? Have you more
responsibility on your conscience than God on His? Turn back,
beautiful Maria, turn back!</p>

<p>"Now you are making me angry, Maria&mdash;now I shall kill
you! Why are you letting those hot, salty drops fall down into
me? I am clasping you around your breast, but it no longer stirs
me. I want your throat and your gasping mouth! I want your hair
and your weeping eyes!</p>

<p>"Do you believe you have escaped me? No, beautiful Maria!
No&mdash;now I shall fetch you with a thousand others&mdash;with
all the thousand which you wanted to save..."</p>

<p>She dragged her dripping body up from the water. She crawled
upwards, over stone slabs; she found the door. She pushed it
open and slammed it behind her, peering to see if the water were
already lapping over the threshold.</p>

<p>Not yet...not yet. But how much longer?</p>

<p>She could not see a soul as far as her eye could reach. The
streets, the squares, lay as if dead&mdash;bathed in the
whiteness of the moonlight. But she was mistaken&mdash;or was
the light growing weaker and yellower from second to second?</p>

<p>An impact, which threw her against the nearest wall, ran
through the earth. The iron door through which she had, come
flew from its bolts and gaped open. Black and silent, the water
slipped over the threshold.</p>

<p>Maria collected herself. She screamed with her whole
lungs:</p>

<p>"The water's coming in&mdash;!"</p>

<p>She ran across the square. She called for the guard, which,
being on constant duty, had to give the alarm signal in danger
of any kind.</p>

<p>The guard was not there.</p>

<p>A wild upheaval of the earth dragged the girl's feet from
under her body and hurled her to the ground. She raised herself
to her knees and stretched up her hands in order, herself, to
set the siren howling. But the sound which broke from the metal
throat was only a whimper, like the whimpering of a dog, and the
light grew more and more pale and yellow.</p>

<p>Like a dark, crawling beast, in no hurry, the water wound its
way across the smooth street.</p>

<p>But the water did not stand alone in the street. Suddenly, in
the midst of a puzzling and very frightening solitude, a little
half-naked child was standing there: her eyes, which were still
being protected, by some dream, from the all too real, were
staring at the beast, at the dark, crawling beast, which was
licking at its bare little feet.</p>

<p>With a scream, in which distress and deliverance were equally
mingled, Maria flew to the child and picked it up in her
arms.</p>

<p>"Is there nobody here but you, child?" she asked, with a
sudden sob. "Where is your father?"</p>

<p>"Gone..."</p>

<p>"Where is your mother?"</p>

<p>"Gone..."</p>

<p>Maria could understand nothing. Since her flight from
Rotwang's house, she had been hurled from horror to horror,
without grasping a single thing. She still took the grating of
the earth, the jerking impacts, the roar of the awful, tearing
thunder the water which gushed up from the shattered depths, to
be the effects of the unchained elements. Yet she could not
believe that there existed mothers who would not throw
themselves as a barrier before their children when the earth
opened her womb to bring forth horror into the world.</p>

<p>Only&mdash;the water which crawled up nearer and nearer, the
impacts which racked the earth, the light which became paler and
paler, gave her no time to think. With the child in her arms,
she ran from house to house, calling to the others, which had
hidden themselves.</p>

<p>Then they came, stumbling and crying, coming in troops,
ghastly spectres, like children of stone, passionlessly begotten
and grudgingly born. They were like little corpses in mean
little shrouds, aroused to wakefulness on Doomsday by the voice
of the angel, rising from out rent-open graves. They clustered
themselves around Maria, screaming because the water, the cool
water, was licking at their feet.</p>

<p>Maria shouted&mdash;hardly able to shout any more. There was
in her voice the sharp cry of the mother-bird which sees winged
Death above its brood. She waded about among the child-bodies,
ten at her hands, at her dress, the others following closely,
pushed along, torn along, with the stream. Soon the street was a
wave of children's heads above which the pale, raised-up hands
flitted like sea-gulls. And Maria's cry was drowned by the
wailing of the children and by the laughter of the pursuing
water.</p>

<p>The light in the neon-lamps became reddish, flickering
rhythmically and throwing ghostly shadows. The street sloped.
There was the mustering-ground. But the huge elevators hung dead
on their cables. Ropes, twisted from ropes&mdash;metal, ropes,
thick as a man's thigh, hung in the air, torn asunder. Blackish
oil was welling in a leisurely channel from an exploded pipe.
And over everything lay a dry vapour as if from heated iron and
glowing stones.</p>

<p>Deep in the darkness of distant alleys the gloom took on a
brownish hue. A fire was smouldering there...</p>

<p>"Go up&mdash;!" whispered Maria's dry lips. But she was
notable to say the words. Winding stairs led upwards. The
staircase was narrow&mdash;nobody used the stair-case which ran
by the certain, infallible elevators. Maria crowded the children
up the steps. But, up there, there reigned a darkness of
impenetrable gloom and density. None of the children ventured to
ascend alone.</p>

<p>Maria scrambled up. She counted the steps. Like the rushing
of a thousand wings came the sound of the children's feet behind
her, in the narrow spiral. She did not know how long she had
been climbing up. Innumerable hands were clutching her damp
dress. She dragged her burdens upward, praying, moaning the
while&mdash;praying only for strength for another hour.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, little brothers!" she stammered. "My little
sisters, please don't cry."</p>

<p>Children were screaming, down in the depths&mdash;and the
hundred windings of the stair-way gave echo's trumpet to each
cry:</p>

<p>"Mother&mdash;! Mother&mdash;!"</p>

<p>And once more:</p>

<p>"The water's coming&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Stop and lie down, halfway up the stairs&mdash;? No!</p>

<p>"Little sisters! Little brothers&mdash;do come along!"</p>

<p>Higher&mdash;winding ever and always higher upward; then, at
last, a wide landing. Greyish light from above. A walled-in
room; not yet the upper world, but its forecourt. A short,
straight flight of stairs upon which lay a shaft of light. The
opening, a trap-door, which seemed to be pressed inwards.
Between the door and the square of the wall, a cleft, as narrow
as a cat's body.</p>

<p>Maria saw that. She did not know what it meant. She had the
uncertain feeling of something not being as it ought to be. But
she did not want to think about it. With an almost violent
movement she tore her hands, her gown, free from the children's
tugging fingers, and dashed, hurled forward far more by her
desperate will than by her benumbed feet, through the empty room
and up the steep stairway.</p>

<p>She stretched out her hands and tried to raise the pressed-in
door. It did not budge. Once more. No result. Head, arms,
shoulders pushing, hips and knees pressing, as if to burst their
sinews. No result. The door did not yield by a hair's breadth.
If a child had tried to push the cathedral from its place it
could not have acted more foolishly nor ineffectually.</p>

<p>For, upon the door, which alone led the way out of the
depths, there towered, as high as houses, the corpses of the
dead engines, which, when madness first broke out over
Metropolis, had been the terrible playthings of the mob.</p>

<p>Train upon train, with carriages thundering along, all lights
burning and on full power, had rushed along the rails, lashed by
the bawling of the mob, had fallen upon each other, had become
mixed and piled up together, had burnt down and were now lying,
half-melted, still smouldering, a mass of ruins. And one, single
lamp, remaining undamaged, threw the shaft of its sharp,
corrosive light over the chaos, from the steel breast of the
hindmost engine.</p>

<p>But Maria knew nothing of all this. She did not need to know.
Sufficient for her that the door, which was the only means of
deliverance for her and the children she wanted to save,
remained inexorable, immovable, and finally, with bleeding hands
and shoulders, with battered head, and feet crippled with
numbness, she was obliged to resign herself to the
incomprehensible, to the murderous.</p>

<p>She raised her face to the ray of light which fell upon her.
The words of a little, childish prayer, now no longer
intelligible, ran through her head. She dropped her head and sat
down on the stairs.</p>

<p>The children stood in silence, crowded closely together,
under the curse of something which, though they could not
understand it, was very close above them.</p>

<p>"Little brothers, little sisters," said Maria's voice, very
affectionately, "can you all understand what I am saying?"</p>

<p>"Yes," floated up from the children.</p>

<p>"The door is closed...We must wait a little...Someone is sure
to come and open it for us. Will you be patient and not be
frightened?"</p>

<p>"Yes," came an answer, as a sigh.</p>

<p>"Sit down as well as you can..."</p>

<p>The children obeyed.</p>

<p>"I am going to tell you a story," said Maria.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="first">"LITTLE sister..."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"I am so hungry, sister...!"</p>

<p>"Hungry...!" echoed out of the depths.</p>

<p>"Don't you want to hear the end of my story?"</p>

<p>"Yes...But sister, when you've finished, can't we go out and
have dinner?"</p>

<p>"Of course...as soon as my story's finished...Just think:
Foxy Fox went for a walk&mdash;went for a walk through the
beautiful flowery meadows; he had his Sunday coat on, and he
held his bushy red tail bolt upright, and he was smoking his
little pipe and singing all the while...Do you know what Foxy
Fox sang?&mdash;"</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">"I am the cheerful Fox&mdash;Hurray!<br>
I am the cheerful fox&mdash;Hurray!"</p>

<br>

<p>"And then he hopped for joy! And little Mr. Hedgehog was
sitting on his hillock and he was so glad that his radishes were
coming on so nicely, and his wife was standing by the hedge,
gossipping with Mrs. Mole, who had just got a new fur for the
Autumn..."</p>

<p>"Sister..."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Can the water from down there be coming up after us?"</p>

<p>"Why, little brother?"</p>

<p>"I can hear it gurgling..."</p>

<p>"Don't listen to the water, little brother...just listen to
what Mrs. Hedgehog has to chatter about!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sister, but the water is chattering so loud...I think
it chatters much louder than Mrs. Mole..."</p>

<p>"Come away from the stupid water, little brother...Come here
to me! You can't hear the water here!"</p>

<p>"I can't come to you sister! I can't move, sister...Can't you
come and fetch me?"</p>

<p>"Me too, sister&mdash;yes, me too!&mdash;me too!"</p>

<p>"I can't do that, little brothers, little sisters! Your
youngest brothers and sisters are on my lap. They have gone to
sleep and I mustn't wake them!"</p>

<p>"Oh sister, are we sure to get out?"</p>

<p>"Why do you ask as if you were frightened, little
brother?"</p>

<p>"The floor is shaking so and stones are tumbling down from
the ceiling!"</p>

<p>"Have those silly stones hurt you?"</p>

<p>"No, but my little sister's lying down and she's not moving
any more."</p>

<p>"Don't disturb her, little brother. Your sister's
asleep!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but she was crying just now...!"</p>

<p>"Don't be sorry little brother that she had gone where she
need not cry any more..."</p>

<p>"Where has she gone to, then, sister?"</p>

<p>"To heaven, I think."</p>

<p>"Is heaven so near, then?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, quite near. I can even see the door from here! And
if I'm not wrong, Saint Peter is standing there, in front of it,
with a large golden key, waiting until he can let us in..."</p>

<p>"Oh, sister...sister!! Now the water's coming up&mdash;! Now
it's got hold of my feet! Now it's lifting me up&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Sister!! Help me, sister.&mdash;The water has
come&mdash;!!"</p>

<p>"God can help you&mdash;Almighty God!"</p>

<p>"Sister, I'm frightened!"</p>

<p>"Are you frightened of going into the lovely heaven?"</p>

<p>"Is it lovely in heaven?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;glorious&mdash;glorious!"</p>

<p>"Is Foxy Fox in heaven, too&mdash;and little Mr.
Hedgehog?"</p>

<p>"I don't know! Shall I ask Saint Peter about it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sister...Are you crying?"</p>

<p>"No, why should I be crying?&mdash;Saint Peter&mdash;! Saint
Peter&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Did he hear?"</p>

<p>"Dear God, how cold the water is..."</p>

<p>"Saint Peter&mdash;! Saint Peter&mdash;!!"</p>

<p>"Sister...I think he answered, just now..."</p>

<p>"Really, little brother?"</p>

<p>"Yes...somebody was calling..."</p>

<p>"Yes, I heard it, too!"</p>

<p>"...So did I..."</p>

<p>"...So did I..."</p>

<p>"Hush, children, hush..."</p>

<p>"Oh, sister, sister&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Hush, please&mdash;please&mdash;!" "...........Maria!"</p>

<p>"Freder&mdash;!!!"</p>

<p>"Maria&mdash;are you there&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Freder&mdash;Freder&mdash;here I am! Here I am,
Freder&mdash;!!"</p>

<p>"On the stairs?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"Why don't you come up?"</p>

<p>"I can't raise the door!"</p>

<p>"Ten trains have run together...I can't come to you! I must
go and get help!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Freder, the water's already close behind us!"</p>

<p>"The water&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes!&mdash;And the walls are falling in!"</p>

<p>"Are you hurt&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"No, no...Oh, Freder, if you could only force open the door
wide enough for me to push the little children's bodies
through..."</p>

<p>The man above her did not give her an answer.</p>

<p>When steeling his muscles and sinews in the "Club of the
Sons," playfully wrestling with his friends, he surely never
guessed that he would need them one day to force a path through
ruined cables, upright pistons and out-spread wheels of fallen
machines to the woman he loved. He thrust the pistons aside like
human arms, clutched into steel as into soft, yielding flesh. He
worked his way nearer the door and threw himself on the
ground.</p>

<p>"Maria&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Freder?"</p>

<p>"Where are you? Why does your voice sound so far away?"</p>

<p>"I want to be the last whom you save, Freder! I am carrying
the tiniest ones on my shoulders and arms...,"</p>

<p>"Is the water still rising?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Is it rising fast or slowly?"</p>

<p>"Fast."</p>

<p>"My God, my God...I can't get the door loose! The machines
are piled up on top of it like mountains! I must explode the
ruins, Maria!"</p>

<p>"Very well." Maria's voice sounded as though she were
smiling. "Meanwhile I can finish telling my story..."</p>

<p>Freder dashed away. He did not know where his feet should
carry him. He thought vaguely of God..."Thy will be
done...Deliver us from evil...For Thine is the..power..."</p>

<p>From the sooty black sky a frightful gleam, of the colour of
spilt blood, fell upon the city, which appeared as a silhouette
of tattered velvet in the painful scarcity of light. There was
not a soul to be seen and yet the air throbbed under the
unbearable knife-edge of shrieks of women from the vicinity of
Yoshiwara, and, while the organ of the cathedral was shrilling
and whistling, as though its mighty body were wounded unto
death, the windows of the cathedral, lighted from within, began,
phantomlike to glow.</p>

<p>Freder staggered along to the tower-house in which the heart
of the great machine-city of Metropolis had lived, and which it
had torn open from top to bottom, when racing itself to death,
in the fever of the "12," so that the house now looked like a
ripped open, gaping gate.</p>

<p>A lump of humanity was crawling about the ruins, seeming,
from the sounds it emitted, to be nothing but a single curse, on
two legs. The horror which lay over Metropolis was Paradise
compared with the last, cruel destruction which the lump of
humanity was invoking from the lowest and hottest of hells upon
the city and its inhabitants.</p>

<p>He found something among the ruins, raised it to his face,
recognised it and broke out into howls, similar to the howls of
a kicked dog. He rubbed his sobbing mouth upon the little piece
of steel.</p>

<p>"May the stinking plague gnaw you, you lice&mdash;! May you
sit in muck up to your eyes&mdash;! May you swill gas instead of
water and burst every day&mdash;for ten thousand years&mdash;over and
over again&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Grot!"</p>

<p>"Filth&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Grot!&mdash;Thank God...Grot, come here!"</p>

<p>"Who's that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am Joh Fredersen's son&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aaah&mdash;Hell and the devil&mdash;I wanted you&mdash;!
Come here, you toad&mdash;! I must have you between my fists.
I'd much rather have had your father, but you're a bit of him
and better than nothing! Come along here, if you've got the
guts. Ah&mdash;my lad, wouldn't I like to get hold of you! I'd
like to smear you from top toe in mustard and eat you! D'you
know what your father's done&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Grot&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Let me finish&mdash;! tell you! Do you know what he
did&mdash;? He made me give up...he made me give up my
machine..."</p>

<p>And once more the miserable howling of a kicked dog.</p>

<p>"My machine...my&mdash;my machine&mdash;! That devil up
there! That God-damned devil!..."</p>

<p>"Grot, listen to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I won't listen to anything!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Grot, in the underground city, the water has broken
in..."</p>

<p>Seconds of silence. Then&mdash;roars of laughter, and, on the
heap of ruins, the dance of a four-legged lump, which kicked its
stumps amid wild yells, clapping its hands the while.</p>

<p>"That's right&mdash;! Hallelujah Amen&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Grot&mdash;!" Freder laid fast hold of the dancing lump and
shook it so that its teeth rattled. "The water has flooded the
city! The lights lie in ruins! The water has risen up the steps!
And upon the door&mdash;upon the only door, there lie tons upon
tons of trains which collided with each other there!"</p>

<p>"Let the rats drown&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"The children, Grot&mdash;!!"</p>

<p>Grot stood as if paralysed.</p>

<p>"A girl," continued Freder, clutching his hand into the man's
shoulder, "a girl," he said sobbingly, bending his head as if to
bury it in the man's breast, "a girl has tried to save the
children and is now shut in with them and can't get
out&mdash;"</p>

<p>Grot began to run. "We must explode the ruins, Grot!"</p>

<p>Grot stumbled, turned about and went on running, Freder
behind him, closer than his shadow...</p>

<br>

<p>"...But Foxy Fox knew very well that Mr. Hedgehog would come
to help him out of the trap, and he wasn't a bit frightened and
waited quite cheerfully, although it was a good long time before
Mr. Hedgehog&mdash;gallant Mr. Hedgehog came back..."</p>

<p>"Maria&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Oh Christ...Freder?"</p>

<p>"Don't be startled, do you hear?"</p>

<p>"Freder, you're not in danger?"</p>

<p>No answer. Silence. A crackling sound. Then a childish
voice:</p>

<p>"And did Mr. Hedgehog come, sister?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the "yes" was drowned by the tearing of thousands of
steel cables, the roar of tens of thousands of rocks which were
hurled up to the dome of heaven, to burst the dome and to sink,
to hurtle downwards, causing the earth to sway under their
fall.</p>

<p>Supplementary crackling. Grey, leisurely clouds. Distant
rumbling. And steps. Childish crying. And, up above, the door
which was hauled upwards:</p>

<p>"Maria&mdash;!"</p>

<p>A blackened face bent downwards; filthy hands stretched out,
gropingly.</p>

<p>"Maria&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Here I am, Freder!"</p>

<p>"I can hardly hear you..."</p>

<p>"Get the children out first, Freder...The wall's
sinking..."</p>

<p>Grot came lumbering along and threw himself on the ground by
Freder's side, clutching down into the pit from which the
children were scrambling out, screaming. He grabbed the children
by the hair, by the neck, by the head, and hauled them up, as
one pulls up radishes. His eyes were popping out of his head
with fear. He hurled the children over his body, so that they
tumbled over, shrieking miserably. He cursed like a hundred
devils. "Isn't that nearly all of them&mdash;?" He bawled down
two names...</p>

<p>"Father, father&mdash;!" sobbed two little voices in the
depths. "The devil take you, you couple of Jackanapes!", roared
the man. He rummaged the children aside with his fists, as if he
were shovelling rubbish on the dustheap. Then he gulped,
snorted, clutched out, and had two children hanging around his
neck, wet and shivering piteously, but alive&mdash;and their
limbs stood more in danger of his fumbling fists than previously
of the water and the tumbling stones.</p>

<p>With the children in both arms, Grot rolled over on his side.
He sat up and planted the couple before him.</p>

<p>"You God-damned pair of ragamuffins!" he said, amidst sobs.
He wiped the tears from his eyes. And sprang up, hurling the
children aside, like two little hay-stooks. With the furious
roar of a lion, he ran to the door, from the depths of which
Maria was emerging, with closed eyes, supported by Freder's
arm.</p>

<p>"You bloody&mdash;!" he howled out. He dragged Freder aside,
shoved the girl back into the depths, slammed the trap-door to,
and slung his entire weight upon it, drumming the rhythm of his
laughter upon it with clenched fists.</p>

<p>A grim effort had kept Freder on his feet. Beside himself, he
fell upon the maniac to tug him from the trap-door, fell over
him and rolled with him, in furious embrace, among the ruins of
the machines.</p>

<p>"Let me go, you dog, you mangy dog!" howled Gort, trying to
bite at the angry fist which held him. "That woman murdered my
machine&mdash;That damn woman led the rabble&mdash;!! That woman
alone turned the lever to 12&mdash;! I saw it when they were
trampling on me&mdash;! The woman can drown down there&mdash;!
I'm going to kill that woman&mdash;!"</p>

<p>With marvellous tension of all his muscles Grot drew himself
up and heaved himself, with a jerk, away from the raving
man&mdash;with such infuriated strength that he, Grot, shot,
describing a curve, amidst the children.</p>

<p>Cursing ardently, he gathered himself up again; but, though
he was uninjured, he could not move a limb. He stuck, an
impotent spoon, in a porridge of children, which adhered to his
arms, legs and fists. No steel fetters could have condemned him
so effectually to helplessness, as did the little cold, wet
hands, which were defending her who had rescued them all. Yes,
his own children were standing before him, pommelling angrily
upon his clenched fists, unscared by the blot-shot eyes with
which the giant glared at the dwarves, cudgelling him.</p>

<p>"That woman murdered my machine&mdash;!" he howled out at
last, more complainingly than angrily, looking at the girl, who
was resting upon Freder's arm, as though expecting her to bear
him out.</p>

<p>"What does he mean?" asked Maria. "And what has
happened?"</p>

<p>And she looked with eyes, the horror in which was only
modified by the deepest of exhaustion, at the destruction round
about, and at the snorting Grot.</p>

<p>Freder did not answer.</p>

<p>"Come," he said. And he raised her up in his arms and carried
her out. The children followed them like a flock of little
lambs, and Grot had no alternative than to run along in the
tracks of the tiny feet, whither the little, tugging hands drew
him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="first">THEY had taken the children into the house and
Freder's eyes sought Maria, who was kneeling in the street,
among the last remaining children, consoling them, and bestowing
her loving smile upon weeping and bewildered eyes.</p>

<p>Freder ran across to them and carried Maria into the
house.</p>

<p>"Don't forget," he said, letting her down upon a couch before
the blazing fire in the entrance hall, and holding captive in
his longing arms her half-lying, half-sitting, gently resisting
form, "that Death and madness and something very like
destruction' of the world have passed very close by us&mdash;and
that, after all that has happened, I do not even know the colour
of your eyes&mdash;and that you have not yet kissed me once by
your own free will..."</p>

<p>"Dearest," said Maria, leaning towards him, so that her pure
eyes, bathed in painless tears, were quite near to him,, while,
at the same time, a great, concentrated gravity kept her lips
away from his, "are you sure that Death and madness have already
passed by?"</p>

<p>"By us, beloved&mdash;yes!"</p>

<p>"And all the others&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Are you sending me away, Maria?" he asked, lovingly. She did
not answer, at least not in words. But, with a gesture which was
at once frank and touching, she put her arms about his neck and
kissed him on the mouth.</p>

<p>"Go along," she said, stroking his bewildered face with her
virginal, motherly hands. "Go to your father. That is the most
hallowed way...I shall go to the children as soon as my clothes
are a little dryer. For I'm afraid," she added with a smile
which made Freder blush to his eyes, "numerous as the women are
who live in the 'House of the Sons,' and willing and eager as
they may be, not one of them has a dress she could lend
me...!"</p>

<p>Freder stood bending over her with lowered eyes. The flames
of the huge fire glowed upon his handsome, open face, which wore
an expression of shame and sadness. But when he raised his
glance to meet Maria's eyes, which were silently fixed upon him,
without saying a word he took her hands and pressed them against
his eyelids, remaining thus for a long time.</p>

<p>And all this while they both forgot that, on the other side
of the wall which was protecting them, a city was throbbing in
grisly conflict, and that among the ruins thousands of beings,
themselves but ruins, hurled hither and thither, were losing
their reason, and perishing, tortured by deadly fear.</p>

<p>The voice of the Archangel Michael, coming from the
cathedral, recalled them to consciousness of the hour, and they
parted hurriedly, as if caught neglecting their duty.</p>

<p>Maria listened to the man's retreating step...</p>

<p>Then she turned and looked about her.</p>

<p>What a strange sound the Michael bell had...The bell was
calling so furiously&mdash;so agitatedly, as though to tumble
over at every peal...</p>

<p>Maria's heart became an echo of the bell. It fluttered in its
piteous fear, which had no source other than the general
vibration of terror above the town. Even the warming flames of
the fire frightened her, as if they had some knowledge of
secrets of Horror.</p>

<p>She sat up and put her feet to the ground. She felt the hem
of her dress. It was still rather wet but she would go now. She
took a few steps through the dimly-lighted room. How brown the
air was outside the windows...She hesitatingly opened the
nearest door and listened...</p>

<p>She was standing in the room in which she had stood on the
day when she saw Freder for the first time, when she had led the
train of little, grey child-spectres to those who were carefree
and joyous&mdash;when she had called to Freder's heart with her
gentle:</p>

<p>"Look, these are your brothers!"</p>

<p>But of all the dearly beloved sons of boundlessly wealthy
fathers, to whom this house belonged, not one was to be seen.
They must have left the tottering town long ago.</p>

<p>Sparsely distributed candles were burning, giving the room an
inward cosiness and a warm air of comfort. The room was filled
with the tender twittering of sleepy child-voices, chattering
like swallows before they fly to their nests. Answering them in
tones which were but little darker, came the voices of the
beautiful, brocaded, painted women, who had once been the
playthings of the sons. Equally frightened at the thought of
flight as of remaining where they were, they eventually stayed
in the "House of the Sons," being still undecided; and Maria had
brought the children to them, because they could have found no
better refuge; for, by the beautiful and dreadful chance of all
that had taken place, the troup of loving little harlots became
a troup of loving little mothers, burning with a new fire in the
execution of their new duties.</p>

<p>Not far from Maria the little drink-mixer was kneeling,
washing the skinny slender-limbed body of Grot's daughter, who
was standing in front of her. But the child had taken the sponge
from her hand, and, without saying a word, proceeding with
intense gravity, was thoughtfully and untiringly washing the
beautiful, painted face of the drink-mixer.</p>

<p>The girl knelt quite still, her eyes closed, neither did she
move when the child's hands began to dry her face with the rough
towel. But Grot's daughter was not quite successful in this
undertaking; for, whenever she dried the girl's cheeks, again
and again did the swift, bright drops run over them. Until
Grot's daughter dropped the towel to look at the girl who was
kneeling before her inquiringly, and not without reproach. Upon
which the girl caught the child in her arms, pressing her
forehead to the heart of the silent creature, uttering to this
heart words of love which she had never found before.</p>

<p>Maria passed by with soundless step.</p>

<p>But when the door to the hall, into which no noise from the
noisy Metropolis could penetrate, closed behind her, the
ore-voice of the angel of the cathedral struck at her breast like a
fist of steel, that she stood still, stunned, raising her hands
to her head.</p>

<p>Why was Saint Michael crying out so angrily and wildly? Why
was the roar of Azrael, the angel of Death joining in so
alarmingly?</p>

<p>She stepped into the street. Darkness, like a thick layer of
soot, lay over the town, and only the cathedral shimmered,
ghost&mdash;Like, a wonder of light, but not of grace.</p>

<p>The air was filled with a spectral battle of discordant
voices. Howling, laughing, whistling, were to be heard. It was
as though a gang of murderers and robbers were passing
by&mdash;In the unrecognisable depths of the street. Mingled
with them, shrieks of women, wild with excitement...</p>

<p>Maria's eyes sought the New Tower of Babel. She had only one
way in her mind: to Joh Fredersen. She would go there. But she
never went.</p>

<p>For suddenly the air was a blood-red stream, which poured
itself forth, flickering, formed by a thousand torches. And the
torches were dancing in the hands of beings who were crowding
out of Yoshiwara. The faces of the beings shone with insanity,
every mouth parted in a gasp, yet the eyes which blazed above
them were the bursting eyes of men choking. Each was dancing the
dance of Death with his own torch, whirling madly about, and the
whirl of the dancers formed a train, revolving in itself.</p>

<p>"Maohee&mdash;!" flew the shrill cries above it.
"Dance&mdash;dance&mdash;dance&mdash;Maohee&mdash;!"</p>

<p>But the flaming procession was led by a girl. The girl was
Maria. And the girl was screaming with Maria's voice:</p>

<p>"Dance&mdash;dance&mdash;dance&mdash;Maohee!"</p>

<p>She crossed the torches like swords above her head. She swung
them right and left, brandishing them so that showers of sparks
fell about the Way. Sometimes it seemed as if she were riding on
the torches. She raised her knees to her breast, with laughter
which brought a moan from the dancers of the procession.</p>

<p>But one of the dancers ran along at the girl's feet, like a
dog, crying incessantly:</p>

<p>"I am Jan! I am Jan! I am the faithful Jan! Hear me, at last,
Maria!"</p>

<p>But the girl struck him in the face with her sparkling
torch.</p>

<p>His clothes caught fire. He ran for some time, a living
torch, along by the girl. His voice sounded as if from the
blaze:</p>

<p>"Maria&mdash;! Maria&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Then he swung himself up on to the parapet of the street and
hurled, a streak of fire, into the blackness of the depths.</p>

<p>"Maohee&mdash;! Maohee&mdash;!" called the girl, shaking her
torch.</p>

<p>The procession was endless. The procession was endless. The
street was already covered, as far as the eye could see, with
circling torches. The shrieks of the dancers mixed themselves
sharply and shrilly with the angry voices of the archangels of
the cathedral. And behind the train, as though tugged along by
invisible, unbreakable cords, there reeled a girl, the damp hem
of the hose dress lashed about her ankles, whose hair was
falling loose under the clawing fingers which she pressed to her
head, whose lips babbled a name in ineffectual entreaty:
"Freder...Freder..."</p>

<p>The smoke-swathes from the torches hovered like the grey
wings of phantom birds above the dancing train.</p>

<p>Then the door of the cathedral was opened wide. From the
depths of the cathedral came the rushing of the organ. There
mixed itself in the fourfold tone of the archangel bells, in the
rushing of the organ, in the shrieks of the dancers, an
iron-tramping, mighty choir.</p>

<p>The hour of the monk Desertus had come.</p>

<p>The monk Desertus was leading on his own.</p>

<p>Two by two walked those who were his disciples. They walked
on bare feet, in black cowls. They had thrown their cowls back
from their shoulders. They carried the heavy scourges in both
hands. They swung the heavy scourges in both hands, right and
left, right and left, upon the bare shoulders. Blood trickled
down from the scourged backs. The Gothics sang. They sang to the
time of their feet. To the time of their scourge strokes did
they sing.</p>

<p>The monk Desertus was leading the Gothics on.</p>

<p>The Gothics bore a black cross before them. It was so heavy
that twelve men had to carry it, pantingly. It swayed, held up
by dark cords.</p>

<p>And on the cross hung the monk Desertus.</p>

<p>The black flames of the eyes in the flame-white face were
fixed upon the procession of dancers. The head was raised. The
pale mouth was opened.</p>

<p>"See!" shouted the monk Desertus in a voice which all-powerfully
outrang the fourfold tone of the archangel bells,
the rushing of the organ, the choir of scourge-swingers and the
shrieks of the dancers: "See&mdash;! Babylon, the great&mdash;!
The Mother of Abominations&mdash;! Doomsday is breaking&mdash;!
The destruction of the world&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Doomsday is breaking&mdash;! The destruction of the
world&mdash;!" chanted the choir of his followers after him.</p>

<p>"Dance&mdash;dance&mdash;dance&mdash;Maohee&mdash;!" shrieked
the voice of the girl leading the dancers. And she swung her
torches over her shoulders, and hurled them far from her. She
tore her gown from shoulders and breasts, standing, a white
torch, stretching up her arms and laughing, shaking her hair;
"Dance with me, Desertus&mdash;dance with me&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Then the girl, dragging herself along at the end of the
train, felt that the cord, the invisible cord upon which she was
hanging, snapped. She turned around and began, not knowing,
whither, to run&mdash;only to get away&mdash;only to get
away&mdash;no matter where to&mdash;only to get away&mdash;!</p>

<p>The streets flashed by in a whirl. She ran and ran, down, and
down, and at last she saw, running along the bottom of the
street and towards her, a wild mob of people, saw, too, that the
men wore the blue linen uniform and sobbed in relief:</p>

<p>"Brothers&mdash;brothers&mdash;!"</p>

<p>And stretched out her hands.</p>

<p>But a furious roar answered her. Like a collapsing wall, the
mass hurled itself forward, shook itself loose and began to tear
along, roaring loudly.</p>

<p>"There she is&mdash;! There she is&mdash;! The bitch, who is
to blame for it all&mdash;! Take her&mdash;! Take
her&mdash;!"</p>

<p>The women's voices shrieked:</p>

<p>"The witch&mdash;! Kill the witch&mdash;! Burn her before we
all drown!"</p>

<p>And the trampling of running feet filled the dead street,
through which the girl fled, with the din of hell broken
loose.</p>

<p>The houses flashed by in a whirl. She did not know the way in
the dark. She sped on, running aimlessly, in a blind horror,
which was the deeper for her not knowing its origin.</p>

<p>Stones, cudgels, fragments of steel, flew at her from behind.
The mob roared in a voice which was no longer human:</p>

<p>"After her&mdash;! After her&mdash;! She'll escape us&mdash;!
Quicker&mdash;!! Quicker&mdash;!!"</p>

<p>Maria could no longer feel her feet. She did not know if she
was running on stones or water. Her panting breath came through
lips which stood apart as those of one drowning. Up streets,
down streets...A twirling dance of lights was staggering across
the way, far ahead of her...Far away, at the end of the enormous
square, in which Rotwang's house also lay, the mass of the
cathedral rested upon the earth, weighty and dark, yet showing a
tender, reassuring shimmer, which fell through cheerful stained-glass
windows and through open portal, out into the darkness.</p>

<p>Suddenly breaking out into sobs, Maria threw herself forward
with her last, entirely despairing strength. She stumbled up the
cathedral steps, stumbled through the portal, perceived the
odour of incense, saw little, pious candles of intercession
before the image of a gentle saint who was: suffering smilingly,
and collapsed on to the flags.</p>

<p>She no longer saw how, at the double opening of the street
which led to the cathedral, the stream of dancers from
'Yoshiwara coincided with the roaring stream of workmen and
women, did not hear the bestial shriek of the women at the sight
of the girl who was riding along on the shoulders of a
dancer&mdash;who was torn down, overtaken, captured, and stamped
to earth&mdash;did not see the short, ghastly hopeless conflict
of the men in evening dress with the men in blue
silinen&mdash;nor the ridiculous fight of the half naked women
before the claws and fists of the workmen's wives.</p>

<p>She lay in deep oblivion, in the great, mild solemnity of
death, and from the depths of her unconsciousness she was not
awakened even by the roaring voice of the mob which was erecting
a bonfire for the witch, before the cathedral.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="first">"FREDER&mdash;!!! Grot&mdash;!!!
Freder&mdash;!!!"</p>

<p>Josaphat shouted so that his voice cracked, and raced with
the bounds of a harried wolf, through passages, across steps of
the great pump-works. His shouts were not heard. In the machine
rooms were wounded machines in agony, wanting to obey and not
being able. The door was closed. Josaphat hammered against it
with his fists, with his feet. It was Grot who opened it to him,
revolver in hand.</p>

<p>"What in the name of seething hell..."</p>

<p>"Get out of the way&mdash;! Where's Freder&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Here! What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Freder, they've taken Maria captive&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"They've taken Maria captive and they're killing
her&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Freder reeled. Josaphat dragged him towards the door. Like a
log, Grot stood in his way, his lips mumbling, his eyes
glaring.</p>

<p>"The woman who killed my machine&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Shut up, you fool&mdash;get out of the way&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Grot!" A sound born half of madness....</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Freder!"</p>

<p>"You stop with the machines!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Freder!"</p>

<p>"Come on, Josaphat&mdash;!"</p>

<p>The sound of running, running, retreating, ghostlike.</p>

<p>Grot turned round. He saw the paralysed machines, He lifted
his arm and struck the machine with the full of his fist, as one
strikes a stubborn horse between the eyes.</p>

<p>"The woman," he shouted with a howl, "who saved my little
children&mdash;!"</p>

<p>And he flung himself upon the machine with grinding
teeth...</p>

<p>"Tell me&mdash;!" said Freder, almost softly. It was as if he
did not want to waste an atom of strength. His face was a white
stone in which his two eyes flamed like jewels. He jumped to the
wheel of the little car in which Josaphat had come. For the pump
works lay at the extreme end of the great Metropolis.</p>

<p>It was still night.</p>

<p>The car started.</p>

<p>"We must go terribly out of our way," said Josaphat, fixing
the flashlight. "Many bridges between the houseblocks are blown
up..."</p>

<p>"Tell me," said Freder. His teeth met, chattering, as if he
were cold.</p>

<p>"I don't know who found it out...Probably the women, who were
thinking of their children and wanted to get home. You can't get
anything out of the raving multitude. But anyway: When they saw
the black water running towards them from the shafts of the
underground railway, and when they realised that the pump-works,
the safeguard of their city, had been destroyed by the stopping
of the machines, then they went mad with despair. They say that
some mothers, blind and deaf to all remonstrance, tried, as if
possessed, to dive down through the flooded shafts, and just the
terrible absoluteness of the futility of any attempt at rescue
has turned them into beasts and they lust for revenge..."</p>

<p>"Revenge...on whom?"</p>

<p>"On the girl who seduced them..."</p>

<p>"On the girl...?"</p>

<p>"Go on..."</p>

<p>"Freder, the engine can't keep up that speed..."</p>

<p>"Go on..."</p>

<p>"I do not know how it happened that the girl ran into their
hands. I was on my way to you when I saw a woman running across
the cathedral square, with her hair flying, the roaring rabble
behind her. There has been the very hell of a night anyway. The
Gothics are parading through the town scourging themselves, and
they have put the monk Desertus on the cross. They are
preaching: Doomsday had come, and it seems that they have
converted a good many already, for September is crouching before
the smoking ruins of Yoshiwara. A troop of torch dancers joined
itself to the flagellants and, with frothing curses upon the
Mother of Abominations, the great whore of Babylon, they burned
Yoshiwara down to the ground..."</p>

<p>"The girl, Josaphat&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She did not reach the cathedral, Freder, where she wanted to
take refuge. They overtook her on the steps because she fell on
the steps&mdash;her gown hung down in ribbons from her body. A
woman, whose white eyes were glowing with insanity shrieked out,
as one inspired with the gift of prophecy:"</p>

<p>"Look&mdash;! Look&mdash;! The saints have climbed down from
their pedestals and will not let the witch into the
cathedral."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Before the cathedral they are erecting a bonfire on which to
burn the witch..."</p>

<p>Freder said nothing. He bent down lower. The car groaned and
leapt.</p>

<p>Josaphat buried his hand in Freder's arm.</p>

<p>"Stop&mdash;for God's sake!!!"</p>

<p>The car stopped.</p>

<p>"We must go to the left&mdash;don't you see? The bridge has
gone!"</p>

<p>"The next bridged'</p>

<p>"Is impassable!"</p>

<p>"Listen..."</p>

<p>"What is there to hear&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't you hear anything?"</p>

<p>"No..."</p>

<p>"You must hear it&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"But what, Freder&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Shrieks...distant shrieks...."</p>

<p>"I can't hear anything..."</p>

<p>"But you must be able to hear it&mdash;!!"</p>

<p>"Won't you drive on, Freder?"</p>

<p>"And don't you see that the air over there is getting bright
red?"</p>

<p>"From the torches, Freder..."</p>

<p>"They don't burn so brightly..."</p>

<p>"Freder, we're losing time here&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Freder did not answer. He was staring at the tatters of the
iron bridge which were dangling down into the ravine of the
street. He must cross over, yes, he must cross over, to get to
the cathedral by a short cut...</p>

<p>The frame-support of a ripped-open tower had fallen over from
this side of the street to the other, gleaming metallically in
the uncertain light of the fading night "Get out," said Freder.
"Why?"</p>

<p>"Get out, I tell you!</p>

<p>"I want to know why?"</p>

<p>"Because I'm going across there..."</p>

<p>"Across where?"</p>

<p>"Across the frame-support."</p>

<p>"Going to drive across&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"It's suicide, Freder!"</p>

<p>"I didn't ask you to accompany me. Get out!"</p>

<p>"I won't permit it&mdash;It's blazing lunacy!"</p>

<p>"The fire over there is blazing, man&mdash;!" The words
seemed not to come from Freder's mouth. Every wound of the dying
city seemed to be roaring out of him.</p>

<p>"Drive on!" said Josaphat through clenched teeth. The car
gave a jump. It climbed. The narrow irons received the sucking,
skidding wheels, with an evil, maliciously hypocritical
sound.</p>

<p>Blood was trickling from Freder's lips.</p>

<p>"Don't&mdash;don't put the brake on&mdash;for God's sake
don't put the brake on!" shouted the man beside him making a
clutch of madness at Freder's hand. The car, already half-slipping,
shot forward again. A split in the framework&mdash;over, onwards.
Behind them the dead framework crashed into space amid shrieks!</p>

<p>They reached the other side with an impetus which was no
longer to be checked. The wheels rushed into blackness and
nothing. The car overturned, Freder fell and got up again. The
other remained lying.</p>

<p>"Josaphat&mdash;!!"</p>

<p>"Run! It's nothing!&mdash;II swear to God it's nothing," a
distorted smile upon the white face. "Think of Maria&mdash;and
run!"</p>

<p>And Freder raced off.</p>

<p>Josaphat turned his head. He saw the blackness of the street
flashing bright red. He heard the screams of the thousands. He
thought dully, with a thrust of his fist in the air: "Shouldn't
I like to be Grot now, to be able to swear properly..."</p>

<p>Then his head fell back into the filth of the street, and
every consciousness faded but that of pain...</p>

<p>But Freder ran as he had never run. It was not his feet which
carried him. It was his wild heart&mdash;It was his
thoughts.</p>

<p>Streets and stairs and streets and at last the cathedral
square. Black in the background, the cathedral, ungodded,
unlighted, the place before the broad steps swarming with human
beings&mdash;and amid them, surrounded by gasps of madly
despairing laughter, the howling of songs of fury, the
smouldering of torches and brands, high up on the pyre...</p>

<p>"Maria&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Freder fell on his knees as though his sinews were sawn
through.</p>

<p>"Maria&mdash;!"</p>

<p>The girl whom he took to be Maria raised her head. She sought
him. Her glance found him. She smiled&mdash;laughed.</p>

<p>"Dance with me, my dearest&mdash;!" flew her voice, sharp as
a flashing knife, through uproar.</p>

<p>Freder got up. The mob recognised him. The mob lurched
towards him, shrieking and yelling.</p>

<p>"Jooooo&mdash;oh! Joh Fredersen's son&mdash;! Joh Fredersen's
son&mdash;"</p>

<p>They made to seize him. He dodged them wildly. He threw
himself with his back against the parapet of the street.</p>

<p>"Why do you want to kill her, you devils&mdash;? She has
saved your children!"</p>

<p>Roars of laughter answered him. Women sobbed with laughter,
biting into their own hands.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;she has saved our children&mdash;! She
saved our children with the song of the dead machines! She saved
our children with the ice cold water&mdash;! High let her
live&mdash;high and three time high!"</p>

<p>"Go to the 'House of the Sons'&mdash;! Your children are
there!"</p>

<p>"Our children are not in the 'House of the Sons!' There lives
the brood, hatched out by money. Sons of your kind, you dog in
white-silken skin!"</p>

<p>"Listen, for God's sake&mdash;do listen to me&mdash;!!!"</p>

<p>"We don't want to hear anything&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Maria&mdash;beloved!!!&mdash;Beloved! I!"</p>

<p>"Don't bawl so, son of Joh Fredersen! Or we'll stop your
mouth!"</p>

<p>"Kill me, if you must kill&mdash;but let her
live&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Each in his turn, son of Joh Fredersen! First you shall see
how your beloved dies a beautiful, hot magnificent death!"</p>

<p>A woman&mdash;Grot's woman&mdash;tore a strip off her skirt
and bound Freder's hands. He was bound fast to the parapet with
cords. He struggled like a wild beast, shouting that the veins
of this throat were in danger of bursting. Bound, impotent, he
threw back his head and saw the sky over Metropolis, pure,
tender, greenish-blue, for morning would soon follow after this
night.</p>

<p>"God&mdash;!" he shouted, trying to throw himself on his
knees, in his bonds. "God&mdash;! Where art thou&mdash;?"</p>

<p>A wild, red gleam caught his eyes. The pyre flamed up in long
flames. The men, the women, seized hands and tore around the
bonfire, faster, faster and faster, in rings growing ever wider
and wider, laughing, screaming with stamping feet,
"Witch&mdash;! Witch!"</p>

<p>Freder's bonds broke. He fell over on his face among the feet
of the dancers.</p>

<p>And the last he saw of the girl, while her gown and hair
stood blazing around her as a mantle of fire, was the loving
smile and the wonder of her eyes&mdash;and her mouth of deadly
sin, which lured among the flames: "Dance with me, my dearest!
Dance with me&mdash;!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="first">ROTWANG awoke; but he knew quite well he was
dead. And this consciousness filled him with the deepest
satisfaction. His aching body no longer had anything to do with
him. That was perhaps the last remains of life. But something
worried him deeply, as he raised himself up and looked around in
all directions: Hel was not there.</p>

<p>Hel must be found...</p>

<p>Ah existence without Hel was over at last. A second
one?&mdash;No! Better than to stay dead.</p>

<p>He got up on his feet. That was very difficult. He must have
been lying as a corpse for a good long time. It was night, too.
A fire was raging out there, and it was all very
noise...Shrieking of human beings...</p>

<p>Hm...</p>

<p>He had hoped to have been rid of them. But, apparently the
Almighty Creator could not get along without them. Now&mdash;but
one purpose. He just wanted his Hel. When he had found Hel, he
would&mdash;he promised himself this!&mdash;never again quarrel
with the father of all things, about anything at all...</p>

<p>So now he went...The door leading to the street was open and
hanging crookedly on its hinges. Strange. He stepped in front of
the house and looked deliberatingly around. What he saw seemed
to be a kind of Metropolis; but a rather insane kind of
Metropolis. The houses seemed as though struck still in St.
Vitus' dance. And an uncommonly rough and impolite sort of
people was ramping around a flaming bonfire, upon which a
creature of rare beauty was standing, seeming, to Rotwang, to be
wondrously at ease.</p>

<p>Ah&mdash;It was that, ah yes&mdash;that, in the existence
which, thank the Lord, lay far behind him, he had tried to
create, to replace his lost Hel&mdash;just to make the handiwork
of the Creator of the world look rather silly...Not bad for a
beginning...hm...but, good God, compared with Hel; what an
object; what a bungle...</p>

<p>The shrieking individuals down there were quite right to burn
the thing. Though it appeared to him to be rather a show of
idiocy to destroy his test-work. But perhaps that was the custom
of the people in this existence, and he certainly did not want
to argue with them. He wanted to find Hel&mdash;his
Hel&mdash;and nothing else...</p>

<p>He knew exactly where to look for her. She loved the
cathedral so dearly, did his pious Hel. And, if the flickering
light of the bonfire did not deceive him,&mdash;for the greenish
sky gave no glimmer&mdash;Hel was standing, like a frightened
child in the blackness of the cathedral door, her slender hands
clasped firmly upon her breast, looking more saint&mdash;Like
than ever.</p>

<p>Past those who were raving around the bonfire&mdash;always
politely avoiding getting in their way&mdash;Rotwang quietly
groped his way to the cathedral.</p>

<p>Yes, it was his Hel...She receded into the cathedral. He
groped his way up the steps. How high the door looked...Coolness
and hovering incense received him...All the saints in the pillar
niches had pious and lovely faces, smiling gently, as though
they rejoiced with him that he was now, at last, to find Hel,
his Hel, again.</p>

<p>She was standing at the foot of the belfry steps. She seemed
to him to be very pale and indescribably pathetic. Through a
narrow window the first pale light of the morning fell upon her
hair and brow.</p>

<p>"Hel," said Rotwang, his heart streaming over; he stretched
out his hands. "Come to me, my Hel...How long, how long I had to
live without you!"</p>

<p>But she did not come. She started back from him. Her face
full of horror, she started back from him.</p>

<p>"Hel," begged the man, "why are you afraid of me? I am no
ghost, although I am dead. I had to die, to come to you. I have
always, always longed for you. You have no right to leave me
alone now! I want your hands! Give them to me!"</p>

<p>But his groping fingers snatched into space. Footsteps were
hurrying up the steps of the stone-staircase which led to the
belfry.</p>

<p>Something like anger came over Rotwang's heart. Deep in his
dulled and tortured soul reposed the memory of a day upon which
Hel had likewise fled from him&mdash;to another...No, don't
think, don't think of it...That was a part of his first
existence, and it would be quite senseless to go through the
same again&mdash;In the other, and, as humanity in general
hoped, better world.</p>

<p>Why was Hel fleeing from him? He groped along after her.
Climbed up stairs upon stairs. The hastening, frightened
footsteps remained constantly before him. And the higher the
woman before him fled, the more wildly did his heart beat in
this mighty ascent, the redder did Rotwang's eyes become filled
with blood, the more furiously did his anger boil up within him.
She should not run away from him&mdash;she should not! If only
he could catch her by the hand he would never, never let her go
again! He would forge a ring about her wrist with his metal
hand&mdash;and then she should never try to escape him
again...to another!</p>

<p>They had both reached the belfry. They raced along under the
bells. He blocked the way to the stairs. He laughed, sadly and
evilly.</p>

<p>"Hel, my Hel, you can no longer escape me!" She made a swift,
despairing leap, and hung on the rope of the bell which was
called Saint Michael. Saint Michael raised his ore voice, but it
sounded as though broken, complaining wildly. Rotwang's laughter
mingled with the sound of the bell. His metal arm, the
marvellous achievement of a genius, stretched, like the phantom
arm of a skeleton, far out on the sleeve of his coat, and
snatched at the bell-rope. "Hel, my Hel, you can no longer
escape me!" The girl staggered back against the breastwork. She
looked around. She was trembling like a bird. She could not go
down the stairs. Neither could she go any higher. She was
trapped. She saw Rotwang's eyes and saw his hands. And, without
hesitation, without reflection, with a ferocity which swept a
blaze of scarlet across the pallor of her face, she swung
herself out of the belfry window, to hang upon the steel cord of
the lightning conductor.</p>

<p>"Freder&mdash;!!" she screamed. "Help me&mdash;!!"</p>

<p>Below&mdash;far below, near the flaming pyre, lay a trampled
creature, his forehead in the dust. But the scream from above
smote him so unexpectedly that he shot up, as if under the lash,
he sought and he saw&mdash;</p>

<p>And all those who had been dancing in wild rings around the
bonfire of the witch saw, as he&mdash;stiffened&mdash;petrified:
The girl who hung, swallowlike, clinging to the tower of the
cathedral, with Rotwang's hands stretching out towards her.</p>

<p>And they all heard how, in the shouted answer: "I am coming,
Maria, I am coming&mdash;!" there cried out all the relief and
all the despair which can fill the heart of a man to whom Heaven
and Hell are equally near.</p>

<h2><a id="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="first">JOH FREDERSEN stood in the dome-room of the New
Tower of Babel, waiting for Slim. He was to bring him news of
his son.</p>

<p>A ghostly darkness lay upon the New Tower of Babel. The light
had gone completely out, gone out as though it had been
killed&mdash;at the moment when the gigantic wheel of the
Heart-machine of Metropolis came free from its structure with a roar
as from the throats of a thousand wounded beasts, and, still
whirling around, was hurled straight up at the ceiling, to
strike it with a shattering crash, to bound back, booming the
while like a gong as large as the heavens and to crash down upon
the splintered ruins of the erstwhile masterpiece of steel, to
remain lying there.</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen stood long on the same spot, not daring to
move. It seemed to him that an eternity had passed since he sent
Slim out for news of his son. And Slim wouldn't and wouldn't
come back.</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen felt that his whole body was frozen to an icy
coldness. His hands, hanging helplessly downwards, were clasped
around the pocket-torch.</p>

<p>He waited...waited...</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen threw a glance at the clock. But the hands of
the giantess stood at an impossible time. The New Tower of Babel
had indeed lost itself. Whereas, every day, the throbbing of the
streets which tunnelled their course below it, the roar of the
traffic of fifty million, the magic madness of speed, had raged
its way up to him, there now crouched a calm of penetrating
terror.</p>

<p>Stumbling steps were hastening towards the door of the outer
room.</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen turned the beam of his pocket-torch, upon this
door. It flew wide open. Slim stood upon the threshold. He
staggered. He closed his eyes dazzled. In the excessively
glaring light of the powerful torch his face, right down to his
neck, shone a greenish white.</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen wanted to ask a question. But not the least
sound passed his lips. A terrible dryness burnt his throat. The
lamp in his hand began to tremble and to dance. Up to the
ceiling, down to the floor, along the walls, reeled the beam of
light...</p>

<p>Slim ran up to Joh Fredersen. Slim's wide, staring eyes bore
an inextinguishable horror.</p>

<p>"Your son," he stammered, almost babbling, "your son, Mr.
Fredersen&mdash;"</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen remained silent. He made no movement, but that
he stooped a little&mdash;just a very little, forward.</p>

<p>"I have not found your son..." said Slim. He did not wait for
Joh Fredersen to answer him. His tall body, with the impression
it gave of asceticism and cruelty, the movements of which had,
in Joh Fredersen's service, gradually gained the disinterested
accuracy of a machine, seemed quite out of joint, shaken out of
control. His voice inquired shrilly, in the grip of a deep
innermost frenzy: "Do you know, Mr. Fredersen, what is going on
around you, in Metropolis&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"What I will," answered Joh Fredersen. The words sounded
mechanical, and as though they had been read before they were
spoken: "What does that mean: You have not found my
son&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"It means what it means," answered Slim in his shrill voice.
His eyes bore an awful hatred. He stood, leaning far forward, as
if ready to pounce upon Joh Fredersen, and his hands became
claws. "It means that Freder, your son is not to be
found&mdash;it means that he, perhaps, wanted to look on with
his own eyes at what becomes of Metropolis by his father's will
and the hands of a few lunatics&mdash;it means, as the now
half-witted servants told me, that your son left the safety of his
home, setting out in company with a man who was wearing the
uniform of a workman of Metropolis, and that it might well be
difficult to seek your son in this city, in which, by your will,
madness has broken out&mdash;the madness to' destroy, Mr.
Fredersen, the madness to ruin!&mdash;and which has not even
light to lighten its madness&mdash;!" Slim wanted to continue,
but he did not do so. Joh Fredersen's right hand made a
senseless, fumbling gesture through the air. The torch fell from
his hand, continuing to burn on the floor. The mightiest man of
Metropolis swung half around, as though he had been shot, and
collapsed empty-eyed, back into the chair by the writing-table.</p>

<p>Slim stooped forward, to look Joh Fredersen in the face.
Before these eyes he was struck silent.</p>

<p>Ten&mdash;twenty&mdash;thirty seconds long he did not dare to
draw a breath. His horrified gaze followed the aimless movements
of Joh Fredersen's fingers, which were fumbling about as though
seeking for some lever of rescue, which they could not find.
Then, suddenly, the hand rose a little from the table-top. The
forefinger straightened as though admonishing to attention. Joh
Fredersen murmured something. Then he laughed. It was a tired,
sad little laugh, at the sound of which Slim thought he felt the
hair of his head begin to bristle.</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen was talking to himself. What was he saying?
Slim bent over him. He saw the forefinger of Joh Fredersen's
right hand gliding slowly across the shiny table-top, as though
he were following and spelling out the lines of a book.</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen's soft voice said:</p>

<p>"Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he reap..."</p>

<p>Then Joh Fredersen's forehead fell on to the smooth wood,
and, unceasingly, in a tone which, except for a dead woman, no
one had ever heard from Joh Fredersen, his soft voice cried the
name of his son...</p>

<p>But the cries remained unanswered...</p>

<p>Up the steps of the New Tower of Babel there crept a man. It
seldom happened in the great Metropolis, Joh Fredersen's time-saving
city, that anyone used the stairs. They were reserved in
case of all the lifts and the Pater-noster being overcrowded, of
the cessation of all means of transit, of the outbreak of fire
and similar accidents&mdash;Improbable occurrences in this
perfect settlement of human beings. But the improbable had
happened. Piled up, one above the other, the lifts, which came
hurtling down, blocked up their shafts, and the cells of the
Pater-noster seemed to have been bent and charred by a hellish
heat, smouldering up from the depths.</p>

<p>Up the stairs of the New Tower of Babel did Josaphat drag
himself. He had learnt to swear in that quarter of an hour, even
as Grot used to swear, and he made full use of his newly
acquired art. He roared at the pain which racked his limbs. He
spat out an excess of hatred and contempt at the agony in his
knees. Wild and ingenious were the execrations which he hurled
at every landing, every new bend in the staircase. But he
conquered them all&mdash;one hundred and six flights of stairs,
each consisting of thirty steps. He reached the semicircle where
the lifts had their opening. In the corners before the door to
Joh Fredersen's rooms there crouched knots of human beings,
pressed together by the common pressure of a terrible fear.</p>

<p>They turned their heads to stare at the man who was crawling
up the stairs, dragging himself up by aid of the walls.</p>

<p>His wild eyes swept over them.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked breathlessly. "What are you all doing
here?"</p>

<p>Agitated voices whispered. Nobody knew who was speaking.
Words tumbled over each other.</p>

<p>"He drove us out into the town, where death is running as
though amok...He sent us out to look for his son, Freder. We
couldn't find him...None of us...We daren't go in to Joh
Fredersen...Nobody dares take him the news that we haven't been
able to find his son..."</p>

<p>A voice swung out, high and sharp from out the knot: "Who can
find one single damned soul in this hell&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Hush...hush...!" "Listen&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"He is talking to Slim."</p>

<p>And in the tension of listening, which smothered every sound,
the heads bent towards the door.</p>

<p>Behind the door a voice spoke, as were the wood rattling:
"Where is my son...?"</p>

<p>Josaphat made for the door, staggering. The panting cry of
many men tried to stop him. Hands were stretched out towards
him.</p>

<p>"Don't&mdash;don't&mdash;!!"</p>

<p>But he had already pushed open the door. He looked about him.
Through the enormous windows the first glow of the youthful day
was flowing, lying on the shining floor like pools of blood. By
the wall, near the door, stood Slim. And just before him stood
Joh Fredersen. His fists were pressed against the wall, right
and left of the man, holding him fast, as though they had been
drilled through him, crucifying him.</p>

<p>"Where is my son&mdash;?" said Joh Fredersen. He
asked&mdash;and his voice cracked as if in suffocation: "Where
is my child?"</p>

<p>Slim's head flung back against the wall. From his ashen lips
came the toneless words:</p>

<p>"To-morrow there will be many in Metropolis who will ask:</p>

<p>"'Joh Fredersen, where is my child?'" Joh Fredersen's fists
relaxed. His whole body twisted around. Then the man who had
been the Master over Metropolis saw that another man was
standing in the room. He stared at him. The sweat trickled down
his face in cold, slow, burdensome drops. The face twitched in a
terrible impotence.</p>

<p>"Where is my son&mdash;?" asked Joh Fredersen, babblingly. He
stretched out his hand. The hand shot through the air, groping
aimlessly. "Do you know, where my son is&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Josaphat did not answer. Yes, the answer shouted in his
throat. But he could not form the words. There was a fist at his
throat, strangling him...God&mdash;Almighty God in highest
heaven, was it Joh Fredersen who was standing before him?</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen made an uncertain step towards him. He bent his
head low to look at him the more closely. He nodded again.</p>

<p>"I know you," he said tonelessly. "You are Josaphat and you
were my first secretary. I sent you away. I treated you cruelly.
I did you wrong and I ruined you...I beg your forgiveness...I am
sorry that I was ever cruel to you or to anyone else...Forgive
me...Forgive me, Josaphat, for ten hours I have not known where
my son is...For ten hours, Josaphat, I have been sending all the
men I could get hold of, down into that damned city to look for
my son, and I know it is senseless, and I know it is quite
pointless, the day is breaking, and I am talking and talking and
I know that I am a fool but perhaps, perhaps you know where my
son is...?"</p>

<p>"Captured," said Josaphat, and it was as though he ripped the
word from his gullet, and feared to bleed to death therefrom.
"Captured..."</p>

<p>A stupid smile hovered over Joh Fredersen's face.</p>

<p>"What does that mean...captured...?"</p>

<p>"The mob has captured him, Joh Fredersen!"</p>

<p>"Captured&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"My son&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes!&mdash;Freder, your son&mdash;!"</p>

<p>A senseless, pitiable, animal sound broke from Joh
Fredersen's mouth. His mouth stood open, distorted&mdash;his
hands rose as in childish defence, to ward off a blow which had
already fallen. His voice said, quite high and piteously: "My
son...?"</p>

<p>"They took him prisoner,"&mdash;Josaphat tore the words
out&mdash;"because they sought a victim for their despair, and
for the fury of their immeasurable, inconceivable agony. When
they saw the black water running towards them from the shafts of
the underground railway, and when they realised that, as the
result of the stopping of the pumps, the whole workmen's town
had been flooded out, then they went mad with despair. They say
that some mothers, blind and deaf to all remonstrance, tried, as
if possessed, to dive down through the flooded shafts, and just
the terrible absoluteness of the futility of any attempt at
rescue has turned them into beasts and they lust for
revenge..."</p>

<p>"Revenge...on whom?"</p>

<p>"On the girl who seduced them...."</p>

<p>"On the girl..."</p>

<p>"Yes..."</p>

<p>"Go on..."</p>

<p>"They have taken captive the girl, on whom they put the blame
of all this horror...Freder wanted to save her, for he loves the
girl...They have taken him captive and are forcing him to look
on and see how his beloved dies...They have built the bonfire
before the cathedral...They are dancing round the bonfire...They
are yelling: 'We have captured the son of Joh Fredersen and his
beloved'...and I know&mdash;I know: He'll never get away from
them alive...!"</p>

<p>For the space of some seconds there was so deep and perfect a
silence that the golden glow of the morning, breaking forth,
strong and radiant had the effect of a powerful roar. Then Joh
Fredersen turned around, breaking into a run. He flung himself
at the door. So forceful and irresistible was this movement that
it seemed as if the closed door itself were not able to
withstand it.</p>

<p>Past the knots of human being ran Joh Fredersen&mdash;across
to the stair-case and down the steps. His course was as a
pauseless series of leaps. He did not notice the height. With
hands stretched forward he ran, in bounds, his hair rearing up
like a flame above his brow. His mouth was wide open and between
his parted lips there hovered&mdash;a soundless scream&mdash;the
unscreamed name: "Freder!"</p>

<p>An infinity of stairs...clefts...rents in walls...smashed
Stone blocks...twisted iron...destruction...ruin....</p>

<p>The street.</p>

<p>The day was streaming down, red, upon the street...</p>

<p>Howls in the air. And the gleam of flame. And smoke...</p>

<p>Voices...shouts&mdash;and no exultant shouting...shouts of
fear, of horror, of terribly strained tension...</p>

<p>At last the cathedral square...</p>

<p>The bonfire. The mob...men, woman, immeasurable masses...but
they were not gazing at the bonfire, on the smoking fireiness of
which smouldered a creature of metal and glass, with the head
and body of a woman.</p>

<p>All eyes were turned upwards, towards the heights of the
cathedral, the roof of which sparkled in the morning
sunshine.</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen stopped, as though a blow had been struck at
his knees.</p>

<p>"What..." he stammered. He raised his eyes, he raised his
hands quite slowly to the level of his head...his hands rested
upon his hair.</p>

<p>Soundlessly, as though mown down, he fell upon his knees.</p>

<p>Upon the heights of the cathedral roof, entwined about each
other, clawed to each other, wrestled Freder and Rotwang,
gleaming in the sunlight.</p>

<p>They fought, breast pressed to breast, knee to knee. One did
not need very sharp eyes to see that Rotwang was by far the
stronger. The slender form of the boy, in white silken tatters,
bent under the throttling grip of the great inventor, farther
and farther backwards. In a fearfully wonderful arch the
slender, white form was extended, head back, knees bent forward.
And the blackness which was Rotwang stood out, massy, mountain-like,
above the silken whiteness, forcing it downwards. In the
narrow gallery of the spire Freder crumpled up like a sack and
lay in the corner, stirring no more. Above him, straightened up,
yet bent forward&mdash;Rotwang, staring at him, then
turning...</p>

<p>Along the narrow roof ridge, towards him&mdash;no, towards
the dullish bundle of white silk, staggered Maria. In the light
of the morning, risen glorious and imperious, her voice
fluttered out like the mourning of a poor bird:
"Freder&mdash;Freder&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Whispers broke out in the cathedral square. Heads turned and
hands pointed.</p>

<p>"Look&mdash;Joh Fredersen! Look over there&mdash;Joh
Fredersen!"</p>

<p>A woman's voice yelled out:</p>

<p>"Now you see for yourself, don't you, Joh Fredersen, what
it's like when someone's only child is murdered&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Josaphat leaped before the man who was on his knees, hearing
nothing of what was going on around him.</p>

<p>"What's the matter&mdash;?" he shouted. "What's the matter
with you all&mdash;? Your children have been saved! In the
'House of the Sons!' Maria and Joh Fredersen's son&mdash;they
saved your children&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen heard nothing. He did not hear the scream,
which, like a bellowed prayer to God, suddenly leaped from the
one mouth of the multitude.</p>

<p>He did not hear the shuffling with which the multitude near
him, far around him, threw itself on its knees. He did not hear
the weeping of the women, the panting of the men, nor prayer,
nor thanks, nor groans, nor praises.</p>

<p>Only his eyes remained alive. His eyes which seemed to be
lidless, clung to the roof of the cathedral.</p>

<p>Maria had reached the white bundle, which lay, crumpled up in
the corner, between the spire and the roof. She slid along to it
on her knees, stretching her hands out towards it, blinded with
misery:</p>

<p>"Freder...Freder..."</p>

<p>With a savage snarl, like the snarl of a beast of pray,
Rotwang clutched at her. She struggled amid screams. He held her
lips closed. With an expression of despairing incomprehension he
stared into the girl's tear-wet face.</p>

<p>"Hel...my Hel...why do you struggle against me?" He held her
in his ironlike arms, as prey which, now, nothing and no one
could tear away from him. Close to the spire a ladder led
upwards to the cathedral coping. With the bestial snarl of one
unjustly pursued he climbed up the ladder, dragging the girl
with him, in his arms.</p>

<p>This was the sight which met Freder's eyes when he opened
them and tore himself free from the half-unconscious state he
was in. He pushed himself up and flung himself across to the
ladder. He climbed up the ladder almost at a run, with the
blindly certain speed born of fear for his beloved. He reached
Rotwang, who let Maria fall. She fell. She fell, but in falling
she saved herself, pulling herself up and reaching the golden
sickle of the moon on which rested the star-crowned Virgin. She
stretched out her hand to clutch at Freder. But at the same
moment Rotwang threw himself down upon the man who was standing
below him, and clasped tightly together, they rolled along, down
the roof of the cathedral, rebounding violently against the
narrow railing of the gallery.</p>

<p>The yell of fear from the multitude came shrieking up from
the depths. Neither Rotwang nor Freder heard it. With a terrible
oath Rotwang gathered himself up. He saw above him, sharp
against the blue of the sky, the gargoyle of a waterspout. It
grinned in his face. The long tongue leered mockingly at him. He
drew himself up and struck, with clenched fist, at the grinning
gargoyle...</p>

<p>The gargoyle broke...</p>

<p>In the weight of the blow he lost his balance&mdash;and
fell&mdash;and saved himself, hanging with one hand to the
Gothic ornamentation of the cathedral.</p>

<p>And, looking upwards, into the infinite blue of the morning
sky, he saw Hel's countenance, which he had loved, and it was
like the countenance of the beautiful angel of Death, smiling at
him, its lips inclining towards his brow.</p>

<p>Great black wings spread themselves out, strong enough to
carry a lost world up to heaven.</p>

<p>"Hel..." said the man. "My Hel...at last..."</p>

<p>And his fingers lost their hold, voluntarily...</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen did not see the fall, neither did he hear the
cry of the multitude as it stared back. He saw but one thing:
the white-gleaming figure of the man, who, upright and
uninjured, was walking along the roof of the cathedral with the
even step of one fearing nothing, carrying the girl in his
arms.</p>

<p>Then Joh Fredersen bent down, so low that his forehead
touched the stones of the cathedral square. And those near
enough to him heard the weeping which welled up from his heart,
as water from a rock.</p>

<p>As his hands loosened from his head, all who stood around him
saw that Joh Fredersen's hair had turned snow-white.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="first">"BELOVED&mdash;!" said Freder, Joh Fredersen's
son.</p>

<p>It was the softest, the most cautious call of which a human
voice is capable. But Maria answered it just as little as she
had answered the shouts of despair with which the man who loved
her had wished to re-awaken her to consciousness of herself.</p>

<p>She lay couched upon the steps of the high altar, stretched
out in her slenderness, her head in Freder's arm, her hands in
Freder's hand, and the gentle fire of the lofty church-windows
burnt upon her quite white face and upon her quite white hands.
Her heart beat, slowly, barely, perceptibly. She did not breathe
She lay sunken in the depths of an exhaustion from which no
shout, no entreaty, no cry of despair could have dragged her.
She was as though dead.</p>

<p>A hand was laid upon Freder's shoulder.</p>

<p>He turned his head. He looked into the face of his
father.</p>

<p>Was that his father? Was that Joh Fredersen, the master over
the great Metropolis? Had his father such white hair? And so
tormented a brow? And such tortured eyes?</p>

<p>Was there, in this world, after this night of madness,
nothing but horror and death and destruction and
agony&mdash;without end&mdash;?</p>

<p>"What do you want here?" asked Freder, Joh Fredersen's son.
"Do you want to take her away from me? Have you made plans to
part her and me? Is there some mighty undertaking in danger, to
which she and I are to be sacrificed?"</p>

<p>"To whom are you speaking, Freder?" his father asked, very
gently.</p>

<p>Freder did not answer. His eyes opened inquiringly, for he
had heard a voice never heard before. He was silent.</p>

<p>"If you are speaking of Joh Fredersen," continued the very
gentle voice, "then be informed that, this night, Joh Fredersen
died a sevenfold death..."</p>

<p>Freder's eyes, burnt with suffering, were raised to the eyes
which were above him. A piteously sobbing sound came from out
his lips.</p>

<p>"Oh my God&mdash;Father&mdash;! Father...you&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen stooped down above him and above the girl who
lay in Freder's lap.</p>

<p>"She is dying, father...Can't you see she is
dying&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, no!" said his gentle voice. "No, Freder. There was an
hour in my life in which I knelt, as you, holding in my arms the
woman I loved. But she died, indeed. I have studied the face of
the dying to the full. I know it perfectly and shall never again
forget it...The girl is but sleeping. Do not awaken her by
force."</p>

<p>And, with a gesture of inexpressible tenderness, his hand
slipped from Freder's shoulder to the hair of the sleeping
girl.</p>

<p>"Dearest child!" he said. "Dearest child..."</p>

<p>And from out of the depth of her dream the sweetness of a
smile responded to him, before which Joh Fredersen bowed
himself, as before a revelation, not of this world.</p>

<p>Then he left his son and the girl and passed through the
cathedral, made glorious and pleasant by the gay-coloured
ribbons of sunshine.</p>

<p>Freder watched him go until his gaze grew misty. And all at
once, with a sudden, violent, groaning fervour, he raised the
girl's mouth to his mouth and kissed her, as though he wished to
die of it. For, from out the marvel of light, spun into ribbons,
the knowledge had come upon him that it was day, that the
invulnerable transformation of darkness into light was becoming
consummate, in its greatness, in its kindliness, over the
world.</p>

<p>"Come to yourself, Maria, beloved!" he said, entreating her
with his caresses, with his love. "Come to me, beloved! Come to
me!"</p>

<p>The soft response of her heart-beat, of her breathing, caused
a laugh to well up from his throat and the fervour of his
whispered words died on her lips.</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen caught the sound of his son's laugh. He was
already near the door of the cathedral. He stopped and looked at
the stack of pillars, in the delicate, canopied niches of which
stood the saintly men and women, smiling gently.</p>

<p>"You have suffered," thought his dream-filled brain. "You
have been redeemed by suffering. You have attained to bliss...Is
it worth while to suffer?&mdash;Yes."</p>

<p>And he walked out of the cathedral on feet which were still
as though dead, tentatively, he stepped through the mighty doorway,
stood dazzled in the light and swayed as though drunken.</p>

<p>For the wine of suffering which he had drunk, was very heavy,
and intoxicating, and white-hot.</p>

<p>His soul spoke within him as he reeled along:</p>

<p>"I will go home and look for my mother."</p>

<h2><a id="ch24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class="first">"FREDER...?" said the soft Madonna-voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, you beloved! Speak to me! Speak to me!"</p>

<p>"Where are we?"</p>

<p>"In the cathedral." </p>

<p>"Is it day or night?"</p>

<p>"It is day."</p>

<p>"Wasn't your father here, with us, just now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you beloved."</p>

<p>"His hand was on my hair?"</p>

<p>"You felt it?"</p>

<p>"Oh Freder, while your father was standing here it seemed to
me as though I heard a spring rushing within a rock. A spring,
weighted with salt, and red with blood. But I knew too: when the
spring is strong enough to break out through the rock, then if
will be sweeter than the dew and whiter than the light."</p>

<p>"Bless you for your belief, Maria..."</p>

<p>She smiled. She fell silent.</p>

<p>"Why don't you open your eyes, you beloved?" asked Freder's
longing mouth.</p>

<p>"I see," she answered. "I see, Freder...I see a city,
standing in the light..."</p>

<p>"Shall I build it?"</p>

<p>"No, Freder. Not you. Your father."</p>

<p>"My father?"</p>

<p>"Yes..."</p>

<p>"Maria when you spoke of my father, before, this tone of'
love was not in your voice..."</p>

<p>"Since then much has taken place, Freder. Since then, within
a rock, a spring has come to life, heavy with salt and red with
blood. Since then Joh Fredersen's hair has turned snow-white
with deadly fear for his son. Since then have those whom I
called my brothers sinned from excessive suffering. Since then
has Joh Fredersen suffered from excessive sin. Will you not
allow them both, Freder&mdash;your father as well as my
brothers&mdash;to pay for their sin, to atone, to become
reconciled?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Maria."</p>

<p>"Will you help them, you mediator?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Maria."</p>

<p>She opened her eyes and turned the gentle wonder of their
blue towards him. Bending low above her, he saw, in pious
astonishment, how the gay-coloured heavenly kingdom of saintly
legends, which looked down upon her from out the lofty, narrow
church-windows, was reflected in her Madonna-eyes.</p>

<p>Involuntarily he raised his eyes to become aware, for the
first time, of whither he had borne the girl whom he loved.</p>

<p>"God is looking at us!" he whispered, gathering her up to his
heart, with longing arms. "God is smiling to us, Maria."</p>

<p>"Amen," said the girl at his heart.</p>

<h2><a id="ch25"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p class="first">JOH FREDERSEN came to his mother's house.</p>

<p>Death had passed over Metropolis. Destruction of the world
and the Day of Judgment had shouted from out the roars of
explosion, the clanging of the bells of the cathedral. But Joh
Fredersen found his mother as he always found her: in the wide,
soft chair, by the open window, the dark rug over the paralysed
knees, the great Bible on the sloping table before her, in the
beautiful old hands, the figured lace at which she was
sewing.</p>

<p>She turned her eyes towards the door and perceived her
son.</p>

<p>The expression of stern severity on her face became sterner
and more severe.</p>

<p>She said nothing. But about her closed mouth was something
which said: "You are in a bad way, Joh Fredersen..."</p>

<p>And as a judge did she regard him.</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen took his hat from his head. Then she saw the
white hair above his brow...</p>

<p>"Child&mdash;!" she said quietly, stretching her hands out
towards him.</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen fell on his knees by his mother's side. He
threw his arms about her, pressing his head into the lap, which
had borne him. He felt her hands on his hair&mdash;felt how she
touched it, as though fearful of hurting him, as though this
white hair was the mark of an unhealed wound, very near the
heart, and heard her dear voice saying:</p>

<p>"Child...My child...My poor child."</p>

<p>The rustling of the walnut tree before the window filled a
long silence with longing and affection. Then Joh Fredersen
began to speak. He spoke with the eagerness of one bathing
himself in Holy water, with the fervour of a conquered one,
confessing, with the redemption of one ready to do any penance,
and who was pardoned. His voice was soft and sounded as though
coming from far away, from the farther bank of a wide river.</p>

<p>He spoke of Freder; then his voice failed him entirely. He
raised himself from his knees and walked through the room. When
he turned around there stood in his eyes a smiling loneliness
and the realisation of a necessary giving-up&mdash;of the tree's
giving up of the ripe fruit.</p>

<p>"It seemed to me," he said, gazing into space, "as though I
saw his face for the first time...when he spoke to me this
morning...It is a strange face, mother. It is quite my
face&mdash;and yet quite his own. It is the face of his
beautiful, dead mother and yet it is, at the same time,
fashioned after Maria's features, as though he were born for the
second time of that young, virginal creature. But it is, at the
same time, the face of the masses&mdash;confident in her,
related to her, as near to her as brothers..."</p>

<p>"How do you come to know the face of the masses, Joh?" asked
his mother gently.</p>

<p>For a long time Joh Fredersen gave no answer.</p>

<p>"You are quite right to ask, mother," he said then. "From the
heights of the New Tower of Babel I could not distinguish it.
And in the night of lunacy, in which I perceived it for the
first time it was so distorted in its own horror that it no more
resembled itself...</p>

<p>"When I came out of the cathedral door in the morning the
masses were standing as one man, looking towards me. Then the
face of the masses was turned towards me. Then I saw, it was not
old, was not young, was sorrowless and joyless.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" I asked. And one answered:</p>

<p>"We are waiting, Mr. Fredersen...."</p>

<p>"For what?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"We are waiting," continued the spokesman, "for someone to
come, who will tell us what way we should go...."</p>

<p>"And you want to be this one, Joh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother."</p>

<p>"And will they trust in you?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, mother. If we had been living a thousand
years earlier, I should, perhaps, set out on the high road, with
pilgrim's staff and cockle hat, and seek the way to the Holy
Land of my belief, not returning home until I had cooled my
feet, hot from wandering, in the Jordan, and, in the places of
redemption, had prayed to the Redeemer. And, if I were not the
man I am, it might come to pass that I should set out on a
journey along the roads of those who walk in the shadow. I
should, perhaps, sit with them in the corners of misery and
learn to comprehend their groans and their curses into which a
life of hell has transformed their prayers...For, from
comprehension comes love, and I am longing to love mankind,
mother...But I believe that acting is better than making
pilgrimages, and that a good deed is worth more than the best of
words. I believe, too, that I shall find the way to do so, for
there are two standing by me, who wish to help me..."</p>

<p>"Three, Joh..."</p>

<p>The eyes of the son sought the gaze of the mother.</p>

<p>"Who is the third?"</p>

<p>"Hel..."</p>

<p>"...Hel&mdash;?..."</p>

<p>"Yes, child."</p>

<p>Joh Fredersen remained silent.</p>

<p>She turned over the pages of her Bible, until she found what
she sought. It was a letter. She took it and said, still holding
it lovingly:</p>

<p>"I received this letter from Hel before she died. She asked
me to give it you, when, as she said, you had found your way
home to me and to yourself..."</p>

<p>Soundlessly moving his; lips, Joh Fredersen stretched out his
hand for the letter.</p>

<p>The yellowish envelope contained but a thin sheet of paper.
Upon it stood, in the handwriting of a girlish woman:</p>

<p>"I am going to God, and do not know when you will read these
lines, Joh. But I know you will read them one day, and, until
you come, I shall exhaust the eternal blissfulness in praying
God to forgive me for making use of two Sayings from His Holy
Book, in order to give you my heart, Joh."</p>

<p>"One is: I have loved thee with an everlasting love. The
other:"</p>

<p>"Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the
world!"</p>

<p>"Hel."</p>

<p>It took Joh Fredersen a long time before he succeeded in
replacing the thin sheet of note-paper in the envelope. His eyes
gazed through the open window by which his mother sat. He saw,
drawing across the soft, blue sky, great, white clouds, which
were like ships, laden with treasures from a far-off world.</p>

<p>"Of what are you thinking, child?" asked his mother's voice,
with care.</p>

<p>But Joh Fredersen gave her no answer. His heart, utterly
redeemed, spoke stilly within him:</p>

<p>"Unto the end of the world...Unto the end of the world."</p>
