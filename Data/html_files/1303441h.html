  <h2><a id="chap01"
     name="chap01">I. &mdash; THE PRINCIPAL CHARACTER IN THE STORY</a></h2>

  <h3>§ I</h3>

  <p class="first">If you (presuming you are of the sex that does such
  things)&mdash;if you had gone into the Drapery Emporium&mdash;which is really
  only magnificent for shop&mdash;of Messrs. Antrobus &amp; Co.&mdash;a
  perfectly fictitious "Co.," by the bye&mdash;of Putney, on the 14th of
  August, 1895, had turned to the right-hand side, where the blocks of white
  linen and piles of blankets rise up to the rail from which the pink and blue
  prints depend, you might have been served by the central figure of this story
  that is now beginning. He would have come forward, bowing and swaying, he
  would have extended two hands with largish knuckles and enormous cuffs over
  the counter, and he would have asked you, protruding a pointed chin and
  without the slightest anticipation of pleasure in his manner, what he might
  have the pleasure of showing you. Under certain circumstances&mdash;as, for
  instance, hats, baby linen, gloves, silks, lace, or curtains&mdash;he would
  simply have bowed politely, and with a drooping expression, and making a kind
  of circular sweep, invited you to "step this way," and so led you beyond his
  ken; but under other and happier conditions, &mdash;huckaback, blankets,
  dimity, cretonne, linen, calico, are cases in point,&mdash;he would have
  requested you to take a seat, emphasising the hospitality by leaning over the
  counter and gripping a chair back in a spasmodic manner, and so proceeded to
  obtain, unfold, and exhibit his goods for your consideration. Under which
  happier circumstances you might&mdash;if of an observing turn of mind and not
  too much of a housewife to be inhuman&mdash;have given the central figure of
  this story less cursory attention.</p>

    <p><a id="pic2"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>
  <br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1303441h-images/WOC02.jpg"
         alt="He would have come forward, bowing and swaying">
  </div>

  <p class="caption">He would have come forward, bowing and swaying...</p><br>

  <p>Now if you had noticed anything about him, it would have been chiefly to
  notice how little he was noticeable. He wore the black morning coat, the
  black tie, and the speckled grey nether parts (descending into shadow and
  mystery below the counter) of his craft. He was of a pallid complexion, hair
  of a kind of dirty fairness, greyish eyes, and a skimpy, immature moustache
  under his peaked indeterminate nose. His features were all small, but none
  ill-shaped. A rosette of pins decorated the lappel of his coat. His remarks,
  you would observe, were entirely what people used to call cliche, formulae
  not organic to the occasion, but stereotyped ages ago and learnt years since
  by heart. "This, madam," he would say, "is selling very well" "We are doing a
  very good article at four three a yard." "We could show you some. thing
  better, of course." "No trouble, madam, I assure you." Such were the simple
  counters of his intercourse. So, I say, he would have presented himself to
  your superficial observation. He would have danced about behind the counter,
  have neatly refolded the goods he had shown you, have put on one side those
  you selected, extracted a little book with a carbon leaf and a tinfoil sheet
  from a fixture, made you out a little bill in that weak flourishing hand
  peculiar to drapers, and have bawled "Sayn!" Then a puffy little shop-walker
  would have come into view, looked at the bill for a second, very hard
  (showing you a parting down the middle of his head meanwhile), have scribbled
  a still more flourishing J.M. all over the document, have asked you if there
  was nothing more, have stood by you&mdash;supposing that you were paying
  cash&mdash;until the central figure of this story reappeared with the change.
  One glance more at him, and the puffy little shop-walker would have been
  bowing you out, with fountains of civilities at work all about you. And so
  the interview would have terminated.</p>

  <p>But real literature, as distinguished from anecdote, does not concern
  itself with superficial appearances alone. Literature is revelation. Modern
  literature is indecorous revelation. It is the duty of the earnest author to
  tell you what you would not have seen&mdash;even at the cost of some blushes.
  And the thing that you would not have seen about this young man, and the
  thing of the greatest moment to this story, the thing that must be told if
  the book is to be written, was&mdash;let us face it bravely&mdash;the
  Remarkable Condition of this Young Man's Legs.</p>

  <p>Let us approach the business with dispassionate explicitness. Let us
  assume something of the scientific spirit, the hard, almost professorial tone
  of the conscientious realist. Let us treat this young man's legs as a mere
  diagram, and indicate the points of interest with the unemotional precision
  of a lecturer's pointer. And so to our revelation. On the internal aspect of
  the right ankle of this young man you would have observed, ladies and
  gentlemen, a contusion and an abrasion; on the internal aspect of the left
  ankle a contusion also; on its external aspect a large yellowish bruise. On
  his left shin there were two bruises, one a leaden yellow graduating here and
  there into purple, and another, obviously of more recent date, of a blotchy
  red&mdash;tumid and threatening. Proceeding up the left leg in a spiral
  manner, an unnatural hardness and redness would have been discovered on the
  upper aspect of the calf, and above the knee and on the inner side, an
  extraordinary expanse of bruised surface, a kind of closely stippled shading
  of contused points. The right leg would be found to be bruised in a
  marvellous manner all about and under the knee, and particularly on the
  interior aspect of the knee. So far we may proceed with our details. Fired by
  these discoveries, an investigator might perhaps have pursued his inquiries
  further&mdash;to bruises on the shoulders, elbows, and even the finger
  joints, of the central figure of our story. He had indeed been bumped and
  battered at an extraordinary number of points. But enough of realistic
  description is as good as a feast, and we have exhibited enough for our
  purpose. Even in literature one must know where to draw the line.</p>

  <p>Now the reader may be inclined to wonder how a respectable young shopman
  should have got his legs, and indeed himself generally, into such a dreadful
  condition. One might fancy that he had been sitting with his nether
  extremities in some complicated machinery, a threshing-machine, say, or one
  of those hay-making furies. But Sherlock Holmes (now happily dead) would have
  fancied nothing of the kind. He would have recognised at once that the
  bruises on the internal aspect of the left leg, considered in the light of
  the distribution of the other abrasions and contusions, pointed unmistakably
  to the violent impact of the Mounting Beginner upon the bicycling saddle, and
  that the ruinous state of the right knee was equally eloquent of the
  concussions attendant on that person's hasty, frequently causeless, and
  invariably ill-conceived descents. One large bruise on the shin is even more
  characteristic of the 'prentice cyclist, for upon every one of them waits the
  jest of the unexpected treadle. You try at least to walk your machine in an
  easy manner, and whack!&mdash;you are rubbing your shin. So out of innocence
  we ripen. Two bruises on that place mark a certain want of aptitude in
  learning, such as one might expect in a person unused to muscular exercise.
  Blisters on the hands are eloquent of the nervous clutch of the wavering
  rider. And so forth, until Sherlock is presently explaining, by the help of
  the minor injuries, that the machine ridden is an old-fashioned affair with a
  fork instead of the diamond frame, a cushioned tire, well worn on the hind
  wheel, and a gross weight all on of perhaps three-and-forty pounds.</p>

  <p>The revelation is made. Behind the decorous figure of the attentive
  shopman that I had the honour of showing you at first, rises a vision of a
  nightly struggle, of two dark figures and a machine in a dark road,&mdash;the
  road, to be explicit, from Roehampton to Putney Hill,&mdash;and with this
  vision is the sound of a heel spurning the gravel, a gasping and grunting, a
  shouting of "Steer, man, steer!" a wavering unsteady flight, a spasmodic
  turning of the missile edifice of man and machine, and a collapse. Then you
  descry dimly through the dusk the central figure of this story sitting by the
  roadside and rubbing his leg at some new place, and his friend, sympathetic
  (but by no means depressed), repairing the displacement of the
  handle-bar.</p>

  <p>Thus even in a shop assistant does the warmth of manhood assert itself,
  and drive him against all the conditions of his calling, against the counsels
  of prudence and the restrictions of his means, to seek the wholesome delights
  of exertion and danger and pain. And our first examination of the draper
  reveals beneath his draperies&mdash;the man! To which initial fact (among
  others) we shall come again in the end.</p><br>

  <h3>§ II</h3>

  <p class="first">But enough of these revelations. The central figure of our
  story is now going along behind the counter, a draper indeed, with your
  purchases in his arms, to the warehouse, where the various articles you have
  selected will presently be packed by the senior porter and sent to you.
  Returning thence to his particular place, he lays hands on a folded piece of
  gingham, and gripping the corners of the folds in his hands, begins to
  straighten them punctiliously. Near him is an apprentice, apprenticed to the
  same high calling of draper's assistant, a ruddy, red-haired lad in a very
  short tailless black coat and a very high collar, who is deliberately
  unfolding and refolding some patterns of cretonne. By twenty-one he too may
  hope to be a full-blown assistant, even as Mr. Hoopdriver. Prints depend from
  the brass rails above them, behind are fixtures full of white packages
  containing, as inscriptions testify, <i>Lino</i>, <i>Hd Bk</i>, and
  <i>Mull</i>. You might imagine to see them that the two were both intent upon
  nothing but smoothness of textile and rectitude of fold. But to tell the
  truth, neither is thinking of the mechanical duties in hand. The assistant is
  dreaming of the delicious time&mdash;only four hours off now&mdash;when he
  will resume the tale of his bruises and abrasions. The apprentice is nearer
  the long long thoughts of boyhood, and his imagination rides <i>cap-a-pie</i>
  through the chambers of his brain, seeking some knightly quest in honour of
  that Fair Lady, the last but one of the girl apprentices to the dress-making
  upstairs. He inclines rather to street fighting against
  revolutionaries&mdash;because then she could see him from the window.</p>

  <p>Jerking them back to the present comes the puffy little shop-walker, with
  a paper in his hand. The apprentice becomes extremely active. The shopwalker
  eyes the goods in hand. "Hoopdriver," he says, "how's that line of g-sez-x
  ginghams? "</p>

  <p>Hoopdriver returns from an imaginary triumph over the uncertainties of
  dismounting. "They're going fairly well, sir. But the larger checks seem
  hanging."</p>

  <p>The shop-walker brings up parallel to the counter. "Any particular time
  when you want your holidays?" he asks.</p>

  <p>Hoopdriver pulls at his skimpy moustache. "No&mdash;Don't want them too
  late, sir, of course."</p>

  <p>"How about this day week?"</p>

  <p>Hoopdriver becomes rigidly meditative, gripping the corners of the gingham
  folds in his hands. His face is eloquent of conflicting considerations. Can
  he learn it in a week? That's the question. Otherwise Briggs will get next
  week, and he will have to wait until September&mdash;when the weather is
  often uncertain. He is naturally of a sanguine disposition. All drapers have
  to be, or else they could never have the faith they show in the beauty,
  washability, and unfading excellence of the goods they sell you. The decision
  comes at last. "That'll do me very well," said Mr. Hoopdriver, terminating
  the pause.</p>

  <p>The die is cast.</p>

  <p>The shop-walker makes a note of it and goes on to Briggs in the "dresses,"
  the next in the strict scale of precedence of the Drapery Emporium. Mr.
  Hoopdriver in alternating spasms anon straightens his gingham and anon
  becomes meditative, with his tongue in the hollow of his decaying wisdom
  tooth.</p><br>

  <h3>§ III</h3>

  <p class="first">At supper that night, holiday talk held undisputed sway. Mr.
  Pritchard spoke of "Scotland," Miss Isaacs clamoured of Bettws-y-Coed, Mr.
  Judson displayed a proprietary interest in the Norfolk Broads. <i>"I?"</i>
  said Hoopdriver when the question came to him. "Why, cycling, of course."</p>

  <p>"You're never going to ride that dreadful machine of yours, day after
  day?" said Miss Howe of the Costume Department.</p>

  <p>"I am," said Hoopdriver as calmly as possible, pulling at the insufficient
  moustache. "I'm going for a Cycling Tour. Along the South Coast."</p>

  <p>"Well, all I hope, Mr. Hoopdriver, is that you'll get fine weather," said
  Miss Howe. "And not come any nasty croppers."</p>

  <p>"And done forget some tinscher of arnica in yer bag," said the junior
  apprentice in the very high collar. (He had witnessed one of the lessons at
  the top of Putney Hill.)</p>

  <p>"You stow it," said Mr. Hoopdriver, looking hard and threateningly at the
  junior apprentice, and suddenly adding in a tone of bitter contempt,&mdash;"
  Jampot."</p>

  <p>"I'm getting fairly safe upon it now," he told Miss Howe.</p>

  <p>At other times Hoopdriver might have further resented the satirical
  efforts of the apprentice, but his mind was too full of the projected Tour to
  admit any petty delicacies of dignity. He left the supper table early, so
  that he might put in a good hour at the desperate gymnastics up the
  Roehampton Road before it would be time to come back for locking up. When the
  gas was turned off for the night he was sitting on the edge of his bed,
  rubbing arnica into his knee&mdash;a new and very big place&mdash;and
  studying a Road Map of the South of England. Briggs of the "dresses," who
  shared the room with him, was sitting up in bed and trying to smoke in the
  dark. Briggs had never been on a cycle in his life, but he felt Hoopdriver's
  inexperience and offered such advice as occurred to him.</p>

  <p class="caption">He was sitting on the edge of his bed, rubbing arnica into
  his knee.</p><br>

  <p>"Have the machine thoroughly well oiled," said Briggs, "carry one or two
  lemons with you, don't tear yourself to death the first day, and sit upright.
  Never lose control of the machine, and always sound the bell on every
  possible opportunity. You mind those things, and nothing very much can't
  happen to you, Hoopdriver&mdash;you take my word."</p>

  <p>He would lapse into silence for a minute, save perhaps for a curse or so
  at his pipe, and then break out with an entirely different set of tips.</p>

  <p>"Avoid running over dogs, Hoopdriver, whatever you do. It's one of the
  worst things you can do to run over a dog. Never let the machine
  buckle&mdash;there was a man killed only the other day through his wheel
  buckling&mdash;don't scorch, don't ride on the foot-path, keep your own side
  of the road, and if you see a tram-line, go round the corner at once, and
  hurry off into the next county&mdash;and always light up before dark. You
  mind just a few little things like that, Hoopdriver, and nothing much can't
  happen to you&mdash;you take my word."</p>

  <p>"Right you are!" said Hoopdriver. "Good-night, old man."</p>

  <p>"Good-night," said Briggs, and there was silence for a space, save for the
  succulent respiration of the pipe. Hoopdriver rode off into Dreamland on his
  machine, and was scarcely there before he was pitched back into the world of
  sense again.&mdash;Something&mdash;what was it?</p>

  <p>"Never oil the steering. It's fatal," a voice that came from round a
  fitful glow of light, was saying. "And clean the chain daily with black-lead.
  You mind just a few little things like that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Lord <i>love</i> us!" said Hoopdriver, and pulled the bedclothes over his
  ears.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="chap02"
     name="chap02">II. &mdash; THE RIDING FORTH OF MR. HOOPDRIVER</a></h2>

  <h3>§ IV</h3>

  <p class="first">Only those who toil six long days out of the seven, and all
  the year round, save for one brief glorious fortnight or ten days in the
  summer time, know the exquisite sensations of the First Holiday Morning. All
  the dreary, uninteresting routine drops from you suddenly, your chains fall
  about your feet. All at once you are Lord of yourself, Lord of every hour in
  the long, vacant day; you may go where you please, call none Sir or Madame,
  have a lappel free of pins, doff your black morning coat, and wear the colour
  of your heart, and be a Man. You grudge sleep, you grudge eating, and
  drinking even, their intrusion on those exquisite moments. There will be no
  more rising before breakfast in casual old clothing, to go dusting and
  getting ready in a cheerless, shutterdarkened, wrappered-up shop, no more
  imperious cries of, "Forward, Hoopdriver," no more hasty meals, and weary
  attendance on fitful old women, for ten blessed days. The first morning is by
  far the most glorious, for you hold your whole fortune in your hands.
  Thereafter, every night, comes a pang, a spectre, that will not be
  exorcised&mdash;the premonition of the return. The shadow of going back, of
  being put in the cage again for another twelve months, lies blacker and
  blacker across the sunlight. But on the first morning of the ten the holiday
  has no past, and ten days seems as good as infinity.</p>

  <p>And it was fine, full of a promise of glorious days, a deep blue sky with
  dazzling piles of white cloud here and there, as though celestial haymakers
  had been piling the swathes of last night's clouds into cocks for a coming
  cartage. There were thrushes in the Richmond Road, and a lark on Putney
  Heath. The freshness of dew was in the air; dew or the relics of an overnight
  shower glittered on the leaves and grass. Hoopdriver had breakfasted early by
  Mrs. Gunn's complaisance. He wheeled his machine up Putney Hill, and his
  heart sang within him. Halfway up, a dissipated-looking black cat rushed home
  across flile road and vanished under a gate. All the big red-brick houses
  behind the variegated shrubs and trees had their blinds down still, and he
  would not have changed places with a soul in any one of them for a hundred
  pounds.</p>

  <p>He had on his new brown cycling suit&mdash;a handsome Norfolk jacket thing
  for 30/&mdash;and his legs&mdash;those martyr legs&mdash;were more than
  consoled by thick chequered stockings, "thin in the foot, thick in the leg,"
  for all they had endured. A neat packet of American cloth behind the saddle
  contained his change of raiment, and the bell and the handle-bar and the hubs
  and lamp, albeit a trifle freckled by wear, glittered blindingly in the
  rising sunlight. And at the top of the hill, after only one unsuccessful
  attempt, which, somehow, terminated on the green, Hoopdriver mounted, and
  with a stately and cautious restraint in his pace, and a dignified curvature
  of path, began his great Cycling Tour along the Southern Coast.</p>

  <p>There is only one phrase to describe his course at this stage, and that
  is&mdash;voluptuous curves. He did not ride fast, he did not ride straight,
  an exacting critic might say he did not ride well&mdash;but he rode
  generously, opulently, using the whole road and even nibbling at the
  footpath. The excitement never flagged. So far he had never passed or been
  passed by anything, but as yet the day was young and the road was clear. He
  doubted his steering so much that, for the present, he had resolved to
  dismount at the approach of anything else upon wheels. The shadows of the
  trees lay very long and blue across the road, the morning sunlight was like
  amber fire.</p>

  <p>At the cross-roads at the top of West Hill, where the cattle trough
  stands, he turned towards Kingston and set himself to scale the little bit of
  ascent. An early heath-keeper, in his velveteen jacket, marvelled at his
  efforts. And while he yet struggled, the head of a carter rose over the
  brow.</p>

  <p>At the sight of him Mr. Hoopdriver, according to his previous
  determination, resolved to dismount. He tightened the brake, and the machine
  stopped dead. He was trying to think what he did with his right leg whilst
  getting off. He gripped the handles and released the brake, standing on the
  left pedal and waving his right foot in the air. Then&mdash;these things take
  so long in the telling&mdash;he found the machine was falling over to the
  right. While he was deciding upon a plan of action, gravitation appears to
  have been busy. He was still irresolute when he found the machine on the
  ground, himself kneeling upon it, and a vague feeling in his mind that again
  Providence had dealt harshly with his shin. This happened when he was just
  level with the heathkeeper. The man in the approaching cart stood up to see
  the ruins better.</p>

  <p>"<i>That</i> ain't the way to get off," said the heathkeeper.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoopdriver picked up the machine. The handle was twisted askew again
  He said something under his breath. He would have to unscrew the beastly
  thing.</p>

  <p>"<i>That</i> ain't the way to get off," repeated the heathkeeper, after a
  silence.</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> know that," said Mr. Hoopdriver, testily, determined to overlook
  the new specimen on his shin at any cost. He unbuckled the wallet behind the
  saddle, to get out a screw hammer.</p>

  <p>"If you know it ain't the way to get off&mdash;whaddyer do it for?" said
  the heath-keeper, in a tone of friendly controversy.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoopdriver got out his screw hammer and went to the handle. He was
  annoyed. "That's my business, I suppose," he said, fumbling with the screw.
  The unusual exertion had made his hands shake frightfully.</p>

  <p>The heath-keeper became meditative, and twisted his stick in his hands
  behind his back. "You've broken yer 'andle, ain't yer?" he said presently.
  Just then the screw hammer slipped off the nut. Mr. Hoopdriver used a nasty,
  low word.</p>

  <p>"They're trying things, them bicycles," said the heath-keeper, charitably.
  "Very trying." Mr. Hoopdriver gave the nut a vicious turn and suddenly stood
  up&mdash;he was holding the front wheel between his knees. "I wish," said he,
  with a catch in his voice, "I wish you'd leave off staring at me."</p>

    <p><a id="pic4"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>
  <br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1303441h-images/WOC04.jpg"
         alt="I wish you'd leave off staring at me">
  </div>

  <p class="caption">"I wish you'd leave off staring at me."</p><br>

  <p>Then with the air of one who has delivered an ultimatum, he began
  replacing the screw hammer in the wallet.</p>

  <p>The heath-keeper never moved. Possibly he raised his eyebrows, and
  certainly he stared harder than he did before. "You're pretty unsociable," he
  said slowly, as Mr. Hoopdriver seized the handles and stood ready to mount as
  soon as the cart had passed.</p>

  <p>The indignation gathered slowly but surely. "Why don't you ride on a
  private road of your own if no one ain't to speak to you?" asked the heath-
  keeper, perceiving more and more clearly the bearing of the matter. "Can't no
  one make a passin' remark to you, Touchy? Ain't I good enough to speak to
  you? Been struck wooden all of a sudden?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoopdriver stared into the Immensity of the Future. He was rigid with
  emotion. It was like abusing the Lions in Trafalgar Square. But the
  heathkeeper felt his honour was at stake.</p>

  <p>"Don't you make no remarks to <i>'im,</i>" said the keeper as the carter
  came up broadside to them. "'E's a bloomin' dook, 'e is. 'E don't converse
  with no one under a earl. 'E's off to Windsor, 'e is; that's why 'e's
  stickin' his be'ind out so haughty. Pride! Why, 'e's got so much of it, 'e
  has to carry some of it in that there bundle there, for fear 'e'd bust if 'e
  didn't ease hisself a bit&mdash;<i>'E</i>&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Mr. Hoopdriver heard no more. He was hopping vigorously along the
  road, in a spasmodic attempt to remount.He missed the treadle once and swore
  viciously, to the keeper's immense delight. "Nar! Nar!" said the heath-
  keeper.</p>

    <p><a id="pic5"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>
  <br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1303441h-images/WOC05.jpg"
         alt="He was hopping vigorously along the road.">
  </div>

  <p class="caption">He was hopping vigorously along the road.</p><br>

  <p>In another moment Mr. Hoopdriver was up, and after one terrific lurch of
  the machine, the heathkeeper dropped out of earshot. Mr. Hoopdriver would
  have liked to look back at his enemy, but he usually twisted round and upset
  if he tried that. He had to imagine the indignant heath-keeper telling the
  carter all about it. He tried to infuse as much disdain aspossible into his
  retreating aspect.</p>

  <p>He drove on his sinuous way down the dip by the new mere and up the little
  rise to the crest of the hill that drops into Kingston Vale; and so
  remarkable is the psychology of cycling, that he rode all the straighter and
  easier because the emotions the heathkeeper had aroused relieved his mind of
  the constant expectation of collapse that had previously unnerved him. To
  ride a bicycle properly is very like a love affair&mdash;chiefly it is a
  matter of faith. Believe you do it, and the thing is done; doubt, and, for
  the life of you, you cannot.</p>

  <p>Now you may perhaps imagine that as he rode on, his feelings towards the
  heath-keeper were either vindictive or remorseful,&mdash;vindictive for the
  aggravation or remorseful for his own injudicious display of ill temper. As a
  matter of fact, they were nothing of the sort. A sudden, a wonderful
  gratitude, possessed him. The Glory of the Holidays had resumed its sway with
  a sudden accession of splendour. At the crest of the hill he put his feet
  upon the footrests, and now riding moderately straight, went, with a
  palpitating brake, down that excellent descent. A new delight was in his
  eyes, quite over and above the pleasure of rushing through the keen, sweet,
  morning air. He reached out his thumb and twanged his bell out of sheer
  happiness.</p>

  <p>"'He's a bloomin' Dook&mdash;he is!'" said Mr. Hoopdriver to himself, in a
  soft undertone, as he went soaring down the hill, and again, "'He's a
  bloomin' Dook!"' He opened his mouth in a silent laugh. It was having a
  decent cut did it. His social superiority had been so evident that even a man
  like that noticed it. No more Manchester Department for ten days! Out of
  Manchester, a Man. The draper Hoopdriver, the Hand, had vanished from
  existence. Instead was a gentleman, a man of pleasure, with a five-pound
  note, two sovereigns, and some silver at various convenient points of his
  person. At any rate as good as a Dook, if not precisely in the peerage.
  Involuntarily at the thought of his funds Hoopdriver's right hand left the
  handle and sought his breast pocket, to be immediately recalled by a violent
  swoop of the machine towards the cemetery. Whirroo! Just missed that
  half-brick! Mischievous brutes there were in the world to put such a thing in
  the road. Some blooming 'Arry or other! Ought to prosecute a few of these
  roughs, and the rest would know better. That must be the buckle of the wallet
  was rattling on the mud-guard. How cheerfully the wheels buzzed!</p>

  <p>The cemetery was very silent and peaceful, but the Vale was waking, and
  windows rattled and squeaked up, and a white dog came out of one of the
  houses and yelped at him. He got off, rather breathless, at the foot of
  Kingston Hill, and pushed up. Halfway up, an early milk chariot rattled by
  him; two dirty men with bundles came hurrying down. Hoopdriver felt sure they
  were burglars, carrying home the swag.</p>

  <p>It was up Kingston Hill that he first noticed a peculiar feeling, a slight
  tightness at his knees; but he noticed, too, at the top that he rode
  straighter than he did before. The pleasure of riding straight blotted out
  these first intimations of fatigue. A man on horseback appeared; Hoopdriver,
  in a tumult of soul at his own temerity, passed him. Then down the hill into
  Kingston, with the screw hammer, behind in the wallet, rattling against the
  oil can. He passed, without misadventure, a fruiterer's van and a sluggish
  cartload of bricks. And in Kingston Hoopdriver, with the most exquisite
  sensations, saw the shutters half removed from a draper's shop, and two
  yawning youths, in dusty old black jackets and with dirty white comforters
  about their necks, clearing up the planks and boxes and wrappers in the
  window, preparatory to dressing it out. Even so had Hoopdriver been on the
  previous day. But now, was he not a bloomin' Dook, palpably in the sight of
  common men? Then round the corner to the right&mdash;bell banged
  furiously&mdash;and so along the road to Surbiton.</p>

  <p>Whoop for Freedom and Adventure! Every now and then a house with an
  expression of sleepy surprise would open its eye as he passed, and to the
  right of him for a mile or so the weltering Thames flashed and glittered.
  Talk of your joie de vivre. Albeit with a certain cramping sensation about
  the knees and calves slowly forcing itself upon his attention.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="chap03"
     name="chap03">III. &mdash; THE SHAMEFUL EPISODE OF THE YOUNG LADY IN
     GREY</a></h2>

  <h3>§ V</h3>

  <p class="first">Now you must understand that Mr. Hoopdriver was not one of
  your fast young men. If he had been King Lemuel, he could not have profited
  more by his mother's instructions. He regarded the feminine sex as something
  to bow to and smirk at from a safe distance. Years of the intimate remoteness
  of a counter leave their mark upon a man. It was an adventure for him to take
  one of the Young Ladies of the establishment to church on a Sunday. Few
  modern young men could have merited less the epithet "Dorg." But I have
  thought at times that his machine may have had something of the blade in its
  metal. Decidedly it was a machine with a past. Mr. Hoopdriver had bought it
  second-hand from Hare's in Putney, and Hare said it had had several owners.
  Second-hand was scarcely the word for it, and Elare was mildly puzzled that
  he should be selling such an antiquity. He said it was perfectly sound, if a
  little old-fashioned, but he was absolutely silent about its moral character.
  It may even have begun its career with a poet, say, in his glorious youth. It
  may have been the bicycle of a Really Bad Man. No one who has ever ridden a
  cycle of any kind but will witness that the things are unaccountably prone to
  pick up bad habits&mdash;and keep them.</p>

  <p>It is undeniable that it became convulsed with the most violent emotions
  directly the Young Lady in Grey appeared. It began an absolutely
  unprecedented Wabble&mdash;unprecedented so far as Hoopdriver's experience
  went. It "showed off"&mdash;the most decadent sinuosity. It left a track like
  one of Beardsley's feathers. He suddenly realised, too, that his cap was
  loose on his head and his breath a mere remnant.</p>

  <p>The Young Lady in Grey was also riding a bicycle. She was dressed in a
  beautiful bluish-gray, and the sun behind her drew her outline in gold and
  left the rest in shadow. Hoopdriver was dimly aware that she was young,
  rather slender, dark, and with a bright colour and bright eyes. Strange
  doubts possessed him as to the nature of her nether costume. He had heard of
  such things of course. French, perhaps. Her handles glittered; a jet of
  sunlight splashed off her bell blindingly. She was approaching the high road
  along an affluent from the villas of Surbiton. fee roads converged
  slantingly. She was travelling at about the same pace as Mr. Hoopdriver. The
  appearances pointed to a meeting at the fork of the roads.</p>

  <p>Hoopdriver was seized with a horrible conflict of doubts. By contrast with
  her he rode disgracefully. Had he not better get off at once and pretend
  something was wrong with his treadle? Yet even the end of getting off was an
  uncertainty. That last occasion on Putney Heath! On the other hand, what
  would happen if he kept on? To go very slow seemed the abnegation of his
  manhood. To crawl after a mere schoolgirl! Besides, she was not riding very
  fast. On the other hand, to thrust himself in front of her, consuming the
  road in his tendril-like advance, seemed an incivility&mdash;greed. He would
  leave her such a very little. His business training made him prone to bow and
  step aside. If only one could take one's hands off the handles, one might
  pass with a silent elevation of the hat, of course. But even that was a
  little suggestive of a funeral.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the roads converged. She was looking at him. She was flushed, a
  little thin, and had very bright eyes. Her red lips fell apart. She may have
  been riding hard, but it looked uncommonly like a faint smile. And the things
  were&mdash;yes!&mdash;<i>rationals</i>! Suddenly an impulse to bolt from the
  situation became clamorous. Mr. Hoopdriver pedalled convulsively, intending
  to pass her. He jerked against some tin thing on the road, and it flew up
  between front wheel and mud-guard. He twisted round towards her. Had the
  machine a devil?</p>

  <p>At that supreme moment it came across him that he would have done wiser to
  dismount. He gave a frantic 'whoop' and tried to get round, then, as he
  seemed falling over, he pulled the handles straight again and to the left by
  an instinctive motion, and shot behind her hind wheel, missing her by a
  hair's breadth. The pavement kerb awaited him. He tried to recover, and found
  himself jumped up on the pavement and riding squarely at a neat wooden
  paling. He struck this with a terrific impact and shot forward off his saddle
  into a clumsy entanglement. Then he began to tumble over sideways, and
  completed the entire figure in a sitting position on the gravel, with his
  feet between the fork and the stay of the machine. The concussion on the
  gravel shook his entire being. He remained in that position, wishing that he
  had broken his neck, wishing even more heartily that he had never been born.
  The glory of life had departed. Bloomin' Dook, indeed! These unwomanly
  women!</p>

  <div align="center">

         alt="A sitting position on the gravel">
  </div>

  <p class="caption">A sitting position on the gravel.</p><br>

  <p>There was a soft whirr, the click of a brake, two footfalls, and the Young
  Lady in Grey stood holding her machine. She had turned round and come back to
  him. The warm sunlight now was in her face. "Are you hurt?" she said. She had
  a pretty, clear, girlish voice. She was really very young&mdash;quite a girl,
  in fact. And rode so well! It was a bitter draught.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoopdriver stood up at once. "Not a bit," he said, a little ruefully.
  He became painfully aware that large patches of gravel scarcely improve the
  appearance of a Norfolk suit. "I'm very sorry indeed&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's my fault," she said, interrupting and so saving him on the very
  verge of calling her 'Miss.' (He knew 'Miss' was wrong, but it was
  deep-seated habit with him.) "I tried to pass you on the wrong side." Her
  face and eyes seemed all alive. "It's my place to be sorry."</p>

  <p>"But it was my steering&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I ought to have seen you were a Novice"&mdash;with a touch of
  superiority. "But you rode so straight coming along there!"</p>

  <p>She really was&mdash;dashed pretty. Mr. Hoopdriver's feelings passed the
  nadir. When he spoke again there was the faintest flavour of the aristocratic
  in his voice.</p>

  <p>"It's my first ride, as a matter of fact. But that's no excuse for my ah!
  blundering&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Your finger's bleeding," she said, abruptly.</p>

  <p>He saw his knuckle was barked. "I didn't feel it," he said, feeling
  manly.</p>

  <p>"You don't at first. Have you any stickingplaster? If not&mdash;" She
  balanced her machine against herself. She had a little side pocket, and she
  whipped out a small packet of sticking-plaster with a pair of scissors in a
  sheath at the side, and cut off a generous portion. He had a wild impulse to
  ask her to stick it on for him. Controlled. "Thank you," he said.</p>

  <p>"Machine all right?" she asked, looking past him at the prostrate vehicle,
  her hands on her handle-bar. For the first time Hoopdriver did not feel proud
  of his machine.</p>

  <p>He turned and began to pick up the fallen fabric. He looked over his
  shoulder, and she was gone, turned his head over the other shoulder down the
  road, and she was riding off. <i>"Orf!"</i> said Mr. Hoopdriver. "Well, I'm
  blowed!&mdash;Talk about Slap Up!" (His aristocratic refinement rarely
  adorned his speech in his private soliloquies.) His mind was whirling. One
  fact was clear. A most delightful and novel human being had flashed across
  his horizon and was going out of his life again. The Holiday madness was in
  his blood. She looked round!</p>

  <p>At that he rushed his machine into the road, and began a hasty ascent.
  Unsuccessful. Try again. Confound it, will he <i>never</i> be able to get up
  on the thing again? She will be round the corner in a minute. Once more. Ah!
  Pedal! Wabble! No! Right this time! He gripped the handles and put his head
  down. He would overtake her.</p>

  <p>The situation was primordial. The Man beneath prevailed for a moment over
  the civilised superstructure, the Draper. He pushed at the pedals with
  archaic violence. So Palaeolithic man may have ridden his simple bicycle of
  chipped flint in pursuit of his exogamous affinity. She vanished round the
  corner. His effort was Titanic. What should he say when he overtook her? That
  scarcely disturbed him at first. How fine she had looked, flushed with the
  exertion of riding, breathing a little fast, but elastic and active! Talk
  about your ladylike, homekeeping girls with complexions like cold veal! But
  what should he say to her? That was a bother. And he could not lift his cap
  without risking a repetition of his previous ignominy. She was a real Young
  Lady. No mistake about that! None of your blooming shop girls. (There is no
  greater contempt in the world than that of shop men for shop girls, unless it
  be that of shop girls for shop men.) Phew! This was work. A certain numbness
  came and went at his knees.</p>

  <p>"May I ask to whom I am indebted?" he panted to himself, trying it over.
  That might do. Lucky he had a card case! A hundred a shilling&mdash;while you
  wait. He was getting winded. The road was certainly a bit uphill. He turned
  the corner and saw a long stretch of road, and a grey dress vanishing. He set
  his teeth. Had he gained on her at all? "Monkey on a gridiron!" yelped a
  small boy. Hoopdriver redoubled his efforts. His breath became audible, his
  steering unsteady, his pedalling positively ferocious. A drop of perspiration
  ran into his eye, irritant as acid. The road really was uphill beyond
  dispute. All his physiology began to cry out at him. A last tremendous effort
  brought him to the corner and showed yet another extent of shady roadway,
  empty save for a baker's van. His front wheel suddenly shrieked aloud. "Oh
  Lord!" said Hoopdriver, relaxing.</p>

  <p>Anyhow she was not in sight. He got off unsteadily, and for a moment his
  legs felt like wisps of cotton. He balanced his machine against the grassy
  edge of the path and sat down panting. His hands were gnarled with swollen
  veins and shaking palpably, his breath came viscid.</p>

  <p>"I'm hardly in training yet," he remarked. His legs had gone leaden. "I
  don't feel as though I'd had a mouthful of breakfast." Presently he slapped
  his side pocket and produced therefrom a brand-new cigarette case and a
  packet of Vansittart's Red Herring cigarettes. He filled the case. Then his
  eye fell with a sudden approval on the ornamental chequering of his new
  stockings. The expression in his eyes faded slowly to abstract
  meditation.</p>

  <p>"She <i>was</i> a stunning girl," he said. "I wonder if I shall ever set
  eyes on her again. And she knew how to ride, too! Wonder what she thought of
  me."</p>

  <p>The phrase 'bloomin' Dook' floated into his mind with a certain flavour of
  comfort.</p>

  <p>He lit a cigarette, and sat smoking and meditating. He did not even look
  up when vehicles passed. It was perhaps ten minutes before he roused himself.
  "What rot it is! What's the good of thinking such things," he said. "I'm only
  a blessed draper's assistant." (To be exact, he did not say blessed. The
  service of a shop may polish a man's exterior ways, but the 'prentices'
  dormitory is an indifferent school for either manners or morals.) He stood up
  and began wheeling his machine towards Esher. It was going to be a beautiful
  day, and the hedges and trees and the open country were all glorious to his
  town-tired eyes. But it was a little different from the elation of his
  start.</p>

  <p>"Look at the gentleman wizzer bicitle," said a nursemaid on the path to a
  personage in a perambulator. That healed him a little. "'Gentleman wizzer
  bicitle,'&mdash;'bloomin' Dook'&mdash;I can't look so very seedy," he said to
  himself.</p>

  <p>"I <i>wonder</i>&mdash;I should just like to know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There was something very comforting in the track of <i>her</i> pneumatic
  running straight and steady along the road before him. It must be hers. No
  other pneumatic had been along the road that morning. It was just possible,
  of course, that he might see her once more&mdash;coming back. Should he try
  and say something smart? He speculated what manner of girl she might be.
  Probably she was one of these here New Women. He had a persuasion the cult
  had been maligned. Anyhow she was a Lady. And rich people, too! Her machine
  couldn't have cost much under twenty pounds. His mind came round and dwelt
  some time on her visible self. Rational dress didn't look a bit unwomanly.
  However, he disdained to be one of your fortunehunters. Then his thoughts
  drove off at a tangent. He would certainly have to get something to eat at
  the next public house.</p><hr><br>

  <h3>§ VI</h3>

  <p class="first">In the fulness of time, Mr. Hoopdriver drew near the Marquis
  of Granby at Esher, and as he came under the railway arch and saw the inn in
  front of him, he mounted his machine again and rode bravely up to the
  doorway. Burton and biscuit and cheese he had, which, indeed, is Burton in
  its proper company; and as he was eating there came a middle-aged man in a
  drab cycling suit, very red and moist and angry in the face, and asked
  bitterly for a lemon squash. And he sat down upon the seat in the bar and
  mopped his face. But scarcely had he sat down before he got up again and
  stared out of the doorway.</p>

    <p><a id="pic7"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>

  </div>

  <p class="caption">He sat down... and mopped his face.</p><br>

  <p>"Damn!" said he. Then, "Damned Fool!"</p>

  <p>"Eigh?" said Mr. Hoopdriver, looking round suddenly with a piece of cheese
  in his cheek.</p>

  <p>The man in drab faced him. "I called myself a Damned Fool, sir. Have you
  any objections?"</p>

  <p>"Oh!&mdash;None. None," said Mr. Hoopdriver. "I thought you spoke to me. I
  didn't hear what you said."</p>

  <p>"To have a contemplative disposition and an energetic temperament, sir, is
  hell. Hell, I tell you. A contemplative disposition and a phlegmatic
  temperament, all very well. But energy and philosophy&mdash;!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoopdriver looked as intelligent as he could, but said nothing.</p>

  <p>"There's no hurry, sir, none whatever. I came out for exercise, gentle
  exercise, and to notice the scenery and to botanise. And no sooner do I get
  on the accursed machine, than off I go hammer and tongs; I never look to
  right or left, never notice a flower, never see a view, get hot, juicy,
  red,&mdash;like a grilled chop. Here I am, sir. Come from Guildford in
  something under the hour. <i>Why</i>, sir?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoopdriver shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Because I'm a damned fool, sir. Because I've reservoirs and reservoirs of
  muscular energy, and one or other of them is always leaking. It's a most
  interesting road, birds and trees, I've no doubt, and wayside flowers, and
  there's nothing I should enjoy more than watching them. But I can't. Get me
  on that machine, and I have to go. Get me on anything, and I have to go. And
  I don't want to go a bit. <i>Why</i> should a man rush about like a rocket,
  all pace and fizzle? Why? It makes me furious. I can assure you, sir, I go
  scorching along the road, and cursing aloud at myself for doing it. A quiet,
  dignified, philosophical man, that's what I am&mdash;at bottom; and here I am
  dancing with rage and swearing like a drunken tinker at a perfect
  stranger&mdash;</p>

  <p>"But my day's wasted. I've lost all that country road, and now I'm on the
  fringe of London. And I might have loitered all the morning! Ugh! Thank
  Heaven, sir, you have not the irritable temperament, that you are not goaded
  to madness by your endogenous sneers, by the eternal wrangling of an
  uncomfortable soul and body. I tell you, I lead a cat and dog life&mdash;But
  what IS the use of talking?&mdash;It's all of a piece!"</p>

  <p>He tossed his head with unspeakable self-disgust, pitched the lemon squash
  into his mouth, paid for it, and without any further remark strode to the
  door. Mr. Hoopdriver was still wondering what to say when his interlocutor
  vanished. There was a noise of a foot spurning the gravel, and when Mr.
  Hoopdriver reached the doorway, the man in drab was a score of yards
  Londonward. He had already gathered pace. He pedalled with ill-suppressed
  anger, and his head was going down. In another moment he flew swiftly out of
  sight under the railway arch, and Mr. Hoopdriver saw him no more.</p><br>

  <h3>§ VII</h3>

  <p class="first">After this whirlwind Mr. Hoopdriver paid his reckoning
  and&mdash;being now a little rested about the muscles of the
  knees&mdash;resumed his saddle and rode on in the direction of Ripley, along
  an excellent but undulating road. He was pleased to find his command over his
  machine already sensibly increased. He set himself little exercises as he
  went along and performed them with variable success. There was, for instance,
  steering in between a couple of stones, say a foot apart, a deed of little
  difficulty as far as the front wheel is concerned. But the back wheel, not
  being under the sway of the human eye, is apt to take a vicious jump over the
  obstacle, which sends a violent concussion all along the spine to the skull,
  and will even jerk a loosely fastened hat over the eyes, and so lead to much
  confusion. And again, there was taking the hand or hands off the handlebar, a
  thing simple in itself, but complex in its consequences. This particularly
  was a feat Mr. Hoopdriver desired to do, for several divergent reasons; but
  at present it simply led to convulsive balancings and novel and inelegant
  modes of dismounting.</p>

  <p>The human nose is, at its best, a needless excrescence. There are those
  who consider it ornamental, and would regard a face deprived of its
  assistance with pity or derision; but it is doubtful whether our esteem is
  dictated so much by a sense of its absolute beauty as by the vitiating effect
  of a universally prevalent fashion. In the case of bicycle students, as in
  the young of both sexes, its inutility is aggravated by its persistent
  annoyance&mdash;it requires constant attention. Until one can ride with one
  hand, and search for, secure, and use a pocket handkerchief with the other,
  cycling is necessarily a constant series of descents. Nothing can be further
  from the author's ambition than a wanton realism, but Mr. Hoopdriver's nose
  is a plain and salient fact, and face it we must. And, in addition to this
  inconvenience, there are flies. Until the cyclist can steer with one hand,
  his face is given over to Beelzebub. Contemplative flies stroll over it, and
  trifle absently with its most sensitive surfaces. The only way to dislodge
  them is to shake the head forcibly and to writhe one's features violently.
  This is not only a lengthy and frequently ineffectual method, but one
  exceedingly terrifying to foot passengers. And again, sometimes the beginner
  rides for a space with one eye closed by perspiration, giving him a waggish
  air foreign to his mood and ill calculated to overawe the impertinent.
  However, you will appreciate now the motive of Mr. Hoopdriver's experiments.
  He presently attained sufficient dexterity to slap himself smartly and
  violently in the face with his right hand, without certainly overturning the
  machine; but his pocket handkerchief might have been in California for any
  good it was to him while he was in the saddle.</p>

  <p>Yet you must not think that because Mr. Hoopdriver was a little
  uncomfortable, he was unhappy in the slightest degree. In the background of
  his consciousness was the sense that about this time Briggs would be half-way
  through his window dressing, and Gosling, the apprentice, busy, with a chair
  turned down over the counter and his ears very red, trying to roll a piece of
  huckaback&mdash;only those who have rolled pieces of huckaback know quite how
  detestable huckaback is to roll&mdash;and the shop would be dusty and,
  perhaps, the governor about and snappy. And here was quiet and greenery, and
  one mucked about as the desire took one, without a soul to see, and here was
  no wailing of "Sayn," no folding of remnants, no voice to shout, "Hoopdriver,
  forward!" And once he almost ran over something wonderful, a little, low, red
  beast with a yellowish tail, that went rushing across the road before him. It
  was the first weasel he had ever seen in his cockney life. There were miles
  of this, scores of miles of this before him, pinewood and oak forest, purple,
  heathery moorland and grassy down, lush meadows, where shining rivers wound
  their lazy way, villages with square-towered, flint churches, and rambling,
  cheap, and hearty inns, clean, white, country towns, long downhill stretches,
  where one might ride at one's ease (overlooking a jolt or so), and far away,
  at the end of it all,&mdash;the sea.</p>

  <p>What mattered a fly or so in the dawn of these delights? Perhaps he had
  been dashed a minute by the shameful episode of the Young Lady in Grey, and
  perhaps the memory of it was making itself a little lair in a corner of his
  brain from which it could distress him in the retrospect by suggesting that
  he looked like a fool; but for the present that trouble was altogether in
  abeyance. The man in drab&mdash;evidently a swell&mdash;had spoken to him as
  his equal, and the knees of his brown suit and the chequered stockings were
  ever before his eyes. (Or, rather, you could see the stockings by carrying
  the head a little to one side.) And to feel, little by little, his mastery
  over this delightful, treacherous machine, growing and growing! Every
  half-mile or so his knees reasserted themselves, and he dismounted and sat
  awhile by the roadside.</p>

  <p>It was at a charming little place between Esher and Cobham, where a bridge
  crosses a stream, that Mr. Hoopdriver came across the other cyclist in brown.
  It is well to notice the fact here, although the interview was of the
  slightest, because it happened that subsequently Hoopdriver saw a great deal
  more of this other man in brown. The other cyclist in brown had a machine of
  dazzling newness, and a punctured pneumatic lay across his knees. He was a
  man of thirty or more, with a whitish face, an aquiline nose, a lank, flaxen
  moustache, and very fair hair, and he scowled at the job before him. At the
  sight of him Mr. Hoopdriver pulled himself together, and rode by with the air
  of one born to the wheel. "A splendid morning," said Mr. Hoopdriver, "and a
  fine surface."</p>

    <p><a id="pic8"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>
  <br>

  </div>

  <p class="caption">Mr. Hoopdriver came across the other cyclist in
  brown.</p><br>

  <p>"The morning and you and the surface be everlastingly damned!" said the
  other man in brown as Hoopdriver receded. Hoopdriver heard the mumble and did
  not distinguish the words, and he felt a pleasing sense of having duly
  asserted the wide sympathy that binds all cyclists together, of having
  behaved himself as becomes one of the brotherhood of the wheel. The other man
  in brown watched his receding aspect. "Greasy proletarian," said the other
  man in brown, feeling a prophetic dislike. "Got a suit of brown, the very
  picture of this. One would think his sole aim in life had been to caricature
  me. It's Fortune's way with me. Look at his insteps on the treadles! Why does
  Heaven make such men?"</p>

  <p>And having lit a cigarette, the other man in brown returned to the
  business in hand.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoopdriver worked up the hill towards Cobham to a point that he felt
  sure was out of sight of the other man in brown, and then he dismounted and
  pushed his machine; until the proximity of the village and a proper pride
  drove him into the saddle again.</p><br>

  <h3>§ VIII</h3>

  <p class="first">Beyond Cobham came a delightful incident, delightful, that
  is, in its beginning if a trifle indeterminate in the retrospect. It was
  perhaps half-way between Cobham and Ripley. Mr. Hoopdriver dropped down a
  little hill, where, unfenced from the road, fine mossy trees and bracken lay
  on either side; and looking up he saw an open country before him, covered
  with heather and set with pines, and a yellow road runing across it, and half
  a mile away perhaps, a little grey figure by the wayside waving something
  white. "Never!" said Mr. Hoopdriver with his hands tightening on the
  handles.</p>

    <p><a id="pic9"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>
  <br>

  <div align="center">

         alt="A little grey figure by the wayside waving something white">
  </div>

  <p class="caption">A little grey figure by the wayside waving something
  white.</p><br>

  <p>He resumed the treadles, staring away before him, jolted over a stone,
  wabbled, recovered, and began riding faster at once, with his eyes ahead. "It
  can't be," said Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>He rode his straightest, and kept his pedals spinning, albeit a limp
  numbness had resumed possession of his legs." It <i>can't</i> be," he
  repeated, feeling every moment more assured that it WAS. "Lord! I don't know
  even now," said Mr. Hoopdriver (legs awhirling), and then, "Blow my
  legs!"</p>

  <p>But he kept on and drew nearer and nearer, breathing hard and gathering
  flies like a flypaper. In the valley he was hidden. Then the road began to
  rise, and the resistance of the pedals grew. As he crested the hill he saw
  her, not a hundred yards away from him. "It's her!" he said. "It's
  her&mdash;right enough. It's the suit's done it,"&mdash;which was truer even
  than Mr. Hoopdriver thought. But now she was not waving her handkerchief, she
  was not even looking at him. She was wheeling her machine slowly along the
  road towards him, and admiring the pretty wooded hills towards Weybridge. She
  might have been unaware of his existence for all the recognition he got.</p>

  <p>For a moment horrible doubts troubled Mr. Hoopdriver. Had that
  handkerchief been a dream? Besides which he was deliquescent and scarlet, and
  felt so. It must be her coquetry&mdash;the handkerchief was indisputable.
  Should he ride up to her and get off, or get off and ride up to her? It was
  as well she didn't look, because he would certainly capsize if he lifted his
  cap. Perhaps that was her consideration. Even as he hesitated he was upon
  her. She must have heard his breathing. He gripped the brake. Steady! His
  right leg waved in the air, and he came down heavily and staggering, but
  erect. She turned her eyes upon him with admirable surprise.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoopdriver tried to smile pleasantly, hold up his machine, raise his
  cap, and bow gracefully. Indeed, he felt that he did as much. He was a man
  singularly devoid of the minutiae of self-consciousness, and he was quite
  unaware of a tail of damp hair lying across his forehead, and just clearing
  his eyes, and of the general disorder of his coiffure. There was an
  interrogative pause.</p>

  <p>"What can I have the pleasure&mdash;" began Mr. Haopdriver, insinuatingly.
  "I mean" (remembering his emancipation and abruptly assuming his most
  aristocratic intonation), "can I be of any assistance to you?"</p>

  <p>The Young Lady in Grey bit her lower lip and said very prettily, "None,
  thank you." She glanced away from him and made as if she would proceed.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said Mr. Hoopdriver, taken aback and suddenly crestfallen again. It
  was so unexpected. He tried to grasp the situation. Was she coquetting? Or
  had he&mdash;?</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, one minute," he said, as she began to wheel her machine
  again.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" she said, stopping and staring a little, with the colour in her
  cheeks deepening.</p>

  <p>"I should not have alighted if I had not&mdash;imagined that you
  &mdash;er, waved something white&mdash;" He paused.</p>

  <p>She looked at him doubtfully. He <i>had</i> seen it! She decided that he
  was not an unredeemed rough taking advantage of a mistake, but an innocent
  soul meaning well while seeking happiness. "I <i>did</i> wave my
  handkerchief," she said. "I'm very sorry. I am expecting&mdash;a friend, a
  gentleman,"&mdash;she seemed to flush pink for a minute. "He is riding a
  bicycle and dressed in&mdash;in brown; and at a distance, you
  know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, quite!" said Mr. Hoopdriver, bearing up in manly fashion against his
  bitter disappointment. "Certainly."</p>

  <p>"I'm awfully sorry, you know. Troubling you to dismount, and all
  that."</p>

  <p>"No trouble. 'Ssure you," said Mr. Hoopdriver, mechanically and bowing
  over his saddle as if it was a counter. Somehow he could not find it in his
  heart to tell her that the man was beyond there with a punctured pneumatic.
  He looked back along the road and tried to think of something else to say.
  But the gulf in the conversation widened rapidly and hopelessly. "There's
  nothing further," began Mr. Hoopdriver desperately, recurring to his stock of
  <i>clichés</i>.</p>

    <p><a id="pic10"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>
  <br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1303441h-images/WOC10.jpg"
         alt="No trouble. 'Ssure you.">
  </div>

  <p class="caption">"No trouble. 'Ssure you."</p><br>

  <p>"Nothing, thank you," she said decisively. And immediately, "This
  <i>is</i> the Ripley road?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said Mr. Hoopdriver. "Ripley is about two miles from here.
  According to the mile-stones."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," she said warmly. "Thank you so much. I felt sure there was no
  mistake. And I really am awfully sorry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't mention it," said Mr. Hoopdriver. "Don't mention it." He hesitated
  and gripped his handles to mount. "It's me," he said, "ought to be sorry."
  Should he say it? Was it an impertinence? Anyhow!&mdash;"Not being the other
  gentleman, you know."</p>

  <p>He tried a quietly insinuating smile that he knew for a grin even as he
  smiled it; felt she disapproved&mdash;that she despised him, was overcome
  with shame at her expression, turned his back upon her, and began (very
  clumsily) to mount. He did so with a horrible swerve, and went pedalling off,
  riding very badly, as he was only too painfully aware. Nevertheless, thank
  Heaven for the mounting! He could not see her because it was so dangerous for
  him to look round, but he could imagine her indignant and pitiless. He felt
  an unspeakable idiot. One had to be so careful what one said to Young Ladies,
  and he'd gone and treated her just as though she was only a Larky Girl. It
  was unforgivable. He always WAS a fool. You could tell from her manner she
  didn't think him a gentleman. One glance, and she seemed to look clear
  through him and all his presence. What rot it was venturing to speak to a
  girl like that! With her education she was bound to see through him at
  once.</p>

  <p>How nicely she spoke too! nice clear-cut words! She made him feel what
  slush his own accent was. And that last silly remark. What was it? 'Not being
  the other gentleman, you know!' No point in it. And <i>'gentleman!'</i> What
  <i>could</i> she be thinking of him?</p>

  <p>But really the Young Lady in Grey had dismissed Hoopdriver from her
  thoughts almost before he had vanished round the corner. She had thought no
  ill of him. His manifest awe and admiration of her had given her not an atom
  of offence. But for her just now there were weightier things to think about,
  things that would affect all the rest of her life. She continued slowly
  walking her machine Londonward. Presently she stopped. "Oh! Why
  <i>doesn't</i> he come?" she said, and stamped her foot petulantly. Then, as
  if in answer, coming down the hill among the trees, appeared the other man in
  brown, dismounted and wheeling his machine.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="chap05"
     name="chap05">V. &mdash; HOW MR. HOOPDRIVER WAS HAUNTED</a></h2>

  <h3>§ IX</h3>

  <p class="first">As Mr. Hoopdriver rode swaggering along the Ripley road, it
  came to him, with an unwarrantable sense of comfort, that he had seen the
  last of the Young Lady in Grey. But the ill-concealed bladery of the machine,
  the present machinery of Fate, the <i>deus ex machina</i>, so to speak, was
  against him. The bicycle, torn from this attractive young woman, grew heavier
  and heavier, and continually more unsteady. It seemed a choice between
  stopping at Ripley or dying in the flower of his days. He went into the
  Unicorn, after propping his machine outside the door, and, as he cooled down
  and smoked his Red Herring cigarette while the cold meat was getting ready,
  he saw from the window the Young Lady in Grey and the other man in brown,
  entering Ripley.</p>

  <p>They filled him with apprehension by looking at the house which sheltered
  him, but the sight of his bicycle, propped in a drunk and incapable attitude
  against the doorway, humping its rackety mud-guard and leering at them with
  its darkened lantern eye, drove them away&mdash;so it seemed to Mr.
  Hoopdriver&mdash;to the spacious swallow of the Golden Dragon. The young lady
  was riding very slowly, but the other man in brown had a bad puncture and was
  wheeling his machine. Mr. Hoopdriver noted his flaxen moustache, his aquiline
  nose, his rather bent shoulders, with a sudden, vivid dislike.</p>

  <p>The maid at the Unicorn is naturally a pleasant girl, but she is jaded by
  the incessant incidence of cyclists, and Hoopdriver's mind, even as he
  conversed with her in that cultivated voice of his&mdash;of the weather, of
  the distance from London, and of the excellence of the Ripley
  road&mdash;wandered to the incomparable freshness and brilliance of the Young
  Lady in Grey. As he sat at meat he kept turning his head to the window to see
  what signs there were of that person, but the face of the Golden Dragon
  displayed no appreciation of the delightful morsel it had swallowed. As an
  incidental consequence of this distraction, Mr. Hoopdriver was for a minute
  greatly inconvenienced by a mouthful of mustard. After he had called for his
  reckoning he went, his courage being high with meat and mustard, to the door,
  intending to stand, with his legs wide apart and his hands deep in his
  pockets, and stare boldly across the road. But just then the other man in
  brown appeared in the gateway of the Golden Dragon yard&mdash;it is one of
  those delightful inns that date from the coaching days&mdash;wheeling his
  punctured machine. He was taking it to Flambeau's, the repairer's. He looked
  up and saw Hoopdriver, stared for a minute, and then scowled darkly.</p>

  <p>But Hoopdriver remained stoutly in the doorway until the other man in
  brown had disappeared into Flambeau's. Then he glanced momentarily at the
  Golden Dragon, puckered his mouth into a whistle of unconcern, and proceeded
  to wheel his machine into the road until a sufficient margin for mounting was
  secured.</p>

    <p><a id="pic11"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>

         alt="The Golden Dragon">
  </div>

  <p class="caption">The Golden Dragon.</p><br>

  <p>Now, at that time, I say, Hoopdriver was rather desirous than not of
  seeing no more of the Young Lady in Grey. The other man in brown he guessed
  was her brother, albeit that person was of a pallid fairness, differing
  essentially from her rich colouring; and, besides, he felt he had made a
  hopeless fool of himself. But the afternoon was against him, intolerably hot,
  especially on the top of his head, and the virtue had gone out of his legs to
  digest his cold meat, and altogether his ride to Guildford was exceedingly
  intermittent. At times he would walk, at times lounge by the wayside, and
  every public house, in spite of Briggs and a sentiment of economy, meant a
  lemonade and a dash of bitter. (For that is the experience of all those who
  go on wheels, that drinking begets thirst, even more than thirst begets
  drinking, until at last the man who yields becomes a hell unto himself, a
  hell in which the fire dieth not, and the thirst is not quenched.) Until a
  pennyworth of acrid green apples turned the current that threatened to carry
  him away. Ever and again a cycle, or a party of cyclists, would go by, with
  glittering wheels and softly running chains, and on each occasion, to save
  his self-respect, Mr. Hoopdriver descended and feigned some trouble with his
  saddle. Each time he descended with less trepidation.</p>

  <p>He did not reach Guildford until nearly four o'clock, and then he was so
  much exhausted that he decided to put up there for the night, at the Yellow
  Hammer Coffee Tavern. And after he had cooled a space and refreshed himself
  with tea and bread and butter and jam,&mdash;the tea he drank noisily out of
  the saucer,&mdash;he went out to loiter away the rest of the afternoon.
  Guildford is an altogether charming old town, famous, so he learnt from a
  Guide Book, as the scene of Master Tupper's great historical novel of Stephen
  Langton, and it has a delightful castle, all set about with geraniums and
  brass plates commemorating the gentlemen who put them up, and its Guildhall
  is a Tudor building, very pleasant to see, and in the afternoon the shops are
  busy and the people going to and fro make the pavements look bright and
  prosperous. It was nice to peep in the windows and see the heads of the men
  and girls in the drapers' shops, busy as busy, serving away. The High Street
  runs down at an angle of seventy degrees to the horizon (so it seemed to Mr.
  Hoopdriver, whose feeling for gradients was unnaturally exalted), and it
  brought his heart into his mouth to see a cyclist ride down it, like a fly
  crawling down a window pane. The man hadn't even a brake. He visited the
  castle early in the evening and paid his twopence to ascend the Keep.</p>

  <p class="caption">Guildford is an altogether charming old town.</p><br>

  <p>At the top, from the cage, he looked down over the clustering red roofs of
  the town and the tower of the church, and then going to the southern side sat
  down and lit a Red Herring cigarette, and stared away south over the old
  bramble-bearing, fern-beset ruin, at the waves of blue upland that rose, one
  behind another, across the Weald, to the lazy altitudes of Hindhead and
  Butser. His pale grey eyes were full of complacency and pleasurable
  anticipation. Tomorrow he would go riding across that wide valley.</p>

  <p>He did not notice any one else had come up the Keep after him until he
  heard a soft voice behind him saying: "Well, <i>Miss Beaumont</i>, here's the
  view." Something in the accent pointed to a jest in the name.</p>

  <p>"It's a dear old town, brother George," answered another voice that
  sounded familiar enough, and turning his head, Mr. Hoopdriver saw the other
  man in brown and the Young Lady in Grey, with their backs towards him. She
  turned her smiling profile towards Hoopdriver. "Only, you know, brothers
  don't call their sisters&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She glanced over her shoulder and saw Hoopdriver. "Damn!" said the other
  man in brown, quite audibly, starting as he followed her glance.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoopdriver, with a fine air of indifference, resumed the Weald.
  "Beautiful old town, isn't it?" said the other man in brown, after a quite
  perceptible pause.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it?" said the Young Lady in Grey.</p>

  <p>Another pause began.</p>

  <p>"Can't get alone anywhere," said the other man in brown, looking
  round.</p>

  <p>Then Mr. Hoopdriver perceived clearly that he was in the way, and decided
  to retreat. It was just his luck of course that he should stumble at the head
  of the steps and vanish with indignity. This was the third time that he'd
  seen <i>him</i>, and the fourth time her. And of course he was too big a fat-
  head to raise his cap to <i>her</i>! He thought of that at the foot of the
  Keep. Apparently they aimed at the South Coast just as he did, He'd get up
  betimes the next day and hurry off to avoid her&mdash;them, that is. It never
  occurred to Mr. Hoopdriver that Miss Beaumont and her brother might do
  exactly the same thing, and that evening, at least, the peculiarity of a
  brother calling his sister "Miss Beaumont" did not recur to him. He was much
  too preoccupied with an analysis of his own share of these encounters. He
  found it hard to be altogether satisfied about the figure he had cut, revise
  his memories as he would.</p>

  <p>Once more quite unintentionally he stumbled upon these two people. It was
  about seven o'clock. He stopped outside a linen draper's and peered over the
  goods in the window at the assistants in torment. He could have spent a whole
  day happily at that. He told himself that he was trying to see how they
  dressed out the brass lines over their counters, in a purely professional
  spirit, but down at the very bottom of his heart he knew better. The
  customers were a secondary consideration, and it was only after the lapse of
  perhaps a minute that he perceived that among them was&mdash;the Young Lady
  in Grey! He turned away from the window at once, and saw the other man in
  brown standing at the edge of the pavement and regarding him with a very
  curious expression of face.</p>

  <p>There came into Mr. Hoopdriver's head the curious problem whether he was
  to be regarded as a nuisance haunting these people, or whether they were to
  be regarded as a nuisance haunting him. He abandoned the solution at last in
  despair, quite unable to decide upon the course he should take at the next
  encounter, whether he should scowl savagely at the couple or assume an
  attitude eloquent of apology and propitiation.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="chap06"
     name="chap06">VI. &mdash; THE IMAGININGS OF MR. HOOPDRIVER'S
     HEART</a></h2>

  <h3>§ X</h3>

  <p class="first">Mr. Hoopdriver was (in the days of this story) a poet,
  though he had never written a line of verse. Or perhaps romancer will
  describe him better. Like I know not how many of those who do the fetching
  and carrying of life,&mdash;a great number of them certainly,&mdash;his real
  life was absolutely uninteresting, and if he had faced it as realistically as
  such people do in Mr. Gissing's novels, he would probably have come by way of
  drink to suicide in the course of a year. But that was just what he had the
  natural wisdom not to do. On the contrary, he was always decorating his
  existence with imaginative tags, hopes, and poses, deliberate and yet quite
  effectual self-deceptions; his experiences were mere material for a romantic
  superstructure. If some power had given Hoopdriver the 'giftie' Burns
  invoked, 'to see oursels as ithers see us,' he would probably have given it
  away to some one else at the very earliest opportunity. His entire life, you
  must understand, was not a continuous romance, but a series of short stories
  linked only by the general resemblance of their hero, a brown-haired young
  fellow commonly, with blue eyes and a fair moustache, graceful rather than
  strong, sharp and resolute rather than clever (cp., as the scientific books
  say, p. 2). Invariably this person possessed an iron will. The stories
  fluctuated indefinitely. The smoking of a cigarette converted Hoopdriver's
  hero into something entirely worldly, subtly rakish, with a humorous twinkle
  in the eye and some gallant sinning in the background. You should have seen
  Mr. Hoopdriver promenading the brilliant gardens at Earl's Court on an
  early-closing night. His meaning glances! (I dare not give the meaning.) Such
  an influence as the eloquence of a revivalist preacher would suffice to
  divert the story into absolutely different channels, make him a white-soured
  hero, a man still pure, walking untainted and brave and helpful through miry
  ways. The appearance of some daintily gloved frockcoated gentleman with
  buttonhole and eyeglass complete, gallantly attendant in the rear of
  customers, served again to start visions of a simplicity essentially
  Cromwell-like, of sturdy plainness, of a strong, silent man going righteously
  through the world. This day there had predominated a fine leisurely person
  immaculately clothed, and riding on an unexceptional machine, a mysterious
  person&mdash;quite unostentatious, but with accidental self-revelation of
  something over the common, even a "bloomin' Dook," it might be incognito, on
  the tour of the South Coast.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="caption">Promenading the brilliant gardens at Earl's Court.</p><br>

  <p>You must not think that there was any telling of these stories of this
  life-long series by Mr. Hoopdriver. He never dreamt that they were known to a
  soul. If it were not for the trouble, I would, I think, go back and rewrite
  this section from the beginning, expunging the statements that Hoopdriver was
  a poet and a romancer, and saying instead that he was a playwright and acted
  his own plays. He was not only the sole performer, but the entire audience,
  and the entertainment kept him almost continuously happy. Yet even that
  playwright comparison scarcely expresses all the facts of the case. After
  all, very many of his dreams never got acted at all, possibly indeed, most of
  them, the dreams of a solitary walk for instance, or of a tramcar ride, the
  dreams dreamt behind the counter while trade was slack and mechanical
  foldings and rollings occupied his muscles. Most of them were little dramatic
  situations, crucial dialogues, the return of Mr. Hoopdriver to his native
  village, for instance, in a well-cut holiday suit and natty gloves, the
  unheard asides of the rival neighbours, the delight of the old 'mater,' the
  intelligence&mdash;"A ten-pound rise all at once from Antrobus, mater. Whad
  d'yer think of that?" or again, the first whispering of love, dainty and
  witty and tender, to the girl he served a few days ago with sateen, or a
  gallant rescue of generalised beauty in distress from truculent insult or
  ravening dog.</p>

  <p>So many people do this&mdash;and you never suspect it. You see a tattered
  lad selling matches in the street, and you think there is nothing between him
  and the bleakness of immensity, between him and utter abasement, but a few
  tattered rags and a feeble musculature. And all unseen by you a host of
  heaven-sent fatuities swathes him about, even, maybe, as they swathe you
  about. Many men have never seen their own profiles or the backs of their
  heads, and for the back of your own mind no mirror has been invented. They
  swathe him about so thickly that the pricks of fate scarce penetrate to him,
  or become but a pleasant titillation. And so, indeed, it is with all of us
  who go on living. Self-deception is the anaesthetic of life, while God is
  carving out our beings.</p>

  <p>But to return from this general vivisection to Mr. Hoopdriver's
  imaginings. You see now how external our view has been; we have had but the
  slightest transitory glimpses of the drama within, of how the things looked
  in the magic mirror of Mr. Hoopdriver's mind. On the road to Guildford and
  during his encounters with his haunting fellow-cyclists the drama had
  presented chiefly the quiet gentleman to whom we have alluded, but at
  Guildford, under more varied stimuli, he burgeoned out more variously. There
  was the house agent's window, for instance, set him upon a charming little
  comedy. He would go in, make inquires about that thirty-pound house, get the
  key possibly and go over it&mdash;the thing would stimulate the clerk's
  curiosity immensely. He searched his mind for a reason for this proceeding
  and discovered that he was a dynamiter needing privacy. Upon that theory he
  procured the key, explored the house carefully, said darkly that it might
  suit his special needs, but that there were <i>others</i> to consult. The
  clerk, however, did not understand the allusion, and merely pitied him as one
  who had married young and paired himself to a stronger mind than his own.</p>

  <p>This proceeding in some occult way led to the purchase of a note-book and
  pencil, and that started the conception of an artist taking notes. That was a
  little game Mr. Hoopdriver had, in congenial company, played in his still
  younger days&mdash;to the infinite annoyance of quite a number of respectable
  excursionists at Hastings. In early days Mr. Hoopdriver had been, as his
  mother proudly boasted, a 'bit of a drawer,' but a conscientious and normally
  stupid schoolmaster perceived the incipient talent and had nipped it in the
  bud by a series of lessons in art. However, our principal character figured
  about quite happily in old corners of Guildford, and once the other man in
  brown, looking out of the bay window of the Earl of Kent, saw him standing in
  a corner by a gateway, note-book in hand, busily sketching the Earl's
  imposing features. At which sight the other man in brown started back from
  the centre of the window, so as to be hidden from him, and crouching
  slightly, watched him intently through the interstices of the lace
  curtains.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="chap07"
     name="chap07">VII. &mdash; OMISSIONS</a></h2>

  <h3>§ XI</h3>

  <p class="first">Now the rest of the acts of Mr. Hoopdriver in Guildford, on
  the great opening day of his holidays, are not to be detailed here. How he
  wandered about the old town in the dusk, and up to the Hogsback to see the
  little lamps below and the little stars above come out one after another; how
  he returned through the yellow-lit streets to the Yellow Hammer Coffee Tavern
  and supped bravely in the commercial room&mdash;a Man among Men; how he
  joined in the talk about flying-machines and the possibilities of
  electricity, witnessing that fiying-machines were "dead certain to come," and
  that electricity was "wonderful, wonderful"; how he went and watched the
  billiard playing and said, "Left 'em" several times with an oracular air; how
  he fell a-yawning; and how he got out his cycling map and studied it
  intently,&mdash;are things that find no mention here. Nor will I enlarge upon
  his going into the writing-room, and marking the road from London to
  Guildford with a fine, bright line of the reddest of red ink. In his little
  cyclist hand-book there is a diary, and in the diary there is an entry of
  these things&mdash;it is there to this day, and I cannot do better than
  reproduce it here to witness that this book is indeed a true one, and no
  lying fable written to while away an hour.</p>

  <p>At last he fell a-yawning so much that very reluctantly indeed he set
  about finishing this great and splendid day. (Alas! that all days must end at
  last! ) He got his candle in the hall from a friendly waiting-maid, and
  passed upward&mdash;whither a modest novelist, who writes for the family
  circle, dare not follow. Yet I may tell you that he knelt down at his
  bedside, happy and drowsy, and said, "Our Father 'chartin' heaven," even as
  he had learnt it by rote from his mother nearly twenty years ago. And anon
  when his breathing had become deep and regular, we may creep into his bedroom
  and catch him at his dreams. He is lying upon his left side, with his arm
  under the pillow. It is dark, and he is hidden; but if you could have seen
  his face, sleeping there in the darkness, I think you would have perceived,
  in spite of that treasured, thin, and straggling moustache, in spite of your
  memory of the coarse words he had used that day, that the man before you was,
  after all, only a little child asleep.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="chap08"
     name="chap08">VIII. &mdash; THE DREAMS OF MR. HOOPDRIVER</a></h2>

  <h3>§ XII</h3>

  <p class="first">In spite of the drawn blinds and the darkness, you have just
  seen Mr. Hoopdriver's face peaceful in its beauty sleep in the little, plain
  bedroom at the very top of the Yellow Hammer Coffee Tavern at Guildford. That
  was before midnight. As the night progressed he was disturbed by dreams.</p>

  <p>After your first day of cycling one dream is inevitable. A memory of
  motion lingers in the muscles of your legs, and round and round they seem to
  go. You ride through Dreamland on wonderful dream bicycles that change and
  grow; you ride down steeples and staircases and over precipices; you hover in
  horrible suspense over inhabited towns, vainly seeking for a brake your hand
  cannot find, to save you from a headlong fall; you plunge into weltering
  rivers, and rush helplessly at monstrous obstacles. Anon Mr. Hoopdriver found
  himself riding out of the darkness of non-existence, pedalling Ezekiel's
  Wheels across the Weald of Surrey, jolting over the hills and smashing
  villages in his course, while the other man in brown cursed and swore at him
  and shouted to stop his career. There was the Putney heath-keeper, too, and
  the man in drab raging at him. He felt an awful fool, a&mdash;what was
  it?&mdash;a juggins, ah!&mdash;a Juggernaut. The villages went off one after
  another with a soft, squashing noise. He did not see the Young Lady in Grey,
  but he knew she was looking at his back. He dared not look round. Where the
  devil was the brake? It must have fallen off. And the bell? Right in front of
  him was Guildford. He tried to shout and warn the town to get out of the way,
  but his voice was gone as well. Nearer, nearer! it was fearful! and in
  another moment the houses were cracking like nuts and the blood of the
  inhabitants squirting this way and that. The streets were black with people
  running. Right under his wheels he saw the Young Lady in Grey. A feeling of
  horror came upon Mr. Hoopdriver; he flung himself sideways to descend,
  forgetting how high he was, and forthwith he began falling; falling,
  falling.</p>

  <p>He woke up, turned over, saw the new moon on the window, wondered a
  little, and went to sleep again.</p>

  <p>This second dream went back into the first somehow, and the other man in
  brown came threatening and shouting towards him. He grew uglier and uglier as
  he approached, and his expression was intolerably evil. He came and looked
  close into Mr. Hoopdriver's eyes and then receded to an incredible distance.
  His face seemed to be luminous. <i>"Miss Beaumont,"</i> he said, and splashed
  up a spray of suspicion. Some one began letting off fireworks, chiefly
  Catherine wheels, down the shop, though Mr. Hoopdriver knew it was against
  the rules. For it seemed that the place they were in was a vast shop, and
  then Mr. Hoopdriver perceived that the other man in brown was the
  shop-walker, differing from most shop-walkers in the fact that he was lit
  from within as a Chinese lantern might be. And the customer Mr. Hoopdriver
  was going to serve was the Young Lady in Grey. Curious he hadn't noticed it
  before. She was in grey as usual,&mdash;rationals,&mdash;and she had her
  bicycle leaning against the counter. She smiled quite frankly at him, just as
  she had done when she had apologised for stopping him. And her form, as she
  leant towards him, was full of a sinuous grace he had never noticed before.
  "What can I have the pleasure?" said Mr. Hoopdriver at once, and she said,
  "The Ripley road." So he got out the Ripley road and unrolled it and showed
  it to her, and she said that would do very nicely, and kept on looking at him
  and smiling, and he began measuring off eight miles by means of the yard
  measure on the counter, eight miles being a dress length, a rational dress
  length, that is; and then the other man in brown came up and wanted to
  interfere, and said Mr. Hoopdriver was a cad, besides measuring it off too
  slowly. And as Mr. Hoopdriver began to measure faster, the other man in brown
  said the Young Lady in Grey had been there long enough, and that he
  <i>was</i> her brother, or else she would not be travelling with him, and he
  suddenly whipped his arm about her waist and made off with her. It occurred
  to Mr. Hoopdriver even at the moment that this was scarcely brotherly
  behaviour. Of course it wasn't! The sight of the other man gripping her so
  familiarly enraged him frightfully; he leapt over the counter forthwith and
  gave chase. They ran round the shop and up an iron staircase into the Keep,
  and so out upon the Ripley road. For some time they kept dodging in and out
  of a wayside hotel with two front doors and an inn yard. The other man could
  not run very fast because he had hold of the Young Lady in Grey, but Mr.
  Hoopdriver was hampered by the absurd behaviour of his legs. They would not
  stretch out; they would keep going round and round as if they were on the
  treadles of a wheel, so that he made the smallest steps conceivable. This
  dream came to no crisis. The chase seemed to last an interminable time, and
  all kinds of people, heathkeepers, shopmen, policemen, the old man in the
  Keep, the angry man in drab, the barmaid at the Unicorn, men with
  flying-machines, people playing billiards in the doorways, silly, headless
  figures, stupid cocks and hens encumbered with parcels and umbrellas and
  waterproofs, people carrying bedroom candles, and such-like riffraff, kept
  getting in his way and annoying him, although he sounded his electric bell,
  and said, "Wonderful, wonderful!" at every corner...</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="chap09"
     name="chap09">IX. &mdash; HOW MR. HOOPDRIVER WENT TO HASLEMERE</a></h2>

  <h3>§ XIII</h3>

  <p class="first">There was some little delay in getting Mr. Hoopdriver's
  breakfast, so that after all he was not free to start out of Guildford until
  just upon the stroke of nine. He wheeled his machine from the High Street in
  some perplexity. He did not know whether this young lady, who had seized hold
  of his imagination so strongly, and her unfriendly and possibly menacing
  brother, were ahead of him or even now breakfasting somewhere in Guildford.
  In the former case he might loiter as he chose; in the latter he must hurry,
  and possibly take refuge in branch roads.</p>

  <p>It occurred to him as being in some obscure way strategic, that he would
  leave Guildford not by the obvious Portsmouth road, but by the road running
  through Shalford. Along this pleasant shady way he felt suffficiently secure
  to resume his exercises in riding with one hand off the handles, and in
  staring over his shoulder. He came over once or twice, but fell on his foot
  each time, and perceived that he was improving. Before he got to Bramley a
  specious byway snapped him up, ran with him for half a mile or more, and
  dropped him as a terrier drops a walkingstick, upon the Portsmouth again, a
  couple of miles from Godalming. He entered Godalming on his feet, for the
  road through that delightful town is beyond dispute the vilest in the world,
  a mere tumult of road metal, a way of peaks and precipices, and, after a
  successful experiment with cider at the Woolpack, he pushed on to
  Milford.</p>

  <p>All this time he was acutely aware of the existence of the Young Lady in
  Grey and her companion in brown, as a child in the dark is of Bogies.
  Sometimes he could hear their pneumatics stealing upon him from behind, and
  looking round saw a long stretch of vacant road. Once he saw far ahead of him
  a glittering wheel, but it proved to be a workingman riding to destruction on
  a very tall ordinary. And he felt a curious, vague uneasiness about that
  Young Lady in Grey, for which he was altogether unable to account. Now that
  he was awake he had forgotten that accentuated "Miss Beaumont that had been
  quite clear in his dream. But the curious dream conviction, that the girl was
  not really the man's sister, would not let itself be forgotten. Why, for
  instance, should a man want to be alone with his sister on the top of a
  tower? At Milford his bicycle made, so to speak, an ass of itself. A
  finger-post suddenly jumped out at him, vainly indicating an abrupt turn to
  the right, and Mr. Hoopdriver would have slowed up and read the inscription,
  but no!&mdash;the bicycle would not let him. The road dropped a little into
  Milford, and the thing shied, put down its head and bolted, and Mr.
  Hoopdriver only thought of the brake when the fingerpost was passed. Then to
  have recovered the point of intersection would have meant dismounting. For as
  yet there was no road wide enough for Mr. Hoopdriver to turn in. So he went
  on his way&mdash;or to be precise, he did exactly the opposite thing. The
  road to the right was the Portsmouth road, and this he was on went to
  Haslemere and Midhurst. By that error it came about that he once more came
  upon his fellow travellers of yesterday, coming on them suddenly, without the
  slightest preliminary announcement and when they least expected it, under the
  Southwestern Railway arch. "It's horrible," said a girlish voice; "it's
  brutal&mdash;cowardly&mdash;" And stopped.</p>

  <p>His expression, as he shot out from the archway at them, may have been
  something between a grin of recognition and a scowl of annoyance at himself
  for the unintentional intrusion. But disconcerted as he waas, he was yet able
  to appreciate something of the peculiarity of their mutual attitudes. The
  bicycles were Iying by the roadside, and the two riders stood face to face.
  The other man in brown's attitude, as it flashed upon Hoopdriver, was a
  deliberate pose; he twirled his moustache and smiled faintly, and he was
  conscientiously looking amused. And the girl stood rigid, her arms straight
  by her side, her handkerchief clenched in her hand, and her face was flushed,
  with the faintest touch of red upon her eyelids. She seemed to Mr.
  Hoopdriver's sense to be indignant. But that was the impression of a second.
  A mask of surprised recognition fell across this revelation of emotion as she
  turned her head towards him, and the pose of the other man in brown vanished
  too in a momentary astonishment. And then he had passed them, and was riding
  on towards Haslemere to make what he could of the swift picture that had
  photographed itself on his brain.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="caption">The other man in brown's attitude was a deliberate
  pose.</p><br>

  <p>"Rum," said Mr. Hoopdriver. "It's <i>dashed</i> rum!"</p>

  <p>"They were having a row."</p>

  <p>"Smirking&mdash;" What he called the other man in brown need not trouble
  us.</p>

  <p>"Annoying her!" That any human being should do that!</p>

  <p><i>"Why?"</i></p>

  <p>The impulse to interfere leapt suddenly into Mr. Hoopdriver's mind. He
  grasped his brake, descended, and stood looking hesitatingly back. They still
  stood by the railway bridge, and it seemed to Mr. Hoopdriver's fancy that she
  was stamping her foot. He hesitated, then turned his bicycle round, mounted,
  and rode back towards them, gripping his courage firmly lest it should slip
  away and leave him ridiculous. "I'll offer 'im a screw 'ammer," said Mr.
  Hoopdriver. Then, with a wave of fierce emotion, he saw that the girl was
  crying. In another moment they heard him and turned in surprise. Certainly
  she had been crying; her eyes were swimming in tears, and the other man in
  brown looked exceedingly disconcerted. Mr. Hoopdriver descended and stood
  over his machine.</p>

  <p>"Nothing wrong, I hope?" he said, looking the other man in brown squarely
  in the face. "No accident?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said the other man in brown shortly. "Nothing at all,
  thanks."</p>

  <p>"But," said Mr. Hoopdriver, with a great effort, "the young lady is
  crying. I thought perhaps&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Young Lady in Grey started, gave Hoopdriver one swift glance, and
  covered one eye with her handkerchief. "It's this speck," she said. "This
  speck of dust in my eye."</p>

  <p>"This lady," said the other man in brown, explaining, "has a gnat in her
  eye."</p>

  <p>There was a pause. The young lady busied herself with her eye. "I believe
  it's out," she said. The other man in brown made movements indicating
  commiserating curiosity concerning the alleged fly. Mr. Hoopdriver&mdash;the
  word is his own&mdash;stood flabber-gastered. He had all the intuition of the
  simple-minded. He knew there was no fly. But the ground was suddenly cut from
  his feet. There is a limit to knighterrantry&mdash;dragons and false knights
  are all very well, but flies! Fictitious flies! Whatever the trouble was, it
  was evidently not his affair. He felt he had made a fool of himself again. He
  would have mumbled some sort of apology; but the other man in brown gave him
  no time, turned on him abruptly, even fiercely. "I hope," he said, "that your
  curiosity is satisfied?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said Mr. Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>"Then we won't detain you."</p>

  <p>And, ignominiously, Mr. Hoopdriver turned his machine about, struggled
  upon it, and resumed the road southward. And when he learnt that he was not
  on the Portsmouth road, it was impossible to turn and go back, for that would
  be to face his shame again, and so he had to ride on by Brook Street up the
  hill to Haslemere. And away to the right the Portsmouth road mocked at him
  and made off to its fastnesses amid the sunlit green and purple masses of
  Hindhead, where Mr. Grant Allen writes his Hill Top Novels day by day.</p>

  <p>The sun shone, and the wide blue hill views and pleasant valleys one saw
  on either hand from the sandscarred roadway, even the sides of the road
  itself set about with grey heather scrub and prickly masses of gorse, and
  pine trees with their year's growth still bright green, against the darkened
  needles of the previous years, were fresh and delightful to Mr. Hoopdriver's
  eyes But the brightness of the day and the day-old sense of freedom fought an
  uphill fight against his intolerable vexation at that abominable encounter,
  and had still to win it when he reached Haslemere. A great brown shadow, a
  monstrous hatred of the other man in brown, possessed him. He had conceived
  the brilliant idea of abandoning Portsmouth, or at least giving up the
  straight way to his fellow-wayfarers, and of striking out boldly to the left,
  eastward. He did not dare to stop at any of the inviting public-houses in the
  main street of Haslemere, but turned up a side way and found a little
  beer-shop, the Good Hope, wherein to refresh himself. And there he ate and
  gossipped condescendingly with an aged labourer, assuming the while for his
  own private enjoyment the attributes of a Lost Heir, and afterwards mounted
  and rode on towards Northchapel, a place which a number of finger-posts
  conspired to boom, but which some insidious turning prevented him from
  attaining.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="chap10"
     name="chap10">X. &mdash; HOW MR. HOOPDRIVER REACHED MIDHURST</a></h2>

  <h3>§ XIV</h3>

  <p class="first">It was one of my uncle's profoundest remarks that human
  beings are the only unreasonable creatures. This observation was so far
  justified by Mr. Hoopdriver that, after spending the morning tortuously
  avoiding the other man in brown and the Young Lady in Grey, he spent a
  considerable part of the afternoon in thinking about the Young Lady in Grey,
  and contemplating in an optimistic spirit the possibilities of seeing her
  again. Memory and imagination played round her, so that his course was
  largely determined by the windings of the road he traversed. Of one general
  proposition he was absolutely convinced. "There's something Juicy wrong with
  'em," said he&mdash;once even aloud. But what it was he could not imagine. He
  recapitulated the facts. "Miss Beaumont&mdash;brother and sister&mdash;and
  the stoppage to quarrel and weep&mdash;it was perplexing material for a young
  man of small experience. There was no exertion he hated so much as inference,
  and after a time he gave up any attempt to get at the realities of the case,
  and let his imagination go free. Should he ever see her again? Suppose he
  did&mdash;with that other chap not about. The vision he found pleasantest was
  an encounter with her, an unexpected encounter at the annual Dancing Class
  'Do' at the Putney Assembly Rooms. Somehow they would drift together, and he
  would dance with her again and again. It was a pleasant vision, for you must
  understand that Mr. Hoopdriver danced uncommonly well. Or again, in the shop,
  a sudden radiance in the doorway, and she is bowed towards the Manchester
  counter. And then to lean over that counter and murmur, seemingly
  <i>apropos</i> of the goods under discussion, "I have not forgotten that
  morning on the Portsmouth road," and lower, "I never shall forget."</p>

  <p>At Northchapel Mr. Hoopdriver consulted his map and took counsel and
  weighed his course of action. Petworth seemed a possible resting-place, or
  Pullborough; Midhurst seemed too near, and any place over the Downs beyond,
  too far, and so he meandered towards Petworth, posing himself perpetually and
  loitering, gathering wild flowers and wondering why they had no
  names&mdash;for he had never heard of any&mdash;dropping them furtively at
  the sight of a stranger, and generally 'mucking about.' There were purple
  vetches in the hedges, meadowsweet, honeysuckle, belated brambles&mdash;but
  the dog-roses had already gone; there were green and red blackberries,
  stellarias, and dandelions, and in another place white dead nettles,
  traveller's-joy, clinging bedstraw, grasses flowering, white campions, and
  ragged robins. One cornfield was glorious with poppies, bright scarlet and
  purple white, and the blue corn-flowers were beginning. In the lanes the
  trees met overhead, and the wisps of hay still hung to the straggling hedges.
  Iri one of the main roads he steered a perilous passage through a dozen surly
  dun oxen. Here and there were little cottages, and picturesque beer-houses
  with the vivid brewers' boards of blue and scarlet, and once a broad green
  and a church, and an expanse of some hundred houses or so. Then he came to a
  pebbly rivulet that emerged between clumps of sedge loosestrife and
  forget-me-nots under an arch of trees, and rippled across the road, and there
  he dismounted, longing to take off shoes and stockings&mdash;those stylish
  chequered stockings were now all dimmed with dust&mdash;and paddle his lean
  legs in the chuckling cheerful water. But instead he sat in a manly attitude,
  smoking a cigarette, for fear lest the Young Lady in Grey should come
  glittering round the corner. For the flavour of the Young Lady in Grey was
  present through it all, mixing with the flowers and all the delight of it, a
  touch that made this second day quite different from the first, an undertone
  of expectation, anxiety, and something like regret that would not be
  ignored.</p>

  <p class="caption">...Paddle his lean legs in the chuckling cheerful

  <p>It was only late in the long evening that, quite abruptly, he began to
  repent, vividly and decidedly, having fled these two people. He was getting
  hungry, and that has a curious effect upon the emotional colouring of our
  minds. The man was a sinister brute, Hoopdriver saw in a flash of
  inspiration, and the girl&mdash;she was in some serious trouble. And he who
  might have helped her had taken his first impulse as decisive&mdash;and
  bolted. This new view of it depressed him dreadfully. What might not be
  happening to her now? He thought again of her tears. Surely it was merely his
  duty, seeing the trouble afoot, to keep his eye upon it.</p>

  <p>He began riding fast to get quit of such selfreproaches. He found himself
  in a tortuous tangle of roads, and as the dusk was coming on, emerged, not at
  Petworth but at Easebourne, a mile from Midhurst. "I'm getting hungry," said
  Mr. Hoopdriver, inquiring of a gamekeeper in Easebourne village. "Midhurst a
  mile, and Petworth five!&mdash;Thenks, I'll take Midhurst."</p>

  <p class="caption">He came into Midhurst by the bridge at the

  <p>He came into Midhurst by the bridge at the watermill, and up the North
  Street, and a little shop flourishing cheerfully, the cheerful sign of a
  teapot, and exhibiting a brilliant array of tobaccos, sweets, and children's
  toys in the window, struck his fancy. A neat, bright-eyed little old lady
  made him welcome, and he was presently supping sumptuously on sausages and
  tea, with a visitors' book full of the most humorous and flattering remarks
  about the little old lady, in verse and prose, propped up against his teapot
  as he ate. Regular good some of the jokes were, and rhymes that read
  well&mdash;even with your mouth full of sausage. Mr. Hoopdriver formed a
  vague idea of drawing "something"&mdash;for his judgment on the little old
  lady was already formed. He pictured the little old lady discovering it
  afterwards&mdash;"My gracious! One of them Punch men," she would say. The
  room had a curtained recess and a chest of drawers, for presently it was to
  be his bedroom, and the day part of it was decorated with framed Oddfellows'
  certificates and giltbacked books and portraits, and kettle-holders, and all
  kinds of beautiful things made out of wool; very comfortable it was indeed.
  The window was lead framed and diamond paned, and through it one saw the
  corner of the vicarage and a pleasant hill crest, in dusky silhouette against
  the twilight sky. And after the sausages had ceased to be, he lit a Red
  Herring cigarette and went swaggering out into the twilight street. All
  shadowy blue between its dark brick houses, was the street, with a bright
  yellow window here and there and splashes of green and red where the
  chemist's illumination fell across the road.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="chap11"
     name="chap11">XI. &mdash; AN INTERLUDE</a></h2>

  <h3>§ XV</h3>

  <p class="first">And now let us for a space leave Mr. Hoopdriver in the dusky
  Midhurst North Street, and return to the two folks beside the railway bridge
  between Milford and Haslemere. She was a girl of eighteen, dark, fine
  featured, with bright eyes, and a rich, swift colour under her warm-tinted
  skin. Her eyes were all the brighter for the tears that swam in them. The man
  was thirty three or four, fair, with a longish nose overhanging his sandy
  flaxen moustache, pale blue eyes, and a head that struck out above and
  behind. He stood with his feet wide apart, his hand on his hip, in an
  attitude that was equally suggestive of defiance and aggression. They had
  watched Hoopdriver out of sight. The unexpected interruption had stopped the
  flood of her tears. He tugged his abundant moustache and regarded her calmly.
  She stood with face averted, obstinately resolved not to speak first. "Your
  behaviour," he said at last, "makes you conspicuous."</p>

  <p>She turned upon him, her eyes and cheeks glowing, her hands clenched. "You
  unspeakable <i>cad</i>," she said, and choked, stamped her little foot, and
  stood panting.</p>

  <p>"Unspeakable cad! My dear girl! Possible I <i>am</i> an unspeakable cad.
  Who wouldn't be&mdash;for you?"</p>

  <p>"'Dear girl!' How <i>dare</i> you speak to me like that?
  <i>you</i>&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I would do anything&mdash;"</p>

  <p><i>"Oh!"</i></p>

  <p>There was a moment's pause. She looked squarely into his face, her eyes
  alight with anger and contempt, and perhaps he flushed a little. He stroked
  his moustache, and by an effort maintained his cynical calm. "Let us be
  reasonable," he said.</p>

  <p>"Reasonable! That means all that is mean and cowardly and sensual in the
  world."</p>

  <p>"You have always had it so&mdash;in your generalising way. But let us look
  at the facts of the case&mdash;if that pleases you better."</p>

  <p>With an impatient gesture she motioned him to go on.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said,&mdash;"you've eloped."</p>

  <p>"I've left my home," she corrected, with dignity. "I left my home because
  it was unendurable. Because that woman&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes. But the point is, you have eloped with me."</p>

  <p>"You came with me. You pretended to be my friend. Promised to help me to
  earn a living by writing. It was you who said, why shouldn't a man and woman
  be friends? And now you dare&mdash;you dare&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Really, Jessie, this pose of yours, this injured innocence&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I will go back. I forbid you&mdash;I forbid you to stand in the
  way&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"One moment. I have always thought that my little pupil was at least
  clear-headed. You don't know everything yet, you know. Listen to me for a
  moment."</p>

  <p>"Haven't I been listening? And you have only insulted me. You who dared
  only to talk of friendship, who scarcely dared hint at anything beyond."</p>

  <p>"But you took the hints, nevertheless. You knew. You <i>knew</i>. And you
  did not mind. <i>Mind!</i> You liked it. It was the fun of the whole thing
  for you. That I loved you, and could not speak to you. You played with
  it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You have said all that before. Do you think that justifies you?"</p>

  <p>"That isn't all. I made up my mind&mdash;Well, to make the game more even.
  And so I suggested to you and joined with you in this expedition of yours,
  invented a sister at Midhurst&mdash;I tell you, I <i>haven't</i> a sister!
  For one object&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"To compromise you."</p>

  <p>She started. That was a new way of putting it. For half a minute neither
  spoke. Then she began half defiantly: "Much I am compromised. Of
  course&mdash;I have made a fool of myself&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear girl, you are still on the sunny side of eighteen, and you know
  very little of this world. Less than you think. But you will learn. Before
  you write all those novels we have talked about, you will have to learn. And
  that's one point&mdash;" He hesitated. "You started and blushed when the man
  at breakfast called you Ma'am. You thought it a funny mistake, but you did
  not say anything because he was young and nervous&mdash;and besides, the
  thought of being my wife offended your modesty. You didn't care to notice it.
  But&mdash;you see; I gave your name as <i>Mrs.</i> Beaumont." He looked
  almost apologetic, in spite of his cynical pose. "<i>Mrs.</i> Beaumont," he
  repeated, pulling his flaxen moustache and watching the effect.</p>

  <p>She looked into his eyes speechless. "I am learning fast," she said
  slowly, at last.</p>

  <p>He thought the time had come for an emotional attack. "Jessie," he said,
  with a sudden change of voice, "I know all this is mean, isvillanous. But do
  you think that I have done all this scheming, all this subterfuge, for any
  other object&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She did not seem to listen to his words. "I shall ride home," she said
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>"To her?"</p>

  <p>She winced.</p>

  <p>"Just think," said he, "what she could say to you after this."</p>

  <p>"Anyhow, I shall leave you now."</p>

  <p>"Yes? And go&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Go somewhere to earn my living, to be a free woman, to live without
  conventionality&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear girl, do let us be cynical. You haven't money and you haven't
  credit. No one would take you in. It's one of two things: go back to your
  stepmother, or&mdash;trust to me."</p>

  <p>"How <i>can</i> I?"</p>

  <p>"Then you must go back to her." He paused momentarily, to let this
  consideration have its proper weight. "Jessie, I did not mean to say the
  things I did. Upon my honour, I lost my head when I spoke so. If you will,
  forgive me. I am a man. I could not help myself. Forgive me, and I promise
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How can I trust you?"</p>

  <p>"Try me. I can assure you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She regarded him distrustfully.</p>

  <p>"At any rate, ride on with me now. Surely we have been in the shadow of
  this horrible bridge long enough."</p>

  <p>"Oh! let me think," she said, half turning from him and pressing her hand
  to her brow.</p>

  <p>"<i>Think!</i> Look here, Jessie. It is ten o'clock. Shall we call a truce
  until one?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated, demanded a definition of the truce, and at last agreed.</p>

  <p>They mounted, and rode on in silence, through the sunlight and the
  heather. Both were extremely uncomfortable and disappointed. She was pale,
  divided between fear and anger. She perceived she was in a scrape, and tried
  in vain to think of a way of escape. Only one tangible thing would keep in
  her mind, try as she would to ignore it. That was the quite irrelevant fact
  that his head was singularly like an albino cocoanut. He, too, felt thwarted.
  He felt that this romantic business of seduction was, after all, unexpectedly
  tame. But this was only the beginning. At any rate, every day she spent with
  him was a day gained. Perhaps things looked worse than they were; that was
  some consolation.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="chap12"
     name="chap12">XII. &mdash; OF THE ARTIFICIAL IN MAN, AND OF THE
     ZEITGEIST</a></h2>

  <h3>§ XVI</h3>

  <p class="first">You have seen these two young people&mdash;Bechamel, by-the-
  bye, is the man's name, and the girl's is Jessie Milton&mdash;from the
  outside; you have heard them talking; they ride now side by side (but not too
  close together, and in an uneasy silence) towards Haslemere; and this chapter
  will concern itself with those curious little council chambers inside their
  skulls, where their motives are in session and their acts are considered and
  passed.</p>

  <p>But first a word concerning wigs and false teeth. Some jester, enlarging
  upon the increase of bald heads and purblind people, has deduced a wonderful
  future for the children of men. Man, he said, was nowadays a hairless
  creature by forty or fifty, and for hair we gave him a wig; shrivelled, and
  we padded him; toothless, and lo! false teeth set in gold. Did he lose a
  limb, and a fine, new, artificial one was at his disposal; get indigestion,
  and to hand was artificial digestive fluid or bile or pancreatine, as the
  case might be. Complexions, too, were replaceable, spectacles superseded an
  inefficient eye-lens, and imperceptible false diaphragms were thrust into the
  failing ear. So he went over our anatomies, until, at last, he had conjured
  up a weird thing of shreds and patches, a simulacrum, an artificial body of a
  man, with but a doubtful germ of living flesh lurking somewhere in his
  recesses. To that, he held, we were coming.</p>

  <p>How far such odd substitution for the body is possible need not concern us
  now. But the devil, speaking by the lips of Mr. Rudyard Kipling, hath it that
  in the case of one Tomlinson, the thing, so far as the soul is concerned, has
  already been accomplished. Time was when men had simple souls, desires as
  natural as their eyes, a little reasonable philanthropy, a little reasonable
  philoprogenitiveness, hunger, and a taste for good living, a decent, personal
  vanity, a healthy, satisfying pugnacity, and so forth. But now we are taught
  and disciplined for years and years, and thereafter we read and read for all
  the time some strenuous, nerve-destroying business permits. Pedagogic
  hypnotists, pulpit and platform hypnotists, book-writing hypnotists,
  newspaper-writing hypnotists, are at us all. This sugar you are eating, they
  tell us, is ink, and forthwith we reject it with infinite disgust. This black
  draught of unrequited toil is True Happiness, and down it goes with every
  symptom of pleasure. This Ibsen, they say, is dull past believing, and we
  yawn and stretch beyond endurance. Pardon! they interrupt, but this Ibsen is
  deep and delightful, and we vie with one another in an excess of
  entertainment. And when we open the heads of these two young people, we find,
  not a straightforward motive on the surface anywhere; we find, indeed, not a
  soul so much as an oversoul, a zeitgeist, a congestion of acquired ideas, a
  highway's feast of fine, confused thinking. The girl is resolute to Live Her
  Own Life, a phrase you may have heard before, and the man has a pretty
  perverted ambition to be a cynical artistic person of the very calmest
  description. He is hoping for the awakening of Passion in her, among other
  things. He knows Passion ought to awaken, from the text-books he has studied.
  He knows she admires his genius, but he is unaware that she does not admire
  his head. He is quite a distinguished art critic in London, and he met her at
  that celebrated lady novelist's, her stepmother, and here you have them well
  embarked upon the Adventure. Both are in the first stage of repentance, which
  consists, as you have probably found for yourself, in setting your teeth hard
  and saying' "I <i>will</i> go on."</p>

  <p>Things, you see, have jarred a little, and they ride on their way together
  with a certain aloofness of manner that promises ill for the orthodox
  development of the Adventure. He perceives he was too precipitate. But he
  feels his honour is involved, and meditates the development of a new attack.
  And the girl? She is unawakened. Her motives are bookish, written by a
  haphazard syndicate of authors, novelists, and biographers, on her white
  inexperience. An artificial oversoul she is, that may presently break down
  and reveal a human being beneath it. She is still in that schoolgirl phase
  when a talkative old man is more interesting than a tongue-tied young one,
  and when to be an eminent mathematician, say, or to edit a daily paper, seems
  as fine an ambition as any girl need aspire to. Bechaniel was to have helped
  her to attain that in the most expeditious manner, and here he is beside her,
  talking enigmatical phrases about passion, looking at her with the oddest
  expression, and once, and that was his gravest offence, offering to kiss her.
  At any rate he has apologised. She still scarcely realises, you see, the
  scrape she has got into.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="chap13"
     name="chap13">XIII. &mdash; THE ENCOUNTER AT MIDHURST</a></h2>

  <h3>§ XVII</h3>

  <p class="first">We left Mr. Hoopdriver at the door of the little tea, toy,
  and tobacco shop. You must not think that a strain is put on coincidence when
  I tell you that next door to Mrs. Wardor's&mdash;that was the name of the
  bright-eyed, little old lady with whom Mr. Hoopdriver had stopped&mdash;is
  the Angel Hotel, and in the Angel Hotel, on the night that Mr. Hoopdriver
  reached Midhurst, were 'Mr.' and 'Miss' Beaumont, our Bechamel and Jessie
  Milton. Indeed, it was a highly probable thing; for if one goes through
  Guildford, the choice of southward roads is limited; you may go by
  Petersfield to Portsmouth, or by Midhurst to Chichester, in addition to which
  highways there is nothing for it but minor roadways to Petworth or
  Pulborough, and cross-cuts Brightonward. And coming to Midhurst from the
  north, the Angel's entrance lies yawning to engulf your highly respectable
  cyclists, while Mrs. Wardor's genial teapot is equally attractive to those
  who weigh their means in little scales. But to people unfamiliar with the
  Sussex roads&mdash;and such were the three persons of this story&mdash;the
  convergence did not appear to be so inevitable.</p>

  <p>Bechamel, tightening his chain in the Angel yard after dinner, was the
  first to be aware of their reunion. He saw Hoopdriver walk slowly across the
  gateway, his head enhaloed in cigarette smoke, and pass out of sight up the
  street. Incontinently a mass of cloudy uneasiness, that had been partly
  dispelled during the day, reappeared and concentrated rapidly into definite
  suspicion. He put his screw hammer into his pocket and walked through the
  archway into the street, to settle the business forthwith, for he prided
  himself on his decision. Hoopdriver was merely promenading, and they met face
  to face.</p>

  <p>At the sight of his adversary, something between disgust and laughter
  seized Mr. Hoopdriver and for a moment destroyed his animosity. "'Ere we are
  again!" he said, laughing insincerely in a sudden outbreak at the perversity
  of chance.</p>

  <p>The other man in brown stopped short in Mr. Hoopdriver's way, staring.
  Then his face assumed an expression of dangerous civility. "Is it any
  information to you," he said, with immense politeness, "when I remark that
  you are following us?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoopdriver, for some occult reason, resisted his characteristic
  impulse to apologise. He wanted to annoy.the other man in brown, and a
  sentence that had come into his head in a previous rehearsal cropped up
  appropriately. "Since when," said Mr. Hoopdriver, catching his breath, yet
  bringing the question out valiantly, nevertheless,&mdash;"since when 'ave you
  purchased the county of Sussex?"</p>

  <p>"May I point out," said the other man in brown, "that I object&mdash;we
  object not only to your proximity to us. To be frank&mdash;you appear to be
  following us&mdash;with an object."</p>

  <p>"You can always," said Mr. Hoopdriver, "turn round if you don't like it,
  and go back the way you came."</p>

  <p>"Oh-o!" said the other man in brown. "<i>That's</i> it! I thought as
  much."</p>

  <p>"Did you?" said Mr. Hoopdriver, quite at sea, but rising pluckily to the
  unknown occasion. What was the man driving at?</p>

  <p>"I see," said the other man. "I see. I half suspected&mdash;" His manner
  changed abruptly to a quality suspiciously friendly. "Yes&mdash;a word with
  you. You will, I hope, give me ten minutes."</p>

  <p>Wonderful things were dawning on Mr. Hoopdriver. What did the other man
  take him for? Here at last was reality! He hesitated. Then he thought of an
  admirable phrase. "You 'ave some communication&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We'll call it a communication," said the other man.</p>

  <p>"I can spare you the ten minutes," said Mr. Hoopdriver, with dignity.</p>

  <p>"This way, then," said the other man in brown, and they walked slowly down
  the North Street towards the Grammar School. There was, perhaps, thirty
  seconds' silence. The other man stroked his moustache nervously. Mr.
  Hoopdriver's dramatic instincts were now fully awake. He did not quite
  understand in what role he was cast, but it was evidently something dark and
  mysterious. Doctor Conan Doyle, Victor Hugo, and Alexander Dumas were well
  within Mr. Hoopdriver's range of reading, and he had not read them for
  nothing.</p>

  <p>"I will be perfectly frank with you," said the other man in brown.</p>

  <p>"Frankness is always the best course," said Mr. Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>"Well, then&mdash;who the devil set you on this business?"</p>

  <p>"Set me <i>on</i> this business?"</p>

  <p>"Don't pretend to be stupid. Who's your employer? Who engaged you for this
  job?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Mr. Hoopdriver, confused. "No&mdash;I can't say."</p>

  <p>"Quite sure?" The other man in brown glanced meaningly down at his hand,
  and Mr. Hoopdriver, following him mechanically, saw a yellow milled edge
  glittering in the twilight. Now your shop assistant is just above the tip-
  receiving class, and only just above it&mdash;so that he is acutely sensitive
  on the point.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoopdriver flushed hotly, and his eyes were angry as he met those of
  the other man in brown. "Stow it!" said Mr. Hoopdriver, stopping and facing
  the tempter.</p>

    <p><a id="pic18"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>
  <br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1303441h-images/WOC18.jpg"
         alt="'Stow it!' said Mr. Hoopdriver.">
  </div>

  <p class="caption">"Stow it!" said Mr. Hoopdriver.</p><br>

  <p>"What!" said the other man in brown, surprised. "Eigh?" And so saying he
  stowed it in his breeches pocket.</p>

  <p>"D'yer think I'm to be bribed?" said Mr. Hoopdriver, whose imagination was
  rapidly expanding the situation. "By Gosh! I'd follow you now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear sir," said the other man in brown, "I beg your pardon. I
  misunderstood you. I really beg your pardon. Let us walk on. In your
  profession&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What have you got to say against my profession?"</p>

  <p>"Well, really, you know. There are detectives of an inferior description
  &mdash;watchers. The whole class. Private Inquiry&mdash;I did not realise
  &mdash;I really trust you will overlook what was, after all&mdash;you must
  admit&mdash;a natural indiscretion. Men of honour are not so common in the
  world&mdash;in any profession."</p>

  <p>It was lucky for Mr. Hoopdriver that in Midhurst they do not light the
  lamps in the summer time, or the one they were passing had betrayed him. As
  it was, he had to snatch suddenly at his moustache and tug fiercely at it, to
  conceal the furious tumult of exultation, the passion of laughter, that came
  boiling up. Detective! Even in the shadow Bechamel saw that a laugh was
  stifled, but he put it down to the fact that the phrase "men of honour"
  amused his interlocutor. "He'll come round yet," said Bechamel to himself.
  "He's simply holding out for a fiver." He coughed.</p>

  <p>"I don't see that it hurts you to tell me who your employer is."</p>

  <p>"Don't you? I do."</p>

  <p>"Prompt," said Bechamel, appreciatively. "Now here's the thing I want to
  put to you&mdash;the kernel of the whole business. You need not answer if you
  don't want to. There's no harm done in my telling you what I want to know.
  Are you employed to watch me&mdash;or Miss Milton?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not the leaky sort," said Mr. Hoopdriver, keeping the secret he did
  not know with immense enjoyment. Miss Milton! That was her name. Perhaps he'd
  tell some more. "It's no good pumping. Is that all you're after?" said Mr.
  Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>Bechamel respected himself for his diplomatic gifts. He tried to catch a
  remark by throwing out a confidence. "I take it there are two people
  concerned in watching this affair."</p>

  <p>"Who's the other?" said Mr. Hoopdriver, calmly, but controlling with
  enormous internal tension his selfappreciation. "Who's the other?" was really
  brilliant, he thought.</p>

  <p>"There's my wife and <i>her</i> stepmother."</p>

  <p>"And you want to know which it is?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Bechamel.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;arst 'em!" said Mr. Hoopdriver, his exultation getting the
  better of him, and with a pretty consciousness of repartee. "Arst 'em
  both."</p>

  <p>Bechamel turned impatiently. Then he made a last effort. "I'd give a five-
  pound note to know just the precise state of affairs," he said.</p>

  <p>"I told you to stow that," said Mr. Hoopdriver, in a threatening tone. And
  added with perfect truth and a magnificent mystery, "You don't quite
  understand who you're dealing with. But you will!" He spoke with such
  conviction that he half believed that that defective office of his in London
  &mdash;Baker Street, in fact&mdash;really existed.</p>

  <p>With that the interview terminated. Bechamel went back to the Angel,
  perturbed. "Hang detectives!" It wasn't the kind of thing he had anticipated
  at all. Hoopdriver, with round eyes and a wondering smile, walked down to
  where the mill waters glittered in the moonlight, and after meditating over
  the parapet of the bridge for a space, with occasional murmurs of, "Private
  Inquiry" and the like, returned, with mystery even in his paces, towards the
  town.</p><br>

  <h3>§ XVIII</h3>

  <p class="first">That glee which finds expression in raised eyebrows and
  long, low whistling noises was upon Mr. Hoopdriver. For a space he forgot the
  tears of the Young Lady in Grey. Here was a new game!&mdash;and a real one.
  Mr. Hoopdriver as a Private Inquiry Agent, a Sherlock Holmes in fact, keeping
  these two people 'under observation.' He walked slowly back from the bridge
  until he was opposite the Angel, and stood for ten minutes, perhaps,
  contemplating that establishment and enjoying all the strange sensations of
  being this wonderful, this mysterious and terrible thing. Everything fell
  into place in his scheme. He had, of course, by a kind of instinct, assumed
  the disguise of a cyclist, picked up the first old crock he came across as a
  means of pursuit. 'No expense was to be spared.'</p>

  <p>Then he tried to understand what it was in particular that he was
  observing. "My wife"&mdash;"<i>Her</i> stepmother!" Then he remembered her
  swimming eyes. Abruptly came a wave of anger that surprised him, washed away
  the detective superstructure, and left him plain Mr. Hoopdriver. This man in
  brown, with his confident manner, and his proffered half sovereign (damn
  him!) was up to no good, else why should he object to being watched? He was
  married! She was not his sister. He began to understand. A horrible suspicion
  of the state of affairs came into Mr. Hoopdriver's head. Surely it had not
  come to <i>that</i>. He was a detective!&mdash;he would find out. How was it
  to be done? He began to submit sketches on approval to himself. It required
  an effort before he could walk into the Angel bar. "A lemonade and bitter,
  please," said Mr. Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>He cleared his throat. "Are Mr. and Mrs. Bowlong stopping here?"</p>

  <p>"What, a gentleman and a young lady&mdash;on bicycles?"</p>

  <p>"Fairly young&mdash;a married couple."</p>

  <p>"No," said the barmaid, a talkative person of ample dimensions. "There's
  no married couples stopping here. But there's a Mr. and Miss
  B-E-A-U-M-O-N-T." She spelt it for precision. "Sure you've got the name
  right, young man?"</p>

  <p>"Quite," said Mr. Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>"Beaumont there is, but no one of the name of&mdash;What was the name you
  gave?"</p>

  <p>"Bowlong," said Mr. Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>"No, there ain't no Bowlong," said the barmaid, taking up a glasscloth and
  a drying tumbler and beginning to polish the latter. "First off, I thought
  you might be asking for Beaumont&mdash;the names being similar. Were you
  expecting them on bicycles?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;they said they <i>might</i> be in Midhurst tonight."</p>

  <p>"P'raps they'll come presently. Beaumont's here, but no Bowlong. Sure that
  Beaumont ain't the name?"</p>

  <p>"Certain," said Mr. Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>"It's curious the names being so alike. I thought p'raps&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And so they conversed at some length, Mr. Hoopdriver delighted to find his
  horrible suspicion disposed of. The barmaid having listened awhile at the
  staircase volunteered some particulars of the young couple upstairs. Her
  modesty was much impressed by the young lady's costume, so she intimated, and
  Mr. Hoopdriver whispered the badinage natural to the occasion, at which she
  was coquettishly shocked. "There'll be no knowing which is which, in a year
  or two," said the barmaid. "And her manner too! She got off her machine and
  give it 'im to stick up against the kerb, and in she marched. 'I and my
  brother,' says she, 'want to stop here to-night. My brother doesn't mind what
  kind of room 'e 'as, but I want a room with a good view, if there's one to be
  got,' says she. He comes hurrying in after and looks at her. 'I've settled
  the rooms,' she says, and 'e says 'damn!' just like that. I can fancy my
  brother letting me boss the show like that."</p>

  <p>"I dessay you do," said Mr. Hoopdriver, "if the truth was known."</p>

  <p>The barmaid looked down, smiled and shook her head, put down the tumbler,
  polished, and took up another that had been draining, and shook the drops of
  water into her little zinc sink.</p>

  <p>"She'll be a nice little lot to marry," said the barmaid. "She'll be
  wearing the&mdash;well, b-dashes, as the sayin' is. I can't think what girls
  is comin' to."</p>

    <p><a id="pic19"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>

         alt="'I can't think what girls is comin' to.'">
  </div>

  <p class="caption">"I can't think what girls is comin' to."</p><br>

  <p>This depreciation of the Young Lady in Grey was hardly to Hoopdriver's
  taste.</p>

  <p>"Fashion," said he, taking up his change. "Fashion is all the go with you
  ladies&mdash;and always was. You'll be wearing 'em yourself before a couple
  of years is out."</p>

  <p>"Nice they'd look on my figger," said the barmaid, with a titter. "No
  &mdash;I ain't one of your fashionable sort. Gracious no! I shouldn't feel as
  if I'd anything on me, not more than if I'd forgot&mdash;Well, there! I'm
  talking." She put down the glass abruptly. "I dessay I'm old fashioned," she
  said, and walked humming down the bar.</p>

  <p>"Not you," said Mr. Hoopdriver. He waited until he caught her eye, then
  with his native courtesy smiled, raised his cap, and wished her good
  evening.</p><br>

  <h3>§ XIX</h3>

  <p class="first">Then Mr. Hoopdriver returned to the little room with the
  lead-framed windows where he had dined, and where the bed was now comfortably
  made, sat down on the box under the window, stared at the moon rising on the
  shining vicarage roof, and tried to collect his thoughts. How they whirled at
  first! It was past ten, and most of Midhurst was tucked away in bed, some one
  up the street was learning the violin, at rare intervals a belated inhabitant
  hurried home and woke the echoes, and a corncrake kept up a busy churning in
  the vicarage garden. The sky was deep blue, with a still luminous afterglow
  along the hlack edge of the hill, and the white moon overhead, save for a
  couple of yellow stars, had the sky to herself.</p>

  <p>At first his thoughts were kinetic, of deeds and not relationships. There
  was this malefactor, and his victim, and it had fallen on Mr. Hoopdriver to
  take a hand in the game. <i>He</i> was married. Did she know he was married?
  Never for a moment did a thought of evil concerning her cross Hoopdriver's
  mind. Simple-minded people see questions of morals so much better than
  superior persons&mdash;who have read and thought themselves complex to
  impotence. He had heard her voice, seen the frank light in her eyes, and she
  had been weeping&mdash;that sufficed. The rights of the case he hadn't
  properly grasped. But he would. And that smirking&mdash;well, swine was the
  mildest for him. He recalled the exceedingly unpleasant incident of the
  railway bridge. "Thin we won't detain yer, thenks," said Mr. Hoopdriver,
  aloud, in a strange, unnatural, contemptible voice, supposed to represent
  that of Bechamel. "Oh, the <i>beggar</i>! I'll be level with him yet. He's
  afraid of us detectives&mdash;that I'll <i>swear</i>." (If Mrs. Wardor should
  chance to be on the other side of the door within earshot, well and
  good.)</p>

  <p>For a space he meditated chastisements and revenges, physical
  impossibilities for the most part,&mdash;Bechamel staggering headlong from
  the impact of Mr. Hoopdriver's large, but, to tell the truth, ill supported
  fist, Bechamel's five feet nine of height lifted from the ground and
  quivering under a vigorously applied horsewhip. So pleasant was such
  dreaming, that Mr. Hoopdriver's peaked face under the moonlight was
  transfigured. One might have paired him with that well-known and universally
  admired triumph, 'The Soul's Awakening,' so sweet was his ecstasy. And
  presently with his thirst for revenge glutted by six or seven violent
  assaults, a duel and two vigorous murders, his mind came round to the Young
  Lady in Grey again.</p>

  <p>She was a plucky one too. He went over the incident the barmaid at the
  Angel had described to him. His thoughts ceased to be a torrent, smoothed
  down to a mirror in which she was reflected with infinite clearness and
  detail. He'd never met anything like her before. Fancy that bolster of a
  barmaid being dressed in that way! He whuffed a contemptuous laugh. He
  compared her colour, her vigour, her voice, with the Young Ladies in Business
  with whom his lot had been cast. Even in tears she was beautiful, more
  beautiful indeed to him, for it made her seem softer and weaker, more
  accessible. And such weeping as he had seen before had been so much a matter
  of damp white faces, red noses, and hair coming out of curl. Your draper's
  assistant becomes something of a judge of weeping, because weeping is the
  custom of all Young Ladies in Business, when for any reason their services
  are dispensed with. She could weep&mdash;and (by Gosh!) she could smile.
  <i>He</i> knew that, and reverting to acting abruptly, he smiled
  confidentially at the puckered pallor of the moon.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to say how long Mr. Hoopdriver's pensiveness lasted. It
  seemed a long time before his thoughts of action returned. Then he remembered
  he was a 'watcher'; that to-morrow he must be busy. It would be in character
  to make notes, and he pulled out his little note-book. With that in hand he
  fell a-thinking again. Would that chap tell her the 'tecks were after them?
  If so, would she be as anxious to get away as <i>he</i> was? He must be on
  the alert. If possible he must speak to her. Just a significant word, "Your
  friend&mdash;trust me!"&mdash;It occurred to him that to-morrow these
  fugitives might rise early to escape. At that he thought of the time and
  found it was half-past eleven. "Lord!" said he, "I must see that I wake." He
  yawned and rose. The blind was up, and he pulled back the little chintz
  curtains to let the sunlight strike across to the bed, hung his watch within
  good view of his pillow, on a nail that supported a kettle-holder, and sat
  down on his bed to undress. He lay awake for a little while thinking of the
  wonderful possibilities of the morrow, and thence he passed gloriously into
  the wonderland of dreams.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="chap14"
     name="chap14">XIV. &mdash; THE PURSUIT</a></h2>

  <h3>§ XX</h3>

  <p class="first">And now to tell of Mr. Hoopdriver, rising with the sun,
  vigilant, active, wonderful, the practicable half of the lead-framed window
  stuck open, ears alert, an eye flickering incessantly in the corner panes, in
  oblique glances at the Angel front. Mrs. Wardor wanted him to have his
  breakfast downstairs in her kitchen, but that would have meant abandoning the
  watch, and he held out strongly. The bicycle, <i>cap-a-pie</i>, occupied,
  under protest, a strategic position in the shop. He was expectant by six in
  the morning. By nine horrible fears oppressed him that his quest had escaped
  him, and he had to reconnoitre the Angel yard in order to satisfy himself.
  There he found the ostler (How are the mighty fallen in these decadent days!)
  brushing down the bicycles of the chase, and he returned relieved to Mrs.
  Wardor's premises. And about ten they emerged, and rode quietly up the North
  Street. He watched them until they turned the corner of the post office, and
  then out into the road and up after them in fine style! They went by the
  engine-house where the old stocks and the whipping posts are, and on to the
  Chichester road, and he followed gallantly. So this great chase began.</p>

  <p>They did not look round, and he kept them just within sight, getting down
  if he chanced to draw closely upon them round a corner. By riding vigorously
  he kept quite conveniently near them, for they made but little hurry. He grew
  hot indeed, and his knees were a little stiff to begin with, but that was
  all. There was little danger of losing them, for a thin chalky dust lay upon
  the road, and the track of her tire was milled like a shilling, and his was a
  chequered ribbon along the way. So they rode by Cobden's monument and through
  the prettiest of villages, until at last the downs rose steeply ahead. There
  they stopped awhile at the only inn in the place, and Mr. Hoopdriver took up
  a position which commanded the inn door, and mopped his face and thirsted and
  smoked a Red Herring cigarette. They remained in the inn for some time. A
  number of chubby innocents returning home from school, stopped and formed a
  line in front of him, and watched him quietly but firmly for the space of ten
  minutes or so. "Go away," said he, and they only seemed quietly interested.
  He asked them all their names then, and they answered indistinct murmurs. He
  gave it up at last and became passive on his gate, and so at length they
  tired of him.</p>

    <p><a id="pic20"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>

         alt="A number of chubby innocents watched him quietly but firmly.">
  </div><br>

  <p class="caption">A number of chubby innocents... watched him quietly but
  firmly.</p><br>

  <p>The couple under observation occupied the inn so long that Mr. Hoopdriver
  at the thought of their possible employment hungered as well as thirsted.
  Clearly, they were lunching. It was a cloudless day, and the sun at the
  meridian beat down upon the top of Mr. Hoopdriver's head, a shower bath of
  sunshine, a huge jet of hot light. It made his head swim. At last they
  emerged, and the other man in brown looked back and saw him. They rode on to
  the foot of the down, and dismounting began to push tediously up that long
  nearly vertical ascent of blinding white road, Mr. Hoopdriver hesitated. It
  might take them twenty minutes to mount that. Beyond was empty downland
  perhaps for miles. He decided to return to the inn and snatch a hasty
  meal.</p>

  <p>At the inn they gave him biscuits and cheese and a misleading pewter
  measure of sturdy ale, pleasant under the palate, cool in the throat, but
  leaden in the legs, of a hot afternoon. He felt a man of substance as he
  emerged in the blinding sunshine, but even by the foot of the down the sun
  was insisting again that his skull was too small for his brains. The hill had
  gone steeper, the chalky road blazed like a magnesium light, and his front
  wheel began an apparently incurable squeaking. He felt as a man from Mars
  would feel if he were suddenly transferred to this planet, about three times
  as heavy as he was wont to feel. The two little black figures had vanished
  over the forehead of the hill. "The tracks'll be all right," said Mr.
  Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>That was a comforting reflection. It not only justified a slow progress up
  the hill, but at the crest a sprawl on the turf beside the road, to
  contemplate the Weald from the south. In a matter of two days he had crossed
  that spacious valley, with its frozen surge of green hills, its little
  villages and townships here and there, its copses and cornfields, its ponds
  and streams like jewelery of diamonds and silver glittering in the sun. The
  North Downs were hidden, far away beyond the Wealden Heights. Down below was
  the little village of Cocking, and half-way up the hill, a mile perhaps to
  the right, hung a flock of sheep grazing together. Overhead an anxious peewit
  circled against the blue, and every now and then emitted its feeble cry. Up
  here the heat was tempered by a pleasant breeze. Mr. Hoopdriver was possessed
  by unreasonable contentment; he lit himself a cigarette and lounged more
  comfortably. Surely the Sussex ale is made of the waters of Lethe, of poppies
  and pleasant dreams. Drowsiness coiled insidiously about him.</p>

  <p>He awoke with a guilty start, to find himself sprawling prone on the turf
  with his cap over one eye. He sat up, rubbed his eyes, and realised that he
  had slept. His head was still a trifle heavy. And the chase? He jumped to his
  feet and stooped to pick. up his overturned machine. He whipped out his watch
  and saw that it was past two o'clock. "Lord love us, fancy that!&mdash;But
  the tracks'll be all right," said Mr. Hoopdriver, wheeling his machine back
  to the chalky road. "I must scorch till I overtake them."</p>

  <p>He mounted and rode as rapidly as the heat and a lingering lassitude
  permitted. Now and then he had to dismount to examine the surface where the
  road forked. He enjoyed that rather. "Trackin'," he said aloud, and decided
  in the privacy of his own mind that he had a wonderful instinct for 'spoor.'
  So he came past Goodwood station and Lavant, and approached Chichester
  towards four o'clock. And then came a terrible thing. In places the road
  became hard, in places were the crowded indentations of a recent flock of
  sheep, and at last in the throat of the town cobbles and the stony streets
  branching east, west, north, and south, at a stone cross under the shadow of
  the cathedral the tracks vanished. "O Cricky!" said Mr. Hoopdriver,
  dismounting in dismay and standing agape. "Dropped anything?" said an
  inhabitant at the kerb. "Yes," said Mr. Hoopdriver, "I've lost the spoor,"
  and walked upon his way, leaving the inhabitant marvelling what part of a
  bicycle a spoor might be. Mr. Hoopdriver, abandoning tracking, began asking
  people if they had seen a Young Lady in Grey on a bicycle. Six casual people
  hadn't, and he began to feel the inquiry was conspicuous, and desisted. But
  what was to be done?</p>

    <p><a id="pic21"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>
  <br>

         alt="I've lost the spoor.">
  </div>

  <p class="caption">"I've lost the spoor."</p><br>

  <p>Hoopdriver was hot, tired, and hungry, and full of the first gnawings of a
  monstrous remorse. He decided to get himself some tea and meat, and in the
  Royal George he meditated over the business in a melancholy frame enough.
  They had passed out of his world&mdash;vanished, and all his wonderful dreams
  of some vague, crucial interference collapsed like a castle of cards. What a
  fool he had been not to stick to them like a leech! He might have thought!
  But there!&mdash;what WAS the good of that sort of thing now? He thought of
  her tears, of her helplessness, of the bearing of the other man in brown, and
  his wrath and disappointment surged higher. "What <i>can</i> I do?" said Mr.
  Hoopdriver aloud, bringing his fist down beside the teapot.</p>

  <p>What would Sherlock Holmes have done? Perhaps, after all, there might be
  such things as clues in the world, albeit the age of miracles was past. But
  to look for a clue in this intricate network of cobbled streets, to examine
  every muddy interstice! There was a chance by looking about and inquiry at
  the various inns. Upon that he began. But of course they might have ridden
  straight through and scarcely a soul have marked them. And then came a
  positively brilliant idea. "'Ow many ways are there out of Chichester?" said
  Mr. Hoopdriver. It was really equal to Sherlock Holmes&mdash;that." If
  they've made tracks, I shall find those tracks. If not&mdash;they're in the
  town." He was then in East Street, and he started at once to make the circuit
  of the place, discovering incidentally that Chichester is a walled city. In
  passing, he made inquiries at the Black Swan, the Crown, and the Red Lion
  Hotel. At six o'clock in the evening, he was walking downcast, intent, as one
  who had dropped money, along the road towards Bognor, kicking up the dust
  with his shoes and fretting with disappointed pugnacity. A thwarted,
  crestfallen Hoopdriver it was, as you may well imagine. And then suddenly
  there jumped upon his attention&mdash;a broad line ribbed like a shilling,
  and close beside it one chequered, that ever and again split into two.
  "Found!" said Mr. Hoopdriver and swung round on his heel at once, and back to
  the Royal George, helter skelter, for the bicycle they were minding for him.
  The ostler thought he was confoundedly imperious, considering his
  machine.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="chap15"
     name="chap15">XV. &mdash; AT BOGNOR</a></h2>

  <h3>§ XXI</h3>

  <p class="first">That seductive gentleman, Bechamel, had been working up to a
  crisis. He had started upon this elopement in a vein of fine romance,
  immensely proud of his wickedness, and really as much in love as an
  artificial oversoul can be, with Jessie. But either she was the profoundest
  of coquettes or she had not the slightest element of Passion (with a large P)
  in her composition. It warred with all his ideas of himself and the feminine
  mind to think that under their flattering circumstances she really could be
  so vitally deficient. He found her persistent coolness, her more or less
  evident contempt for himself, exasperating in the highest degree. He put it
  to himself that she was enough to provoke a saint, and tried to think that
  was piquant and enjoyable, but the blisters on his vanity asserted
  themselves. The fact is, he was, under this standing irritation, getting down
  to the natural man in himself for once, and the natural man in himself, in
  spite of Oxford and the junior Reviewers' Club, was a Palaeolithic creature
  of simple tastes and violent methods. "I'll be level with you yet," ran like
  a plough through the soil of his thoughts.</p>

  <p>Then there was this infernal detective. Bechamel had told his wife he was
  going to Davos to see Carter. To that he had fancied she was reconciled, but
  how she would take this exploit was entirely problematical. She was a woman
  of peculiar moral views, and she measured marital infidelity largely by its
  proximity to herself. Out of her sight, and more particularly out of the
  sight of the other women of her set, vice of the recognised description was,
  perhaps, permissible to those contemptible weaklings, men, but this was Evil
  on the High Roads. She was bound to make a fuss, and these fusses invariably
  took the final form of a tightness of money for Bechamel. Albeit, and he felt
  it was heroic of him to resolve so, it was worth doing if it was to be done.
  His imagination worked on a kind of matronly Valkyrie, and the noise of
  pursuit and vengeance was in the air. The idyll still had the front of the
  stage. That accursed detective, it seemed, had been thrown off the scent, and
  that, at any rate, gave a night's respite. But things must be brought to an
  issue forthwith.</p>

  <p>By eight o'clock in the evening, in a little dining-room in the Vicuna
  Hotel, Bognor, the crisis had come, and Jessie, flushed and angry in the face
  and with her heart sinking, faced him again for her last st,ruggle with him.
  He had tricked her this time, effectually, and luck had been on his side. She
  was booked as Mrs. Beaumont. Save for her refusal to enter their room, and
  her eccentricity of eating with unwashed hands, she had so far kept up the
  appearances of things before the waiter. But the dinner was grim enough. Now
  in turn she appealed to his better nature and made extravagant statements of
  her plans to fool him.</p>

  <p>He was white and vicious by this time, and his anger quivered through his
  pose of brilliant wickedness.</p>

  <p>"I will go to the station," she said. "I will go back&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The last train for anywhere leaves at 7.42."</p>

  <p>"I will appeal to the police&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You don't know them."</p>

  <p>"I will tell these hotel people."</p>

  <p>"They will turn you out of doors. You're in such a thoroughly false
  position now. They don't understand unconventionality, down here."</p>

  <p>She stamped her foot. "If I wander about the streets all night&mdash;" she
  said.</p>

  <p>"You who have never been out alone after dusk? Do you know what the
  streets of a charming little holiday resort are like&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't care," she said. "I can go to the clergyman here."</p>

  <p>"He's a charming man. Unmarried. And men are really more alike than you
  think. And anyhow&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"How <i>can</i> you explain the last two nights to anyone now? The
  mischief is done, Jessie."</p>

  <p>"You <i>cur</i>," she said, and suddenly put her hand to her breast. He
  thought she meant to faint, but she stood, with the colour gone from her
  face.</p>

  <p>"No," he said. "I love you."</p>

  <p>"Love!" said she.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;love."</p>

  <p>"There are ways yet," she said, after a pause.</p>

  <p>"Not for you. You are too full of life and hope yet for, what is it?
  &mdash;not the dark arch nor the black flowing river. Don't you think of it.
  You'll only shirk it when the moment comes, and turn it all into comedy."</p>

  <p>She turned round abruptly from him and stood looking out across the parade
  at the shining sea over which the afterglow of day fled before the rising
  moon. He maintained his attitude. The blinds were still up, for she had told
  the waiter not to draw them. There was silence for some moments.</p>

  <p>At last he spoke in as persuasive a voice as he could summon. "Take it
  sensibly, Jessie. Why should we, who have so much in common, quarrel into
  melodrama? I swear I love you. You are all that is bright and desirable to
  me. I am stronger than you, older; man to your woman. To find <i>you</i>
  too&mdash;conventional!"</p>

  <p>She looked at him over her shoulder, and he noticed with a twinge of
  delight how her little chin came out beneath the curve of her cheek.</p>

  <p><i>"Man!"</i> she said. "Man to <i>my</i> woman! Do <i>men</i> lie? Would
  a <i>man</i> use his five and thirty years' experience to outwit a girl of
  seventeen? Man to my woman indeed! That surely is the last insult!"</p>

  <p>"Your repartee is admirable, Jessie. I should say they do,
  though&mdash;all that and more also when their hearts were set on such a girl
  as yourself. For God's sake drop this shrewishness! Why should you be
  so&mdash;difficult to me? Here am I with <i>my</i> reputation, <i>my</i>
  career, at your feet. Look here, Jessie&mdash;on my honour, I will marry
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"God forbid," she said, so promptly that she never learnt he had a wife,
  even then. It occurred to him then for the first time, in the flash of her
  retort, that she did not know he was married.</p>

  <p>"'Tis only a pre-nuptial settlement," he said, following that hint.</p>

  <p>He paused.</p>

  <p>"You must be sensible. The thing's your own doing. Come out on the beach
  now the beach here is splendid, and the moon will soon be high."</p>

  <p>"<i>I won't</i>," she said, stamping her foot.</p>

  <p>"Well, well&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh! leave me alone. Let me think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Think," he said, "if you want to. It's your cry always. But you can't
  save yourself by thinking, my dear girl. You can't save yourself in any way
  now. If saving it is&mdash;this parsimony&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, go&mdash;go."</p>

  <p>"Very well. I will go. I will go and smoke a cigar. And think of you,
  dear... But do you think I should do all this if I did not care?"</p>

  <p>"Go," she whispered, without glancing round. She continued to stare out of
  the window. He stood looking at her for a moment, with a strange light in his
  eyes. He made a step towards her. "I <i>have</i> you,", he said. "You are
  mine. Netted&mdash;caught. But mine." He would have gone up to her and laid
  his hand upon her, but he did not dare to do that yet. "I have you in my
  hand," he said, "in my power. Do you hear&mdash;<i>Power</i>!"</p>

         alt="'I have you,' he said. 'You are mine!'">
  </div>

  <p class="caption">"I have you," he said. "You are mine!"</p><br>

  <p>She remained impassive. He stared at her for half a minute, and then, with
  a superb gesture that was lost upon her, went to the door. Surely the
  instinctive abasement of her sex before Strength was upon his side. He told
  himself that his battle was won. She heard the handle move and the catch
  click as the door closed behind him.</p><br>

  <h3>§ XXII</h3>

  <p class="first">And now without in the twilight behold Mr. Hoopdriver, his
  cheeks hot, his eye bright! His brain is in a tumult. The nervous, obsequious
  Hoopdriver, to whom I introduced you some days since, has undergone a
  wonderful change. Ever since he lost that 'spoor' in Chichester, he has been
  tormented by the most horrible visions of the shameful insults that may be
  happening. The strangeness of new surroundings has been working to strip off
  the habitual servile from him. Here was moonlight rising over the memory of a
  red sunset, dark shadows and glowing orange lamps, beauty somewhere
  mysteriously rapt away from him, tangible wrong in a brown suit and an
  unpleasant face, flouting him. Mr. Hoopdriver for the time, was in the world
  of Romance and Knight-errantry, divinely forgetful of his social position or
  hers; forgetting, too, for the time any of the wretched timidities that had
  tied him long since behind the counter in his proper place. He was angry and
  adventurous. It was all about him, this vivid drama he had fallen into, and
  it was eluding him. He was far too grimly in earnest to pick up that lost
  thread and make a play of it now. The man was living. He did not pose when he
  alighted at the cof ee tavern even, nor when he made his hasty meal.</p>

  <p>As Bechamel crossed from the Vicuna towards the esplanade, Hoopdriver,
  disappointed and exasperated, came hurrying round the corner from the
  Temperance Hotel. At the sight of Bechamel, his heart jumped, and the tension
  of his angry suspense exploded into, rather than gave place to, an excited
  activity of mind. They were at the Vicuna, and she was there now alone. It
  was the occasion he sought. But he would give Chance no chance against him.
  He went back round the corner, sat down on the seat, and watched Bechamel
  recede into the dimness up the esplanade, before he got up and walked into
  the hotel entrance. "A lady cyclist in grey," he asked for, and followed
  boldly on the waiter's heels. The door of the dining-room was opening before
  he felt a qualm. And then suddenly he was nearly minded to turn and run for
  it, and his features seemed to him to be convulsed.</p>

  <p>She turned with a start, and looked at him with something between terror
  and hope in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Can I&mdash;have a few words&mdash;with you, alone?" said Mr. Hoopdriver,
  controlling his breath with difficulty. She hesitated, and then motioned the
  waiter to withdraw.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoopdriver watched the door shut. He had intended to step out into the
  middle of the room, fold his arms and say, "You are in trouble. I am a
  Friend. Trust me." Instead of which he stood panting and then spoke with
  sudden familiarity, hastily, guiltily: "Look here. I don't know what the
  juice is up, but I think there's something wrong. Excuse my
  intruding&mdash;if it isn't so. I'll do anything you like to help you out of
  the scrape&mdash;if you're in one. That's my meaning, I believe. What can I
  do? I would do anything to help you."</p>

  <p>Her brow puckered, as she watched him make, with infinite emotion, this
  remarkable speech. <i>"You!"</i> she said. She was tumultuously weighing
  possibilities in her mind, and he had scarcely ceased when she had made her
  resolve.</p>

  <p>She stepped a pace forward. "You are a gentleman," she said.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mr. Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>"Can I trust you?"</p>

  <p>She did not wait for his assurance. "I must leave this hotel at once. Come
  here."</p>

  <p>She took his arm and led him to the window.</p>

  <p>"You can just see the gate. It is still open. Through that are our
  bicycles. Go down, get them out, and I will come down to you. Dare you?</p>

  <p>"Get your bicycle out in the road?"</p>

  <p>"Both. Mine alone is no good. At once. Dare you?"</p>

  <p>"Which way?"</p>

  <p>"Go out by the front door and round. I will follow in one minute."</p>

  <p>"Right!" said Mr. Hoopdriver, and went.</p>

  <p>He had to get those bicycles. Had he been told to go out and kill Bechamel
  he would have done it. His head was a MaeIstrom now. He walked out of the
  hotel, along the front, and into the big, blackshadowed coach yard. He looked
  round. There were no bicycles visible. Then a man emerged from the dark, a
  short man in a short, black, shiny jacket. Hoopdriver was caught. He made no
  attempt to turn and run for it. "I've been giving your machines a wipe over,
  sir," said the man, recognising the suit, and touching his cap. Hoopdriver's
  intelligence now was a soaring eagle; he swooped on the situation at once.
  "That's right," he said, and added, before the pause became marked, "Where is
  mine? I want to look at the chain."</p>

  <p>The man led him into an open shed, and went fumbling for a lantern.
  Hoopdriver moved the lady's machine out of his way to the door, and then laid
  hands on the man's machine and wheeled it out of the shed into the yard. The
  gate stood open and beyond was the pale road and a clump of trees black in
  the twilight. He stooped and examined the chain with trembling fingers. How
  was it to be done? Something behind the gate seemed to flutter. The man must
  be got rid of anyhow.</p>

  <p>"I say," said Hoopdriver, with an inspiration, "can you get me a
  screwdriver?"</p>

  <p>The man simply walked across the shed, opened and shut a box, and came up
  to the kneeling Hoopdriver with a screwdriver in his hand. Hoopdriver felt
  himself a lost man. He took the screwdriver with a tepid "Thanks," and
  incontinently had another inspiration.</p>

  <p>"I say," he said again.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"This is miles too big."</p>

  <p>The man lit the lantern, brought it up to Hoopdriver and put it down on
  the ground. "Want a smaller screwdriver?" he said.</p>

  <p>Hoopdriver had his handkerchief out and sneezed a prompt <i>atichew</i>.
  It is the orthodox thing when you wish to avoid recognition. "As small as you
  have," he said, out of his pocket handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"I ain't got none smaller than that," said the ostler.</p>

  <p>"Won't do, really," said Hoopdriver, still wallowing in his
  handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"I'll see wot they got in the 'ouse, if you like, sir," said the man. "If
  you would," said Hoopdriver. And as the man's heavily nailed boots went
  clattering down the yard, Hoopdriver stood up, took a noiseless step to the
  lady's machine, laid trembling hands on its handle and saddle, and prepared
  for a rush.</p>

  <p>The scullery door opened momentarily and sent a beam of warm, yellow light
  up the road, shut again behind the man, and forthwith Hoopdriver rushed the
  machines towards the gate. A dark grey form came fluttering to meet him.
  "Give me this," she said, "and bring yours."</p>

  <p>He passed the thing to her, touched her hand in the darkness, ran back,
  seized Bechamel's machine, and followed.</p>

  <p>The yellow light of the scullery door suddenly flashed upon the cobbles
  again. It was too late now to do anything but escape. He heard the ostler
  shout behind him, and came into the road. She was up and dim already. He got
  into the saddle without a blunder. In a moment the ostler was in the gateway
  with a full-throated "<i>Hi!</i> sir! That ain't allowed;" and Hoopdriver was
  overtaking the Young Lady in Grey. For some moments the earth seemed alive
  with shouts of, "Stop 'em!" and the shadows with ambuscades of police. The
  road swept round, and they were riding out of sight of the hotel, and behind
  dark hedges, side by side.</p>

  <p>She was weeping with excitement as he overtook her. "Brave," she said,
  "brave!" and he ceased to feel like a hunted thief. He looked over his
  shoulder and about him, and saw that they were already out of
  Bognor&mdash;for the Vicuna stands at the very westernmost extremity of the
  sea front&mdash;and riding on a fair wide road.</p><br>

  </div>

  <p class="caption">The ostler rushed violently down the road.</p><br>

  <p>The ostler (being a fool) rushed violently down the road vociferating
  after them. Then he returned panting to the Vicuna Hotel, and finding a group
  of men outside the entrance, who wanted to know what was UP, stopped to give
  them the cream of the adventure. That gave the fugitives five minutes. Then
  pushing breathlessly into the bar, he had to make it clear to the barmaid
  what the matter was, and the 'gov'nor' being out , they spent some more
  precious time wondering 'what&mdash;<i>ever</i>' was to be done! in which the
  two customers returning from outside joined with animation. There were also
  moral remarks and other irrelevant contributions. There were conflicting
  ideas of telling the police and pursuing the flying couple on a horse. That
  made ten minutes. Then Stephen, the waiter, who had shown Hoopdriver up, came
  down and lit wonderful lights and started quite a fresh discussion by the
  simple question <i>"Which?"</i> That turned ten minutes into a quarter of an
  hour. And in the midst of this discussion, making a sudden and awestricken
  silence, appeared Bechamel in the hall beyond the bar, walked with a resolute
  air to the foot of the staircase, and passed out of sight. You conceive the
  backward pitch of that exceptionally shaped cranium? Incredulous eyes stared
  into one another's in the bar, as his paces, muffled by the stair carpet,
  went up to the landing, turned, reached the passage and walked into the
  dining-room overhead.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't that one at all, miss," said the ostler,"I'd <i>swear</i>"</p>

  <p>"Well, that's Mr. Beaumont," said the barmaid, "&mdash;anyhow."</p>

  <p>Their conversation hung comatose in the air, switched up by Bechamel. They
  listened together. His feet stopped. Turned. Went out of the diningroom. Down
  the passage to the bedroom. Stopped again.</p>

  <p>"Poor chap!" said the barmaid. "She's a wicked woman!"</p>

  <p>"Sssh!" said Stephen.</p>

  <p>After a pause Bechamel went back to the dining-room. They heard a chair
  creak under him. Interlude of conversational eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"I'm going up," said Stephen, "to break the melancholy news to him."</p>

  <p>Bechamel looked up from a week-old newspaper as, without knocking, Stephen
  entered. Bechamel's face suggested a different expectation. "Beg pardon,
  sir," said Stephen, with a diplomatic cough.</p>

  <p>"Well?" said Bechamel, wondering suddenly if Jessie had kept some of her
  threats. If so, he was in for an explanation. But he had it ready. She was a
  monomaniac. "Leave me alone with her," he would say; "I know how to calm
  her."</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Beaumont," said Stephen.</p>

  <p><i>"Well?"</i></p>

  <p>"Has gone."</p>

  <p>He rose with a fine surprise. "Gone!" he said with a half laugh.</p>

  <p>"Gone, sir. On her bicycle."</p>

  <p>"On her bicycle! Why?"</p>

  <p>"She went, sir, with Another Gentleman."</p>

  <p>This time Bechamel was really startled. "An&mdash;other Gentlemen!
  <i>Who?</i>"</p>

  <p>"Another gentleman in brown, sir. Went into the yard, sir, got out the two
  bicycles, sir, and went off, sir&mdash;about twenty minutes ago."</p>

  <p>Bechamel stood with his eyes round and his knuckle on his hips. Stephen,
  watching him with immense enjoyment, speculated whether this abandoned
  husband would weep or curse, or rush off at once in furious pursuit. But as
  yet he seemed merely stunned.</p>

  <p>"Brown clothes?" he said. "And fairish?"</p>

  <p>"A little like yourself, sir&mdash;in the dark. The ostler, sir, Jim
  Duke&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bechamel laughed awry. Then, with infinite fervour, he said&mdash;But let
  us put in blank cartridge&mdash;he said, "&mdash;-&mdash;-!"</p>

  <p>"I might have thought!"</p>

  <p>He flung himself into the armchair.</p>

  <p>"Damn her," said Bechamel, for all the world like a common man. "I'll
  chuck this infernal business! They've gone, eigh?"</p>

  <p>"Yessir."</p>

  <p>Well, let 'em <i>go</i>," said Bechamel, making a memorable saying. "Let
  'em GO. Who cares? And I wish him luck. And bring me some Bourbon as fast as
  you can, there's a good chap. I'll take that, and then I'll have another look
  round Bognor before I turn in."</p>

  <p>Stephen was too surprised to say anything but "Bourbon, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Go on," said Bechamel. "Damn you!"</p>

  <p>Stephen's sympathies changed at once. "Yessir," he murmured, fumbling for
  the door handle, and left the room, marvelling. Bechamel, having in this way
  satisfied his sense of appearances, and comported himself as a Pagan should,
  so soon as the waiter's footsteps had passed, vented the cream of his
  feelings in a stream of blasphemous indecency. Whether his wife or HER
  stepmother had sent the detective, SHE had evidently gone off with him, and
  that little business was over. And he was here, stranded and sold, an ass,
  and as it were, the son of many generations of asses. And his only ray of
  hope was that it seemed more probable, after all, that the girl had escaped
  through her stepmother. In which case the business might be hushed up yet,
  and the evil hour of explanation with his wife indefinitely postponed. Then
  abruptly the image of that lithe figure in grey knickerbockers went frisking
  across his mind again, and he reverted to his blasphemies. He started up in a
  gusty frenzy with a vague idea of pursuit, and incontinently sat down again
  with a concussion that stirred the bar below to its depths. He banged the
  arms of the chair with his fist, and swore again. "Of all the accursed fools
  that were ever spawned," he was chanting, "I, Bechamel&mdash;" when with an
  abrupt tap and prompt opening of the door, Stephen entered with the
  Bourbon.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="chap16"
     name="chap16">XVI. &mdash; THE MOONLIGHT RIDE</a></h2>

  <h3>§ XXIV</h3>

  <p class="first">And so the twenty minutes' law passed into an infinity. We
  leave the wicked Bechamel clothing himself with cursing as with a
  garment,&mdash;the wretched creature has already sufficiently sullied our
  modest but truthful pages,&mdash;we leave the eager little group in the bar
  of the Vicuna Hotel, we leave all Bognor as we have left all Chichester and
  Midhurst and Haslemere and Guildford and Ripley and Putney, and follow this
  dear fool of a Hoopdriver of ours and his Young Lady in Grey out upon the
  moonlight road. How they rode! How their hearts beat together and their
  breath came fast, and how every shadow was anticipation and every noise
  pursuit! For all that flight Mr. Hoopdriver was in the world of Romance. Had
  a policeman intervened because their lamps were not lit, Hoopdriver had cut
  him down and ridden on, after the fashion of a hero born. Had Bechamel arisen
  in the way with rapiers for a duel, Hoopdriver had fought as one to whom
  Agincourt was a reality and drapery a dream. It was Rescue, Elopement, Glory!
  And she by the side of him! He had seen her face in shadow, with the morning
  sunlight tangled in her hair, he had seen her sympathetic with that warm
  light in her face, he had seen her troubled and her eyes bright with tears.
  But what light is there lighting a face like hers, to compare with the soft
  glamour of the midsummer moon?</p>

  <p>The road turned northward, going round through the outskirts of Bognor, in
  one place dark and heavy under a thick growth of trees, then amidst villas
  again, some warm and lamplit, some white and sleeping in the moonlight; then
  between hedges, over which they saw broad wan meadows shrouded in a low-lying
  mist. They scarcely heeded whither they rode at first, being only anxious to
  get away, turning once westward when the spire of Chichester cathedral rose
  suddenly near them out of the dewy night, pale and intricate and high. They
  rode, speaking little, just a rare word now and then, at a turning, at a
  footfall, at a roughness in the road.</p>

  <p>She seemed to be too intent upon escape to give much thought to him, but
  after the first tumult of the adventure, as flight passed into mere steady
  ridin@@ his mind became an enormous appreciation of the position. The night
  was a warm white silence save for the subtile running of their chains. He
  looked sideways at her as she sat beside him with her ankles gracefully
  ruling the treadles. Now the road turned westward, and she was a dark grey
  outline against the shimmer of the moon; and now they faced northwards, and
  the soft cold light passed caressingly over her hair and touched her brow and
  cheek.</p>

  <p>There is a magic quality in moonshine; it touches all that is sweet and
  beautiful, and the rest of the night is hidden. It has created the fairies,
  whom the sunlight kills, and fairyland rises again in our hearts at the sight
  of it, the voices of the filmy route, and their faint, soul-piercing
  melodies. By the moonlight every man, dull clod though he be by day, tastes
  something of Endymion, takes something of the youth and strength of
  Enidymion, and sees the dear white goddess shining at him from his Lady's
  eyes. The firm substantial daylight things become ghostly and elusive, the
  hills beyond are a sea of unsubstantial texture, the world a visible spirit,
  the spiritual within us rises out of its darkness, loses something of its
  weight and body, and swims up towards heaven. This road that was a mere
  rutted white dust, hot underfoot, blinding to the eye, is now a soft grey
  silence, with the glitter of a crystal grain set starlike in its silver here
  and there. Overhead, riding serenely through the spacious blue, is the mother
  of the silence, she who has spiritualised the world, alone save for two
  attendant steady shining stars. And in silence under her benign influence,
  under the benediction of her light, rode our two wanderers side by side
  through the transfigured and transfiguring night.</p>

  <p>Nowhere was the moon shining quite so brightly as in Mr. Hoopdriver's
  skull. At the turnings of the road he made his decisions with an air of
  profound promptitude (and quite haphazard). "The Right," he would say. Or
  again "The Left," as one who knew. So it was that in the space of an hour
  they came abruptly down a little lane, full tilt upon the sea. Grey beach to
  the right of them and to the left, and a little white cottage fast asleep
  inland of a sleeping fishing-boat. "Hullo!" said Mr. Hoopdriver, sotto voce.
  They dismounted abruptly. Stunted oaks and thorns rose out of the haze of
  moonlight that was tangled in the hedge on either side.</p>

  <p>"You are safe," said Mr. Hoopdriver, sweeping off his cap with an air and
  bowing courtly.</p>

  <p>"Where are we?"</p>

  <p><i>"Safe."</i></p>

  <p>"But <i>where</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Chichester Harbour." He waved his arm seaward as though it was a
  goal.</p>

  <p>"Do you think they will follow us?"</p>

  <p>"We have turned and turned again."</p>

  <p>It seemed to Hoopdriver that he heard her sob. She stood dimly there,
  holding her machine, and he, holding his, could go no nearer to her to see if
  she sobbed for weeping or for want of breath. "What are we to do now?" her
  voice asked.</p>

  <p>"Are you tired?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I will do what has to be done."</p>

  <p>The two black figures in the broken light were silent for a space. "Do you
  know," she said, "I am not afraid of you. I am sure you are honest to me. And
  I do not even know your name!"</p>

  <p>He was taken with a sudden shame of his homely patronymic. "It's an ugly
  name," he said. "But you are right in trusting me. I would&mdash;I would do
  anything for you... This is nothing."</p>

  <p>She caught at her breath. She did not care to ask why. But compared with
  Bechamel!&mdash;"We take each other on trust," she said. "Do you want to know
  &mdash;how things are with me?"</p>

  <p>"That man," she went on, after the assent of his listening silence,
  "promised to help and protect me. I was unhappy at home&mdash;never mind why.
  A stepmother&mdash;Idle, unoccupied, hindered, cramped, that is enough,
  perhaps. Then he came into my life, and talked to me of art and literature,
  and set my brain on fire. I wanted to come out into the world, to be a human
  being&mdash;not a thing in a hutch. And he&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know," said Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>"And now here I am&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I will do anything," said Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>She thought. "You cannot imagine my stepmother. No! I could not describe
  her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am entirely at your service. I will help you with all my power."</p>

  <p>"I have lost an Illusion and found a Knight-errant." She spoke of Bechamel
  as the Illusion.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoopdriver felt flattered. But he had no adequate answer.</p>

  <p>"I'm thinking," he said, full of a rapture of protective responsibility, "
  what we had best be doing. You are tired, you know. And we can't wander all
  night&mdash;after the day we've had."</p>

  <p>"That was Chichester we were near?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"If," he meditated, with a tremble in his voice, "you would make <i>me</i>
  your brother, <i>Miss Beaumont</i>."</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"We could stop there together&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She took a minute to answer. "I am going to light these lamps," said
  Hoopdriver. He bent down to his own, and struck a match on his shoe. She
  looked at his face in its light, grave and intent. How could she ever have
  thought him common or absurd?</p>

  </div>

  <p class="caption">She looked at his face in its light.</p><br>

  <p>"But you must tell me your name&mdash;brother," she said,</p>

  <p>"Er&mdash;Carrington," said Mr. Hoopdriver, after a momentary pause. Who
  would be Hoopdriver on a night like this?</p>

  <p>"But the Christian name?"</p>

  <p>"Christian name? <i>My</i> Christian name. Well&mdash;Chris." He snapped
  his lamp and stood up. "If you will hold my machine, I will light yours," he
  said.</p>

  <p>She came round obediently and took his machine, and for a moment they
  stood face to face. "My name, brother Chris," she said, "is Jessie."</p>

  <p>He looked into her eyes, and his excitement seemed arrested.
  <i>"Jessie,"</i> he repeated slowly. The mute emotion of his face affected
  her strangely. She had to speak. "It's not such a very wonderful name, is
  it?" she said, with a laugh to break the intensity.</p>

  <p>He opened his mouth and shut it again, and, with a sudden wincing of his
  features, abruptly turned and bent down to open the lantern in front of her
  machine. She looked down at him, almost kneeling in front of her, with an
  unreasonable approbation in her eyes. It was, as I have indicated, the hour
  and season of the full moon.</p><br>

  <h3>§ XXV</h3>

  <p class="first">Mr. Hoopdriver conducted the rest of that night's journey
  with the same confident dignity as before, and it was chiefly by good luck
  and the fact that most roads about a town converge thereupon, that Chichester
  was at last attained. It seemed at first as though everyone had gone to bed,
  but the Red Hotel still glowed yellow and warm. It was the first time
  Hoopdriver bad dared the mysteries of a 'first-class' hotel.' But that night
  he was in the mood to dare anything.</p>

  <p>"So you found your Young Lady at last," said the ostler of the Red Hotel;
  for it chanced he was one of those of whom Hoopdriver had made inquiries in
  the afternoon.</p>

  <p>"Quite a misunderstanding," said Hoopdriver, with splendid readiness. "My
  sister had gone to Bognor But I brought her back here. I've took a fancy to
  this place. And the moonlight's simply dee-vine."</p>

  <p>"We've had supper, thenks, and we're tired," said Mr. Hoopdriver. "I
  suppose you won't take anything,&mdash;Jessie?"</p>

  <p>The glory of having her, even as a sister! and to call her Jessie like
  that! But he carried it off splendidly, as he felt himself bound to admit.
  "Good-night, Sis," he said, "and pleasant dreams. I'll just 'ave a look at
  this paper before I turn in." But this was living indeed! he told
  himself.</p>

  <p>So gallantly did Mr. Hoopdriver comport himself up to the very edge of the
  Most Wonderful Day of all. It had begun early, you will remember, with a
  vigil in a little sweetstuff shop next door to the Angel at Midhurst. But to
  think of all the things that had happened since then! He caught himself in
  the middle of a yawn, pulled out his watch, saw the time was halfpast eleven,
  and marched off, with a fine sense of heroism, bedward.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="chap17"
     name="chap17">XVII. &mdash; THE SURBITON INTERLUDE</a></h2>

  <h3>§ XXVI</h3>

  <p class="first">And here, thanks to the glorious institution of sleep, comes
  a break in the narrative again. These absurd young people are safely tucked
  away now, their heads full of glowing nonsense, indeed, but the course of
  events at any rate is safe from any fresh developments through their
  activities for the next eight hours or more. They are both sleeping healthily
  you will perhaps be astonished to hear. Here is the girl&mdash;what girls are
  coming to nowadays only Mrs. Lynn Linton can tell!&mdash;in company with an
  absolute stranger, of low extraction and uncertain accent, unchaperoned and
  unabashed; indeed, now she fancies she is safe, she is, if anything, a little
  proud of her own share in these transactions. Then this Mr. Hoopdriver of
  yours, roseate idiot that he is! is in illegal possession of a stolen
  bicycle, a stolen young lady, and two stolen names, established with them in
  an hotel that is quite beyond his means, and immensely proud of himself in a
  somnolent way for these incomparable follies. There are occasions when a
  moralising novelist can merely wring his hands and leave matters to take
  their course. For all Hoopdriver knows or cares he may be locked up the very
  first thing to-morrow morning for the rape of the cycle. Then in Bognor, let
  alone that melancholy vestige, Bechamel (with whom our dealings are, thank
  Goodness! over), there is a Coffee Tavern with a steak Mr. Hoopdriver
  ordered, done to a cinder long ago, his American-cloth parcel in a bedroom,
  and his own proper bicycle, by way of guarantee, carefully locked up in the
  hayloft. To-morrow he will be a Mystery, and they will be looking for his
  body along the sea front. And so far we have never given a glance at the
  desolate home in Surbiton, familiar to you no doubt through the medium of
  illustrated interviews, where the unhappy stepmother&mdash;</p>

  <p>That stepmother, it must be explained, is quite well known to you. That is
  a little surprise I have prepared for you. She is 'Thomas Plantagenet,' the
  gifted authoress of that witty and daring book, "A Soul Untrammelled," and
  quite an excellent woman in her way,&mdash;only it is such a crooked way. Her
  real name is Milton. She is a widow and a charming one, only ten years older
  than Jessie, and she is always careful to dedicate her more daring works to
  the 'sacred memory of my husband' to show that there's nothing personal, you
  know, in the matter. Considering her literary reputation (she was always
  speaking of herself as one I martyred for truth,' because the critics
  advertised her written indecorums in column long 'slates'),&mdash;considering
  her literary reputation, I say, she was one of the most respectable women it
  is possible to imagine. She furnished correctly, dressed correctly, had
  severe notions of whom she might meet, went to church, and even at times took
  the sacrament in some esoteric spirit. And Jessie she brought up so carefully
  that she never even let her read "A Soul Untrammelled." Which, therefore,
  naturally enough, Jessie did, and went on from that to a feast of advanced
  literature. Mrs. Milton not only brought up Jessie carefully, but very
  slowly, so that at seventeen she was still a clever schoolgirl (as you have
  seen her) and quite in the background of the little literary circle of
  unimportant celebrities which 'Thomas Plantagenet' adorned. Mrs. Milton knew
  Bechamel's reputation of being a dangerous man; but then bad men are not bad
  women, and she let him come to her house to show she was not afraid&mdash;she
  took no account of Jessie. When the elopement came, therefore, it was a
  double disappointment to her, for she perceived his hand by a kind of
  instinct. She did the correct thing. The correct thing, as you know, is to
  take hansom cabs, regardless of expense, and weep and say you do not know
  WHAT to do, round the circle of your confidential friends. She could not have
  ridden nor wept more had Jessie been her own daughter&mdash;she showed the
  properest spirit. And she not only showed it, but felt it.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Milton, as a successful little authoress and still more successful
  widow of thirty-two,&mdash;"Thomas Plantagenet is a charming woman," her
  reviewers used to write invariably, even if they spoke ill of
  her,&mdash;found the steady growth of Jessie into womanhood an unmitigated
  nuisance and had been willing enough to keep her in the background. And
  Jessie&mdash;who had started this intercourse at fourteen with abstract
  objections to stepmothers&mdash;had been active enough in resenting this.
  Increasing rivalry and antagonism had sprung up between them, until they
  could engender quite a vivid hatred from a dropped hairpin or the cutting of
  a book with a sharpened knife. There is very little deliberate wickedness in
  the world. The stupidity of our selfishness gives much the same results
  indeed, but in the ethical laboratory it shows a different nature. And when
  the disaster came, Mrs. Milton's remorse for their gradual loss of sympathy
  and her share in the losing of it, was genuine enough.</p>

  <p>You may imagine the comfort she got from her friends, and how West
  Kensington and Notting Hill and Hampstead, the literary suburbs, those decent
  penitentiaries of a once Bohemian calling, hummed with the business, Her
  'Men'&mdash;as a charming literary lady she had, of course, an organised
  corps&mdash;were immensely excited, and were sympathetic; helpfully
  energetic, suggestive, alert, as their ideals of their various dispositions
  required them to be. "Any news of Jessie?" was the pathetic opening of a
  dozen melancholy but interesting conversations. To her Men she was not
  perhaps so damp as she was to her women friends, but in a quiet way she was
  even more touching. For three days, Wednesday that is, Thursday, and Friday,
  nothing was heard of the fugitives. It was known that Jessie, wearing a
  patent costume with buttonup skirts, and mounted on a diamond frame safety
  with Dunlops, and a loofah covered saddle, had ridden forth early in the
  morning, taking with her about two pounds seven shillings in money, and a
  grey touring case packed, and there, save for a brief note to her
  stepmother,&mdash;a declaration of independence, it was said, an assertion of
  her Ego containing extensive and very annoying quotations from "A Soul
  Untrammelled," and giving no definite intimation of her plans&mdash;knowledge
  ceased. That note was shown to few, and then only in the strictest
  confidence.</p>

  <p>But on Friday evening late came a breathless Man Friend, Widgery, a
  correspondent of hers, who had heard of her trouble among the first. He had
  been touring in Sussex,&mdash;his knapsack was still on his back,&mdash;and
  he testified hurriedly that at a place called Midhurst, in the bar of an
  hotel called the Angel, he had heard from a barmaid a vivid account of a
  Young Lady in Grey. Descriptions tallied. But who was the man in brown?"The
  poor, misguided girl! I must go to her at once," she said, choking, and
  rising with her hand to her heart.</p>

  <p>"It's impossible to-night. There are no more trains. I looked on my
  way."</p>

  <p>"A mother's love," she said. "I bear her <i>that</i>."</p>

  <p>"I know you do." He spoke with feeling, for no one admired his photographs
  of scenery more than Mrs. Milton. "it's more than she deserves."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't speak unkindly of her! She has been misled."</p>

  <p>It was really very friendly of him. He declared he was only sorry his news
  ended there. Should he follow them, and bring her back? He had come to her
  because he knew of her anxiety. "It is <i>good</i> of you," she said, and
  quite instinctively took and pressed his hand. "And to think of that poor
  girl&mdash;tonight! It's dreadful." She looked into the fire that she had lit
  when he came in, the warm light fell upon her dark purple dress, and left her
  features in a warm shadow. She looked such a slight, frail thing to be
  troubled so. "We must follow her." Her resolution seemed magnificent. "I have
  no one to go with me."</p>

  <p>"He must marry her," said the man.</p>

  <p>"She has no friends. We have no one. After all&mdash;Two women.&mdash;So
  helpless."</p>

  <p>And this fair-haired little figure was the woman that people who knew her
  only from her books, called bold, prurient even! Simply because she was
  great-hearted&mdash;intellectual. He was overcome by the unspeakable pathos
  of her position.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Milton," he said. "Hetty!"</p>

  <p>She glanced at him. The overflow was imminent. "Not now," she said, "not
  now. I must find her first."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said with intense emotion. (He was one of those big, fat men who
  feel deeply.) "But let me help you. At least let me help you."</p>

    <p><a id="pic25"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>

         alt="'At least let me help you.'">
  </div>

  <p class="caption">"At least let me help you."</p><br>

  <p>"But can you spare time?" she said. "For <i>me</i>."</p>

  <p>"For you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But what can I do? what can <i>we</i> do?"</p>

  <p>"Go to Midhurst. Follow her on. Trace her. She was there on Thursday
  night, last night. She cycled out of the town. Courage!" he said. "We will
  save her yet!"</p>

  <p>She put out her hand and pressed his again.</p>

  <p>"Courage!" he repeated, finding it so well received.</p>

  <p>There were alarms and excursions without. She turned her back to the fire,
  and he sat down suddenly in the big armchair, which suited his dimensions
  admirably. Then the door opened, and the girl showed in Dangle, who looked
  curiously from one to the other. There was emotion here, he had heard the
  armchair creaking, and Mrs. Milton, whose face was flushed, displayed a
  suspicious alacrity to explain. "You, too," she said, "are one of my good
  friends. And we have news of her at last."</p>

  <p>It was decidedly an advantage to Widgery, but Dangle determined to show
  himself a man of resource. In the end he, too, was accepted for the Midhurst
  Expedition, to the intense disgust of Widgery; and young Phipps, a callow
  youth of few words, faultless collars, and fervent devotion, was also
  enrolled before the evening was out. They would scour the country, all three
  of them. She appeared to brighten up a little, but it was evident she was
  profoundly touched. She did not know what she had done to merit such friends.
  Her voice broke a little, she moved towards the door, and young Phipps, who
  was a youth of action rather than of words, sprang and opened it&mdash;proud
  to be first.</p>

  <p>"She is sorely troubled," said Dangle to Widgery. "We must do what we can
  for her."</p>

  <p>"She is a wonderful woman," said Dangle. "So subtle, so intricate, so many
  faceted. She feels this deeply."</p>

  <p>Young Phipps said nothing, but he felt the more.</p>

  <p>And yet they say the age of chivalry is dead!</p>

  <p>But this is only an Interlude, introduced to give our wanderers time to
  refresh themselves by good, honest sleeping. For the present, therefore, we
  will not concern ourselves with the starting of the Rescue Party, nor with
  Mrs. Milton's simple but becoming grey dress, with the healthy Widgery's
  Norfolk jacket and thick boots, with the slender Dangle's energetic bearing,
  nor with the wonderful chequerings that set off the legs of the golf-suited
  Phipps. They are after us. In a little while they will be upon us. You must
  imagine as you best can the competitive raidings at Midhurst of Widgery,
  Dangle, and Phipps. How Widgery was great at questions, and Dangle good at
  inference, and Phipps so conspicuously inferior in everything that he felt
  it, and sulked with Mrs. Milton most of the day, after the manner of your
  callow youth the whole world over. Mrs. Milton stopped at the Angel and was
  very sad and charming and intelligent, and Widgery paid the bill. in the
  afternoon of Saturday, Chichester was attained. But by that time our
  fugitives&mdash;As you shall immediately hear.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="chap18"
     name="chap18">XVIII. &mdash; THE AWAKENING OF MR. HOOPDRIVER</a></h2>

  <h3>§ XXVII</h3>

  <p class="first">Mr. Hoopdriver stirred on his pillow, opened his eyes, and,
  staring unmeaningly, yawned. The bedclothes were soft and pleasant. He turned
  the peaked nose that overrides the insufficient moustache, up to the ceiling,
  a pinkish projection over the billow of white. You might see it wrinkle as he
  yawned again, and then became quiet. So matters remained for a space. Very
  slowly recollection returned to him. Then a shock of indeterminate brown hair
  appeared, and first one watery grey eye a-wondering, and then two; the bed
  upheaved, and you had him, his thin neck projecting abruptly from the clothes
  he held about him, his face staring about the room. He held the clothes about
  him, I hope I may explain, because his night-shirt was at Bognor in an
  American-cloth packet, derelict. He yawned a third time, rubbed his eyes,
  smacked his lips. He was recalling almost everything now. The pursuit, the
  hotel, the tremulous daring of his entry, the swift adventure of the inn
  yard, the moonlight&mdash;Abruptly he threw the clothes back and rose into a
  sitting position on the edge of the bed. Without was the noise of shutters
  being unfastened and doors unlocked, and the passing of hoofs and wheels in
  the street. He looked at his watch. Half-past six. He surveyed the sumptuous
  room again.</p>

  <p>"Lord!" said Mr. Hoopdriver. "It wasn't a dream, after all."</p>

  <p>"I wonder what they charge for these Juiced rooms!" said Mr. Hoopdriver,
  nursing one rosy foot.</p>

  <p>He became meditative, tugging at his insufficient moustache. Suddenly he
  gave vent to a noiseless laugh. "What a rush it was! Rushed in and off with
  his girl right under his nose. Planned it well too. Talk of highway robbery!
  Talk of brigands Up and off! How juiced <i>sold</i> he must be feeling It was
  a shave too&mdash;in the coach yard!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly he became silent. Abruptly his eyebrows rose and his jaw fell. "I
  sa-a-ay!" said Mr. Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>He had never thought of it before. Perhaps you will understand the whirl
  he had been in overnight. But one sees things clearer in the daylight. "I'm
  hanged if I haven't been and stolen a blessed bicycle."</p>

  <p>"Who cares?" said Mr. Hoopdriver, presently, and his face supplied the
  answer.</p>

  <p>Then he thought of the Young Lady in Grey again, and tried to put a more
  heroic complexion on the business. But of an early morning, on an empty
  stomach (as with characteristic coarseness, medical men put it) heroics are
  of a more difficult growth than by moonlight. Everything had seemed
  exceptionally fine and brilliant, but quite natural, the evening before.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoopdriver reached out his hand, took his Norfolk jacket, laid it over
  his knees, and took out the money from the little ticket pocket. " Fourteen
  and six-half," he said, holding the coins in his left hand and stroking his
  chin with his right. He verified, by patting, the presence of a pocketbook in
  the breast pocket. "Five, fourteen, six-half," said Mr. Hoopdriver.
  "Left."</p>

  <p>With the Norfolk jacket still on his knees, he plunged into another silent
  meditation. "That wouldn't matter," he said. "It's the bike's the bother.</p>

  <p>"No good going back to Bognor.</p>

  <p>"Might send it back by carrier, of course. Thanking him for the loan.
  Having no further use&mdash;" Mr. Hoopdriver chuckled and lapsed into the
  silent concoction of a delightfully impudent letter. "Mr. J. Hoopdriver
  presents his compliments." But the grave note reasserted itself.</p>

  <p>"Might trundle back there in an hour, of course, and exchange them.
  <i>My</i> old crock's so blessed shabby. He's sure to be spiteful too. Have
  me run in, perhaps. Then she'd be in just the same old fix, only worse. You
  see, I'm her Knight-errant. It complicates things so."</p>

  <p>His eye, wandering loosely, rested on the sponge bath. "What the juice do
  they want with cream-pans in a bedroom?" said Mr. Hoopdriver, <i>en
  passant</i>.</p>

    <p><a id="pic26"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>
  <br>

  </div>

  <p class="caption">"What the juice do they want with cream-pans in a
  bedroom?"</p><br>

  <p>"Best thing we can do is to set out of here as soon as possible, anyhow. I
  suppose she'll go home to her friends. That bicycle is a juicy nuisance,
  anyhow. Juicy nuisance!"</p>

  <p>He jumped to his feet with a sudden awakening of energy, to proceed with
  his toilet. Then with a certain horror he remembered that the simple
  necessaries of that process were at Bognor!"Lord!" he remarked, and whistled
  silently for a space. "Rummy go! profit and loss; profit, one sister with
  bicycle complete, wot offers?&mdash;cheap for tooth and 'air brush, vests,
  night-shirt, stockings, and sundries.</p>

  <p>"Make the best of it," and presently, when it came to hair-brushing, he
  had to smooth his troubled locks with his hands. It was a poor result. "Sneak
  out and get a shave, I suppose, and buy a brush and so on. Chink again! Beard
  don't show much."</p>

  <p>He ran his hand over his chin, looked at himself steadfastly for some
  time, and curled his insufficient moustache up with some care. Then he fell
  a-meditating on his beauty. He considered himself, three-quarter face, left
  and right. An expression of distaste crept over his features. "Looking won't
  alter it, Hoopdriver," he remarked. "You're a weedy customer, my man.
  Shoulders narrow. Skimpy, anyhow."</p>

  <p>He put his knuckles on the toilet table and regarded himself with his chin
  lifted in the air. "Good Lord!" he said. "<i>What</i> a neck! Wonder why I
  got such a thundering lump there."</p>

  <p>He sat down on the bed, his eye still on the glass. "If I'd been exercised
  properly, if I'd been fed reasonable, if I hadn't been shoved out of a silly
  school into a silly shop&mdash;But there! the old folks didn't know no
  better. The schoolmaster ought to have. But he didn't, poor old fool!
  &mdash;Still, when it comes to meeting a girl like this&mdash;It's
  <i>'ard</i>.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what Adam'd think of me&mdash;as a specimen. Civilisation, eigh?
  Heir of the ages! I'm nothing. I know nothing. I can't do anything
  &mdash;sketch a bit. Why wasn't I made an artist?</p>

  <p>"Beastly cheap, after all, this suit does look, in the sunshine."</p>

  <p>"No good, Hoopdriver. Anyhow, you don't tell yourself any lies about it.
  Lovers ain't your game,&mdash;anyway. But there's other things yet. You can
  help the young lady, and you will&mdash;I suppose she'll be going home
  &mdash;And that business of the bicycle's to see to, too, my man.
  <i>Forward</i>, Hoopdriver! If you ain't a beauty, that's no reason why you
  should stop and be copped, is it?"</p>

  <p>And having got back in this way to a gloomy kind of self-satisfaction, he
  had another attempt at his hair preparatory to leaving his room and hurrying
  on breakfast, for an early departure. While breakfast was preparing he
  wandered out into South Street and refurnished himself with the elements of
  luggage again. "No expense to be spared," he murmured, disgorging the half-
  sovereign.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="chap19"
     name="chap19">XIX. &mdash; THE DEPARTURE FROM CHICHESTER</a></h2>

  <h3>§ XXVIII</h3>

  <p class="first">He caused his 'sister' to be called repeatedly, and when she
  came down, explained with a humorous smile his legal relationship to the
  bicycle in the yard. "Might be disagreeable, y' know." His anxiety was
  obvious enough. "Very well," she said (quite friendly); "hurry breakfast, and
  we'll ride out. I want to talk things over with you." The girl seemed more
  beautiful than ever after the night's sleep; her hair in comely dark waves
  from her forehead, her ungauntleted finger-tips pink and cool. And how
  decided she was! Breakfast was a nervous ceremony, conversation fraternal but
  thin; the waiter overawed him, and he was cowed by a multiplicity of forks.
  But she called him "Chris." They discussed their route over his sixpenny
  county map for the sake of talking, but avoided a decision in the presence of
  the attendant. The five-pound note was changed for the bill, and through
  Hoopdriver's determination to be quite the gentleman, the waiter and
  chambermaid got half a crown each and the ostler a florin. "'Olidays," said
  the ostler to himself, without gratitude. The public mounting of the bicycles
  in the street was a moment of trepidation. A policeman actually stopped and
  watched them from the opposite kerb. Suppose him to come across and ask: "Is
  that your bicycle, sir?" Fight? Or drop it and run? It was a time of
  bewildering apprehension, too, going through the streets of the town, so that
  a milk cart barely escaped destruction under Mr. Hoopdriver's chancy wheel.
  That recalled him to a sense of erratic steering, and he pulled himself
  together. In the lanes he breathed freer, and a less formal conversation
  presently began.</p>

  <p>"You've ridden out of Chichester in a great hurry," said Jessie.</p>

  <p>"Well, the fact of it is, I'm worried, just a little bit. About this
  machine."</p>

  <p>"Of course," she said. "I had forgotten that. But where are we going?"</p>

  <p>"Jest a turning or two more, if you don't mind," said Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>"Jest a mile or so. I have to think of you, you know. I should feel more
  easy. If we was locked up, you know&mdash;Not that I should mind on my own
  account&mdash;"</p>

  <p>They rode with a streaky, grey sea coming and going on their left hand.
  Every mile they put between themselves and Chichester Mr. Hoopdriver felt a
  little less conscience-stricken, and a little more of the gallant desperado.
  Here he was riding on a splendid machine with a Slap-up girl beside him. What
  would they think of it in the Emporium if any of them were to see him? He
  imagined in detail the astonishment of Miss Isaacs and of Miss Howe. "Why!
  It's Mr. Hoopdriver," Miss Isaacs would say. "Never!" emphatically from Miss
  Howe. Then he played with Briggs, and then tried the 'G.V.' in a shay. "Fancy
  introducing 'em to her&mdash;My sister pro tem." He was her brother Chris
  &mdash;Chris what?&mdash;Confound it! Harringon, Hartington&mdash;something
  like that. Have to keep off that topic until he could remember. Wish he'd
  told her the truth now&mdash;almost. He glanced at her. She was riding with
  her eyes straight ahead of her. Thinking. A little perplexed, perhaps, she
  seemed. He noticed how well she rode and that she rode with her lips closed
  &mdash;a thing he could never manage.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoopdriver's mind came round to the future. What was she going to do?
  What were they both going to do? His thoughts took a graver colour. He had
  rescued her. This was fine, manly rescue work he was engaged upon. She ought
  to go home, in spite of that stepmother. He must insist gravely but firmly
  upon that. She was the spirited sort, of course, but still&mdash;Wonder if
  she had any money? Wonder what the second-class fare from Havant to London
  is? Of course he would have to pay that&mdash;it was the regular thing, he
  being a gentleman. Then should he take her home? He began to rough in a
  moving sketch of the return. The stepmother, repentant of her indescribable
  cruelties, would be present,&mdash;even these rich people have their
  troubles,&mdash;probably an uncle or two. The footman would announce,
  Mr.&mdash;(bother that name!) and Miss Milton. Then two women weeping
  together, and a knightly figure in the background dressed in a handsome
  Norfolk jacket, still conspicuously new. He would conceal his feeling until
  the very end. Then, leaving, he would pause in the doorway in such an
  attitude as Mr. George Alexander might assume, and say, slowly and
  dwindlingly: "Be kind to her&mdash;BE kind to her," and so depart,
  heartbroken to the meanest intelligence. But that was a matter for the
  future. He would have to begin discussing the return soon. There was no
  traffic along the road, and he came up beside her (he had fallen behind in
  his musing). She began to talk. "Mr. Denison," she began, and then,
  doubtfully, "That is your name? I'm very stupid&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is," said Mr. Hoopdriver. (Denison, was it? Denison, Denison, Denison.
  What was she saying?)</p>

  <p>"I wonder how far you are willing to help me?" Confoundedly hard to answer
  a question like that on the spur of the moment, without steering wildly. "You
  may rely&mdash;" said Mr. Hoopdriver, recovering from a violent wabble. "I
  can assure you&mdash;I want to help you very much. Don't consider me at all.
  Leastways, consider me entirely at your service." (Nuisance not to be able to
  say this kind of thing right.)</p>

  <p>"You see, I am so awkwardly situated."</p>

  <p>"If I can only help you&mdash;you will make me very happy&mdash;" There
  was a pause. Round a bend in the road they came upon a grassy space between
  hedge and road, set with yarrow and meadowsweet, where a felled tree lay
  among the green. There she dismounted, and propping her machine against a
  stone, sat down. "Here, we can talk," she said.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mr. Hoopdriver, expectant.</p>

  <p>She answered after a little while, sitting, elbow on knee, with her chin
  in her hand, and looking straight in front of her. "I don't know&mdash;I am
  resolved to Live my Own Life."</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Mr. Hoopdriver. "Naturally."</p>

  <p>"I want to Live, and I want to see what life means. I want to learn.
  Everyone is hurrying me, everything is hurrying me; I want time to
  think."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoopdriver was puzzled, but admiring. It was wonderful how clear and
  ready her words were. But then one might speak well with a throat and lips
  like that. He knew he was inadequate, but he tried to meet the occasion. "If
  you let them rush you into anything you might repent of, of course you'd be
  very silly."</p>

  <p>"Don't <i>you</i> want to learn?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I was wondering only this morning," he began, and stopped.</p>

  <p>She was too intent upon her own thoughts to notice this insufficiency. "I
  find myself in life, and it terrifies me. I seem to be like a little speck,
  whirling on a wheel, suddenly caught up. 'What am I here for?' I ask. Simply
  to be here at a time&mdash;I asked it a week ago, I asked it yesterday, and I
  ask it to-day. And little things happen and the days pass. My stepmother
  takes me shopping, people come to tea, there is a new play to pass the time,
  or a concert, or a novel. The wheels of the world go on turning, turning. It
  is horrible. I want to do a miracle like Joshua and stop the whirl until I
  have fought it out. At home&mdash;It's impossible."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoopdriver stroked his moustache. "It IS so," he said in a meditative
  tone. "Things <i>will</i> go on," he said. The faint breath of summer stirred
  the trees, and a bunch of dandelion puff lifted among the meadowsweet and
  struck and broke into a dozen separate threads against his knee. They flew on
  apart, and sank, as the breeze fell, among the grass: some to germinate, some
  to perish. His eye followed them until they had vanished.</p>

  <p>"I can't go back to Surbiton," said the Young Lady in Grey.</p>

  <p><i>"Eigh?"</i> said Mr. Hoopdriver, catching at his moustache. This was an
  unexpected development.</p>

  <p>"I want to write, you see," said the Young Lady in Grey, "to write Books
  and alter things. To do Good. I want to lead a Free Life and Own myself. I
  can't go back. I want to obtain a position as a journalist. I have been told
  &mdash;But I know no one to help me at once. No one that I could go to. There
  is one person&mdash;She was a mistress at my school. If I could write to her
  &mdash;But then, how could I get her answer?"</p>

  <p>"H'mp," said Mr. Hoopdriver, very grave.</p>

  <p>"I can't trouble you much more. You have come&mdash;you have risked
  things&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That don't count," said Mr. Hoopdriver. "It's double pay to let me do it,
  so to speak."</p>

  <p>"It is good of you to say that. Surbiton is so Conventional. I am resolved
  to be Unconventional&mdash;at any cost. But we are so hampered. If I could
  only burgeon out of all that hinders me! I want to struggle, to take my place
  in the world. I want to be my own mistress, to shape my own career. But my
  stepmother objects so. She does as she likes herself, and is strict with me
  to ease her conscience. And if I go back now, go back owning myself
  beaten&mdash;" She left the rest to his imagination.</p>

  <p>"I see that," agreed Mr. Hoopdriver. He <i>must</i> help her. Within his
  skull he was doing some intricate arithmetic with five pounds six and
  twopence. In some vague way he inferred from all this that Jessie was trying
  to escape from an undesirable marriage, but was saying these things out of
  modesty. His circle of ideas was so limited.</p>

  <p>"You know, Mr.&mdash;I've forgotten your name again."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoopdriver seemed lost in abstraction. "You can't go back of course,
  quite like that," he said thoughtfully. His ears waxed suddenly red and his
  cheeks flushed.</p>

  <p>"But what IS your name?"</p>

  <p>"Name!" said Mr. Hoopdriver. "Why!&mdash;Benson, of course."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Benson&mdash;yes it's really very stupid of me. But I can never
  remember names. I must make a note on my cuff." She clicked a little silver
  pencil and wrote the name down. "If I could write to my friend. I believe she
  would be able to help me to an independent life. I could write to
  her&mdash;or telegraph. Write, I think. I could scarcely explain in a
  telegram. I know she would help me."</p>

  <p>Clearly there was only one course open to a gentleman under the
  circumstances. "In that case," said Mr. Hoopdriver, "if you don't mind
  trusting yourself to a stranger, we might continue as we are perhaps. For a
  day or so. Until you heard." (Suppose thirty shillings a day, that gives four
  days, say four thirties is hun' and twenty, six quid,&mdash;well, three days,
  say; four ten.)</p>

  <p>"You are very good to me."</p>

  <p>His expression was eloquent.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then, and thank you. It's wonderful&mdash;it's more than I
  deserve that you&mdash;" She dropped the theme abruptly. "What was our bill
  at Chichester?"</p>

  <p>"Eigh?" said Mr. Hoopdriver, feigning a certain stupidity. There was a
  brief discussion. Secretly he was delighted at her insistence in paying. She
  carried her point. Their talk came round to their immediate plans for the
  day. They decided to ride easily, through Havant, and stop, perhaps, at
  Fareham or Southampton. For the previous day had tried them both. Holding the
  map extended on his knee, Mr. Hoopdriver's eye fell by chance on the bicycle
  at his feet. "That bicycle," he remarked, quite irrelevantly, "wouldn't look
  the same machine if I got a big, double Elarum instead of that little
  bell."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Jest a thought." A pause.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then,&mdash;Havant and lunch," said Jessie, rising.</p>

  <p>"I wish, somehow, we could have managed it without stealing that machine,"
  said Hoopdriver. "Because it IS stealing it, you know, come to think of
  it."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense. If Mr. Bechamel troubles you&mdash;I will tell the whole
  world&mdash;if need be."</p>

  <p>"I believe you would," said Mr. Hoopdriver, admiring her. "You're plucky
  enough&mdash;goodness knows."</p>

  <p>Discovering suddenly that she was standing, he, too, rose and picked up
  her machine. She took it and wheeled it into the road. Then he took his own.
  He paused, regarding it. "I say!"said he. "How'd this bike look, now, if it
  was enamelled grey?" She looked over her shoulder at his grave face. "Why try
  and hide it in that way?"</p>

  <p>"It was jest a passing thought," said Mr. Hoopdriver, airily. "Didn't
  <i>mean</i> anything, you know."</p>

  <p>As they were riding on to Havant it occurred to Mr. Hoopdriver in a
  transitory manner that the interview had been quite other than his
  expectation. But that was the way with everything in Mr. Hoopdriver's
  experience. And though his Wisdom looked grave within him, and Caution was
  chinking coins, and an ancient prejudice in favour of Property shook her
  head, something else was there too, shouting in his mind to drown all these
  saner considerations, the intoxicating thought of riding beside Her all
  to-day, all to-morrow, perhaps for other days after that. Of talking to her
  familiarly, being brother of all her slender strength and freshness, of
  having a golden, real, and wonderful time beyond all his imaginings. His old
  familiar fancyings gave place to anticipations as impalpable and fluctuating
  and beautiful as the sunset of a summer day.</p>

  <p>At Havant he took an opportunity to purchase, at small hairdresser's in
  the main street, a toothbrush,pair of nail scissors, and a little bottle of
  stuff to darken the moustache, an article the shopman introduced to his
  attention, recommended highly, and sold in the excitement of the
  occasion.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="chap20"
     name="chap20">XX. &mdash; THE UNEXPECTED ANECDOTE OF THE LION</a></h2>

  <h3>§ XXIX</h3>

  <p class="first">They rode on to Cosham and lunched lightly but expensively
  there. Jessie went out and posted her letter to her school friend. Then the
  green height of Portsdown Hill tempted them, and leaving their machines in
  the village they clambered up the slope to the silent red-brick fort that
  crowned it. Thence they had a view of Portsmouth and its cluster of sister
  towns, the crowded narrows of the harbour, the Solent and the Isle of Wight
  like a blue cloud through the hot haze. Jessie by some miracle had become a
  skirted woman in the Cosham inn. Mr. Hoopdriver lounged gracefully on the
  turf, smoked a Red Herring cigarette, and lazily regarded the fortified towns
  that spread like a map away there, the inner line of defence like toy
  fortifications, a mile off perhaps; and beyond that a few little fields and
  then the beginnings of Landport suburb and the smoky cluster of the
  multitudinous houses. To the right at the head of the harbour shallows the
  town of Porchester rose among the trees. Mr. Hoopdriver's anxiety receded to
  some remote corner of his brain and that florid half-voluntary imagination of
  his shared the stage with the image of Jessie. He began to speculate on the
  impression he was creating. He took stock of his suit in a more optimistic
  spirit, and reviewed, with some complacency, his actions for the last four
  and twenty hours. Then he was dashed at the thought of her infinite
  perfections.</p>

  <p>She had been observing him quietly, rather more closely during the last
  hour or so. She did not look at him directly because he seemed always looking
  at her. Her own troubles had quieted down a little, and her curiosity about
  the chivalrous, worshipping, but singular gentleman in brown, was awakening.
  She had recalled, too, the curious incident of their first encounter. She
  found him hard to explain to herself. You must understand that her knowledge
  of the world was rather less than nothing, having been obtained entirely from
  books. You must not take a certain ignorance for foolishness.</p>

  <p>She had begun with a few experiments. He did not know French except
  'sivver play,' a phrase he seemed to regard as a very good light table joke
  in itself. His English was uncertain, but not such as books informed her
  distinguished the lower classes. His manners seemed to her good on the whole,
  but a trifle over-respectful and out of fashion. He called her I Madam' once.
  He seemed a person of means and leisure, but he knew nothing of recent
  concerts, theatres, or books. How did he spend his time? He was certainly
  chivalrous, and a trifle simpleminded. She fancied (so much is there in a
  change of costume) that she had never met with such a man before. What
  <i>could</i> he be?</p>

  <p>"Mr. Benson," she said, breaking a silence devoted to landscape.</p>

  <p>He rolled over and regarded her, chin on knuckles.</p>

  <p>"At your service."</p>

  <p>"Do you paint? Are you an artist?"</p>

  <p>"Well." Judicious pause. "I should hardly call myself a Nartist." you
  know. I <i>do</i> paint a little. And sketch, you know&mdash;skitty kind of
  things."</p>

  <p>He plucked and began to nibble a blade of grass. It was really not so much
  lying as his quick imagination that prompted him to add, "In Papers, you
  know, and all that."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Jessie, looking at him thoughtfully. Artists were a very
  heterogeneous class certainly, and geniuses had a trick of being a little
  odd. He avoided her eye and bit his grass. "I don't do <i>much</i>, you
  know."</p>

  <p>"It's not your profession?</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," said Hoopdriver, anxious now to hedge. "I don't make a regular
  thing of it, you know. jest now and then something comes into my head and
  down it goes. No&mdash;I'm not a regular artist."</p>

  <p>"Then you don't practise any regular profession? Mr. Hoopdriver looked
  into her eyes and saw their quiet unsuspicious regard. He had vague ideas of
  resuming the detective role. "It's like this," he said, to gain time. "I have
  a sort of profession. Only there's a kind of reason&mdash;nothing much, you
  know "</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon for cross-examining you."</p>

  <p>"No trouble," said Mr. Hoopdriver. "Only I can't very well&mdash;I leave
  it to you, you know. I don't want to make any mystery of it, so far as that
  goes." Should he plunge boldly and be a barrister? That anyhow was something
  pretty good. But she might know about barristry.</p>

  <p>"I think I could guess what you are."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;guess," said Mr. Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>"You come from one of the colonies?"</p>

  <p>"Dear me!" said Mr. Hoopdriver, veering round to the new wind. "How did
  you find out <i>that</i>?" (the man was born in a London suburb, dear
  Reader.)</p>

  <p>"I guessed," she said.</p>

  <p>He lifted his eyebrows as one astonished, and clutched a new piece of
  grass.</p>

  <p>"You were educated up country."</p>

  <p>"Good again," said Hoopdriver, rolling over again into her elbow. "You're
  a <i>clairvoyant</i>." He bit at the grass, smiling. "Which colony was
  it?"</p>

  <p>"That I don't know."</p>

  <p>"You must guess," said Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>"South Africa," she said. "I strongly incline to South Africa."</p>

  <p>"South Africa's quite a large place," he said.</p>

  <p>"But South Africa is right?"</p>

  <p>"You're warm," said Hoopdriver, "anyhow," and the while his imagination
  was eagerly exploring this new province.</p>

  <p>"South Africa <i>is</i> right?" she insisted.</p>

  <p>He turned over again and nodded, smiling reassuringly into her eyes.</p>

  <p>"What made me think of South Africa was that novel of Olive Schreiner's,
  you know&mdash;The Story of an African Farm.' Gregory Rose is so like
  you."</p>

  <p>"I never read 'The Story of an African Farm,'" said Hoopdriver. "I must.
  What's he like?"</p>

  <p>"You must read the book. But it's a wonderful place, with its mixture of
  races, and its brand-new civilisation jostling the old savagery. Were you
  near Khama?"</p>

  <p>"He was a long way off from our place," said Mr. Hoopdriver. "We had a
  little ostrich farm, you know&mdash;Just a few hundred of 'em, out
  Johannesburg way."</p>

  <p>"On the Karroo&mdash;was it called?"</p>

  <p>"That's the term. Some of it was freehold though. Luckily. We got along
  very well in the old days.&mdash;But there's no ostriches on that farm now."
  He had a diamond mine in his head, just at the moment, but he stopped and
  left a little to the girl's imagination. Besides which it had occurred to him
  with a kind of shock that he was lying.</p>

  <p>"What became of the ostriches?"</p>

  <p>"We sold 'em off, when we parted with the farm. Do you mind if I have
  another cigarette? That was when I was quite a little chap, you know, that we
  had this ostrich farm."</p>

  <p>"Did you have Blacks and Boers about you?"</p>

  <p>"Lots," said Mr. Hoopdriver, striking a match on his instep and beginning
  to feel hot at the new responsibility he had brought upon himself.</p>

  <p>"How interesting! Do you know, I've never been out of England except to
  Paris and Mentone and Switzerland."</p>

  <p>"One gets tired of travelling (puff) after a bit, of course."</p>

  <p>"You must tell me about your farm in South Africa. It always stimulates my
  imagination to think of these places. I can fancy all the tall ostriches
  being driven out by a black herd&mdash;to graze, I suppose. How do ostriches
  feed?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Hoopdriver. "That's rather various. They have their fancies,
  you know. There's fruit, of course, and that kind of thing. And chicken food,
  and so forth. You have to use judgment."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever see a lion?" "They weren't very common in our district,"
  said Hoopdriver, quite modestly. "But I've seen them, of course. Once or
  twice."</p>

  <p>"Fancy seeing a lion! Weren't you frightened?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoopdriver was now thoroughly sorry he had accepted that offer of
  South Africa. He puffed his cigarette and regarded the Solent languidly as he
  settled the fate on that lion in his mind. "I scarcely had time," he said.
  "It all happened in a minute."</p>

  <p class="caption">He settled the fate of that lion in his mind.</p><br>

  <p>"Go on," she said.</p>

  <p>"I was going across the inner paddock where the fatted ostriches
  were."</p>

  <p>"Did you <i>eat</i> ostriches, then? I did not know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Eat them!&mdash;often. Very nice they <i>are</i> too, properly stuffed.
  Well, we&mdash;I, rather&mdash;was going across this paddock, and I saw
  something standing up in the moonlight and looking at me." Mr. Hoopdriver was
  in a hot perspiration now. His invention seemed to have gone limp. "Luckily I
  had my father's gun with me. I was scared, though, I can tell you. (Puff.) I
  just aimed at the end that I thought was the head. And let fly. (Puff.) And
  over it went, you know."</p>

  <p>"Dead?"</p>

  <p>"<i>As</i> dead. It was one of the luckiest shots I ever fired. And I
  wasn't much over nine at the time, neither."</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> should have screamed and run away."</p>

  <p>"There's some things you can't run away from," said Mr. Hoopdriver. "To
  run would have been Death."</p>

  <p>"I don't think I ever met a lion-killer before," she remarked, evidently
  with a heightened opinion of him.</p>

  <p>There was a pause. She seemed meditating further questions. Mr. Hoopdriver
  drew his watch hastily. "I say," said Mr. Hoopdriver, showing it to her,
  "don't you think we ought to be getting on?"</p>

  <p>His face was flushed, his ears bright red. She ascribed his confusion to
  modesty. He rose with a lion added to the burthens of his conscience, and
  held out his hand to assist her. They walked down into Cosham again, resumed
  their machines, and went on at a leisurely pace along the northern shore of
  the big harbour. But Mr. Hoopdriver was no longer happy. This horrible, this
  fulsome lie, stuck in his memory. Why <i>had</i> he done it? She did not ask
  for any more South African stories, happily&mdash;at least until Porchester
  was reached&mdash;but talked instead of Living One's Own Life, and how custom
  hung on people like chains. She talked wonderfully, and set Hoopdriver's mind
  fermenting. By the Castle, Mr. Hoopdriver caught several crabs in little
  shore pools. At Fareham they stopped for a second tea, and left the place
  towards the hour of sunset, under such invigorating circumstances as you
  shall in due course hear.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="chap21"
     name="chap21">XXI. &mdash; THE RESCUE EXPEDITION</a></h2>

  <h3>§ XXX</h3>

  <p class="first">And now to tell of those energetic chevaliers, Widgery,
  Dangle, and Phipps, and of that distressed beauty, 'Thomas Plantagenet,' well
  known in society, so the paragraphs said, as Mrs. Milton. We left them at
  Midhurst station, if I remember rightly, waiting, in a state of fine emotion,
  for the Chichester train. It was clearly understood by the entire Rescue
  Party that Mrs. Milton was bearing up bravely against almost overwhelming
  grief. The three gentlemen outdid one another in sympathetic expedients; they
  watched her gravely almost tenderly. The substantial Widgery tugged at his
  moustache, and looked his unspeakable feelings at her with those dog-like,
  brown eyes of his; the slender Dangle tugged at <i>his</i> moustache, and did
  what he could with unsympathetic grey ones. Phipps, unhappily, had no
  moustache to run any risks with, so he folded his arms and talked in a brave,
  indifferent, bearing-up tone about the London, Brighton, and South Coast
  Railway, just to cheer the poor woman up a little. And even Mrs. Milton
  really felt that exalted melancholy to the very bottom of her heart, and
  tried to show it in a dozen little, delicate, feminine ways.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing to do until we get to Chichester," said Dangle.
  "Nothing."</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said Widgery, and aside in her ear: "You really ate scarcely
  anything, you know."</p>

  <p>"Their trains are always late," said Phipps, with his fingers along the
  edge of his collar. Dangle, you must understand, was a sub-editor and
  reviewer, and his pride was to be Thomas Plantagenet's intellectual
  companion. Widgery, the big man, was manager of a bank and a mighty golfer,
  and his conception of his relations to her never came into his mind without
  those charming oldlines, "Douglas, Douglas, tender and true," falling hard
  upon its heels. His name was Douglas-Douglas Widgery. And Phipps, Phipps was
  a medical student still, and he felt that he laid his heart at her feet, the
  heart of a man of the world. She was kind to them all in her way, and
  insisted on their being friends together, in spite of a disposition to
  reciprocal criticism they displayed. Dangle thought Widgery a Philistine,
  appreciating but coarsely the merits of "A Soul Untrammelled," and Widgery
  thought Dangle lacked, humanity&mdash;would talk insincerely to say a clever
  thing. Both Dangle and Widgery thought Phipps a bit of a cub, and Phipps
  thought both Dangle and Widgery a couple of Thundering Bounders.</p>

  <p>"They would have got to Chichester in time for lunch," said Dangle, in the
  train. "After, perhaps. And there's no sufficient place in the road. So soon
  as we get there, Phipps must inquire at the chief hotels to see if any one
  answering to her description has lunched there."</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>I'll</i> inquire," said Phipps. "Willingly. I suppose you and
  Widgery will just hang about&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He saw an expression of pain on Mrs. Milton's gentle face, and stopped
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>"No," said Dangle, "we shan't <i>hang about</i>, as you put it. There are
  two places in Chichester where tourists might go&mdash;the cathedral and a
  remarkably fine museum. I shall go to the cathedral and make an inquiry or
  so, while Widgery&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The museum. Very well. And after that there's a little thing or two I've
  thought of myself," said Widgery.</p>

  <p>To begin with they took Mrs. Milton in a kind of procession to the Red
  Hotel and established her there with some tea. "You are so kind to me," she
  said. "All of you." They signified that it was nothing, and dispersed to
  their inquiries. By six they returned, their zeal a little damped, without
  news. Widgery came back with Dangle. Phipps was the last to return. "You're
  quite sure," said Widgery, that there isn't any flaw in that inference of
  yours?"</p>

  <p>"Quite," said Dangle, rather shortly.</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Widgery, "their starting from Midhurst on the Chichester
  road doesn't absolutely bind them not to change their minds."</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow!&mdash;It does. Really it does. You must allow me to have
  enough intelligence to think of cross-roads. Really you must. There aren't
  any cross-roads to tempt them. Would they turn aside here? No. Would they
  turn there? Many more things are inevitable than you fancy."</p>

  <p>"We shall see at once," said Widgery, at the window. "Here comes Phipps.
  For my own part&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Phipps!" said Mrs. Milton. "Is he hurrying? Does he look&mdash;" She rose
  in her eagerness, biting her trembling lip, and went towards the window.</p>

  <p>"No news," said Phipps, entering.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Widgery.</p>

  <p>"None?" said Dangle.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Phipps. "One fellow had got hold of a queer story of a man in
  bicycling clothes, who was asking the same question about this time
  yesterday."</p>

  <p>"What question?" said Mrs. Milton, in the shadow of the window. She spoke
  in a low voice, almost a whisper.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;Have you seen a young lady in a grey bicycling costume?"</p>

  <p>Dangle caught at his lower lip. "What's that?" he said. "Yesterday! A man
  asking after her then! What can <i>that</i> mean?"</p>

  <p>"Heaven knows," said Phipps, sitting down wearily. "You'd better
  infer."</p>

  <p>"What kind of man?" said Dangle.</p>

  <p>"How should I know?&mdash;in bicycling costume, the fellow said."</p>

  <p>"But what height?&mdash;What complexion?"</p>

  <p>"Didn't ask," said Phipps. "<i>Didn't ask!</i> Nonsense," said Dangle.</p>

  <p>"Ask him yourself," said Phipps. "He's an ostler chap in the White Hart,
  &mdash;short, thick-set fellow, with a red face and a crusty manner. Leaning
  up against the stable door. Smells of whiskey. Go and ask him."</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Dangle, taking his straw hat from the shade over the
  stuffed bird on the chiffonier and turning towards the door. "I might have
  known."</p>

  <p>Phipps' mouth opened and shut.</p>

  <p>"You're tired, I'm sure, Mr. Phipps," said the lady, soothingly. "Let me
  ring for some tea for you." It suddenly occurred to Phipps that he had lapsed
  a little from his chivalry. "I was a little annoyed at the way he rushed me
  to do all this business," he said. "But I'd do a hundred times as much if it
  would bring you any nearer to her." Pause. "I <i>would</i> like a little
  tea."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to raise any false hopes," said Widgery. "But I do
  <i>not</i> believe they even came to Chichester. Dangle's a very clever
  fellow, of course, but sometimes these Inferences of his&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tchak!" said Phipps, suddenly.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" said Mrs. Milton.</p>

  <p>"Something I've forgotten. I went right out from here, went to every other
  hotel in the place, and never thought&mdash;But never mind. I'll ask when the
  waiter comes."</p>

  <p>"You don't mean&mdash;" A tap, and the door opened. "Tea, m'm? yes, m'm,"
  said the waiter.</p>

  <p>"One minute," said Phipps. "Was a lady in grey, a cycling lady&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stopped here yesterday? Yessir. Stopped the night. With her brother, sir
  &mdash;a young gent."</p>

  <p>"Brother!" said Mrs. Milton, in a low tone. "Thank God!"</p>

  <p>The waiter glanced at her and understood everything. "A young gent, sir,"
  he said, "very free with his money. Give the name of Beaumont." He proceeded
  to some rambling particulars, and was cross-examined by Widgery on the plans
  of the young couple.</p>

  <p>"Havant! Where's Havant?" said Phipps. "I seem to remember it
  somewhere."</p>

  <p>"Was the man tall?" said Mrs. Milton, intently, "distinguished looking?
  with a long, flaxen moustache? and spoke with a drawl?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said the waiter, and thought. "His moustache, m'm, was scarcely
  long&mdash;scrubby more, and young looking."</p>

  <p>"About thirty-five, he was?"</p>

  <p>"No, m'm. More like five and twenty. Not that."</p>

  <p>"Dear me!" said Mrs. Milton, speaking in a curious, hollow voice, fumbling
  for her salts, and showing the finest self-control. "It must have been her
  <i>younger</i> brother&mdash;must have been."</p>

  <p>"That will do, thank you," said Widgery, officiously, feeling that she
  would be easier under this new surprise if the man were dismissed. The waiter
  turned to go, and almost collided with Dangle, who was entering the room,
  panting excitedly and with a pocket handkerchief held to his right
  eye.</p>

    <p><a id="pic28"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>

  </div>

  <p class="caption">With a pocket-handkerchief held to his right
  eye...</p><br>

  <p>"Hullo!" said Dangle. "What's up?"</p>

  <p>"What's up with <i>you</i>?" said Phipps.</p>

  <p>"Nothing&mdash;an altercation merely with that drunken ostler of yours. He
  thought it was a plot to annoy him&mdash;that the Young Lady in Grey was
  mythical. Judged from your manner. I've got a piece of raw meat to keep over
  it. You have some news, I see?"</p>

  <p>"Did the man hit you?" asked Widgery.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Milton rose and approached Dangle. "Cannot I do anything?"</p>

  <p>Dangle was heroic. "Only tell me your news," he said, round the corner of
  the handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"It was in this way," said Phipps, and explained rather sheepishly. While
  he was doing so, with a running fire of commentary from Widgery, the waiter
  brought in a tray of tea. "A time table," said Dangle, promptly, "for
  Havant." Mrs. Milton poured two cups, and Phipps and Dangle partook in
  passover form. They caught the train by a hair's breadth. So to Havant and
  inquiries.</p>

  <p>Dangle was puffed up to find that his guess of Havant was right. In view
  of the fact that beyond Havant the Southampton road has a steep hill
  continuously on the right-hand side, and the sea on the left, he hit upon a
  magnificent scheme for heading the young folks off. He and Mrs. Milton would
  go to Fareham, Widgery and Phipps should alight one each at the intermediate
  stations of Cosham and Porchester, and come on by the next train if they had
  no news. If they did not come on, a wire to the Fareham post office was to
  explain why. It was Napoleonic, and more than consoled Dangle for the open
  derision of the Havant street boys at the handkerchief which still protected
  his damaged eye.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the scheme answered to perfection. The fugitives escaped by a
  hair's breadth. They were outside the Golden Anchor at Fareham, and preparing
  to mount, as Mrs. Milton and Dangle came round the corner from the station.
  "It's her!" said Mrs. Milton, and would have screamed. "Hist!" said Dangle,
  gripping the lady's arm, removing his handkerchief in his excitement, and
  leaving the piece of meat over his eye, an extraordinary appearance which
  seemed unexpectedly to calm her. "Be cool!" said Dangle, glaring under the
  meat. "They must not see us. They will get away else. Were there flys at the
  station?" The young couple mounted and vanished round the corner of the
  Winchester road. Had it not been for the publicity of the business, Mrs.
  Milton would have fainted. <i>"Save her!"</i> she said.</p>

  <p>"Ah! A conveyance," said Dangle. "One minute."</p>

  <p>He left her in a most pathetic attitude, with her hand pressed to her
  heart, and rushed into the Golden Anchor. Dog cart in ten minutes. Emerged.
  The meat had gone now, and one saw the cooling puffiness over his eye. "I
  will conduct you back to the station," said Dangle; "hurry back here, and
  pursue them. You will meet Widgery and Phipps and tell them I am in
  pursuit."</p>

  <p>She was whirled back to the railway station and left there, on a hard,
  blistered, wooden seat in the sun. She felt tired and dreadfully ruffled and
  agitated and dusty. Dangle was, no doubt, most energetic and devoted; but for
  a kindly, helpful manner commend her to Douglas Widgery.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Dangle, his face golden in the evening sun, was driving (as well
  as he could) a large, black horse harnessed into a thing called a gig,
  northwestward towards Winchester. Dangle, barring his swollen eye, was a
  refined-looking little man, and be wore a deerstalker cap and was dressed in
  dark grey. His neck was long and slender. Perhaps you know what gigs are,
  &mdash;huge, big, wooden things and very high and the horse, too, was huge
  and big and high, with knobby legs, a long face, a hard mouth, and a whacking
  trick of pacing. Smack, smack, smack, smack it went along the road, and hard
  by the church it shied vigorously at a hooded perambulator.</p>

  <p>The history of the Rescue Expedition now becomes confused. It appears that
  Widgery was extremely indignant to find Mrs. Milton left about upon the
  Fareham platform. The day had irritated him somehow, though he had started
  with the noblest intentions, and he seemed glad to find an outlet for
  justifiable indignation. "He's such a spasmodic creature," said Widgery.
  "Rushing off! And I suppose we're to wait here until he comes back! It's
  likely. He's so egotistical, is Dangle. Always wants to mismanage everything
  himself."</p>

  <p>"He means to help me," said Mrs. Milton, a little reproachfully, touching
  his arm. Widgery was hardly in the mood to be mollified all at once. "He need
  not prevent <i>me</i>," he said, and stopped. "It's no good talking, you
  know, and you are tired."</p>

  <p>"I can go on," she said brightly, "if only we find her." " While I was
  cooling my heels in Cosham I bought a county map." He produced and opened it.
  "Here, you see, is the road out of Fareham." He proceeded with the calm
  deliberation of a business man to develop a proposal of taking train
  forthwith to Winchester. "They <i>must</i> be going to Winchester," he
  explained. It was inevitable. To-morrow Sunday, Winchester a cathedral town,
  road going nowhere else of the slightest importance,</p>

  <p>"But Mr. Dangle?"</p>

  <p>"He will simply go on until he has to pass something, and then he will
  break his neck. I have seen Dangle drive before. It's scarcely likely a dog-
  cart, especially a hired dog-cart, will overtake bicycles in the cool of the
  evening. Rely upon me, Mrs. Milton&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am in your hands," she said, with pathetic littleness, looking up at
  him, and for the moment he forgot the exasperation of the day.</p>

  <p>Phipps, during this conversation, had stood in a somewhat depressed
  attitude, leaning on his stick, feeling his collar, and looking from one
  speaker to the other. The idea of leaving Dangle behind seemed to him an
  excellent one. "We might leave a message at the place where he got the dog-
  cart," he suggested, when he saw their eyes meeting. There was a cheerful
  alacrity about all three at the proposal.</p>

  <p>But they never got beyond Botley. For even as their train ran into the
  station, a mighty rumbling was heard, there was a shouting overhead, the
  guard stood astonished on the platform, and Phipps, thrusting his head out of
  the window, cried, "There he goes!" and sprang out of the carriage. Mrs.
  Milton, following in alarm, just saw it. From Widgery it was hidden. Botley
  station lies in a cutting, overhead was the roadway, and across the lemon
  yellows and flushed pinks of the sunset, there whirled a great black mass, a
  horse like a long-nosed chess knight, the upper works of a gig, and Dangle in
  transit from front to back. A monstrous shadow aped him across the cutting.
  It was the event of a second. Dangle seemed to jump, hang in the air
  momentarily, and vanish, and after a moment's pause came a heart-rending
  smash. Then two black heads running swiftly.</p>

  <p class="caption">There whirled a great black mass...<br> and Dangle in

  from front to back.</p><br>

  <p>"Better get out," said Phipps to Mrs. Milton, who stood fascinated in the
  doorway.</p>

  <p>In another moment all three were hurrying up the steps. They found Dangle,
  hatless, standing up with cut hands extended, having his hands brushed by an
  officious small boy. A broad, ugly road ran downhill in a long vista, and in
  the distance was a little group of Botley inhabitants holding the big, black
  horse. Even at that distance they could see the expression of conscious pride
  on the monster's visage. It was as wooden-faced a horse as you can imagine.
  The beasts in the Tower of London, on which the men in armour are perched,
  are the only horses I have ever seen at all like it. However, we are not
  concerned now with the horse, but with Dangle. " Hurt?" asked Phipps,
  eagerly, leading.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Dangle!" cried Mrs. Milton, clasping her hands.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" said Dangle, not surprised in the slightest. "Glad you've come. I
  may want you. Bit of a mess I'm in&mdash;eigh? But I've caught 'em. At the
  very place I expected, too."</p>

  <p>"Caught them!" said Widgery. Where are they?"</p>

  <p>"Up there," he said, with a backward motion of his head. "About a mile up
  the hill. I left 'em. I <i>had</i> to."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand," said Mrs. Milton, with that rapt, painful look
  again. "Have you found Jessie?"</p>

  <p>"I have. I wish I could wash the gravel out of my hands somewhere. It was
  like this, you know. Came on them suddenly round a corner. Horse shied at the
  bicycles. They were sitting by the roadside botanising flowers. I just had
  time to shout, 'Jessie Milton, we've been looking for you,' and then that
  confounded brute bolted. I didn't dare turn round. I had all my work to do to
  save myself being turned over, as it was&mdash;so long as I did, I mean. I
  just shouted, 'Return to your friends. All will be forgiven.' And off I came,
  clatter, clatter. Whether they heard&mdash;"</p>

  <p><i>"Take me to her,"</i> said Mrs. Milton, with intensity, turning towards
  Widgery.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said Widgery, suddenly becoming active. "How far is it,
  Dangle?"</p>

  <p>"Mile and a half or two miles. I was determined to find them, you know. I
  say though&mdash;Look at my hands! But I beg your pardon, Mrs. Milton." He
  turned to Phipps. "Phipps, I say, where shall I wash the gravel out? And have
  a look at my knee?"</p>

  <p>"There's the station," said Phipps, becoming helpful. Dangle made a step,
  and a damaged knee became evident. "Take my arm," said Phipps.</p>

  <p>"Where can we get a conveyance?" asked Widgery of two small boys.</p>

  <p>The two small boys failed to understand. They looked at one another.</p>

  <p>"There's not a cab, not a go-cart, in sight," said Widgery. "It's a case
  of a horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse."</p>

  <p>"There's a harse all right," said one of the small boys with a movement of
  the head.</p>

  <p>"Don't you know where we can hire traps? asked Widgery. "Or a cart or
  &mdash;anything?" asked Mrs. Milton.</p>

  <p>"John Ooker's gart a cart, but no one can't 'ire'n," said the larger of
  the small boys, partially averting his face and staring down the road and
  making a song of it. "And so's my feyther, for's leg us broke."</p>

  <p>"Not a cart even! Evidently. What shall we do?"</p>

  <p>It occurred to Mrs. Milton that if Widgery was the man for courtly
  devotion, Dangle was infinitely readier of resource. "I suppose&mdash;" she
  said, timidly. "Perhaps if you were to ask Mr. Dangle&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And then all the gilt came off Widgery. He answered quite rudely.
  "Confound Dangle! Hasn't he messed us up enough? He must needs drive after
  them in a trap to tell them we're coming, and now you want me to ask
  him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Her beautiful blue eyes were filled with tears. He stopped abruptly. "I'll
  go and ask Dangle," he said, shortly. "If you wish it." And went striding
  into the station and down the steps, leaving her in the road under the quiet
  inspection of the two little boys, and with a kind of ballad refrain running
  through her head, "Where are the Knights of the Olden Time?" and feeling
  tired to death and hungry and dusty and out of curl, and, in short, a martyr
  woman.</p><br>

  <h3>§ XXXI</h3>

  <p class="first">It goes to my heart to tell of the end of that day, how the
  fugitives vanished into Immensity; how there were no more trains how Botley
  stared unsympathetically with a palpable disposition to derision, denying
  conveyances how the landlord of the Heron was suspicious, how the next day
  was Sunday, and the hot summer's day had crumpled the collar of Phipps and
  stained the skirts of Mrs. Milton, and dimmed the radiant emotions of the
  whole party. Dangle, with sticking-plaster and a black eye, felt the
  absurdity of the pose of the Wounded Knight, and abandoned it after the
  faintest efforts. Recriminations never, perhaps, held the foreground of the
  talk, but they played like summer lightning on the edge of the conversation.
  And deep in the hearts of all was a galling sense of the ridiculous. Jessie,
  they thought, was most to blame. Apparently, too, the worst, which would have
  made the whole business tragic, was not happening. Here was a young
  woman&mdash;young woman do I say? a mere girl!&mdash;had chosen to leave a
  comfortable home in Surbiton, and all the delights of a refined and
  intellectual circle, and had rushed off, trailing us after her, posing hard,
  mutually jealous, and now tired and weather-worn, to flick us off at last,
  mere mud from her wheel, into this detestable village beer-house on a
  Saturday night! And she had done it, not for Love and Passion, which are
  serious excuses one may recognise even if one must reprobate, but just for a
  Freak, just for a fantastic Idea; for nothing, in fact, but the outraging of
  Common Sense. Yet withal, such was our restraint, that we talked of her still
  as one much misguided, as one who burthened us with anxiety, as a lamb
  astray, and Mrs. Milton having eaten, continued to show the finest feelings
  on the matter.</p>

  <p>She sat, I may mention, in the cushioned basket-chair, the only
  comfortable chair in the room, and we sat on incredibly hard, horsehair
  things having antimacassars tied to their backs by means of lemon-coloured
  bows. It was different from those dear old talks at Surbiton, somehow. She
  sat facing the window, which was open (the night was so tranquil and warm),
  and the dim light&mdash;for we did not use the lamp&mdash;suited her
  admirably. She talked in a voice that told you she was tired, and she seemed
  inclined to state a case against herself in the matter of "A Soul
  Untrammelled." It was such an evening as might live in a sympathetic memoir,
  but it was a little dull while it lasted.</p>

  <p>"I feel," she said, "that I am to blame. I have Developed. That first book
  of mine&mdash;I do not go back upon a word of it, mind, but it has been
  misunderstood, misapplied."</p>

  <p>"It has," said Widgery, trying to look so deeply sympathetic as to be
  visible in the dark. "Deliberately misunderstood."</p>

  <p>"Don't say that," said the lady. "Not deliberately. I try and think that
  critics are honest. After their lights. I was not thinking of critics. But
  she&mdash;I mean&mdash;" She paused, an interrogation.</p>

  <p>"It is possible," said Dangle, scrutinising his sticking-plaster.</p>

  <p>"I write a book and state a case. I want people to <i>think</i> as I
  recommend, not to <i>do</i> as I recommend. It is just Teaching. Only I make
  it into a story. I want to Teach new Ideas, new Lessons, to promulgate Ideas.
  Then when the Ideas have been spread abroad&mdash;Things will come about.
  Only now it is madness to fly in the face of the established order. Bernard
  Shaw, you know, has explained that with regard to Socialism. We all know that
  to earn all you consume is right, and that living on invested capital is
  wrong. Only we cannot begin while we are so few. It is Those Others."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," said Widgery. "It is Those Others. They must begin
  first."</p>

  <p>"And meanwhile you go on banking&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If I didn't, some one else would."</p>

  <p>"And I live on Mr. Milton's Lotion while I try to gain a footing in
  Literature."</p>

  <p><i>"Try!"</i> said Phipps. "You <i>have</i> done so." And, "That's
  different," said Dangle, at the same time.</p>

  <p>"You are so kind to me. But in this matter. Of course Georgina Griffiths
  in my book lived alone in a flat in Paris and went to life classes and had
  men visitors, but then she was over twenty-one."</p>

  <p>"Jessica is only seventeen, and girlish for that," said Dangle.</p>

  <p>"It alters everything. That child! It is different with a woman. And
  Georgina Griffiths never flaunted her freedom&mdash;on a bicycle, in country
  places. In this country. Where every one is so particular. Fancy,
  <i>sleeping</i> away from home. It's dreadful&mdash;If it gets about it
  spells ruin for her."</p>

  <p>"Ruin," said Widgery.</p>

  <p>"No man would marry a girl like that," said Phipps.</p>

  <p>"It must be hushed up," said Dangle.</p>

  <p>"It always seems to me that life is made up of individuals, of individual
  cases. We must weigh each person against his or her circumstances. General
  rules don't apply&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I often feel the force of that," said Widgery. "Those are my rules. Of
  course my books&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's different, altogether different," said Dangle. "A novel deals with
  typical cases."</p>

  <p>"And life is not typical," said Widgery, with immense profundity.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly, unintentionally, being himself most surprised and shocked
  of any in the room, Phipps yawned. The failing was infectious, and the
  gathering having, as you can easily understand, talked itself weary,
  dispersed on trivial pretences. But not to sleep immediately. Directly Dangle
  was alone he began, with infinite disgust, to scrutinise his darkling eye,
  for he was a neat-minded little man in spite of his energy. The whole
  business&mdash;so near a capture&mdash;was horribly vexatious. Phipps sat on
  his bed for some time examining, with equal disgust, a collar he would have
  thought incredible for Sunday twenty-four hours before. Mrs. Milton fell
  a-musing on the mortality of even big, fat men with dog-like eyes, and
  Widgery was unhappy because he had been so cross to her at the station, and
  because so far he did not feel that he had scored over Dangle. Also he was
  angry with Dangle. And all four of them, being souls living very much upon
  the appearances of things, had a painful, mental middle distance of Botley
  derisive and suspicious, and a remoter background of London humorous, and
  Surbiton speculative. Were they really, after all, behaving
absurdly?</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="chap22"
     name="chap22">XXII. &mdash; MR. HOOPDRIVER, KNIGHT ERRANT</a></h2>

  <h3>§ XXXII</h3>

  <p class="first">As Mr. Dangle bad witnessed, the fugitives had been left by
  him by the side of the road about two miles from Botley. Before Mr. Dangle's
  appearance, Mr. Hoopdriver had been learning with great interest that mere
  roadside flowers had names,&mdash;star-flowers, wind-stars, St. John's wort,
  willow herb, lords and ladies, bachelor's buttons,&mdash;most curious names,
  some of them. "The flowers are all different in South Africa, y'know," he was
  explaining with a happy fluke of his imagination to account for his
  ignorance. Then suddenly, heralded by clattering sounds and a gride of
  wheels, Dangle had flared and thundered across the tranquillity of the summer
  evening; Dangle, swaying and gesticulating behind a corybantic black horse,
  had hailed Jessie by her name, had backed towards the hedge for no ostensible
  reason, and vanished to the accomplishment of the Fate that had been written
  down for him from the very beginning of things. Jessie and Hoopdriver had
  scarcely time to stand up and seize their machines, before this tumultuous,
  this swift and wonderful passing of Dangle was achieved. He went from side to
  side of the road,&mdash;worse even than the riding forth of Mr. Hoopdriver it
  was,&mdash;and vanished round the corner.</p>

    <p><a id="pic30"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>

  </div>

  <p class="caption">Dangle swaying and gesticulating<br> behind a corybantic
black
  horse.</p><br>

  <p>"He knew my name," said Jessie. "Yes&mdash;it was Mr. Dangle."</p>

  <p>"That was our bicycles did that," said Mr. Hoopdriver simultaneously, and
  speaking with a certain complacent concern. "I hope he won't get hurt."</p>

  <p>"That was Mr. Dangle," repeated Jessie, and Mr. Hoopdriver heard this
  time, with a violent start. His eyebrows went up spasmodically.</p>

  <p>"What! someone you know?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Lord!"</p>

  <p>"He was looking for me," said Jessie. "I could see. He began to call to me
  before the horse shied. My stepmother has sent him."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoopdriver wished he had returned the bicycle after all, for his ideas
  were still a little hazy about Bechamel and Mrs. Milton. Honesty IS the best
  policy&mdash;often, he thought. He turned his head this way and that. He
  became active. "After us, eigh? Then he'll come back. He's gone down that
  hill, and he won't be able to pull up for a bit, I'm certain."</p>

  <p>Jessie, he saw, had wheeled her machine into the road and was mounting.
  Still staring at the corner that had swallowed up Dangle, Hoopdriver followed
  suit. And so, just as the sun was setting, they began another flight
  together,&mdash;riding now towards Bishops Waltham, with Mr. Hoopdriver in
  the post of danger&mdash;the rear&mdash;ever and again looking over his
  shoulder and swerving dangerously as he did so. Occasionally Jessie had to
  slacken her pace. He breathed heavily, and hated himself because his mouth
  fell open, After nearly an hour's hard riding, they found themselves uncaught
  at Winchester. Not a trace of Dangle nor any other danger was visible as they
  rode into the dusky, yellow-lit street. Though the bats had been fluttering
  behind thehedges and the evening star was bright while they were still two
  miles from Winchester, Mr. Hoopdriver pointed out the dangers of stopping in
  such an obvious abiding-place, and gently but firmly insisted upon
  replenishing the lamps and riding on towards Salisbury. From Winchester,
  roads branch in every direction, and to turn abruptly westward was clearly
  the way to throw off the chase. As Hoopdriver saw the moon rising broad and
  yellow through the twilight, he thought he should revive the effect of that
  ride out of Bognor; but somehow, albeit the moon and all the atmospheric
  effects were the same, the emotions were different. They rode in absolute
  silence, and slowly after they had cleared the outskirts of Winchester. Both
  of them were now nearly tired out,&mdash;the level was tedious, and even a
  little hill a burden; and so it came about that in the hamlet of Wallenstock
  they were beguiled to stop and ask for accommodation in an exceptionally
  prosperouslooking village inn. A plausible landlady rose to the occasion.</p>

  <p>Now, as they passed into the room where their suppers were prepared, Mr.
  Hoopdriver caught a glimpse through a door ajar and floating in a reek of
  smoke, of three and a half faces&mdash;for the edge of the door cut one down
  &mdash;and an American cloth-covered table with several glasses and a
  tankard. And he also heard a remark. In the second before he heard that
  remark, Mr. Hoopdriver had been a proud and happy man, to particularize, a
  baronet's heir incognito. He had surrendered their bicycles to the odd man of
  the place with infinite easy dignity, and had bowingly opened the door for
  Jessie. "Who's that, then?" he imagined people saying; and then, "Some'n
  pretty well orf&mdash;judge by the bicycles." Then the imaginary spectators
  would fall a-talking of the fashionableness of bicycling,&mdash;how judges
  And stockbrokers and actresses and, in fact, all the best people rode, and
  how that it was often the fancy of such great folk to shun the big hotels,
  the adulation of urban crowds, and seek, incognito, the cosy quaintnesses of
  village life. Then, maybe, they would think of a certain nameless air of
  distinction about the lady who had stepped across the doorway, and about the
  handsome, flaxen-moustached, blue-eyed Cavalier who had followed her in, and
  they would look one to another. "Tell you what it is," one of the village
  elders would say&mdash;just as they do in novels&mdash;voicing the thought of
  all, in a low, impressive tone: "There's such a thing as entertaining
  barranets unawares&mdash;not to mention no higher things&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Such, I say, had been the filmy, delightful stuff in Mr. Hoopdriver's head
  the moment before he heard that remark. But the remark toppled him headlong.
  What the precise remark was need not concern us. It was a casual piece of
  such satire as Strephon delights in. Should you be curious, dear lady, as to
  its nature, you have merely to dress yourself in a really modern cycling
  costume, get one of the feeblest-looking of your men to escort you, and ride
  out, next Saturday evening, to any public house where healthy, homely people
  gather together. Then you will hear quite a lot of the kind of thing Mr.
  Hoopdriver heard. More, possibly, than you will desire.</p>

  <p>The remark, I must add, implicated Mr. Hoopdriver. It indicated an entire
  disbelief in his social standing. At a blow, it shattered all the gorgeous
  imaginative fabric his mind had been rejoicing in. All that foolish happiness
  vanished like a dream. And there was nothing to show for it, as there is
  nothing to show for any spiteful remark that has ever been made. Perhaps the
  man who said the thing had a gleam of satisfaction at the idea of taking a
  complacent-looking fool down a peg, but it is just as possible he did not
  know at the time that his stray shot had hit. He had thrown it as a boy
  throws a stone at a bird. And it not only demolished a foolish, happy
  conceit, but it wounded. It touched Jessie grossly.</p>

  <p>She did not hear it, he concluded from her subsequent bearing; but during
  the supper they had in the little private dining-room, though she talked
  cheerfully, he was preoccupied. Whiffs of indistinct conversation, and now
  and then laughter, came in from the inn parloiir through the pelargoniums in
  the open window. Hoopdriver felt it must all be in the same strain,&mdash;at
  her expense and his. He answered her abstractedly. She was tired, she said,
  and presently went to her room. Mr. Hoopdriver, in his courtly way, opened
  the door for her and bowed her out. He stood listening and fearing some new
  offence as she went upstairs, and round the bend where the barometer hung
  beneath the stuffed birds. Then he went back to the room, and stood on the
  hearthrug before the. paper fireplace ornament. "Cads!" he said in a scathing
  undertone, as a fresh burst of laughter came floating in. All through supper
  he had been composing stinging repartee, a blistering speech of denunciation
  to be presently delivered. He would rate them as a nobleman should: "Call
  themselves Englishmen, indeed, and insult a woman!" he would say; take the
  names and addresses perhaps, threaten to speak to the Lord of the Manor,
  promise to let them hear from him again, and so out with consternation in his
  wake. It really ought to be done.</p>

  <p>"Teach 'em better," he said fiercely, and tweaked his moustache painfully.
  What was it? He revived the objectionable remark for his own exasperation,
  and then went over the heads of his speech again.</p>

  <p>He coughed, made three steps towards the door, then stopped and went back
  to the hearthrug. He wouldn't&mdash;after all. Yet was he not a Knight
  Errant? Should such men go unreproved, unchecked, by wandering baronets
  incognito? Magnanimity? Look at it in that way? Churls beneath one's notice?
  No; merely a cowardly subterfuge. He <i>would</i> after all.</p>

  <p>Something within him protested that he was a hot-headed ass even as he
  went towards the door again. But he only went on the more resolutely. He
  crossed the hall, by the bar, and entered the room from which the remark had
  proceeded. He opened the door abruptly and stood scowling on them in the
  doorway. "You'll only make a mess of it," remarked the internal sceptic.
  There were five men in the room altogether: a fat person, with a long pipe
  and a great number of chins, in an armchair by the fireplace, who wished Mr.
  Hoopdriver a good evening very affably; a young fellow smoking a cutty and
  displaying crossed legs with gaiters; a little, bearded man with a toothless
  laugh; a middle-aged, comfortable man with bright eyes, who wore a velveteen
  jacket; and a fair young man, very genteel in a yellowish-brown ready-made
  suit and a white tie.</p>

  <p>"H'm," said Mr. Hoopdriver, looking very stern and harsh. And then in a
  forbidding tone, as one who consented to no liberties, "Good evening."</p>

  <p>"Very pleasant day we've been 'aving," said the fair young man with the
  white tie.</p>

  <p>"Very," said Mr. Hoopdriver, slowly; and taking a brown armchair, he
  planted it with great deliberation where he faced the fireplace, and sat
  down. Let's see&mdash;how did that speech begin?</p>

  <p>"Very pleasant roads about here," said the fair young man with the white
  tie.</p>

  <p>"Very," said Mr. Hoopdriver, eyeing him darkly. Have to begin somehow.
  "The roads about here are all right, and the weather about here is all right,
  but what I've come in here to say is&mdash;there's some damned unpleasant
  people&mdash;damned unpleasant people!"</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said the young man with the gaiters, apparently making a mental
  inventory of his pearl buttons as he spoke. "How's that?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoopdriver put his hands on his knees and stuck out his elbows with
  extreme angularity. In his heart he was raving at his idiotic folly at thus
  bearding these lions,&mdash;indisputably they <i>were</i> lions,&mdash;but he
  had to go through with it now. Heaven send, his breath, which was already
  getting a trifle spasmodic, did not suddenly give out. He fixed his eye on
  the face of the fat man with the chins, and spoke in a low, impressive voice.
  "I came here, sir," said Mr. Hoopdriver, and paused to inflate his cheeks,
  "with a lady."</p>

  <p>"Very nice lady," said the man with the gaiters, putting his head on one
  side to admire a pearl button that had been hiding behind the curvature of
  his calf. "Very nice lady indeed."</p>

  <p>"I came here," said Mr. Hoopdriver, "with a lady."</p>

  <p>"We saw you did, bless you," said the fat man with the chins, in a curious
  wheezy voice. "I don't see there's anything so very extraordinary in that.
  One 'ud think we hadn't eyes."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoopdriver coughed. "I came, here, sir&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We've 'eard that," said the little man with the beard, sharply and went
  off into an amiable chuckle. "We know it by 'art," said the little man,
  elaborating the point.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoopdriver temporarily lost his thread. He glared malignantly at the
  little man with the beard, and tried to recover his discourse. A pause.</p>

  <p>"You were saying," said the fair young man with the white tie, speaking
  very politely, "that you came here with a lady."</p>

  <p>"A lady," meditated the gaiter gazer.</p>

  <p>The man in velveteen, who was looking from one speaker to another with
  keen, bright eyes, now laughed as though a point had been scored, and
  stimulated Mr. Hoopdriver to speak, by fixing him with an expectant
  regard.</p>

  <p>"Some dirty cad," said Mr. Hoopdriver, proceeding with his discourse, and
  suddenly growing extremely fierce, "made a remark as we went by this
  door."</p>

    <p><a id="pic31"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>

  </div>

  <p class="caption">"Some dirty cad made a remark as we went by this
  door."</p><br>

  <p>"Steady on!" said the old gentleman with many chins. ,Steady on! Don't you
  go a-calling us names, please."</p>

  <p>"One minute!" said Mr. Hoopdriver. "It wasn't I began calling names."
  ("Who did? said the man with the chins.) "I'm not calling any of you dirty
  cads. Don't run away with that impression. Only some person in this room made
  a remark that showed he wasn't fit to wipe boots on, and, with all due
  deference to such gentlemen as ARE gentlemen" (Mr. Hoopdriver looked round
  for moral support), "I want to know which it was."</p>

  <p>"Meanin'?" said the fair young man in the white tie.</p>

  <p>"That I'm going to wipe my boots on 'im straight away," said Mr.
  Hoopdriver, reverting to anger, if with a slight catch in his
  throat&mdash;than which threat of personal violence nothing had been further
  from his thoughts on entering the room. He said this because he could think
  of nothing else to say, and stuck out his elbows truculently to hide the
  sinking of his heart. It is curious how situations run away with us.</p>

  <p>"'Ullo, Charlie!" said the little man, and "My eye!" said the owner of the
  chins. 'You're going to wipe your boots on 'im?" said the fair young man, in
  a tone of mild surprise.</p>

  <p>"I am," said Mr. Hoopdriver, with emphatic resolution, and glared in the
  young man's face.</p>

  <p>"That's fair and reasonable," said the man in the velveteen jacket; "if
  you can."</p>

  <p>The interest of the meeting seemed transferred to the young man in the
  white tic. "Of course, if you can't find out which it is, I suppose you're
  prepared to wipe your boots in a liberal way on everybody in the room," said
  this young man, in the same tone of impersonal question. "This gentleman, the
  champion lightweight&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Own up, Charlie," said the young man with the gaiters, looking up for a
  moment. "And don't go a-dragging in your betters. It's fair and square. You
  can't get out of it."</p>

  <p>"Was it this&mdash;gent?" began Mr. Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>"Of course," said the young man in the white tie, "when it comes to
  talking of wiping boots&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm not talking; I'm going to do it," said Mr. Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>He looked round at the meeting. They were no longer antagonists; they were
  spectators. He would have to go through with it now. But this tone of
  personal aggression on the maker of the remark had somehow got rid of the
  oppressive feeling of Hoopdriver contra mundum. Apparently, he would have to
  fight someone. Would he get a black eye? Would he get very much hurt? Pray
  goodness it wasn't that sturdy chap in the gaiters! Should he rise and begin?
  What would she think if he brought a black eye to breakfast to-morrow?"Is
  this the man?" said Mr. Hoopdriver, with a business-like calm, and arms more
  angular than ever.</p>

  <p>"Eat 'im!" said the little man with the beard; "eat 'im straight orf."</p>

  <p>"Steady on!" said the young man in the white tie. "Steady on a minute. If
  I did happen to say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You did, did you?" said Mr. Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>Backing out of it, Charlie?" said the young man with the gaiters.</p>

  <p>"Not a bit," said Charlie. "Surely we can pass a bit of a joke&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to teach you to keep your jokes to yourself," said Mr.
  Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>"Bray-vo!" said the shepherd of the flock of chins.</p>

  <p>"Charlie <i>is</i> a bit too free with his jokes," said the little man
  with the beard.</p>

  <p>"It's downright disgusting," said Hoopdriver, falling back upon his
  speech. "A lady can't ride a bicycle in a country road, or wear a dress a
  little out of the ordinary, but every dirty little greaser must needs go
  shouting insults&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> didn't know the young lady would hear what I said," said
  Charlie. " Surely one can speak friendly to one's friends. How was I to know
  the door was open&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Hoopdriver began to suspect that his antagonist was, if possible, more
  seriously alarmed at the prospect of violence than himself, and his spirits
  rose again. These chaps ought to have a thorough lesson. "Of <i>course</i>
  you knew the door was open," he retorted indignantly. "Of <i>course</i> you
  thought we should hear what you said. Don't go telling lies about it. It's no
  good your saying things like that. You've had your fun, and you meant to have
  your fun. And I mean to make an example of you, Sir."</p>

  <p>"Ginger beer," said the little man with the beard, in a confidential tone
  to the velveteen jacket, "is regular up this 'ot weather. Bustin' its bottles
  it is everywhere."</p>

  <p>"What's the good of scrapping about in a public house?" said Charlie,
  appealing to the company. "A fair fight without interruptions, now, <i>I
  wouldn't</i> mind, if the gentleman's so disposed."</p>

  <p>Evidently the man was horribly afraid. Mr. Hoopdriver grew truculent.</p>

  <p>"Where you like," said Mr. Hoopdriver. "jest wherever you like."</p>

  <p>"You insulted the gent," said the man in velveteen.</p>

  <p>"Don't be a bloomin' funk, Charlie," said the man in gaiters. "Why, you
  got a stone of him, if you got an ounce."</p>

  <p>"What I say, is this," said the gentleman with the excessive chins, trying
  to get a hearing by banging his chair arms. "If Charlie goes saying things,
  he ought to back 'em up. That's what I say. I don't mind his sayin' such
  things 't all, but he ought to be prepared to back 'em up."</p>

  <p>"I'll <i>back</i> 'em up all right," said Charlie, with extremely bitter
  emphasis on 'back.' "If the gentleman likes to come Toosday week&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Rot!" chopped in Hoopdriver. "Now."</p>

  <p>"'Ear, 'ear," said the owner of the chins.</p>

  <p>"Never put off till to-morrow, Charlie, what you can do to-day," said the
  man in the velveteen coat.</p>

  <p>"You got to do it, Charlie," said the man in gaiters. "It's no good."</p>

  <p>"It's like this," said Charlie, appealing to everyone except Hoopdriver.
  "Here's me, got to take in her ladyship's dinner to-morrow night. How should
  I look with a black eye? And going round with the carriage with a split
  lip?"</p>

  <p>"If you don't want your face sp'iled, Charlie, why don't you keep your
  mouth shut?" said the person in gaiters.</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Mr. Hoopdriver, driving it home with great fierceness.
  "Why don't you shut your ugly mouth?"</p>

  <p>"It's as much as my situation's worth," protested Charlie.</p>

  <p>"You should have thought of that before," said Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>"There's no occasion to be so thunderin' 'ot about it. I only meant the
  thing joking," said Charlie. "<i>As</i> one gentleman to another, I'm very
  sorry if the gentleman's annoyed&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Everybody began to speak at once. Mr. Hoopdriver twirled his moustache. He
  felt that Charlie's recognition of his gentlemanliness was at any rate a
  redeeming feature. But it became his pose to ride hard and heavy over the
  routed fo c. He shouted some insulting phrase over the tumult.</p>

  <p>"You're regular abject," the man in gaiters was saying to Charlie.</p>

  <p>More confusion.</p>

  <p>"Only don't think I'm afraid,&mdash;not of a spindle-legged cuss like him
  shouted Charlie. "Because I ain't."</p>

  <p>"Change of front," thought Hoopdriver, a little startled. "Where are we
  going?"</p>

  <p>"Don't sit there and be abusive," said the man in velveteen. "He's offered
  to hit you, and if I was him, I'd hit you now."</p>

  <p>"All right, then," said Charlie, with a sudden change of front and
  springing to his feet. "If I must, I must. Now, then!" At that, Hoopdriver,
  the child of Fate, rose too, with a horrible sense that his internal monitor
  was right. Things had taken a turn. He had made a mess of it, and now there
  was nothing for it, so far as he could see, but to hit the man at once. He
  and Charlie stood six feet apart, with a table between, both very breathless
  and fierce. A vulgar fight in a public-house, and with what was only too
  palpably a footman! Good Heavens! And this was the dignified, scornful
  remonstrance! How the juice had it all happened? Go round the table at him, I
  suppose. But before the brawl could achieve itself, the man in gaiters
  intervened. "Not here," he said, stepping between the antagonists. Everyone
  was standing up.</p>

  <p>"Charlie's artful," said the little man with the beard.</p>

  <p>"Buller's yard," said the man with the gaiters, taking the control of the
  entire affair with the easy readiness of an accomplished practitioner. "If
  the gentleman <i>don't</i> mind." Buller's yard, it seemed, was the very
  place. "We'll do the thing regular and decent, if you please." And before he
  completely realized what was happening, Hoopdriver was being marched out
  through the back premises of the inn, to the first and only fight with fists
  that was ever to glorify his life.</p>

  <p>Outwardly, so far as the intermittent moonlight showed, Mr. Hoopdriver was
  quietly but eagerly prepared to fight. But inwardly he was a chaos of
  conflicting purposes. It was extraordinary how things happened. One remark
  had trod so closely on the heels of another, that he had had the greatest
  difficulty in following the development of the business. He distinctly
  remembered himself walking across from one room to the other,&mdash;a
  dignified, even an aristocratic figure, primed with considered eloquence,
  intent upon a scathing remonstrance to these wretched yokels, regarding their
  manners. Then incident had flickered into incident until here he was out in a
  moonlit lane,&mdash;a slight, dark figure in a group of larger, indistinct
  figures,&mdash;marching in a quiet, business-like way towards some unknown
  horror at Buller's yard. Fists! It was astonishing. It was terrible! In front
  of him was the pallid figure of Charles, and he saw that the man in gaiters
  held Charles kindly but firmly by the arm.</p>

  <p>"It's blasted rot," Charles was saying, "getting up a fight just for a
  thing like that; all very well for 'im. 'E's got 'is 'olidays; 'e 'asn't no
  blessed dinner to take up to-morrow night like I 'ave.&mdash;No need to numb
  my arm, <i>is</i> there?"</p>

  <p>They went into Buller's yard through gates. There were sheds in Buller's
  yard&mdash;sheds of mystery that the moonlight could not solve&mdash;a smell
  of cows, and a pump stood out clear and black, throwing a clear black shadow
  on the whitewashed wall. And here it was his face was to be battered to a
  pulp. He knew this was the uttermost folly, to stand up here and be pounded,
  but the way out of it was beyond his imagining. Yet afterwards&mdash;? Could
  he ever face her again? He patted his Norfolk jacket and took his ground with
  his back to the gate. How did one square? So? Suppose one were to turn and
  run even now, run straight back to the inn and lock himself into his bedroom?
  They couldn't make, him come out&mdash;anyhow. He could prosecute them for
  assault if they did. How did one set about prosecuting for assault? He saw
  Charles, with his face ghastly white under the moon, squaring in front of
  him.</p>

  <p>He caught a blow on the arm and gave ground. Charles pressed him. Then he
  hit with his right and with the violence of despair. It was a hit of his own
  devising,&mdash;an impromptu,&mdash;but it chanced to coincide with the
  regulation hook hit at the head. He perceived with a leap of exultation that
  the thing his fist had met was the jawbone of Charles. It was the sole gleam
  of pleasure he experienced during the fight, and it was quite momentary. He
  had hardly got home upon Charles before he was struck in the chest and
  whirled backward. He had the greatest difficulty in keeping his feet. He felt
  that his heart was smashed flat. "Gord darm!" said somebody, dancing toe in
  hand somewhere behind him. As Mr. Hoopdriver staggered, Charles gave a loud
  and fear-compelling cry. He seemed to tower over Hoopdriver in the moonlight.
  Both his fists were whirling. It was annihilation coming&mdash;no less. Mr.
  Hoopdriver ducked perhaps and certainly gave ground to the right, hit, and
  missed. Charles swept round to the left, missing generously. A blow glanced
  over Mr. Hoopdriver's left ear, and the flanking movement was completed.
  Another blow behind the ear. Heaven and earth spun furiously round Mr.
  Hoopdriver, and then he became aware of a figure in a light suit shooting
  violently through an open gate into the night. The man in gaiters sprang
  forward past Mr. Hoopdriver, but too late to intercept the fugitive. There
  were shouts, laughter, and Mr. Hoopdriver, still solemnly squaring, realized
  the great and wonderful truth&mdash;Charles had fled. He, Hoopdriver, had
  fought and, by all the rules of war, had won.</p>

  <p class="caption">Mr. Hoopdriver, still solemnly squaring...</p><br>

  <p>"That was a pretty cut under the jaw you gave him," the toothless little
  man with the beard was remarking in an unexpectedly friendly manner.</p>

  <p>"The fact of it is," said Mr. Hoopdriver, sitting beside the road to
  Salisbury, and with the sound of distant church bells in his cars, "I had to
  give the fellow a lesson; simply had to."</p>

  <p>"It seems so dreadful that you should have to knock people about," said
  Jessie.</p>

  <p>"These louts get unbearable," said Mr. Hoopdriver. "If now and then we
  didn't give them a lesson,&mdash;well, a lady cyclist in the roads would be
  an impossibility."</p>

  <p>"I suppose every woman shrinks from violence," said Jessie. "I suppose men
  ARE braver&mdash;in a way&mdash;than women. It seems to me-I can't imagine
  -how one could bring oneself to face a roomful of rough characters, pick out
  the bravest, and. give him an exemplary thrashing. I quail at the idea. I
  thought only Ouida's guardsmen did things like that."</p>

  <p>"It was nothing more than my juty&mdash;as a gentleman," said Mr.
  Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>"But to walk straight into the face of danger!"</p>

  <p>"It's habit," said Mr. Hoopdriver, quite modestly, flicking off a particle
  of cigarette ash that had settled on his knee.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="chap23"
     name="chap23">XXIII. &mdash; THE ABASEMENT OF MR. HOOPDRIVER</a></h2>

  <h3>§ XXXIII</h3>

  <p class="first">On Monday morning the two fugitives found themselves
  breakfasting at the Golden Pheasant in Blandford. They were in the course of
  an elaborate doubling movement through Dorsetshire towards Ringwood, where
  Jessie anticipated an answer from her schoolmistress friend. By this time
  they had been nearly sixty hours together, and you will understand that Mr.
  Hoopdriver's feelings had undergone a considerable intensification and
  development. At first Jessie had been only an impressionist sketch upon his
  mind, something feminine, active, and dazzling, something emphatically "above
  " him, cast into his company by a kindly fate. His chief idea, at the outset,
  as you know, had been to live up to her level, by pretending to be more
  exceptional, more wealthy, better educated, and, above all, better born than
  he was. His knowledge of the feminine mind was almost entirely derived from
  the young ladies he had met in business, and in that class (as in military
  society and among gentlemen's servants) the good old tradition of a brutal
  social exclusiveness is still religiously preserved. He had an almost
  intolerable dread of her thinking him a I bounder.' Later he began to
  perceive the distinction of her idiosyncracies. Coupled with a magnificent
  want of experience was a splendid enthusiasm for abstract views of the most
  advanced description, and her strength of conviction completely carried
  Hoopdriver away. She was going to Live her Own Life, with emphasis, and Mr.
  Hoopdriver was profoundly stirred to similar resolves. So soon as he grasped
  the tenor of her views, he perceived that he himself had thought as much from
  his earliest years. "Of course," he remarked, in a flash of sexual pride, "a
  man is freer than a woman. End in the Colonies, y'know, there isn't half the
  Conventionality you find in society in this country."</p>

  <p>He made one or two essays in the display of unconventionality, and was
  quite unaware that he impressed her as a narrow-minded person. He suppressed
  the habits of years and made no proposal to go to church. He discussed
  church-going in a liberal spirit. "It's jest a habit," he said, "jest a
  custom. I don't see what good it does you at all, really." And he made a lot
  of excellent jokes at the chimney-pot hat, jokes he had read in the Globe
  'turnovers' on that subject. But he showed his gentle breeding by keeping his
  gloves on all through the Sunday's ride, and ostentatiously throwing away
  more than half a cigarette when they passed a church whose congregation was
  gathering for afternoon service. He cautiously avoided literary topics,
  except by way of compliment, seeing that she was presently to be writing
  books.</p>

  <p>It was on Jessie's initiative that they attended service in the old-
  fashioned gallery of Blandford church. Jessie's conscience, I may perhaps
  tell you, was now suffering the severest twinges. She perceived clearly that
  things were not working out quite along the lines she had designed-. She had
  read her Olive Schreiner and George Egerton, and so forth, with all the want
  of perfect comprehension of one who is still emotionally a girl. She knew the
  thing to do was to have a flat and to go to the British Museum and write
  leading articles for the daily p,tpers until something better came along. If
  Bechamel (detestable person) had kept his promises, instead of behaving with
  unspeakable horridness, all would have been well. Now her only hope was that
  liberal-minded woman, Miss Mergle, who, a year ago, had sent her out, highly
  educated, into the world. Miss Mergle had told her at parting to live
  fearlessly and truly, and had further given her a volume of Emerson's Essays
  and Motley's "Dutch Republic," to help her through the rapids of
  adolescence.</p>

  <p>Jessie's feelings for her stepmother's household at Surbiton amounted to
  an active detestation. There are no graver or more solemn women in the world
  than these clever girls whose scholastic advancement has retarded their
  feminine coquetry. In spite of the advanced tone of 'Thomas Plantagenet's'
  antimarital novel, Jessie had speedily seen through that amiable woman's
  amiable defences. The variety of pose necessitated by the corps of 'Men'
  annoyed her to an altogether unreasonable degree. To return to this life of
  ridiculous unreality&mdash;unconditional capitulation to 'Conventionality'
  was an exasperating prospect. Yet what else was there to do? You will
  understand, therefore, that at times she was moody (and Mr. Hoopdriver
  respectfully silent and attentive) and at times inclined to eloquent
  denunciation of the existing order of things. She was a Socialist, Hoopdriver
  learnt, and he gave a vague intimation that he went further, intending,
  thereby, no less than the horrors of anarchism. He would have owned up to the
  destruction of the Winter Palace indeed, had he had the faintest idea where
  the Winter Palace was, and had his assurance amounted to certainty that the
  Winter Palace was destroyed. He agreed with her cordially that the position
  of women was intolerable, but checked himself on the' verge of the
  proposition that a girl ought not to expect a fellow to hand down boxes for
  her when he was getting the 'swap' from a customer. It was Jessie's
  preoccupation with her own perplexities, no doubt, that delayed the unveiling
  of Mr. Hoopdriver all through Saturday and Sunday. Once or twice, however,
  there were incidents that put him about terribly&mdash;even questions that
  savoured of suspicion.</p>

  <p>On Sunday night, for no conceivable reason, an unwonted wakefulness came
  upon him. Unaccountably he realised he was a contemptible liar, All through
  the small hours of Monday he reviewed the tale of his falsehoods, and when he
  tried to turn his mind from that, the financial problem suddenly rose upon
  him. He heard two o'clock strike, and three. It is odd how unhappy some of us
  are at times, when we are at our happiest.</p><br>

  <h3>§ XXXIV</h3>

  <p class="first">"Good morning, Madam," said Hoopdriver, as Jessie came into
  the breakfast room of the Golden Pheasant on Monday morning, and he smiled,
  bowed, rubbed his hands together, and pulled out a chair for her, and rubbed
  his hands again.</p>

  <p>She stopped abruptly, with a puzzled expression on her face. "Where
  <i>have</i> I seen that before?" she said.</p>

  <p>"The chair?" said Hoopdriver, flushing.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;the attitude."</p>

  <p>She came forward and shook hands with him, looking the while curiously
  into his face. "And&mdash;Madam?"</p>

  <p>"It's a habit," said Mr. Hoopdriver, guiltily. "A bad habit. Calling
  ladies Madam. You must put it down to our colonial roughness. Out there up
  country&mdash;y'know&mdash;the ladies&mdash;so rare&mdash;we call 'em all
  Madam."</p>

  <p>"You <i>have</i> some funny habits, brother Chris," said Jessie. "Before
  you sell your diamond shares and go into society, as you say, and stand for
  Parliament&mdash;What a fine thing it is to be a man!&mdash;you must cure
  yourself. That habit of bowing as you do, and rubbing your hands, and looking
  expectant."</p>

  <p>"It's a habit."</p>

  <p>"I know. But I don't think it a good one. You don't mind my telling
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Not a bit. I'm grateful."</p>

  <p>"I'm blessed or afflicted with a trick of observation," said Jessie,
  looking at the breakfast table. Mr. Hoopdriver put his hand to his moustache
  and then, thinking this might be another habit, checked his arm and stuck his
  hand into his pocket. He felt juiced awkward, to use his private formula.
  Jessie's eye wandered to the armchair, where a piece of binding was loose,
  and, possibly to carry out her theory of an observant disposition, she turned
  and asked him for a pin.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoopdriver's hand fluttered instinctively to his lappel, and there,
  planted by habit, were a couple of stray pins he had impounded.</p>

  <p>"What an odd place to put pins!" exclaimed Jessie, taking it.</p>

  <p>"It's 'andy," said Mr. Hoopdriver. "I saw a chap in a shop do it
  once."</p>

  <p>"You must have a careful disposition," she said, over her shoulder,
  kneeling down to the chair.</p>

  <p>"In the centre of Africa&mdash;up country, that is&mdash;one learns to
  value pins," said Mr. Hoopdriver, after a perceptible pause. "There weren't
  over many pins in Africa. They don't lie about on the ground there." His face
  was now in a fine, red glow. Where would the draper break out next? He thrust
  his hands into his coat pockets, then took one out again, furtively removed
  the second pin and dropped it behind him gently. It fell with a loud 'ping'
  on the fender. Happily she made no remark, being preoccupied with the binding
  of the chair.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoopdriver, instead of sitting down, went up to the table and stood
  against it, with his finger-tips upon the cloth. They were keeping breakfast
  a tremendous time. He took up his rolled serviette looked closely and
  scrutinisingly at the ring, then put his hand under the fold of the napkin
  and examined the texture, and put the thing down again. Then he had a vague
  impulse to finger his hollow wisdom tooth&mdash;happily checked. He suddenly
  discovered he was standing as if the table was a counter, and sat down
  forthwith. He drummed with his hand on the table. He felt dreadfully hot and
  self-conscious.</p>

  <p>"Breakfast is late," said Jessie, standing up.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Conversation was slack. Jessie wanted to know the distance to Ringwood.
  Then silence fell again.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoopdriver, very uncomfortable and studying an easy bearing, looked
  again at the breakfast things and then idly lifted the corner of the
  tablecloth on the ends of his fingers, and regarded it. "Fifteen three," he
  thought, privately.</p>

  <p>"Why do you do that?" said Jessie.</p>

  <p><i>"What?"</i> said Hoopdriver, dropping the tablecloth convulsively.</p>

  <p>"Look at the cloth like that. I saw you do it yesterday, too."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoopdriver's face became quite a bright red. He began pulling his
  moustache nervously. "I know," he said. "I know. It's a queer habit, I know.
  But out there, you know, there's native servants, you know, and&mdash;it's a
  queer thing to talk about&mdash;but one has to look at things to see, don't
  y'know, whether they're quite clean or not. It's got to be a habit."</p>

  <p>"How odd!" said Jessie.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it?" mumbled Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>"If I were a Sherlock Holmes," said Jessie, "I suppose I could have told
  you were a colonial from little things like that. But anyhow, I guessed it,
  didn't I?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Hoopdriver, in a melancholy tone, "you guessed it."</p>

  <p>Why not seize the opportunity for a neat confession, and add, "unhappily
  in this case you guessed wrong." Did she suspect? Then, at the psychological
  moment, the girl bumped the door open with her tray and brought in the coffee
  and scrambled eggs.</p>

  <p>"I am rather lucky with my intuitions, sometimes," said Jessie.</p>

  <p>Remorse that had been accumulating in his mind for two days surged to the
  top of his mind. What a shabby liar he was!</p>

  <p>And, besides, he must sooner or later, inevitably, give himself
  away.</p><br>

  <h3>§ XXXV</h3>

  <p class="first">Mr. Hoopdriver helped the eggs and then, instead of
  beginning, sat with his cheek on his hand, watching Jessie pour out the
  coffee. His ears were a bright red, and his eyes bright. He took his coffee
  cup clumsily, cleared his throat, suddenly leant back in his chair, and
  thrust his hands deep into his pockets. "I'll do it," he said aloud.</p>

  <p>"Do what?" said Jessie, looking up in surprise over the coffee pot. She
  was just beginning her scrambled egg.</p>

  <p>"Own up."</p>

  <p>"Own what?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Milton&mdash;I'm a liar." He put his head on one side and regarded
  her with a frown of tremendous resolution. Then in measured accents, and
  moving his head slowly from side to side, he announced, "Ay'm a
  deraper."</p>

  </div>

  <p class="caption">"Miss Milton &mdash; I'm a liar."</p><br>

  <p>"You're a draper? I thought&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You thought wrong. But it's bound to come up. Pins, attitude, habits
  &mdash;It's plain enough.</p>

  <p>"I'm a draper's assistant let out for a ten-days holiday. Jest a draper's
  assistant. Not much, is it? A counter-jumper."</p>

  <p>"A draper's assistant isn't a position to be ashamed of," she said,
  recovering, and not quite understanding yet what this all meant.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is," he said, "for a man, in this country now. To be just another
  man's hand, as I am. To have to wear what clothes you are told, and go to
  church to please customers, and work&mdash;There's no other kind of men stand
  such hours. A drunken bricklayer's a king to it."</p>

  <p>"But why are you telling me this now?"</p>

  <p>"It's important you should know at once."</p>

  <p>"But, Mr. Benson&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That isn't all. If you don't mind my speaking about myself a bit, there's
  a few things I'd like to tell you. I can't go on deceiving you. My name's not
  Benson. <i>Why</i> I told you Benson, I <i>don't</i> know. Except that I'm a
  kind of fool. Well&mdash;I wanted somehow to seem more than I was. My name's
  Hoopdriver."</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"And that about South Africa&mdash;and that lion."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Lies."</p>

  <p>"Lies!"</p>

  <p>And the discovery of diamonds on the ostrich farm. Lies too. And all the
  reminiscences of the giraffes&mdash;lies too. I never rode on no giraffes.
  I'd be afraid."</p>

  <p>He looked at her with a kind of sullen satisfaction. He had eased his
  conscience, anyhow. She regarded him in infinite perplexity. This was a new
  side altogether to the man. "But <i>why</i>," she began.</p>

  <p>"Why did I tell you such things? <i>I</i> don't know. Silly sort of chap,
  I expect. I suppose I wanted to impress you. But somehow, now, I want you to
  know the truth."</p>

  <p>Silence. Breakfast untouched. "I thought I'd tell you," said Mr.
  Hoopdriver. "I suppose it's snobbishness and all that kind of thing, as much
  as anything. I lay awake pretty near all last night thinking about myself;
  thinking what a got-up imitation of a man I was, and all that."</p>

  <p>"And you haven't any diamond shares, and you are not going into
  Parliament, and you're not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All Lies," said Hoopdriver, in a sepulchral voice. "Lies from beginning
  to end. 'Ow I came to tell 'em I <i>don't</i> know."</p>

  <p>She stared at him blankly.</p>

  <p>"I never set eyes on Africa in my life," said Mr. Hoopdriver, completing
  the confession. Then he pulled his right hand from his pocket, and with the
  nonchalance of one to whom the bitterness of death is passed, began to drink
  his coffee.</p>

  <p>"It's a little surprising," began Jessie, vaguely.</p>

  <p>"Think it over," said Mr. Hoopdriver. "I'm sorry from the bottom of my
  heart."</p>

  <p>And then breakfast proceeded in silence. Jessie ate very little, and
  seemed lost in thought. Mr. Hoopdriver was so overcome by contrition and
  anxiety that he consumed an extraordinarily large breakfast out of pure
  nervousness, and ate his scrambled eggs for the most part with the spoon that
  belonged properly to the marmalade. His eyes were gloomily downcast. She
  glanced at him through her eyelashes. Once or twice she struggled with
  laughter, once or twice she seemed to be indignant.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what to think," she said at last. "I don't know what to make
  of you&mdash;brother Chris. I thought, do you know? that you were perfectly
  honest. And somehow&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"I think so still."</p>

  <p>"Honest&mdash;with all those lies!"</p>

  <p>"I wonder."</p>

  <p>"I don't," said Mr. Hoopdriver. "I'm fair ashamed of myself. But anyhow
  &mdash;I've stopped deceiving you."</p>

  <p>"I <i>thought</i>," said the Young Lady in Grey, "that story of the
  lion&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Lord!" said Mr. Hoopdriver. "Don't remind me of <i>that</i>."</p>

  <p>"I thought, somehow, I <i>felt</i>, that the things you said didn't ring
  quite true." She suddenly broke out in laughter, at the expression of his
  face. "Of <i>course</i> you are honest," she said. "How could I ever doubt
  it? As if <i>I</i> had never pretended! I see it all now."</p>

  <p>Abruptly she rose, and extended her hand across the breakfast things. He
  looked at her doubtfully, and saw the dancing friendliness in her eyes. He
  scarcely understood at first. He rose, holding the marmalade spoon, and took
  her proffered hand with abject humility. "Lord," he broke out, "if you aren't
  enough&mdash;but there!"</p>

  <p>"I see it all now." A brilliant inspiration had suddenly obscured her
  humour. She sat down suddenly, and he sat down too. "You did it," she said,
  "because you wanted to help me. And you thought I was too Conventional to
  take help from one I might think my social inferior."</p>

  <p>"That was partly it," said Mr. Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>"How you misunderstood me!" she said.</p>

  <p>"You don't mind?"</p>

  <p>"It was noble of you. But I am sorry," she said, "you should think me
  likely to be ashamed of you because you follow a decent trade."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know at first, you see," said Mr. Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>And he submitted meekly to a restoration of his self-respect. He was as
  useful a citizen as could be,&mdash;it was proposed and carried,&mdash;and
  his lying was of the noblest. And so the breakfast concluded much more
  happily than his brightest expectation, and they rode out of ruddy little
  Blandford as though no shadow of any sort had come between them.</p><br>

  <h3>§ XXXVI</h3>

  <p class="first">As they were sitting by the roadside among the pine trees
  half-way up a stretch of hill between Wimborne and Ringwood, however, Mr.
  Hoopdriver reopened the question of his worldly position.</p>

  <p>"Ju think," he began abruptly, removing a meditative cigarette from his
  mouth, "that a draper's shopman IS a decent citizen?"</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"When he puts people off with what they don't quite want, for
  instance?"</p>

  <p>"Need he do that?"</p>

  <p>"Salesmanship," said Hoopdriver. "Wouldn't get a crib if he didn't.
  &mdash;It's no good your arguing. It's not a particularly honest nor a
  particularly useful trade; it's not very high up; there's no freedom and no
  leisure&mdash;seven to eight-thirty every day in the week; don't leave much
  edge to live on, does it?&mdash;real workmen laugh at us and educated chaps
  like bank clerks and solicitors' clerks look down on us. You look respectable
  outside, and inside you are packed in dormitories like convicts, fed on bread
  and butter and bullied like slaves. You're just superior enough to feel that
  you're not superior. Without capital there's no prospects; one draper in a
  hundred don't even earn enough to marry on; and if he <i>does</i> marry, his
  G.V. can just use him to black boots if he likes, and he daren't put his back
  up. That's drapery! And you tell me to be contented. Would <i>you</i> be
  contented if you was a shop girl?"</p>

  <p>She did not answer. She looked at him with distress in her brown eyes, and
  he remained gloomily in possession of the field.</p>

  <p>Presently he spoke. "I've been thinking," he said, and stopped.</p>

  <p>She turned her face, resting her cheek on the palm of her hand. There was
  a light in her eyes that made the expression of them tender. Mr. Hoopdriver
  had not looked in her face while he had talked. He had regarded the grass,
  and pointed his remarks with redknuckled hands held open and palms upwards.
  Now they hung limply over his knees.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="caption">Now they hung limply over his knees...</p><br>

  <p>"Well?" she said.</p>

  <p>"I was thinking it this morning," said Mr. Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"Of course it's silly."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"It's like this. I'm twenty-three, about. I had my schooling all right to
  fifteen, say. Well, that leaves me eight years behind.&mdash;Is it too late?
  I wasn't so backward. I did algebra, and Latin up to auxiliary verbs, and
  French genders. I got a kind of grounding."</p>

  <p>"And now you mean, should you go on working?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mr. Hoopdriver. "That's it. You can't do much at drapery
  without capital, you know. But if I could get really educated. I've thought
  sometimes..."</p>

  <p>"Why not? said the Young Lady in Grey.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoopdriver was surprised to see it in that light. "You think?" he
  said. "Of course. You are a Man. You are free&mdash;" She warmed. "I wish I
  were you to have the chance of that struggle."</p>

  <p>"Am I Man <i>enough</i>?" said Mr. Hoopdriver aloud, but addressing
  himself. "There's that eight years," he said to her.</p>

  <p>"You can make it up. What you call educated men&mdash;They're not going
  on. You can catch them. They are quite satisfied. Playing golf, and thinking
  of clever things to say to women like my stepmother, and dining out. You're
  in front of them already in one thing. They think they know everything. You
  don't. And they know such little things."</p>

  <p>"Lord!" said Mr. Hoopdriver. "How you encourage a fellow!"</p>

  <p>"If I could only help you," she said, and left an eloquent hiatus. He
  became pensive again.</p>

  <p>"It's pretty evident you don't think much of a draper," he said
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>Another interval. "Hundreds of men," she said, "have come from the very
  lowest ranks of life. There was Burns, a ploughman; and Hugh Miller, a
  stonemason; and plenty of others. Dodsley was a footman&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But drapers! We're too sort of shabby genteel to rise. Our coats and
  cuffs might get crumpled&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wasn't there a Clarke who wrote theology? He was a draper."</p>

  <p>"There was one started a sewing cotton, the only one I ever heard tell
  of."</p>

  <p>"Have you ever read 'Hearts Insurgent'?"</p>

  <p>"Never," said Mr. Hoopdriver. He did not wait for her context, but
  suddenly broke out with an account of his literary requirements. "The fact is
  &mdash;I've read precious little. One don't get much of a chance, situated as
  I am. We have a library at business, and I've gone through that. Most Besant
  I've read, and a lot of Mrs. Braddon's and Rider Haggard and Marie Corelli
  &mdash;and, well&mdash;a Ouida or so. They're good stories, of course, and
  first-class writers, but they didn't seem to have much to do with me. But
  there's heaps of books one hears talked about, I <i>haven't</i> read."</p>

  <p>"Don't you read any other books but novels?"</p>

  <p>"Scarcely ever. One gets tired after business, and you can't get the
  books. I have been to some extension lectures, of course, 'Lizabethan
  Dramatists,' it was, but it seemed a little high-flown, you know. And I went
  and did wood-carving at the same place. But it didn't seem leading nowhere,
  and I cut my thumb and chucked it."</p>

  <p>He made a depressing spectacle, with his face anxious and his hands limp.
  "It makes me sick," he said, "to think how I've been fooled with. My old
  schoolmaster ought to have a juiced <i>hiding</i>. He's a thief. He pretended
  to undertake to make a man of me, and be's stole twenty-three years of my
  life, filled me up with scraps and sweepings. Here I am! I don't <i>know</i>
  anything, and I can't <i>do</i> anything, and all the learning time is
  over."</p>

  <p>"Is it?" she said; but he did not seem to hear her. "My o' people didn't
  know any better, and went and paid thirty pounds premium&mdash;thirty pounds
  down to have me made <i>this</i>. The G.V. promised to teach me the trade,
  and he never taught me anything but to be a Hand. It's the way they do with
  draper's apprentices. If every swindler was locked up&mdash;well, you'd have
  nowhere to buy tape and cotton. It's all very well to bring up Burns and
  those chaps, but I'm not that make. Yet I'm not such muck that I might not
  have been better&mdash;with teaching. I wonder what the chaps who sneer and
  laugh at such as me would be if they'd been fooled about as I've been. At
  twenty-three&mdash;it's a long start."</p>

  <p>He looked up with a wintry smile, a sadder and wiser Hoopdriver indeed
  than him of the glorious imaginings. "It's <i>you</i> done this," he said.
  "You're real. And it sets me thinking what I really am, and what I might have
  been. Suppose it was all different&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"<i>Make</i> it different."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Work</i>. Stop playing at life. Face it like a man."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Hoopdriver, glancing at her out of the corners of his eyes.
  "And even then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No! It's not much good. I'm beginning too late."</p>

  <p>And there, in blankly thoughtful silence, that conversation
ended.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="chap24"
     name="chap24">XXIV. &mdash; IN THE NEW FOREST</a></h2>

  <h3>§ XXXVII</h3>

  <p class="first">At Ringwood they lunched, and Jessie met with a
  disappointment. There was no letter for her at the post office. Opposite the
  hotel, The Chequered Career, was a machine shop with a conspicuously
  second-hand Marlborough Club tandem tricycle displayed in the window,
  together with the announcement that bicycles and tricycles were on hire
  within. The establishment was impressed on Mr. Hoopdriver's mind by the
  proprietor's action in coming across the road and narrowly inspecting their
  machines. His action revived a number of disagreeable impressions, but,
  happily, came to nothing. While they were still lunching, a tall clergyman,
  with a heated face, entered the room and sat down at the table next to
  theirs. He was in a kind of holiday costume; that is to say, he had a more
  than usually high collar, fastened behind and rather the worse for the
  weather, and his long-tail coat had been replaced by a black jacket of quite
  remarkable brevity. He had faded brown shoes on his feet, his trouser legs
  were grey with dust, and he wore a hat of piebald straw in the place of the
  customary soft felt. He was evidently socially inclined.</p>

  <p>"A most charming day, sir," he said, in a ringing tenor.</p>

  <p>"Charming," said Mr. Hoopdriver, over a portion of pie.</p>

  <p>"You are, I perceive, cycling through this delightful country," said the
  clergyman.</p>

  <p>"Touring," explained Mr. Hoopdriver. "I can imagine that, with a properly
  oiled machine, there can be no easier nor pleasanter way of seeing the
  country."</p>

  <p>"No," said Mr. Hoopdriver; "it isn't half a bad. way of getting
  about."</p>

  <p>"For a young and newly married couple, a tandem bicycle must be, I should
  imagine, a delightful bond."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," said Mr. Hoopdriver, reddening a little.</p>

  <p>"Do you ride a tandem?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;we're separate," said Mr. Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>"The motion through the air is indisputably of a very exhilarating
  description." With that decision, the clergyman turned to give his orders to
  the attendant, in a firm, authoritative voice, for a cup of tea, two gelatine
  lozenges, bread and butter, salad, and pie to follow. "The gelatine lozenges
  I must have. I require them to precipitate the tannin in my tea," he remarked
  to the room at large, and folding his hands, remained for some time with his
  chin thereon, staring fixedly at a little picture over Mr. Hoopdriver's
  head.</p>

  <p>"I myself am a cyclist," said the clergyman, descending suddenly upon Mr.
  Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" said Mr. Hoopdriver, attacking the moustache. "What machine, may
  I ask?"</p>

  <p>"I have recently become possessed of a tricycle. A bicycle is, I regret to
  say, considered too&mdash;how shall I put it?&mdash;flippant by my
  parishioners. So I have a tricycle. I have just been hauling it
  hither."</p>

    <p><a id="pic35"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>
  <br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1303441h-images/WOC35.jpg"
         alt="A bicycle is considered too flippant...">
  </div>

  <p class="caption">"A bicycle is considered too flippant by my
  parishoners."</p><br>

  <p>"Hauling!" said Jessie, surprised.</p>

  <p>"With a shoe lace. And partly carrying it on my back."</p>

  <p>The pause was unexpected. Jessie had some trouble with a crumb. Mr.
  Hoopdriver's face passed through several phases of surprise. Then he saw the
  explanation. "Had an accident?"</p>

  <p>"I can hardly call it an accident. The wheels suddenly refused to go
  round. I found myself about five miles from here with an absolutely immobile
  machine."</p>

  <p>"Ow!" said Mr. Hoopdriver, trying to seem intelligent, and Jessie glanced
  at this insane person.</p>

  <p>"It appears," said the clergyman, satisfied with the effect he had
  created, "that my man carefully washed out the bearings with paraffin, and
  let the machine dry without oiling it again. The consequence was that they
  became heated to a considerable temperature and jammed. Even at the outset
  the machine ran stiffly as well as noisily, and I, being inclined to ascribe
  this stiffness to my own lassitude, merely redoubled my exertions."</p>

  <p>"'Ot work all round," said Mr. Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>"You could scarcely put it more appropriately. It is my rule of life to do
  whatever I find to do with all my might. I believe, indeed, that the bearings
  became red hot. Finally one of the wheels jammed together. A side wheel it
  was, so that its stoppage necessitated an inversion of the entire
  apparatus,&mdash;an inversion in which I participated."</p>

  <p>"Meaning, that you went over?" said Mr. Hoopdriver, suddenly much
  amused.</p>

  <p>"Precisely. And not brooking my defeat, I suffered repeatedly. You may
  understand, perhaps, a natural impatience. I expostulated&mdash;playfully, of
  course. Happily the road was not overlooked. Finally, the entire apparatus
  became rigid, and I abandoned the unequal contest. For all practical purposes
  the tricycle was no better than a heavy chair without castors. It was a case
  of hauling or carrying."</p>

  <p>The clergyman's nutriment appeared in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"Five miles," said the clergyman. He began at once to eat bread and butter
  vigorously. "Happily," he said, "I am an eupeptic, energetic sort of person
  on principle. I would all men were likewise."</p>

  <p>"It's the best way," agreed Mr. Hoopdriver, and the conversation gave
  precedence to bread and butter.</p>

  <p>"Gelatine," said the clergyman, presently, stirring his tea thoughtfully,
  "precipitates the tannin in one's tea and renders it easy of digestion."</p>

  <p>"That's a useful sort of thing to know," said Mr. Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>"You are altogether welcome," said the clergyman, biting generously at two
  pieces of bread and butter folded together.</p>

  <p>In the afternoon our two wanderers rode on at an easy pace towards Stoney
  Cross. Conversation languished, the topic of South Africa being in abeyance.
  Mr. Hoopdriver was silenced by disagreeable thoughts. He had changed the last
  sovereign at Ringwood. The fact had come upon him suddenly. Now too late he
  was reflecting upon his resources. There was twenty pounds or more in the
  post office savings bank in Putney, but his book was locked up in his box at
  the Antrobus establishment. Else this infatuated man would certainly have
  surreptitiously withdrawn the entire sum in order to prolong these
  journeyings even for a few days. As it was, the shadow of the end fell across
  his happiness. Strangely enough, in spite of his anxiety and the morning's
  collapse, he was still in a curious emotional state that was certainly not
  misery. He was forgetting his imaginings and posings, forgetting himself
  altogether in his growing appreciation of his companion. The most tangible
  trouble in his mind was the necessity of breaking the matter to her.</p>

  <p>A long stretch up hill tired them long before Stoney Cross was reached,
  and they dismounted and sat under the shade of a little oak tree. Near the
  crest the road looped on itself, so that, looking back, it sloped below them
  up to the right and then came towards them. About them grew a rich heather
  with stunted oaks on the edge of a deep ditch along the roadside, and this
  road was sandy; below the steepness of the hill, however, it was grey and
  barred with shadows, for there the trees clustered thick and tall. Mr.
  Hoopdriver fumbled clumsily with his cigarettes.</p>

  <p>"There's a thing I got to tell you," he said, trying to be perfectly
  calm.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" she said.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to jest discuss your plans a bit, y'know."</p>

  <p>"I'm very unsettled," said Jessie. "You are thinking of writing
  Books?"</p>

  <p>"Or doing journalism, or teaching, or something like that."</p>

  <p>"And keeping yourself independent of your stepmother?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"How long'd it take now, to get anything of that sort to do?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know at all. I believe there are a great many women journalists
  and sanitary inspectors, and black-and-white artists. But I suppose it takes
  time. Women, you know, edit most papers nowadays, George Egerton says. I
  ought, I suppose, to communicate with a literary agent."</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Hoopdriver, "it's very suitable work. Not being heavy
  like the drapery."</p>

  <p>"There's heavy brain labour, you must remember."</p>

  <p>"That wouldn't hurt <i>you</i>," said Mr. Hoopdriver, turning a
  compliment.</p>

  <p>"It's like this," he said, ending a pause. "It's a juiced nuisance
  alluding to these matters, but&mdash;we got very little more money."</p>

  <p>He perceived that Jessie started, though he did not look at her. "I was
  counting, of course, on your friend's writing and your being able to take
  some action to-day." 'Take some action' was a phrase he had learnt at his
  last 'swop.'</p>

  <p>"Money," said Jessie. "I didn't think of money."</p>

  <p>"Hullo! Here's a tandem bicycle," said Mr. Hoopdriver, abruptly, and
  pointing with his cigarette.</p>

  <p>She looked, and saw two little figures emerging from among the trees at
  the foot of the slope. The riders were bowed sternly over their work and made
  a gallant but unsuccessful attempt to take the rise. The machine was
  evidently too highly geared for hill climbing, and presently the rearmost
  rider rose on his saddle and hopped off, leaving his companion to any fate he
  found proper. The foremost rider was a man unused to such machines and
  apparently undecided how to dismount. He wabbled a few yards up the hill with
  a long tail of machine wabbling behind him. Finally, he made an attempt to
  jump off as one does off a single bicycle, hit his boot against the backbone,
  and collapsed heavily, falling on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>She stood up. "Dear me!" she said. "I hope he isn't hurt."</p>

  <p>The second rider went to the assistance of the fallen man.</p>

  <p>Hoopdriver stood up, too. The lank, shaky machine was lifted up and
  wheeled out of the way, and then the fallen rider, being assisted, got up
  slowly and stood rubbing his arm. No serious injury seemed to be done to the
  man, and the couple presently turned their attention to the machine by the
  roadside. They were not in cycling clothes Hoopdriver observed. One wore the
  grotesque raiment for which the Cockney discovery of the game of golf seems
  indirectly blamable. Even at this distance the flopping flatness of his cap,
  the bright brown leather at the top of his calves, and the chequering of his
  stockings were perceptible. The other, the rear rider, was a slender little
  man in grey.</p>

  <p>"Amatoors," said Mr. Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>Jessie stood staring, and a veil of thought dropped over her eyes. She no
  longer regarded the two men who were now tinkering at the machine down below
  there.</p>

  <p>"How much have you?" she said.</p>

  <p>He thrust his right hand into his pocket and produced six coins, counted
  them with his left index finger, and held them out to her. "Thirteen four
  half," said Mr. Hoopdriver. "Every penny."</p>

  <p>"I have half a sovereign," she said. "Our bill wherever we stop&mdash;"
  The hiatus was more eloquent than many words.</p>

  <p>"I never thought of money coming in to stop us like this," said
  Jessie.</p>

  <p>"It's a juiced nuisance."</p>

  <p>"Money," said Jessie. "Is it possible&mdash;Surely! Conventionality! May
  only people of means&mdash;Live their own Lives? I never thought ..."</p>

  <p>Pause.</p>

  <p>"Here's some more cyclists coming," said Mr. Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>The two men were both busy with their bicycle still, but now from among
  the trees emerged the massive bulk of a 'Marlborough Club' tandem, ridden by
  a slender woman in grey and a burly man in ù Norfolk jacket. Following close
  upon this came lank black figure in a piebald straw hat, riding a tricycle of
  antiquated pattern with two large wheels in front. The man in grey remained
  bowed over the bicycle, with his stomach resting on the saddle, but his
  companion stood up and addressed some remark to the tricycle riders. Then it
  seemed as if he pointed up hill to where Mr. Hoopdriver and his companion
  stood side by side. A still odder thing followed; the lady in grey took out
  her handkerchief, appeared to wave it for a moment, and then at a hasty
  motion from her companion the white signal vanished.</p>

  <p>"Surely," said Jessie, peering under her hand. "It's never&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The tandem tricycle began to ascend the hill, quartering elaborately from
  side to side to ease the ascent. It was evident, from his heaving shoulders
  and depressed head, that the burly gentleman was exerting himself. The
  clerical person on the tricycle assumed the shape of a note of interrogation.
  Then on the heels of this procession came a dogcart driven by a man in a
  billycock hat and containing a lady in dark green.</p>

  <p>"Looks like some sort of excursion," said Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>Jessie did not answer. She was still peering under her hand. "Surely," she
  said.</p>

  <p>The clergyman's efforts were becoming convulsive. With a curious jerking
  motion, the tricycle he rode twisted round upon itself, and he partly
  dismounted and partly fell off. He turned his machine up hill again
  immediately and began to wheel it. Then the burly gentleman dismounted, and
  with a courtly attentiveness assisted the lady in grey to alight. There was
  some little difference of opinion as to assistance, she so clearly wished to
  help push. Finally she gave in, and the burly gentleman began impelling the
  machine up hill by his own unaided strength. His face made a dot of brilliant
  colour among the greys and greens at the foot of the hill. The tandem bicycle
  was now, it seems, repaired, and this joined the tail of the procession, its
  riders walking behind the dogcart, from which the lady in green and the
  driver had now descended.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Hoopdriver," said Jessie. "Those people&mdash;I'm almost
  sure&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Lord!" said Mr. Hoopdriver, reading the rest in her face, and he turned
  to pick up his machine at once. Then he dropped it and assisted her to
  mount.</p>

  <p>At the sight of Jessie mounting against the sky line the people coming up
  the hill suddenly became excited and ended Jessie's doubts at once. Two
  handkerchiefs waved, and some one shouted. The riders of the tandem bicycle
  began to run it up hill, past the other vehicles. But our young people did
  not wait for further developments of the pursuit. In another moment they were
  out of sight, riding hard down a steady incline towards Stoney Cross.</p>

  <p>Before they had dropped among the trees out of sight of the hill brow,
  Jessie looked back and saw the tandem rising over the crest, with its rear
  rider just tumbling into the saddle. "They're coming," she said, and bent her
  head over her handles in true professional style.</p>

  <p>They whirled down into the valley, over a white bridge, and saw ahead of
  them a number of shaggy little ponies frisking in the roadway. Involuntarily
  they slackened. "Shoo!" said Mr. Hoopdriver, and the ponies kicked up their
  heels derisively. At that Mr. Hoopdriver lost his temper and charged at them,
  narrowly missed one, and sent them jumping the ditch into the bracken under
  the trees, leaving the way clear for Jessie.</p>

  <p>Then the road rose quietly but persistently; the treadles grew heavy, and
  Mr. Hoopdriver's breath sounded like a saw. The tandem appeared, making
  frightful exertions, at the foot, while the chase was still climbing. Then,
  thank Heaven! a crest and a stretch of up and down road, whose only
  disadvantage was its pitiless exposure to the afternoon sun. The tandem
  apparently dismounted at the hill, and did not appear against the hot blue
  sky until they were already near some trees and a good mile away.</p>

  <p>"We're gaining," said Mr. Hoopdriver, with a little Niagara of
  perspiration dropping from brow to cheek. "That hill&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But that was their only gleam of success. They were both nearly spent.
  Hoopdriver, indeed, was quite spent, and only a feeling of shame prolonged
  the liquidation of his bankrupt physique. From that point the tandem grained
  upon them steadily. At the Rufus Stone, it was scarcely a hundred yards
  behind. Then one desperate spurt, and they found themselves upon a steady
  downhill stretch among thick pine woods. Downhill nothing can beat a highly
  geared tandem bicycle. Automatically Mr. Hoopdriver put up his feet, and
  Jessie slackened her pace. In another moment they heard the swish of the fat
  pneumatics behind them, and the tandem passed Hoopdriver and drew alongside
  Jessie. Hoopdriver felt a mad impulse to collide with this abominable machine
  as it passed him. His only consolation was to notice that its riders, riding
  violently, were quite as dishevelled as himself and smothered in sandy white
  dust.</p>

  <p>Abruptly Jessie stopped and dismounted, and the tandem riders shot panting
  past them downhill. "Brake," said Dangle, who was riding behind, and stood up
  on the pedals. For a moment the velocity of the thing increased, and then
  they saw the dust fly from the brake, as it came down on the front tire.
  Dangle's right leg floundered in the air as he came off in the road. The
  tandem wobbled.</p>

  <p class="caption">"Hold it!" cried Phipps over his shoulder...</p><br>

  <p>"Hold it!" cried Phipps over his shoulder, going on downhill. I can't get
  off if you don't hold it." He put on the brake until the machine stopped
  almost dead, and then feeling unstable began to pedal again. Dangle shouted
  after him. "Put out your foot, man," said Dangle.</p>

  <p>In this way the tandem riders were carried a good hundred yards or more
  beyond their quarry. Then Phipps realized his possibilities, slacked up with
  the brake, and let the thing go over sideways, dropping on to his right foot.
  With his left leg still over the saddle, and still holding the handles, he
  looked over his shoulder and began addressing uncomplimentary remarks to
  Dangle. "You only think of yourself," said Phipps, with a florid face.</p>

  <p>"They have forgotten us," said Jessie, turning her machine.</p>

  <p>"There was a road at the top of the hill&mdash;to Lyndhurst," said
  Hoopdriver, following her example.</p>

  <p>"It's no good. There's the money. We must give it up. But let us go back
  to that hotel at Rufus Stone. I don't see why we should be led captive."</p>

  <p>So to the consternation of the tandem riders, Jessie and her companion
  mounted and rode quietly back up the hill again. As they dismounted at the
  hotel entrance, the tandem overtook them, and immediately afterwards the
  dogcart came into view in pursuit. Dangle jumped off.</p>

  <p>"Miss Milton, I believe," said Dangle, panting and raising a damp cap from
  his wet and matted hair.</p>

  <p>"<i>I say</i>," said Phipps, receding involuntarily. "Don't go doing it
  again, Dangle. <i>Help</i> a chap."</p>

  <p>"One minute," said Dangle, and ran after his colleague.</p>

  <p>Jessie leant her machine against the wall, and went into the hotel
  entrance. Hoopdriver remained in the hotel entrance, limp but
  defiant.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="chap25"
     name="chap25">XXV. &mdash; AT THE RUFUS STONE</a></h2>

  <h3>§ XXXVIII</h3>

  <p class="first">He folded his arms as Dangle and Phipps returned towards
  him. Phipps was abashed by his inability to cope with the tandem, which he
  was now wheeling, but Dangle was inclined to be quarrelsome. "Miss Milton?"
  he said briefly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoopdriver bowed over his folded arms.</p>

  <p>"Miss Milton within?" said Dangle.</p>

  <p><i>And</i> not to be disturved," said Mr. Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>"You are a scoundrel, sir," said Mr. Dangle.</p>

  <p>"Et your service," said Mr. Hoopdriver. "She awaits 'er stepmother,
  sir."</p>

  <p>Mr. Dangle hesitated. "She will be here immediately," he said. "Here is
  her friend, Miss Mergle."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoopdriver unfolded his arms slowly, and, with an air of immense calm,
  thrust his hands into his breeches pockets. Then with one of those fatal
  hesitations of his, it occurred to him that this attitude was merely vulgarly
  defiant he withdrew both, returned one and pulled at the insufficient
  moustache with the other. Miss Mergle caught him in confusion. "Is this the
  man?" she said to Dangle, and forthwith, "How <i>dare</i> you, sir? How dare
  you face me? That poor girl!"</p>

  <p>"You will permit me to observe," began Mr. Hoopdriver, with a splendid
  drawl, seeing himself, for the first time in all this business, as a romantic
  villain.</p>

  <p>"Ugh," said Miss Mergle, unexpectedly striking him about the midriff with
  her extended palms, and sending him staggering backward into the hall of the
  hotel.</p>

  <p>"Let me pass said Miss Mergle, in towering indignation. "How dare you
  resist my passage?" and so swept by him and into the dining-room, wherein
  Jessie had sought refuge.</p>

  <p>As Mr. Hoopdriver struggled for equilibrium with the umbrella-stand,
  Dangle and Phipps, roused from their inertia by Miss Mergle's activity, came
  in upon her heels, Phipps leading. "How dare you prevent that lady passing?"
  said Phipps.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoopdriver looked obstinate, and, to Dangle's sense, dangerous, but he
  made no answer. A waiter in full bloom appeared at the end of the passage,
  guardant. "It is men of your stamp, sir," said Phipps, "who discredit
  manhood."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoopdriver thrust his hands into his pockets. "Who the juice are you?"
  shouted Mr. Hoopdriver, fiercely.</p>

  <p>"Who are <i>you</i>, sir?" retorted Phipps. "Who are you? That's the
  question. What are <i>you</i>, and what are you doing, wandering at large
  with a young lady under age?"</p>

  <p>"Don't speak to him," said Dangle.</p>

  <p>"I'm not a-going to tell all my secrets to any one who comes at me," said
  Hoopdriver. "Not Likely." And added fiercely, "And that I tell you, sir."</p>

  <p>He and Phipps stood, legs apart and both looking exceedingly fierce at one
  another, and Heaven alone knows what might not have happened, if the long
  clergyman had not appeared in the doorway, heated but deliberate.
  "Petticoated anachronism," said the long clergyman in the doorway, apparently
  still suffering from the antiquated prejudice that demanded a third wheel and
  a black coat from a clerical rider. He looked at Phipps and Hoopdriver for a
  moment, then extending his hand towards the latter, he waved it up and down
  three times, saying, "Tchak, tchak, tchak," very deliberately as he did so.
  Then with a concluding "Ugh!" and a gesture of repugnance he passed on into
  the dining-room from which the voice of Miss Mergle was distinctly audible
  remarking that the weather was extremely hot even for the time of year.</p>

  <p>This expression of extreme disapprobation had a very demoralizing effect
  upon Hoopdriver, a demoralization that was immediately completed by the
  advent of the massive Widgery.</p>

  <p>"Is this the man?" said Widgery very grimly, and producing a special voice
  for the occasion from somewhere deep in his neck.</p>

  <p>"Don't hurt him!" said Mrs. Milton, with clasped hands. "However much
  wrong he has done her&mdash;No violence!"</p>

  <p>"'Ow many more of you?" said Hoopdriver, at bay before the umbrella stand.
  "Where is she? What has he done with her?" said Mrs. Milton.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to stand here and be insulted by a lot of strangers," said
  Mr. Hoopdriver. "So you needn't think it."</p>

  <p>"Please don't worry, Mr. Hoopdriver," said Jessie, suddenly appearing in
  the door of the dining-room. "I'm here, mother." Her face was white.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Milton said something about her child, and made an emotional charge
  at Jessie. The embrace vanished into the dining-room. Widgery moved as if to
  follow, and hesitated. "You'd better make yourself scarce," he said to Mr.
  Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>"I shan't do anything of the kind," said Mr. Hoopdriver, with a catching
  of the breath. "I'm here defending that young lady."</p>

  <p>"You've done her enough mischief, I should think," said Widgery, suddenly
  walking towards the dining-room, and closing the door behind him, leaving
  Dangle and Phipps with Hoopdriver.</p>

  <p>"Clear!" said Phipps, threateningly.</p>

  <p>"I shall go and sit out in the garden," said Mr. Hoopdriver, with dignity.
  "There I shall remain."</p>

  <p>"Don't make a row with him," said Dangle.</p>

  <p>And Mr. Hoopdriver retired, unassaulted, in almost sobbing
  dignity.</p><br>

  <p class="caption">Mr. Hoopdriver was seated on a rustic seat.</p><br>

  <p>So here is the world with us again, and our sentimental excursion is over.
  In the front of the Rufus Stone Hotel conceive a remarkable collection of
  wheeled instruments, watched over by Dangle and Phipps in grave and stately
  attitudes, and by the driver of a stylish dogcart from Ringwood. In the
  garden behind, in an attitude of nervous prostration, Mr. Hoopdriver was
  seated on a rustic seat. Through the open window of a private sitting-room
  came a murmur of voices, as of men and women in conference. Occasionally
  something that might have been a girlish sob.</p>

  <p>"I fail to see what status Widgery has," says Dangle, "thrusting himself
  in there."</p>

  <p>"He takes too much upon himself," said Phipps.</p>

  <p>"I've been noticing little things, yesterday and to-day," said Dangle, and
  stopped.</p>

  <p>"They went to the cathedral together in the afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Financially it would be a good thing for her, of course," said Dangle,
  with a gloomy magnanimity.</p>

  <p>He felt drawn to Phipps now by the common trouble, in spite of the man's
  chequered legs. "Financially it wouldn't be half bad."</p>

  <p>"He's so dull and heavy," said Phipps.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, within, the clergyman had, by promptitude and dexterity, taken
  the chair and was opening the case against the unfortunate Jessie. I regret
  to have to say that my heroine had been appalled by the visible array of
  public opinion against her excursion, to the pitch of tears. She was sitting
  with flushed cheeks and swimming eyes at the end of the table opposite to the
  clergyman. She held her handkerchief crumpled up in her extended hand. Mrs.
  Milton sat as near to her as possible, and occasionally made little dabs with
  her hand at Jessie's hand, to indicate forgiveness. These advances were not
  reciprocated, which touched Widgery very much. The lady in green, Miss Mergle
  (B. A.), sat on the opposite side near the clergyman. She was the
  strong-minded schoolmistress to whom Jessie had written, and who had
  immediately precipitated the pursuit upon her. She had picked up the
  clergyman in Ringwood, and had told him everything forthwith, having met him
  once at a British Association meeting. He had immediately constituted himself
  administrator of the entire business. Widgery, having been foiled in an
  attempt to conduct the proceedings, stood with his legs wide apart in front
  of the fireplace ornament, and looked profound and sympathetic. Jessie's
  account of her adventures was a chary one and given amidst frequent
  interruptions. She surprised herself by skilfully omitting any allusion to
  the Bechamel episode. She completely exonerated Hoopdriver from the charge of
  being more than an accessory to her escapade. But public feeling was heavy
  against Hoopdriver. Her narrative was inaccurate and sketchy, but happily the
  others were too anxious to pass opinions to pin her down to particulars. At
  last they had all the facts they would permit.</p>

  <p>"My dear young lady," said the clergyman, "I can only ascribe this
  extravagant and regrettable expedition of yours to the wildest misconceptions
  of your place in the world and of your duties and responsibilities. Even now,
  it seems to me, your present emotion is due not so much to a real and sincere
  penitence for your disobedience and folly as to a positive annoyance at our
  most fortunate interference&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not that," said Mrs. Milton, in a low tone. "Not that."</p>

  <p>"But <i>why</i> did she go off like this?" said Widgery. "That's what
  <i>I</i> want to know."</p>

  <p>Jessie made an attempt to speak, but Mrs. Milton said "Hush!" and the
  ringing tenor of the clergyman rode triumphantly over the meeting. "I cannot
  understand this spirit of unrest that has seized upon the more intelligent
  portion of the feminine community. You had a pleasant home, a most refined
  and intelligent lady in the position of your mother, to cherish and protect
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If I <i>had</i> a mother," gulped Jessie, succumbing to the obvious snare
  of self-pity, and sobbing.</p>

  <p>"To cherish, protect, and advise you. And you must needs go out of it all
  alone into a strange world of unknown dangers-"</p>

  <p>"I wanted to learn," said Jessie.</p>

  <p>"You wanted to learn. May you never have anything to <i>un</i>learn."</p>

  <p><i>"Ah!"</i> from Mrs. Milton, very sadly.</p>

  <p>"It isn't fair for all of you to argue at me at once," submitted Jessie,
  irrelevantly.</p>

  <p>"A world full of unknown dangers," resumed the clergyman. "Your proper
  place was surely the natural surroundings that are part of you. You have been
  unduly influenced, it is only too apparent, by a class of literature which,
  with all due respect to distinguished authoress that shall be nameless, I
  must call the New Woman Literature. In that deleterious ingredient of our
  book boxes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't altogether agree with you there," said Miss Mergle, throwing her
  head back and regarding him firmly through her spectacles, and Mr. Widgery
  coughed.</p>

  <p>"What <i>has</i> all this to do with me?" asked Jessie, availing herself
  of the interruption.</p>

  <p>"The point is," said Mrs. Milton, on her defence, "that in my
  books&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All I want to do," said Jessie, "is to go about freely by myself. Girls
  do so in America. Why not here?"</p>

  <p>"Social conditions are entirely different in America," said Miss Mergle.
  "Here we respect Class Distinctions."</p>

  <p>"It's very unfortunate. What I want to know is, why I cannot go away for a
  holiday if I want to."</p>

  <p>"With a strange young man, socially your inferior," said Widgery, and made
  her flush by his tone.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" she said. "With anybody."</p>

  <p>"They don't do that, even in America," said Miss Mergle.</p>

  <p>"My dear young lady," said the clergyman, "the most elementary principles
  of decorum&mdash;A day will come when you will better understand how entirely
  subservient your ideas are to the very fundamentals of our present
  civilisation, when you will better understand the harrowing anxiety you have
  given Mrs. Milton by this inexplicable flight of yours. We can only put
  things down at present, in charity, to your ignorance&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You have to consider the general body of opinion, too," said Widgery.</p>

  <p>"Precisely," said Miss Mergle. "There is no such thing as conduct in the
  absolute." "If once this most unfortunate business gets about," said the
  clergyman, "it will do you infinite harm."</p>

  <p>"But <i>I've</i> done nothing wrong. Why should I be responsible for other
  people's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The world has no charity," said Mrs. Milton.</p>

  <p>"For a girl," said Jessie. "No."</p>

  <p>"Now do let us stop arguing, my dear young lady, and let us listen to
  reason. Never mind how or why, this conduct of yours will do you infinite
  harm, if once it is generally known. And not only that, it will cause
  infinite pain to those who care for you. But if you will return at once to
  your home, causing it to be understood that you have been with friends for
  these last few days&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tell lies," said Jessie. "Certainly not. Most certainly not. But I
  understand that is how your absence is understood at present, and there is no
  reason&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Jessie's grip tightened on her handkerchief. "I won't go back," she said,
  "to have it as I did before. I want a room of my own, what books I need to
  read, to be free to go out by myself alone, Teaching&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Anything," said Mrs. Milton ,"anything in reason."</p>

  <p>"But will you keep your promise?" said Jessie.</p>

  <p>"Surely you won't dictate to your mother!" said Widgery.</p>

  <p>"My stepmother! I don't want to dictate. I want definite promises
  now."</p>

  <p>"This is most unreasonable," said the clergyman. "Very well," said Jessie,
  swallowing a sob but with unusual resolution. "Then I won't go back. My life
  is being frittered away&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"<i>Let</i> her have her way," said Widgery.</p>

  <p>"A room then. All your Men. I'm not to come down and talk away half my
  days&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear child, if only to save you," said Mrs. Milton. "If you don't keep
  your promise&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then I take it the matter is practically concluded," said the clergyman.
  "And that you very properly submit to return to your proper home. And now, if
  I may offer a suggestion, it is that we take tea. Freed of its tannin,
  nothing, I think, is more refreshing and stimulating."</p>

  <p>"There's a train from Lyndhurst at thirteen minutes to six," said Widgery,
  unfolding a time table. "That gives us about half an hour or three-quarters
  here&mdash;if a conveyance is obtainable, that is."</p>

  <p>"A gelatine lozenge dropped into the tea cup precipitates the tannin in
  the form of tannate of gelatine," said the clergyman to Miss Mergle, in a
  confidential bray.</p>

  <p>Jessie stood up, and saw through the window a depressed head and shoulders
  over the top of the back of a garden seat. She moved towards the door. "While
  you have tea, mother," she said, "I must tell Mr. Hoopdriver of our
  arrangements."</p>

  <p>"Don't you think I&mdash;" began the clergyman.</p>

  <p>"No," said Jessie, very rudely; "I don't."</p>

  <p>"But, Jessie, haven't you already&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are already breaking the capitulation," said Jessie.</p>

  <p>"Will you want the whole half hour?" said Widgery, at the bell.</p>

  <p>"Every minute," said Jessie, in the doorway. "He's behaved very nobly to
  me."</p>

  <p>"There's tea," said Widgery.</p>

  <p>"I've had tea."</p>

  <p>"He may not have behaved badly," said the clergyman. "But he's certainly
  an astonishingly weak person to let a wrong-headed young girl&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Jessie closed the door into the garden.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Mr. Hoopdriver made a sad figure in the sunlight outside. It was
  over, this wonderful excursion of his, so far as she was concerned, and with
  the swift blow that separated them, he realised all that those days had done
  for him. He tried to grasp the bearings of their position. Of course, they
  would take her away to those social altitudes of hers. She would become an
  inaccessible young lady again. Would they let him say good-bye to her?</p>

  <p>How extraordinary it had all been! He recalled the moment when he had
  first seen her riding, with the sunlight behind her, along the riverside
  road; he recalled that wonderful night at Bognor, remembering it as if
  everything had been done of his own initiative. "Brave, brave!" she had
  called him. And afterwards, when she came down to him in the morning, kindly,
  quiet. But ought he to have persuaded her then to return to her home? He
  remembered some intention of the sort. Now these people snatched her away
  from him as though he was scarcely fit to live in the same world with her. No
  more he was! He felt he had presumed upon her worldly ignorance in travelling
  with her day after day. She was so dainty, so delightful, so serene. He began
  to recapitulate her expressions, the light of her eyes, the turn of her
  face....</p>

  <p>He wasn't good enough to walk in the same road with her. Nobody was.
  Suppose they let him say good-bye to her; what could he say? That? But they
  were sure not to let her talk to him alone; her mother would be there as
  &mdash;what was it? Chaperone. He'd never once had a chance of saying what he
  felt; indeed, it was only now he was beginning to realise what he felt. Love
  I he wouldn't presume. It was worship. If only he could have one more chance.
  He must have one more chance, somewhere, somehow. Then he would pour out his
  soul to her eloquently. He felt eloquently, and words would come. He was dust
  under her feet...</p>

  <p>His meditation was interrupted by the click of a door handle, and Jessie
  appeared in the sunlight under the verandah. "Come away from here," she said
  to Hoopdriver, as he rose to meet her. "I'm going home with them. We have to
  say good-bye."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoopdriver winced, opened and shut his mouth, and rose without a
  word.</p><br>

  <h3>§ XL</h3>

  <p class="first">At first Jessie Milton and Mr. Hoopdriver walked away from
  the hotel in silence. He heard a catching in her breath and glanced at her
  and saw her ips pressed tight and a tear on her cheek. Her face was hot and
  bright. She was looking straight before her. He could think of nothing to
  say, and thrust his hands in his pockets and looked away from her
  intentionally. After a while she began to talk. They dealt disjointedly with
  scenery first, and then with the means of self-education. She took his
  address at Antrobus's and promised to send him some books. But even with that
  it was spiritless, aching talk, Hoopdriver felt, for the fighting mood was
  over. She seemed, to him, preoccupied with the memories of her late battle,
  and that appearance hurt him.</p>

  <p>"It's the end," he whispered to himself. "It's the end."</p>

  <p>They went into a hollow and up a gentle wooded slope, and came at last to
  a high and open space overlooking a wide expanse of country. There, by a
  common impulse, they stopped. She looked at her watch&mdash;a little
  ostentatiously. They stared at the billows of forest rolling away beneath
  them, crest beyond crest, of leafy trees, fading at last into blue.</p>

  <p>"The end" ran through his mind, to the exclusion of all speakable
  thoughts.</p>

  <p>"And so," she said, presently, breaking the silence, "it comes to good-
  bye."</p>

  <p>For half a minute he did not answer. Then he gathered his resolution.
  "There is one thing I <i>must</i> say."</p>

  <p>"Well?" she said, surprised and abruptly forgetting the recent argument.
  "I ask no return. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Then he stopped. "I won't say it. It's no good. It would be rot from me
  &mdash;now. I wasn't going to say anything. Good-bye."</p>

  <p>She looked at him with a startled expression in her eyes. "No," she said.
  "But don't forget you are going to work. Remember, brother Chris, you are my
  friend. You will work. You are not a very strong man, you know, now&mdash;you
  will forgive me&mdash;nor do you know all you should. But what will you be in
  six years' time?"</p>

  <p>He stared hard in front of him still, and the lines about his weak mouth
  seemed to strengthen. He knew she understood what he could not say.</p>

  <p>"I'll work," he said, concisely. They stood side by side for a moment.
  Then he said, with a motion of his head, "I won't come back to <i>them</i>.
  Do you mind? Going back alone?"</p>

  <p>She took ten seconds to think. "No." she said, and held out her hand,
  biting her nether lip. <i>"Good-bye,"</i> she whispered.</p>

  <p class="caption">With a sudden impulse he lifted it to his lips...</p><br>

  <p>He turned, with a white face, looked into her eyes, took her hand limply,
  and then with a sudden impulse, lifted it to his lips. She would have
  snatched it away, but his grip tightened to her movement. She felt the touch
  of his lips, and then he had dropped her fingers and turned from her and was
  striding down the slope. A dozen paces away his foot turned in the lip of a
  rabbit hole, and he stumbled forward and almost fell. He recovered his
  balance and went on, not looking back. He never once looked back. She stared
  at his receding figure until it was small and far below her, and then, the
  tears running over her eyelids now, turned slowly, and walked with her hands
  gripped hard together behind her, towards Stoney Cross again.</p>

  <p>"I did not know," she whispered to herself. "I did not understand. Even
  now&mdash;No, I do not understand."</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="chap26"
     name="chap26">XXVI. &mdash; THE ENVOY</a></h2>

  <h3>§ XLI</h3>

  <p class="first">So the story ends, dear Reader. Mr. Hoopdriver, sprawling
  down there among the bracken, must sprawl without our prying, I think, or
  listening to what chances to his breathing. And of what came of it all, of
  the six years and afterwards, this is no place to tell. In truth, there is no
  telling it, for the years have still to run. But if you see how a mere
  counter-jumper, a cad on castors, and a fool to boot, may come to feel the
  little insufficiencies of life, and if he has to any extent won your
  sympathies, my end is attained. (If it is not attained, may Heaven forgive us
  both!) Nor will we follow this adventurous young lady of ours back to her
  home at Surbiton, to her new struggle against Widgery and Mrs. Milton
  combined. For, as she will presently hear, that devoted man has got his
  reward. For her, also, your sympathies are invited.</p>

  <p>The rest of this great holiday, too&mdash;five days there are left of
  it&mdash;is beyond the limits of our design. You see fitfully a slender
  figure in a dusty brown suit and heather mixture stockings, and brown shoes
  not intended to be cycled in, flitting Londonward through Hampshire and
  Berkshire and Surrey, going economically&mdash;for excellent reasons.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="caption">A lonely-looking little figure, in a dusty brown
  suit.</p><br>

  <p>Day by day he goes on, riding fitfully and for the most part through
  bye-roads, but getting a few miles to the north-eastward every day. He is a
  narrow-chested person, with a nose hot and tanned at the bridge with unwonted
  exposure, and brown, red-knuckled fists. A musing expression sits upon the
  face of this rider, you observe. Sometimes he whistles noiselessly to
  himself, sometimes he speaks aloud, "a juiced good try, anyhow!" you hear;
  and sometimes, and that too often for my liking, he looks irritable and
  hopeless. "I know," he says, "I know. It's over and done. It isn't <i>in</i>
  me. You ain't man enough, Hoopdriver. Look at yer silly hands!... Oh, my
  God!" and a gust of passion comes upon him and he rides furiously for a
  space.</p>

  <p>Sometimes again his face softens. "Anyhow, if I'm not to see
  her&mdash;she's going to lend me books," he thinks, and gets such comfort as
  he can. Then again; "Books! What's books?" Once or twice triumphant memories
  of the earlier incidents nerve his face for a while. "I put the ky-bosh on
  <i>his</i> little game," he remarks. "I <i>did</i> that," and one might even
  call him happy in these phases. And, by-the-bye, the machine, you notice, has
  been enamel-painted grey and carries a sonorous gong.</p>

  <p>This figure passes through Basingstoke and Bagshot, Staines, Hampton, and
  Richmond. At last, in Putney High Street, glowing with the warmth of an
  August sunset and with all the 'prentice boys busy shutting up shop, and the
  work girls going home, and the shop folks peeping abroad, and the white
  'buses full of late clerks and city folk rumbling home to their dinners, we
  part from him. He is back. To-morrow, the early rising, the dusting, and
  drudgery, begin again&mdash;but with a difference, with wonderful memories
  and still more wonderful desires and ambitions replacing those discrepant
  dreams.</p>

  <p>He turns out of the High Street at the corner, dismounts with a sigh, and
  pushes his machine through the gates of the Antrobus stable yard, as the
  apprentice with the high collar holds them open. There are words of greeting.
  "South Coast," you hear; and "splendid weather&mdash;splendid." He sighs.
  "Yes&mdash;swapped him off for a couple of sovs. It's a juiced good
  machine."</p>
