  <p class="first">THE TALL MAN stood alone under the tattered, wintry tree. A
  mist wrapped the high-seated city between the palace in the east and the
  castle in the west. When he moistened his lips he could taste the salted
  vapours which came from the sea. On his frieze coat were drops of moisture,
  the linen round his neck was limp. His thoughts tormented him, like malignant
  fingers plucking at his heart. He had come to this desolate place to be away
  from the thriftless chatter of the Abbey.</p>

  <p>But his perplexities crowded about him in the barren solitude. He stood so
  still that a hare limped through the circle of dim light which bounded him,
  and the creature's bulging eyes fixed him for a second. He was startled, and
  forgetting how long it was since he had been a priest, raised his hand to
  make the Holy Sign. As his fingers dropped to his side the hare limped away.
  There seemed a sigh in the thick vapours that began to be shot with darkness.
  Behind the castle, the unseen sun was declining, leaving him in gloom.</p>

  <p>The thoughtful man moved slowly from under the tree. He was afraid of
  devilry, and his strong mind chafed at his fears. He longed to be free of all
  superstitions, yet he moved always warily, in terror of spells and the
  diabolical enchantments of the unknown world that pressed so close about the
  senses. As he went sullenly towards the Abbey, squares of coloured light
  showed the windows. He was irritated with himself because his problems were
  unsolved even by his intense meditation. He had endeavoured to understand
  himself, his ambition, his faith, his desires, his hopes, but he had failed,
  because unacknowledged lusts and treacheries stirred and, like devils, put
  themselves between him and his earnest thoughts.</p>

  <p>One fact, splendid and hideous, stained the fabric of his fortunes. He was
  a King's bastard, and one of noble birth, even by the unwed mother's side.
  This irony was underlined because he knew himself possessed of royal
  qualities, and very capable of government.</p>

  <p>As he entered the gardens, the outline of the Abbey appeared vaguely dark
  against the blurred light. The well-kept gardens with wattled beds, trellis
  work, summer-houses and gravel paths were neat and barren as a set-geometric
  design; the bare trees made a brittle tracery against the vanishing fleeces
  of the mist, that curdled as the upper wind from Leith drew them away.</p>

  <p>The man paused; he was vexed by his own indecision. He wanted all that a
  violently changed world had to offer, but, so rapid was progress, so eager
  was his desire to be in the forefront of all that was new, that he scarcely
  knew what this was. He took off his hat impatiently and, twisted it in his
  hand, allowing the transient light to fall over his strong face, with the
  eyes slightly swollen from overwork, the pale, healthy complexion, the sullen
  lines round heavy jowl and mouth.</p>

  <p>"To save her or to destroy her?"</p>

  <p>He was startled by this thought, so powerful that it almost forced itself
  into words. But he faced it grimly with the courage that he always turned to
  an enemy.</p>

  <p>"Destroy her?" He believed that he could do it; he had never found his own
  equal in craft, daring, coolness, mastery of men. "Destroy her while she is
  unwed, a flower without root or fruit&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A sudden tenderness overwhelmed him at the touch of his own wistful
  simile. A tall, pale flower with fair petals spread&mdash;she was like that;
  he had always had an instinct to guard her, warring with an instinct to put
  her out of his way. Sometimes he was ashamed of this affection, which seemed
  too warm for a brother towards a sister. There had been moments when he had
  dwelt on old stories of times when kings had married their sisters. Then he
  had become alarmed and believed himself bewitched, outcast from
  salvation.</p>

  <p>Was not this voluptuous, secret tenderness a reason for destroying her?
  For his soul's sake it would be better that this sweet, precious creature
  should be plucked, cast down, and left to wither.</p>

  <p>Yet, to serve her was not so ill a task. She had allowed him a free hand,
  she had never tried to check his passionate avarice, his grim ambition, she
  had given him honours lavishly. And sometimes she had looked at him as if she
  too felt a warm, hidden tenderness for him that was different from sisterly
  trust or respect. With his problems unsolved and lying wearily on his mind,
  the man entered the dark building, where taper lights were fluttering in many
  heated, noisy chambers.</p>

  <p>In the room where he did his business, the King's bastard son stood before
  the fire, deep in thought, but his inability to concentrate caused him to
  raise his hand and let it fall with vexation. As the door opened he turned,
  ready with a sharp rebuke for the intruder, but did not speak when he saw
  William Maitland enter. This was the only man in Scotland whom he considered
  his intellectual peer, but Moray was confident that he could best even
  Maitland if he wished.</p>

  <p>Maitland smiled and came to the fire; he was very elegant and had the air
  of belonging exactly to his own time; all he did and said seemed fresh,
  tolerant, easy, free of the shackles of tradition, convention, or prejudice.
  His clothes were always in some whim of fashion that set them apart from the
  routine attire of other men, but never ostentatious nor fantastic. There was
  about him a fine essence of breeding, courtesy, accomplishment and exquisite
  mockery which the other man envied. Yet there was also a fickleness, a
  lightness and an inconstancy that the other man, anchored to stable ambitions
  and rigid principles, despised.</p>

  <p>"A cold, wet night," said Maitland softly. "It is good to see even a small
  fire. Where have you been, Lord Moray? Wandering away from my corrupt
  counsel?"</p>

  <p>"I have been taking my own. You know there is nothing but that, to see
  clearly for oneself and to act thereon."</p>

  <p>"Do you see clearly?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"I do. I could tell you your thoughts."</p>

  <p>"I have never tried to conceal them from you," replied Moray dryly; yet he
  flattered himself that his closest secrets were hidden deep, even from this
  acute observer. A little smile of satisfaction touched his pale sensual
  mouth. "Come, what is it that you see so clearly?"</p>

  <p>"That while we can serve the lady, we can never serve the lady's
  husband."</p>

  <p>"You bring us, then, to a dead end. For the lady must be wed." Moray liked
  this plain, dangerous speaking; his slanting brown eyes turned eagerly to the
  smooth, inscrutable face of his companion who was leaning against the
  mantelpiece and gazing with a gentle expression into the flames.</p>

  <p>"Must be wed," repeated Moray. "Come, we have no concealments, you and I,
  Maitland. Could we, by any subtlety, device or intricacy of argument, keep
  her without a husband? Come, you excel in such difficulties."</p>

  <p>"Keep her without a husband, yes," smiled Maitland. "Keep her chaste, no.
  And will the godly, sir, endure a wanton, wilful Queen?"</p>

  <p>"I would keep within the terms of honour." Moray could not resist the
  useless rebuke.</p>

  <p>"Sometimes you speak like a boy. Was her father cold-blooded?" Maitland
  smiled. "If he had been you would never have seen the light. She is a warm,
  sweet creature. She is also set in authority. Can your policies keep her from
  lovers?"</p>

  <p>Moray did not answer, he was angered at this turn of the clear, mocking
  talk.</p>

  <p>"You are not nimble enough, I think, to defeat her always. I believe twice
  already it has been rumoured&mdash;John Gordon and Pierre de Chastelard,
  eh?"</p>

  <p>"It was, through my care, hushed up, glossed over."</p>

  <p>"The third time it may not be so easy."</p>

  <p>"This is grievous, jarring talk. Upon my soul, I know not what to do. If
  we could find some careful fool whom I could manage&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You have had some proposed&mdash;Arran, who is an imbecile; Don Carlos,
  who is a lunatic; the Englishman, Dudley, whom I take to be a blockhead; this
  Lennox boy, a silly child."</p>

  <p>"Maitland, all this gets us nowhere. Advise me, I take you to be the only
  man of free mind in Scotland. Help me if you can." Moray spoke with great
  energy, then, seeing the other's amused glance, he added sharply: "You know
  that no one can reward you better."</p>

  <p>"The Queen might," smiled Maitland. "I love her myself, as much as any man
  might. Why should I not put her high and keep her there, as Cecil put and
  keeps Elizabeth?"</p>

  <p>"Because I am in the way!" Moray's answering smile was sour. "And my
  sister is not that manner of woman."</p>

  <p>"Sister!" repeated Maitland lightly. "There's the canker. You ought to
  marry her yourself&mdash;the two of you together, now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Moray felt a prick of loathing towards this man who understood him better
  than anyone else, but whom he had thought did not understand this one thing.
  He said, very slowly:</p>

  <p>"With such a woman I could have ruled Scotland very well. I cannot rule
  with her and a husband&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A light, malicious amusement ran, like light, over Maitland's elegant
  face.</p>

  <p>"Choose her a husband who can rule without you, then. Cease to tame her,
  let her have her liberty&mdash;with another prince."</p>

  <p>The King's son replied with a piercing sincerity: "There is no such man.
  No one could do it like I can. You know that I should be King."</p>

  <p>Maitland conceded that bitter claim.</p>

  <p>"Yes. But she is there. Now it is all very well. She endures your advice
  very prettily, she leans to you in everything, but when she takes a husband
  it will be quite different. You will be jealous. Not only for your lost
  power."</p>

  <p>"Not only?" repeated Moray, irked by these words.</p>

  <p>In a soft tone and looking sideways, Maitland said: "You were glad to see
  her two lovers&mdash;her would-be lovers then!&mdash;on the scaffold. So was
  I. But what we try to do is impossible. Some lascivious fool will come along
  and snatch her from both of us&mdash;my delicious Queen, your exquisite
  sister."</p>

  <p>Moray's face flushed, to his own vexation, yet Malt-land's talk excited
  him and he would not stop it; he glanced at the window as if he feared
  spies.</p>

  <p>"But," added Maitland, "no one, whatever his merit or his vice will keep
  her long. He who drinks in jewels one day, the next will use his hand."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" cried Moray quickly. "There is your solution&mdash;I thought of
  that."</p>

  <p>Maitland nodded.</p>

  <p>"Let her marry&mdash;since you cannot prevent it. A Queen's husband is not
  to be envied. It will not be I nor you who will be troubled with his
  removal&mdash;his advancement will consume him."</p>

  <p>Moray wiped his forehead; the fire was really very hot, the small room
  stuffy; he thought of the hare with staring eyes, he thought of a cursing
  witch burning in flames. He longed for relief from the tension; he turned his
  urgent face to Maitland, who remained cool and unaltered.</p>

  <p>"If there should be a child, you could rule through that and outbrave them
  all. Steward and lord in one." Moray made an instinctive movement of
  repugnance.</p>

  <p>"If I took one husband from her she would find another, by reason of her
  graces and her faults." Moray seemed to sink within himself, to utter these
  words without his own volition.</p>

  <p>"If she is not very careful she will not be able to save herself from
  scandal," whispered Maitland, almost on a sigh.</p>

  <p>"Would you not be sorry?" he demanded harshly. "Yes, but I should not be
  able to help her."</p>

  <p>The King's bastard clutched the arms of his chair, his chin sank on his
  breast.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that anyone can help her?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Not if she married&mdash;someone who, beyond sensuality, loved her?"</p>

  <p>"No one," whispered Maitland, "will ever love her like that. Besides, you
  would always be there."</p>

  <p>"Yes," admitted Moray, as if answering an accusation.</p>

  <p>"You cannot give way. You ought to be King." Maitland shrugged, spread his
  hands in an Italianate gesture. "No one will be able to forget that. Why do
  you concern yourself so about her husband? Whoever he is, you'll be able to
  manage him. You've the people, the Church, you've skill, argument, God behind
  you. She is an alien, an idolatress. Everyone suspects her, no one likes her
  very much. She is not really clever, one might say that she knows nothing.
  Nothing but tricks."</p>

  <p>Moray looked up; there was appeal in the long eyes between the swollen
  lids.</p>

  <p>"I want to save her. I feel, sorry. You understand? I would like to see
  her safe. Just because she is so helpless&mdash;with her tricks."</p>

  <p>"You cannot do it!" Maitland's smile was unexpectedly bitter; in the
  leaping light his face looked worn, puffy and yellow. "Everything is stupid,
  empty and filthy. We know that. What spoils or trophies can we handle that
  are not smirched with rottenness?"</p>

  <p>"There is God," groaned Moray obstinately.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is curious." Maitland's thin brows went up. "God. But you want
  power, money. You want to rule this rock with its half-million people, most
  of whom are low enough, and the girl is in your way. What has God to do with
  your uncertainties?"</p>

  <p>"I believe&mdash;" began Moray, as if he recited a creed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, in John Calvin. So does she in her idols and her priests and the
  Bishop of Rome. What does it matter?"</p>

  <p>"I am doing it for the benefit of Scotland." Moray's tone was firmer. "I
  know what the people want&mdash;they may be bloody and bestial, false and
  lustful, but there has been a light set among them&mdash;the Holy Gospel, I
  think of that."</p>

  <p>He stood up, and even in his plain dress, with the crumpled collar that
  might have been that of a humble official, he seemed to have the aspect of a
  prince. There was a definite quality emanating from his ancient blood that
  Maitland much admired, an air of tormented greatness that Moray usually kept
  repressed.</p>

  <p>"You are right&mdash;a sharp, cold rock with poor savages," he said
  thickly. He saw a visionary landscape, an island, broken into rugged shapes
  over which the elements warred, distant hostile mountains, lakes of blackish
  water, the master city between the impregnable castle and the palace, with
  open fields about and armed towers surrounding it; in the north other cities,
  gloomy, melancholy, full of men eager with a restless purpose. Over this a
  foreign girl ruled; with indifferent grace she played with brilliant toys. He
  flushed when he considered her and his mind swayed to thoughts of witchcraft
  again, and to the wizened face of the hare peering, with lifted upper lip,
  through the drizzle of the mist. His vision toppled, he stared into the clear
  flames on the hearth. What a large fire they had built up! He winced away,
  thinking of the burning of sorcerers, but he stared, greedily, like a
  glutton, at his future fortunes. He wanted Scotland, all of it; there was no
  one who had a right to dispute it with him, none. There was only Maitland,
  clever, courteous, slippery, useful, who did not quite believe in God, who
  did not care much for reward, but who would work very willingly for love of
  the game, if it were difficult enough. The others were brutes, bloody,
  filthy, or blockheads, dolts, unable to control themselves, shameless,
  violent men. But he could master all of them. God might help him to do so.
  He, bred a Papist priest, had turned from the abominable darkness of that
  Roman error and received the truth. Had ambition helped there? The absolute
  need to be on the winning side urged him? He would not think so. Nor would he
  remember that he was gorged with Church lands; he turned cunningly from any
  possible censure on himself. He glanced up sharply to see Maitland gazing
  Maitland gazing at him, with curiosity and a gentle compassion. This gaze
  inflamed Moray, but his anger flared away; he smiled uneasily.</p>

  <p>"It is all ridiculous and trivial," said Maitland pleasantly, "but as
  there is little else to do, we may as well continue&mdash;the unrest is past
  cure, but we may allay the itch."</p>

  <p>"We have decided on nothing."</p>

  <p>"It is useless for us to decide. You cannot always control her. Nor for
  much longer. Does she even like you?" mused Maitland softly. "I wonder."</p>

  <p>"She has no power," said Moray, as if excusing himself. "She never could
  have."</p>

  <p>"Except to make mischief," added the other, "except to destroy herself."
  His smooth face twitched in slight nervousness. Sometimes he was afraid of
  the future he was making for himself. He was a man of peace, who loved
  comfort and ease, yet everything he meddled in turned to war and violence,
  blood and storm. But he could not withdraw from all the tumult and live in
  the country, writing verses as his father did so contentedly. He must
  interfere with the greatest affairs he knew of, he must fawn on the King's
  bastard because there was not his peer in Scotland. He must want to serve the
  Queen merely because everyone wanted to be near her, to stare at her, to
  scheme and intrigue, to make use of her youth and silliness and amorous
  temper, he must a little love the Queen, content to be her drudge, because
  she was so high and not for him.</p>

  <p>"The century is not worthy of us," he smiled gravely.</p>

  <p>He crossed to the window and looked out into the dusk. A low, thin moon
  that seemed decayed hung over the bare trees and gave a reluctant light. He
  thought of the Queen&mdash;she was never long out of his mind. He understood
  this complex creature who was a mystery to some and whom others did not
  trouble to study. He knew all her faults and did not blame them. If he had
  been in her half-brother's place he could have managed her better. Moray was
  a zealot, or pretended to be, and seldom laughed&mdash;his humour was bleak
  and acid. But he, Sir William Maitland of Lethington, would have known how to
  deal with that brittle, brilliant woman with her warm blood and shallow
  mind&mdash;if he had been a prince.</p>

  <p>Moray had another weakness that surprised Maitland&mdash;his dreadful fear
  of sorcery. Sometimes he thought that the Queen, whom Maitland could read so
  well as a woman of the earth, was an enchantress or one who dealt in spells.
  Maitland smiled at this, but secretly, for he was perhaps the only man in
  Scotland to despise such superstitions.</p>

  <p>"Why do you stare out at the moon?" asked Moray harshly. Maitland knew
  that he thought of Hecate and her terrors of the dark, and so asked:</p>

  <p>"Do you take me for a wizard?"</p>

  <p>"There are such, close about us," complained Moray, "more than I care to
  name. The thought of them is like the fear of the plague to me."</p>

  <p>"I am not infected." Maitland left the window. "You know that she met
  Lennox's son at Wemyss?"</p>

  <p>"What has she said about him?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. Where she is touched deep, she is dumb."</p>

  <p>"I shall make her speak."</p>

  <p>Moray walked through the narrow passages and long low rooms, the cramped
  ante-chambers and twisting staircases of the Abbey of Holy Cross, named
  sometimes Holy Rood, which was a palace, a ruined church, and a royal burial
  ground set in pleasure gardens and a park full of hunting coverts. All the
  windows that he passed were shrouded by curtains of stiff leather. Lamps and
  candles were plentiful so that, save for the biting air, it might have been
  summer.</p>

  <p>When he reached the Queen's apartments he found that she was in bed, not
  for any sickness, but merely resting.</p>

  <p>She was sunk in a huge bed filled with silk mattresses and down pillows.
  The elaborate bed furniture was a shot of red and yellow, with the rugged
  lion and border of little enclosed in a diamond shape. The Queen wore a
  little ermine cape and the coverlets were turned down to her waist.</p>

  <p>When she saw her half-brother she sat up and gave him her hand. The
  atmosphere was drowsy, the candlelight left the room in shadow; on a cushion
  in front of the deep-set fire sat Mary Seaton, stringing perfumed beads into
  a bracelet. Her face was pure, with a remote expression, like that of a nun.
  Moray took the chair of watered silk by the bed; he knew that his harsh
  attire, his heavy frame, his weary face were out of place in this enervating
  chamber.</p>

  <p>The Queen looked at him in a modest silence. Her glance seemed to entreat,
  almost to fawn. Under the ermine mantle that fell open because of its weight,
  her bosom and shoulders, white as a privet bud, showed beneath a gauze shift.
  Her hair, the hue of a crimson lily when it fades from splendour in autumn,
  was dark and crimped behind a golden caul.</p>

  <p>With a flattering humility she touched her half-brother's strong hand
  where it rested on the arm of the chair and asked him if he were angry with
  her.</p>

  <p>They always spoke in French for she knew little Scots or English; her
  voice was sweetly tuned and Moray could never hear it unmoved.</p>

  <p>"We have too much idle talk," he said stiffly.</p>

  <p>"I always do as you bid me," she smiled.</p>

  <p>He nodded grimly. He did all the intricate, thankless business of her
  half-barbarous kingdom, spent himself in schemes and toils on her behalf. She
  would come to the Council chamber with her length of shimmering embroidery,
  so docile, so clever, with her wise little remarks, her shrewd comments, with
  so much majesty in her glance and gesture. But afterwards she would hasten to
  her sport and her pleasure, forget it all, fall into idleness or feverish
  activity as suited her mood, and leave all to him.</p>

  <p>"For the matter of your marriage&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Marriage! How I weary at the word!"</p>

  <p>"I know. It is true that there seems no one&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do not talk to me of policies, sweet James! I have been biddable, I have
  no faults concealed."</p>

  <p>"Ah, madame!" He looked at her sideways, resenting, admitting her costly
  rarity as she lay there dewy fresh and warm as a pearl in a summer sea. She
  was twenty-two years old, gentle and fiery, soft and reckless, full of wiles
  and little lies. Her features were straight, with a high forehead, a pouting
  upper lip, a rounded chin and a complexion of flawless purity. Her brows were
  faint arcs of gold dust, her eyes were marigold brown, but, in the iris,
  flecked with dusky purple, like a pansy where the petals spring from the
  heart.</p>

  <p>She had been over four years a widow. Moray recalled with disgust and
  compassion the swarthy boy rotten with disease who had been her husband. She
  was twice a Queen; on the azure velvet of her headboard the curved silver of
  the French lilies and the devices of the Valois showed between the harsh
  colours of Scotland.</p>

  <p>"What did you think of Henry Stewart?" asked Moray directly.</p>

  <p>"He is a tall, proper youth."</p>

  <p>"I mean his temper and his ambitions."</p>

  <p>"What do I know? We played at billiards and he won a crystal from me."</p>

  <p>"If he were a man," said Moray, "rather than a silly boy, he might well be
  your choice."</p>

  <p>"Because that would silence the Lennox claims?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Then none shall blame me if I make this match?"</p>

  <p>Her firm lips, softly painted, parted in a smile.</p>

  <p>"No!" cried Moray sternly. "I do not trust him nor his father, nor any of
  that faction. I would as soon that you took the English blockhead."</p>

  <p>"Elizabeth Tudor's lover?"</p>

  <p>"We do not know."</p>

  <p>"We can guess. Dudley does not like me. I do not tempt him; he will not
  cross the border to look at me. Oh, Jesu! How long am I to be marketed? If
  Henry Stewart should woo me, may I not yield?"</p>

  <p>She moved towards Moray, turning in the bed, and touching his hand again.
  She was like a gilded flower. He felt dizzy from the heated air, from the
  perfumes of her body that he could see beneath the ermine, from the melting
  glances of her humble eyes. She drew a lazy breath.</p>

  <p>"May no man have me?" she sighed, "Why should I be so set aside?"</p>

  <p>"Madame, one sells common things easily, one barters long over a pearl, a
  star, a peerless gem."</p>

  <p>"Too long, sweet James, and your pearl dissolves in tears, your star is
  hid in mist, your gem is flawed."</p>

  <p>She looked at him so shrewdly that he remembered two dead men and wondered
  what truth had been twice stifled in blood. The handsome young Frenchman, how
  familiar she had been with him, leaning on his breast in the dance, plucking
  at the lute he held on his knees, toying with his curls, like an idle flirt,
  yet when she had found the wretch hidden in her privy chamber she had called
  on him, Moray, and in a womanly passion, bid him strike the intruder to the
  heart.</p>

  <p>"Tell me of Henry Stewart," he said, to change his thoughts. "I must know.
  Is he a young, gay person, loud, expensive, giddy?"</p>

  <p>"He can play tennis excellently, he is quick. He puts all his revenue on
  his back, he sings in a voice you'd not expect, so soft and strong, he likes
  hot wines and spiced foods. He talks English and puzzles over Scots, he knows
  no French and his fingers are clever with the lute."</p>

  <p>"He is no husband for a Queen."</p>

  <p>"Find me, then, another."</p>

  <p>"Madame, you do not mean that you will accept this boy?"</p>

  <p>"Did I say I would? Or only that he had a fair face? Or did I say that? It
  is true, he is fair, like Adonis in a painting."</p>

  <p>"I shall see him, and judge him."</p>

  <p>"And must I abide by your judgment?"</p>

  <p>She sat upright in the bed, the pillows to her waist, behind her shoulders
  the celestial blue and moonlit silver of France; the man watching her felt as
  if nets were being spread for him by a deft young sorceress. He fixed his
  mind on the God of John Calvin and John Knox; he thought of the loathsome
  obscurity of death, of the brevity of earthly brightness, of the rough
  country that he longed to possess and thus he stilled his attraction to this
  gay, alluring woman of his own passionate blood, with the idle heart and
  empty arms.</p>

  <p>The Lennox boy was as honourable, as convenient a match as any he could
  contrive for her, if the groom could be taught his place; yet the thought of
  her, bloomy and fragrant, in that same bed, in the hot youth's embrace made
  him quiver with nausea. He forced himself to say:</p>

  <p>"If he was not an idle youth, if he could learn to be wise and
  quiet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Queen laughed; with a languid movement of her arms she slipped out of
  the ermine, showing her smooth, curved shoulders, her full, firm bosom. In
  the hollow of her breasts was a ring of blood-coloured stones slung on a
  chain as fine as human hair. Moray wondered sullenly who had put it there. He
  had suspected her and John Gordon, but she had ridden northwards, beside him,
  Moray, to put down the Huntly and his brood. He had made her stand at the
  window in Inverness and see John Gordon die. He had not been able to guess
  her feelings, though he had watched her very carefully. She had stood erect
  with her smile of fatal sweetness, a little curious frown between her faint
  brows. When the strong fine man had knelt before the block she had peered
  forward. The executioner had bungled, there had been a sickening scene of
  butchery. She had said nothing, but she had fallen down at Moray's feet, so
  suddenly that he had hardly time to catch at her brocade skirts. He recalled
  the sense of satisfaction, of release, with which he had held her in his
  arms, how her little white teeth had glistened between the dry lips and how
  the faint veins, like the fine traceries of a flower, had shown in her
  throat.</p>

  <p>Afterwards she had been silent about the Gordons; even when the body of
  the old Cock o' the North had been set up in his coffin to be judged, she had
  made no protest. Did she blame her brother for his cruelty, did she know what
  had inspired it?</p>

  <p>Then, with Pierre de Chastelard he had been quite sure of her wantonness
  and had fretted in dumb torment, but she herself had bidden him take the
  insolent youth and kill him instantly. Then he was ashamed of the delight he
  had felt at this proof of her outraged innocence. Now he sighed, much
  doubting her integrity.</p>

  <p>"Harry Stewart is coming to Edinburgh," smiled the Queen with exquisite
  malice, "and you shall judge him."</p>

  <p>Moray rose and took his leave with embarrassment. There was nothing more
  to be said and he wished he had not come.</p>

  <p>As he turned to her, she leapt to her knees in the soft bed and threw her
  arms round his neck, kissing him slowly on his cold cheeks.</p>

  <p>"Kind brother," she whispered in the voice of a lover, "sweet James! Who
  else have I? You shall guide me, you and you only."</p>

  <p>Moray did not return her kisses, her caresses. He told himself that she
  was not only sullied, but depraved. Yet, when he had thrust her from him and
  she lay, rebuffed and drooping on the pillows, he believed in her guileless,
  simple honesty.</p>

  <p>The Queen listened to the door closing on her half-brother. She
  laughed.</p>

  <p>"Is he not a proper gentleman? If he had been my cousin instead of my
  brother, I would have solved everything by marrying him."</p>

  <p>Mary Seaton spilled her beads into her lap and yawned.</p>

  <p>"Madame, I think him black, dull, and tedious."</p>

  <p>"Valiant, though, Mary. A bold, strong fellow. I like these men who must
  rule. Sometimes he hates me because he is misbegotten. He wants to be King,
  and yet he loves me, too."</p>

  <p>"I think so, madame. I hope so, seeing what power he has."</p>

  <p>"I like to play with him. A priest become a Puritan, is not that curious?
  A lost heretic, my poor James, damned for other secret sins as well, do you
  not think so?"</p>

  <p>"How can I tell, madame?"</p>

  <p>"I swear there is no ice in his veins. The King, his father, was no
  dullard. James is so strict and godly, so precise and sober, do you not think
  he gluts himself in secret?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, well! I've heard no tales."</p>

  <p>"He would be careful. A threadbare prudence, like his coat." She flung
  back the coverlet and sat on the edge of the mattress, her feet on the
  bedstep. "How he will hate Harry Stewart." She took off her caul and the
  harsh, stiff, crimped hair hung loose to her waist. "Is there dancing
  to-night?"</p>

  <p>"If you wish, madame?"</p>

  <p>"No. But let them play some music in the next chamber, so that we can hear
  it. I ought to think, but I never can, when I try I dream of love and fall
  asleep. Did you see how I probed his mind and did not let him know my
  own?"</p>

  <p>"He'll know it soon enough, madame, too soon for comfort&mdash;when Lord
  Darnley comes to Holyrood."</p>

  <p>"To-morrow, Mary, to-morrow. Tell me what you thought of him."</p>

  <p>"Again?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, again, I want to talk about him!" The Queen rose and stood on the
  silk rug before the fire; the glow of the flames shone through the gauze
  shift, outlining her white body. "There was never another like him,
  never."</p>

  <p>She put her restless hands on Mary Seaton's smooth, bright hair.</p>

  <p>"I am as tall as my father they say, but he can lift me, easily."</p>

  <p>"Did he try?"</p>

  <p>"Into the saddle, yes. Come, you are so slow, if you were me, would you
  not take him?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, madame, I wonder!" The girl lifted earnest eyes.</p>

  <p>"Being a Queen, one would not want to please oneself only&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why not? One will never please any other." Her exquisite face dimpled.
  "James would like an image of ice to sit at the board and sign his papers.
  Perhaps I have been too fashioned to his liking, too pliant, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I only thought&mdash;" Mary Seaton rose, "if Lord Darnley was not
  worth&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Queen stopped her.</p>

  <p>"Oh, his worth! Would you not like the man to embrace you? Would you not
  like to see him agonized with love?"</p>

  <p>The two French girls held the gilt-lipped vases of milk and slowly poured
  them into the alabaster bath. The white fluid flowed round the breasts of the
  Queen as she sang to herself quietly. From her rounded mouth the melody rose
  like a trickle of silver.</p>

  <p>She sang a poem by Pierre Ronsard, who admired her so much, who had
  praised her so extravagantly. It was about a lovely girl who had died young;
  on her grave were tossed a basket of roses and a vase of milk.</p>

  <p>The Queen wished she had rose-petals to strew in her bath. In France one
  could get them, early and late in the year, grown under glass, but here it
  was so cold, the summer so short, the flowers so few. Even the milk was
  difficult to obtain; milch cows had to be kept specially and the Puritans
  were insolent even about a trifle like that.</p>

  <p>The French girls poured in more milk; it rose to the Queen's chin; she
  stirred her limbs in the full bath. The room was very warm. Mary Seaton threw
  perfumes on the fire so that the air was thick and close. The Queen felt
  drowsy and rather sad. Already her life seemed to have been unfortunate. When
  she was a little child she had dwelt in a castle on a lake to be away from
  rebels and enemies. She thought that she could remember it, grey, cold, with
  low clouds flying round the standard on the tower.</p>

  <p>When she thought of France she sighed. She had had to work so hard at her
  lessons and behave so straightly under the eye of her stern grandmother, who
  always dressed in green serge and kept her coffin where she had to pass it on
  her way to chapel. But there had been something grand and splendid about her
  French life, and when she became older she had enjoyed much more freedom. She
  had liked her uncles, the soldier and the priest, they had understood her and
  taught her so much. She recalled how the Cardinal would lift up her hair and
  kiss the nape of her neck and sigh a little. It had been gorgeous to be Queen
  of France, a bright and vital position. When Mary Tudor died she had been
  Queen of England too; she had had much satisfaction in quartering the
  Leopards. How could Elizabeth, who was a bastard and a heretic, be Queen? But
  the English people had chosen her and it had been necessary to give way.</p>

  <p>Not perhaps to give way for ever. Her uncles had told her to flatter
  Elizabeth and win her rights by guile, even to sanction the persecution of
  the Romanists for a while.</p>

  <p>She stirred in the warm milk. The French girls, who wore white aprons and
  had their sleeves rolled to the elbows, were preparing another bath of clear
  water.</p>

  <p>The Queen smiled, thinking how clever and docile she had been. She had
  allowed her half-brother and his friend, Maitland, to do everything, though
  she believed they had both been traitors once and might be again. On every
  disputed point she had given way. Mass was heard nowhere in Scotland save in
  her own Chapel of Holy-rood, where even the Church had been desecrated and
  ruined. But some day, surely the Pope, or the King of Spain, or her little
  brother-in-law of France would help her to crush the heretics, not only in
  Scotland but in England, where she was also rightful Sovereign.</p>

  <p>She closed her eyes, the milk lapping at her ears. If she were married to
  a strong, valiant prince, one who would defy Moray, she might do this. She
  loved the thought of a master, one who would take her, body, soul, affairs,
  and rule. Was Henry Stewart such a one? He was the handsomest creature she
  had ever seen. She smiled secretly, thinking of his blushes, his shy air
  touched with sullenness. What did he know of love? He was so young, his
  haughty mother had kept him so close&mdash;perhaps he knew nothing. How Moray
  would hate him! He detested the idea of her having a lover.</p>

  <p>She thought of her young husband with pity and abhorrence. That had been a
  travesty of marriage, a mockery of passion. How he had slavered and moaned
  tor her kindness! Sometimes he burnt with fever, sometimes he was cold,
  soaked with sweat, always there were foul exhalations from his body, and he
  coughed and strangled, and sores came out on his joints.</p>

  <p>He was the King and she had had to lie down beside him and hold him while
  he tried to sleep. Sometimes in the dark he would whisper, begging her to
  pray that he might die.</p>

  <p>For the last months of his life he had been quite imbecile, staring, with
  his finger in his mouth, and shaking his head for the pain of his diseased
  ear.</p>

  <p>The Queen's thoughts turned again to Henry Stewart. How different marriage
  would be with him! She felt brushed by light when she thought of him. With a
  carefree movement she rose and stepped out of the bath, the drops of milk
  like pearls on her nude body.</p>

  <p>The French girls were chattering with Mary Seaton, giggling over love,
  clothes, and satanism. Mary Seaton was pious, but sometimes she liked to hear
  of these things. How could one live in the Court and not know of these smooth
  seducements and tempting sorceries? These amorous tales that made all the
  prudes secretly malcontent?</p>

  <p>The Queen entered the bath of pure, greenish water that became delicately
  clouded by the drops of milk from her body.</p>

  <p>"He was seen setting spells in the tennis court," laughed Renée.</p>

  <p>"Who?" asked the Queen. "And in the tennis court! So public a place?"</p>

  <p>"It was at dusk, madame, and lonely, being the winter, you understand.
  Another saw his familiar&mdash;a great ape, as I live&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who is this?" asked the Queen. She moved languidly in the bath, watching
  her white limbs, slightly distorted under the water; nearly everyone was
  accused of sorcery. Some said that John Knox was a wizard. Lord Ruthven knew
  about black arts; he had given her a protective amulet, half ashamed of his
  own beliefs.</p>

  <p>The French girls would not reply; they laughed together, fingering the
  jars of cream, the pots of unguents, the combs and tweezers needed for the
  adornment of their mistress.</p>

  <p>"You're fooling me," said the Queen pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"Madame," said Mary Seaton, "they speak of Earl Bothwell."</p>

  <p>The Queen was silenced, but her narrowed eyes eyes shone with interest.
  The man had an infamous reputation, he was disgraced, outlawed for plots and
  brawls. He had broken prison and gone to France. People still talked of him
  with dread and fear.</p>

  <p>Encouraged by the silence of their mistress the girls continued their
  gossip.</p>

  <p>"He has three wives and one is a witch. He can raise the wind."</p>

  <p>"What makes you talk about him?" asked the Queen keenly.</p>

  <p>"Idleness," said Mary Seaton. "They must chatter about ghosts and devils
  and demon lovers, so the talk turned on to Lord Bothwell."</p>

  <p>"Is he a demon?" demanded the Queen.</p>

  <p>"Oh, madame! But you know what is said of him!"</p>

  <p>"Do I? Not all, I suppose. He was my mother's faithful servant, I cannot
  hate him."</p>

  <p>She lay in her bath musing on this man whose image had been suddenly
  evoked. Moray loathed him, Moray had enclosed him in the Castle because of
  some lunatic talk on the part of Arran, who was imbecile. But she, the Queen,
  had contrived his escape. If Moray had known that, he would have said some
  terrible things. Being a woman and so hemmed in, she had to use guile and
  sometimes it was successful.</p>

  <p>How the girls loved to talk about Bothwell and his vices, his black arts,
  his courage, his strength, his treacheries in love! How the men detested him,
  except his own kin, and men like Huntly, who were ruined and desperate!</p>

  <p>The Queen splashed in the bath.</p>

  <p>Bothwell was the superior of all of them. Until Henry Stewart came to
  Scotland there was not his peer in the country. He had been bred a Frenchman
  and was so elegant and accomplished, so gay and courteous, he made his fellow
  Scots appear like boors, filthy boors some of them, the Red Douglas, Morton,
  for instance&mdash;she could never think of him without nausea.</p>

  <p>She listened, as she moved idly under the water, to the girls gossiping
  over Bothwell's mistresses, all the creatures whom he had ruined, trampling
  simplicity, trust and gaiety into the dirt, like a swine, for all his beauty.
  The Queen laughed in her throat. She knew that all these deserted women had
  offered themselves to the man with the infamous reputation, pleading to be
  taken.</p>

  <p>She rose out of the bath and stood while the girls dried her with fine
  linen. She compared in her mind these three men, Moray, Bothwell, Darnley.
  There was something to admire in all of them. She glanced at the blood-red
  ring that hung between her breasts. She remembered how her half-brother had
  looked at it when he sat by her bed, and she laughed with a joyous sense of
  power.</p>

  <p>The festival to welcome Lord Lennox and his son to Holyrood had been
  devised by the Queen herself. She was very adroit in elegant entertainments
  which she had learnt at the Louvre in Paris, at Chenonceaux, the château on
  the water, and Saint Germain-en-Laye. She liked something surprising, odd,
  fantastic. The Feast of the Bean that she had held the other day, that had
  been delightful. Mary Livingstone had found the Bean in her slice of the
  cake, and she had been chosen Queen of the Feast.</p>

  <p>Her mistress had lent her a superb white and blue gown covered with silver
  pailettes that she had worn as Queen of France, and many of the Valois jewels
  that she had brought from Paris. That was a pretty, dainty fancy. It had been
  delicious to stand aside and see this mock queen receive homage. To-night
  there was to be some new-fangled fancies, a masque of Russians, a masque of
  monsters, and, perhaps, Mary Fleming as queen. She was going to marry William
  Maitland, who was much too old for her, and who was really a little in love
  with the true Queen. She liked him, he was so fine, so adroit, so
  unscrupulous, so open-minded; he despised rough, coarse Calvinists like
  Lindsay or Ruthven, he even a little despised Moray.</p>

  <p>The Queen was dressed. She wore a black velvet jacket with a pinched waist
  that was unbuttoned on a shirt of cut needlework, breeches with silver tags
  and laces, and black hose. Her crimped hair was tied with a gold ribbon in
  long tresses above one ear, and on the other side of the head the hair was
  gathered under a flat cap on which was a tiny circlet of pearls, a jest of a
  royal crown.</p>

  <p>Her face was exquisitely painted, crimson on the pouting lips, gold dust
  on the shaven brows. This disguise of an insolent boy, a pert manikin, a
  court monkey, made her appear seductively, dangerously feminine.</p>

  <p>It was Mary Livingstone, a little uneasy, who was dressed like a queen and
  forced to hold a mock court in the centre of the long gallery at Holyrood.
  This left the Queen quite free to follow her whim. She stood apart with Mary
  Seaton and the French girls. A great many people were there, even those who
  most disliked festivals, even those grim Lords of the Congregation whom she
  took to be no better than rebels. Clumsy and rough, they stood aside in
  groups, condemning, wondering, hostile, and rude. They were not bred for
  palaces nor even for cities. They were at home in their own castles, stern
  moated holds, or riding the heather with a bag of porridge and a plate slung
  on their saddles for their day's rations. Some of them could bring a thousand
  men into the field if there was a foray or a raid or a rebellion. The Queen
  was first amused at them, then annoyed at the poor show they made.</p>

  <p>Henry Stewart came from England where he had been at the Court of
  Elizabeth; no doubt Windsor, Richmond, and Greenwich were far more splendid
  than Holyrood The Queen did not want her estate despised by Henry. Stewart;
  she wished she could have received him in the Louvre or at Fontainebleau. She
  was vexed that she was no longer Queen of France; she had fitted so exactly
  into that setting, like a cut and polished jewel into the circle of a ring.
  She was glad that Earl Bothwell had seen her in Paris in her sophisticated
  magnificence.</p>

  <p>Moray saw her and frowned at her disguise; it was just these tricks that
  made the preachers thunder against her wantonness. He whispered to Maitland,
  who shrugged, amused. He thought that the Queen's coquetry was delicious.</p>

  <p>"It is a charming symbol of royalty," he said, "as pretty as a carkanet or
  a sceptre, a chain or a globe."</p>

  <p>Moray did not reply; the lightness of Maitland often jarred on him; the
  man always edged away from definite action, definite speeches.</p>

  <p>The angered Lords, who felt humiliated by their own uncouthness, gathered
  round Moray, though he did not encourage them. They admired him for his
  intelligence, his clean living, his disdain of violence, his godliness. He
  kept himself aloof from them though he was aware of all they did. He smiled
  at Lindsay and Argyll who were his sisters' husbands, he spoke to Ruthven and
  Cassilis, he was friendly with Erskine and Atholl, men far more moderate and
  intelligent than the others, but he disclosed his mind to none.</p>

  <p>Lennox and his son were late. This caused great dissatisfaction that
  swelled into angry talk under cover of the masque of the Muscovites.</p>

  <p>This dance of men in skins, with white masks, shaking bells, and moving in
  and out of one another in mazy patterns seemed absurd and childish to the
  Scots Lords. Nor could they understand the French jests uttered by the
  dancers, at which the Queen's household laughed so shrilly.</p>

  <p>They discussed the recall of Lennox in whose honour this feast was given;
  comments, opinion, maledictions leaped in and out of dark conjecture and
  surmise.</p>

  <p>Lennox was of royal descent, so was his wife, Margaret. He had played the
  traitor and fought with the English on the Borders, because his rival, the
  head of the Hamiltons, had been chosen Regent for the young Queen. For twenty
  years he had been banished, his estates confiscated, his sons had been bred
  as Englishmen&mdash;now he was suddenly recalled and restored to his honours.
  Why? Because he was a Roman Catholic? Because of some subtle policy on the
  part of tricky Elizabeth and her Cecil?</p>

  <p>The Hamiltons were furious; not one of them was there. The chief of them,
  the Duke of Châtelherault, who had been the Regent, pretended to be sick. His
  son, Arran, had aspired to marry one of the Queens. He was now a lunatic and
  shut up.</p>

  <p>What did Lennox hope to do? The Lords thought of him with fury; he would
  not find a friend, no, not one, except the Lennox Stewarts on his own lands
  at Glasgow.</p>

  <p>There had been some talk of the elder Lennox boy marrying the Queen. Did
  anyone think that the Lords would endure that? Those who had seen him at
  Wemyss Castle said he looked like a girl; he was quite beardless and smooth
  and everything he said was silly and insolent. Could the Queen fancy such a
  one?</p>

  <p>Under the shield of the Muscovites' bells and the scrape of the violins
  and the giddy laughter of the French at the indecent jokes of the masquers,
  Patrick, Lord Ruthven, muttered the name of Chastelard&mdash;was not he also
  lady-faced, a weedy nothing, fond of lute strumming and sickly verses? How
  could one tell where the caprice of a woman would lead her?</p>

  <p>So the Lords, with no regard for civility or good company muttered and
  complained, uneasy, hostile, while the masquers ran about the smooth floor of
  the gallery shaking their branches of bells, bouncing up and down in their
  furs.</p>

  <p>Moray sought out the Queen where she sat in her fantastic disguise under
  the musicians' gallery. She looked pensive and he thought this a good moment
  to give her some honest advice.</p>

  <p>"No one is pleased about the return of Lennox," he said.</p>

  <p>"No one is pleased with anything that I do."</p>

  <p>"Have you done this? Didn't the English Queen send him?"</p>

  <p>"Why should she?" the Queen shrugged away. "Is it to her advantage that I
  should marry the heir to Scotland?"</p>

  <p>"She knows the boy. She can, perhaps, guess at you&mdash;since you are
  both in her way. Maybe she would be pleased if you destroyed each other."</p>

  <p>The Queen seemed startled; the smooth face under the page's cap
  frowned.</p>

  <p>"How could we&mdash;destroy each other?"</p>

  <p>Moray sighed. He was a gloomy figure in his rubbed velvet, his sole jewel
  the Order of the Thistle on his broad breast.</p>

  <p>"Scotland," he said, "would not endure this marriage&mdash;there is not a
  man would hail Henry Stewart as King." He seated himself stiffly on the stool
  beside her. How small, how ridiculous the tall woman, who could be so
  majestic, looked in the page's dress!</p>

  <p>It seemed absurd that she was his Queen&mdash;his sister. He began to
  plead with her, warmly, awkwardly, dropping all titles of respect. His thick
  eyebrows twitched over his intense dark eyes, his sulky, sensual mouth was
  dry.</p>

  <p>The Queen listened, lolling on her cushion.</p>

  <p>"Do not do it, Mary. Lennox is a weak, rascally adventurer; to set him up
  will offend everyone. The boy is untamed, a downright fool, some say. A
  Papist, too. You know how badly that will go down. Do not marry him."</p>

  <p>"Whom am I to marry, then?" She looked down the spacious gallery where the
  candles shone above the masquers and the grumbling Lords. Her voice was
  humble, her attitude meek. Moray stared at the crimped tresses tied under the
  jaunty cap.</p>

  <p>"Wait. I will find you a husband. A man, one capable of ruling
  Scotland."</p>

  <p>"You can do that for me, James&mdash;rule Scotland."</p>

  <p>"But not for Henry Stewart."</p>

  <p>She glanced sharply over her shoulder at him; she seemed pleased to see
  him moved; she laughed as if his urgent gaze excited her, as if his husky
  voice roused her curiosity. "Go on," she whispered.</p>

  <p>"You mock me. I want to save you. Don't you see? You are in such a
  perilous place. Only I, helped by Maitland, could keep you there!" He began
  to plead. "Mary, couldn't you trust me? Believe in me and no one else?" He
  took her slack hand and began to caress it with his large, smooth fingers.
  "Remain without a husband, Mary, play a long patient game, wait, till we find
  the man who suits us&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She gazed at him tenderly; he held stubbornly to his impossible desire.
  Then he added:</p>

  <p>"Leave it to me. If you will stay unmarried&mdash;I&mdash;I could
  forgive&mdash;I could excuse some womanish weakness. If you were discreet, I
  might endure your singers and chamber boys&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, you are too jealous."</p>

  <p>Her face, warm, pale, with the freshly painted mouth, was close to his;
  this proximity forced him to reveal himself.</p>

  <p>"Mary! Cannot you remain as you are? The Queen. Without lovers or a
  husband? Enclosed in royalty? Scotland!" He bowed his head over her hand. "I
  swear to God," came his muffled voice, "that you should always be safe and
  happy."</p>

  <p>She did not disturb him; many unspoken thoughts went to and fro like
  shuttles between them as they sat in the alcove. What he said tempted her
  facile mind. To be the Queen and nothing else! A decked, immaculate image
  high above the heads of men, regarded with reverence and awe, a symbol of
  royalty, of purity, of grandeur, every man in love with her, no one daring to
  approach her, she above the need of love, wedded to her regal state. While
  Moray, the royal born, who had missed the throne by a Church ceremony, stood
  for ever guarding her, keeping everyone at bay, exalting her, making her
  admired, prosperous, great. He saw her hesitation and for a second cherished
  a stupid hope.</p>

  <p>"Could you do it, Mary?"</p>

  <p>She played with him, half deluded by her own subterfuge. "Why not? I trust
  you."</p>

  <p>She meant that, though she knew that he had taken money from England arid
  once intrigued with Elizabeth against her sovereignty. But she was sure that
  as long as she was near him, smiling at him, deferring to him, he would serve
  her well, as no other could or would.</p>

  <p>"Well, then, let this silly youth go."</p>

  <p>She sat so meekly that he ventured further.</p>

  <p>"I can only do it if you listen to me, obey me, follow my advice. I cannot
  protect you if there are scandals."</p>

  <p>The Queen drew a lazy breath; his hopes increased. He reminded himself
  that she had stood beside him to see John Gordon mangled, that she had called
  him in to slay Chastelard. Perhaps, after all, she did secretly prefer him to
  any other man. He saw himself master of Scotland, and the Queen, disdaining
  all pretenders, hated, perhaps, but high-set and proudly enclosed in the
  people's esteem.</p>

  <p>He began to kiss her fingers, which he had kept in his until their two
  palms were moist.</p>

  <p>The noisy masque came to an end. The mummers trooped off, chattering in
  French.</p>

  <p>The violins began to fill the silence with a delicate concord. The Queen's
  mood changed, like water running out from shade into open places changes in
  colour. She rose, taking her hand swiftly from Moray's lips.</p>

  <p>"What a poor, ragged company," she smiled. "Everywhere the work of country
  tailors and the manners of boors. We need Earl Bothwell here&mdash;I thought
  of recalling him, if it is only for the grace he gives to a festival."</p>

  <p>Moray was deeply angered by this sudden insult as he took it to be. All
  his hopes sank, leaving bitterness behind. "When Earl Bothwell returns to
  Scotland, I leave it, madame."</p>

  <p>"Oh James, you are too sullen and precise. What has the man done? No worse
  than any other."</p>

  <p>Furious at the introduction of this detested name, Moray replied
  sternly:</p>

  <p>"I hope you do not know what he has done. His name stinks. Don't speak of
  him. There are some things not to be named for honour's sake."</p>

  <p>"How odd that he escaped from the Castle," smiled the Queen, ignoring this
  rebuke. "He twisted the iron bars apart with his hands and slid down the face
  of the rock with a rope&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A tale to amuse children," sneered Moray. "Some foul bribery got him
  out."</p>

  <p>"But he is very strong. He can dance in full armour. So skilful, too;
  whenever he rides at the ring he takes the prize."</p>

  <p>Moray moved away; he had no more words for her to mock. How could she,
  when he had opened his heart to her, wound him by the mention of the
  abominable man whom he, with every justification, loathed? Again, and
  painfully, he doubted her integrity, and her innocence. How much did she know
  of James Hepburn, this damned Earl Bothwell, enmeshed in the infernal arts?
  Moray made a movement as if washing his hands and turned away. Accursed swine
  of a sorcerer!</p>

  <p>Lord Lennox and his son, with a retinue of Stewarts, arrived as the masque
  of monsters was beginning. They were exactly at the time that the Queen had
  named and Lennox was troubled to find that the festival was so well advanced.
  This gave him an air of negligence and he was very anxious to please. He
  hoped that the Queen would remember the time that she had set. He paused
  inside the low door, biting his forefinger, with his son beside him.</p>

  <p>The entrance was quite filled up by his followers; he was very careful how
  he went about Edinburgh, where he had no friends, where he had not set foot
  for twenty years. He was a tall, nobly shaped man, but stooped as if he bore
  a burden on his back and his face was yellow, puffy, and swollen about the
  eyes.</p>

  <p>The monsters paraded down the gallery; they were acting on orders from the
  Queen in taking no heed of the newcomers. She had purposely arranged that
  Lennox should come late when the hall was full so that she might observe the
  effect of Henry Stewart's entry on the Lords.</p>

  <p>She crept along the arras and watched the isolated group, of whom no one
  took any notice. Inside the door, Lennox, peering between the monsters with
  their ogre heads, shaggy coats and lashing tails, espied the dais with the
  lions and the figure there round whom the ladies crowded.</p>

  <p>Uncertainly, but with the air of a man who forces himself to hold his own,
  he made his way towards the mock queen.</p>

  <p>This was an anxious moment for him. His return to Scotland had been quite
  a speculation; already he wished that he had remained in England, even though
  there had been a Proclamation by four heralds at the Market Cross restoring
  him to all his honours and estates. All the Lords were so hostile and
  jealous, so keen to do him a mischief, so resentful of past injuries. The
  Hamiltons were so much against him, and Arran, by a lucky chance, was shut up
  as a lunatic, but there were so many of them. He really doubted if he could
  hold his own. There was Moray, too, who seemed all-powerful with the Queen;
  he was sure to be envious and bitter. Lennox thought of all the money he had
  spent; seven hundred pounds he had brought with him from England and it had
  nearly all been squandered in furnishings, clothes, entertainments, presents.
  He had had to give the four Maries jewels, watches, fans. How casually the
  greedy little hussies had accepted these gifts and, no doubt, forgotten them
  already! Perhaps all this expenditure was wasted. There was just the hope
  that his son, Harry, might take the fancy of the Queen. Would he? Lennox was
  doubtful. The boy was young and knew no arts. The English Queen, who had a
  critical eye for masculine charm, had passed him over as "yonder long lad."
  Lennox felt hot, sick and baffled as he pulled at the starched cambric at his
  neck, conscious of the ribald masquers who seemed to mock him with venomous
  satisfaction as they pranced up and down. Then there were the cold frowns of
  the Lords, gathered together, conversing, he was sure, in abusive
  whispers.</p>

  <p>His son plucked at his sleeve, breathing in his ear.</p>

  <p>"This is not the Queen but Mary Livingstone dressed up as a joke."</p>

  <p>"What shall we do?"</p>

  <p>"I shall find her."</p>

  <p>Everyone was staring at Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley, as he, blushing,
  angry and clumsy, made his way through the crowd looking for the Queen.</p>

  <p>Moray, adroitly behind Argyll, surveyed the Lennox boy with a bitter
  curiosity and what her saw made him feel old, defeated and foolish. Beside
  the princely grandeur of Lord Darnley the artificial splendours of the
  festival seemed dusty, withered, and insipid. He was not full grown, but
  already as tall as the tallest of the gaunt Lords, as tall as Moray himself.
  He had a deep chest and wide shoulders, he carried himself with an
  unthinking, rather crude arrogance, like a young bull. He stood firmly,
  keeping his feet far apart and often sticking his clenched fists into his
  waist. His face was in truth like that of Adonis, round features with a warm
  golden bloom and full lips. His eyes were clear hazel with the lustre of
  perfect health. He would be fleshy; already there was a hint of that. He had
  the sullen, slightly suspicious air of one stupid and easily baffled; he had
  the insolent swagger of one forcing his character, but with all these
  defects, his physical magnificence was not easily discounted.</p>

  <p>His attire was too splendid and looked gaudy amid the ill-clad, uncouth
  Lords. It also destroyed the balance of the superb shape of his body. A
  padded doublet of white velvet covered with gold tracery, for which the
  tailor had not yet been paid, made his torso appear enormous; a ruff of bone
  lace starched and wired shortened the appearance of his neck and kept his
  head stiffly fixed; his huge, shapeless sleeves, stuffed, gashed and laced,
  made his smooth hands appear quite small. His legs, tightly clad in yellow
  silk, seemed too slim to support all this pomp. His thick, honey-coloured
  hair was brushed up on the top of his elegant head and tucked behind his
  right ear, from which hung a pearl.</p>

  <p>The Lords nudged, sneered, and cursed. The youth seemed to them an
  abomination, worse than the French whom the Queen had brought home with her,
  more offensive than Earl Bothwell, with his infamous reputation. Yet the gaze
  that Lord Darnley turned on them as he avoided their grouped hostility was
  candid, defiant, almost pathetic, like that of an outwitted child.</p>

  <p>Moray did not sneer nor misjudge, did not condemn nor scorn. He saw quite
  clearly the attraction of the boy and he felt a physical sickness, a
  prickling on his skin, a rasping in the throat, a trembling in his hands,
  that were, he knew, the symptoms of a jealousy that could not be controlled.
  He felt a desire to escape as if he were imprisoned in a drain, a yearning to
  find an outlet to the light, the air. With no excuse to anyone he left the
  overheated gallery.</p>

  <p>Lord Darnley found his cousin where she had been waiting for him in an
  alcove.</p>

  <p>Timidly, with eyes full of humility, the Queen looked up at her cousin.
  The young man stood over her with an air of shame; he looked amazed at her
  fantastic, insolent costume. He complained of his reception, that she mocked
  him, that all the Lords were hostile, he harped on her kindness at Wemyss, he
  asked why she played with him. She had to listen very attentively to catch
  what he said, for she was not at all familiar with English.</p>

  <p>That did not matter; his words were of no importance; she reassured him by
  her timid smile as she examined his fair face with the frowning brows, the
  clear eyes, the angry curved mouth, the lustrous ringlets of close hair. She
  said in a low, cajoling voice:</p>

  <p>"I, too, have to suffer from the arrogance of these people. Do you think
  it is easy? You can see for yourself. My brother, too, Moray, he rules
  everything. Watch how they spy on us now, while we talk. I am only a woman, I
  was not bred to this country."</p>

  <p>She coaxed him for his promises of help, of protection, for his
  compassion. She seemed to search, gently, skilfully, after something elusive,
  potent. She begged him to release her from them all, from the pinched-faced
  Calvinists, from the dark Moray, from the slippery Lethington. The youth, who
  could not follow all she said, for she helped her English with French, gazed
  at her earnestly, held by the inescapable radiance of her eyes. He had never
  even imagined anything like her before. She quite amazed him in her page's
  dress, with her little cap and long tresses, with her fluent speech and gay,
  quick gestures, with her short jacket and tight hose. It was as if she wove a
  net round him. He frowned, wondering what she wanted him to do. Would she
  marry him? Ought he to ask her? He wanted to get away and think. To consult
  his father, since his mother, who was so much wiser&mdash;and so much more
  indulgent&mdash;was not there.</p>

  <p>The Queen stopped speaking and began to laugh. All this magnificence
  standing there dumb, afraid of her! She felt flattered&mdash;what would he
  like? What would make him speak? If she gave him Scotland? What would he do
  with it?</p>

  <p>As she stood there, the young man began to stammer and plead. What could
  he do? What did she want? Could he dance with her while she wore that
  whimsical dress?</p>

  <p>"You were not so shy at Wemyss," she said softly.</p>

  <p>Behind them were discordant voices. Many of the Lords were clattering
  away, rudely interrupting the dancers, jostling the French. She noticed that
  Moray had gone. Lennox was moving about uneasily, making loud, ineffectual
  conversation with acquaintances; he seemed stupefied, even browbeaten. Every
  time a page offered him wine he drank. Lord Ruthven followed him about,
  blinking at him with bloodshot, rapacious eyes, sticking thumbs in his belt
  and asking news of England, demanding the name of the boy's tailor and if
  those were the latest Parisian fashions.</p>

  <p>Lord Darnley observed this from where he stood; he turned to stare, being
  unable to move his head because of the ruff and high collar. The Queen
  watched indolently the boy's slow rage as he saw his father being baited. He
  was like a young mastiff straining at a chain. It would be splendid to let
  such a devoted, ferocious creature loose on one's enemies.</p>

  <p>She detested Ruthven, who always looked at her with direct scorn. He was a
  lout, a boor, not fit to come into her presence, and there were many like
  him.</p>

  <p>She touched the young man's padded sleeve; how huge and virile he looked!
  If she married him, Ruthven, Lindsay and all the bilious Calvinists would
  have to cringe before him. That would be a malicious revenge on them for all
  their disloyalty, their harsh talk, their sour gossip. Ah, for a master, for
  them and for herself!</p>

  <p>Her fingers crept from his sleeve to his hand; he turned sharply, his
  jewelled, scented bulk between her and the gallery.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" he breathed eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Dear," she smiled indolently, "dear."</p>

  <p>She thought drowsily of Moray, jealous, resentful, reverencing her,
  wanting to set her up, to keep her immaculate as his Queen. She thought of
  the men whom Moray, with her consent, even, as it had seemed, by her command
  had sent to the scaffold.</p>

  <p>She looked up at her cousin and comforted herself with this fresh
  devotion, this clean youth, this untainted strength. Perhaps he was stupid!
  Well, she had had enough of clever men, intriguing for themselves. She put
  her hand on her cousin's firm, slightly-pouting lips and he kissed timidly
  her palm where Moray had kissed it a little while before. His sulky fairness
  reminded her of John Gordon whose blood she had watched, quite as if it was a
  thing of no consequence, ooze and spread over the planks of the scaffold.</p>

  <p>Ah, this lover Moray should not take away and destroy! It would be sweet,
  triumphal and glorious to have power, to be free of Moray, to rule, to love,
  to have the priests back, to banish the heretics and to defy the English.</p>

  <p>Moray walked through the misty streets. He had slipped the Jewel of the
  Thistle inside his coat and so looked, in the obscurity, like an ordinary
  citizen. He thought that this was far safer than going about with a crowd of
  armed, liveried followers to challenge riots and provoke brawls. Besides, he
  believed that there was no one with sufficient grudge against him to wish to
  attack him in the dark. He was popular with the godly, who overlooked his
  deep avarice, his grasping hold on confiscated Church lands, the other
  estates that he had acquired by dubious means.</p>

  <p>As he left the Abbey behind he felt cleansed, relieved, and confident of
  his half-sister. He did not believe that she would so carelessly forget what
  he had said to her as to marry Henry Stewart, though she might flirt with
  him. Moray tried to forget the youth's sulky, golden beauty, his large,
  unspoiled strength.</p>

  <p>The chill of the winter night had purified the filthy smells of the city,
  which was ill-lit, ill-kept. Moray carried a small lantern which showed him
  the dirt beneath his feet, the pools filmed with ice, the garbage and rotten
  refuse.</p>

  <p>Though he was fastidious he preferred this dirty street to the splendours
  of the Abbey. He had a strong feeling for the people&mdash;there was nothing
  in his veins but ancient Scotch blood. He was acutely conscious of the
  country, of its remoteness, poverty, violence and struggle to exist. He
  wanted to help Scotland. But it was difficult; everyone with whom he had to
  deal was greedy, treacherous or tainted by Papistry.</p>

  <p>Yet he did not feel despondent. His task seemed to him high and noble,
  worthy of a man's highest efforts. He no longer was pricked by fear of the
  Lennox boy, of Earl Bothwell, of the Queen's caprices. All these seemed
  manageable, something that he could hold in his hand.</p>

  <p>He raised his lantern to look at a deserted house that he passed. It had a
  bad reputation; the shadow of the triple Hecate brooded over it and it was
  shuttered bleakly against the night. A jolly, plump woman with a ringing
  laugh had lived there. She had been a witch, an abortionist, a seller of
  aphrodisiacs, of poisons, a trader in all that has no lawful price, no
  earthly market. She had lived under Bothwell's patronage, posing as his
  kinswoman.</p>

  <p>Moray shivered as he gazed fascinated at that barred, disused door and
  thought of what had happened in that house&mdash;infernal rites, abominable
  bargains and inhuman sacrifices. Maimed goats and swine had been found in the
  sties of the backyards and little foul-smelling graves in the garden.</p>

  <p>The woman had been discovered through a wretched affair that had reflected
  on the Queen. Two of her French servants were secret lovers. By the help of
  the fat woman with the cosy laugh they had murdered their little child, had
  been discovered and hanged, pelted with dirt by the Puritans, preached
  against by John Knox. The witch had fled. When her door was burst open, the
  house, reeking of drugs and worse, was empty. No doubt Earl Bothwell knew
  where the woman was hidden.</p>

  <p>Moray was glad of his own well-ordered home and the woman sleeping there,
  Agnes Keith, to whom he had lately been married. She had not troubled him for
  the love he had not got to give her, but she had roused in him a safe,
  pitying affection. He was grateful for her dignity, her effacement and her
  careful conduct of his establishment.</p>

  <p>Moray threaded nimbly past the taverns where the yellow light spurted,
  past the beggars bowed before the menace of the night, until he came to the
  high walls of his own garden.</p>

  <p>As he turned the key in the lock he felt easy, confident, sure even of the
  woman in the palace&mdash;she would never betray him, no, not with a lewd
  sorcerer, not with a stupid boy, not with any scoundrel at all.</p>

  <p>Lennox and his son sat up late in the lodgings for which they had not
  paid, among the handsome furniture that glossed their poverty. The elder man
  urged the younger, standing over him, now goading, now pleading, sometimes
  almost whining, then threatening.</p>

  <p>"Get the Queen, get the Queen&mdash;any way, by any means! Doesn't she
  fancy you? Isn't that enough? You are only a blundering simpleton, you ought
  to be five years older. Compromise her, entangle her, don't you want to be
  King of Scotland?"</p>

  <p>The tall, heavy youth sat sullenly over the fire and let these reproaches
  batter at his ears. He felt hostile, offended, even shocked. He had never
  been intimate with his father, who had only lately taken any notice of him.
  He wished that his mother was there. She had always done everything for him,
  led him by flattery, advised him with soothing words, made him feel manly and
  free, even while she had told him exactly what to do, even to the way he wore
  his cap or fastened his collar, while his father, bullying, pleading, made
  him feel insignificant, dull, a mere cat's-paw to snatch the family fortunes
  out of the fire.</p>

  <p>Neither did the young man like the way his father spoke of the Queen.
  Close association with his austere and stately mother had given him an
  unconscious respect for women. Maternal pride, hoarding his youth, his
  beauty, his manliness had kept him from lewdness and debauchery; his emotions
  took long to rouse, his mind worked slowly. He was more interested in sport,
  in dogs, horses, and games, than in women.</p>

  <p>His feelings for the Queen baffled him; he wanted to keep them secret, to
  brood over them. He had been a little shocked to see her in the page's dress;
  he did not like to hear his father talk of her without respect, as if she was
  easy, light, almost shameless. He did not want a wife and he felt a definite
  shrinking from such a wife as his cousin might be&mdash;a creature whom he
  could neither understand nor manage.</p>

  <p>He stared, with his round, childlike eyes into the fire, his hands on his
  knees, and endured his father's advice, reprimands, and urgings.</p>

  <p>Lennox became at length exasperated by this mute resentment. He thought
  the boy impudent, and longed to strike him or to shake him. This was the
  result of a woman's upbringing&mdash;a lout who knew nothing, who blushed
  when a coquette spoke to him, who saw a crown dangling in front of him and
  gaped at it without moving.</p>

  <p>"Have you nothing to say?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I do not know if&mdash;I like her."</p>

  <p>Lennox became confused with rage; he stuck his thumbs into his belt and
  sighed. The youth continued, frowning with the effort of his speech:</p>

  <p>"She seems so much older than I&mdash;and to marry a queen, that is always
  to take second place&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not if she makes you King, you fool."</p>

  <p>"Would she?"</p>

  <p>He moved uneasily, thinking of how she had put her hand to his mouth and
  said: "Dear&mdash;Dear&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He tried to think it out. What was the matter? No doubt his father was
  quite right, this was a brilliant chance, the most wonderful princess in the
  world. But he did not really want her. He had thought of girls in a vague,
  tender, brooding fashion&mdash;but she, the Queen, was not part of those
  dreams.</p>

  <p>She troubled and vexed him and he did not really want to see her again.
  That pert, shameless costume dress! He did not think a gentlewoman would
  dress like that. He did not want a wife who looked like a mummer. As for all
  these intrigues, these schemes, this winding in and out of one's friends, and
  enemies, he simply could not think of it without a headache. If only his
  father would stop talking! He felt drowsy and with difficulty suppressed a
  yawn. Was not life quite enjoyable even if one did not marry the Queen?</p>

  <p>Lennox, watching him, saw he was half-asleep and had a violent impulse to
  box his ears. But he controlled himself and talked about other things. He
  realized, even in his rage, that he must gain his son's confidence, flatter
  him, lead him on gently, even treat him with respect. After all, he played
  for a big prize.</p>

  <p>After the festival at Holyrood that had welcomed Lennox to court, the
  Queen retired into her own apartments and was seldom seen.</p>

  <p>When she did appear she wore her widow's mourning and her manner was
  remote and melancholy.</p>

  <p>Moray triumphed quietly, the Hamiltons began to hold up their heads, and
  the Lennox faction to become very uneasy. On Henry Stewart, however, this
  withdrawal acted like an enticement; he became covetous of those favours that
  she had seemed to promise, but had not, after all, given.</p>

  <p>He was remorseful because he had considered her to be fickle, and
  dangerous. He knelt behind her in the chapel at Holyrood and his thoughts
  were all chivalrous, pure, even noble. He wanted to serve her, to protect
  her. He was ashamed that he could not love her, but he was eager to try to do
  so if she would give him another chance. He disliked and mistrusted the men
  who surrounded her, so much rougher and more menacing than those he had been
  bred among in England. Only Moray and Maitland seemed to him like noblemen,
  like gentlemen. He despised the others and let his contempt show in his fair,
  candid face. He detested the Puritans too. The English Protestants had
  scarcely interfered with him, but these extreme Calvinists, the bold,
  reckless-tongued followers of John Knox who meddled with everything that was
  pleasant and amusing, these black-visaged Scots, he hated.</p>

  <p>He felt sorry for the Queen, forced to live among such detestable people,
  and, kneeling at his red velvet prie-dieu, he looked at her anxiously, and
  with compassion.</p>

  <p>The Queen felt free in the chapel where no Protestant ever entered, where
  she was alone with her household and her friends, where she heard no alien
  Scots tongue, but only the Latin and the French with which she was
  familiar.</p>

  <p>She knelt erect, slim, and stately in her heavy black robe. Her bright
  hair was gathered under a little cap, her beads of ebony, her crucifix of
  ivory hung at her waist. She kept her hands lightly joined together. She was
  conscious of the splendid young man behind her, gazing at her with a
  reluctant adoration. The place, walled against the light, with carvings and
  windows of coloured glass, soothed her sensuous nature. The smoke from the
  pure wax candles mingled with the incense from the thurible.</p>

  <p>The priest sang, the choir chanted, at the altar frontal the altar
  ornaments shimmered like sunshine on a water-break.</p>

  <p>The Queen's mood became exalted, she felt an impulse of piety towards this
  God whose worship was so luxurious, so pleasant. Yes, she believed this was
  the one ancient and true Faith. How delicious to think of Heaven, as gorgeous
  as Fontainebleau, awaiting after one was satiated with the delights of the
  earth. She felt comforted to think of those strong angels and pitying saints
  watching over her; if she was guilty of some little sin they would see that
  she was forgiven. As long as she was true to them they would be true to her,
  save her, absolve and protect her. When she came at last to die they would
  lift her soul out of her body and carry it to lovely peace and cool
  magnificence.</p>

  <p>The singing ceased gently. The priests moved to and fro. The Queen rose,
  her black skirts spread out far either side of her tiny waist. As the priests
  passed, she bent her head humbly. When the priests and the choir had left the
  chapel she looked, unsmiling, over her shoulder at Henry Stewart, standing
  stiffly before his prie-dieu.</p>

  <p>He thought she was very smooth and meek and appealed for pity. He flushed
  slowly, feeling himself manly, strong, potent to save her fragile
  weakness.</p>

  <p>Florestan, the Queen's favourite monkey, had escaped. With his quick, dry
  brown hands he had broken his chain and run out of the Queen's chambers.</p>

  <p>He had soon been missed and was seen in various places, perched on a door,
  swinging on a fold of tapestry, running over the poles of a window
  curtain.</p>

  <p>The Queen became quite agitated; it was terrible to think of the frail
  little animal, lured by curiosity, wandering away from safety and comfort out
  into the cold, and perishing in the stinging wind and rain. So many of her
  pretty little monkeys had died since she came to Scotland, though she took
  such care with them.</p>

  <p>She lifted her long black skirts from her feet and ran here and there,
  down the corridors of the palace, as the alarm was given that here, there,
  the truant had been seen.</p>

  <p>A man whose face she knew quite well, but to whom she had never spoken.
  stopped in front of her and spoke very respectfully, bowing low.</p>

  <p>The monkey was in the chapel. If Her Majesty wished, he would get it for
  her, without a scandal.</p>

  <p>The Queen, curious, asked:</p>

  <p>"A scandal?"</p>

  <p>He explained himself. He spoke French very well, but she knew him to be an
  Italian, for she had already been to the trouble of discovering something
  about him, and she listened, leaning against the gilded wall. She liked his
  manner of speaking, and the mind behind the speech.</p>

  <p>Well, about the monkey; if the evil-minded Puritans got to know of it
  being in the chapel, they would say ugly things. It was better not to give
  such stupid fools a chance. If Her Grace understood him? These fanatics! They
  saw the devil everywhere. Even he, alone in the chapel by the light of one
  candle, had been quite startled when he had looked up suddenly and seen the
  monkey running about.</p>

  <p>He had gone there to fetch some music. Her Grace would not recall him, but
  he sang bass in the choir and had done so since Christmas.</p>

  <p>The Queen said:</p>

  <p>"I understand. Come with me and help me to catch Florestan. It will be a
  good thing if no one sees us. I remember you, yes, you came with the Duke of
  Savoy's envoy last autumn. You and your brother."</p>

  <p>She nodded to him to follow her to the chapel. The young man obeyed,
  nervous at being alone with the Queen, at whom he had so often looked over
  his book as he sang, but whom he had never thought to speak with. He was
  silent, wondering what he could do with this brilliant opportunity. His usual
  cleverness seemed of no use to him here. The Queen, careless and easy with
  everyone, hastened ahead to the chapel. She paused in the doorway. She had
  never seen this sanctified place save when there was a service. Now it seemed
  quite quenched and cold, with the one candle, burning to a blackened wick,
  stuck in a holder near the choir stalls.</p>

  <p>The light of this was sufficient to reveal Florestan crouched on the
  altar, gripping his thin legs with taut hands, while his shadow, huge and
  wavering, was flung on the sacred picture behind, like that of some aerial
  devil, hovering to corrupt the atmosphere.</p>

  <p>The Queen was startled. She drew back and touched the young man behind her
  and he lost his head, because he, poor wretch, had felt the Queen's gown
  brush him, her veil touch him. He could have put his arms round her
  shoulders, but he stood rigid, his large dark eyes shifting and furtive. He
  was used to the great world, but only as a servant.</p>

  <p>The Queen stared at him over the edge of her stiff ruff.</p>

  <p>"Catch Florestan for me. This is horrible, to see him on the altar." As he
  passed her, trying to master his self-consciousness, she asked: "Are you
  Giuseppe Rizzio?"</p>

  <p>"No, madame, my name is David. Giuseppe is my younger brother."</p>

  <p>She had known this, but wanted to force him to explain himself. She had
  often noticed him in the choir; he had extraordinary eyes, so dark and dense
  that the iris could not be distinguished from the pupil, and arched, lively
  brows. His face was thin, pale amber in colour, and healthy. He was quite
  elegant; there was something swift and eager about him, too. A pity that he
  was so shabby.</p>

  <p>She watched him, moving cautiously among the shadows, endeavouring to
  surprise Florestan. He had lit some more of the candles and the cross lights
  wavered, reaching tall and tremulous on the gilded fan tracery of the
  ceiling. They seemed far away from everyone else; it was not likely they
  would be looked for here.</p>

  <p>The young Italian moved cautiously, retreated, advanced, while Florestan
  watched him with melancholy eyes of imbecile mockery. The youth's slim body
  in the black clothes, his long dark hair which hung over his shoulders, his
  soundless tread, made him appear part of the shadows, a phantasmagoria, like
  a puppet-show against this strange background&mdash;man, monkey, in some
  malicious dance.</p>

  <p>As the monkey leaped suddenly on to the pyx the Queen crossed herself with
  a thrill of superstitious horror&mdash;it seemed, for a second, as if the
  devil were indeed loose in a holy place.</p>

  <p>The Italian sprang at the altar and grasped the animal. One of the candles
  went over with a clatter. Terribly excited, the little grey beast bit and
  scratched into the man's thin-clad arms, but without a murmur he carried him
  to the Queen in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"I will take him to your apartments, madame&mdash;he is too angry for you
  to touch him. Afterwards I shall return and put out the candles."</p>

  <p>He shook Florestan free of his arm, but gently, and grasped him by the
  collar.</p>

  <p>"You are hurt!" She saw the torn sleeve, the quick welling blood, and she
  smiled with pleasure at his bravery. She admired courage above all virtues.
  She leaned towards him. "Come, I will see that your arm is dressed."</p>

  <p>"I feel nothing," he answered, and it was true. He felt nothing of the
  wound because of his joy at having attracted the attention of the Queen. He
  was feasted, glutted by the miraculous moment.</p>

  <p>The two Italian boys lay snug in the cramped chamber in the servants'
  quarters that had been allotted to them when they joined the royal choir.
  They were shut away from all the grandeur of the palace like mice in
  wainscoting. Out of their hole they peered and pried, ran in and back,
  learning, noticing, for they were quick, neat, and patient, familiar with
  every scandal and rumour.</p>

  <p>David, who was the elder by three years, lay along the trestle-bed and
  proudly showed his bandaged arm.</p>

  <p>Mary Seaton had tended him, while the Queen looked on. In his deep, husky
  voice he related her gracious kindness, the dazzling richness of her
  apartments, her sweet, sharp beauty, which was far more marvellous when seen
  close than when viewed across the smoke-hazed chapel. He was quite bemused
  with his good luck and chattered foolishly as if his fortunes were already
  made.</p>

  <p>Giuseppe listened shrewdly. They had always been so poor and led a hard,
  adventurous life, kicked from this filthy drudgery to that, learning sly
  tricks and how to fawn and cringe. A gift of music had raised them from the
  scraps and the broken pots. They had come to Scotland in M. de Moreta's train
  and then found employment in the royal chapel because they were Romanists and
  there were not so many of these from which to choose voices.</p>

  <p>The little, dark room was cold. Giuseppe huddled under the patched
  coverlet of his bed; he hated these northern winters. He was not as sanguine
  as his brother; no one had taken any notice of him except to scold, cuff, or
  abuse. Lean, dark, and with huge eyes full of disillusion and prejudice, he
  listened to the boastings of the elder, who by the light of the coarse candle
  showed the arm bandaged in the Queen's apartment.</p>

  <p>"What did you ask of her?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Nothing. That was the cleverness. It would have been a great mistake to
  have taken a reward. Now she will remember me, try to do something for
  me."</p>

  <p>He fell silent, his chin in his hand, his long hair sweeping over his
  face. The sudden thought that this chance might come to nothing made him feel
  quite sick. It was such a little service! Why should she remember it? What
  prospect was there that he would ever again come to the threshold of her
  gorgeous chamber, ever again stand close to her as he had stood in the door
  of the chapel? He cast round for a possible patron to advance him, the poor,
  despised foreigner, someone in whose train he might slink again into the
  Queen's presence, someone who would give him an opportunity to remind her by
  an eloquent glance&mdash;no, not of his paltry service, but of the humble
  adoration that he felt for so divine a mistress.</p>

  <p>"It is very cold," grumbled Giuseppe. "I am going to sleep."</p>

  <p>He huddled down in his clothes in the trestle-bed, pulling the thin
  coverlet over him. The brothers were little better lodged than they had been
  when they had first come to Holyrood and M. de Moreta had dismissed them,
  from economy. They had then slept on an old chest in the porter's lodge.</p>

  <p>David shivered too. He began to pray with servile intensity, as was his
  nightly custom, to a little image of wood set up in the corner which he had
  brought from Piedmont and which he took to be his patron saint&mdash;that his
  base fortunes might change. Then, like an answer to his petition, a name
  slipped into his arid mind.</p>

  <p>Lennox&mdash;whose son might marry the Queen&mdash;why not try to take
  service with him? Was there with him a refuge from his present misery? The
  Queen! Maybe she was not so far from him after all.</p>

  <p>The Queen went to Leith, riding on a white horse. She was plainly dressed
  and the soft wind blew in her face. She was restless and had insisted on
  going out, although the weather was drab and chill. The men and woman
  following her whispered among themselves that she had not spoken to Lennox
  for two days and that Lord Darnley had not recently been to the palace. They
  all glanced with added respect at Moray, who rode beside the Queen. There was
  a strong man who would endure no interference in his schemes. How could the
  worn-out, discredited Lennox and that sullen young fool of his, hope to
  displace a man like Moray?</p>

  <p>Under his assured, austere manner, Moray felt his triumph keenly. He
  enjoyed the mild indifference of his half-sister's glance, her soft,
  affectionate words, her manner of appealing to him in everything, of
  deferring to his judgment, his wisdom, his experience.</p>

  <p>Well, he had subdued her pert rebellion against his authority. She had had
  the sense to see how flimsy her own ideas were compared to his grand,
  statesmanlike designs.</p>

  <p>A thin mist blotted out the horizon: the breeze stirred the sea into
  sullen wavelets and there was a dull sense of depression in the air. The sea
  birds, swooping over the slowly heaving water, were livid in their clear
  brightness.</p>

  <p>The Queen sighed and spoke regretfully of the chill season of the year.
  How pleasant it was on Leith Sands when they were able to ride at the ring or
  shoot at the butts! Would the spring never come?</p>

  <p>Moray looked at her with satisfaction. She seemed hardy, simple, almost
  austere in her simple gown and hood, with her pale, serious face. He was
  proud of her and felt master of her destiny and his own. But when she spoke
  next it was to say something that entirely shattered his elegant
  self-assurance.</p>

  <p>"I saw Murray of Tullibardine this morning. He came from Earl Bothwell."
  The Queen spoke ingenuously, stroking the neck of her white horse.</p>

  <p>"And I did not know about it?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed, how was that? But it hardly matters."</p>

  <p>"It was a great insolence for Earl Bothwell to send anyone to see you."
  Moray could say no more for rage. "He begged to be allowed to return to
  Edinburgh," said the Queen.</p>

  <p>"Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"On the Border somewhere&mdash;in hiding. Perhaps at Borthwick."</p>

  <p>"What did you say to him?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I was angry. I said: 'How could such a villain ask such a favour?' I
  said: 'Why did he not stay in France where he was Captain of the Scotch
  Guard?'"</p>

  <p>"You should not have answered him at all, you should have sent him to
  me."</p>

  <p>Moray was deeply angered. The Queen turned her shoulder with a shrug as if
  she cast off indifferently his ill-humour. Out at sea a faint line of light
  broke through the mist; the Queen pulled at her bridle and turned her horse
  towards Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>In a lowered voice meant for her ears only, Moray reviled Bothwell&mdash;a
  man who had been driven out of Scotland. One who should be, by birth, an
  upstanding man, but who was instead a filthy rogue, a lying villain, rotten
  to the very soul.</p>

  <p>"You speak so earnestly," said the Queen, "I might think that you were
  afraid of him."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid of seeing Scotland trampled on by that domineering young
  man."</p>

  <p>"How serious you make it!" laughed the Queen; "I like to have him like a
  bird on a string to let fly or to pull in and cage as I will."</p>

  <p>"A cruel and a dangerous game."</p>

  <p>Moray thought the case was serious. Despite her ingenuous ways and
  indifferent, half-weary smile he suspected her of a hundred duplicities; so
  close to his uneasy affection for her was an unquenchable doubt of her
  integrity. But he endeavoured to make an effort over his great and, he
  thought, most justifiable anger, and to speak to her lightly, as an adult to
  a child, as a wise man to a foolish woman, treating the whole business as a
  caprice, but he warned her that it was a caprice which must not be carried
  any further. She must not hold any communication with Bothwell nor with any
  of his friends, not even with Murray of Tullibardine, who was a respectable
  and well-meaning man. "There are not many such," added Moray with a sneer,
  "that one could count among Bothwell's acquaintances."</p>

  <p>The Queen did not reply to this warning. She rode carelessly beside her
  half-brother, and whether or not she listened, he could not be sure. Before
  them the purple hills round the city rose into a pellucid sky from which the
  mists were blowing away; a plentiful light was overtaking the last of the
  day. Moray, perceiving this transfiguration, felt his spirits rise, his
  strength increase. After all, he could circumvent the Queen and Bothwell and
  the Lennox Stewarts.</p>

  <p>He continued, though in a more good-humoured tone, his rebukes and his
  warnings:</p>

  <p>"Madame, you must consider your position. With the corning of Lord Lennox
  the Hamiltons are deeply offended. Though they are poor there are many of
  them. The little favours that you have shown Lord Lennox and his son, though
  I know they are nothing but courtesies, have set many against you. You
  promised me to have little to do with Papists."</p>

  <p>She twisted his reproaches on to him, saying over her shoulder:</p>

  <p>"Lord Bothwell is a heretic like yourself."</p>

  <p>"Bothwell is beneath my contempt," answered Moray. "Let him keep away from
  Edinburgh, let him remember that he is outlawed, let him take care how he
  makes a league with Huntly, who abetted his father's treason."</p>

  <p>"You fear them?" urged the Queen again,</p>

  <p>Moray shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It is base to fear creatures like that, but I must be careful they do not
  disturb our tranquillity."</p>

  <p>Disregarding everything serious in what he had said, the Queen, slipping
  her reins in and out of her doeskin gauntlets, said lightly:</p>

  <p>"Earl Bothwell may not come to Edinburgh, then? It is a pity&mdash;he has
  excellent manner and graces any company."</p>

  <p>"Madame," said Moray directly, "if Lord Bothwell comes into Scotland I go
  out of it."</p>

  <p>Moray meant this; he believed that without him and Lethington the country
  would go to pieces beyond her management to put together again. He wished he
  could make her understand that it was he and he alone who kept her in her
  place, gave her leisure in which to play her silly tricks, her elegant games.
  Only he, always by her side advising and guiding, represented a strong,
  stable government upon which men looked with some confidence.</p>

  <p>The Queen spoke in a challenging tone.</p>

  <p>"I'll not have Bothwell outlawed! Let him be! He served me honourably and
  I cannot hate him."</p>

  <p>This roused such disdain in Moray that he was ready to accuse her of
  almost any wickedness. He scorned to remind her again what Bothwell's
  character, reputation, and offences were, and rode beside her in a haughty
  silence. He could not conceive how any woman could forget the crime for which
  Earl Bothwell had been cast into Edinburgh Castle. This had been nothing less
  than a scheme to abduct the Queen, murder Moray and those who stood nearest
  the Queen in relationship or confidence. It was true that this plot was not
  as simple as it appeared. Bothwell was a subtle man, he had involved the wild
  Arran in his infernal schemes, thinking to work the Hamilton's ruin by using
  him as a cat's-paw.</p>

  <p>But Arran, frightened, had run squealing to Moray and divulged Bothwell's
  evil plans.</p>

  <p>Moray glanced sideways at his sister as she rode a pace away from him and
  recalled that day when they had been hunting at Falkland and Arran had come
  there gibbering with his half-incoherent tales of Bothwell's treacheries. She
  had not been alarmed. When Bothwell had come, fast on the heels of the
  informer, to clear himself, she had listened to him, sat patiently while he
  had stood before her, justifying himself forcibly in a long speech, blaming
  Arran as an imbecile, blaming everyone who spoke against him; naming them as
  liars and traitors. If she had not been there Moray would have seen to it
  that Bothwell had died as Huntly had died&mdash;a sudden falling from his
  horse as he mounted it, a stab in a scuffle or a brawl. Ah, were he the King
  with full powers, Bothwell should have troubled no one any further! Instead,
  the Queen had listened and smiled and shrugged, said she did not believe
  Arran, she only half-believed Bothwell, and what did it matter, some wild
  tavern talk!</p>

  <p>She put aside this hideous entanglement of murder, rape and treachery
  without investigation, as if it had been a trifling disagreement between
  gentlemen in her antechamber. Bothwell had been placed in Edinburgh Castle,
  certainly, but Moray could not forget nor forgive his quick and easy escape.
  It was too bitterly clear that the Queen had not been offended. She could
  not, indeed, as she had just declared, hate Bothwell.</p>

  <p>Why should she remember. Moray asked himself, those slight services which
  Bothwell had rendered to her mother? Some generalship in Border skirmishes, a
  mission to France to ask for help. Others had done as much and been
  forgotten.</p>

  <p>He told himself, as they rode in the park beneath the bare trees, that he
  must move sharply and cautiously, keep a wary eye on his half-sister. It was
  foolish of him to be lulled by her air of simplicity; it was dull-witted of
  him to indulge in those moments of confidence, when he held her above censure
  and believed that she was simple and innocent.</p>

  <p>He looked at her again with hostile eyes; she seemed to be drooping in the
  saddle though she had not been long on horseback and he had known her to ride
  easily for hours. There was weariness, too, on her brow, and her lips, from
  which the paint had faded in the open air, were pale. She was inscrutable.
  Moray warned himself that he had better not vaunt his fortunes while he had
  this woman to deal with. Sometimes it really was as if she bewitched him with
  her affected airs, her seductive smiles and timid appeals for advice and
  guidance. Perhaps all the time she was deceiving him. At this he felt such a
  jealousy that the whole world suddenly seemed to him disgusting and filthy.
  He had noticed before that when he had a thought that smirched his sister's
  image in his mind the very air became tainted and a slight physical nausea
  tormented him.</p>

  <p>As they rode through the park with the last sudden light behind them she
  said easily:</p>

  <p>"You must do what you will about Earl Bothwell, I am tired of the city. I
  believe that I shall go to Stirling."</p>

  <p>The graceful young Italian cringed before Lennox, who regarded him with
  some suspicion. Since he had come to Edinburgh and had been restored to his
  estates he had interviewed many people who wished to be his servants or to
  join his retinue. But he could afford few of these: his rents and lands had
  been nominally restored to him, but he had yet to set them in order and
  gather together his various incomes. Besides, the future looked dubious. His
  son, whom he named "sullen booby" in his mind, was difficult, and the Queen,
  most elusive and provoking of women, had withdrawn into a silence which might
  mean aversion.</p>

  <p>The Italian had called twice at the house in the Nether-bow before he had
  been admitted into the Earl's presence. On this third occasion he had only
  obtained an audience by chance. But he made the most of the opportunity, and
  his quick, fluent speech, which had only a flavour of foreign accent,
  fascinated the Earl, who stared at him, wondering if here was good, cheap,
  serviceable material.</p>

  <p>He was attracted by this fellow who was so different from himself, who was
  rather like a greyhound, lean and swift, who had such intelligent eyes. His
  talents were such, it seemed, as would grace a princely household: he could
  play the lute, the virginals, and several other instruments; he would be able
  to accompany the young prince, Henry Stewart, when he wished to sing or play.
  He had a quick eye and a deft hand at arranging a cloak, a doublet, a collar,
  or a jewel; he could keep accounts accurately, he could speak French, Latin,
  English, and a little Spanish, he could write a fair Roman hand, endorse a
  deed, draw up a contract. It was astonishing what small, useful arts the
  youth had learnt in his short, hard life, but strange, too, that he had never
  come to be employed honourably before. That, no doubt, was owing to his low
  birth and obscure up-bringing. He had found it difficult to obtain a chance,
  yet, after all, he had not done so badly for himself, having contrived
  somehow to hang on to the train of the Duke of Savoy's Ambassador, and then
  to work his way into the royal chapel of Holyrood.</p>

  <p>The Earl asked him why he wished to leave this decent livelihood within
  the Queen's palace.</p>

  <p>The Italian replied that he was scarcely paid at all, that between the
  Matins and the Masses and the practices he had little time to call his own,
  and who, he added, could compare the honour of being a singer in Holy-rood
  Chapel with that of being in the employ of so great and gracious a prince as
  the Earl of Lennox?</p>

  <p>Lennox hesitated. He did not know if he could afford the man; he was aware
  how expensive and luxurious these foreign servants were. Besides, he did not
  altogether trust him, the fellow seemed too clever. He thought that he
  preferred Englishmen like those wild young Roman Catholics who were already
  in his son's service, who joined him in all his sports and games, the two
  Antony Standens. Then the Italian, who had been keenly watching the other's
  puffy face, saw his chance vanishing and began to exaggerate, even to lie. He
  whispered that he had some secret influence in the palace, that the Queen
  favoured him, that she had employed him sometimes to write her letters
  because he was so good a scholar and wrote so clear a hand, had trusted him,
  even, with some secrets about money lent from the Pope. Oh yes, he had been
  more than a servant, a spy. He knew several cyphers, was within the
  confidence of all the great Papists, he had often sat in the Queen's closet
  quite late at night inditing some of her secret correspondence, and
  afterwards he had played the lute to her, for she was much given to
  melancholy, after she had been tiring herself with political business.</p>

  <p>Lennox listened attentively; the affairs sounded plausible. The Italian
  stressed his point: it was because of his ardour for the Roman Catholic
  religion that he offered his services to Lennox. He insinuated, though he did
  not put it into so many words, that he would be a convenient go-between to
  and from the palace and the Lennox lodgings; he wished very much to attach
  himself to the service of the young prince. Was it not to his advantage and
  that of all Roman Catholics from the Holy Father downwards to see Henry
  Stewart&mdash;He paused, and then added boldly: Was not the Queen to wed
  Henry Stewart?</p>

  <p>Lennox liked the sound of that. Dull and slow but nonetheless ambitious,
  he had always moved in a slightly baffled fashion through the intrigues of
  courts. He understood that one must plot and scheme, if one were to keep a
  foothold among so many rogues, villains, and time-servers. He did not know
  quite how to do this and in Scotland he was treated almost like an alien,
  therefore this subtle, cringing, clever tool would surely be useful. He had
  no spies in Holyrood, having neither the influence nor the money to arrange
  this. Perhaps he had been a fool to spend the seven hundred pounds he had
  brought from England so openly, giving it in presents to giggling women and
  gaping pages instead of using it to employ a crafty, lying instrument like
  this Italian.</p>

  <p>He looked at Rizzio critically. The fellow made quite a striking figure in
  his chestnut-coloured attire with the silver stripes, his long, thick black
  hair falling either side his thin, masculine face.</p>

  <p>"You may wait on my son if you will. Perhaps he can find a use for you in
  his household."</p>

  <p>Unobservant and self-engrossed in his own vanities and troubles, Lennox
  did not notice the radiance which passed over the young Italian's face. He
  fell on one knee and kissed the Earl's podgy hands, then, anxious not to
  tarry now he had obtained his advantage, he departed, after begging
  permission to return on the following morning.</p>

  <p>He turned into the street full of relief and triumph; he had staked a good
  deal on this chance with Lennox. He had been quite penniless when it had
  occurred to him to present himself before the Earl, and as no one either
  liked or trusted him he knew not where to turn to borrow a few pence. Yet it
  had been impossible to present himself before any prospective master in the
  shabby black which was the only garment he possessed, which he was always
  thankful to hide behind the livery that was provided for him when he sang in
  the chapel. In the bandage that Mary Seaton had put round his arm had been a
  gold pin with a white topaz head. He had not wanted to part with that, there
  were so many uses to which he could have put it. He could have kept it, to
  gaze at and gloat over: he could have returned it to the Queen and so made
  the excuse for another interview; he could, with some luck, have perhaps worn
  it in her presence and attracted her attention to it and evoked in her mind
  memories of the service he had rendered her once.</p>

  <p>But he had not thought that any of these chances were as sure as that of
  employment in the Lennox household. So he had reluctantly, for he valued
  highly the gift of the Queen, gone to a jeweller and pawned it for sufficient
  money to buy the chestnut-brown suit with silver lines, a pair of hose and
  shoes and a black cap with a silver chain.</p>

  <p>But he had not been able to afford a cloak, and as he strode down the
  windy street he shivered, hunching his shoulders together to keep himself
  warm and rubbing his hands on his cheeks, which were sallow from the
  cold.</p>

  <p>Lord Darnley condescended to accept the services of the young Italian,
  whom he did not understand in the least, but took to be a very humble, modest
  fellow, eager to be of any service. Henry Stewart, was, in the estimation of
  all members of the true Faith, heir-presumptive to the thrones of Scotland
  and England. Self-absorbed and simple, he suspected no double-dealing on the
  part of the newcomer, whom he thoroughly despised as a foreigner of low
  birth, but found extremely useful for his submissiveness, his talents, and
  his flattery.</p>

  <p>Lord Darnley, like his father, knew nothing of the court except what he
  had been able to observe from the outside.</p>

  <p>David Rizzio knew a great deal. From the little room where he and Giuseppe
  had peered and spied out like mice, he had watched and listened. But he was
  careful to emphasize his lies as to the confidence the Queen had shown him.
  Quickly he sized up the character of the man whom he had decided to serve: he
  was careful to do nothing to provoke the doubts, suspicions, or jealousies of
  this unsophisticated youth, whose ideas were all narrow, conventional, and
  honest. David Rizzio was careful never to do anything to shock or disturb the
  young prince, whose intellect and whose principles he despised.</p>

  <p>But he could not compete with the Antony Standens, the Englishmen already
  installed in his master's favour by the ways of games and sports, chess,
  billiards, fencing, hunting, riding at the ring, shooting at the butts, for
  in these things the Italian had not had any education. Nor could he handle a
  tennis racquet, nor lead a lady through a dance. But he had many other
  accomplishments which he had brought to a fine pitch of perfection and which
  were extremely useful to Henry Stewart&mdash;his elegant letter writing, his
  quick translation of foreign languages, his adroit touch with clothes, his
  knowledge of where and what to buy in Edinburgh, his cleverness in engaging
  servants and keeping an eye on them, his quickness at casting up accounts and
  spending money well, making a good display for a little expenditure. Henry
  Stewart was grateful for all these gifts put at his disposal.</p>

  <p>The Italian had, also, a real gift for music, and music was Henry
  Stewart's one talent. There they met as equals; when they played and sang
  together the young prince forgot his unconscious contempt of the foreigner,
  and the Italian forgot his conscious contempt of his master. They respected,
  and even liked each other on these occasions, some queer affinity rose
  between them, the bass and tenor voice blended well together, they kept
  exquisite time on their musical instruments&mdash;the lute, the zithers, and
  the virginals. Quite seriously, forgetting their common disdain, their mutual
  scorns and differences, the tall blond prince and the lean swarthy servant
  would sit together in genuine amity playing over some new piece from Italy
  which relaxed Henry Stewart's mind, so troubled by his father's feverish
  ambitions and stirred David Rizzio's fancy into a whirling fantasy of all the
  possibilities of his high promotion.</p>

  <p>Lord Moray was satisfied. Bothwell's emissary, Murray of Tullibardine, had
  withdrawn from Edinburgh with a sharp rebuke. Bothwell had been ordered to
  leave the Border or to appear in Eidnburgh and answer to the charges against
  him. Moray smiled, feeling sure that no one, even of Bothwell's insolent
  boldness, would dare to accept this challenge. But he gathered round him in
  the capital and the palace armed companies of his own followers.</p>

  <p>The Queen was complaisant; she let Murray of Tullibardine go as she had
  let him come, with no comment. She did nothing to rouse Moray's suspicion;
  she was courteous to Lennox and his son, but no more. She seemed to listen
  willingly to Thomas Randolph, Elizabeth's Ambassador, who continued to press
  the suit of the Earl of Leicester, "that impossible marriage."</p>

  <p>The Queen played with the idea, saying that after all if the Earl was a
  proper man and he had pleased Elizabeth Tudor, he might please her. Also, she
  would do anything for peace and future union between the two countries, and
  if Elizabeth should choose her as her heir, she might also find her a
  husband.</p>

  <p>Moray took this as mockery and watched his sister carefully. Why would she
  go to Stirling? She did not trouble to explain herself. She said he could
  guess her reasons, and when he asked her if it was the stench and crowd of
  the city, the tolling of the death-bell for those dead of the pox or the
  plague, the tumult of the executions by torchlight, she shrugged and was
  silent.</p>

  <p>He questioned his sister, Lady Argyll, who seemed as much in the Queen's
  confidence as any woman. The anxious lady, though a loyal Protestant, could
  give him no news to ease his mind. The Queen disclosed herself to none; even
  in her privacy she was light, careless, smiling, sunk in a gentle melancholy,
  a soft brooding.</p>

  <p>Did she love Darnley? Moray queried anxiously.</p>

  <p>Lady Argyll did not know. The Queen had praised him, but she was ready to
  praise any proper man&mdash;and Lord Darnley was handsome enough to make any
  woman stare.</p>

  <p>Moray brushed that aside impatiently. That his difficult policies should
  be hampered by these feminine caprices!</p>

  <p>"Will she marry a man for his fair face and wide shoulders?" he asked
  bitterly.</p>

  <p>Lady Argyll did not know. She replied with a smile:</p>

  <p>"Women have wedded for slighter and worse reasons."</p>

  <p>If the Queen did not love Darnley, did she love anybody? Moray's anxiety
  showed in his frown, in the drooping lines of his mouth. He viewed with deep
  apprehension the journey to Stirling. Lennox and his son were going there,
  too. Did she want to escape from him, Moray, and his diligent eye, from his
  stern glance and tongue? Did she wish to continue her love-making in that
  remote fastness? He would not believe in such hypocrisy.</p>

  <p>He consulted Sir William Maitland who, patient and amused, watched
  everything. He thought the Queen was deceiving her brother and laughing at
  him; at the same time he did not think she intended marrying the Lennox boy.
  He kept his own counsel on this matter and reassured Moray.</p>

  <p>"Let her go to Stirling. What good will you achieve by tormenting her,
  restraining her liberty and her pleasures? The country is your business,
  you've enough to do there."</p>

  <p>"Ay, enough," assented Moray grimly. "But with the Queen's Majesty lies
  all. I must watch how she behaves, which way she turns, whom she
  likes&mdash;" He stopped suddenly. "That young Italian, now! Why is he
  suddenly in the Lennox service?"</p>

  <p>Maitland replied lightly:</p>

  <p>"He is a clever rogue who knows how to twist and turn to his own
  advantage."</p>

  <p>Moray frowned.</p>

  <p>"He has become intimate with Lord Darnley. They are always together; he is
  more with him now than those English gentlemen he brought from London. He
  takes him with him to the palace, to the presence of the Queen. I have had
  him watched. He spends money, too. I have learnt that when he came here he
  had not a cloak to his name and slept on a bare chest in the porter's
  lodge."</p>

  <p>"What's in this to do with us?" asked Maitland. "This is a cunning rogue
  who will make his way, and Lennox and his son are easily gulled, no doubt, by
  flattery."</p>

  <p>"I do not like such men," said Moray, "to be close to the ear of princes.
  I think it's dangerous to see a villain close to a fool. This is a Papist, a
  greedy mountebank with no spark of honour. In a few weeks he begins to behave
  almost as if he were a gentleman."</p>

  <p>"He is not in your service nor in mine," replied Maitland, "why should you
  think him dangerous? Let him cheat those who pamper him."</p>

  <p>"But Darnley takes him to the presence of the Queen," fretted Moray. "It
  is like a bloated spider&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Maitland's brows went up, and he compressed his lips. Here, he thought,
  comes the core of a matter which must never be glanced upon. Perhaps I also
  have my jealousies, but I control them with more dexterity.</p>

  <p>He laid his shapely hand on Moray's dark shoulder, and in a tone of
  comfort he said:</p>

  <p>"Let the wretch be. If he becomes insolent, he'll not last very long."</p>

  <p>At Stirling the Queen felt indeed comfortable. She felt soothed and
  protected by the heavy walls of the huge, remote castle. Here she was free of
  all the miseries, the agitations of Holyrood and the capital, here there were
  no spies to peer and glance, no foreign envoys to flatter and fence with, no
  Thomas Randolph to force on her another Queen's discarded lover, no Moray to
  frown, rebuke, and warn. There were no Calvinist Puritans to insult her,
  naming her Holy Church "harlot" to her face. She was free of the stinking
  streets, the clanging bells of the desecrated churches, the brawls and
  quarrels that echoed in her very palace, the lewd crimes and the bloody
  punishments.</p>

  <p>A faint, almost imperceptible spring tide was breaking even on this
  northern land. In France the first blossoms would be out and she would be
  sending her maids to gather violets to lay between the folds of her clothes
  ...</p>

  <p>They set up the magnificent bed she took with her from palace to palace.
  It had been given her by her mother, Mary of Guise, and was of violet-brown
  satin lined with crimson, heavily garnished with gold and silver. She
  cherished it, not only because of its superb splendour but because of her
  mother, whom she had loved most tenderly. Her heart would tighten when she
  thought of that heroic woman, the one creature who had loyally and devotedly
  served her interests, protected her rights, to the very end fought and
  schemed and struggled for her that she might preserve the Crown, which had
  come to her when her father died of a broken heart soon after her birth.</p>

  <p>"Oh, mother, mother!" said the young Queen, as she sat down on the bedstep
  and rested her head on the splendid coverlet.</p>

  <p>She remembered her mother's visit to France, how gay and joyful they had
  all been, she and her playmates, Claude, Elizabeth, Marguerite, the little
  boys, Henri and Francois. How light and easy all had seemed then! It was only
  a few years ago that everything had changed. She remembered the sunny rivers,
  the bright, open fields, the gay palaces of France, and she felt exiled from
  her heart's desire. Yet to live here was to be a queen and that was much.
  Yes, that was better than a paltry lodging or the chatter of amusing company
  ...She checked her thoughts. She had not come to Stirling to brood, but to be
  free. She deluded herself with that word, the hallucination of the restless,
  the ambitious and the proud. Free! She was lonely in a solitude. She was
  riven by nostalgia, by yearnings, by she knew not what desires.</p>

  <p>"Oh, mother, mother!" She rested her smooth cheeks again on the coverlet.
  She was tired from the long ride, she wished she had not come. The place was
  gloomy, hostile, surely.</p>

  <p>She called Mary Seaton who was always near, always anxious to serve and to
  obey.</p>

  <p>"Undress me, put me to bed!"</p>

  <p>"Madame, it is scarcely dark."</p>

  <p>"What is expected of me?" asked the Queen wearily. She began to pull off
  her ruff, to unknot her bodice; her gloves lay already on the floor at her
  feet.</p>

  <p>"Madame, Lord Darnley wishes to speak with you. He stopped me just now and
  seemed in a kind of passion, which I think is uncommon in him. He has few
  words, I know."</p>

  <p>"Why should he find words to-night?" asked the</p>

  <p>Queen, without pausing in taking off her heavy riding-habit.</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell. I suppose he thinks he has waited so long&mdash;those
  weeks in Edinburgh. At first you were so kind to him, afterwards, I suppose,
  he was disappointed. He gave me a letter."</p>

  <p>"A letter!" The Queen snatched lightly at the folded paper that Mary
  Seaton held out. "How long since I have had a love-letter, Mary, or one that
  I have read?" The pale girl was silent, shaking her head; she did not seem to
  like the subject. She turned aside to attend to the fire; though it had been
  lit some time ago, smoke still lingered in the chamber and the logs did not
  burn steadily.</p>

  <p>The Queen opened and read the letter with curiosity. It satisfied her very
  particular tastes; it might have been written by a pupil of Ronsard. It
  contained those gilded and voluptuous compliments to which she had been used
  at the Court of France. It was exquisitely written on a piece of rubbed
  parchment tied with yellow and scarlet silk, it wooed her with delicate,
  amorous reproaches, it revealed passion and tenderness and loyalty.</p>

  <p>She folded it up thoughtfully. So, the golden youth could write like that.
  If he knew French, that language so dear to her, why had he not spoken it
  before and made his wooing quicker?</p>

  <p>Mary Seaton came to her side and stood, frowning anxiously, peering down
  at the closely written paper. "Has he any merits? I thought him much
  moved."</p>

  <p>"That might be his pride," murmured the Queen, folding up the letter. "I
  have humbled him with this waiting."</p>

  <p>"I think if you could love him, madame&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, love him!" said the Queen impatiently. "How we twist and turn that
  word, Mary! I would not dislike him nor neglect him, and yet, should I think
  of who I am? How much do you think he cares for me, Mary?"</p>

  <p>She unfastened the heavy riding-skirt and let it fall to her feet.</p>

  <p>"You remember the young Italian who used to sing in the chapel,
  madame?"</p>

  <p>"David Rizzio? Yes. I have seen him often enough lately."</p>

  <p>"Well, he has spoken to me," said Mary Seaton earnestly, "and more than
  once."</p>

  <p>"Take care of him, Mary, he may be in someone's pay."</p>

  <p>"No, I do not think so."</p>

  <p>"But why," mused the Queen, "did he leave my service, where he had a
  chance of promotion, to go into that of Lord Lennox?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know, madame. It is rumoured that he had a reason, but he will
  not tell it to me. I think he loves Lord Darnley. He serves him very
  faithfully."</p>

  <p>"These common people are like hounds," smiled the Queen, "they'll lick
  shoes and take a beating. Well, what of your Rizzio?"</p>

  <p>"He seems to me very humble and courteous, madame, and I take him to be a
  man of some breeding whom misfortune brought to servitude."</p>

  <p>"Never mind his breeding," said the Queen, moving in her petticoat to the
  glow of the fire, "what did the fellow say, how did he interest you, Mary,
  what does it mean to me?"</p>

  <p>She sank into the large chair on the hearth and leant forward into the
  pleasant circle of warmth, hugging her smooth, white arms with her cold
  finger-tips.</p>

  <p>Mary Seaton related what David Rizzio had told her of his new master. It
  all went to prove the passion, the infatuation of Lord Darnley for the Queen.
  Of course, he had not been so stupid and vulgar as to talk openly before the
  Italian, but by a thousand signs, broken words, glances, sighs, staring at
  portraits, scribbling of notes, impatient ejaculations and sleepless tossings
  at night, Rizzio had understood Lord Darnley's case.</p>

  <p>Darnley, who hitherto had been quite untouched by any feeling for any
  woman, was snatched up in such a high devotion to the Queen that he dare not
  breathe a word of it for fear of appearing ambitious, or coarse. It was only,
  at last, in despair at her long withdrawal from his company and encouraged by
  the solitude of Stirling, that he had ventured to write the letter.</p>

  <p>The Queen felt a great sense of release and relief. If this was to be the
  solution after all! If he loved her like that, might he not sweep all her
  enemies before him and make her his queen, as she had dared to dream when she
  had first met him? Well, there was now no need for her to hold him at
  arm's-length; she might encourage him, she might see what would happen if she
  allowed him a certain licence. There was no need to be cautious and ashamed
  with this man as she might have had to be cautious and ashamed with others,
  afraid of spies, of secrets coming to light, of little whispers and rumours
  creeping out.</p>

  <p>She rose and shook her head so that the thick chestnut hair, slipped from
  the pins to her waist.</p>

  <p>"He is a prince," she reminded herself, although she spoke to Mary Seaton.
  "He has the right&mdash;the right!"</p>

  <p>The Queen dined privately in Stirling that night. Despite her fatigue she
  had not gone to bed, after all. She had put aside her mourning, the black,
  disfiguring clothes in which she had ridden to Stirling, and wore a little
  dress of green silk, which had been made for her when she was Dauphine of
  France. It was cut low and square on the bosom and had a high stiffened
  collar hung with huge pearls shaped like flower-bells that tinkled whenever
  she moved her head.</p>

  <p>She had asked Lord Darnley to come to this little supper; she was attended
  only by Mary Seaton and Mary Fleming. It was the first favour she had shown
  him for a long time, and she looked at him kindly as if there was some
  secret, subtle understanding between them. She had his letter in her breast,
  over the blood-red ring she always wore. She touched it with light mockery,
  wondering if he would understand the gesture.</p>

  <p>He had little to say, but when he looked at her steadily across the table,
  she felt a thrill of delicious terror, such as she had not known for a long
  while.</p>

  <p>In his simple clothes, his natural grace was very apparent. He seemed to
  put aside most of his awkward clumsiness with his court finery.</p>

  <p>As she drank to him out of the gold goblet she always carried with her for
  her own use, she leant towards him, and the huge pearls tinkled on her
  stiffened ruff. She gave him, across the candles and the crystal and the
  silver gilt, an unspoken message.</p>

  <p>When the board was cleared and the cloth was removed, everyone was for
  music, being too tired for billiards or chess. A tall crystal jug with a
  silver lip, filled with white wine, remained on the table, and as this was
  emptied the French servants filled it again. Mary drank slowly, deliberately,
  willing herself to be bemused, slightly intoxicated, so that all appeared to
  her radiant and beautiful, so that she could forget Edinburgh and Holyrood
  and all that was distasteful in the city, and only believe in this elegance
  that was around her, the two kind, faithful women and the handsome young man
  who looked at her with his candid eyes inflamed with passion.</p>

  <p>She watched the blue and green jewels, sapphire and emerald, rise and fall
  on his broad chest. He said in a muffled, husky voice that, after all, he
  could neither play nor sing, but he begged that David Rizzio might come in to
  entertain the company.</p>

  <p>The Queen, drinking carefully, nodded. She sat in the window-place, where
  the closet was so small that the fire had warmed every part of it.</p>

  <p>Rizzio was summoned. He came at once, neither too servile nor too forward.
  He did not wear, as he had worn a few weeks ago, the Lennox liveries, but a
  plain, dark habit that did not clash with nor yet shame his master's
  magnificence. His smooth dark hair, long and heavy, was curled at the ends on
  his shoulders. He carried a gleaming lute inlaid with an intricate pattern,
  presenting himself humbly towards his master, paying him, cunningly, more
  deference than he showed to the Queen, to whom he bowed, but remotely, as if
  she was a grandeur beyond his sphere.</p>

  <p>The two young girls sat on the cushions before the fire, and played with
  the rings on their fingers and the jewels at their neck. Each thought of her
  own affairs.</p>

  <p>Mary Fleming mused on the widower. Sir William Maitland, she was so soon
  to marry and of whom she knew so very little. She admired him as a clever,
  masterful man, subtle and successful, but she wondered what life would be
  like with one who knew so much, who had been married before, and must find
  her, whatever pains she might take, foolish and ignorant.</p>

  <p>Mary Seaton thought of her lover in the grave. She had vowed herself to
  chastity, her intention being to enter a convent, but she had met a man whom
  she wished to marry and he had gone to Rome to obtain a dispensation from the
  Pope. On the way back, crossing France, he had caught the plague and died.
  Mary Seaton was now twice pledged to virginity, once because of the Church,
  once because of this dead lover. She felt sad but serene, and at
  peace&mdash;the will of God was so manifest.</p>

  <p>When her mistress married, and she hoped that would be soon, she would
  retire into a convent, away from all the horrid sights and cruelties and rage
  and lusts of the world which agitated her so much.</p>

  <p>To these four people David Rizzio played and sang, choosing impersonal
  music and verses in a foreign tongue.</p>

  <p>The Queen sipped her wine, the young man stared from her to the singer
  tensely, with a questioning look. The Queen did nothing to encourage or repel
  him. She did not wish to meddle with destiny, she wished to be borne on
  despite her own volition to some pre-ordained fortune.</p>

  <p>David Rizzio sang and played, serving their moods, bringing them to the
  point where they wished to be, effacing his own personality, effacing even
  his own thoughts, lest the sense of them might disturb the harmony. Neutral,
  therefore, with a blank mind, he played. Once the Queen's drowsy eyes turned
  in his direction and she saw in the plain white collar at his throat a little
  gold pin with a white topaz head, and the slightest smile touched her
  mouth.</p>

  <p>He had never traded on that little service he had done her when he had
  captured Florestan, the monkey, in the chapel. She admired him for keeping
  the pin, instead of ostentatiously bringing himself to her notice by
  returning it to her.</p>

  <p>She looked at his sensitive profile bent over the gleaming instrument. A
  servant, basely-born, but there was nothing petty, nor ignoble in his
  appearance. She remembered lazily what Mary Seaton had said: "Well-bred and
  fallen in his estate." What did it matter? She sighed away even a hint of a
  thought of this; she was glad now that she had left Edinburgh for this
  retreat. Here she had really escaped much that was so unprofitable and
  troublesome to her. How had she endured this so long? Only perhaps because
  Moray, that powerful man, had flattered her by loving her against his wish.
  Yes, she knew that&mdash;the power she had over him and his resentment of it.
  And Maitland, too, who was going to marry the girl brooding by the fire, he
  also loved her, the Queen. But to torment these two had been, after all,
  merely a silly diversion. How could she have endured this so long?</p>

  <p>Well, she was free of it now. In the warm atmosphere, with the music in
  her ears, the wine on her lips and in her throat, the young man staring at
  her, worshipping her, she felt lifted immeasurably high above the black,
  broken, incomprehensible world that she had been called upon to rule.</p>

  <p>David Rizzio, who had appeared to have seen and heard nothing, who had
  played like an automaton, suppressing his personality, followed his master
  out of the Queen's closet. The winds had blown out the lamps in the corridor,
  there were few servants in the castle, and they stood in semi-darkness with
  only the light from the moon coming fitfully from a high-set window.</p>

  <p>The young man leaned against the wall and the servant paused behind him,
  holding the lute.</p>

  <p>"Sir, where do you sleep to-night?" asked the Italian. As his master did
  not reply, he added in a low, insinuating voice: "She had your letter in her
  bosom, I saw a corner of it. She meant you to see it. Why do you not take
  your chance, sir, as every man must, or be left behind?"</p>

  <p>With a contemptuous fury, Lord Darnley told his servant to be silent for
  "a chattering spy, a wretch of infamous thoughts."</p>

  <p>The young Italian, not in the least affected by this abuse, spoke again,
  this time whispering, urgent, advising. Darnley, who was slightly drunk,
  leaned down towards his servant, then, when the Italian came to a pause, his
  master struck him over the face, carelessly, as if he knocked an importunate
  dog out of the way. But David Rizzio scarcely winced; he took his master's
  arm and guided him along the corridor and up a staircase, down a secret
  passage, through all the places that he had noted carefully himself on his
  first arrival at Stirling, guided him exactly where he wished him to go.</p>

  <p>The Queen sat alone in her bedchamber, erect in the great bed that had
  belonged to Mary of Guise.</p>

  <p>She had sent away Mary Seaton and Mary Fleming and the French girls. Since
  she had been a widow she had always slept alone. When they had left her she
  had got out of bed and drawn the heavy curtains away from the window so that
  she could see the setting moon and the scudding clouds. An elusive, slanting
  light fell on the figure of the woman sitting up in bed, peaceful and
  expectant.</p>

  <p>She was inspired by the wine, the music of David Rizzio, the glances of
  Henry Darnley, by her own dreams, visions, and desires.</p>

  <p>Why had she not thought of this before&mdash;to escape from all of them,
  get away into a world of her own creating! If they would only leave her alone
  she had power to make everything beautiful and acceptable. Yes, if they would
  not interfere with her she could manage everything.</p>

  <p>She felt so free and happy away from the shackles of the court, the glance
  of Moray's watchful eyes between the swollen lids, away from Maitland's fine
  spying and subtle traps.</p>

  <p>She understood them so well, those two. They wanted her with a concealed
  passion, a possessive emotion that had neither heat nor light. But she was
  not for them.</p>

  <p>The heavy door creaked, then opened. She lay still, waiting.</p>

  <p>From out of the shadows the figure of a man moved, slow, hesitant, as if
  he followed some invisible guide. The door closed behind him and the Queen
  wondered that there was enough wind to move the heavy wood. The night was
  very still. The intruder, who seemed so timid and reluctant, as if he had
  really mistaken his way, was tall and heavy. The Queen knew him at once. He
  came to the bedstep, raised the curtain and looked at her in the veiled
  moonlight.</p>

  <p>She wondered what he could see of her; she must be a mere glimmer. He did
  not speak, but merely stood gazing. She recalled all that he had said in his
  letter ...he was, then, lunatic with love, like a man ought to be.</p>

  <p>She spoke to him in French, a murmured string of endearments. He did not
  answer. She felt melted by tenderness, by affection, by a feeling that was
  surely spiritual. She gave a sigh of deep content as she saw the future in a
  rushing vision, herself wedded to masculine strength and resolution, facing
  her enemies, driving them here, there, before her just contempt. This
  prospect of revenge for every past slight and humiliation was sweet to her;
  it made her feel humble and grateful towards the man who would enable her to
  indulge her vindictiveness.</p>

  <p>He went on his knees on the bedstep and clutched the thick curtains so
  that the rings slid on the rods. Over his shoulder she could see the receding
  gleam of the fire. He began to ask her pardon, speaking English and in the
  tone of one who had no hope of mercy. It sounded as if he kept back
  tears.</p>

  <p>She listened, amused and touched. How young and simple he was! She could
  not understand all his rapid, jerky words. She put out her hands and slipped
  her fingers under his hot cheeks, pressed on the coverlet. Yes, they were wet
  with tears. How was it that he had had the courage to come? Fondling his hair
  she asked him that, drawing herself along the sheets so that she whispered in
  his ear.</p>

  <p>His voice came muffled, abashed.</p>

  <p>"It was to ask you if you played with me. I don't know what to
  believe&mdash;I feel so lonely. The lies and the tricks&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I too, detest them! Forget them!"</p>

  <p>"I feel so stupid. I understand so little of it. If you would tell
  me&mdash;Is this truth at last?"</p>

  <p>He raised his head, peering. It was as if he offered her his soul. He was
  ready to do what she told him; he implored her not to baffle him, not to
  deceive his stupidity. She passed by his offer, she took no heed of his
  appeal, her violent fantasy for him made his virtue, his distress charming
  but foolish.</p>

  <p>She told him to rise, to sit on the bed. He obeyed, stiffly, like an
  automaton. He began to stammer; she put her fingers over his mouth. She felt
  an indomitable will to live, to rule, to triumph, and as if the power to do
  this lay safely in her own small body, as if she needed neither help nor
  compassion, but only to unite herself to this pure, masculine strength, this
  profound devotion.</p>

  <p>"You and I together ought to be invincible," she whispered.</p>

  <p>He did not understand what she meant; her unseen beauties, only to be
  glimpsed in the tantalizing web of light and shade, filled him with a sense
  of life-giving power. Her choice of him exalted him in his own estimation. He
  too felt free, of doubts, mistrusts, suspicions, weaknesses.</p>

  <p>Neither knew that the deceits of night, the false fires of passions and
  tainting appetites overwhelmed them. He entered the great bed and took her to
  his heart like a god leaning from a cloud to snatch an earthly, but a
  dazzling flower.</p>

  <p>Moray felt as reassured and satisfied as if he were Regent, or almost King
  of Scotland. His spies had had nothing disturbing to report to him from
  Stirling. The spring weather had suddenly become overcast and gloomy and the
  Queen kept mostly to her chamber, complaining of her old trouble, pain in her
  side. Moray felt firmly in his place, no one would ever dare call themselves
  his master. The only man who had the capacity to do so, William Maitland, was
  very willingly his lieutenant.</p>

  <p>His possessive affection for the Queen was stilled. If she would not have
  Darnley and the affair with Leicester hung in abeyance, what had he to fear?
  Negotiations with foreign princes might continue endlessly. Meanwhile he
  could build up a strong, free, proud kingdom.</p>

  <p>Scotland was miserably poor in money, goods, natural resources. But she
  was rich in the material that Moray most loved to handle&mdash;strong,
  resolute, hardy men, robust, pious women, people who could work, adventure,
  and suffer. The conversion of Scotland to the Reformed Faith seemed to Lord
  Moray nothing less than a miracle. He regarded with reverence the rugged
  peoples of this rocky, remote country who had so earnestly embraced the truth
  and cast behind them error. He believed, with all the strength of a stubborn
  nature, in the principles of the Reformation. He thought that darkness and
  deceit had been driven out with the ousting of Pope, monk, and friar, with
  all the false pomp and pageantry with which Rome marked pernicious
  doctrines.</p>

  <p>Here Moray, who in so much was double and crafty, was sincere. He believed
  in John Calvin, in John Knox, and in what they taught. It was true that his
  convictions marched with his advantages, but he would have become a
  Protestant even if this had meant poverty and lack of power; dearly as he
  loved money and authority he would not have purchased them by remaining a
  Roman Catholic.</p>

  <p>He thought of the time when he had been a priest as a period of miserable
  torment and misguided sin. He rejoiced in the ruined temples of Papistry, the
  broken walls of the convents, in the blackened foundations of the monasteries
  that defaced the land from west to east, from north to south. He had stood
  over the Queen while she, with tears in her eyes, with lips that she could
  scarcely keep steady even by biting them, had signed the Act which drove
  forth monks and priests as idolaters and adulterers from the land. He had,
  with contemptuous chivalry, protected her in the celebration of her own Mass,
  the only Mass heard now in Scotland. He had allowed her her chapel and her
  singing boys and her priests and her vestments, but only out of compassion
  for her weakness and childishness as one might allow a child its toys to keep
  it from crying.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the time might come and even be not far distant when he would not
  permit the Mass even in Holyrood. He might choose to marry the Queen to a
  Protestant. There had been moments, he thought, when she had wavered in
  allegiance to the Faith in which the proud House of Guise had brought her up
  so strictly.</p>

  <p>He had forced on her his ideals of government, his friends and his
  alliances, he had swayed her councils to break with France and lean to
  England. He had made her crush her co-religionists, the Clan of Gordon; he
  had brought pressure on her to send away her French servants, he had lessened
  her train of balladists, her masking girls and lute-playing boys. In every
  direction since he came to Scotland he had bent her to his will. There had
  been dangers, he had had to be alert and prompt, and these had been
  surmounted. Bothwell, so imperious and implacable, dared come no further than
  the Border where he slunk in secrecy, in helpless defiance. Huntly, too, heir
  of the disaster of Corrichie, was a broken man. No doubt, there were others
  of the Lords of the Congregation who murmured against Moray, but he was able
  to deal with them and on the whole they suffered him and liked his
  leadership.</p>

  <p>He knew them all, their characters, their lusts, their greed, their
  wishes, their estates. Here and there, judiciously as occasion arose, he
  bribed or threatened, menaced or soothed. He had his agents everywhere-, he
  did not economize in his system of spies and secret intelligencers, who
  searched in the most uncommon places for information to take to their master.
  He relied on his great wealth, he was gorged with lands and revenues and
  spent very little.</p>

  <p>John Knox was his friend, and John Knox swayed the people. Morton was his
  friend and Morton was a stout prop of the godly, one whom, despite his black
  reputation, was regarded as an upright patriot and a sound statesman.
  Maitland was his friend, and Maitland was clever enough for any sinister lie
  or devilment that any man might put his hand to in the interest of
  business.</p>

  <p>Moray stretched himself like one taking his ease after long tension. The
  prospect was fair, the prospect was good. There was sincerity behind the
  smile with which he informed Mr. Thomas Randolph, Elizabeth's envoy, that
  there could be no question of a match between the Queen's Grace and Lord
  Darnley.</p>

  <p>The people, who saw the danger of a Papist king pass by, the Hamiltons,
  who breathed again after this swift menace of a Lennox domination, looked
  gratefully towards Moray.</p>

  <p>It was Maitland who said to the King's bastard, from no other motive,
  Moray thought, than a desire to disturb any man's satisfaction and twist
  anything simple to something difficult:</p>

  <p>"What does she do so long at Stirling? Lie abed and dream or listen to
  Mary Seaton at her prayers?"</p>

  <p>"Am I to be for ever checking a child at its play? Let her be."</p>

  <p>"Do you think that because she is quiet, she is harmless?" asked Maitland
  with stinging bitterness.</p>

  <p>"I have no need," smiled Moray, "to torture myself with vain surmises. I
  have those who watch for me in Stirling."</p>

  <p>"Do they report nothing?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. Lord Darnley and his wild young Papists ride about and fly hawks
  and try hounds they brought from England. The Queen keeps to her room. In two
  days' time Lord Darnley goes to his father's castle in Glasgow. Perhaps they
  will never meet again, save in company."</p>

  <p>Maitland, playing with the sharp tags that fastened the laces at his
  wrist, asked suddenly:</p>

  <p>"The Italian is in young Darnley's train. Have your spies told you
  that?"</p>

  <p>"They have mentioned him," replied Moray, unruffled. "There is no matter
  for conjecture there. I think young Darnley is like his father&mdash;idle,
  lazy with tongue and pen, not content unless he is in the saddle and the
  fresh air. This foreigner writes for him, keeps his accounts, mends his
  lute-strings, ties his laces. What more is there to say, what, at all, is
  there to wonder at?"</p>

  <p>"I have puzzled at it," said Maitland. "It is a very swift promotion for a
  base Italian to get so high in so short a space and in a great household,
  too."</p>

  <p>But Moray, with a gesture that reminded Maitland of the Queen in her
  impatient moods, shrugged, half-turning his shoulder, and would have no more
  of the subject.</p>

  <p>"When does she return to Edinburgh?"</p>

  <p>Moray, in his settled triumph, replied:</p>

  <p>"When I send for her. I think it is well to leave her where she is a
  little longer."</p>

  <p>"You like," said Maitland, "to think of her as safe, far from the
  temptations and toils of the court, a jewel locked in the casket of which you
  have the key, restrained from harm. Well, I see your mind and think it too
  strange for belief."</p>

  <p>Moray challenged him with a look and Maitland insisted:</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think it strange, Lord Moray, that one so acute as you, should
  soothe your fears with syrup."</p>

  <p>These words, spoken by one whose intellect and discernment he much
  respected, might have started a tempestuous debating in Moray's mind, but he
  quelled his own fears. Maitland was too quick, too subtle, he often saw a
  tanglement where all was straight. Moray would be wise, he would be
  circumspect, he would, as ever, be watchful, but he was sure that there was
  no occasion for apprehension. The Queen was safe in Stirling.</p>

  <p>Two days later his sense of security, of triumph, dissolved like mists
  before a sudden sun. The Queen, without waiting for his command or
  suggestion, returned to Holyrood. Lord Darnley had not gone to
  Glasgow&mdash;he rode through Edinburgh by her side.</p>

  <p>Moray was at the palace to meet them and, as the young man came up the
  narrow staircase, the Queen's half-brother saw on the golden boy's fair right
  hand the blood-red ring, circling, like a wound, his little finger.</p>

  <p>Lord Darnley went to his father's lodgings in Edinburgh where the old man
  fumed and waited.</p>

  <p>April rain danced on the greenish glass of the window while Lennox, in a
  red fur coat, bent over a fluttering fire.</p>

  <p>"You have left me without news," he said sullenly. "Were you so occupied I
  might not have had a letter?"</p>

  <p>"I wrote twice," replied the young man briefly. "Bah! By the hand of that
  Italian, and your mother was always proud of your scholarship. I wish she had
  had you taught fewer dainty tricks and more respect and manly virtues."</p>

  <p>The young man smiled acidly at this meaningless rebuke. He stood by the
  window and unbuttoned the high collar of his riding-coat. Lennox saw at once
  that it was of purple velvet lined with sable.</p>

  <p>"Where did you get that?" he demanded, pointing at the gaudy finery. "More
  debts. You know I am burdened enough already."</p>

  <p>"It was a gift from the Queen," said the young man, over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>Lennox stared, eyes bulging, lips loose, avid interest in his puffy
  face.</p>

  <p>"The Queen! She gave you presents! How did you spend your time at
  Stirling?"</p>

  <p>Lord Darnley opened his lips and was about to speak, but was silent. He
  was troubled how to put what he had to say into words. He was indeed
  indifferent to his father; he would have had the old man miles away with his
  mother in England. He was free of him; he was a man now, settled in his
  estate: he did not want to be questioned, forced to answer, make evasions.
  Well, better come to the truth at last. He looked down at the small, red ring
  on his finger and reassured himself that what he was about to say was the
  truth.</p>

  <p>"I am married to the Queen."</p>

  <p>The highest hopes of Lennox had not expected this. He was quite
  overwhelmed, and stammered.</p>

  <p>Darnley stopped him.</p>

  <p>"You must be silent, sir, or it may be dangerous. We are still in her
  hands, I don't know what she may do. Moray will be against us, and all the
  others I expect."</p>

  <p>"What will that matter if you are King."</p>

  <p>"King! I did not say that! I said I was married to the Queen. It was
  secret&mdash;the ceremony was in her chamber."</p>

  <p>"Well, that should be good enough," said Lennox eagerly. "A ceremony,
  there was a priest and witnesses?" The young man looked away, tossed his head
  and flushed. "There was a ceremony, and before witnesses," he replied
  obstinately. "She holds it lawful and that's enough. We shall be married
  again, and publicly, with full rites. She is waiting her chance."</p>

  <p>"She! The Queen! That's how you speak of her!" Lennox sat staring into the
  fluttering flame. "Well, well! I suppose I'm to know nothing about it. It was
  sudden and might have been managed better. Yet, I don't know, I suppose you
  have her firmly. Wedded and bedded, eh?"</p>

  <p>Darnley did not reply. His father looked at him, laughed coarsely and
  shrugged.</p>

  <p>"I hardly thought&mdash;" he began, then laughed again, his lips trembling
  in the midst of the fat, wrinkled cheeks. Darnley said impatiently:</p>

  <p>"Say no more about it until I give you leave. I have given you the secret,
  let that be sufficient."</p>

  <p>"Ha! the King so soon!" grinned Lennox, not without bitterness. "Remember,
  Harry, I too am a pretender to the Crown. Well, what will she give us? I want
  the Lieutenancy of the Marches, of the Border. You should have a revenue,
  too, to enable you to live in royal state. Am I to run in debt," he added,
  with awkward humour, "to help keep the King?"</p>

  <p>"No king as yet, I do assure you, sir, though she has promised me the
  Crown Matrimonial."</p>

  <p>"So soon, so amorous. Well, you have spent your time profitably. Wedded
  and bedded&mdash;so lusty, so impatient!"</p>

  <p>He sat gaping at the tall young man; he was scarcely able to credit this
  sudden flick of fortune's wheel. He had had his hopes and his fears, doubts
  this way and that, but he had scarcely ever pictured the possibility that his
  son might marry the Queen within six weeks of first catching sight of her.
  And so secret, too! He began to laugh with real pleasure as he thought of the
  Hamiltons and Moray, slapped his knees as he contemplated their fury.
  Maitland, too. He would slink away through the city like a snake.</p>

  <p>He looked at his son, who stood sullen and ill-at-ease by the window
  watching the sliding drops melting one into the other.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, trying to speak like a man of the world, "you must see
  this is no false step on her part, that she is not indulging a whim. You must
  go quietly, Harry, for a while, at least. But press your advantage, boy."</p>

  <p>He stopped abruptly, recalling that his son was, as he had said, the
  Queen's husband. He must, then, speak of her with a respect that he would
  never again feel. Darnley seemed to sense what was behind the unfinished
  sentence:</p>

  <p>"You irritate me with your hints," he said rudely. "To-night I lodge in
  the palace, you may come too if you want. It is as well that Moray and his
  creatures should begin to know us." He added, with awkward insolence: "I will
  have David Rizzio as my secretary, he will receive a good wage. Be civil to
  him, if you please, I owe him for much service."</p>

  <p>Lennox understood at once. Of course Harry, woman-bred as he was, would
  never have done it alone. The knave had been useful, then.</p>

  <p>Moray slept uneasily. He was much given to dreaming; in his visions of the
  night all his native day fears escaped and flew loose in the darkened
  heavens.</p>

  <p>He thought he walked across the land he loved, the rough heather yielded
  beneath his feet, the dark hills lowered to right and left of him, the thick
  clouds were low and almost pressing on his brow. Before him stalked a
  gigantic figure in armour whom he took to be his guide, his protector,
  perhaps his providence. It walked where there was no path and Moray followed,
  over round pale pebbles, dark moss soaked by mountain streams, by the wild
  wet winds which beat on his face.</p>

  <p>He was troubled by his lonely, toilsome march, yet all his hopes were on
  the armoured giant in front of him, who promised him the confirmation of all
  his desires&mdash;a crown and a queen. They were hidden somewhere ahead, on
  the inaccessible mountain-top draped by the wraithlike clouds.</p>

  <p>On Moray walked, on, on in his dream. The moon came out and shone on the
  clear tinkling water-breaks and on the heather that was the colour of old,
  dried blood. Moray was exhausted; his vigour slipped from him like a cloak
  thrown away, but the tramp of the majestic armed figure did not relax, and at
  last they reached together the top of a mountain, where there was a cairn
  surmounted by a monument of grey stones.</p>

  <p>The figure turned; Moray looked at a closed visor. He thought this figure
  was himself, symbolic of his fortunes, mighty, majestic, impregnable,
  implacable upon the highest mountain-top. He peered to see the circlet on the
  helm, and there it was, the royal crown of Robert Bruce, while on the red and
  yellow scarf twisted across the breastplate he saw the thistles gleam in
  gold&mdash;King, King of Scotland.</p>

  <p>He implored the figure to speak, but it did not move. Moray, in his dream,
  then leant forward and unbuckled the helmet-strap and let the visor fall. He
  gazed into a void, the helmet was empty. As he stared, the armour fell to
  pieces where it stood, a heap of useless metal on the mountain-top, gorgets
  and vambrace, greave and breastplate, helm and crown, and as he knelt down
  beside this collapse of all his high hopes, he saw that they had withered to
  rusty shafts of discarded metal.</p>

  <p>He woke, half-shrieking in his sleep, but what he said had nothing to do
  with the vision which had troubled him, which was instantly dismissed from
  his mind as it had instantly been begotten. He muttered, turning from his
  placidly sleeping wife:</p>

  <p>"Where did the boy get the red enamelled ring?"</p>

  <p>Moray was in conference with the Queen. Gravely, and without a hint of
  emotion he put before her all the business he had done in her absence.</p>

  <p>The Queen lay back in her chair and smiled. At first she listened with
  discreet interest to all his wise judgments and shrewd remarks, putting in
  now and then a gentle comment of her own. Then she grew tired of these
  pretences and broke out into open mockery.</p>

  <p>"Why are you so dull and heavy to-day? You are like one of your own
  puritanical creatures, James, with your formality."</p>

  <p>But he had determined, before he engaged on this interview, that she
  should not move him to anger, nor incite him to any display of emotion, and
  he had been prepared for some such test as this. So he answered dryly:</p>

  <p>"There must be in this kingdom of yours some responsible person to manage
  these matters."</p>

  <p>She did not answer, save by an increase of the smile on her painted
  lips.</p>

  <p>"Someone," he said, keeping his voice steady, "must work for your comfort,
  your luxury, and your estate."</p>

  <p>"Did I ask you to do so?" she murmured very softly, and he answered her
  challenge, still keeping his voice low. "Have you asked any other man to do
  so?"</p>

  <p>"Now you would play the tyrant," she pouted, "and find out all my
  secrets."</p>

  <p>"No," he shook his head. His serenity was not feigned, for he felt master
  of her when she was in this kind of mood. "It is not your secrets which
  trouble me, but those things which everyone talks about, even the rabble in
  the streets."</p>

  <p>"Ah, so I must face my faults again!" sighed the Queen, mischievously.
  "What are they? Tell me them all, James! How happy I was in Stirling without
  your rebukes."</p>

  <p>"And yet when you returned I felt so safe."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said the Queen, "there's the crux of it! You felt so safe, James,
  but I, perhaps I never felt safe since I returned to Scotland."</p>

  <p>He was armed against her; he had come prepared to withstand her
  artfulness.</p>

  <p>"The people are condemning your behaviour: the favours you show Lennox and
  his young son." He paused to give his taunts emphasis. "This young, insolent
  boy."</p>

  <p>"So you find him," said the Queen, unmoved.</p>

  <p>Moray looked down into her pale, smooth features. How could he ever have
  trusted her, how ever have gone surety for her honesty to
  Maitland&mdash;Maitland who understood so much better than himself this sly
  creature with whom it was their great misfortune to deal!</p>

  <p>"I tell you, Mary, that you have betrayed us all. You do not realize the
  perils in which we stand and I am here to warn you. Perhaps I alone care
  enough for you to do so. You behave so carelessly that anyone might
  believe&mdash;" he paused, remembering his resolve to hold back his
  anger.</p>

  <p>"I have no reason to care what they believe. No one in this country has
  ever loved me, no one cares for my name nor reputation save those few whom I
  brought with me and that very man you mock me with ..."</p>

  <p>"A pauper!" took up Moray, breathing quickly, "a coarse boy! One who has
  neither character nor estate." The Queen's hand rose to her breast.</p>

  <p>"He has the right!" she whispered, "he has the right! He is a prince and
  as well-born as I am. I know why you hate him, Moray."</p>

  <p>He turned his head away, pausing for a second, because she had used his
  formal title.</p>

  <p>"I did not say I hated him."</p>

  <p>"I know it," smiled the Queen, "look at me and say you do not."</p>

  <p>He returned the challenge of her cruelty:</p>

  <p>"It would be truer to say that I despise him, Mary. I never thought to see
  my work for Scotland or for you hampered by someone like him. Remember," he
  added, "there is no one behind you&mdash;none&mdash;except those I choose to
  put there, and if you take him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If I choose him," murmered the Queen, motionless as she sat in the great
  chair.</p>

  <p>"He'll not last long," sighed Moray, "and it might be, in his fall, that
  he would drag you down."</p>

  <p>The Queen sat up suddenly and leaned forward.</p>

  <p>"Do you threaten me?" she asked. She seemed neither alarmed nor offended,
  but rather as if she were excited, stimulated, even pleased by Moray's bold
  front.</p>

  <p>"It is Scotland who menaces you," he answered with admirable calm. "You
  must not take this boy. I have stood aside since you returned from Stirling.
  But it has gone on too long. A caprice is all very well; but it must come and
  go like a spurt of wildfire. Gifts are exchanged&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But if it is not a caprice?" interrupted the Queen, smiling. "Suppose
  this is the man for me? Suppose I choose him, take him, crown him, place him
  above you in estate?"</p>

  <p>Moray leant towards her from the high ornate table where he sat; the
  likeness between the two faces, the heavy lined face of the man and the
  delicate face of the woman, was very apparent in that moment of emotion.
  Something subtle, almost indefinable in the two countenances, showed
  distinctly&mdash;the similarity in the thick lids, the almost invisible
  slanting brows, the curved full lips. They defied each other and the Queen's
  spirit rose to the encounter. She seemed to relish this conflict with this
  man of her own blood, the only one who up to now had been her master.</p>

  <p>"What do you suspect me of?" she asked directly.</p>

  <p>"It is not a question of what I suspect you of, but what is said in the
  streets and taverns, what the Lords whisper when they meet together, what the
  women sneer when they nudge each other as you pass&mdash;one word that I must
  not say."</p>

  <p>Then, very carefully, for he was making a fierce effort over rising fury,
  he said:</p>

  <p>"If you are fond of him, Mary, teach him not to be so insolent, teach him
  to be civil, at least to me."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders and answered carelessly: "I shall make him Earl
  of Ross."</p>

  <p>Moray looked down at his hands. He was glad to see that his firm fingers
  did not quiver; he had command over himself, perhaps still over
  her&mdash;even if she was what the common people said.</p>

  <p>"There is another person you must warn," he said&mdash;his tone was that
  of a king to a subject&mdash;"that presumptuous, strutting Italian."</p>

  <p>"Whom do you mean?" The Queen still smiled.</p>

  <p>"I mean Lord Darnley's lackey whom he keeps to run his errands and fawn on
  him."</p>

  <p>The Queen had a little plume of black feathers at her waist set in a
  mirror encircled by pearls. She raised this and waved it to and fro with a
  wide sweeping movement so that the sable tips almost touched Moray's cheeks
  and then her own.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that I should interfere in my cousin's household?"</p>

  <p>"You cannot twist words with me, Mary. I say what I have come to say, I
  speak from what I know. I warn you. Mary, not a man in Scotland who has any
  worth does not detest these two."</p>

  <p>But the black fan continued to wave slowly to and fro. Moray felt it brush
  against his cold cheek.</p>

  <p>"If you intend to have your own way," he said, rising, "be sure that I
  shall oppose you."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, if it should come to that," smiled the Queen, without moving, "I
  too have my friends."</p>

  <p>"Madame, I do not think so. Except what rabble Lennox could call together
  there is no one who would stand behind you and that boy."</p>

  <p>"Ah! If you ..." breathed the Queen, almost as if she watched something
  reach a desired climax. "Ah! That now! If you were to call a rebellion,
  now!"</p>

  <p>He made no denial. In silence, carefully, with the precise movements of a
  business man, he gathered up his papers and parchments, folded them, and put
  them into his portfolio. Then, as a retreating enemy makes one last backward
  sally, he demanded:</p>

  <p>"How did Henry Stewart come by the small red ring?" She turned this
  glancingly aside with another question: "When have you see it before?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps the same place where you gave it him, Mary&mdash;when you were
  abed."</p>

  <p>The Queen laughed loudly, throwing back her head. "When I was abed, James,
  when I was abed!"</p>

  <p>Mary Seaton sat near the window so that the thin light of a fitful May
  afternoon might fall upon her work: she was embroidering a map of Scotland.
  At a long table in the centre of the room the Queen and Lord Darnley played
  at billiards. The Italian secretary stood near Mary Seaton and handed her the
  strands of silk as she required them.</p>

  <p>The fifth person in the chamber was one who did not often seek this
  company&mdash;Lord Moray, whose watchful, silent presence seemed to be like a
  spell to keep the others dumb, for no one spoke; there was an air of tension
  in all they did. Even the Queen had not her usual mocking good-humour.</p>

  <p>She kept her glance on the small balls of ivory and never once raised her
  eyes to meet her half-brother's profound gaze.</p>

  <p>Moray, leaning against the arras, made no concealment of his keen
  observation of these three people whom he seemed to be, in a manner, judging:
  the Queen, mute and secretive, every line of whose face and figure was so
  well known to him; Henry Stewart, tall and heavy, who seemed, uneasily
  reserved, yet who now and then turned a smile of boyish simplicity towards
  his opponent and who sometimes looked about him as if he were endeavouring to
  discover some way of escape. Mary Seaton, usually so placid, to-day seemed
  grieved and troubled. She peered continually over her shoulder at the two
  playing billiards and watched them as she took the silk from David Rizzio.
  Often she seemed about to speak, yet was silent, not knowing how to choose
  her words.</p>

  <p>The Italian himself was quite complacent. His dark eyes, expressionless as
  those of an animal, returned blankly Moray's sharp stare. He was very patient
  in matching the difficult colours of the map of Scotland and was unmoved by
  Moray's contemptuous scrutiny. He had the calm of one whose singleness of
  purpose could endure any amount of analysis.</p>

  <p>Moray hated this upstart with an instinctive and exhaustive loathing. To
  him the Italian, raised by the whim of Henry Stewart out of obscurity to this
  intimate servitude, was detestable as a scorpion, a snake, a toad, any fabled
  creature that carries poison and disaster.</p>

  <p>This bitter judgment of Moray was not disturbed by the fact that there was
  nothing offensive in the exterior of the Italian. His shape was elegant and
  set off clothes that, though rich and well-chosen, were not beyond his
  station. His elegantly modelled face expressed melancholy and refinement,
  tenderness, and a desire to please. There was something attractive in the
  foreign fashion in which he wore his long, smooth hair, which looked the
  colour of old bronze. His hands, too, were fine, those of a careful penman,
  of a musician&mdash;of a picker of locks and pockets, thought Moray, with a
  rising disgust. He was not deceived by this superficial grace; his wits,
  naturally acute, had been sharpened by a wide experience; he was certain that
  the Italian was evil. Had he been able to do so, he would instantly have
  called up two honest Scotch fellows and had Rizzio thrown out of the Queen's
  apartments, nay, out of the palace, on to the dungheap, there to rot amid the
  stench and corruption that was his due, and from whence, doubtless, he had
  sprung.</p>

  <p>Lord Darnley found the presence of Moray and the tension of the room
  intolerable. He glanced angrily at the silent, sombre man leaning against the
  tapestry and, with a piteous affectation of ease, sauntered over to where
  Mary Seaton worked in the fitful light. The Italian, eager to please his
  master, pointed out how prettily the contours of Scotland were growing on the
  canvas.</p>

  <p>"Where are Lord Moray's possessions?" asked the young man in a loud
  voice.</p>

  <p>Mary Seaton looked bewildered and did not respond, but David Rizzio, with
  a deft finger, pointed out Lord Moray's lands, tracing them here, there, on
  the half-filled-in canvas.</p>

  <p>"It is too much," said Henry Stewart, "too much for a subject!" He looked
  defiantly at the Queen as if at once challenging her anger and appealing for
  her support.</p>

  <p>Moray said quietly:</p>

  <p>"Sir, you must ask my pardon for that."</p>

  <p>The Queen, the billiard cue still in her hand, stood silent a second and
  no one knew which way her humour would go. Then she turned her back on Lord
  Darnley and, smiling at her half-brother, said:</p>

  <p>"Of course he will ask your pardon."</p>

  <p>She looked over her shoulder at the young man and commanded him to do
  this.</p>

  <p>Henry Stewart stared. He could not credit that he was being rebuked. A
  slow fury seemed gathering behind his silence, and the Italian, effacing
  himself, bending with humble interest over the silks, contrived to touch his
  arm, a gentle yet forcible pressure.</p>

  <p>Lord Darnley, in an expressionless voice, said:</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, sir, my words have given you offence. I withdraw them and
  apologize."</p>

  <p>Moray bent his head and left the room, but not before he had seen the
  strange glance of the Italian, no longer like that of an animal, placid and
  meaningless, but full of calculating wickedness.</p>

  <p>As the door closed Henry Stewart broke out into a passion of distress. How
  long was he thus to be baited, goaded, how long to be set beneath everyone
  when he should lead all! He turned impetuously on his servant, whose
  restraining touch he had almost mechanically obeyed as the slow mind will
  obey the signal of the quick one, as the mule responds to the flick of his
  driver's whip and afterwards kicks.</p>

  <p>"You should have allowed me to say what I wished to say. Why should I have
  apologized?"</p>

  <p>"But sir," replied the Italian, "by doing that you had the victory. You
  left him dumb, defeated. You showed your breeding, your princely nature, made
  him appear boorish and clumsy. Sir," and the southern voice was like a
  caress, "you can afford to wait."</p>

  <p>Without any regard for the presence of the Queen or that of Mary Seaton,
  who hung constrained and hesitating over her unfortunate embroidery, Lord
  Darnley began to rail against Moray, against his followers, against all the
  lords and nobles of Scotland who had all flouted him, insulted him and done
  their best to injure him since he had first come to Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Queen, still leaning against the billiard table, listened with seeming
  idleness. Her attitude was one of fatigue. She considered the two men
  disputing before her in the window-place, the master so harsh and haughty,
  choosing his words with impatient clumsiness and small command of language,
  repeating again and again the same phrases, frowning, keeping his hand on his
  hips, moving awkwardly in an ill-expressed, almost inarticulate rage; the
  servant, elegant, sly, with his strange, exquisitely modelled face, all his
  words clever, adroit, elegantly chosen, flattering, pleasing, soothing. There
  was something leonine about Henry, so large, imposing and golden, and
  something of the delicate fox about the Italian, so elegant and clever. Yes,
  she smiled to her self at her own simile. She had seen a picture in a book,
  The Lion and the Fox, a large, stupid beast being at once soothed and
  deceived by the wiles and flatterings of the small, crafty animal.</p>

  <p>What a deal of trouble David Rizzio saves me, she thought; if he were not
  here it would be I who should have to coax this stupid boy into a good
  mood.</p>

  <p>She looked warmly at the Italian, silently thanking him for his
  brilliancy, his gaiety, and his quickness.</p>

  <p>Lord Darnley grumbled himself to silence-, he was appeased but not
  satisfied. He still muttered that everyone treated him with uncivil,
  contemptuous bitterness. And why? He had offended none.</p>

  <p>Moray waited like a lackey on his mistress's pleasure in the corridor
  close to the door through which the Queen must pass, soon, to the council
  chamber. He felt full of discord, misery, and unrest, yet knew he was able to
  control these distresses. He seemed a peaceful man; there had been no change
  during the last few weeks in his placid demeanour, no neglect in his exercise
  of his duties, his attention to his necessary business. Yet his whole complex
  nature was at war, with himself and with outside influences.</p>

  <p>The Queen came, opening and shutting the door impetuously, and turned as
  if to pass him; a quick sweep of a black gown, a swing of her white veil, a
  lift of her shoulder and a laugh and Moray had caught her wrist.</p>

  <p>"It does not matter in the least whether or not you go to the council
  to-day, but it matters that I speak to you, perhaps for the last time."</p>

  <p>She was at once mocking:</p>

  <p>"For the last time! You have said that before."</p>

  <p>"One warning," he reminded her, "like one kiss, must be the last." He
  stared at her in agony. He could not believe that this passionate and
  pleasant woman was really lost to all his dreams of her&mdash;a crowned queen
  of his race, a noble queen. Pride of family, possessive affection and bitter
  jealousy coloured his words, though he tried to keep them impersonal and be
  the mentor talking to the scholar, the man rebuking the child.</p>

  <p>"Those three in there, Mary, become your close, almost your only
  intimates&mdash;a stupid boy who does not know himself, a rascal whose name I
  detest, a silly girl with her head full of superstition."</p>

  <p>"Let go my wrist," smiled the Queen, pulling free of him. She did not
  attempt to escape but leaned against the dark panelling of the corridor and
  looked at him with no loss of temper nor dignity. They had this in common,
  these two children of the same king, that all they did was touched with
  greatness and nobility, though in the woman this was light and smiling, in
  the man, heavy and austere.</p>

  <p>"So you put them all together in a breath," she said. "A prince, a
  gentlewoman, a servant."</p>

  <p>"You put them all together in your affections, Mary." He took her hand
  again, and now with unconscious tenderness. "Before God, I speak only for
  your sake. I would keep you unsmirched. There are some things I would not
  even have you know, there are some creatures at whom I would not have you
  look. These hangers-on of the court make but a dance of marionettes. Heed
  them not! They are lawless and uncontrolled and seek only their own
  advantage."</p>

  <p>"Alas!" she mocked softly, "who does not?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said he, speaking low and hurriedly, for he knew not when the
  door might open and Henry Stewart and his Italian and the half-imbecile Mary
  Seaton come out, "perhaps you put me on that level, and there you are wrong.
  I have before pledged myself to keep you where you are, smooth your way, keep
  the ugly and the cruel and the coarse-grained from you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know, I know!" she interrupted again, "and I have promised that you
  shall do it. I have said that I am glad and thankful that you shall do it,
  but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He saw by the look in her eyes that she was about to lie to him, to make
  neat, pretty excuses, perhaps only the little lies and the trivial excuses
  she so loved and that were so unimportant, but he was not in the mood for
  anything but truth.</p>

  <p>"I can but watch," he said.</p>

  <p>Her gaiety clouded over, her voice became sad.</p>

  <p>"Come apart with me, James, into the&mdash;no, you will not enter the
  chapel nor my oratory. I thought if we prayed together it would make these
  tangles easier to unravel, but I had forgotten for a while that you are a
  heretic."</p>

  <p>He was not offended at this absurdity. She led him down the corridor,
  their fingers linked together, into a tall room which their father had used.
  The shelves were filled by fine clasped books with gold stamped backs and
  long markers hanging from the seldom opened pages. The narrow lancet window
  looked on the park where from this distance May leaves looked like a gaudy
  veil on the green boughs. Moray remembered that winter day when he had stood
  in the midst of that park and seen the hare leer at him, and his thoughts
  were full of sorcery, of witchcraft, and of infernal incitements. Yet he put
  these away from him and faced the woman, quietly putting before her the
  claims of reason, of prudence, and of common sense. Then his rhetoric was
  broken, his voice faltered and fell silent. He perceived that she, sitting at
  the narrow table where her father had often mourned in a brooding solitude,
  was sighing sadly.</p>

  <p>A compassionate fondness overwhelmed him, everything was forgotten in a
  terror lest this brilliant, brittle creature should languish, fade, and
  perhaps die. Lately his secret, anxious scrutiny had noticed her as much
  altered, not so swift and laughing, falling sometimes into melancholy, her
  dignity changed into false merriment, her lively speech overcast.</p>

  <p>She was whispering in French to herself and he could not understand what
  she said, for her voice was so low, her lips hidden behind the shielding
  hands. He offered her in eager single-heartedness all that he had to
  offer&mdash;his talents, his power, his strength, his influence, his wealth,
  the promise that he had made so often before, to keep Scotland and the throne
  for her and for her only.</p>

  <p>"I know you think I have worked because of ambition, Mary, and love of
  authority, but that is not so, or only partly so. It is for you, you
  only!"</p>

  <p>She looked up at him; her face, marred by tears, was the colour of a
  pearl. He had his second ecstasy; he believed that they understood each other
  perfectly. She accepted his homage and his assurance that he would be able to
  perform with triumphant success all that he promised. Nothing was any longer
  dark or confused between them. But she withdrew herself from this clarity,
  which for that second he had believed transfigured their relations.</p>

  <p>He began to smile; he knew that she was going to use him, to lull him,
  perhaps to flatter. He flung out his hand sternly and said:</p>

  <p>"No! I'll be neither cheated nor soothed."</p>

  <p>She touched her moist eyes fastidiously with her handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"I am going to speak to you of Earl Bothwell," she smiled. "He never came
  to answer the charges against him. I think he has returned to France."</p>

  <p>"It often pleases you," returned Moray, livid, "when I talk to you
  seriously, to put Earl Bothwell before me. While I rule in Scotland he will
  not stay long, even on the Border."</p>

  <p>"While you rule," said the Queen under her breath.</p>

  <p>"So I said, Mary&mdash;while I rule! Take care, my child, how you displace
  me and make another your master."</p>

  <p>He left her with a firm and resolute step.</p>

  <p>The Queen remained alone in the little closet where she was sure no one
  would find her. She would not, after all, go to the council chamber to-day;
  very likely they would not miss her. It would not matter; they took no heed
  of what she said, she had no influence over any of them. She felt towards
  them all a deep hostility.</p>

  <p>She was not interested in Scotland nor in its inhabitants. Sometimes she
  thought that she hated the country, though she liked the rides between the
  hills, over the heather, and beside the riverlets; she liked even sometimes
  the misty, rainy weather, the high winds. She had contrived to get some of
  the palaces to her liking, yet what was the country to her but an antique
  relic, handed down from one of her forbears to another until at last it came
  to rest in her frail, indifferent hands. Whatever her contempt of the country
  she would be queen in it; since she could not rule in France she would rule
  in Scotland.</p>

  <p>She thought of the father whom she had never seen, who had sat in this
  closet with his melancholy reflections, his ambitious designs mute in his
  mind. A gallant, brilliant, handsome man, dead of a broken heart. The same
  malady had vanquished her grandfather. Beyond that, all the kings from whom
  she was descended had died violently.</p>

  <p>She rose, sighed, and put her hands on her waist. She hated making plans
  or looking ahead. When the crisis came she would make and follow out a rapid,
  clever decision. Taken by surprise she could always act with promptitude and
  courage, but to plan ahead, think out something prudent and cunning, that she
  cared for not at all. Yet she liked beguiling and deceiving people, weaving
  nets of looks and glances and sighs and half-heard words about them; this, to
  have any pleasure in it, must be done carelessly in a matter of a moment, on
  impulse.</p>

  <p>She turned over in her mind with slow relish the recollection of the
  emotion of the man who had just stood beside her, the man who should have
  been a great prince, who was also a child of the king who had once mused in
  this quiet closet.</p>

  <p>She liked to think she had his tormented but steadfast love to fall back
  on. That, and the sly love of Maitland, had a different quality from any
  other passion she had inspired. She believed that she could not exhaust it,
  that she might do as she chose and always find this devoted love for her
  dominant in the heart and mind of those two men. Moray would do as he had
  promised&mdash;hold her steady on her throne.</p>

  <p>And for the rest of it? She sighed again, walking up and down. Moray would
  rage when he discovered that she had chosen Henry Stewart. That would almost
  destroy his fidelity, but not quite. He had said always intolerable things
  when he had preached and rated; but she would only have to smile and speak
  humbly, plead in a suppliant tone and he would come forward to serve her
  again, but that would have to be on other terms. She could do without him,
  his conscientiousness, his ability, his hard work. Yet, she would like to be
  free of him, of Maitland, of all of them who clustered so close about her;
  menacing, rebuking, spying, she would disperse them all.</p>

  <p>She considered carefully the terms in which Moray had spoken of her three
  attendants&mdash;Henry Stewart and his servant and Mary Seaton. Fools,
  rascals, and imbeciles, he had named them. Well, he was only wise in one
  instance. Her fleeting thoughts dwelt on Henry Stewart to whom she had so
  impetuously and proudly pledged herself. Sometimes he wearied her, sometimes
  he was difficult and tedious, sometimes even, she seemed to have no power
  over him; he would prefer his sports, his games, his English gentlemen and
  servants. Yet, in the evenings, when Mary Seaton would admit him by the
  secret ways to her chamber, when David Rizzio would guard the door, when she
  would be perfumed, painted, clad in thin gauze, her hair fastened with gold
  pins, then he loved her as she loved him, in so intense and beautiful a
  fashion that the whole world seemed heroic.</p>

  <p>Her smile deepened with her memories. She teased him, she vexed him, they
  were estranged for days together; but always there was the reunion when his
  beauty, his simplicity, and his strength seemed to her like precious jewels
  brought out from a casket and secretly delighted in.</p>

  <p>Two people made these hidden joys possible&mdash;Mary Seaton, who was
  almost weak-minded and ought to have been a nun, no doubt, and who was
  faithful and reliable, and the Italian, very like, as Moray had said, what
  men would call a rascal&mdash;a pimp. But how dexterous, subtle, pliable, and
  unscrupulous! The Queen put her finger to her lips as she thought of David
  Rizzio. No doubt he loved her too; he did not serve her and her furtively
  wedded husband wholly for pay. He loved her, in an odd profound fashion; he
  valued, even cherished, her prodigal beauty.</p>

  <p>One day while they were at Stirling she had been seated by the fire in the
  twilight of her tall room, while a late storm of hail beat upon the windows.
  The Italian had come in, with his step so trained to lightness that she had
  not known he was there till he was close to her chair. He had been looking,
  he whispered, for his master, and she had said that Darnley was not there,
  but, she thought, in the oratory. Though he was not religious minded there
  were times when he would pray with childish fervour.</p>

  <p>Then the Italian had sunk down at her feet and stretched himself out like
  a hound on the silk rugs, quite still and tranquil, the waves of his dark
  hair touching the tips of her shoes. She had said nothing, accepting his
  silence graciously. It had seemed to her that something had passed between
  them, that they had been engaged together in some spiritual adventure, some
  stimulation of the mind, which they had shared. It was as if he made a
  confession to her of his miserable origin, his base struggles, of his vile
  and subservient conditions, and it was as if she gave him absolution in that
  moment of secluded peace.</p>

  <p>The Queen blazed at Easter. She held the great Feast of the Resurrection
  as no man could remember it being held in Scotland before, not even in the
  days before the monasteries were despoiled and John Knox and the Lords of the
  Congregation set up over the land.</p>

  <p>There was more music, more lights, more priests and vestments, more
  singing and flowers than ever there had been before. The Queen put off her
  mourning dress, her languid ways, her air of waiting on circumstance; there
  was something about her step and her look that was assured and triumphant.
  Hitherto an organ had been sufficient to make the music in the royal chapel,
  but now there must be violins, sackbuts, lutes, and harps, as well as drums
  and trumpets to celebrate the rising of Christ from the tomb. The Queen
  appeared among her courtiers and before her subjects as if at a hazardous
  pitch of exaltation. She rejoiced and expanded in this great festival of the
  Church, while the Puritans drew aside, sour and menacing, on the verge of
  rebellion.</p>

  <p>The bells pealed, music played; the Roman Catholics in the Queen's
  household&mdash;French, English, and Scotch&mdash;went joyously arrayed,
  laughed and talked confidently together as if they believed the true Church
  could be replanted in this barren land from which it had been torn up and
  flung aside on the mudheap.</p>

  <p>Feeling among the people in the city, among the Lords and the preachers,
  was duly reported to the Queen. Thomas Randolph, Queen Elizabeth's envoy,
  spoke to her as boldly as he dared of the scandal her conduct was giving, of
  the indecorum of this flaunting of the forbidden Faith, the offence given to
  England by the pampering of Henry Stewart, the favouritism shown to his
  father; they almost alone among the Lords were Papists and could follow her
  to her gaudy, Romish festivals.</p>

  <p>The Queen looked at him out of her soft eyes and her words were quite cool
  and alert:</p>

  <p>"I have taken much good advice from England, been very deferential to my
  sister the Queen, perhaps the time is approaching when I shall choose for
  myself, take my own way."</p>

  <p>"To inevitable perdition," muttered Mr. Randolph in his heart.</p>

  <p>But she was so gracious and gentle even when she spoke these defiant words
  that he could feel nothing for her but compassion. He thought her position
  desperate&mdash;she had no money, no credit, no ally; the whole country was
  hostile to her mood. She had compromised herself almost past redemption with
  that shallow, detested youth. And as if that were not sufficient folly, she
  had chosen the most unlikely favourite a prince could light on; an Italian
  scoundrel whom no one had heard of before, who never had the air of a
  gentleman. She said he wrote her foreign letters for her, that she trusted
  him with most of her secrets. The Englishman could find no cue to this
  labyrinth of the Queen's emotions and knew not what to report to the English
  Court nor what to believe himself.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth had summoned Lennox and his son home, for they were English
  subjects and had, their mistress declared, outstayed their leave in Scotland.
  Randolph had taken this opportunity to wait upon the Earl and under the
  excuse of pressing his Queen's demands, to endeavour to learn something of
  the secret mind of these two penniless princes.</p>

  <p>Lennox had excused himself in incoherent bluster, a stupid man's defence
  which might have meant anything or nothing, but Mr. Randolph thought he had
  detected some deep emotion in the young man's bewildered, almost piteous.
  "What would you do if you were in my place, Mr. Randolph? Before God, I do
  not know what to do, yet I do not think I shall return."</p>

  <p>When the imposing religious festival of Easter was over, the Queen turned
  her volatile mind to earthly splendour. She gave great banquets in the long
  gallery at Holyrood, when anyone who wished might come to drink and eat, to
  jest and laugh. In the evening there was dancing by the light of torches,
  where the Queen gave her hand to any of her court who asked for it, where she
  moved sparkling with her famous jewels, the gems of France and Scotland,
  through the skilful patterns of the pavan or galliard.</p>

  <p>Then her extravagance took another turn: she put on a plain gown and, with
  such of her gentlewomen as could be induced to countenance the prank, ran
  abroad in the streets and by-ways of Edinburgh, collecting money from every
  passer-by until she could hardly carry the velvet bags of coins. With the
  money thus obtained she gave a banquet at which she sat herself, while all
  the citizens were allowed to pass along the gallery and stare. Afterwards
  there was free wine and sweetmeats, toys and trifles, and the remainder of
  the money flung back again to the pushing, curious, half-hostile crowd.</p>

  <p>Yet through all this, however common she made herself, she was
  nevertheless a creature of moonshine and of youth, a star of celestial
  radiance that could flash in the mud and out again untainted.</p>

  <p>On one of these wild days Mary Seaton wept while she unbraided the bright
  chestnut hair.</p>

  <p>"Why do you cry, Mary?" asked the Queen. "Are not these happy hours? Do
  you not know how soon we shall be free?"</p>

  <p>"I weep because of the things that people say of you, because of the way
  the vulgar talk. Because&mdash;oh, madame!&mdash;because you are a wedded
  wife before God and none knows it."</p>

  <p>The Queen unlaced her gown and looked at her white, pure bosom in the
  mirror.</p>

  <p>"What would you have me be, Mary?"</p>

  <p>"Unspotted before God, madame."</p>

  <p>"You would have me honest, chaste?"</p>

  <p>"Every woman should be that, madame."</p>

  <p>"It is only the stupid who can be so single-minded, so good. Don't you
  understand?&mdash;I am not simple." She kicked off her slippers and looked
  down at her perfect bare feet.</p>

  <p>"I do nothing wrong, I harm nobody."</p>

  <p>Mary Seaton did not reply. Sadly she picked up the Queen's jewels where
  they had dropped on to the silk carpet. The windows were open on the June
  night and the faint warmth blew into the perfumed room. Mary Seaton knew, and
  the Queen knew, that beyond the palace and the park was much tumult and
  half-suppressed discontent. The little city was full of armed men; most of
  the nobles had called up their retainers from their estates and villages.
  Everywhere you turned in the streets of Edinburgh you could see soldiers in
  armour, rough fellows from the north armed with swords and daggers.</p>

  <p>Moray and Maitland were perpetually in each other's houses. Those who
  waited in their ante-chambers could often hear their voices raised high in
  altercation.</p>

  <p>Ruthven, Argyll, Cassilis, Hume, Herries, went up and down with airs of
  agitation and haste.</p>

  <p>"When will you tell them you are married?" urged Mary Seaton.</p>

  <p>The Queen loosened her hair.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mary, I like this game I play. When it is known he is my husband
  shall I love him so well?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, madame, you name it love!"</p>

  <p>"For want of a better word, child."</p>

  <p>"Am I to admit him, madame, if he comes to-night?"</p>

  <p>"No, nor yet to-morrow night."</p>

  <p>"Is it not cruel to him, madame, this holding off? Yesterday he was almost
  in tears, I thought."</p>

  <p>"And yet he raged!"</p>

  <p>"Madame, you are making a fool of him. Can he forget that? It is a blight
  upon his manhood?"</p>

  <p>"He must do as I bid," said the Queen. "You are his friend, Mary. Warn him
  to be careful lest he should weary me."</p>

  <p>"Alas, madame, would he take such a warning from me?"</p>

  <p>"It were the better for him that he took it from someone," replied the
  Queen carelessly. "We must think out some device for Mary Fleming's wedding.
  That must be both choice and splendid. But could you fancy William Maitland
  as a lover?"</p>

  <p>"I think, madame, I have no heart or spirit for more festivals. I have
  danced and sung and sat up late&mdash;so often; too much."</p>

  <p>"Hush, Mary!" The Queen put her soft hand over the complaining mouth. "You
  have done it all for love of me and that absolves you in the eyes of
  Heaven."</p>

  <p>The pious girl kissed her mistress's fingers dutifully. She sighed and
  said:</p>

  <p>"Everything is so uneasy abroad. I never saw so many soldiers and armed
  men in Edinburgh. Everywhere, one thinks there are spies."</p>

  <p>"Hush, again!" said the Queen. "I know well enough how the country
  stands."</p>

  <p>"There are lampoons everywhere, ugly pamphlets and ballads. They say there
  were even some pasted on the palace gates."</p>

  <p>"What does it matter if we need not read them?" The Queen took up a blue
  velvet gown from the bed and threw it over her shift.</p>

  <p>"If the Italian should come, admit him."</p>

  <p>"Madame, I do not like to do that."</p>

  <p>The Queen laughed good-humouredly.</p>

  <p>"But, Mary, he comes to write letters for me, as you know. If you wish,
  you may stay there all the time and watch us at work."</p>

  <p>"Madame, I know that Lord Darnley begins to detest him."</p>

  <p>"You should call him the Earl of Ross now. Maybe, despite the English
  protests, I'll make him Duke of Albany."</p>

  <p>"Oh, my lord Earl, or my lord Duke, or what you will, my lord your
  husband, madame ...!"</p>

  <p>"That's a galling word," smiled the Queen. "Do as I bid you. When Rizzio
  comes and scratches on the panel, admit him. Come, I will tell you a secret.
  He writes privately for me to the Pope, the King of Spain,
  France&mdash;letters I would not have anyone in Scotland see or know of. His
  brother, Giuseppe, who is a clever lad, has found means to take them out of
  Scotland."</p>

  <p>A gleam of happiness passed over Mary Seaton's face; this seemed to her a
  lawful and generous design. The Queen pressed her advantage.</p>

  <p>"Do you not see, Mary&mdash;I mean to overturn the State? I have endured
  quite enough and for long enough. You will see how I, with my husband as I
  must call him, and such an instrument as David Rizzio, shall pull their plans
  about their heads. We'll have Mass said yet in every village in Scotland,
  Mary."</p>

  <p>The girl was satisfied; she sighed with relief. This made all that the
  Queen did sanctified. The Queen saw her friend's expression and smiled
  mischievously:</p>

  <p>"The Pope sent me his blessing, Mary," she remarked, "and promised me some
  money, too. That is a great secret, is it not? Mind you keep it
  carefully."</p>

  <p>The Queen sat in her closet in the blue gown dictating her secret letters
  to David Rizzio. She was astonished at what she had accomplished with such
  celerity and ease. With only the help of this patient foreigner she would be
  able to upset the policies of men like Moray and Maitland and turn the
  destiny of an impious kingdom, with as little effort as it took to knock the
  billiard balls from one end of the table to the other. They thought
  themselves so invincible, these ponderous men, with their carefully thought
  out plans. They had forgotten that she was not only a queen but a woman, and
  though she knew they were always reminding each other that she was
  French-bred and cardinal-trained, they seemed to have overlooked what that
  really meant. She had rare talents too; she could use finesse, intrigue
  delicately.</p>

  <p>She snuffed the two candles that stood on the desk where David Rizzio
  wrote slowly, in his careful cipher. Near his hand were the rough drafts in
  Mary's own writing of letters to the Duke of Savoy, His Holiness the Pope,
  the King of France, the King of Spain, and her uncles, the Cardinal and the
  Duke. All these people would help her to re-establish the true Faith in
  Scotland.</p>

  <p>"How careful you are, David," she said, leaning towards him.</p>

  <p>"Madame, the least mistake in the cipher might mean so much."</p>

  <p>He leant back in his chair, for his shoulders were stiff from bowing so
  long over the desk. For two hours he had been in the Queen's closet, working
  all that while steadily. Giuseppe had found a messenger who was leaving for
  Italy to-morrow and some of the letters, at least, had to be ready by the
  dawn.</p>

  <p>The Queen gazed at him with admiration. Never had she had a servant so
  diligent, so uncomplaining, always full of interest and enthusiasm. His mind,
  too, was very like her own; he would often understand her on the barest
  speech. In this he was a sharp contrast with Henry Stewart, who was so easily
  bewildered and confused, who understood nothing unless it was put before him
  clearly and repeatedly.</p>

  <p>By almost imperceptible degrees, during the days at Stirling, David Rizzio
  had left the service of Henry Stewart for that of the Queen, and now he lived
  in Holyrood in the official position of the Queen's secretary for her foreign
  letters. Why might she not keep such a one to write to her relatives and
  friends abroad? Where could she find a Scotsman with such knowledge of
  languages, of ciphers?</p>

  <p>She was not In the least tired, though she had sat there half the night.
  She was animated by the success of her tricks, she was inspired by the
  thought of the future. She could already see the great French ships arriving
  at Leith, Papal galleys being anchored in the Clyde, the trim ranks of
  foreign soldiers marching through the streets of Edinburgh, overawing the
  dirty, insolent rabble. She could see Knox and all his fellow-preachers
  flying for their lives out of Scotland while patient workmen from Italy and
  France rebuilt, stone by stone, the broken abbeys, the blackened churches,
  the cast-down convents. She could see in Holyrood a train of Church
  dignitaries, a Papal Nuncio, a Cardinal with his train&mdash;she would kneel
  to kiss his ring. No Protestant would dare to show his workaday face and drab
  clothes on that occasion. Next Easter should be more splendid than the
  last&mdash;she wanted lilies, the trumpets of the angels, like she had had in
  France. If they would not grow in Scotland she would have them
  made&mdash;curling wood, painted white with jewelled hearts.</p>

  <p>A half-sigh of fatigue from the secretary checked her dreams.</p>

  <p>"Are you tired, David?" she asked. Her breast was open, her arms
  half-bare; her air was tender and merry.</p>

  <p>She had, from those days in Stirling, always called him by his name. Why
  not? She called her monkey Florestan, her parrot Pierrot, she had pet names
  for all her dogs.</p>

  <p>"I am not tired, madame, I am thinking."</p>

  <p>He leant forward, his elbows on the desk, his face in his long hands. The
  corners of his fingers lightly raised the long tresses of bronze-coloured
  hair.</p>

  <p>"What are you thinking of then?"</p>

  <p>"I am thinking, madame, of this business with which I help you."</p>

  <p>He spoke with the utmost deference, and yet with a familiarity which was,
  somehow, sweet to her, for it conveyed that he had become part of all her
  schemes and hopes and had no wish nor desire apart from her wishes or
  desires. And who else was there in Scotland of that mind?</p>

  <p>"I am thinking, madame, that you will need men, an armed force. From what
  I can understand, the Protestants would have almost the whole country behind
  them."</p>

  <p>"Not quite!" The Queen rose. "Finish your letters to-morrow, all but the
  Italian&mdash;that is ready?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, madame, it only requires sealing. I have put on it the secret stamp
  of black wax that we arranged. But for the men? All Scotland would be behind
  Lord Moray."</p>

  <p>"Not all, I think, David. I know where I can get help against the
  Protestants."</p>

  <p>The secretary had risen, but the Queen got to her feet, standing before
  the desk as he sealed up the letters and placed them in the bosom of his
  jacket of ruffled satin. He always went very richly attired; his mistress was
  lavish with presents far beyond his agreed wage.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you a secret, David. There is a man whom I can recall, now in
  disgrace, who would rouse the north&mdash;the Gordon, Lord Huntly."</p>

  <p>The Italian looked at her expectantly, very pleased, for nothing gave him
  more delight than to think of her triumph soon approaching; he saw himself as
  the favourite of a mighty sovereign.</p>

  <p>"There is another who will get me the Border, that is Lord Bothwell. If he
  is really a sorcerer I shall desire him to blast&mdash;ah, several
  people."</p>

  <p>The Italian knew both these great gentlemen to be ruined and disgraced,
  but he could grasp at once how they might be used in the Papist service.</p>

  <p>"You see," said the Queen, "I am not quite unprepared. I have my cavaliers
  in readiness."</p>

  <p>The Italian noted that she had not mentioned her husband as her foremost
  champion. Delicately, he touched upon this subject, as one who gives a hint
  without wounding.</p>

  <p>"The Lord Henry Darnley, he will lead Your Majesty's armies?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Tell me, David, will he not look splendid in full armour? Blued,
  gilt, with a vast panache of feathers, yellow, red, above a lion crest?"</p>

  <p>"Madame, most magnificent."</p>

  <p>"You must go now, David, it is the middle of the night. Mary Seaton will
  be half-asleep. How patiently she watches for me! She is a good, pious girl.
  What a pity her lover died. She thinks herself happy in her cold dreams. She
  says she despises the allurements of lust&mdash;which are mere flashes of
  fire."</p>

  <p>The Queen stood by the desk looking intently at the elegant, dark young
  man. She felt avid for great events, for mighty happenings. She wanted
  everybody's life emptied into her life; she wanted the pain and rage of
  Moray, the passion and bewilderment of Henry Stewart, the devotion and
  fawning service of David Rizzio. She even wanted the services of scoundrels
  like Earl Bothwell, of the discredited rebels like Earl Huntly. She wanted
  the meek, half-reproachful tenderness of Mary Seaton and the warm affection
  of Mary Fleming, the homage and affection of William Maitland.</p>

  <p>David Rizzio moved noiselessly behind her, and they left the little closet
  together. He could scarcely control his delight in thus leaving the apartment
  of the Queen in the middle of the night: he might almost have been the
  Queen's lover. Some people thought he was and he took good care to let no one
  know that he had done no more than touch her hand; after all, how many had
  done that? Even Giuseppe was doubtful as to the exact place he held in the
  Queen's regard. David, dropping half-hints, was careful to keep him so. How
  glad he was that he had been industrious as a boy and in his passion for
  self-advancement had learnt everything that had come his way which might be
  useful. He was well trained now; he could do everything that she wanted of
  him&mdash;write her letters, do her ciphers, play a lute, sing a song.</p>

  <p>As she herself opened the door for him, he felt such a lift of triumph at
  seeing the Queen standing there with a candle to light his way down the
  corridor that it seemed to him as if Henry Stewart had only been the
  steppingstone to his fortune. He knew, though he pretended not to, how many
  nights the Queen's husband had been turned away from her apartment. He knew
  how the wretched, bewildered youth fretted and sickened in a position that
  was almost intolerable. Even that very night when the Queen had been sitting
  with him, the servant, he had heard Mary Seaton arguing in a low tone with
  Henry Stewart, who had come by the secret way wanting to speak with his
  wife.</p>

  <p>The Queen closed the door and the Italian fumbled in the dark down the
  corridor. When he reached his own room he lit a lamp, and the first thing he
  did was to look at himself in the French mirror the Queen had given him. He
  was pleased with his reflection, even now when he was pale with fatigue. As
  he gazed at himself, he thought that he compared very well with others, even
  with princes, even with Henry Stewart.</p>

  <p>Not able to sleep for excitement, he went into the next room and roused
  Giuseppe under the excuse of telling him that in an hour or so he must be on
  his way with the letter to Italy, which was first to be taken to Leith, where
  the man with whom they had arranged the matter would be waiting.</p>

  <p>Henry Stewart lay in his father's house. He had refused to return to the
  palace. Lennox was in despair. How often had he not shaken the curtains,
  staring down at the face of his son with the obstinately closed eyes, and
  said angrily: "You are the Queen's husband! Why do you not proclaim it out
  loud? Is she only to acknowledge you by candlelight or in her bed?"</p>

  <p>He had repeated those taunts until he was sick of them. There was nothing
  more to be said on that score. The boy would not act and he, the father,
  could not, dare not. He might, by meddling, spoil everything. He tried to
  console himself by thinking that this was some lover's quarrel, but he was
  really paralysed by an intense fear&mdash;a woman like that, a capricious
  wanton woman, who in a few weeks had taken him! Might she not in a few weeks
  leave him! It ought to have been a public wedding at once. This secret
  ceremony, what had it been? It was invalid, anyhow, without a Papal
  Dispensation, for they were related within the fourth degree. She might
  repudiate it, laugh at both of them.</p>

  <p>Nagging worries tortured the old man's mind. He wished he had never left
  England and the wise counsels of his wife. He felt an aversion to Scotland
  and all that Scotland represented as he sat in the shrouded room while the
  boy on whom all his hopes had been centred for years lay on the hired bed
  like a marionette whose strings had been cut.</p>

  <p>Restless in his anxiety, the old man rose and peered again into the face
  of his son. He could not tell if he was sleeping or feigning sleep, or even
  unconscious: he seemed sunk in a profound lethargy. His round, smooth face
  looked quite boyish. Timidly he touched his son's hand lying palm upwards on
  the coverlet. How hot it was! Lennox touched the brow&mdash;it was burning,
  too, and the hair was wet with sweat.</p>

  <p>A fever! The wretched man thought of poison. Had some enemies thought of
  that way of defeating him? He snatched at his son's shoulders and gripped him
  so forcibly, called him so piteously that the young man sighed out of his
  lethargy, opened his eyes, and sat up. When he saw who had disturbed him he
  tried to repulse his father. But Lennox was persistent He felt he must
  know.</p>

  <p>"Go back to the Abbey. Speak to her, insist upon an audience. Have you
  quarrelled? What has she done? Remember with whom you deal&mdash;this is a
  moment for firmness!"</p>

  <p>"Sir," interrupted the boy in a voice that pleaded for peace, "I can tell
  you no more than this, that she is my wife and will not say so. I think my
  blood has been poisoned&mdash;" He could not find the words to finish the
  sentence.</p>

  <p>But his father finished it for him:</p>

  <p>"It is some drug. You have been bewitched."</p>

  <p>"I do not know. It is true that I feel ill. I wish that I had never come
  to Scotland. We understand none of it, you and I."</p>

  <p>His senses began to stray as the fever rose. He groaned that the air of
  the chamber was close, his teeth chattered. "She shuts me out, she laughs at
  me. Do you hear that? The servant goes in and I'm locked out. She has her
  secrets but they're not for me."</p>

  <p>"You've humbled yourself too much. You should have played the master."</p>

  <p>"Sometimes I hate her. She has made me pay too high for a few nights'
  lodging."</p>

  <p>He fell back upon his pillow, overcome by drowsiness; his heavy lids fell
  over his eyes, but the old man bent over him, pursuing him.</p>

  <p>"Come, you are married, you've sworn that to me! How many nights have you
  passed with her since you came back from Stirling? What was this
  marriage&mdash;a lie to save her reputation? Don't lie there," cried the Earl
  in a sudden fury of exasperation, "like a fool caught in a silly snare. She's
  your wife or she's a strumpet; either way we ought to catch her, if you'll
  leave off whining and raise your head."</p>

  <p>The young man did not answer. He was sunk in fever, and his face twitched
  as if bad dreams disturbed him.</p>

  <p>The Queen had completed the correspondence that her lover must not know
  of, and her mind, emptied of this preoccupation, turned to him again so when
  Mary Seaton reminded her that for a week the private door had been shut to
  him she said: "Open it to-night." After all, she loved him, and she thought
  of this love with delight, even with a little regret for her cruelty.</p>

  <p>She would make up to him for her neglect. She knew how to silence his
  reproaches, how to soothe his fears, disperse his jealousies. And yet,
  perhaps, she would say nothing at all, merely rest in his arms, a helpless
  woman in a man's embrace. He was stupid with words, and so often did not
  understand. Perhaps she would ask him to sing.</p>

  <p>Mary Seaton waited in the privy closet. He always came that way, a
  convenient entrance to the Queen's apartments, not particularly secret or
  mysterious but merely a servants' stairway which led to the disused chambers
  on the floor beneath and then by a subterranean passage to the garden and the
  church. There was access to this way through the burial ground; a shrubbery
  of trees cloaked the wall, and one might come and go there freely enough.</p>

  <p>Mary Seaton heard the step, heard the key turn in the lock and rose to
  greet the man whom for her conscience' sake she must regard as the Queen's
  husband and her King. She was glad that to-night she would not have to say:
  "You must go back, the Queen is ill," or "the Queen prays," or "the Queen
  fears that Mary Fleming may come in," or some such other excuse. No, to-night
  she could stand aside and leave the young man's way free to his wife's
  chamber.</p>

  <p>He did not, as was his custom, knock on the panel or scratch, but used the
  key which the Queen had given him. It turned in the lock.</p>

  <p>But when Mary Seaton saw who it was who entered the room she felt sick
  with fright for it was not the tall bridegroom who bent his shoulders in the
  narrow doorway but the stout form of his father, the Earl of Lennox, muffled
  to his chin, in the common clothes of a citizen. "Tell Her Grace," he said
  with a menacing frown, "that her husband is sick and cannot come
  to-night."</p>

  <p>He put aside the girl, and stared rudely across the closet into the
  bedchamber where the woman, who had suddenly ceased to smile, sat in the huge
  marriage bed.</p>

  <p>The Queen fetched Henry Stewart from his lodgings to Holyrood Palace. He
  was too ill to stand on his feet and chattered foolishly in the bouts of
  fever that left him hot and cold by turns, so she had him carried in a litter
  borne by some of his father's men. Two of her French doctors walked either
  side of him, and she followed on horseback with the four Maries and the
  French girls, and the two Italian boys.</p>

  <p>All was done openly by the light of day, and the people of Edinburgh
  crowded to windows and doors and paused in their occupations and hurried down
  side streets to stare and wonder and say foul things.</p>

  <p>The Queen had left off her usual mourning and was attired in an excess of
  that splendour which had always irritated the people from the moment she had
  landed at Leith. Her gown was of ruffled yellow silk with a great collar of
  lace falling open on her bosom and sewn and knotted with pearls. Two long
  tresses of chestnut hair fell to her waist; she wore her hat with a long,
  black feather over a coif in the Italian fashion. People asked each other
  where was her widow's black? Only on State occasions had she been without it
  during her reign. Were these fineries the signs of another marriage?</p>

  <p>The crowd could get no sight of the young man in the litter, for the
  curtains were drawn. But they knew who it was being borne to the palace and
  they peered and jostled to get a sight of his father's face as he rode
  behind. What could they read from that bloated, sullen countenance? Was this
  the triumph of the Lennox faction and of Papistry?</p>

  <p>Some of them began to hiss the stout old man who had sold the Queen for
  English gold when she was a child and brought the English over the Border to
  cut the throats of honest Scots. A few of the women started a murmur against
  the Queen herself. When she had first ridden through Edinburgh blessings had
  been called upon her, but there were none to-day.</p>

  <p>She looked about, wondering at this enmity, at these faces grim with
  hostility, these drab, diseased, and filthy creatures who challenged her with
  looks of hate.</p>

  <p>How strange and unfamiliar these people were to her! She stared at them
  with a fearless curiosity. She felt kindly towards them and wanted them to be
  happy and contented; when she had money she would fling it abroad with the
  utmost generosity or spend it on feasts for their benefit. She never
  interfered with their liberties nor their hideous religion and she had only
  asked a little toleration for herself. Why then did they dislike her so?
  There was not one of them, even when she looked directly into the crowd, who
  threw up his hat and shouted for the Queen.</p>

  <p>With her resolute and animated air she took pleasure in the fresh blue
  day, in the red-tiled houses, the eager faces of children pressed at the
  windows. The rancour of the crowd did not affect her at all, as she proceeded
  slowly towards Holyrood Abbey.</p>

  <p>The four Maries who followed her were alarmed by this atmosphere of
  dislike, and Mary Beaton edged her white horse close to that of the Queen and
  whispered with a smile on her lips as if she uttered some triviality:</p>

  <p>"Madame, take notice of the temper of the people. They say many evil
  words. Some of them look as if they held us in utter contempt."</p>

  <p>"These are rogues and churls," said the Queen, good-humouredly; "it
  matters not what such boors think or say. They are the disciples of John
  Knox, my Mary. See what joyless, crude creatures he makes of them!"</p>

  <p>They were approaching the forecourt of Holyrood House, and there the
  little escort of armed men had to put back the people who clustered round the
  gates. The Queen rode through the press with a good-natured smile. As she
  passed, one man, crippled and diseased, turned towards her filmed,
  half-blinded eyes and muttered an incoherent curse. The Queen made the sign
  of the Cross, a swift and stately gesture, as if she would avert a passing
  evil.</p>

  <p>Moray, Sir William Maitland, and the Earl of Morton stood at the great
  entrance of Holyrood as the Queen came up with the sick man in the
  litter.</p>

  <p>Moray lived in a house that adjoined the palace gardens. He had been there
  with his two advisers when he had beard that the Queen, in broad daylight,
  was bringing Lennox's son to her residence and he had come at once to
  intercept and to challenge her folly. He stood rigid, erect in his shabby
  black clothes with the brilliant Jewel of the Thistle rising a little on his
  broad breast, his underlip dragged down, eyes almost invisible between the
  puffy lids, the black, worn bonnet twisted in his hands.</p>

  <p>Maitland, elegant, fastidiously attired, bare-headed, stood beside him
  with an air that was at once humble and composed, watchful and alert. He had
  had little business to do lately for the Queen, who deliberately set him
  aside, using instead the services of David Rizzio, who now had nearly all her
  correspondence in his hands.</p>

  <p>Sir William Maitland bowed to the Queen. He admired her very much, for her
  gallantry, her kindly air, the warmth of her smile, for her courage in thus
  proclaiming before the whole of Edinburgh her reckless passion and her rash
  intentions.</p>

  <p>He looked at Mary Fleming, whom he was to marry in a few days; she had
  said that they would not marry until the Queen did so. No doubt that had all
  been arranged, for Mary Fleming had made no difficulty about her own wedding.
  He looked at her wondering what fate he was like to bring her in the
  future.</p>

  <p>He had had so little business to do of late that there had been more time
  to devote to her and he had got to know her better. Her great attraction for
  him lay in the fact that she was something like the Queen. Having lived with
  her for so long she had caught a little of her gestures, her intonation. She
  spoke French with the same pretty accent, did her hair in the same fashion.
  She read the same books, sang the same songs, had the same choice in colours
  and embroidery. For these things Sir William Maitland was glad to marry Mary
  Fleming.</p>

  <p>Behind him stood the Earl of Morton, who looked like a stout tradesman. He
  had red common features, a rough-cut scarlet beard, straggling, patchy hair.
  His attire was in the most exaggerated style of that puritanical simplicity
  affected by the followers of John Knox&mdash;black coat, breeches and hose,
  the high-crowned hat, white linen band and cuffs, soiled and crumpled. The
  man's eyes shone with a powerful intelligence. In his manners, in his
  conversation, in his private life, he was lewd. There was no crime of which
  he had not been accused, there was no treachery of which he was not capable,
  yet he was one of the godly, and the Protestants followed him anywhere.</p>

  <p>The Queen detested the man, and she shot him a cold glance as she
  dismounted and came slowly up the shallow steps. She wondered how Moray and
  Maitland could endure such a detestable creature in their close counsel.</p>

  <p>She did not salute her half-brother, or ask him into the palace, but
  stepped aside and appeared to be engrossed in the carrying of the sick man.
  She gave directions to the bearers and the physicians, and the litter was
  slowly and with difficulty borne up the steps and through the wide open door.
  She smiled at the four Maries and the French women and Lennox, and went into
  the shadows of Holyrood House. Then she smiled again directly at the two
  young Italians who, neat, graceful, with bent heads but shooting insolent
  glances of triumph out of their eyes at Moray and his advisers, followed her
  into the palace.</p>

  <p>There the Queen pulled off one of her gauntlets and put her bare hand on
  her half-brother's sleeve and laughed.</p>

  <p>"Why do you wait for me here and with such a scowl? How sad and despondent
  you look, sweet James! And Sir William! You must not overcast your nuptials
  with such downcast looks. Go within and talk to Mary Fleming."</p>

  <p>"I have had over much time of late, madame," replied the Secretary, "to
  talk to Mary Fleming. You have relieved me of so many duties that my leisure
  has been too long."</p>

  <p>He smiled as he spoke and there was no malice in his words, only, the
  Queen thought, rather a compassion and a gentle warning.</p>

  <p>She raised her brows and sighed. How little they understood, all three of
  them, that she had determined to go on and meet her destiny heedless of
  either prudence or fear.</p>

  <p>"Madame," whispered Moray, "this goes too far. How will you undo what you
  have done to-day in bringing Lennox's son before all Edinburgh to your
  palace?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, to my palace and to my chambers," replied the Queen smoothly. "He
  will lie next to me&mdash;there is but a corridor between&mdash;and I shall
  nurse him. He is my choice, James. Tell the council so, get their consent.
  Ay, and I would have yours, brother." She used this last word with pointed
  meaning.</p>

  <p>Morton opened his mouth showing his decaying teeth; his eyes glittered
  from one to the other of the two men. "Your Majesty's Grace means to marry
  Henry Stewart?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, fie, sir!" said the Queen, "that is no tone in which to question a
  gentlewoman of so tender an affair." She turned into the palace entrance as
  unconcerned as if they had been talking of trivial matters, and Moray
  followed her into the darkness of the porch.</p>

  <p>"If you make this marriage&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>She turned on him with a swiftness which reminded him of the pounce of a
  hawk on its prey, a clean swoop in mid-air.</p>

  <p>"Yes? If I make this marriage?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I'll split your kingdom for you!" he replied, goaded by her defiance.
  "I'll break your world into pieces about your feet."</p>

  <p>The Queen gazed at him intensely. Then she smiled slowly, breathing in an
  excited fashion as if his definite defiance pleased her.</p>

  <p>"Go and make your plans and I shall make mine," she said.</p>

  <p>He sank on to his knees, moved by custom, prudence, and sincere remorse
  into this instant expiation of his fury.</p>

  <p>"May God forgive me, may Your Grace forgive me! What I said was
  treason."</p>

  <p>"Treason that you long meditated," replied the Queen, still smiling, "and
  long have I known it."</p>

  <p>She made no attempt to raise him from his knees. She did not accept his
  immediate and profound contrition.</p>

  <p>"David," she called over her shoulder, and the proud Moray, as if he had
  been touched by a lash, sprang to his feet to see that the sly Italian with
  triumph in his very place, had been lurking in the shadows, unseen.</p>

  <p>"The rat! The filthy vermin!" thought Moray, furiously, very pace [sic],
  had been lurking in the shadows, unseen.</p>

  <p>The Queen smiled at David in a friendly understanding way. With humble
  reverence that was yet familiar, the Italian followed her into the palace,
  like a pampered and protected pet.</p>

  <p>Moray turned slowly to where his two advisers waited on the steps. Life to
  him was stale and arid. He was an ambitious man and his entire hopes, his
  greatness, hung in the balance of events which he judged to be immediate. He
  was an avaricious man with vast estates and huge fortunes which might be
  snatched from him on the next throw of the dice. He was a man who loved his
  country after his own fashion, and his country might, in his judgment, soon
  be cast into tumult and ruin.</p>

  <p>Yet it was neither his greatness nor his wealth nor his country that
  occupied him as he walked silently between his two friends, through the
  forecourt where the Lennox men gathered in groups stared, whispered, and
  nudged as much as they dare at the Queen's halt the enemy of the Earl, their
  master.</p>

  <p>Moray was considering a greater loss than that of any material
  thing&mdash;that of the Queen herself, the Queen smirched and tainted and
  perhaps cast down. Maitland knew his thoughts and echoed them:</p>

  <p>"If she marries that boy she is lost to us."</p>

  <p>His voice was more wistful than menacing, but Morton nodded.</p>

  <p>"She is lost to herself, to Scotland, to all," he said. He glanced towards
  the gates where the crowd still hung about, though now and then dispersed by
  the men-at-arms. They were talking of the Queen, those people. They could not
  get the Queen out of their minds, the strange things she did, the high ways
  she had, her vanity and her brightness, her rich fashions which made her
  appear like a creature of another sphere.</p>

  <p>They whispered of witchery and enchantments, there was not one of them who
  had not some queer tale to tell of warning raps at night, of hands on the
  shutter, a voice in the corner, the air full of devils. One who had come in
  from the hills had seen a troop of ghostly warriors sweep down a deserted
  glen; another a fairy horseman riding the waters of a lake; a third, going
  through the forest had stared up at a rustling to see the summer boughs
  pulled apart and the devil's face peering out, mumbling prophecies of woe.
  Satan, the prince of witches, was abroad and looking for sacrifices.</p>

  <p>They accused the Queen of cruelty. There were those there who could
  remember how heretics had been burnt on the day that Mary of Guise had
  married King James. There were those who had heard tales of what had happened
  in France when she had reigned there. Moray noted the people and their mood.
  He remarked, staring directly at Morton: "In anything I do I should have a
  large backing."</p>

  <p>Morton said: "There is nothing to be feared."</p>

  <p>But Maitland added: "There is no one to be feared but Bothwell and
  Huntly."</p>

  <p>"She does not," answered Moray, very bitterly, "forgive me that. She would
  have liked Bothwell recalled, I think I can guess why. To cast him in my
  face, perhaps, if she needs another protector besides that boy. Bothwell did
  not come to answer his challenge, and I&mdash;" Moray gave one of his rare
  laughs which transformed his features into a slightly ferocious expression
  and gave his countenance a wolf-like cast.</p>

  <p>Maitland smiled also, for he knew that Bothwell had not come to Edinburgh
  because Moray had got together six thousand men to meet him. Moray checked
  his laugh instantly and put his finger on his lips.</p>

  <p>"We know where we are, and in a little while we shall know how to act. We
  might very well sit aside and take our ease and rest in quietness. We
  busybodies waste our time. What impels us to go on to make a rope of
  sand?"</p>

  <p>The Queen sat by Henry Stewart's bed. The physicians had done all they
  could for him with their curious devices; there was nothing but to let the
  ebb and flow of the fever take its course.</p>

  <p>In uncertainty and distress, Lennox waited in the outer chamber. He had
  had sour news from England&mdash;his wife, Margaret Lennox, of Tudor blood,
  had been thrown into prison by Elizabeth because her husband and son had
  refused to return from Edinburgh. Lennox felt that he had lost the favour of
  the Queen of England, which might be worth a great deal more to him than the
  favour of the Queen of Scots, yet he believed he had her securely when he had
  used his son's key and entered her private apartment and found her waiting
  for a lover. Surely she would not dare defy him after that, for he knew too
  much.</p>

  <p>When he had challenged her to her face with the marriage at Stirling she
  had not denied it. When he had told her that for her own reputation and
  safety she had better have a public marriage she had not denied that
  either.</p>

  <p>With her gallant, gay, and good-humoured air she had come down to his
  house and fetched his son away and installed him at Holyrood as if he were
  the King: but still Lennox was not satisfied. The woman was so difficult to
  reach, so much of what she did was incredible. Then he greatly misliked,
  distrusted and feared the young Italian who seemed ever at her elbow with his
  excuses of letters or lutes or books and his whispered advice.</p>

  <p>Lennox knew that he had no friends in Scotland but his own men, that the
  feeling against him was gathering daily, stirred up by his great enemy,
  Moray, and that man's two advisers, Morton and Maitland. Most of the other
  Lords were against him too, treating him as a Papist and a pretender to the
  Crown. His money was nearly all spent, and what had he to rely on except this
  boy, who had fallen sick on his hands?</p>

  <p>He did not believe in the Queen's serenity. He thought she must, perforce,
  appear much easier than she was, and in this he was right.</p>

  <p>The Queen was true to her long training, begun when she was a child and
  had first stepped into France, and she was true to her courage, which she had
  inherited from many kings and from the fearless House of Guise. But in her
  mind and soul she was much troubled, as she sat by the side of the pale
  youth, and her thoughts were uneasy.</p>

  <p>She had another reason than compassion for nursing him herself. She did
  not know what secrets of hers he might, unwary, mutter in his delirium;
  already she had learnt from his mumbled words, now whispered into his pillow,
  now half-shouted as he started up in his bed, the reason of his disorder.</p>

  <p>One night, when he had come up the secret way through the tower to her
  apartments, the way that she had shown him, to the door to which she had
  given him the key, he had found it bolted and heard Mary Seaton's voice
  telling him once more that the Queen would not see him, that the Queen was
  weary and slept. Then he had gone away, not even caring to find his usual
  companions, Antony Standens, nor seeking his chamber-page, John Taylor, but
  going right away by himself down to a tavern in the Canongate, and there he
  had drank and drank of any wine or spirit they could give him. Finally, when
  the reckoning came, he found he had no money in his pocket, and had left
  behind him his cloak in payment.</p>

  <p>After that, with his brain on fire and his blood overheated, with all his
  mind and senses a whirl of wretchedness and desire, he had turned back to
  Holyrood once more, swearing that this time she must let him in. But when he
  had reached the garden his strength had all gone and he had fallen down under
  one of the trees that grew by the ruined part of the great church which had
  been stripped and half destroyed in the last invasion of the English. And
  there he had lain through a long cloudy night with the rain beating on his
  thin silk clothes, without cloak or hat, weeping and cursing until, when the
  dawn came, he was light-headed and half delirious and had only the sense left
  to drag himself back to his father's lodgings.</p>

  <p>The Queen watched him and struggled with her own feelings. Would she be
  relieved or sorry if he died from this fit of fever? If he were dead he would
  be gone, like a song that has been sung, a poem that has been read, a flower
  that has been plucked, like a rainbow on a summer day.</p>

  <p>She mused over that. Never had she had such a strong fancy for any man,
  but this was so pitiful and transient that it seemed only to exist when he
  actually held her in his arms, caressed her, and pressed his lips to her
  neck, or gazed down into her eyes or muttered in clumsy fashion rash
  endearments.</p>

  <p>Yes, in those moments, he had meant much to her. She had felt exalted and
  enthusiastic, ready to set him up as her hero and champion and to dare the
  world by his side. But now, as he lay mumbling in the fever, she thought of
  all the cares and troubles involved in this intimacy and she almost wished
  that he might, without further pain or bother, die and leave her free.</p>

  <p>Poor youth I She slowly waved to and fro a fan of white feathers to keep
  the air stirring round his hot forehead. She glanced approvingly at his great
  length in the bed, at the width of his shoulders, at the grace, even in this
  distress, of his movements, at the tarnished beauty of his features and
  hands. In his armour, now, on a great war-nor horse, would he not make a
  figure to fright the sour Scots?</p>

  <p>She laughed, and though the sound was very gentle it seemed to rouse him.
  He sat up suddenly, his shirt falling open on his bare chest that glistened
  with sweat. She looked at him curiously, waiting for him to speak, then she
  saw that he did not know she was there.</p>

  <p>"I cannot write French," he said rapidly, "they never taught me that. I do
  not know how to compose a letter&mdash;only a few words, you understand, not
  a letter like that. I tell you I should not dare; this is not a common girl
  but a great princess. Not that way, that is to my own room. There was a
  filthy old witch made me an ugly prophecy&mdash;" he began to fumble at his
  bare throat. "Deliver us from evil," he whispered, "deliver us from evil,
  from violent fairies and strutting apes, from cankers that need harsh
  plasters."</p>

  <p>The Queen leant between the curtains of the bed.</p>

  <p>"Henry," she whispered in an insinuating tone, "look! look at me. I am
  here, waiting on you. You are in the palace, you are in my apartment!"</p>

  <p>He stared at her and a slow look of comprehension came into his eyes. He
  sighed, and fell back on the pillows and she leant over him, pursuing a
  fragment of truth.</p>

  <p>"Tell me&mdash;you did not write that French letter at Stirling?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head stupidly.</p>

  <p>"Who brought you there that night?"</p>

  <p>His eyes, hot and confused stared at her with a pathetic sullenness, with
  the look of a child caught in wrongdoing and unrepentant.</p>

  <p>"Do you understand me, Henry? Who was it?"</p>

  <p>But he would not answer, yet as she breathed "The Italian!" he closed his
  eyes and she was answered. He had come to her, then, not on a surge of
  passion, but because he was slightly drunk and a pimp had been there to guide
  his steps.</p>

  <p>She stood silent, holding the edges of the curtains. She had had him
  placed for her own whim satisfying she knew not what delicate sense of
  mockery, in her great bed trimmed with gold and silver and lined with crimson
  watered silk, that had been set up in her bed-chamber in Stirling. He began
  to shiver, and she pulled over him the coverlet on which were designed the
  lions and thistles of Scotland. "Oh, well," she said, "oh, well!"</p>

  <p>He opened his eyes slowly and with difficulty, for his lids were heavy,
  and looked at her with a suspicious discontent. In her glittering, elaborate
  gown she stood between the rift in the curtains; behind her he could see the
  room bright with summer sunshine and gleaming furniture.</p>

  <p>He sat up suddenly, his delusions vanishing, and snatched at her hand.</p>

  <p>"When will you marry me?" he asked. "Publicly! You will not leave me
  again, you will not play with me again?"</p>

  <p>"You are disabled by sickness," she soothed him. "When you are well, only,
  be quiet, do not talk any more."</p>

  <p>She took him unawares with her tenderness; his apprehensive defiance died
  away. He drew her hand under his hot cheek and slept, the clothes all awry
  about him, like the coverings of a child who tosses in dreams.</p>

  <p>The Queen, after a little while, pulled her hand away, passed into her
  privy closet and sent one of the French girls for David Rizzio.</p>

  <p>The Queen closed the book she had been reading to compose her thoughts.
  She liked to read ancient tales as well as of the intricacies of modern love.
  She was at home with the actions of the Immortals and with the petty spites
  and furies of common folk. Lampoons, ballads, pamphlets, lay on her desk.
  With eyes unflinching, with smooth smile undisturbed, she had read the lewd
  and violent abuse circulated secretly about her among her people, which
  Moray's agents gathered for her and diligently sent for her inspection. She
  knew her half-brother's reason in this service&mdash;he wished to undermine
  her confidence, to shake her self-reliance and cause her to put herself more
  completely into his hands.</p>

  <p>When David Rizzio entered she set her handsome books on top of the ballads
  coarsely printed on cheap paper.</p>

  <p>Urbane and smooth, with his air of tender solicitude and deep reverence,
  the young Italian entered the room. He now spent many hours of the week alone
  with the Queen and was quite dizzy with his good fortune. He could scarcely
  believe that such marvellous luck had happened to him who had come to
  Edinburgh so poor, almost without shoes to his feet or clothes to his back.
  Sometimes in the night he would wake Giuseppe just to engage him in
  conversation about the extraordinary chance that had occurred to them, about
  the great opportunities before them. The two youths would lie in the dark and
  whisper excitedly about their golden prospects. The Queen quite understood
  his amazement, and it amused her&mdash;she was a little astonished herself at
  the rapid rise of this new favourite. She could understand the scandal and
  comments it had caused though she was indifferent as to that. They had
  isolated her; they had made her send back most of the French people whom she
  had brought with her from Paris. They had done all they could to thwart her,
  to frustrate her desires, even to humiliate and to circumscribe her liberty:
  she had to find a friend and adviser where she could.</p>

  <p>The Italian was so pliant, so easy, understood her without the least
  difficulty. He had just the knowledge, the adroitness that she required and
  he served her with exactly that reverent, exaggerated homage to which she had
  been used in everyone who came near her in the Court of France. Not one among
  the Scots gentlemen, not one, had touched that delicate note, the relation
  between a queen and her subject to which this Queen had been bred. It was a
  mingling of a profound homage that set her apart as a goddess to be adored,
  and a familiarity that recognized her as a woman to be loved.</p>

  <p>She set her elbow on the bureau, put her chin in her hand and laughed. Her
  situation was difficult, perhaps, almost desperate, but nothing could quench
  her zest in life.</p>

  <p>"David," she said, "I am pledged to marry Henry Stewart. His father
  presses me. Tell me what you think of that business."</p>

  <p>The Italian replied very low in his pleasing voice and in his own
  language, with which she was fairly familiar.</p>

  <p>"The Queen must have everything she wishes, the Queen must do as she
  wants."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes, that's delicious to hear, but I fear it is as brittle as a
  compliment out of a poem, but at least, the Queen will be the Queen. Tell me,
  you have watched, you have listened. What do you think of this marriage?"</p>

  <p>The Italian closed his eyes for a second and drew a deep breath to steady
  himself&mdash;it seemed to him so incredible that he of all the men in the
  great city should be here closeted with the Queen and giving her advice. He
  replied, steadily, in French:</p>

  <p>"I cannot see what can suit the Queen's gracious plans better than the
  marriage with the Lord Darnley. He is a member of the true Faith and as such
  will be acceptable to the Pope. A marriage with a Roman Catholic would
  encourage Your Majesty's co-religionists in England, in Scotland, and on the
  Continent. It would be as a rallying-point for a strong movement to throw off
  these damned heretics who have dug their claws so firmly into Your Majesty's
  fair lands. If Your Majesty married to please the Queen of England it would
  be to a heretic and you would, on that count, get no help from His Holiness
  nor Their Majesties of France or Spain.</p>

  <p>"If you marry a foreign prince there will be great difficulties and also
  delays. This gentleman is a prince, a near pretender to the throne. By
  marrying him you end that claim and that of his father. Besides," added the
  Italian, suavely, yet with a short sigh, "he is young and very splendid, he
  is noticed everywhere he goes and he would appear magnificent as a king."</p>

  <p>"For beauty," replied the Queen carelessly, "I have never seen one like
  him. But he is morose and sullen, violent and insolent, and his manners are
  detestable."</p>

  <p>David Rizzio put back the sweep of bronze-coloured hair with a nervous
  hand.</p>

  <p>"He is a boy, and, madame, you can make of him what you will. You torment
  him until he becomes half-crazed, but if you were to soothe him&mdash;bears
  will eat out of a fair hand that holds sugar, madame."</p>

  <p>He looked at the Queen gravely as he stood before her, with even more than
  his wonted reverence.</p>

  <p>"Besides," he added, very softly and respectfully, "there is really
  nothing else that Your Majesty can do." The Queen did not reply, and the
  Italian continued: "After his sickness, when his father found the key in his
  pocket&mdash;it does not matter how discreet one is, things get about. If
  Your Majesty were to marry him publicly nothing could be said."</p>

  <p>"All has been said," replied the Queen, directly. "That he is the lover, I
  am the wanton, you are the go-between, only they use coarser terms than that,
  I think, David. Never mind, it is perhaps foolish to have an open scandal.
  Besides," she added, with an impetuous change of manner, "I love him. Do I
  not love him, David?"</p>

  <p>The Italian bowed low, so low that she could not see his face.</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty knows."</p>

  <p>With a quizzical and loving smile the Queen stared down at him and noticed
  the little pin with the white topaz head in his collar that Mary Seaton had
  put into the bandage on his arm the day that he had caught Florestan from the
  altar.</p>

  <p>"I have told my brother and I have told the council," she said. "The
  marriage will go through."</p>

  <p>"And shall I remain Your Majesty's secretary?"</p>

  <p>There was a note of appeal in his low voice. She was flattered to think
  how much a goddess she was to this graceful, clever youth. He had nothing
  beyond her favour, nothing; he was literally her creature whom she had raised
  from obscurity to a shining brightness.</p>

  <p>"Your place is safe, David."</p>

  <p>At that his happiness made him radiant and with a grace that seemed to
  bridge the difference between them and yet with a humility that seemed to
  remember it, he offered her a gift.</p>

  <p>It was a tortoise composed of small clusters of rubies with head and neck
  worked in gold. He told her that it had belonged to his mother and that he
  had always kept it even through his neediest years. He begged her, his
  gracious Queen, who had given him so many noble gifts, to accept this from
  him, the most unworthy of her servants.</p>

  <p>The Queen liked the trifle and liked the manner of the giving. It did not
  either displease her that he had once been of sufficient rank to wear such
  jewels. She liked to think that his origin was mysterious, perhaps grand.
  Maybe he was some princely bastard of as good blood as Moray.</p>

  <p>She gave him her hand to kiss while she fondled the tortoise between the
  fingers he pressed to his lips.</p>

  <p>He had lied about the gem; he had obtained it from a Lombard money-lender
  and money-changer in the Nether-bow, the man to whom he had pledged the
  Queen's white topaz which he had since redeemed and now wore as if he had
  never parted with it. It had taken him almost all the money that he was able
  to spare from the Queen's generosity, to purchase the jewel. And that had
  been only on account. The merchant had allowed him to have an ornament of
  such considerable value because it was well known that he was so high in the
  Queen's favour and would soon be able to pay the complete value of the
  gift.</p>

  <p>She allowed him to kiss her fingers and her wrist, and he became quite
  intoxicated, and feeling the impossibility of any longer keeping his head, he
  left her abruptly with an emotion that did not displease the Queen. As he
  left she said lightly, "So it was you who planned it at Stirling? I might
  have known that he was too stupid."</p>

  <p>The Scotch Council debated with hostile gravity the question of the Lennox
  marriage. The English Council passed a resolution declaring such an alliance
  contrary to English interests. Elizabeth sent Sir Nicholas Throckmorton to
  Edinburgh to warn the Queen not to make this marriage. Moray refused his
  formal consent. But, when Henry Stewart recovered from his fever, he and the
  Queen were wedded in Holyrood Chapel with full Roman Catholic rites.</p>

  <p>The Queen came to her wedding in a full suit of mourning, hood and cloak
  and gown. She was serene and a little distracted as if for the second time
  she gave away her hand and her crown with a certain indifference. She entered
  the chapel between Lennox, alert, anxious, scarcely daring to be triumphant,
  and Atholl. Her household, such as were Roman Catholics, followed.</p>

  <p>The bridegroom, it was noted, seemed greatly troubled. He had been early
  in the chapel and prayed much at the altar before the coming of the Queen,
  and, what was strange for one who had been so eager to show splendour, he was
  plainly dressed in a dark satin without jewels.</p>

  <p>But when he saw the Queen, he came forward as if about to talk to her,
  eagerly, as if he had something on his mind to declare to her before them all
  at this solemn moment. His father twitched him by the sleeve and gave him a
  look that reminded him of the formalities of the occasion. And at that he
  went quietly back to his place in front of the altar and knelt with the Queen
  on the stiff, embroidered cushions, and when the moment came wedded her with
  three rings, one of which was a circlet of gold with a motto inside and out,
  another was a rich diamond, and the third the red ring he had taken from her
  breast that night at Stirling Castle when David Rizzio had brought him to her
  door.</p>

  <p>When the ceremony was over, those who stood about the Queen were permitted
  to take out the pins of her mourning attire so that the veils of black lawn
  crêpe which Mary Beaton and Mary Seaton had carefully pinned up into the
  likeness of a gown, fell on the chapel floor, a sable cloud, and the Queen
  stepped out in a robe of glittering silk the colour of blue ice, with all her
  French diamonds laid about her breast and shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I hope," she said, "I may never have to wear that sad raiment again."</p>

  <p>She looked at her husband graciously, but his answering glance was
  questioning and troubled.</p>

  <p>Who had attended these nuptials to which all had been summoned?</p>

  <p>Moray was not there, nor Maitland, nor Morton, nor any of their
  hangers-on, and not many other great Scottish names. Only a few, and those
  Lennox men.</p>

  <p>As they came into the ante-chamber, someone cried, "God save the King!"
  but there was only one cap raised and only one answering shout. The gesture
  and the voice came from old Lennox who, in embarrassed defiance, echoed: "God
  save His Majesty!"</p>

  <p>The banquet to which so few had come and which had been so dull was over.
  The bride and groom were in the apartments of the Queen.</p>

  <p>When she had first come to Scotland she had chosen for her own rooms those
  in the tower built by her grandfather and completed by her father. She had
  assigned the lower floor in this handsome quarter to her husband, keeping
  only the upper portion for herself, and he was as splendidly housed as the
  Queen with audience chamber, bedrooms, closets in the turret, and a private
  oratory. The staircase with which he was already familiar, for it had been
  his means of private access to the Queen, led from the garden to his
  apartments and by the newel stair in the wall from his chambers to her
  apartment.</p>

  <p>There had been nothing niggardly in the manner with which the Queen had
  prepared for the reception of the husband who brought her nothing. Italian
  tapestries of playing boys and sporting animals, a dais, embroidered velvet
  chairs of state, pictures, vessels of crystal and agate, mirrors and painted
  coffers, lavishly furnished the chamber to which Mary carelessly gave him the
  key in a casket of silver filigree.</p>

  <p>She had appointed for him a retinue as large as her own&mdash;secretaries,
  pages, gentlemen, ushers, an escort of armed soldiers. She named him King,
  promised him the Crown Matrimonial, said his name should come first in al!
  writings. And to this lavishness she added a further generosity&mdash;suits
  of blued Greenwich armour, suits of damascened Genoa armour, daggers, swords,
  robes of velvet and sable, horses, some English hawks and hounds.</p>

  <p>"What can I give you in return, madame?"</p>

  <p>His demeanour did not seem like that of one woo had gained a throne and a
  queen.</p>

  <p>"You must be my husband."</p>

  <p>"Nay, I have been that for several weeks now, and little comfort has it
  brought either of us."</p>

  <p>"But you are my husband now before everyone."</p>

  <p>She put her arm through his and drew him into the audience chamber into
  which the newel stairway from his room ascended.</p>

  <p>This was a very bright and pleasant apartment. On the ceiling under which
  they walked were the new decorations set up on the occasion of her first
  marriage where all the insignia of the Houses of Lorraine and Valois, the
  alerions and the lilies, the dolphins and the royal initials were cunningly
  interlaced on lozenges with the Royal Arms of Scotland.</p>

  <p>The room was furnished with great luxury; though the country might be poor
  the Queen was rich enough to indulge personal splendour. Her jointure as
  Dowager-Queen of France sufficed to keep her with a brilliance that had no
  parallel in Scotland.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you are my husband now," she exclaimed with a proud and excited air,
  "and you must help me."</p>

  <p>"To what?" he asked apprehensively. He had neither the mind nor the
  capacity for this position; he did not want to be the master of this
  brilliant, brittle creature whom he so distrusted. Ambition, wounded pride,
  his father's goading, had urged him on to become the husband of this
  enchanting and perilous Queen, and now he stood abashed, feeling buffeted by
  the dark wings of chance.</p>

  <p>She paused before the oratory, her private praying place. Setting the door
  wide she stared in at the painted alabaster altar and white alabaster steps,
  the holy winged pictures, the gilt rails and the candles. Tears came to her
  eyes, brought there by childhood memories, by nostalgia and loneliness. She
  turned and clung with a passion he could not read to the tall youth.</p>

  <p>"We must triumph. Don't you see, my brother and his friends, Morton,
  Maitland, Knox, and all the Calvinists&mdash;we must set them down, you and
  I."</p>

  <p>She laughed, coaxing and caressing him, took his arm again and paced with
  him the length of the regal audience chamber.</p>

  <p>"I have never been a queen yet, and you must make me one now."</p>

  <p>"I've no head for policies or intrigue, Mary. I hardly understand what any
  of these people would be at. It is true that your brother is puffed up and
  greedy, but would it not be better to let him rule&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She interrupted swiftly.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that he will wish to continue to rule while you are there?
  No! You have lost me my brother, Harry, and you must take his place. The
  place of all of them! Do you hear, do you understand?"</p>

  <p>Her swift eagerness baffled him.</p>

  <p>"If you make me King," he replied slowly, "I suppose I shall know what to
  do with that title."</p>

  <p>"If there is any trouble, any resistance, if they stir up revolts we will
  arm and chase them from place to place until we have run them out of the
  kingdom."</p>

  <p>Such violent and resolute ideas confused him. He frowned, looking at her
  steadily, trying to understand her, wondering why she had chosen him and in
  what lay her transient enchantment for him. There were hours, even days, when
  he would not think of her at all, and there were moments when he wished he
  had not met her.</p>

  <p>She was a paragon and his wife; he tried to solace himself with these
  thoughts. His wife&mdash;the Queen&mdash;and he the King, the master of all
  that snarling troop of Puritans. She set him over Moray! He flushed,
  half-ashamed, half-pleased at this pre-eminence.</p>

  <p>She led him to the dais at the end of the room which was now in the
  shadows of the gathering twilight, and the gold of the crown on the seat
  showed clearly. She set him there in the great chair with arms, persuading
  him into it with kisses, and when he was settled, half-reluctant,
  half-smiling in that high place, she stepped back and stared at him as so
  many had stared at her seated there in elegant royalty.</p>

  <p>Outwardly her choice did not disappoint her, for the man was splendid.
  Whom else could she have chosen in all Europe who would have so gallantly
  filled a throne? For physique and grace there could be none who was his
  equal. Her passion for him and the dreams that passion inspired, revived, as
  she sat on the steps of the throne, looking up at him.</p>

  <p>She was the Queen and had created a King. Together they would rule. Would
  he be difficult, grow restive, would she find him tiresome to manage? These
  little doubts pricked at her exalted mood. Already she, who knew the temper
  of her people better than he could, or else had a sharper understanding, had
  to warn him of his sudden bursts of rage against his inferiors, his curtness
  and insolence to his equals, all rising from his untrained youth and his
  wretched uncertainty as to his position together with his consciousness that
  he had not one true friend in Scotland.</p>

  <p>She thought to tell him of this now, but looking up and seeing him there
  enthroned on the dais with the lions and the Cross of St. Andrew and all the
  imposing insignia of her splendours about him, and seeing him staring down at
  her with love in his eyes, she only saw again that lover of the night at
  Stirling and could not broach serious matters.</p>

  <p>She let him take her up, which he did eagerly, and place her on the throne
  beside him&mdash;there was room enough for two. She slipped her arms round
  his neck and had a sense of gathering to her all his strength and courage, so
  that she felt impregnable against the world. Beauty is a dower of itself, she
  thought; he is like a god, splendour of purple, gold, diamond ...</p>

  <p>The summer twilight took on a soft golden quality making strange and
  unfamiliar to her eyes the shapes of the room. Through the open door she saw
  the small oratory, glittering in the light of the holy red lamp. She thought
  of the large Abbey church ruined, stripped, and profaned near the
  burial-place of her forefathers and she resolved that soon she and her new
  lord would rebuild it and furnish in great splendour.</p>

  <p>"Shall we not be happy?" she whispered, defiantly. "Say we shall be
  happy."</p>

  <p>But he did not give her the reassurances she confidently expected, and
  what he did say was quite astonishing to her.</p>

  <p>"You should see less now of the Italian. He becomes very pert and
  everybody detests him."</p>

  <p>Her spontaneous laughter sounded in the room. Did he not know that this
  was exactly what was said of him?</p>

  <p>"You found David useful once," she reminded him, with her head on his
  breast.</p>

  <p>He frowned, not caring to hear that. Deep in his heart he held uneasily
  and sincerely the opinion of her expressed by the common people in the
  streets&mdash;scorn for her easy, shameless lightness. Although it had been a
  rich and splendid experience to possess her he never thought of those stolen
  delights without hearing in his ears the sneers of the gutter-urchins behind
  her coach, the shrill mockery of housewives standing arms akimbo in their
  doorways, the stolid looks of Puritans who saw her go by and made no mark of
  respect. But she, even now when she was his wife sitting on the throne with
  him with her arms round his neck, must remind him of Stirling and David the
  go-between. He said with sullen force:</p>

  <p>"Send the scoundrel back to Italy. Stuff his pockets with gold and send
  him away."</p>

  <p>"Because we do not need him now?" she smiled. "Is this your gratitude? And
  why is he 'scoundrel'? It was you who first promoted him and now he has
  served his term&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Let him go, I say."</p>

  <p>She began to kiss him passionately.</p>

  <p>"Ah, let him go to-night, at least. Is not the world shut out, all the
  doors are locked, there is no one here, not even Mary Seaton!" She pressed
  close on him. "To-night you do not need to stand cold on a secret stair
  against a bolted door, my love."</p>

  <p>The Queen woke: her bridal night was over. She had not drawn the curtains
  last night because she liked the moonbeams in the room and now the sun shone
  in clearly, She looked at the man sleeping heavily beside her, and she
  sighed, thinking of all the days to come.</p>

  <p>She pulled the curtains from the bed and stared at him keenly, wondering
  if he would serve her purpose, if she would weary of him. She had never
  expected to be happy with any man, but she might find one who would know the
  game she played and appreciate her and give her a fair deal, who could be gay
  and good-humoured over it all.</p>

  <p>She passed her fine hand curiously over his beautiful fair hair on the
  pillow, she marked his light lashes like a line of gilding on his flushed
  face, the down on his unshaven lip and cheeks. How young he was, only a boy!
  But powerful as a lion, strong as a giant and quite fearless, she
  believed.</p>

  <p>Could she set this golden Colossus up, striding over Scotland, his feet on
  the necks of her vassals? Perhaps she might, with the help of David Rizzio.
  She smiled to herself as she recalled her lord, huge and elegant, on the dais
  last night, and her smile deepened as she recalled the hours that had
  followed. He loved her. He loved her. She would be able to do what she would
  with him.</p>

  <p>It was still very early when the Queen went warily from her room where her
  husband lay asleep. She dressed and went into the audience chamber where the
  empty throne stood under the ceiling painted with the insignia of three noble
  Houses and the initials of her dead husband and his father.</p>

  <p>She went into the little oratory where it was cold and solitary and the
  red lamp still burned above the painted alabaster. And there she knelt on the
  cold white stone and became absorbed in a sense of security and Divine
  guidance, while outside the city woke to angry comments on the Queen, on her
  rash and foolish behaviour, on her sudden and reckless marriage.</p>

  <p class="quote"><i>"You have heard what the Devil can do of himself: now you
  shall hear what he can perform by his instruments, who are many times worse
  (if it be possible) than he himself, and, to satisfy their revenge and lust,

  Junior.</small></span></p><br>

  <p class="first">THERE were hurried, furtive movements in the capital whist
  gradually spread all over Scotland so that the whole land and even the
  islands seemed alert with fear and suspicion.</p>

  <p>The Queen was married, and to a boy who was unpopular with everyone. She
  had a foreign favourite who had been a groom. Every lord gathered round him
  his clansmen and armed, restless and impatient in holds and castles, cities
  and villages&mdash;waiting. All looked to Lord Moray, who had ruled them to
  their liking, to give a signal, but he, enclosed in his Edinburgh house, made
  no sign.</p>

  <p>The Queen's half-brother had suffered so much from the Queen's marriage
  that it seemed to him as if he had been through a long and exhausting illness
  that had left him enfeebled. He had been so absorbed by his own thoughts and
  anguish that he had hardly heard, although he had appeared to listen, the
  advice of his followers and counsellors. He had scarcely noticed that
  Maitland had said nothing hut smiled and had gone his way with his young
  wife, who was a little like the Queen.</p>

  <p>They were both of them retired from affairs. The Queen never sent for them
  nor wrote to them, and though they still nominally held their offices they
  had become nonentities where once they had been all-powerful. Like a delicate
  destruction, fear of the idolatrous Queen lay on the land.</p>

  <p>Lord Moray went to Holyrood and begged an audience of the Queen's husband.
  He was received at once in the King's audience chamber which was directly
  beneath that of the Queen in the Tower of James N. Moray thought at one time
  that he would have never come to this, asking what seemed a favour, offering
  what seemed friendship to one so despised and detested. But his inner
  resolution had overcome this squeamishness and it was quite serenely that he
  faced the young man who had completely reversed his policies, overthrown his
  power, and taken from him the dearest thing he had under Heaven. He even
  looked at him with a certain compassion, for he saw with that clarity that
  suffering sometimes gives to perception, that the boy was not happy.</p>

  <p>Moray always spoke little and chose his words well, and he came directly
  to the matter of his visit, which he could see had astonished the King.</p>

  <p>"I, sir, thinking well of our circumstances and of the state of this
  kingdom, have come to offer you a pact. Will you, since you are master, allow
  me to serve Scotland in my old way?"</p>

  <p>The King was not immediately equal to this calculated candour. He could
  neither grasp the spirit nor thoroughly understand the words of this offer.
  He stammered and glanced uneasily from side to side. Moray proceeded slowly,
  precisely, to explain himself.</p>

  <p>Would he, King Henry, accept his, Lord Moray's services? Would he deal
  with him in a spirit of frankness and loyalty, accepting a certain amount of
  toleration for the Papists, but keeping the English Alliance and the
  supremacy of the Puritans? Would he be guided by the experience, the
  knowledge of the older man, would he retain the services of Maitland and
  Morton, two men so different and each in his way, perhaps, unacceptable to
  the King, but indispensable to Scotland?</p>

  <p>Moray said Scotland again and again, but when he used that word he meant
  the Queen.</p>

  <p>Henry Stewart listened, at last understood, and had an impulse of
  gratitude and desire to accept. He was very glad to be King, but he had no
  desire for the burdens of government. Nothing would induce him to go to the
  councils or interest himself in political affairs, and he reflected that if
  he could get some one like Moray to do all these matters for him and leave
  him the credit it would be just as well. But he checked these impulses. He
  reminded himself that he must not trust anyone; least of all must he trust
  Moray, who had always been his enemy and no doubt now hated him keenly.</p>

  <p>Then, Moray was a heretic, and he had pledged himself to the Queen to
  support her in restoring the Roman Catholics, and he was known to be a
  friend, perhaps on the payroll, of the English Queen and Henry was pledged
  against England. With his naturally candid mind poisoned by these
  reflections, he stood sullenly, his hands thrust on the hip of his doublet,
  and stared at the ground, so that Moray's anger rose at the ungraciousness of
  one whom he had condescended to flatter.</p>

  <p>"Sir, I am obliged to you," said Henry Stewart at last, in that slurred
  voice and with that English accent that the Scots had found so exasperating,
  "but it seems to me if I am a king I must rule for myself."</p>

  <p>Nothing could have been more absurd than these ill-chosen words. Moray
  gave his ugly smile; the young King saw it and flushed miserably.</p>

  <p>"I am led by none," he cried; "I am master of my house, I suppose? I need
  no counsellors nor advisers!" Encouraging himself with bold words, for the
  older man secretly overawed him, he bragged: "Your discontents are well
  known, Lord Moray. Look to it that they do not border on treason."</p>

  <p>"Treason to whom?" asked Moray softly. "There is no man whom I acknowledge
  as King."</p>

  <p>"I speak for the Queen&mdash;she will not be ruled."</p>

  <p>"By any save yourself, I suppose, sir," added Moray suavely. "Well, I see
  how matters stand. I thought we might come to some understanding. Before
  God," he added with a fervency that caused the youth to start, "I had but one
  desire in my mind when I came here and that was to save the Queen."</p>

  <p>"To save the Queen? From what?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you know," said Moray, moving towards the door. "Indeed, sir, it
  is hardly a matter that you or I can put into words. If you had accepted of
  my friendship and I had stayed, I might have done it."</p>

  <p>"If you had stayed, Lord Moray? Do you mean to leave Edinburgh?"</p>

  <p>"I can scarcely hang at your doors to be discarded like a lackey whose
  term of service is past," said Moray smiling with the easiness of one too
  great to take offence. "Sir, you will not take my advice and yet you will
  find that none other will counsel you so surely."</p>

  <p>Bewildered, distracted, changing from this emotion to that from hour to
  hour, the unhappy young man exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Lord Moray, tell me what I am to do, for indeed I often do not
  know myself!"</p>

  <p>Moray looked away so that the other might not be embarrassed by this
  confession of weakness.</p>

  <p>"What can I tell you, sir? You must take me in all or in nothing. I'll
  tell you this&mdash;look out for the Italian. You call yourself the King, at
  least you are the Queen's husband&mdash;if you have any manhood left remove
  the Italian."</p>

  <p>Henry Stewart turned away peevishly and stood rigid against the wall, his
  face bent against the tapestry of unicorns and playing boys which his weight
  dragged tight above his bright hair; his broad shoulders heaved slightly,
  there was something uncouth in his shape, distorted by the fashionable padded
  garments. Gazing at this unspeakable misery, Moray felt healed. His own
  sickening jealousy which afflicted him with physical nausea disappeared. "So
  that's it! I can meddle with him no more."</p>

  <p>The King's bastard took his leave and softly descended the newel stairway
  that he had often run up in his father's time when he was a child with lesson
  books under his arm. He walked across the park where all the trees were
  yellow, and he thought of the hare that he had seen there, peering through
  the mist. How inexplicable was the evil in one who seemed the quintessence of
  beauty!</p>

  <p>In his house Morton was awaiting him, sitting stiffly, his podgy hands on
  his black-clad knees, his worn doublet split at the seams, unbuttoned over
  his bulging stomach because of the heat.</p>

  <p>Moray looked at the man keenly. He found comfort in knowing that such
  instruments were ready to his hand.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing to be done with the boy, nothing. He'll help you to get
  rid of the Italian&mdash;that must be done quite soon, unless&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Morton nodded, and sniggered one word with relish: "Cuckold, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, she must go!" cried Moray impetuously, "she must go!"</p>

  <p>That evening the Queen learned that her brother and many of his followers
  had left Edinburgh. She summoned them to return immediately or to hold
  themselves as rebels.</p>

  <p>She sent for Sir William Maitland and commanded him to come to her in the
  Exchequer House where she was casting up her accounts which she did every
  year at this time with her secretary. "For she had a mind," she said in her
  message, "to open her heart to him," and on a beautiful purple summer evening
  Sir William waited on the Queen. He had long been estranged from the
  court.</p>

  <p>The fading day had the sweetness of high summer, the parlour in the
  summer-house was drenched with sunshine. The Queen sat in the window and
  watched the golden leaves that half hid the sky making a shifting pattern as
  the hot breeze fanned them to and fro.</p>

  <p>She was alone but for Florestan, the monkey, asleep on the borders of her
  skirt, but through a half-open door she could see her secretaries at
  work&mdash;the two Italians and the Frenchman who had been in the service of
  her uncle, the Cardinal, busy with their books and ledgers.</p>

  <p>As soon as Sir William Maitland had entered the Queen's presence his
  strained glance took in that distant scene and he smiled good-humouredly. He
  was still the Queen's Secretary of State, though since her marriage he had
  had little work to do.</p>

  <p>Why had she sent for him? He was pleased but not flattered at the
  summons.</p>

  <p>The Secretary, perhaps among all the men who had something to do with the
  Queen, knew exactly how she regarded him. He could almost be sure what she
  was going to say&mdash;no doubt she wished to sound him as to the intentions
  of Moray, Morton, and himself. She considered herself very adroit and subtle
  in these matters and it pleased him to watch her spread her wiles, like it
  pleased him to watch a peacock spread his tail. That her caprice or fancy
  might ruin him, already had, perhaps, ruined him, did not greatly affect him.
  His whole life was in intellectual activity, he played the game for the sake
  of the game purely, he cared little for the stakes.</p>

  <p>The Queen looked at him as he came in and made his reverence and then, as
  he returned her gaze, her eyes shifted; they were never steady for long.</p>

  <p>"Are you come to scold me?" she asked.</p>

  <p>At which the Secretary replied simply that he had come because he had been
  sent for, and waited for her to speak. "Oh," replied the Queen, with an air,
  candid, almost timid. "We have always been open with each other, you and I,
  Sir William, we understood each other from the first. You were my mother's
  faithful servant."</p>

  <p>Sir William smiled in silence. She knew how often he had betrayed Mary of
  Guise, as he swung from this side to that as his temper moved him, caring
  only to work out his own schemes to the end he had appointed for them.</p>

  <p>She was silent for a moment breathing deeply as if she drank in the
  sunshine, but he knew that she was wondering what course to take with him.
  All her tricks amused him, as did the darting of his cat after a ball of
  silk.</p>

  <p>She decided on a mock frankness, and said directly: "The Earl of Moray has
  left Edinburgh."</p>

  <p>"Ay, madame, to raise a rebellion."</p>

  <p>"And the Earl of Morton?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"He is still Lord High Chancellor, madame, as I am Secretary of
  State."</p>

  <p>"Do not either of you, Sir William, follow the Earl of Moray?"</p>

  <p>"Madame, no."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Need I answer that, madame, and how shall you be satisfied with any
  answer that I might make?"</p>

  <p>"Knowing that you never tell the truth?"</p>

  <p>"Knowing that there is no need for me to do so. Besides, your own wit
  shall give you the reply."</p>

  <p>"It is this, then," said the Queen. "The Earl of Morton and you and many
  others besides who fawned on Moray when he was here, remain with me. Because
  you think that after all I am the Queen and that if I raise my standard, more
  will rally to that than will follow the Earl of Moray, who is, after all, but
  my bastard brother."</p>

  <p>"That answer is as good as another," replied Sir William, indifferently.
  "But we remain, madame, we remain! We are in your service and you must give
  your orders."</p>

  <p>He crossed the room deliberately, and shut the door that opened into the
  counting-house where the two Italians worked.</p>

  <p>"Why did Moray go?" insisted the Queen. "You are his closest friend, tell
  me that. I took nothing from him, I offered him no affront."</p>

  <p>"The man is squeamish," replied Sir William, "and he does not like to see
  the maggots deflower the apricot; his stomach turns when he sees vermin in a
  lady's chamber."</p>

  <p>She understood him at once, he saw, and seemed more interested than
  offended. Maitland continued to expound his theme for it always pleased him
  to put into words his careful, shrewd opinions of his fellow-men, the result
  of observation.</p>

  <p>"Lord Moray has a mixed nature, madame. Part of him cares for gaudy
  things&mdash;houses and lands and money and power, the lure of common men.
  And part of him would throw all away rather than be brought to behold a sight
  which repulses him."</p>

  <p>The Queen picked up the grey, wrinkled monkey from her skirt-hem and
  placed it on her lap.</p>

  <p>"Why," she asked serenely, "should it disturb Lord Moray or you or any
  other gentleman that I take this industrious Italian for my servant?"</p>

  <p>"Do you not really know, madame? The rat is quite a dainty animal with
  smooth fur and bright eye, very nimble in his gait, but he is bred to stench
  and filth, he is fed on garbage and crouches in the dungeons. When we find
  him in a pretty chamber we kill him."</p>

  <p>The Queen drooped her head in her hands as she stared down at the
  monkey.</p>

  <p>"I am fastidious, too," said Sir William smiling. "I do not care to sniff
  at a fly-blown flower, to see the rot creep into the peach. Yet, curiosity
  overcomes all."</p>

  <p>"Curiosity, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. To see what may grow out of this corruption."</p>

  <p>The Queen sighed lightly. She seemed neither vexed nor greatly moved.</p>

  <p>"Sir, you see things one way, and f another. Corruption! Are you to preach
  like old John Knox? Wien he used to come up to the palace he would shake his
  fist in my ladies' faces and remind them of these same noisome
  things&mdash;your rat, your fly, your maggot, your spoiled peach, your
  bruised flowers, decay and corruption to make the squeamish sick. Ay, and
  without any stuttering, sir, he told us plain tales of how one day the worm
  would pick our bones completely. He did not frighten me, Sir William." She
  lifted from her waist the watch in the form of a skull. "That was given me by
  my first husband; he died young and wretchedly, corrupting while the breath
  was still in him. Do you think it is easy to frighten me? I always wear this
  at my waist, and I too can see the blowfly and the worms beneath the flower
  and the leaf."</p>

  <p>"Madame, you have mistook and purposely, I think, my allegory. Let me say
  directly that Lord Moray could not stand by and see the Queen's Majesty
  defiled by the company she keeps."</p>

  <p>"And do you think him justified, Sir William?"</p>

  <p>"Madame, I do."</p>

  <p>"Then why did you not follow him?"</p>

  <p>"As I have said&mdash;out of curiosity and to help you if can."</p>

  <p>She continued to caress the monkey and to smile without looking up. Sir
  William saw that he had pleased her by this confession of loyalty. He had not
  troubled to be subtle with her, he had spoken the truth when he had stated
  his motives. He war inquisitive as to what would befall this strange, bold,
  foolish woman and he did wish to help her although he had long ago, in
  silence, given up his once strong hope of seeing her a powerful sovereign and
  himself her powerful minister.</p>

  <p>Yet, besmirched and tarnished as she might be, she was still the Queen and
  worth saving, if indeed she could yet be saved. He looked at her tenderly.
  Her complexion did not seem so clear nor her eyes so radiant nor her hair so
  brilliant, there was a blur over her loveliness that had always been smooth
  and bright like a pearl.</p>

  <p>She sat silent, withdrawn into her own thoughts as if oblivious of his
  scrutiny. And the able, keen-witted man who believed he understood her began
  to feel that she was, after all, something of a mystery. What had she learnt
  in France? She might have been brought up by a fanatic prude of a
  grandmother, lived under the wing of an austere mother-in-law, her own mother
  might have been the chastest woman in the world, priests, cardinals, nuns,
  might have hedged her round about, but what had she learnt in France where
  every woman of her rank knew too much?</p>

  <p>He saw her as fickle, inconstant, ravenous for the hearts and souls of
  others but without either heart or soul herself&mdash;an elegant harpy, cold,
  knowing nothing even of passion. Then he thought that this was a false
  picture. She might be without tenderness, fidelity, affection, or
  spirituality, but even so, why should she be thought of as worthless? Did not
  this rather make her a goddess? Had not she, by virtue of some divinity,
  enshrined in her person, a right to her whims and fancies, her cruelties?
  Might not all be forgiven to the woman whose look, whose touch, whose smile
  could start a bright dream in the mind like a brilliant bird started from the
  coverts of a wood? Corrupt, depraved, a trivial, shallow creature&mdash;or a
  goddess beyond all their codes and traditions, their petty human reserves and
  denials? Sir William Maitland did not know, though he had a clear judgment
  and believed in nothing, and alone of all the men in Scotland was free of
  superstition.</p>

  <p>The Queen glanced at him sideways and began to plead with him. Her
  marriage, now? She supposed everyone talked ill of that. Perhaps she had been
  mistaken, but she had married Henry Stewart to bring peace to the kingdom, to
  put a claimant to the throne out of the way.</p>

  <p>"You know, Sir William, It has always been your desire and mine that one
  day my House might reign over the whole Island. Well, is this not a step
  towards it? If we should have a child&mdash;" She put her hand to her waist
  and smiled timidly. "And David, now. You are mistaken there, he is so humble
  and so good and not what you think. He has had a hard life, he and his poor
  young brother. They are only boys and I try to make amends to them for all
  they have suffered. They work very diligently."</p>

  <p>She continued in her low persuasive voice, which seemed to Sir William to
  have no feeling in it at all, to put forward the case of the two Italians, to
  praise them, to excuse herself for employing them. But Sir William took no
  more heed than if he had been listening to the chatter of the sparrows in the
  hedge, and when she paused he said, looking up at the sky:</p>

  <p>"The Queen's Grace may pity two poor foreign boys and give them charity,
  but she may not have them in her closet clothed in sable and purple and
  entrust them with her secrets. What letters does Signor David write for you,
  madame, that I may not see?"</p>

  <p>"Why, only on my private matters, to my friends and relatives in
  France."</p>

  <p>Sir William smiled at this childish tie. Surely she knew that he was aware
  that she conducted clumsy and complicated intrigues with the Roman Catholic
  church through the medium of the Italians. He began to weary of the
  purposeless conversation which seemed to him to mean no more than the buzzing
  of flies in the air. He no longer expected anything from her that would serve
  either Scotland or himself. All her little lies and beguilements to entice
  him to his old allegiance (for he knew that that was what she wanted of him:
  she was jealous of any loss of respect or affection) were to him but a waste
  of breath. So he said:</p>

  <p>"I shall remain in Edinburgh and so will the Lord Morton."</p>

  <p>At that she burst out in anger against the Lord Chancellor, detailing all
  his lewd habits and puritanical hypocrisy.</p>

  <p>She rose, shaking the monkey into the window-place where she had sat,
  leaving it to curl up on the cushions.</p>

  <p>"I so detest the Earl Morton that I have half a mind to put David in his
  place."</p>

  <p>"Excellent and noble lady," said Sir William smiling, "all that you say of
  Earl Morton is very true and you may well be astonished that your brother had
  such an adviser and that I have such a friend. We have but one reason,
  madame, the man knows how to govern Scotland."</p>

  <p>"I do not need a governor, neither does the country," replied the Queen.
  "I have a husband now."</p>

  <p>Sir William did not trouble to answer these boasts. Why should he trouble
  himself for her and her young lord who was so detested? She herself who might
  have made something of him, perhaps a worthy wearer of the crown, was herself
  spoiling his manliness by her tricks and her inconstancy.</p>

  <p>Maitland pitied the wretched young King as he might have pitied the mayfly
  caught in the almost invisible menace of the spider's web.</p>

  <p>"Madame, the day is hot, let us not play with words. In Edinburgh I await
  your pleasure."</p>

  <p>By the emphasis he gave this last word he invested it with a double
  meaning so that even she was a little discomposed and began to walk up and
  down the sun-drenched parlour. He watched her, admiring the flow of her blue
  gown, the grace of her bearing, but caring no more for what she said than for
  the cooing of the doves in the trees, but he was pleased with the modulations
  in her voice, as she railed against Moray.</p>

  <p>She knew, she cried, that he had long wished to be a traitor, that he
  intended to set the crown on his own head. She vowed that she would harry him
  out of Scotland, and declared vehemently that she knew who would help her to
  do this. He thought she alluded to her miserable husband or the Italian, and
  he did not trouble to answer.</p>

  <p>But while she paced up and down, exhausting herself in her anger against
  Moray, expressing also her rage against many other things, perhaps against
  her own destiny, Maitland thought of a crafty trick that he might try. When
  the Queen paused and stood sighing again in the window-place looking up at
  the gold leaves against the sky, he said:</p>

  <p>"Madame, might I speak to Signor David?"</p>

  <p>She looked startled, for she could not understand this, but she gave her
  consent out of curiosity.</p>

  <p>"He is in the next room."</p>

  <p>"I am to wait on him, then?" asked Sir William Maitland pleasantly. "It
  shall be as the Queen's Grace says."</p>

  <p>He made her his reverence and crossed to the door that he had recently
  shut, opened it, and entered the presence of the Italian secretary and his
  assistants.</p>

  <p>Signor David felt very proud when he saw Sir William Maitland, that great
  famous gentleman, approaching him with a pliant, courteous, almost suppliant
  air. Lately many people, some of them of considerable importance, had begun
  to flatter the Italian secretary, even to fawn on him, and he made a large
  amount of money in bribes and presents from many of those whose shoes he
  would have been glad to tie a few months ago; some even now pulled off their
  caps to him. He did not think it at all impossible that even Sir William
  Maitland might have come to beg him to plead with the Queen. No doubt the
  Secretary of State was troubled for his future now that his patron, the Earl
  of Moray, had fled the capital.</p>

  <p>The Italian rose, made a slight reverence and then seated himself again,
  leaving Sir William standing. The servant was quite intoxicated by his
  success and felt very able to hold it with his own cunning and cleverness.
  All the letters that he sent abroad seemed to him like strong ties to keep
  him in his place. He was the keeper of the Queen's secrets, one who had
  ousted her young husband in her favour. He believed it was wise to be
  presumptuous, bold and pert. He stared at Sir William steadily.</p>

  <p>Sir William looked at him casually as if he glanced over some object he
  might be about to purchase, say a handsome young horse or a sporting dog.</p>

  <p>The Italian was carefully barbered, tailored, and perfumed. Not a hair of
  his trim person was awry; the smooth hair in curled ends was tucked behind
  the left ear in which hung a pearl.</p>

  <p>Maitland's scrutiny travelled from that costly ornament to a cross of five
  diamonds on the young man's breast and then to a ring of emeralds on the
  slender finger.</p>

  <p>"Signor David, there are few in Scotland who care to give you good advice.
  You are a foreigner, a stranger here and have not many friends."</p>

  <p>"Sir," replied the Italian, leaning back in his chair, "I do very
  well."</p>

  <p>Sir William Maitland gazed at him serenely. He thought him vile, worthless
  and shallow, a fool. He recalled that Moray had tried to warn the foolish
  master, make friends with him and save him, for the Queen's sake. Now he,
  whose feelings were not as involved as Moray's had been, was trying to save
  the servant&mdash;for the Queen's sake always. He doubted if it could be
  done, but in what seemed a simple, a natural way, he made the attempt.</p>

  <p>"Signor David, I have travelled much and observed men and women closely. I
  speak, therefore, from a long experience when I say that I have seen many a
  lackey lifted to his master's place and there beheld him glitter for a little
  while like a false marshflare, ay, even splutter and sparkle on the threshold
  of his lady's chamber, but always, in the conclusion, I have seen him stamped
  out. Underfoot, Signor David, like a spark from a torch."</p>

  <p>The Italian listened keenly. His lean fingers played over the papers in
  front of him. He had been copying an inventory of the Queen's jewels, a task
  that he loved. Sir William spoke so wisely, so coolly, that the Italian was
  impressed and alarmed. He did not answer but glanced at his brother, who was
  sitting tense the other side of the table listening, his bright eyes
  searching Sir William's impassive face.</p>

  <p>"Leave Scotland," advised the Secretary of State. "Pack up your velvets
  and your furs, your brooches and your rings and begone while you can."</p>

  <p>The Italian fondled his chin and looked away. Then he crossed himself,
  heaved his shoulders, and began to laugh, staring down at the diamonds on his
  breast to give himself confidence.</p>

  <p>"Sir William Maitland, when the Queen bids me to do so I shall leave
  Scotland, and that will not be yet, I think, for I have no reason to believe
  that I displease her."</p>

  <p>He smiled, showing his white, sharp teeth, and Giuseppe, the young
  brother, laughed and began to pull about the ledger and turn the pages,
  absorbed in his task as if Sir William's visit was an interruption and an
  annoyance.</p>

  <p>"How absurd," remarked the Secretary lightly, "is it to see those, as
  common as a barber's chair, who think to gain renown by a web of little
  lies."</p>

  <p>The Queen had her book between her fingers and seemed drowsy. When Sir
  William returned to her parlour she did not concern herself to ask him what
  had passed between him and the Italian. She could find that out afterwards.
  She nodded to him and looked down again at her great book of amorous
  tales.</p>

  <p>Sir William glanced pleasantly at the clock above the table on which was
  the tumbled needlework.</p>

  <p>"Your time is past, madame. Your clock has lost the hour."</p>

  <p>The Queen flamed suddenly like a furled banner broken into the sky. She
  came glittering, flushed, triumphant to a meeting of the Privy Council and
  insisted that her brother and the Lords who had followed him, the chief of
  whom was Argyll, his brother-in-law, should be plainly denounced as rebels.
  She signed the Proclamation which charged all her subjects not to give these
  men meat, drink, armour, any succour or obedience. She signed another
  desiring all her subjects with fifteen days' provisions to meet at the great
  cities of the country&mdash;Edinburgh, Linlithgow, Falkirk, Glasgow,
  Stirling.</p>

  <p>She appointed the Earl of Atholl Lieutenant of the North, and charged him
  to seek out the rebels and pursue them with fire and sword. All men between
  the ages of sixteen and sixty under pain of forfeiture of their goods were to
  support the Queen against the Earl of Moray.</p>

  <p>It was the Queen, beautiful, animated, with an air of power and authority
  who made all arrangements and issued all orders. Her husband was sometimes
  with her but more often she was alone, with her women and the Italian
  secretary. Morton and Maitland remained in her service, although they had
  been Moray's friends.</p>

  <p>In the warm autumn weather the Queen rode to St. Andrews with the King in
  splendid armour by her side, and she herself in gold and scarlet with a seal
  cap garnished with the red and yellow plumes, and, people whispered, a steel
  corselet beneath her jacket. She appeared upright, one who would vanquish not
  only her enemies but her own weakness.</p>

  <p>The Scots applauded her sudden action, her courage and her activity. She
  seemed suddenly not only popular but triumphant. Scotland rallied to her as
  she had always declared Scotland would. The Queen, shaking off her languors
  and her parasites, galloped after rebels.</p>

  <p>At St. Andrews she signed a Proclamation against her brother, accusing him
  of insatiable ambition, of using his religion to cover his ungodly designs,
  of creating unrest by means of which he might obtain the Crown for himself.
  In plain language, he would be King himself and administer the kingdom,
  "leaving us as a mere title."</p>

  <p>By the end of August she had five thousand armed, provisioned men behind
  her. This excited her and gave her an air of nobility and grandeur. It seemed
  as if she really loved these people who had taken up her quarrels, so
  generously did she speak to them, so graciously did she smile upon them. It
  seemed as if she really cared for this country of her father's. She became
  admired, beloved, a symbol of ancient royalty. Men forgot her unwise
  marriage, forgot her foreign favourite and took up her quarrels gladly.</p>

  <p>Twelve hundred men gathered round the Earl of Moray. He was penniless; his
  sole reliance was on possible help from England. His estates, his revenues,
  his honour were all forfeit. The Queen pursued him and his small force from
  Stirling to Glasgow, from Paisley to Hamilton, from Hamilton to
  Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>Moray and Argyll led their irregular rabble of troops through Edinburgh
  streets and were fired on by Lord Erskine, who held the Castle. They escaped
  to Dumfries, where on hearing that the Queen was pursuing them with a growing
  force of nearly ten thousand men, Moray dispersed his few troops and retired
  over the Border.</p>

  <p>When the Queen heard this she laughed, as if there was nothing more to be
  feared in the world. She was Queen indeed, she-was great, she was powerful,
  she was triumphant.</p>

  <p>With her victory, a flicker of her old passion for her husband returned.
  She considered him and cautiously approved him. He had not been called upon
  for any heroic or difficult action and he was often sullen and violent. She
  knew that the very Lords and men who followed him detested him, yet he had
  looked well enough at the head of his troops, on his sombrely appointed horse
  as he rode through the rough country ways, cities, and streets. He had been,
  this man of her impetuous and sudden choice, at least a fine symbol of a king
  and her malice was gratified to think how sore Moray's pride would be that
  this gilded puppet had driven him from the kingdom after which he hankered so
  greedily.</p>

  <p>At St. Andrews she had been very loving with her sulky and bewildered lord
  and had wooed him out of his mistrustful silence. She could scarcely afford
  to quarrel with him, and yet she meant to keep him in his place. She would
  not give him the Crown Matrimonial so easily, and she would not let him
  attend the Privy Council; documents should pass with her name alone on them.
  It would be very foolish to resign any power to one so unstable and
  jealous.</p>

  <p>Yet, partly because she was still sometimes attracted by his strength and
  beauty and partly because in this split kingdom she wished to keep him true
  to her, she wooed him back to his allegiance. She even flattered him, giving
  him some credit for the bloodless, easy victory. But when she lay in his arms
  in the castle at St. Andrews she had told him something that had not pleased
  him at all.</p>

  <p>She had recalled three broken, discredited men to Scotland and intended to
  set them high in command in her new army. These were the Earl of Huntly, a
  Papist, son of the ruined Cock o' the North, brother to the man whom Moray
  had beheaded in her presence at Inverness, the Earl of Sutherland, his
  friend, also banished by Moray, and the wizard Earl of Bothwell.</p>

  <p>"It is to confound my brother," she smiled, trying to kiss away her young
  husband's frowns.</p>

  <p>But he was hostile and doubtful, he objected.</p>

  <p>"These men are rogues and scoundrels, loathed by all. They will try to set
  themselves up." Maybe in his heart he thought: "They will try to dislodge
  me."</p>

  <p>The Queen reassured him, No. These three were loyal and would be good
  servants. It was only the ambitious Moray whom they did not like and with
  whom they would not live. It would be clever, it would be cunning to restore
  them their lands and honours, bind them to one for ever. Bothwell commanded
  the Border, Huntly the North, why not unite these two leaders in one bond of
  loyalty? It was thought to make a marriage between Earl Bothwell and Earl
  Huntly's sister.</p>

  <p>"But Bothwell is a heretic," objected the King sullenly. Any such
  intricate combination always baffled him. He wished that this foolish war was
  over. He disliked riding all day in his heavy armour. He wanted to return to
  his field sports and his games. He was even sometimes weary of the Queen,
  though she could at moments completely dazzle him, when she laughed and
  caressed him in high spirits.</p>

  <p>She did not listen to the murmured criticism about her, the secret
  reproaches of Mary Seaton. She took no heed of the shrugs and smiles of
  Maitland nor the scowls of Morton, these two men whose strange loyalty she
  accepted so indifferently. The three Lords were recalled.</p>

  <p>The Queen had sent Earl Bothwell's relative, Murray of Tullibardine, to
  find him in Paris. This gentleman had been arrested by the English but had
  contrived to send his chamber-boy to France, and in September, Earl Bothwell
  presented himself before the Queen with a great train of armed men from the
  Border. She liked that unquestioning allegiance, his coming to her despite
  danger, his waiting on her pleasure without comment.</p>

  <p>She said to her husband: "That is how I would be served!" and she promised
  Bothwell the Governorship of the Border which the young King wanted for his
  father, the Earl of Lennox, and she allowed Bothwell to ride beside Morton
  and Atholl in pursuit of the rebels. By October the Queen was in Edinburgh
  again, Moray had fled to England, Argyll was in hiding in the Highlands, and
  the Hamiltons had been contemptuously pardoned on condition that they
  remained five years in exile.</p>

  <p>The Queen took off her armour, her helmet, her riding-gauntlets, her
  skirts, she set aside her pistols and her dagger, for she had no further need
  of weapons. All her foes were dispersed, humiliated, and vanquished. Moray
  might cringe and whine at the Court of Elizabeth Tudor, but he was harmless
  now.</p>

  <p>When she had ridden back to Edinburgh the people had acclaimed her. Even
  the Protestants had seemed gratified and excited by her brave action, by her
  princely quelling of the rebellion. There were no more murmurs against her,
  no more doubts were thrown on her shining honour.</p>

  <p>Money and promises of more to follow had come from the Pope, and kindly
  encouraging letters from her relatives in France. She had intrigues afoot
  with Spain. All would go well, at last she was Queen ...</p>

  <p>Sighing with delight she told her adventures to Mary Seaton and David
  Rizzio when they sat by the first fires of autumn in her little closet in
  King James's Tower.</p>

  <p>She had not taken the Italian with her on her swift expedition against the
  rebels because she did not wish to anger Henry Stewart when it was necessary
  that he should preserve the appearance of unity with her. And she had not
  taken Mary Seaton because the pious girl was tenderhearted and turned sick at
  bloodshed or violence, and there might have been both in that violent pursuit
  of the rebels.</p>

  <p>Though the Queen had lately met so many of her subjects and been gracious
  to them all and enjoyed their homage and their adoration, she was glad to
  return to these two with whom she felt so intimate&mdash;the girl who had
  been her companion all her life and the young man whom she had known only a
  few months.</p>

  <p>She spoke of the quick rides from place to place, the long hours in the
  saddle, the austere beauty of the countryside. "I swear I love the place, the
  darkness and the loneliness and the clear air."</p>

  <p>She kept her narrowed eyes in the direction of the Italian, who knelt in
  an attitude of humility the other side of the marble hearth and listened to
  all her pretty talk and exultations, his lips parted, eyes downcast, his
  breast lightly rising and falling under the cluster of diamonds.</p>

  <p>The Queen had liked, while she had been abroad on her martial arrays, to
  think of him waiting with his patient resignation. It pleased her to think
  how impossible it was for him ever to attain what he must desire of her. How
  close he came to her in one sense, and how far away he was in another.</p>

  <p>She allowed Mary Seaton to take off her jacket in his presence and sat
  there with shoulders bare under the gauze, and feet naked on a cushion, and
  challenged him to let his colour rise or his eyes gleam.</p>

  <p>She rejoiced in the discomfiture and humiliation of Moray, who had tried
  to rule her, to thwart her and frustrate her, who had denied her marriage,
  who had tried to turn away her friends and her favourites. She told Mary
  Seaton to light more candles, and when the room was ablaze with radiance she
  sat and talked of the Earl of Bothwell, the sly wizard, the bold soldier, the
  elegant man all embossed in gold who had ridden beside her standard.</p>

  <p>It had been David's advice that he should be brought back from Paris,
  David who always advised her well.</p>

  <p>"You always give me fine counsel, David. I think it was very wise to bring
  these three men home. They will serve me as no others can. It is a pity that
  Bothwell is a heretic, but maybe I can turn him from that."</p>

  <p>So the Queen flattered the Italian, thanking him for another wise counsel
  he had given her, which had been not to crush utterly the Hamiltons but
  merely to hold them at bay, so that they might balance those of the Lennox
  Stewarts, "Lest my lord the King and his father grow too proud, madame," the
  sly Italian had persuaded her ready ear. "Hold the balance so, one faction up
  and the other down, but only by a shade so that when you wish you can turn
  the scale by your finger's weight."</p>

  <p>Yes, that had been good advice, too. She held the difficult King, and his
  foolish father, whom she had always detested, checked, "Lest they grow too
  great, David. But they hate it! My good lord is very angry with me, at first
  because I do not give his father the Governorship of the Border but rather
  presented it to Earl Bothwell, and second for this matter of the Hamiltons.
  Oh, they were violent and bloody. They would have had all the Hamiltons
  butchered. As if I liked such cruel actions."</p>

  <p>She spoke indifferently and smiled; she held a little mirror twisted with
  a serpent in her hand and painted her mouth.</p>

  <p>"Oh, David, it is good to be a queen and ride the heather, with thousands
  of men behind you. I like that cold, clean air, it is sweeter than any
  perfume. And the taste of the mountain brooks, and those mountains so stately
  and lonely with the high clouds curled above. Oh, David, it seems to me I
  reign at last."</p>

  <p>She stretched herself on the luxurious reposing-bed, clasping her hands
  behind her head and looked at her bare feet pressed against the cushion by
  the rail. Then she glanced sideways at the young man kneeling on the hearth.
  He was graceful as a fine statue and almost as immovable. She had made him,
  he was her creation hardly to be known as the mean, half-starved lackey who
  had found the monkey for her in the chapel. It was amusing to fling him
  favours and see him snap at them and flourish and grow fat purely because of
  her whims and fancies.</p>

  <p>Mary Seaton broke the train of these pleasant meditations. She began to
  lament and complain in a high, peevish voice because Earl Bothwell had come
  back. He was no better than a sorcerer, a man whom everyone loathed and
  condemned. It would be no credit to the Queen to show him favour. She began
  to list, half in fear, half with relish, some of the tales of Earl Bothwell's
  wickedness.</p>

  <p>"He will marry," said the Queen, smiling from her cushions, "and no doubt
  his little wife will make an honest sober man of him."</p>

  <p>"Have you seen Jane Gordon?" asked Mary Seaton prudishly.</p>

  <p>"No. What does it matter? She is Huntly's sister and will bind the two
  Houses together." She paused and turned this thought over in her mind. "I
  will see her, I will have her brought to court. She is very young and simple,
  I have heard." She lifted her faint brows and sighed: "I would rather like to
  be Jane Gordon and marry Earl Bothwell. Yes, there are some emotions one must
  envy. A wizard's wife&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She sat up impatiently and with a gesture bid David rise from his knees on
  the hearth. "Come and sit beside me on the couch, David, you are as dumb as
  Florestan."</p>

  <p>As she spoke Mary Seaton turned with an affrighted face.</p>

  <p>The King had entered the audience chamber by the newel stair from his
  apartments and was coming towards the closet, the door of which was open.</p>

  <p>"What does it matter?" shrugged the Queen, and she commanded David, who
  had risen, to take his place on the corner of her couch.</p>

  <p>"Oh, madame," sighed Mary Seaton, "the King is angry!"</p>

  <p>"When do I see him otherwise?"</p>

  <p>The Italian could no longer endure his position; as the King strode into
  the room he slipped to his knees beside the day-bed and seemed to be telling
  the rosary which hung at his gold-studded belt.</p>

  <p>There were many flames in the room&mdash;on the hearth and in the candles
  stuck in their sticks of gilded copper&mdash;and the brightness of all of
  them seemed reflected in the Queen's defiant eyes. Without rising she stared
  at her husband as he paused on the threshold.</p>

  <p>He looked at the Italian, looked at her, opened his lips, but did not
  speak. She admired him, his size and height, the colour of his bright hair in
  the artificial light. She saw that he had been drinking, was fuddled and
  confused, and that pleased and excited her too. She, who had ten-thousand
  victorious men behind her, was not afraid of this stupid, drunken boy.</p>

  <p>The Italian glanced up sideways and bent his head again, then gathered
  courage from the silence. Slowly he rose to his feet and went to the hearth,
  where against the shaft of the mantelpiece lay a lute. He picked it up and
  began to knot carefully the coloured ribbons on the handle. The King's slow
  glance followed him, then returned to the Queen.</p>

  <p>"You are melancholy company to-night, Harry."</p>

  <p>The young man stood silent. He had been so bewildered of late often he
  could think more clearly when he had drunk several large cups of wine; things
  then seemed to fit into place with certain, undeniable exactitude. Now, for
  instance, there could be no doubt the woman there was his wife by virtue of a
  ceremony, but before that she had been his harlot, taken as easily as a
  common slut. The slim young foreigner, who with such agile nimbleness was
  fingering the lute, had been his servant, to be beaten and kicked, even by
  the Antony Standens, and somewhere between the three of them had been some
  talk of love, honour, manhood. But now this pretence was all torn to shreds,
  and through the tatters of it they grinned and jeered at him, a strumpet and
  her pimp.</p>

  <p>He walked slowly to the Queen's side and looked curiously down at her bare
  feet, her nude shoulders and arms. His lips were parted and his eyes
  bloodshot, his jacket was unbuttoned so that his full bare throat showed. He
  had a large dagger with hard square red stones in the hilt stuck into his
  belt.</p>

  <p>He stood over his wife and picked up her left hand and looked at the three
  rings he had given her, one a diamond, one of heavy cut gold, and one of
  blood-red he had taken from her breast the night in Stirling Castle. He
  dropped her hand and peered into her face and then down at her half-disclosed
  bosom where another cluster of diamonds lay. Then, without a word he turned
  and went away.</p>

  <p>All three were silent and then as they heard the door close Mary Seaton
  began to weep. The Queen sat up angrily; she had seldom felt so stung, so
  disturbed. In the midst of her great triumph it was as if someone had struck
  her across the face with a whip, as if she had been shamed publicly.</p>

  <p>"Go and fetch the King back," she commanded, and Mary Seaton ran away
  drying her tears, but soon came back and said he would not come. He was shut
  in his room below; he had some man with him. She had pressed her ears to a
  crack and heard them talking.</p>

  <p>"He refused me?" asked the Queen. "He knew that I sent you yet he would
  not come?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I met him on the threshold of his room and he said `No,' and thrust
  me away and bolted the door." The Queen said:</p>

  <p>"Thus it is to have married one such a fool. What did he say, Mary? It is
  necessary I should know. Did he say anything of me? Did he explain why he
  came and looked \at me and went like that?"</p>

  <p>Mary Seaton had not the wit to dissemble or make an excuse; she could
  refuse her mistress nothing.</p>

  <p>"He said, 'Tell her I do not want a wench to-night.'"</p>

  <p>The Queen put her hand to her cheek as if she felt a bruise. Then she
  shrugged her shoulders and laughed.</p>

  <p>"Well, David will stay and keep me company. Bring in the cards, Mary, and
  the dice, and that last book which was sent from France."</p>

  <p>Mary Seaton began to whimper, to protest, but the Queen ordered her away
  and when she had gone commanded the Italian to bolt the door.</p>

  <p>The young man obeyed in silence. The Queen eyed him, amused to think how
  his blood must be beating, his senses trembling. Never had her careless
  favour gone so far. A servant, a scullion. Well, in France she had heard of
  great ladies who had taken their grooms just out of idleness, a caprice. It
  was such an easy intrigue and not without piquancy&mdash;Venus and the
  stableman. David was trim and neat, he did not smell of the cellar or the
  kitchen; there was nothing about his person to offend the most fastidious.
  How he adored her, and so humbly, with such exquisite courtesy! Never would
  he insult her as she had just been insulted by one of royal blood, a prince
  who aspired to be a king, but who was, nevertheless, a stupid boor, a
  blundering youth.</p>

  <p>She turned in her bed.</p>

  <p>"David, come here."</p>

  <p>He was instantly kneeling before her, hiding his face in the fringed ends
  of her coverlets. She thought that he wept. "Oh, madame! Oh, madame!"</p>

  <p>She smiled. It was like a goddess to be able to grant such happiness. She
  was victorious now, she could do as she wished. Moray was no longer there to
  scold or to blame.</p>

  <p>"Do you love me, David?"</p>

  <p>He became suddenly bold, a king, a conqueror, and stood over her, tall and
  urgent, speaking thickly in his own harsh tongue.</p>

  <p>The Queen put up her hands and laced her fingers behind his smooth bronze
  hair. She laughed under his desperate kisses, thinking of the fool, who was
  so soon being punished.</p>

  <p>It was Maitland who was enclosed in the King's chamber. It was Maitland
  who had persuaded him, so subtly that the young man did not know he was being
  guided, to go up into his wife's chamber and see if the Signor Davie was
  there. It was Maitland who said to him as he sat with his elbows on his knees
  and his face in his hands: "Your Grace will know what to do." And who added
  lightly: "It would have been done long ago if Your Grace had had good
  advice."</p>

  <p>Still staring down at the carpet the young man said in a thick, blurred
  voice:</p>

  <p>"It is true I have been betrayed. I took him out of squalor, some damnable
  obscurity. He was quick and useful."</p>

  <p>"There is no need for Your Grace to run over the tale, which is one to
  make an honest man retch."</p>

  <p>"Sir," said the young King with a sudden simplicity that was more powerful
  than his rage or his drunkenness, "I would get it clear about the Queen my
  wife."</p>

  <p>"Let His Grace take his mind off that." With an odd, almost tender smile
  Sir William looked down at the youth. "Perhaps," he said, "when one has cut
  the canker off the rose&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Eh?" asked the miserable young man, staring up with bloodshot eyes. "Eh?
  Speak plainly!"</p>

  <p>"I mean, when this base foreigner has gone&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He's upstairs now. I ought to go and do it at once."</p>

  <p>Maitland shook his head like one admonishing a child.</p>

  <p>"No! Not now! Not that way! It is too easy, and too perilous also. Your
  Grace must have support."</p>

  <p>Earl Morton approached, with business-like dexterity and coolness, the
  affair that Maitland broached delicately to him. The Red Douglas had been not
  a whit less Moray's friend because he remained in the Queen's service. He had
  thought that he could serve his own interests and that of Moray and the
  Protestant Church better by remaining an intimate of the Queen's Council than
  by going into rebellion.</p>

  <p>He had none of Maitland's delicate, reluctant desire to serve and save the
  Queen with the dregs of a one-time tender fidelity. To him she was just a
  woman, and when he spoke of her it was with scorn. But he continued to remain
  in her council although she flouted him, to hold office under her though she
  showed him no favour, to endure her foreign favourites because he believed
  that hers was the folly that would soon ruin itself.</p>

  <p>Now the opportunity had come sooner than he had expected, just when she
  had felt herself so triumphant. To Moray, lurking in England, secretly helped
  by Elizabeth Tudor though openly shown an angry countenance by here Morton
  and Maitland sent secretly by cipher an account of the proposed affair.</p>

  <p>Moray approved, a bargain was made. The King would indemnify all, he would
  bring back the outlawed Lords, and they would avenge his honour and secure
  him what his wife denied completely&mdash;the Crown Matrimonial. But there
  was a hitch in the plot; both Earl Morton and his friends, Lord Ruthven and
  Lord Lindsay, Moray's brother-in-law, were contemptuously suspicious of the
  King, a light, unstable young man&mdash;"who drinks too much, who has a sly,
  amorous woman to his wife. How are we to trust him?" They protested thus,
  reluctant, hostile and hesitating even after Henry Stewart had set his name
  to the bond.</p>

  <p>So Maitland fetched him one winter night to Earl Morton's house and
  brought him into an inner room where the Puritan sat before a scanty fire,
  where the figures of Patrick Ruthven and Lord Lindsay showed in the
  half-obscurity of the twilight which only one badly burning lamp
  dispelled.</p>

  <p>The young King sat down heavily at the table on which was a worn cloth. He
  seemed sick, and shuddered in a fevered way; he had looked much altered. They
  all knew how his wife tormented him, thrusting him out of the council chamber
  and from her bed and board, and all knew whom it was she put in his
  place.</p>

  <p>The four wary, experienced men considered him, curious at so much
  wretchedness, doubting him too, so young, untried, seemingly so inconstant.
  His father was a known traitor, and he had been spoiled in his youth by his
  ambitious mother. Was he an instrument who would break in their hands?</p>

  <p>He sat mute, taking no heed of any of them, waiting for William Maitland
  to speak, for he always had difficulty with words.</p>

  <p>Quietly the Secretary of State began to discuss the murder of the Italian.
  It was something that must be done, that had been long decided upon, but the
  question was the manner of it. Neither Ruthven nor Lindsay could see any
  difficulty there&mdash;let the rat be taken as he was creeping up to his
  hole, on the stair outside his chamber where he slept with his brother
  Giuseppe. Would it not be easy enough to wait there for him and slit his
  throat before he had time to squeal?</p>

  <p>Morton thought so too. There were plenty of men who would undertake such
  work&mdash;notably that good fellow George Douglas or Archibald Douglas of
  Wittingham. Morton began to praise these two men&mdash;whom he had found so
  useful&mdash;as spies, as forgers, as false witnesses.</p>

  <p>Maitland knew them and approved of them. In person they were accomplished
  gentlemen and charming companions. Archibald was a parson and a Lord of
  Session and Morton was his benefactor and patron. For the excitement of it
  and a little money he would undertake the work. George, the Angus bastard,
  also was clever at this kind of thing.</p>

  <p>The King interrupted by looking up from the table and raising his hand as
  if entreating silence. His face was quite distorted in the light of the crude
  lamp. Lindsay threw another log on the fire and a great gust of wind rattled
  the old casement and the shutters.</p>

  <p>"I want him," whispered the young man, expressing himself with difficulty
  and under great emotion, "taken in the Queen's presence."</p>

  <p>Morton and his friends were surprised at this brutality, which they rather
  admired. They had not thought Henry Stewart possessed of so much spirit. But
  Maitland put his hand to his throat as one who feels his gorge rise.</p>

  <p>The King rose stiffly. He told them in a few rough words that the Queen
  was going to have a child, but it was not his and that only Rizzio's death in
  her presence, in her arms if need be, would satisfy him.</p>

  <p>"I have been betrayed," he said sullenly, "there's nothing left but this.
  I thought to be a king&mdash;" He checked himself, smiled, and motioned to
  Maitland. "Come, leave them to it. They know the way of it, I'll undertake
  everything. You must believe me now."</p>

  <p>He asked Maitland to help him from the room for he felt quite weak and
  sick. Morton nodded approvingly, tugging at his red beard: Lindsay and
  Ruthven's suspicions were silenced. If that were the case it was no need to
  fear the King would betray them or hang back.</p>

  <p>"In the Queen's presence," said Maitland, "that might mean to kill her
  too, and the child?"</p>

  <p>No one spoke. Maitland smiled to himself. Perhaps after all as well that
  way as another. In any case, Moray would return and she would be as nothing.
  Then the child, the Queen and David's child. Was the fool right there?</p>

  <p>He offered the heavy young man his arm and guided him into the street
  where the wind was harsh and cold and the sky overcast.</p>

  <p>They walked slowly under the swift, wind-driven clouds and he spoke, more
  to console himself than his companion, who hung on him in what seemed the
  apathy of despair.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, you've had your lesson early. Perhaps you've had your flash of
  nobility, your hope of honour, but now you see that we are gross and the
  world base. Here there is nothing grand, nay, nor even tragic. Which of us
  can deny his senses and which of us can avoid such a base, bloody business as
  we are on to-night?"</p>

  <p>They moved cautiously, for they had come on their secret errand without a
  light or a servant&mdash;there was a moon but it was fitful. Out of this
  windy dark came the young man's voice.</p>

  <p>"She lets him in and shuts me out. She laughs at me, she pulls me up and
  down and so has from the first. Now tell me, Maitland, you who are so wise,
  why did she take me? I did not think of her at all, I did not want her. If
  she would fool me was it for a play?"</p>

  <p>"It is of no importance," said Maitland softly, "nothing she does is of
  any importance."</p>

  <p>The young man did not understand and he began to mutter incoherently.</p>

  <p>To Maitland, the whole affair was incredible, fantastic, yet, he was
  determined to go through with it partly because he never endeavoured to stop
  the inevitable and partly because there was just the chance that through this
  act of brutal violence she might somehow be saved. He dared to think of her
  as purged, punished, and redeemed.</p>

  <p>The spring was very early for the north; even in March there was a
  softness in the air. The Queen lay in bed and longed for flowers that would
  not come yet, however eager the spring might seem.</p>

  <p>Her thoughts were drowsy, self-indulgent, all her passions were at a low
  ebb. She wanted to be quite alone, she would have no one near her, not even
  Mary Seaton. She turned over old fantasies, half-forgotten dreams in her
  mind.</p>

  <p>As she moved, she sighed, remembering the child to be born that summer.
  She did not know if she were glad or sorry; she liked anything that tried her
  courage, that saved her pride, and this did both. She did not wish to be
  barren. It was noble to blossom, to bear fruit; it would be noble to be the
  mother of a king or of a woman like herself who would wed a king.</p>

  <p>But it also meant weakness and fatigue, a blurring of her faculties, a
  slackening of her cleverness. She wanted to sleep and rest, but if she did
  she could not keep a watchful eye on all the events about her which she
  sensed just below the surface of her official life.</p>

  <p>She would be more important because of the child, enriched both as a queen
  and a woman. But she might die. Mary Seaton disturbed the Queen's
  meditations. It was almost evening, would she rise and take supper?</p>

  <p>She asked if her husband had been to her apartment that day.</p>

  <p>Mary Seaton said "No," nor yet to the Abbey as she thought. He was
  probably abroad with the Antony Standens flying his hawks and hounds as
  usual, or playing on the tennis court. It had been a fine day and seemed
  nearer April than March.</p>

  <p>The Queen sighed, remembering the King as she had seen him in what seemed
  a moment of transfiguration on the throne in the audience chamber. She sighed
  again, recalling it was Sunday and that she had not been to Mass. Yes, she
  would rise and come to supper and Lady Argyll might be bidden. She named one
  or two other officials of her household who were amusing, talked lightly of
  current events, who would afterwards play cards or billiards and help to pass
  the time. David! yes, David must be there, of course. He would play; if she
  could not have flowers or sunshine she would have sweet music.</p>

  <p>Mary Seaton lowered her eyes and said nothing. She called in the French
  girls and they discussed preparations for the dressing of their mistress.</p>

  <p>When she was fully arrayed in her discreet, fashionable clothes there
  seemed no change in her tall figure, and by candlelight and with the aid of
  Mary Seaton's careful painting and hair curling, there was no change in her
  smooth lovely face, though daylight had recently shown her beauty had
  diminished.</p>

  <p>The Queen sat at supper in her little closet between her bedroom and the
  audience chamber. Her spirits had risen suddenly for no reason at all, except
  that everyone else was so gay and good-humoured.</p>

  <p>The room, though small, was very cheerful. She had furnished it
  exquisitely and it sparkled like a casket of gems with the bold red in the
  arras, a golden-bound agate service on the table, gildings on the chairs,
  gold again in a stiff brocade which shut out the March night from the
  windows. Everyone was easy, relaxed, full of news and gossip which the Queen
  always loved to hear&mdash;odds and ends and scraps of politics, tales from
  the city, jokes and stories.</p>

  <p>Lady Argyll, who was very kindly treated by the Queen although her husband
  was a rebel in hiding, began to talk of Lord Bothwell because she knew this
  would be a pleasing subject. The Queen had pardoned him before everybody and
  had done him great honour in his recent marriage with Jane Gordon.</p>

  <p>And now, leaning back in her chair on the arm of which sat Florestan the
  monkey, she listened with interest. Her eyes rested on the Italian where he
  sat opposite her, pleasant, humble, holding his own by reason of her favour
  and nothing else among these great people all born his superiors, by his
  jokes which were shallow but amusing, his comments which were superficial but
  sounded clever. She liked his audaciousness as she liked the cap of saffron
  velvet which he, by her express permission, wore on his long bronze hair.</p>

  <p>The door in the audience chamber opened and the King came into the room.
  His appearance struck a note of discord.</p>

  <p>He sat down beside his wife without speaking and she, also in silence,
  continued to feed Florestan the monkey with the dark plums preserved in
  sugar. It was this kind of sweetmeat she had been eating when, dressed as a
  page, she had spoken privately to Henry Stewart the night of the festival she
  had given for him in the long gallery. She remembered this as she caressed
  the monkey in the hostile silence.</p>

  <p>The King scowled at her guests. He did not like Lady Argyll and her
  brother, Lord Robert Stewart, the Governor of Holyrood House, nor Arthur
  Erskine, now the Captain of the Guard, not only because they were friends of
  Moray but because they were so often with the Queen and, the young man
  believed, working against him. But, whilst he gave them quick looks of
  disdain, he took no notice whatever of David Rizzio, who had so far dared his
  fortunes as not to rise when the King entered but remained negligently
  leaning on the table-board.</p>

  <p>The Queen, with a casually indifferent air more stinging than a rebuke,
  asked her husband if he had supped and he said: "Yes, in my chamber below
  with Lord Morton, Ruthven, and Lindsay."</p>

  <p>She wondered why he had come. Three nights ago he had tried to force his
  way into her apartment, threatening to break the door down and so at last she
  had opened it. When he had found David Rizzio inside with his piles of
  papers, he had turned on his heel and gone out without a word and the Queen
  had thought she would be rid of him for some while.</p>

  <p>She looked over her shoulder. She was used to his heavy silences but this
  seemed to hold a menace she had not noticed before. She continued to feed the
  monkey, laughing at his snatching hands and puckered, wrinkled face. She was
  angry with her husband for his boorishness, no doubt he was mad with jealousy
  of David. Well, let him make himself as agreeable and useful as the Italian
  and he might look to find the same favour.</p>

  <p>Lady Argyll and her brother began talking together in embarrassed
  whispers. The Italian was in no way discomfited, but seemed to enjoy the
  wrath of the King as if he were master of them all.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly Henry Stewart did the last thing his wife would have
  expected of him. He put his arms round her waist and kissed her on the cheek
  exactly at that moment as Lord Ruthven, who had been mentioned as one of the
  company dining with the King in the rooms below, entered through the door in
  the newel stair which had admitted the King.</p>

  <p>Ruthven wore armour and his visor was pulled down. As he stood blinking in
  the light, the King's arms tightened round his wife's waist.</p>

  <p>The Italian, from whose face the smiling insolence had been wiped away by
  a sudden fear, rose instantly from his place at the table and went into the
  far corner of the room, which was so small that he was still close to the
  others.</p>

  <p>The Queen's alert glance flickered for an instant on the Italian, then
  turned steadily to hold Ruthven.</p>

  <p>"I thought, sir, that you were ill, that you were in so bad a case that I
  thought of visiting you."</p>

  <p>"Madame, I have strength enough for my duty," replied the armed man
  sourly.</p>

  <p>"I do not like your words nor the roughness of your coming," exclaimed the
  Queen, rising and snatching her husband's arm from her waist.</p>

  <p>"I have not to do with you, madame, but with that villain," and he nodded
  towards the Italian drawn up against the further wall, yet no more than
  twelve feet from Lord Ruthven. "Come forth, Signor Davie, this is no place
  for you."</p>

  <p>"It is the place where I have put him," retorted the Queen, haughtily.</p>

  <p>"Let no more be said of that for honour's sake!" exclaimed Ruthven,
  advancing on the Italian, at which the Queen cried out:</p>

  <p>"I command you, as your Sovereign, to leave my chamber!"</p>

  <p>She looked at her husband for a second where he stood motionless by the
  loaded supper-board. His gaze was on Lord Ruthven and his expression
  different from any that she had seen on his face before.</p>

  <p>Robert Stewart and Arthur Erskine had risen in their places. The Queen
  spoke to them, bidding them, in a steady voice, to turn out Lord Ruthven from
  her presence, and they advanced on him, but he shouted out:</p>

  <p>"Do not touch me, for I will not be handled!"</p>

  <p>At this, as if it were a signal, the door into the audience chamber was
  thrown violently open and on the threshold stood Lord Lindsay with eight men
  behind him, all in armour.</p>

  <p>"Am I to be murdered?" demanded the Queen.</p>

  <p>"Madame, we would put down our lives for you," replied Ruthven harshly,
  "but there is one here who must take his punishment."</p>

  <p>At that the Queen placed herself in front of the Italian, who was cowering
  in his corner. Lindsay and his men advanced, knocking over the supper-table
  so that the dishes and meat, the preserved fruits, the lights and the bottles
  of wine were spilled over the skirts of Lady Argyll, who stood dismayed and
  useless between her brother and Arthur Erskine who, seeing they were
  overpowered, remained silent.</p>

  <p>Lord Ruthven, cold and passionless, plucked the Queen away from where she
  stood with arms and skirts outspread in front of the Italian who was
  whimpering and kissing a relic in a crystal case.</p>

  <p>"Take your lady wife, sir," he ordered the King.</p>

  <p>The closet was so crowded that it was impossible for anyone to move. The
  only light was a torch held by a man behind Lindsay, and one candle on a
  sideboard, for most of the candles had gone out with the overturning of the
  table and the soft scented wax had been trampled underfoot with the filigree
  dishes and the sweetmeats, and the glass. But the King moved to the wall and
  held the Queen there against the tapestry.</p>

  <p>Ruthven seized the shrieking Italian, snatched off his cap, and passed him
  to the man behind him as if he had been a rag doll. He was hurled from one to
  another, lurching, plunging, bruised, soon half-naked, bleeding and
  screaming. He was thrust through the press of armed men out into the bedroom
  and so into the Chamber of Presence, while the Queen lay still as a corpse in
  her husband's grasp. She would not submit to the indignity of a useless
  struggle. She closed her eyes as the Italian was dragged past and put her
  fingers to her ears as his screams echoed through the hot room.</p>

  <p>The King released her without a word and followed the other men out of the
  room. A pretty little French clock in the corner struck eight&mdash;the whole
  business had taken no more than five minutes.</p>

  <p>The Queen sank down on the floor. There was one candle burning above the
  low bed in the corner and Lady Argyll made her way to this and from it lit
  several others which she placed on the sideboard.</p>

  <p>The Queen rose and stumbled towards the door in the audience room, but
  this had been bolted.</p>

  <p>"What will they do to him?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"I suppose, madame, they intend to bring him to trial."</p>

  <p>"For what offence?"</p>

  <p>"Madame, come away to the bedchamber. Maybe they will return."</p>

  <p>"Where is your brother?" asked the Queen, "and Arthur Erskine?"</p>

  <p>"Madame, I do not know. They have been forced away with the others."</p>

  <p>"Then we are quite alone?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, madame. Come into the bedchamber."</p>

  <p>Lady Argyll held aloft the candle and the Queen stared down at the
  confusion, the things on the floor, the dishes of agate and mother-of-pearl,
  the lace cloth stained with wine, the dish of preserved plums, and among it a
  twist of grey fur and two thin hands held upward.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Florestan! See, they have killed Florestan!"</p>

  <p>The Queen stooped and gathered up the dead monkey and burst into dry and
  desperate sobs.</p>

  <p>Lady Argyll, who had seen the King's face and who feared that the night's
  work would not be over, drew her mistress into the bedchamber through which
  the Italian had been dragged. The outer door was fastened. Listening there
  Lady Argyll could hear nothing.</p>

  <p>The Queen crouched on the bedstep with the dead monkey wrapped in a linen
  cloth on her knees.</p>

  <p>Lady Argyll could not induce her to move or to speak, although she
  reminded her of her child and begged her for his sake to keep her
  courage.</p>

  <p>But when the bolts of the outer door were drawn the Queen did look up.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps they have come for me now. Light more candles."</p>

  <p>Lady Argyll obeyed with hands that shook like the flames that leapt up
  under them.</p>

  <p>Two men entered the bedchamber&mdash;the King and Lord Ruthven.</p>

  <p>"Well," said the Queen, looking up from where she sat with the dead monkey
  on her lap, "what have you done with David?"</p>

  <p>"Madame," replied Lord Ruthven, "do not speak that name."</p>

  <p>The King passed him and leant against the tester of the bed. "Do you mourn
  for David?" he asked. She answered: "It shall be dear blood to some of you if
  his is spilt."</p>

  <p>The King replied with difficulty:</p>

  <p>"He has had more of you than I for two months. How often have I come to
  your door and been turned away saying you would not or you were sick, while
  he was within?" Then "Oh!" he said, drawing back; "what is that you have on
  your lap?"</p>

  <p>"It is Florestan, who was killed in this brutality."</p>

  <p>"It looks like a child," said the King staring.</p>

  <p>"It is your good luck it's not a child&mdash;yours!"</p>

  <p>"My child!" he sneered, and went to the window where Lord Ruthven sat on a
  great chest and asked for God's sake for a moment of repose and a drink of
  wine for he was a very sick man and had got up from a bed where he had lain
  three weeks to be present at this night's work.</p>

  <p>Lady Argyll, who could scarcely move for fright, went into the little
  closet and found a decanter of wine, filled a horn cup with it and brought it
  back to Lord Ruthven. In between his drinking he stared at the Queen, telling
  her that she should be dutiful to her husband and obey him and not set him
  down for any favourite. And she, not moving, replied:</p>

  <p>"Well, if he had a hand in it I shall leave him."</p>

  <p>Lord Ruthven said that a woman might not leave her husband.</p>

  <p>"Sir," said she, "your wife left you and I might leave my husband."</p>

  <p>At that Lord Ruthven, glancing on the King, who still leant against the
  bed, answered:</p>

  <p>"Think, madame, upon the baseness of this man&mdash;he was a worthless
  creature!"</p>

  <p>There was a great sound in the forecourt and the Queen sprang up, thinking
  it might be a rescue or the Provost who had turned out to see what the uproar
  was at the palace. But Ruthven, with all his feebleness, was quickly in front
  of the window and the King had her by the wrist.</p>

  <p>"I'll go downstairs," she cried. "I'll see who holds the great hall."</p>

  <p>Ruthven answered:</p>

  <p>"Lindsay and his men are dawn there, no one will get in. And, madame, were
  you to force yourself on their company&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" she asked, twisting her wrist in her husband's fingers and with
  the other hand holding the dead monkey as if it were a baby to her breast.
  "Why not? May I not ask help from my city?"</p>

  <p>"There are those who would sooner see you cut in pieces and flung over the
  Abbey wall," replied Ruthven. "If you have killed David&mdash;" she began.
  Thinking of this, and the memory of his shrieks and his eyes as he had
  crouched in the corner, her lips quivered and she began to cry hysterically.
  She reminded them of the powerful relatives she had&mdash;the King of France
  and the Princes of the House of Guise. She told them that she was under the
  protection of the Pope and in the friendship of the King of Spain, "And if
  any harm comes to me or my child for these outrages, you shall answer to
  them."</p>

  <p>Ruthven replied indifferently,</p>

  <p>"Madame, these names are too much for me who am nothing but your humble
  subject. And as for what I have done to-night, I am answerable to God
  alone."</p>

  <p>Then Lady Argyll, whose nerves were strained to breaking-point, cried out
  to the King:</p>

  <p>"In the name of pity, sir, let go of her hand, she will rub the skin off
  her wrist struggling. Think of her state."</p>

  <p>"Who has thought of that?" sighed the Queen. "If I and the child had both
  perished to-night I believe none of you would have been disappointed."</p>

  <p>She sat down on the bed, laying the corpse of Florestan on the pillow, and
  pulling out her kerchief wiped her face, which was damp, and with this
  gesture took off all the pomades and painting. She looked suddenly pale and
  haggard and quite different. She pushed off her coif and ran her fingers
  through her hair and loosened her dress as if she could bear no burden.</p>

  <p>The King looked at her intently with a rising desire. She whispered:</p>

  <p>"Have I no friends? Where is Earl Bothwell and Lord Huntly?"</p>

  <p>Ruthven told her directly.</p>

  <p>"On the tumult first arising they thought themselves too much your friends
  and escaped out of a window and so are gone. There is no help there, madame,
  you must satisfy yourself and take what has happened."</p>

  <p>The Queen looked at the King's belt and saw an empty dagger sheath
  there.</p>

  <p>"Where is your dagger?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He seemed confused and muttered, "I dropped it somewhere, I don't
  know."</p>

  <p>"You have taken your last from me and your farewell," said the Queen.</p>

  <p>Upon which Lord Ruthven scolded:</p>

  <p>"That were a pity. He is Your Majesty's husband and you must yield duty
  each to another. For your honour's sake, madame, make no quarrel about this
  man who was an enemy to nobility, a shame to you and a destruction to Your
  Grace's company. And remember, madame, that the more Your Grace shows
  yourself offended, the more the world will judge the worst."</p>

  <p>All the while the King, leaning on the bed tester, was staring at his
  wife, and Ruthven, not liking the look of him and remembering how fearful he
  and his fellows had always been of this young man's weakness and the woman's
  power over him, plucked him by the sleeve and drew him away, reminding him
  that the commotion in the court continued. It might mean that Bothwell and
  some of his following had returned or that the Provost would not be pacified.
  How did they know what friends she had? Argyll, who should have been here
  with his forces had not yet arrived.</p>

  <p>So they went away and left her alone with Lady Argyll, who was useless
  with fright, and the dead monkey whose blood was staining the pillow. She got
  up and walked about the rooms, and found that on every side she was shut in
  by guards who even filled the corridor, the other side of which slept Mary
  Seaton and the French girls. She was a prisoner in her own house.</p>

  <p>The Italian's body, in which were fifty-six wounds, lay on the chest in
  the porter's lodge. He had been killed in the Chamber of Presence, the Scots
  nobles so crowding upon one another to thrust their knives into him that he
  had been trampled underfoot, his damask gown wrenched from his back, his
  jewels snatched away, his hose torn from knee to ankle. Unrecognizable, a
  heap of clotted blood and naked bones, he had been thrown down the stairs, to
  Lindsay's men who had kicked him to the porter's lodge, the King's dagger
  stuck between his ribs.</p>

  <p>His face was featureless from blood and dirt, from his split skull the
  brains oozed on to his tangled hair. The porter grumbled at the mess in his
  lodgings, but he was glad of the death of the wretched Italian. He fetched a
  sack to put over the corpse and told the grooms and scullions who were
  crowding in the doorway with lanterns to see this sight that it was "fitting
  the rascal should lie there. It was his first bed when he came to Holyrood
  and one given him then, as now, for charity, an ungrateful, insolent
  villain."</p>

  <p>The Queen washed her hands and face. She made an effort to control her
  weakness, her disgust, anger and fear as she would have made one to overcome
  her enemies. She kept telling herself she must think of nothing except how to
  get away, how to escape. Once she could get free of Holyrood she could rally
  her people round her. Every entrance barred, every way guarded, not even her
  women were allowed to pass ...Her thoughts went round and round this fact
  till her senses reeled.</p>

  <p>Lady Argyll had gone out several times on to the stairhead and asked some
  of the men whom she saw coming up and down if the Queen might have her women,
  but she had been bluntly refused. She entreated the Queen to undress and go
  to bed and try to rest for the remainder of this fearful night.</p>

  <p>"Madame, you must think of the child. You ought to think of nothing but
  that."</p>

  <p>"The child is safe enough, do not fear for that," replied the Queen. "I am
  quite calm and resolved, indeed I am. But we must get away from here. Would
  you have thought Lord Bothwell` would have gone? I took him for so brave a
  man! No one comes! Do they leave us all alone? What did you see when you went
  out just now?"</p>

  <p>"Only that the house is full of armed men. I saw Lord Ruthven again,
  looking like death, and Lord Lindsay and Archibald Douglas."</p>

  <p>"Did you hear anything of David?"</p>

  <p>"No, madame. Nor dare I ask. I begged one of them to let the midwife pass,
  I thought at least they could not refuse that. It would have been a chance to
  get a message out. But he said no, all must wait till my Lord Moray
  came."</p>

  <p>"Moray!" breathed the Queen. All the night's events took on a different
  aspect. She had not thought of him. "I might have known these brutes were
  only tools," she said fearfully, then controlled herself. "Moray."</p>

  <p>"Yes, madame. They think he comes to-night or tomorrow morning with my
  Lord Argyll."</p>

  <p>"They must have been lurking very close, waiting for this signal. But you
  will be glad to see your husband, again," said the Queen faintly.</p>

  <p>"Madame! Not if he comes on this bloody business. I fear it is a
  revolt."</p>

  <p>"My brother Moray is a man of peace," said the Queen, still with that thin
  smile on her colourless lips. "He is never present when these ugly deeds are
  done. Do you not remark that? But he may have directed it from afar."</p>

  <p>"He will surely see you, madame, as soon as he arrives. You will be able
  to arrange something with him."</p>

  <p>"He is not my best hope."</p>

  <p>"There is no other, madame."</p>

  <p>"Yes. There is my husband." She spoke these words with such bitterness and
  contempt that the woman who listened winced. "Can you go down softly and find
  him or send him a message and say I wish to see him?" She drew the blood-red
  wedding-ring off her finger and gave it to her companion. "Show him this,
  hold it in the palm of your hand then open the fingers and let him see it.
  Perhaps it is true that he did not know what they intended. If David is dead,
  maybe his jealousy is spent and he will come. Yes, lately I have denied him.
  Did you note how he looked at me?"</p>

  <p>Lady Argyll stared at her, horrified.</p>

  <p>"You want him to come to you to-night?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." With a deliberate smile at her own degradation, she said: "Tell him
  that I will lie with him to-night."</p>

  <p>The Queen went to the tall mirror she had brought with her from France and
  looked at her newly washed face. It was quite colourless, and her hair
  straggled on to her shoulders and hung in wet rings on her high forehead.</p>

  <p>Her dress was all dishevelled, the monkey's blood had stained it across
  the front and the disarray of her heavy brocade skirt showed her pregnancy.
  With steady hands, she adjusted her clothes and out of a great casket stamped
  with fleurs-de-lis, she took out all the pearls she had brought from France
  and hung them on her neck and wrists. With firm strokes she brushed her hair
  and pulled it into a little caul studded with emeralds.</p>

  <p>It was a long time since she had dressed herself, but she found she could
  manage very well without the French girls or Mary Seaton. She took out her
  box of paints and coloured her mouth, put gold dust on her eyebrows, and
  violet powder on her hair, and smoothed her cheeks with orris dust. Then she
  emptied a phial of perfume on to her dress and returning to the bed, picked
  up the corpse of Florestan, kissed it, and laid it beneath the shrine in the
  corner, then turned the pillow and put it with the bloodstains
  underneath.</p>

  <p>She heard his step outside, and looked at herself again in the mirror. She
  was more like a statue than a woman, there was something unnatural in her
  face, in her movements, in the splendour of her over-gaudy clothes and
  jewels.</p>

  <p>He came in, pushing back the door violently with the flat of his hand. He
  was not alone; she could scarcely restrain a cry of fury when she saw
  Ruthven, still in the clanging armour, behind him. No doubt they feared her,
  no doubt they had guessed what she was about to try to do and they would not
  let the fool out of their sight.</p>

  <p>But he, lustful and half-drunk was half-won. His eyes were bright, the
  tension had gone from his face. He was proud and confident again. Yes,
  undoubtedly he had murdered the Italian, she could almost smell blood on
  him.</p>

  <p>He approached the bed, stared at her with reddened eyes and took her hand
  with the one on which he had put the crimson wedding-ring.</p>

  <p>"Lord Ruthven," said the Queen smiling, "you desired me to yield to my
  husband, and so I intend to do. Let to-night's work be overlooked."</p>

  <p>"Your Grace asks us no more of David?" asked Ruthven, leaning exhausted in
  the tall doorway.</p>

  <p>"I ask no more of anything," said the Queen steadily. "Leave me with my
  husband that I may make my pact and peace with him."</p>

  <p>She smiled at the young man and asked: "You'll stay?" He replied thickly:
  "Then I may pass the night with you?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, but Ruthven had advanced and gripped him by the arm.</p>

  <p>"Sir, you must show yourself below. There are those who are not satisfied.
  They want to speak to you that you may answer for the Queen."</p>

  <p>The King hesitated, then was swayed by the stronger will.</p>

  <p>"I'll return," he muttered to his wife. "In a few minutes, maybe half an
  hour, I'll return. If you'll be kind at last, and let me lie with you."</p>

  <p>She moved after him heavily and detained him as Lord Ruthven passed into
  the ante-chamber. She touched the red ring on his finger, whispering,
  entreating:</p>

  <p>"Remember the night at Stirling when I gave you that. I shall wait for
  you."</p>

  <p>She saw the colour rise into his face and eyes, the veins in his neck
  swell. She could smell the wine on his breath and she looked again at the
  empty dagger sheath.</p>

  <p>"I'll wait," she repeated before Ruthven pulled him away.</p>

  <p>When they had gone Lady Argyll could not restrain herself from reproaching
  her mistress, "Oh, madame, how can you let him stay with you to-night! He was
  in that business if ever a man was. Signor David has been murdered, I dare
  swear. Oh, madame, it is not many hours past since we heard him shrieking!
  Can you forget?"</p>

  <p>The Queen shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Undress me! Do me this service for they will not let the girls or Mary
  Seaton come to me. See, poor Florestan beneath his shrine&mdash;he looks
  almost human in his shroud. I suppose David lies like that now, with just as
  many wounds, battered so beneath their feet. He had no absolution, not as
  much as a Cross to kiss ..."</p>

  <p>"Madame, you must put that out of your mind. Yet to allow the
  King&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Get me my nightgown with the cypress border. This is the bed I had at
  Stirling. I thought to use another but my mother loved this."</p>

  <p>Lady Argyll could only suppose that her mistress was unwell in her mind
  for such a triviality at such a moment to interest her. She helped the Queen
  take off all her jewels and her dress and get into her nightgown with the
  border of golden cypress. She was embarrassed but overawed. When the Queen
  had undressed she began to shiver violently, went to the shrine, knelt beside
  Florestan and made the sign of the Cross over the small corpse.</p>

  <p>"I do this for David," she said. "God has mercy upon strange
  creatures."</p>

  <p>Then she climbed into the sumptuous bed and lay there telling Lady Argyll
  to go out to her own apartment. "Leave the rest of this night to me."</p>

  <p>The Queen waited with one candle on the side table. The bed no longer
  seemed to her as it had seemed in Stirling. It had become a mausoleum
  enclosing her for ever in solitude.</p>

  <p>She almost savoured her humiliation. David had been a coward. She had
  noted his fear when he had seen Ruthven in the doorway of the stairs, she had
  heard his shrieks, he had got behind her and held out her skirts to protect
  himself. They were right, he was no better than Florestan, who stole and
  picked and was insolent and fled at a cross word. She felt an infinite
  compassion for both of them. Though she admired, above all virtues, courage,
  she had been fond of this man who had had none. She put her hands to her side
  to feel the weight of the child. She was already avenged there. Stewart would
  never be sure that the heir to Scotland was his.</p>

  <p>The candles burnt out, the winter dawn light slid between the stiff
  curtains of the window. The Queen remained alone.</p>

  <p>In the chamber below, the King sprawled in a drunken stupor. When Ruthven
  had brought him down from his wife's room the word had got round to the Lords
  in possession of the palace that the woman was setting her traps. The sick
  man, with his last ounce of strength told the conspirators that the Queen had
  attired herself in pearls and brocade and painted her face and persuaded the
  King to lie with her and that he had consented.</p>

  <p>So they pulled him, already sagging from drink, into his own room and
  Ruthven, who knew of many such tricks, put a potion into the wine they forced
  on him, so that after two or three cups he sank between them, utterly
  drunk.</p>

  <p>The two Antony Standens, who acted under the direction of Lord Ruthven,
  then heaved him up and laid him on his bed under the grim scrutiny of the
  Lords. Then they went below into the entrance place and into the forecourts
  to wait for the coming of Lord Moray and Argyll, the two men who should take
  the lead in this disorder. The Earl Morton had arrived at the palace soon
  after the murder, at which he appeared very well satisfied.</p>

  <p>So they took their repose, David in the porter's lodge, the King drugged
  on his couch, the Queen waiting in her bed.</p>

  <p>The King woke, still feeling half-drugged. He yawned and sat up, saw his
  gentlemen moving about the room and called for water and drank avidly. Then
  he remembered with a sudden shock, the Queen's promise of last night and how
  he had not gone to her.</p>

  <p>So, without a word to anyone, he went up the newel stair and into her room
  where she lay quite alone in the great bed with the corpse of the monkey
  beneath the shrine in the corner. In her hand, stretched slack on the
  coverlet, was a little reliquary which she looked at now and then.</p>

  <p>The young man sat down by the bed and in a broken voice began to reason
  with her and to excuse himself, but she did not reply and pretended to be
  asleep. He began to plead with her, reminding her that though he might be of
  low estate compared to hers yet at the altar she had promised to be obedient
  to him. He said that his life had been like hell from loneliness,
  humiliation, and frustration. He could never have a game of cards with her
  but that David must be the third, or sing a song but that David must play the
  accompaniment ...As he said that name she opened her eyes and asked:</p>

  <p>"What has become of David?"</p>

  <p>"David is dead." He said it sullenly.</p>

  <p>Then he wanted to lie down beside her, reminding her of her promise last
  night, but she shook her head and pretended to sleep again.</p>

  <p>The young man knelt on the bedstep, thinking of the night in Stirling and
  began to weep softly for so much gone wrong. The killing of the Italian had
  been like the lancing of an abscess, leaving him relieved. He began to hope
  that everything might be as it had been and even that the child might be his,
  which was a thing that he had never believed though he had struggled to do
  so.</p>

  <p>The Queen remained immobile like a creature in a trance. She whispered
  from the pillow:</p>

  <p>"Last night I might have received you, but now I am bankrupt of every good
  grace." Then she asked him in a stifled voice if he in truth had been in the
  affair last night. He would not commit himself, but admitted sullenly that
  the men who now held the palace were his friends.</p>

  <p>There was a scratching at the door&mdash;it was Lady Argyll, still in the
  dress she had worn last night. She said that Lord Moray had come to the
  palace and wanted to speak to the Queen, who sat up.</p>

  <p>"Is he your master?" she asked of her kneeling husband.</p>

  <p>The young man did not understand her and the Queen asked Lady Argyll to
  help her from the bed. Without any regard for her attire she took up a winter
  coat of fur and velvet, and leaning on Lady Argyll's arm went into the
  Chamber of Presence, where it was very cold for the fire had gone out.</p>

  <p>The Queen looked down at the floor and saw a trail of dark spots and
  stains across the carpet, past the throne and the dais to the outer door.</p>

  <p>Lord Moray stood by the hearth which was filled with cold ashes. His
  sister, Lady Argyll, turned on him at once, crying out against the horrible
  murder last night, and the extremity the Queen was in and how she had been in
  fear of her own life and that of her child also.</p>

  <p>Moray allowed Lady Argyll to rail on in her fear and anger. He frowned at
  the Queen who sat on the steps of the dais with her mantle wrapped round her
  and her hair hanging down over the fur collar saying nothing.</p>

  <p>"Mary," he said, "I am sorry to see you in this distress."</p>

  <p>"Ah, if you had been at home perhaps I had not been so discourteously
  handled," she replied. Then, in the same tone: "But were you in it?"</p>

  <p>He evaded the direct question as she might have known that he would. She
  had lost much of her sharpness.</p>

  <p>"It had to be done, but I would that it had been done in another manner.
  You might have lost your life," he said, seeming deeply troubled.</p>

  <p>"Well," said the Queen, "you are welcome. Be a good subject to me and I
  will behave to you as I ought."</p>

  <p>There was nothing in her words or gesture to make him think that she
  recalled how she had driven him out of her kingdom as a rebel and issued a
  Proclamation forbidding any man to offer him shelter or even as much as a
  plate of porridge. Her tone admitted him to be the master, as if she knew
  that he must be wherever he went&mdash;his sudden coming now proved his hand
  in last night's business.</p>

  <p>The King appeared in the bedchamber door. Moray spoke to him in a tone of
  authority, bidding his Grace, for his honour's sake to clear his wife's house
  of so much soldiery and to help the Lords to go back to their houses so that
  the tumult in the city might be put down before it got out of hand. And the
  King, with his eyes on his wife, replied that the Lords would not go on his
  orders.</p>

  <p>"Sir," said Moray, with little heed of this excuse, "go down and answer to
  these gentlemen for your wife. Say that all has been arranged in amity with
  her, that she will grant an amnesty and full pardon to all who have offended.
  Do you not see," he added as the young man hesitated, "that this is a
  dangerous moment and that there is much to be forgotten?"</p>

  <p>Thereupon the King moved away down the Chamber of Presence, and the Queen
  began to laugh hysterically and on top of the laughter to weep so that when
  the door closed on her husband she was shaken by sudden tears.</p>

  <p>"Am I to forgive these men? You know what they did last night? Never have
  I lived through hours so full of horror. I had rather died, yes, James, I had
  rather died myself."</p>

  <p>He stood near her struggling to hold himself in check and she, even
  through her tears, realized this, and rising, threw herself into his arms and
  wept on his shoulder as if there had never been discord between them and he
  had always been her chosen guardian.</p>

  <p>"Madame, cast off your care and passion, I beg you humbly. I shall study
  what may be best for your safety and honour. I promise that you will receive
  from your subjects obedience and honour if only you will take to heart this
  lesson."</p>

  <p>He put her away from him and looked down into her face. "Before God, Mary,
  I renew my offer which I made before."</p>

  <p>"All these conspirators, then, all these confederate Lords, are friends of
  yours?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I do not say so, Mary, nor that they worked under my orders. I have been
  in England."</p>

  <p>"I know something of your doings," said the Queen. "We infringe on
  politics. You say that you can answer for these men if I pardon them?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, for I know their grievances and their minds. Now for yourself you
  see to what dishonour your whims can bring you. I call them whims, Mary, I
  would not use an uglier word."</p>

  <p>He took her by the shoulder and turned her about so that she was forced to
  face him.</p>

  <p>"The child?" he demanded. "The child is Scotland's rightful heir?"</p>

  <p>"I can swear it before God," she answered readily.</p>

  <p>He thought she lied, but he was relieved that she had such an answer so
  readily. Yet he could not be satisfied and pressed her further.</p>

  <p>"You know what has been thought and said. It was not that man lying
  below?"</p>

  <p>"Ah! you've seen him?" she asked softly. "That man lying below! Poor
  David! James, they killed my monkey in the struggle&mdash;poor Florestan, who
  was so neat and clever. Will you take him out and see him buried?"</p>

  <p>She went back to her room and Moray returned to the Lords gathered in
  various groups in the palace, unsure what to do. He told them that the Queen
  would pardon them and hold them immune from punishment in the future. She had
  promised as much to himself, he said, and the King confirmed this with an
  oath saying she would do as he bid. Moray added that they might do more than
  demand pardon for the outrage done in her house and even exact from her
  further concessions for the Protestants and a promise to have no more Mass
  performed in Holyrood and no more foreign favourites. He, Moray, once more
  master of Scotland, would see that she kept these promises.</p>

  <p>Lady Argyll came to her brother, Lord Moray, and implored that a midwife
  and some women might be sent to the Queen for she had fallen ill and seemed
  to be losing her strength. It could be that her child was to be born before
  its time endangering her life, and seeing that she had pardoned the Lords and
  granted their requests, surely the guards might be moved from her door and
  Mary Seaton and the French girls, at least, allowed to go in freely?</p>

  <p>Moray granted that but said that the Queen must not come out of her
  chamber. Many of the Lords disliked even this concession and said she seemed
  strong enough and perhaps her sickness was only a pretence.</p>

  <p>Then the Queen sent for Sir William Maitland and tried to persuade him,
  saying she had promised pardon and was that not enough? Might she not go away
  to, say, Dunbar? While she spoke she was wondering what part this crafty man
  had had in the murder of David and how much he was her enemy. But this she
  could not discover, and although he was gentle and almost humble her tears
  and entreaties did not move him. He told her that the Lords would not allow
  her to leave the palace, which was still heavily guarded so that there was
  only one way by which she could escape and that was through the newel
  staircase by which the murderers had entered which led through her husband's
  rooms and beyond them out into the garden and the old burial-ground.</p>

  <p>About the middle of the afternoon there was a scratch at the door of the
  room where Giuseppe Rizzio had been cowering all night. The boy stifled an
  instinctive shriek with the back of his hand. The scratching was repeated and
  as it seemed timid, almost apprehensive, and in no way associated with
  violence, he found courage to rise from his bed and creep to the door.</p>

  <p>In a voice shaking with fear he asked who was there. A wheezy female voice
  replied: "A friend!"</p>

  <p>Giuseppe hesitated, fearing a trap, but he realized his own desperate
  situation. He could not for ever remain a prisoner in his room without water
  or food, so he slipped the bolts with fingers that fumbled at the first
  attempts and stared out into the dimly-lit corridor, and what he saw
  reassured him. A stout woman of about forty stood there. She had a bundle on
  her arm and panted from quick walking. Giuseppe knew her as Lady Reres and
  also as a woman of bad reputation who had lately been shown some favours by
  the Queen.</p>

  <p>She pushed past the boy without an invitation and sank on to the painted
  chest inside the door which he again bolted.</p>

  <p>"Listen! You know what happened?"</p>

  <p>Giuseppe nodded and quick tears over-brimmed his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Bah!" said Lady Reres, striking her fat thigh with a podgy hand. "What is
  done is done and there is plenty of work for the future without thinking over
  the past. I suppose you want to get out of here?"</p>

  <p>Giuseppe nodded, his throat and lips were dry, he could hardly speak,
  especially this foreign tongue with which he was so little familiar. He
  strained his attention to catch what the fat woman said.</p>

  <p>"The Queen's a prisoner, boy, do you hear? Moray and Maitland are in
  charge now. It seems the other Lords are only their tools. That is a pretty
  state of affairs, is it not? The Queen has had to pardon all the
  murderers."</p>

  <p>"She pardoned the men who killed David?"</p>

  <p>"She had to. In the Chamber of Presence where his blood had hardly been
  wiped up they went on their knees and asked for pardon. She said she bore no
  malice to any of them and what was done was done. They allowed the midwife to
  go in to her and she sent her out with a letter to me. The Queen has no hope
  but in one man and, to him you must take a message."</p>

  <p>The Italian began to shake. He did not want to do anything that was
  difficult or responsible. Lady Reres observed his fear and exclaimed
  contemptuously:</p>

  <p>"Ha! What do you think will happen to you, shut away here? Presently they
  will remember you and hunt you out, but for an hour or two they will not
  think of you; they are busy ransacking your brother's chamber."</p>

  <p>"Ah! poor David, all his fine clothes and savings!"</p>

  <p>"Ay, indeed, too much of either for his credit's sake," sneered Lady
  Reres. "I hear they have found two thousand crowns in gold hidden away,
  together with jewels and many suits of velvet and furs. Fourteen pairs of
  hose!" She rocked to and fro, laughing, her hands on her fat sides. Then,
  recollecting her business, she gave her bundle, which she had dropped on the
  floor on her entrance, a kick towards the boy.</p>

  <p>"Put that on, it is a set of girl's garments. With a kerchief tied over
  your head you should pass as a washer-maid, and be able to set out without
  question. Here!" From her enormous bosom she drew a letter. "It is a message
  you are to deliver. You are to wait for the answer and bring it back to me in
  the Exchequer House, where I shall be waiting. You had better be honest and
  quick, for your life depends upon this, too."</p>

  <p>"To whom am I to deliver the letter, madame?"</p>

  <p>"To Earl Bothwell. You will find him at Earl Huntly's house. You know
  where that is, or can easily find out. If Earl Bothwell is not there you will
  give it to Lord Huntly. If Lord Huntly is not there to Lord Sutherland, and
  if you can find none of them you must run round till you do."</p>

  <p>Giuseppe did not like this errand at all. He was quite unnerved by his
  brother's murder, and by the night he had just spent. He reached to the bed
  and picked up the crucifix.</p>

  <p>"Earl Bothwell is a son of Satan," he muttered. "I do not want to get into
  his power. I have heard such stories of him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ay, I suppose so," replied Lady Reres comfortably, "among the scullions
  and grooms who used to be your company there would be such tales. Ah, well,
  if he has any infernal arts they may be useful now."</p>

  <p>She smiled, nodded, and turned away with the air of one whose business is
  done and Giuseppe Rizzio remembered, with a shock of fear, that she also was
  credited with being a witch.</p>

  <p>Lord Moray was not much given to laughter, but he had a dry humour and
  this was tickled by the situation in which he found himself, as he returned
  to his house in the palace grounds where his wife, Agnes Keith, had lived
  during his rebellion.</p>

  <p>He was master again, of the Queen of Scotland, after being completely
  defeated in the field and forced to fly to the English Court. The Queen's
  foolish flirtation had after all caused only a short interruption in his rule
  of her kingdom. She had, with her armed men, chased him from town to town and
  across the Border, and when she had felt herself safe he had suddenly walked
  into her palace, master of all she possessed, even her life.</p>

  <p>The main part of their quarrel had been her inexplicable marriage and he
  had used that marriage as a weapon against her, employing her infatuated
  young husband as an instrument to remove her favourite.</p>

  <p>Moray had not been able to live in peace while David Rizzio breathed. But
  he had gone, and the Queen, who had defied him had flung herself sobbing into
  his arms and begged him humbly for the meanest favours, the company of her
  woman, the removal of her guards, a little liberty, the attendance of a
  midwife in her distress.</p>

  <p>He had exacted handsome terms. She was to pardon all his accomplices who
  in his absence had done the dirty work for him. She was to restore him to all
  his estates, and Maitland to his power, and Morton to the full exercise of
  his office of which he had been lately deprived.</p>

  <p>He greeted his wife tenderly and listened with an affectionate smile while
  she pleaded for the Queen. Agnes Keith insisted that she had no knowledge of
  politics, nor could she greatly commend the Queen's behaviour, but, she
  argued, the Queen was generous and kind, it was impossible to dislike
  her.</p>

  <p>"Look how I have lived, sir, while you were a proclaimed rebel&mdash;used
  with every courtesy, living here like a princess, allowed to touch your
  revenues, maintain your liveries on my servants, received into her intimacy.
  And the same with Lady Argyll, your sister, whose husband was in arms against
  her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That is his business, I have other things to think of. Do not upset
  yourself, madame, I shall deal generously with the Queen."</p>

  <p>It gave him great pleasure to say these words; it gave him intense
  satisfaction to think that it was in his power to fulfil that boast&mdash;to
  save the Queen.</p>

  <p>Sir William Maitland waited on Lord Moray to decide exactly what they
  should do. David was dead, the Lords were indemnified, the Queen was a
  prisoner, repentant, submissive to all their demands. Everything might be as
  it had been before the Queen's marriage, except that they would have more
  power over her&mdash;they might even force her to change her religion.</p>

  <p>But Moray, walking up and down the darkening room said there was one
  difficulty&mdash;King Henry. They had used him as an instrument of their
  revenge, as an instrument of their recall but, once again, was he an
  instrument that might break in their hands?</p>

  <p>Their eyes met.</p>

  <p>"He answered for his wife," said Maitland. "He said she was a true
  princess and would keep her word. That was when Ruthven and Lindsay
  mistrusted her promises. They fear her cunning and his weakness&mdash;it
  seems they were reconciled last night within a few hours of the making away
  of the servant David. Had not Ruthven doctored his drink he would have gone
  with her."</p>

  <p>Moray did not answer. He put his hand over his tired eyes. He had ridden
  hard in the last few hours and not slept at all since he had come to
  Holyrood, but his mind was still alert.</p>

  <p>"Can she forgive him?" urged Maitland.</p>

  <p>"She might pretend to do so. She has chosen him as her husband and now she
  must keep him. She promised him the Crown Matrimonial in return for our
  recall. Let him have it, he will scarcely interfere in serious affairs. He
  only wants a sham dignity&mdash;call him Grace and Majesty and doff the cap
  and it is enough. He'll be away with his sports, his hawks and hounds, and
  his English friends."</p>

  <p>"Can he forgive her?" asked Maitland. "We deal with a man and a woman
  although we name them King and Queen. They are very young and the Queen I
  know to be vindictive."</p>

  <p>"Her claws are cut, her sting is drawn, her vindictiveness will spend
  itself as her other passions have. Rizzio will be forgotten as others were
  forgotten."</p>

  <p>The names of John Gordon and Chastelard hung in the air, but neither men
  spoke them.</p>

  <p>"Can he forgive her? I do not know, but she is young and beautiful, and
  soon it seems brought him to her side again&mdash;two hours after David's
  death, you say?" Moray thrust off that thought with a frown.</p>

  <p>"Surely," he said, "I can manage Henry Stewart, and his father, too, and
  all the Lennox faction. If they go warily they will have no cause for
  complaint."</p>

  <p>Maitland shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I do not think it quite as easy as that. She is very subtle." Then he
  asked directly: "What of the child? Do you know anything of that?"</p>

  <p>Again the two men looked at each other.</p>

  <p>"It is Scotland's heir," said Moray distinctly, and Maitland nodded. "It
  is the Queen's child and will be born in full safety and honour. And anyone
  who dares to think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Maitland's thin, dry smile completed the sentence. "So be it."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps out of all of this," mused Moray, "the child alone is important.
  If we look beyond this present chaos the only thing that matters is that
  these two kingdoms be united, and in the child we have a definite hope?"</p>

  <p>Maitland asked delicately:</p>

  <p>"But if the King should not acknowledge it? Remember that he has spoken
  his opinion on this matter."</p>

  <p>"He must be brought to discretion," said Moray. "I stayed a little too
  long upon the road," he added. "They outran their instructions in letting it
  be done in her presence. That was wrong, Maitland, that might have killed
  her. We might have lost the child too."</p>

  <p>Maitland countered crisply: "And there would have been a throne vacant for
  you, so what would it have mattered?"</p>

  <p>"I am ready to take the throne if occasion arise, but I would not have it
  done like that. Why could not the fellow have been taken from his
  lodgings?"</p>

  <p>"They would have had it so. Even fanatics like Patrick Ruthven would not
  have had it in the Queen's pre-sense, but it was the King, he willed it. He
  wanted her shamed."</p>

  <p>"But it could have been so easily done without involving her at all," said
  Moray. "I'd like to punish him for that. I'll never forgive him for
  that."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, I am not sure of him. He drinks very heavily and his father
  encourages his arrogance. Plainly, he is a fool."</p>

  <p>"To-night," said Moray, "in an hour or so, when we can go quietly, we will
  wait upon him in his chamber and tell him our mind, our terms."</p>

  <p>The King was alone in his room that night with John Taylor, his
  chamber-boy, with whom he played cards to distract himself. The relief he had
  felt at the removal of David had gradually changed into apprehension for the
  future. He did not like the instant appearance of Moray, although it had been
  part of the bargain that he should call him and his friends from banishment.
  The presence of the dark, silent man directing him and his fortunes,
  disturbed the young man.</p>

  <p>Then, he had been greatly moved by the Queen's tears and protestations and
  half-induced to believe that after all there had been nothing but a
  flirtation with David. Then again, his slowly moving mind would remember all
  the things found in the Italian's room.</p>

  <p>Where had he got all those furs and rich cloths? Where had he obtained two
  thousand pounds in gold while he, the King, was straitened in his revenues
  and often had not enough to pay his servants? The Queen would not make him
  any allowance; she had had an iron stamp prepared so that his signature could
  be put on papers without his reading them. She had taken his name off the
  coinage, she had ignored, insulted, and humiliated him in every way,
  meanwhile David the servant had lived like a king himself.</p>

  <p>Henry Stewart threw down the cards, stuck his thumbs in his belt and leant
  back in his chair while his chamber-boy waited expectantly to snuff the tall,
  scented candles.</p>

  <p>Well, David was finished. The young King tried to still his jealousies,
  his doubts with that: and the Queen had humbled herself to him! She had been
  meek and gentle as that night at Stirling, she had sent him the little red
  ring, she had vowed that she would be an honest and faithful wife, she had
  sworn that the child was his ...</p>

  <p>"Sir," whispered John Taylor, leaning across the table, "There is a
  tapping at the privy door."</p>

  <p>"Spies?" Henry Darnley moved suddenly and listened. "I think it is only a
  mouse or a rat." He put his hand on the weapon at his waist, for he lived in
  continual fear.</p>

  <p>John Taylor went to the door of the newel stair up which last night the
  murderers had ascended, and drew the bolts. The King rose and stood on
  guard.</p>

  <p>"Madame," whispered John Taylor, and opened the door wide.</p>

  <p>It was the Queen who entered. She wore a horseman's cloak that came to her
  feet and her hair was gathered into a round cap without a feather.</p>

  <p>"You said I never came to you, sir," she murmured, "well, I have come to
  you to-night. See, here I am." She smiled faintly. "I cannot now wear a
  page's dress, but I am well disguised."</p>

  <p>He set a chair for her and stared at her. She seemed so strange, different
  from any aspect of her he had known before as she loosened the cloak about
  her neck and looked up at him with appealing eyes.</p>

  <p>"You and I must understand each other, my husband. We are in great
  peril."</p>

  <p>"I?" he asked stupidly, "I?"</p>

  <p>"Moray is master," she reminded him, "you have been nothing but his tool.
  Henry, you are only the marionette, my brother pulls one string and Maitland
  the other, and you jerk your legs and arms."</p>

  <p>"It is not true," he cried. "You would set me down and shame me. What I
  did I did."</p>

  <p>"Did you do it?" she asked, "No, I think not. You are a gentleman and you
  love me a little&mdash;or did once, and I do not think that you ordered those
  men to murder that poor wretch in front of me who am expecting your
  child."</p>

  <p>He stood silent, ashamed, wishing now he had not done the thing or done it
  in another way, and full of mistrust of Moray and Maitland whom he had always
  hated.</p>

  <p>"Do you think," she asked softly, "that my brother would ever be your
  friend? It was because of my marriage with you that I quarrelled with him,
  and Maitland followed him, and Morton is his right-hand man and he is
  hand-in-glove with Patrick Ruthven, and Lindsay is his brother-in-law. All
  this is his design and you have but been his cat's-paw if you did this."</p>

  <p>"It is not true," he replied. "I have not done their will."</p>

  <p>"Then you are not guilty of this cruel murder?"</p>

  <p>"No!" he said, wishing to shine in her eyes. "No! Although certainly I
  know the rascals who&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Know them no more," she said, "for David is dead. Gone, like a puffed-out
  candle. But I am left to be saved, I and the child." As he stared at her she
  added: "We are prisoners, you and I, Harry. It is only because they are so
  sure of you that I was able to come down to your room. Every other way is
  guarded."</p>

  <p>"Hush!" said the chamber-boy. "Oh, madame and my lord, there is someone
  talking at the entrance to the audience chamber where the Antony Standens
  keep watch."</p>

  <p>The Queen, quick and soft, said instantly:</p>

  <p>"It is someone from Moray. Be careful, for I can guess all they want to
  say to you. They come to warn you, perhaps to threaten. Go to them now, then
  return to me, return here, my love. Say nothing. Remember, I am
  concealed."</p>

  <p>He stared at her, bewildered by her swiftness, alarmed by what she said,
  which he had an inkling was true. He sent the chamber-boy to find out who was
  this late visitor, and when John Taylor returned he said that Moray and Sir
  William Maitland begged a few words with the King's Grace.</p>

  <p>The Queen smiled in sad triumph. This served her purpose very well. She
  was seldom lucky, but this was a fortunate chance. She looked at the little
  watch which hung at her waist. There was plenty of time!</p>

  <p>"Return to me as quickly as you can," she said affectionately and with
  confidence, as if she and her husband were and always had been firm
  allies.</p>

  <p>He was moved by her grace, her tired beauty, her trust in him, and
  encouraged, he went into the Chamber of Presence where the Antony Standens
  had lighted more candles and faced Lord Moray and Sir William Maitland, who
  greeted him in a casual and pleasant fashion.</p>

  <p>As he told them roughly to be seated with a curtness that covered his
  uneasiness, his hatred and suspicion of them increased. He knew that he was
  slow-witted, that other men used this for their advantage. He was aware that
  he had no head for intrigue and was always outwitted. He hated these two who
  had tried from the first to prevent him from marrying the Queen. They, he was
  sure, were responsible for the fact that he could get no revenues settled on
  him, and though they had now promised him the Crown Matrimonial he did not
  believe that they would give it to him.</p>

  <p>He respected, though half-consciously, his wife's intelligence, and her
  warnings rang in his ears as he listened to Moray, who spoke quite directly,
  without troubling to use much graciousness or tact, for, to his former
  dislike of the youth was a revulsion added by the manner of the Italian's
  death.</p>

  <p>"Sir William Maitland and I want to know from your own lips how we stand.
  You have aspired to the Crown Matrimonial and it has been promised to you.
  One who offended the dignity of all of us has been removed, but your mind as
  to the future is not clear to us."</p>

  <p>"Why should I make it so?" demanded Henry Stewart, thrusting his hands
  into his belt and standing defiant and insolent before them.</p>

  <p>"Because, sir, without us you are nothing," replied Moray smiling, "and
  with us you might become King indeed."</p>

  <p>"Why do you come here so late and what do you demand of me?"</p>

  <p>"We come late, sire," put in Sir William Maitland with his pleasant smile,
  "because recently events are hurried. We must have a settled policy."</p>

  <p>"Damn all your policies!" said Henry Stewart, "I have done what I have
  done."</p>

  <p>"I have a kingdom to govern," said Moray.</p>

  <p>"You! That sounds to me rebel's talk."</p>

  <p>"It matters little what it sounds to Your Grace. What we must know is,
  will you acquiesce in our policies? Will you reinstate our friends in their
  estates and honours? Will you protect the true Church and curb the
  Papists?"</p>

  <p>"Will I, in short, be subservient to you in all you suggest?"</p>

  <p>"That was my meaning," said Moray. "Look you, sir, in the Italian's room
  were found packets of letters addressed to foreigners, and they were sent to
  their destination unlooked-upon, untampered with, but that correspondence is
  at an end. I stand for an alliance with England. You, as the King, must
  support me."</p>

  <p>"And what of the Queen?" asked Henry Stewart pointedly.</p>

  <p>"The Queen, sir, is your wife and you must see that she is a submissive
  one."</p>

  <p>Moray spoke in an expressionless tone which seemed to the young man who
  listened to be full of malice.</p>

  <p>The Queen then was right. These men only wanted to use him, to fool him.
  He was not fitted for kingship and they knew it. They wished to make him a
  figurehead. To try them further he asked:</p>

  <p>"And what do I get for my obedience? The name of King, a pension, and
  leave to play my games in peace?"</p>

  <p>"Sir," smiled Sir William Maitland, "that is very neatly put."</p>

  <p>The young man whitened with fury to think that these two did not trouble
  to disguise their disdain.</p>

  <p>"If I should go my own way and defy you both?" he asked, bluntly.</p>

  <p>Moray did not reply except by a scarcely perceptible lift of the
  shoulders. But Sir William Maitland said:</p>

  <p>"Sir, what would happen could scarcely be put into words, but if Your
  Grace should take the headlong course, why, he who gallops in the dark will
  soon fall."</p>

  <p>"Warned and threatened!" said Henry Stewart grimly. "Well, gentlemen, no
  doubt I shall have the good sense to take your advice."</p>

  <p>He stood staring and smiling until they had taken their leave and the
  Antony Standens had closed the door on them. Then he went back into the
  bedchamber where the Queen waited.</p>

  <p>During this interview in the outer room the Queen had sat with her watch
  in her hand, staring at the slow-moving hands. Everything depended upon him.
  If she could not win him over she was quite lost. She could see no hope
  anywhere.</p>

  <p>When he returned to her she looked up from the watch and saw at once by
  his face that she had won. She drew a great breath and began, before he could
  speak, to go over her plans.</p>

  <p>"So, you have got rid of them. They came to spy but they never guessed
  that I was here. In half an hour's time Arthur Erskine will be with horses
  beyond the church and we can escape, you and I. We should be at Dunbar
  to-night and from there we could call up the country. I had twelve thousand
  men before and more now perhaps, and we'll send them over the Border again,
  Harry."</p>

  <p>"How will you manage this?" he asked. She had so much to bear, he thought.
  Truly some magic about her made her impossible to resist. He felt it as
  strongly now in a moment of danger and distress, as he had felt it when she
  had leaned to him from between the curtains of the bed at Stirling.</p>

  <p>She told him simply of her trick with the midwife and Lady Reres and a boy
  (she did not name David's brother), who had taken a message to Bothwell and
  Huntly.</p>

  <p>"Those two!" His quick jealousy flared up; she had favoured Bothwell far
  too much lately.</p>

  <p>"Those two. There is no other beside Lord Bothwell who would dare to do
  this," she said. "He has arranged all, sent me a message, he says I can rely
  on him. He saved my mother more than once. Well, what are you going to
  do&mdash;send your chamberman after Moray and betray me? Then I shall
  die&mdash;I and the child will die, Harry, and where will you be among these
  men who hate you?"</p>

  <p>He stood hesitating, miserable.</p>

  <p>"Do you want me to betray them all?" he asked. "What danger shall I stand
  in if I do?"</p>

  <p>"Betray!" She snatched at the word. "But if you did not organize this
  murder, whom have you to betray? You too have been wronged and outraged in my
  person. Come with me"&mdash;she took his hand boldly&mdash;"and I will make
  you a king indeed, not the puppet of these plotters."</p>

  <p>Still he hesitated. Either way he was reluctant to move. He was
  bewildered, confused and exhausted. He longed to be free of Moray and
  Maitland, to play on them a trick like this would please him. But
  Bothwell&mdash;the worst man in Scotland. The Queen said quickly, watching
  his face:</p>

  <p>"Lord Bothwell loves his young wife whom I gave him awhile ago, and it is
  for her sake that he takes pity on a woman."</p>

  <p>This suggestion calmed the young man. Jane Gordon was twenty years old, a
  few weeks married. Perhaps it was stupid to be jealous of Bothwell.</p>

  <p>"Why do you hesitate?" urged the Queen, hardly able to keep the agony out
  of her voice. "We cannot delay much longer, the horses will be there, it must
  be done now, now!"</p>

  <p>"I am confused, I don't know which way to turn nor what to think. If only
  I could trust you!"</p>

  <p>"What would make it clear to you, Harry? What would convince you?"</p>

  <p>"If I thought you loved me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She rose and put her arms round his neck without hesitation, and with what
  seemed genuine passion, said:</p>

  <p>"I do love you, Harry, that's why I want to help you escape from those who
  hate us both. Don't you understand?"</p>

  <p>He put his arms around her and with a sigh caressed her.</p>

  <p>"Well, then, I will come with you."</p>

  <p>She quickly disengaged herself from his embrace, but kept hold of his hand
  and turned to John Taylor. "Run up the secret stairway quickly, find Mary
  Seaton, she is waiting for this signal. She is to come too. Remind
  her&mdash;the jewels, that she brings them all."</p>

  <p>The boy obeyed. The Queen turned to her husband.</p>

  <p>"Take your pistols, put on something dark. We must go out this way. You
  will have all the keys, I suppose? Through the church and the burial-ground.
  There they will be waiting."</p>

  <p>John Taylor returned with Mary Seaton, who wore a long, dark cloak under
  which she half concealed a small lantern.</p>

  <p>"Help me, Harry," said the Queen, "for I am very tired."</p>

  <p>She took her husband's arm on which she leaned heavily, while the
  chamber-boy found the pistols and a black riding-cloak and gave them to his
  master.</p>

  <p>Cold and quiet, the ruined Abbey church of Holy Cross stood partly
  roofless to the sky. The Queen made her way through the deserted choir, past
  the empty stone window-frames and out into the burial-ground of the Kings of
  Scotland.</p>

  <p>For a second she paused beside her father's tomb and, touching her
  husband's arm, asked where David was buried? He was shocked that she should
  speak of this and muttered that he did not know.</p>

  <p>"Well," said the Queen, "that's the last time you'll hear of him from me,
  and as for his grave, no doubt wherever it be, one more splendid will lie
  beside him before the year is out."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by that?" he asked, holding her close, "what do you mean
  by that?"</p>

  <p>"I thought of Moray," she whispered.</p>

  <p>They passed on in the light of the small lantern which Mary Seaton held
  under an outspread, flap of her coat.</p>

  <p>They would have a long start. Lady Argyll and Lady Reres and the midwife
  would keep the Queen's chambers as long as possible into the next day and the
  Antony Standens and John Taylor would keep those of the King.</p>

  <p>"It is only twenty-five miles to Dunbar," said the Queen. A cold, strong
  wind blew on their faces and she drew it in eagerly as if it gave her
  strength. When they reached the postern the horses and three men, dark shapes
  in the shadows, waited.</p>

  <p>The Queen looked over her shoulder&mdash;they had not been followed.
  Silent and dark the half-ruined church and the royal tombs lay behind them.
  The palace was in darkness, too, except for a glimmer of light in her
  apartments. Moray, Maitland, and all their confederates slept peacefully,
  thinking they had their prey safe.</p>

  <p>She peered round for Bothwell. The first two whom she saw were Arthur
  Erskine and Lord Huntly, and the third man was a little apart and seemed to
  be keeping watch.</p>

  <p>"Quick, sir," Arthur Erskine whispered to the King, and "Quick, madame!"
  he touched Mary Seaton on the arm and took the lantern from her.</p>

  <p>The King and Mary Seaton mounted but the Queen went up to the third man
  and gave him her hand.</p>

  <p>"I have brought him," she whispered, "even though I did not think it could
  be done."</p>

  <p>He pressed her fingers and assisted her carefully into the saddle behind
  Arthur Erskine.</p>

  <p>Moray, turning in a heavy sleep, was roused by the sound of horses' hoofs
  trotting beneath his window. For a second he was startled, then he remembered
  he had told Lindsay to patrol the palace.</p>

  <p>The Queen lay in Dunbar Castle in the first room that could be made ready.
  It was a wet and windy morning. The room was cold and a reluctant fire
  spluttered on the wide stone hearth.</p>

  <p>Though she had ridden twenty-five miles through the night she had not
  slept. Prone with exhaustion, she lay on a mattress and pillows in the gown
  she had worn beneath the horseman's cloak in her headlong flight. As she lay
  there, staring into the fire, she asked for the King, and Mary Seaton replied
  that he had fallen into the first chair he could find and slept like a
  drunken man.</p>

  <p>"He was always fond of his sleep," said the Queen, and asked for Bothwell
  and Huntly.</p>

  <p>Mary Seaton said they had been out finding men to take the place of
  heralds to proclaim the Queen's will that her subjects should rally to her
  standard.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if as many will come as did before," said the Queen faintly.
  "Ten thousand men! Five would be sufficient. I have a good cause, have I not,
  Mary?&mdash;my special servant slain in my presence, my house taken, myself
  held captive. How shall we punish these traitors?" She clasped her hands
  behind her head, then smiled.</p>

  <p>"You rest, Mary. There is a couch in that inner room. I cannot sleep and
  perhaps shall not for many nights, but you, you are quite dropping with
  fatigue."</p>

  <p>"Madame, I can endure it. I had some sleep last night before we left the
  Abbey. But you, madame, have not closed your eyes since&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I think I have died," said the Queen, closing her eyes, "and come to life
  again, if indeed I do live. How long ago was it when I sat at supper there? I
  wonder where, after all, they buried Florestan? Mary, if you do not mean to
  sleep, go downstairs and find Earl Bothwell and send him up here to me."</p>

  <p>Mary Seaton did not like this errand and crossed herself as she always did
  at the mention of the Earl.</p>

  <p>"Would it not be better for the Queen's Grace to receive the Earl
  presently?"</p>

  <p>But the Queen shook her head on the pillows. She disdained all pretences,
  subterfuges, and ceremonies where either her heart, her will, or her mind was
  concerned.</p>

  <p>"I owe the man everything," she said. "I wish to thank him."</p>

  <p>The Queen was still lying on the mattress by the fire, propped by pillows,
  when Bothwell came into her presence. By her side on the floor on which a
  Persian rug had been hastily unrolled, was a silk scarf knotted at the end,
  full of the jewels that Mary Seaton had brought with her from Holyrood, and
  over her knees lay a rug of red damask. The fire was burning more clearly and
  sent a steady heat into the chilly, half-furnished room.</p>

  <p>The Queen smiled without moving and said:</p>

  <p>"I owe you everything. Stand near the window where I can see you."</p>

  <p>He obeyed her gravely and stood in the window-place looking down on her
  where she lay, with such reverence and tenderness that from his attitude she
  might have been throned before him.</p>

  <p>Her senses almost failed her. Odd pictures floated in and out of her
  consciousness. The Italian cowering in the corner with upraised hands;
  Patrick Ruthven's face as he drank his wine; the disordered room and
  Florestan's fingers, like twigs, thrust up through the broken pastry; the
  midwife coming in and then the Lords kneeling on the floor on which were
  still little specks of blood; Moray commanding her in a hostile voice;
  Maitland, insinuating and gentle; the red ring on her finger; and the quick
  flight to the ruined church and the waiting horses, and this man ...</p>

  <p>"You saved me!" she said aloud, and her whole heart went out in gratitude.
  He had done more than save her body&mdash;he had saved her soul, or so she
  thought, for she might easily have died and gone to Hell during those black
  hours in Holyrood. But now she had a chance to live again, and there would be
  time for repentance. She had been rescued from the depths of humiliation and
  she was Queen again.</p>

  <p>In this man's presence, under his protection, she felt quite safe.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" she asked. "I know it seems now as if I could give you
  nothing, but you have made me a queen again and I shall give you your
  reward."</p>

  <p>"I want nothing," he replied.</p>

  <p>"No," she said, raising herself upon her elbows, "for you can take all you
  want."</p>

  <p>She considered him attentively. She remembered all she had heard about
  him, none of which was to his credit. She had been told earnestly and by men
  who had advised her for her good, that Earl Bothwell had said terrible things
  about her. She did not know whether she believed this or not. It seemed not
  to matter. He might be compounded of all evil, but he had great courage, and
  there was no virtue that she admired more.</p>

  <p>There was something, she thought, puzzling about his appearance. The man's
  looks were no clue to what he was. He was French-bred, elegant and cultured.
  He was tall, but not as tall as her husband. He was famed for great strength
  in sports and feats of arms, but appeared slighter than men like Lindsay and
  Ruthven. His features were distinctive, high cheekbones, a wide mouth, short
  aquiline nose, smooth-shaven cheeks, dark red hair, and eyes oddly light. He
  was the best dressed man that the Queen had seen since she had left France.
  She stirred on her mattress while he stood patient, awaiting her pleasure,
  grateful to him for his silence.</p>

  <p>The Queen returned to Edinburgh with Earl Bothwell on one side and her
  husband on the other, and she rode with three thousand men behind her. The
  confederate Lords who had planned the murder of Rizzio fled, seeing
  themselves betrayed by the King, realizing that the Queen had broken all the
  promises she had made to them the day after the murder.</p>

  <p>They had made a desperate attempt to get these promises of an amnesty
  confirmed, sending Lord Sempill after her to Dunbar, but she had refused to
  deal with them.</p>

  <p>The King, also, had washed his hands of his recent accomplices. Before the
  Privy Council and in the Proclamation that was read at Edinburgh Cross,
  pasted on the Tolbooth, and in other conspicuous parts of the city, he denied
  utterly that he had had any "art or part" in the murder of David Rizzio. This
  he swore on his honour as a prince.</p>

  <p>The Queen neither reproached nor questioned him, but she kept on her
  person two bonds from this same crime which he had signed, and which the
  Lords, from their retreats, had sent her in their bitter anger against the
  King. Of these she said nothing.</p>

  <p>For her Foreign Secretary she took Giuseppe Rizzio, although he was an
  inept boy of only eighteen years old. She had his brother's body disinterred
  from the common burial-ground and placed in the graveyard within the palace,
  which gave great offence to many. But she never mentioned his name nor gave
  any hint in her words or demeanour that she brooded over revenge or
  punishment.</p>

  <p>She even allowed Moray to return to the court and bring with him Sir
  William Maitland. Her attitude seemed to be one of indifference when she was
  in her brother's company and she often went out with him and her husband,
  making a show before the people of stability and family harmony.</p>

  <p>All this was for the sake of the child, the Prince of Scotland, who was to
  be born in Edinburgh Castle in June, and also because the Queen thought she
  might die in childbirth and therefore nothing really mattered any more. So
  she treated everything with an indifference that increased as the days went
  by.</p>

  <p>But three bequests that she had made in her will when she thought she was
  going to die, showed that she had not forgotten the recent happenings.</p>

  <p>To her husband she left the red ring with which he had married her. "The
  King my husband gave it to me," she wrote, "and I give it to him back
  again."</p>

  <p>To Giuseppe Rizzio she left the tortoise of rubies and a cross of diamonds
  set in white enamel. "He is to give them to he whom he knows of," she had
  written, and the name that she had whispered in Giuseppe's ear was that of
  the priest. The jewels were to be sold and the money was to go in Masses for
  the soul of David who had died unshriven.</p>

  <p>To Earl Bothwell, the man who had rescued her, she also left a gift. It
  was a mourning-ring, a skull with tears, in black and white.</p>

  <p>She did not know what fancy prompted her to do this. The man&mdash;the
  image of him, and her interest in him, all hung in abeyance in her mind.</p>

  <p>She had another whim she could not explain.</p>

  <p>The night before the child was born she sent for Lady Bothwell, Jane
  Gordon, who had up to now been nothing but a name to her. Jane Gordon had to
  walk a long way through guard-rooms, ante-chambers, corridors, and rooms full
  of women, apothecaries, leeches, and servants until she came to where the
  Queen sat by a window, staring down on the city.</p>

  <p>A shaft of light fell through this window between the two women. Jane
  Gordon paused politely, and the Queen looked at her shrewdly.</p>

  <p>She told her to come forward and the young woman advanced through the
  handsomely furnished room towards the Queen, veiled and draped to the throat
  in brocade and gauze, looking, despite Mary Seaton's care, ill and tired.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Jane," sighed the Queen, "I have been thinking of you so often,
  dreaming of you, too, and I thought that I must see you."</p>

  <p>"Why, madame, should you either dream or think of me?"</p>

  <p>The Queen's tired eyes turned away. She had seen in a turn of the young
  girl's head and bare neck rising from the pleated ruff, a likeness to the
  head and neck of John Gordon as he knelt before the block, and she thought of
  how when she had first come to Scotland she had ridden against the House of
  Huntly and overthrown and ruined it, and how this girl's father had been
  stood up in an open coffin, a proclaimed traitor, while his armorial bearings
  had been torn before his dead face.</p>

  <p>"I gave you to your husband, Jane, it is natural that I should wonder
  about your happiness."</p>

  <p>"The Queen's Grace can scarcely be concerned about my happiness. It was my
  brother whom I obeyed in my marriage."</p>

  <p>"Your brother!" said the Queen, almost timidly. "He has been a good
  servant to us."</p>

  <p>"So was my father, madame," said Jane Gordon boldly, "and my brother,
  John, and those others of my kin who perished in the north."</p>

  <p>The Queen replied in a pleading voice:</p>

  <p>"I do not want to speak of that nor even to think of it, Jane. If I was
  wrong I will make amends. Your brother shall have all his estates."</p>

  <p>"I do not think so, madame," said the girl shrewdly, "while Lord Moray has
  your ear. Madame, have you anything more to say to me?"</p>

  <p>The Queen was at a loss, but very curious about Bothwell's wife.</p>

  <p>"Why should I want to know," she sighed. "What does it matter!"</p>

  <p>She became wrapped up again with the thought of her own approaching
  death.</p>

  <p>"Your House and mine were always in enmity," she whispered. Then, "You
  have a strange man for your husband."</p>

  <p>"He is not strange to me," said Jane Gordon indifferently. "I bear him no
  ill-will."</p>

  <p>"Not strange," repeated the Queen. "Ah, you mean he is civil and
  courteous."</p>

  <p>"I mean that he loves me, madame."</p>

  <p>When the Queen heard these words she knew that the girl had answered all
  her own speculations, that this was the reply to all those dreams and doubts
  which had teased her as she had sat in her enforced inactivity through the
  long days.</p>

  <p>Well, she was probably going to die so it did not matter. Life seemed to
  have ebbed within her. She looked drowsily at the girl who no doubt hated
  her, who accused her, of course, of the death of her father and her
  brothers&mdash;a vindictive family, the Huntlys, a heretic too, this stiff
  girl. Why had she allowed, even encouraged the marriage? Because of her
  eagerness to bind together the two men, Bothwell and Huntly, who might have
  been of service to her. How stale and far away all those tricks and shifts of
  politics seemed.</p>

  <p>She took the rosary and the watch shaped like a skull from her waist and
  held them tight in her left hand on which was the red wedding-ring.</p>

  <p>"Well, Jane Gordon," she said pleasantly, "forgive me that I brought you
  here for a whim."</p>

  <p>The girl dropped her stiff curtsy and was gone, and the Queen remained in
  the cushioned window-place and gazed over the city below the rock on which
  the castle was built.</p>

  <p>The Queen lay quiet in her bed, waiting for death. She lay between the
  curtains embroidered with lions and lilies and imagined she was in some
  monstrous, regal catafalque.</p>

  <p>She was sorry for herself and her body which she had so loved and on which
  she had lavished such care, so soon to become dry and brown and ugly. She was
  sorry for whatever it was that had flamed so brightly in her mind, soul, or
  heart, that soon must be quenched. She thought with relief of Heaven.</p>

  <p>The priest waited in the outer room and she could smell myrrh mingled with
  the apothecary's drugs and the dried violet root that she had told the
  midwife to sprinkle on the baby linen.</p>

  <p>She was quite detached from her life, which seemed now brief and rather
  foolish and without much meaning. She began to think, to distract herself, of
  the future.</p>

  <p>Her death would, of course, be Moray's triumph. Whether the child lived or
  not he would do what he had always wanted to do&mdash;rule Scotland.
  Maitland, elegant, subtle, wise, would be always at his right hand, no, at
  his left&mdash;Maitland at his left half-secretly, and Morton the big bully,
  at his right.</p>

  <p>The Queen sighed. She felt a quiet affection for the country she was about
  to leave. It was really like a dark jewel, her barbaric northern kingdom. She
  remembered the feel of the dry, springy heather beneath her feet and the
  dizziness she had felt when skirting one of these hills and looking down, a
  tumbling water-fall and the loneliness of those remote valleys, above which
  the shadows of moving clouds scudded like ghosts.</p>

  <p>Still! Moray was her half-brother, her father's son. Perhaps he knew what
  they wanted, perhaps he would be able to rule them. She thought of her
  husband. What would his fate be when she was gone? Moray would sweep him away
  like a dead leaf falling from the tree in autumn, he and his greedy, anxious
  father and their followers. The Hamiltons would help too, they would be over
  the Border with what plunder they could take, and David would be avenged.</p>

  <p>She smiled sadly, remembering Stirling and what she had hoped from Henry
  Stewart, how he was to be her protection and light against her enemies. Ah,
  well! it had all gone wrong. She had wanted his beauty and his strength and
  his honesty. She had thought that she could arm and adorn herself with these
  qualities and virtues as she could arm herself with the corselets of linked
  steel, and adorn herself with strings of jewels.</p>

  <p>But that was over; he was nothing to her any more. She had wanted what
  Rizzio had to give, too&mdash;his quickness, his cleverness, and all that
  intense passion which she delighted to tantalize, which she had used to
  punish another. She had had that, too, and that was over.</p>

  <p>Her thoughts went further back to John Gordon and Chastelard. All over,
  and she left none the richer. There was only one bridegroom left for her and
  she did not love him.</p>

  <p>She was not in the least afraid. But if she had lived who would have been
  her next choice? She distracted herself from the growing pain that was
  overcoming her by turning that question over in her mind. Of all the men who
  surrounded her, who had the most to give her&mdash;Earl Bothwell? Was not he
  the man who had set her up higher than she had ever been, who might set her
  higher yet?</p>

  <p>Pain encompassed her. She thought of men on the rack, of women chained to
  the stake, of Gordon and the Frenchman kneeling at the block and she pressed
  her lips together so as not to cry out.</p>

  <p>"If David had been alive I would have made him play some music for me in
  the outer chamber."</p>

  <p>She sat up with an effort and pulled aside the curtains stiff with the
  yellow lions.</p>

  <p>"Mary Seaton! Tell them to come to me now. Let the priest be ready outside
  the door."</p>

  <p>She tried to sing a French song that Ronsard had taught her about the girl
  on whose grave was poured a basket of roses and a vase of milk, and she
  forced herself to smile as the creeping agony seemed to break her body in
  two.</p>

  <p>Mary Seaton, trembling with terror, came to the bed and the Queen
  stretched out a cold hand and took the girl's fingers.</p>

  <p>"Mary, when I am dead, don't let them forget that I am twice a queen. I
  want the lilies as well as the lions." The midwife, important, anxious,
  entered the room with the French girls; in the doorway the priest and his
  assistant knelt regardless of the sneers of the Protestant Lords crowding in
  the ante-chamber.</p>

  <p>The Queen turned into her pillows and bit at her wrist to keep herself
  from crying out, and began to fight for her life and that of the heir of
  Scotland. She laughed to stifle her moans, and because these fools were
  kneeling to receive as their king one whom they secretly believed to be the
  child of the servant whom they had trampled to death.</p>

  <p>Moray heard with deep satisfaction that the child was a son and that the
  Queen lived. He saw in this fact an assurance of his future policy and his
  future power. Neither the Queen nor her husband was of as much importance in
  Moray's eyes as this child. He must be a Protestant, in his reign all trace
  of Catholicism must be swept out of Scotland and he, Moray, would rule
  without resistance.</p>

  <p>There was, of course, the Lennox faction to reckon with, who considered
  this birth their personal triumph, but Moray did not make much of that. The
  undoing of these pretenders to the power, and Lennox's own ambitions could be
  left to the folly of Henry Stewart.</p>

  <p>There were the hordes of Hamiltons, cruel and unscrupulous, but Moray did
  not fear them either.</p>

  <p>Then, the Queen herself&mdash;his calculations stopped there. He had
  stopped thinking of her, for he too had believed that she might die, so
  plainly had he read her actions of late. She had been most civil to him, her
  brother, most civil to her bewildered husband; she had played the prudent
  wife, the decorous Queen. She had never mentioned David nor spoken of
  recalling the Lords who had been banished for his murder. She, too, had
  suspended everything, held her hand&mdash;a woman waiting for her child.</p>

  <p>Moray could understand her motives. Until Scotland's heir was born she
  could risk no scandal, no quarrels. With none of her own French relatives to
  support her, husband and brother must do so. In public she had deferred to
  her husband, she had made him extraordinary gifts, favours and presents had
  gone to old Lennox. To himself, Moray, she had been more than generous.</p>

  <p>But he was not deceived. Once the child was born and she was free of the
  burden of her responsibility she would show her hand again. Moray had been
  present at her interview with her husband when the Prince was a day old and
  he remarked them both, very curiously.</p>

  <p>The Queen had been so faint and wan, tormented by such a deep cough, so
  near death, that it had not appeared possible that there was any harm or
  guile in her.</p>

  <p>She told the two men, husband and brother, how sorely she had been
  handled, how nearly she had died, and Moray had shuddered and felt the tears
  in his own eyes, but the young King had stood stubborn and obstinate,
  carefully looking at her, shifting from foot to foot.</p>

  <p>Then she had taken the child, stiff in his swaddling clothes, and held it
  out between the curtains and called her God to witness that it was his, Henry
  Stewart's, and none other.</p>

  <p>Moray winced that she should have come to this for there were many people
  in the chamber who could hear the declaration. The King, flushed and without
  replying, stooped awkwardly and kissed the child. But the Queen had not been
  satisfied. Goaded by his silence she had taken the infant and lifting the
  veil from its face, said in a trembling voice:</p>

  <p>"Here, I profess to God, and I shall answer to Him on the great Day of
  Judgment, is your son and no other man's son. All here bear witness!" And
  then, as the King did not speak she added: "He is so much your son that I
  fear it will be the worse for him hereafter."</p>

  <p>At this remark he had stirred slightly, the Queen had looked past him at
  Moray, saying:</p>

  <p>"Here is the Prince who shall unite Scotland and England."</p>

  <p>"Why, madame, shall he succeed before Your Majesty and his father?"</p>

  <p>"Alas," she had sighed, "his father has broken to me." Then the King, not
  shifting his place nor raising his head, muttered:</p>

  <p>"Sweet madame, is this your promise you made to forgive and forget
  all?"</p>

  <p>"Ah," said she, "I have forgiven all, but never will forget."</p>

  <p>She had handed the child back to the nurse and sank back on to the
  pillows.</p>

  <p>"If one of those sword thrusts had gone awry what would have become of him
  and me, or what estate would you have been in? God only knows, but we may
  suspect."</p>

  <p>The Queen had smiled at Moray over her husband's shoulder and then she
  said: "Let all go." The King, without further word to her or comment on the
  child, had left the bedchamber.</p>

  <p>Moray smiled to think that she had, despite his suspicions and sullenness,
  had her will with Henry Stewart. He had done what she wished, he had written
  to the King of France, and to her uncle, the Cardinal of Guise, asking them
  to be sponsors to the child. Moray believed that this tacit acknowledgement
  of paternity was the last service that the Queen would ever require from her
  husband.</p>

  <p>He puzzled a little as to what would become of the slighted, useless young
  man who had offended everyone, who was an enemy of his wife, who had outraged
  the nobility of Scotland by urging them on to the murder of Rizzio and then
  betraying them. Twenty years old and already in so desperate a plight! The
  Queen's husband, too, and not to be rid of so easily.</p>

  <p>Moray's thoughts travelled to the man whom the Queen had lately seemed to
  hold most in favour&mdash;Earl Bothwell, his own especial enemy, a man whom
  he detested, and a little feared as far as it was in his nature to fear
  anybody. He was now on the Border, the Governorship of which he had obtained
  against the wish of the King, who wanted that post for his father.</p>

  <p>Moray pondered, his fingers fumbling a piece of unicorn horn kept on his
  desk as an antidote to disease. Bothwell must be got rid of
  too&mdash;Bothwell and Henry Stewart, by some means, must be destroyed.
  Maitland might be able to suggest some plan that would involve neither of
  them. Unless&mdash;there was one way by which both of them might be rendered
  harmless. The Queen might be forced to pretend a reconciliation with her
  husband, to live with him quietly and dutifully, and Bothwell might be
  banished again to England or to France. If she would consent to that, all
  might be very simple. He tingled with impatience for the day when she would
  be well enough for him to sound her intentions.</p>

  <p>Moray went up to the castle where the Queen had given him rooms, during
  his residence, for his private use. He intended to probe her mind and was
  confident of his errand. She had lately been civil towards him, admitting him
  to her presence when she refused Huntly and other friends of Bothwell. She
  had spoken to him gravely of Scottish affairs, she had even confided to him
  that she had money from the Pope, and said that all should be used for
  peaceful purposes, in making amities among her people. She had told him also,
  with what appeared to be a pathetic sincerity, that she mistrusted her
  husband, who, she thought, was making plots against her with his family and
  with such of the nobles as would listen to him. She said that he went in
  constant fear that she might recall Maitland, or some of the nobles
  implicated in the murder of David. He particularly dreaded Morton and the
  other Douglases. She did not say that she knew the reason of his
  fear&mdash;the fact that he had been the instigator of the murder and then
  betrayed his accomplices, but Moray could read that knowledge in her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>So Moray had begun to feel sure of her and had resolved that on this
  meeting he would insist at least on the recall of Maitland and his return to
  the Secretaryship. Quite soon he meant to insist on the return of Morton and
  the other Douglases. If that meant the end of the King he did not think the
  Queen would grieve overmuch.</p>

  <p>But when Moray inquired for the Queen he found that she had gone. His
  amazement was extreme and was succeeded by a deep anger, not so much against
  her duplicity as against his own foolishness in trusting her. How many
  instances he had had of her inconstancy and fickleness, yet she had been able
  to deceive him again!</p>

  <p>She had gone to Alloa, Lord Mar's castle, and she had not even taken Mary
  Seaton with her but had gone secretly. Her escort had been the new body of
  harquebusiers, and she had taken with her Lady Reres, Mary Beaton's aunt,
  sister of a witch and Bothwell's ex-mistress.</p>

  <p>Moray heard this in anger and self-reproach. This woman's caprices were
  always overthrowing his careful plans. He saw Earl Bothwell as becoming
  suddenly important, and this filled him with fury, for of all the hates in
  Scotland then, and there were many, there was not a hate more intense than
  that of Moray for Bothwell, not even the hatred of the King for Morton.</p>

  <p>Moray went upstairs into the Queen's chambers which were being dismantled,
  the tapestries taken down from the walls, the furniture unhung from the beds,
  chairs and cushions stacked up.</p>

  <p>He found Mary Seaton helping to take down the winged altar-piece, the
  statues and arras from the oratory, and called her away impatiently. He
  questioned her closely as to the Queen's motives for this behaviour.</p>

  <p>"Why, she has run away before her month was up, quicker than any common
  woman. Had she not hesitated to leave her child?"</p>

  <p>"She does not love him," said Mary Seaton loyally. "What does she know of
  him, why should she care about him? She said he looked like Florestan but was
  not so clean nor so clever, and it is true enough."</p>

  <p>It instantly occurred to Moray that if the Queen proved an indifferent
  mother that might help his game&mdash;the child was more useful than she was,
  it would suit him to keep them apart.</p>

  <p>When the Queen escaped from Edinburgh Castle, from all the paraphernalia
  of childbirth, the dark rooms, the priests and apothecaries, the women and
  servants, the medicines and ceremonies, the smells of incense and drugs and
  the wax candles, she felt like a new being. She shook off the castle, the
  city, the Abbey, the child, Moray, her husband, Lennox, like so much dust
  from the hem of her robe.</p>

  <p>Lady Reres was good company, it was agreeable to be with her after the
  pious prudery of Mary Seaton, the inane chatter of the French girls, and the
  gossip of the midwife. Lady Reres knew a great many things that it amused the
  Queen to hear. She had diverting tales of Earl Bothwell, she had been his
  lover once. She knew many secrets of magic, too, for her sister was a witch,
  the enchanted Lady of Braxholme, niece of the murdered Cardinal Beaton. She
  could tell tales of this uncle who, when the Queen was a little child, had
  been dragged out of his chamber at his castle of Saint Andrews and butchered
  by the Protestants, urged on by John Knox.</p>

  <p>The Queen walked the sands at Alloa, the wind in her hair and listened to
  the fat woman by her side. The refrain of her pleasant, humorous talk was
  always Bothwell. Bothwell was the man, and he alone. Didn't the Queen's Grace
  see that? There was no one like him.</p>

  <p>Look at the rescue from Holyrood. Who else had been able to think of that?
  He was powerful, too, he had the whole of the Border, Liddesdale, and other
  counties that touched on England as well as lands in Lothian. And, through
  the Huntlys he had the north. The Gordons were powerful, Lady Reres said, as
  powerful as the Douglas and the Hamiltons put together, if need be.</p>

  <p>"What need?" asked the Queen, throwing back her head and laughing.</p>

  <p>"He knows it," replied the woman with a wink as she laboured over the
  salt-encrusted sands, and she continued to talk of Bothwell. Much of what she
  said the Queen knew, but she listened patiently all the same. The Hepburns,
  now, was it not an ancient and a noble name? James Hepburn! He was not yet
  thirty years old, no, twenty-eight on his last name-day, yet there was
  nothing he had not accomplished.</p>

  <p>As a boy he had been in the field&mdash;"fighting for your mother, madame,
  as Your Grace well knows. Ay, at Kelso, when everyone had forsaken her he
  threw himself across the Border and drove the English back."</p>

  <p>"Well, well, we have been grateful."</p>

  <p>The Queen paused, still smiling. The day was so beautiful. The little
  waves of the Firth of Forth fell one over another while the sea-birds, white
  and grey, dipped away.</p>

  <p>The stout woman paused, out of breath, with her hands stuck on her hips,
  and stared across the gleaming water. Then she went on about Bothwell. The
  Queen listened, half-laughing.</p>

  <p>He had such a wonderful library of magic books; it was quite true that he
  knew all about spells and potions.</p>

  <p>"He can tie the four winds in a kerchief," said the Queen smiling, "and
  set witches on a broomstick to stir the heavens to storm. It is as well to
  have such a man for a servant."</p>

  <p>She asked Lady Reres in a friendly fashion if it were true what was said
  about Janet Beaton, the wizard lady of Braxholme. Could she really do all
  these tricks? Had she been married to Bothwell, and what about the Danish
  girl?</p>

  <p>Lady Reres laughed till she shook. What did any of that matter, old tales,
  all of them!</p>

  <p>"But," she added, "he is a man whom few women, perhaps only one woman,
  could resist." The Queen thought of Jane Gordon. "He loves his wife?" she
  remarked.</p>

  <p>The elder woman's gusty laughter rang loud in the still air, and the Queen
  seemed pleased at the note of scorn in it.</p>

  <p>"He despises her, madame, he despises all of them! There is only one
  creature who would satisfy him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Queen did not check this impudence. She took off her flat, stout
  leather shoes and ran along the sands, the wind in her thin blue dress, in
  her thick hair.</p>

  <p>That night her spirits rose so high there were some of Lord Mar's
  household said that the Lady of Braxholme's sister had bewitched the
  Queen.</p>

  <p>The King poured out his misery to his father.</p>

  <p>"What does she mean to do? I have no friends, not one. I do not know which
  to dread the most&mdash;Bothwell, Moray, Maitland, or the banished Lords. If
  she could call those back&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She will not," replied Lennox. "Is it not more to her interests than to
  yours to keep them away? She must loathe them."</p>

  <p>"She loathes me more deeply. She only played with me till the child was
  born; she wanted me to acknowledge it and I did."</p>

  <p>"You would have been a thrice damned fool if you had not," snarled Lennox.
  "Is not that our best hold on her? Would it suit our plans to have you the
  wittol husband?" Then in his anger and disgust he began to abuse his son.
  "You should not' have betrayed them. They are too powerful, there are too
  many of them, you signed those bonds and then betrayed them. What is there
  about this woman that she could persuade you to that?"</p>

  <p>"She might have been right," replied the King doggedly, trying to cover up
  his disastrous mistake. "She said, that night at Holyrood, they meant to have
  me next. Perhaps it was true."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it was true," sneered his father. "They mean certainly to have
  you now. All this clatter about the slaying of an Italian scullion! It should
  have been Moray whom you'd taken, ay, and Maitland with him."</p>

  <p>"I thought of it," said the King sullenly, "but I had no one to help me.
  He is too powerful, he'd leave too many behind to avenge him. It is difficult
  to come at&mdash;murder, I mean&mdash;I never was taught those tricks.
  Besides, she protects him. Several times lately I have found him in her
  presence. I told her once I'd endure no more of it. It is David over
  again&mdash;I am turned away while he is closeted with her. I said I'd break
  his neck and she warned him&mdash;he came and told me that she had. Don't you
  see that if anything like that was attempted and discovered it would be an
  excuse for putting us both out of the kingdom? Though God knows, that would
  hardly break my heart. I loathe Scotland."</p>

  <p>Softly, and with utter bitterness, Lennox began to abuse the Queen,
  stinging her name with his tongue, using the foulest words he could think of
  to besmirch her, doing this deliberately and viciously.</p>

  <p>"She is all that," assented the young husband.</p>

  <p>"Yet, when she chooses," cried his father bitterly, "she can have her will
  of you, you fool. What position have you got yourself into? You have the name
  of King but none of the respect, you are ringed round with enemies. You have
  neither power, money, nor retinue. And what can I do? We have everyone
  against us!"</p>

  <p>He began to curse Moray as the devil incarnate, and Maitland as a keeper
  of an outpost of Hell. The King listened with despair to his father's
  railings. He was no match for any of the combinations formed against him in
  the court, and knew it. He bitterly regretted his treacheries, for he knew
  that his accomplices had sent the Queen the two bonds he had signed for
  Rizzio's murder. Once, when she had allowed him into her chamber she had
  opened a jewel case lined with blue satin and he had seen lying there the red
  enamel wedding-ring and the two bonds. She had looked up at him and smiled,
  then closed the case, locked it, and given it to Mary Seaton, to guard well,
  as she said.</p>

  <p>Yes, he had betrayed his accomplices, and because of that they were ruined
  and banished, and she had betrayed him, making him leave Holyrood with her
  under the pretence that she loved him. How could he have believed that? How
  could he have allowed her a second time to persuade him?</p>

  <p>"She makes use of me again and again," he muttered.</p>

  <p>"Ay, and will do so," said his father, looking at him in contempt, "as
  long as there's breath in her body. What of this Bothwell, what of this
  ruffian she now makes much of?"</p>

  <p>"I think he is my friend," said the young King slowly. "He, too, hates
  Moray. He said he would stand by me to remove him."</p>

  <p>But Lennox spat out abuse of Bothwell.</p>

  <p>"Believe nothing of such a rascal's promises or friendship. And look to
  him and the Queen," he added, "look to him and the Queen. She puts him above
  everyone, he is all in all at court. Your friend!&mdash;he'd slit your throat
  for a nudge from her. He has butchered more men already than any dare
  tell."</p>

  <p>The King was wretched, overwhelmed by a fit of despair. He could see no
  help ahead; he really believed his position was so desperate that there was
  nothing for it but to leave Scotland, and he turned over in his unhappy mind
  how he might revenge himself on all of them and shame the Queen, leave her at
  a loss by withdrawing from the kingdom where he had met nothing but
  humiliation, perils, and pain.</p>

  <p>At the end of the summer the King and Queen hunted in Meggatdale. They did
  not have much sport for the poachers had been among the deer on the wide
  moors. Nor was there any freedom and mirth in their conversation. They only
  met in public, and each kept spies on the other.</p>

  <p>Constantly in their company were Lord Moray and Earl Bothwell. Lennox had
  bid his son be patient and go cautiously, but the sunny, empty, hostile days
  galled the unhappy youth.</p>

  <p>It seemed to him that everyone was laughing at him, and when they returned
  to Edinburgh and the Queen suddenly gave him rich presents, rounds of brocade
  and lengths of cypress, silver-knobbed harness for a horse and the bed from
  Stirling, it seemed to him she laughed the loudest of all.</p>

  <p>By early autumn the Queen had brought back Sir William Maitland, and made
  him the Secretary of State again. Poor Giuseppe, she declared, she only kept
  for her small, private correspondence in French and Italian.</p>

  <p>She bade Maitland be amiable to Bothwell with whom he had long been at
  odds. She made Moray and Bothwell clasp hands and speak to each other
  civilly, and she gave them all to understand that they were equally her
  friends if they would band themselves against her enemies. They had no need
  to ask what enemies they were, they knew she meant Lennox and his son.</p>

  <p>The King sulked at Stirling, and Lennox wrote a letter to the Queen,
  telling her it was their intention to leave the country and that they had a
  vessel ready to take them and their followers abroad.</p>

  <p>As the Queen stood staring at this letter, the King himself rode up
  through the pale, October weather and demanded to see her, but when he heard
  that Moray and Bothwell were in her company he would not go up.</p>

  <p>Thereupon the Queen, smiling, sent these Lords away and went down to meet
  him where he stood reluctant and hesitant, on the grand staircase.</p>

  <p>When she took his hand he said nothing, though her greetings were ready
  and civil. He followed her upstairs to the room which he had not entered
  since the night the body of the Italian had been dragged through it.</p>

  <p>She shut the door on everyone, even Mary Seaton. Then, very earnestly, she
  demanded of her husband his reasons for wishing to leave her and depart from
  the country. But though she kept him with her all night she could get nothing
  from him, for he put aside her wiles and entreaties and her gentle threats.
  "Ah," she said, "I perceive you are indeed broken with me."</p>

  <p>She spoke to him of the child, a flourishing prince likely to be of great
  importance in Europe, but he said nothing, only remained sitting heavily in
  the chair at the foot of her bed. All night she pleaded in vain, until at
  break of day she lay her down in her clothes and slept from sheer
  weariness.</p>

  <p>When she got up soon after, her agitation disturbing rest, she found him
  asleep in his riding-habit in the chair. She roused him and took him down to
  the Council Chamber where the French Ambassador was and there before them all
  she implored him to declare his grief and what he might have against her. The
  Lords seconded this request, calling her a wise and virtuous princess, and
  asked why he would leave her and this rich kingdom.</p>

  <p>So they goaded and baited this young man, who knew they were all banded
  against him. He had neither authority nor respect. He realized that the woman
  who had betrayed him before would do so again.</p>

  <p>Twice he made as if to speak and turned towards his wife. But each time he
  looked round at those smiling, hostile faces and was silent.</p>

  <p>At last he rose up impatiently, refusing to explain himself, saying to the
  Queen "Adieu, madame!" and to the Lords "Adieu, gentlemen, this is the last
  of me." Then lie walked out of Holyrood and rode away with no one following
  him but his page boy.</p>

  <p>That evening Moray and Maitland drew all the Lords in a bond against Henry
  Stewart as he had drawn them in a bond against David Rizzio. It was very
  secretly and carefully done, and Moray, with many smiles and courtesies,
  singled out from his noble friends the Earl Bothwell to be the leader in this
  enterprise, thinking to himself that the thing was simple&mdash;Henry Stewart
  had been used to destroy Rizzio, and by that crime himself; Earl Bothwell
  could be used to destroy Henry Stewart and by that crime himself. In this
  deed, as in that, he, James Stewart, Earl Moray, and Maitland, his pliant
  friend, would stand aside and receive no blame nor take any
  responsibility.</p>

  <p>When all were gone Maitland asked his friend: "And the Queen?"</p>

  <p>"Ay," said Moray heavily, "all comes round to the Queen. But she is not so
  important now there is a prince; the weight of the crown is eased about her
  brows, Maitland."</p>

  <p>"Yet she lives," said the Secretary of State softly, "and I, for one,
  would not care to harm her."</p>

  <p>"Who spoke of harm?"</p>

  <p>"Shall she know, need she know?" asked Maitland. "She truly loathes
  him."</p>

  <p>"What does it matter if she loathes or favours him," replied Moray, as if
  Henry Stewart were already dead.</p>

  <p>"What shall we do with her next lover?"</p>

  <p>"Bothwell?" whispered Moray with his chin on his breast. "You see then how
  things go, Maitland."</p>

  <p>"He is not perhaps her lover yet," said the Secretary delicately.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Moray, with a bleak look. "I have tried to prevent
  it. How can one tell, she is so brittle and so clever. And he has every
  art&mdash;But it will not be difficult to be rid of him."</p>

  <p>"And yet one needs," smiled the Secretary, "some finesse. We do not now
  discuss an Italian groom but a prince, and a king. Bothwell, too, might be a
  match for us."</p>

  <p>"No. He is reckless, blinded by ambition. A man of straw. Leave him to
  destroy himself."</p>

  <p>Lady Reres wondered about the Queen. She had become very familiar with
  her, replacing Mary Seaton and the French girls as well as the two
  Maries&mdash;Mary Livingstone and Mary Fleming, who had married&mdash;but she
  was still baffled by her.</p>

  <p>Often she would tell her stories and ask her questions. But the Queen
  would only smile, neither offended nor surprised, admitting nothing, only
  amused. Lady Reres saw that the Queen did not live with her husband. Under
  one excuse or another they were always apart, and the fat woman with her
  quick eye and ear for gossip, saw that the Queen tolerated the King's
  enemies, but she could not get her to commit herself that she was one of
  them. Then the new favourite had tried to insinuate herself into the Queen's
  confidence on the question of the Italian boys.</p>

  <p>What had really happened with David? What had been precisely the order of
  events on that appalling night in Holyrood? But the Queen had been
  silent.</p>

  <p>Then there was Giuseppe. What of him?</p>

  <p>He went about his business and the Queen flung him money and gifts as she
  flung her dogs and her birds sugar and tid-bits.</p>

  <p>Lady Reres praised Bothwell, and the Queen liked to listen, but how far
  would Bothwell rise in court? Everyone in the court and city looked askance
  at the stout woman with the bad reputation who was supposed to know so many
  secret ways of accomplishing evil. She was to help the Queen and Bothwell as
  Rizzio had been supposed to help the Queen and Henry Stewart.</p>

  <p>It was known everywhere that the King in a fit of fury had told Lord Moray
  that the Queen had been his mistress before she had been his wife. Had not
  Lady Reres herself repeated the rumour, to the Queen, and seen no change in
  her expression?</p>

  <p>Was the Queen, after all, a chaste, discreet woman? Nothing seemed to
  shame her, yet she seemed to live like a nun.</p>

  <p>Baffled and angered, the woman said at length directly: "You know, madame,
  that it is whispered everywhere that Earl Bothwell tries to win you with
  black arts."</p>

  <p>The Queen lay on the reposing-bed in the Exchequer House. Lady Reres,
  walking heavily up and down, began to make jokes about love and honour and
  virtue. The Queen smiled, slowly waving a fan of black feathers to and
  fro.</p>

  <p>Earl Bothwell and his wife lodged in David Chalmers's house that was at
  the end of the passage adjoining the Exchequer House.</p>

  <p>Lady Reres said suddenly, standing in front of the Queen and sticking her
  hands on her hips:</p>

  <p>"Perhaps now he is casting spells and incantations. You do not know what
  he can do with drugs and potions."</p>

  <p>The Queen laughed, and there was a note of mocking in her laughter.</p>

  <p>"Do you think I am here for anyone to take?" she asked indifferently. "Do
  you know what my Lord Moray does? He plans all into a combination against my
  husband."</p>

  <p>"How does that affect Your Grace?" asked Lady Reres, stopping in front of
  her.</p>

  <p>"I do not know," replied the Queen steadily. "How can they free me of him?
  I see no way out. If they were to find some quibble in our marriage and
  dissolve it there would be a smirch upon the child. And if he were to go
  abroad as he threatens, it would be a great scandal. If he were to go to
  England, Elizabeth Tudor might help him to cause discord in Scotland.</p>

  <p>"And what for me?" she added, "what for me?"</p>

  <p>"I'll fetch Earl Bothwell," nodded Lady Reres, and walked, fat and
  ungainly, out of the room.</p>

  <p>"Can he give me good advice?" whispered the Queen after her, but Lady
  Reres did not reply.</p>

  <p>She told Margaret Carwood, who was in her pay, to let no one into the
  Exchequer House where the Queen rested during the humid autumn afternoon, and
  she went to David Chalmers's mansion where Earl Bothwell was playing chess
  with his wife.</p>

  <p>He had his own furnishings in this house and the autumn sunlight struck on
  the backs of shelves of books of magic.</p>

  <p>Jane Gordon looked up when she saw the old woman on the threshold and she
  pursed her lips. She seemed both reserved and dispirited. She overturned the
  pieces on the board, mingled them together, knights, bishops, pawns, while
  her husband's pale bright eyes stared menacingly at the fat woman whom he had
  paid so well and who had so far done so little for him.</p>

  <p>Lady Reres spoke and her voice was wheezy from her haste.</p>

  <p>"Come, there some's important business for you. Come with me."</p>

  <p>Without looking at his wife, who continued to gaze at the chess pieces,
  Earl Bothwell left David Chalmers's house.</p>

  <p>"There are spies everywhere," grumbled the fat woman, as the door closed
  behind them on Jane Gordon sitting alone, "and I swear I do not know her
  mind. But she's alone now, and if you were to go down boldly and say you have
  some business&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The man nodded gravely.</p>

  <p>"I'll go in and talk to your wife," continued Lady Reres.</p>

  <p>"No. She detests you."</p>

  <p>"Well, I thought for that reason&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No!" said Bothwell again, and this time the woman was silent. She
  returned to the Exchequer House, and waddled to the linen closet where the
  French girls and Margaret Carwood were putting coifs, veils and linen napkins
  into presses and delicately setting gauze ruffs and collars on to fine
  tourets of gold wire hung with jewels.</p>

  <p>Earl Bothwell entered the Exchequer House by another way from that Lady
  Reres had taken&mdash;a private passage from David Chalmers's mansion led
  directly to the Queen's apartments. He walked in like a master, not
  arrogantly but casually.</p>

  <p>The Queen looked up and saw him coming. This was the man&mdash;how could
  she ever have mistaken the others for him, with his gaiety and brilliance,
  above all his audacity?</p>

  <p>He came to the reposing-bed and stood looking down at her. She said under
  her breath without moving, smiling directly into his strange, light eyes with
  a meaning that had nothing to do with her words: "There are Lennox spies
  everywhere and Moray's too. Trust no one."</p>

  <p>"Madame, I am your friend, if all the world were in arms against you."</p>

  <p>"You climb high," whispered the Queen, and he replied, emphatically:</p>

  <p>"Where you wish, as you wish."</p>

  <p>She seemed to reflect a moment, then she put her hand under one of the
  cushions and drew out a key.</p>

  <p>"It is that," she said, "of the newel staircase which leads through the
  King's rooms to mine. But he is not there."</p>

  <p>As she spoke, musing, she was picturing Patrick Ruthyen, and the armed men
  and her husband with his arm round her waist, the overturned supper-board,
  that night of horror and humiliation. She saw the body of the trampled monkey
  and what she had done afterwards, how she had gone down and cringed to him,
  and how this man standing before her now had saved her.</p>

  <p>"There are spies and bravos everywhere, you know&mdash;I'll never be
  free.</p>

  <p>"Spies!" she repeated under her breath, as one of her servants entered the
  room under pretext of closing the windows because the evening air was cold.
  When the woman had gone he said, still standing away from the Queen:</p>

  <p>"The King's spies?"</p>

  <p>"He is no king unless I choose. Call him Lord Darnley. I am weary of
  him."</p>

  <p>"He says that he will leave the country."</p>

  <p>"He must not. Come nearer."</p>

  <p>She enjoyed deception, yet she could be very reckless and sometimes took
  no trouble at all to avoid compromising herself. This suited the man: he
  wanted her, by any and every means, delivered into his hands. His conquest of
  her had been so easy that sometimes he had to remind himself sharply that
  this was a queen, who might give him a crown. Since her escape from Edinburgh
  Castle after the birth of the Prince they had been lovers and he had not had
  to tell her that he loved her; they had come together like the magnet and the
  steel. Without words, almost without glances, he had devised her complete
  surrender. Setting her above all hypocrisies, conventions, and petty fears,
  he had treated her as a creature whose right to all the delights of love was
  natural and unquestioned. The Queen had been deeply grateful for this. After
  the shamefaced, fluctuating passion of Henry Stewart, and the half-timid,
  half-insolent devotion of David, she rejoiced in this man who knew neither
  shame nor remorse, neither regret nor fear, who spared her protestations of
  fidelity, who neither offered nor exacted explanations.</p>

  <p>He had gained an unlimited power over her. Sometimes she believed that he
  had really enchanted her, bound her to him with magic potions and spells.
  Sometimes she sensed that the logical outcome of the indulgence of this
  intense, heartless, and wayward passion must be tragic; sometimes she felt,
  with a cold self-realization, the steady deepening of her own corruption
  under the influence of this dazzling lover.</p>

  <p>But she was happy, and content to leave her destiny in the hands of the
  man who pleased her better than any man had yet.</p>

  <p>Quite at his ease, he waited her will. He did not fear either the spies of
  the King or the bravi of Moray. His courage was of such an arrogant quality
  that he felt himself to be invulnerable.</p>

  <p>He considered the Queen a little curiously; it had cost him so little to
  win her that sometimes, despite his fearless self-assurance, he wondered what
  possible treachery might lurk behind her implacable frivolity. He, too, had
  spies on her; the Frenchman, Nicolas Hubert, nicknamed Paris, who had been in
  her service and was now in his, daily brought him news of her behaviour. So
  far he had learned nothing to his disadvantage&mdash;she was all his ...but
  he watched and was very wary. Modern as she appeared, she might yet cherish
  some romantic illusions that would be to the advantage of another man.</p>

  <p>The Queen spoke. "Come to me to-night." She pulled at his ruffled sleeve.
  "He must, somehow, be dealt with." Her face was puckered with anxiety. "But I
  must not be involved, do you understand? Moray and Maitland, now, look out
  for them&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He touched her cheek kindly.</p>

  <p>"Leave all to me."</p>

  <p>"But there is need for haste, and care. Come to-night."</p>

  <p>She paused, allowing her thoughts to dwell with pleasure over those secret
  visits: every time that he came up the newel stairs through the empty
  apartments of the King, she felt David avenged. It was dangerous, and she
  liked that, too. They had only two confidants&mdash;Mary Seaton, with her
  inviolable fidelity, and Paris, the debauched boy whom Bothwell had brought
  from the French Court.</p>

  <p>Encompassed by danger, yet with a sense of security, the Queen loved to
  lie in her lover's arms. She felt as if his strength passed to her, making
  her invulnerable.</p>

  <p>"It is perhaps not wise for me to come?"</p>

  <p>"But we cannot speak here. And he is in Glasgow."</p>

  <p>"I am not free. I have to account for my comings and goings."</p>

  <p>"To Jane Gordon?" The Queen whispered the name scornfully.</p>

  <p>"And to her brother, Huntly."</p>

  <p>"A false race&mdash;you are tied to a false race, like I am&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He smiled to hear her speak of falsehood&mdash;as if she knew what
  sincerity was!</p>

  <p>She drew him closer to her in the dusk.</p>

  <p>"If I am not saved now, I am lost indeed. We must be rid of&mdash;them.
  You understand? And soon. He has almost denied one child. This
  time&mdash;"</p>

  <p>They began whispering, closely, in the dusk.</p>

  <p>Lady Reres, triumphant in an outer room where she chattered with the
  French girls, inwardly congratulated herself that she had at last put the
  Queen into the power of Earl Bothwell. Even she had been deceived by the
  adroit methods of the man who had long despised and dispensed with her
  services.</p>

  <p>While the man and woman whispered in the deepening shadows of the
  Exchequer House in the castle on the hill, Earl Moray put safely in a secret
  place a green casket that contained the bond uniting all the nobles against
  the Queen's husband.</p>

  <p>The King lay sick in Glasgow, in his father's stronghold, where he had
  fled for protection against his enemies. Only in this place in all Scotland
  could he be safe, and even there he awoke sometimes in the middle of the
  night, trembling, and calling for his servant to come and sit by him.</p>

  <p>So many enemies! The Queen had recalled all those whom he had
  offended&mdash;the Douglases, Morton, Atholl, Argyll, Lindsay, and Maitland,
  all of whom were surely upon his track. Never would they forgive that
  betrayal, never.</p>

  <p>His mind, plagued and tortured by sickness, made dreadful pictures of
  recent events&mdash;at the christening, how he had been flouted, shut away in
  his own room, so desperate that he had cringed to her for a little favour,
  for a smile, a place of honour. But no, she had refused him everything.</p>

  <p>There had been masques, banquets, festivals, and a great papal ceremony,
  and he, a son of the true Faith, had had to cower in his room, alone except
  for his English servants, while Earl Bothwell had been the master of the
  ceremony and helped to entertain the guests.</p>

  <p>Then, as an excuse, no doubt, to get away from him, she had ridden to the
  Border, holding her sessions in the frontier towns, and at Jedburgh had
  fallen so ill that they thought that she would die. But she had not sent for
  him.</p>

  <p>When she had recovered again, and been able to mount a horse, what had
  this foolish, indomitable, exasperating woman done?</p>

  <p>She had ridden to Hermitage Castle where Earl Bothwell lay wounded from a
  Border scuffle. Sixty miles in one day she had ridden&mdash;there and back,
  to get a sight of him, so it seemed. She had, of course, been ill again from
  fatigue and those about her blamed him, her wretched husband, as the cause of
  her distress. She seemed to him to squander everything, even her own
  life.</p>

  <p>Maitland was with her, and Moray. What did they plan? They were often
  closeted together. He had spies in her household and the news they sent him
  was bad. She spoke of him harshly. She blamed him for all her misfortunes.
  She drew all those about her into a clique against him. The young man saw the
  future as bleak and terrible; if his illness had not stricken him down he
  would have fled the country, taken a ship with a few followers and gone
  anywhere to be free of this accursed Scotland.</p>

  <p>Lennox suddenly burst into the room. The Queen had arrived in Glasgow
  without warning.</p>

  <p>Henry Stewart could not speak for astonishment; he lay staring from his
  pillows. Lennox spoke hurriedly. He had been ill himself and could hardly
  hold himself upright.</p>

  <p>"It is true she gave notice of her intention, but I did not think she
  meant it. She has ridden from Edinburgh in this winter weather to see you, to
  make a reconciliation, she says, yet her mood I do not think is good. She has
  Livingstone, Lady Reres, and some others with her. She says if you would not
  come to her she must come to you. Too great a lady to be fastidious, eh?"</p>

  <p>"She comes to flatter," whispered the young man from the bed, his face was
  surly and unresponsive. "She wants something from me. What?"</p>

  <p>"She can do no harm here," said Lennox heavily. "Thomas Crawford went out
  to speak to her and she was pleasant enough. Who knows? she may have decided
  this is the only way&mdash;a reconciliation, eh? While you're here, at least
  you're safe, she has only a small escort. But if you like I will tell her you
  are too sick and cannot see her."</p>

  <p>Henry Stewart did not reply. He found to his astonishment that the mere
  mention of his wife's name and the thought that she was in the same city with
  him had dissipated some of his nightmares. Supposing she was to see him after
  all, be good to him again? But he hardened his heart and tried to remember
  all her faults and offences and to conjure up an unlikeable image of her. He
  was angry, too, because he looked ugly, covered with sores, results of the
  illness that had struck him down. He had never had anything that pleased her
  save his good looks, and they had gone.</p>

  <p>At first he said "I will not see her," then, "Let her come," then again,
  "No!"</p>

  <p>At last, Lennox, who indeed himself scarcely knew what to do, persuaded
  him that the Queen should visit him. The old man reminded his son that twice
  she had offered to send her physician, but to this Henry replied sullenly
  that no doubt she had her own interests to serve by that. There could be
  nothing good in this visit, they had been estranged too long. She had
  released all his enemies, she had openly favoured Bothwell and Moray. Yet he
  would see her from curiosity, from longing, from hope.</p>

  <p>The King instructed his valet and his page to dress him as decently as
  they could for the coming of the Queen. He was profoundly upset at the curse
  which afflicted him, making him awful to look at, which no bathings nor
  lotions could disguise.</p>

  <p>He was glad that it was winter, a grey, windy day when candles would be
  lit early.</p>

  <p>The English servants did what they could, washing and anointing his
  disfigured face, dressing him in embroidered linen and a purple bedgown lined
  with sable. Yet when he looked at himself in the mirror that they brought
  him, he was repulsed by his image.</p>

  <p>Much of his arrogance had gone with his looks. He felt abashed and weak,
  purged by physical humiliation of many vanities. He told John Taylor to bring
  him a mask of yellow silk taffeta he had worn once in a masked tilting at the
  ring when he and Huntly and Argyll on the sands at Leith had taken part
  against Moray and Lord Robert Stewart, and had been dressed as women with
  these masks and skirts and periwigs, and even after that handicap had
  won.</p>

  <p>The long mask of fine wood covered with taffeta, with whiskers of pink
  floss, was placed over his face, and he felt some return of confidence. At
  least he would not be repugnant to her; he felt a faint return of hope. She
  had at least, ventured alone into his stronghold; he was safe in Glasgow, but
  she was not. He recalled some of the old raptures, the violet-brown bed, the
  crimson enamel ring.</p>

  <p>He asked whom she had brought with her and was told there was a lot of
  servants, including two foreign youths, and some others including Lord
  Livingstone and Lady Reres. At this last name the King winced, and asked who
  were the foreign servants; but John Taylor affected not to know. He did not
  want to tell his sick master that one of them was Giuseppe, David's brother,
  who was now employed in writing the Queen's foreign letters, and the other
  was Nicolas Hubert, nicknamed Paris, who was Lord Bothwell's lackey lately
  lent to the Queen.</p>

  <p>He was ready long before she came, and lay propped up on his pillows,
  waiting. He had fled from Stirling when he had heard that due to Bothwell and
  Moray's persuasion she was going to pardon his one-time accomplices for the
  murder of David: and Morton and that other Douglas, Archibald, were returning
  to Scotland. The King had remembered that a Douglas had murdered a Stewart in
  Stirling Castle and he had fled from there to the only place in the island
  where he felt safe, believing his wife and his honour lost, his status
  mocked, the child not his ...</p>

  <p>But she had followed him, to take him back to his capital, her message
  said, to heal all differences between them, to effect a sincere
  reconciliation. If only it was true! Old dreams and hopes stirred in the sick
  man, who was simple and childlike under the vices which had stuck to him like
  burrs as he had passed through the thicket of the Court.</p>

  <p>She came so quietly that at first he did not notice her presence. She
  affected no surprise at seeing his mask, but approached the bed and seated
  herself in a great chair and smiled at him, looking weary and compassionate,
  even, he thought, humble.</p>

  <p>He stared at her greedily through the eyeholes in the silk mask. She was
  dressed in a colour that reminded him oddly of bulrushes that he had seen in
  England. Her face was as smooth as the mask that disguised him, her hair was
  crimped stiffly either side her brow. The curious eyes, dark beneath the
  white lids and faint gold lashes, gave him a gentle look.</p>

  <p>Without waiting for him to speak she began in a low tone to reproach him
  for the cruelty of the letters that she had received at Jedburgh and
  Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>"I had good reason to write them," he replied, trying to resist the joy
  that her submission gave him.</p>

  <p>"What is the cause of your sickness?" she asked delicately.</p>

  <p>He shrugged his wide shoulders on the fringed pillows. "Some say the
  plague and some say poison; some say the pox, of which there is enough in
  Glasgow, and I say&mdash;you who sit there."</p>

  <p>"Ah," she replied softly, "so it would seem that we destroy one another.
  All say that you were the cause that I nearly died at Jedburgh."</p>

  <p>"If I have wronged you, I have made offers of repentance. I have failed in
  much towards you, but others have given you greater offence and you have
  pardoned them many times."</p>

  <p>"So, too, have I pardoned you," she whispered, looking at him steadily.
  "Many times."</p>

  <p>"I am young," he replied sullenly. "I am destitute of good advice. I came
  into a strange country and into the midst of difficult happenings. Have I not
  a chance to repent?"</p>

  <p>"You offended deeply," said the Queen, but gently and smiling.</p>

  <p>"Howsoever that may be," he replied, "I ask your pardon."</p>

  <p>"What do you hope for now?" she asked curiously. "What do you want?"</p>

  <p>He moved towards her on the bed and she shrank back slightly, noticing his
  bandaged hands, and the smell of ill-health that came from his body, even
  through the perfume of the ointments.</p>

  <p>"I ask nothing else but that we may be together as husband and wife," came
  the unnatural sounding voice behind his mask. "What else is there for me but
  that? If you say no, I desire that I may never rise from this bed again. Ay,
  though I am not yet one-and-twenty years old, I have no desire to go on
  living. Give me an answer."</p>

  <p>"I had not thought you had been so fond."</p>

  <p>"Fond! God knows how I am punished for making you my idol, having no other
  thought but you. So it was from the first, Mary. I did not think so much of
  being King, although they pushed me on to snatch at that&mdash;it was you,
  those days at Stirling."</p>

  <p>She did not answer and he hurried on, losing his reserve, his
  embarrassment, because of the mask and the half-shadows and the fact that
  they were alone together after so long a time. All the events that troubled
  him since their last meeting seemed vague, almost effaced. "You were the
  cause why I offended you," he said strangely. "Never, save for a short while
  at first, did you treat me as your husband. If, for my refuge, I, who have
  been much alone in Scotland, could have opened my mind to you&mdash;but," he
  raised his hand and let it fall, "we were not as husband and wife ought to
  be, and I had to keep everything to myself, and so I am come to this
  desolation and jealousy. Perhaps I was mistaken in my jealousy, you are so
  much cleverer than I."</p>

  <p>The Queen, still looking at him curiously and drawn back in her chair,
  said: "I am sorry for your sickness and I will try to find a remedy for it. I
  have good physicians if you will use them." Leaning forward, she added
  suddenly: "Why would you have gone away from Scotland in the English ship?
  Was not that to shame me and leave me abandoned and ridiculous?"</p>

  <p>"Surely," he replied vehemently, "it is I who have been abandoned and
  ridiculous. How often have I come to you, and you have denied me, because
  there has been another within?"</p>

  <p>He saw that she braced herself in fear of the name of David Rizzio. He did
  not say it, but muttered instead: "Moray, or Bothwell, or Huntly, some enemy
  of mine. Then, in other ways what has been my use? Not only have you taken
  all dignities from me and even the shadow of the Crown, but you know as well
  as I, I have had nothing to keep myself or my servants."</p>

  <p>The Queen lifted her shoulder a little and he asked: "Why did you come
  here?"</p>

  <p>When she did not answer he stared through the mask-holes and said:</p>

  <p>"I ought to be warned and armed against you, but you are my own proper
  flesh and I do not think that you would do me harm. And if any other should
  try it," he added, "they shall buy it dear, unless they take me sleeping."
  Then as she sat motionless he added: "But I suspect nothing."</p>

  <p>"Whom should you suspect?" she replied. "All is mended with those who were
  your enemies, no one desires anything but peace and reconciliation, and the
  good government of Scotland."</p>

  <p>"No one?" he asked. "Not Moray nor Morton? Mary, why did you recall those
  men who offended you so grievously?"</p>

  <p>"To prove that I have forgotten as I have long since forgiven. What other
  reason could I have?"</p>

  <p>"I thought it might be that you set them on the trail of another victim
  knowing them to be well skilled at murder. You forced me to betray them. For
  you I denied them."</p>

  <p>"Your sickness," she replied, "has given you evil dreams."</p>

  <p>She rose as if to leave, and even the threat of her withdrawal upset
  him.</p>

  <p>"Keep me company," he implored. "Stay with me to-night. Have you only come
  here for this little talk?"</p>

  <p>"I have nothing more to say now," she said gently. "I must abide in my own
  lodgings. You have mistaken much&mdash;but I did not come for
  reproaches."</p>

  <p>She stood pensive by the chair and he asked why she was so sad.</p>

  <p>"Truly," she replied, "I have not much cause for happiness. I have brought
  a litter with me to carry you more comfortably than you could go on
  horseback. I thought that I could lodge you at Craigmillar so that I might
  stay with you and not be far from our little son."</p>

  <p>"Our son!" he muttered, then added: "A sick man should not travel in a
  litter and in so cold weather."</p>

  <p>"Well," said she, "you cannot sit on horseback, that I can see. It is said
  you have a great weakness. Why do you wear that mask, Harry?"</p>

  <p>He said:</p>

  <p>"I would not be seen until I am cured."</p>

  <p>"Well," she said, "you can have the baths at Craigmillar and be purged and
  clean. Will you come with me?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, I will come, if we may be at board and bed together as husband and
  wife, and you promise to leave me no more."</p>

  <p>"You want that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, if you promise this on your word, I will go where you please.
  Without it I will not go."</p>

  <p>The Queen smiled again. Her expression was quite timid and humble.</p>

  <p>"If I had not been minded to make peace with you, Harry, would I have come
  so far in this winter weather, give you my hand as the pledge of my body that
  I would love and use you as my husband?"</p>

  <p>"Do you give me that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>He moved along the bed towards her as if he would take her hand, but she
  stepped lightly out of his reach and told him again that before they could
  come together he must be healed of his sickness. She then asked him if he
  trusted everybody, if he had any evil in his heart towards anyone? He
  replied:</p>

  <p>"I make little count of any of them."</p>

  <p>"Are you angry that Lady Reres is in my company?"</p>

  <p>"I have little mind for such as she," replied the King, "I hope to God she
  serves you honourably."</p>

  <p>"Well," said the Queen smiling, "I will come again after supper."</p>

  <p>"Do you call this a reconciliation?" he asked from the pillow. "You will
  not come near me nor as much as touch my hand!"</p>

  <p>At that she approached him steadily and stood within the bedcurtains.</p>

  <p>"There have been some words gone before this, Harry, and it takes a little
  time for us to be as we were. Besides, your sickness&mdash;" her composure
  faltered. "Do not tell the Lords of any promise I have made you, it may be
  there are some would grudge you my favour."</p>

  <p>At that he was angered and cried:</p>

  <p>"I know no cause why they should mislike me. Are we not husband and wife?
  Look to it, Mary, you do not move any against me."</p>

  <p>"I swear I will stir no one against you."</p>

  <p>"We must work in one mind or both of us may be ruined."</p>

  <p>"You speak very coolly and wisely," she replied. "I had not known you so
  prudent before."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I have been learning some hard lessons and now have them by
  heart. It is not so long since I was at school, and though at first I always
  shirked my tasks, in the end I got them perfect."</p>

  <p>"Well," said she, "I have never wronged you. The troubles you have in
  Scotland are of your own making."</p>

  <p>"Ay," he replied, "my faults are known, but there are those that have made
  worse ones which have never been published."</p>

  <p>She bent over him as if to kiss him, but withdrew without touching him and
  put her finger on her lips, with a soothing gesture of one who would quiet an
  invalid, and so withdrew to where, in the ante-chamber, two of her French
  girls, the Italian boy, and Lady Reres were waiting and whispering
  together.</p>

  <p>As soon as he was alone the King struck upon a bell and ordered John
  Taylor to call Thomas Crawford, his father's gentleman, who had lately been
  in attendance on him and who was a shrewd and loyal man.</p>

  <p>Then he pulled off the mask so violently that the ribbons snapped, for it
  irritated his inflamed face.</p>

  <p>Thomas Crawford came quickly, for Lennox had told him to watch, listen and
  report, and he had been in a little closet, listening through a hole cut in
  the wall hidden behind the tapestry, so the King who was already weary, had
  not to repeat more than a few wards of what the Queen had said, except the
  sentences she had spoken in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"What do you think, Crawford, of my journey to Edinburgh?"</p>

  <p>"Sir, I do not like it. Why should the Queen's Grace take you to
  Craigmillar? Why not to your own house in Edinburgh rather than to a private
  gentleman's mansion two miles out of town?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, why indeed?" said the sick man, tossing from side to side as if in
  pain.</p>

  <p>"In my opinion," said Crawford, "she takes Your Grace more like a prisoner
  than like her husband."</p>

  <p>The young man sat up in his bed and looked at his friend.</p>

  <p>"I think little less myself," he replied with dignity. "I have nothing
  save my confidence in her promise."</p>

  <p>"And do you, sir, trust in that?" asked Thomas Crawford, lowering his
  voice and looking round, as if the Queen's presence was still somewhere in
  the room. Henry Stewart made the sign of the Cross.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I will put myself in her hands though she should cut my throat. I
  pray God to judge between us."</p>

  <p>The Queen sat up late that night in her lodgings in Glasgow. She was
  knitting a bracelet of purple silk, in which she was twisting a design of
  golden beads. Now and then she paused in this employment to write hastily a
  few lines on an odd sheet of paper which lay before her on a small table.</p>

  <p>The fire was out on the hearth, but she did not notice. Once she rose to
  draw the curtains more closely, for about two in the morning a strong wind
  rose and shook the very walls of the ancient house.</p>

  <p>No one knew she was sitting up, not even Lady Reres. She moved cautiously
  and sheltered her candle behind the cabinet so that no ray of light might
  fall underneath the door.</p>

  <p>She shivered a little. She was haunted by the past yet released from it;
  she no longer felt caged and confined by rules even if she had never obeyed
  them. She had always been reckless and now her spirit seemed united with one
  as reckless, as bold as herself&mdash;the man to whom she wrote an account of
  her interview with her husband, intermingled with expressions of love.</p>

  <p>She thought of her husband without emotion. How different he was, or else
  how skilful at pretending! Did he flatter her because he was afraid? Who
  could ever believe him? He had lied to her and to all Scotland, betraying his
  accomplices so lightly, and all the while she had in the casket where she had
  thrown the scarlet wedding-ring, the two bonds that he had signed for the
  murder of David.</p>

  <p>No doubt he had lied again yesterday when he had told her he had made his
  god of her.</p>

  <p>She held out the bracelet in the candlelight; she wished to finish it
  before the morning so that it could go with the letter. She must tell him to
  be careful where he wore it&mdash;up on his arm, yet even there
  carefully&mdash;he might be wounded or taken suddenly sick and several people
  had seen her knitting it.</p>

  <p>She rose and looked in the jewel casket she had brought with her for gold
  clasps to finish the bracelet. She might make it too large, when it would
  slip down to his wrist, or too small, so that he could not get it up to his
  arm&mdash;she shrugged and smiled. When she had found the clasps she stood
  still for a while listening to the tempest and found pleasure in the sound of
  the wind rushing past the windows and the heavy splashing of the rain against
  the casement.</p>

  <p>Would it be so easy? Surely somebody would warn him&mdash;one of those
  forty horsemen who, alert and suspicious, had ridden out to meet her, or
  Thomas Crawford, who had dogged her every step, who was no doubt hidden in a
  closet listening to the interview, or his father, always crafty, sly and
  suspicious. Would none of these warn him? Would he, on her word only, follow
  her to where he would be unprotected in the hands of his enemies?</p>

  <p>"The fool," she muttered with disgust. "Why must I think of him so
  much?"</p>

  <p>That she could beguile him so easily filled her with contempt for him. She
  shuddered with physical repugnance as she recalled the night at Stirling. How
  could she ever have seen a golden Adonis in that stupid youth! Now he was
  like a leper, bandaged, detestable behind the mask which he had worn to hide
  a disfigured face. The smell of his breath, the sweat from his body not
  disguised by strong perfume, reminded her sickeningly of the days and nights
  she had passed with her first husband.</p>

  <p>Yet she was sorry for the way it had to be done. She liked the grand, open
  action.</p>

  <p>"I have never deceived anybody," she scribbled on the nearly filled piece
  of paper, then laughed thinking what a lie that was. Though she did not like
  this manner of intrigue, her whole life had been a lie. Yet she could not
  blame herself, she had acted as she had been taught, as she had been
  forced.</p>

  <p>A pity it could not have been done quickly, without this to-do. Suddenly,
  as David had been disposed of&mdash;or John Gordon, or Chastelard.</p>

  <p>Supposing he really trusted her? She turned that thought over in her mind,
  as she sat above the unfinished letter listening to the wind and the rain,
  her glance fixed before her on the half-light of the single candle. She did
  not feel any compassion for him, but she had a faint feeling that some other
  woman in her situation might have been melted by pity, might have dwelt on
  his helplessness, on his youth, on the bad luck he had had and her treatment
  of him from the first, how she had seduced him, used him, flung him aside.
  Perhaps another woman might have thought like that. But she had written in
  her letter: "My heart is as the diamond and you need not fear but I shall do
  it."</p>

  <p>She was one with the man to whom she wrote, one purpose, one courage, one
  desire, and he, like herself, was married to one of a false race. She thought
  of her lover and smiled. What had he asked of her? Only to bring the fool to
  Edinburgh. There had been no word of anything else.</p>

  <p>She finished the bracelet, put it down on the letter, and thought of Jane
  Gordon as she had stood before her in Edinburgh Castle. "That was the night
  when I thought I was going to die in a few hours. How sly she was, Huntly's
  daughter, how cunning and full of lies&mdash;she said he loved her."</p>

  <p>The Queen began to laugh softly, remembering her need for secrecy. How
  could Jane Gordon know what love was any more than Henry Stewart knew?</p>

  <p>She finished her letter and sealed it. Strange, whatever one did, however
  one manoeuvred, it came in the end to blood. One could not escape&mdash;that
  was the way of it. No doubt it was foolish to try to escape. When she had
  been very young she had been shocked and frightened by violence, and now she
  had learnt that the world was like that. She had fainted when she had seen
  John Gordon mangled on the block, but she had not lost her senses when she
  knew that Pierre de Chastelard had been executed. She had shrugged and gone
  on with her play. What else was possible?</p>

  <p>When she had ridden outside she had had to see corpses hanging on the
  gallows, decaying heads stuck on spikes over gateways; she had had to know
  that people every day were being tortured and killed in Edinburgh. Sometimes
  even while she feasted she had been aware that executions took place by
  torchlight in the market place.</p>

  <p>Well, she had had to accept that. When she had been Queen of France, her
  relations, the Guise, had beheaded the Huguenots in the courtyard of Amboise
  for an after-dinner diversion for the ladies. One could not escape blood,
  violence, treachery.</p>

  <p>Why regret this man more than another? He was a murderer and blood cried
  for blood. She thought of the Italian's face as he crouched in the corner of
  her closet. She recalled his shrieks as he had been dragged away. Who had had
  any pity then?</p>

  <p>She folded up her bracelet. How tired she was, scarcely recovered from
  that illness at Jedburgh and burdened by the secret child. There was a
  constant pain in her side and often when alone she collapsed from fatigue,
  though in public she kept erect and gay.</p>

  <p>Would this be the end of it? Would this man into whose hands she had given
  all she had turn out to be the King and master for whom she was looking?</p>

  <p>She thought of Moray. What part did he play, with Maitland? He was always
  there, serene, cool, advising her. Did he know what was being planned? She
  went over carefully in her mind the last time she had seen him. She had cried
  out in an excess of emotion against her husband, saying she must have a
  divorce, she must somehow be rid of him, yet she would have no speck upon her
  honour nor any slur upon her child.</p>

  <p>Moray had said nothing, but Maitland had replied&mdash;she felt he was her
  half-brother's mouthpiece:</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty is a Papist and scrupulous, and my Lord Moray is a
  Protestant and scrupulous, yet if Your Grace and his lordship will leave all
  to your faithful friends, you may trust that the young man will be gotten rid
  of without reproach to Your Majesty or to your son."</p>

  <p>She had inquired no further. Only when her master had given her
  instructions to fetch her husband from Glasgow she had obeyed without
  question.</p>

  <p>Her need was very great. He must not leave her, he must not guess the
  truth, she must marry her lover. She would not be ashamed openly, she would
  not bear a bastard before all Europe. She wanted the child. She thought that
  only in the child could she finally express and relieve the passion that was
  consuming her, but it must be born in wedlock.</p>

  <p>She silenced her thoughts, it was better not to think; there was so much
  to be done. When it was over she would go away to some solitary place and
  have her child in secret, with only Mary Seaton and Lady Reres. She would
  stay in retirement so long that no one would know when it was born and she
  would not be shamed.</p>

  <p>Did anyone suspect? Did even Lady Reres or Mary Seaton guess?</p>

  <p>From utter weariness, the long ride, and the long watching, she fell
  asleep at last, the bright, disordered chestnut hair falling across the
  letter and the bracelet, while the candle guttered and went out.</p>

  <p>When she woke she was in darkness. She rose and pulled the curtains apart
  and saw it was dawn. At once her alert mind recalled every circumstance of
  her situation.</p>

  <p>She quietly left her room and went down the corridor to where the Italian
  lodged, and knocked on his door.</p>

  <p>He was waiting for some such signal and he was there instantly, ready
  dressed.</p>

  <p>"Give these to Paris," whispered the Queen. "You know for whom."</p>

  <p>Then she hurried back to her room and fell on to her bed while Giuseppe
  tiptoed to the closet where Paris was and roused him where he slept.</p>

  <p>There was no need for the Italian to tell him what he was to do with the
  letter and the packet. These two knew all the secrets of their master and
  mistress. A smile and a nod was sufficient. The dainty Frenchman, cursing the
  bleak northern weather, set out from Glasgow with the Queen's letter and
  present to Earl Bothwell safely hidden in his coat.</p>

  <p>Thomas Crawford urged Lord Lennox to persuade his son to remain in Glasgow
  where he was safe. The old man was afflicted by a bleeding from the nose and
  could scarcely move, but he sent a message to the King, imploring him not to
  leave or put himself in the hands of a woman who had so often deceived him or
  the power of men whom he had so grievously offended. Lennox implored Crawford
  to remind the King's Grace that one who was now in favour at Holyrood was a
  sorcerer. What did his own bleeding at the nose portend? Misfortune, as
  everyone knew!</p>

  <p>Henry Stewart listened gravely to these warnings and made the sign of the
  Cross. But nothing could change his resolve, he had decided to trust his
  wife.</p>

  <p>The King allowed himself to be placed in the litter that the Queen had
  brought, and without escort or any more of his own people than a few
  servants, accompanied her from Glasgow to Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>She told him that she had found Craigmillar inconvenient, but that she had
  taken a lodging for him near Holyrood, where he could not go for fear of
  infection to the Prince.</p>

  <p>He asked if this was the new house of the Hamiltons recently built outside
  the city walls, and she said "No; was she likely to lodge him with his
  enemies?" Besides, the Archbishop of St. Andrews dwelt there himself.</p>

  <p>She had, however, she said, a nice house for him that was not far away. It
  was part of the monastic buildings in the Church of St. Mary, which the
  Reformers had lately destroyed; it was in good repair and on healthy
  ground.</p>

  <p>When the cavalcade, which travelled slowly because of the sick man,
  halted, it was at this house. The Church of St. Mary in the field near by,
  was ruined and rootless; the cloisters had long since been disused. The spot
  was lonely and the city walls nearby were broken down. Beyond were some
  gardens and orchards and a desolate road with some alms-houses on one side
  known as "Thieves Row."</p>

  <p>But the house in which the King was lodged was in good repair, though it
  was a long time since it had been lived in and the spot though desolate, was
  convenient for Holyrood, away from the stench and noise of the city. It had
  also been very handsomely furnished.</p>

  <p>When the King was carried to the lower apartment and saw the French
  tapestries on the walls, the Chair of Estate in watered yellow and red silk,
  and the fine carpets on the floor, he asked who had been to this trouble for
  him, and the Queen replied that she had given her instructions and that it
  was Lord Bothwell who had carried them out.</p>

  <p>He was escorted upstairs, helped under either arm by his English servants,
  and found his bedchamber arranged with equal costliness. He noticed that the
  bed that had been set up was the one which he had first seen in Stirling
  Castle, in which, secretly, he had first slept with the Queen.</p>

  <p>As he was placed between the scented sheets and the silken coverlets, the
  Queen said:</p>

  <p>"This belonged to my mother. I have no handsomer bed-furniture, and, sir,
  I made it my gift to you."</p>

  <p>He lay back, exhausted by the journey, and took the taffeta covering off
  his face for he could not longer endure it, his weakness having been
  increased by the journey through the cold and rain.</p>

  <p>"Will you sleep here?" he asked. "Remember your promise, Mary&mdash;we
  were to be as husband and wife!"</p>

  <p>"When you are cleansed," she said smiling, looking steadily at his
  blotched face. "The bath has been set up in the next room, and my physician
  has prepared the cures and will direct it all."</p>

  <p>She then said with an air of great exhaustion that the pain in her side
  troubled her, and left him, going, as he thought, to the room below, which he
  had heard had been prepared for her. But presently the English boy, Taylor,
  came to him and told him that the Queen had left the house and gone with all
  her train by torchlight to Holy-rood; she had left a message saying she would
  return in the morning.</p>

  <p>"Well," said the King, "I have put all into her hands. She has been at
  some pains to make this an agreeable lodging, and I have nothing to lament.
  What manner of house are we in? I do not remember having ever been here when
  I was in Edinburgh before."</p>

  <p>"Sir, it is the old Provost's House and has not been lived in for many a
  day. Mr. Standen thinks it is damp, and no place for a sick man. None of your
  servants, sir, is pleased."</p>

  <p>"Well, no doubt they are uneasy, but we are safe enough relying on her
  word. Who lodges near, have you found out?"</p>

  <p>"Sir, as I say, the whole place is ruinous. The cloisters are empty, the
  houses to right and left uninhabited and without furniture. We are near the
  city wall, some two miles from the Abbey. I think Your Grace should have a
  guard ..." The youth paused, fearing lest he had said too much, and when his
  voice ceased there was utter silence in the room.</p>

  <p>The King thought: This is a strange, desolate place to bring me. But some
  nobility, deeper than all the habits and circumstances of his life, silenced
  his misgivings. He had been in fear of his life, but once he had said that he
  would trust her he refused to entertain any doubt. She was his wife before
  God and she had passed to him her word as woman and princess. He clung
  desperately to that simple consolation.</p>

  <p>He was also reassured by her magnificent gift. Had she not meant, when she
  had these violet-brown and crimson draperies set up, to remind him of the
  night in Stirling, when they had pledged themselves to each other for
  ever?</p>

  <p>He looked about him at the room&mdash;at the vessels of agate and onyx,
  the bowls of alabaster and crystal, the lights in silver and gilt sticks, the
  chests of garments which John Taylor was opening, in which were gifts of furs
  and rolls of cloth of gold and damask armour, and jewelled swords and knives.
  Surely she meant their reconciliation to be complete.</p>

  <p>"Boy, did the Queen's Grace say Lord Bothwell furnished this house for
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, so she said."</p>

  <p>"Why do you look so frightened, Taylor, when you speak that name?" And the
  King smiled, remembering Bothwell's reputation as a sorcerer, smiled to hide
  a sudden pang he had felt himself.</p>

  <p>He believed Bothwell his friend, much as he had at first feared and
  mistrusted the Queen's last favourite. He had shown himself on his side in
  the quarrel with Moray. At one time Bothwell alone of all the court had
  supported the King.</p>

  <p>"A sorcerer," said the English boy, crossing himself, and he added with a
  peculiar vehemence: "No one can be easy, sir, until Earl Bothwell has left
  Scotland."</p>

  <p>"He does not disturb me," said the King, "you are a little fool. Say your
  prayers and you can despise a wizard's tricks. What is the nearest house?" he
  added.</p>

  <p>"The Hamiltons' house, sir&mdash;the Duke's place. There is noise and
  lights there to-night; they say the Archbishop has taken up his
  residence."</p>

  <p>"Well, I suppose I must be reconciled with them too. Bring me up some
  wine, then I'll sleep. I think it true that the air is good here, I feel
  revived already."</p>

  <p>The English boy left to execute his master's orders and found the two
  Antony Standens grumbling about the lonely place where their master and
  themselves had been lodged.</p>

  <p>"The King seems bewitched that he is so satisfied."</p>

  <p>"Earl Bothwell prepared this state lodging."</p>

  <p>Angry, uneasy, they made themselves as comfortable as they could in their
  new lodgings, wondering how a proud woman like the Queen could put up with a
  sorcerer.</p>

  <p>On the first morning of the King's lodging in the Provost House of St.
  Mary's monastery, which was known to the people of Edinburgh as Kirk o'
  Field, a man who lodged in the Canongate and worked for a silversmith,
  knocked up the King's household and begged that he might be brought into His
  Grace's presence.</p>

  <p>This was refused, for he had no business to state and seemed in confusion.
  But he was very anxious and the two Antony Standens followed him when he was
  turned away, and walking with him down the ruined cloisters where the walls
  were covered with damp and the wet lay in pools in the broken flagstones,
  asked him what he wanted.</p>

  <p>But he, with the English gentlemen on either side of him, seemed suddenly
  terrified. The sudden emotion which had sent him on his errand had died down.
  He did not want to speak and tried to get away.</p>

  <p>But they forced him to tell his business, which, as far as they could make
  out from his Scots accent, was that last night he had dreamed he had seen a
  man lying in an orchard with his neck broken, stark naked, with his eyes
  staring and when the sleeper had awakened the horror had been so real that,
  hardly knowing what he did, he had come to the old house where the King was,
  hardly knowing why. but almost without his own volition.</p>

  <p>At this the two Englishmen let him go. They did not ask if, nor did he
  volunteer this knowledge, he had seen and recognized the face of the dead
  naked man in the orchard. But it was in their thoughts.</p>

  <p>The King had been a week in the handsomely furnished house in Kirk o'
  Field, and hour by hour his health and confidence returned. The Queen came to
  visit him daily with almost every noble in Scotland in her train to pay him
  homage and wish him a good recovery. None of these showed more service and
  friendliness than Earl Bothwell, to whom the young King took an increased
  liking, finding this elegant and accomplished man far more to his taste than
  the grim, gloomy and rough Lords with whom he had been in league over David's
  murder. He decided when he was recovered and King indeed, with possession of
  the realm and the Queen, to confirm Bothwell in his high post.</p>

  <p>Moray came to visit the King also, and his presence further reassured
  Henry Stewart, for the Queen's half-brother, whom he had always feared and
  dreaded, spoke to him frankly of the future of Scotland, of his wife and
  child, and the peace to which they might all look forward.</p>

  <p>But of what was happening in the outer world, the King knew nothing. He
  had such news of his wife and her friends brought to his sick chamber as his
  servants and the English gentlemen could collect, and this was very little,
  for everything seemed quiet enough in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The care of the French physician, renewed hope, and expectancy of better
  things to come, brought a quick recovery to the strong young man. The scars
  of his disease began to heal on his body, his strength returned.</p>

  <p>He began to pester the Queen for an end to what was, after all, a kind of
  captivity, agreeable though she might try to make it, and to beg that she
  would take him again to Holyrood, to his former rooms with the stair that led
  to her apartments. When he said this she gave him a cunning look, and he
  thought of David and said hastily: Could not they lodge somewhere else in the
  Abbey and not in the old tower? To which she replied: "I lodge there no
  longer."</p>

  <p>Two nights she had slept under his room in Kirk o' Field, and a third
  night she had intended, she said, to sleep there also; but when she came on
  the evening of the day that she had promised to stay, she told him that she
  had forgotten two of her servants were to be married that evening, and she
  had promised to attend the ball and banquet, not that she had much heart to
  do so while he lay sick, but that she would not hurt these kind, faithful
  people. She told him that one was Sebastian Page, whom he might remember at
  the christening feast, for he had arranged the masque of satyrs' tails which
  had offended the English and caused a brawl. She laughed with him over the
  old story that Englishmen had short, fat tails like stags.</p>

  <p>"Well," said the King, "I would not deprive you of your merriment nor your
  kindness, but look to it you come again soon. Indeed, I feel that I could
  walk now and even ride horseback."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said she, "we might ride to-morrow. The weather is suddenly
  better; there was some sun to-day."</p>

  <p>"Yet none in this chamber," he smiled. "Who will be at your banquet?"</p>

  <p>She told him all of them&mdash;Argyll, Huntly, Bothwell, Lord Robert
  Stewart, Cassilis; but Moray would not be there, for his wife was ill and he
  had gone to visit her in her country house.</p>

  <p>The King expressing again his impatience and loneliness in this desolate
  lodging, the Queen asked if she had failed in any service or duty towards
  him, if he had not found everything to his taste?</p>

  <p>He told her that it was so and that he lacked only her company, and then
  on a casual recollection, asked her if she had been having the bed put up or
  down in the room beneath his for he had heard noises during that day and had
  sent the page boy down to see what was happening, but he had found both doors
  locked&mdash;to the garden and to the street.</p>

  <p>The Queen replied, "Yes, I am having the bed altered. I do not think I
  shall have need for it any more, for I do not think we need lie apart any
  longer. We may meet in the same bed to-morrow at Holyrood, then you will
  believe that I do mean a reconciliation towards you."</p>

  <p>She stooped towards him as she spoke, her face, usually so pale, was
  flushed, and beneath the winter cloak that she wore he saw the glitter of the
  emeralds on her dress. He took her hand and kissed it, the first time that he
  had touched her for weeks, for despite her friendliness she had never allowed
  him to come close. Now she did not repel him, but looked down, smiling, at
  his bent head.</p>

  <p>"Do you believe me yet?" she asked, taking her hand from him.</p>

  <p>She slipped from her finger the scarlet ring which he had not seen her
  wear since the night of David's murder, when she had sent it to him by Lady
  Argyll. She put it in his palm.</p>

  <p>"A ring, a pledge, after the manner of lovers, to assure you of my
  faith."</p>

  <p>Reassured, happy in his returning strength, the young man gazed at her as
  she stood there in the candlelight. Then she spoke, and her words were as
  unexpected as they were horrible to the listener.</p>

  <p>"It is nearly a year since the slaying of David."</p>

  <p>"Is this your reconciliation?" he cried reproachfully.</p>

  <p>"I do not know why it came into my mind."</p>

  <p>She smiled at him again, renewed her promises for the morning, and was
  gone, leaving him staring at the red enamel ring in the palm of his hand.</p>

  <p>He heard her leave and the house seemed very silent, so that he called up
  the chamber-boy and asked where the Antony Standens were.</p>

  <p>They had gone to the ball at Holyrood given for the marriages of Sebastian
  Page and Christine Hogg, so that the King had only five servants with him in
  the lonely house.</p>

  <p>He called them all in for company's sake and asked them to fetch wine.
  Then he drank their health, saying that they had been faithful to him in his
  sickness and he would see they were rewarded, for happier days were coming
  when they should see him as King.</p>

  <p>They pledged him and left, going to their sleeping apartments which were
  in a corridor at right-angles to his room. Only John Taylor remained. It was
  late, but the King did not want to sleep.</p>

  <p>He got out of bed and walked up and down the room, while the English boy,
  half-asleep, sat on the bedstep and waited his master's pleasure.</p>

  <p>The King took up a lute and began to sing. He broke off in the middle and
  said moodily:</p>

  <p>"The Queen's Grace spoke of the slaying of Rizzio to-night. It is a long
  time since she has mentioned that."</p>

  <p>"Sir, it would be because it is nearly a year ago," replied the boy. "Will
  you not get into bed, sir, and rest? The doctor said you should not force
  your strength."</p>

  <p>"Did that letter go to my father?" asked the King restlessly. "The one
  wherein I told him that my dear love, the Queen and I, were reconciled."</p>

  <p>"Sir, I sent it as you bid me&mdash;at once. My lord should have had it
  two days ago."</p>

  <p>"I must try to sleep."</p>

  <p>The young man sat on the edge of the bed, but instead of getting in it he
  said:</p>

  <p>"We will sing the fifth Psalm."</p>

  <p>The page looked at him in surprise. But obediently found the book where
  the Psalms were set to music in English, a version which Henry Stewart
  liked.</p>

  <p>The page propped up the book against a chair, took another lute, and in
  the silence of the lonely house the two young men began to sing.</p>

  <p>There was a tap on the door and the King called out to whoever it was to
  enter. Another of his English servants came in, holding a candle in one hand
  and under his arm a shoe of satin. He put it down on the chair in front of
  the open Book of Psalms.</p>

  <p>"I found that in the grass just now. See, sir, it is covered with dew or
  rain."</p>

  <p>"Well," asked the King, "what of it? What is this mystery?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know, sir, God forgive me! Twenty minutes or so ago I heard a
  noise and looked out very quietly from my casement. I saw one without whom I
  knew to be William Powrie, Earl Bothwell's porter&mdash;I recognized him in
  the light in the porch&mdash;but when I went down to see what his business
  was, he was gone and I could find no one. And I went out, looking round, and
  then in the grass I came upon this. It is a man's dancing slipper."</p>

  <p>"It is one belonging to one of the Lords in attendance on the Queen,
  probably," said the King. "Take it away." The man hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Sir, why should Earl Bothwell's porter be here?"</p>

  <p>"I expect you are mistaken," replied the King indifferently, "but if it
  were he, he might have come about some of the furniture which they moved
  beneath."</p>

  <p>"Ay, sir, that's it," said the Englishman. "What is it they do move
  beneath? There's no getting into the room, it is locked on either side, and
  the window is curtained from within."</p>

  <p>"What should be in there?" replied the King with contempt. "What fancies
  have you got now?"</p>

  <p>"Sir, the place is very lonely and we are strangers here; you, sir, as
  much as I."</p>

  <p>The King was silent, and the other two looked at him anxiously in the
  light of the candles. Then he said to himself, frowning:</p>

  <p>"I declared that I would trust her and that God must judge between
  us."</p>

  <p>Then he told the servant to go to bed and leave him for he wanted to
  finish singing his psalm.</p>

  <p>But the anxious manservant, still holding the gentleman's shoe, broke
  in:</p>

  <p>"Sir, Earl Bothwell's Frenchman was here to-night. He was in that room
  underneath, and when the Queen was mounting her horse, he came out, and she
  said to him, laughing: 'Jesu, Paris, how grimed you are!' and then he blushed
  red."</p>

  <p>"What was he grimed with?" asked the King.</p>

  <p>"I do not know, sir. He is always painted, and to-night over the red and
  white was a certain black&mdash;I thought it gunpowder."</p>

  <p>The three listened intently. It was a still night and there was no
  sound.</p>

  <p>"I hear nothing," said the King.</p>

  <p>But the servant insisted that he could detect, though faintly, footsteps
  below.</p>

  <p>"It is one of the others moving about. Go and see what it is," said Henry
  Stewart.</p>

  <p>As the man left the room on tiptoe, leaving the door open behind him, the
  King rose, telling the boy to shut up the Book of Psalms and put away the
  lute.</p>

  <p>"Everything is absolutely still, I hear nothing. Why was that fellow so
  disturbed?"</p>

  <p>"Sir, I do not know," replied Jahn Taylor, trying to master his own
  agitation and wondering why the King was so calm. "It is true the place is
  very lonely. Hark, sir! There is someone below."</p>

  <p>The King stood erect, listening.</p>

  <p>Yes, there could be no mistake now, there were footsteps to be
  heard&mdash;those, he thought, of several men.</p>

  <p>He looked sharply at John Taylor and saw that the boy had run to the
  window.</p>

  <p>"Sir, quickly! There is someone coming up! This way! We can get through to
  the orchard!"</p>

  <p>"If they have come for me," said the King, "they have ringed the house and
  there will be no escape."</p>

  <p>He went to the window and opened it, feeling on his face the sudden cold
  of the winter night. As he leaned over the bent figure of the page trying to
  see what was below, the boy looking round suddenly shrieked. The King
  turned.</p>

  <p>In the doorway that his servant had left open he saw Archibald Douglas,
  one of the murderers of David, wearing a dark mantle and with one shoe.
  Behind him showed the face of Giuseppe Rizzio, and behind both of them,
  picked out of the shadow by the light of the candles were the pale eyes of
  Earl Bothwell.</p>

  <p>The Queen had left the marriage festivities early and was walking up and
  down the Presence Chamber sometimes pausing before the door of her oratory,
  though she never opened it.</p>

  <p>About two o'clock, she went into her bedchamber where a bright fire was
  burning. Mary Seaton had fallen asleep in a deep chair beside the hearth, and
  as the Queen entered with the lightest of steps, she sprang up. The Queen
  stood rigid, though with no sign of terror. A sound like a cannonade
  penetrated the seven-foot-thick walls of the tower.</p>

  <p>Mary Seaton fell on her knees. What had happened? The English! A surprise
  attack! Rebels! Firing from the castle! The Queen put her hand over the
  girl's mouth.</p>

  <p>"Listen! It does not come again. It is an accident&mdash;an explosion
  somewhere."</p>

  <p>"Oh, God! Oh, madame! Oh, Jesu! Oh, Holy Virgin!"</p>

  <p>"Go," said the Queen under her breath, "out to the head of the stairs and
  listen."</p>

  <p>"Madame, I dare not, on my soul I dare not!"</p>

  <p>"Then I will go."</p>

  <p>The Queen crossed the Chamber of Presence and the ante-room, and came out
  on the head of the stairs. There were people running about, crying in fright,
  issuing incoherent orders in the confusion. The echoes of the tremendous
  sound still hung about the palace.</p>

  <p>The Queen went back into her rooms and shut the doors on this hubbub. When
  they came to search for her they found her seated on the throne. All the
  light she had came from the torches in the courtyard that flickered across
  the open windows.</p>

  <p>At first the group that broke in on her were frightened and fell back as
  if they had seen a dead woman enthroned there, she was so pale, and it seemed
  such a strange place for her to be at this hour, but she spoke calmly and
  asked why they had left her so long alone and in some peril, as she might
  suppose? What was, the tumult and the noise? She looked at them carefully as
  they came forward, one of them holding a large lantern the light of which
  fell on the hem of her gown trailing down the steps of the throne.</p>

  <p>Argyll, Huntly, and Atholl, the wives of the Earls of Mar and Atholl, Sir
  William Maitland were there: it was he who held the lantern. He was fully
  dressed but the others were in their nightgowns except for Bothwell, who wore
  a heavy cavalry cloak over his clothes.</p>

  <p>Lady Mar fell on her knees on the steps of the throne and began to ask if
  Her Majesty could bear ill news?</p>

  <p>"I am used to it," said the Queen, and looked past the kneeling woman to
  the men. She beckoned Bothwell forward. "Can you speak?" she asked. "I have
  not usually found you tongue-tied."</p>

  <p>"Madame, there has occurred a monstrous chance which everyone wonders at.
  The King's lodging, even to the very foundations, has been blown in the air.
  All the building is ruined."</p>

  <p>"Ah! And the King?"</p>

  <p>"Everyone," breathed Maitland, taking the words from Bothwell, "is in such
  terror, there are such fearful rumours&mdash;the whole house has fallen, the
  very stones ground into powder from what can be seen by torchlight."</p>

  <p>"And the King?" repeated the Queen, rising and holding on to the arms of
  the throne as if she took command not only of them, but of all the actions of
  the night.</p>

  <p>"Madame," said Bothwell, "we went there on the instant and found him in
  the orchard beyond Thieves Row, with his page boy, under a tree&mdash;and
  both were dead. Dead and naked."</p>

  <p>The Queen came slowly down the steps, ignoring the kneeling woman on the
  steps, who was crying. She stared at Bothwell's hands as if she pictured the
  work they had been about a short time before.</p>

  <p>"It was a pity for the boy," she said. "A very willing, pleasant lad, who
  never did any harm."</p>

  <p>"And for the King, madame?" cried Lady Mar, incredulous.</p>

  <p>"That passes pity," replied the Queen. She looked at Bothwell. "What
  friend has he to speak for him? What champion to take his part?"</p>

  <p>"Madame," said Bothwell, "all is a mystery. How is one to judge anything
  in the dark and the confusion?"</p>

  <p>The Queen noticed that two of the buttons had been wrenched from his coat.
  By whose hand?</p>

  <p>She saw the faces that stared in the flickering light, Bothwell's steady
  eyes, the torn coat, his white hands. Nothing beyond this, nothing.</p>

  <p>"I'd like a drink," she said. "It is so hot."</p>

  <p>Lady Mar rose to take her under the arm and support her to her bedroom
  door.</p>

  <p>"See," remarked Bothwell to Maitland, "the courage of a great
  princess."</p>

  <p>"A paragon," said Sir William daintily, as the door closed on the Queen.
  "She bears this great disaster nobly. After their reconciliation, too, that
  was hard. So young a man! To be murdered like that&mdash;" His voice was dry
  and brittle, he remarked that the Chamber of Presence was cold and that they
  might as well get back to their beds.</p>

  <p>The Queen, in her room, took her arm from Lady Mar, passed Mary Seaton,
  and went into the little closet, closing the door behind her.</p>

  <p>There she stayed in the silence and darkness of the place where David had
  been dragged away nearly a year ago.</p>

  <p class="quote"><i>"It is too frequent with noblemen to be dishonest; piety,

  for in great Courts."</i> &mdash;<span class="smcap"><small>Democritus

  <p class="first">THE EARL OF MORAY waited in France. Outwardly he seemed
  ruined&mdash;a statesman without a government, a warrior without an army, a
  prince without a kingdom. But he was not worried. He knew that he had only to
  wait, and he did not think it was likely that he would wait long. News from
  Scotland arrived regularly from Sir William Maitland, who remained with the
  Queen.</p>

  <p>Everything had gone as he had arranged it; just as Henry Stewart had been
  used to destroy Rizzio, so Earl Bothwell had been used to destroy Henry
  Stewart, and now he in his turn must go.</p>

  <p>Bothwell's ascendancy after the removal of the King had been brilliant and
  sudden, and Moray, without a farewell to his sister, had gone to France,
  leaving the conduct of Scottish affairs to other men. He was, glad that he
  had such an able instrument as Maitland, who continued to move among these
  dangerous intrigues, and to keep close to the Queen's side. Morton, too, and
  his influence with Knox was invaluable to Moray.</p>

  <p>Moray watched how all Europe recoiled from the murder of King Henry, and
  how warnings and advice from England, France, and from her own Ambassador in
  Paris, had been sent to the Queen that she should at once search out the
  assassins and show no favour to the man who was judged the chief of
  them&mdash;Earl Bothwell. He gathered up all the gossip and tried to sift
  truth from lies.</p>

  <p>What of the Queen throughout this? Moray had sought an exact knowledge of
  her behaviour. But it was not easy, for she lived sometimes in the castle,
  sometimes in Holyrood, sometimes away in the hills, and the reports as to her
  conduct differed. Maitland, who kept close to her and whose delicate
  curiosity could probe the minds of most people, wrote in his cautious cipher
  to Moray that even he did not quite know what to say of the Queen. It was
  believed that she would marry Bothwell, yet that seemed hard to credit. All
  Europe deplored her choice.</p>

  <p>Moray, watching from afar, saw her light as a bubble on a wave riding to
  annihilation. She no longer concerned him, nor his politics, aims, and
  ideals. These now concentrated on the child, the Protestant Prince who should
  rule Scotland and perhaps England.</p>

  <p>He had all his schemes prepared. He would be Regent. Quite soon, when
  Bothwell had run his lunatic course, the Lords would send for him, and he and
  Maitland would rule Scotland, wise, justly, cautiously, not binding the
  country over-much to either France or England but building it up to
  independence.</p>

  <p>For what had passed he had no regret. He knew that the crime in Kirk o'
  Field could be turned to considerable account, first to destroy Bothwell,
  then to keep Huntly, Morton, even Maitland, in their places. The only one who
  was under no suspicion was he who had stood apart and designed it
  all&mdash;Moray himself.</p>

  <p>He had been a little astonished, used as he was to murder, that this crime
  had so resounded in Europe. King Henry had not been popular; he had been of
  no use to anyone, nor could Moray think whom there might be to miss him. Yet
  even those who had disliked him, or never seen him, or thought of him with
  complete indifference, now clamoured for vengeance on the King, only
  twenty-one years old, brutally murdered.</p>

  <p>Moray himself, in public, joined in the outcry, expressing the deepest
  horror, the greatest alarm. It had made a useful excuse for his withdrawal
  from Scotland: he declared that he held the whole country shamed until the
  murderers were discovered. In secret, he thought the thing was clumsily done
  and blamed Bothwell. It should have been sudden, all over in a flash of fire,
  the King and his servants tossed into the air and killed instantly. But the
  murderers must have been noisy, and discovered. Moray was astonished that
  Archibald Douglas at least had not managed better than that. The King had
  evidently escaped from the house and they had had to pursue him into the
  orchard, strangle him with the sleeves of his dressing-gown, stuff a
  handkerchief steeped, in vinegar into his mouth&mdash;ugly, clumsy, and
  stupid.</p>

  <p>They had been careful to murder the page boy, John Taylor; no doubt he had
  seen too much. But they had allowed other servants to escape who might, even
  in the dark and confusion, have seen more than they should have.</p>

  <p>Then, the explosion after the murder. Moray considered that a foolish
  destruction of valuable property. But perhaps it had served some purpose
  since it had inflamed the public mind against the assassins and impressed
  them with something almost supernatural about the deed, which suited Moray's
  purpose very well, but he was sorry not to have saved the Queen. Her doom was
  in herself, and nothing could rescue her. He had tried long and diligently to
  protect her; even after the murder of David he had thought that it might have
  been done, but now it was too late. It did not matter much, he thought, the
  actual degree of her guilt. It was not likely that even Bothwell had
  discussed with her the details of her husband's murder. But she had done all
  she had been asked to do&mdash;she had decoyed the poor young man from safety
  and placed him in the hands of his enemies.</p>

  <p>Moray wondered at her audacity, her remarkable courage. She dared to flout
  all Europe to favour Bothwell.</p>

  <p>But only when Moray heard that Jane Gordon was to be divorced both
  according to the Protestant and the Roman Catholic laws did he believe that
  it was the Queen's intention to marry that lawless and bloody man.</p>

  <p>When Moray heard this news he came to Paris, awaiting his recall. The
  Lords were forming themselves up against Bothwell as they had formed
  themselves against the King, and no one believed that the Queen could hold
  the throne long after her marriage with the Earl.</p>

  <p>Maitland sent reports of her behaviour. Sometimes she was in the depths of
  misery and wished that she was dead; sometimes she was ill and kept her bed
  for days together, complaining of her old malady&mdash;the pain in her side.
  Sometimes she was gay and spent hours on horseback, riding. But always she
  remained resolute in her favours to Bothwell.</p>

  <p>In April came the news of the Queen's abduction&mdash;a farce at which
  everyone laughed. Bothwell had carried her off with a few of her escort to
  Dunbar, and when she had been released she had entered Edinburgh with
  Bothwell leading her bridle.</p>

  <p>Soon after, he had commanded John Craig, Knox's substitute in the Church,
  to publish his banns with the Queen.</p>

  <p>Moray had read with pleasure of the action of John Craig. He had not
  hesitated to face the man who was the master of Scotland. Attending the Privy
  Council he accused the Earl of murdering the King, seducing the Queen, and
  illegally divorcing Jane Gordon.</p>

  <p>It had been useless&mdash;the Queen had insisted on the marriage. The
  Lords banded together in Stirling, where Mar held the prince, and fortified
  the castle. This was the last news out of Scotland.</p>

  <p>By the middle of May, Moray had heard that the Queen had married Bothwell,
  whom she had created Duke of Orkney. He sent long and minute instructions to
  Maitland and Morton and his other minions. He was expecting his recall within
  a few weeks; he had not expected events to be quite so hurried as this. How
  long was it since Henry Stewart had been murdered? Looking at his calendar,
  he was startled to find that it was only eight weeks.</p>

  <p>He knew what people said in France about the scandalous divorce, the
  abduction, the hasty marriage. Poor fool, did she not understand that her
  husband was doomed without her interference? The men whom he had betrayed
  would have accounted for him, but still she must meddle. He understood her
  threefold motive&mdash;revenge for David, lust for Bothwell, desire for the
  child to be born in wed lock. What sort of creature had she become? He knew
  what was said of her; he had plumbed the depths of the filth that tarnished
  her name. He did not defend her, but he was uneasy with her shame.</p>

  <p>"No one will come," said the Queen smiling. "We are quite alone." Softly,
  and as if she were talking to herself, she started to recite the state they
  were in. They had no money, only a few of his own men followed them. If she
  were to raise her standard she doubted if any would rally to it. Lennox was
  inflaming the country against her, even the Hamiltons held off. Everywhere
  there seemed to be distrust, suspicions, disloyalty. The people, she knew how
  they branded her, she knew what was said in the pulpits. England would help
  the Lords and France would not help her. Moray had come to Paris, he was
  waiting, she knew, to pounce. But what to do? What to do?</p>

  <p>The Queen's husband did not answer these reproaches. He had his own case
  to think of. He had dared to shoot at a high mark and he believed he had
  missed. Behind him had been Moray. There was no dealing with such crafty,
  cunning, slippery rogues as that. He had thought that the Lords who had used
  him to murder the King and who promised him the Queen's hand if he did so,
  would have stood by him. But not As soon as he had married the Queen they had
  all withdrawn, and slowly every Scot was moving towards them so that he saw
  himself, with the Queen, abandoned. And there was no money, none.</p>

  <p>Nor could he see any hope in the future. Where could he find an alliance
  or revenues or armies? What use was the Queen to him if she lost her power,
  her authority, her country?</p>

  <p>He looked at her curiously. She was no longer even beautiful, she had
  neglected herself. Had she been anyone but the Queen he would have left her
  long ago, but he accepted his misfortune without reproach. He did not intend
  to give way until he was forced to do so. He still had confidence in his own
  courage and resources: he did not know what it was to be afraid of anyone or
  to pity anyone.</p>

  <p>The Queen, seeing that he took no notice of her, rose from the steps of
  the dais. Her eyes flickered across to the empty throne where she could
  visualize Henry Stewart, sullen, but splendid, frowning down at her
  perplexity.</p>

  <p>"Since you will not listen, I must save my words," she said. "You have had
  everything of me, you know I would not have done it for my own vengeance, nor
  would I have married with you if it had not been for the child. See, I have
  set you up, and what gratitude do I get?"</p>

  <p>"Sweet madame," he replied pleasantly, "it seems that all I should owe you
  gratitude for is a broken neck. I do not think we can hold this throne, you
  and I."</p>

  <p>"You should have thought of that before."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I did think of it; perhaps it was the difficulty I liked. There
  is a challenge about attempting the impossible, and I admit to two mistakes.
  I thought the Lords would have used me better, and I did not think that there
  would be this outcry for that foolish boy."</p>

  <p>"You promised you would not speak of that to me."</p>

  <p>"Yet I do not think, madame, it much concerns you to hear the tale. You
  weep very much but your heart is not touched."</p>

  <p>"My heart," whispered the Queen. "What talk of any heart was there ever
  between you and me?"</p>

  <p>"Or between you and any man. Who had need to say more than&mdash;'Come to
  me,' and you were in his arms?"</p>

  <p>"You were glad to lie in mine. And not only because I was the Queen."</p>

  <p>They spoke to each other politely. His courtesy always overbore her
  outbursts and he never said anything about the low estate to which he had
  brought her. But she did not notice his omission. She had a carriage and
  generosity of spirit that made reproaches impossible to her for long.</p>

  <p>She began to speak of the child who had been the reason behind the
  farcical divorce, the impossible marriage. She could not conceal her
  condition much longer&mdash;where could she, married six weeks, hide to give
  birth to a full term child?</p>

  <p>"With Lady Reres at Inchmahome." He was always ready with an answer. "I
  have those whom I could trust to send with you."</p>

  <p>She was at once startled and comforted. Inchmahome! The lonely castle in
  the lonely lake, where she had been sent as a child to escape the
  English&mdash;yes, that would be a safe retreat. Lady Reres, with her bawdy
  talk would be good company, and Mary Seaton, who was almost a saint, would be
  there to make her peace with Heaven.</p>

  <p>The man, watching her, was pleased to see her smile. He was jealous about
  the child whom he wanted to see as future King of Scotland, instead of
  Moray's protégé whom he believed to be the Italian's son. He had paid Lady
  Reres very well to watch the Queen closely so that there was no chance for
  any tricks with the apothecary.</p>

  <p>As for popular talk, he grinned at that. Most people knew the truth, but
  he defied them to utter it. They took hope from their common courage, and
  laughed at each other. After all, much, perhaps everything, might yet be
  saved.</p>

  <p>"I do love you," said the Queen, encouraged by his equanimity. She came to
  his side and rested her head on his shoulder. Bothwell suffered her with good
  humour, he intended to behave with dignity during what might be left of their
  life together, and he told her that she should put a brave face upon things,
  at least in public.</p>

  <p>"I see little hope for us," he said, "but why should we give way before we
  must? There'll be many a battle yet before they have us where they wish to
  put us."</p>

  <p>"And where's that?" she asked, looking up with a half-laugh.</p>

  <p>"Madame, did you not sign a decree of death against adulterers and
  fornicators and such persons?"</p>

  <p>"I was forced to it&mdash;Maitland forced me. He said it was
  expected&mdash;the people clamoured for it."</p>

  <p>"The time was aptly chosen," remarked Bothwell good-humouredly. But he
  said he had hopes of doing something yet; with the money that came from
  things he had sold he could get together some more men&mdash;he was a good
  soldier and knew how to do well with a small force.</p>

  <p>She kissed him and went quietly to her room. He told her that he would
  come to her presently, he had much to do. But when she made inquiries she
  found that he had ridden to Castle Crichton, where he still kept Jane Gordon,
  his first wife, so the Queen remained, restless, with the unborn child for
  company.</p>

  <p>The Queen questioned Sir William Maitland curiously. She knew that both
  Bothwell and Huntly looked for a chance to murder him, so that while he
  stayed with her he was in peril of his life.</p>

  <p>She asked him with a detached wonder why he remained. "You might join the
  Lords or my brother who is abroad. I suppose you are really of their
  party?"</p>

  <p>"Of no party, madame," replied Maitland.</p>

  <p>"Well, you cannot care for me," she said quietly. "I have no friends left.
  I am quite discrowned, am I not, Sir William?"</p>

  <p>He replied softly: "I think so, madame."</p>

  <p>Without surprise or offence she gazed at him. For many days he had seemed
  sick, his face was slightly tinged with yellow. Some slow disease was
  weakening him, but he was still quietly magnificent in his attire, and, when
  amid her distractions she had spoken to him, still the splendid, witty
  companion.</p>

  <p>"You report to my brother all my doings, you are allied with these rebel
  Lords?"</p>

  <p>He bent his head without replying.</p>

  <p>"We shall come to a battle, Sir William. On which side will you
  fight?"</p>

  <p>"I would wish as long as it were possible to stay with the Queen's
  Grace."</p>

  <p>"My husband would like to destroy you, Sir William."</p>

  <p>"I have to thank Your Majesty for my life. Perhaps it was not much of a
  gift, madame, for the doctors do not give me a good report."</p>

  <p>"Oh," she cried impatiently, "how little death matters&mdash;A battle! I
  should like that!"</p>

  <p>"You would be there?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed."</p>

  <p>"What you fight for is of so little value, madame. Is Jane Gordon's
  husband worth the ruin of a kingdom?" She looked at him steadily.</p>

  <p>"You have always understood me without any words."</p>

  <p>"I love the Queen, madame," he replied quietly. "I serve the Queen."</p>

  <p>"I think you have betrayed me many times, sold me to the English and the
  rebels." But she smiled. There was between them real friendship. "The Earl of
  Moray also loved the Queen." Her smiled deepened as she added that.</p>

  <p>"You had done well to take that love, it was the most worthwhile of any
  ever offered you&mdash;that and mine. We would have made you Queen and kept
  you Queen. But you, madame, rejected that."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders. "Why, so I did, Sir William, and so it has
  come to this."</p>

  <p>"Yes, madame, and you have lost everything."</p>

  <p>"Am I come to that&mdash;nothing left, nothing at all?" He was silent. She
  accepted this answer and said:</p>

  <p>"I suppose my brother will return? He counts on that&mdash;that and the
  child?"</p>

  <p>"I think so, madame. You must foresee what will occur. Earl Bothwell has
  no friends in Scotland nor in Europe&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Save only one. I shall be faithful to him."</p>

  <p>A change came over the sensitive face of Maitland. "You will do that,
  whatever happens? You would fail with him?"</p>

  <p>"To any depth," she said.</p>

  <p>"I am so glad," said Maitland. "Yes, that pleases me. I hope you will do
  it."</p>

  <p>"Even though you loathe the man, even though he has ruined me and would
  murder you?"</p>

  <p>"What does that matter? Be faithful to this man who is not faithful to
  you, madame. That is your only chance to redeem any of it."</p>

  <p>That night Maitland left Holyrood secretly and joined the rebel Lords at
  Stirling.</p>

  <p>The desertion of this subtle, cautious man, who had been faithful in spite
  of insults and danger, was like a signal. In twenty-four hours the palace was
  almost empty, so the Queen and her husband withdrew hastily from Edinburgh
  and went to the great fortress of Borthwick, where the Queen bade her
  subjects rally to her standard against the rebels, but few or none came to
  fight in such a cause.</p>

  <p>Dressed as a cavalier she escaped by night from the castle as the Lords
  marched on it. In the attire of an Edinburgh citizeness she rode beside her
  husband at Carberry Hill, with such as could be induced to fight for her,
  behind her, and the banner on which was the Scottish Lion in his lilied
  border borne before. On the other side of the little stream that trickled
  across the summer fields was gathered the strength of Scotland. All day long
  the armies faced each other. The Queen's men did not want to fight, and
  little by little, some furtively, some openly, they went over to the Lords.
  The French Ambassador negotiated, challenges were passed, accepted, disputed,
  rejected, and at the end of the tedious, weary hours there was a
  conference.</p>

  <p>Eventually the Ambassador came to the Queen and told her that the Lords
  would be satisfied with nothing less than vengeance on the murderers of the
  late King. Then they demanded the custody of the Prince, in whom the hope of
  the future lay; and thirdly, they insisted that the Queen should leave Earl
  Bothwell (they ignored his new title of duke), and deliver him and his more
  notable followers, such as Huntly, up to justice.</p>

  <p>"M. du Croc," said the Queen, "you must see that this is fantastic. My
  husband has been cleansed of the crime of which he is accused, he has been
  selected by the Lords themselves as a suitable husband for me. And as for my
  abandoning him, I married this quarrel with him."</p>

  <p>"This is what they think. Will not Your Majesty have peace?" cried the
  Frenchman in despair.</p>

  <p>"Let these rebellious subjects of mine," said the Queen, "acknowledge
  their faults and ask my pardon, and I am ready to receive them."</p>

  <p>At this point Bothwell rode up with a little troop of horsemen. He had
  been engaged in riding round the scattered ranks and endeavouring to put some
  spirit and organization into them. In a loud voice he asked of Du Croc:</p>

  <p>"Am I the one they want?"</p>

  <p>"Sir," replied the Frenchman, coldly, "the Lords assure me they are the
  very humble subjects and servants of the Queen."</p>

  <p>"And what for me?" cried the Queen's husband. "And what for me?"</p>

  <p>Du Croc lowered his voice as he replied:</p>

  <p>"Sir, they are your implacable enemies."</p>

  <p>"There is none other like my lord on the other side," said the Queen. "If
  our men were faithful we should have the best of it, do not you think?"</p>

  <p>"Truly, I think so, madame, but your forces melt away." At that Bothwell
  said:</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, sir, think no more of me, but have pity on the Queen. For
  the honour of God, sir, see the trouble she is in."</p>

  <p>The Frenchman was surprised at these words from the man of whom he had
  heard nothing but evil. He felt a deep pity, not only for the Queen who had
  tears in her eyes as he turned to bid her farewell, but also for the man who
  sat beside her, who seemed to take this great disaster almost as a joke.</p>

  <p>Then, looking about him, he saw that the two armies were intermingling,
  and that the white standard with the body of the murdered man and the praying
  child painted upon it, was advancing slowly under the fading light. He
  said:</p>

  <p>"All goes badly with you. Make what terms you can. Sir, if you have any
  pity for the Queen, my lord Duke, you will withdraw."</p>

  <p>"I have offered," said Bothwell, "to fight any of them in single combat,
  but none will accept."</p>

  <p>"It is too late," said Du Croc, with bitterness, "for such feats of arms.
  You will soon be in their power, and then nothing can save you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Jesu!" exclaimed the Queen, "is there not some means of making an
  agreement for the safety of the Duke?"</p>

  <p>Du Croc shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I have spoken to them for the space of three hours, but they have
  resolved to show no mercy there."</p>

  <p>Then the Queen repeated in bewilderment:</p>

  <p>"But they urged this marriage on him, on me!"</p>

  <p>Du Croc smiled ironically. Poor woman, she had thought herself so clever
  with her tricks and subterfuges and lies. Had she not foreseen that trap?</p>

  <p>"I think, madame, you scarcely know with whom you deal."</p>

  <p>"With whom do I deal?"</p>

  <p>"With these rebels, and Maitland and Moray." He bowed, and moved his horse
  away, weary from that long day's work.</p>

  <p>"Moray," repeated Bothwell. "You should have allowed me to kill him. And
  his spy, Maitland."</p>

  <p>The Queen looked round and saw an increasing disorder in her army. Her men
  were parleying with the Lords' troops, and over the rough ground the banner
  with the picture of the murdered man was advancing.</p>

  <p>She sent a message imploring Sir William Maitland to come to her, but he
  would not. He sent a message to say that he was not with the Lords and
  therefore he was not able to treat for them.</p>

  <p>She turned to Bothwell. He was putting on his helmet; framed in the visor
  his face still seemed amused, as if he found some humour even in his own
  failure.</p>

  <p>"Madame," he said, "there are twenty-five or thirty who will follow me,
  and if I leave the rebels have promised to make fair terms for you. You will
  be the Queen again and they your humble servants. I can do nothing for
  you&mdash;I would have led your armies, but they have melted away. I would
  have fought for you in single combat, but no man will come forward."</p>

  <p>"You are going?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"To leave you free&mdash;to give you a chance."</p>

  <p>"But I would like to come too, let me ride with you, even if I have
  nothing in the world but these clothes I stand in."</p>

  <p>"Madame, it is impossible. I shall have to go to the Border, perhaps to
  the Islands."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, I too," she thought. The force of her love was such that she
  closed her eyes and the tears ran down her face.</p>

  <p>She felt him take her hand and kiss it. They had so little time&mdash;the
  banner with the body of the dead man upon it was being carried across the
  brook.</p>

  <p>"Farewell, Mary. Maybe we shall meet again. Be faithful to me."</p>

  <p>When she opened her eyes he had already turned his horse and was gone,
  with those thirty men closing behind him, towards Dunbar.</p>

  <p>The Queen, on a violent impulse, turned her horse's head to follow him. It
  seemed to her that with him went all that she had left in the world, but
  those beside her caught her bridle and checked her and led her towards the
  army of the Lords so that the Banner of Scotland that followed her, came side
  by side with the Banner on which was depicted the naked body of Henry Stewart
  lying strangled beneath the bare orchard trees.</p>

  <p>The Lords did not keep their promise to receive the Queen as their
  Sovereign. When she surrendered and disarmed, they made her their prisoner
  and without giving thought to her dignity or comfort turned towards
  Edinburgh. The man who had particular charge of her was Earl Morton whom she
  had always detested.</p>

  <p>She kept her courage, trusting always to the future&mdash;her people of
  Edinburgh would not allow her to be treated with ignominy. When they reached
  the capital she would be lodged in the palace and Mary Seaton and the French
  girls, perhaps Lady Argyll, would come to her; there would be rest, comfort.
  And when she had lost her fatigue and her terror she could send for Bothwell.
  Erect, smiling faintly, she rode amidst her enemies. She encouraged herself
  by thinking of Bothwell. He would be able to rescue her.</p>

  <p>When they reached Edinburgh it was nearly dark and the Queen pulled a
  muffler round her face. The Lords marched in silence, continuing to carry in
  front of her the Banner with the two figures of father and son. She was now
  close enough to read on the scroll issuing from the child's mouth the words,
  "Judge, and avenge my cause, O Lord." It was the murderers themselves who
  carried this banner. She felt contempt for all of them, but unbidden, the
  austere image of Moray came into her mind.. Was he not behind all this,
  moving warily, secretly? Had he not from the first warned her&mdash;he had
  said that he would make her a queen, but that if she left him for other men
  ...She closed her eyes; it seemed that if Moray had not been her brother she
  might have loved him and he might have saved her from all this. But as love
  was forbidden, hate had taken its place.</p>

  <p>The armed men cleared the streets of Edinburgh before her. She discovered
  that they were not taking her to Holyrood, but lodging her in the Provost's
  House. She dismounted, still too proud to complain, still indomitable, and
  Morton led her up the stairway into a room that looked on the street.</p>

  <p>"Is this for me?" she asked, peering in. The room was plainly furnished
  and she noted at once that it had no other exit than the door in which she
  stood.</p>

  <p>"What will you do with me?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"We must debate that."</p>

  <p>She faced him and struggled to recapture the brave words and gestures.</p>

  <p>"You have broken your word to me&mdash;all of you&mdash;I am not to be
  treated as a queen as you promised. But I am the Queen nevertheless, and my
  last words shall be those of a queen."</p>

  <p>He smiled at her carelessly, then closed the door. Terror for a moment
  mastered her; she beat on the panels demanding liberty, or at least a woman,
  an apothecary, a priest. Then she controlled herself.</p>

  <p>Of course she would not be left here long. Someone would rescue
  her&mdash;the Hamiltons, the Argylls, Atha, Huntly. Then she thought of
  Lennox, the English, and Moray, and her spirits sank again.</p>

  <p>There were no curtains at the windows, and forcing herself to walk slowly,
  she went to one of these and looked out. A flutter of white, vivid in the
  light of the torches burning below, met her as she pressed her face to the
  pane. It was the Banner again, the Banner of the rebellious Lords. She drew
  back from the window, and went to the door, turning the handle, uselessly,
  for it was bolted outside. She heard the ring of iron on iron which told her
  there were armed men on guard.</p>

  <p>There was no mirror in the room, but she knew that her face was dirty,
  that her hair was in a tangle. She stared with disgust at her hands,
  blistered on the palms from the hard gauntlets and holding the reins so
  long.</p>

  <p>There was a noise in the street and she went to the window again and
  looked out&mdash;the other window this time, not that before which they had
  hung the banner. The light from torches and lanterns filled the street, which
  was crowded with people. She could see clearly the upturned faces. What were
  they saying? She could not always understand the Scots tongue, but the
  meaning of the cry was clear enough:</p>

  <p>"Kill! Kill! Burn! Burn! Slay the adulteress and murderess!"</p>

  <p>The Queen was not afraid. She wanted to open the window, to call out to
  them, to justify herself, to say that she had no ill will to any of them,
  that she felt kindly towards Scotland, her ancient realm.</p>

  <p>She fumbled with the bolt, but her weary fingers could not move it. She
  began to walk round the room. It was curious to be confined. She opened the
  chest in the corner and found it held the winter store of woollen hangings.
  She had no means of defence, no place to lie, no water; she beat on the door,
  asking for a drink of water. If only she could have Mary Seaton, the
  apothecary, or a priest. She went to the window again. A man was moving
  through the crowd which made way for him with respect. He looked up at her
  and she saw the worn face of Sir William Maitland. This time in her
  passionate flare of hope she found the force to burst the hasp of the
  casement open, and leaning out, she cried to Sir William to come up and speak
  to her, regardless of the hooting of the mob that went up at sight of her and
  the way they surged towards the door of the Provost's House.</p>

  <p>But he turned away, pulling his hat over his face, and passed through the
  crowd.</p>

  <p>Then the Queen drew back from the window and fell on her knees, her body
  pressed against the wall. If only she could have got to Inchmahome with Lady
  Reres and the French girls&mdash;if only she could be hidden somewhere till
  the child was born. She thought of Claude, the girl whom they had hanged for
  murdering her baby. How women suffered ...where could she find help, where?
  Pain lapped at her like rising water. Her senses blurred and she sank forward
  into unconsciousness.</p>

  <p>When she came round she did not know if she had fainted or slept. It was
  dawn and light was growing in the half-furnished room.</p>

  <p>No one had been near her, her lips were parched for lack of water, her
  hands dirty, her dress torn. She began to understand what was intended for
  her&mdash;the presence of Moray, implacable, monstrous, seemed to fill the
  room. She herself had signed the decree that gave death to the adulteress.
  Frenzy shook her&mdash;the stake, the axe, the rope.</p>

  <p>She opened the window, the crowd was still below. She began to plead for
  pity, begging them to have mercy on her, to save her.</p>

  <p>The door suddenly opened and she turned with such a vehement movement that
  she fell on to her knees.</p>

  <p>It was Maitland who stood before her, and she remained on her knees
  staring at him and crying for pity. He made no attempt to comfort her and she
  began to threaten him as she had threatened Ruthven when David was
  killed.</p>

  <p>"If you assist these rebels now, I shall know how to punish you.
  Ungrateful! Did I not save you from Huntly, and from my husband? I would I
  had let them slay you at my feet. You allow that flag to hang before my
  window, you allow them to keep me in this place, but you knew of it, you were
  an accessory to this murder of which there is such a clamour&mdash;you and
  Moray."</p>

  <p>"But it is not I nor he whom it will destroy," replied Sir William.</p>

  <p>"Let me go to my husband, only that! Where is he? At Dunbar?"</p>

  <p>"Earl Bothwell has gone, perhaps to take farewell of his wife. He is a
  wise man and knows when he is defeated."</p>

  <p>"Farewell of his wife!" she repeated.</p>

  <p>"Is it not known to all that the Earl still thinks himself married to Jane
  Gordon and holds the Queen's Grace only as his concubine?"</p>

  <p>The Queen did not answer that. The noise in the street increased as armed
  men tried to push their way through the crowd to drive the people back to
  their homes.</p>

  <p>"Where is my brother?"</p>

  <p>"Madame, he has been sent for."</p>

  <p>She began to weep again and said it was cruel to separate her from her
  husband, with whom she expected much happiness. She repeated passionately
  that she was married, and it might be that she would have another child,
  which would be dishonoured by this separation.</p>

  <p>"Married six weeks!" said Maitland.</p>

  <p>She then asked him why he had come to visit her since he had no comfort to
  give, and said that the sight of him offended her.</p>

  <p>He said:</p>

  <p>"Madame, if you could forsake Lord Bothwell there might be some pity for
  you."</p>

  <p>"You told me, you yourself, that my one merit was in my fidelity to
  him."</p>

  <p>"So I think."</p>

  <p>"I love him and I shall be faithful to him."</p>

  <p>"If you only did, if you only could! But if that were in you, you were not
  in this plight now."</p>

  <p>"Yet to forsake him is my only hope of mercy?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, madame, and therefore all the glorious action that is left you would
  be to cleave to him."</p>

  <p>She said to him, crying:</p>

  <p>"What do you know of glorious actions? You are a liar, a traitor. I wish I
  had allowed my husband to kill you. You are a very mean creature."</p>

  <p>"Madame, I know it."</p>

  <p>Her thoughts turned swiftly to her own desperate need. "What can you do
  for me?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know, madame, everything is in the hands of. Lord Moray. I shall
  try to protect you till he comes."</p>

  <p>"How coldly you speak! What do the people want?"</p>

  <p>"Revenge for the death of the young man." Maitland added delicately: "Do
  you never weep for that?"</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"There were so many young men who died bloodily. If I had begun to weep
  for them&mdash;! Save me! I never harmed you. And Moray would not wish me
  hurt."</p>

  <p>"No, he would not wish that."</p>

  <p>"Nor shamed." She seated herself on the edge of the bare bed. "You'll
  think me shamed enough. But&mdash;worse might happen." She forced herself to
  go on. "I need secrecy, rest, my women, my apothecary, do you understand? I
  was going to Inchmahome&mdash;but that is over. I am ready to die&mdash;but
  not that."</p>

  <p>"I understand," said Sir William quietly. "I will do what I can."</p>

  <p>With no more than that he left her.</p>

  <p>In the Privy Council chamber in Holyrood House, Morton and the Lords
  debated what was to be done with the Queen. They were in half a mind to let
  the people have their way with her, to avenge the murder of the King. Then
  the country would be in peace and they could crown the young King. But Sir
  William Maitland said that it was Moray's wish that she should be saved. He
  was coming back and would himself decide her destiny. No one disputed Moray's
  will for in all their minds he was master.</p>

  <p>That night, obeying the commands that Moray had long since sent to
  Maitland in readiness for such an emergency, they took the Queen with Mary
  Seaton and two other gentlewomen, secretly, and heavily guarded, to a castle
  that belonged to Lord Moray's mother, Margaret Douglas, called Lochleven.</p>

  <p>In the tower of the castle the Queen lay for fifteen days desperately ill,
  only rousing now and then to drink a little water or, a glass of wine.</p>

  <p>She was housed pleasantly and most of her household had been allowed to
  attend her; she wanted for nothing. These had been Earl Moray's
  commands&mdash;that she should want for nothing.</p>

  <p>One night when the Queen had been at Lochleven for about three weeks, Lady
  Douglas, walking on the ramparts in the twilight, heard a French song coming
  from the tower where the prisoner was confined. It faded away into shrieks
  which were quickly muffled.</p>

  <p>She moved away and shut herself in her own apartment, not being willing to
  see or hear more, but from her window that night she saw a figure which she
  knew to be that of the Queen's apothecary trying to keep as close as possible
  to the shadow of the wall. Lady Douglas thought he had a bundle under his
  cloak.</p>

  <p>John Knox returned to Edinburgh and after much conferring with Mr. Craig,
  the minister who had taken his place and who had refused, until he was
  forced, to obey the Queen's express command to publish the banns of her
  marriage with the Earl Bothwell, they published a Proclamation.</p>

  <p>"We take no pleasure," said their Proclamation, "to deal with our
  Sovereign after this source as we are presently forced to do. We never were
  about in any wise to restrain her liberty, yet how horribly the King, Her
  Majesty's husband, was murdered, is a common fable throughout Christendom.
  How shamefully the Queen our Sovereign was led by fear, force, and other
  extraordinary and more unlawful means, even to become bedfellow to another
  wife's husband, to him who not three months before had in his bed most
  cruelly murdered her husband, is manifest to the world and to the great
  dishonour of Her Majesty, of us all, and this whole nation.</p>

  <p>"What end think you could we have looked for the Earl of Bothwell in the
  progress of time, or in what bounds could his immoderate ambition have been
  concluded? What rested to finish the work begun, to accomplish the whole
  desire of his ambitious heart but to send the son after the father and it
  might be suspected, seeing him keep another wife in store, to make the Queen
  also drink of the same cup that in the end he might have possessed himself of
  the Crown of the Realm, which behoves to be the mark he shot at, so that
  though by wicked means this purchase must seem by the light of men's
  favour."</p>

  <p>Towards the end of the month, Lord Lindsay and Sir Robert Melville went to
  Lochleven to obtain the Abdication of the Queen. This was Moray's wish. She
  was to be completely overthrown, yet he would have no violence or force, and
  he commanded his wife, Agnes Keith, to go and attend on the Queen until his
  return.</p>

  <p>The Queen lay in her bed, too weak to do more than raise herself on her
  elbow, which gave her a glimpse through the window of the grey waters of the
  lake, but she was relieved of her burden of shame and terror. She had not
  been able to save the child, but she had saved herself.</p>

  <p>She tried to efface from her memory that awful night and the wretched
  creature that had never drawn breath as he lay ready to be buried. It had
  looked to her like Florestan, and she had cried out against their cruelty for
  murdering her son. She had meant to save the child, and have it secretly sent
  to France. But it had been born dead before its time; she believed that it
  had died within her while she was in the Provost House.</p>

  <p>She had wept for the baby and begged them not to take it away. But as her
  strength returned she was glad to think that she had escaped the worse shame.
  She made no secret of her illness. The cruelty with which she had been
  treated had caused a miscarriage, she had lost her child, everyone ought to
  pity her distress.</p>

  <p>While the Queen was still confined to bed a message was brought to her
  that she must instantly receive Lord Lindsay and young Lord Ruthven. She was
  told that they had come to receive her Abdication. She must sign three
  documents: One contained her consent to the government of her son and the
  total relinquishing of her own rights in Scotland. In the second she gave the
  Regency to the Earl of Moray, and the third named other Lords for this
  position in case Moray should refuse the dignity.</p>

  <p>The Queen whispered from the bed: "What will they do if I will not
  sign?"</p>

  <p>Agnes Keith slipped into her hand a letter in a cipher that was familiar
  to her&mdash;it was Sir William Maitland's.</p>

  <p>Propping herself upon her elbow she read it&mdash;a plea to her to do as
  the Lord asked in every respect. All her chances in the kingdom were totally
  lost and there was nothing she could save but her life, and that only by
  complete submission, while afterwards she could repudiate her Abdication as
  wrested from her by force.</p>

  <p>The Queen put the letter down, puzzling over Maitland&mdash;was he friend
  or enemy? It hardly mattered, the advice was good and she thought that she
  saw Moray behind it&mdash;Moray, who did not wish her to be utterly
  destroyed.</p>

  <p>If she would not sign the document they had, Lindsay told her bluntly,
  several expedients to destroy her. Had it not been for Moray's device to send
  her to this water-ringed fortress, the people of Scotland would have
  destroyed her before. John Knox daily preached that a plague rested on the
  country while she lived, that the blood of Henry Stewart cried aloud for
  vengeance, and brought a curse on those who hesitated to kill his
  murderers.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that!" said the Queen. "Have we not had many such murders in
  Scotland?"</p>

  <p>"There is none," replied Lindsay, "that has so shaken the mind of the
  people."</p>

  <p>He continued to speak against her, holding the papers through the
  bed-curtains, but she did not listen, for his voice was offensive to her. She
  peered over his shoulder at the young face of Ruthven. Mary Seaton had told
  her that this Lord was sorry for her, and had taken some of her messages to
  the English and the French envoys, and for that had been removed from among
  her guards. She closed her eyes. They took her silence for an obstinate
  refusal, and Melville, who had smuggled in the warning from Sir William
  Maitland, was distressed at her stubbornness&mdash;he feared for her life.
  Who was there in Scotland who would blame these men if they killed her?</p>

  <p>"You are rebels and traitors and cowards!" whispered the Queen, weakly,
  "and I will not give up the estate to which God called me. As for the murder
  of my husband&mdash;" She opened her eyes and looked up at them, still prone
  on the pillows, too weak to move: "I am innocent," she said.</p>

  <p>Lindsay glanced at Ruthven and said sourly:</p>

  <p>"Madame, when Earl Bothwell fled from Holyrood he left certain letters
  behind. They are in the possession of Earl Morton. You wrote them when you
  were at Glasgow with the King, the man who took them to Earl Bothwell was
  Nicolas Hubert."</p>

  <p>The Queen was silent. Then she said: "The letters are forgeries."</p>

  <p>"You would have to prove that," said Lindsay, "and once they were
  published, I think it would matter very little whether you wrote them or
  no."</p>

  <p>Melville impatiently lifted the curtain higher and stared down at her:</p>

  <p>"Sign, madame, for God's sake."</p>

  <p>She called Mary Seaton to raise her up in bed. They put the papers on her
  knees and brought her an inkhorn and quill. She had never meant to do this,
  it had been her intention to die splendidly. If only they had let her go with
  Bothwell, to ride north beside him and take ship with him away from all of
  them. But she had not had that choice.</p>

  <p>She signed her name three times. Then, while Lindsay took the documents,
  she lay down, gently assisted by Mary Seaton and hid her face in the pillows,
  without hope, almost without life.</p>

  <p>"Madame," whispered Mary Seaton, "Lord Moray is coming to Lochleven!"</p>

  <p>These words came joyfully to the Queen, who since she had signed the Act
  of Abdication, had lain listlessly in bed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mary!" Blood faintly tinged her face. "This is an answer to prayer,
  this is God's protection of the innocent."</p>

  <p>"Why, madame, do you think my lord will do anything for you?"</p>

  <p>"He has come!" said the Queen. "He cannot keep away, you see! He has
  everything, now, Mary, everything that was mine&mdash;the kingdom, the child,
  the affection of my subjects, my armed men, my forts and ships, all, all this
  and he has no need to think of me any more, but he has come, he has come,
  Mary!" She added, "What have we here for clothes and attire and jewels?"</p>

  <p>"Very little, madame. There was one chest sent, but it has nothing but
  plain mourning robes and veils."</p>

  <p>"That will not do," said the Queen impatiently. "Am I allowed to send
  letters?"</p>

  <p>"I believe so, madame, if Sir William Douglas sees them first."</p>

  <p>"Well, he shall take no exception to this, it is not a conspiracy. Write
  to Sir Robert Melville."</p>

  <p>Mary Seaton ventured to murmur: "He is no longer your Lord Chamberlain,
  madame, and would scarcely do your bidding."</p>

  <p>"No matter for that. Tell him to go to Servais de Condé. Even if he is
  not," she added, smiling, "still the Keeper of my Wardrobe, yet he must know
  where my clothes are. I will have a white satin gown and one of a carnation
  colour and one of black. And while you write have some silk and taffeta and
  satin for our embroideries, and twists of silk thread. And some clothes for
  yourselves, I marvel he has not sent before, you are ragged, Mary."</p>

  <p>By Earl Moray's wish the Queen's properties and fineries were sent from
  Holyrood to Lochleven. He was insistent that these should be in her
  possession before his arrival at the island fortress, for he did not wish to
  see her humiliated. He thought that he could scarcely have endured to see her
  as she must have appeared after Carberry Hill, and he hated those who had
  seen her half naked, with streaming hair and disfigured face, screaming from
  the window of the Provost's House. All that should have been spared. He
  blamed and hated Morton for it, and himself for staying away too long.</p>

  <p>He arrived at Lochleven with Lord Atholl and Earl Morton, and all three
  were admitted immediately into the presence of the Queen. She ignored the
  others coming straight to him to take his hand, and he allowed her to lead
  him apart. And then he looked at her, first at the hand held in his, then at
  her ruffled sleeve of white satin and then up to her face. She was not in
  mourning (he thought she should have been), but she wore a robe that he
  remembered from Holyrood and was again in possession of her smooth
  beauty.</p>

  <p>"Madame," he said, "I have nothing to say that the others may not hear,"
  and he turned to include them in the conversation. The Queen said: "You are
  master of us all." And ignoring the other two, she asked him what he intended
  to do with her? Earl Moray answered her covertly, evading a plain issue. He
  was wondering if she hated him, he was recalling how she hunted him from the
  kingdom, forbidding anyone to give him even a bowl of porridge.</p>

  <p>The Queen began to weep, softly, into her gold-edged handkerchief, and he
  turned aside to the other two who stared at her with grim hostility. Morton,
  at least, was determined to have her life. Moray resented that look of
  contempt on the Red Earl's face, and he ordered his sister to have her supper
  apart, not wishing to expose her to the gibes of Morton.</p>

  <p>After supper he went into her apartment again. When he entered she looked
  up and said:</p>

  <p>"You've had all of me&mdash;I am at your mercy."</p>

  <p>Walking up and down the room, he began to reproach her with her
  misconduct. The Queen wept bitterly. And at last, seeing the uselessness of
  this criticism he paused before her and asked her what she hoped from
  him.</p>

  <p>She demanded her liberty, her realm, and her son.</p>

  <p>At which he exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"Is it possible that you do not realize even now the trouble you are in?
  That your life hangs on a thread, and that only my return to Scotland and the
  instances of Queen Elizabeth's Ambassador have saved you?"</p>

  <p>She began to flatter him, calling him powerful, merciful. She reminded him
  that it was in his power not only to save her but to put her where she had
  been before.</p>

  <p>But he denied this, saying:</p>

  <p>"Even your liberty is not in my power, Fix your hopes in God's mercy for
  there, surely, is your safest refuge." Then sighed, and added:</p>

  <p>"I will assure you of your life and as much as lies in me of the
  preservation of your honour, but as for your liberty, it is not, I say, in my
  power. Nor is it good for you to seek it nor to have it for many
  reasons."</p>

  <p>"I hope," said the Queen quietly, "you will not refuse the Regency, but
  accept it as my desire."</p>

  <p>"You wish that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Why, surely," said she, in a broken voice, "for if you are Regent my son
  shall be preserved, my realm well-governed, and I in safety and able to enjoy
  more liberty than I should have any other way. And I hope," said she with a
  sigh, "you will get all the forces of the realm into your hands for I know
  there is none I can trust but you."</p>

  <p>He did not answer this and she began to plead with him. Might she not have
  her son?</p>

  <p>"Ah, madame," said he, stung by what seemed her incredible lightness, "do
  you not realize that you are balladed up and down this country? God forbid
  that I should shame my mouth and your ears by repeating the words they say of
  you."</p>

  <p>"I have been most foully slandered. Never has a princess been so
  outraged."</p>

  <p>"You are not on trial, nor I your judge." He looked at her inquisitively:
  "Do you never think of the late King?"</p>

  <p>"Why do you ask me that?" asked the Queen, unmoved. "Do you think to
  convict me of cruelty?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, madame, you harden your heart. You have learnt this attitude from
  Earl Bothwell. I suppose you would be with him now&mdash;an outlaw on the
  high seas."</p>

  <p>Her face became pinched with longing.</p>

  <p>"I would indeed follow him to the ends of the earth."</p>

  <p>"Well, madame, this inordinate affection will be your ruin. Listen. I have
  given you, madame, assurance for your life, and I intend to spend my own to
  save you, employing all my power to that purpose. It does not rest with me
  only. I think a while ago I warned you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh," said she, plaintively, "this talk is nothing but a recital of my
  faults."</p>

  <p>"I must tell you, madame, why you are in jeopardy. Your existence disturbs
  the quiet of the realm, and the reign of your son; your possible attempts to
  escape from where you are, your appeals to the Queen of England or the French
  King to molest this realm inflame the people, your passion for the Earl
  Bothwell disgusts all."</p>

  <p>"Well," said the Queen, meekly, sinking back into her chair so that the
  candlelight did not reach her face, "what may I do to amend these
  faults?"</p>

  <p>Moray looked away, resisting that magic she had for him and which he now
  believed to be wholly evil. Moray knew of the birth of the child in
  Lochleven, as he knew of everything that happened to the Queen. Maitland had
  told him that only her imprisonment had saved her from the people who would
  have burnt her as a witch, and adulteress.</p>

  <p>To test her he asked:</p>

  <p>"Would you, to regain your Crown, forsake your husband, as you call
  Bothwell?"</p>

  <p>The Queen was silent. She thought with regret of the man, but her sense of
  loss grew less every day. Besides, he was so far away, he had not sent to
  her&mdash;how could she be faithful to a mere memory?</p>

  <p>She lifted her shoulder without replying. Moray was answered. She knew
  nothing of love nor fidelity. Maitland had said, "A goddess or a slut? Upon
  my word, I don't know."</p>

  <p>"Nor I," thought Moray. She was in his power, though he had disclaimed
  that, he could do with her exactly as he pleased, there was no one in
  Scotland would dare to withstand him. There were so many secret ways by which
  he might come to his desire.</p>

  <p>He stared at her, so lovely, so corrupt, waiting his pleasure, waiting his
  permission to be gay and kind. How happy he could make her. Yet, without a
  doubt she hated him, the only man who had ever mastered her&mdash;to quiet
  his own thoughts he began to admonish her; he spoke like a priest, like a
  ghostly confessor:</p>

  <p>"To preserve yourself, you must acknowledge your sins before God. You must
  make it appear that you detest your former life and intend a more modest
  behaviour. Ay, madame, and make at least an apparent show that you abhor the
  murder of your husband and mislike your former life with Earl Bothwell. And
  last, you must make it clear to all that you intend no revenge on the Lords
  who have sought your reformation and preservation."</p>

  <p>The Queen showed no resentment at these grim reprimands. She sighed
  faintly and stirred a little in the shadows of the great chair as he
  approached her. His virtue was forgotten&mdash;there was no woman like her.
  As he bent over her she opened her eyes, and said very gently:</p>

  <p>"I thank you for all your care of me here, for the kindness you had in
  sending me your lady mother and your lady wife to hold me company, for the
  clothes, and all you allowed me to have."</p>

  <p>"I have done what I could for you."</p>

  <p>She caught him by the arm as he stood by the side of her chair.</p>

  <p>"Sweet James, could you not set me up again? You and I could rule
  together. I would give everything into your hands, you know you offered this
  once. Set me free and I shall not offend you again. James, I love you, my
  brother, my protector. There shall never be another man&mdash;I have done
  with lovers."</p>

  <p>She spoke humbly, her eyes were pleading. When she thought he hesitated,
  half-seduced, she put more passion into her entreaties and drew closer to
  him, finally throwing herself against his breast, sobbing, imploring.</p>

  <p>"We are of the same family, we ought to understand, to help one another. I
  have been so unfortunate."</p>

  <p>If he left her now he would lose her for ever, he would never see her
  again. She would wither slowly in an unvisited prison.</p>

  <p>Alarmed at his silence, at his frowns (for he was her only hope), she put
  her arms round his neck and tried to draw his face down towards hers, as she
  pleaded for pardon, for mercy.</p>

  <p>Moray shuddered as he untwisted her fingers from behind his neck.</p>

  <p>"Don't go! Don't go!"</p>

  <p>But he put her away from him and said:</p>

  <p>"Madame, I can answer for your life&mdash;for the rest, I commend you to
  God."</p>

  <p>He set her back in her chair and turned towards the door, a man walking
  away from temptation. As he fumbled with the door handle, not yet in command
  of himself, he heard her speak again out of the shadow behind him. It was as
  if another woman was in the room, so altered was the ironic voice that
  said:</p>

  <p>"Farewell, my bastard brother."</p>

  <p>With the departure of the Earl Moray from her prison, the Queen's last
  hope was gone. She fell again into the apathy from which her attendants could
  not arouse her, not even Mary Seaton.</p>

  <p>She was allowed her books, her music, and her embroidery, but she took no
  more pleasure in any of them, or in the fine clothes from Holyrood. Without
  delight the future hung before her, tedious, melancholy. She was to have her
  life, perhaps some dignity and respect, but she was to be a prisoner in this
  fortress forever round which the grey water flowed.</p>

  <p>Would it not be preferable to die?</p>

  <p>She was so young, there might be years of this. She had no chance even to
  write a letter, she was kept without news. Even if her friends intrigued or
  fought for her she would never hear of it. They had crowned her son in her
  stead&mdash;yes, she would prefer to die.</p>

  <p>"I have been trying to get you some roses," said Mary Seaton, worn with
  tears and prayers, still full of devotion for her mistress. "I thought if you
  could see a few roses&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There are none here. It is too far north, too late in the year."</p>

  <p>"Yes there are one or two little bushes with blooms. When I was out
  yesterday I wanted to pluck them for you, but Lady Douglas was
  watching&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Roses at Lochleven!"</p>

  <p>"If you would only go out, even on the ramparts, you would see them."</p>

  <p>The Queen shook her head on the pillow.</p>

  <p>"Look at least from the window," pleaded Mary Seaton. "Look on the water
  and the sky. Rise up from your bed, madame, and breathe the fresher air."</p>

  <p>The Queen, wearied by this nagging, got up, and leaning on Mary Seaton's
  arm, went to the window which looked upon a little enclosed grass, then on to
  the outer ramparts and beyond that the lake.</p>

  <p>The Queen looked down into the garden where a few poor red roses bloomed
  on long stems.</p>

  <p>A tall young man was walking pensively up and down the narrow path.</p>

  <p>"Who is he? I do not seem to have noticed him before."</p>

  <p>"That is George Douglas, madame, Sir William's brother. He has been kept
  away from us."</p>

  <p>"Moray's half-brother," said the Queen curiously. "Perhaps he will gather
  some roses, Mary."</p>

  <p>At the sound of her voice, the young man in the garden glanced up eagerly.
  The Queen stared from the window of her prison, then moved into the room.</p>

  <p>"I will, after all, walk by the lake. The gown with the ruffled
  sleeves&mdash;that I wore for Lord Moray."</p>

  <p>He had looked at her as if he were already deeply in love, Moray's
  half-brother, George Douglas.</p>

  <p>The Queen laughed.</p>

  <h3>THE END</h3><br>

  <h2><a id="note"
     name="note">AUTHOR'S NOTE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The foregoing novel contains what the author believes to be
  the essence of the truth of the reign and character of Mary, Queen of
  Scotland. It is, however, to be read as a work of fiction, since it is an
  imaginary reconstruction of events and characters which must always remain
  perplexing, debated, and obscure. There is no invented person in the tale,
  and the sequence of historical events is strictly followed.</p>

  <p class="first">When the author first decided on this subject for a work of
  fiction, she found the familiar story she had selected so mysterious,
  confused, and incredible, related so often with such passion and prejudice,
  and so disfigured by spite, sentimentality, and political bias, that she
  resolved to turn to all the original documents concerning the Queen of
  Scotland and discover for herself, if possible, the facts on which so much
  fiction has been based, and to make her own deductions therefrom. Whatever,
  therefore, this tale may be, it is not a superficial fantasy but the result
  of an earnest attempt to come at the solution of a very curious historical
  puzzle.</p>
