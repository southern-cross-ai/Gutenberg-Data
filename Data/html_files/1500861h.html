  <h3>First published in <i>Harper's Magazine</i>, April 1936</h3>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="intro">THIS is the first of three installments which will
  present&mdash;in abridged form&mdash;what purports to be a summary and
  critique of the life-work of one William Burroughs Steele. Steele (according
  to the opening chapter of Mr. Wells's manuscript) was an American business
  man who retired after the War to a villa near Bandol, devoted himself to a
  comprehensive study of mankind and its aspirations and follies, and produced
  a huge treatise called <i>The Anatomy of Frustration.</i> When the
  supposititious Steele died&mdash;of heart-failure induced by an overdose of
  aspirin, which may have been suicidal in intent or accidental&mdash;he had
  published ten volumes and several further volumes were in various stages of
  preparation. This mammoth treatise had been begun by Steele, it appears, as a
  sort of modern counterpart of Burton's <i>The Anatomy of Melancholy.</i> But
  Steele was not convinced, as was Burton, that the world's madness was
  hopeless. Rather he was convinced that it was trying desperately to be sane;
  and he set himself to diagnose the malady which brings mankind to
  frustration, and to show how this malady must be attacked. Mr. Wells explains
  that he himself has decided to publish an account of Steele's little-known
  treatise "in general terms and for the general public." Then he plunges into
  the account.&mdash;The <i>Editors.</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">WILLIAM BURROUGHS STEELE, in his ambition to create a
  companion piece to <i>The Anatomy of Melancholy,</i> went so far in his
  imitation as to sketch out a schedule of frustrations closely similar to
  Burton's classification of the varieties and remedies of madness and
  melancholia. He was never altogether satisfied with these schedules he
  <i>made;</i> he was altering, adding to, rearranging them to the end of his
  life. There are several folders full of these revisions and there exists a
  copy of his first volume, black with corrections and plump with inserted
  pages, from which ultimately we may be able to reprint this, the opening,
  most labored, and least satisfactory of all his volumes. He was dissatisfied
  even with its title, <i>Frustration through Confusions in Thought,</i> but he
  never changed it.</p>

  <p>"Before we can deal with frustrations," he begins boldly in his Chapter I,
  "we must ask what it is that is frustrated. What is the end at which life
  thrusts? What is this Will in things that is always striving and never
  getting there?</p>

  <p>"What is wanted? What do we want?</p>

  <p>"As individuals? As communities? As a species?"</p>

  <p>This is a brave opening of the inquiry, it subpoenas practically all
  religious and philosophical statements of the nature of being, and puts
  Steele in the role of a sort of one-man Royal Commission of inquiry into the
  significance of the universe, as it has been understood and stated hitherto.
  His examination of his witnesses is encyclopaedic. They profess to tell us
  "Why" and "What for." Let us, he says, get all the precision we can. He takes
  creed after creed, religious cults one after another, barbaric usages and
  maxims, systems of philosophy from Heraclitus and Lucretius to Nietzsche and
  Schopenhauer&mdash;the mention of these names as cardinal is his
  own&mdash;and of each he makes the same hard and elementary inquiries.</p>

  <p>First: <i>What is assumed?</i> What does this start from? For instance, he
  points out that among other assumptions of Islam, God the Father-Creator is
  assumed, defined to a certain extent and, for the rest, indicated.</p>

  <p>This preliminary inquiry into assumptions is very characteristic of
  Steele's method. It has the simplicity of a very original intelligence. Upon
  what implicit beliefs was the mind floating, he asks, before it began to
  state this or that positively? His courage and industry in assembling this
  collection of "points of departure" and in attempting a digest of it must
  have been enormous. He tried, not very successfully, to train several
  assistants to help him. But the clear sharp slash of his mind was part of
  himself and he could convey it only very partially to others. He slashed
  anatomically; the other fellows hacked. His analysis is at once so good and
  so unsatisfactory that it sets the sympathetic reader agog to organize a
  means of doing it over again better.</p>

  <p>His firm belief that men have no right to a thousand contrasted faiths and
  creeds and that the multitudinousness of people in these matters is merely
  due to bad education, mental and moral indolence, slovenliness of statement,
  and the failure to clinch issues, is in itself an inspiration. He has no
  tolerance for loose-mindedness. Men have brains that are closely similar, he
  argues, they are moved in a similar way to these fundamental questionings,
  their inhibitions are of similar kinds; it is just laziness and untidiness,
  "mooning and wambling," that makes an "account rendered" of what people
  believe so like a museum after a riot. "They abstract to different degrees,
  they use differently conceived sets of symbols, they start in at different
  points, they fog and fumble here or there, but that is no excuse for never
  tidying up the mess." And this amazing man really started attempting to tidy
  up the mess of fundamental thought throughout the ages! And there are times
  ever and again and here and there when he really seems to smite lanes of
  lucidity through that jungle.</p>

  <p>He makes a classification of religions and philosophies according to what
  he calls their "depth of assumption." The simple savage sets his gods and
  spirits on an unquestioned land and sea and sky. He assumes also a system of
  purposes and motives like his own. That, says Steele, is "assumption at the
  surface of life." At a slightly profounder level someone makes the daring
  assumption that these things also have not been here always, sky, land, and
  all the rest of it, man and his motives; dogmatizes that they had a
  beginning, and so invents a Creator. The Creator begins by being an Old Man
  like Father and expands very slowly toward abstraction. Presently the
  assumption, the plausible, rash and fatal assumption, is made that things
  present a dual system, spirit and matter; and presently, pursuant to that
  assumption, the Creator is disembodied. He becomes the Great Spirit and soon
  He is no more to be put back into any sort of body than the fisherman's djinn
  could be packed back into his jar. One must resort to the hocus-pocus of an
  incarnation to do that, and from that assumed embodiment He is always
  breaking out again. A divine mind and will which are consecutive in time in
  their action presently follow the divine body to the limbo of lost things. So
  assumptions go deeper and deeper below superficialities and become more and
  more abstract.</p>

  <p>Steele's exploration of all these superimposed systems of apprehension,
  summarized with a certain pithy precision and compared relentlessly, is like
  a man with a small, very bright electric torch exploring vast caverns beneath
  the foundations of the many edifices of Belief on which our race lives. They
  are not separate excavations, he insists. They connect, do these sustaining
  vaults, like the catacombs of Paris. The deeper one goes, the plainer it is
  that they all rest on elementary psychological necessities or upon natural
  fallacies closely associated with and arising out of these necessities.
  Differences of creed are seen to be differences of phraseology and mental
  idiom. The more penetrating their psychological analysis, the less men will
  trouble whether it is "Jehovah, Jove, or Lord" or Creative Necessity or
  simply Necessity that encloses and carries them on.</p>

  <p>What is the end to which life drives? What is the purpose of being? We do
  not know, probably we can never know fully and comprehensively. But the thing
  of real practical moment is this: that while <i>on the whole</i> we don't
  know, yet, nevertheless, to a certain limited extent we <i>do.</i> The
  exciting, the exalting, idea in our minds is that there are very considerable
  possibilities of knowing better and more precisely, and of bringing together
  into more effective co-operation a great multitude of aims in life that are
  at present, merely through lack of lucidity, divergent and conflicting.</p>

  <p>Here Steele develops his essential thesis, and most of the rest of this
  big volume, <i>Frustration through Confusion in Thought, is</i> a copious and
  searching attack upon the needless personifications, dramatizations,
  <i>false</i> classifications, tautologies, and mixed metaphors that at
  present, he holds, waste an enormous proportion of our mental energy. Much
  more agreement is possible among men upon this question of ends than is
  generally supposed.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">Abruptly in the middle sections of this first volume, Steele
  passes from his wide survey of religions and philosophies into an heroic
  attempt to cover them by a common statement.</p>

  <p>Let me try to summarize here, as compactly and clearly as possible, the
  way in which he sets about this task. All living substance, he presumes, is
  aggressive. In that it differs from the inorganic. It has within itself an
  urge to live more, to increase, extend, prolong itself. Even when it rejects,
  avoids, escapes, it runs away only that it may fight again another day. And
  as consciousness appears in the ascendant scale of life, it "appears
  associated with a process of inhibition and of the organization of impulse,
  which conduces to the prolongation and extension of the individual."</p>

  <p>Steele is very insistent upon this idea that originally and generally
  speaking, consciousness is preoccupied with individual self-preservation.
  Only in the case of many birds and mammals and a few reptiles and fishes does
  any conscious solicitude and devotion to offspring or species appear. To
  provide for the continuation of the species through mechanism or by affording
  passionate sensuous gratification was Nature's easier path, and generally she
  took it. Passionate intellectual gratification was a harder thing to build
  into the primitive self-seeking organism. So the lustful individual is
  unconscious that he serves the species in his gratification. The normal
  individual animal is conscious of the urge to live only so far as that
  concerns its own self.</p>

  <p>Now this was all very well, it worked throughout the evolution of animal
  forms upon this planet until the mental structure developed so much
  intelligence and foresight as to look beyond to-morrow. Then trouble began.
  This, Steele thinks, has occurred only in the case of the human brain. And it
  has been only very gradually realized by that brain that the more powerful
  its headlights of intelligence are the plainer it is that this conscious
  individual life on which its solicitudes center drives past the culminations
  of its powers to enfeeblement and death. Man alone of all animals looks
  beyond the lures of nature and becomes aware of death waiting for him at the
  end. All religions, all philosophies of conduct, stripped down to their bare
  essentials, express the consequent impulse to escape this inherent final
  frustration.</p>

  <p>And when you come to clear up the fog you find, says Steele, that the real
  attempt life is making in all these conscious processes, is an attempt to
  raise and extend the originally quite narrow and finite self-consciousness so
  as to lift it over this primary frustration, to enable it to turn at last
  upon the king of terrors and say:</p>

  <p class="poem">"O death, where is thy sting?<br>
  O grave, where is thy victory?"</p>

  <p>Bodily immortality, immortality of the soul, the oversoul, the overman,
  the superman, the mind of the species, Nirvana, return to the bosom of god,
  undying fame, progress, service, loyalties, are all expressions at various
  angles and levels of the same essential resolve&mdash;not to live so as to
  die. Almost all of these death-evasive systems, since they are primarily
  escapes from self-concentration, imply co-operations. Something outside the
  individual life cycle is brought in, with which the individual motives can be
  blended and identified. It is a reaching out to greater entities, if you
  will, or an attempt to annex fresh territories and establish reserves of
  imagination and purpose and satisfaction beyond the reach of personal death.
  But as long as these reachings out after immortality remain various in their
  imaginative and intellectual quality, some antique, some modern, some epic,
  some lyric, some gross and some fine, vague or delicately definite, prosaic
  or poetic, their mutual contradictions so work out in conduct that we are all
  at sixes and sevens. In the increasing light of modern psychology, he asks,
  is it not possible to reduce an enormous proportion of these divergences to a
  common denominator?</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">Steele concluded his first book with a classification and
  scrutiny of what he calls "immortalities": the various systems of mental
  escape from a brooding preoccupation with death to which people in our
  present world are found to be clinging.</p>

  <p>He distinguishes two main classes of immortality, as immortality has been
  imagined. There are the immortalities that merely extend the individual self
  in time, extend even the bodily self, retaining all its definiteness, all its
  idiosyncrasies for ever; and the immortalities that merge the individual in
  some greater entity, real or imaginary, which is not subject to the personal
  cycle of birth, growth, maturity, decay, and death.</p>

  <p>The first of these two classes is the cruder and earlier. The naïve
  imagination of the child, the savage, or the simpleton cannot get far beyond
  its current state of mind. When Mrs. Bloggs sits in her back pew and hears
  the blessed hope of immortality coming from the pulpit, it is Mrs. Bloggs
  herself, body and soul, thirty-five, a little faded, kindly, and tending to
  put on weight, who is to live, she understands, eternal in the heavens.
  Dressed rather differently perhaps, more in the bridesmaid style, but
  otherwise the same. Going on and yet staying put, for ever and ever and
  ever.</p>

  <p>It is outside the scope of these simpler minds, Steele remarks, to reflect
  that an individual life is a cycle and not a static state. It is an incessant
  movement from a birth to a death and a dispersal. Its pace may vary but the
  movement never ceases altogether and its direction is constant. It is not to
  be arrested; it is not to be reversed. Its end is as essential to it as its
  beginning. Where there is no "What next?" there is no life. We pass from
  state to state, forgetting something and taking in something at every stage.
  The old man is not the same thing as his boyhood's self or his adolescent
  self; he is a continuation of that. He has lost powers and gained them.</p>

  <p>By insisting upon this idea that the individual is a succession of phases
  and can never remain in any single phase or be represented by any single
  phase, that he or she evolves and decays continually, that either the whole
  cycle must persist or none of it can persist, Steele gradually crumbles down
  all imaginable conceptions of personal immortality. In a crowning section he
  sweeps together, in all their vagueness and sentimentality and imaginative
  poverty, a multitude of descriptions of the future life&mdash;from the
  Semitic Paradise and a variety of ancient religious writings and visions to
  the strange inventions of our modern mediums. It is wonderful how poor in the
  way of objectives and activities is the content of these future lives. Their
  appeal to the imagination is extraordinarily feeble. We can indulge in
  reveries about living at the North Pole or in Mexico or Arabia, but who in
  reverie has ever lived the future life? The imagination falls for sheer lack
  of nourishment. These personal immortalities, he concludes, are premature and
  quite futile efforts to satisfy this craving to escape individual death. And
  they are all inherently unsound, they are fallacious fantasies, bankrupt
  propositions.</p>

  <p>"One is not dealing here with something that can be considered a matter of
  opinion. One is dealing with a confusion of thought that dissolves to nothing
  under a lucid scrutiny."</p>

  <p>But the case, he insists, is very different with his second class of
  immortalities. He calls these "merger-immortalities." There one deals with
  psychological possibilities. If one calls immortality the soul then, he
  suggests, it is true that a man may save his soul by losing it. The breaking
  down of the physical and mental isolation of the self-seeking individual is
  in accordance with the practices of nature. We see this in all the
  offspring-cherishing creatures and still more so in the family-forming and
  social animals. They think nothing of self-sacrifice for the herd or for
  their young. Even in the lowliest types of men there are great systems of
  personal abandon. There are love loyalties, family loyalties, group
  loyalties, tribal loyalties. Steele goes on in his sweeping way to dedare
  that all morality, all religious theory, amounts psychologically to this:
  that it is a systemization of the relationship between the self-seeking ego
  and these outer less egoistic motivations, so that interests far transcending
  mere individual survival take over the will and consciousness and direct them
  to ends that go far beyond the limits of the individual life. In these
  respects man can go off at a tangent from the cycle of the individual life,
  and that tangent may be produced indefinitely.</p>

  <p>So far as a human being transfers his will and hope to those tangential
  ends, he may, says Steele, escape ultimate frustration. If he can really
  believe in a deity who lives for ever, or in a nation or an
  interest&mdash;scientific research for instance, or intellectual progress or
  what not&mdash;which may go on indefinitely, and in so far as he can identify
  himself with it, he reduces death to secondary importance in his scheme of
  things. He has found deliverance from "the body of this death."</p>

  <p>Steele's examination of the religions that seem to promise the common man
  an endless personal immortality is very acute and searching. The crude
  promise seems to be made to, and is certainly believed to be made by, the
  common believer in such religions as Islam and Christianity, but directly one
  passes from what one may call the street form of the faith, qualifications
  and ambiguities creep in. Steele cites St. Paul's Epistle to the Corinthians.
  (XV) as a typical instance of this disposition to whittle away the crude
  primary promise. "All flesh is not the same flesh...There are also celestial
  bodies and bodies terrestrial, but the glory of the celestial is one and the
  glory of the terrestrial is another...So also is the resurrection of the
  dead...There is a natural body and there is a spiritual body...Now this I
  say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God,
  neither doth corruption inherit incorruption."</p>

  <p>Plainly there had been mental troubles at Corinth and Paul, troubled
  perhaps himself, deals with them with extreme caution and extremely little
  confidence.</p>

  <p>And having shown that the only completely reasonable way in which the
  individual can escape from the conclusive frustration of death is by merger
  into some greater being, Steele goes on to a survey and tabulation of the
  main sorts of these "merger immortalities." They are of all shapes and sizes,
  simplicities, complexities, inadequacies, and satisfactoriness. They vary
  with the critical capacity and imaginative powers of the individual. He shows
  that there is no essential difference between the devotion of patriotism and
  a religious devotion, that every sort of disinterested preoccupation is a
  form of escape from the frustration terror, the terror of being left lonely
  before the advance of inevitable fate. Socialism and especially its
  exaggeration, communism, stand on a footing of entire psychological
  equivalence to religion. "Service" is an almost empty phrase with the same
  intention. The sweated worker, the humiliated Christian, the unsuccessful
  business man can get away from inferiority and defeat and live triumphant
  again in his sentiment or his faith.</p>

  <p>So the rational way for the intelligent man, assailed and beleaguered by
  assured individual frustration, is to set himself to discover the comple test
  form of "merger immortality" available for him and to shape and subordinate
  his conduct to that.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">Is the statement of a <i>best</i> merger-immortality
  possible? Steele asks, with the answer "Yes" plainly in his mind. He would
  never, I think, have begun the <i>Anatomy of Frustration</i> if that had not
  been in his mind. Are all the mystic gods and all the great causes and
  loyalties only different and imperfect formulae for some more comprehensive
  flux of effort and desire into which they can all be melted?</p>

  <p>Yes, says Steele. He believes himself that there is no truly rational
  objective, no sound and sure merger immortality, enduring and practicable and
  satisfying, for any intelligent human being except a thorough-going
  self-identification with the human will and intelligence considered as a
  synthesis of the will-drives and the mental-drives of the entire species. He
  rarely writes it Humanity; he writes it Life; but he admits that outside the
  human range consciousness of, much less participation in, anything of the
  sort is negligible.</p>

  <p>He evokes this Life Being of his with such a strength of conviction, he
  holds it so firmly, that it is difficult to keep in mind how modern and
  experimental is this general statement of his. Without the biological and
  psychological thought of the past third of a century it could not have been
  made.</p>

  <p>The only way of escape from ultimate frustration for every living
  intelligence, the only way that opens a vista that can remain an open vista,
  lies now through this formula: "I am Life"&mdash;or what is practically the
  same thing: "I am Man."</p>

  <p>But this is not a new faith and conception of conduct that replaces
  outworn and discredited faiths. "A new faith now and thus, and everything
  wrong before," would be altogether contrary to Steele's line of thought.
  Nearly everything was right or in the right direction before, but
  insufficient and prematurely conclusive. He unrolls a vast panorama of all
  the gods and divine chiefs, the mystical interpretations, the causes and
  devotions, the churches and organizations, the <i>patrias</i> and gangs, the
  family honor and the caste duty to which the imagination of man in his fight
  against the dark flood of loneliness has dung. Steele examines them without
  impatience. Minds at every stage of development, in every age, have been
  driven to these types of resort by the same psychological need. From that
  point of view they are the same thing. The seeking tentacle grips this or
  that, but it is the same tentacle.</p>

  <p>And even if the gods are found to be incredible, if they fail the votary
  in the hour of need, if the dogmas lead to mutual destruction and the
  devotions become a trap for fruitless self-immolation, that does not end the
  quest; the demand remains. A multitude of solutions that do not go far
  enough, nor wide enough, that betray their own unsoundness, is no
  demonstration of the impossibility of any solution. Put your explored God in
  a museum or your illusions in the discard; you will be driven to try again.
  And so, taking an indication from this source and a phrase from that, Steele,
  through a sort of <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of all preceding finalities,
  emerges with his own modern solution, which is, to put it simply,
  self-identification with the whole of life.</p>

  <p>That means, in conduct, that behavior is shaped so that its main
  conception is the co-operative rendering and development of experience, and
  the progressive development in the whole race of a co-ordinated will to
  continue and expand. This gives very dear and definite conceptions of what is
  right or wrong in the social, economic, and political organizations which
  hold us together. And it gives equally clear indications of what is
  permissible or unjustifiable in personal behavior. It takes world peace and
  social justice in its stride; it makes world peace kinetic, a clearance for
  action, and sod al justice a scheme not of rights but opportunities.</p>

  <p>In expounding this, which he offers as the Iatest and best of all
  statements of immortality, Steele reminds one not a little of Paul on Mars
  Hill: "Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you." There
  is the same confident striving for an immense simplification. I suppose every
  man who has ever sat down to tell his religion to others has something of the
  same feeling, that at last he is out of the estuary marshes and channels and
  making for the sought-for open sea.</p>

  <p>"And now," says Steele, "we can really open up this subject of man's
  frustration. For with the broad tablelands of our common human opportunity,
  widespread and inviting before us, seen plainly, stated clearly, why do we
  not go on to them, why are we not hurrying toward them, why are we not in
  fact already there? Why does our species&mdash;which is I&mdash;which is
  you&mdash;still live in division and confusion? Is this now no more than a
  temporary state of disorganization, the old confusions still going on,
  because of the extreme newness of the new ideas, or is the fog a permanent
  condition of human life? Shall we be for ever a medley of individuals
  striving to escape from a frustration that will at last dose in upon us
  all?"</p>

  <p>For Steele at least the answer was No. He insists that he as Man is the
  unending Beginner. That a full and happy phase of living as individuals and
  as a species is now within our reach&mdash;at hand. What delays us? What
  hampers us? These become the master questions in life now, and the Anatomy of
  Frustration the supreme study for mankind.</p>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p class="first">Steele sets himself to present in considerable detail the
  possible world community toward which life is thrusting now, the sort of All
  in which the individual is to live. Just as in his big first volume he made a
  very respectable attempt to get all the gods and philosophies of mankind into
  one great boiling, so in his third volume he gets together a very impressive
  mass of Utopias, revolutionary plans, reconstruction plans, social
  criticisms, and does what he can to make an extract that shall be the
  quintessence of the desire behind all this discontent, all this hope and
  scheming for change. He rejects what he calls "mere envy and vindictiveness
  systems," mere reversals of conditions by which the mighty are to be laid low
  and the humble and meek exalted, and he concentrates on substantial
  proposals. His purpose is to find what is wanting positively, what is wanted
  positively.</p>

  <p>He makes a shrewd criticism of Utopias generally. They do not, he points
  out, investigate what is desired by men; they assume&mdash;often very
  rashly&mdash;what is desired by men, they leave that unstated and implicit,
  and merely set about showing us ingenious ways by which these un-formulated
  ends are to be attained.</p>

  <p>But if we read between the lines we can, nevertheless, bring out from the
  implicit to the explicit in this mélange of projects and dreams, the real
  ends which are "commonly acceptable to the human imagination." That is as
  much unanimity as he feels is possible for any human beings, and it is as
  much as he requires. Impulses purely personal and anti-social, will always,
  he admits, be flaring out in human conduct. That does not matter so far as a
  general statement of purpose goes. If such impulses can be kept to individual
  limitations and prevented from running over into contagion and social
  complication, they will by their very diversity and discordance neutralize
  one another. When he says what is "generally desired" by men, he means no
  more than this, "what <i>most men, most of the time,</i> if the thing is put
  to them, will agree should be achieved and which they will even profess
  themselves willing to assist in achieving."</p>

  <p>From this he goes on to find the most general formula for the common
  desire.</p>

  <p>Freedom, Steele begins, if you use the word broadly, is the primary desire
  of living things. Almost all that they desire either individually or in
  common, can be expressed as a freedom, as an escape from a limitation. When
  they want peace it is really freedom from the intense preoccupation and
  danger of war. When they want plenty it is freedom from the irksomeness of
  want and toil. When they obey, it is to relieve themselves of the immediate
  penalties of compulsion. When they dance or drill or sing or shout in unison,
  it is to free themselves from the lonely conspicuousness of initiative, the
  essential agoraphobia. "Men will only willingly place themselves under the
  disciplines of organized effort <i>in</i> order to remain, in some nearer and
  more essential respect, free." This is a fundamental paradox in the structure
  of human communities. We consent to a common social order in order to
  preserve our freedoms, just as on the wider basis of religious conduct we
  dissolve ourselves into merger-immortalities in order to save our souls
  alive.</p>

  <p>We can now go a step farther in our examination of the general desire of
  mankind.</p>

  <p>Man desires peace upon his planet. He desires release from the perpetual
  anxiety of impending violence, compulsion, conscription, discipline, effort,
  destruction, waste, and death, which the organization of his affairs into
  war-making societies and states involves. And he lives now in a world in
  which peace and a general release from these obsessions could plainly be
  attained and secured by the practical fusion of the foreign offices of quite
  a few "Great Powers" in the world. Every main line and structure of a World
  Pax has been thought out and projected. There is no other method of peace.
  The plans for an eternal world peace have been convincingly sketched in
  outline by a score of thinkers and writers. The deepening horror of the
  alternatives to such a settlement, the horror of air-warfare, gas warfare,
  the habitual practice of treacheries and cruelties, social disorganization,
  economic dislocation, social and biological degringolade has been made plain
  to the general imagination. Peace ballots and suchlike canvassing of the
  popular mind show an explicit realization of the situation.</p>

  <p>For all that, we prepare steadily for war and drift toward war. Yet there
  is the desire. There is the broad conception of a method for its
  satisfaction. Why is it frustrated?</p>

  <p>There can be no other answer than that, for all its wide distribution,
  that desire for peace is too weak, too discontinuous, and too unto-ordinated
  for the adverse impulses.</p>

  <p>Moreover, man desires plenty, which again has become now&mdash;whatever
  the conditions of economic life may have been in the past&mdash;a reasonable
  and feasible desire. He desires release from preoccupation with sordid needs,
  anxieties, and uncongenial toil. There is the completest justification for
  that desire. The thing could be arranged. Whatever may have been the case in
  the past, it is now a commonplace that "men starve in the midst of potential
  plenty." And they go on starving! We have had the possibility of economic
  abundance and the necessity of a World Pax plainly before us for two whole
  generations at least, and we have scarcely budged a step toward their
  realization in spite of that worldwide desire.</p>

  <p>And having reiterated these commonplaces of our time, Steele opens out
  what is destined to become the ruling thought of most of the rest of the
  <i>Anatomy.</i> It is that motives are things of deeper origin than
  intellectual convictions and that the real will of <i>Homo sapiens is</i>
  still largely unaffected by his conscious and formulated wishes. His
  intentions are one thing, his behavior quite another. The world's expressed
  desire, its conscious desire, is such and such; the total complex of human
  impulses is quite another system, darker, deeper, and profoundly more
  real.</p>

  <p>These desires for world unity and sane economics are conscious and
  intellectual desires, he says, and they scarcely penetrate at all into that
  more primitive and substantial mental mass which is the true reservoir of
  motives and impulses. It is only in its conscious Iucid region that the mind
  of man has yet apprehended his new conditions. The unspoken is far more
  potent than the spoken. Our religions, our philosophies, our creeds and
  faiths and loyalties, float unsubstantially upon these inarticulate and
  potent realities of our lives. The latter affect and confuse and frustrate
  the former. They split them up; they misdirect and misapply them; they
  sterilize them. The reciprocal action of the former has still to be made
  effective.</p>

  <p>Unless that can be done complete frustration lies before mankind...</p>

     id="ch2"></a>PART II. &mdash; TOWARD THE NEXT BEGINNING</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Harper's Magazine</i>, May 1936</h3>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="intro">THIS is the second of three installments in which we present
  (in somewhat abridged form) Mr. Wells's latest work. It is built on a curious
  plan, for it purports to be a summary and critique of a ten-volume treatise
  called <i>The Anatomy of Frustration,</i> by one William Burroughs Steele. In
  the first installment, which we published last month, Mr. Wells outlined the
  early part of Steele's argument somewhat as follows: All religions, all human
  aspirations, are efforts to <i>defeat</i> death, to achieve
  immortality&mdash;either personal survival after death (which Steele declares
  to be a primitive form for the aspiration to take) or "merger-immortality":
  identification of ourselves with something which can endure. Of all the
  numerous forms of "merger-immortality" (identification of ourselves with our
  family, or community, or caste, or country, or fellow-religionists, or
  fellow-proletarians, or what not) the best form, declares Steele, is
  identification of ourselves with all humanity. Other religions and creeds are
  partial, incomplete; they clash with one another and thus often lead to
  bitterness, war, frustration; this one alone opens "a vista that can remain
  an open vista." Now in this second installment Mr. Wells carries on his
  critical summary of the argument of Steele's imaginary treatise, discussing
  the inadequacy of the codes by which men now live their emotional lives, and
  showing how Steele calls for a New Beginning.&mdash;The
  <i>Editors.</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">AS we proceed, it becomes evident that the <i>Anatomy of
  Frustration</i> is mainly a study of the struggle of those ideas which,
  however much they may be distorted or disguised, are the gist of all our
  religious, social, and political desires&mdash;(1) self-merger in a world
  order, (2) participation in an unending research and adventure, and (3) the
  attainment of a personal, shared, and re-echoed happiness&mdash;against
  frustration by that dark undertow of unformulated or disguised impulses which
  still supplies a great part, and possibly the greater part, of the directive
  force of human conduct.</p>

  <p>So the next phase in <i>the Anatomy of Frustration</i> is a political,
  economic, and social psycho-analysis both of the individual and of the
  specific man (overman) of which the individual is a specimen and part. It is
  a correlation of one's declared purpose with one's real behavior, and of our
  collective protestations with our community activities.</p>

  <p>There is nothing partisan or doctrinaire in Steele's use of the
  generalizations of psycho-analysis. He follows no "master," he belongs to no
  "school." He draws upon Freud or Adler or Jung as it suits him, and he finds
  no necessity to adjudicate precisely upon their differences. He treats their
  terminology not as an exact scientific vocabulary, but as an accumulation of
  penetrating and inspiring metaphors which illuminate rather than define. The
  psycho-analysts have opened our eyes to the artificiality of our rationalized
  conceptions of ourselves and our social relations; and that, for Steele, is
  the supreme importance of psycho-analysts.</p>

  <p>In accordance with his endorsement of the generalizations of
  psycho-analysis, Steele delivers his attack upon frustration along two
  different lines and at two different levels. One is an intellectual attack, a
  close examination, a scrutiny, of the relations between our rational
  conscious scheme of intentions and the unlit drives of behavior of which we
  are only now becoming clearly aware. And the second part of Steele's attack
  consists in practical applications of the ideas exposed and clarified by this
  intellectual attack.</p>

  <p>The essential purpose of all law, all discipline, all training, he says,
  is the enthronement of a clear general purpose above a subjugated and
  directed subconsciousness. The objective of education is the control of
  dividing, contradictory, and dissipating impulses.</p>

  <p>Incidentally, Steele devotes some passages of unrestrained contempt to
  what he calls the "natural virtue" schools of such educational "progressives"
  as Neill and his associates. Education, Steele dogmatizes, is a mental
  readjustment; it is essentially a release from instinctive inhibitions and a
  restraint upon instinctive impulses.</p>

  <p>"I live in an age," says Steele, "when my assertion that morality is the
  dominating frame within which behavior must be constrained will not be very
  acceptable. The present is a phase of greatly relaxed conduct, people have
  probably never 'let themselves go' to such an extent as they do to-day; there
  are people who exalt such spontaneity almost to the level of a principle of
  action. The reader may be more or less infected by such suggestions and so
  loth to agree that the way out from the confused frustrations and
  intensifying dangers of the present lies through the imposition of a moral
  system and of laws controlling conduct more detailed and penetrating than any
  that have been observed before."</p>

  <p>Yet we are not without evidence that the prevalent impatience with
  discipline is tempered in many instances by a craving for stringent rules.
  There is agoraphobia in the normal make-up; men can be afraid of their own
  freedom. The adhesions that constitute the beginnings and essential vitality
  of such organizations as the Communist party, the Fascists, and the Nazis
  manifest a spontaneous recoil from chaotic living. The instinctive desire for
  freedom in the normal human being is balanced against a real desire, which
  may even become a passionate desire, for consistent collectively effective
  living. This craving for consistency, however, is plainly a less primitive
  and universal urgency than the instinct for freedom. Regulations may come and
  go in human affairs, but insubordination and rebellion go on forever.</p>

  <p>Then, illustrating his case by a voluminous array of instances, Steele
  indulges in one of these paradoxical arguments which are so characteristic of
  his thought. The present enfeeblement of authoritative moral injunctions, he
  declares, is due to our increasingly urgent need for them. Outworn codes do
  not work, makeshifts will not work, and we are impatient with their futile
  restraints. Confronted with conditions that are continually increasing in
  complexity and scope, we find the systems of morality and justice that were
  good enough in the cruder past no help to us at all. It is not that we have
  abandoned morality but that morality, as it has been understood hitherto, has
  broken down under us. It is not sound enough nor extensive enough. It has not
  developed with our need for it.</p>

  <p>This is something that cannot be too loudly and frequently asserted. Among
  the multitudes of peoples who are "going lax" in the modern community there
  are numbers of others who are trying, often quite desperately and violently,
  to get back to some real or imagined ancient virtue. They "lunge backward" at
  morality. "Duty and Discipline" movements, Fascisms, and so forth are
  saturated with this impulse toward a convulsive revivalism. They are harsh
  because they are intensely urgent. The strain of artificial effort, the fear
  of not "holding it," release deep founts of cruelty. These discipline and
  obedience movements are misguided and hysterically harsh, but there they are.
  They are natural responses to an imperfectly apprehended necessity.</p>

  <p>Steele compares these reactionary moral movements to people who are taking
  to the boats from a sinking liner and then, terrified by the roughness of the
  seas about them, fight to go back to the doomed yet comforting hull they have
  voyaged in so long. Every age of enforced change has these phases of moral
  panic, and he cites a score of authorities from Tacitus onward, to show the
  parallelisms of the Roman breakdown.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">From such scholarly exercises Steele turns to make a
  vehement onslaught on the "barbaric" moralities of the past and in particular
  on the Ten Commandments. As a moral basis, he declares, these last are
  fantastically inadequate. The respect with which they were treated by the
  teachers of our youth has warped our judgment about them. We see them
  transfigured by the pyrotechnics of Sinai. We dare not see how limited and
  silly they are. As a basis for a working modern morality these stone tablets,
  relics of the Stone Age, are "about as much good as a nursery rhyme or any
  other folk-lore fossil."</p>

  <p>As a beginning for righteous economic behavior, for example, "Thou shalt
  not steal," he declares, is hardly more helpful than "Simple Simon met a
  pieman, going to the fair." The latter jingle indeed does "put a certain
  debatable stress upon the importance of a cash guarantee before
  delivery."</p>

  <p>Steele makes a jumble of posers to illustrate the difficulties of a modern
  man anxious to do well, anxious to play his part as a helpful cog-wheel in
  the human ensemble, faced by the solemn insufficiencies of our open lattice
  of laws and sentiments and moral "imperatives." What do the Ten Commandments
  tell a man about doing good work for low rates or selling specious bad work
  on a rising market? May he speculate in staple supplies? May he corner
  necessities? What have the Ten Commandments to say about veracity in
  salesmanship&mdash;about revealing unsuspected defects to an unwary buyer?
  Have they a word of reproach or approval for the miser?</p>

  <p>Is a voter right to consider his private interests at the polling booth?
  What is a man's whole duty to his children? Must he pay taxes to an upstart
  government? When is he justified, or is he ever justified, in resisting the
  law? Is a life spent mainly in sport better or worse than one spent <i>in</i>
  scientific research? What are we to do about passive resistance to
  warfare&mdash;or about passive resisters? And so he goes on in a sweeping
  survey of the endless "open questions" of our time.</p>

  <p><i>What good,</i> cries Steele, in a sort of refrain after each "open
  question," are your old Ten Commandments for that?</p>

  <p>Modern conduct now is hardly more than unsystematized casuistry; much is
  pure wantonness without an attempt at excuse. You may supplement the vast
  inadequacies of your code with pious sentiments, nice formless sentiments,
  "things of the spirit," that will not have the ghost of a chance against the
  subconscious drives they will attempt to control. "Do unto others as you
  would they should do unto you," he quotes, and asks: "What sort of form may
  that not take in the actions of a man untrained in veracity and
  self-criticism? It assumes you have the immense imaginative power needed to
  reverse your role. And in an unjust situation what you do to a man and what
  he would like you to do to him may both be thoroughly wrong."</p>

  <p>How can our modern world escape frustration, he asks, when great masses of
  people think they can shape a satisfactory scheme of conduct on such
  antiquated, patched-up, and entirely insufficient standards? It is like
  hoping to carry a torrent of motor traffic along a mountain mule track. But
  how can we have anything much better than our present collection of antiques
  and makeshifts until we sit down and work out the conception of the duties
  and reciprocities of a social organization with at least as much thoroughness
  as that with which the parts and purposes of an engine or an industrial plant
  are worked out? Or to choose perhaps a better simile, how can we know whether
  a part of a living body is functioning properly or needs treatment and
  correction until we have something like an idea of the general physiological
  process?</p>

  <p>From which survey of our moral confusion and distress, our inability to
  impose any systematic direction of conduct upon the impulses from the
  subconscious that drive us, Steele presently emerges in his own fashion, with
  the explanation that all this is inevitable in a state of social readjustment
  like the present. The old order of a patchwork of states and communities
  dissolves all about us&mdash;their morality dissolving with them&mdash;and
  until the new world-order becomes plain before us, we must, whether we like
  it or not, flounder for want of a moral code in a wasteful and dangerous
  miscellany of motives. Humanity is in labor and will be worse before it is
  better. A modernized moral code and a world social organization are
  reciprocal and you cannot have one without the other.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">One of Steele's most frequent words, used always in a
  condemnatory sense, in his discussion of human relationships, is "piecemeal."
  We are always, he says, trying to detach questions from complicating issues
  and work them out. We make them manageable and calculable by making them
  over-simple. That may be helpful at times, provided we do not mistake a
  convenient step in thought for a final and practical conclusion. No doubt
  there was a certain justification for the classical mathematical problem
  about the logs and the elephant's task, in which the solver was permitted to
  "neglect the weight of the elephant," but no practical end was possible until
  the weight of the elephant was brought in. In our social and political
  discussions there are neglected elephants everywhere. We are all in a state
  of "flustered dogmatism" because of the unacknowledged presence of these
  exasperating animals.</p>

  <p>Steele is very emphatic that we cannot discuss money without a general
  theory of property, that we cannot discuss property without a general theory
  of economic organization, that we cannot discuss economic organization
  without a general political and social ideal, and that we cannot have a
  general political and social ideal without a comprehensive conception of
  human ecology.</p>

  <p>To-day we as a species are thoroughly at cross purposes, mainly because we
  will not go back to fundamentals but will persist in beginning anywhere in
  the air at our own sweet will and so doom ourselves to disagreement. That is
  why so much of our discussion about money, for example, in spite of our
  realization of its urgency and importance, seems so infinitely wearisome,
  futile, and silly, and why most of it is saturated with an almost Marxian bad
  temper and bad manners.</p>

  <p>"I assume <i>the</i> world community," says Steele, "subject to gcneral
  ecological laws. I cannot discuss money and property in relation to any more
  restricted community. I have massed my reasons for doing that and I cannot
  see why so many people who deal with finance and economics generally evade
  and ignore this necessary foundation assumption. Everybody you trade with or
  plunder or pay tribute to or even set barriers against is, if only as a
  pressure from outside, in your economic community, and has to be brought into
  your scheme. It is a pedantic imbecility to ignore that."</p>

  <p>You cannot have a property-money system by itself&mdash;leading a life of
  its own&mdash;any more than you can have a heart and circulation Ieading a
  life of its own. You cannot begin at the City or the Treasury or the ghetto
  and its practices as primary. The circulatory system depends upon all the
  other organs in the animal to which it belongs and upon the scale and extent
  of the entire creature. The circulatory system of a crayfish is quite
  different from that of an oyster or that of a man. The property-money system
  of an isolated island or a hidden kingdom can have only the remotest
  resemblances to that of a wide-trading world empire. The property-money
  system of a state striving to realize communist formulae is necessarily
  different fundamentally from that of an autocracy or an individualistic
  democracy. The whole of the parts belong together and are one.</p>

  <p>He goes on to a further exposure of this current vice of "habitual
  piecemeal thinking."</p>

  <p>It is, he declares&mdash;and proves it by a vast chapter of
  quotations&mdash;one of the strangest things in the history of Socialism that
  for the better part of a hundred years socialists have advocated the most
  drastic alterations and limitations of the conventions of property and have
  refused persistently to face the complications of their problem, due,
  <i>first,</i> to the role of money and monetary manipulation in abstracting
  and liquidating ownership and bilking the worker through the varying value of
  his pay, and, <i>second,</i> to the impossibility of expropriating private
  individuals or modifying the current tradition and methods of production and
  distribution without a concurrent development of a new type and a new
  morality of administration.</p>

  <p>Socialism, says Steele, never produced a trustworthy coin for the worker
  or a "competent receiver" for expropriated capital. The nearest approach to a
  new money that the Socialist movement ever made in its long hundred years of
  mentally evasive incubation was the Labor Notes of Robert Owen&mdash;after
  which it dropped the subject altogether&mdash;and the nearest thing to an
  administrative organization it ever evolved was the Communist Party. This was
  essentially a revolutionary organization, a conspiracy, secretive and
  quasi-criminal. It was more so, Steele thinks, than it need have been. It was
  an organization quite unfitted for the candid control of a great modernized
  community, and to this day the government of the Russian republics, in spite
  of the lingering hope and enthusiasm of their first release, is dark and
  conspiratorial in its character because of the complete inadequacy of the
  positive conceptions of Marxism, and because of the consequent drift toward
  disingenuous intrigue and the stagnation of a political oligarchy.</p>

  <p>Why did Socialism never round off and complete its proposals? Why did it
  leave these things to go wrong? It began with a real magnificence. It started
  with the bravest intimations of a new world order; it was the inspiring idea,
  the creative hope of a century. Hundreds of thousands of lively minds made
  incalculable sacrifices, toiled and risked death in the hope of bringing
  about Socialism, until at last that long parturition culminated in the birth
  of this obdurate Eastern monster without eyes or ears. Why did it happen like
  that? asks Steele. Why did Socialism persist in incompleteness and end in an
  abortion?</p>

  <p>The answer, Steele thinks, lies partly in the exigencies of militant
  propaganda. Socialism went into action from its beginning; it was put forward
  as a complete project long before it had had any chance of maturing. It was
  rushed into a premature offensive by impatient and shortsighted men. This
  necessitated vulgarization and simplification; complexities had to be ignored
  and difficulties denied. It had to be made easy for the beginner. It had to
  be made plausible. It had to produce catchwords and slogans. It had to lock
  up its brains in its campaign. "You stop thinking," Steele throws out, "when
  you begin the hunt for disciples." And after a time these strategic
  suppressions, these deliberate avoidances, became sacred, became
  orthodox.</p>

  <p>The impatience of the careerist mingled with the impatience of the
  wholesale proselytizer in this early fixation of Socialism. Energetic men to
  whom the normal channels of ambition were denied wanted to cut a figure in a
  new revolutionary drive. They perceived the attractiveness of the suggestions
  of the Socialist formulae, and they wanted to exploit that attractiveness
  with an uncomplicated directness. There were to be no poor and no one at a
  disadvantage. What more need be said in an age of universal suffrage? To
  qualify or criticize was enfeeblement of effect, sabotage, downright
  treachery. It would mean having to wait and reconsider instead of getting
  on.</p>

  <p>The long chapter which Steele calls "The Quintessence of Socialist
  Biography" is a quiet lake of pure vitriol. He never lapses into invective;
  he prefers juxtaposition to comment. He takes life after life, personality
  after personality, restricting himself largely to quotations from the spoken
  words of the poor galaxy of premature "leaders" that Socialism has evoked, or
  to the dreadful naked succession of facts in their careers. He dips them into
  his tranquil acid and they come out shrivelled and black. He has something
  like kindliness for Robert Owen and a slightly ironical approval for John
  Stuart Mill. A very honest man, he says, and then adds, almost as if he were
  thinking aloud, "if he had been a hen he would have laid a small very good
  egg, very carefully and precisely, about once a year." He is amused by the
  Decorator-Socialists, "Morris and Co.," slighting to civil service
  Socialists, and gay with the "antic-socialists." The nearest approach to a
  Socialist hero, the man who wilts least in the solvents of his scrutiny,
  curiously enough, is Friedrich Engels. But Engels benefits by having Karl
  Marx as his foil. It is a moral rather than an intellectual rehabilitation.
  To Marx, Steele is merciless; but then, after a few brief years of delusion,
  a whole world which overrated Marx is now finding him out&mdash;the essential
  snobbishness of his hatred of the bourgeoisie, the pretentious crudity of his
  social psychology, the hocus-pocus of his "dialectic," and the phantasmal
  nature of his "proletariat."</p>

  <p>For the reader familiar with English politics, Steele's survey of the rise
  and decline of British Socialism makes interesting if uncomfortable reading.
  It is a pitiless scrutiny of mental shirking and secondary motives, and it
  loses nothing of its effectiveness because of the apparent charity of
  Steele's deliberate style. He devotes particular attention to Ramsay
  Macdonald, because his life spans the whole story of political socialism from
  dawn to twilight. He is made the demonstration rabbit to show how a great
  hope may be frustrated. He is stewed gently in the eulogies of the loyal and
  devoted Mary Agnes Hamilton, blended carefully with quotations from his later
  speeches; he is stewed without ebullition and he is stewed to very dismal
  rags.</p>

  <p>"Let anyone who is without sin among you cast the first stone," quotes
  Steele abruptly. "I am not throwing stones at these straying pioneers to the
  Socialist utopia. What is the good of throwing stones at them? Nothing can
  ever bring them back. They are lost men. I am just picking up a few stones
  and turning them over in my hand&mdash;not casting them at all. They are not
  missiles; they are paving stones. I note, because I am obliged to note, the
  surface of that slanting road down which Socialism stumbled to its present
  frustrations..."</p>

  <p>It is no good to pretend, as the Communists did, that you have only to
  clear away one "system," the Thing that Is&mdash;the Capitalist System or
  what you will&mdash;in order to find another and better one ready-made
  underneath. That is just "the damnable inheritance of Rousseauism."</p>

  <p>There is nothing underneath any social structure but a site. Every social
  order is a complex of artificial arrangements sustained by voluntary or
  forced agreement.</p>

  <p>Every principal part in the world machine must be designed. The
  property-money system must play in with the system of production, with the
  educational system, with the organization for the extension of science, with
  the transport organization, with the biological controls. These must all be
  proportionate one to another, interacting with one another and modifiable in
  relation to one another. They must be correlated by "conditioned
  conventions." And all such structural conventions have to be supported by
  moral training and legal restraints.</p>

  <p>Socially serviceable finance, for instance, is no more instinctive in the
  natural man than aviation. He has to <i>learn</i> to live financially, to
  "play the game" in this field. He has to learn, and he has to see that by law
  and rule his fellows also learn, to play that game. By nature he is something
  of a bully and a rebel; he has to <i>learn</i> to be a restrained critic of
  and collaborator in education and government. His disposition is to be an
  indolent parasite, with an occasional impulse to do unwanted work at the
  wrong time; childish unhelpfulness clings to him as he grows up, he will be
  disposed to cheat, he will be disposed to shirk at the slightest intimation
  of restriction; he has to <i>learn</i> his general economic duty and be
  broken in to his special role in productive work and cooperation. He has to
  observe not Ten Commandments but ten score, and to adjust his code
  consistently to a complex of new occasions.</p>

  <p>So far the human mind has never planned with that much thoroughness nor
  learned to that extent; and that, says Steele, driving it home, is what is
  the matter with us all.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">From his study of those hand specimens of human
  insufficiency, the Socialist Ieaders, Steele leaps forward to vast
  generalizations.</p>

  <p>I can indicate here only the cardinal points of this planetary excursion.
  With a certain plausibility he asserts that the three or four centuries up to
  and including the career of Alexander the Great saw an expansion of human
  possibilities and human ideas as great as anything that has happened in the
  past hundred years. It was an advance beyond all precedents. It was like
  light and people coming into a darkened room. Thought broke frontiers;
  writing and money, however small their effect at first, became definite
  international forces; systematic history, progressive knowledge, political
  scheming began. Buddhism was the first universal religion, finding receptive
  minds everywhere. The idea of human unity under one ruler or under one God or
  under one cyclic scheme took shape. Then it was that the coming world
  community was conceived.</p>

  <p>There has never been a generation in the world since in which somewhere
  men were not carrying on toward that end, adding something to the project,
  pressing along some new line of hope. He gives separate chapters of shrewd
  sketchiness to several of these futile storms of creative urgency. He follows
  modernist ideas in his estimate of the roles of St. Paul, Mithraism and
  Egyptian religiosity, in the frustration of the universality of Jesus.</p>

  <p>Finally he arraigns one of the most debatable texts in the New Testament.
  "I would like," he says, "to know about the man who wrote in that text about
  `rendering unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's and unto God the things
  that are God's.' He must have been a nice politic soul and very anxious to
  see Christianity getting on in the world. He would have worn a court suit
  with <i>the</i> rest of the Labor members if he had lived eighteen hundred
  years later. A Jesus who could dodge away from his own Kingdom of Heaven like
  that would never have died on the cross." For indeed in that Kingdom of
  Heaven he proclaimed God was all, and Caesar and his coins as subject to
  righteousness as Dives or Lazarus.</p>

  <p>Then Steele turns to the frustration of democratic revolution in America
  and France. Here again were two associated phases when the endlessly thwarted
  and endless hopefulness of men broke out and yielded much generous living,
  much fraternity, and honest social rectification before it faded out again in
  face of the uncharted immensity of its task. It had not taken the septic
  possibilities of property and money into its calculations&mdash;among other
  omissions. It was more "piecemeal" even than its successor, Socialism.</p>

  <p>"The Moscow Frustration," as Steele tells of it, is a study in the
  deterioration of yet another blazing star of hope. The soul of Bolshevism was
  suffocated mainly by its own protective police and by strategic intolerance.
  The Bolshevik leaders were so preoccupied, so unprepared, and overworked that
  they could not scrutinize their police. They had to trust somewhere; and they
  had the urgent man's fear of an open, delaying wrangle. Suppression grew rank
  under their feet. They would rather keep on the wrong course than risk the
  loss of élan involved in a halt for consultation. They did not realize the
  danger from within; the secret slackening and deterioration when the bracing
  inhibitions of criticism are withheld.</p>

  <p>All this part of Steele's work is very incomplete. These chapters are mere
  schemes for studies in modern history. Apparently he intended to call in help
  to fill in his outline of human disappointments. If he had been a
  multimillionaire he would, I think, have endowed scores of special chairs in
  the science of history. As distinguished from mere factual arrangements, it
  is indeed a new science. I think he is inclined to be over-critical of
  Russia, just as he is too harsh with poor old Marx because of some subtle
  strain of disappointment in this direction. He is angry at their inadequacy
  and imperfection&mdash;because in some respects they come near being right.
  They made his sensitiveness to frustration most acute.</p>

  <p>The point Steele stresses in all these cases of a fresh start is that
  essentially they failed through incompleteness, and through that intolerance
  and incapacity for modification and assimilation which arise out of
  impatience.</p>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p class="first">Steele is so far forgetful of his own urgency for
  simplification and lucidity that he nowhere gives a synopsis of the Next
  Beginning which is to synthesize all the creative social conceptions that
  mankind has so far accumulated. But to the attentive readers of his
  voluminous <i>Anatomy</i> the shape of his intentions is perfectly plain. I
  am trying to make a bare statement of it here, to make Steele as clear as I
  can to those who do not know his <i>Anatomy.</i></p>

  <p>Here of course there is no panacea, no final dogmatic Plan. It is the
  attempt of one man to envisage the present complex of creative desire and
  impulse in the world, and the present possibilities of realizations. It is a
  report upon current initiatives rather than a plan. It is a clarifying
  summary, not an innovation.</p>

  <p>And first it is to be noted how plainly now the political unification of
  mankind frames the Next Beginning. The two Beginnings that preceded our own
  time, democratic republicanism, the last but one, and Socialism, the last,
  did indeed both glance at internationalism, but in an "idealistic" and
  subconsciously hopeless manner. They then sat down to the promotion of
  "national" revolutions. It needed propaganda by radio, the hum of the
  airplane, and the fear of gas warfare to teach even progressive thought that
  the world has now, in plain fact and law and intention, to be made one. The
  Next Beginning must be inevitably a world scheme. It must be a scheme for the
  production and distribution of all staple requirements throughout the whole
  earth. It must be a planetary economic plan with a universal theory of
  property and payment. It must involve one common monetary method because
  <i>in an organized economic life there can be no general individual freedom
  without the method of cash payments,</i> for these alone can liberate men
  from the slavery of payment in kind.</p>

  <p>It must provide a system of world directorates for these common interests
  and it must insure that these directorates work in an atmosphere of adequate
  criticism, and are in some way, direct or indirect, made responsible for
  their conduct to the general intelligence. This basal material organization
  must be explained to and understood by the whole world; an understanding of
  the social life of the species must be the main objective of a universal
  education, and the service and protection of the world commonweal, the
  primary form of moral training. This primary unity must determine also the
  hygienic and biological organization of the world. Religious life must
  conform, on its social side, to the requirements of this
  world-civilization.</p>

  <p>That, I think, states the essential form of the Next Beginning as Steele
  conceived it. World-civilization is its objective. But since human affairs
  are not at present cast in this form, it is necessary to supplement the
  statement and elaboration of the concept of a world-commonweal with a
  complex, studied theory of revolution. All the intricate balances, thrusts,
  and conflicts of our present fragmentary organization of life furnish and
  encumber the world arena in which the Next Beginning has to manifest itself,
  and they have to be dealt with intricately and variously in the struggle
  toward <i>a</i> synthesis.</p>

  <p>Steele puts himself into violent contrast with Communist or Fascist or
  Christian in his vigorous repudiation of the idea that any single
  organization can undertake such a fusion and reconstruction. The frustrated
  initiatives of the past have begun, he says, as "teachings," as cut and dried
  statements of objective. And by the sheer inflexibility of this style of
  beginning their frustration also began from the start. But every day the Next
  Beginning will admit it has learned something, and qualify, extend, and write
  into its creed. It will grow and change as a living being changes, remaining
  always itself. It will always be the Next Beginning making way for the Next
  Beginning. It will deliver its attack not in a phalanx but in an unending
  series of waves&mdash;as science does.</p>

  <p>Modern science has been so profoundly and permanently revolutionary
  because it set about its work with no revolutionary intentions whatever; and
  the Next Beginning, unlike any of its predecessors, must be saturated with
  the spirit of science. "World menders" have all belittled science hitherto
  because it had none of that vehemence they mistake for vigor. Now they learn
  better. Bulls may charge with their eyes shut, but not men. Freedom of
  statement, freedom of discussion throughout the world, is of as much
  importance to humanity as food or clothing. Advance easily&mdash;in open
  order. If ever any restraint whatever is put upon babble, clamor, and
  incitement in the new world, it must <i>be</i> done in order that voices may
  be heard, not that voices may be silenced.</p>

  <p>He is very insistent in his sixth book that the organization of world
  unity involves the evocation of world controls, differing both in structure
  and function from any existing government. This is one of his dominating
  ideas. He will not hear of a Parliament of Mankind or a World President or
  anything of the sort. It is, he says, "the easy preliminary pitfall" for the
  mind which first seeks to picture a world commonweal, to conceive it as a
  large-scale replica of existing state governments.</p>

  <p>Existing governments, he explains, have been evolved as militant
  directorates concerned primarily with the aggressive and defensive
  application of force. But in a world-pax the employment of force will be
  largely a reserve resource of the general police, and the main functions to
  be discharged by world-wide directive organizations will be economic,
  financial, and informative. These conceivably can arise through federal
  agreements among existing governments. The old governments did not originally
  concern themselves with economic, monetary, or biological interests, and when
  they handle them, they handle them clumsily and contentiously, with a bias
  toward their subordination to militant policy. They are not built for the
  job, and manifestly a world combination of them must be even less fitted for
  the job. They must be prepared to delegate their authority to a federal
  council of a different kind, an <i>ad hoc</i> organization for the new job.
  It is not necessary to abolish existing governments, therefore, unless they
  are directly resistant to world organization. They are beside the mark. Their
  world function will be to sanction. They will fade into functionless
  traditions as a new non-militant type of federal world organization takes
  their place and supersedes their significance.</p>

  <p>The role of the subject of any government who wishes to forward and
  participate in the Next Beginning is not, therefore, to attempt to destroy
  his own or any other government, with the idea of substituting a raw new one,
  larger and similar, but to do his utmost to render it amenable to the
  development of an economic-financial-educational federation of the world. If
  a particular government has to be destroyed forcibly in that process, and
  some may have to be destroyed forcibly, so much the worse. It will be an
  unfortunate necessity and it will leave a scar. World civilization is not
  antagonistic to existing governments except, and in so far as, and while,
  they are antagonistic to an organized world economy. But in so far as that
  antagonism is marked and deliberate, loyalty to world civilization and its
  progressive organization must override any formal political loyalty.
  Governments which control or suppress research, discussion, or truthful
  non-malignant propaganda are plainly governments in insurrection against that
  world civilization which is already demanding the loyalty of every rational
  man.</p>

  <p>Advancing behind the propaganda of these framework ideas, Steele sees the
  Next Beginning taking the form of a multitude of political and organizing
  movements for the establishment of a number of world-wide or almost
  world-wide directorates and controls. These movements may go on almost
  independently, linked only by their planetary range. In spite of all
  contemporary appearances to the contrary, Steele believed that it is not
  merely possible but urgent that in the various fields of health, money, and
  credit, in the production and distribution of staple commodities, in
  transport, and particularly air transport, in standard of life, and police,
  cosmopolitan controls should come into existence. The stars in their courses
  fight against particularism in these matters.</p>

  <h3>VI</h3>

  <p class="first">This peculiar and on the whole refreshing assurance of
  Steele's that there is only one right way of thinking about most of our
  contemporary problems, not only makes him write of this idea of his, of
  unification through the creation of a group of <i>ad hoc</i> federal
  directorates, as though it was the only possible idea for a properly informed
  clear-headed man, but also it makes him write in the same strain of assurance
  about the broad principles of economic organization. He is incapable of
  believing that there are men who can reasonably oppose the general
  propositions of collectivism, unless a subconscious craving for their
  personal profit, or some deep-rooted malice, blinds them to the logic of the
  case.</p>

  <p>Private property with its flux, money, works as a contrivance for the
  adjustment of individual motives to the commonweal, whatever its origins.
  Steele cannot imagine that proposition questioned; and he rides on from that
  to a shrewd analysis of the different types and classes of private property,
  both those that have to be recognized and protected in a modern state, and
  the broader sorts that can work efficiently only when they are vested in a
  "competent receiver" operating in the collective interest. He jeers at
  "absolute socialism." He says that men and women who can sit down to a
  serious discussion of "socialism versus individualism" are fit only for
  institutional treatment. Socialism is always a matter of degree. Progress
  toward Socialism can be only progress in the organization of the competent
  <i>receiver</i> and in the exacter definition of private property.</p>

  <p>His determination to discuss money only as a part of his general theory of
  property is implacable. He would set very definite limits to the use of
  money. Only for very definite kinds of property should there be "free sale."
  For food, clothing, adornment, transportation, and shelter, Steele would
  allow practically "free purchase"; almost every other kind of acquisition
  from a pet dog to a mountain valley he would make conditional on a more or
  less completely defined "proper use." By a reorganization of distribution and
  a development of public stock-keeping&mdash;a colossal extension of the post
  office, so to speak&mdash;he would squeeze deliberate acquisition for resale,
  passive non-manufacturing ownership for monetary profit, that is, out of the
  category of permissible things. Appparently he wanted to tariff and control
  all distributors from the shipowner to the barrow man. He is very hostile to
  what he calls profit by "interception"&mdash;meaning very much what the
  Bolsheviks, in their age of virtue, used to mean by "speculation."</p>

  <p>The establishment of "a lucid science and statement" of property-money is
  as integral to the Next Beginning as the establishment of a lucid conception
  of a world commonweal. The realization of that science and that conception,
  the conversion of that knowledge and that idea into material and living
  reality is "the general business of mankind." What other general business can
  there be? It is the formal aspect of new religion, the modern Islam.</p>

  <p>To this you must give yourself, because there is no other right thing, to
  which you can give yourself. And give yourself you must if you are to escape
  mortality.</p>

     id="ch"></a>PART III. &mdash; WHY WE ARE FRUSTRATED</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Harper's Magazine</i>, June 1936</h3>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="intro">TO readers who have not seen the preceding articles we must
  explain that Mr. Wells is presenting here what purports to be a summary and
  critique of the many-volumed life work of an imaginary writer named William
  Burroughs Steele. In the first article he showed how Steele summed up all
  religions, all human ideals and aspirations, as efforts to defeat death by
  identifying oneself with a cause greater and more lasting than oneself; and
  how Steele arrived at the conclusion that identification of oneself with all
  humanity was the only complete and, therefore, completely satisfactory form
  for such an effort to take. To identify oneself with all humanity means
  inevitably to strive for world peace and for abundance for all men. In the
  second article Mr. Wells summarized Steele's argument that all other creeds
  and causes&mdash;including socialism and communism&mdash;are partial and
  piecemeal, and therefore unsatisfactory. In the present (and final) article
  Mr. Wells&mdash;again summarizing the imaginary Steele&mdash;shows why we
  have made a botch to date of our efforts for world peace and abundance, and
  discusses the major educational changes which Steele believed to be
  imperative.&mdash;The <i>Editors.</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">IN comparison with some of his earlier volumes, Steele's
  treatment of the problem of World Peace seems remarkably close-knit. His
  peculiar aversion from negative terms, his flair for negatives disguised as
  positives, is very much in evidence. It is manifest he does not like the
  ambiguity of the word Peace for that reason. It is too easily interpreted as
  the absence of war; he harps upon the idea that Peace must be a
  <i>forceful</i> substitute for war.</p>

  <p>The gist of his argument is that World Peace is something entirely less
  natural than contention. It requires no <i>effort</i> for a man nowadays to
  remain a tax-paying obedient citizen of a modern combatant state. He finds
  himself there. The masses drift to war, individually unwilling but
  collectively feeble. When they find themselves in the war rapids it is too
  late to resist. Modern war, so far as the masses go, is not strong action; it
  is weakness. It is like the screaming and kicking of a person for whom the
  forces of life are too much and who falls into a fit of epilepsy. Peace must
  be <i>imposed</i> upon a weakly warring world. A World Pax must be a
  conquest, not an abdication.</p>

  <p>Steele deals very briefly with the vast complex of anti-war movements that
  passed across the mental surface of the world in the period after 1914. They
  were particularly prevalent in the English-speaking and Scandinavian
  communities. "They just said they wanted no more war; they said it by the
  hundred thousand, they said it by the million, they passed resolutions,
  irresolute resolutions, they printed tons of books and pamphlets, and they
  did no more about it." And then he settles down to a long and penetrating
  analysis of the League of Nations experiment.</p>

  <p>The League of Nations, Steele asserts, was brought to futility by bad
  analogies. Slovenly and inadequate thinking, he declares, is one day a matter
  of the study and the newspaper office, and the next a spreading virus of
  human disaster. The last thing human beings will learn is that it is
  impossible to get good results from a bad arrangement of ideas. The men who
  conceived the League of Nations had old-fashioned legalist and not modern
  biological minds; they floated on conventions and were incapable of
  penetrating to realities. And so the League of Nations to which great numbers
  of people looked for saving veracities never produced anything better than
  evasive formulae.</p>

  <p>For decades two bad analogies paralyzed the human will for unity. The
  first of these was the false analogy which paralleled states with human
  individuals. The personification of states played a large part in human
  frustration in the early twentieth century. Small states were given such
  characters as "brave and little" <i>and</i> in the political interplay their
  "rights" were maintained exactly as the "rights" of small individuals were
  maintained against bigger or more powerful associates. But in reality a small
  state of five million inhabitants is exactly one-twentieth as important as a
  great state of one hundred billions. It is not an individual at all.</p>

  <p>The League of Nations organization is based on this false analogy. It does
  not simply ignore, it contradicts the reality that the whole earth belongs
  now to <i>all mankind</i> and cannot be treated any longer in a multitude of
  separate unequal parcels. We cannot tolerate that small communities of people
  should squat on this or that region of natural resources, claim sovereignty
  over it, and drive a bargain with the rest of the world, any more than we can
  tolerate the private ownership of land and natural resources. But the League
  of Nations recognizes, intensifies, and does its utmost to preserve the
  conventions of nationalism and the emotions of patriotism. The primary
  objective for those who desire a world-order is the replacement of patriotic
  obsessions by the idea of cosmopolitan duty. Until producers think in terms
  of world production and distribution in terms of world transport, until the
  organization and restraint of force is thought of as one simple world-wide
  scheme, there cannot be any organic unity in a World Pax. It will continue to
  be like one of those long carnival dragons, in which a number of men, on
  their separate legs, walk under a cloth with a cardboard head.</p>

  <p>The second bad analogy contributing to the political futility of the times
  is the assumption that the political organization of the contemporary
  combatant state can be paralleled and imitated in any world organization.
  This fallacy is Steele's <i>bête noire.</i> Here I find him running into what
  is very much Lenin's line of thought about the "State." The State, so far as
  it is the organization of power in the world, will tend to disappear. As
  Steele sees it, a great economic directorate, a great research, informative
  and educational system, a hygienic directorate, all three working upon a
  common scientific conception of the common interest, will co-operate in the
  co-ordination of human activities, and so the control and application of
  force will be less and less necessary. The existing state organizations are
  primarily force organizations. They will "fade out" as the world federal
  organizations work more and more efficiently. The combative, litigious, and
  bargaining activities of men will diminish as their productive and creative
  activities develop.</p>

  <p>It is through their failure to grasp this essential change in the
  structure of the community that people evolve visions of a World President,
  World Senates, and World Assemblies engaging in debates upon "policies" and
  playing the ancient game of parties and sections upon a mightier scale. But
  it is almost impossible to imagine any such single political government
  arising except through the practical conquest of existing states; it would be
  a super-state imposed by one or more of them upon the rest. But the organized
  world community must arise by the essentially different and ultimately far
  less difficult process of federal delegation.</p>

  <p>Nine-tenths even of our most passionate peacemakers have no rational idea
  and will not grasp the need for a clear rational idea, of the way to peace.
  "You cannot make peace," writes Steele, "by <i>mooing like cows</i> at
  passing soldiers. Making perpetual peace is a huge, heavy, complex,
  distressful piece of mental engineering."</p>

  <p>The mental trouble which frustrates the disposition toward World Peace is
  not, Steele points out, merely one of logical fallacies. Beneath in the
  subconscious there are deep and powerful antagonisms to the pacification of
  the world. The story of Man is the story of an excessively pugnacious ape
  being slowly tamed. Man is a suspicious and fearful creature and easily
  aroused to fight what he distrusts and fears. In the face of every new
  necessity he struggles with an irrational antagonism to novelty. Treaties,
  laws, and every limitation of his freedom to act spasmodically move him
  toward a sort of claustrophobia. The thought of being tied up drives him
  frantic. And there is considerable justification for this distrust of his. We
  are treacherous to one another, and our fabric of social order rests on
  profoundly untrustworthy supports. We are afraid of one another&mdash;and
  with reason. This fearing, snapping animal is being made into a civilized
  creature slowly enough by the measure of an individual life, but with
  incredible rapidity by the biological scale of time.</p>

  <p>The tension of the effort to lift up the whole mind and will "above the
  plane of instinctive personal mortality, to a rationalized immortal
  universalism of creation," is immense. This is why there is so much snarling,
  bickering, and suspicion among those who are setting themselves sincerely to
  shape their general conduct in the form of human service. The wider you
  stretch your moral energy the thinner it becomes. The intolerance and general
  bad manners of the Communists are proverbial. The lives of most strenuous,
  honest, wide-thinking men arc shot with a snarling jealousy. The naïve
  disciple is puzzled and misled by these almost inevitable ignobilities on the
  part of his prophets and exemplars.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, those who have abandoned or never made any attempt to
  suppress the combative forms of patriotism, xenophobia, and racial
  self-righteousness, who are guided, therefore, and protected on every hand by
  recognized conventions, may escape these stresses. Thackeray's Colonel
  Newcome is an immortal revelation of the moral charmingness and richness that
  accompany such fundamental stupidity. The ultimate result of these
  conventional conformities is futility and disaster, but meanwhile they
  sustain a lot of consistent emotional living and extract a dignified, if
  sentimental, simplicity from the incoherent imperatives and loyalties of
  their unanalyzed purposes.</p>

  <p>Finally Steele takes up the still very large moiety of human beings who
  definitely like war, know they like war, want it and seek it. They are people
  of "coarse excitability." They experience an agreeable thrill in bristling up
  to a challenge. Their blood quickens as conflict approaches them. The sense
  of militant assertion is very pleasant to them. A child with a drum can be
  seen working itself up to a mood of this sort. Everyone has a certain fear of
  war or any sort of combat; but in recruits and soldiers going into battle one
  can see plainly that they are screwing themselves up to the fight as many
  people screw themselves up to swim in cold water&mdash;because they feel that
  it is good for them and because there is an unprecedented intensity of
  reaction in it that they feel they will presently like. They are convinced
  they will regret it if they shirk. This orgiastic aspect of warfare appeals
  to nearly all of us, and until we learn to live as strenuously and
  dangerously in times of peace it will continue to attract. People do not like
  the risk of being killed in battle but still less do they like stagnant
  living. There are urgencies in them more powerful than fear.</p>

  <p>Pacifism will continue to be frustrated until there comes such a dream of
  peace as will stir men like a trumpet. The human imagination throughout the
  world has to be so educated that war will be seen as a dreary diversion of
  energy from excitements more splendid and satisfying. War is not what it was,
  and mankind does not understand this yet. Its triumphs have evaporated; its
  heroisms disappear. It is a perversion, a slacker's resort, clumsy, violent,
  and fruitless, humanity's self-abuse. The terrible hero-warrior of old-world
  imagination becomes a dangerous and dirty sadist with a gas mask on his face
  and poison in his fist. When that is seen dearly, then and then only will the
  peace of the world be secure.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">I find something at once heroic and faintly absurd in the
  big volume in which Steele attempts to develop a summary, complete enough to
  allow us to make directive conclusions, out of the vast mass of human
  thinking, theorizing, and experimenting about what he calls "Property-Money
  Conventions."</p>

  <p>One thing I find particularly good and clear in this valiant
  effort&mdash;at times it is like a single cow trying to turn a thousand
  haystacks and a continent of grassland into milk&mdash;is Steele's rejection
  of all legalistic and historical accounts of money. However it came about,
  money is now part of the mechanism which deflects individual desire and
  effort into the economic service of the community. He says in one place,
  "There never was nor is a Social Contract, and yet it is quite the best form
  in which to <i>deal</i> with endless relationships. And equally there never
  was nor is a systematic social-economic machine, and yet we have in effect a
  social-economic machine, and we can bring all our laws and arrangements about
  ownership, production, and distribution to the test of its operative
  efficiency."</p>

  <p>The only natural things underlying the mechanism of property are greed and
  respect for our fellows. On these a vast intricate fluctuating system of
  conventions has been built, entirely artificial and entirely amenable to
  modification. And in his titanically conceived ninth volume Steele attempts
  to get together and bring into comparison every usage and every idea about
  ownership, accounting, and monetary symbols that can be found in operation or
  under consideration in the world.</p>

  <p>As I turn over these pages, I realize with astonishment what immense
  wildernesses for inquiry and primary scientific examination about social
  economic science remain still practically untouched. In the whole world there
  are only a few score of almost isolated workers nibbling at this
  encyclopaedic, this cosmic investigation. And so it was inevitable that this
  volume nine, for all its copiousness and Steele's magnificent efforts to
  achieve a sort of digest, should at times become a mere prospectus of
  questions, an agenda for non-existent literature, a series of tadpole chapter
  headings, heads with mere motive tails.</p>

  <p>"Irresponsible Ownership, Responsible Ownership&mdash;<i>responsible to
  whom?"</i> is one of these. This reopens his indictment of Socialism on the
  one hand, and on the other leads to a sketchy but suggestive assembly and
  classification of all the different kinds of things that can in any way be
  owned. It is a classified inventory of human resources. He considers
  substances; he considers matter in motion such as rivers; he considers
  territorial control; he considers substances in a position to yield energy.
  He considers things that "excite and gratify." Naturally he wanders into some
  thorny and trackless regions, gets lost, and jumps back to start afresh. He
  tries to take up his material successively from three different directions of
  approach. He defines the nature of each sort of property and explains how
  that nature conditions its use. Then he sorts out his economic material
  according to the use of each sort of property, its function, that is to say,
  in the totality of human activities. And finally he discusses the necessary
  constitution of the "owning will," individual or collective&mdash;the
  merchant adventurers, joint stock company, public department, or what not
  that must direct and operate&mdash;if the possible function of any natural
  material or natural force is to be fully realized.</p>

  <p>Certain tendencies that have been emerging throughout Steele's previous
  volumes become much plainer to himself and to his readers in this ninth bale.
  Someone has written of Steele as a "sample modern mind" trying to make head
  and tail of the contemporary drive in things. Steele would have said that it
  was the duty of every living brain to make the same attempt that he was
  making. It is an impossibly intricate task for an isolated mind, but it is
  not at all an impossibly intricate task if there is an organization of minds.
  If many with a certain community of spirit attempt it they must fall into
  co-operation and all the possibilities will alter. A guideless man or a man
  pestered by false and interested guides might easily be lost in the streets
  of London or the byways of Europe, but not a man with good maps and time
  tables. Competent economic charting is a primary need for civilization, and
  the increase in individual power due to competent charting seems incalculably
  great.</p>

  <p>Steele knows quite clearly that his survey of property-money is about as
  useful a guide for behavior as those pathetic maps of the world which existed
  before the sixteenth century would have been as guides for world planning.
  But the general lay-out of <i>his</i> Survey is interesting. His threefold
  method of approach produces what are practically three parallel surveys.</p>

  <p>The first is a sketch of economic geography. He ranges all over the world
  and probes as far into the crust as he can. "This," he says in effect, "is
  the human estate. Why do we make so poor a use of it? Here are resources
  undeveloped. Here are resources wasted. Why?" He leaves his answer open, but
  the open ends often point in very definite directions.</p>

  <p>The second survey is taken from the consumer's end. Here are needs and
  appetites going unsatisfied. Why? He makes big vague gestures toward an
  estimate for a world properly clothed, fed, and sheltered. It is not his
  fault that his estimates are mere wild guesses. There is no absolute reason
  why such estimates should not be precise. A standard of life, given a
  quantitative knowledge of what is at present mere speculation, could be
  defined.</p>

  <p>The third limb of his survey arises out of the former two. It is really
  the project of an immense essay on&mdash;to use his own
  phrase&mdash;"Ownership, Wages, and Other Claims." It is a demand for a
  science upon which law and morality in relation to property and money can be
  rebuilt. This science would be essentially a branch of psychology, and he
  invades one stormy region of controversy after another with an unfaltering
  temerity. I think perhaps the most interesting thing for the general reader
  will be what he calls his Three Theses. They run as follows:</p>

  <p><i>First:</i> that whatever the origins of the ideas and practices of
  ownership may be, ownership is now made, protected, and enforced by the laws
  of society; and there is no reason whatever except the collective welfare why
  any sort of ownership or any particular ownership should be enforced or
  permitted. This is plainly the sole basis for all modern law affecting
  property throughout the world.</p>

  <p><i>Second:</i> that whatever the distribution of sovereignties may have
  been in the past, All Mankind is now the ultimate owner of the natural
  resources of the planet, earth, sky, and sea; and that, failing for the
  present a complete general direction for the exploitation of these
  resources&mdash;which general direction will in time arrive not by any
  usurpation of power but by the natural development of scientific
  imperatives&mdash;all current sovereignties and ownerships must be regarded
  as provisional, and those who have them must be regarded as caretakers of
  treasure-trove and navigators of derelicts, all responsible to a final
  accounting. The criterion by which all the conditions of their ownership must
  be valued is the extent to which these conditions fall in with and exploit
  the primitive human impulses so as to subserve the human commonweal.</p>

  <p>Property is the <i>quid pro quo</i> by which the man of spirit surrenders
  to collective living and it is the common guarantee against intolerable
  usurpation. Men without sovereignty, ownership, or freedom&mdash;or the pride
  that comes with these things&mdash;are incurably careless with the goods of
  this world and spiritless in production. For that reason property must
  continue to exist. But property must be "kinetic." It must never "congeal."
  Modern property in land or any sort of natural resources can be at most only
  a "stimulating responsible leasehold."</p>

  <p><i>Third:</i> "money exists to pay wages." Steele argues that the whole
  economic machine is essentially a process of work; that it can be presented
  as a spectacle of work; that the worker's instinct to render unrewarded
  services is practically negligible and that it is money that "works the
  worker." Payment in kind means servitude, but payment in money is liberty of
  choice. The expectation of security and of satisfactions upholds the worker
  through the less interesting parts of his task and justifies the parts that
  are interesting. Work done justifies not only immediate pay, but pensions,
  retirement pay, Ieisure, and independence. The whole monetary system is to be
  judged by the test whether the money put into the hands of the worker on
  payday satisfies his expectations and keeps its promises. The money system
  has to be worked out to a final simplicity in which you will draw your pay as
  you earn it, keep it by you, bother no more about it, and be sure it will
  neither lose nor gain in "purchasing power" until you spend it.</p>

  <p>This ultimate simplification of money so that a note or coin means the
  same thing all over the world is, Steele asserts, the plain objective of
  every constructive economist. Anything but a world currency becomes an
  anachronism. And from this third and last thesis he launches out into another
  big volume of concentrated encyclopaedism, a sketch of the history of
  trading, accounting, and money from their beginnings up to now. He tries to
  find the social advantages of each new development and then, under each new
  development, he makes a section devoted to what he calls its
  "corruptions."</p>

  <p>This, I think, is a novel and useful way of attacking the problems of
  economic life as a series of inaccurate processes liable not only to willful
  but to unintentional abuse. Steele discusses usury and interest entirely from
  the point of view of whether they are biologically advantageous. They are the
  profits of uncertainty; they dwindle in a world of quantitative knowledge.
  They are clumsy expedients for getting leave to produce or for tiding over
  unforeseen phases of consumption in a tangled and restricted state of
  affairs. In the clearer-headed world ahead they will have practically
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>He is particularly intent upon the way in <i>which</i> the "arithmetical
  unrestrictedness" of money lent itself to the development of debt. Before
  money a man could pledge only his actual possessions; with the onset of money
  he could incur liabilities far beyond anything he possessed. Steele
  accumulates a mass of data about speculative operations.</p>

  <p>He believes that monetary manipulation has become increasingly vexatious
  in trade policy and foreign policy. It has interwoven with the felted
  corruptions of tariffs and trade restrictions. Steele calls all this the
  perversion of money, but then he hits out the remark, "Money is a born
  pervert. We have to cure a congenital disease here." The more men know of
  monetary complications the easier is it to reap personal advantages, and the
  more disingenuous becomes the attitude of the expert. The less men know the
  less able they are to deal with the business. This monetary science is "a
  corrupting science," says Steele, and its practitioners should "work with
  rubber gloves." The conflict of expertise with disinterestedness is the
  paradox of scientific finance.</p>

  <p>In some parts of this ninth volume Steele becomes almost as pessimistic as
  Burton. Burton thought Man was mad for ever more; Steele comes very near
  admitting that Man is incurably a shortsighted, cheating, self-frustrated
  fool.</p>

  <p>There is a cheat in every shadow, fraud lurks in every inexplicit word in
  an agreement. The paint on our new institutions is dirty before it is dry. We
  cannot ignore this tendency to <i>fester</i> in every human convention and
  arrangement. In detail and continually, the infections, the new dodge, the
  fresh interceptions have to be diagnosed and dealt with. But this is a reason
  for strenuous effort and not for despair. The complications are multitudinous
  but not more multitudinous than the business of the world; the corruptions
  are intricate but not beyond the compass of the human mind. Economic life can
  be simplified only if it is "drenched in light and kept incandescent with
  good intentions."</p>

  <p>And its simplification to real efficiency must be a complicated incessant
  business of adjustment. "Revolution" is no final remedy for economic
  frustration except in so far as it may clear away some very close-knit system
  of abuses. Revolution means a new beginning, with new naïve principles, all
  void of immunity and ready to be corrupted. It carries with it a strategic
  necessity, usually exaggerated, for the suppression of criticism as
  opposition. The inquiring visitor can trace the development of a whole system
  of new corruptions in Russia, terrorism, wangling, exploitation of mass
  sentimentality, unscrupulously defensive privilege, beneath the dark cloak of
  doctrinaire intolerance.</p>

  <p>Escape from economic frustration depends upon a mighty intellectual
  effort, argues Steele. It will have to be an effort as extensive as a world
  war and far more prolonged. Upon the organization and co-ordination of
  thousands of students and men of experience, discussing and publishing
  freely, helping and stimulating one another, depends the possibility of an
  advance into enduring plenty. And at present there is nothing in the wide
  world to represent the vital science needed but a few scattered professors
  and specialists working with negligible resources and the disconnectedness of
  amateurs.</p>

  <p>Are we to despair because of the unprecedented greatness and complexity of
  the work to be done?</p>

  <p>Take hope from the story of flying, says Steele. For two thousand years
  and more men dreamed of flying and sought to fly. But for a wearisome
  sequence of centuries they never got a step forward. Now one man constructed
  his machine and jumped and flopped and now another; the general wisdom
  remained quite sure that flying was forever denied to man.</p>

  <p>Then in scarcely a dozen years the problem of flying was solved. By whom?
  You do not know, for the simple <i>reason that</i> it was done by a multitude
  of men working in correlation. So and so flew quite early and so and so and
  so and so; but hundreds of contemporary brains had contributed even to the
  earliest machine that rose from the ground. It was not an inventor but a
  science that took men into the air.</p>

  <p>In economic science there is still nothing but doctrinaires. In his
  library, Steele says, he has several thousand books of monetary and general
  economic theory. <i>It is rare that any of these writers refer to one
  another; still rarer to find the slightest attempt to understand, respond, or
  summarize.</i> It is less like science than the gabble of geese on a common.
  "Three thousand years of isolated dreamers and still no man could fly a yard.
  A few years of free co-operation, of correlated, well-reported experiments
  and free discussion, and Man could fly round his world. So likewise will it
  be with the attainment of world plenty," writes Steele, and ties up his
  economic bale with these words, quite hopefully pointing our hopes for
  material welfare to the busy skies.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">Steele's tenth book deals with the current disorder of our
  education. Here again we catch him at his old trick of making highly
  controversial statements as though they were obvious truths. His belief that
  what Steele thinks to-day the world will think to-morrow never fails him.</p>

  <p>In its normal sense education is "what adults tell, reveal, or betray to
  the next generation." It is the necessary completion of man as a social
  animal. He cannot exist without it. There is no abstract uneducated man. Even
  a jungle wolf-boy is educated to a view and way of life&mdash;by wolves.</p>

  <p>Normally hitherto when men had no perspectives in time and conceived of
  their institutions as permanent, education has been retrospective and
  conservative. The young received the wisdom of their fathers and were told
  exactly what was expected of them. Then they were "grown up" and ceased all
  further learning. The existing educational methods of the world were evolved
  in that spirit, and schools and colleges are to this day conducted mainly to
  put hack the new generation where its parents began.</p>

  <p>It is quite a new way of looking at the aim of education to consider it
  not as an exposition of institutions but of objectives. Instead of teaching
  youth where it stands, you have to show it whither it may be going. You have
  to train it not for conformity but for a permanent revolution. And the
  teacher must go with it&mdash;adult no longer, a learner still, pupil-teacher
  at the best.</p>

  <p>Education expands enormously in scope and importance as we face about
  toward our incessantly progressive future. It ceases to be the mere framing
  of adolescence. We are all adolescents nowadays and the only finished adults
  are the dead, interred or uninterred. The citizen of the new world must be
  kept informed throughout his life. Education becomes an all-life affair. It
  ceases to be final in its form. It ceases to have "classics." It would as
  soon return to creeds and catechisms. It broadens out to embrace research and
  fresh thought&mdash;all research and all fresh thought however recondite. "I
  cannot find any point," says Steele, "at which I can draw the line between
  research however specialized and poetic expression however precious, and the
  general educational process of mankind." The highest springs and the remotest
  creeks are all in touch with the ocean. The education of youth now should be
  not a completion but an introduction, or, to put it in another way, modernity
  prolongs adolescence and mental adaptation to the last active phase of a
  lifetime. "Finishing School for Young Ladies," "Graduation," and university
  "Final Schools" jar almost equally on Steele's ear.</p>

  <p>And having thus expanded Education and turned it round so that we all find
  ourselves back at school again, Steele sets about another of his loose
  experimental surveys and commentaries, this time of all the existing schools,
  colleges, churches, theaters, shows, lecture halls, conferences, books,
  periodicals, propagandas by which mankind is continually educating,
  re-educating, and mis-educating itself. It almost goes without saying that he
  finds the totality altogether inadequate and unsuited to the present needs
  and opportunities of our race.</p>

  <p>"Does one teacher in a hundred ever ask himself what he imagines he is
  doing to the learner and the world?"</p>

  <p>This educational survey becomes for a time an onslaught on dons and
  teachers. In every generation the more vivid young go out to the activities
  of general life, to business, politics, adventure. But the good timid boys
  and girls who have clambered obediently from prize to scholarship, learning
  all that is respectable and nothing that is new, sit enthroned as teachers in
  the classrooms and cloisters, trying not to hear the world go by outside.</p>

  <p>They teach about the past, but they never learn to connect it with the
  vulgar intimidating present. There is a gap of decades between them and now.
  They learn Ianguages with a meticulous precision but never how to use them
  with vigor. The deader the language, the better it is for teaching and
  examination purposes. They stylize mathematics to complete inutility. They
  chant or mumble or sentimentalize or do a reverent hush, do anything but talk
  straight, when the growing soul wants to know what life is for, what its
  passions are for. The Ancient Books, which we none of us believe in any more,
  are read sententiously. "Controversial matters"&mdash;that is to say every
  living reality that will flush the cheek and brighten the eye with mental
  excitement&mdash;are excluded from these institutions for damping off the
  young.</p>

  <p>"We are frustrated by original sin, by fear, pugnacity, cupidity,
  dishonesty," writes Steele, his pen almost crying aloud, "but most of all we
  are frustrated by this damned flattening flatness of our schools. If youth
  did not naturally dislike its tutors and teachers and react against them,
  there would be little hope for any Next Beginning." But most of that revolt
  against the teacher spends itself in futile lawlessness, and it is a mere
  remnant of vigorous and persistent minds that carries on the effort of racial
  adjustment in the new generation. And so on <i>da capo.</i></p>

  <p>Steele has little to say about kindergarten and physical development,
  training of eye and hand and mental exercise. He seems to consider that that
  sort of thing can be done well, is being done well in many schools, could be
  done well in all; and it does not concern him immediately. It is only as the
  imagination develops in boyhood, girlhood, and early adolescence that the
  inefficiency of contemporary education becomes patent. "Nothing is more
  amazing," he writes, "than the charm, the alert intelligence, the fearless
  freedom, the cared-for mind and body of the ordinary modern child of six or
  seven, and the slouching mental futility of the ordinary youth in the later
  teens."</p>

  <p>What have they had fed to them to be mentally so ill-grown? Steele made
  several scrapbooks of extracts and cuttings of schoolmasters' utterances and
  well-authenticated speeches made to schoolboys and schoolgirls, of books
  supposed to be "good" for the young, gems of history teaching, school library
  lists, cases of censorship, disciplinary cases. From the age of twelve or
  thirteen onward modern education rots and fades out; it is invaded by
  antiquated pedantries, suppressions and palpable bunk. The ranks of the
  youthful advance are broken. In nearly every country in the world to-day, the
  young people between the ages of fifteen and twenty are as a whole a
  demoralized and aimless crowd.</p>

  <p>Anyone who wants to make the best of it, says Steele, may argue that this
  is slack water between two tides. But in truth, though the ebb is manifest,
  there is no sign of any rising spirit. The prospect before the younger boys
  and girls is just as flat and uninspiring. And until we can raise a great
  wind of Educational Revivalism things will stay as they are.</p>

  <p>It is amusing to read Steele as he tries to be broadminded and patient and
  confident in the necessity of progress, while all the time he is fretting
  against his facts. His was an energetic and urgent nature and up to his very
  last utterance, which I shall give in its place, he was praying in vain for
  the unshaken deliberation of <i>a</i> true scientific man, so that he should
  work "without haste and without delay." The situation is like trench warfare,
  he says, and the clue to victory is how and where to pierce the enemy front.
  He has no hope of penetrating our line of ordinary schools and colleges.
  Everything in them makes for routine and conservation. There is much more
  hope for a mental thrust through journalism, through preaching and lecturing,
  through the provision of reading for the baffled and inquiring adolescent,
  through a great variety of progressive books.</p>

  <p>To break through in these ways is to outflank school and college and to
  prepare a later attack upon them from a more advantageous angle. Literature,
  science, political propaganda must all contribute to the pressure that will
  ultimately make over education from its present traditionalism to a
  creatively revolutionary equipment of the young. In the end that may mean the
  disappearance of the very forms of contemporary education, of schoolrooms,
  lecture halls, and almost every process that is considered to be teaching
  to-day. All that system derives from the technical training of mediaeval
  priests and monks. That is why there is so much "verbal" memory work in it,
  why it glorifies "scholarship," its flower, and why it is so cursed with
  examinations.</p>

  <p>In all this the hope is plainly father to the thought. In passage after
  passage Steele's dismay at the unteachableness of schoolmasters and the
  rigidities of the scholastic organization&mdash;the strait waistcoat of the
  school, he calls it&mdash;breaks through. The new education needs a new sort
  of teacher altogether. But Steele has left very few notes to indicate what
  that new sort of teacher will be. I am inclined to think he would have a sort
  of medical-psychologist acting as joint supervisor with the parents over the
  children's development. He would arrange for elementary teaching which would
  be done in nursery schools very much as it is done to-day. After that, by
  eleven or twelve say, there would be a distribution of children according to
  their aptitudes. Thereafter very largely they would "learn by doing."
  Adolescent education would be somewhat in the nature of apprenticeship.</p>

  <p>Steele becomes much more detailed and manifestly surer of himself when be
  comes to what he calls the "informative side" of education. Instead of
  something that is being done most desperately wrong, he is considering
  something that is not being done at all; he has a clear field, and his
  aggressive buoyancy comes against no proved discouragement. He attaches
  extraordinary importance to the production of a "World Encyclopaedia." It
  seems to him that it is the most urgent need of our time. The main
  intellectual task of education is to put before the expanding mind everything
  that is clearly known about the nature of the world in which it finds itself,
  every significant thing in the problems it has to face, the essential issues
  under consideration, the direction of collective effort. Every mind in the
  world needs the framework of this common inheritance of knowledge, and the
  means of filling in whatever parts of the framework most concern it. Every
  mind needs to be posted in any essential extensions of knowledge or changes
  in general ideas.</p>

  <p>To meet these ends he projects a sort of human memory, a central brain, an
  organization for the accumulation, concentration, sifting out, digestion, and
  rendering of knowledge; it is every museum, library, scientific society, poet
  and thinker and active intelligence brought into correlation. It is a
  synthesis of summaries. It is the <i>New Atlantis</i> on a twentieth-century
  instead of an Elizabethan scale.</p>

  <p>He demands "scores of millions of pounds" for this central Encyclopaedia,
  "expenditure on the scale of war preparation," and the participation of
  hundreds of thousands of workers. And from this ever-living and growing and
  clarifying central and fundamental Encyclopaedia there must be a continual
  production and renewal up to date of outlines and condensations of its
  purport and content. These are to be used for college and secondary study and
  for general reference, and from these again a series of introductions and
  primers are to be made. So we shaII get at last for our whole world community
  a "common basis of knowledge and general ideas" upon which an infinite
  variety of special interests can flourish harmoniously together.</p>

  <p>In the glow of this project Steele manages to forget altogether the parade
  of donnish and scholastic drearies, the barricades of schoolbooks, texts,
  examinations with which he has dealt so faithfully. "And so with its accounts
  rendered and its knowledge and aims clearly stated," he writes, "the human
  community may at last dare to Iook its children in the face and give them,
  before they set themselves in good earnest to play their part in it, some
  chance of knowing what it thinks it is about."</p>
