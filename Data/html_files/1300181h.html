<p>PRODUCTION NOTES:</p>
<p>This report has been prepared using OCR. In addition to the
nine "chapter" headings (including two "Chapter VI."s, the
numbering of which has been retained), John Thomas Bigge made
numerous marginal notes, here inserted at the beginning of the
paragraph to which they relate, terminated with an open bracket
(]); these may be of some use to the reader. Bigge's idiosyncratic
spellings, notably "Macquarrie", "Van Dieman" and "Paramatta",
are retained throughout.</p>
<p>The only changes to the text have been some modernisation of
the punctuation.</p>
<p>To give the Report context, two items&mdash;Bigge's
Instructions and Macquarie's Response to the report&mdash;have
been included as Addenda. They are both taken from "Historical
Records of Australia", Series 1, Volume <i>X</i>, published by
the Library Committee Of The Commonwealth Parliament, 1917. Bigge
refers often to an Appendix; this may not be the one located
at the end of the Report, but sometimes rather a full series of
documents which has never been printed in full. Parts only of
this Appendix may be found in "Historical Records of Australia",
Series 3, Volume III, pp. 215-922 (concerning Van Diemen's Land)
and in Series 4, Volume I, pp. 755-882.</p>
<p>In addition to Macquarie's Response in Addendum B., he
defended himself in a pamphlet published in 1821 and in another
letter to Earl Bathurst, dated October 1823.</p>
<p>At the end of each Addendum may be found linked notes.</p>

<br>
of New South Wales.</b></p>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<p>   MY LORD,</p>
<p>BEFORE I proceed to lay before your Lordship a statement of
the manner in which the Convicts are employed and managed in the
settlements of New South Wales and Van Dieman's Land, I have
thought it expedient to preface such a statement with a few
observations upon the transportation and treatment of them during
the passage, as it is now conducted; upon the manner in which
their disembarkation is effected; and the general circumstances
that attend their introduction to the scenes of their future
servitude and punishment.</p>
<br>
<a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>
<h3>I.<br>
<br>
<i>Condition and Treatment of Convicts during the passage to New
South Wales</i>.</h3>
<p><small>THE</small> transportation of convicts, as far as it
regards their health, appears to have undergone very considerable
improvement since the mortality that occurred in the ships
General Hewit, Surrey, and Three Bees, in the year 1814.</p>
<p>The investigation that took place at Sydney, at that period,
into the conduct of the masters of those vessels, and the report
made to Governor Macquarrie by Mr. Redfern the assistant-surgeon
on the colonial establishment, have furnished to His Majesty's
government ample and very accurate means of providing against the
recurrence of similar calamities.</p>
<p>The recommendations that were made by Mr. Redfern, under the
several heads of clothing, diet, air, and medical assistance,
appear, in as far as they have been adopted, to have been amply
justified, by the diminished mortality in the voyages performed
by convict ships from England to New South Wales; and of those
that have not yet been adopted, there appears only to be one that
is of material importance.</p>
<p>It has been truly observed by this gentleman, that in the
voyages that are commenced in the later periods of the European
winters, or the commencement of spring, and which terminate with
the same seasons in New South Wales and in Van Dieman's Land, or
the latitudes in which the latter part of the voyages are most
frequently made, the convicts are exposed to great and sudden
vicissitudes of climate; the greatest and most prejudicial being
found to be that which occurs in the first removal of the
convicts from the hulks to the transports in cold seasons, and
when dressed in much lighter clothing than that to which they
have been previously accustomed. The change of climate, likewise,
that occurs after passing the Cape of Good Hope, in the 40th
degree of south latitude, from the months of May and June to the
months of September and October, requires greater warmth of
clothing than that which can be afforded by the present allowance
and by indisposing the convicts to be as much upon deck as
before, is the cause of obstructing the ventilation of the
prison.</p>
<p>As a remedy for this evil, Mr. Redfern has suggested, that for
convicts who are exposed to it, there should be provided woollen,
instead of duck trowsers, together with flannel drawers and
waistcoats.</p>
<p><a name="ch-02" id=
"ch-02"></a><b><small>CLOTHING.]</small></b></p>
<p>Upon this recommendation, I would observe, and to meet the
objection that Mr. Redfern has anticipated of the greater danger
of contagion, and of the want of cleanliness from the use of
woollen, rather than of linen clothing, that cloth or woollen
trowsers and shirts are constantly worn by sailors in warm
climates, and that with a view to secure the principal objects of
additional warmth and cleanliness, two pair of flannel drawers to
each convict, to be worn with the duck trowsers, might be
advantageously substituted for the additional woollen trowsers
that he has proposed.</p>
<p><a name="ch-03" id=
"ch-03"></a><b><small>FOOD.]</small></b></p>
<p>It seems to be generally admitted, that the allowance of food
provided by the present scheme of victualling, is amply
sufficient during the voyage; and the only evil, against which it
is necessary now to provide, is the abstraction of any portion of
the quantity allowed, or the substitution, that is not
unfrequently attempted, of the good provisions found by
government, for those of inferior quality, with which the
transport ships, either through the avarice of their owners, or
the fraud of their agents, are sometimes supplied.</p>
<p>An important check upon this abuse has been afforded by that
article of the instructions to the surgeon superintendent, by
which he is directed to attend the opening of every cask, of
provisions, and to note it in his journal. It would appear,
however, from the evidence of the principal superintendent of
convicts, William Hutchinson, that complaints are most frequent
from them, respecting the short issues of provisions during the
voyage, and that the captains of the transport ships, on
approaching the port of destination, are in the habit of making
compromises with the convicts, in money, to the amount of the
quantity kept back. This appears to have taken place on board the
Daphne convict ship, and was considered by the magistrates, to
whom the complaint of the convicts was referred, as sufficient
ground for dismissing it.</p>
<p>The practice also observed by the captains of convict ships,
and permitted by the commissariat officers, of receiving back,
from the remains of provisions and stores delivered at Sydney,
the allowance of eighths for issuing them, seems to have admitted
great opportunity, as well is temptation, for a fraudulent
abduction of the government provisions.</p>
<p>This practice has now been checked by a particular instruction
from the Navy Board, by which the captains of transport ships are
expressly prohibited from making or receiving such deduction; and
the allowance of eighths is only made when they pass their
accounts to the satisfaction of the Victualling Board in London.
As a further check, however, upon any fraudulent change in the
issue of provisions that may escape the attention of the surgeon
superintendent, it will be found useful to establish a
regulation, that one person from each of the messes, into which
the convicts are distributed, should be required to attend in
rotation at the delivery and weighing of the provisions. In some
of the transports this duty has been confined to one and the same
individual of the mess throughout the whole voyage; but as it is
obvious that the chances of successful corruption or imposition
are less when tried with many than with few, the daily change in
the delegation of individuals from the mess is much to be
preferred to the other mode, and is not found to be attended with
any inconvenience.</p>
<p><a name="ch-04" id="ch-04"></a><b><small>PREVENTION OF
PLUNDER.]</small></b></p>
<p>The complaints, however, of the convicts are not entirely
confined to a subtraction of the proper allowance of their
provisions. It frequently happens that various articles of store,
or of wearing apparel furnished by their friends on leaving
England, are put on board the ships for the convicts, and
according to the evidence of William Hutchinson, the
superintendent, they have not been always punctually delivered;
and in some cases they have been damaged, or their contents
purloined and appropriated by the sailors.</p>
<p>The communication that necessarily takes place between the
convicts and the sailors during the passage, and the disposition
that is common to both to dissipate their resources for the sake
of some temporary enjoyment, to indulge their passion for
gambling, or excite it in others, will render the decision of
their complaints very difficult to the magistrates at Sydney.</p>
<p>It is not desirable, generally, that the convicts should
arrive in New South Wales with money or the means of procuring
it; and it is still less desirable that their possession of it
should be known, except to the surgeon superintendent, the
captain and mate of the ship. But in order to prevent the feeling
of disappointment or exasperation that the loss of their property
must occasion, and to diminish the temptations to gamble for it
during the voyage, it would be advisable that a list of all
packages allowed to be put on for the convicts should be made out
and attested by the captain and mate of each vessel previous to
sailing; that they should be kept in a separate and secure place
during the passage; and that the captain and mate should be held
responsible for their delivery on the arrival of the ship, at
Sydney. This arrangement would doubtless exclude access to the
packages during the voyage, and interfere perhaps with the object
of sending them on board; but to this it is a sufficient answer,
that the possession of property leads only to thefts, and
consequently to augmented punishment; and that the encumbrance of
packages in the prison deck, if left in the ion of the convicts
themselves, would be a great obstruction to ventilation and
cleanliness.</p>
<p><a name="ch-05" id=
"ch-05"></a><b><small>VENTILATION.]</small></b></p>
<p>The instructions furnished by the Navy Board to the surgeon
superintendent, do not specify the frequent admission of the
convicts on deck, as an important means of preserving their
health; but as the instructions furnished to the master require
him to comply with the applications of the surgeon for that as
well as other purposes beneficial to the convicts, it was,
doubtless, intended to leave a discretion to be exercised by the
surgeons, as well in regulating the frequency of their access to
the deck, as to their numbers at one and the same time. The
exercise of this discretion depends of course upon the state of
the weather and the capacity of the deck, but it likewise depends
upon the experience of the surgeon superintendent, and the degree
of confidence that this experience may lead him to place in the
character of the convicts. It accordingly happens, that those
surgeons and masters to whom this particular service is new, will
not allow more than one half of the prisoners to remain on deck
at one time, and will not take off their irons till an advanced
period of the voyage: others, on the contrary, allow as many of
them as please to come upon deck, and encourage them to remain
there as long as they do not interfere with the operations of the
ship, and frequently take off their irons, or a part of them, in
a fortnight after leaving England.</p>
<p>The advantages arising from allowing the convicts a free
access to the deck, in giving effectual ventilation to the
prisons, and in preserving their health, are justly and strongly
described by Mr. Redfern in his report to Governor Macquarrie;
and these advantages, and the feelings that accompany the
enjoyment of them, are so important in preserving discipline as
well as health during the voyage, that they ought not to be
risked from an unwarrantable distrust of the convict; or from an
apprehension of any combined attempt to obtain possession of the
ship. As the release from the incumbrance of irons is always an
indulgence to the convicts, so is the return to the use of them a
salutary punishment that may supersede the necessity of having
recourse to flogging.</p>
<p>The fear of combinations amongst the convicts to take the
ship, is proved by experience of later years to be groundless;
and it may be safely affirmed, that if the instructions of the
Navy Board are carried into due effect by the surgeon
superintendent and the master, and if the convicts obtain the
full allowance of provisions made to them by government, as well
as reasonable access to the deck, they possess neither fidelity
to each other, nor courage sufficient to make any simultaneous
effort that may not be disconcerted by timely information, and
punished before an act of aggression is committed. A short
acquaintance with the characters of the convicts, promises of
recommendation to the governor on their arrival in New South
Wales, and an ordinary degree of skill in the business of
preventive police, will at all times afford means of procuring
information; and with a view to afford those of more complete
protection against any open violence during the day, when the
convicts are on deck, it is expedient that the ships that are
taken up for this service, should, if possible, be provided with
poops, upon which the military guard may at all times be posted.
They are thus more completely separated from the convicts in the
hours of duty or of exercise and they are sufficiently elevated
above the deck to observe their motions, and if necessary, to
control them.</p>
<p>Although, in the transportation of female convicts to New
South Wales, the preservation of their health has been more
easily and generally accomplished than that of the males, yet no
scheme of superintendence has yet been devised by which their
intercourse with the crew can be entirely prevented. From the
evidence of Mr. Cordeaux, Mr. Gyles, and Mr. Walker, who were
passengers on board the convict ship Friendship, prostitution
appears to have prevailed in a great degree, and the captain and
surgeon at last connived at excesses that they had not the means
to resist, or any hope of suppressing. The account given by Mr.
Gyles, of the proceedings of the voyage, differs very materially
from the testimony of Mr. Cordeaux and Mr. Walker; and the
accounts of all are still more pointedly contradicted by the
evidence of the superintendent Hutchinson, who states that the
female convicts from the ship Friendship declared, on their
arrival at Port Jackson, that they were perfectly satisfied with
the conduct of the captain, a declaration that is further
confirmed by the result of Mr. Secretary Campbell's muster of
them, at the conclusion of which it is stated "that no complaints
were made". The characters likewise given by Mr. Gyles of several
of the female convicts, differ as materially from those that were
given by the master and surgeon superintendent of the Friendship
on their arrival at Port Jackson.</p>
<p>Mr. Gyles has asserted that no precautions were adopted by the
captain or surgeon to prevent an improper intercourse between the
crew and the convicts; and it certainly appears, by the evidence
of Mr. Cordeaux, that the very simple and obvious one of
depositing the keys of the prison in a place of security during
the night, was not resorted to till after a complaint was made at
St. Helena, by the surgeon, to Admiral Plampin. In consequence of
this neglect, a very general intercourse took place between the
crew and the female convicts; and after it had been once
permitted, the captain and the surgeon, though not without a
sense of the advantages that they expected to derive from a
strict performance of their duty, had lost that authority over
their subordinate officers, that might have enabled them to have
enforced some restraint upon the crew; their attempts to restore
it were ineffectual, and, in making them, they were opposed by
the vicious inclinations of the women themselves.</p>
<p><a name="ch-06" id="ch-06"></a><b>Parliamentary Evidence, p.
100.]</b></p>
<p>The conduct of the captain has been censured by Mr. Gyles for
inhumanity, especially in the infliction of punishment; but it
does not appear that in any instance it exceeded the compulsory,
but injudicious, use of a wooden collar. The want of cleanliness
that has been stated by the same person, in his letter to Mr.
Marsden, as the effect of negligence on the part of the captain
and surgeon, is imputed by Mr. Cordeaux to the perverse
dispositions of the women, and the reluctance of the captain to
have recourse to force, by which alone he thinks their
dispositions could have been controlled.</p>
<p>The circumstances that took place on board the female convict
ship Janus, are detailed in the minutes of evidence that were
taken by myself upon the Investigation, ordered by Governor
Macquarrie, of the complaint of two female convicts that had been
assigned to Mr. Bayley. It is to be remarked, that the advanced
state of pregnancy in which these women were found to be previous
to the departure of the captain and mate of the ship from Port
Jackson, occasioned their complaints to be preferred through Mr.
Bayley, their master, to the governor, although, at the muster
that took place on board the ship; no complaint of any kind is
recorded by Mr. Secretary Campbell to have been made to him, nor
was any complaint addressed to any other quarter. From the
evidence, however, it appears, that all the evils that
unrestrained intercourse between the crew of the ship, and a
number of licentious women could produce, existed to their full
extent in the voyage of the Janus from England, during the stay
of the vessel at Rio de Janeiro, and until its arrival at New
South Wales. The death of the surgeon superintendent, on the
passage from Rio de Janeiro to Port Jackson, has necessarily
deprived the inquiry of satisfactory proofs of the attempts made
by him to check the profligacy of the officers and crew; but it
appears that the attempts of the captain were neither sincere nor
effectual. With the knowledge, indeed, that the sailors could not
fail to obtain of his participation, as well as the mate's, in
the same intercourse in which they had so freely indulged, it was
not to be expected that their admonitions, if sincere, could have
been effectual. The captain has denied that his intercourse with
Mary Long was of an improper or immoral kind; but the testimony
of the Rev. Mr. Conolly and Mr. Therry both agree in the
frequency and long duration of the visits of this woman to the
captain's cabin; and it is also to be observed, that he has not
denied the allegation made by her upon oath, of his being the
father of the child with which she was pregnant when the inquiry
took place.</p>
<p>Of the degree of resistance that may be expected to be made,
to all attempts to impose restraint upon the crews of female
convict ships, during their passage from England to New South
Wales, the journal of Dr. Reed, surgeon superintendent of the
ship Morley, may afford some means of forming a judgment. All the
influence both in the captain, surgeon and passengers, that could
be derived from good example, and all the advantages of a most
patient and courageous resistance to the vicious inclinations of
the crew, were not sufficient to prevent them from obtaining
access to some of the women who had yielded to their persuasions.
It is necessary however to observe, that in the fitting of female
convict ships for transportation, a greater degree of attention
seems to have been paid to the comfort of the prisoners, than is
consistent with the prevention of intercourse between them and
the the sailors. There seems to be no reason for not giving the
same degree of strength a greater degree of attention seems to
have been paid to the comfort of the to the stauncheons that
surround the fore and after hatchways, that has been access to
some of the women who had yielded to their persuasions. It is
necessary however to observe, that in the fitting of female
convict ships for transportation, prisoners, than is consistent
with the prevention of intercourse between them and found so
effectual in those of male convict ships; and with this
precaution, there is less to be apprehended from the destruction
or temporary removal of the wooden gratings that cover the
hatchway, or the padlocks by which they are fastened. The most
assailable points of the prison are the two small fore-hatchways
that give light and air to the hospital; and here it is necessary
that the iron gratings should be of the strongest description,
for the descent from them to the hospital is easy, and the
attempts to break through them are, in a great measure, removed,
from the to observation of the officers of the deck.</p>
<p>The apartment for the free women and children should always be
placed between the sailors birth and the prison, and the
partition should be made of exactly the same thickness and
strength as that which separates the same apartments in the male
convict ships.</p>
<p>In taking a review of the circumstances that have attended the
transportation of male and female convicts from England and
Ireland to New South Wales, and the gradual improvement that has
taken place in the system during the last six years, it appears
certain that the voyage may be performed with perfect security to
the health and persons of the convicts. For attaining these
objects nothing more seems necessary than a strict adherence to
the instructions issued by the Navy Board to the surgeons
superintendent, at the commencement and during the progress of
the voyage, and a determination manifested by the proper
authorities in New South Wales to listen to and investigate any
complaints that may be made known to them on its termination.</p>
<p>The course that has been adopted by Governor Macquarrie,
certainly affords opportunities for the convicts to make
complaints; but from the evidence of the superintendent
Hutchinson, they are in many cases not effectual: and it appears,
that if the captain of a transport succeeds in making a pecuniary
compromise with the convicts previous to their arrival in port,
and in silencing them at the muster, the conduct of the master is
altogether withdrawn from judicial investigation, and does not
come to the knowledge of that authority in England that alone has
the power of punishing him, by withholding or making a deduction
from the promised gratuity, or by mulcting the owners of the
vessel in a portion of the freight.</p>
<p>The doctrine that has been held by the magistrates in Sydney
upon this subject, can only apply to the complaints of the
convicts before them; but it is clear, that the pecuniary
satisfaction paid to them for a subduction of the proper quantity
of food by the captain, constitutes no satisfaction to the
government, whose instructions he has violated, and who also, in
ignorance of that violation, may award remuneration instead of
punishment. In the detection of attempts to diminish the quantity
of food allowed by government to the convicts on the passage, the
authorities in New South Wales cannot exercise too much
vigilance. An important control may, however, be beneficially
exercised in England, by the agents of the Navy Board, in seeing,
as well as certifying, that the several articles that are
covenanted to be found by the owners of the transports, are
actually on board before the ships leave their port. To no
article of this description does the observation apply so
materially as to the quantity of water; for its scarcity or its
bad quality (especially when taken in, when the tide is high, in
the river Thames,) furnishes the most specious pretext for
stopping at Rio de Janeiro; and as the consumption of water on
board the female convict ships is greater, generally, than in the
male, and more essential to the preservation of their health, a
larger supply than that of 120 gallons to each person, should be
laid in, even if the supply of animal food should be
diminished.</p>
<p><a name="ch-07" id=
"ch-07"></a><b><small>MEDICINE.]</small></b></p>
<p>The supplies of medicine that are sent for the use of the
convict ships, seem to comprise every article of use, or of
comfort, that can be found necessary; but from the great
accumulation of lime-juice and bark that has taken place in the
Sydney hospital, it would appear that larger quantities of these
medicines are supplied than the experience of several years seems
to require; and that, on the other hand, it would be advisable to
increase the quantities of every species of purgative medicine,
this alteration embracing equally the demand that exists during
the voyage, and in the hospitals in New South Wales.</p>
<p><a name="ch-08" id="ch-08"></a><b><small>PRISON
ROOM.]</small></b></p>
<p>The accommodation now afforded to convicts in the prisons
of the transport ships, by allotting eighteen inches to each
convict in every sleeping birth, is quite sufficient; and the
only improvement that seems to be required in the fitting of
these vessels, is one that would contribute to enforce
discipline, by affording a separation of the well conducted
convicts from the refractory and turbulent. It would, however,
effect a change in the present construction of the hospitals,
that seems to have been adopted upon some consideration of the
advantages and disadvantages attending their position in the fore
or after part of the vessel, and which, although condemned by
very many of the surgeons appointed to this service, has
certainly been confirmed by a successful experience of four
years.</p>
<p>The fore part of the ship that is now devoted to the hospital
would indisputably form the best situation for a separate place
of confinement for offenders, as all the inconveniences arising
from bad or suspended ventilation, increased motion, leakage and
opening of the sides of the vessel in bad weather, are
necessarily felt there, in a greater degree than in the other
parts of the ship. These reasons equally concur in rendering the
same place unfit for an hospital. It is asserted, however, that
the introduction of the hospital into the after parts of the
ship, whereby it would be placed next to the crew and guard,
might augment the dangers of infection to them; and that the men,
whose lives are the least valuable, ought to incur the greater
risk. It is further alleged, that any arrangement by which the
personal inspection of the surgeons is frequently directed to the
whole of the prison (which must be the case if they have to
traverse it, on their visits to the hospital,) ought not to be
exchanged for another and more commodious position of that
apartment, unless the advantages of such a change are clear and
decisive. The advantages on one side consist of a greater degree
of comfort and better ventilation to the hospital patients, with
the means of providing a separate place of confinement for the
refractory and ill disposed, in a portion of the seam at present
occupied by the hospital; and on the other, a more constant
inspection of the prison by the surgeons superintendent, economy
of space in the ship, the appropriation of the best and most airy
part of it to the separate use of the juvenile convicts; and that
immediate control over the others that is now afforded to the
military guard, which would be lost, if the hospital were
interposed between their apartment and the prison.</p>
<p><a name="ch-09" id="ch-09"></a><b>21st Article of
Instructions; A. No. 1.]</b></p>
<p>In making the present arrangement it does not appear that any
medical authority was consulted; and if the danger of infection
formed one of the reasons for making it, it may well be doubted
whether that danger is not augmented by confining it to that part
of the ship where there must always be the least degree of
ventilation and the greatest degree of damp. As a strict
examination of the convicts, both male and female, by the surgeon
superintendent, before admission into the ship, and a determined
rejection of any that are infected with contagious disorders, has
during the last few years, prevented the introduction of them
into convict ships, their occurrence during the voyage has been
very rare; but in case such a calamity should occur, the present
situation of the hospitals would not only render the cure of such
diseases more difficult, but must necessarily expose a greater
number of persons to their influence than if they were placed in
the after part of the ship between the apartment of the sailors
and the guard and the prison. The control of the guard over the
prison would certainly be removed; but until some medical
authority has sanctioned the present situation of the hospital,
it would appear, that the object of security from any sudden
violence of the convicts, has been preferred to that of security
from the contagion of disease.</p>
<p>The present plan of fitting the convict ships, does not admit
of any classification of the prisoners beyond that of appointing
the best conducted to the situation of wardsmen; nor can any plan
be devised, that will not, in a greater or less degree, impede
ventilation. The separation of the boys from the men has
sometimes been attended with this consequence; and although the
introduction of schools, during the voyage, should by all means
be encouraged, it appears doubtful whether greater mischiefs do
not arise from placing the boys by themselves during the night,
than by distributing them in small numbers amongst the other
convicts: a separate birth should continue to be provided for
facilitating the means of their instruction during the day, and
all the arrangements for separating them at night should be left
to the discretion of the surgeon superintendent.</p>
<p>The space that is allotted for the seamen and military paid,
being scarcely adequate to their accommodation for so long a
voyage, it is of importance that no addition should be made to
the number of passengers for which the arrangements are first
calculated. Instances have occurred in which free passengers, and
wives of soldiers of the guard, have been permitted to embark
after the convicts, and much inconvenience and a great deal of
ill-will has been created by the difficulty of providing for
their accommodation. This observation applies more particularly
to the female convict ships, in which a great number of free
women and their children are always allowed to embark; but more
especially those that touch at Cork to complete their number; and
it has moreover been observed, that the admixture of Irish female
convicts with the English, and the delay that is consequent to
their reception at Cork, while it prolongs the voyage, interrupts
a course of discipline which, when once established, it is
material to maintain, and which is found to be much checked by
any delay of the ship in a foreign harbour.</p>
<p>The exercise of authority over the convicts during the
passage, and the doubts that have arisen respecting its nature,
are points that require some consideration.</p>
<p>The several acts of parliament that regulate the
transportation of offenders to places beyond the seas, have in
most cases adopted the provisions of the 4th Geo. c. 11, by which
a property in the services of the convicts is assigned to the
person who contracts to transport them. The security of the
contractor, and the interest that he feels in safely conveying
the convicts to their place of destination, and in discharging
the obligations of his bond, naturally pointed out him or his
agent as the persons in whom the chief control over them was to
be vested. By the charter-party the owner covenants that the
captain of the convict ship shall obey all orders that he may
receive from the Commissioners of the Navy, and that he shall
attend to all such requisitions as may be made by the surgeon
superintendent, to admit the convicts upon deck, and to promote
cleanliness and ventilation, "as much as possible consistent with
safety". By the instructions of the Navy Board likewise, with
which every master of a convict ship is furnished, he is directed
to comply with such regulations as the surgeon superintendent may
think necessary, respecting the management of the convict; and
their treatment while on board.</p>
<p>The apparent contradiction that arises from giving a property
in the services of the convicts, and the custody of their persons
to the master of the ship, while his orders as well as the
covenants entered into by the owner of the vessel, enjoin him to
comply with the directions of the surgeon superintendent, has
given rise to frequent altercations between them during the
voyage; the surgeon superintendent contending, that the master is
bound to comply with all directions that he may give him touching
the management of the convicts, and under all circumstances that
do not affect the safety of the ship.</p>
<p>This qualification has likewise been construed by some to be
limited only to the safe navigation of the vessel, and not to
comprise the possible case of a mutiny amongst the convicts. The
masters, on the other hand, maintain that they have a greater
share of authority over the convicts, and that the personal
interest they have at stake in safely conveying them, as well as
from the interest of their owners in the vessel, they are fitter
judges of all circumstances that may affect their security.</p>
<p>The two points in which such a collision of authority have
most frequently occurred, are the admission of the convicts to
the deck, and the taking off their irons, at an early period
after leaving England; both, it has been observed, of
considerable importance to the maintenance of their health and
discipline.</p>
<p>It is the interest of the surgeon superintendent to deliver
the number intrusted to him in a good state of health; it is the
interest of the master to deliver them only in safety; and the
heavy penalty into which he enters, for the punctual fulfilment
of this part of his duty, must naturally outweigh the contingent
value of the remuneration that is promised for his general good
conduct and humane treatment, or the consideration of prejudice
or loss that an opposite line of conduct may occasion to his
owners.</p>
<p>It is the opinion of Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde, that to remedy
these doubts, and the discussions that take place between the
masters and the surgeons superintendent of convict ships, the
authority of the surgeon should be more defined, and that to him
should also be given the property in their services, and the safe
custody of their persons.</p>
<p>It would, however, be too great a risk for the government to
separate the responsibility for the custody and delivery of the
persons of the convicts from the individual in command of the
ship, or from those who hold a property in it. While that
responsibility remains with the captain, it is difficult to take
away from him all discretion whatever in support of it. The
surgeon superintendent has the power of entering upon his journal
the refusal of the captain to comply with his request, and of
causing an investigation of this refusal to be made on the
arrival of the ship in New South Vales; and the faithful and
fearless exercise of this power by the surgeon, forms the only
security for a compliance with his requests that the nature of
the service will admit.</p>
<p>The necessity of resorting to corporal punishment of the
convicts during the passage, and the assumption of authority for
this purpose by the surgeon in some cases, and in others by the
master, have likewise furnished ground for disputes between them.
The power of inflicting it is not at present given to either by
any law or instruction; and those who have had recourse to it
have been content to rest their justification upon the
circumstances of each particular case.</p>
<p>Complaints of undue severity of corporal punishment during the
passage have been very rare of late; and as a resort to it on
some occasions is necessary, where the use of handcuffs and
double irons are found to be ineffectual, it appears that some
legislative sanction should be given to the infliction of
moderate corporal punishment, and that the power of ordering it
should be vested in the surgeon superintendent, rather than in
the captain of the transport. To the same officer should likewise
be confided all discretion in the application of the military
force; and to prevent misunderstandings to which the want of
instructions on this head have given rise, the officer commanding
it should be ordered to comply with such requisitions for
assistance as the surgeon superintendent may think necessary. The
want of authority to inflict punishment on the soldiers of the
guard in case of repeated drunkenness or misconduct, has been
felt on several occasions; and as the detachments that are sent
on this duty generally consist of young recruits, it is expedient
that all temptation to excess should be as much as possible
avoided or diminished. With this view, the regulation that
prevails in the issue of spirits to troops on service, of
diluting them with a proportion of two-thirds of water, should be
strictly enjoined, except on the occurrence of any cold or wet
weather.</p>
<p>Considering the difficulties that always attend the adjustment
of authority on board vessels employed in the transport of troops
as well as of convicts, it does not appear to be expedient or
practicable to vary the measure or the principle upon which the
present distribution of it proceeds, further than by giving a
power, of ordering moderate punishment, to the surgeon
superintendent, and impressing upon the minds of the captains of
transports, the penal consequences, to themselves and their
owners, of an unwarrantable opposition to the surgeon's
requests.</p>
<p>A subject of no less difficulty occurs in providing means of
employment to the male convicts; and it does not appear that any
have been recommended that would not in a great degree endanger
the safety of the vessel, or interfere with the space required
for stores and provisions.</p>
<p>The establishment of schools under the authority of the
surgeon, and especially amongst the boys, has always been
attended with good effects and although there has been no want
experienced latterly in the supply of religious books, and of
bibles and testaments, yet it does not appear that they are
accompanied by any of the common elementary school books; a
supply of both should be sent to the surgeon for distribution,
and use on the voyage; and he should be instructed to deliver
them to one of the resident chaplains at Sydney, and held to
produce his receipt for them.</p>
<p>The employment of the convicts in such parts of the navigation
of the vessels as are not performed aloft, may safely and
advantageously be resorted to. They are generally willing to take
part in it, and the mechanics find it their interest to make
themselves useful in return for occasional indulgences of food,
and freer admission to the deck. The greater proportion, however,
during the passage, are sunk in indolence, to which the ordinary
duties of washing and cleansing the prisons, though highly
salutary in themselves, and performed with great regularity,
afford but slight interruption.</p>
<p>The practices of thieving from each other, quarrelling and
gambling for their allowances of wine and lime-juice, are the
common offences that occur during the voyage; and they are most
easily restrained and punished, by depriving the convicts of
money and keeping it in deposit for them; and by strictly
observing that the allowance of wine and lime-juice is taken by
every convict in the presence of an officer, at the place of
distribution. The issue of these two articles is rightly left to
the discretion of the surgeon superintendent; and a temporary
deduction of the allowance of wine is not unfrequently resorted
to as a salutary punishment, and is rendered more effectual, by
obliging the offending individuals to attend and administer the
allowance they have forfeited to those who conduct themselves
well.</p>
<p>It is generally observed, that the convicts from London are
found to be more seriously affected by scurvy, debility and
pneumonic diseases than those of more robust habits, and who have
been accustomed to agricultural pursuits; and it is equally
observable, that the moral habits of the first of these clams of
convicts are more depraved, and that they are consequently less
easily controlled than those from the country.</p>
<p>The convicts embarked in Ireland generally arrive in New South
Wales in a very healthy state; and are found to be more obedient
and more sensible of kind treatment during the passage than any
other class. Their separation from their native country is
observed to make a stronger impression upon their minds, both on
their departure and during the voyage; and the ignorance in which
most of them are respecting their future fate, tends to preserve
those salutary impressions until its termination.</p>
<p>The aged and the infirm convicts frequently suffer so much
from debility and the use of salt provisions, that the surgeons
find it necessary to support them with a constant diet of
preserved meat and other medical comforts; an unless such
convicts have received sentences of transportation for life, it
seems to be a great aggravation of their bodily sufferings, as
well as great augmentation of expense, to send them to New South
Wales for any shorter periods.</p>
<p>Mental suffering forms but a small part of the punishment of
the voyage. Instances have occurred in which it has both produced
disease and aggravated it; and this has unfortunately occurred in
cases where it would have been more desirable to have diminished
punishment than to have augmented it. The pressure of the voyage,
where it is felt at all, weighs most heavily upon those feelings
that are most respectable, and which are perhaps the last that
the worst men lose. Such instances are rare, and as the voyage is
now conducted, it produces no greater degree of bodily
inconvenience to ordinary men than many are exposed to who are
not in a state of punishment, and certainly it is not found to be
productive of injury to their constitutions. The uninterrupted
association, however, amongst the convicts, to which it gives
rise, and the habitual indolence that it encourages, are strong
reasons for abridging its continuance.</p>
<p>The experience of many years has now established the safety,
as well as ease, with which the voyage to New South Wales may be
performed. No ships have arrived in a disabled state in
consequence of disasters at sea, and none have occurred in that
part of the voyage where they are most to be apprehended, viz. in
Bass's Straits. The principal causes of delay have arisen in
cases where ships have attempted to keep too near the west coast
of Africa before they have passed the Equator, or when they have
arrived on the western coast of New South Wales in the months of
December, January and February. In the first of these events they
have generally repaired to the island of St. Helena for a fresh
supply of water; and in the latter, some inconvenience has been
sustained from its exhaustion, and from the delay in making a
passage through Bass's Straits against easterly winds, or in
rounding the south-west cape of Van Dieman's Land.</p>
<p>With a view to meet these difficulties, an accurate
calculation of the supply of water should be made soon after
passing the Equator, as it is during that period of the voyage
that the consumption is the greatest, and that disease most
generally begins to show itself.</p>
<p>It is from a consideration of both these circumstances, that
the expediency of resorting to Rio de Janeiro, or to the Cape of
Good Hope, or the possibility of making the voyage direct, should
be regulated; and the supply of water should be required to be
stated on the log-book of the captain, and the journal of the
surgeon, as the principal justification of stopping at either of
these ports. The detentions at Rio de Janeiro, and the
difficulties experienced in obtaining water there, together with
the introduction of spirits among the convicts, are evils of
serious importance. The attention of the captain and surgeon,
instead of being devoted to the care of the ship and convicts, is
much interrupted by commercial speculations of their own. The
convicts, for the sake of security, are ordered to resume their
irons; and it may well be doubted whether these circumstances,
combined with the effect of a very warm temperature, do not
counterbalance the advantages of a temporary change in their
diet, and a more abundant supply of water.</p>
<p>The Cape of Good Hope is a better place of resort for convict
ships, except in the three winter months of June, July and
August; and it may be remarked, that the detention of vessels at
that place has not been so protracted as at Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<p>Circumstances may arise in the passage from England to the
Line, and so much delay, and consequently such an exhaustion of
the stock of water may take place, that a resort to one or other
of those places may become unavoidable; but the captains and
surgeons superintendent should be enjoined to make the voyage
direct if possible, and should be held to give a very clear proof
of the necessity of any deviation.</p>
<p>A reference to a return of voyages performed by different
convict ships from England and Ireland to New South Wales, from
the year 1810 to the end of the year 1820, with which I was
favoured by the Commissioners of the Navy Board, and the abstract
that I have since made from it, will show the comparative
advantages attending the three different courses. The average
length of 44 direct voyages, made during the above periods, is
found to be 127 days. The number of convicts so conveyed was
7,657, and out of these, 71 died on the passage and 97 were
landed sick. The average length of 38 voyages, touching at Rio le
Janeiro in the passage, is found to be 156 days; and out of 6,470
convicts conveyed, 132 died, and 123 were landed sick. The
average length of 11 voyages, and touching at the Cape of Good
Hope, is found to be 146 days; and out of 1,912 convicts
conveyed, nine died on the passage, and 57 were landed sick.</p>
<p>The advantages, therefore, of the direct passage from England
to New South Wales are very apparent, both in the point of
economy of the lives, as well as the subsistence of the
convicts.</p>
<p>The temptations to the masters, and to the surgeons
superintendent to touch at Rio de Janeiro, and to purchase sugar
and tobacco there, have at all times been great. The profits upon
tie sale of these adventures in New South Wales and Van Dieman's
Land, will always tempt them to create pretexts for the
circuitous passages, as long as it is understood that they will
be allowed to land their goods on their arrival.</p>
<p>The circumstances under which that permission has been given
and continued, will more properly be discussed when the subject
of the trade of New South Wales is considered. I will at present
only remark, that a great temptation to a violation of the rules
prescribed to them by the Navy Board, has been held out to such
of the surgeons superintendent as were proceeding to New South
Wales on appointments front England, by a practice that has long
prevailed in the colony of allowing such persons the liberty of
importing both spirits and tobacco free of duty. The last
instance in which it occurred, was that of Dr. Bromley, surgeon
of the female convict ship Wellington; who, it appears, was
allowed to land 150 gallons of spirits, one hogshead and six
dozen bottles of wine, and o baskets of tobacco at Port Jackson.
Dr. Bromley likewise availed himself of the very unusual and
protracted stay of the ship Wellington at Rio de Janeiro, to put
on board several articles that he conceived would be useful to
him in the colony, limiting their extent only to the tonnage that
had been allowed to him in England.</p>
<p>The transportation of female convicts to New South Wales, is a
subject that presents more difficulty than any that occurs in the
subjects now under consideration.</p>
<p>In consequence of the freer admission to the deck that is
allowed to the female convicts during the passage, their health
is rarely affected by the same causes that are prejudicial to
that of the male convicts; and the proportionate loss occasioned
during a period of ten years, appears to be considerably
less.</p>
<p>The allowance of provisions and medical comforts to the female
convicts, is ample; and it appears that change of climate and
regularity of diet have operated very favourably on the
constitutions of many that had been debilitated by previous
habits of licentiousness and vice.</p>
<p>The same complaints respecting the conduct: of the masters of
the transports, in withholding the due allowance of provisions,
are found to occur amongst the female convicts as amongst the
males, and the same compromises of that offence take place on
their approach to the port of destination.</p>
<p>The moral effects of separation from their native country are
less sensibly felt by the female convicts; and when the first
sensations of the sea voyage are subdued, their minds are more
elevated by the prospects before them, than depressed by the
recollection of those they have just quitted.</p>
<p>It has been found, that the establishment of schools, and the
continuance, as far as circumstances will permit, of that
salutary system of instruction and discipline that has been
introduced into the female wards of Newgate, has tended
materially to preserve good order and decent conduct. The want of
means of employment for the women, is one of the great
difficulties with which the most zealous promoters of this system
have had to contend. Of the means that have yet been devised,
those are obviously the best that are the most simple, and that
are likely to afford a regulated profit at the end, rather than
in the middle of the voyage. Of these, the most practicable wear
to me to be the employment of weaving and making straw hats for
the use of the male convicts in New South Wales; and that of
making up the striped linen shirts that are issued to them there,
as part of their allowance of clothing. A portion of the profits
of their labour might be allowed to be received on landing, and
the remainder might be held in deposit, and liable to be
forfeited by misconduct.</p>
<p>All employments that have a tendency to encourage a passion
for dress should be studiously avoided; and the female convicts
should be compelled to consider, that the dress that is provided
by the government is that which is most suitable to their
condition: nothing, indeed, can be more unsuitable to it than the
appearance that they have been allowed to make on their arrival
in New South Wales, and nothing that ought to be more speedily
checked, whenever a proper place of reception is completed, for
those who are not assigned to individuals on their first
arrival.</p>
<p>For the superintendence of the labour of the female convicts
during the voyage, it would be very desirable to employ one of
the numerous free women that are allowed to take their passage in
the female convict ships. The selection of one female convict for
the superintendence of all the rest, produces jealousy of her
power without obedience to it; whereas a delegation of a small
portion of authority to a married female of good character, who
has opportunities that the surgeon cannot, and personally ought
not to have, of watching and detecting misconduct both during the
night and day, will enable him to punish with more certainty and
effect, and to avoid that suspicion of guilty connivance, which,
if once established amongst the convicts or crew, becomes a
prelude and pretext for their disorders. The performance of this
duty on board a female convict ship, must be subject to the
direction and authority of the surgeon, who should also have the
power of recommending a remuneration to be given by the Governor
of New South Wales, regulated by the merits of the individual,
and not exceeding ten pounds.</p>
<p>The instructions issued by the Navy Board to the surgeons
superintendent and the masters of female convict ships, impose
strict injunctions upon them to afford good example to their
officers and crew, and to use their utmost endeavours to prevent
improper intercourse between them and the female convicts. The
repeated instances in which these injunctions have been violated,
prove the difficulty, and, perhaps, the impossibility of entirely
preventing it; and the best security against that violation is to
be found in the characters of the surgeons and masters to whom
this difficult task is assigned.</p>
<p>The instance of the ship Morley, commanded by Captain Brown,
and superintended by Dr. Reed, and the occurrences that took
place upon the voyage, together with the behaviour and appearance
of the females upon their arrival in New South Wales, strongly
attest the benefits that are derivable from good example,
employment and attention to religious duties during the voyage.
That these advantages were neither wholly attained, nor permanent
in this instance, are facts that take away nothing from the merit
or the importance of the service: under other circumstances, its
value to the colony of New South Wales is capable of being
realized, and at the present moment is well worth estimating,
either in comparison with every instance that preceded it, or as
a proof of what is practicable for the future. The difficulty
that is most embarrassing, arises from the want of means of
punishing the women and the sailors during the voyage, for the
improper intercourse that takes place between them.</p>
<p>The confinement of the women to the prison-deck is not an
effectual punishment, and it frequently causes a greater degree
of annoyance to the well-conducted prisoners than to the parties
themselves. Deprivation of the ordinary comforts, the use of a
wooden collar and shaving the head, are the only practicable
punishments that can be resorted to, and they are in some degree
effectual, though their operation is unequal, and depends upon
the character and the greater or less degree of sensibility to
shame in the party that suffers them.</p>
<p>The use of violent and indecent language is one of the worst
consequences of the intercourse between the women and the crew
and the efforts made to correct it by the master and the officers
of the ship, only lead to fresh insults and to greater
provocation. The punishment and correction of the women,
therefore, should be left, as much as possible, to the direction
of the surgeon superintendent. The punishment of the crew for
holding improper intercourse with them, in the voyages from
England to New South Wales, is, according to the present state of
the law, not provided for; and as no master, of a ship, however
well disposed, will incur the risk of a mutiny of his crew for
the sole purpose of preventing it, or the great degree of
personal responsibility that would accrue from the infliction
even of a moderate degree of corporal punishment, it would be
advisable that the provisions of 37 Geo. c. 73, which at present
are confined to ships trading to His Majesty's colonies and
plantations in the West Indies, should be extended to those
employed in conveying male and female convicts to New South
Wales.</p>
<p>The punishment provided by that act, consists of a forfeiture
of the wages and property of any seaman guilty of disobedience of
such lawful commands as the master may think necessary to issue,
for the effectual government of the vessel, and for suppressing
vice and immorality of all kinds.</p>
<p>To give the master a power of inflicting corporal punishment
for such an offence, would be dangerous; but as the forfeiture of
wages may afford some cheek, though not an effectual one, over
the licentious conduct of the sailors, it would be expedient to
give it; and the power of awarding the forfeiture should be given
to two or more magistrates of New South Wales and Van Dieman's
Land, subject to an appeal to the Vice-admiralty court at
Sydney.</p>
<p>A great improvement has undoubtedly arisen in the
transportation of convicts, from the appointment of naval
surgeons to the superintendence of the ships taken up for this
service. Much attention has been paid by them to the instructions
of the Navy Board, that enjoin an attention to the performance of
religious duties; and their efforts in preserving health have
been no less conspicuous and successful. In promoting these, it
does not often happen that they meet with direct opposition from
the masters of convict ships; but as there are points in their
conduct, respecting which no other individual than the surgeon
can be expected to hold a control, or afford information, it is
of no small importance to make the surgeons as independent as
possible of the favour of the master and the bounty of the
owners.</p>
<p>During the continuance of peace, it is not likely that any
difficulty will be experienced in obtaining the services of the
naval surgeons, in the transportation of convicts; but as the
knowledge that they acquire by one voyage in the manage. meet of
the convicts, gives them a confidence that is eminently
advantageous on the second, it seems desirable, that, such as
return to England, with as much expedition as possible, and bring
certificates of their good conduct, should have the preference of
a second appointment. This arrangement, when established, will
have the two fold advantage of stimulating them to a faithful
performance of their duty, and of detaching them from those
considerations of personal advantage, which they not unfrequently
have sought, by stipulating with the owners for a continuance of
their medical services in the ships that proceed from New South
Wales to India. 'This stipulation is also very generally
connected with that of extending them to the officers and crew of
the convict ships in the passage from England, in return for a
table allowance found either by the captain or the owners; and an
instance occurred lately, in which a surgeon of a convict ship
recovered from the captain, in an action brought in the supreme
court of New South Wales, the estimated amount of medical advice
and services performed by him for the captain and the crew,
during this period. It does not appear very clearly from the
printed instructions of the Navy Board that are given to the
surgeons, whether the medical attendance of the ship's officers
and crew is included in the duty to which they are appointed; and
as it is of importance to remove from the minds of the surgeons
all expectation of reward from any other quarter than that from
whence they derive their appointment, in the first instance, or
may hereafter hope to receive another, it is expedient that all
further doubt upon this point should be removed. On the other
hand, it is only reasonable, that the surgeons should receive the
full amount of the sum that they have to pay for their passage
from New South Wales to England, which cannot be estimated at
less than 95<i>l</i>. when it is made direct, as well as an
allowance for lodging money during their residence in Sydney. The
augmentation of expense occasioned by these allowances will be
amply compensated by the inducement, that they will hold out to
men of respectability to engage, and to continue in the service;
and it will leave no excuse for want of vigilance in observing,
and of fidelity in exposing the corrupt application of the
liberal provision that is made by government for the use of the
convicts.</p>

<h3>II.<br>
<br>
<i>Debarkation and Muster of the Convicts, Male and
Female.</i></h3>
<p><small>THE</small> interval that elapses between the arrival
of a convict ship in New South Wales, and the debarkation of the
convicts, is one that affords the fullest exercise for their
ingenuity in the arts of imposition and concealment, and also in
devising the means of their future indulgence.</p>
<p>The selection of mechanics for the government works is so well
known, and so much dreaded, for the reasons that will be stated
hereafter, that it was deemed necessary to award a punishment to
all those who should be guilty of concealing their trades.</p>
<p>The vigilance of the chief engineer at Sydney is particularly
directed to this object; and if he fails in accomplishing it,
when the convicts are yet on board, the superintendent Hutchinson
is not slow in acquiring information, by which the concealed
mechanic is taken from the employment of the individual who may
have secured him, and is made to join one of the government
gangs.</p>
<p><a name="ch-11" id="ch-11"></a><b>Vide Government and Public
Notice, Sydney Gazette, 19 April 1817.]</b></p>
<p>It will likewise happen, that from a hope of being employed in
Sydney, several will declare themselves to be mechanics who have
little or no knowledge of the trade they profess. Those who have
brought money or goods with them, are actively employed in
placing or selling them advantageously; in acquainting their
friends with their arrival, or in soliciting those to whom they
may be recommended, or those whom they can afford to pay, to
apply for them as assigned servants.</p>
<p>The position that the convict ships take in the harbour,
during the interval between arrival and debarkation, is not such
as to insure a proper degree of vigilance in preventing
communication with the shore; all are anchored and sometimes
crowded in Sydney cove; whereas it would not be attended with any
real inconvenience if they were made to anchor in front of
Dawes's battery, where they would lie between the guns and the
observation of that work and those of the new fort on Bennelong's
Point, and would, be compelled to remain there until the morning
appointed for the debarkation. The sentries on board are ordered
to prevent persons from visiting the ships without a permission
of the naval officer; but this duty is feebly performed; and
until the establishment of the police guard boat, there were no
effectual means of preventing communication between the ships and
the shore. Even at present, the government and other boats manned
with convicts are frequently seen hovering round the convict
ships; and the naval officer's boat, in which they are first
visited, is manned by convict sailors, and steered by a coxswain,
who is an emancipated convict.</p>
<p>In the period that I am now describing, the governor's
secretary, Mr. John Thomas Campbell, and the superintendent of
convicts, William Hutchinson, repair on board for the purpose of
mustering the convicts. This muster is of a very detailed nature,
and is taken by Mr. J. T. Campbell on the quarter-deck of the
vessel, in the presence of the surgeon superintendent, the
captain and ship's company. Each convict is asked his name, the
time and place of his trial, his sentence, native place, age,
trade and occupation; and the answers are compared (and corrected
if necessary) by the description in the indents and in the lists
transmitted from the hulks. After ascertaining the height of each
convict by actual admeasurement, and registering it in several
columns, as well as the colour of the hair, eyes, the complexion
or any particular mark that may tend to establish the identity of
each convict, an inquiry is made respecting the treatment that
each has received during the passage, whether he has received his
full ration of provisions; whether he has any complaint to make
against the captain, his officers and crew; and lastly, whether
he any bodily ailment or infirmity. A further inquiry is made of
the surgeon, respecting the conduct of each convict during the
passage, and whether he has any bodily infirmity that may prevent
him from being actively employed.</p>
<p>The muster of 150 convicts conducted in this manner, occupies
the secretary from five to seven hours; and if the complaints are
numerous, it is protracted to the following day.</p>
<p>The correctness and particularity of this muster is of great
importance; for when signed by the secretary, it forms a check
upon any error that may have crept into the indents and
assignments of the convicts that are transmitted from the
Secretary of State's office to the governor of New South Wales,
and connects the date of trial and description of their offences
with a complete identification of their persons, highly useful
for purposes of police, as well as for the regulations respecting
tickets of leave and certificates of exemptions from penal
servitude.</p>
<p>From the period of his appointment to the office of secretary
to the governor, in February 1810, until the latest period of
holding it, the <i>musters</i> of the convicts have been taken
and conducted by Mr. J. T. Campbell in person, with the single
exception of those that arrived in the ship "Indefatigable" in
the year 1815.</p>
<p>In his absence from Sydney, on the arrival of that vessel, the
muster was taken by Captain Gill, the chief engineer. It is in
his handwriting, and in the usual form, but not signed by him;
and from some circumstance, that Mr. Campbell was not able to
explain, the original lists or indents of the convicts embarked
in that vessel did not arrive, nor has any application been made
for them till a very late period.</p>
<p><a name="ch-12" id="ch-12"></a><b><small>COMPLAINTS OF THE
CONVICTS.]</small></b></p>
<p>THE efficacy of the inquiry made by the governor's secretary
into the complaints of the convicts, respecting their treatment
during the passage, is not so apparent as the other advantages
that it secures; for, at the conclusion of the musters of two
ships, the "Daphne" and the "Janus", where serious complaints
were made against the captains of the vessels, for subduction of
the proper allowance of food, or the substitution of the bad
provisions of the ship, for the good provisions found by
government, as well as for highly improper conduct, it had been
recorded by Mr. Campbell, that "the prisoners declared (without
one exception) that they had been well and kindly treated by the
captain, his officers, and the surgeon superintendent, and that
they had got their rations, and every allowance regularly, and to
their perfect satisfaction."</p>
<p>This memorandum was correct, in point of fact, and as far as
Mr. Campbell's inquiries on board the ship were concerned, no
complaint having been made on those occasions to him; but it
afterwards appeared, that a compromise had taken place between
the captain and certain of the convicts in the "Daphne", and a
verbal promise between the captain and two female convicts on
board the "Janus"; and as the performance of one was delayed
until after they were disembarked, the silence of all the parties
when on board, and when asked if they had any complaint to make,
was adopted by Mr. Campbell as negativing the existence of
any.</p>
<p>Some delay or reluctance in the performance of the conditions
of the compromise having taken place on the part of the captains,
the complaints were brought to the notice of the governor, and by
him referred to the investigation of a bench of magistrates, who
found, that although in the case of the "Daphne", the regular
rations of provisions had not been issued to the convicts, yet
that previous to their arrival at Port Jackson, they had agreed
to accept, and had, in fact, accepted an equivalent in money from
the captain, of which they afterwards repented, and therefore
were not entitled to redress; and in the ease of the "Janus", the
magistrates found ample reason for reporting very strongly
against the conduct of the Captain.</p>
<p><a name="ch-13" id="ch-13"></a><b>Muster of the Convicts by
the Governor.]</b></p>
<p>When the muster has been completed on board the convict ships,
the governor appoints a day for their disembarkation. At an early
hour on that day the convicts are dressed in their new clothing,
and are marched into the yard of the gaol at Sydney, where they
are arranged in two lines for the inspection of the governor;
they are permitted to bring with them the bedding that they have
used on board the transport ship, and such articles of clothing
and effects as they may have brought with them.</p>
<p><a name="ch-14" id="ch-14"></a><b>Address of the Governor to
the Convicts.]</b></p>
<p>The captain of the transport, the surgeon superintendent, the
chief engineer, and the superintendent of convicts, accompany the
governor in his inspection; and the superintendent, as he
proceeds, repeats aloud from a distribution list, previously
prepared, the destination that has been given to the several
convicts, either by the chief engineer for the use of government,
or by the applications of individuals signified to the
magistrates of the different districts, or to the superintendent
himself. In this part of the inspection, the governor receives
the report of the captain and superintendent respecting the good
or bad conduct of any individuals during the passage, and
promises to attend to their recommendations; he rarely alters the
destination of the convicts, made by the superintendent, but he
sometimes desires that particular descriptions of men may be
assigned to individuals, whose applications more immediately
occur to him. These orders are signified to the superintendent
and chief engineer; and when the governor has finished the
inspection, he addresses the convicts in an audible tone,
commencing his address with an inquiry, whether they have any
complaints to make, whether their treatment during the passage
has been humane and kind, and whether they have had their proper
allowance of provisions. If any complaint is signified, the name
of the individual is taken down, and the inquiry is referred to
the police magistrates; but, if the convicts are silent, or if
they declare generally that they are satisfied, the governor
proceeds in his address. He expresses his hope that the change
which has been effected in their situation, will lead to a change
in their conduct; that they will become new men; and he
explicitly informs them that as no reference will be had to the
past, their future conduct in their respective situations will
alone entitle them to reward or indulgence.</p>
<p>It frequently happens, that the convicts brought by two
vessels are inspected at the same time; but no variation made in
the mode of conducting it; and when concluded, the convicts
destined for distribution by the magistrates, are sent either by
water to Paramatta, under the care of a constable, or marched to
Liverpool with their baggage; they are lodged in the gaols of the
different towns as they pass, and are assigned to the settlers in
the districts according to the application that has been made for
them, regulated however by the discretion and will of the
magistrates who assign them.</p>
<p>In the disembarkation and distribution of the female convicts,
a part only of these regulations is observed. The governor's
secretary and the superintendent of convicts, take the muster of
the females on board the ship; the same inquiries are made as in
the males; but the female convicts are rarely seen by the
governor afterwards, and they are allowed to land in their own
dresses, and not in those provided for them by the Navy Board.
Such of them as are not assigned to individuals in Sydney, or
permitted to join their husbands, are sent by water to the
factory at Paramatta.</p>
<p>The muster and inspection of the convicts landed in Van
Dieman's Land, is conducted nearly on the same principles as that
which has just been described; but since the year 1817, a
detailed description of the persons of the convicts has been made
by the magistrate of police of Hobart Town, and kept in his
office as a future guide to the identity of their persons, either
on application for passes, tickets of leave or pardon. The
lieutenant-governor's secretary proceeds on board the convict
ships, attended by the lieutenant governor's clerk, and makes a
list or muster roll of the convicts, describing the number, name,
time and place of trial, their sentences, age, native place,
trade, description of person and character. This muster roll is
derived from an actual muster of the convicts, checked and
compared with their state and appearance after the voyage, but
the inquiries respecting complaints are not so particular as
those at Sydney, nor is any note made of them at the end of the
muster roll. The chief engineer repairs on board to make a
particular inquiry after the trades of the convicts, and their
usefulness to government; and at an early day the inspection
takes place in the gaol yard. The lieutenant-governor's address
to them is limited to an inquiry after their treatment on the
passage, approbation of their clean and orderly appearance, and a
recommendation to them of good conduct in the colony. A very
remarkable difference, however, takes place between the mode of
distribution, as practised at Sydney; for it appears, by the
evidence of Major Bell, that as soon as the lieutenant-governor
has approved the selection of the convicts, for the immediate use
of government, the settlers are allowed to choose for themselves;
an entry being made at the time of the settler's name, and
distinguishing those who are to be subsisted at the expense of
government, and at the expense of the settler. Those who are not
so allotted, are distributed amongst the public works at or near
Hobart Town, and are afterwards assigned, as they are applied
for, by the settlers, the application being invariably made to
the lieutenant-governor, and not as at Sydney to the
superintendent of convicts at that place.</p>
<p>On the arrival of a considerable number at Hobart Town, the
lieutenant-governor frequently orders a detachment to be sent to
Launceston and George Town. These are landed at a projecting
point of the harbour that has no communication by land with the
town; from whence, after being inspected by the
lieutenant-governor, they are sent in boats to a landing-place on
the river Derwent, and twelve miles above Hobart Town. Under the
escort of a serjeant's guard, they proceed by easy marches to
Launceston, a distance of one hundred and twenty miles, where
they are distributed to the settlers, or sent in boats by the
river Tamer to George Town.</p>
<p>Taking the circumstances that have now been detailed in their
natural order, I will proceed to observe upon the defects that
have appeared to me to be most obvious in this part of the
management of the convicts.</p>
<p>By the prevention of intercourse between the convicts and the
inhabitants of the colony, in the interval that takes place
between their arrival and landing, a salutary apprehension and
uncertainty respecting their future fate may be created; and
instead of indulging in speculations of profitable employment,
either of their property or interest, or securing advantageous
situations in the service of their friends, which an early
communication with the shore never fails to open, their minds
might at this moment, more than at any other, be impressed with
one of the worst characters of their condition, the hardships
they have to endure in the service of an unknown master.</p>
<p>A very meritorious attempt was made at Sydney, on the
suggestion of Mr. Justice Field, to afford opportunities to
convicts on their arrival to deposit the sums of money that they
might have brought with them from England, in the hands of
certain individuals, who had associated for the purpose of
forming a saving bank in New South Wales, upon the principles and
plan of those so generally adopted in England. Mr. Justice Field
was the author and the promoter of this measure; and under the
patronage of Governor Macquarrie, who presided at the meeting, it
was agreed, that it should be carried into effect by a committee
consisting of some very respectable individuals in Sydney. The
rules of the society were published and printed, together with a
plain and sensible address from Mr. Justice Field to the convicts
on their arrival, showing them the advantages to be derived from
the establishment of the savings bank, and inviting them to
deposit their money in it. This publication has been distributed
amongst the convicts on their arrival, and before their
disembarkation, but its success has been inconsiderable. Indeed,
when the advantageous modes of investment of money are made known
to the convicts by their friends on shore, it is not to be
supposed that they will be satisfied with the moderate though
certain profit of the savings bank. It accordingly appears, from
the evidence of the superintendent Hutchinson, that the convicts,
on arrival, prefer depositing their money in the New South Wales
bank, and in the hands of individuals, from both of whom they can
easily and immediately draw it, for the purpose of investing it
in the purchase of small tenements in the town, or of extra
allowances for their immediate use. It would further appear, that
the superintendent, who is in the habit of warning the convicts
of the risk they incur by keeping their money in their own
possession, is not unwilling to become the depository of it
himself.</p>
<p>This last circumstance became known to me through the
complaint of a convict named Hartley, who, on his arrival from
England, made a deposit in the hands of the superintendent
Hutchinson, of Bank of England notes, colonial notes, and
guineas, amounting to 89<i>l</i>. 14<i>s</i>. and not being able
to obtain it on the first application that he made, was
recommended by his master, Mr. George Cox, of Richmond, to apply
to me. On inquiry, I found that a receipt of the cashier of the
bank for the sum of 89<i>l</i>. 14<i>s</i>. "given in favour of
Mr. William Hutchinson, on account and payable on demand", had
been indorsed by him, and formed the only document upon which the
convict, W. Hartley, could lay claim to the sum deposited. He
applied to the bank for payment, but was refused, until being
informed that a complaint had been made, Hutchinson paid over the
money to Mr. George Cox, the master of Hartley. It likewise
appeared that a similar receipt was given by Hutchinson to a
convict named Upton, on his arrival, for the sum of 32<i>l</i>.
11<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. on the recommendation of Governor
Macquarrie and Mr. Secretary Campbell, to the last of whom Upton
was assigned as servant. No complaint was made of the undue
detention of this sum, but it is adduced only in proof of the
practice observed by Hutchinson, in becoming the depository of
the property of convict; and as a very probable cause of the
failure of the attempt to establish a savings bank in Sydney.</p>
<p>The property and money of those convicts who have not the
means of investing or depositing it on their arrival, points them
out as objects of plunder to many of their brethren in Sydney;
and numerous complaints have been made to me of losses and
robberies committed in their way from the place of debarkation to
the gaol yard, in returning from thence, and afterwards to embark
for Paramatta, or to the places in which they are assigned at
Sydney. Those who are ill-disposed and careless, become the
victims of the many temptations that surround them, and a great
deal of intoxication is observed amongst the newly arrived
convicts on the evening of the day on which they land. Constables
are appointed to attend the convicts on their landing, to the
gaol, and on their embarkation for Paramatta; but whether from
interest, or from inactivity, they do not succeed in restraining
them from communication with people in the streets, or in
preventing them from leaving their ranks or exchanging their
clothes for food. In the noisy and joyous recognition of their
friends and acquaintance, in the tumult of hasty and unequal
bargains, or in disappointments for the loss of their property
and bedding, they proceed from the boats to the gaol.</p>
<p>In the presence of the governor these feelings are suppressed;
and in the countenances and demeanour of a few, especially of
those who have been in the higher ranks of life, some indications
of shame and of sorrow may be discovered. The official inquiries,
respecting the convicts, that are instituted before they are
brought into the governor's presence, at the muster in the gaol,
are made with the sole view of ascertaining their competence for
employment in the works of government. The difference of their
crimes, or terms of punishment, and their previous character in
England, are points that are altogether overlooked, as much by
the nature of the governor's address to the convicts, as by the
selection of the superintendent or the inhabitants of the colony.
It has been customary, indeed, for the surgeons superintendent to
enumerate and recommend to the governor the individuals who have
conducted themselves well on board the ships during the passage,
as a title to some indulgence on their arrival, and Governor
Macquarrie has in a few instances acceded to these
recommendations; but it is stated by the superintendent son, that
they are little to be relied on, and that he has found the men to
differ e greatly from the characters so given to them, on trial.
It was found moreover, that the surgeons not unfrequently availed
themselves of this opportunity to communicate to their friends in
New South Wales, the qualifications of such convicts as had e
become known to them during the passage, and were likely to
render them valuable servants; but as the practice, though highly
beneficial to the settlers, as well as to the convicts, was found
to interfere with the demand of government for the best have not
latterly been much attended to, and in some instances have been
entirely disregarded. One of these instances is to be found in
the document A.20.</p>
<p>Applications are not unfrequently made for convicts newly
arrived, by persons related to, or connected with them, or in
consequence of recommendations that it they bring with them from
England; and such applications are attended to, unless the party
applied for happens to be a mechanic, or to possess any
qualification useful to government. In such, as indeed in every
other case, this principle of reservation prevails, and the
convict is sent to join one of the government gangs.</p>
<p>Tradesmen whose services are not required by government, such
as tailors, shoemakers and others, and those who possess money,
or property capable of being converted into money, are most
frequently selected by the overseers and the clerks, in the
different offices at Sydney, on the condition of paying them a
certain weekly sum, generally amounting to ten shillings, which
is reduced to five, if the convict gives up his government
ration. In return for this payment, and as long as it is
regularly made, the convict is allowed to be at large at Sydney,
and elsewhere, and to be at his own disposal. The condition of a
convict under this indulgence therefore, becomes at once superior
to that of his comrades, whom he has so lately left, and if his
conduct be such as to avoid the notice of the police or the
superintendent Hutchinson, he has an opportunity of maintaining
himself with comfort.</p>
<p>The practical evils of this system will be noticed hereafter;
at present it is only mentioned as one instance among many of the
inequalities in the condition of the convicts on their first
entrance into servitude. Individuals, however, who have succeeded
in obtaining a knowledge of the pecuniary means of the convicts,
and who reside in Sydney, will also apply for them; and in return
for that application, obtain a remuneration in money from the
convict, dispensing with their services, and only preserving a
nominal control over them. The convicts who are known to possess
money to a considerable amount, or who have been clerks in the
counting-houses of merchants in England, have, in most cases,
received tickets of leave on their arrival, or are allowed to be
assigned in the manner above mentioned.</p>
<p>Under this indulgence, they either embark in trade and become
retail dealers, or are employed as clerks in the commissariat
department, or in the offices of the attornies and merchants.</p>

<p><b>Applications for, and assignments of, convicts. Sydney
Gazette, 10 January 1818.]</b></p>
<p>The applications for convicts from the settlers are, by a late
order of Governor Macquarrie, required to be made to the
principal superintendent, William Hutchinson; and a reproof is
also conveyed in the order, to those who have made immediate
applications to the governor for any particular description of
labourers.</p>
<p>At the early period of Governor Macquarrie's administration,
the applications for convicts, which were then more pressing than
they have latterly been, were directed to be addressed to Mr.
Secretary Campbell, by such persons as were resident in Sydney,
and to the magistrates of the different districts, by those who
resided there and as a guide for distribution, it was required by
the latter that they should state the number of acres that they
had in cultivation. Of late years, as applications from the
settlers became more numerous, they have fallen entirely into the
hands of William Hutchinson, the superintendent of convicts; for
although the Magistrates in the different districts distribute
such convicts as are sent to them, regulated in point of number
by the applications that are made, and transmitted in the first
instance to Governor Macquarrie, and through him to the
superintendent Hutchinson, yet applications are made to him by
individuals at a distance, for a particular description of
labourers, and are assigned by him at Sydney; and he possesses
altogether the power of making a selection there of the best or
the worst convicts, or a due proportion of each, for the service
of the different districts. The list of applications for convicts
is also kept in his office at Sydney, and every person who
applies, causes his name and residence to be taken down, together
with a description of the class of convict that he wishes to
have.</p>
<p>The distribution was formerly made by lot, according to a
scheme explained by Mr. Secretary Campbell to the magistrates,
and adverted to in a government public notice, bearing date the
6th July 1811, and published in the Sydney Gazette. This measure
was resorted to, at a period when there was a pressing demand for
labourers of any description; but those settlers only were
allowed to send in their name, who were "considered as most in
want and best entitled to receive them." The order does not
indeed specify who the person was that should have the power of
determining this preliminary and important question; but as the
lottery was to take place under the direction of the magistrates,
and the distribution also, it is fair to presume that they
exercised a discretion upon that as well as other points. Indeed
it is distinctly stated by the Reverend Mr. Marsden, that "as he
considered it to be a degradation to the honest part of the
society to be put on the same level with the class that had been
convicts, he allowed the former to select, in the first place,
such men as would answer their purpose, and then the settlers,
who had been convicts, were allowed to draw lots for the
remainder."</p>
<p>As the number of convicts increased in the colony, the mode of
distribution by lottery fell into disuse, and the exercise of
this great patronage has fallen into the hands of the
Superintendent Hutchinson at Sydney, and has occasionally been
divided between him and Major Druid the chief engineer, while the
distribution in the districts has been altogether in the hands of
the magistrates.</p>
<p>It appears by the instructions that have been transmitted from
time to time by Governor Macquarrie upon this subject to the
chief engineer and the principal superintendent, as well as by
the evidence of Mr. John and Mr. Hannibal M&#145;Arthur, that the
applications of individuals to the governor for mechanics and for
agricultural labourers, have been sometimes successful; but the
assignment of a mechanic has always been considered the greatest
favour that could be bestowed by the governor, and it has been
granted only to individuals whom he wished to distinguish or
oblige, or who could plead the execution of some important
undertaking. The in numerous refusals however that have been
given to applications of this kind, and grounded always upon the
important works that government was carrying on, have latterly
rendered them less frequent, and have augmented the general
dissatisfaction, that the monopoly of the best mechanical and
agricultural labour by it, government has at all times created,
but more particularly during the government of Major-general
Macquarrie.</p>
<p>Another principle observed for some in the distribution of the
convicts, during the period in which the ships were ordered to
proceed to Port Jackson in the first instance, was a detachment
of an inferior description, for the service of Van Dieman's Land,
as well as a detention at Sydney of such mechanics as were
discovered in the ships on their first arrival there. This
appears both from the evidence of Mr. Humphrey, the police
magistrate at Hobart Town, as well as from a memorandum of
Governor Macquarrie to the superintendent Hutchinson, in which he
desires him to reserve for Van Dieman's Land a certain number of
able men from the convict ship "Chapman", as he conceives it to
be of no use to send weak and infirm men thither; an admonition
that could not have been required from the governor, if he had
not known that the practice had previously existed.</p>
<p>Such are the principles upon which the distribution of the
numerous convicts that have arrived in New South Wales has
generally been made; and before I proceed to describe the manner
in which the system is pursued at Van Dieman's Land, I think it
necessary to notice the want of attention that has prevailed,
until a very late period, at Sydney, to the circumstances of
those convicts who have been transported a second and a third
time. Although the knowledge of these facts is transmitted in the
hulk lists, or acquired without difficulty during the passage, it
never has occurred to Governor Macquarrie or to the
superintendent of convicts, to make any difference in the
condition of these men, not even to disappoint the views that
they may be supposed to have indulged by the success of a
criminal enterprize in England, and by transferring the fruits of
it to New South Wales.</p>
<p>To accomplish this very simple but important object, nothing
more was necessary than to consign these men to any situation
rather than that which their friends had selected for them, and
distinctly to declare in the presence of their comrades at the
first muster on their arrival, that no consideration or favour
would be shown to those who had violated the law a second time,
and that the mitigation of their sentences must be indefinitely
postponed.</p>
<p><a name="ch-16" id="ch-16"></a><b>Debarkation, muster and
distribution of convicts, in Van Dieman's Land.]</b></p>
<p>On the arrival of a convict ship at Hobart Town, as much
notice as possible is sent to the settlers, to enable them to
attend at the time of distribution, although the period between
their arrival and debarkation is generally very short. The same
reservation for mechanics is made for government, as there is at
Sydney; but with that exception the settlers are allowed to
select such men as, upon their own personal inquiry, will best
suit them.</p>
<p>The applications for convict labourers are invariably made to
the office of the lieutenant-governor; and that extensive
patronage and power of distribution, that at Sydney is shared
between the chief engineer and the superintendent of convicts, is
at Van Dieman's Land reserved in the hands of the
lieutenant-governor. A greater degree of method and regularity is
also observed at Hobart Town in the regulation of the convicts on
their first arrival; and the magistrate of police, Mr. Humphrey,
becomes immediately acquainted with the character and person of
each, and has established in his office, since the year 1817, a
system of perpetual reference and general control, that has been
found very useful in the detection of crime. A large share of
those duties, that at Sydney are but imperfectly performed by the
principal superintendent, have fallen into the hands of Mr.
Humphrey, magistrate of police, and Major Bell, the acting
engineer, by reason of the advanced age and incompetence of the
officer who holds the situation of superintendent at Hobart Town;
and the effects of their superior intelligence are very apparent
in the order and methodical arrangement with which this part of
the convict system is conducted. Unfortunately, from the want of
a place of reception on their first arrival, the convicts are
obliged to provide themselves with lodgings in the town, which
they pay for either by the produce of their labour in their extra
time, or by domestic services performed for their landlords.</p>
<p>The works carried on by government at Hobart Town, not
comprehending. agricultural establishments, or, until lately, the
construction of roads, the lieutenant-governor has never found it
necessary to retain the stronger and more useful labourers for
the service of government, and has shown a very commendable
disposition to assist the settlers on their arrival, or persons
engaged in useful undertakings, with mechanics from the
government gangs.</p>
<p>The selection, however, of the convicts, both by the
government and the settlers, proceeds, as at Sydney, altogether
upon their capacity for labour; although Major Bell, acting
engineer, is much disposed, from a few instances that have come
before him, to believe in the benefit that might be derived front
the selection founded upon better principles, and upon a
reference to former good conduct.</p>
<p><a name="ch-17" id="ch-17"></a><b><small>DISTRIBUTION OF
FEMALE CONVICTS.]</small></b></p>
<p>THE application for distribution of the female convicts is
regulated by different principles. Great difficulty is found in
preventing boats from hovering round the ships; but no person is
permitted to go on board without a pass from the superintendent.
This privilege is granted only to inquire for servants; and the
applications having been previously made to the superintendent,
the women are sent to their respective places of destination as
soon as the muster is completed.</p>
<p>The governor has not been in the habit of inspecting the
female convicts on their arrival, but a list of them and the
persons to whom they are assigned is constantly sent to him. Each
person who receives a female convict signs an indenture in which
he obliges himself, under a penalty of 201. to retain her in his
service for the space of three years, providing sufficient
subsistence, clothing, washing and lodging, and not to part with
her either directly or indirectly during the term, without the
approbation or authority of a magistrate, or in case of
misconduct proved and determined before him. Married female
convicts are assigned without such indenture to their husbands,
whether free or convict; and, in many cases; both receive tickets
of leave, as affording greater facilities of support.</p>
<p>The females likewise who bring property with them, or are
recommended by the captains or surgeons superintendent of the
ships, receive tickets of leave on their arrival. The
consequences of this indulgence are described by the principal
superintendent to give encouragement to improper intercourse
between the officers of the ships and the women, and to lead to
their cohabitation with individuals in Sydney that, not
unfrequently, terminates in marriage.</p>
<p>Those who are accompanied by children, are rarely taken by
settlers, and are sent to the factory at Paramatta. Indeed of
late it would appear by the evidence of the superintendent
Hutchinson, that a greater number of female convicts of every
description have arrived, than were required by the settlers of
New South Wales; and consequently those who were not sent to Van
Dieman's Land, were consigned to the factory at Paramatta.</p>
<p>In their passage thither from Sydney, which, according to the
evidence of Mr. Oakes, lasts from the morning till the evening,
if the wind be fair, and during the night if it be adverse, great
irregularities take place; and the women frequently arrive at
Paramatta in a state of intoxication, after being plundered of
such property as they may have brought from the ships with them,
during the time they stop at a public house on the shore of the
Paramatta river. They are accompanied by a constable in each
boat, who, in case of negligence, would be liable to be broke;
but this precaution does not prevent the existence of the
irregularities that it is meant to check.</p>

<h3>III.<br>
<i>Nature of the Employment of Convicts when retained in the
service of Government.</i></h3>
<p><small>I SHALL</small> now proceed to describe the manner in
which the convicts are lodged and employed when retained in the
service of government.</p>
<p>The construction of buildings in the towns of Sydney,
Paramatta, Windsor and Liverpool, has afforded constant
employment to a very large body of convicts, since the period of
Governor Macquarrie's command; and latterly, as the number of
buildings and the demand for materials has increased,
establishments have been formed near Sydney, where timber bus
been procured and cut, and lime has been burnt from the oyster
shells with which the rocks and shores of the Paramatta river
abound. Large quantities of both these materials have also been
imported from the settlement at Hunter's River, but as they were
not found sufficient for the consumption of the principal
settlement, other and nearer establishments were formed, at
Pennant Hills and Lane Cove. To these occupations have lately
been added two others, the making of roads and bridges, and the
clearing and cultivation of land.</p>
<p>The document R, No. 20, exhibits the number and description of
buildings and works that have been undertaken and finished since
the year 1810, or that are yet in progress at the several
settlements in New South Wales and Van Dieman's Land, as well as
the dates of their completion; and it appears by the document A.
No. 29. that out of 11,767 male convicts that have arrived in New
South Wales only, from the 1st January 1814 to the 29th December
1820, 4,587 have been taken by government; and that out of this
number, 1,587 were mechanics, and 3,000 were labourers. In the
number of mechanics have been included 30 farming men, and in the
class of labourers 140 boys, all of whom arrived in the year
1820.</p>
<p>In the month of August in the year 1819, the number of
mechanics, labourers and overseers employed in the settlements of
New South Wales and receiving rations, exclusive of those at
Hunter's River, and of the women employed at the Paramatta
factory, amounted to 2,613, and in the year 1820, this number was
augmented to 3,275. The document A. No. 77, exhibits the number
and description of the several mechanics and labourers employed
at each settlement, as well as the number of overseers and clerks
that were required for their superintendence and management;
those at Sydney alone amounting in the year 1819 to 1,395 and in
the year 1820 to 1,524.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the convict barrack at Sydney, in
the month of June 1819, a considerable number of convicts,
varying, and gradually increasing from 600 to 1,000, have been
lodged there. Previous to this period, there existed no place
either of lodging or temporary confinement for any of them; and
after the inspection of those that had newly arrived was
concluded, they were told by the principal superintendent "to go
and provide lodging where they could for the remainder of the
day, and to come to their work in the morning." All the
government labourers and convicts, at this period, were allowed
to leave their work at three o'clock every day, and were enabled
by their own labour to pay for their weekly lodgings and washing.
Those who are now permitted to remain out of barrack, are
compelled to work the whole of the day, but are allowed to employ
themselves after the hours of government work, and on the whole
of Saturdays, for their own benefit. The number of this
description amounted, on the 11th December 1st, to 594, and the
indulgence is granted to the best-conducted men, to dime who are
married and have families, and to those who cohabit with female
convicts and have children to support.</p>
<p>As the number of convicts increased in the year 1820 beyond
the capacity of the convict barrack to contain them, the
indulgence has been necessarily much extended, and without the
discrimination or which it was formerly susceptible. The chief
engineer and the principal superintendent of convicts, both
exercise the power of ordering a convict into the barrack by way
of punishment; and the Name power is likewise exercised by the
magistrates at Sydney.</p>
<p>A barrack was constructed in the latter part of the year 1819,
at a place called the Brick Fields, on the entrance to the town
of Sydney from Paramatta, capable of containing 180 convicts. The
principal object proposed in this building, was to fix those who
were employed in taking care of the horses carts, and bullocks,
near the place where they were kept, and it is called the carters
barrack.</p>
<p>Attached to this building, are stables for 90 horses, and
offices of every description; and latterly have been added
separate barracks for boys, and a small yard for coarse
carpenters, smiths and wheelwrights work.</p>
<p>A small house near the dock yard affords lodging to a few of
the convicts employed in the navigation of the government boats;
and these three buildings comprise the whole of the accommodation
that is at present afforded by government to the convicts in its
employ at Sydney.</p>
<p>The convict barrack is built at the north-east end of a large
open space of ground called Hyde Park, and is inclosed by a wall
of 10 feet high, that separates it on the north from the hospital
ground and the pleasure grounds attached to the government house,
and towards the south and west from Hyde Park. On each side of
the entrance, that is towards the west, are two small lodges 12
feet square, occupied by a clerk and constable; and in the centre
of an area, not sufficiently large for the numerous buildings and
offices that range along the interior of the walls, is the
principal barrack. It is a handsome brick structure, 130 feet in
length and 50 in breadth, and contains three stories, that arc
each divided by a lofty passage, separating one range of sleeping
rooms from the other. There are four rooms on each floor, and of
these six are 35 feet by 19, and the six others are 65 feet by
19. In each room, rows of hammocks are slung to strong wooden
rails, supported by upright stauncheons fixed to the floor and
roofs. Twenty inches, or two feet in breadth and seven feet in
length are allowed for each hammock; and the two rows are
separated from each other by a small passage of three feet.
Seventy men sleep in each of the long rooms, and thirty-five in
the small ones. Access to each floor is afforded by two
staircases, placed in the centre of the building; and the
ventilation even in the warmest seasons is well maintained. The
doors of the sleeping rooms, and those communicating with the
court yard, are not locked during the night. One wardsman is
appointed to each room, who is responsible for the conduct of the
others. Two watchmen and a constable arc charged with the care of
the yard gate. Each room of the dormitory contains fireplaces,
but they have not hitherto been used, except in the rooms of the
ground floor. A lamp is allowed to be burnt in each gallery
during the night. Another dormitory is provided in one of the
long buildings, on the north side of the yard, So feet in length
by 17, in which the convicts lately arrived, and those returned
into barrack by order of the magistrates are lodged. They sleep
on the mattresses that are brought from the convict ships, and
spread them upon raised and sloping platforms of wood similar to
those used in military guard rooms. The convicts employed in the
kitchens and bakehouse are allowed to hang their hammocks
there.</p>
<p>The house of the superintendent of the barrack is on the
ground floor, and in the centre of the range of buildings
attached to the northern wall. Below his house, and in a line
with it, are the baking and store rooms; and at each end of the
same wall, there are two apartments measuring 19 feet by 21, and
containing live-cells measuring seven feet by four, for the
solitary confinement of refractory prisoners. In the range of
building attached to the opposite and south wall, are two long
mess-rooms, containing tables and forms, at each of which six men
may be seated, and between these rooms are the kitchens. In
addition to these accommodations three large open and spacious
sheds have been erected, on the east and western ends of the
wall, where the men assemble before they go to rest, and where
they can make fires during the winter.</p>
<p>Since the barrack was first established, the drainage of the
yard, and the situation of the privies, that were at first
detective, have been improved; and a well has been sunk, and
washhouses and a drying shed have been erected in a yard below
the area I of the barrack.</p>
<p>The style of architecture, in which the body of this building
has been designed, is simple and handsome, and the execution of
the work is solid, and promises to be durable. The roof is
covered with shingles, which, from want of selection and care in
working up, and from the slight inclination given to them, are
found to admit the rain during the prevalence of bad weather, and
of storms of wind from the south and south-west.</p>
<p>The great defect in the plan of the offices is want of space
an height, and their projection in an area where not less than
1,000 men are collected together.</p>
<p>The external walls likewise, which are of stone, and only in I
feet high, are executed in a style much too ornamental for the
character as well as destination of the principal building; and
in their dimensions, the leading object of security has been
sacrificed to that of exhibiting with advantage and effect the
regular proportion of the building that they inclose.</p>
<p>In other respects the convict barrack, as long as the system
of retaining a large body of convicts in the town of Sydney is
continued, will be found a useful and healthy place of lodging;
and whenever that destination ceases to be given to it, it is
very capable of being converted into a military barrack or an
hospital.</p>
<p>The carters barrack is situated on the road that leads from
Hyde Park, through the brickfields, to the Paramatta road, and
forms at present one of the suburbs of the town of Sydney on the
south-west. The principal building, which is of brick, and of two
stories, fronts the road, and is separated from it by an
ornamental railing and wall, only four feet in height from the
ground: the windows of all the rooms have the same aspect, and
are secured with iron bars on the inside. The principal entrance
is from a yard, in which sheds have been constructed for the men
to remain in before they go to rest, and two cells for solitary
confinement: this yard is separated by a high wall from the
stables on one side, and from a yard on the other, in which
barracks have lately been erected for the accommodation of the
boys.</p>
<p>The ground floor of the principal building contains, on one
side of the entrance a large mess-room, at which 162 persons can
be seated, in messes of six; and on the other, a room for the
separate use of the horsekeepers, who are 18 in number.</p>
<p>Two ranges of bed-places, with mattrasses, are raised on one
side of this room; and on the opposite are mess-tables, to which
the men are allowed to have access whenever their labour is
finished: beyond this apartment is a store-room and wash-house.
The upper story contains two sleeping-rooms of equal dimensions;
in one of which 8 hammocks are hung, and in the other 70: they
are disposed in the same manner as in the convict barrack in Hyde
Park; but in one of the rooms, that contained 85 hammocks, 15
were hung upon the upper row. Between these two apartments is one
allotted to the overseers, three of whom sleep in it. On the
upper side of the second yard are three rooms, which are
constructed purposely for the separate accommodation of the
convict boys, and in which an attempt has been made to class
them; one room is allotted for those who misconduct themselves,
and both their diet and their bedding are inferior to that of the
first class. The fitting of the rooms is the same in all:
mess-tables and forms are placed in front, and near the windows;
and along the back wall is a double tier of cribs, with sloping
floors. In the two rooms of the first class 6 boys were lodged
and fed in messes, composed of eight: they are allowed mattresses
and blankets, have tea for breakfast, and, in addition to their
pound of bread and meat, are allowed soup for dinner. The boys of
the second clan receive a single ration only, consisting of one
pound of meat and bread per day, and sleep on boards, with a thin
India blanket.</p>
<p>In the same yard is the kitchen, in which the food of all the
convicts of the carters barrack is cooked; a house for two
overseers; eight solitary cells, for the confinement of the boys,
that are badly ventilated; a shed, and fire-place, and privies.
At one end of these privies, and aligning with the road, are the
stables, that contain eighty-two stalls, an hospital stable, a
room for constables and overseers, a saddle and harness room, and
a corn room, with a machine for bruising it; to these are
attached a yard, with long sheds for the bullocks, a paddock of
three acres, and four acres of garden ground; at the opposite end
is a yard, containing workshops for carpenters, wheelwrights,
harness makers, joiners, blacksmiths and Hailers.</p>
<p>The convict barrack at Paramatta is constructed very nearly
upon the same plan and dimensions as that of the carters barrack
just described, except that the kitchen is in one of the rooms on
the ground floor, and diffuses a great degree of heat and vapour
through the body of the building.</p>
<p>The convict barrack at Windsor is nearly on the same plan; but
the lodging rooms will have greater elevation than those of the
Paramatta and carters barrack, and the kitchen will be detached
from the body of the house.</p>
<p>The object proposed in the construction of the carters barrack
was, in the first instance, to bring that particular class of
convicts nearer to the place of their employment, and the care of
their horses and carts and, latterly, to provide a separate place
of lodging and messing for the convict boys. The building was
expeditiously finished, under the direction of the present chief
engineer; and although it is defective in means of ventilation,
mid that the want of elevation in the walls of the principal
building has rendered the staircase inconvenient, it at present
sufficiently answers the purposes for which it was intended. The
whole of the establishment is placed under the superintendence of
an overseer named William Orrell, an emancipated convict, who
resides in a house detached from the building, and in the centre
of the garden. The offices, palings and gateway entrances are
more ornamental and expensive than the purposes of the
establishment required, but the greatest order and cleanliness
prevails in every part of it; and from the number of convicts not
having yet exceeded the means of superintendence or
accommodation, and from the particular attention bestowed upon it
by the chief engineer and the superintendent Orrell, the carters
barrack may be considered as the best conducted of all the
convict establishments in New South Wales.</p>
<p>Independent of the public labour that is carried on at the
towns of Sydney, Paramatta, Windsor and Bathurst, there are three
agricultural establishments in New South Wales in which the
convicts are employed; namely, Grose Farm, Longbottom, and Emu
Plains.</p>
<p>The first of these consists of 280 acres of land that were
granted by Governor King to trustees for the benefit of the
female orphans, and that have been since sun; rendered by them to
government, upon an understanding that the trustees were to
receive, in exchange, an equal quantity in any other part of the
colony that they might select. The land is bounded on the north
by the high road to Paramatta, and is situated about two miles
from Sydney. The use to which it was first applied was that of
affording pasturage for the horses and draught cattle employed in
the works at Sydney; latterly, and since the early it of 1819,
the land, which is of a very inferior description, has been
gradually cleared of trees and stumps, farm-buildings have been
erected, and the old dwelling houses enlarged. Sleeping-rooms for
160 men and boys, with airing sheds of brick, have been
constructed; and much. pains have been taken to form a series of
tanks, by deepening and widening the course of a small rivulet
that traverses a portion of the farm, and in making a reservoir
of water in the lowest part, where it adjoins the public road.
Gardens, for the use of the convicts, have been laid out on the
banks, and have been made very productive, in the common kinds of
vegetables; the old fence that surrounded the farm has been
nearly removed, and, in its place, a very strong and well-made
four-railed fence has been nearly completed. Within the last two
years attempts have been made to exhibit, in this farm, several
of the processes of English husbandry, and no means have been
spared, either by the selection of the best labourers, or by the
most abundant supply of implements, materials and manure, to
insure their success. The farm is placed under the immediate
superintendence of a convict named Ebenezer Knox, who acquired
his knowledge of agriculture in one of the southern counties of
Scotland; but the direction of the operations has been wholly in
the hands of Major Druitt, the chief engineer. Time produce of
the farm has been chiefly consumed as green food for the draught
cattle that are employed at Sydney and although in this respect
the film has been of use, and has exhibited as well as taught
more approved modes of agriculture than have hitherto been
practised by the settlers in New South Vales, more especially
that very useful one of eradicating the stumps and roots of
trees, by covering them with green sods of earth and setting fire
to them, yet the intrinsic value of the operations has been
diminished by the injudicious precipitation, with which they have
been conducted.</p>
<p>For the purpose of affording a larger range of pasturage, and
better food to the draught cattle, a small farm called
Canterbury, comprising 50 acres that were cleared some time ago,
and in which some white clover had been mixed with the natural
grasses of the country, was hired of Mr. Campbell, and the rent,
amounting to 50<i>l</i>. per annum; paid from the police fund. At
this place 11 convicts were, till lately, lodged and employed in
attending the cattle, and in driving them to and from Sydney.
Nearly 40 tons of very good hay were nude on the cleared part of
the land last year; and, considering the number of cattle and
horses employed at Sydney, and the difficulty of feeding them at
certain periods of the year, the establishment at Canterbury was
useful. The occupation of it, on account of government, was to
cease in the month of May 1821.</p>
<p>Besides the agricultural establishment at Grose Farm, there
are two others of the same nature that were formed in the course
of the year 1819; one at Longbottom, on the Paramatta road, and
ten miles from Sydney; the other on a tract of alluvial land,
called Emu Plains, situate on the western bank of the river
Nepean, and at the base of the first ascent to the Blue
Mountains. The former of these comprises nearly 100 acres of
land, consisting of a portion that was ungranted, arid another
that has been since added by an exchange with the original
grantee. It contains some valuable timber, which is cut and sawn
upon the spot, and conveyed to Sydney in boats by the Paramatta
river, on the southern shore of which part of the farm of
Longbottom is situated. Charcoal for the forges and foundries is
likewise prepared here; and as the land is gradually cleared of
wood, the cultivation is extended under the direction of an
overseer, who was a convict, and has received his emancipation.
The number of men employed at Longbottom, amounted, in January
1821, to 110. This establishment is under the inspection of Major
Druitt, the chief engineer, who occasionally visits it. The
buildings consist of a house for the overseer, a barrack for the
men, an open shed and a fireplace, a mess-room, and stabling for
five horses. They are all constructed of wood, and covered with
shingles. With the exception of an ornamental lodge and gateway
that has been built at the entrance from the road, the buildings
at this establishment have been erected with a due regard to
economy, and the comfortable lodging of the convicts.</p>
<p>The establishment at Emu Plains is under the management of Mr.
Richard Fitzgerald, and was undertaken for the purpose of giving
employment to the numerous convicts that arrived in the year
1819, and that were not taken up by the settlers. Their numbers
have gradually increased from 120 to 269, and they are employed
in building their own huts, or those required by the
establishment; in cutting or bunting off timber, clearing the
land, and in cultivating it with wheat and maize. The river
Nepean, which is in some places very deep, divides the tract
called Emu Plains from the estate of Sir John Jamieson, and from
other cultivated lands on the opposite bank of the river; but the
road to Bathurst from Emu Ford and the Ferry, traverses the
plains in an oblique and inconvenient direction. The buildings at
Emu Plains consist of a small house for Mr. Fitzgerald and the
overseer, a store for the provisions, a quarter for the
commissariat clerk, and a barrack for the detachment of soldiers.
The convicts are lodged in cottages built of wood, or the bark of
the eucalyptus, mid one cottage of larger dimensions than the
rest is set apart for the sick. The numbers in each cottage vary
from. two to eight or ten, and every convict is allowed to have a
separate cottage and garden attached to it, if he chooses to
erect one. They sleep on wooden trellisses, raised nearly two
feet from the ground, and generally spread the mattrasses that
they bring with them from the convict ships on large pieces of
bark of the eucalyptus, which are very easily and quickly
detached from the tree.</p>
<p>Some of the cottages are substantially built, but they have
been allowed to be placed much too near each other.</p>
<p>From the superior quality of the land, the produce both of
maize and wheat, in the year 1820, was very abundant at Emu
Plains. The situation is healthy; and being separated, though not
effectually, by the course of the river Nepean, from the
neighbouring settlements, the convicts have fewer opportunities
of obtaining spirituous liquors, or communicating with other
convicts in their hours of leisure.</p>
<p>At Pennant Hills, on the northern shore of the Paramatta
river, and distant about seven miles from the town of Paramatta,
an establishment has been made for the purpose of supplying the
different works at Sydney with sawn timber and shingles for
roofing. The land from which the wood is cut belongs to Mr. John
and Mr. Hannibal M&#145;Arthur, who have not objected to the temporary
occupation of it, or to the appropriation of the timber.</p>
<p>Seventy-three men are employed at this station; and they are
chiefly sawyers, shingle-splitters, and basket-makers. They work
under cover, and are lodged in cottages or barracks of different
dimensions, which are simply but substantially constructed of
wood; but the floors ought to have been elevated above the
surface of the ground, instead of being depressed somewhat below
it. Some of the cottages are boarded, but all are substantial,
and provided with chimneys, built either of largo logs and rough
stone, with an iron bar and hooks laid across for culinary
purposes.</p>
<p>An overseer, by the name of Kelly, who is now free by
expiration of his term of service, superintends the
establishment; and the wood and shingles are conveyed in bullock
carts, from the station to the shore of the Paramatta river, a
distance of five miles, and from thence by water to Sydney. A
very decent chapel, capable of containing 150 persons, has
likewise been erected at Pennant Hills, by the overseer Kelly,
and a labouring carpenter, during their leisure hours. Divine
service is performed in it by a convict named Home, who was first
employed at Paramatta as a schoolmaster.</p>
<p>The erection of this chapel cost government nothing more Than
the cutting of the timber and the nails; and it was finished in
the space of six weeks. There is also, at Pennant Hills, a place
of temporary confinement for refractory convicts, constructed of
the same materials as the other buildings.</p>
<p>At Iron Cove, on the southern shore of the Paramatta river,
and about three miles from Sydney, there is an establishment of
27 convicts for gathering shells for lime.</p>
<p>They are tasked to procure a certain quantity every week, and
the shells are sent down by water in the government boats to
Sydney. The convicts at this establishment are lodged in wood
huts on the bank of the river, under the superintendence of an
overseer.</p>
<p>Since the improvement of the roads and bridges was undertaken
by Major Druitt, the chief engineer, in the year 1819, several
gangs of convicts, amounting in the month of November 1819 to
362, under the superintendence of overseers, have been employed
in this service. The gangs vary from 30 to 60 each; and as their
work proceeds, they remove their huts, which are always
constructed of the branches and bark of the eucalyptus, from one
station to another. This operation is attended with very little
difficulty and no expense. The circumstances that rendered this
labour necessary so soon after the formation of the roads and
bridges, will be mentioned hereafter; at present, it consists
sometimes in giving a new direction to the whole line of roads,
clearing away the stumps that had been left by the former
contractors, seeking for and conveying materials front the
adjoining land, and cutting and carrying heavy timber and logs
for the bridges and swampy places.</p>
<p>The convicts in the employ of government at Paramatta, are now
either lodged in the new convict barrack, or in houses of their
own in the town. The former building is capable of containing 130
men when the hammocks are slung in single tiers only, and is
built after the plan of the carters barrack at Sydney, except
that it is inclosed by a high wall towards the street, that also
surrounds a yard for the employment of the mechanics, immediately
behind.</p>
<p>The number of convicts employed at Paramatta amounted in the
month of September 1820 to 225, and of these 130 were generally
lodged in the barrack; the rest were permitted to live in the
town, excepting a party consisting of 22, that were hutted in
some buildings of the government domain, where they were employed
in taking up roots of trees and clearing the timber; and a party
of eight, that were hutted and employed in a similar manner, in
the lands adjoining the female orphan school.</p>
<p>At the towns of Windsor and Liverpool a certain number of
convicts have been employed in the construction of the government
works that have been conducted there; and those at Windsor in the
month of December 1820, amounted to 92, and at Liverpool to 42.
The former are under the direction of Mr. Richard Fitzgerald, and
are hutted in small buildings near the church, (in the
construction of which they are employed), and in two very
indifferent cottages at the entrance of the town of Windsor, one
of which belongs to Mr. Fitzgerald, and for which he has received
rent from the police fund; the other belongs to government, and
will cease to be occupied when the convict barrack at Windsor is
completed.</p>
<p>The convicts at Liverpool are placed under the gratuitous
management of Mr. Moore of that place, and are hutted in small
tenements near the town. Those at Bathurst are lodged in cottages
built of turf and brick, and are under the direction of a
superintendent, who acts under the orders of the military
commandant lieutenant Lawson. In the month of November 1820, the
number of convicts at Bathurst amounted to fifty.</p>
<p>It has already been remarked, that at Hobart Town, in Van
Diemen's Land, the convicts in the employ of government are, with
the exception of a small and incommodious house, containing two
rooms, and in which the worst characters are allowed to obtain
their lodgings in the town where they can, paying for them by
their earnings, or by domestic services performed; their number
amounted in March 1820, to 470. Those at George Town are lodged
in small cottages, built by themselves; but as they have
consisted latterly of the worst description of convicts, with the
exception of the mechanics originally sent to forward the works
in 1816, the cottages are few in number, and badly
constructed.</p>
<p>I shall now proceed to describe the nature and effect of the
different kinds of convict labour performed at Sydney, and in the
other parts of New South Wales and Van Dieman's Land; with a
detail of the superintendence, value, and expense attending
it.</p>
<p>The able bodied men, who are lodged in the convict barrack and
carters barrack it at Sydney, are divided into gangs, and are
employed in the lumber yard there, or in quarries, and in
different works that are going on in and near the town. They are
mustered by the overseers in the barracks at half past four in
summer, and at daylight in winter, and are marched to their place
of employment. William Hutchinson, the principal superintendent,
attends at the first muster of the gangs in the convict barrack,
and gives orders for any alterations in the number or disposition
of them that he may have concerted previously with Major Druitt,
the chief engineer. The sick and lame are sent to the hospital to
be examined, and if the cases are only suspicious, the convicts
are confined in a wooden building, within the walls of the
hospital, till the middle of the day, and if they require
inspection and medicine, without confinement, they are sent to
rejoin their gangs; a list of the convicts exempted from labour
being sent daily, at eight o'clock, by the assistant-surgeon on
duty, to the principal superintendent's office in the lumber
yard.</p>
<p>The convict boys are now marched from the carters barrack to
the several places of employment, in the lumber yard and dock
yard, and except in the hours of labour, are separated from the
men. The convicts that are aged and infirm, are employed in light
work about the barrack, or in the government grounds and garden.
At nine o'clock in summer, the whole are marched back to their
barracks tor breakfast, for which they are allowed one hour, and
the same time at dinner; and in the evening they return to the
barrack at sunset, when they are again mustered by their
overseers. During the winter the convicts are made to breakfast
before they proceed to their work in the morning.</p>
<p>The document A. No. 63, contains a nominal list of the
convicts employed in, and near Sydney, and receiving rations from
thence, and a description of their a trades, and the gangs to
which they have been distributed. The principal place of convict
labour in Sydney, is the lumber yard, a large space of ground now
walled-in, and extending from George-street to the edge of a
small stream that discharges itself into Sydney Cove. The trades
carried on in this place, are those of blacksmiths, locksmiths,
nailers, iron and brass founders, bellows makers, coopers,
sawyers, painters, lead casters, harness and collar makers,
tailors and shoemakers, carpenters, joiners, and cabinet makers.
All the different sheds in which the workmen are employed, front
towards the yard that they enclose, and in the centre, is
deposited the wood that is brought from Pennant Hills and
Newcastle, separated according to its size and dimensions. An
overseer superintends each class of labourers, and when they are
employed out of the lumber yard, and in large gangs, additional
overseers are appointed to assist them in that duty.</p>
<p>The dock yard likewise furnishes employment to a considerable
number of workmen, dither in the construction of the quays, or in
the building and naval equipment of boats and small vessels. The
gaol gang are generally employed at this place, in unloading the
cargoes of the colonial vessels, and in delivering them on the
quays of the dock yard, and they are made to work in chains.
Considerable additions have lately been made in the dock yard, by
the erection of two blacksmiths and nailers forges, a sail room
and boat house underneath, two saw pits, and a high stone wall
that now entirely separates the yard from the street, and from
the commissariat stores.</p>
<p>The stone-cutters gangs are very numerous, and are distributed
in five or six different places in and about Sydney, for the
purpose of raising and quarrying stone as near as it call be
procured to the buildings. There is one principal overseer of
these gangs, and others are allowed for more immediate and
constant superintendence. The carriage of materials from the dock
yards and quarries to the different buildings, occasions the
employment of not less than 69 men, including attendants and
horse-keepers; and three mounted overseers are constantly
employed in carrying directions to the cart-men for that purpose;
latterly, the carts employed in Sydney, amounting to 29, have
returned to the carters barrack at four or five o clock in the
evening, and the drivers are afterwards made to work in the
garden adjoining the barrack. Within the last year, several gangs
of convicts have been employed in levelling the streets of Sydney
and Paramatta, and in making brick drains at the intersections of
the streets.</p>
<p>Twelve boats, navigated and worked by 52 men, are in constant
employment on the Paramatta river and the adjoining inlets, in
procuring and conveying lime and wood from Pennant Hills to
Sydney, or stores to Paramatta.</p>
<p>Eight boats carrying six coxswains and 38 men, are daily
employed in cutting grass for the government horses and draught
cattle, and for the use of the governor's horses during his
residence at Sydney. They are under the direction of Barnard
Williams, coxswain of the governor's barge, who lives in a house
that belongs to government on the shore of Sydney Cove, and
adjoining the dock yard. The grass-cutters and boats crews are
mustered by him on their return from their work, and from the
nature of it are obliged to leave Sydney at irregular hours,
varied and governed by the state of the tides and wind. Those of
the grass-cutters that are well conducted, are allowed to lodge
in the town, and after they have procured the quantity that is
given as a task to each man, they are allowed to dispose of the
surplus for themselves; those likewise who have been able to
furnish on the Fridays the quantity required for that day and the
Saturday, are allowed the use of the government boats to procure
it for themselves on the Saturday, and to sell it, in the town.
The daily task to the grass-cutters has been raised lately from
40 to 60 bundles of grass for each man, and it is procured on the
banks of the Paramatta river, or the tracts of unoccupied land
adjoining. Out of the number of grass cutters above-mentioned,
there are six that are allowed to procure grass for such of the
officers of the regiment in garrison as keep horses. They are
borne on the regimental books as civil servants, and receive
rations as such. With two exceptions, the men who are selected
for this service, on account of their good behaviour, do not live
in the barracks, they are merely employed for supplying grass for
the horses of the officer to whom they are assigned, and after
delivering it they are entirely at their own disposal for the
remainder of the day. In addition to the number of boats crews
already mentioned, four men are allowed for the use of the chief
engineer's boat in Sydney Cove, six for the use of the naval
office, eight for the row-guard, and three small boats are in
constant employment about the dock yard and harbour, making a
total of 120 men.</p>
<p>The nature of the work allotted to the government convicts at
the towns of Paramatta, Liverpool, and Windsor, differs very
little from that which exists at Sydney, and this observation
equally applies to the labour of the convicts in the service of
government at Hobart Town, and George Town, in Van Dieman's
Land.</p>
<p>The chief engineer at Sydney has the direction of all the
public works carried on, in the settlements of New South Wales,
and receives the orders of the governor to commence and execute
them. The office of chief engineer has existed for a considerable
period, but it was not till the time of Captain Gill, an officer
of the 46th regiment, that the importance of the situation began
to be perceived, by the enlarged extent of duties that he was
called upon to perform. None of the persons who filled this
office having possessed any knowledge of architecture or
mechanics, their duties, in the first instance, were limited to
the collection and preparation of materials, the distribution of
stores and tools, and the care of all the government property
employed in the public works. The buildings in Sydney that were
erected by government previous to the time of Captain Gill, were,
with the exception of the official residence of the governor's
secretary, of very simple construction; and it was not until the
arrival of Mr. Francis Greenway, that any successful attempt was
made to extend their scale and character. Since his appointment
to the situation of colonial architect, in the year 1815, designs
have been furnished by him for several; of the public buildings,
and he has superintended their progress, signifying to the chief
engineer, from time to time, the materials that were required.
Governor Macquarrie has however availed himself of the voluntary
assistance of Lieutenant Watts of the 46th regiment, his
aide-de-camp, who furnished designs for the new military
barracks, and the hospital at Paramatta; two steeples to the
church at Paramatta, and for the military hospital at Sydney. He
also undertook the superintendence of the first repairs of the
road to Paramatta, and the bridges upon it, and the construction
of a large dam in the Paramatta river, for the purpose of
preserving a supply of fresh water for the use of the
inhabitants, and preventing any admixture of salt water from the
rising of the tide.</p>
<p>In the course of the years 1819 and 1820, the carters barrack
at Sydney, the convict barrack at Paramatta, the asylum at
Sydney, and a considerable extent of plain walling have been
constructed under the direction of Major Druitt, the present
chief engineer, from plans or working drawings, furnished by the
overseers of bricklayers. The operations of the dock yard have
likewise at all times been placed under the direction of the same
officer, and continued to be so till the end of the year 1820,
when, in consequence of observing their daily increase and
importance, and that they required a greater portion of nautical
skill than an officer of the land service could possibly possess,
I recommended to Governor Macquarrie to appoint Mr. John
Nicholson, a master of the navy on half-pay, to the office of
master attendant of the dock yard at Sydney, with all the powers
that were possessed by Major Druitt, the chief engineer in that
department, and including the police of the harbour. To this
recommendation the governor immediately acceded, and was farther
Pleased to annex to the appointment a salary of 100<i>l</i>. per
annum, payable from the police fund, as well as the situation of
harbour master.</p>
<p>The variety of work carried on at Sydney is described by Major
Druitt in his evidence, and it appears that task work is allotted
to every convict, where such an arrangement is practicable. Since
the appointment of that officer in the year 1819, the quantity of
task work has been increased to the nail-makers, brick-makers,
stone-cutters and sawyers, and it has been an object with him to
raise it, as nearly as he could, to the extent that an able
bodied man can perform in a day, and within the hour appointed
for the cessation of government work, and this plan has, in some
species of labour, been found to be practicable; but it is
adopted more for the purpose of securing and ascertaining that a
certain quantity of labour is performed, than, of stimulating the
quicker performance of it by the hope of reward; for although the
task may be performed before the appointed hour, the workman is
not allowed to retire, either to the barrack or to his own home,
but remains in the lumber yard till the expiration of the hours
of work, and if the allotted task be not accomplished in that
time, the chief engineer has the power of ordering the defaulter
to work on it Saturdays after ten o'clock. The same system was
enforced at Pennant Hills amongst the sawyers, in the year 1819,
when the working ration of the convicts in the service of the
government was raised, at Sydney, from one pound to a pound and a
half of meat and flour per day; and the resistance of the sawyers
to this augmentation of their labour, as described Druitt, by
Major Druitt, was such as to require from him very prompt and
vigorous measures for its suppression. The alledged motive of
their resistance was the insufficiency of the augmented ration,
although they now continue to perform the augmented task of
cutting 700 feet of wood per week, and are able to finish it, if
they work well, on the fourth day. They are then permitted to
work on their own account for the settlers in the neighbourhood.
In the labour of road making, the appointment of task work is
rarely practicable, on account of the variations of the nature of
the soil and surface, and in the quantity of timber that covers
the greatest part of the tract denominated the county of
Cumberland. An attempt has been made by Ford, one of the best and
most experienced of the overseers employed in road making, to fix
the extent of road that thirty men, with six carts, should
accomplish in two months, on the first line of road between
Paramatta and Windsor; but this estimate cannot, for obvious
reasons, be applied to other lines or portions even of the same
road. Under these circumstances, it is found more expedient to
fix a daily quantity of labour proportionate to the difficulties
and obstructions that occur, and to punish the non-performance of
such a task, than to trust to the vigilance of overseers in
keeping the men to the performance of an undeterminate quantity
on a long line of road, and to various operations in it. At Emu
Plains, each labourer is required to fell the timber on an acre
of land in the course of a week; and in burning it off; he is
required to perform ten rods per day. Governor Macquarrie has
however entertained a general objection to the employment of
convicts in task work, preferring that they should be made to
work the whole of the day, and allowing a sufficient time for
their meals, and the whole of Saturday for the cultivation of
their garden grounds. Under the superintendence of the works at
Sydney by Captain Gill, the principal part was done by task work,
as is the case at present at Hobart Town, in Van Dieman's Land.
Both at that station and at Sydney, however, the evils of such a
system have been very apparent, and it was not till the
establishment of the convict barrack at the latter town, in the
month of June 1819, that they admitted of a remedy. As, previous
to that period, neither washing nor lodging were provided for the
convicts, they were allowed to work from three o'clock every day
on their own account. There was thus neither restraint nor
control over them, and although the government task was
quickened, yet the profits that the convicts made by their own
labour, were too frequently spent in dissipation and profligacy.
The confinement of a large portion of the government labourers in
the convict barrack has afforded a partial remedy to these evils;
but there are still a great many of the government convicts that
are allowed to live out of barracks, to whom nearly the whole of
Saturday is allowed for labour on their own account. This
indulgence is professed to be extended to men of good character
only, and who have families to support; it is however extended to
a great many mechanics who have no families, and to some who are
living with women, and have children by them; and it is an
indulgence which, when forfeited, as it frequently and
necessarily is, by the misconduct of the men, and punished by
their confinement in the convict barrack, or by the appropriation
of their labour on the Saturdays to the government, deprives the
women of support, and drives them to the necessity of making some
new connexion for their subsistence. Major Druitt is also of
opinion, that it would be very desirable, if possible, to
accommodate all the government convicts in the barrack, both on
account of their more regular subsistence, and their moral
conduct.</p>
<p>On the first change of the system of lodging the convicts at
Sydney in a barrack, Governor Macquarrie, by the 13th article of
the regulations that he drew up for that establishment, allowed
the prisoners who were lodged in it the privilege of working on
Saturdays for their own benefit; a short experience of this
indulgence has proved its inexpediency. Mr. Wentworth, indeed,
the police magistrate, had foreseen its bad consequence, and
advised against it, but the difficulty of releasing one portion
of convicts from labour to which the others were confined, the
necessary employment of the overseers on the Saturday mornings,
in drawing rations for the men who are out of barracks, and a
wish to mitigate, in the first instance, the hardships of a
restraint that was altogether new in the colony, induced Governor
Macquarrie to afford the indulgence of Saturdays to the
government convicts, in the hope that their labour might be
useful to the inhabitants of Sydney, and that the convicts might
equally derive benefit from it in the purchase of tobacco and
comforts not allowed them by government. This indulgence,
however, as well as the hours allowed on Sunday, which are from
one o'clock till sunset, are found to be productive of great
injury to the convicts, as well as to the police of Sydney, for
upon being let out of the barracks they resort to a particular
part of the town called the Rocks, a place distinguished, as
Major Druitt observes, for the practice of every debauchery and
villainy, or loiter about the streets to the great annoyance of
the inhabitants, and pass their time in gambling and riot; the
indulgence, therefore, has lately been limited to those convicts
only who were known to apply it to a good purpose, and any of
them found loitering in the streets, have been immediately sent
to work in the lumber yard.</p>
<p>The effect of this change of system, moreover, upon the
quantity of labour performed for government, soon became a
subject of observation, and a considerable difference of opinion
arose respecting it between the chief engineer and the colonial
architect, Mr. Greenway. Upon the increase of the government
ration, and the appropriation of the whole of every day, except
Saturday, to government work, it became the object of the former
to secure for government the performance of as much labour of
every kind from the convicts as the system of superintendence and
coercion, now prevailing in the colony, would admit. He has
greatly enlarged its variety; and in the coarser branches of
laborious employment, he has succeeded in increasing the
quantities performed. With better superintendence, and a more
methodical and regular calculation of the labour performed, Major
Druitt would have been able to have distinguished the merit of
individual labourers, and to have, produced that spirit of
emulation amongst them by rewards, which, as long as the
restrictive system prevails, is the only motive to personal
exertion. The great variety of works carried on at the same time,
their dispersion, and the predilection of the chief engineer for
the agricultural experiments at Grose Farm, have all contributed
to embarrass and distract his attention from any effectual
attempt to combine moral improvement with the labour performed
for government, if indeed the local impediments presented to such
an object by the town of Sydney did not render the attempt nearly
hopeless.</p>
<p>The labour, it has been observed, required by the chief
engineer from the government convicts, is in its nature purely
coercive; they derive no advantage from it, and have no interest
in improving or augmenting it: they have not even the ordinary
incentive held out to other convicts, from the hope, or rather
the expectation, of a remission of their punishment at the
periods at which they are granted to others; and they are well
aware, that any skill that they may acquire or display in the
service of government, will be the cause of their further
detention in it. From the nature of the superintendence under
which it is carried on, and the difficulty of procuring better,
no accurate information is afforded of the progress that is made.
A weekly report of the work performed by each gang of labourers
is made by the overseers to the superintendent of convicts,
William Hutchinson, and transmitted by the chief engineer to the
governor: this document describes the nature of the works in
which the convicts have been employed, during a given period; but
exhibits no statement of quantities, except in the articles of
timber and nails. A report of the quantities of mason and brick
work, and carpenters work, and of the number of men employed in
each, was for some time made by the several overseers of those
works, to Mr. Greenway; and it was his duty to measure it, and to
observe whether it was properly executed, reporting his
observations to the chief engineer, who, after submitting them to
the governor, proceeded to punish the men or the overseers, if
the work was declared to be insufficient. From the ornamental
nature, and difficulty of the operations that followed the
introduction of a better style of architecture, and a more solid
mode of construction, into the public works in New South Wales,
after the appointment of Mr. Greenway to the office of colonial
architect, it frequently occurred that he had to report
unfavourably of the work that was done, that it was to be altered
and reset, and that it became necessary to employ upon it the
best description of workmen. The chief engineer, who with the
superintendent of convicts had the distribution of the gangs, did
not always enter into the architectural views of Mr. Greenway;
and, from various pretexts, the men whom he had pointed out as
the best mechanics, and fixed at particular descriptions of work,
were removed, without his knowledge, to other places. He likewise
found, that the working plans that he had given in for some of
the earliest buildings had been purloined by the overseers; that
they were employed to erect buildings by contract for government,
the design and character of which were plainly derived from his,
though neither possessing their proportion, solidity, nor
convenience. Mortified by an interference in his own pursuits, by
persons to whom he had himself taught the first rudiments of
their art, and finding that he was not allowed to exercise any
control over the labourers or the works, Mr. Greenway seems to
have paid less attention than he ought to one important part of
his duty, the admeasurement of the work, and the superintendence
of its execution. Observing also the use and application that was
made of his working plans, he ceased altogether to furnish any;
and thence arose fresh mistakes of the overseers in the
dimensions of the buildings, and complaints on their part of his
repeated absence or insufficient direction. Governor Macquarrie
having at length observed the slow progress of the new stables at
Sydney, and being anxious to discover the cause, took an
opportunity of inquiring into it, in the presence of Major Druitt
and Mr. Greenway. The latter insisted that it was owing to the
defects of the system of government labour that he had pointed
out to Major Druitt, in his letters, dated 10th March and 14th
August 1819; and offered to prove to the governor, that if he
would allow him to select ten of the best stone-masons, and to
employ them exclusively in the cutting and finishing of the stone
work of one of the towers of the stables, and in fixing the
embrasures, which, according to the system then pursuing, had
cost the labour of thirty men for six weeks, he would venture to
accomplish it in one, by simply offering to the ten workmen as
much time for their own profit as they found that they could make
out of that week. The offer was accepted; and such was the
alacrity with which the men worked, that in three days and a half
the government task was finished, and they had the rest of the
week to work for themselves. It is necessary to add, that the
party of men that had been previously employed in the same work,
were not experienced workmen, and had been frequently removed
from it to others; and it is equally necessary to state, that
three of the ten workmen that had performed their task with such
expedition were brought before the magistrates, before the
expiration of the week, for drunkenness and misconduct.</p>
<p>In consequence of this experiment, a certain quantity of task
work, described by Mr. Greenway in his evidence; is now allotted
to the best description of masons, and if they perform the work
well, they are allowed some portion of the week or the day to
work on their own account. The objections generally entertained
by Governor Macquarrie, and by Major Druitt, to the system of
task work, arose from the generally imperfect performance of it,
and the preference naturally given by the convict to the work
from which he derives profit, and especially that species of
profit that was in his own control, and that would minister to
his vices and licentious habits. Major Druitt was equally
sensible of the little dependence that was to be placed upon the
integrity of the overseers, in the calculation or admeasurement
of the government task, or in exacting the whole and perfect
execution of it from the convicts. From the variety and extent of
the operations that were going on, no effectual performance of
this duty was practicable by himself, and as the overseers
themselves were allowed to conduct works in the town, both for
individuals and for government, in what was called their own
time, their interest was to en. large it by abridging that of
government, and by hurrying the government work, to employ the
convicts in labour of their own. Their interest was thus strongly
placed in opposition to their duty. Mr. Greenway was himself
actuated by considerations of the same kind. He had been employed
by several individuals in Sydney and in the colony, and from the
absolute monopoly of the skilful mechanics by government, it was
impossible, except on Saturdays, to obtain their labour. Any
system, therefore, that was likely to place the labour of these
convicts at the disposal of individuals during the week, was much
more likely to be satisfactory to Mr. Greenway, who was employed
by them; and at last, the question was nearly reduced to this,
whether government was likely to be better served by retaining
the whole of the labour of the convicts, that they fed and
maintained at an increased ration, though the labour was
conducted at a slower rate, in consequence of the taking away all
sources of profit to them, and all stimulus to its increase; or
by allowing them to divide their time for government and for
individuals, when maintained at a lower ration, to do as little
as they could for the former, and as much as possible for
themselves. Governor Macquarrie has adopted the former system
ever since the establishment of the convict barrack in the month
of June 1819, and if the superintendence of the government labour
had been as effectual as it was always his wish to have made it,
the confinement of the mechanics in the barrack, and the exaction
of the whole of their labour on every day of the week, would have
operated as a punishment, in as far as it deprived them of
opportunities of working for themselves, or from having free
access to the luxurious dissipation of the town of Sydney.
Conducted, however, as it is, from want of means of making it
more rigorous, it is a species of labour less fatiguing and less
irksome than the labour of convicts in the service of settlers,
and therefore it operates with them as a temptation to quit that
service and to repair to Sydney.</p>
<p>It has already been remarked, that it carried with it no
incitement either from advantages present or prospective; on the
other hand, the punishments for neglect or idleness are equally
defective. Major Druitt has indeed stated, that some particular
kinds of labour carried on at Sydney are more severe than others,
and that he reserves these for the punishment of the mutinous and
refractory; but it is also to be observed, that they are the
employments of the well conducted men also; and that men of this
description are removed to them from other gangs whenever the
wants of government require it. All punishments, moreover for
idleness or insolence to the overseers are necessarily placed in
their hands. It is upon their report only, upon their vigilance,
their integrity, and their discrimination, that effectual
punishment of idleness can alone be administered. It is equally
in their power to harrass the convicts by too much labour, as to
indulge them with a temporary absence from it, during the whole
or a portion of the day. The check upon the conduct of the
overseers in this last respect, afforded by the occasional visits
of Major Druitt, and the superintendent William Hutchinson, (the
only checks that they admit to exist) are by no means so
effectual as they imagine. The movements of the former, and his
occupations, were pretty generally known by the different gangs
in and about Sydney, and their mode of anticipating his visits,
or those of any person in authority, is acknowledged by him to
prevail equally amongst the convicts and the overseers. To the
force of this acknowledgment I can add my own testimony during a
period of six months residence in the town of Sydney, to the
inactivity of the gangs of workmen, whenever they thought that
they were unobserved, and the little dependence that is to be
placed in the overseers for correcting it.</p>
<p>To counterbalance these great disadvantages, the labour in the
government works at Sydney since the arrival of Mr. Greenway in
the colony, has undoubtedly tended to improve the practice of
several descriptions of workmen, who before that period were
devoid either of skill or instruction. In the art of
stone-cutting, brick-making, and brick-laying, there has been an
evident and striking improvement; and in almost every branch of
mechanical industry, attempts have been made to improve those
convicts who showed any disposition for it, as well as to
instruct several of the convict boys.</p>
<p>These observations apply to the system of government labour at
Sydney, considered merely as affording employment for a large
body of men; it will now he viewed in its character of
discipline, and as conducive to their moral conduct, reform and
security.</p>
<p><a name="ch-19" id="ch-19"></a><b>Discipline of the Convicts
in the service of the Government.]</b></p>
<p>It will have been observed, that the separation of the
convicts, whose offences or characters had been distinguished in
England for criminality, from those who brought official
recommendations of their conduct with them, formed no part of the
system upon which the distribution of the convicts proceeded in
the first instance. No approximation towards it has been
introduced or attempted in the subsequent stages of their
punishment, except amongst the boys, who have been classed, fed
and lodged according to their conduct in the colony since their
removal from the convict barrack to the carters barrack, in the
month of May 1820.</p>
<p>The association of so many depraved and desperate characters
in one place is an evil that is complained of even by the
convicts themselves; and although it might not have been
entirely, yet it might have been partially remedied on the
opening of the convict barrack, by placing the best conducted men
in one or more of the twelve sleeping rooms into which it is
distributed. Robberies amongst the convicts in tho barracks of
their clothes and bedding, and concealment of it, are very
frequent; and they are encouraged in these practices by the
facility with which they cast them over the barrack wall to
persons who are ready to receive them on the other side. To
remedy these evils, several expedients have been resorted to by
the chief engineer, such as searches of their persons at the
gate, and the painting of large letters and broad arrows on
different its of the dress; and these precautions have in some
measure diminished the great losses sustained in the clothing. It
was likewise the intention of Governor Macquarrie to have
surmounted the barrack wall with an iron paling, but the erection
of it was deferred on account of the high price of that
commodity, and the delay of its arrival from England.</p>
<p>It is somewhat extraordinary that instances of violence, or of
attempts to force the gate of the barrack, should not have
occurred more frequently, considering the temptations that exist
in the town of Sydney, and the general disposition to indulge in
them that is shown by the convicts whenever they have
opportunities. Absence from it on the nights of Saturday and
Sunday are frequent, and are punished by confinement to the
barrack on those days for certain periods. With these absences
are likewise combined offences committed in the town of Sydney,
of which a greater number is always brought before the police on
Mondays than on any other days in the week.</p>
<p>Major Druitt does not conceive that any danger to the colony
has arisen, or is likely to arise, from the confinement of so
many criminals in the same place. Conspiracies to cut out vessels
from the harbour, or to effect escape, are frequently made there;
but the accumulation of numbers seems rather to have afforded
means of timely detection, than of the perpetration of outrage;
and the chief engineer, and the superintendent, have always
depended upon the treachery of accomplices for information
respecting it, and have not been deceived in that expectation.
The security, indeed, arising from the treachery of the convicts
towards each other, is common to all establishments in which they
are collected together. It is not, however, against the
perpetration of offences committed in the barrack alone that
precaution is necessary; for on marching them to and from thence,
either to work or to church, it is found very difficult to
prevent them, especially the boys, from entering houses as they
go along, and from snatching at property and secreting it. The
houses of a number of seafaring men in the navigation of the
boats has also led to the engagement of themselves and others in
enterprizes of escape; and latterly, in some very desperate
attempts to surprize and cut out boats and vessels in the harbour
both of Port Jackson and Hobart Town.</p>
<p>From the great extent of the shores of the river Derwent, and
from the access and facilities that it affords both for the
refreshment of vessels and their employment in the whale fishery,
the temptation to these enterprizes have been more frequent
there, and latterly, more successful; and it has already been
observed, that in consequence of there being no barrack at Hobart
Town, the confinement of convicts, their control, after the hours
of government work, is more difficult than it is at present at
Sydney. The maritime positions indeed, of Sydney, unfit places
for the residence of convicts, as they multiply their temptations
to escape, and increase their punishments. They likewise raise
discontent in the minds of the industrious and well disposed
convicts by the revival of feelings, which the remote tiers of
their position would have a tendency gradually to suppress, and
they suggest to the desperate and the discontented perpetual
schemes of piratical plunder or of hazardous concealment. In the
last attempt to escape that occurred at Sydney, a great many
government mechanics were implicated, in consequence, no doubt,
of the solicitations that were used by the captain of the
American vessel (the General Gates) and of the opportunities that
he had enjoyed at Sydney not only of concerting and effecting
their escape, but of ascertaining, and indeed of witnessing in
the convict barrack the extent of their mechanical skill before
he ventured to engage them. No account or memoranda even of these
attempts, or the names of the convicts engaged in them, having
been kept by the principal superintendent at Sydney since his
appointment, it was not possible to ascertain whether any and
what particular description of them was more prone to make their
escape than another, but of those that took place during my stay
at Sydney and Hobart Town, a very large proportion were made by
convicts in the employ of government.</p>
<p>The defence made by these convicts when apprehended, very
naturally refers to the greater extent of compulsory service that
they are made to endure in the service of government, than is
allotted to any other description of convicts; not on account of
their crimes, but on account of their mechanical skill, or the
value of their services. This distinction, so prejudicial to the
real objects of discipline, has received some limitation in the
17th article of the regulations, made by Governor Macquarrie in
the month of June 1819, in which it was declared, that on the
expiration of four years passed in the service of government,
convicts who should have conducted themselves honestly, soberly,
and diligently during that time, should be entitled to receive
and should actually receive tickets of leave.</p>
<p>The convicts in the service of government are thus placed in a
worse situation than those in the service of a settler, to whom a
term of three years service is assigned by Governor Macquarrie's
regulations of the 9th January 1813.</p>
<p>It is satisfactory, however, to observe, that the principle of
limitation had been avowed and carried partially into effect; for
on referring to the documents, it will be found that out of 517
convict mechanics retained in the service of government in
January 1821, there were not more than 122 whose terms of service
had exceeded three years, and not more than 79 whose terms had
exceeded four years. It is, however, further to be observed, that
the principle by which the government convicts are retained in
its service, prior to their obtaining tickets of leave, is made
to apply to them after having received that indulgence; and
instances have occurred in which a particular class of tradesmen
or mechanics whose services were required by government, have
been recalled to its service when in possession of a ticket of
leave.</p>
<p>These cases have not been numerous of late, but their
occurrence tends to depreciate the value of the ticket of leave
as a reward for good conduct, and places the convict who holds it
too much at the mercy of a superintendent, who, under the
pretence of requiring his services for the government works, has
it in his power, by a temporary privation of the ticket of leave,
to inflict a severe punishment.</p>
<p>The punishments inflicted upon the convicts employed by
government, consist of confining those who lodge there to the
convict barrack on Saturdays and Sundays, or obliging them to
work on the former day; of work in the gaol gang, of confinement
in solitary cells, flogging, and transportation to the Coal
River. The chief engineer and the superintendent possess the
power of confining convicts to the barrack, imposing additional
or heavier labour upon them; and although the punishment of the
ordinary offences is committed to the magistrate of police, or a
bench of magistrates, yet it appears that in cases that seemed to
him to require very prompt interference, Governor Macquarrie has
proceeded to order and to authorize punishments by his warrant,
and upon the verbal report alone of the chief engineer; such was
the case iii the mutiny of the sawyers at Pennant Hills, who were
punished with one hundred lashes each; and on the discovery of a
conspiracy amongst a great many of the prisoners in the convict
barrack, to escape by the surprize of some vessels in the
harbour. In all other cases the offences of the government
convicts are brought before the magistrate of police, who sits
daily in one of the lower rooms of the convict barrack. The
examinations upon these occasions proceed upon sworn testimony,
and entries of the examinations are made in the police book:
serious offences committed by the government convicts are
reserved for the consideration of a bench of magistrates, who
meet once a week, or as occasion may require.</p>
<p>By reference to the returns of the offence's and punishments
that have been brought before the magistrates, it will be found
that a very considerable majority are committed by convicts in
the service of government. In the year commencing June 1819, and
ending June 1820, 139 men were punished for absence from barrack,
35 for stealing clothes and other articles out of it, and eight
for escaping over the wall. These punishments are exclusive of
those inflicted by the chief engineer and superintendent, in the
shape of confinement and extra labour, and which are very
numerous; indeed, so great was their increase in consequence of
the indulgence of Saturday and Sunday, that it has been usual
latterly to confine the worst characters to the barrack on those
days.</p>
<p>The punishment ordered in such cases by the governor's
regulations, for working the absentee convicts in the garden, had
not been in operation, as the wall that was to inclose it was not
begun till line 1820, and was not quite completed in the month of
February 1821.</p>
<p>The ground, consisting of four acres, on the east side of Hyde
Park, had been cleared and stumped, and a gardener's lodge,
containing two rooms, had been built in the centre.</p>
<p>The soil, however, of this garden is of the worst description;
and being almost entirely on the declivity of a bill, it will
require a great deal of manure and labour to make it productive;
but it possesses the advantage of being near the convict
barrack.</p>
<p>The corporal punishments of the government convicts were
formerly inflicted at the lumber yard, they are now inflicted at
the convict barrack, in the presence generally of the chief
engineer and the principal superintendent, and an assistant
surgeon, with more severity than at the period when the
government works were less extensively conducted, and the
convicts less numerous. The instruments of punishment are not so
heavy as those that are made use of in the army and navy; and as
the convicts found means, either by bribes or threats to the
flogger, to diminish their severity, a convict has been specially
appointed to the service, who lives constantly in the barrack,
and in a room adjoining the deputy superintendent's house. The
effect of these different kinds of punishments is stated by the
chief engineer to vary with the feelings and bodily habits and
strength of the convicts; and the punishment of the chain gang is
rightly described by him to be the least efficient, and most
prejudicial. The confinement of offenders to severe kinds of
labour would be effectual, but it could only be rendered so by
the superintendence of trustworthy overseers (whom it is most
difficult to find) as well as by a temporary sacrifice of mere
labour to the purposes of correction and punishment, objects as
has been observed before, that do not prevail in the system upon
which the government works at Sydney have been conducted.</p>
<p>The attendance of the convicts at places of worship has been
enforced to as great an extent as the accommodation in them would
allow.</p>
<p>At Sydney the convicts living out of barrack are mustered by
the chief engineer and principal superintendent on Sunday
mornings at the door of the church, and occupy the whole length
of the side gallery, which contains nearly 500. At eight o'clock
also on the Sunday mornings prayers are read, and a sermon is
preached by one of the chaplains at Sydney to the convicts in the
barrack, and in the evening the ticket-of-leave men and the
convicts at Sydney, not in the service of government, are
required to attend at church. In the evening of every Wednesday
also, prayers and a sermon are read to such of the convicts as
choose to attend, in one of the lower rooms of the convict
barrack. From its dimensions, the attendance here is necessarily
small, not exceeding 150; but it is stated by the Rev. Mr. Hill,
that the convicts who do attend are very orderly in their conduct
and deportment.</p>
<p>The government convicts at Paramatta and Windsor are regularly
mustered on Sundays, and attend church once a day, and since the
arrival of two Catholic clergymen in the colony, the convicts
professing that religion have been conducted by their overseers
from the barrack to the court house to attend mass, and a sermon
has been preached to them in the convict barrack. A similar
arrangement is made for them at the other stations when one of
the clergymen can make it convenient to attend. When the church
is completed that is now building in Hyde Park, the attendance of
all the convicts at a place of public worship may be easily
provided both on Sundays and on two or three more evenings of the
week. Those who now attend church on Sunday mornings are decently
dressed in their own clothes, and are punished if they are not
so; they are not provided with bibles or prayer books during the
service, and though they do not openly disturb it, the manifest
no attention to it. The principal superintendent, from the place
he occupies in the church, immediately below the gallery of the
convicts, can keep no observation on them; and the duties of the
preacher have sometimes been interrupted for the purpose of
checking irregularities in their conduct, which the presence or
the eye of the superintendent would have been sufficient to
control.</p>
<p>The service at the convict barrack is performed in the open
yard, in the presence of all the convicts who can obtain access
to it; some of them take part in singing the psalms, and
generally their conduct is decent and orderly. From want of any
sufficient deposit for their clothes or their property, the
distribution of bibles and books of prayer amongst these men
would be unavailing. A room in the barrack adjoining to the house
of the deputy superintendent is allotted for their clothes, but
is much too small for their present establishment, and is not
conducted with any regularity, partly in consequence of the
habits of the men, and partly from want of method and strictness
in the deputy superintendent. Several of the newly arrived
convicts have received presents of bibles and prayer books from
the surgeons of the different convict ships; and to those who are
well disposed, and have been in the habit of reading the
scriptures in their many hours of leisure during the passage,
such gifts are both acceptable and useful. I have observed,
however, that in the first marches to the different stations in
the country, they lose, and sometimes sell them for the purchase
of bread and liquor, and in general, it would be better that all
such gifts should be retained in deposit at Sydney, by the
chaplain, or given in charge to the constables who conduct the
convicts on their first arrival in the colony, with orders to
deposit them in the hands of the chaplain of the district to
which the convicts are sent.</p>
<p>From the many temptations to which the government convicts in
Sydney are exposed, it cannot be expected that numerous instances
occur of their reformation. To those who either are married, or
are followed by their wives and children, and who possess the
means of supporting them by their labour on Saturdays, the
gradual acquirement of property, and the comforts attending it,
afford an inducement to good conduct, of very powerful operation;
and it is observed, therefore, that the convict mechanics who are
married, and are permitted to live out of barracks, are much less
engaged in criminal enterprises than the other descriptions of
convicts in Sydney. Their condition indeed cannot be considered
as one of hardship, except as it imposes the necessity of greater
labour and caution for the support of their families. Numerous
instances occur of that exertion being continued through the
night, and under the present system of exacting the whole of the
daily labour of the convicts for government, the necessity of
such exertion is increased; but although the lives of these men
are not openly criminal, there is one species of temptation to
which they are more exposed than any other description of
convicts, and to which their present multifarious employment
gives greater latitude. The stores and materials used in the
different buildings at Sydney, are kept in a magazine in the
lumber yard, and are distributed according to the written
requisitions of the different overseers that are made during the
day, and that are addressed to the store keeper in the lumber
yard. They are conveyed from thence to the buildings by the
convict mechanics, and no account of the expenditure or
employment of the stores is kept by the overseers, or rendered to
the storekeeper. It was only in the early cart of the year 1820,
that an account was opened by him of the different materials used
in each work or building, and in February 1821, this account was
considerably in arrear. The temptation, therefore, that is
afforded to the convict mechanics who work in the lumber yard, in
secreting tools, stores, and implements, and to those who work at
the different buildings is very great, and the loss to government
is considerable. The tools moreover have not latterly been
mustered as they used to be, once a month, except where one of
the convicts is removed from Sydney to another station. All these
circumstances, arising from a variety of operations that are
going on, and from the perpetual changes that take place in the
gangs of workmen, both increase the facilities of plunder, and
with the high price that building materials have generally borne
in the town of Sydney, present an irresistible temptation to the
convict mechanics to secrete and purloin them.</p>
<p>In answer to my inquiry respecting the number of convict
mechanics in the service of government, who in the opinion of the
chief engineer had conducted themselves well, he at first
declared that they were numerous, but upon further reflection,
his answer comprised only four individuals; and his list made out
at a subsequent period of persons who had been tried for bad
crimes, and whom he now considered to be reformed after having
been some time in the service of government, comprises 22 names.
These persons have either filled, or are now holding, the
situations of overseers and superintendents.</p>
<p>In support of the opinion that has thus been given of these
individuals by the chief engineer, as indeed of any other
estimate that may be formed of the character of the large body of
emancipated convicts in New South Wales, it is not to be
expected, that positive or even concurrent testimony can be
obtained; the greater part of those enumerated are employed in
confidential situations under government, and have not yet been
accused or proved to have betrayed them, by those who have had
opportunities of observing their conduct. These opportunities,
however, under the present system of government work at Sydney,
are not such as to enable the chief engineer to form a correct
judgment of the meritorious performance of their several duties,
much less to vouch for the uniformity of their moral conduct. On
the other hand, it must be observed, that the instances which
this list affords are surprisingly few, compared with the great
number of workmen and individuals that have been in the employ of
government, from the period of Major Druitt's appointment to that
in which this list was returned (a period of two years and three
months); and it is further confirmed by the opinion that he has
given of the inefficacy of the system of government work in
producing reform, as stated in his evidence.</p>
<p>The principles upon which the work for government is conducted
at Paramatta, are exactly the same as those that prevail at
Sydney, and have been assimilated since the construction of the
barrack at this station. It has been followed by a diminution of
the offences formerly committed by the government workmen, when
unprovided with lodging, and therefore tempted to cohabit with
the female convicts who were in the same situation as themselves;
but the superintendence of the works at Paramatta is less
vigorous and regular than at Sydney; the facilities to plunder
greater, from want of a fence to the lumber yard; and the effect
of the labour upon the convicts, to whom task work is not given,
is, as described by Mr. Rouse, the superintendent, to give them
habits of laziness.</p>
<p>The employment of convicts in the cultivation of land, had
been discontinued in New South Wales, since the breaking up of
the early establishments at Castle Hill and Toongabbee, until the
necessity of providing food and pasturage for the draught cattle,
employed in the public works at Sydney, seemed absolutely to
require such a means of supply. In the period of Captain Gill's
superintendence of Grose Farm, the means, as well as the system
of cultivation pursued there, did not even meet that object. It
has been the endeavour of Major Druitt to accomplish it; and in
doing so, to afford an opportunity of making those experiments in
agriculture, which the limited means of the settlers in New South
Wales would not generally admit. I found this system in operation
on my arrival, and my early and present conviction of its
importance, led me to recommend the expediency of continuing it
to Governor Macquarrie, who has always entertained doubts of the
success of any attempt to conduct convict agricultural
establishments upon any principle, or upon any system, by which
the profits of the labour should be made to balance its expenses.
Considerations partly arising from the object that dictated the
establishment of Grose Farm in the first instance, and partly
arising from the view that I have taken of convict labour,
considered both with reference to its profits and effects, led me
to make that recommendation; and although I cannot agree in the
sanguine and favourable report of this establishment that has
been made by Major Druitt, and think, that much of unnecessary,
and I may say, of wanton expense in it, might have been avoided;
yet I have every reason to believe, that the first impressions to
which this establishment gave rise, would have been, or are,
capable of being confirmed by a more judicious and economical
system of management. The convicts employed in it amount to 150,
and their lodging, confinement and employment, is intrusted to a
convict overseer, Ebenezer Knox.</p>
<p>It has been the peculiar good fortune of this establishment to
have received a large portion or Major Druitt's personal
attention. From partiality to agricultural pursuits, he has taken
a pleasure in its success, and scarcely a day passes in which a
considerable portion of it is not spent in directing or
superintending, the operations. Hence has arisen more activity in
labour, and more vigilance in the overseer. It has also been
accompanied by a detection of his malpractices, that is of no
small use in correcting the estimates that are formed of the
merits of convicts when placed in such situations. The individual
in question was selected for his knowledge in agricultural
pursuits; and in Major Druitt's evidence, he is praised for his
superior vigilance and system of control. The security indeed of
the convicts at Grose Farm, their confinement during the night,
and their obedience during the day, are all attributed to the
superior merits of this overseer. A few months had scarcely
elapsed after this just tribute was paid to him, when a discovery
was made of a fraud committed by him, in certifying a return of a
greater number of convicts than were actually employed, and in
receiving their rations. Upon occasional visits to the farm,
likewise, I observed him to be disabled from doing duty from
intoxication. In the early period of this man's superintendence,
the chief engineer found much to praise in him, both for
intelligence in the management of the farm, and in his vigilance
in controlling the convicts. In the space of five months, this
good opinion was changed, and the testimony he had given in his
favour was expunged from his evidence, at the chief engineer's
request. The management of the convicts, however, in this
establishment, has been more easy than in that of Sydney;
complaints against them for misconduct have been less numerous;
and several who have returned from the Coal River, whither they
had been sent for punishment, and from settlers who had returned
them to government as useless, have conducted themselves well,
and have been instructed in the agricultural labours of the
farm.</p>
<p>The labour of the road parties, and the shell gangs, exposes
the convicts to the evil effects of slight control and great
temptation. On Saturdays the road parties do not as the overseer
is necessarily absent in drawing the rations from the nearest
station; and some of the convicts pass the day in idleness,
others in washing their clothes, and in straying to the farms of
neighbouring settlers. The only means of controlling them during
the night, is afforded by mustering them at uncertain hours; hit
the effect of this regulation entirely depends upon the vigilance
of the overseers. The temptation to plunder afforded to the road
parties, by the passage of settlers in their carts going to and
from Sydney and Paramatta, many of whom are in a state of
intoxication, has led to the commission of highway robberies, to
robberies of orchards and poultry-yards, in the vicinity of the
several stations. With a view to obviate this evil, the chief
engineer has been directed by the governor to select the men of
best characters from the convict ships for the road parties; and
he has also been guided by their previous habits of life, and by
their bodily strength. The great advantages that are derived to
the colony from the effectual improvement and repair of the roads
communicating with the town of Sydney, counterbalanced in some
degree the evils to which this mode of employing the convicts
undoubtedly have given rise, and for which there is no remedy;
but while this advantage has been gained to the colony,
considerable loss has also been sustained by government, in the
quantities of slop clothing and bedding that the convicts in the
road parties were perpetually detected in selling to the lower
classes of settlers in exchange for spirits: sufficient care was
not taken, at the first distribution of the convicts at Sydney
for this service, to inform the overseer of these parties of the
quantities of slop clothing; and bedding that the convicts
brought with them, or to furnish them with a list; it was
therefore impossible, but from recollection, to contradict or to
satisfy the numerous complaints that were urged by all of them,
of the want of these necessary articles, or to distinguish
between the complaints that were real and those that were
pretended; neither was there sufficient care observed by the
overseers in mustering them from time to time, or in examining
into and reporting the causes of their deficiency; a regulation
by which the frequent offence of stealing from each other would
have been more easily detected and punished. Except when the road
parties are placed near the towns of Paramatta, Liverpool and
Windsor, they have no means of attending any religious duty the
punishment of offences committed by them is referred to the
cognizance of the magistrates at those towns, the overseer having
no power to inflict it without their order, and the time that
this reference necessarily occupies interferes with the discharge
of his local duties. The health of the road parties does not
appear to have been affected by the nature of the labour they
undergo, and in one instance only have I found that it was
affected by their habits of life: this occurrence is described by
Mr. West to have taken place amongst a party employed on the
western road, leading from Paramatta to Emu Ford, and to have
originated from the dampness of the situations in which the huts
were placed, on account of their contiguity to water, and the bad
construction of the rook at the commencement of the rainy season.
The disease, which was a species of typhus fever, affected a
great ninny men, and some of them died of it in the hospital at
Paramatta. On the removal of time party to more elevated and dry
situations, the progress of the disease was immediately
stopped.</p>
<p>The nature of time labour of the road parties hies been
already described. The selection of ninny well conducted and
robust men for this service has certainly deprived the settlers
of some very valuable labourers; but the late improvement of the
roads has afforded them an easy and speedy conveyance of their
produce to market, which they never enjoyed before, and which
they were not in a condition to have procured for themselves; and
they have been the means of instructing several convicts who had
been accustomed to the sea-service, or to employment on canals
and rivers, in the labour of clearing land of trees and roots,
and thereby rendering them useful to the settlers hereafter.</p>
<p>The agricultural establishment at Longbottom, possesses some
local advantages in time speedy and easy conveyance of its
produce to Sydney, but from its contiguity to time high road, it
affords great temptations to the convicts to escape at night; and
in the early part of the evenings to stroll along the road and
stop carts and passengers. Frequent instances of these acts of
plunder occurred in the latter end of the year 1820, and are
attributable in some degree to the want of vigilance and activity
in the superintendent, and partly to the difficulty that he
experienced in confining the convicts between the hour in which
their labour terminated; and the hour of confinement for the
night.</p>
<p>The nature of the work in which a party called the shell gang
is employed, is described in the evidence of William Hutchinson,
the principal superintendent. The men dig for time oyster shells
in the bed of the river when the tide is retiring; and as the
period of their work is limited, and they are tasked to finish a
certain quantity in the week, the labour is severe in itself, and
it is frequently performed when they are up to their waists in
water. This species of labour is generally reserved for the men
of the worst character; and an instance occurred in the latter
end of the year 1819, of the evil effects of giving task work,
when it is not accompanied by strict confinement and control. A
convict named Parsons, who had been tried in London for an
offence committed in time month of February 1819, was transported
in May following to New South Wales. He was by disposition
turbulent and refractory, and for some misconduct at the barrack
at Sydney, he was ordered to be placed ill time shell gang at
Iron Cove. He had been there only three weeks, when having
completed his weekly task on a Thursday, he escaped to Sydney,
when time other convicts were at work, and concerted with another
man of the same gang, a highway robbery, for which he was tried,
sentenced, and, executed in time month of December of the same
year.</p>
<p>The convicts at Emu Plains are employed in the clearing and
cultivation of the land, and are placed under the superintendence
of Mr. Richard Fitzgerald and John Greenhatch. The first of these
individuals acts as superintendent of the government works at
Windsor, and resides there, visiting Emu Plains not oftener than
twice a week.</p>
<p>This establishment differs from the others that have been
described in the nature of the controlling authority. Written
instructions from the governor have been furnished to the
superintendent, by which he is required to report to him alone,
respecting the progress of the works, and all occurrences at the
establishment; but permission to visit it is allowed to the
officers and magistrates of time colony. None of the convicts are
allowed to be assigned to settlers, except by time order of the
governor, as the establishment was intended by him to afford the
means of instruction in agriculture to the convicts whose
services were not required by time settler. Those who were sent
to Emu Plains were with very few exceptions unacquainted with
agricultural employment, and they generally consisted of the most
useless and least robust; but the experience of this
establishment has shown that in the simple operation of felling
timber, burning it, and clearing the land of roots, all
descriptions of convicts may be beneficially employed.</p>
<p>An application having been made to Governor Macquarrie in the
month of December 1820, by the inhabitants of the districts of
Cooke, Airds and Appin, for a temporary loan of several labourers
for the sake of securing their crops with expedition, 50 of the
convicts from Emu Plains were sent to their assistance.</p>
<p>As the harvest at the establishment at Emu Plains was then in
progress, the best labourers were retained for securing it, and
the benefits derived to the settlers from the labour of the
others were not so great as they otherwise would have been; but
the occurrence is mentioned to show the advantage that the
government as well as the colonists may occasionally derive from
the employment and instruction of the convicts in agricultural
pursuits.</p>
<p>The security and confinement of the convicts at this
establishment is in some degree promoted by the course of the
River Nepean, that separates the plains from the settled
districts on the opposite shore, while the contiguous and
constant residence of a magistrate, (Sir John Jamieson) upon his
estate at Regent Ville, opposite, admits an easy and earlier
reference to him for the punishment of offences not cognizable by
the superintendent.</p>
<p>The military guard at Emu Plains, consists of seven privates
of one of the veteran companies and a corporal. The only object
in retaining it at this station is, to afford protection to the
commisariat store, for the men are so enfeebled by age as to be
incapable of affording resistance even to an unarmed force. In
the month of December 1820, a party of 15 convicts left Emu
Plains, surprised the small detachment of the veteran company at
Spring Wood, the first station on the road to Bathurst, and
possessing themselves of their arms and ammunition, wandered in
the ravines of the Blue Mountains for the space of five days,
subsisting on the provisions they had brought with them; when
these were exhausted they again approached the road to Bathurst,
and having been observed by some of the stock-keepers in the
neighbourhood of Mount York and the valleys beyond it, they were
taken by a detachment of the 48th regiment that had been sent in
their pursuit. Their intention appears to have been to proceed to
the western coast of New Holland, where they believed they should
find a Dutch settlement, and by that means effect their escape to
India. By a reference to the return of punishments inflicted at
Emu Plains, from the 11th September 1819 to the 9th December
1820, it will appear that escapes from thence to the estates of
the settlers have not been frequent, although many complaints
were made by them of losses sustained in their gardens and
orchards.</p>
<p>The river Nepean is fordable during the summer in many places
below Emu Plains, and a ferryboat is kept on the eastern branch
of the Nepean for the conveyance of passengers and cattle across
the river, and to the road that leads to Bathurst. The
inconvenient direction of this road has already been noticed, and
the use of the ferry by passengers has facilitated the
intercourse of the convicts with the inhabitants; they have also
passed the Nepean at the falls below the ferry, and in returning
upon one occasion, after making this attempt, two of them were
drowned.</p>
<p>On alternate Sundays the convicts from Emu Plains have
attended divine service at Castlereagh, since the completion of a
school-house and chapel for that township.</p>
<p>The situation of Emu Plains is better calculated to meet the
objects for which it was formed than any other that presented
itself in the settled part of the colony, and the fertility and
depth of soil in that portion that is most contiguous to the
river Nepean, will ensure an abundant return from any species of
grain that may be consigned to it. The produce of the first crop
of wheat of 1820, was estimated at 30 bushels an acre, and of
maize at 80. Such quantities of timber as were fit for use, were
employed in constructing huts, farm buildings and fences, and
bricks and shingles were also made upon the spot. All those
buildings that were immediately necessary for assisting
cultivation had been erected, and it was in contemplation to
build a lodge for the temporary accommodation of the governor on
his visits to the plains.</p>
<p>Mr. Richard Fitzgerald, who superintends this establishment,
was formerly employed in the same capacity at those of Castle
Hill and Toongabbee in the years 1792 and 1793; the further
progress of this individual, who was formerly a convict, is
detailed in his evidence. It is sufficient at present to remark,
that it was highly creditable to his industry and to his
integrity, and that he has, since the arrival of Governor
Macquarrie, not only enjoyed his confidence and friendship, but
has held the situation of storekeeper, and clerk in charge, in
the commissariat department at Windsor. His former acquaintance
with the nature and details of convict labour, and the high
opinion entertained of him by Governor Macquarrie no doubt were
reasons for his appointment to the superintendence of the
establishment at Emu Plains. It is, however, to be observed as
well as to be regretted, that at the period of this appointment
Mr. Fitzgerald was pursuing several other occupations that
positively and indirectly interfered with its duties, and that
necessarily affected the relation of superintendent, in which
alone he ought to have stood, towards the convicts. In the month
of September 1819, Mr. Fitzgerald acted as storekeeper at
Windsor, and equally controlled the issue of provisions at Emu
Plains; he was likewise superintendent of government works at
Windsor, and for which he received a salary of 50<i>l</i>. per
annum: he is a proprietor of land and stock in the neighbourhood,
and keeps an inn and spirit shop in the town of Windsor, called
the Macquarrie Arms, the management of which, although ostensibly
in the hands of an emancipated Jew, is controlled by Mr.
Fitzgerald and his wife, who occupy a house adjoining, and who
are in the habit of giving orders upon the Jew for the delivery
of goods and spirits in payment of services performed by the
convicts at the establishment at Emu Plains, as well as at the
government works at Windsor. These two places are 15 miles
distant from each other, and with the demands upon his time and
attention that the occupations and superintendence created at
Windsor, it was not to be expected that much of either should be
devoted to Emu Plains. It appears, indeed, that he has never
visited that establishment more than twice a week, and that the
duties of superintending it have devolved upon his deputy, J.
Greenhatch, who professed to me an anxious desire to betake
himself to some more profitable employment. The conduct of Mr.
Fitzgerald in this and other situations will be more particularly
noticed hereafter, as it became the subject of accusation and
judicial investigation during my residence at Paramatta; at
present it is observed upon in its effects upon the establishment
which he was appointed to superintend, and for which he received
a comparatively larger salary than any other officer in the
service of the colony.</p>
<p>In the agricultural management of the farm at Emu Plains there
was nothing remarkable in point of arrangement, and certainly
nothing that denoted activity.</p>
<p>In the month of December 1820, more than a year after the
establishment had commenced, a garden for the use of the convicts
had been made, on ground that was formerly a stock-yard. A few
plants of tobacco had been set, and an ineffectual attempt had
been made to grind in a hand-mill the wheat and maize consumed at
Emu Plains: this labour, although useful as a punishment, was
found to be too severe for ordinary employment. It is to be
observed, that the convicts at Emu Plains were not selected for
their skill, as many of those at Grose Farm and Longbottom are,
by the chief engineer; nor has Mr. Fitzgerald that unlimited
command of means, cattle and implements, that are possessed at
Sydney.</p>
<p>The establishments that have been mentioned comprise the
ordinary means of affording labour to the convicts in the
employment of government in New South Wales.</p>
<p>There are also convicts that are described in the returns as
stationary servants, whose employment it is necessary to notice:
such are the convicts employed as clerks to the magistrates;
those employed in keeping accounts, and assisting the
superintendents and overseers in making out returns; and those at
the different barracks, employed in performing the domestic
duties of cooks, bakers and washers. The commissariat department
at each station likewise employs a considerable number of
convicts, both as clerks and labourers, and the attendance on the
sick in the hospitals; and the dispensing of medicine is also
performed by them. To the clerks in the higher situations, the
services of a government convict are assigned by way of
remuneration; and in the selection of this last description of
men, consideration is had to their former situations in life and
their acquirements; as the immediate consignment of them on
arrival in New South Vales to manual labour, in the dress worn by
the convicts, is found to inflict upon them a greater degree of
mental and bodily suffering, than upon those of the lower and
labouring classes, and the manual labour that they are capable of
performing is inconsiderable.</p>
<p>It is found, on the other hand, that the clerical employment
afforded in the higher offices, and in the courts, gives them an
air of authority and presumption most unsuited to their
condition: the profits of the employment of their leisure hours,
and of their occasional assistance to the shopkeepers and
merchants, or to the lower orders of settlers, and convicts (in
drawing petitions and memorials for them), are most frequently
consumed in dissipation and extravagance, and they affect
superiority in dress and appearance, which excites a feeling of
envy in the class to which they belong, and of indignation and
contempt in that of free persons, to whom they aspire. It may be
safely affirmed, that there is no class of convicts to whom the
punishment of transportation becomes, under these circumstances,
so light; and none in whom reformation is less to be
expected.</p>
<p>The labourers in the commissariat department are employed in
receiving and depositing grain and meat in the stores, and
turning it over and cleaning it. The difficulties that have been
from time to time experienced by the settlers in obtaining
admission for their grain, and the advantages they derive from
bribing these men to procure an early turn amidst the numerous
competitors for that benefit on one and the same day, have led to
their repeated dismissal and punishments for intoxication.
Another source of corruption arises from the attempts of the
settlers to conceal the bad quality or dirty condition of their
grain, by procuring, through the assistance of these labourers,
an admixture of it with grain of good quality on the same floor.
The utmost vigilance of the officers in the commissariat
department is necessary to detect these practices, and it is at
the Sydney station they are most frequently and successfully
attempted.</p>
<p>The complaints of theft and neglect of duty against the
convicts employed in the hospitals are very frequent; and as no
attempt is made to select convicts for these situations, who,
from previous good conduct, might be supposed to withstand
temptation better than the rest, the loss to government in
clothing and bedding is considerable, and the medical treatment
of the hospital patients is exposed to serious obstruction.</p>
<p>The government work performed at Hobart Town, in Van Dieman's
Land, is directed by Major Bell, an officer of the 48th regiment,
the acting engineer at that station, who receives his orders from
the lieutenant-governor. No works, however, are undertaken
without reference to the governor in chief, and the plans of the
buildings receive his sanction before they are finally
adopted.</p>
<p>The acting engineer at Hobart Town has an assistant, who came
free to the island, and who resides at a house near the lumber
yard in Hobart Town, where the principal works are carried on.
The system of superintendence is precisely similar to that which
prevails at Sydney; but its efficiency in enforcing regular
attendance is increased by the presence of the acting engineer at
the morning musters, and by the greater contraction of the works
that he has to direct. The hours of convict labour are from six
till nine, and from ten till three in summer; and from eight till
one o'clock without intermission in winter. On Saturdays the
convicts leave their work at ten in summer and eleven in winter,
to enable them to attend at the store to draw their rations, and
on Wednesdays one hour is allowed them for the same purpose.</p>
<p>From one o'clock, therefore, in winter, and from three o'clock
in summer, the convicts at Hobart Town have the remainder of
every working day in the week to themselves. The reason of this
dispensation from work, is to enable them, by their own labour,
to provide lodging and washing for themselves. The demand for all
kinds of mechanical labour at Hobart Town would at all times
enable mechanics to many for both; but it appears that the wages
of brickmakers, whose labour is much in demand, have experienced
a considerable reduction between the year 1818 and the beginning
of 1820, arising from the number of convicts that devoted
themselves to an occupation that was found to be profitable, and
from the accession of others, during that period, who were
capable of pursuing it. The prices of a weekly lodging in Hobart
Town to a convict was estimated, in March 1820, at five
shillings, and for this sum he is admitted to live and sleep in
the house; but there are many who take up their abode in the back
part of it, called the skilling, for which the labour of
providing wood and water is taken as a payment. As soon as they
are assigned to the working gangs after debarkation from the
ships, they are allowed to look for lodgings where they please,
and if they are not able to find them, the chief constable is
directed to billet them for a short period on the houses of other
prisoners, or they are lodged in a room in the gaol, or in the
lock-up house. The want of any better mode of distribution and
accommodation has certainly increased the quantity and frequency
of crime in Hobart Town. To the industrious part of the convicts,
the uncontrolled use of a great portion of the day affords an
early inducement to acquire and possess property of their own,
and to conduct themselves well; but to those who have lived in
towns, and have been familiar with their vices, it affords an
irresistible temptation to idleness during the day, and to acts
of plunder and to house-breaking during the night. A partial
correction of these evils has been attained, by fitting up two
rooms in a brick building that was formerly a gaol, in which
about 50 convicts can sleep on guard beds. Constables for the
special control of this building, and those comprising the
nightly watch, occupy a room at the end of it, and even by means
of this limited establishment, it appears that some security from
nocturnal depredations has been accomplished. All the convicts
who lodge in the town are required to be in their quarters at
eight o'clock, the hour at which the bell rings, and those that
are found in the streets after that hour are apprehended. The
constables likewise have the power of entering public houses
after this hour, and all houses where the government convicts
lodge at night, on suspicion of their misconduct or concealment,
and of conveying them to the house of confinement.</p>
<p>As many of the mechanics, and indeed of the labourers, in the
employ of government, are able to perform their task before the
expiration of the hours of labour, much expedition is used in
accomplishing it, and the evil consequences of the system of task
work that were noticed in describing its operation at Sydney, are
found equally to exist at Hobart Town. They were particularly
observable in the article of bricks made in the government time,
which I found to be very inferior in quality to those made by the
same brickmakers on their own account or in their own time,
although composed nearly of the same materials, and burnt in
kilns immediately adjoining to those of government. The
brickwork, likewise, of time church lately erected at Hobart
Town, as well as of the hospital and government house, are very
defective. One cause of the defect was found to arise from an
inequality in the sizes of the moulds of the bricks, and from a
practice that has prevailed at Hobart Town, of allowing the
overseers to work themselves, instead of superintending and
instructing the other workmen. The want of architectural
knowledge in designing and conducting the buildings is the
principal cause of these defects, and has been quite as
conspicuous at Hobart Town as it was at Sydney previous to the
arrival of Mr. Greenway. It is also unfortunate that at this
settlement, where there is abundance of stone to be procured, so
few stonemasons should have been sent from Sydney, and that
bricks should have been so much used in the construction of the
public buildings, as well as in those of individuals. From the
bad quality of those generally made at Hobart Town, it is found
necessary to secure them from the effect of sea air and moisture
by plaster; and it has been universally found that stone
buildings afford a greater security against house-breakers than
those built of brick.</p>
<p>It has been usual for government to pay, for the extra labour
of their own mechanics when any expedition or neatness of
execution was required, and a return was made to me of the sums
thus expended from the month of June 1818 to the month of March
1820, amounting to 620<i>l</i>. 16<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. The
payment of this extra labour is calculated according to time, and
not to the quantity of work that the men perform, so that time
superintendence of an overseer is equally requisite, as in time
ordinary government time, to ensure the execution of a sufficient
quantity. Three shillings are given for the daily extra labour of
a mechanic, and two for that of a labourer. It appears, however,
that the mechanics employed at Hobart Town have been few, and
generally unskilful. In the month of February 1820, the total
number of convicts employed there amounted to 533; and out of 19
blacksmiths, five only were good workmen; out of 30 carpenters,
only seven; and out of 13 bricklayers, only three were good
workmen.</p>
<p>From the returns furnished by the secretary to the
lieutenant-governor, it appears that from the year 1810 to time
8th April 1817, 521 convicts arrived in both settlements of Van
Dieman's Land, and of these 199 were from England direct, and the
remaining 322 were from Sydney; and as no account was kept of
time distribution of the convicts at Hobart Town previous to the
arrival of Lieutenant-governor Sorrell, in the month of April
1817, nor any register or document found there, or handed over to
him by his predecessor Lieutenant-colonel Davey, the proportion
that the mechanics bore to the whole number of convicts that
arrived from 1810 to that period cannot be determined.</p>
<p>A return was made to me by the principal superintendent
Crowder, of the artificers employed in the public works at Hobart
Town, from the month of August 1813 to the month of July 1817;
but he was not able, either from recollection or from documents,
to ascertain the causes of their annual increase or decrease; and
the amount of his return of mechanics employed in the month of
April 1817, differs very materially from a similar return made
from the office of the lieutenant-governor's secretary. Out of
1,844 convicts that arrived at Hobart Town from the month of
April 1817 to the month of December 1819, 746 (of whom 111 were
mechanics) have been retained in the government service, 41 have
been assigned as government men to officers, superintendents and
overseers, 523 have been sent to Port Dalrymple, and 534 have
been assigned to settlers.</p>
<p>The same operations, for supplying timber and lime to the
works at Hobart Town, are pursued there as at Sydney. The timber
was procured in the years 1817 and 1818, from the banks of the
rivulet that flows from the Table Mountain through Hobart
Town.</p>
<p>The access to this supply was never easy; and as it lately
began to fail, recourse was had to North West Bay in
D'Entrecasteaux's Straits, situated on the western side of the
entrance of the river Derwent, and distant about 20 miles from
Hobart Town. Seven men and an overseer are stationed at this
place, and are employed in cutting and sawing timber, which is
conveyed in boats or a government vessel to Hobart Town.</p>
<p>The supply of timber at this place is abundant, and consists
chiefly of those species of the eucalyptus that have received the
names of iron bark and stringy bark; a small quantity of wood
that is called cedar (a species of coarse mahogany) has been
received from Sydney, for the fittings of the church at Hobart
Town; and the huon pine, a wood peculiar to Van Dieman's Land,
has been also purchased from an individual at that place, to whom
a monopoly of the supply was granted for two years by Governor
Macquarrie, in consideration of his having fitted out a vessel
for the discovery of harbours on the western coast of the island.
It was not intended that the government should be bound by the
monopoly, but the vessel (called the Prince Leopold) that was
purchased at Sydney on account of government, and destined for
this particular service, was found to be of too large a draught,
and incapable of entering Macquarrie harbour, in which port alone
the huon pine is at present found to be accessible or
abundant.</p>
<p>On account of the distance of North West Bay from any
settlement, and from Hobart Town, the conduct of the men employed
in this service has not been complained of; and they are
permitted to send to Hobart Town, for sale on their own account,
such quantities of wood as they are able to cut in their own
time.</p>
<p>Lime is procured from a place called Double Bay, on the
eastern shore of the river Derwent, from shells dug up and burnt
upon the spot. Seven men are employed there, and work their own
boat in bringing their lime to Hobart Town. Stone lime has been
found in a quarry immediately above Hobart Town: it is of greater
strength than the shell lime; but as it is taken at present from
strata that lie near the surface, it is mixed with a considerable
quantity of earthy matter, and it is not applicable to finer
uses. On emergencies, the stone lime is purchased from the men of
the lime burners gang, as part of their extra labour, at
6<i>d</i>. and the shell lime at 9<i>d</i>. per bushel.</p>
<p>The returns furnished by the acting engineer at Hobart Town
exhibit the various descriptions of mechanics, as well as the
occupations of those described as labourers, amounting to 214,
and many of which nearly correspond with the occupations of the
class called stationary servants at Sydney.</p>
<p>Agricultural labour on government account had not been tried
at Hobart Town further than by an inclosure of a tract of hilly
land contiguous to it, comprising near 3,000 acres, and of
various qualities, (but in which the inferior predominate), that
is occupied by the draught cattle and horses in the use of
government, and the cows allowed for the use of the
lieutenant-governor, the acting engineer, and the officer in the
commissariat department.</p>
<p>This tract is called the government domain, and is bounded on
the east side by the river Derwent; and the separation of it by a
fence from the open land, on the north and west side, was
absolutely necessary for securing pasturage, which in the
immediate neighbourhood of Hobart Town is procured, at all times,
with difficulty, the land being uncultivated, and consisting of a
sterile clay, and large masses of sandstone. In winter, the
cattle are fed upon straw and bran.</p>
<p>One road party only had been employed under the direction of
the acting engineer, in the neighbourhood of Hobart Town, in
repairing and improving the road that leads from thence to
Austen's Ferry, a distance of twelve miles, and which forms the
principal communication with the interior of the island, and with
Port Dalrymple. It was in contemplation to form another on a line
of unformed road that leads from Kangaroo Point, on the eastern
shore of the Derwent, and immediately opposite Hobart Town,
communicating with the fertile district of Pittwater; to improve
the ascent of a very steep hill on the road to Port Dalrymple, as
well as in the line of communication between Elizabeth Town and
Macquarrie Plains. With these exceptions, and that of two gangs
of convicts employed in forming and levelling the streets at
Hobart Town, the labour of the convicts at that station has been
entirely devoted to the construction of buildings for government,
or to the construction of louses or small tenements in the town,
during their own time. For the reasons already assigned, the
labour of the convicts for government is imperfectly and
carelessly performed, and there is generally much less of
activity and of coercion than at Sydney. The acting engineer
never ventures to inflict any greater punishment upon the
government convicts by his own authority, than that of
confinement to extra of work; and as he in all other cases
strictly abstains from any cognizance of their offences, except
when sitting with the other magistrates, much of his own time and
that of his assistant is consumed in the examination and trial of
the charges that he finds it his duty to prefer against them, and
much of the benefit of summary punishment is lost.</p>
<p>To counterbalance these disadvantages much more attention is
given to the preservation of the tools and utensils than at
Sydney, and a large portion of the time of the assistant
superintendent is devoted to the issue of them, and to noting
deficiencies.</p>
<p>The supply of stores and implements at this station from
Sydney, with the exception of two articles only, has latterly
been inconsiderable; and the most useful and requisite tools have
been purchased from time to time by the acting engineer, for
either from the stores of the merchants in Hobart Town, from the
casual investments of captains of merchant ships, or have been
made in the lumber-yard by the convicts. From the want of the
usual government mark, and the difficulty of impressing it upon
every description of the purchased tools, some loss has been
occasioned; and it appears, that at this station, as well as at
Sydney, the offence of stealing, and of using the government
tools without leave, is very frequent.</p>
<p>The effect of government labour, as it is now conducted at
Hobart Town, both upon the minds of the convicts, and in raising
the price of labour to individuals, is strongly described in the
evidence of Mr. Gatehouse, to whom a newly arrived mason was
assigned, for the purpose of forwarding the construction of a
brewery at a very eligible situation only two miles distant from
Hobart Town.</p>
<p>The high daily wages (amounting to 7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. or
10<i>s</i>.) that the convict could have obtained by working for
individuals there during his own time, and after his work for
government was finished, operated as such a temptation to him to
quit the compulsory work to which he was assigned in the country,
and which his master Mr. Gatehouse had a right to enforce during
the whole of the day, that after a short time, and having learnt
the difficulties in which Mr. Gatehouse would be placed, and that
he would have suffered by complaining, to a magistrate, he took
advantage of them, and insisted upon an agreement for an amount
of wages to which he had no right. His master refused to comply
with this demand, and the man then absconded. He was apprehended,
but not punished at the request of his master, upon his promise
to pay him the full value of his work, deducting only his
subsistence.</p>
<p>The convicts at George Town have been employed in the
construction of buildings for government and houses for
themselves, ever since the 11th December 1815, Governor
Macquarrie having resolved at that time to put into execution the
measure that had previously been sanctioned by your Lordship, on
his representation, for removing the government establishments
from Launceston to George Town, several convict mechanics were
dispatched thither and placed under the directions of Mr. W. E.
Leith, a free person, who had been selected and appointed to this
service by Governor Macquarrie, with a salary of 75<i>l</i>. per
annum.</p>
<p>The residence of Major Stuart, the military commandant,
continued to be fixed at Launceston, a distance of 40 miles by
water, and 36 by land, from George Town.</p>
<p>The want of co-operation between Major Stuart and Mr. Leith,
and the positive opposition of the former to the orders of
Governor Macquarrie, for some time retarded the advancement of
the buildings at George Town, and these circumstances, combined
with the delay occasioned by the frequent absence of the
superintendent Leith, at Launceston in prosecution and punishment
of the convicts employed under him, convinced Governor Macquarrie
of the necessity of removing the residence of the commandant from
Launceston to George Town, as soon as ever proper accommodation
was made for him. This removal took place in the month of May
1819, and since that period, and the addition of some mechanics,
and an overseer of carpenters from Sydney, the works have
proceeded with greater rapidity.</p>
<p>In consequence of the removal of Mr. Leith for acts of gross
immorality, the superintendence of the works has been placed in
the hands of Lieutenant Vandermeulen, of the 48th regiment, and
subsequently under that of Lieutenant Kenworthy. The supply of
timber at this station is attended with more difficulty than at
any of the others, on account of the distance at which it is
procured, and the peculiar hardness of the grain. Limestone is
found in quarries on the banks of the Tamer, and bricks are made
in the immediate neighbourhood of George Town; but from want of
tenacity in the soil they are very unsound.</p>
<p>The number of convicts at George Town, in the month of April
1820, amounted to 204, and of these 103 were mechanics. The
labourers consist of the worst description of convicts, men who
have been sent from Sydney to Hobart Town for crime and
misconduct, and from thence to George Town for the same
causes.</p>
<p>The nature of the labour at this station is not in any degree
more severe than at the others; but as it is at some distance
from any settlement, the access to spirits is not so frequent,
and the means of purchasing them for labour not so readily
obtained.</p>
<p>The salutary effects of this privation, however, have been
considerably lessened by a practice that prevailed till very
lately, of paying for all extra labour performed by the convict
mechanics, and the weekly stipends of the clerks, overseers and
constables, principally in spirits and sugar. From the 1st May
1819 to the 31st March 1820, the sum of 80<i>l</i>. 5<i>s</i>.
was paid for extra labour at George Town, in rum at 30<i>s</i>.
per gallon, and sugar at 1<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per lb.</p>
<p>The causes that led to this practice will be noticed
hereafter, but its effects upon the free and convict population
both at George Town and Launceston were very distinctly
marked.</p>
<p>To afford the convicts an opportunity of building huts and
houses, their labour for government ceased at three o'clock every
day.</p>
<p>This indulgence, at first, was very grossly abused by the
convicts, who wantonly set fire to the houses they had erected.
Latterly, they had been billetted neon the houses of others, who
were assisted in building them, building condition of receiving a
certain number; but either from the anxiety expressed by the
commandant to hasten the execution of the buildings in progress,
or from the indolence of a large portion of the convicts, their
habitations have been little attended to, and are very badly
constructed. In the month of April 1820, there were 14 wooden
houses, and 43 skillings at George Town, and they were occupied
by 241 male convicts and 24 females. The use of the government
teams, for the conveyance of timber, has been allowed to many
whose conduct seemed to entitle them to such an assistance; but
it was found that a benefit that was intended only for
themselves, was often clandestinely communicated to others; and
the government draught cattle were overpowered, and the carts
injured by excessive weights and careless driving.</p>
<p>The only means that the convict mechanics at George Town have
of profiting by their hours of leisure, consist in working for
the few people who are compelled to live there, and are
constructing houses, or in making furniture which they send up to
Launceston for sale. But the prices of all commodities that are
retailed there are so high, that their profit upon their extra
labour is inconsiderable. The female convicts who cohabit with
the government convicts at George Town are chiefly employed in
this traffic and it is said to have afforded opportunities for
the concealment of stolen property that finds its way over from
Hobart Town to Launceston.</p>
<p>At the early periods of this establishment, and when there
were few convicts in the settlements near Launceston, small
parties of government convicts were sent from George Town to
assist the settlers in the harvest; but this mode of employing
them has ceased for the present, and those whose services are not
useful in the buildings are employed in what is called the camp
gang, in clearing stumps of trees, and preparing the ground for
building. The whole of them are, however, obliged to devote a
small portion of each day to the labour of grinding their ration
of wheat, which, from the badness of the machinery of the mill,
and the number of persons demanding amen to it, produces dispute,
delay and confusion.</p>
<p>The obvious necessity of providing some means of grinding
wheat for so large and increasing an establishment, at last
induced the commandant to purchase the machinery of a windmill
that had been commenced at Launceston; but on account of the
imperfect construction of this mill, and the determination of the
officer of the commissariat department, not to issue grain to the
miller until the mill was delivered over to his department, it
had not been of much service; and the grain consumed at George
Town was ground at a hand-mill, which, when worked by four men,
would only grind four bushels in an hour, and two steel mills for
the use of the gaol and hospital.</p>
<p>Attempts to escape from George Town have not been so numerous
as might have been expected, considering the opportunities and
temptations arising from the passage of vends through Bass's
Straits, or the number of islands that are the resort of parties
employed in the seal fishery.</p>
<p>One attempt, of a very deliberate nature, was made in the year
1818; a large launch was found to have been built by a party of
convicts, who from time to time had watched opportunities of
crossing the river Tamer, and had pursued their occupation in a
bay situated on the shore of Bass's Straits, and only four miles
distant from George Town. They were detected and surprised by a
party of the 48th regiment, and the launch was brought to York
Cove.</p>
<p>The government boats, which are more numerous at this station
than there is any present occasion for, are well secured at
night; and a military guard is placed on board of those that are
employed in supplying lime, and conveying commissariat stores to
and from Launceston. The service of the boat crews is frequently
severe, and when they arrive at Launceston, after a long and
fatiguing row of nine hours or more, they have no lodging for the
night, and are obliged to remain under cover of their sails on
the wet and marshy shore of the river Tamer.</p>
<p>Crimes of theft and gambling are more frequent at this station
than at the others, and these vices are encouraged by the state
of prostitution in which the women who are sent to George Town
live with the male convicts.</p>
<p>The punishments that are inflicted are precisely of the same
kind as those used at Hobart Town, and are equally
inefficient.</p>
<p>Since the arrival of the commandant at George Town, divine
service has been performed on Sundays, in the centre of the town,
by time inspector of the works: the distance and uncertainty of
the navigation of the river Tamer, from Launceston, not having
admitted the performance of that duty at both places on time same
day, by the Rev. Mr. Youl, whose residence was at Launceston, and
would remain so until the house that was preparing for him at
George Town should be completed.</p>
<p>Such are the several kinds of labour performed by time
convicts retained in the service of government in New South Wales
and Van Dieman's Land, and as they have grown altogether out of
the presumed wants of the local governments, little consideration
has been afforded by them to the effects that they have produced,
either in the shape of punishment or of reform.</p>
<p>The distribution of the convicts in the first instance, the
resumption of their services at subsequent periods, the extension
of them beyond the terms assigned to others, have contributed to
create an universal impression upon the minds of the convicts,
that skilfulness in work, rather than immoral conduct, was the
cause of their first enthralment, and the measure of its
continuance. This feeling produces discouragement, carelessness,
and not unfrequently malicious and wanton destruction of the
property of government.</p>
<p>The local temptations to plunder that assail the convict
employed in the towns, and the habits of luxurious indulgence
that he acquires during his period of compulsory service, tend to
fix his residence there when he is emancipated; and while the
price of mechanical labour is thus enhanced to the settlers in
the country, the habits of the mechanic himself become permanently
depraved and licentious.</p>
<p>It has been seen by the information already afforded, that the
system of government labour pursued at Sydney, Paramatta and
Windsor, presents only a choice of evils; that the only stimulus
to active labour amongst the convict mechanics is created by
their hope of temporary and luxurious indulgence, that it is
neither subject to regulation, nor capable of it and that where
it is created by means of task work, there is more of loss
incurred by the careless manner of the performance, than of
advantage gained by its accelerated rate. This system, likewise,
considered as a part of punishment, is equally defective; it
proceeds upon the principle of making skill and sudden exertion,
rather than uniform and tried good conduct, the steps to
temporary reward. By this means the skilful and immoral man is
indulged and rewarded, and the inexpert and well-conducted man is
made uneasy and discontented. On the other hand, it is observed,
that where all stimulus to labour is withdrawn, coercion becomes
necessary; but it is that species of coercion that is incapable,
from want of character or extent, of being exactly applied; and
failing in these essential points, coercive labour, although
operating as a punishment, becomes an instrument and a pretext
for vexation and oppression.</p>
<p>It has been remarked by the principal superintendent, and
indeed it is otherwise apparent, that the accumulation in the
town of Sydney, of so many convicts employed by government, is
the cause of the many crimes that are committed in it; and this
opinion is confirmed by the observations of all the magistrates
to whom I applied for information.</p>
<p>It is the concurrent opinion of these individuals, as well as
the superintendent, that there is a much greater desire in the
convicts to associate together in towns, than to live separate
and retired in the country.</p>
<p>The perpetual presence of every species of temptation to vice,
and the opportunities that are afforded there of gratifying such
propensities, by the plunder of the property of government, or
that of individuals, operate powerfully upon the minds as well as
the conduct of the convicts on their first arrival; and it is
stated by the superintendent that no less a period than two years
is requisite to make them sensible even of control. In the course
of that period, and subsequently to it, their dispositions to
theft are but feebly checked by the police of Sydney, or by their
confinement in the barracks there and at Paramatta, or by the
punishment of flogging and the gaol gang. The numbers, indeed,
that have arrived within the last three years, have multiplied
the difficulties of control, while the establishments have not
kept pace with them, either in point of efficacy or in
extent.</p>
<p>From the want of a proper account of the crimes and offences
committed by the convicts in government employ, further than that
which may be collected from the general returns in the office of
the magistrates of police at Sydney and Paramatta, and which
afford no description of the particular condition of the
convicts, it is impossible to state with precision the effect
that the employment of the convicts in the town may reasonably be
supposed to produce upon the three classes into which they are
divided. Upon this point there is great difference of opinion
expressed by the chief engineer, Major Druitt, and the principal
superintendent, Hutchinson; the former asserting that the
convicts transported for life are more irreclaimable than those
transported for shorter terms; while the latter maintains, that
those transported for fourteen years, and for life, generally
conduct themselves well, but that those transported for seven
years begin to be refractory and disobedient as their period of
servitude draws to a conclusion.</p>
<p>The return of crimes and offences committed in the settlements
of Van Dieman's Land, do not specify whether the convicts that
were punished were in the employ of government or of the
settlers, although those made by the magistrate of police at
Hobart Town, distinguish the several periods for which they were
transported; and as there existed no other record or registry of
offences, the positive effect of the employment of the convicts
of each class at these stations, in the service of government,
cannot be determined by a reference either to the numbers or to
the nature of the offences that have been committed there. The
magistrate of police at Hobart Town was of opinion that the
system pursued there, admitting, as it does, a separation of the
convicts from each other, in houses either built or hired by
themselves; contributed more to their moral improvement than
confining them all, indiscriminately, in one barrack; and that
the apprehension of being removed, in cases of misconduct, from
the enjoyment and occupation of the small buildings that they are
allowed to construct and acquire in the town, afforded a great
degree of security for their good conduct. It is admitted,
however, by this officer, to whose opinion upon this subject
considerable weight is to be attached, that a place of
confinement during the night, or during hours in which no labour
is going on, is also necessary for the control of those convicts
that are known to be disorderly, or who are unwilling to provide
a lodging for themselves. It is also a matter of still further
importance to provide for the lodging of convicts of all classes
in the employ of government on their immediate arrival in the
colony. Their first resort is naturally made to their relations,
or to their former associates in crime; and in either case the
chances of misconduct are increased, by an early initiation into
the vices of the towns, and the effect of restraint is thus lost
at the moment when it ought to be most sensibly felt. At Hobart
Town, as well as at Sydney, the evil consequences of admitting
there a larger number of convicts than were able to provide
themselves with lodgings by their labour, began to be felt in the
year 1820, and much anxiety was expressed by Lieutenant-governor
Sorrell, to commence the construction of a barrack that might be
adequate to receive the numbers that were expected to arrive, and
that might not be taken by the settlers. This work was at last
undertaken in December 1820, and had only awaited the sanction of
Governor Macquarrie; a sanction that I should have felt myself
called upon to have urged immediately on my return from Van
Dieman's Land, if, from the manifold evils that I perceived to
arise from the accumulation of convicts in towns, I had not felt
reluctance to advise the adoption of any measure that necessarily
would be followed by that accumulation, though it provided a
partial and insufficient remedy.</p>
<p>The encouragement to acquire property in houses and tenements,
that is afforded by the residence of convicts in the towns, and
the stimulus to industry that it excites, is also accompanied by
an encouragement to steal the materials, where they cannot be
otherwise acquired; and that many of the convicts, who have built
houses in Hobart Town, as well as at Sydney and Paramatta, have
been aided by these means, no doubt is entertained.</p>
<p>The property and stores of government are perpetually resorted
to for these purposes, and in proportion to the increase of the
government works, the means of vigilant inspection have
diminished, and opportunities of plunder have multiplied. Unless,
therefore, the convict can prove that he is able to procure by
his labour or by the fruits of it, the means of erecting his own
dwelling, the liberty that is granted of building it, and
acquiring a property in the materials, is productive of a greater
evil than his casual occupation of the tenement of another.</p>
<p>At none of the settlements, except Newcastle, or at least in
none of the towns, has it been practicable to prevent; the sale
of spirituous liquors to the convicts, whenever they can afford
the means of purchasing them; and it is admitted by Mr.
Wentworth, the police magistrate at Sydney, who has had
considerable experience on this subject, that the desire of
obtaining spirituous liquors is the principal incentive to crime
amongst the convicts, and that the greatest and only chance of
their improvement is to be found in the absolute privation, of
diem. The difficulty of making any effectual regulation, by which
the sale of spirits to a convict should become penal, is greatly
increased by the want of an uniform dress or mark, by which that
class of the population should be distinguished; and this
difficulty would be increased when the regulation came to be
applied to that class of the convicts who most generally
possessed the means of purchasing spirits, and whose use of them
was the least capable of being restrained. This class is composed
of the mechanics and tradesmen, who are allowed to live in the
towns, and who are on no occasion required to appear in their
convict dresses, except on their arrival. The dress therefore of
these men, being that of ordinary persons, is no indication of
their condition; and their resort to public houses could only be
detected by the superintendent of convicts and the overseers.</p>
<p>From the disposition that had previously been evinced by
Governor Macquarrie to increase, rather than diminish, the number
of houses licensed for the sale of spirits in Sydney and the
other towns, it did not appear to me, that he had viewed in the
same light that I did, the great evil of placing strong
temptation in the way of men whose previous habits, and whose
present occupations and local employments, were calculated to
render them easy victims of the dissipation that these houses
afforded. I contented myself, therefore, at the early period of
my residence in New South Wales, with recommending that one
public house which, from being immediately opposite the gate of
the lumber yard at Sydney, afforded the greatest temptation to
the convicts, and a few others, that had been more notorious than
the rest for promoting riot and debauchery, should be suppressed.
It will be seen hereafter by what means this recommendation was
carried into effect.</p>
<p>The impressions that my early though short residence in the
town of Sydney had afforded me of the bad effects of employing so
many convicts in the works conducted on account of government in
the towns, and which had received considerable confirmation from
what I had observed at Hobart Town, made me very anxious to see
some limitation given to the numerous operations that were going
forward at Sydney, and to the continued successive appropriation
of the numerous mechanics that were arriving at the end of the
year 1819 and the commencement of 1820. As it appeared to me that
the evils of this system, both as they regarded the convicts, and
the expense that they occasioned to the crown, could only be
palliated or justified by some strong necessity for the buildings
upon which they were employed; and having observed that three had
been commenced previous to my arrival, which in their scale and
character could not be vindicated by that principle, while some
others that the same necessity very obviously required, were not
even in contemplation; I suggested to Governor Macquarrie the
expediency of stopping all work then in progress, that was merely
of an ornamental nature, and of postponing its execution till
other more important building's were finished: first taking care
to secure from damage the work that had been already done, or to
advance it only so much further to place the buildings upon which
it had been bestowed, in a serviceable state. With this view it
was that I recommended to the governor to stop the progress of a
large church, the foundation of which had been laid previous to
my arrival, and which, by the estimate of Mr. Greenway the
architect, would have required six years to complete. By a change
that I recommended, and which the governor adopted in the
destination of the new court-house at Sydney, the accommodation
of a new church is probably by this time secured, and would have
been obtained sooner if Mr. Greenway, the colonial architect, had
not succeeded in persuading Governor Macquarrie to allow the
addition of two semicircular projections in the centre of this
building, one of which might have formed an useful addition in
affording room for a vestry; but the other was constructed with
so little attention to the nature of the ground and to the width
of the street, that the principal object, which was that of
making a large ornamental entrance, was of necessity abandoned.
It was not, however, till a late period that this took place, and
a large square portico was substituted, by which the character of
the building will be preserved, and less encroachment will be
made upon the street. As I conceived that considerable advantage
had been gained by inducing Governor Macquarrie to suspend the
progress of the larger church, I did not deem it necessary to
make any pointed objection to the addition of these ornamental
parts of the smaller one; though I regretted to observe in this
instance, as well as in those of the new stables at Sydney, the
turnpike gate house and the new fountain there, as well as in the
repairs of an old church at Paramatta, how much more the
embellishment of these places had been considered by the
governor, than the real and pressing wants of the colony. The
buildings that I had recommended to his early attention in Sydney
were, a new gaol, a school-house, and a market-house: the defects
of the first of these buildings will be more particularly pointed
out when I come to describe the buildings that have been erected
in New South Wales; it is sufficient for me now to observe that
they were striking, and of a nature not to be remedied by
additions or repairs; the other two were in a state of absolute
ruin; they were also of undeniable importance and necessity.
Having left Sydney in the month of February 1820 with these
impressions, and with a belief that the suggestions I had made to
Governor Macquarrie respecting them had been partly acted upon,
And would continue to be so Burin my absence in Van my residence
in that settlement, the resumption of the work at the large
church in Sydney, and the steady continuation of the others that
I had objected to, especially Dieman's Land, it was not without
much surprise and regret that I learnt during the governor's
stables at Sydney. I felt the greater surprise in receiving the
information respecting this last-mentioned structure, during my
absence in Van Dieman's Laud, as the governor himself had upon
many occasions expressed to me his own regret at having ever
sanctioned it, and his consciousness of its extravagant
dimensions and ostentatious character. With such testimony of the
impression that it had made upon his own mind, I had not thought
it either necessary or decorous to wound Governor Macquarrie's
feelings by any further observations of an official kind than
those I have stated before; and it was not until I saw a
determination evinced on his part to neglect, during my absence,
the suggestions that I had previously made to him, that I
resorted to the authority with which I was invested by my
instructions, of protesting against all further continuance of
the church. I did not extend this protest to the two other
buildings, as I was not exactly apprized of the state they were
in, or of the extent of loss that might be occasioned by their
sudden suspension; but I did not fail to express to Governor
Macquarrie, in strong terms, the sense that I entertained of the
course that he was then pursuing, and briefly pointed out to him
the changes that appeared to me to be expedient in the general
management of the convicts. The consequence of my protest was an
early suspension of the building of the church, and in, the reply
in which this acquiescence in my views was communicated, the
governor professed his readiness to enter into and to support
them; but as I felt that even the governor's support would be
ineffectual, unless the general management of the convicts was
altogether changed, and placed in better hands than those to whom
it was then committed; and that the difficulties that would then
ensue from this change, as well as the conflict in which it would
involve me with old established practice and interests, would
require more of my personal attention than I could possibly have
devoted to them; I did not enter into any detailed explanation of
my views, but endeavoured thenceforward to impress the governor's
mind, with the expediency of devoting the great means at his
disposal, to the construction of works of urgent necessity, or of
solid utility to the colony; and with the great inexpediency of
prematurely introducing into a new colony a taste for ornamental
and expensive modes of building. I cannot here avoid noticing the
arguments used by the governor to justify, in your Lordship's
view, the increase of expense to the crown, by retaining so many
convict labourers in its service. It is alleged by him, that this
retention of them was a matter of necessity, arising out of the
incapacity of the settlers to receive or maintain them, on
account of the losses they had sustained by repeated floods; and
that the expense incurred in constructing the several edifices
then in contemplation or in progress, amounted to little more
than that which he alleged to be an unavoidable one, of
subsisting the convicts that could not be so received. Now, when
I come to consider the subject of employment of the convicts by
the settlers, it will be seen, that these objections either to
maintain or receive them have never so much arisen from their own
incapacity or poverty, as from the general incapacity for labour
in the servants assigned to them. At the period at which Governor
Macquarrie addressed this dispatch to your Lordship, two-thirds
of the convicts in the employ of government, consisted either of
mechanics, tradesmen, or useful labourers, whose distribution
amongst the settlers would not only have been gladly accepted by
them, but would have afforded the means, so long and so eagerly
desired by them, of constructing better buildings than those they
now possess. Even at a later period than that now referred to,
the principal superintendent of convicts, who must be considered
as an unwilling witness upon the subject of distributing good
mechanics or useful labourers to the settlers, admitted, that so
late as the month of November 1819, there would not only be a
sufficient demand for twenty or more, from six of the classes of
mechanics employed by government, but that if their services were
put up to sale in the colony, there would have been a competition
for them. To the strength of this testimony I can safely venture
to add my own, arising from the many applications that I received
for mechanics from different individuals, and which I should have
certainly forwarded to Governor Macquarrie, but for the
considerations of favour and obligation that were always
understood to accompany his acquiescence in these requests, and
of the entire inexpediency as well as impropriety of my incurring
any such obligation towards him. The demand for blacksmiths had
been so great in the district of Liverpool, that Governor
Macquarrie, at the solicitation of Mr. Moore, a magistrate, was
induced to give a ticket of leave to a convict transported for
life, who was joined soon after his arrival by his wife and some
other relations, for the purpose of establishing himself in that
town, and affording some facility to the settlers of the
districts of Airds and Appin, who, although at a distance of more
than twelve miles, derived some partial advantage from this
arrangement; therefore, although it may be admitted that Governor
Macquarrie was justified in selecting and retaining the best of
the mechanics and labourers for the government works that had
been approved as either necessary or expedient, yet I cannot
think that he was justified in stating to your Lordship the
refusal of the settlers to take the bad and inexperienced
convicts, as a reason for employing the best and most expert that
might successively arrive, in constructing buildings that had not
been approved by your Lordship; or for inducing you to sanction
the continuance of a system, productive of so much expense to the
crown, and so much real injury to the colony. Most of the
settlers had been so convinced of the impossibility of obtaining
mechanics, from repeated refusals and disappointments, that they
ceased to make application to Governor Macquarrie, and, for
reasons that have been stated before, would not apply to the
superintendent multiplied with the buildings that were
undertaken, they abandoned all hope of obtaining them. Two
consequences have followed from this system, the enhancement of
the price of the free labour of mechanics to the settlers in the
colony, and the prejudicial practice, to which they have been
obliged to conform, of paying these labourers in advance, and of
complying with their extravagant and capricious demands or
postponing, indefinitely, undertakings of great immediate and
general importance. Independently of these obvious consequences
of the system, it is clear that every practicable facility that
was afforded to the settlers in New South Wales for obtaining
useful labourers, that did not weaken the general control over
the convicts, and that by diminishing the cost of labour to the
settlers, augmented their means of employing them, operated as so
much saving to government in the expense of their subsistence;
and if, by a judicious and more liberal distribution of the
useful and expert convicts, many of those that were inexpert
could have been assigned e and subsisted free of expense, it was
surely a more rational and more economical mode of employment
than monopolizing all the useful convicts, subsiding them at a
the expense of government, and forcing, as it were, upon the
settlers a mass of useless and expensive labourers from whom they
were at all times desirous of relieving themselves.</p>
<p>I am well aware that part of the merits of this question will
depend upon the greater or less degree of necessity that existed
for the public buildings that have been erected in New South
Wales, and as that subject will be considered hereafter, I only
now wish to draw your Lordship's attention to the reason of
necessity alleged by Governor Macquarrie for obtaining your
sanction to the past and future employment of the convicts in the
government works at Sydney; and I trust, that I have now enlarged
sufficiently upon the nature and effect of that employment, to
convince your Lordship, that instead of being useful to the
convicts themselves, as Governor Macquarrie contends in his
letter to your Lordship, it has a tendency that is directly the
reverse.</p>
<p>Having made these observations upon the nature and effect of
the employment of the convicts in government work, I proceed to
describe the superintendence under which it is conducted.</p>

<i>Superintendence of Convicts in the service of
Government.</i></h3>
<p><small>THE</small> superintendence of the government convicts
in New South Wales is generally considered to be vested in the
person of William Hutchinson, who has filled the situation of
principal superintendent of convicts at Sydney since the 9th of
April 1814. The previous condition of this individual is
described in the evidence of Mr. Harris. During the period in
which he served as a convict at Sydney, he had charge of a small
gang of convicts employed about the town; but having been accused
of being accessary to the theft of a bale of slops from the
king's stores, that were found in his possession, he was tried
and sent to Norfolk Island, where he conducted himself well as
superintendent of convicts, and was recommended by
Lieutenant-colonel Foveaux to Governor Macquarrie on his arrival.
By his industry in Norfolk Island he acquired property, which,
like many other persons in that settlement, he found the means of
greatly improving by trade, and by selling considerable
quantities of pork to government. In the notification of his
appointment in the Sydney Gazette, a very elaborate enumeration
of his former services and merits, as well as those of his
predecessor Nicholls, was made by Governor Macquarrie, who has
lost no opportunities since that period of publicly testifying,
through the same channel, the sense he entertained of his merits
and integrity.</p>
<p>The salary of 75<i>l</i>. per annum, received by this
individual as principal superintendent, has been paid for several
years from the parliamentary grant, and until the 1st January
1820. Although the designation of the sum of 100<i>l</i>. per
annum, voted by parliament during this period, was always very
clearly expressed to have been in favour of a principal
superintendent of convicts, and not in favour of the principal
superintendent of government stock, who had always received it;
and although Governor Macquarrie's sense of Mr. Hutchinson's
merits, as well as his extended extended duties, had led him to
propose to your Lordship a more exceptionable mode of rewarding
him, by appointing him to the situation of wharfinger, the duties
of which he filled by deputy, it was not till the 1st of January
1820 that the misappropriation of the salary of 100<i>l</i>. was
discovered, and by an order then issued it was rectified.</p>
<p>The office of the principal superintendent of convicts is in
the lumber-yard at Sydney, and two convict clerks are constantly
employed there, in keeping the books and making entries, copying
returns of labour, writing orders for the signature of the
superintendent, numerical and nominal lists of the gangs of
workmen and labourers, and in receiving the applications of
individuals for convicts.</p>
<p>The nature and contents of these books are described in the
Appendix of Documents. The principal book is that which contains
the particulars of the arrivals of convicts in the colony.
Previous to the appointment of William Hutchinson these books
were very irregularly kept, and to the present period they are
deficient in affording means of reference to any convict who has
been some time in the colony; led except from the name of the
ship by which he arrived: the names of the convicts in each ship
are alphabetically arranged; but unless the ship is known, their
names at and particulars cannot be ascertained.</p>
<p>The first distribution that is made of the convicts at Sydney,
or to individuals in the country, on their own application, and
to the different districts, is inserted in the book of arrivals,
but no return is made to the principal superintendent of the
distribution of the latter by the magistrates in the country, or
is any note made of the subsequent changes that take place in the
condition of any, either by removal, death, or punishment. The
book of arrivals likewise comprehends all the particulars that
are detailed in the muster taken by Mr. Campbell, that has been
before adverted to, including the same results of the inquiries
into the treatment of the prisoners during their passage, as were
found in that document.</p>
<p>The superintendence of William Hutchinson, therefore, is
local, and confined to Sydney and the stations lately established
between that town and Paramatta.</p>
<p>The superintendents of convicts at Paramatta, Windsor, and Emu
Plains, make weekly returns of the convicts under their charge,
but do not make any regular or alphabetical register of the
changes or transfers of them, so as to afford the means of
pursuing the history, conduct, and condition of a convict in his
various situations in the colony, from his arrival to his
emancipation or death.</p>
<p>No correspondence appears to be maintained between the
magistrates of the colony and the principal superintendent; and
their reluctance to engage in it, arises, in some degree, from a
desire to preserve entire in their own hands, all control over
the convicts in their several districts, as well as to avoid all
intercourse with, or acknowledgment of superiority in an
individual, who in the memory of most of them, was in the
condition of a convict, and whose language, conversation, and and
deportment, make the contrast of that condition, with his present
prosperity of and his extensive patronage, still more prominent
and disadvantageous.</p>
<p>It will have been observed, that several of the duties
performed by the principal superintendent of convicts, partake of
those that more regularly appertain to the office of chief
engineer. This circumstance has arisen in a great measure from
the extension of the duties of that officer, during the last two
years, as well as from the perfect cordiality that has always
subsisted between them; Major Druitt never having felt any
repugnance to intercourse with the class of persons to whom the
its principal superintendent belongs, that has been, from causes
that will be explained in hereafter, the disturbing principle of
social and official intercourse in the colony of New South Wales,
ever since the early periods of the administration of Governor
Macquarrie. In the performance of these duties, the
superintendent of convicts may be said to attend more
particularly to their distribution and management, and to the
detection of their offences; the chief engineer, to their
employment, labour and punishment. In both I have observed, that
there is more of activity than method; and towards the convicts
that propensity to violence of language and abuse, that
insensibly becomes a habit in those to whom the irksome task is
committed, of enforcing compulsory labour, or wholesome
restraint, against refractory or vicious men. Both of these
officers have the power of recommending and selecting individuals
for the situation of overseers to the different gangs at Sydney
and on the roads; they are selected either on account of their
long services or particular skill and merits.</p>
<p>At the Sydney station, and on the roads, the number of
superintendents and overseers amounted to 77, of whom only 26
were free and 51 were convicts. At Paramatta, and the roads
adjoining, the number amounted to 13, of whom five were free and
eight were convicts. At Liverpool they amounted to five, of whom
one was free and four were convicts. At Emu Plains to seven, of
whom three were free and four were convicts. At Windsor to three,
of whom one was free and two were convicts. At Bathurst to two,
who were both free, making a total of 107, of whom 38 were free
and 69 were convicts. To this number may be added, nine clerks,
who are all convicts, and who are employed at the different
stations in the a offices of the superintendents.</p>
<p>By the return made in December 1820, these numbers remained
very nearly the same as in the preceding year.</p>
<p>The particular mode of their remuneration is described in the
Documents, and it appears at the last mentioned period, that the
salaries of 19 of the principal overseers in New South Wales,
exclusive of those employed at the factory at Paramatta and
Newcastle, amounted to 250<i>l</i>. charged in the parliamentary
estimates, and to a the sum of 546<i>l</i>. 5<i>s</i>. charged
and paid from the police fund of New South Wales. This, however,
is not the only species of remuneration; for to most of the
principal overseers, and to all the subordinate ones, are
assigned mechanics, tradesmen and labourers, amounting altogether
to 108, whose weekly ration, or whose weekly to stipend, or
sometimes both, are drawn in payment of the overseers; and 25 are
assigned off the store, and their earnings, or the gains they
make in pursuing occupations lawful or unlawful, constitute the
remuneration to their principals. To some of the overseers, who
are married and have children, an allowance of one-half or
one-fourth of a ration is made; and this allowance at the
different stations in New South Wales, amounted, in the month of
August 1820, to 36 daily rations and two-thirds. At Hobart Town,
in consequence of the advanced age of the person who has for some
time filled the situation of superintendent of convicts, and by
the strong and just sense entertained by Lieutenant-governor
Sorrell, Of the importance of personally watching over the
distribution of them, that duty has remained exclusively in his
hands. Fortunately, moreover, for the public service, the
auxiliary part that regards the changes which take place in the
removal of the convicts from their several gangs, either on
account of their sickness or punishment, or their return to the
labour of government, or to that of individuals, has been
performed by the acting engineer, Major Bell, or the magistrate
of police, Mr. Humphrey. The want of stationery has alone
interfered with the regular performance of these elutes in the
office of the acting engineer, and a reference to the documents
in the Appendix, furnished from the office of Mr. Humphrey, as
well as the return of offences committed by convicts in the
county of Buckingham, in Van Dieman's Land, in which their
several conditions are very accurately described, amply testify
the means and facilities possessed by these officers of tracing
the history and conduct of any convict that lands in that part of
the colony from the first day of his arrival to every place of
labour to which he may have been sent during his period of
service.</p>
<p>The great advantage derived from the connected jurisdiction of
these officers, is the constant knowledge of the employment and
conduct of the convicts that it affords to those through whom the
applications for mitigation of punishment are eventually to
proceed.</p>
<p>The only point in which a change appeared to me desirable,
would be the transmission of the passes granted by the chief
engineer to the government convicts on Sundays, to the magistrate
of the police. He is always made acquainted with their removal
from the service of government to that of individuals in the town
or country, and equally so with their return to it; and although
it is fit that the chief engineer should have the over that he
now exercises, of punting the passes, yet it is quite as
important, that the temporary destination of convicts receiving
them should be immediately communicated to the police, and be
then subject to all the rules that are observed in regulating the
movements of other convicts in the country.</p>
<p>At Hobart Town there are two superintendents of convicts,
Crowder and Lakeland, both of them receiving 50<i>l</i>. per
annum from the Parliamentary grant, and the last receives
25<i>l</i>. per annum from the police fund, as assistant
inspector of the works. Read, the superintendent of carpenters,
receives a salary of 50<i>l</i>. and there is also an overseer
under him, an overseer of the town gang, and one of the
lime-burners, each of whom receives a salary of 25<i>l</i>. per
annum from the police fund of Van Dieman's Land.</p>
<p>In addition to these, 22 overseers of working gangs were
employed on the 24th of March 1820, each receiving a ration and a
half, four having their families victualled, amounting in the
whole to two full rations, and fifteen of them having an
allowance of a single ration for a government man assigned to
them. Of these 22 overseers, two only are free. On the 19th
December 1820, a superintendent was appointed to a new road
party, who with his allowances and those to two government men
assigned, made an augmentation of three daily rations and a half;
giving a total of 53 daily rations and a half for the
remuneration of superintendents of work at this station.</p>
<p>At George Town and Launceston, at the same date, there was an
inspector of works receiving an annual salary of 91<i>l</i>.
5<i>s</i>. from the police fund. Two superintendents, Boothmen
and Sides, receiving salaries of 50<i>l</i>. each from the
parliamentary grant; a superintendent of carpenters, J. Moulds,
who received a salary of 50<i>l</i>. per annum from the police
fund; G. Hubbard, superintendent of boat builders, receiving the
same sum; with two overseers, Ogilvie and Blackball, each of whom
received salaries of 25<i>l</i>. per annum; making a total of
341<i>l</i>. 5<i>s</i>. of which 100<i>l</i>. was paid from the
parliamentary grant, and the remainder from the police fund of
Van Dieman's Land. In addition to these, 11 convict overseers
were employed, one of whom received an allowance of two men
victualled from the store, and two others received allowances of
one-half rations for their wives, and one-fourth for their
children, making a total of 36 rations and a half, as
remuneration to superintendents at this station.</p>
<p>The difficulty of finding fit persons to discharge the duty of
superintendents and overseers in the colony, seems to have
increased with the number of the convicts, and the complexity of
their occupations. At the period in which they were employed
under Mr. It. Fitzgerald, in the years 1792 and 1793, at the
establishment of Castle Hill and Toongabbee, many circumstances
concurred, both in his condition and theirs, to stimulate their
exertions and to combine the interest of the superintendent with
those of government. The most prominent of these circumstances
were the scarcity of food that prevailed at that time; the
universal demand for labour that existed, not only on the part of
government, but of individuals to whom convict labourers were
then very sparingly assigned, and the desire that was naturally
felt by the superintendent to recommend himself to his employers,
by a faithful and zealous discharge of his duty to government; a
desire that was then unimpeded by any views of his own. The
demand for labour was accompanied by severity in punishing all
neglect of it in the convicts; and this severity was not retarded
by the difficulties that now attend the investigation of
complaints of masters against servants. Punishments at that
period were more summary, and infinitely more severe, than they
are at present.</p>
<p>The agricultural operations, although limited to the use of
the hatchet and the hoc, admitted both the employment of the most
unpractised labourers, as well as an exact and severe
apportionment of their labour to their skill and strength. The
labour of government was not at that time the labour that the
convicts preferred. It was conducted at two places not then in
the immediate neighbourhood of any settlers, and one of these
places was distant three, and the other five miles, from the town
of Paramatta, and neither were infected by the luxurious
dissipation of that place, or by the temptations to plunder, that
the increasing opulence and property of the settlers has since
afforded.</p>
<p>The species of labour likewise, in which they were instructed,
was one that was in general use and demand; and when a convict
was assigned to a settler from the government works, he was not,
as at present, an useless incumbrance or expense, but he was
capable of immediately affording some return by his labour, for
the subsistence and clothing that was furnished to him. The
superintendents themselves were, from circumstances of the
moment, equally interested in augmenting the produce of the
government labour; and they did not then, as many of them do at
present, possess an interest that lies exactly the other way.</p>
<p>Considering the important and responsible nature of the duties
performed by the superintendents and overseers of convicts of the
different stations, it would have been very desirable, both to
have improved their character, in some instances to have
increased their number, and in every one, to have altered the
mode of their remuneration.</p>
<p>The power of assigning convict servants, upon their arrival,
and the means that are possessed by the superintendent of
exercising that power to the advantage or to the prejudice of
individuals in New South Wales, is one, the importance of which
seems to me never to have been sufficiently appreciated by
Governor Macquarrie; and the manner in which the superintendent
Hutchinson regarded it, and spoke of it to me, proved to me at
once that he considered it rather in the light of patronage than
of duty.</p>
<p>This subject will be more enlarged upon when the employment of
convicts by settlers is considered at present, and as far as it
regards the principal superintendent, it certainly appeared to
me, that the possession of such patronage by an individual who
was once in the degraded condition of a convict, more than the
Unwarrantable or corrupt use of it, was the cause of the many
complaints that were urged against him, from the earliest period
of my arrival in the colony to the latest hour that I remained in
it. It is truly stated by the superintendent, that he is liable
to be much mistaken in the qualifications of the convicts that he
assigns to the settlers on their first arrival; and that the
disappointments experienced in them are not in fairness to be
imputed to a wilful misapprehension of their capacities, for the
purpose of defeating the interests of the settlers and serving
his own. It frequently happens, that the desire of the convicts
to return to Sidney, after a short experience of the service of
the settlers, leads them to conceal their qualifications and
skill, and to create some cause of dissatisfaction to their
master, which terminates in their dismissal.</p>
<p>The number of mechanics and tradesmen that have arrived, and
have been assigned to individuals, from the year 1814 to the year
1820 is exhibited in the Appendix; and taking the number of those
who are considered most useful, it appears that 15 blacksmiths
out of 284; 16 carpenters and wheelrights out of 337; 8 sawyers
out of 15; and five bricklayers and brickmakers out of 284 that
have arrived, have been assigned during this period from convict
ships on their arrival; and 21 carpenters and wheelwrights, five
sawyers, seven bricklayers and brickmakers, and six blacksmiths,
have been assigned and lent from government works at Sydney,
during the same period.</p>
<p>Amongst the number of carpenters last described are five who
were allowed under an agreement to the persons who contracted to
build the Paramatta factory. The assignment of the mechanics is
made only upon the governor's order; but the selection of them
depends upon the good will of the chief engineer and the
superintendent of convicts. The governor's orders to them for
assigning mechanics are generally accompanied with a provision,
"that they are not wanted for government works or can be spared
from them"; and the discretion that these terms imply is
sufficiently comprehensive to afford to the chief engineer and
principal superintendent, a ready and perpetual ground of denial
to persons whom they may not wish to favour. Individuals,
therefore, who have received the governor's order, and sometimes
his promise of mechanics, have been frequently much surprised
that they have not been attended to; and considering the desire
that has been, shown by the chief engineer to carry on the
different works with rapidity, and the insensibility to the
benefits that the colony might have derived from a more liberal
participation in the large portion of mechanical labour and
skill, that in the period of seven years has been consigned to it
from England, I am not surprised that there should have existed
such a general dissatisfaction in the measure as well as in the
mode of his refusal. One instance occurred, in which I had an
opportunity of observing the want of discrimination that prevails
in the distribution of the convicts at Sydney, and the
insensibility to the advantages of placing convicts of previous
good character and conduct in situations of a certain degree of
responsibility.</p>
<p>Mr. Bowman, the principal surgeon, soon after his arrival, and
early in the year 1820, was desirous of obtaining five men as
attendants at the general hospital, that had been recommended to
him by Mr. Cunningham, surgeon of the Recovery convict ship, and
whose conduct during the passage he had full opportunities of
observing.</p>
<p>Several bad characters with whom the superintendent Hutchinson
was or ought to have been well acquainted (for I found them to be
described as such in his book of arrivals), had been sent to the
general hospital at the end of the preceding year, and as many of
them had either been dismissed or punished, Mr. Bowman was
desirous of replacing them, with men of a better description,
before the approach of the sickly season in the months of
February and March. He accordingly applied for the five men that
had been so recommended, but was informed by Governor Macquarrie
that as they were all farming, or good country labouring men,
they were reserved for such employments.</p>
<p>Upon inquiry it was found that the governor had been
misinformed; that three out of the five were seafaring men, one
was a coachman, and one a servant, and when this explanation was
afforded to him, the governor ordered two of the men to be sent
to the hospital according to Mr. Bowman's request. A subsequent
application of this officer to the principal superintendent for
four men, who had arrived by the convict ship Eliza, and had been
recommended by Mr. Bryden the surgeon, as fit for employment in
the hospitals, was rejected at the muster of the convicts, in the
gaol yard at Sydney, in consequence of the suggestion of the
principal superintendent to Lieutenant-governor Erskine, who
during the indisposition of Governor Macquarrie took the muster,
and who, without inquiry respecting the qualifications or
previous situations of the men, gave an order that they should be
retained until of the governor's pleasure should be known.</p>
<p>Being present at the muster, I had an opportunity of observing
the indecorous in manner in which the principal superintendent
treated the application that had been made by the principal
surgeon, and the implicit reliance that was placed on his
suggestion. The men in question were not sent, and although they
were healthy and; robust, they had not been agricultural
labourers.</p>
<p>These instances are adduced for the purpose of showing the
great power possessed; by the chief engineer and the principal
superintendent in the distribution of convicts, and the facility
with which it may be perverted even to the injury of the colonial
service.</p>
<p>I do not impute to these officers a direct intention of
producing that effect in the instances alluded to, but I
certainly think that their opposition to Mr. Bowman's requests
was attended with it, and that in this respect, as well as in the
application of the labour and assistance of government, they were
influenced by a feeling of personal hostility to this gentleman,
and that in indulging it the public interests were sacrificed. A
dispute had arisen between them at an early period after Mr.
Bowman succeeded to the situation of principal surgeon, in
October 1819, which originated in the reluctance he expressed to
allow his assistant surgeons to attend the be punishment of the
convicts, whenever they should be required so to do, without
reference to their duty in the hospital, and without due notice.
This reluctance on the part of the principal surgeon was met by
an equal reluctance on the part of the chief engineer and the
principal superintendent, either to forward the repairs and
alterations that were found necessary in the general hospital, or
to assign such convicts as could best be trusted in attendance
upon the sick. A return has been made to me, describing the
nature and extent of the repairs that have been made in the
hospital at Sydney during the period of the dispute, together
with Mr. Bowman's requisitions, and annexed to it is the
correspondence that took place between Governor Macquarrie and
Mr. Bowman respecting it. Much of the merits of the case depend
upon the relative importance of the assistance and attendance
required at the hospital, and of the work that was going on at
other places in Sydney at the same time. Now, on reference to the
requisitions of Mr. Bowman, it will appear that they were very
trifling in extent, compared with the benefit that was to be
derived to the hospital from an immediate attention to them; and
it is equally clear, that no work was then in progress at Sydney
that could enter into any comparison, in point of importance,
with the relief to the medical establishment that these repairs
were capable of conveying; and that they occasioned no sacrifice
of government labour which the extensive scale upon which it was
then conducted could not easily bear.</p>
<p>Governor Macquarrie, it appears, had given orders for making
some of them, and it is equally true that the execution of many
of these orders had been delayed; and at last the applications of
Mr. Bowman were so often repeated, and became so irksome to the
governor, that he requested them only to be addressed to him on
the first Monday in each month; a course of proceeding, by which
it is obvious that much of the benefit arising to the general
hospital from immediate repairs would be lost.</p>
<p>The most serious charge that was made by Mr. Bowman, against
Major Druitt, consisted in his refusal to send some additional
labourers, for the purpose of assisting to fetch water when it
became scarce, and when the hospital was crowded with sick. This
charge was not proved, as it did not appear that any written
requisition had been made by Mr. Bowman for such assistance, or
that he had pursued the same course of application for it to
Governor Macquarrie to which he had been in the habit of
resorting upon these occasions. The justification, however, that
has been attempted by Major Druitt, of his refusal, in case it
had occurred, explains the nature of the authority, as well as
reasoning, that he would have opposed to the requisitions of the
principal surgeon and strongly manifests the unwillingness always
evinced by this officer to afford facilities to any other branch
of the public service than to those with which he had a local and
personal connection.</p>
<p>With respect to the other superintendents and overseers in the
service of government, it appeared to me that the higher classes
were too much occupied by interests of their own to attend to the
labour of those under them; and that the inferior classes neither
possessed sufficient courage or integrity to compel the convicts
to work, or sufficient skill to direct them.</p>
<p>The difficulty of obtaining competent persons for the
performance of these duties, either from the free or convict
classes in New South Wales, has been felt at all times, and is
acknowledged both by the chief engineer at Sydney and the acting
engineer at Hobart Town. The temptation of high profits on
mechanical labour in the colony have always operated against the
voluntary service of convicts as overseers, after the period of
their compulsory service had ceased; and it has been found
necessary, to induce them to remain in the situation after they
had received emancipations, or, tickets of leave, by promises of
grants of land, by small pecuniary salaries, payable from the
police fund, and latterly, by allowing them to contact with
government for the erection of certain buildings; in which,
though an advantage is gained to government, by a reduction of
the price of the work, there is also a disadvantage in the loss
of the overseer's attention to his gang of workmen, which he
naturally transfers from thence to the work that is done under
his own contract. This circumstance was observable in a contract
made for the construction of a poor-house near Sydney, and for
that of a wall, inclosing 12 acres of ground, for the convict
garden, on one side of Hyde Park.</p>
<p>The elevation of the poor-house was drawn by Lawless, an
overseer of bricklayers, and an estimate of the expense having
been approved of by Governor Macquarrie, the work was undertaken
by Lawless and another overseer; government finding all the
materials, including the cutting of the stone. The amount of the
labour was paid from the police fund; and the only cost to the
contractors was that of the labour of bricklayer's, and
superintendence of the work. The assignment to these overseers of
government men, who are good bricklayers, provides them with one
part of the labour, and they derive the remainder from the
employment of convicts that are enabled to work on Saturdays, or
are indulged with a portion of government time for their own
benefit.</p>
<p>In the construction of the wall, an advertisement was inserted
in the Sydney Gazette for tenders, and the lowest tender made was
at the rate of 8<i>l</i>. per rod, the contractor furnishing
every thing; the price at which the same work was undertaken by
the two overseers was 2<i>l</i>. per rod, all the materials being
found by the government.</p>
<p>Several convicts, whose work it would have been the duty of
these overseers to have superintended, were employed at both
places; but there were a great many, nevertheless, that were
employed elsewhere, in whose work they had no interest, and to
whom they could not devote any portion of their attention. In
their absence the duty of superintendence devolves upon an
overseer of an inferior class, for whose integrity integrity in
enforcing labour and regular attendance there is no other
security than the treachery of the convicts employed under him,
and the chance of their informing against him.</p>
<p>It is the opinion of Major Bell, the acting engineer at Hobart
Town, and of Lieutenant Vandermeulen, acting engineer of George
Town, that a convict overseer dares not inform against any of his
men for misconduct, and that such a proof of his integrity, or an
exertion of his authority, would be visited by the enmity of the
whole of his gang; to a certain degree that is true; but, on the
other hand, it must be observed that many of the convicts, both
at Hobart Town and in New South Wales, have been punished on the
information of the overseers alone; many also for insolence
towards them, and a few for resistance. The manner in which the
overseers are remunerated in New South Wales and Van Dieman's
Land, has appeared to every one, capable of forming a judgment of
its effects, to be highly objectionable; it consists in the
allowance of a ration and a half, and the assignment of or more
convicts, who are in most cases victualled by government, and who
in return for the exemption that is allowed to them from all
control, and the pursuit of any occupation, engage to pay their
overseer a sum amounting to 5<i>s</i>. per week, if they allow
the overseer to draw their ration, and 10<i>s</i>. in case they
draw it themselves.</p>
<p>The effects produced by this arrangement on the convicts at
their first distribution, have already been observed, and in its
continuance is no less injurious to the system of discipline than
to the parties whom it is intended to remunerate. The condition
of the assigned convict becomes equal to that of one holding a
ticket of leave; and although a convict, he becomes in many
instances responsible to a person who is in no higher condition
than himself, many of the overseers being themselves convicts.
The selection of the assigned convicts being left principally to
the overseer, it is made with reference to the means of payment
possessed by them, and not to their characters or conduct; hence
it has happened that the most guilty individuals have enjoyed all
the privileges that were declared to belong exclusively to good
conduct, and that they have purchased them with money instead of
gaining them by long servitude.</p>
<p>The majority of the assigned convicts consist of tradesmen,
who are enabled by their industry to fulfil their engagement to
their overseer as long as their labour is in demand; and they are
protected from arrest by being furnished with passes, signed by
the superintendent, as a special protection in the districts to
which they may resort; but if the demand for their labour or
their industry should fail, or what more frequently occurs, if
the profits they may derive from it be spent in luxury and
excess, the weekly payment to the overseer falls into arrear, and
he is compelled to apply either to the magistrate for punishment,
or to the principal superintendent for the assignment of another
convict; again, if the employer of the assigned convict fails in
paying his wages, the overseer is not only a loser, but the
convict is returned to the service of government, by which a
certain degree of punishment is inflicted upon hint for the
default of another.</p>
<p>The only objection that was made by Governor Macquarrie to put
a stop to this species of remuneration, was the expense that
would be incurred by the substitution of payments in money from
the police fund, for the extra hall ration allowed to most of the
overseers, and for the stipendiary payment which they are
supposed to receive from the government men assigned to them. The
number of superintendents and overseers in New South Wales and
Van Dieman's Land, remunerated in this way, consist of 142, of
whom 42 were free, and 100 were convicts; the number of convicts
assigned to those in New South Wales amounted, in the month of
December 1820, to 85, and in the month of March of that year, it
amounted, at Hobart Town to 22, and at George Town to 11; making
a total of 118 assigned convicts victualled from the public
store. The value of their weekly ration, consisting of seven
pounds of meat and seven pounds of flour per man (which, at the
government price paid for these articles, and amounting to the
sum of 4<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. per man per week), would amount to a
yearly sum of 1,431<i>l</i>. 14<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. and the extra
half ration allowed to the overseers themselves amounting to
861<i>l</i>. 9<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. makes a total expense to the
Crown of 2,293 <i>l</i>. 4<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>. for remuneration
to superintendents and overseers in the shape of subsistence
only. Assuming that the weekly payment of 10<i>s</i>. by each
assigned convict to his overseer was regularly made, the annual
amount of it would (for 118 convicts so assigned) be
3,068<i>l</i>. of which one-fourth, or 767<i>l</i>. would have
been chargeable to the police fund of Van Dieman's Land, and the
remainder, or 2,301<i>l</i>. would have been chargeable to the
police fund of New South Wales.</p>
<p>Considering the extended scale upon which the works were
conducted at Sydney and in Van Themes Land, it did not appear to
me to be practicable to reduce the number of overseers or
superintendents, without very much improving their character and
efficiency; and as I found that competent persons of that
description could not be procured in the colony, my
recommendation to Governor Macquarrie was limited to the
substitution of a money payment, instead of an assignment of one
or more government men to them.</p>
<p>In this recommendation I was as much prompted by the opinions
I had received of the bad effects of the existing system, and of
the satisfaction with which the overseers themselves would view a
change in it, as by the urgent necessity that existed in the
colony of reducing, as much as possible, the expenditure of meat:
it might have been urged, that the simple curtailment of the
issue of that article to convicts, who when not assigned to the
overseers must necessarily derive their subsistence from some
other supply of meat within the colony, would not bring any
immediate or general relief in that respect. My recommendation,
however, embraced two objects, that of relieving the British
treasury from a charge, to which I conceived that the colonial
revenue was at that time competent, and which, if competent, it
ought to bear; and by converting the extra half ration allowed to
the overseers themselves into a money payment, or into an
allowance of other articles, such as tea and sugar, instead of
meat; to produce a saving of 70 rations or pounds of meat per day
to this class of persons alone, in the general expenditure of
meat in the colony there would then have remained only the
subsistence of the convicts assigned to the overseers.</p>
<p>From the individuals composing this class, the majority of
them would have found employment amongst the settlers or the
master workmen in the town of Sydney, and their subsistence in
those situations by their employers would have at once relieved
the British treasury from the cost of their maintenance, and
would have occasioned some economy in the general consumption of
fresh meat. Governor Macquarrie immediately acceded to that part
of my recommendation that substituted a different species of
ration for the extra allowance hitherto issued to the
superintendents and overseers, and equally extended it to all
other functionaries who had been paid in the same manner but
deferred the adoption of that which substituted the money payment
in the room of the assigned convicts, from an unwillingness to
create too heavy a pressure upon the colonial treasury. I felt it
my duty, however, to renew the recommendation on my departure
from the colony, and the governor gave me reason to believe that
he would adopt it.</p>

<i>Subsistence and Clothing of the Convicts retained by
Government and Employment of Female Convicts.</i></h3>
<p><small>THE</small> expense of the clothing and subsistence of
the convicts in New South Wales and Van Dieman's Land,
constitutes the largest proportion of the general expenses of the
colony. Some contribution towards this expense is made from the
labour of the female convicts that are employed in the Paramatta
factory and since the last general issue, directed to be made in
the month of August, of the year 1818, the demand for clothing
had so much increased, and so small a portion had been received
from England, that an extra quantity of labour was given to the
female convicts, and they received payment for it from the police
fund. It was with great difficulty that the supply of clothing
for the convicts in the employ of government could be provided
for. Those at George Town, in Van Dieman's Land, were suffering
severely from want of it in the commencement of the winter of
1820 and a great arrear continued due to the convicts that had
been assigned to settlers on receiving grants of land in New
South Wales at the end of that year, with the single exception of
those assigned to Lieutenant-governor Erskine, in his capacity of
settler. Independent of these causes, it frequently occurred that
convicts were returned to government employment by the settlers,
so destitute of clothing, that it became absolutely necessary to
furnish them with a certain portion, which generally consisted of
half-worn clothes left by convicts who were assigned from the
government gangs, and who were allowed to take only one full suit
with them, in consequence of their improper disposal or use of
any larger quantity.</p>
<p>On the arrival of every convict in New South Wales, a suit of
clothing is given to him, consisting of a coarse woollen jacket,
and waistcoat of yellow or grey cloth, a pair of duck trowsers, a
pair of worsted stockings, a pair of shoes, two cotton or linen
shirts, a neckhandkerchief, and a woollen cap or hat. A singular
exception was made to this issue during my residence in Van
Dieman's Land, in consequence of the scarcity of government
clothing. The convicts that had been sent out in the Prince
Regent transport from Ireland, had been remarkable for the care
they had taken of their clothing; and as it consisted of the grey
cloth of that country, it was found to be stronger and more
durable than any other. Upon the debarkation of these convicts,
their spare clothing was taken away and sent to George Town,
where it certainly was more urgently required; but the effect
that this surrender produced urn their dispositions was very
unfavourable, in their reluctance to labour, and their wilful
destruction of the clothes they had procured. A similar
deprivation of their new slop-clothing took place on the arrival
of the Dromedary store ship, and the debarkation of the greatest
number of the convicts at Hobart Town.</p>
<p>The issue of clothing to the government convicts ought
regularly to be made to them every six months. It consists of a
woollen jacket or frock, and trowsers of the colonial
manufacture, a pair of shoes, and a linen shirt, made up in the
lumber yard at Sydney. The convicts that are exposed to harder
labour in the quarries, and the carters and bullock drivers, each
receive a pair of shoes every three months. The summer clothing
to the convicts in the barracks, consists of a canvas smock
frock, one linen or cotton shirt, two pair of trowsers, (one of
which ought to be reserved for use on Sundays) one pair of shoes,
and one cap. Until the end of the year 1820, these supplies were
furnished from the old canvas and sheeting that were found in the
commissariat stores, and that had remained there for several
years. The convicts out of barrack have had no regular
slop-clothing issued to them for two years; but their allowance
differs in no respect from that of the convicts in the
barrack.</p>
<p>The chief engineer is of opinion that some loss is occasioned
in the issue of clothing to the convicts when made up, and that
it would be better to issue it as it is wanted, and according to
the size of the wearer, than to adhere to the present practice of
a general issue to the convicts of every ship on their arrival,
which, when made at one and the same time, is followed by
absolute loss, or a disposal of it for money, which the convicts
lay out in the purchase of spirits. A regulation of that kind
would certainly be useful; but according to the present scale of
employment of the government convicts, it would require a much
more accurate account of the issues of clothing than is now kept
in the convict barrack at Sydney; and it would also occasion a
more entire separation of the tradesmen employed in making it up
from the other mechanics in the lumber yard, than that which its
present limits would allow.</p>
<p>The largest portion of the clothing for the convicts, that
has, for the last few years, been sent with them for distribution
on arrival, consisted of a coarse yellow cloth; it is not so
strong as the grey cloth worn by the convicts, and brought with
them from Ireland; but it possesses the advantage of being
conspicuous, which the other does not, and of exhibiting more
distinctly the marks that may be put upon it. It is observed by
the chief engineer, that the issue of coarse woollen stockings to
the convicts is an expense that might well be spared; and this
observation is confirmed by the general practice of the labouring
classes of the colony of New South Wales, who rarely or ever make
use of them. The expense also of issuing waist-coats to the
convicts destined for New South Wales is unnecessary, as they
rarely rat make use of them, and they only afford the means of
procuring spirituous liquors. The difference between the climate
of Van Dieman's Land and New South Wales will not admit of the
reduction of those articles from the dress of the convicts at
transported thither.</p>
<p>Much inconvenience and some expense has been incurred lately,
by an occasional change that has been made of the ordinary yellow
clothing, for uniforms of certain foreign corps, which, probably
from reasons of economy, were converted to this purpose, and
applied to the use of the convicts on their arrival in New South
Wales. These uniforms consisted of blue and red cloth jackets and
waistcoats, with a military button, and they so much resembled
the regimental undress uniforms of the army, that on the
application of the chief engineer, they were dyed before they
were issued to the convicts. The black military caps that
accompanied these uniforms, were considered to be equally unfit
for the use of the convicts in a place where it was important to
preserve every external mark that might serve to distinguish
them, and to obliterate every mark that might tend to confound
them with the military; the caps were therefore reduced into the
shape of common hats before they were issued, and the expense was
defrayed from the police fund.</p>
<p>The management of the clothing of the convicts was voluntarily
undertaken by the chief engineer, at the desire of Governor
Macquarrie, and an account of the issues is kept at the convict
barrack. A return of the clothing issued from the month of June
in the year 1819 to 31st of August 1820, and from that time to
the 24th of January 1821, is to be found in the Appendix; it is
signed by Major Druitt, the chief engineer, but the
recapitulations are in many places incorrectly stated. An account
of clothing issued from the lumber yard at Sydney, has been kept
by the present storekeeper, since the month of December 1819. It
had been previously kept in a very clean and distinct manner by
William Noah, an emancipated convict, who at the end of the year
1819 received a pension of 20<i>l</i>. per annum for his services
in the office of storekeeper. The principle that has prevailed in
the distribution of the slop-clothing and bedding, has been that
of affording a supply in the first instance, to the road parties
and to the workmen who were most exposed, and of allowing a very
sparing supply to the settlements in Van Dieman's Land; this last
principle appeared to me to be indefensible, when viewed either
with reference to the comparative value of the services of the
convicts in those settlements, or to the greater necessity for
good and regular clothing that exists in a cold than in a mild
temperature. At the suggestion of Major Druitt, the terms upon
which the wool had been manufactured into cloth at the Paramatta
factory have undergone some change. It was the custom, until the
year 1819, to receive five pounds of wool from the settlers who
received in exchange one yard of cloth, as it was calculated that
four pounds of wool would, when manufactured, give that quantity
of cloth. The surplus of one pounce of wool was considered as a
remuneration to government for the expense of manufacture; and
when made into cloth, was sent to the commissariat stores, to be
issued when required. Since the period above mentioned, coarse
wool has been purchased from the settlers by the chief engineer
at Sydney, and the acting engineer at Hobart Town, and it has
been sent to Paramatta, and manufactured there in the factory.
Since the period in which the first purchases of wool were made,
the price rose from 5<i>d</i>. and 6<i>d</i>. to 10<i>d</i>. per
pound, and towards the end of the year 1820, none of the inferior
quality could be procured in New South Wales at that price; it
was therefore purchased and transmitted from Van Dieman's Land.
The calculation of the cost of two suits of slops, made of the
cloth manufactured at Paramatta, of which a specimen is contained
in the case No. 22, and further comprising four pair of shoes and
two caps, made in the colony, makes it amount to 3<i>l</i>.
2<i>s</i>. per annum. To this amount is to be added the cost of
two shirts, not included in the calculation, but estimated at
12<i>s</i>.; a bed and bedding, consisting of two rugs, and
amounting to 2<i>l</i>. 15<i>s</i>.; giving a total annual
expense of 6<i>l</i>. 9<i>s</i>. for the clothing and bedding of
each convict.</p>
<p>In consequence of the scarcity of clothing that I observed
generally throughout the government establishments, I had
frequently recommended to Governor Macquarrie to purchase cloth
from the manufactory of Mr. Lord at Sydney, and more especially
for the purpose of completing the issue of slop-clothing to the
constables of the different districts, which had been for some
time greatly in arrears The objection of Governor Macquarrie to
adopt this recommendation always proceeded from the heavy expense
that it would occasion to the police fund, and the expectation of
receiving early supplies from England. This expectation was not
realized until the end of the year 1820, when a part of the suits
only arrived, and a regular and entire issue was not
practicable.</p>
<p>By the 4th and 5th regulations relative to the convict
barrack, dated in May 1819, the care and management of the
clothes and linen of the convicts was assigned to the deputy
superintendent of that establishment, but from want of attention
to this part of his duty, and from want of sufficient room for
storing the linen after it was washed, and lastly, from the
perpetual loss and wilful destruction of the clothing by the
convicts themselves, very little benefit had been derived from
these regulations. The appearance of the convicts on Sundays did
not mark any want or personal cleanliness, but their dress showed
an entire neglect of it. In this observation, however, I should
not include the convicts of the carters barrack, where there
always prevailed a greater degree of attention to cleanliness and
order than in any other establishment; nor to the principal part
of the convicts who were not in barracks. Their general
appearance at the muster before the church doors at Sydney and
Paramatta was cleanly and decent. The hammocks and bedding in the
convict barrack, as well as the sleeping rooms, were kept in a
very clean state; and although there was no regular allowance of
soap made to the convicts, yet sufficient was issued to them for
ordinary purposes; to water troughs and towels were always kept
in readiness in the mornings before they went to their work, and
bathers were attached to the barrack, who were made to shave the
convicts regularly twice a week. At Hobart Town, at the muster of
the convicts on Sundays, I observed a greater variety of dress;
and as there existed no order for obliging the convicts to appear
in that which is issued on their arrival, those who can afford it
purchase ordinary apparel, or wear that which they bring out with
them. This distinction appeared to me to prevail chiefly amongst
the convicts transported for forgery, and for uttering forged
notes, and it has given rise to the use of a term that is applied
in derision to all such convicts as can afford, or are permitted
to wear their own coats, instead of the short jackets provided by
government.</p>
<p>At George Town the want of clothing has already been observed
upon; by the evidence of Lieutenant Vandermeulen, it appears to
have prevailed to such a degree as to have diminished the
quantity of work, although it did not affect the health of the
convicts. At the period of my visit to George Town in the month
of April 1820, 50 convicts, out of those who were mustered on a
Sunday morning, were without shoes, and 27 were without
jackets.</p>
<p>The weekly rations issued to the convicts employed by
government have undergone many variations since the arrival of
Governor Macquarrie in New South Wales. On the 21st of January of
the year 1810, an order was made for 11&frac12; lbs. of wheat, 7
lbs. of beef, or 4 lbs. of pork, 6 oz. of sugar, or 1 lb. of
wheat, or 2 lbs. of maize. In the month of March of that year, an
alteration was made in the quantity of wheat to settlers, free
persons and prisoners, and 6 lbs. of wheat and 13 lbs. of maize
were issued. In the month of January 1814, the same ration was
reduced to 6 lbs. of bread, 1&frac12; lb. of sugar, and 1 lb. of
rice. In July of that year it was increased to 7 lbs. of bread,
1&frac12; lb. of sugar, and half a pound of rice and in the month
of September this ration of bread was ordered to be composed of
one-third of Indian corn meal. In the month of March 1815 the
ration issued to the troops consisted of 13 lbs. of wheat; and to
every other class it consisted of 10 lbs. of wheat and 6 lbs. of
maize; and in the month of August of the same year, the first of
these rations was reduced to 11&frac12; lbs. of wheat, with 6 oz.
of sugar; and to the other classes comprising convicts, 8&frac12;
lbs. of wheat, 6 lbs. of Indian corn, and 6 oz. of sugar. The
same scale of rations, with similar and occasional deductions,
continued to be issued until the 16th August 1817, when in
consequence of a scarcity of wheat, a general reduction of the
rations took place, and 6 lbs. of wheat, 1&frac12; lb. of sugar,
and 1 lb. of rice were issued to all classes, but an augmentation
was made in the quantity of meat from 7 lbs. to 8&frac12; lbs. On
the 20th September of the same year, a further reduction of the
wheat ration took place from 6 lbs. to 3 lbs.; with an addition
of 6 oz. of sugar and 1 lb. of rice. And on the 27th December
1817, the usual full ration of it 11&frac12; lbs. of wheat, 7
lbs. of beef or 4 lbs. of salt pork, with 6 oz. of sugar, was
resumed.</p>
<p>On the 1st May 1819, when the convict barrack was established,
the weekly-ration of every convict in the employ of government,
was raised to 10&frac12; lbs. of meat, and the same quantity of
flour; and in December of the same year, (with a view to diminish
the consumption of animal food) a substitution was made, for
3&frac12; lbs. of fresh meat, or of salt pork, in each ration, by
giving an additional quantity, either of flour amounting to 7
lbs. or a smaller proportion of pease, oatmeal, tea, sugar or
rice, according to the state of those supplies in store.</p>
<p>On the 22d September 1820, the rations issued by government to
all descriptions of persons were reduced to 7 lbs. of beef or
mutton, or 4 lbs. of pork, 7 lbs. of flour, 1 lb. of sugar, and a
quarter of a pound of tea; and by a government and general order,
wherein it is stated, that a representation had been made to the
governor, that the portion of this ration, consisting of 7 lbs.
of flour, was not adequate to the support and nourishment of a
man; his excellency directed, that 3&frac12; lbs. of maize,
should be added to that quantity of flour, and that this increase
should be made to every ration except those of the military.
Doubts having arisen whether this quantity of maize was intended
to mean the grain, or the flour of maize, it was declared, in a
subsequent general order, that a quantity of maize in grain,
equal to 3&frac12; lbs. of maize flour, should constitute the
additional ration; and so constituted the rations continued to be
issued to all convicts in the employ of government, from the date
of the last order up to the period of my departure from the
colony in the month of February 1821. The last reduction of the
quantity of meat in the rations took place in consequence of the
suggestions that I made to Governor Macquarrie, respecting the
diminutions of the grazing stock of the colony, and to which I
have already adverted. The ration therefore that was ordered to
be issued on the 22d September 1820, continues to be the ration
of the convicts in the employ of government, at all the stations
in New South Wales, excepting that of Newcastle; and it is
understood, that in return for this ration, the whole of the
labour of every day, except Saturday, is devoted to the work of
government.</p>
<p>At Hobart Town, in Van Dieman's Land, in consequence of the
convicts having to procure lodging and washing for themselves,
they are dismissed from government work at three o'clock; and
receive for their weekly ration only 7 lbs. of fresh meat, or 4
lbs. of salt pork, and 7 lbs. of flour, or what is called the
single ration, in contradistinction to the ration issued to the
convicts in New South Wales, and which is called the ration and a
half.</p>
<p>At George Town, as the system of lodging and labour is
understood to be the same as that in New South Wales, the ration
is the same.</p>
<p>At Sydney, and since the establishment of the convict barrack,
the rations for the convicts who live out of barrack are drawn on
Saturdays by the overseers, and one man of each of the gangs that
are in Sydney and the neighbourhood, their numbers having been
certified on the preceding evening to the principal
superintendent of convicts, who signs and certifies the whole,
after comparing them with the former returns in his office. On
the Saturday mornings the overseers attend and receive these
rations, and distribute them to the men, who are in attendance
for that purpose. The rations to the convicts in the barracks in
Hyde Park, the carters barrack, and at the establishment at Grose
Farm, are drawn by and issued to the deputy superintendent of the
convict barrack on Mondays and Thursdays; and he certifies to the
principal superintendent on Fridays the number of rations that
may be required for the week. These certificates and returns are
countersigned by the chief engineer.</p>
<p>Wherever the convicts are lodged in barracks, the rations both
of meat and flour are cooked and baked for them there; those
issued to the road parties are distributed by the overseers, and
cooked by the convicts in their separate huts. Care has not been
always taken to give a regular allowance of salt to the road
parties; and in the heat of summer the meat has been touched very
soon after it was issued. With the exception of one occasion, in
which it happened that some ill cured pork, imported from the
Society Islands, and some equally ill cured beef and mutton from
Van Dieman's Land, was issued as rations in the month of January
820, I did not observe any defect in the quality of the meat
issued to the convicts, nor did I receive any complaints from
those to whom I addressed observations on the subject. I attended
both at Windsor and at Paramatta, and in Van Dieman's Land, at
the distribution of the meat on several occasions, and had reason
to be satisfied that it was as impartially made as the
circumstances would admit. The management of the victualling
deportment at the convict barracks is assigned to the deputy
superintendent Gandle. The chief engineer made a point of
attending at the barrack at the dinner hour several days in the
week, to inspect the messes, and to attend to complaints
respecting the food, and informed me that he had never observed
the quantity to be deficient.</p>
<p>Under the first order that was made, respecting the rations of
the government convicts, dated 1st May 1819, and which has been
in operation ever since that period, it was not likely that any
complaint of that nature Amid be made, for, on reference to the
sixth article of the regulations of the convict barrack, it will
be found that the daily allowance of each convict afforded him
two pounds of bread and a pound and a half of meat when fresh
meat was issued, and one pound of salt beef or mutton, and
fourteen ounces of salt pork when salted provisions were issued,
and to these last a small addition of potatoes or pumpkin. A
reduction of this allowance to one pound of meat and one pound of
flour was made upon my suggestion, in consideration of the
advanced age, or of the lighter labour of particular classes; and
in the month of February 1820, when the convict boys were removed
to the carters barrack, a reduction of their daily allowance took
place, and it was made to constitute a part of the punishment for
their numerous offences. Those however who behave well, still
continue to receive the same allowance as the adults.</p>
<p>An allowance of 2&frac12; lbs. of salt is made for every 100
loaves of bread, and half a pound of salt is allowed to each man
per week, when fresh meat is issued. In addition to these issues,
an allowance of vegetables is ordered to be made by the sixth
regulation, when they can be conveniently procured, but no
specific quantity is stated; and unless rations of salt meat are
issued, they are only mixed with the soup. The mode in which
these vegetables were supplied requires some observation. Upon my
first inquiry respecting this matter, I was informed that they
continued to be purchased of a particular individual, until the
garden that has been described before, and that is contiguous to
the convict barrack, should be completed. From further
information and inquiry, I found that the person who sold them,
and who received occasional payments, that appeared from time to
time in the accounts of the police fund, was a convict assigned
to Major Druitt, the chief engineer, but not victualled by
government. This man and another convict, and two soldiers of the
48th regiment, I found to be employed in the cultivation of a
small piece of land near Sydney, consisting of five acres, that
had been originally cleared and fenced by the soldiers of the 73d
regiment, who received payment for their labour from the police
fund. The garden continued to be cultivated by the 46th regiment,
and for the purpose of supplying them with vegetables, but it
does not appear that it was very productive in their hands. On
the arrival of the 48th regiment, Major Druitt, the chief
engineer, undertook several improvements in it, and having
received a grant of a small allotment immediately adjoining to
the military garden, some labour and expense were bestowed upon
both pieces of land; and a front paling towards the Sydney road
was put up by the direction of Governor Macquarrie, and at the
expense of government. At the same expense this paling has been
advanced, and has encroached too much upon the principal entrance
to the town of Sydney. The soil of this military garden is loose
sand; but with the large supply of manure that it has lately
received, it has been made productive. The vegetables raised in
it, as well as those in the garden of Major Druitt, immediately
adjoining, were sold by his assigned convict, whose name was
Bull, to the deputy superintendent of the convict barrack; and
the quantities received, and the sums paid for them, appear in
the return signed by the chief engineer. The price charged for
these vegetables was lower than that of vegetables purchased in
the Sydney market, and lower than the contract price paid by the
commissariat department; but, as far as my own observations went,
and at the occasional visits I made to the convict barrack, I
found the vegetables to be of a very inferior description; and it
also appeared to me, that the mode of supplying them was equally
objectionable, as the same person whose duty it was to check both
the quantity and the quality of the vegetables supplied to the
convicts derived a profit from the sale of a certain, though a
small portion of the supply, and had the sole management of the
fund to which the proceeds of the larger portion were applied. I
did not fail to point out this circumstance to the notice of
Governor Macquarrie, and to press the conclusion of all the
operations connected with the cultivation of the convict garden,
which I had perceived to be proceeding more slowly than the
urgency of the work demanded; and which, both for purposes of
economy and for punishment, ought to have been completed sooner.
The governor agreed with me as to the impropriety and suspicious
nature of the manner of supplying the vegetables, but did not
seem disposed to put a stop to it until the convict garden was
finished. Latterly, however, the supply of vegetables was derived
from the cultivation of a garden near the carter's barrack, which
by a great abundance; and also from the cultivation of some very
bad land in front of the governor's stables at Sydney, in which,
after a vain attempt had been made to grow a crop of barley,
several loads of bad potatoes were, with difficulty, raised. In
consequence of this assistance a larger portion of vegetables was
conveyed to the military barracks, from the military garden, for
the use of the 48th regiment, whose funds, it will appear
afterwards, had derived pecuniary assistance from the sale of
their produce to the convicts.</p>
<p>Soon after the barrack at Paramatta had been open for their
reception, Governor Macquarrie made arrangements for the
appropriation of an adjoining piece of land for a garden and the
cultivation of it was to be undertaken immediately, for the sole
use and supply of the convicts at that station. Making due
allowance for the increased quantity of labour required from the
government convicts, upon the change that took place in lodging
them at the opening of the barrack in the month of June 1819, as
well as the liberal scale upon which it had been issued to them
on all the periods when the supply of the colony admitted it, the
augmentation of the ration that took place at that period in the
article of meat, appears to have been large, and when compared
with the allowance of animal food, ordered to be made by the
settlers to their convict servants, it is still more
considerable. That allowance consists of seven pounds of fresh or
salt meat, or four pounds of pork, and eight pounds of wheat per
week, but this latter quantity is by most of the settlers raised
to fourteen pounds. In comparison with the military ration, the
government ration to the convicts must be considered as
extravagant; and although the rules and long established practice
of the colony had sanctioned a larger allowance of wheat or
flour, and that some difference may be fairly allowed to exist
between the work of a convict and that of a soldier, yet it is to
be regretted, that Governor Macquarrie, in his public order of
the 7th October 1820, should have described that allowance which
had been authorized by the warrant of His Royal Highness the
Prince Regent, "as inadequate to the support of a man".</p>
<p>Its inadequacy is certainly contradicted by the early
experience of the colony, when with the addition of one pound of
rice it constituted the ration of the convicts who then worked in
the service of government; and it is still more palpably
contradicted, by the adoption of the same ration by the military
in New South Wales, since the promulgation of the Prince Regent's
order there, on the 28th January 1818.</p>
<p>Another important difference appears always to have existed
between the ration of government and that of settlers, in the
larger proportion of maize that the latter has contained than the
former. The proportion of the flour of this grain to that of
wheat, in the daily consumption of the lower classes of the
inhabitants, is stated by. an intelligent witness to have nearly
amounted to one half; and although not considered so palatable as
wheaten flour, is, notwithstanding, very nutritious. It appears
to have constituted a part of the government ration in those
periods only when wheat was scarce, though not in a larger
proportion than one-third, so that in this point of view, the
government ration of bread has been superior to that of the
settlers. It has been generally understood in the colony, that
Governor Macquarrie entertained objections to the use of this
grain, in consequence of some unskilful admixture of it in the
rations issued to the 73d regiment, and has therefore resisted
the recommendations of individuals, as well as the strong grounds
that will hereafter appear to exist in favour of the general and
regular introduction of it into the flour ration of the convicts.
Until the introduction of the flour of this grain for the
breakfast of the convicts can be generally adopted, the present
ration, as finally fixed by the government and general order of
the 7th October 1820, is not larger than the labour of a convict
requires; it allows the use of tea and sugar, articles that are
not generally allowed by settlers to their servants, and are
considered luxuries; but as a certain supply of milk is allowed
to them, and as they have an opportunity of appropriating part of
their wages in the purchase of articles of luxury, which the
government convicts have not, the present government ration may
be considered nearly as an equivalent to that of the settlers.
The annual expense of this ration, calculated according to the
prices of the articles that composed it in the month of September
1820, amounted to the sum of 16<i>l</i>. 0<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. It
must be observed, that the extensive scale upon which the
government convicts have been lately employed, has very much
augmented the responsibility of those whose duty it has been to
certify the number entitled to draw rations from the king's
stores. Until the establishment of the convict barrack at Sydney,
the convicts in the employ of government used to attend at the
store and receive their rations from thence, in messes of six;
but as they were not always accompanied by their overseers, their
identity could not always be established; rations might have
been, and were, drawn for convicts who were not entitled to them.
Subsequently to that period, and to prevent these abuses, the
overseer of each gang is made to attend to draw the rations for
those out of barrack, having on the day preceding made out and
signed a nominal list of the men that compose their gang, which
is seen and checked by the principal superintendent, who signs
it, and it is then an authority to the storekeeper and the
officers of the commissariat department to issue and charge the
rations. For all those lodged in the barracks, the deputy
superintendent makes requisitions of meat and other supplies,
according to the number actually lodged in the barracks; a
numerical list so signed is sent to the storekeeper on the Friday
evening, and the provision returns are signed weekly by the
deputy superintendent of the convict barrack.</p>
<p>The commissariat officers have no check whatever upon either
of these returns, and it must depend altogether upon the
integrity and correctness of the different overseers, whether the
number of rations drawn does not exceed the number of convicts in
their gang, and living out of the barracks. A greater degree of
responsibility attaches to the returns made from the convict
barracks to the commissariat store at Sydney, from the carter's
barrack, and from Grose Farm. It is assumed, that the changes
that take place in the numbers of convicts received in and
discharged from those places during the week, are correctly
stated; those returned by the settlers, and placed in the
government gangs, are only received on Fridays, and they are
taken on charge only on that day; but several removals of the
convicts from one gang to another, from the town to the barrack,
from Paramatta to Sydney, or from Grose Farm and the carter's
barrack to the barrack in Hyde Park, take place in the middle of
the week, and as the service may require; and the correctness of
the charge made for their rations is altogether in the hands of
an emancipated clerk to the deputy superintendent Gandle, who
keeps the weekly account of the increase and decrease that takes
place in each week. Men who are discharged from the hospital,
after the commencement of the victualling week, would remain
without rations until the Friday, unless this mode of keeping the
accounts were adopted, or a more frequent issue from the store
were practicable. At the other stations in New South Wales the
rule is invariably observed, of receiving convicts on the
victualling returns on Fridays only; the former practice in the
Sydney hospital the convicts were retained there after they were
convalescent, and until the Friday in each week; present they are
discharged whenever they are found convalescent, and without
reference to the commencement or the termination of the
victualling week, an arrangement that is beneficial to the
hospital, but that creates the necessity of giving a more
extensive control over the issues to the deputy superintendent of
the barrack. The weekly returns that are kept at the convict
barrack contain the names of every convict, the gang, the date
when and from whom received, and finally, the increase and
decrease that takes place in each week; and entries are made of
all the returns in books kept in the office of the principal
superintendent, at the lumber-yard in Sydney. The principal
superintendent and the chief engineer are the only persons who
hold any check, either upon the correctness of these weekly
returns, or of the requisitions that are made by the deputy
superintendent to the commissariat officer of the number of
rations. The correctness of the weekly returns made by the
different overseers, of the number and names borne upon their
several lists, can only be checked and observed by their
occasional and unexpected visits to the gangs, and muster of
them. Some of these gangs, it has been seen, are employed at some
distance from Sydney, and it is admitted by the chief engineer
and the principal superintendent, that the efficacy of their own
control consists more in the information that they receive of the
connivance of the overseers in the absence of the convicts under
them, than in the regularity of their visits to them; evil, which
is inseparable from a variety of works and increases with it,
induced me at all times to recommend to the chief engineer, as
much as possible, to concentrate his operations in one spot, and
to bring them as near as possible to the convict barrack. It was
partly with this view that I recommended Governor Macquarrie to
convert the court-house in Hyde Park into a church, to expedite
the building of the wall round the convict garden, and that I at
last gave a reluctant consent to the construction of a new gaol
in the immediate neighbourhood of Hyde Park, instead of adhering
to the plan of building it upon an elevated situation in another
and more distant part of the town, upon the site of an old
battery, now dismantled, and called Fort Philip.</p>
<p>The nature of the control, exercised over this branch of
expenditure at Hobart Town, is marked by the same spirit of
vigilance and method that has already been observed to exist in
that settlement. The changes that take place in the receipt or
discharge of the government convicts during the week, are all
noted by the acting engineer, Major Bell; and a list of the
convicts so changed is signed by him, and transmitted to the
lieutenant-governor, who also affixes his signature to it, and it
is then an authority to the officer in the commissariat
department to issue the rations.</p>
<p>A detailed estimate of the weekly expense of the maintenance
clothing and employment of a convict in the work of government,
in New South Wales, and without including that which is incurred
for superintendence, police and medical attendance, is to be
found in the Appendix. According to the price and scale of the
rations of the year 1819, the annual expense is found to amount
to the sum of 26<i>l</i>. 17<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. and in the year
1820, to the sum of 24<i>l</i>. 14<i>s</i>.</p>
<p>The estimate made of the proportionate value that the labour
of a convict, working for government, bears to that of a free
labourer working for himself, is differently stated by the
principal superintendent of convicts and the chief engineer; the
former rating it at two-thirds less, and the latter at one-third,
which is also the calculation made by Major Bell, the acting
engineer at Hobart Town.</p>
<p>The average rate of the earnings of mechanics in government
employ at Sydney, is stated in a return made by the principal
superintendent of convicts; but it is made with reference to the
calculation of the value of the labour of a convict, made by the
chief and acting engineer. From my own observation of the manner
in which the convicts worked at all the stations, I should be
much more disposed to adopt the calculation of the principal
superintendent than that of the chief or acting engineer; and
this observation was confirmed by the opinion of most of the
persons who were conversant with the nature of convict labour in
New South Wales. The expense to which the employment of the
convicts in the government works has led, will be better
explained when I come to take a review of the different works
that have been carried on during the last ten years in the
colony, and in. Van Dieman's Land. Before I enter upon that
subject, I think it necessary to make some observations upon the
mode of distributing and employing the female convicts. On
reference to the Appendix, it appears, that out of 1,541 that
have arrived in New South Wales, from the 13th January 1814 to
the 12th of September 1820, 530 have been sent to employment in
the factory at Paramatta, 12 to the different hospitals as
nurses, and 396 to Van Dieman's Land; the remainder, amounting to
603, have either been distributed to families, to individuals,
and to their husbands, or have received tickets of leave for the
purpose of maintaining themselves. That great abuses have arisen,
and do arise, from the first distribution of the female convicts
on their arrival, sufficiently appears from the evidence of the
principal superintendent.</p>
<p>Yielding to the recommendations made to him by the captains
and surgeons of the female convict ships, Governor Macquarie has
given tickets of leave to some of the females on their arrival;
and influenced also by a wish to economize the public
expenditure, he has given the same indulgence to those who were
represented to him as having money, by which they have
established themselves in the town of Sydney, and at once been
placed on a level with the emancipated and free convicts of their
own sex. In this state, which cannot be considered as a state of
punishment, and which tends to produce a belief that opulence can
redeem the consequences of crime, these women form connections
with the convicts whom they have formerly known in England, or
support themselves by any casual demand for their labour. Those
also who have children, and have any means of supporting
themselves, are furnished with tickets of leave. The government
is thus relieved from the expense of their maintenance, and they
are themselves benefitted by being saved from the consequences of
consignment to the factory at Paramatta.</p>
<p>The principal superintendent Hutchinson, in the original
distribution of the female convicts, is sole judge of the
propriety or impropriety of the applications that are made for
them. His orders are to refuse them on the application of single
men, unless their character should be such as to preclude the
suspicion of unworthy and immoral motives. The exercise of this
delicate and important duty is thus committed to a person, who is
himself not exempt from the charge of immoral habits and
connections, and not sufficiently raised above the rank of
ordinary applicants to resist improper applications with
firmness. His knowledge of the inhabitants of Sydney enables him
to form an opinion of the motives that guide their applications
for female convicts; but of the condition of those who reside in
the country, he is entirely ignorant. Refusals to such
applications are, however, but rarely made and no complaints of
that nature were addressed to me. I am likewise bound to state,
that after entertaining much suspicion myself of the manner in
which this part of the duty of the principal superintendent was
performed, and after some inquiry respecting it, I was not able
to obtain any satisfactory proof of corrupt motives in the
distribution that had been made by him of the female convicts. It
is admitted by him, that their cohabitation was the frequent
consequence of the indulgence afforded to them on their arrival;
and that it was not an offence of which he conceived himself
bound to take cognizance. The removal of the female convicts from
Sydney to Paramatta has been already mentioned. On their arrival
there, they are allowed to remain in a wooden building that is
near the factory; and if they have succeeded in bringing their
bedding from the ships, they are permitted to deposit it there,
or in the room in which the female prisoners are confined for
punishment. The first of these apartments is in the upper floor
of a house that was built for the reception of pregnant females.
It contains another apartment, on the ground floor, that is
occupied by the men employed in the factory. It is not surrounded
by any wall or paling; and the upper room or garret has only one
window, and an easy communication with the room below. No
accommodation is afforded for cooking provisions in this
building; nor does there exist either inducement to the female
convicts to remain in it, or the means of preventing their
escape. The greater portion, therefore, betake themselves to the
lodgings in the town of Paramatta, where they cohabit with the
male convicts in the employ of government, or with any persons
who will receive them. Their employment in the factory consists
of picking, spinning and carding wool. They are tasked to perform
a certain quantity in the day, and when their task is finished,
which is generally at one o'clock, they are allowed to return to
their lodgings. Their weekly ration consists of four pounds ten
ounces of flour, and the same quantity of meat, or two pounds of
pork; and the same ration is issued to the females who are
confined for punishment. The children who accompany their mothers
to Paramatta are maintained by government, and receive one half
of the ration last described. As there is a general objection
amongst the settlers, to receive into their families female
convicts who are accompanied by children, it is their lot to
remain longer in Paramatta, and at the factory, than others. The
factory itself to consists of one long room that is immediately
above the gaol, having two windows in front that look into the
gaol yard, one in the end of the building, and two windows
looking into a yard that is immediately behind. The dimensions of
the room are 60 feet by 20; and at one end are store-rooms, where
the wool, yarn and cloth are kept. There is one fire-place, at
which all the provisions are cooked. The women have no other beds
than those they can make from the wool in its dirty state; and
they sleep upon it at night, and in the midst of their spinning
wheels and work. No attempt has been made to preserve cleanliness
in this room, as the boards had shrunk so much, that when they
were washed, the water fell through them into the prison rooms
below. The walls of the room and the roof bore equal marks of
neglect; and the drains in the yard were in the highest degree
offensive.</p>
<p>Colloquial intercourse always took place between the female
convicts and the male convicts confined in the prison, except
during the hours of labour; for in the windows there was nothing
more than three wooden bars, and inside shutters. A range of
wooden buildings had been erected on one side of the yard below,
connected with the gaol and factory by a wall of ten feet. In
this range, and in a small building attached to one of the side
walls, were placed the looms, where the cloth was wove by male
convicts assigned for the purpose. At a little distance from the
factory, and beyond this wall was the superintendent's house and
garden, containing four small and inconvenient rooms. Mr. Oakes,
the superintendent, had for some time ceased to inhabit them
himself, and had converted one of them into the a stable; but he
had continued for his own use the cultivation of a small garden
and a paddock immediately adjoining. The care of the factory,
therefore, except es, during the hours of labour, was committed
to a constable, who was still a convict, who had continued in
that office for 15 years, and received no larger allowance as a
reward for his fidelity than a ration and a half. The security
for the performance of his duty, depends upon the risk of
detection; the same presumptive check that is supposed to provide
for the official integrity of many other establishments in New
South Wales, aided by the further probability of disclosures, to
which the intoxication of the women would lead, if they were
permitted by the constable to go out of the factory, when
confined there. Considered as a place of punishment for offences
committed by female convicts in New South Wales, the factory at,
Paramatta acted merely as a temporary restraint from
indiscriminate intercourse or unchecked dissipation. The labour
of the females, confined for punishment, was not greater than
those that were retained there for employment; and their diet was
in nowise inferior. The only punishment that it inflicted was
that of moral and physical degradation, beyond the low, state of
exigence from which many of them had habit, were associated in
their daily tasks with those who had very lately arrived, to the
same level. The women who had become most profligate and hardened
by previously been taken; and reducing those who had been in
better situations, nearly to whom the customs and practices of
the colony were yet unknown, and who might have escaped the
consequences of such pernicious lessons, if a little care and a
small portion of expense had been spared in providing them with a
separate apartment during the hours of labour. As a place of
employment, the factory at Paramatta was not only very defective,
but very prejudicial. The insufficient accommodation that it
afforded to those females who might be well disposed, presented
an early incitement, if not an excuse, for their resorting to
indiscriminate prostitution and on the evening of their arrival
at Paramatta, those who were not deploring their state of
abandonment and distress were traversing the streets, in search
of the guilty means of future support. The state in which the
place itself was kept, and the state of disgusting filth in which
I found it, both on an early visit after my arrival, and on one
preceding my departure the disordered, unruly and licentious
appearance of the women manifested the little degree of control
in which the female convicts were kept, and the little attention
that was paid to any thing beyond the mere performance of a
certain portion of labour. Mr. Oakes, the superintendent, has
justified himself by the abandoned habits of the women, and the
want of means to make their punishment effectual. It must be
acknowledged, that in such a building as the factory, his task
was a hopeless one: it might have been made more effectual by his
more constant and contiguous residence, but he was charged with
the duties of chief constable in the town of Paramatta, and
carried on the business of a baker. No instance was represented
to me of his improper connivance in the misconduct of the women;
and the magistrates of Paramatta, to one of whom he had given
serious cause of offence, bore testimony to the activity and
perseverance that he displayed in the performance of his duty, as
superintendent of the factory.</p>
<p>The evil consequences arising to the colony from the
indiscriminate association and the unrestrained prostitution of
so many licentious women, have been seriously felt by the
inhabitants at large. With the temptations that their residence
in Paramatta afforded, and the slight degree of punishment that
confinement in the factory inflicted, no female convict, when
assigned to a respectable family, could be taught the value of
such a situation, or could be made to feel the necessity of
obedience. These consequences are strongly and justly described
in a letter addressed by the Reverend Mr. Marsden to Governor
Macquarrie in the year 1815, and that makes part of the evidence
submitted to the Committee of Parliament on the State of Gaols.
The effects stated by Mr. Marsden are partially confirmed by the
answer of Governor Macquarrie, and receive further confirmation
from the evidence of Mr. Oakes, the chief constable of Paramatta;
from that of Mr. Hannibal M&#145;Arthur, Mr. West, Mr. Rouse, and Mr.
Coxe.</p>
<p>Mr. Marsden, as acting magistrate at Paramatta, took a leading
part in the police of that place, and became more fully
acquainted, and more deeply impressed, with the nature and extent
of the mischief that it created. The gaol and factory, moreover,
had originally been constructed under his directions, and he must
at an early period have been convinced of the inadequacy of such
buildings, for the purposes either of penal discipline or of
moral restraint: in both these points of view, the plan was as
objectionable as the execution was defective.</p>
<p>The report of Mr. Greenway, the colonial architect, upon the
state of these buildings, that was made in the month of October
1816, alludes in very general terms to them; but it indicates the
defects inherent in the plan, and the consequences to which they
naturally led. Without making Mr. Marsden responsible or these
defects of the building that he superintended, and which was
originally intended for a place of employment only, it is
somewhat surprising, that from the period of his appointment to
the magistracy, in the year 1811, to the year 1815, he had not
addressed some representation to Governor Macquarrie, of the same
evils that he then deplored, the existence of which, long
antecedently, must have been as much within his observation, and
must have as forcibly attracted it. Deference employed in other
buildings, and want of success that he had experienced in
procuring to the feelings of Governor Macquarie, whose attention
he observed to be then employed in other buildings, and want of
success that he had experienced in procuring some attention to
his representations respecting the hospital at Paramatta, might
have been the motives for this silence: whatever they really
were, the facts that are stated by Mr. Marsden, in his letter to
Governor Macquarrie, could not have altogether escaped his
knowledge and observation. The complaints in the colony
respecting the misconduct of the female convicts, of their
disobedience, and of their immoral connections, must have been
known to him, and they must have pointed at the want of
accommodation in the colony, and punishment of the female
convicts, as the natural sources of these evils.</p>
<p>Having observed, in Governor Macquarrie's answer to Mr.
Marsden, that he justified the delay that occurred, and was still
to take place, in the construction of a proper place of reception
for the female convicts, by the want of any specific instructions
from your Lordship to undertake such a building, and which he
states that he solicited at an early period of his government,
and considered indispensible, I felt it to be my duty to call to
the recollection of Governor Macquarrie, that he had undertaken
several buildings of much less urgent necessity than the factory
at Paramatta, without waiting for any such indispensible
authority; and I now find, that the construction of it was
announced by him to your Lordship in the year 1817, as then in
his contemplation, without making any specific allusion to the
evils which the want of it had so long occasioned; that the
contract for building it was announced to the public on the 21st
March ISIS, and that your Lordship's approval of it was not
signified until the 24th August 1818, and could not have reached
Governor Macquarrie's hands until nearly a year after the work
had been undertaken. It appears, therefore, that if want of
authority had been the sole cause of the delay in building the
factory at Paramatta, that cause would not only have operated in
the month of March 1818, but it would have continued to operate
until the want of authority had been formally supplied. Governor
Macquarrie, however, must be conscious, that after he had stated
to Mr. Marsden in the year 1815, and with an appearance of
regret, that the want of authority prevented him from undertaking
the construction of a building of such undeniable necessity and
importance as the factory at Paramatta, he had undertaken several
buildings, which, though useful in themselves, were of less
comparative importance; and had commenced, in the month of August
1817, the laborious and expensive construction of his own stables
at Sydney, to which I have already alluded, without any previous
communication to your Lordship, and in direct opposition to an
instruction that must have then reached him, and that forcibly
warned him of the consequences. I cannot help regarding,
therefore, the want of authority alleged by Governor Macquarrie
as a feeble and unsafe justification of himself, for the delay
that has taken place in undertaking the construction of a house
of reception for the female convicts at Paramatta; and I think
that this ground of justification is still further weakened, by a
consideration of the means that he possessed of providing good
accommodation at a very moderate rate of expense. To accomplish
this purpose I cannot admit that an expensive building, or any
architectural ornament, was either necessary or desirable: the
principal object in view was, that of preventing improper
intercourse between the female convicts and the male inhabitants
of the town and vicinity, and providing accommodation for them,
in the hours of labour, until proper situations could be procured
for them in the families of the settlers and inhabitants. The
continuation of a wall, 12 feet in height, from the end of that
which surrounds the gaol at Paramatta, and the complete enclosure
of an acre and a half of ground, containing separate houses of
wood, and one for a work-room, would, I conceive, have answered
these purposes entirely, and more effectually, than the building
that has lately been erected, and that was in progress on my
arrival.</p>
<p>The female convicts, who had any disposition to conduct
themselves well, might have been provided with the means of
separation from those who manifested a contrary disposition;
their food might have been prepared without the temptation of
exchanging a portion of it for spirits; and they would have
become habituated to the same sort of accommodation and
tenements, that it was, and still is, their lot to inhabit, when
assigned to the service of settlers in the colony.</p>
<p>The effects of the licentiousness of the women at Paramatta
are more visible in their appearance than in their health, or in
that of their children. I was much struck with this circumstance,
at the first muster that I attended at Paramatta in the year
1819, when most of them were accompanied by fine and healthy
children, some of whom had been born after their mothers had
attained the age of 45. The appearance of those, who were
destined to inhabit the new factory in 1821, denoted a state of
greater profligacy and abandonment; and was attributed by Mr.
Oakes to their rooted apprehension of being deprived of their
former means of indulgence.</p>
<p>The present building, that is now appropriated to their use,
was intended for the lodging and employment of not less than 300.
It is placed upon the extremity of a large, uninclosed tract of
sterile ground, that is separated by the Paramatta River from the
town, and from the pleasure-ground lately attached to the
residence of the governor. The quantity of water in the river
varies greatly in the different seasons of the year, sometimes
leaving its bed nearly dry, and generally fordable; and at
others, raising, it to within 15 feet from the highest part of
the left bank, close to the edge of which the outside wall of the
new factory stands.</p>
<p>In the first design that was made of this building, and
submitted to the contractors, it was not intended to surround it
with any external wall; but as it was soon discovered that the
rustic work, in which the quoins of the basement story were cut,
afforded great facilities of access to the windows of the floor
in which it was intended that the women should sleep, it was
deemed expedient to surround the whole building with a wall of
nine feet six inches high. It was also observed, that a breach
had been made by the river, that threatened the foundation of the
wall and one of the work-rooms, and it was then considered
prudent to construct a deep buttress, that now lines the bank of
the river, and protects the foundation from further
encroachment.</p>
<p>The amount of the original contract for the principal building
was 4,800<i>l</i>. and the important additions, that have just
been mentioned, will create a further charge, amounting nearly to
1,200<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>The situation of this building was chosen on account of its
contiguity to the river, and the projected employment of the
females in spinning flax and bleaching linen. These objects were
certainly desirable; yet I could not perceive, nor was I informed
of any reason that might have prevented a partial retirement of
the building from the bank of the river, by which both the
expense of the embankment wall would have been avoided, and the
factory itself would have le intruded upon the privacy of the
government grounds that are immediately opposite, and not more
than 30 yards distant. The situation of the factory is dry,
healthy and cheerful; and is at some distance, though not an
inconvenient one, from the town of Paramatta. The principal
building consists of a basement story, containing two rooms, in
which the female convicts are to take their meals; and two upper
stories, in each of which are two large sleeping rooms and two
smaller ones. Each of the larger sleeping rooms will contain 20
double beds; and two of the small rooms will contain six single
beds; thus providing for the accommodation of 172 females. These
rooms are separated by a staircase and landing-places; and in the
centre of the roof, immediately above, a cupola has been
introduced for the purposes of ornament and ventilation. The
principal building divides the outer from the inner yard. In the
former is the principal entrance and porter's lodge; and on each
side are four rooms, with separate entrances to each, for the
accommodation of the superintendent and his family, and a deputy
superintendent.</p>
<p>One of these rooms was also designated as a library, but
without apparent or probable application of it to such an
use.</p>
<p>On one side of the same outer court, and fronting inwards, is
the hospital, consisting of two small apartments and a medicine
and store-room; and on the opposite side is the room for weaving
cloth, which was to be occupied during the day by male convicts.
The entrance to the inner court leads through the centre of the
basement story of the principal building; and on each side of it
are four small and very ill-contrived lodges for the constables
or overseers. In the three sides of the inner court, and fronting
inwards, are the kitchen and bakehouse, and store-room for
provisions, with rooms above for storing wool, a long spinning
room, and carding room, with a store-room for wool and cloth. The
privies that had been constructed under the floor of one of these
offices, with drains leading to the river, were removed, on
account of their defective and inconvenient construction, to a
more distant part of the building; and when the female convicts
were established in it, in February 1821, it was in contemplation
to add washhouses and laundries, that had been either omitted or
forgotten in the original plan, and which never could have been
supplied if the external wall had not been added.</p>
<p>Mr. Marsden had been requested by Governor Macquarrie to
furnish a Plan for a factory, before the contract for the present
building was announced to the public. That which he submitted was
upon a larger scale than the design of Mr. Greenway, and less
ornamental; but both of the plans seem to have contemplated the
employment, rather than the punishment of female convicts; and in
neither was there any provision made for the separation of those
who were sentenced to punishment by the magistrates, from those
who had not been assigned to settlers on their arrival, a
distinction which of all others was the most important.</p>
<p>Governor Macquarrie was so anxious that I should witness the
removal of the female convicts from the old to the new factory
before my departure from the colony, and it was a measure that
was in itself so desirable, that although the new building was
not quite completed, the chief engineer received orders to make
all possible dispatch, in making the furniture and cooking
utensils and on the 1st February 1821, the removal of the female
convicts took place, and 112 (of whom 40 were confined for
punishment) were lodged in the new building. The apprehension of
confinement and greater discipline, that the sight of it had
created amongst them, had not been without its effects; and
during three months, anterior to the day of their removal,
several marriages had taken place at Paramatta church, the
motives for which were clearly attributable to the fear of
greater restraint than any that the female convicts had
previously endured, and not from any respect for the new
obligation they had incurred; for several of them separated from
their husbands in a few days after their marriage.</p>
<p>Governor Macquarrie expressed a wish that I should draw up
some regulations for the management of the factory before my
departure: but my attention was then so entirely engaged with
other matters, that I could not devote any portion of it to that
subject; and the regulations in the Appendix were framed, and
read to the female convicts, on the day of their removal.</p>
<p>I could not help regretting with the governor, that the care
and superintendence of the factory was no longer to remain in the
hands of Mr. Oakes, who, in many respects, was better qualified
for the duty than any other person in the colony. He had made
himself so obnoxious to the resident magistrate at Paramatta, Mr.
Hannibal M&#145;Arthur, and had been guilty of such wilful disrespect
to him, that Governor Macquarrie had determined to dismiss him.
His place was to be supplied by a young man, a native of the
colony, who had acted as deputy superintendent of the factory,
under Mr. Oakes. This person was married, but possessed neither
experience nor energy for conducting such an establishment.</p>
<p>Upon my arrival in the colony in September 1819, my first
visit to the old factory at Paramatta impressed me with the
strongest wish to effect an amelioration in the condition of the
female convicts consigned to it.</p>
<p>The contract for the new one had been then entered into, and
the building was commenced. I was informed that from the low
terms at which the contract was taken, some great departure from
its conditions was to be apprehended, or some great delay in its
completion. A very considerable difference had been observed in
the offers of other contractors, and of those who had undertaken
it, amounting to no less than 5,000<i>l</i>. but as Mr. Greenway,
the architect, felt confident that the contractors would be able
to perform their part of the undertaking, and as no stipulation
had been made for performing it within any given period, I
recommended to Governor Macquarrie to dispense with any or all
parts that were of an ornamental kind; and to afford, from time
to time, to the contractors, such assistance in government labour
as they might require, with a view to expedite the building, but
not to relieve them from the pressure of their contract. That
assistance was ultimately allowed them; and a geometrical
staircase, that had been projected by Mr. Greenway for the centre
part of the building, was dispensed with, and a plain one of wood
was substituted for it. For the purpose of affording some degree
of internal control, six solitary cells were provided in the
outer court; and in the space, formed by the inclosure of the
whole building, more extensive and better means of separation and
punishment may hereafter be added, than the original plan of the
principal building was capable of affording. Excepting the rustic
work of the basement story, I did not observe any attempts at
unnecessary decoration; and although some parts of the connecting
walls were curtailed from the original dimensions, the work
appeared to me to coincide in all important points with the
specification. The roofing and the flooring timber, from not
having been sufficiently seasoned, had shrunk from its original
dimensions; and the mortar contained a larger portion of loam
than was permitted in the specification. With these exceptions,
the building was not badly executed; and with good regulation and
superintendence, is capable of affording accommodation to the
female convicts, but will require some alteration before it can
be considered secure from intrusion.</p>
<p>The want of a place of confinement, for the female convicts in
Van Dieman's Land, for punishment, had, for some time, been a
subject of regret to Lieutenant. Governor Sorrell, who, at the
end of the year 1820, at length obtained permission from Governor
Macquarrie to construct a place separate from the gaol, in which
they could be more strictly confined and more effectually
punished.</p>
<p>The demand for female servants had generally been so great as
to afford employment, in the first instance, to those who were
sent from Sydney, or that in later instances were landed in Van
Dieman's Land from England.</p>
<p>The same principle, that had guided the consignment of the
worst description of male convicts to Van Dieman's Land from
Sydney, caused also the successive transmission thither of the
worst description of females; and from this cause, as well as the
want of a proper place of punishment, the female convicts in Van
Dieman's Land were not in a state of very effectual control.</p>
<p>Governor Macquarrie's objection to the construction of a place
of employment and punishment, of the female convicts in Van
Dieman's Land, seems to have proceeded from a belief that the
employment of them in the service of settlers would supersede the
necessity of providing any at the expense of government; and he
directed Lieutenant-governor Sorrell to send any of them, for
whom more strict punishment was required, to the establishment at
Paramatta. The expense and evil consequences of this arrangement
were very soon perceivable, in the necessity that occurred of
returning to Paramatta six female convicts that had arrived by
the Janus, and that had been sent in a government vessel to Port
Dalrymple and Hobart Town, in the short space of three weeks
after their arrival there.</p>
<p>The manner in which they were sent in the government vessels,
and the unrestrained prostitution that took place on board that
which conveyed 30 female convicts from Port Jackson to that place
and Hobart Town, in the year 1820, make it very desirable that
all removals of a similar nature should be avoided; and it is
greatly to be wished that the necessity of recurring to them may,
in future, be prevented, by the speedy accomplishment of the
object that Lieutenant-governor Sorrell had in view.</p>

<h3>VI.<br>
<i>Nature of the Labour of Convicts in the Service of
Settlers.</i></h3>
<p><small>THE</small> nature of the labour performed by convicts,
assigned to the settlers in New South Wales, has undergone some
alteration since the earlier years of its establishment.</p>
<p><a name="ch-23" id="ch-23"></a><b>Sydney Gazette, 15 January
1804.]</b></p>
<p>In the month of January 1804, an order was issued by Governor
King, requiring all persons who applied for convicts to sign an
indenture, by which they covenanted to clothe and maintain them
according to same rate of allowance that was afforded by
government to the convicts in its employ, for the space of 12
calendar months, under penalty of paying 1<i>s</i>. for every day
of the term that was unexpired, unless they could give a
satisfactory reason for their discharge. In return for this
allowance, the convicts were compelled to perform a certain
portion of labour for their masters, that had been regulated and
set forth in an order issued by Governor Hunter in the years 1798
and 1799; and it was repeated in the subsequent order of Governor
King. The work required from a convict was, to labour for ten
hours, throughout the year, for five days in the week and six
hours on Saturdays. As it was found that they were frequently
enabled to perform their allotted task in a less time, they were
allowed to apply such portion as they could save from their
government hours, to their own benefit, reservation being made to
the master of a preferential right to the services of his convict
servant, if he could afford or thought fit to employ and pay for
them. The rate of payment for this extra labour, as well as for
the labour of freemen, was fixed by Governor King at the same
time, and continued at the same rate until the month of December
1816.</p>
<p>Sydney Gazette, 15 January 1804.]</p>
<p><a name="ch-24" id="ch-24"></a><b>Sydney Almanack, 1814; Tithe
Labour.]</b></p>
<p>The quantity of labour that a settler was entitled to exact
from the convict servant, in the regulated hours, is set forth in
a schedule annexed to the order of Governor King, and is acted
upon at the present moment; subject to such modifications as the
magistrates may think fit to make, in consequence of stress of
weather, state of the land, or the strength of the convict
labourer.</p>
<p>It is stated by Mr. Oxley, that in the earliest periods the
labour of the whole day was exacted from the convicts; and this
rule was not relaxed until a scarcity of provisions having
occurred, their labour ceased at three o'clock on each day, to
enable them to work at gardens in the town of Sydney. Since that
period, this dispensation grew into a general custom; and wages
were assigned to the convicts for such labour as they might
perform for their master after three o'clock on each day. The
mischievous consequences that were found to arise, from the
inability of the poorer classes of settlers to pay for the extra
labour of their convicts, or even to pay the wages of their
regulated labour, appear to have been severely felt in the
colony, in the year 1814, by the unauthorized dispersion of the
convicts in search of employment in distant districts, and in the
means of secreting stolen property that was afforded to them, by
the permission of their masters, to feed pigs and poultry on
their farms in lieu of wages.</p>
<p>For the prevention of these evils, the settlers who did not
require the entire services of the men assigned to them, or who
could not afford to pay for them, were I required to return them
forthwith to the principal superintendent of Sydney, or to the
magistrates of the different districts. The amount of the wages
that a settler was compellable, under this order, to pay to his
convict labourer, varied with the fluctuating value of the paper
money, in which all payments were made, until the month of
December 1816. At that period, the amount of the annual wages,
pay able to every male convict employed by a settler, was fixed
at 10<i>l</i>. sterling; and if the regular allowance of clothing
was found by the master, he was entitled to deduct and from this
amount the sum of 3<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>To every female convict, the annual amount of wages was fixed
at 7<i>l</i>. and the deduction for clothing was fixed at
1<i>l</i>. 10<i>s</i>. This adjustment of prices was referred by
Governor Macquarrie to the magistrates of the colony, and agreed
upon by them at the same period; in which was ordered, that all
payments in colonial currency should cease, and thenceforth be
calculated in sterling.</p>
<p>Such are the conditions upon which the convicts in New South
Wales are at present assigned to settlers; and although they have
ceased for some time to be secured by any written stipulation,
yet they are considered to be established by custom, and to form
a guide for the decisions of the magistrates in all disputes that
occur between the settlers and their convict servants.</p>
<p>It was never permitted, at any period in the colony, to a
master to inflict corporal punishment upon his convict labourer;
reference to a magistrate was always and is now enjoined for the
purpose of substantiating the mutual complaints that arise
between them. These complaints are found, in most cases, to
proceed from the reluctance or inability of the convict to
perform his task; from his attempts to plunder his master's
property, or that of the convicts about him; or from the manner
in which his wages are paid by his master. A very large
proportion of the convicts assigned to the settlers, having, in
the later periods of the colony, consisted of the lowest classes
of labourers from the manufacturing districts of Great Britain,
or from the populous towns, much difficulty has been experienced
in training them to agricultural labour on their arrival, and
this difficulty has increased as the system of agriculture in the
colony has improved. Hence have arisen the perpetual changes of
the convict labourers from the service of one settler to another,
and the expense to the crown in maintaining those that are
returned as useless and unprofitable.</p>
<p>This evil has been necessarily accompanied by a violation of
Governor King's order, that every settler should retain a convict
assigned to him for the space of one twelvemonth; and the
inconvenience was afterwards so strongly felt, that Governor
Macquarrie, on the 30th September 1815, directed that no settler
or other person should send back to the government gangs any
servants assigned to them, unless for the commission of some
fault or crime, or unless they should be found unfit for manual
labour from sickness or other infirmity. It is stated by Mr.
Rouse, the if superintendent of convicts at Paramatta, that this
order was violated in one month after its promulgation, and that
it was found impracticable to adhere to it.</p>
<p>The great inconvenience and interruption that complaints
against these servants occasion to the settlers, and the risk to
which they are exposed in leaving their property to seek redress
from the magistrates, is severely felt by all the inhabitants of
the colony; some of them, especially those who had themselves
been convicts, feel a degree of commendable reluctance in making
a complaint against a convict labourer for mere incapacity, and
would rather submit to the unrequited expense of his maintenance
than be the cause of the infliction of unmerited punishment. This
feeling is in some degree attributable to a sympathy with that
condition which was once their own, and is not corrected until
they acquire property, and a disposition to improve and augment
it. Others, influenced by less humane considerations, or by a
dislike of the trouble of complaining, allow the convict to seek
employment where he can find it, or leave him in the towns, where
he is apprehended. He is in these cases sent to gaol, where he
receives an allowance of one pound of bread per day, until he is
taken by another settler; and if he should be sent to Sydney or
Paramatta, he is placed in one of the government gangs. By this
means his or capacity for agricultural labour is not removed, and
his dispositions and habits of indolence are in most cases
confirmed.</p>
<p>The effect of the labour required from the convicts, assigned
to the settlers, varies with their character and condition. In
the service of the more opulent, who can afford to pay for a
greater quantity of labour than is required by the government
orders, the convict will generally perform, and will earn more
than his annual wages after an experience of one year. He is thus
confined during the day to his master's farm, and prevented from
rambling in pursuit of plunder; and the fatigue of the day's
labour disposes him to tranquillity and to rest at night. He
finds that, by increased exertion, he possesses the means of
improving both his present and future condition; and he every day
becomes more skilful in that species of labour, by which he may
hereafter seek to establish himself in the possession of
property, and make it available for his support.</p>
<p>The employment of convicts in the service of the lower classes
of settlers, who cannot afford to pay them any thing beyond their
rations, or to stimulate or reward their industry by paying for
their extra labour, is, on the contrary, very pernicious. The
convict is thus allowed to leave his home in pursuit of labour
that he cannot find there, and he is out of the reach even of the
imperfect control of his necessitous master. Governor Macquarrie
has endeavoured to restrain this practice by several orders; and
in some of the districts, chiefly occupied by the lower class of
settlers, the magistrates have lately found it necessary to
enforce their execution, both by exacting the fine imposed by
those orders, and by removing the convict labourers from the
control of those settlers who could not furnish them with
employment. It may also be generally observed, that whenever the
demand for the produce of agricultural labour in New South Wales
is diminished, either to the richer or the poorer classes of
settlers, the effect will be the same; neither of them will then
continue to employ or maintain convicts, much less to stimulate
their industry in the production of a commodity that is
unsaleable: whereas, under the operation and encouragement of a
steady market, the settler can both afford to give his convict
servants such a liberal allowance of food as will make them
satisfied with their condition and willing to remain in it, and
can give that stimulus to their exertions that supersedes the
necessity of coercion, and leaves the convict neither time nor
strength to undertake enterprizes of a criminal nature.</p>
<p>It is the want of this stimulus to the labour of the convict,
or the fear of producing greater mischief by applying it, that
was noticed as the great defect in the system of government
labour in the towns; and it is precisely in these points that the
labour of convicts assigned to respectable and opulent settlers
in the country, has appeared to me to be so much to be preferred,
and so well calculated to answer the colonial as well as the
penal objects of the establishment of New South Wales. It has
unfortunately happened, that the attention of the colonial
government has hitherto been fixed upon the production of two
objects, for which its own consumption formed at once both the
demand and the limit; and the perpetual variations that have
occurred in that demand, together with certain other difficulties
in supplying it, have rather had the effect of deterring than of
stimulating the efforts of respectable settlers in the
cultivation of grain, and the largest supplies have been
furnished by the lower classes.</p>
<p>The payment of wages for the regulated labour of the convicts,
or for their earnings by extra labour, is generally made to them
in articles of consumption, such as tea, sugar, and tobacco; and
on the larger estates an account is kept by the owner or his
overseer of the quantities of work performed, and of articles
issued in payment.</p>
<p><a name="ch-25" id="ch-25"></a><b>Sydney Gazette, 7 December
1816.]</b></p>
<p>By the last order of Governor Macquarrie, and by the decisions
of the magistrates, the convicts are considered to be entitled to
demand their wages in money; but the difficulty that they find in
purchasing the different articles that they require, and the evil
consequences of the unrestrained purchase of spirits, have given
rise to the custom of paying the largest proportion of wages in
New South Wales in articles of consumption, such as tea, sugar,
and tobacco, and which are better known under the general
designation of "property". The prices of these articles vary from
40 to 70 per cent. above the wholesale ready money prices, and
from 25 to 35 per cent. above the retail prices of Sydney; these
variations depending upon local circumstances, and being liable,
when disputed, to the final adjustment of the magistrates.</p>
<p>It sometimes happens that a compensation is made to the
convict for the high price of the goods, by an increased price
for his labour; but I did not find that this understanding was so
generally recognized as Mr. Oxley has stated in his evidence.</p>
<p>It thus appears that the rate of wages, both of free and
convict labour in New South Wales and Van Dieman's Land, is
nominal, and depends in great measure upon the fluctuating prices
of the articles that are given in payment. This circumstance
alone, independent of those arising from the condition of the
employer, gives rise to frequent disputes between him and his
servant; they are determinable by the magistrates, who being
settlers, must naturally feel an interest in support of charges
that have the effect of diminishing the price of labour to
themselves as well as others. In my inquiries upon this subject,
I found that the magistrates were always inclined to favour
payments in property, rather than in money, to convicts; but I
did not become acquainted with any instance in which their
authority had been used to force the submission of a convict to
an oppressive charge. In the Appendix are two accounts of
articles delivered to convicts in payment of their labour, at a
period when the prices of colonial currency prevailed; and I
subsequently found that they resembled the generality of payments
made at the same period. It will be observed, that in these
accounts, there are two or more charges for spirits, which,
although strictly prohibited, are frequently given by the more
opulent and respectable settlers, in remuneration or
encouragement for extraordinary exertion.</p>
<p>The regulated allowance of food to a convict in the employ of
a settler in New law South Wales and Van Dieman's Land, consists
of seven pounds of fresh or salt meat, or four pounds of pork,
and eight pounds of wheat; but it has already been observed that
the last article is generally increased to fourteen pounds. Tea
and sugar form a constant accompaniment to the meals of convicts,
as well as of the lower classes of settlers, who, in general,
admit them to their tables; but milk and vegetables are supplied
only by the higher classes. The allowance of wheat is ground into
flour by the convicts themselves, by means of steel hand mills,
and is made into heavy cakes, baked in the embers of their own
fires, and frequently afterwards fried in the fat of pork.</p>
<p>A considerable admixture of maize takes place in the ration of
wheat, amongst the lower classes of settlers, and the convicts in
the service of the more opulent settlers, when wheat becomes
scarce; and it is greatly to be desired that this admixture
should be authorized by the continued practice, as well as the
directions of the colonial government, and that it should
henceforth be considered as a constituent part of every ration
that is issued to a convict in New South Wales, and in the
proportion of one half to the ration of wheaten flour. The
cultivation of maize is less affected by the vicissitudes of the
climate of New South Wales than that of other grain; the produce
is more easily secured from destruction by insects, and it
affords the best food for horses, poultry and pigs. For the
purposes of distillation, it is equally useful, and with sugar
has been universally substituted for barley in the breweries of
New South Wales.</p>
<p>The convicts upon the large estates are generally lodged in
separate huts built of wood, and covered with the bark of the
eucalyptus. The numbers in each but are not limited; and in their
associations they are guided altogether by their own,
pre-possessions. The convict servants of the lower classes of
settlers inhabit the same houses, and frequently the same
apartments as their masters.</p>
<p>The general appearance of the convicts in the service of the
settlers, and the interior of their huts, showed that they
possess neither habits of cleanliness nor order.</p>
<p>The article of soap is not one of those that a settler is
compelled to furnish; and it is not often purchased by the
convict out of his wages.</p>
<p>The scarcity of water on many of the estates in New South
Wales, and the distance from which it is frequently to be
procured, contribute, in some measure, to the want of cleanliness
in the convicts.</p>
<p><a name="ch-26" id="ch-26"></a><b>Sydney Gazette, 10 Sept.
1814.]</b></p>
<p>Influenced by a very laudable desire to introduce amongst
those assigned to settlers some degree of attention to the
observance of religious duties, and to connect with it some
attention to the regularity and cleanliness of their personal
appearance, Governor Macquarrie issued a proclamation in the year
1814, wherein it was ordered that the convicts in each district,
as well as the men who held tickets of leave, should be mustered
on every Sunday morning at ten o'clock, in some central place in
the district, to be appointed by the magistrate, and that the
constables of the district should muster them, and report to the
magistrates, on the following day, the absence of any convict
without a just excuse, his disorderly conduct, or his uncleanly
appearance.</p>
<p>The governor also expressed an expectation that the
magistrates would, on some occasions, personally attend to these
duties themselves.</p>
<p>In those districts where the place of muster was, or could be
held within three miles of any church, the convicts were ordered
to attend divine service there, and if it happened to be at a
greater distance, they were to be dismissed to their own homes,
after answering to their names, and to such inquiry as the
constables might choose to make.</p>
<p>This proclamation included several other regulations for the
police of the country districts, and for the more general
information of the inhabitants, it was ordered to be read in the
churches by the different chaplains. To the good intention with
which this proclamation was framed, I found no person who was not
ready to bear testimony; but of its effect upon the conduct of
the convicts, some doubt and difference of opinion has long, and
still does prevail.</p>
<p>At an earlier period the Rev. Mr. Marsden and Mr. Hannibal
M&#145;Arthur, then acting magistrates for the town and districts of
Paramatta, had been so strongly impressed with the mischievous
consequences of collecting together in one place so many
convicts, and placing them under no better control than the
constables of the districts, that they ceased to give effect to
the governor's proclamation, in the over which they presided as
magistrates.</p>
<p>These effects had been represented, and made the subject of
complaint to your Lordship by Mr. Bayley, a settler in New South
Wales, who enjoyed the confidence and friendship of the Rev. Mr.
Marsden. Your Lordship having been pleased to refer the matters
stated in this complaint to Governor Macquarrie, a circular
letter was addressed by his secretary to the magistrates,
requesting their information and report upon the effects of the
Sunday musters; a considerable majority of the magistrates
reported that these musters had produced a favourable effect upon
the convicts; but Mr. Marsden was of opinion, that this effect
was confined to places where the convicts had an opportunity of
attending divine service, and that their meetings on Sundays, in
the presence and at the houses of the district constables, only
led to protracted absence from the houses of their masters, and
to debauchery and licentiousness elsewhere. Mr. Hannibal M&#145;Arthur
considered that although these mischievous consequences were leis
sensibly felt in places where the convicts could attend divine
worship, yet that their association and meeting with dissolute
characters at the muster had led them to form improper
connections there, and that the Sunday muster had not been
productive of any visible benefit.</p>
<p>The opinion of the chief constable of the Windsor district is
equally unfavourable to it as a measure of police, grounded upon
the opportunities that it affords to the convicts for combining
together and forming plans of criminal enter prize; it is obvious
moreover, that whenever the muster is carelessly executed by the
district constable, or where he fails to make his report of the
absentees, or ill conducted convicts, to the magistrates on the
following day, it is much more likely to be attended with
mischief than with advantage; and that whatever may be the
vigilance of the constable, it affords a pretext to the convict
for absence from his master's estate, that may, and often has
been used to the prejudice of both.</p>
<p>The good effects that this weekly muster has produced, have
been found to consist in the more cleanly appearance of the
convicts, and in the opportunities that it affords to them of
making known any deficiency of their allowance of clothing, or
any other complaint that they may have to make, for it is through
the district constables that these complaints are directed to be
made; and it also affords to the same officer an opportunity of
becoming better acquainted with the persons as well as the
conduct of the convicts in his district, and of better
determining the references that are frequently made to him by the
magistrates, upon local and disputed points of wages and
labour.</p>
<p>From the information that I received upon this subject, I am
of opinion that the Sunday musters of the convicts, if strictly
attended to by the magistrates of New South Wales, may be
productive of great advantage, but that the character of the is
district constables in the colony is not such as to justify a
belief that the regulations intrusted to them can be either
faithfully or accurately performed.</p>
<p>The repeated proofs that Mr. Marsden and Mr. Hannibal M&#145;Arthur
had received of the mischievous consequences of holding the
Sunday musters in the town and districts over which they
presided, had induced them to relax their attention to it; and it
is not to be supposed that any good consequences would ever arise
from collecting so many convict servants in the town of Paramatta
on Sundays, even with the advantage that they there possessed of
attending divine service.</p>
<p>The temptations to dissipation and indulgence, that this town
is well known to afford to them, formed at once a decisive
objection to holding any assemblage of them here at any time, and
under any circumstances. Strong as these objections might have
appeared to a full and literal compliance with the proclamation
of Governor Macquarrie by Mr. Marsden and Mr. M&#145;Arthur, there
existed no reason that it prevented those gentlemen from
communicating to him the observations that their Id experience
had suggested respecting it; and certainly none that warranted
them, without such communication, to exercise their own
discretion in relaxing the operation of a public order which they
had been enjoined to enforce, and which the governor had
considered to be useful.</p>
<p>A censure upon these magistrates for their neglect in
enforcing the proclamation was publicly given by Governor
Macquarrie, in an order that appeared in the Sydney Gazette on
the 7th February 1818, and some further regulations were made for
giving greater facility to the musters in the different
districts. I found that this regulation was, in many of them, in
very incomplete execution; and that this circumstance was more to
be attributed to the general state of inefficiency of the police
in New South Wales than to the unfavourable effects of the
measure.</p>
<p><a name="ch-27" id="ch-27"></a><b>Sydney Gazette, 18 August
1822.]</b></p>
<p>At Paramatta, and in the districts of the Hawkesbury, the
Sunday musters have been much neglected; but in the districts of
Evan, Cooke and Bringelly, and at Liverpool, they were observed
with some regularity, and, as the magistrates informed me, with
considerable advantage. The convicts assigned to settlers are not
allowed to travel from one district to another without a pass,
signed by a magistrate, and their names, as well as those of the
settlers to whom they are assigned, are directed to be registered
in a book kept by the chief constable of each district; and the
changes that occur in their destination ought likewise to be
noted there. A pass, signed by the master of a convict, is
requisite to enable him to travel to any part of his own district
on his master's business; but it is not now required, when he is
sent to Sydney market, nor in any case is the pass directed to be
shown to the chief constable of Sydney, or the principal
superintendent there, but is addressed to all whom it may
concern.</p>
<p>These regulations are as necessary at the present period as
they were at that of their first promulgation in the colony; but
they do not seem to be in as active operation as they were then,
or as they are now in Van Dieman's Land; nor is the detailed
exactness that they require either so well understood or
performed as it is in that settlement.</p>
<p>The principal causes of this defect appears to me to have
proceeded from the want of a general superintendence of the
police of New South Wales by one person, to whom the magistrates
of the different districts should address their returns of the
distribution and changes of the convicts, and to whom all passes
given to convicts should be directed and shown. It is also to be
attributed to the great increase of the convict population,
beyond the demands of settlers who were in a condition to
maintain, employ, and control them. Much also is justly
attributed to the relaxed state of labour and discipline that
prevails amongst the convicts in the employ of government, and
the general preference that is given to it by them over the
service of the settlers.</p>
<p><a name="ch-28" id="ch-28"></a><b>Authority and jurisdiction
of the Magistrates, and appointment of those that had been
Convicts.]</b></p>
<p>The jurisdiction of most of the magistrates in New South
Wales, until the 3d February 1821, was limited by the terms of
their commissions to particular districts; and partly by
appointment, and partly by tacit acknowledgment and seniority,
four of them had acquired a kind of special control, independent
of, but not inconsistent with the terms of their commissions.</p>
<p>That of Mr. Wentworth's was an exception, for he was specially
charged with the police of Sydney; but the Rev. Mr. Marsden
exercised a similar jurisdiction at Paramatta, which, on his
retirement from the magistracy, devolved upon Mr. Hannibal
M&#145;Arthur; Mr. Cox was considered the principal magistrate in the
Hawkesbury districts and at Windsor; and Mr. Moore at Liverpool.
The duties of these magistrates have latterly so much increased,
that their attendance at Paramatta, Windsor and Liverpool, which
was in the year 1818 only twice in the week, is now required on
three or four days, and that of the police magistrate of Sydney
is on every day, and sometimes protracted to a late hour. The
bench of magistrates at Sydney consisted of Mr. Minchin, the
superintendent of police, who succeeded Mr. a Wentworth in the
month of March 1820, Captain Piper, Mr. Brookes, and Mr. J. Lord;
Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde sometimes gave his attendance at Sydney,
and upon these occasions acted as chairman; and Mr. T. F.
Campbell, the governor's secretary has upon very few occasions
assisted. Lieutenant-governor Erskine also received a commission
as magistrate of the territory, upon his arrival in the colony
with the 48th regiment, but has never acted either at Sydney,
where he resided, nor at any other place.</p>
<p>Mr. J. Goulburn, the colonial secretary, Mr. Riley, and Mr.
M'Vitie, were added to the number of the magistrates at Sydney
previous to my departure.</p>
<p>Mr. Hannibal M&#145;Arthur, Mr. Harris, and Mr. D. Wentworth, after
his resignation of the superintendence of the police of Sydney,
composed the bench at Paramatta, and Mr. Justice Field gave them
his assistance on Saturdays. Mr. Cox, Mr. Mileham, Captain
Brabyn, and Lieutenant Bell, formed that at Windsor; and Sir John
Jamieson, and the Rev. Mr. Fulton, acted as magistrates for the
district of Evan, including that of Castlereagh. Mr. Moore,
twisted occasionally by Mr. Brookes and Mr. Broughton, and at one
period by Mr. Redfern, at Liverpool; and Mr. Lowe and Mr. Howe,
in the districts of Bringelly and Cooke, on the river Nepean.
Lieutenant Lawson, as commandant of the Bathurst station,
exercised a magisterial jurisdiction over the district that lies
between that settlement and the Nepean river, which has latterly
been extended, together with that of the other magistrates of the
colony, to the whole settled districts of New South Wales.</p>
<p>Considering the great annual increase that took place in the
convict population of New South Wales, from the year 1815 to the
year 1819, it is to be regretted that Governor Macquarrie did not
think fit to make any more considerable addition to the numbers
of the local magistracy, than those of Mr. Brookes and Mr. Lowe,
until the commencement of the latter year; and that the exercise
of his authority in selecting the magistrates upon some
occasions, as well as dismissing one of them on another, has both
diminished the respectability of the magisterial office in the
colony, and has deprived it of the assistance of a very valuable
and efficient member. The appointments to which I now allude, are
those of Andrew Thompson and Simon Lord; the first of these
having taken place on the 12th January 1810, and the second on or
about the 3d August of that year.</p>
<p>Both of these persons had been convicts, but had arrived in
the colony when they were young.</p>
<p>From the account of the executor of A. Thomson, it appears
that he was a native of Scotland, and that his relations there
were itinerant traders in goods. He was transported to New South
Wales at the age of 16, and on his first arrival in the colony,
served as a labourer in the stone-masons gang at Paramatta. On
the expiration of his sentence, he went to Windsor to reside as a
settler, and he there engaged in business as a retail shop
keeper, and built some small vessels, in which he traded to
Sydney. He also became superintendent of some of the convict
labourers in the employ of government at Windsor. In all these
occupations he was successful; his trade extended; he became
possessed of farms; and made an establishment for the manufacture
of salt, on a small island at the mouth of the river Hawkesbury,
where he also continued to build small vessels; it was here, and
on the banks of the river, that, according to the accounts o
several persons whom I found at Windsor, Andrew Thompson carried
on the illicit distillation of spirits.</p>
<p>To his other employments, he added those of constable and
public house keeper, and through liberal credit and forbearance,
he acquired a great deal of influence amongst the class of
smaller settlers in the neighbouring districts of the Hawkesbury.
To a considerable share of natural shrewdness he added great
activity of mind and body, and though quite uneducated when he
arrived in the colony, he succeeded afterwards in acquiring the
ordinary knowledge of a retail shop keeper.</p>
<p>His conduct in these several capacities is considered to have
been correct; but the habits of his domestic life were immoral.
His humanity in affording relief to the settlers, whose lands and
houses had been inundated upon two occasions by sudden rises of
the river Hawkesbury, has been much noticed and eulogized by
Governor Macquarrie, in an epitaph that he caused to be placed
upon his tomb-stone in the church yard at Windsor.</p>
<p>In this act, in which it has been said that there were mixed
motives of humanity, in endeavouring to give relief to the
unfortunate settlers, and of self interest in supplying them with
his own goods, A. Thomson derived some assistance from the boats
and convicts in the employ of government, that were then under
his superintendence at Windsor.</p>
<p>His activity upon this occasion is undeniable; but his claims
to the praise of great humanity, are more questionable.</p>
<p>I have been induced to make these observations upon the
character and conduct of A. Thomson, not from any wish to detract
from his merit as an individual, but because it is stated by
Governor Macquarrie, in the epitaph before alluded to, that "it
was in consequence of his character and conduct that he appointed
him to be a magistrate of the colony, and that by the same act, he
restored him to that rank in society which he had lost." These
circumstances are also of still further importance, as the
appointment of A. Thomson to the magistracy, was one of those
acts of Governor Macquarrie that has been urged most strongly
against him by his enemies, and has been most questioned by his
friends.</p>
<p>In his inquiry respecting the conduct of the leading
individuals in the colony, Governor Macquarrie, on his arrival,
applied to Lieutenant-colonel Foveaux for information, and from
him received a strong representation of the merits of A. Thomson,
both as an individual, and an active and intelligent chief
constable. I do not find however, that this recommendation
reached the length of stating him to have been fit for the office
of magistrate; certain it is, that the class of individuals to
whom A. Thomson belonged, had been considered and treated by
Lieutenant-colonel Foveaux in the same reserved and distant
manner in which the civil and military officers of the colony had
always regarded them.</p>
<p>A. Thomson had suffered some injury from the persons who
succeeded to the government, on the suspension of Governor Bligh,
and his fidelity to the legitimate authority of that officer haul
made him an object of their dislike and suspicion. The same
circumstances furnished an additional and just ground of
recommendation of him to Governor Macquarrie, who, in executing
the commands of his Sovereign to restore the legitimate authority
that had been violated in the person of his predecessor,
naturally looked towards those individuals who had remained
stedfast in their loyalty and obedience.</p>
<p>It must be acknowledged, that the number of these persons was
small, and when Governor Macquarrie succeeded to the command in
January 1810, Mr. George Palmer and Mr. Arndall were the only
persons who resided at, or in the immediate neighbourhood of
Windsor, who were eligible to the office of magistrate, or
competent to perform its duties. An offer of the magistracy was
made to Lieutenant Bell, who was an officer in the 102d regiment,
and who, though not directly implicated in the charge of mutiny
against Governor high, had, in obedience to the orders of the
commanding officer, led the detachment of the regiment that made
Governor Bligh prisoner in the government house at Sydney. The
conduct and character of Lieutenant Bell were in all other
respects unimpeached. He was solicited by Governor Macquarrie to
act as magistrate for the Windsor district, in conjunction with
A. Thomson, and he did not positively decline it. He however felt
so strong an objection to act in such a capacity with a person,
for an accidental association with whom, only a few months
before, he had been called to account, and reprimanded by his
commanding officer, Colonel Johnstone, that he availed himself of
an early excuse for returning to his estate in the neighbourhood,
and afterwards was sent to England to give evidence on Colonel
Johnstone's trial.</p>
<p>Although the number of candidates for the magisterial duties
was thus limited, it was rather surprising that Governor
Macquarrie did not select some one of the officers of his own
regiment, who in the military command at Windsor might also have
executed the duties of the magistracy, rather than appoint at
such an early period of his administration Andrew Thomson, who
was the first of the class of convicts, that after expiration of
sentence, had ever been so distinguished since the establishment
of the colony, and whose elevation to the bench of magistrates
proclaimed a very abrupt change in its system, by a person who
could not then be supposed to have much knowledge of its
interests.</p>
<p>The second reason alleged by Governor Macquarrie for this
appointment, was the restoration of A. Thomson to that rank in
society that he had lost by conviction for crime, and
transportation to New South Wales. Now, it has been seen, that
the condition of the parents of A. Thomson, and his rink in
society before conviction, were exceedingly humble, and that his
own efforts and industry in the colony had already placed him
above that condition, when he was made chief constable of the
district of Windsor, and became a possessor of houses in the
town, and of estates in the neighbourhood; and, if even this
appointment had the effect of raising him to that rank in society
that he had lost, (though in point of fact it had that of raising
him greatly above it) some consideration was surely due to the
feelings of those magistrates, as well as that society, who, with
the knowledge that they possessed of his recent situation, could
not but regard the unsolicited return of this lost member to his
rank and place amongst them, as a degradation of their own.
Andrew Thomson, notwithstanding, was thenceforth admitted to the
table of Governor Macquarrie, and to that of the officers of the
73d regiment, by a change of regulation, but not of feeling in
the military body, that was no less remarkable than the change
that had taken place in the sentiments of the civil chief. A.
Thomson did not long enjoy these honours, for he died in the
month of October of the same year in which he was made a
magistrate; and it is only just to state, that an address from
the inhabitants of the Windsor district was presented to Governor
Macquarrie upon this occasion, in which they expressed their
regret for the loss of Mr. A. Thompson, whom they described "as
their common friend and patron."</p>
<p>The next instance of the elevation to the magistracy of a
person who had been a convict, was that of Mr. S. Lord. He, like
A. Thomson, had been transported to the colony when young, and at
first was assigned as a servant to Captain Rowley of the 102d
regiment.</p>
<p>He afterwards lived with a female convict who had some
property in Sydney, and by the profits of her trade in baking,
and by his own industry, he acquired sufficient means to embark
in larger speculations; these he conducted with some success both
to India and in the South Sea fisheries. It was at the period
when his undertakings were most successful that Governor
Macquarrie arrived, and found him in the possession of one of the
best houses in Sydney. The circumstances of Mr. Lord's domestic
life were very notorious in the colony at the time of his
appointment to the magistracy, and the public animadversions that
were made in the Sydney Gazette, upon several attempts, which on
investigation appeared to have been made by him to seduce two of
the girls of the orphan school at Sydney, added to the general
feeling of surprize with which Mr. Lord's elevation to the
magistracy was viewed in the colony, although these
animadversions did not positively charge him with the crime. Mr.
Lord continued to act as magistrate at Sydney for some time, and
no objection appears to have been made to an association with him
by any other person than the Rev. Mr. Marsden.</p>
<p>This gentleman had refused to act with Mr. Lord and Mr.
Thomson as trustees of a turnpike road, to which office they had
been appointed by Governor Macquarrie, and without any previous
intimation to Mr. Marsden.</p>
<p>His reasons for this objection were founded upon the
immorality of their private lives; and the notoriety of that fact
does appear to me to have justified Mr. Marsden's refusal to be
associated with them in the management of the public roads; a
duty which would necessarily bring them much together, and which
might have the effect of showing to the colony that Mr. Marsden
associated with them from choice as well as from duty.</p>
<p>Mr. Marsden's objections to the policy of appointing men who
had been convicts to the magistracy, had at an early period
become the subject of discussion with Governor Macquarrie, who
appears even at that time to have so fully convinced himself of
the propriety and expediency of such appointments, that he could
not tolerate any difference of opinion upon it, though proceeding
from a person so respectable and so well informed as Mr. Marsden.
The account that he has given of his interview with Governor
Macquarrie, in which this subject was first discussed, is
strongly illustrative of the feelings that have subsequently
influenced, and unfortunately divided them, upon many others.</p>
<p>In the expressions of Governor Macquarrie, there may be traced
that determination which he has never relinquished under any
circumstances, of adhering to a system recommended more by
motives of humanity than of reason, and as new as it was
hazardous in practice; and, in the language of Mr. Marsden there
is observable the same undaunted and inflexible spirit that he
afterwards displayed, whenever an attempt was made to do violence
to his feelings, or to wound his character.</p>
<p>Upon this occasion, it does not appear that those feelings
were partaken by the other magistrates of the colony, nor by
those who sat upon the same bench with Mr. Lord at Sydney.</p>
<p>Without stating that his elevation to that rank has had a
positive influence upon his subsequent conduct, it is only
justice to him to state, that his former irregularities have been
latterly redeemed by the respectability of his domestic life. Mr.
Lord, after his appointment to the magistracy, became an
auctioneer in the town of Sydney; but the business was at first
conducted by his partner, Mr. Williams, a free person, and late
cashier of the bank of New South Wales, and latterly by Mr. Lord
himself. This duty has necessarily brought him into contact with
a very low description of people in the town of Sydney. He has,
however, been much trusted by the consignees of cargoes in the
disposal of them. His house, as well as his table, have been much
resorted to by the individuals who have had this sort of business
to transact; and his general usefulness as an agent, and his
activity in mercantile pursuits, have operated favourably amongst
those who were strangers to the colony, in removing the
objections of his former condition. Mr. Lord has for several
years continued to act in the capacity of magistrate at Sydney,
and was made a member of the Supreme Court, when it was opened by
Mr. J. Field in the year 1817. In the performance of these
duties, he has exhibited a good deal of natural sagacity and
shrewdness; but his want of education, and of feelings of
self-respect, have, on more than one occasion, exposed the
magisterial office to contempt.</p>
<p>The occurrence that I had the honour of submitting to your
Lordship, in the course of my discussion with Governor Macquarrie
on the appointment of Mr. Redfern to the magistracy, afforded an
instance of that fatal reference to former condition, that has
appeared to me to be an almost insurmountable obstacle to the
success of Governor Macquarrie's system of appointing this class
of persons to the magistracy, when tried in a community like that
of New South Wales.</p>
<p>The next person, from the same class, that was so
distinguished by Governor Macquarrie, was the Rev. Mr. Fulton. He
was transported by the sentence of a court martial in Ireland,
during the rebellion; and on his arrival in New South Wales in
the year 1800, was sent to Norfolk Island to officiate as
chaplain. He returned to New South Wales in the year 1804, and
performed the duties of chaplain at Sydney and Paramatta.</p>
<p>In the divisions that prevailed in the colony previous to the
arrest of Governor Bligh, Mr. Fulton took no part; but happening
to form one of his family when the person of the governor was
menaced with violence, he courageously opposed himself to the
military party that entered the house, and gave an example of
courage and devotion to the authority of Governor Bligh, which,
if partaken either by the Officer or his few adherents, would
have spared him the humiliation of a personal arrest, and rescued
his authority from the disgrace of open and violent
suspension.</p>
<p>Mr. Fulton accompanied Governor Bligh to England, for the
purpose of giving evidence upon the trial of Lieutenant-colonel
Johnstone; and on his return to New South Wales in the year 1812,
was appointed magistrate in the district of Castlereagh, where he
has since resided, performing the duty of chaplain in that
district, and conducting a school for the elementary and
classical education of boys, that continued to be attended by
most of the sons of the higher classes of the inhabitants of the
colony, until the arrival of Lawrence Halloran, and the
establishment of his school at Sydney. In the performance of his
clerical and magisterial duties, Mr. Fulton has been diligent and
respectable, and the sacred character with which he was invested,
and in which he had been allowed to appear previous to his
appointment to the magistracy, together with the nature of the
offence for which he was transported, abated much of the
objection that was felt on the appointments of Andrew Thomson and
Simon Lord. For these reasons, although I consider that under
other circumstances Mr. Fulton would not have been a valuable
acquisition to the bench of magistrates in New South Wales, yet
that his appointment was no discredit to it, and that his
services in the remote district in which he resided, were, at the
time of his appointment, and in the absence of any other
competent person, desirable.</p>
<p>The next and last person of the same class appointed by
Governor Macquarrie to the magistracy, was Mr. Redfern.</p>
<p>Your Lordship being in possession of the whole correspondence
that took place between Governor Macquarrie and myself, upon the
subject of this appointment, I will not again trouble you with a
repetition of the arguments that I then unsuccessfully addressed
to Governor Macquarrie, principally with a view of inducing him
to suspend the appointment until I had an opportunity of taking
your Lordship's pleasure respecting it; as however, that pleasure
has now been signified, and Mr. Redfern's name has been left out
of the new commission that Governor Macquarrie was directed to
issue, on the accession of His present Majesty to the throne, I
think it right to state how far the observations and objections
that I made to this appointment at the early period of my
commission, have been justified by the result.</p>
<p>In the course of my inquiry, I learnt from Mr. Redfern himself
that he had been sentenced to death by a naval court martial, for
being implicated in the mutiny at the Nore in the year 1797, and
that the nature of his offence consisted in having verbally
advised the leaders of the mutiny "to be more united amongst
themselves". Mr. Redfern was at that time about 19 years of age,
and had served for a few months as surgeon's first mate on board
His Majesty's ship the Standard.</p>
<p>In consideration of his youth, his life was spared, and his
sentence was commuted to transportation for life.</p>
<p>On his arrival in New South Wales, Mr. Redfern was sent to
Norfolk Island, where he acted as assistant to the surgeon on the
civil establishment, and was appointed in 1802 by
Lieutenant-colonel Foveaux to act as surgeon there. In that year
he also received from Governor King an absolute pardon; and his
name appears in the Sydney Gazette of the 19th June 1803, amongst
those upon whom that act of grace had been conferred. In the year
1804, Mr. Redfern was relieved by Mr. Wentworth, but continued to
assist him and Mr. Conollan until the month of May 1808, when he
accepted the situation of assistant surgeon at Sydney, under a
local commission, conferred upon him by Lieutenant-colonel
Foveaux, which, upon the strong recommendation made by that
officer to Governor Macquarrie, on his arrival, was submitted to
the consideration of His Majesty's government, and finally
sanctioned by His Royal Highness the Prince Regent, and announced
to the public in the Sydney Gazette of the 1st February 1812.
Since that period Mr. Redfern has continued to act as assistant
surgeon to the general hospital at Sydney, taking a very active
part in its duties, and deriving at the same time considerable
emolument from his private practice, which appears to have been
more extensive and successful than that of any other medical
practitioner in the colony. The nature and extent of these
emoluments, and the source from which they proceeded, had been
mentioned to nee before I had heard of Governor Macquarrie's
intention of appointing Mr. Redfern to the magistracy; and as my
attention was at that moment occupied by the investigation of
another and more extensive subject, I had not then an opportunity
of ascertaining the truth of the statement. In alluding to it,
therefore, I limited the observation I made to Governor
Macquarrie to a caution, against the immediate appointment of Mr.
Redfern, and used it as an additional reason for suspending it.
The circumstances attending this case are detailed, in the
evidence of several witnesses who had acted in subordinate
situations in the hospital during the period of Mr. Redfern's
service; and it appears from their evidence, that he had for some
time kept a dispensary in the house provided for him by
government, near the hospital at Sydney, where he was in the
habit of making up and dispensinq medicine for his private
practice in the town, as well as for those of the civil officers
whom he attended, and who have always been considered entitled to
receive both medicine and attendance gratuitously. A practice had
prevailed in the medical establishments in New South Wales, from
the earliest period, of dispensing medicine from them, not only
to convicts and to persons on the civil establishment, but to
those who had ceased to be in any manner connected with them.
Free persons of the higher classes were thus admitted to have
their wants supplied from sources that were destined by His
Majesty's government for the use of only one class; and the
hospital stores have, according to Mr. Redfern's observation,
been converted into general colonial dispensaries, to which,
through the means of some of the medical officers, the
inhabitants have had a constant but not gratuitous access, not
only afforded at the expense of government, but to the prejudice
of that class for whose special benefit these establishments were
formed and maintained.</p>
<p>For admission of the poorer classes of free people to the
colonial hospitals, an order from the governor was and is still
considered to be requisite; but the same restriction does not
appear to have accompanied the issue of medicine, when
application was made for it at the hospital, and when the
condition of the party seemed to justify the application. By
means of this custom, the assistant surgeons have, in the course
of their practice in the colony, administered considerable
quantities of medicine from the colonial dispensaries, or rather
from their own dispensaries, supplied from the government stores;
and Mr. Redfern having had the largest share of private practice
in the colony, and having never imported medicine on his own
account, it is to be inferred that he partook more largely of the
medical stores of government than any other person. A general
inquiry into the circumstance and character of Mr. Redfern, that
had been suggested by Governor Macquarrie's appointment of him to
the magistracy, and the sight of a remarkably well cleared and
well cultivated estate, that had attracted my notice in passing
through the district of Airds, and which I was informed was his
property, had certainly excited in my mind some suspicions of the
possible abuse, that might have been made by him of this practice
in the medical department, and this surprise was increased, when
I found that Mr. Wentworth, the principal surgeon, had always
abstained from the practice himself, or if he sent any orders for
medicine, always returned an equivalent. Entries, it appears,
were then made of the quantity of medicine taken, but this
precaution was not adopted when it was conveyed in large
quantities to the dispensary of Mr. Redfern. Whether the supplies
of medicine thus made by him to the free inhabitants of the
colony not entitled to receive it were gratuitous, or whether
they constituted a distinct source of profit to him, though
blended with the charges that be made for medical attendance, are
points upon which I have not yet been able to come to a very
satisfactory conclusion. It is stated by Mr. Henry Cowper, who
was Mr. Redfern's apprentice, that although entries of the
charges for medicine were made in Mr. Redfern's books, yet that
in the account that he rendered to his patients, he charged them
with attendance and medicines, and sometimes with medical
attendance only.</p>
<p>Wishing to have further evidence upon this point, I sent for a
person who had acted in the capacity of clerk in the dispensary
of the general hospital at Sydney, and had afterwards been
employed by Mr. Redfern to keep his private accounts. Upon his
first examination, on the 16th December 1819, and when he was yet
in the condition of a convict, he had declared before me that the
prices of the medicine were charged by Mr. Redfern to his
patients, and that they were entered in the ledger. Subsequently
to this, and after he had received an emancipation from Governor
Macquarrie, for which he had been recommended by Mr. Wentworth
and Mr. Redfern, he found sufficient reason to alter this
declaration, and he corrected his statement, by saying that
neither the quantities nor the prices of the medicine were ever
charged either in the accounts or the books. As I placed no
confidence in this man's declarations, and afterwards discovered
the reason for the change that had taken place in them; I
addressed myself to Mr. Redfern, and required him to produce the
private accounts of the medicine that he had supplied to
individuals, having previously informed him of the charges that
resulted from the information then before me. To this requisition
I received a direct refusal; and as I considered that I had no
authority to compel the production of these books, the question
of the profit thus made by Mr. Redfern in the appropriation of
the medical stores of government for several years was left and
still rests upon the testimony of Mr. Henry Cowper, who had
frequently seen the books, and whose testimony is confirmed
rather than contradicted by that of a prevaricating convict,
corrupted by the emancipation that he had received, and who had
himself made the entries in them; and finally, it rests upon the
refusal of Mr. Redfern to produce his books, and his offer to
return the medicines thus disposed of, if His Majesty's
government should be of opinion that he had no right to convert
to his own profit by sale, and without account, the supplies of
medicine that were specially destined for the use of the
convicts.</p>
<p>As to the nature of this appropriation, and whether under the
pretence of making a more convenient supply to the wants of his
patients, Mr. Redfern chose his own house rather than the
dispensary of the hospital, I do not think it necessary now to
observe, further than to state, that although the medicine was
taken from the hospital stores without any note or memorandum of
the quantities, yet I now believe there to have been no studied
concealment in the mode or act of taking it; and that this
profitable disposal of the property of government had continued
to be made for several years by Mr. Redfern, with the knowledge
of Mr. Wentworth, the principal surgeon, and without receiving
from him either prohibition or remark.</p>
<p>The surprise that I felt upon first becoming acquainted with a
practice that opened such a door to fraud, and that had been
found to be so very prejudicial to the lower order of patients in
the colonial hospital, by diminishing to them the supplies of the
most useful medicines, was somewhat increased by the silence of
Mr. Redfern under the first intimation that I personally made to
him on the subject, accompanied as it was with some remarks, that
were intended to convey to him the strong sense that I felt of
the impropriety, not to say criminality, of the practice. The
terms in which these remarks were conveyed, were made use of by
Mr. Redfern as a pretext for not again personally appearing
before me; and as I felt no wish to renew an inquiry into facts
that appeared to be admitted, I allowed him to make his defence
in writing to the charges that had resulted from them. These
charges involved another point of professional duty, which he
successfully answered; and two or three of personal conduct, for
which Mr. Redfern considered himself responsible to the parties
atone, and declined to afford me any explanation: the first of
these points was that of unjustifiable severity in the punishment
of his apprentice, Mr. Henry Cowper, and in the treatment of one
of his convict servants; and the next was that of sending a very
insulting letter to Mr. Bowman, the principal surgeon, who had
succeeded to that office on the retirement of Mr. Wentworth,
contrary to the expectations of Mr. Redfern, and to the
recommendation of Governor Macquarrie. I was aware that these
points bore reference only to the private and personal character
of Mr. Redfern; but as I conceived that Governor Macquarrie, by
raising him to the magistracy as well as by introducing him to
his society, had, provoked and challenged inquiry into these as
well as other points of Mr. Redfern's character, and that the
whole conduct of one whose later years were supposed to have
atoned for the acknowledged enormity of his former crime, might
justly become a subject of my inquiry, I deemed it my duty to
enter upon it, more especially as the point in question, if
established, seemed to me to affect materially the wisdom of the
appointment and selection of Mr. Redfern for the magisterial
office in New South Wales; for it betrayed an irritability, or
rather a violence of temper, both towards his inferiors and
superiors, which, if displayed in that capacity, might be
productive of serious injury to the district in which he was
about to serve. It is admitted by Mr. Redfern that he chastised
his apprentice, and it is admitted by. the latter that he
deserved chastisement; but the severity and mode in which it was
inflicted, both upon the apprentice and the convict servant,
exceeded the bounds which the law has prescribed in the one case,
and was a positive violation of an order long ago issued in, New
South Wales, by which a master is prohibited from striking his
convict servant.</p>
<p>The letter to Mr. Bowman was written at a period when the
feelings of Mr. Redfern were smarting under the disappointment,
in not succeeding Mr. Wentworth in the office of principal
surgeon of the colony; and he appears to have taken an
opportunity of indulging them, on having heard of Mr. Bowman's
visit to the colonial hospital, and of his making inquiries
concerning the patients there, before his appointment to the
office had been notified in the Sydney Gazette, or that the
change of officers had actually taken place.</p>
<p>It appears that one of the convicts that had been under Mr.
Bowman's care in the John Barry, convict ship, from England to
New South Wales, had been sent on his arrival to the general
hospital at Sydney. Desirous of knowing how he was, Mr. Bowman
had repaired to the hospital, but declined to enter it till he
had seen. Mr. Wentworth, although he conceived that under the
general admission that is given to all surgeons of the navy to
visit the great medical establishments in England, the permission
of Mr. Wentworth was not indispensable to enable him to view the
colonial hospital at Sydney. As Mr. Wentworth was absent, and did
not arrive at the hospital till Mr. Bowman had left it, he
informed Mr. Cowper, who then acted as assistant surgeon, that if
Mr. Bowman should call again at the hospital on the following
day, and that if he wished to see it, he (Mr. Wentworth) would
accompany him. It happened that Mr. Bowman called in Mr.
Wentworth's absence, and as he found on inquiry, that Mr. Redfern
was confined to his house by illness, he, without waiting for Mr.
Wentworth, accompanied Mr. Cowper through the wards of the
hospital. In the course of this visit he saw, and made some
inquiry of his patient respecting his treatment, and then
retired.</p>
<p>Upon information being given to Mr. Redfern of this visit, he
addressed a letter to Mr. Bowman, which, considering the relative
situation of the parties, he did not think himself called upon to
notice, but in which, after assuming that the hospital was in his
charge, and was to be considered to remain so until the change of
officers took place, Mr. Redfern charges Mr. Bowman with having
had recourse to insidious and unbecoming means for the purpose of
obtaining the appointment to the office of principal surgeon,
which Mr. Redfern, through the recommendation of Governor
Macquarrie, had so anxiously expected to obtain.</p>
<p>Allowing for the irritation of feeling that a sense of these
galling circumstances may have produced, I cannot admit that Mr.
Redfern had any right to assume the exclusive control of the
general hospital, when Mr. Wentworth was on the spot, or to
dictate to a professional man, upon what terms he was to be
admitted to it. The temper and character of Mr. Redfern are
strongly illustrated in this, as well as another letter that he
addressed to Mr. Bowman, on his succeeding to the charge of the
general hospital, and they have received still further
illustration from the several letters that he addressed to myself
upon the nature of my inquiries into his conduct, and the
unsuccessful result of my interference in his appointment to the
magistracy.</p>
<p>The result of these inquiries has confirmed me in the belief
that I then and hive since entertained, that although Mr.
Redfern's professional skill was acknowledged, and that, aided by
great assiduity and good natural talents, he had overcome the
want of early study and experience, yet, that the irritability of
his temper constituted a well founded objection to his
appointment to the magistracy. My objections, however, were not
confined to this defect alone.</p>
<p>It had been the good, or as many persons in the colony have
thought, the ill fortune of Mr. Redfern, to have been
distinguished by a more than ordinary share, of the notice of
Governor and Mrs. Macquarrie. The proofs that they had received
of his professional merits, and his activity and zeal in the
performance of his public duties, confirmed the recommendations
that they had received of him from Major General Foveaux; and
they conceived that Mr. Redfern was equally fit on other grounds
to be admitted to their own society, as well as to be
particularly pointed out to the notice of others.</p>
<p>Governor Macquarrie had, at a very early period of his
administration, adopted a plan of introducing into society
persons who had once been convicts, and whose subsequent good
conduct had, in his opinion, atoned for their past errors; he
considered that this plan was both practicable and expedient. In
this belief he was much confirmed by the approbation bestowed
upon it in the Report of the Parliamentary Committee on
Transportation, that was presented to Parliament in the year
1812. As I shall have hereafter to consider the operation of this
system in its general effects upon the convicts, and on the state
of society in New South Wales, I will only now observe, that I
believe the strong terms in which that approbation was conveyed,
had a much more powerful influence upon Governor Macquarrie's
subsequent conduct, than the salutary cautions contained in your
Lordship's dispatch of the 3d February 1814; and that if he has
erred in carrying a humane principle too far, he has done so
under the belief that he was acting under the sanction of very
high and respectable authority. With these impressions respecting
the system, and the prepossessions in favour of the individual,
Governor Macquarrie continued to give to Mr. Redfern, from the
earliest periods, the full benefit of his notice and society both
on public and private occasions.</p>
<p>The effect of this measure has been precisely the reverse of
the expectation entertained by the Governor, as well as by the
Parliamentary Committee. His determined adherence to his system,
in favour of an individual by no means popular, has raised
opposition to it, not so much from objection to the principle,
but from the idea that an attempt was made to force its adoption.
Another cause of this failure may be fairly attributed to the
injudicious manner in which the attempt was made, and the
peculiar feelings and situation of the persons upon whom it was
tried.</p>
<p>Your Lordship being already acquainted with the nature of the
discussions that took place between Governor Macquarrie and the
officers of the 46th regiment of foot, during their residence at
New South Wales, upon the subject of admitting persons who had
been convicts to their society, I will not again repeat them.</p>
<p>The determination with which they had resisted all attempts to
introduce Mr. Redfern to their society, while they formed part of
the garrison, continued unabated to the period of their
departure.</p>
<p>Governor Macquarrie had some reason to believe that he should
not find a greater degree of compliance in the corps that
succeeded them, and that they would at once adopt the opinions
that had guided their predecessors, and that may be supposed to
belong to all bodies of men, careful of their honour, and keenly
sensible to every attempt to sully it.</p>
<p>The officers of the 48th regiment were well acquainted with
the discussions that had prevailed between the governor and the
46th regiment; and although they had not come to any previous or
precise determination, as to the line of conduct they were to
pursue, the general, but not the unanimous opinion of the
officers, was against the admission of the obnoxious class to
their society, on any terms. Soon after the arrival of the
regiment at Sydney, the officers were invited on one public and
several private occasions, to the government house, and they were
there introduced to the Reverend Mr. Fulton as one of the
chaplains of the colony, and to Mr. Redfern as one of the
assistant surgeons. An effort was then made by Brigade Major
Antill (which after the declarations of that officer and Governor
Macquarrie, I am bound to consider as quite spontaneous on his
part), to introduce Mr. Redfern to the officers of the 48th
regiment.</p>
<p>Major Antill, accompanied by Mr. Redfern, called upon most of
them, and with the exception of accompanied Erskine, Major
Morissett, and Major Druitt, was denied admittance, under
circumstances that must have been very painful to Mr. Redfern,
and ought to have speedily convinced Major Antill of the bad
effects of his injudicious friendship.</p>
<p>With the above mentioned exceptions, these visits were not
returned, and no notice of Mr. Redfern was taken by the officers
in meeting him again. From this period, the difference in the
conduct of some of the officers of the regiment towards Mr.
Redfern was very marked. Lieutenant-colonel Erskine, Major
Morissett and Major Druitt, not only noticed Mr. Redfern at the
governor's parties, but began to be constant visitors at his
house.</p>
<p>Mr. Redfern was also invited by Colonel Erskine to private
parties, and as his guest to the mess of the 48th regiment, and
it was upon one of these occasions, that the junior officers of
the regiment abruptly quitted the table, and in a manner that
evidently betrayed their objection to Mr. Redfern, who was
present, and who was known to be Lieutenant-colonel Erskine's
guest. The consequence of this conduct of the junior officers,
was the promulgation of a mess rule by Lieutenant-colonel.
Erskine, requiring that no officer should quit the table until
after the first thirds were drank.</p>
<p>These repeated rejections of Mr. Redfern on the part of the
officers of the 48th regiment, having given reason to Governor
Macquarrie to believe that they had imbibed, and meant to act
upon the opinions of their predecessors, he took occasion at
their first half-yearly inspection in January 1818, to warn them
against following the example of the officers of the 46th
regiment, and to express his hope that cordiality would prevail
between himself and them.</p>
<p>He adverted to the practice that he had observed in admitting
to his society persons who had been convicts, and is subsequent
conduct seemed to him to have atoned for their offences, and
although it was not his intention or wish to force the officers
to an association with that class of persons, yet he expected
that they would abstain from making improper remarks upon his
practice, or the measures of his government.</p>
<p>In arranging the invitations for the public dinner that was
given by the regiment on the same day, it had been determined,
that it was not necessary for them, to ask any other person than
those who composed the military suite of the general, and
consisting then only of the brigade-major, and the aide-de-camp.
No invitation, therefore, was sent by the officers to Mr.
Redfern, who notwithstanding was invited by Lieutenant-colonel
Erskine, and appeared at table as his guest, though in the suite
of the governor. I am not aware that Mr. Redfern's visits to the
mess of the 48th regiment were repeated after this occasion,
although he frequently appeared at the government house
afterwards, when the officers were invited.</p>
<p>The efforts of Governor Macquarrie to introduce Mr. Redfern
into general society, have not been more successful with the
civil officers and inhabitants of the colony, a circumstance that
surprised me the more, as I conceived it most probable that his
professional claims and merits would have obtained for him a
general admission to those families, who might have excluded him
upon other grounds. I do not find, however, that this was the
case, and I have reason to believe, as well from personal
observation of Mr. Redfern's general demeanour, as from other
sources of information, that his conduct in company, and even
amongst those who were strangers to his situation, was both
forward and obtrusive, and betrayed an entire forgetfulness in
himself, of that occurrence in his life, which he will find it
difficult to erase from the memory or feelings of others.</p>
<p>It is this difficulty, varying in degree with men and with
their opinions, that constitutes the formidable impediment, to
the efforts of Governor Macquarrie to bring back into society,
not only the individual in question, but all other persons who
have been once rendered infamous, either by their sentence or
their crimes, I am far from blaming his motives or his attempt,
though I may not approve his measures for giving effect to them;
but if this difficulty is felt, in obtaining the admission of
such persons to society, how much greater must it be in raising
them to the functions and the honours of the magistracy, without
diminishing that respect for the law and for its dispensers,
which it is so important in every country to uphold. It is not
enough for this purpose that an individual should have been
prosperous in trade, that he should have been skilful in surgery,
or dexterous in the art of acquiring wealth and influence; his
pretensions should be founded on some less equivocal and more
moral basis; or on one, in the acknowledgment of which a large
majority of the world will acquiesce. Instances certainly may
arise, in which such claims may be united; but, with the
exception I have before made, in favour of the sacred character
and functions of the Rev. Mr. Fulton, I do not think that any of
the persons of this class whom Governor Macquarrie has selected
for the magistracy in New South Wales have possessed such
pretensions; and I cannot help submitting to your Lordship as my
opinion, that these appointments were unnecessary, that they
produced no good effect upon the parties themselves, and that
they have lowered the respect and estimation of the magisterial
office.</p>
<p>The particular circumstances of Mr. Redfern's case tended
further to excite feelings no less prejudicial to its character.
That part of the colony, that was most favourable to Mr. Redfern,
attributed the appointment to the sympathy of Governor Macquarrie
in Mr. Redfern's disappointment for the loss of the situation of
principal surgeon, and to which, I believe, there are many, who
would have gladly seen him succeed; but although these persons
might sympathize with his disappointment, yet they could not help
feeling that the nature of the compensation was unjust: if it was
to stand in the place of a profitable exercise of his profession
as assistant surgeon, an additional grant of land, or a larger
portion of the colonial indulgences, would have more
substantially proved the sympathy of Governor Macquarrie, and the
readiness of the government to reward with liberality the
services and merits of us, public servants, from whatever class
of the community they had been taken but, if it was to compensate
for want of rank, or to gratify an ambition much encouraged and
cherished of obtaining a higher, then indeed the appointment of
Mr. Redfern was still more objectionable; for his elevation to
the magistracy proved, that by a sudden exertion of his own
power, the governor was determined to procure for Mr. Redfern a
much higher rank than your Lordship was inclined to bestow upon
him; and to force hint upon 8 society which, in spite of ten
years of the governor's influence and example, had pronounced his
exclusion. The appointment then assumed the appearance of a
triumph of power over opinion; and it equally became a violation
of that salutary instruction of your Lordship, by which Governor
Macquarrie was enjoined to abstain from the use of authority or
force, in a case where it is clear that influence and example had
already failed, and where, it is equally clear, that they are the
only means that can be used.</p>
<p>It was upon a view of these circumstances, in combination, but
more especially upon the acknowledgment made to me by Governor
Macquarrie, that his principal reasons for appointing Mr. Redfern
to the magistracy, were to soothe his feelings for the
disappointment occasioned by your Lordship's appointment of Mr.
Bowman, and to fulfil a promise that he had unwarily made him,
that I felt it my duty to protest against the execution of it in
favour of Mr. Redfern. It did appear to me then as it does now,
that an act so manifestly at variance, as I conceived it to have
been, with the tenor of your Lordship's instructions, and so
prejudicial to the colonial interests, was not to be put in
competition for a moment, with the personal feelings of any man,
much less with those of Mr. Redfern.</p>
<p>Judging of Governor Macquarrie's sense of duty, by that which
I trust has always influenced my own, my astonishment at his
perseverance in a line so directly opposed to it, was only
equalled, by that which I felt, in the sudden recal of an
acquiescence that he had at first signified to me, then acted
upon, and afterwards abandoned, in the short space of two days. I
certainly then was not without apprehension, that this opposition
to your Lordship's views and my suggestions, might be imputable
to some new influence, of which till then I was not aware; and I
felt a still greater degree of alarm and surprise, when I saw,
that the terms of Mr. Redfern's appointment were enlarged from
that of a district (to which I was informed by Governor
Macquarrie they were to be limited) to the territory of New South
Wales, which had the effect of giving to him rank and precedence
over magistrates who had long served that office, and who had
never been convicts, and of making a distinction as mortifying to
them, as it was contrary to the principle of seniority, by which
the magisterial rank is regulated in England.</p>
<p>These circumstances I have thought right to state in
vindication of the earnest manner in which I addressed myself to
Governor Macquarrie, in the correspondence that is now before
your Lordship, and which, perhaps, under other circumstances, I
should not have been justified in using. Before I quit this
subject, I think it right to mention, that in consequence of the
opinion entertained by Governor Macquarrie himself, of Mr. Lord,
and of the discredit that his occupations as an auctioneer had
brought upon the magisterial office, he had, with as much
consideration as possible for his feelings, suggested the
propriety of his resignation. Mr. Lord acquiesced in this
suggestion, but as it was made at the commencement of my
inquiries, he requested it might be postponed till they should be
concluded, that he might not appear to the public to apprehend
the consequences of any disclosures or information that might
reach me.</p>
<p>In this suggestion Governor Macquarrie acquiesced; and Mr.
Lord's resignation, in consequence of his bad state of health,
was announced in a public order complimentary to him, and
inserted in the Sydney Gazette, previous to the appearance of the
new commission of the year 1821.</p>
<p>The next points in which the magisterial office has suffered
in New South Wales, are the loss of the services of the Rev. Mr.
Marsden, and the circumstances that attended his dismissal.</p>
<p>It is hardly necessary to state to your Lordship, the
extensive knowledge that Mr. Marsden had necessarily acquired of
the character and dispositions of the persons who most frequently
came before the magistrates, and of the motives that influence
them, by his long residence in the colony of New South Wales. In
the guidance of this knowledge, he was assisted by a strong
natural understanding, and in its application, by great sagacity
and an intrepid and determined spirit. In the course of his
duties he had shown himself to be equally active in the
investigation and pursuit of crime, and had received the thanks
of Governor Macquarrie for his services.</p>
<p>Without, however, impeaching the moral feelings of Mr.
Marsden, and without stating it as my opinion that he has acted
with undue severity, it is in proof, that his sentences are not
only, in fact, more severe than those of the other magistrates,
but that the general opinion of the colony is, that his
character, as displayed in the administration of the penal law in
New South Wales, is stamped with severity. I am far from
entertaining an opinion that it forms part of Mr. Marsden's
natural character; but I think that it has proceeded from the
habitual contemplation of the depravity of the people that were
brought before him; from the sense that he gradually acquired of
the inefficiency of any other punishment than that which was
severely and corporally felt by them; and the limitation that was
imposed by an order of Governor Macquarrie's, which assigned a
certain number only of delinquents for the chain gangs in each
town. In accounting for Governor Macquarrie's motives in abruptly
dismissing a magistrate, who, both by his own acknowledgment, and
in that I believe of all the well judging persons in the
community, was the most valuable in it, I think it necessary to
refer to the circumstances that occurred in the interview that
took place at the government house between Mr. Marsden and
Governor Macquarrie, and that are detailed in a letter of Mr.
Marsden's, that has been lately submitted to your Lordship's
notice, the contents of which, I was assured by him, were never
intended to meet the public eye, but which were represented to me
by the Reverend Mr. Cowper, who attended at the interview, as
being substantially true. Other interviews had taken place,
between them, in which the language and want of temper displayed
by Governor Macquarrie towards Mr. Marsden, considering the
friendly terms upon which, for some time, they had continued to
act, were much to be regretted, and are only, and have generally
been attributed to the first and great difference of opinion,
upon the unfortunate question of admitting persons who had been
convicts to the honours of the magistracy, and to a belief that
Governor Macquarrie entertained of Mr. Marsden having been the
author of the statement respecting the state of the Paramatta
factory, and the severity of punishments in the colony, that I
have before adverted to; and which was transmitted to Sir Henry
Bunbury, formerly under-secretary of state for the colonies, by
Mr. Bailey. It is admitted now, that Mr. Bailey was the author of
the statement; and from what I have already observed upon the
state of the factory at Paramatta, and what I shall hereafter
submit upon the subject of the colonial punishments, your
Lordship will be enabled to judge how much of this statement was
true. Mr. Bailey was in habits of intimacy and friendship with
Mr. Marsden, and had been an eye witness of one of the
circumstances that he stated, and most probably derived his
knowledge of the others from their notoriety, and from the
communications of Mr. Marsden. On reference, however, to Mr.
Bailey's statement, your Lordship will find, that he mixes up a
representation of personal, with local grievances, and that the
latter derive much of the colouring that is given them, as well
as their direction from that cause. Without any explanation,
therefore, respecting the author, which seems to have been given
at a late period, through the friendly interference of Mr. J.
Field, mid with the other cause of disunion operating in his
mind, Governor Macquarrie felt that he had some reason. to doubt
the sincerity of Mr. Marsden's attachment to his administration,
and that he had secretly conveyed information against it to your
Lordship. The extreme severity of rebuke that was afterwards
passed by Governor Macquarrie neon Mr. Marsden, and the indignity
that accompanied it at the interview I have before alluded to,
naturally produced in his mind a strong dislike to remain any
longer in his situation of magistrate. Mr. Marsden was charged in
that interview by Governor Macquarrie with opposition to his
government, and with seditious practices. The opposition to these
measures of his government consisted of Mr. Marsden's refusal to
be associated In duty with two such persons as Andrew Thomson and
Simon Lord, whom, in spite of the governor's opinion and notice,
he still continued regard as immoral men; and of his objection to
the admission of persons who had been convicts, into society as a
principle; and his sedition appears to have consisted 110 in the
act of taking the affidavit of a public flogger respecting the
punishment of two free men, and the confinement of two free women
in gaol, by order of if the governor, on the report only of the
chief constable, who apprehended them. The particulars of this
act of authority of the governor will be detailed in my remarks
upon the colonial punishments; for the present, I will observe
that it was one, which the best friends of Governor Macquarrie
regretted, both on account of its violence and illegality, and
for the just alarm that it excited even amongst those who thought
and felt that silence was their most prudent course. To the
persons who had already declared their opposition to the
governor's measures, it was an act that furnished a specious and
just ground of attack.</p>
<p>From a consciousness, perhaps, of having thus unwarily exposed
himself to it, and that he was without defence, Governor
Macquarrie from one error, only fell into another.</p>
<p>A petition to the House of Commons, in which a complaint of
this, amongst other acts of his government, was inserted, had
been drawn up, with the advice and assistance of Sir. J. Hart
Bent, had been industriously circulated in the colony, and had
obtained many signatures. The manner in which some of these were
obtained, and the ingratitude that marked the conduct of some of
that class of persons who had lately received emancipations from
him (and on whose attachment he had vainly relied) excited in the
mind of the governor feelings of warm and just indignation, and
urged by these feelings he not only denounced their petition as
seditious, infamous and false, but refused licences to two
publicans of Sydney, for having allowed copies of it to remain at
their houses for signature, and refused to give an additional
grant of land to one of the most respectable of the whole class
of emancipated convicts, who in a moment of intoxication, or
ignorant enthusiasm, had affixed his mark to the petition.</p>
<p>It has been the misfortune of Governor Macquarrie to receive
from your Lordship a censure for this act, to the severity and
justice of which, I feel that it would be indecorous in me, if it
were possible, to attempt to add any thing; but I think it right
to allude to it, as one amongst other proofs, of the impression,
to which Governor Macquarrie has unfortunately too much yielded,
that an attempt to expose an abuse of his authority, was an act
of sedition. It was precisely under the strong influence of this
notion, that Governor Macquarrie thought it necessary or
advisable to listen to the verbal report of the gaoler of Sydney,
and the evidence of the public flogger, from both of which he
collected that Mr. Marsden had solicited the persons who had been
punished, as well as the flogger, to come forward and declare the
particulars before him. The fact of his having done so is
negatived by the testimony of Blake, who declares that he was
persuaded to make his declaration by several individuals who had
felt alarm for themselves on account of this punishment; and by
the testimony of Daniel Cubitt, whom Mr. Marsden emphatically
describes as an "honest gaoler". The evidence of the public
flogger before me, as well as that which he gave on oath before
Mr. Campbell, the governor's secretary, would lead to the
conclusion, that Mr. Marsden had sent for him to snake an
affidavit, if his circumstances, at the time that he gave his
first evidence, as well as his character, did not afford strong
reasons for disbelieving him, especially when his declarations
have been pointedly contradicted by those of Mr. Marsden, to
which, unsolicited by me, he has thought fit to add the solemnity
of an oath; and in as far as their knowledge and observation
went, by the declarations of Mr. Campbell and Mr. Hooke.</p>
<p>Upon a review of the evidence of these persons, I have been
compelled to come to a very different conclusion from that which
Governor Macquarrie adopted, respecting the part that Mr. Marsden
took in this transaction, as I consider that the utmost that he
did was to take the affidavit or the public flogger respecting
the fact of the punishment; an act, that any magistrate would
have been as competent to perform whether in his district or out
of it, and for the effect or object of which, he could in no wise
be considered responsible.</p>
<p>The length of time that had elapsed after the punishment took
place, makes it improbable that Mr. Marsden would have lent
himself, at so late a period, to a party in the colony retaining
hostility towards Governor Macquarrie, for acts that he had
committed so long before, but that were always very notorious,
and which Mr. Marsden must have known to have been perfectly
within the knowledge of Mr. J. Hart Bent, and that through him,
they would be submitted either to the notice of Parliament or of
your Lordship. It was, however, under the impressions to which I
have before alluded, as well as under a belief of the truth of
this evidence, that Governor Macquarrie came to the resolution of
taxing Mr. Marsden with the crimes Of sedition and mutiny in the
presence of persons, who appeared to have been summoned for the
purpose of increasing the measure of his humiliation, while their
presence, though it did not intimidate him, does not appear to
have had the effect of restraining, within ordinary bounds, the
severity and personality of the governor's remarks.</p>
<p>I am not aware that Mr. Marsden has ever addressed any
complaints to your Lordship upon the circumstances of this
interview; and it is only to be wondered that he did not persist
in the resolution that he had declared to Governor Macquarrie at
the interview, of ceasing any longer to act as magistrate.</p>
<p>An occasion arose soon after this interview, which Mr. Marsden
considered as a favourable opportunity of pressing his
resignation: Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde, in the month of March of
the year 1818, had, upon a casual visit to the gaol at Paramatta,
observed several prisoners in it who had been sentenced to long
terms of imprisonment by the bench of magistrates at Paramatta,
then consisting of the Rev. Mr. Marsden, and Mr. Hannibal
M&#145;Arthur. As Governor Macquarrie had requested the judge
advocate, whenever he visited the gaols, to make a report to him
of any thing that was worthy of remark in the conduct or cases of
the prisoners, he took an opportunity after his visit, in which
it appears that he had been accompanied by Mr. Marsden, to submit
to Governor Macquarrie the names of those prisoners who had
already suffered long imprisonment, under what appeared to him to
be heavy sentences, and whom the governor might think fit objects
of release, if he should deem expedient at all to relieve the
gaol at that time from the number of prisoners that were in
it.</p>
<p>The letter in which this representation was made, Governor
Macquarrie was unable to find; it does not appear to have been
accompanied with any observation from the judge advocate on the
several cases of the prisoners, or of any disproportion of their
punishments to their offences.</p>
<p>The suggestion of release, indeed, seemed to arise, not from
any consideration of the crimes or punishments of the prisoners,
but from the incapacity of the gaol to contain them, together
with the many other prisoners then confined in it. The number
then confined in the chain gang did not exceed 11; of these,
several were sentenced to labour for twelve months, of which six,
and in some instances more, had expired. They were drawn out for
the inspection of the judge advocate, who received information
from Mr. Marsden and Mr. Oakes, the chief constable, as he went
along, respecting their characters and crimes. The prisoners
themselves, as usual, upon such occasions, represented to Mr.
Judge Advocate Wylde the state of their punishments; but I cannot
concur in the inference drawn by Mr. Marsden, that the judge
advocate appeared to listen with more attention to the
representation of the prisoners, than to those which he made. It
is most probable that the representations of both were made with
earnestness, as Mr. Marsden, in his account of the proceeding,
states, that he represented them to the judge advocate to the
most daring felons; and the prisoners, concluding that the judge
advocate, in consequence of his inquiry, was invested with some
superior authority that might tend to their release, would press
as earnestly upon him the apparent hardships of their
punishments.</p>
<p>I do not find, from the testimony of Mr. Oakes, who was
present, that any observation fell from the judge advocate, on
this occasion, that had the effect of throwing a slight or
censure on the authority of Mr. Marsden as a magistrate, in his
presence; and the part that he took in the release of the
prisoners, had reference only to the state of the gaol, and not
to the nature of their sentences.</p>
<p>A similar release of prisoners had taken place on several
preceding occasions, by the simple authority of the governor,
without reference to the magistrates; and although the accidental
visit of the judge advocate to the gaol, in this instance, might
have produced a belief in Mr. Marsden's mind, that his
representations to the governor had given rise to the release of
the prisoners whom he had sentenced to be confined, and that the
government had sanctioned it in consequence of the impressions
that he had received, and conveyed to your Lordship, of Mr.
Marsden's severity, yet I cannot think that there was sufficient
cause for Mr. Marsden to impute, either to the judge advocate an
intention to insult him by any thing that he did, or any advice
that he gave to Governor Macquarrie on this occasion, or to
impute to the governor an intention of offering indignity to his
magisterial character.</p>
<p>Mr. Hannibal M&#145;Arthur, who had joined with Mr. Marsden in
passing the same sentences upon these prisoners, witnessed their
release before the expiration of the terms of their punishments,
without reference to himself, and did not conceive that airy
insult was cast upon him by such an act.</p>
<p>That the effect of this act was to lower the estimation of the
authority of the magistrates in the eyes of the prisoners, is
certainly true; and it is further to be regretted, that if any of
the prisoners were to be released, reference had not been made by
Governor Macquarrie to those who had the best means of knowing
their respective demerits, rather than to the judge advocate, who
could only derive them from very suspicious sources; and that the
same principle of consideration and forbearance that had
prevented the governor from interfering with long sentences
passed by Mr. Garling, when he acted as judge advocate, had not
influenced him on this occasion.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the governor's warrant addressed to the chief
constable of Paramatta, for the release of the prisoners who had
been named by the judge advocate as fit to be discharged, Mr.
Marsden forthwith addressed a letter to Governor Macquarrie,
dated the 28th March 1818, in which he stated, "that under the
existing circumstances he felt it a duty that he owed to himself
to resign the office of civil magistrate", but made no reference
to the nature of those circumstances.</p>
<p>To this letter Mr. Marsden received no answer; but in a few
days afterwards he received a letter from Mr. J. T. Campbell, the
governor's secretary, inclosing for his information and guidance,
an attested copy of a government and general order, in which it
was stated, "that his excellency the governor had been pleased to
dispense with the services of the Reverend Samuel Marsden, as
justice of the peace and magistrate at Paramatta, and its
adjoining districts." In explanation of his conduct towards Mr.
Marsden, in retaining him in the magistracy after he had accused
him of the crimes of sedition and mutiny, and in spite of Mr.
Marsden's wish to retire from it as well as for his abruptly
declaring, by a public order, that be dispensed with his services
as magistrate, when Mr. Marsden had declared that he could no
longer act in that capacity, Governor Macquarrie has stated, that
he was fully aware, that Mr. Marsden's resignation was tendered,
with a view of giving him offence, and arose from a desire of
annoyance to him and his government, and it was for these reasons
that he preferred dispensing with Mr. Marsden's services.</p>
<p>The governor has not alluded to the circumstances from whence
he collected this intention of Mr. Marsden, therefore, I can only
presume that he derived it from the circumstance of Mr. Marsden's
letter of resignation, having so nearly followed the abrupt
release of the prisoners from the Paramatta gaol, without
reference to himself. Now although this act of the governor, had
not made the same impression upon the mind and feelings of Mr.
Hannibal M&#145;Arthur, that it had done upon those of Mr. Marsden,
that instances of it had occurred before, without offence being
intended or taken, and that it was done in the exercise of the
authority with which he is invested as governor, yet it cannot be
denied that it was one which was calculated to wound the feelings
of Mr. Marsden, when viewed by him in its connection with
circumstances that had before transpired, respecting his conduct
as a magistrate.</p>
<p>The power that Governor Macquarrie exercised of retaining the
services of Mr. Marsden, contrary to his expressed wish, affords
a strong testimony of their value, although it was testimony
extorted from him and accompanied with circumstances of
humiliation to Mr. Marsden; but when the period arrived in which
this wish of Mr. Marsden was repeated, and when the value of his
services had increased rather than diminished, it would have been
more consistent with the sense that Governor Macquarrie professed
to have of that value, if he had refrained from the mortifying
and humiliating communication, by which the public were informed
that Mr. Marsden's services were dispensed with. The uniform
tenor of Governor Macquarrie's communications, on the retirement
of the colonial officers from their public situations, and the
elaborate eulogies that have appeared from time to time in the
Sydney Gazettes upon their personal and public merits, must have
impressed the colony that had witnessed Mr. Marsden's services,
and knew their value, with a belief that the laconic
communication of the governor's pleasure, in dispensing with
them, was intended to form a mortifying exception to every
preceding occasion real dismissal accompanied with disgrace. Of
retirement, and to give to that which was dispensation only, the
appearance of a real dismissal accompanied with disgrace.</p>
<p>In endeavouring to trace the motives for the whole of Governor
Macquarrie's conduct to Mr. Marsden on these occasions, either as
they have appeared on inquiry from Governor Macquarrie or Mr.
Marsden, or from other persons in the colony, I have only been
able to assign two causes that can account for the peculiar
severity of treatment with which Mr. Marsden, in his magisterial
capacity, has been visited. First, an irreconcileable difference
of opinion upon the question of raising certain persons, who had
been convicts, to places of rank and confidence in the colony;
and secondly, a suspicion that while Mr. Marsden was receiving
hospitality and attention from the governor, and living upon
terms of cordiality and friendship with him, he was secretly, and
by indirect means or anonymous letters, denouncing the governor's
administration to your Lordship. Upon the first point I would
observe, that Mr. Marsden's opinions were more directed against
the individuals than against the system, and that although he has
felt less disposed than Governor Macquarrie to indulge sanguine
expectations of the entire reform of convicts, yet he does not go
so far as to think that those who are reformed should for ever be
excluded from society. Mr. Marsden, it has been seen, maintained
his own opinion with his characteristic firmness; and Governor
Macquarrie, in replying to it with warmth, did not then foresee,
and has never perceived since, the difficulty of enforcing a
system founded upon a principle, that is right in the abstract,
but which, in its application, has to conflict with every
possible variety of human judgment and feeling. It has been
another misfortune of Governor Macquarrie, not to make sufficient
allowance for these varieties of opinion, and to consider those
as opponents of his government who did not at once make a
surrender of their judgment and feeling to his, upon that most
delicate question, the estimate of moral character. In
endeavouring to subdue that of Mr. Marsden, or to lead that of
the military men, who have lately formed the garrison of Sydney,
he plainly showed that he had made a bad calculation of the
obstacles that might impede him. Other magistrates, and other
officers, he has undoubtedly found of more ductile dispositions
than Mr. Marsden, who manifested no disinclination, and felt no
disgrace in a near association with persons who had been
convicts, and of whose subsequent conduct and character they had
formed a good opinion, or adopted that of Governor Macquarrie. I
certainly cannot adduce any particular or positive instance of
the undue favour of the governor bestowed upon those individuals
who have met his views upon this subject, or of denial of that
favour towards those who did not adopt them, and Mr. Marsden had
no complaint to make of Governor Macquarrie's want of liberality
towards him in dispensing the colonial indulgences. It is,
however, the result of my inquiry and observations, that one of
principal source of the disunion between Governor Macquarrie and
Mr. Marsden has been their difference of opinion upon this topic,
and that it has imperceptibly led the former to indulge that
vehemence of expression and severity of rebuke in private
interviews with Mr. Marsden, of which the latter has had so much
and such just reason to complain.</p>
<p>Upon the second point I would observe, that Mr. Marsden had on
one special occasion made a strong representation to Governor
Macquarrie himself upon the state of the factory at Paramatta,
and upon the still more deplorable state of the hospital at that
place; but that observing that no measures were taken in the
colony to remedy these evils, and that he had no influence in
disposing the governor to apply any portion of his means to
afford it, he abandoned the hope of producing any effect by
personal or written communications to him; but I have not heard
or known of any that he addressed to your Lordship on these
subjects. He had previously remarked, in conversation to the
governor, on the injudicious severity and length of certain
punishments inflicted by the criminal courts of the colony, and
warned him against the consequences of their being brought to
public notice in England; and when the statement of Mr. Bayley,
in which these circumstances were set forth, was transmitted by
your Lordship as a charge against the governor's administration,
suspicion then arose in his mind that Mr. Marsden was the author
of the statement. It is, I conceive, upon this suspicion, and
from an impatience natural to those in the possession of
uncontrolled power, of any act that has a tendency to expose or
repress what is wrong in its exercise, that Governor Macquarrie
thenceforth regarded Mr. Marsden in the characters that he has
imputed to him: first, of being a secret maligner and detractor;
and, secondly, of being an open and avowed enemy. Admitting these
charges against Mr. Marsden to be true (a conclusion to which
neither my inquiries nor the evidence before me will warrant),
they are, for offences, of a nature rather personal to Governor
Macquarrie, and therefore more fitted for adjustment by private
explanation; but they could not furnish an excuse for his
frequent departure from the courtesies of language, that are
usual in all official communications, or for wounding the
feelings of an eminently useful magistrate, by casting an
unmerited reflection upon the circumstances of his
retirement.</p>
<p>In consequence of that retirement, in the month of March 1818,
a great burthen of public business fell upon Mr. Hannibal
M&#145;Arthur, and it was not till the early part of the year 1819
that any other addition was made to the number of magistrates. In
consideration of these circumstances, and of the increasing
population, it is matter of wonder, as well as of regret, that
Governor Macquarrie did not sooner avail himself of the services
of certain individuals in the colony, who would have made the
duties of the local magistracy less onerous. This subject had
been suggested, though not in an official shape, to Governor
Macquarrie, by Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde, who had further pointed
out the names of Mr. Oxley, Mr. G. Palmer, Lieut. Bell, Mr.
Harris, Sir John Jamieson, Mr. Edward Riley, and others, as
highly deserving of such an appointment.</p>
<p>Of these gentlemen, all were qualified to discharge the duties
of the magistracy; and the only one to whom the offer was made
(Mr. G. Palmer), for certain personal considerations declined it.
These gentlemen, as Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde has justly observed,
would have supplied the want of assistance that existed for some
time in the local management and correction of the convicts;
whereby the aversion of masters to the trouble and inconvenience
of resorting to their authority would have been greatly
diminished, the discipline of the convicts would have been
better. maintained, and the discretion exercised in directing
that discipline would have been more extended.</p>
<p>The expediency of adding to the number of magistrates at
Sydney was still more apparent, as after the departure of Mr. A.
Riley and Mr. Broughton, there remained only Mr. S. Lord, and
occasionally Mr. Brooks, to assist Mr. Wentworth in the weekly
duties of the police, and to discharge the still more important
duty of assistant member of the supreme court. After the
discussion that had taken place between Mr. J. H. Bent and
Governor Macquarrie, on the admission of persons who had been
convicts to practice in the courts as attorneys, the negative
that your Lordship has been pleased to give to their admission to
the courts, and the little estimation in which the character of
Mr. Lord was held, it was not without surprise that I found that
he had been one of the first persons selected by Governor
Macquarrie to sit on the bench of the supreme court with Mr.
Justice Field at Sydney on his arrival: Mr. D'Arcy Wentworth was
the other member of his court, and although the respect of Mr.
Justice Field for the governor would at that moment have
restrained him from making any objections to the nomination of
Mr. Lord, if he had even been acquainted with the circumstances
of his situation, yet he expressed to me the feelings of
indignation with which he has since regarded this appointment,
and the want of candour in Governor Macquarrie, in not sooner
making him acquainted with the nature of it.</p>
<p>It appears that Captain Piper and Dr. Harris, who were
appointed in 1819, were then resident in Sydney as well as Mr. E.
Riley, and were in every point of view more fit for the discharge
of the duties assigned to Mr. Lord. In the Windsor district,
after the resignation of the Rev. Mr. Cartwright, the magistrates
consisted of Mr. Cox, Mr. Mileham, and Captain Brabyn. The first
of these gentlemen is not wanting in sagacity, or in many of the
qualities that are essential in a magistrate who is to administer
the law in New South Wales. At Windsor he was the senior
magistrate, and assisted by Captain Brabyn and Mr. Mileham; the
former, an officer of the Veteran Companies, and the latter the
assistant surgeon on the colonial establishment. From the
observations I was enabled to make of these individuals, it is no
disparagement to them, to remark, that the addition of Lieutenant
Bell (the person recommended by the judge advocate to Governor
Macquarrie) was in every respect desirable; Lieutenant Bell now
acts in the districts of Windsor, and that part of the Richmond
district that is on the left bank of the river Nepean.</p>
<p>I have already had occasion to observe, that until the month
of March 1820, the jurisdiction of many of the magistrates was
limited by the terms of their commissions to certain districts,
the boundaries of which not having been clearly defined, some of
the magistrates had unknowingly exposed themselves to the
consequences of acting without jurisdiction.</p>
<p>This inconvenience had more than once been suggested to
Governor Macquarrie by Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde, on his arrival;
and on the appointment of Mr. Brookes to the magistracy, in the
month or August 1817, when he was appointed a magistrate of the
territory of New South Wales; but a limited district appointment
was subsequently given to Captain Brabyn, and Mr. Howe and
Lieutenant Bell were made magistrates of the county of
Cumberland, while Sir John Jamieson, Captain Piper, Mr. Harris
and Mr. Redfern, were made magistrates of the whole
territory.</p>
<p>Governor Macquarrie did not thus think it expedient or
necessary at that time to adopt the judge advocate's suggestion
generally; and the jurisdictions of the magistrates remained in
this unsettled state until the month of February 1820, when,
without any litter communication with the judge advocate, than
that which is just, now mentioned, Governor Macquarrie issued an
order in the Sydney Gazette, in which "after stating that certain
of the precepts constituting magistrates within the county of
Cumberland, had not sufficiently distinctly expressed that they
were intended for the county at large, as they should have done,
whereby a doubt had arisen about the said commissions giving a
jurisdiction beyond the limits of the particular districts
wherein the magistrates happened to reside; his excellency the
governor was pleased to notify to all persons concerned, that the
magistrates holding such commissions of the peace, were to be
deemed and considered the magistrates of the county of
Cumberland; and that in all general meetings of the magistrates,
they were to take rank and precedency according to the dates of
their commissions."</p>
<p>It is to be regretted, that the nature and infrequency of
Governor Macquarrie's official communications with Mr. Judge
Advocate Wylde, at the period of issuing this order, had not
prevented the appearance of a document, which attributed to him
and his predecessors, a want of professional attention to an
object of such importance, as the terms of magisterial
commissions. I do not think that such am intention is imputable
to Governor Macquarrie, or his secretary, for a cursory perusal
of the document itself, or those to which it referred, would
satisfy any person, that the evil arising from the ambiguity of
the terms of these commissions, and which it affected to regret,
had not rested with the person who drew them up, but with the
person who gave the directions; and Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde has
satisfactorily proved, that in his time, the commissions were
made out from, and strictly pursued, the directions of the
governor himself. It was therefore from a defective principle of
limitation, and not a defect in the terms of the commissions, or
want of technicality, that the evil consequences of ambiguity had
arisen. Thus the appointment of "the Reverend Henry Fulton,
clerk, of Castlereagh, to be justice of the peace and magistrate
for the township of Castlereagh and district of Evan, both in the
county of Cumberland", could only imply that his jurisdiction was
limited to those districts which were situated in that county.
The terms of the appointment of Mr. Cox, designated him "to be a
magistrate in the district of the Hawkesbury and county of
Cumberland"; and those again of the appointment of Mr. Hannibal
M&#145;Arthur, expressly limited his jurisdiction to the town of
Paramatta and the adjoining districts, without mentioning the
county.</p>
<p>Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde did not fail, at an early
opportunity, after the appearance of the order, to point out to
the governor, the inefficacy and incorrectness of such a
proceeding, and of conferring such new and enlarged jurisdiction
in any document less formal than that of a new commission.</p>
<p>The governor when convinced of his error, consented to adopt
the recommendation of Mr. Wylde, and a corm fission was
accordingly issued on the 31st March 1820, wherein all the
magistrates whose jurisdiction had been hitherto limited, or
supposed to be limited, to districts, received commissions for
the whole county of Cumberland.</p>
<p>Till the appearance of the order of the 3d February 1820, it
had been customary to assign rank and precedence to the
magistrates in New South Wales on public occasions, according to
the extent of their jurisdiction, and not according to the
seniority of their commissions;&mdash;thus there were magistrates
for the territory and its dependencies, magistrates for the
territory only; magistrates for the county of Cumberland, and
magistrates for the districts; but wizen, by the order of the 5th
February 1820, the magistrates of the districts were elevated to
the rank of magistrates of the county, and all were to take
precedence according to the dates of their commissions, Governor
Macquarrie yielded to the apprehensions of some of them,
respecting this sudden annihilation of their rank, and
recommended that although the rule of seniority should decide
their places upon the bench, yet that on public occasions and
ceremonies, rank should be accorded, first to those who were
magistrates of the territory and its dependencies; secondly, to
those who were magistrates of the territory only; and, thirdly,
to those who were magistrates of the county of Cumberland.</p>
<p>Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde having advised Governor Macquarrie,
in answer to an inquiry of his secretary, that such declaration
of rank could not, with any propriety, be introduced into a
precept, he proposed that a commission, including the names of
the magistrates, to whom new and enlarged jurisdiction was given,
should be published, which was accordingly done; and no reference
being made to their rank or precedence, these points continued to
be subject to the provisions of the order of the 3d February
1820, and which remaining unrepealed by any subsequent
declaration (except to magistrates of the territory and its
dependencies, only two in number, viz. Mr. J. T. Campbell and Mr.
Minchin) forms the existing rule of their present precedence.</p>

<h3>VI.<br>
<i>Control of Convicts in the Service of Settlers.</i></h3>
<p><small>THE</small> proceedings before the magistrates, against
the convicts in the employ of government and settlers, as well as
those holding tickets of leave, are taken upon oath; and rough
minutes of the evidence are made by a clerk, which are afterwards
entered in their books, together with the sentence inflicted.
These books are called records, and they appear to have been kept
with regularity, until the increase of business caused some
arrear to take place in the entries of the proceedings,
especially in those of Paramatta, Sydney and Windsor. I observed
also that the entries in the police book at Sydney, that were in
the handwriting of Mr. Robert Laythrop Murray who acted as clerk
to the magistrates, and superintendent of police, until the month
of February 1820, were very loosely made.</p>
<p>The nature of their business consists chiefly of examinations
into the reports and informations of the constables, and the
complaints made by the superintendents and the settlers against
their convict servants for neglect of work, or for petty thefts.
Capital offences, if attended with circumstances of atrocity or
violence, are referred, with the examinations, to the
consideration of the judge advocate but burglaries, robberies in
dwelling-houses, and sometimes forgeries, are tried and punished
by the magistrates, at their weekly meetings, when there is a
full attendance.</p>
<p>The returns of offences brought before the magistrates of New
South Wales, and the punishments inflicted by them, are contained
in several documents of the Appendix. They exhibit an enumeration
and description of the offences brought before the police
magistrates of Sydney, from the 8th of May 1817 to the 31st
December 1820; of the same particulars at Paramatta, from the 4th
March 1815 to the 30th September 1820; of those at Windsor, from
the 1st January 1818 to the 30th December 1820; of those in the
district of Evan, from the 23d October 1819 (the date of the
establishment of the bench there) to the 20th December 1820; and
finally, those at Bathurst, from the 6th November 1819 to the 9th
October 1820.</p>
<p>By an omission that was purely accidental, I did not receive a
similar return of the offences and punishments at Liverpool, and
I did not think it necessary to take a wider retrospect of those
at Sydney, although the books were submitted to me by Mr.
Wentworth, and appeared to have been kept with some regularity,
together with an alphabetical reference to the names of the
offending parties annexed to the annual record, which I did not
observe in any of the other books. An abstract has been made from
these several returns, showing the nature and number of the
offences committed by convicts in the different districts in each
year. The most remarkable circumstance to be collected from these
documents, is the increase of crime that appears to have taken
place in the town and districts of Sydney in the year 1820. The
amount of the convict population there, as taken by the muster of
the year 1819, was 4,231, of whom 527 were stated to be females.
In the month of September 1820, the population of these
districts, as collected by the magistrates, amounted to 4,437, of
whom only 149 were stated to be females. This great decrease in
the king le population, and the little increase in the male
convict population, is chiefly attributable to the different
manner in which the musters of the two years were taken. At the
first, and indeed at many previous musters, with a view to meet
the convenience of individuals, who had property at a distance
and lived at Sydney, the returns of their convict servants were
allowed to be made in the places where the masters either
resided, or found it most convenient to present them, instead of
being made in the districts where the convicts were actually
employed; insomuch, that the numerical population of each
district was not only in some instances swelled beyond its actual
amount, but it also happened, that double returns having been
made for the same convicts in different places, the numerical
amount of the whole convict population has been further
increased. The musters of the year 1820 were taken by the
magistrates of the districts, and it was generally requested,
that the returns of non-resident owners of estates, both of
property and convicts, should be made in the districts in which
they respectively were at the time; some difficulty occurred in
inducing the inhabitants, even of the higher classes, to conform
to this rule; and they persisted in making their returns at the
places in which they had made them before, and that they found
most convenient to themselves.</p>
<p>This circumstance, I believe to have occasioned the great
difference in the amounts of the several classes of population in
New South Wales, that is perceivable in the returns of 1819 and
1820, and which occasioned Governor Macquarrie to submit them
again to the magistrates for revision in the early part of the
year 1821. I have since received information, that an order was
issued to that effect on the 17th March 1821, but the result has
not yet reached me. Taking the numbers, however, as they appear
on the returns, and allowing that the whole convict population in
the district of Sydney, amounted in October 1819 to 4,231, the
offences committed by convicts in that district, amounted to 642,
and in the year 1820, when the convict population of the same
district, as taken by the magistrates, amounted to 4,457, the
offences committed by convicts, and punished by the magistrates
amounted to 1,317, exclusive of those of a higher nature, and
that were tried before the criminal courts. This augmentation has
principally taken place in the offences of being absent without
leave, or from the barracks, in attempts to cut out vessels, and
to rob, in disorderly conduct and intoxication, in entering
houses to steal, in the insolence of the convicts to their
overseers, in the purchase and sale of slop-clothing, in running
away, in rioting, and in stealing the property of government and
of individuals.</p>
<p>The most numerous offences of convicts committed at Paramatta,
are those of drunkenness, disobedience of orders, neglect of
work, and stealing. At Windsor and in the adjoining districts,
the offence termed bush-ranging, or absconding in the hooch, and
living upon plunder, and the robbing of orchards, are the most
prevalent and at Emu Plains, or the district of Evan, gambling,
absence from work, insolence to overseers, neglect of work and
stealing, are the most numerous offences. The difference before
alluded to, between the number of offences brought to the notice
of the police in the town of Sydney and neighbourhood, in the
years 1819 and 1820, is to be attributed to a real increase in
its convict population, that was much more considerable than that
which is stated in the muster of the latter year, and also to a
greater degree of vigilance and activity in the police of the
town, after the appointment of Mr. Minchin to the superintendence
of it.</p>
<p>I was not able to make a comparison of the number of convicts
and their offences in any years preceding 1819, as I found on
referring to the muster-books, that the number of convicts not
victualled in each district, or rather those assigned to
settlers, were not distinguished, but that they were included
under the general head of "persons not victualled", and I was not
able to learn their precise numbers from any other source.</p>
<p>In the years 1819 and 1820, however, these distinctions having
been made, it a appears that the proportion of crimes to the
convict population in the town and districts immediately
adjoining Sydney, was that of one to six; in Paramatta and the
adjoining districts, as of one to three; and at Windsor and the
adjoining districts, one in nine; in the year 1820, the offences
of the convicts in Sydney were as one to three; in Paramatta, as
one to two, and in Windsor as one to eight.</p>
<p>From this statement (subject always to the incorrectness of
the numbers of the convict population as returned in 1820), the
evil consequences of employing convicts in towns, may fairly be
collected.</p>
<p>The punishments of the convicts, inflicted by the magistrates,
consist of confinement to additional labour at periods when other
convicts are released, confinement to their barracks, solitary
confinement in the cells of the different prisons and barracks,
and flogging and removal to the Coal River, or as it is
frequently called, Newcastle.</p>
<p>A magistrate acting alone, can only order corporal punishment
to be inflicted to the amount of 50 lashes; and it was also
customary to transport convicts to the Coal River under the same
authority, for such term as his excellency the governor should
assign. I found on my visit to the Coal River, that the
commandant had no special instructions on the subject, but that
this term was considered to be that of one year, subject to be
shortened or extended according to the good behaviour of the
party under it; and had been so considered by his predecessor. I
found, however, that the indefinite nature of these sentences
produced a feeling of despondency rather than of encouragement in
the minds of the convicts who were suffering under it; and that
the circumstances of the crime were not so much considered in the
apportionment of this particular species of punishment as they
ought to have been. I recommended to Governor Macquarrie, that
the magistrates should be instructed in future to define in these
sentences, the extent of the several terms of transportation to
the Coal River, which was accordingly done; and now the
concurrence of two magistrates, at least, is required for
inflicting the punishment of transportation within the colony.
The latter restriction has been little observed in Sydney in the
Year 1820, in consequence of the insufficient attendance of the
magistrates there, and the number of prisoners whom it was
necessary to punish summarily. I also observe, that punishments
of transportation have been ordered by Mr. Cox and Captain
Brabyn, when acting alone at Windsor, on several occasions, and
for sometime after the receipt of the governor's circular
instruction.</p>
<p>It is the opinion of most of the magistrates, that the
punishment of transportation of the convicts from the settled
districts of New South Wales to the Coal River, is felt, and
sometimes dreaded by them as a punishment; and that it succeeds
in breaking dangerous and bad connections, but that it does not
operate in reforming them. It is least effectual in its operation
on the female convicts, who, from the difficulty of finding
proper places of confinement and employment at the Coal River,
and from the disproportion of the sexes there, obtain the means
of enriching themselves by the connections that they form.</p>
<p>The particular employment and management of the convicts at
the Coal River will form a separate branch of observation; at
present I will remark, that considerable inconvenience arises in
the management of that establishment, from the want of authority
in the commandant to detain the prisoners, sent to the Coal
River, under sentences of the magistrates, beyond the period of
their original or English sentences; and as sufficient care had
not been taken in the office of the governor's secretary, to
transmit a statement of that fact along with the other
particulars, the knowledge of it, as well as the detention of the
party under the colonial sentence, was left to depend upon no
better authority than his own recollection. Delay has sometimes
been experienced in obtaining these particulars from Sydney; and
from the apprehension of incurring the consequences of illegal
detention, the commandant has yielded to the importunity of the
parties with which he always was assailed, on the expiration of
their original sentences, and has sent them back to Sydney upon
the faith of their own statements.</p>
<p>I should submit that this is a defect in the state of the
colonial punishments which it is material to remedy; for it is
obvious that the tam of these, or any other punishments for time,
must be frequently lost upon the convicts who were transported
for short terms, and who commit offences in the colony,
punishable by its magistrates, about the time that their original
sentences may expire; and it will be necessary to have recourse
to some legislative enactment, by virtue of which the operation
punishments, inflicted by the magistrates in New South Wales and
Van Dieman's Land upon persons who were in the condition of
convicts at the period of sentence, may continue, notwithstanding
the expiration of their original sentences. The operation of such
an enactment would form some security against the misconduct of
convicts under short sentences, which is found to be considerably
and disadvantageously affected by their approach to a state of
freedom.</p>
<p>The limitation of corporal punishment of convicts by one
magistrate to 50 lashes, has not been strictly observed; but I am
not aware of any instances, during the last ten in which either
that power, or the power exercised by two or more magistrates in
inflicting an unlimited number, has been unduly exercised. They
have in no case exceeded 100 lashes.</p>
<p>The corporal punishments inflicted by Mr. Wentworth, during
the long period in which he held the office of superintendent of
police, have never exceeded the limited number, and have
generally fallen below it. It has been the opinion of many
persons, that he has shown too much lenity in that respect; but
he felt convinced, from his experience, that solitary
confinement, and the privation of ordinary enjoyments, was a
punishment more severely felt by convicts than the infliction of
stripes. It has been also customary to order a greater number
than were actually intended to be given, with a view to produce
intimidation, and some promise of amendment; and both at
Paramatta, Windsor, and Sydney, the corporal punishments, by
means of bribes given to the Huggers, have never been, of late
years, inflicted with severity. Those that have taken place at
Paramatta, under the authority of Mr. Marsden and Mr. Hannibal
M&#145;Arthur, have already been adverted to; and I think that the
degree, in which they exceed the punishments of the other
magistrates, is to be attributed partly to the individual
feelings that these magistrates themselves have imbibed from the
discipline of the earlier times of the colony; the necessity of
endeavouring to overawe the convicts, in a place that afforded so
much temptation to crime as the town of Paramatta, from the
uncontrolled residence of the convict women; and further, to the
want of more ample and effectual means of punishment than was
afforded either by the cells of the gaol, or time chain gangs.
The limitation, also, that was made by Governor Macquarrie's
order, in the year 1814, to the numbers in each chain gang, made
it necessary for them, as well as for other magistrates, to
resort to other modes of punishment; and to avoid, as much as
they could, the consequences of an overcrowded gaol. The chain
gangs, if kept under strict control, might be made more effective
than they are at present. At Sydney, the convicts condemned to
work in them have been employed in loading and unloading the
colonial vessels at the dock yard, and in levelling uneven
ground; at Paramatta, their employment has consisted in
performing any heavy work that was going forward, and in cleaning
the streets; and at Windsor they have been employed in the same
way. Their ration is the same as that of the convicts in the
barracks, or in the employ of government. In the gaol at Sydney,
one room and a yard, having a separate access to a back street,
is appointed for the chain gang. In this room they dress their
rations and sleep; and two convicts of the gang are allowed to
attend and assist them in cooking and fetching wood and water,
and keeping their room clean. Military guard beds have been
placed in it, but they were generally destroyed or mutilated by
the men themselves, through wanton mischief, as well as the the
flagged floors on which they stand. Some of the convicts bring
bedding with them into the gaol, and they gamble with each other
for the use of it, as well as for their rations. The hours of
work are the same as those of the other convicts; and the only
difference is, that of working in chains separately, and
sometimes together. The chain gangs at Paramatta have likewise a
separate room in the gaol there, but it affords no effectual
separation from the other convicts; and it has been of late very
much crowded with prisoners. At Windsor, the accommodation
afforded in the new gaol admits of greater separation; and a
room, in which their food is prepared for them, has been lately
added. Both at this town and at Paramatta the chain gangs are
made to attend church on the Sundays, which is not the case at
Sydney. Their dress has latterly consisted of party-coloured
jackets and trowsers, to distinguish them from other convicts,
and in pursuance of a general order of Governor Macquarrie,
issued in the year 1814.</p>
<p>In the hours of work, the chain gangs at Sydney are more
separated from the population of the town than those at Paramatta
and Windsor; but their association in one room in the gaol, with
no other control than that of an overseer who lives in the yard,
encourages their disposition to gambling and mischief.</p>
<p>Quarterly returns of the offences and punishments inflicted by
the magistrates, were required to be made to Governor Macquarrie
since the year 1814, in pursuance of his order that has been
before referred to; but I found that in the Windsor district this
practice had latterly not been observed.</p>
<p>The regulation itself was highly useful; and if correctly
made, and accompanied by a particular description of the several
convicts that had been brought before the magistrates, would,
when reduced to an alphabetical list, have furnished to Governor
Macquarrie the safest guide in the future distribution of tickets
of leave and emancipations, and have formed the best check upon
the applications that are made for them. In the form in which
these returns are made at present, no distinction is noted of
offences of convicts who are in the service of government, and of
those in the service of settlers; and none has been made in those
of the Appendix, except in the returns from Paramatta, between
the 24th January 1818 and the 30th September 1820; neither is any
notice taken of the length of their sentences, nor the ships in
which they came into the country, observations which are
absolutely necessary, as points of future reference, to fix the
identity of the convict when he becomes an applicant for
indulgence.</p>
<p>The reports made from the criminal courts are equally
deficient in giving these particulars, by which the means of
forming a comparative judgment of the character and conduct of
the different descriptions of convicts transported to the colony,
is altogether lost.</p>
<p>It was the general opinion in New South Wales, that although
the state of crime in the convict and general population had
neither exceeded the proportionate augmentation that had taken
place in it, or had been marked with such characters of atrocity
and desperation as had distinguished the earlier periods of the
colony, yet that the labouring classes of the convicts were not
under such good control as formerly, and that although they were
better fed, yet that their labour was not so severe.</p>
<p>These circumstances were more particularly observed by the
older inhabitants of the colony, both by the class that had
suffered, and by those that had profited by them. The character
of the population, at those periods, had also much influence upon
the state of discipline. The only distinctions that then
prevailed in the condition of the inhabitants, consisted of that
of free persons and convicts; and in the former (consisting of
civil or military, or as it frequently happened, a compound of
both) the convicts saw only a combination of physical and moral
strength, and a monopolizing enjoyment of civil benefits, that
inspired them with fear and with obedience; all external marks of
deference and respect that the free people could devise were
demanded and enforced from those of the convict classes. They are
still required to be paid to civil and military officers, but not
to persons who have not that rank.</p>
<p>The feelings of the individuals, who took a leading part in
the government that immediately preceded that of Governor
Macquarrie, and who had co-operated in the violent suspension and
expulsion of Governor Bligh, strongly partook of the spirit by
which the superiority of the free population over the convicts
had been maintained: severity of discipline in the labouring
class of convicts, and a distant and haughty demeanour towards
those who had lately emerged from that class, were the characters
by which their short administration was marked. Since that period
an intermediate class has arisen and become numerous, consisting
either of the lower classes of settlers who came free, and who do
not partake the same sentiments, and of persons whose sentences
of transportation have expired, or who have received
emancipations and pardons. To many of these persons convict
servants have been assigned, without a sufficient attention to
the superiority that it is so essential to preserve in the
relation of master and servant, many of them being mere tenants,
although they are described in the returns as landholders, and
some of them only holding tickets of leave. In this description
of persons, it is, that Mr. Cox, a gentleman much distinguished
for experience and sagacity, has observed a want of authority
over their convict servants, and an unwillingness to appear
against them, arising from sympathy with a condition that was
once their own, that tends to relax the severity of discipline,
and to defeat the efforts of the magistrates to maintain it.</p>
<p>As the population of New South Wales has, until lately, been
virtually limited to the occupation of a small tract of land that
between the Blue Mountains and the sea, and nearly encircled by
the river Nepean, and as few temptations to plunder existed in
the tracts contiguous to these boundaries, excepting those that
were afforded by the wild cattle in the cow pastures, the offence
of bush-ranging, or continued absence in the woods, has not of
late been common. Instances have occurred of the departure of
convicts for the purpose of traversing the country with a view to
escape of the escape of some from Newcastle, sent thither for
punishment, and their wandering and temporary existence in the
vicinity of Windsor; and latterly, a few instances of escape from
the road parties to the districts of Liverpool and Bathurst; but
there has been no systematic, continued or combined effort of
desperate convicts to defy the attempts of the local government
in New South Wales, or to subsist by plunder, such as have
existed until a very late period in Van Dieman's Land. The supply
of animal food, moreover, in the district of Cumberland, had
continued to be abundant until the month of October of the year
1819; and the offences of cattle and sheep stealing had not then
been common, with the exception of the attempts before alluded
to, against the herds of wild cattle in the cow pastures.</p>
<p>From the want of means, that has before been adverted to, for
making individual reference to the names of convicts in the books
of the governor's secretary, as well as in those of the principal
superintendent of convicts at Sydney, I found it impossible to
ascertain what degree of influence the different condition of the
convicts transported to New South Wales might have had upon their
conduct there, or the greater propensity of one clam than of the
others, to commit offences. I could only, therefore, resort to
the opinions of the best informed of the inhabitants respecting
it. I found that this was a subject upon which very few of them
had ever bestowed any consideration; for the selection of the
convicts on their arrival, by the settlers, as well as that which
is made by the magistrates, proceeds altogether upon their
capacity for labour, and not upon any retrospect of their former
lives or characters, or the length of their sentences; and upon
the same principle, the dismissal of a convict, either for crime
or neglect, by one master, forms no objection to his admission
into the service of another. The general opinion appeared to be,
that the period of seven years, reduced as it frequently is by
service on board the hulks and the voyage, was too short for the
purposes of punishment to the labouring classes of the convicts;
that it led them to indulge prematurely the desire of assuming
the condition of settlers, and relaxed those feelings of habitual
caution and obedience, and that respectful demeanour, for which
those who had arrived in the early periods of the colony, and had
endured its rigorous discipline, were and are yet
distinguished.</p>
<p>The shortness of this term of seven years, being still farther
abridged by the expectations of remission of punishment, that
have assumed more the character of claims than of rewards, since
the promulgation of Governor Macquarrie's orders of the year
1813, inspires the convict transported to New South Wales, for
that term, with a stronger wish to return to England, than to
remain in the colony. This feeling is also more prevalent amongst
the convicts whose criminal habits are confirmed, and whose only
view in returning to England is that of indulging them, than
amongst those who have been the victims of a single error, or of
casual but strong temptation. To this last description of
convicts the transportation to New South Wales, even for seven
years, holds out an opportunity of retrieving that error, which
it will be rarely their lot to find at home; and it affords a
shelter from reproach, from which, I have heard many of them
declare, they were most anxious to be released, and which they
were determined never again to encounter. With such feelings, men
transported for short terms may be made good servants, and may
afterwards become good settlers. To this class of convicts,
which, in respect to the term of sentence, is a numerous one, it
must be admitted that the prospect afforded by transportation to
New South Wales, is more one of emigration than of punishment. In
the convicts transported for 14 years, and for life, there is a
natural disposition to remain in the colony; and if their
previous state of discipline in it were prolonged, or rendered
more severe, and, above all, if it were adapted to their future
state of existence in the colony, it might have the effect of
creating industrious habits, accompanied with a hope of ultimate
reward, that is yet consistent with a long state of servitude and
bondage. This hope, however, should be directed to the colony,
and not to Great Britain; and all the circumstances that tend to
revive or to cherish that hope, must be carefully kept out of
view.</p>
<p>The class of convicts transported for forgery, and for
uttering forged notes, (of late become so numerous, and generally
for 14 years and for life), has at all times given the greatest
embarrassment to the colonial government, as well as to their
employers. They generally consist of men who have been little
accustomed to laborious employments or to field labour, of
printers and compositors in printing offices, and of the lower
order of mercantile clerks. If they are found to possess any
clerical skill, they are employed in the commissariat department,
and by the magistrates and superintendents; and when assigned to
settlers, are most frequently employed as teachers to the younger
branches of poor families, who are at too great a distance from
the public schools to attend them. The effect of their employment
in towns, as clerks, has been already observed upon; and it
appeared to me to be so destructive of all notion or feeling of
punishment, as well as of those distinctions between the free and
the convict classes, that were the essential characteristics of
the early, discipline of the colony, that notwithstanding the
additional expense that the subsistence of these persons might
occasion to the crown, I do not hesitate to recommend, that they
should either be subsisted and employed on light work, or, at all
events, that they should be banished from the town of Sydney into
the country, where, if their condition be a little elevated above
that of their fellows, it may be solely imputed to their superior
acquirements, and where they may have no temptation to indulge
their vanity, nor to outrage public feeling by their ostentatious
appearance.</p>
<p>The employment of men convicted for forgery, as schoolmasters
for the children of settlers, cannot be contemplated without
apprehension; but whether from habit or necessity, I found these
apprehensions had subsided, even in quarters where they might
have been supposed most strongly to have prevailed. Thus Edward
Eager, who was transported to New South Wales for life for
forgery, was on the recommendation of Mr. Marsden, received into
the family of the Rev. Mr. Cartwright, at Windsor, and became the
instructor of his children; and, latterly, I observed, that the
school of Lawrence Halloran, who, for one short period, was in
the degraded character of assigned servant to Mr. S. Ford, and
afterwards received a ticket of leave, was preferred by the
principal inhabitants of Sydney, amongst whom was Mr. Judge
Advocate Wylde, to another, but more remote establishment, that
was forming under the direction of the Rev. Mr. Reddell.</p>
<p>Another and striking instance of insensibility to the
consequences of such superintendence, occurred in the inquiry
that took place before the magistrates at Par mat into the
conduct of Mr. R. Fitzgerald; upon that occasion, it appeared
that his eldest son, a youth of 16 years of age, was allowed to
be instructed by his convict clerk, in the suspicious and
dangerous art of imitating the hand-writing of individuals. This
fact was stated without any hesitation or regret by Mr.
Fitzgerald, his father, to the magistrates, in the course of
their inquiry into the authenticity of certain returns that had
been copied by his son, and transmitted to Governor Macquarrie.
The statement fortunately attracted the notice of Mr. Justice
Field, who did not allow it to pass without a suitable
rebuke.</p>
<p>Considering the nature and extent of the paper circulation
that subsisted in New South Wales, until the year 1816; the
payments that have been made by the commissariat department, for
the annual supplies of meat and grain to the public stores; and
of the issues of their own notes by Mr. Deputy Commissary General
Drennan and the bank of New South Vales; the prosecutions and
convictions for forgery have not been so numerous as might have
been expected. In the year 1811, the crime of forgery was
punished by the execution of two convicts; and it appears to have
been checked by that means. In the year 1815, it was again very
successfully and extensively practised by a convict named Lycett,
a clerk employed in a subordinate situation in the police
department. This man had been transported to the colony for
uttering forged notes, and was always distinguished by his skill
in the arts of imitation. He was convicted and transported to
Newcastle, from whence, at the recommendation of Captain Wallis,
the commandant, and in consideration of his having painted an
altar-piece for the church at that settlement, he was permitted
to return to Sydney, where he now continues to exercise his art,
and to be employed by individuals. By their liberality he has
been preserved from resorting again to criminal pursuits; but his
habits of intoxication are fixed and incurable.</p>
<p>The convicts in the employ of government, and in that of
settlers, are at all times allowed to marry; and a sense of the
advantages arising from this permission, has induced Governor
Macquarrie to give a very general sanction to them, as well as an
encouragement, by conferring tickets of leave on those who
entered into the marriage state with the means and inclination to
support themselves.</p>
<p>It is the opinion of the Rev. Mr. Marsden, that marriage, even
in New South Wales, operates as a corrective of vicious
propensities; and in that point of view is to be encouraged, by
giving as early permission as possible to the wives of convicts
to follow their husbands to the colony, to prevent the latter
from forming new connections there. Great difficulty is found in
distinguishing between the real and pretended motives for
applications of convicts to be married in the colony; and no
doubt is entertained, that the marriage obligation is contracted
for the purpose of making an alteration in the civil condition of
the parties. This alteration is certainly more abrupt than is
consistent with a just notion of punishment; but, as long as the
punishment of the female convicts consisted of detention and
labour in the factory at Paramatta, it was better policy to give
them a chance of correcting their morals by early marriage, than
to continue that detention with the certainty of more deeply
depraving them in their single state.</p>
<p>Instances very frequently occur of the marriage of convicts
with emancipated convict women, and with young women who are born
in the colony, to which the latter are as much prompted by their
early dispositions to marriage, as by the associations into which
they are led, from the admission of the convict labourers to the
houses and tables of the lower classes of emancipated convict
settlers, to whom they are assigned. The marriage of the
native-born youths with female convicts are very rare; a
circumstance that is attributable to the general disinclination
to early marriage that is observable amongst them, and partly to
the abandoned and dissolute habits of the female convicts, but
chiefly to a sense of pride in the native-born youths,
approaching to contempt for the vices and depravity of the
convicts, even when manifested in the persons of their own
parents.</p>
<p>The applications of male and female convicts to be allowed to
marry are addressed to the chaplains of the districts, who make
inquiries where they can, and sometimes make a reference to the
principal superintendent of convicts, for information of their
condition. A list of these applications is submitted to the
governor, with such remarks upon the Condition or circumstances
of the parties applying, as may have occurred to the chaplains,
or come to their knowledge, on the first Monday of each month.
This regulation took place in the month of October 1816, to
remedy some inconvenience of the former practice, that consisted
only of transmitting to the governor certificates signed by the
chaplains, that the banns had been published. It was alleged that
sufficient time was not given by that means for inquiry into the
condition of the parties; and it was certainly desirable, that if
reference or appeal was made to the authority or the discretion
of the governor, that it should be made before, rather than after
the publication of the banns three times in the church. By the
new regulation, more time is required from the first period of
application for marriage, to the solemnization of it than is
always consistent with the views of the parties; and where they
live at a distance from the chaplains, it may operate as a
discouragement to marriage. By the correspondence that took place
between the governor and Mr. Marsden upon the subject, the former
was of opinion, that it was better to incur that risk than afford
an inducement to hasty and injudicious connections, by limiting
the period of objection to the ordinary one of three weeks; and
in this opinion I concur.</p>
<p>As no information is transmitted in the hulk lists, of the
single or married state of the convicts, and when there are so
many motives in New South Wales for concealing it, it is very
difficult, almost impossible, to ascertain it.</p>
<p>Two affecting consequences of a second marriage, contracted in
New South Wales during the life-time of a first and absent
husband, are mentioned by Mr. Marsden in his evidence; and he
states such marriages to have been of frequent occurrence. These
consequences may be greatly obviated, by requiring the gaolers of
the different prisons in England to communicate the information
that they may receive respecting the single or married condition
of the convicts sent to the hulks; and by adding these
particulars, corrected by subsequent inquiry there, to the
communications transmitted in the hulk lists. A much better
chance will then exist of obtaining a true statement, when the
advantages attending the marriage state in New South Wales are
unknown or unperceived, than when they form, as they certainly do
in that colony, a very strong temptation to imposture.</p>
<p>This disposition is further prompted by an idea that was
represented to me to have prevailed amongst the convicts, that
capital conviction followed by sentence of death, afterwards
commuted to transportation for life, operated as a dissolution of
the marriage contract; and it may therefore be an additional
reason for disappointing, by early inquiry, any undue
expectations to which such an idea must give me.</p>
<p>The power of assigning female convicts from the factory to
individuals, has been intrusted to the acting magistrates at
Paramatta, Mr. Marsden and Mr. Hannibal M&#145;Arthur. The conduct of
the females in service, is the subject of frequent complaint to
the magistrates, and in that case they are returned to the
factory.</p>
<p>The connections that they form in service, and in the families
of the settlers, end either in marriage or in their return to
Paramatta, where the offspring of their illicit intercourse is
maintained at the expense of the crown, in return for their own
labour. As long as the great disproportion continues to exist
between the male and female population in New South Wales, the
temptations to illicit intercourse in both, and all the crimes
that are committed for the purpose of supporting it, must be
expected to prevail. Female convict servants will continue to be
seduced from the houses of their masters, and will find asylums
in the houses of single men, under the pretence of service; and
the still greater evil will continue, of the seduction of the
native-born young women by the male convicts, and their marriage
with them. It is not therefore without serious apprehension, that
the most intelligent persons in the colony have contemplated any
reduction in the number of female convicts to be transported
thither in future; and have been led to consider, that any
additional facilities given by government to the return of those
whose terms of service have expired, independent of such as they
may acquire by their own good conduct in the colony, would
occasion an additional expense to government, and operate as an
encouragement to profitable prostitution: particular exceptions
no doubt will occur, where it may be advisable to afford these
facilities to married women, who have left families in England;
but to these, even in the present state of the colony, them exist
such ample opportunities, by good conduct in service, of
realizing the means of return, that if their absence from their
native country, and their punishment, be prolonged, it may
without injustice be attributed to themselves. One application
only for the means of returning was made to me by any female who
had been a convict, and her case was not entitled to any
consideration.</p>
<p>For the general prevention and pursuit of crimes, or for the
control of the convicts, it did not appear to me that the rural
police, or that of the towns of New South Wales, were as
efficient and active as the colony required. The chief constables
of the districts, with the exception of Mr. Francis Oakes, whose
attention was much confined to the town of Paramatta, were not
men of personal activity; and the chief constable of Sydney was
too much advanced in years, and though respectable in character,
not sufficiently literate, to perform some of the most important
duties with which he was charged. Each of the two chief
constables of Windsor and Paramatta received salaries of
50<i>l</i>. from the police fund, and fees attached to their
office. The chief constable of Sydney received a salary of
60<i>l</i>. The allowance of a district constable in the country,
consists of the assignment to him of a government convict, who is
victualled from the king's store; the allowance of rations for
himself and his family, and two suits of slops per annum, which
have always been in arrear, or very irregularly issued.</p>
<p>The allowance to the constables at Sydney has been larger than
to those in the country, or at Paramatta. The salaries of each of
the six district constables at Sydney amounted to 15<i>l</i>. per
annum, and have latterly been raised to 20<i>l</i>. They have an
allowance of a ration and a half for themselves, which was
further increased to a double ration, and rations for their
families, and slops, which, like the same allowance to other
constables, have been in arrear, or irregularly supplied. The
petty constables receive an allowance of a ration and half for
themselves, and sometimes for their families, and double suits of
slops, but no pay. The district constables in the country were,
until the month of April 1820, appointed by the magistrates of
the different districts; but they are now recommended to the
governor, and he appoints them: they are generally selected from
the class of settlers who had become free by service or pardon,
and at Sydney a few of them had been formerly soldiers of the
l02d and 73d regiments.</p>
<p>The duties of the district constables, consist of reporting
and giving information to the chief constable and magistrates of
all occurrences in their districts, and attending the bench of
magistrates with prisoners for examination, and taking the
musters on Sundays. The petty constables in the towns act as
watchmen at night, and call the hour as they go their rounds; and
in the day-time are required to be in readiness to convey letters
or orders: this duty has of late very much increased, and has
been allowed to interfere too much with the performance of
others, of a more local and important kind.</p>
<p>From the inconsiderable allowances that the petty constables
receive, a great difficulty has been found in prevailing upon men
of good character to accept the situation. Many of them hold
tickets of leave, and some are convicts, selected on account of
their character. In all of these selections numerous
disappointments occur, for constables have been frequently
dismissed, either for drunkenness or inattention, to their duty,
and unwillingness to perform it, though not for positive
connivance in crime.</p>
<p>On the 20th May 1820, the names and districts of the
constables of every description in the colony of New South Wales,
were published by order of the governor, in the Sydney Gazette;
and it appeared that at Sydney there was one chief constable, six
district constables, with 35 assigned to them, 13 town
constables, eight to the gaol, three assigned to the judge
advocate, and one as an office-keeper, and one to Mr. J. Field;
one constable was also assigned to the establishment at Grose
Farm, and one for the protection of the lumber-yard at Sydney. It
has always been customary to assign constables for the nightly
protection of the government house, and residences at Sydney,
Paramatta and 'Windsor; and also to certain of the civil officers
at Sydney. A constable was attached to my own residence in the
town of Sydney, although it had also the protection of a military
sentinel towards the street; but it was not considered safe,
unless it was protected on both sides. At the later periods of my
residence at Sydney, a constable was appointed to act as a
messenger, whom I was under the necessity of dismissing, for
gross neglect and intoxication, in the performance of' a duty of
some importance, with which he had been specially charged. The
assignment of three constables to the judge advocate, and one as
an office keeper, which was only made at a late period, appears
to exceed that of any other civil officer on the establishment,
and may admit of reduction to two. But I am not aware that the
number of the constables in the whole establishment at Sydney can
be reduced, until their efficiency in point of character is
increased.</p>
<p>The establishment at Paramatta consisted of one chief
constable, and 17 town constables. That at Windsor, of one chief
constable and 15 town constables; and that of Liverpool of one
chief constable and three town constables. In the districts of
New South Wales, there were 41 district constables, who were also
pound keepers. Three petty constables in the district of Airds,
and three in those of Bringelly and Cooke. These are necessarily
attached to the service of the different magistrates. Previous to
my departure I did not fail to call Governor Macquarrie's
attention to the obvious expediency of paying all the constables
with more regularity than had hitherto been observed; and he
promised to attend to that suggestion.</p>
<p>The manner of distributing the convicts in Van Dieman's Land
to the settlers, and the numbers so distributed, have already
been observed.</p>
<p>Until the end of the year 1819, they continued to be in demand
both at Port Dalrymple and Hobart Town. The regulations
respecting their labour and their food, payment of wages and
clothing, are the same as those that prevail in New South Wales;
but the convicts generally partook more largely of animal food in
Van Dieman's Lind, and received larger and more frequent rations
of mutton, and less of pork. Their clothing, on the other hand,
was neither so good in kind, nor had been so regularly supplied;
and the prices were considerably higher than those at Sydney. The
cost of a winter and summer suit of clothing for a convict is
estimated at 6<i>l</i>. 7<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>.; his subsistence at
11<i>l</i>. 2<i>s</i>.; and these, with his wages, of 7<i>l</i>.
make an annual charge of 24<i>l</i>. <i>9</i>s. 7<i>d</i>. to a
settler for every convict assigned to him.</p>
<p>This estimate is framed upon the regulated ration, consisting
of seven pounds of fresh meat, and eight pounds of wheat per
week, but as this quantity is generally increased by the settlers
to 10 pounds of meat and one peck of wheat per week, the cost of
maintenance is raised to 17<i>l</i>. 17<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per
man, making, with his wages and clothing, an annual charge of
31<i>l</i>. 5<i>s</i>.</p>
<p>I observed that a great many of the convicts in Van Dieman's
Land wore jackets and trowsers of the kangaroo skin, and
sometimes caps of the same material, which they obtain from the
stock-keepers who are employed in the interior of the country.
The labour of several of them differs, in this respect, from that
of the convicts in New South Wales, and is rather pastoral than
agricultural; permission having been given, for the last five
years, to the settlers to avail themselves of the ranges of open
plains and rallies, that lie on either side of the road leading
from Austin's Ferry to Launceston, a distance of 120 miles, their
flocks and herds have been committed to the care of convict
shepherds and stock-keepers, who are sent to these cattle ranges,
distant sometimes 30 or 40 miles from their master's estates.</p>
<p>The boundaries of these tracts are described in the tickets of
occupation by which they are held, and which are made renewable
every year, on payment of a fee to the lieutenant-governor's
clerk. One or more convicts are stationed on them, to attend to
the flocks and cattle, and are supplied with wheat, tea and
sugar, at the monthly visits of the owner. They are allowed the
use of a musket and a few cartridges to defend themselves against
the natives; and they have also dogs, with which they hunt the
kangaroos, whose flesh they eat, and dispose of their skins to
persons passing from Hobart Town to Launceston, in exchange for
tea and sugar. They thus obtain a Their supply of food, and
sometimes succeed in cultivating a few vegetables. Their
habitations are made of turf and thatched, as the bark of the
dwarf eucalyptus, or gum tree of the plains, and the interior, in
Van Dieman's Land, is not of sufficient expanse to form covering
or shelter.</p>
<p>The regulations that have been adopted for the control of the
convicts in Van Dieman's Land, are stated at length in the
evidence of Mr. Humphreys, the police magistrate at Hobart Town,
to whom much credit is due for the diligence and correctness with
which he has carried into effect the several orders of
Lieutenant-governor Sorrell, his assumption of the command in Van
Dieman's Land, on the 9th of April 1817, he found both the
settlements at Hobart Town, and at Port Dalrymple, as well as all
the intermediate and neighbouring districts of the island, in a
state of alarming subjection to the parties of bush-rangers, who
had for three years preceding, bid defiance to all efforts of the
local government to subdue them.</p>
<p>Mr. Humphreys has traced their origin, to the necessities of
the settlement, and the scarcity of food with which it had to
contend, at its first establishment under Lieutenant-colonel
Collins. The convicts assigned to the military officers,
according to the custom and necessities of that day, were obliged
to furnish to their masters, and to procure for themselves, a
certain quantity of kangaroo flesh; and having first gone into
the woods for these temporary supplies of food, they gradually
acquired a knowledge of the country, and of the means of
supporting themselves in it. To this at length they were driven;
and the predatory habits of these men, who have since received
the common appellation of bush-rangers, have continued from the
year t 805, with more or less of violence and rapacity, until the
month of October in the year 1818. The relaxed state of
discipline in which the convicts were kept under the commands of
Major Murray, Colonel Geils, and Lieutenant-colonel Davey; the
little co-operation and confidence that these officers were
enabled to inspire in the settlers; the want of a criminal court
to try offenders; and lastly, the effects of a measure resorted
to by Governor Macquarrie, have all had an influence in giving
permanence to the destructive successes of the bushrangers.</p>
<p>As the nature and effects of this measure of Governor
Macquarrie, have been much relied upon by Lieutenant-colonel
Davey, in certain representations that he laid before me, and
which he informed me, had been transmitted through the Earl of
Harrowby to your Lordship, and as I found several well-informed
persons in Van Dieman's Land had imputed to the same measure, the
prolonged continuance of the mischief that it intended to
suppress, I think it necessary to make some mention of it.</p>
<p>The excesses of the bush-rangers in the neighbourhood of Port
Dalrymple, and likewise near Hobart Town, had attained their
utmost height, and most sanguinary character at the latter end of
the year 1813. They had been joined by two persons who had held
subordinate stations in the commissariat department, named Peter
Mills and George Williams; and continued a system or violent
depredation upon the houses and property of individuals of every
description. So great was the intimidation produced by their
combined efforts, that the inhabitants of several districts
abandoned their dwellings and removed for safety to the

<p>Colonel Davey had issued a proclamation offering rewards for
the apprehension of a party of nine, whose depredations had been
marked with great atrocity and cruelty; and a further reward to
any person who should give information of the assistance that it
was well known they received. This proclamation received the
sanction of Governor Macquarrie; but considering that the
circumstances of the settlement, as well as the character of
these offenders, required the application of other influence,
than that of encouragement for their apprehension, counteracted
as it was, by the fears of some of the settlers, and the
connivance of others, the governor, with the advice, as it would
appear, of Mr. Ellis Bent, issued a proclamation on the 14th May
1814, in which, after reciting the names of the several
offenders, and the outrages that they had committed, he required
them to return and surrender on or before the 1st day of December
of the same year, under pain of being considered as outlaws;
declaring further, that if they complied with the order, they
should be pardoned for all offences, that they had committed
during their absence from their homes, save and except the crime
of wilful murder.</p>
<p>The effect of this proclamation was the reverse of that which
was intended. It increased the crimes and audacity of the
bush-rangers, during the interval of six months that it allowed
them for return; they profited by the pardon by making a
temporary surrender, and then resumed their habits of plunder. It
was under the influence of these circumstances that Colonel Davey
adopted the resolution of proclaiming and continuing martial,
law, until he received an order from Governor Macquarrie to put
an end to it; disclaiming at the same time all responsibility for
a measure that was unauthorized by him, and for the adoption of
which, he rightly considered that Lieutenant-colonel Davey's
power, as lieutenant-governor, did not extend. Martial law had
been proclaimed by Lieutenant-governor Davey, in the month of May
1815, and continued until the month of October following;
although he had been apprised by Mr. Deputy Judge Advocate
Abbott, who had arrived in the settlement in the month of
February 1815, that he considered the declaration of this
measure, by him, to have been both illegal and unnecessary.</p>
<p>An address, signed by several inhabitants of Van Dieman's
Land, in favour both of the original adoption of the measure, and
its continuance, was voted to Lieutenant-governor Davey, on the
15th September 1815. Notwithstanding the number of names that
appear to this document, the proclamation of martial law was a
measure that the more prudent part of the community did not
approve. For if the capture only of the bush-rangers, or other
lawless plunderers, was the object, that object would have been
attained by an active and judicious disposal of the military
force, without any previous or subsequent reference to a military
tribunal. The want of a local criminal court was, however, the
principal justification; for when the military or the inhabitants
had been successful in apprehending the bushrangers, neither
proprietors nor witnesses could, prevailed upon to leave their
homes exposed to danger, and repair to Sydney or the purpose of
giving their testimony against them, at a great expense to
themselves, and a great detriment to their property.</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that the want of a criminal jurisdiction
in Van Dieman's Land, has been most seriously felt in these
settlements, and has contributed more than any other cause, to
afford encouragement and impunity to crime amongst all classes of
offenders.</p>
<p>The measures adopted by Lieutenant-governor Sorrell,
immediately on his arrival at Hobart Town, in the month of May
1817, were of the most judicious kind. By a spirited exposition,
of the circumstances of their situation, he succeeded, in at last
awakening amongst those who wished to save their property from
plunder, a sense of the necessity of co-operation in measures of
self defence, and of combination against their common enemies: a
liberal subscription was made by the inhabitants to enable the
lieutenant-governor to carry these views into effect; and large
rewards were offered for the apprehension of six of the most
desperate of the banditti. By denouncing those who were known and
detected in affording them aid, by sending military assistance to
the support of those who were attacked, and by establishing a
system of vigilant control over the removal of convicts from one
district to another, he succeeded in checking the frequent
enterprizes of the bush-rangers. Many of them, however, still
continued to maintain themselves, and were at length reduced by
the spirited pursuit and exertions of a detachment of the 46th
regiment, or by the most cruel and treacherous assassinations of
each other, perpetrated from a fear of being betrayed, and for
the purpose of obtaining a share of the promised reward.</p>
<p>The celebrated leader of the principal party, Michel Howe,
after surrendering himself to the lieutenant-governor on an
assurance of present safety, and a recommendation to Governor
Macquarrie, escaped from the gaol at Hobart Town, where he
attempted, in concert with a convict named Reagent, at that time
servant to the deputy judge advocate, Mr. Abbott, to make his
escape in an American vessel. Disappointed in this attempt, he
returned to his former mode of life, was apprehended a second
time and secured; but by means of a sudden and dexterous exertion
of strength, and a concealed knife that he had retained, he
stabbed both his attendants, one of whom was the most guilty
companion of his former exploits. Having thus disengaged himself,
he again repaired to the woods, where he subsisted for some time,
but with difficulty, on account of the loss of his pistols that
had been wrested from him; and from the horror and detestation
with which he at length began to be regarded. Impelled by the
desire of obtaining a supply of ammunition, he was at last
induced to enter a hut, in which a soldier of the 48th regiment,
and a convict, emancipated for former services of the same kind,
suddenly fell upon him, and after a fierce encounter killed
him.</p>
<p>This event did not take place till the month of October 1818,
and although it may be considered as the termination of the
system of plunder that had so much alarmed the settlement for the
space of four years, yet instances have occurred since, and to a
very late period, of extensive robberies of sheep, as well as
sudden entries of houses, and the forcible seizure of
property.</p>
<p>During my residence at George Town, one of the most desperate
offenders at that place, having seized some arms and gunpowder,
betook himself to the woods, where being joined by four others,
they committed several daring robberies at the farms of settlers
between George Town and Launceston; they were pursued, and after
being out for five weeks in the woods, the leader, Hector
M'Donald, was shot by two convicts who had been sent in pursuit
of them; and another was shot by one of the soldiers of the 48th
regiment; the remaining three were tried by the magistrates at
Launceston, and were punished by flogging and transportation.</p>
<p>In carrying into effect his regulations for controlling the
convicts, Lieutenant-governor Sorrell had at first to contend
with much opposition on the part of the settlers. The majority of
them consisted of those who had been removed from Norfolk Island
on the evacuation of that settlement, and who had been sent
thither for offences committed in New South Wales. The system of
never allowing a convict to come to Hobart Town without a pass,
of obliging him to show it to the magistrate of police there, and
to take one from the same officer on his return to his district,
where it was again to be exhibited to a constable, for the
purpose of being returned to Hobart Town, to show that thee
bearer had not deviated from his time or destination, is found to
have afforded an useful check both upon the convicts and the
lower order of settlers, who, when they cannot afford to give
employment to a convict for the whole of his time, allow him to
search for it elsewhere.</p>
<p>The practice of mustering the convicts on Sundays has been
also found very useful in the settlements near Hobart Town,
principally because the reports of the musters were transmitted
with regularity to Hobart Town, from those districts in which no
magistrate resided; and that the two magistrates specially
charged with the superintendence of the Sunday muster, Mr.
Humphreys at Hobart Town, and Mr. Gordon at Pittwater, were very
attentive in exacting its regular execution.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the number of magistrates in Van Dieman's Land
has been very small; and only one of them, Mr. Gordon, resided in
the country.</p>
<p>Out of those persons whom I noticed amongst the free settlers
at and near Hobart Town in the year 1820, I do not think that
Lieutenant-governor Sorrell could have recommended any one for
the office of magistrate that was competent to perform its
duties, although he was fully impressed himself with the
importance of augmenting their numbers. The distance at which the
inhabitants of the settled districts are thus placed from any
authority, debars them almost of the means of punishing their
convict servants, who know how to take advantage of the
difficulty. They have also, as has been observed before,
consisted of the worst description of men that had been confined
in the gaol gang at Sydney, or that had returned from the Coal
River. In either case, whenever it was considered necessary to
remove them permanently, for the purpose of breaking their old
connections, such convicts were sent to Hobart Town; and this
circumstance, together with the generally low description of the
settlers in Van Dieman's Land, will account for the greater
prevalence of crime, as well as its unchecked success. The
continuance of the predatory and wandering habits of the convicts
who so long infested the country is, in some measure, to be
attributed to the dispersion of the flocks and herds of the
settlers over so great an extent of country, the knowledge of it
that is thus obtained by the stock-keepers, and the unprotected
state in which the herds and flocks are left by their owners.
This fact was reluctantly acknowledged by many of the inhabitants
of Van Dieman's Land; for it is principally to this facility of
obtaining pasturage, that the great and rapid increase has taken
place in their sheep and cattle.</p>
<p>At Launceston, and in those districts that have been
distinguished by the general name of Port Dalrymple, and that are
situated on the northern coast of Van Dieman's Land, the control
of the convicts in the employment of the settlers, has been less
vigorous and regular than in those on the southern coast, that
form the county of Buckingham.</p>
<p>The removal of the residence of the commandant
(Lieutenant-colonel Cimiti&egrave;re) to George Town, together
with a considerable portion of the military force, has both
contracted the means of control at Launceston, and made the few
civil officers who are stationed there, less vigilant in applying
them. Three magistrates, however, reside at Launceston: Mr.
Archer, who held the situation of clerk in charge in the
commissariat department Mr. Cox, and Captain Barclay. The chief
constable, Mr. Massey, paid very little attention to the business
of his office, and was very desirous of retiring from it, as he
found that his absence from his property in the country was the
cause of serious loss to him. The magistrates were occupied
largely in agriculture, or in trade, and with the exception of
Mr. Archer, did not command the personal respect of the
inhabitants. There were not however any other persons that could
have been selected for the purpose. The conduct of one of these,
Captain Barclay, was particularly brought to my notice. A female
convict cohabited with him at Launceston, and in consideration of
that circumstance was, with others in the same situation, excused
from attendance at church. The notoriety of the cause of this
exemption had produced its natural effect upon the minds of other
prisoners, and they justified their own absence from church by
the interested connivance of their superiors in the breach of
that regulation. Another instance of the same kind had taken
place during the residence of Mr. Deputy Assistant Commissary
General Walker at Launceston. A female convict was not only
permitted to live with him, but he appeared with her in the town
of Launceston, and in a manner that evinced the terms upon which
they lived. This occurrence took place during the residence of
Lieutenant-colonel Cimiti&egrave;re at Launceston, who
endeavoured by admonition and remonstrance with Mr. Walker, to
prevent the occurrence of such a disgraceful practice. He
expostulated with him in vain; and it was with infinite surprise
and regret, that I learnt that after the departure of Mr. Walker
for head quarters, Mr. Archer, one of the magistrates at
Launceston, had recommended the same female convict to
Lieutenant-governor Sorrell for a ticket of leave.</p>
<p>These circumstances are sufficient to show the very low state
of public morals at Launceston; and, from the information I
received, I found that a greater degree of immorality prevailed
in all the settled districts.</p>
<p>The same system of remuneration that prevails at Sydney, in
assigning convicts on the store to the different officers of
government, exists likewise at Hobart Town and Launceston; each
of the magistrates is allowed four of such men; and Major Bell
has that number in his capacity of magistrate, and two more as
acting engineer.</p>
<p>With the exception of Mr. Gordon, and Mr. Deputy Judge
Advocate Abbott, the magistrates allow the greatest number of the
men assigned to them to make their payments in wheat, in the
articles in which they deal, or in money; the last is the least
frequent mode of payment, and the least regular. Where the
convicts who are thus allowed do not live upon the estate, or in
the houses of the magistrates, the same consequences follow as in
New South Wales and the same observations that applied to the
system of remuneration there, are applicable in Van Dieman's
Land, except that the control over the convicts, and the
knowledge of their places of residence, is much more precisely
traced and fixed by Mr. Humphreys, the police magistrate, than it
is by the principal superintendent of convicts at Sydney. At
Launceston I found that the system equally prevailed; but as the
commandant, Lieutenant-colonel Cimiti&egrave;re, and Lieutenant
Leroux, of the 48th regiment, who was appointed to act as
coroner, and Lieutenant Vandermeulen, the inspector of works,
were not possessed of farms, they necessarily gave permission to
their men to work where they could find employment, and received
wheat from them in return.</p>
<p>It had been repeatedly charged by Mr. Leith, the
superintendent of works at George Town, that the several
commandants at that station had selected some of the best workmen
as their assigned convicts; and I found that a rough carpenter
had been for six months assigned to Lieutenant-colonel
Cimiti&egrave;re. This is a species of appropriation, that forms
one of the principal advantages derived from the remote or
immediate superintendence of the convicts; and as the difference
between a skilful and unskilful labourer constitutes the
difference of loss or gain to the settler, so is the same degree
of interest felt, and the same distinction attempted to be made;
by those to whom they are assigned for remuneration; the only
difference between the two cases being, that in one, the settler
has no power or means of selection, and in the other, many
circumstances combine to give that power, and to conceal its
exercise.</p>
<p>The manner in which Lieutenant-colonel Cimiti&egrave;re
disposed of the produce of his men's labour, will be noticed when
I come to consider the information that I received, and the
evidence that I took upon that subject, in conjunction with
Lieutenant-governor Sorrell. The returns that were made to me of
offences committed at Hobart Town, embrace a period of 10 years;
but those only that are subsequent to the month of April 1817,
are certified by Mr. Humphreys, the police magistrate. As the
proceedings were not always taken down in writing until after
that time, nor the records in his custody, or in such a state
that an accurate transcript or abstract could be made from them,
I cannot rely with confidence upon the records of offences that
are of an earlier date than the month of April 1817; an abstract,
however, has been taken of the offences punished by the
magistrates during the period of to years. In consequence of the
expense that has attended the transmission of prisoners and
witnesses from Van Dieman's Land to Sydney, all offences
committed by convicts there, except murder, were ordered to be
tried and punished by the magistrates. And for the purpose of
better preserving the peace, a practice has been beneficially
introduced of binding over, for a certain period, free persons
charged on oath, and credible testimony, with having committed
breaches of the peace, and of reviving the recognizances, if it
should appear to the magistrates that there was a necessity for
such a measure. In cases of felony and misdemeanor likewise, a
criminal jurisdiction was exercised by the magistrates over free
persons, from the year 1810 till the arrival of Mr. Deputy Judge
Advocate Abbott when, with the exception of taking securities for
breaches of the peace, and fining for drunkenness, the offences
of free persons were referred to the cognizance of the criminal
courts at Sydney.</p>
<p>The extent of punishments inflicted by the magistrates at
Hobart Town appears to have varied greatly. In the years 1810 and
1811 as many as 500 lashes have been inflicted; but since the
commencement of the year 1816, they have very rarely exceeded
too, and have generally been limited to 50. In consequence of the
facility of reference possessed by Mr. Humphreys to the name, as
well as condition, of every convict that has arrived in the
southern settlements of Van Dieman's Land, since he was appointed
to the superintendence of the police in the year 1817, he was
enabled to affix those particulars to a very large proportion of
the convicts that had been brought before magistrates at Hobart
Town, except in the years 1819 and 1820, when, in consequence of
sending off from Sydney, with greater dispatch than usual, a
number of convicts who had been engaged in an extensive
conspiracy to surprise and carry off vessels from the harbour of
Port Jackson, their original sentences had not been transmitted
from the secretary's office at Sydney, and their condition could
not be ascertained till the muster of 1820 was completed. It is
by reference to that document that I have been able to ascertain
the exact number of the different classes of convicts in the
district of Hobart Town, and adjoining districts, and to compare
it with the convictions for the same period. Without this
knowledge of these particulars for the preceding years, the same
comparison cannot be effected, but for six months of the year
1820 it appears, that out of 457 offences committed by convicts
in these districts, 282 were committed by convicts transported
for seven years, 41 by those for 14 years, and 134 by those for
life; the numbers of convicts of those several classes amounting
to 946 for seven years, 255 for 14 years, and 709 for life. It
will thus appear that the proportion of offences committed by the
class of seven years convicts, is to the whole numbers of that
class as 1 to 3&frac14;; the proportion of the class of 14 years,
is as 1 to 6&frac14;; and that of the convicts for life, is as 1
to 5&frac34;.</p>
<p>The limited accommodation of the gaol at Hobart Town, and the
number of prisoners with which it has been frequently crowded
before the means could be procured of sending them with the
witnesses to Sydney, has much diminished the effect of
confinement there: Lieutenant-governor Sorrell has endeavoured to
remedy it by the construction of solitary cells; but they have
not been, lately, found sufficiently numerous for the prisoners
sentenced by the magistrates.</p>
<p>The punishment of the gaol gang at Hobart Town I observed to
be very inefficient. The prisoners worked in irons, as at Sydney,
in cleaning and levelling the streets; but I could observe that
there was very little exertion used to make them work, and that
they frequently received supplies of food from their acquaintance
in the streets. Lieutenant-governor Sorrell had long perceived
the want of a place of secondary punishment, similar to that
which had existed at the Coal River; and agreeing with me in the
expediency of providing one that would be more within reach, Mr.
Oxley, the surveyor-general, who accompanied me to Van Dieman's
Land, undertook to visit and inspect a harbour on the north-west
coast of Van Dieman's Land, that had received the appellation of
Macquarrie Harbour, taking with him the pilot of Hobart Town,
Kelly, an experienced navigator, who had previously visited the
harbour. A series of violent and adverse winds from the
north-west prevented the vessel in which they embarked from
making much progress after they left Port Davey, a harbour that
they first proceeded to examine; and after contending against
very bad weather for 14 days, with great perseverance, and under
circumstances of some personal hardship, an apprehension of want
of provisions obliged them to return. I endeavoured to collect as
much information as I was able respecting this harbour; for it
appeared, both to Lieutenant-governor Sorrell and myself, to
possess some particular recommendations for a place of
punishment.</p>
<p>The species of timber known in the colony by the name of the
huon pine was found in great abundance; there were also
indications of coal; and the ranges of sterile mountains that
rose from the shores of the harbour towards the interior, and
through which no one had yet attempted to pass, formed a good
security against escape. Unfortunately the entrance is intricate,
and difficult for vessels drawing more than eight feet water, and
the bar is known to shift after the prevalence of north-west
winds.</p>
<p>From the nature of the soil that has been examined on the
shores of this harbour, the maintenance of the convicts sent
thither would entirely depend upon imported food; and, from the
best accounts, I was induced to believe that the supplies would
be liable to many casualties and interruptions from bad weather,
and bad navigation. Lieutenant-governor Sorrell seemed disposed
to renew the experiment under more favourable circumstances of
weather, but I was not induced to believe that his further
investigation of the capacities of Macquarrie Harbour would be
more satisfactory than the accounts that I had already
received.</p>
<p>The registry of offences and punishments inflicted at
Launceston I found to have been very irregularly kept until the
year 1317. From the 23d November 1813 to the 24th May 1817, rough
minutes of the evidence had been taken by the person who now acts
as clerk to Lieutenant-colonel Cimiti&egrave;re, and fair copies
were made by the clerk afterwards, but have never been signed by
the magistrates. In examining these books I found the same
difference in the extent of punishment existed that is
perceivable in the registry of offences and punishments at Hobart
Town, and the same exercise of criminal jurisdiction over free
men. An abstract is made of the number and nature of the offences
committed at both places in the different years.</p>
<p>Before I quit this subject, I think it necessary to state that
recourse to corporal punishment became more a matter of necessity
at Launceston than at any other of the settlements. The place of
confinement there consisted only of two small rooms in a house
built of wood, without any fence or wall to separate it from the
town; and the communication of the prisoners with their friends,
their frequent escape, and the want of control over them, have
all had their influence in impeding the course of criminal
justice, both in the investigation and detection of crimes, as
well as in their punishment.</p>
<p>The female convicts, from want of any separate room in the
prison, were placed in a small wooden but near the blacksmith's
forge, now converted into a church, and a constable was placed
over them to prevent their escape. This mode of punishment was
found so ineffectual, that latterly the female convicts were sent
to George Town, where they cohabited with the government
convicts.</p>
<p>As the attention of the different commandants of the
settlement at Port Dalrymple had been exclusively directed to the
construction of the buildings at George Town, it was not
considered necessary by Governor Macquarrie to incur any expense
44 in the repair of those at Launceston; and although the
necessity of making these repairs has been daily increasing from
the increase of population, the governor always hoped that with
the removal of the residence of the commandant from Launceston to
George Town, the mass of the population would remove also. Upon
what erroneous grounds this expectation was founded, and upon
what equally erroneous perception of the local advantages of
these two stations, Governor Macquarrie's recommendations and
suggestions to your Lordship have been made, it will afterwards
be my duty to point out to you; but the immediate necessity of
making some provision at Launceston for the confinement of
prisoners was so distressingly felt, that although Governor
Macquarrie did not concur in the views that I took of the
expediency of immediately suspending the buildings at George
Town, he consented to allow some repairs to be made to the gaol
at Launceston, and has put a stop to several unauthorized
locations of land in that town, which had been made by the
commandant without the knowledge of Lieutenant-governor Sorrell,
and under the notion that it was the intention of Governor
Macquarrie to abandon the town of Launceston altogether.</p>
<p><a name="ch-30" id="ch-30"></a><small><b>SETTLEMENT OF
HUNTER'S RIVER.]</b></small></p>
<p>Having now observed upon the state of crimes and punishments
inflicted by the magistrates upon the convict population of New
South Wales and Van Dieman's Land, I think it a more convenient
opportunity in this place, to afford your Lordship some
information respecting the settlement at Hunter's River,
otherwise called the Coal River.</p>
<p>Upon the evacuation of Norfolk Island, which, at an early
period of the colony, was the first place to which convicts were
sent by way of punishment for offences committed within the
colony, the importance of hunter's River, as a place of secondary
punishment, became more fully known. Previous to that time it had
been resorted to as an establishment for procuring a supply of
coals and timber for the demand of government and of individuals,
who were allowed to resort thither in vessels of their own, and
to purchase timber at the rate of three pence per superficial
foot, and coals at the rate of 10<i>s</i>. per ton.</p>
<p>By the tenor of the instructions given by Governor Macquarrie
to Major Morisset, the present commandant, and dated the 24th
December 1818, it would appear that the exclusive supply of the
same articles to government was considered to be the principal
object of the establishment, and the punishment of the convicts
sent thither, to be a subordinate one. There are, however, full
instructions upon both points; and commendable attention is shown
in them to prevent as much as possible the communication of the
prisoners with the crews of vessels that might touch at Port
Hunter, or the introduction of spirits. Port Hunter is situated
in 32 deg. 58 min. south latitude, and 151 deg. 42 min. east
longitude, and 52 miles to the north of Port Jackson. The voyage
to and from thence may be performed in eight hours; but the
difficulty of entering the harbour and of leaving it, in certain
periods of the tide, frequently causes a longer detention. The
settlement and town are situated on the slope of a hill, that
presents a front of abrupt sandstone rock towards the sea,
gradually receding into a barren clay and sand towards the
interior. The house and residence of the commandant Major
Morisset, is placed in an elevated situation at the end of the
principal street, and commands a view of the whole town. The
houses of the convicts are placed at irregular distances from
each other, but preserve an even line towards the streets, which
are well laid out, and kept in order. They are seven in number,
and contain altogether 13 houses that belong to government, and
71 that belong to prisoners. Having found it necessary to provide
some place of lodging for those prisoners, who either could not
easily find it themselves, or were not to be trusted in the
houses of others, Major Morisset lately built a wooden barrack,
containing four apartments for sleeping, and two for messing the
convicts. The plan and dimensions of this building are contained
in the Appendix.</p>
<p>The greatest advantages have been experienced from this
measure, both in the prevention of nocturnal escapes, and of the
bartering of the men's rations for tobacco and articles that were
not allowed in their government ration.</p>
<p>This building contains two rooms, in which there are double
rows of cribs, and in each of these three men sleep. The
dimensions of these cribs are four feet three inches by six feet.
There are also two sheds, one of which contains 24 births, and
the other 18, all of the same dimensions as in the other rooms,
affording altogether accommodation for 246 men. The remainder of
the convicts either possess houses of their own, or obtain
lodgings by the performance of domestic labour for the owners. An
arrangement productive of very beneficial consequences has been
pointed out in the instructions to the commandant, and has been
since adopted by him, by virtue of which every person who applies
for permission to build a house becomes responsible for any
lodger quitting the settlement without leave. It is the interest
therefore of the owner of the house to afford information of an
intended escape of his inmates, and the preparations for it are
now so well known, that timely precautions and common vigilance
in the constables may generally prevent them.</p>
<p>The hours of labour for the convicts in summer are from five
o'clock till eight, from nine till twelve, and from two to
sunset, except on Saturdays, when they have from ten till four to
themselves, and resume their work from four till sunset. The
convicts at Newcastle are mustered four times in the day by the
superintendent, who was a free man, and formerly a serjeant in
the 40th regiment; and if any report is made or suspicion arise
of a robbery or an escape, the convicts are mustered at their own
houses.</p>
<p>Constables and overseers are selected from the prisoners who
most recommend themselves; and their pay consists of an increased
ration, and sometimes the labour of a convict. It is stated by
the superintendent Evans, that he had no confidence in the
constables, and that they connived at the escapes of the
prisoners. The labour at Newcastle consists of the common and
coarser mechanical operations, that are conducted in a place
called the lumber-yard, and in cutting and procuring logs of wood
from a distance of 70 miles in the interior of the country.
Parties are sent upon these expeditions under the superintendence
of an overseer and a deputy, and the men are tasked by them to
cut and convey to the river a certain quantity of wood
proportioned to the distance and difficulty of procuring it, and
subject to the discretion of the commandant. The logs of wood are
then made into rafts and floated down the river by the tide, huts
being made upon them for the protection of the gangs upon their
voyage, which lasts sometimes eight days, but is always
uncertain, on account of the depth of water and current of the
river. The parties are sometimes absent for a month or more upon
these expeditions, and carry provisions with them for that
period; and a steel mill for grinding their corn. Another species
of work at the Coal River, consists of hewing and raising coal in
one coal mine that is now worked there. Until the year 1817, coal
was obtained at this settlement by a drift made on the sea shore,
and level with it, penetrating a seam of coal that ski showed
itself under the large mass of superincumbent sandstone that
forms the south headland of the entrance to Hunter's River. The
depth of the seam is three feet and one inch, and it is the same
that is now worked by a perpendicular shaft of 111 feet, and a
common windlass turned by convicts. The water found in the
present coal mine is carried off by the old drift to the sea
shore. Twenty-seven men are employed in the working of the mine,
and the mouth of the shaft immediately adjoins the offices of the
commandant's house. Twenty tons of coals can be raised in one day
by the number of men there employed; and I observed that several
could perform their task before the ordinary labour of the
convicts ceased, but that they were detained at the mouth of the
pit, under a shed, to prevent them from taking tell advantage of
the absence of the other convicts from their houses, and
plundering them. Eight of the miners employed, who hew the coals,
are allowed an extra half-ration; and as it is found necessary to
employ those men who are expert in this labour, convicts who have
been accustomed to it in England are frequently sent up to the
Coal River, direct from Sydney, upon their first disembarkation
from the ships. The height of the pit, in which the coal is
worked, is four feet and a half; and the coals are conveyed in
barrows from the point at which they are hewn, a distance which
in the month of February 1820 was not less than a hundred yards,
to the bottom of the shaft.</p>
<p>The labour in the coal mines at Newcastle is found to be
prejudicial to the health 111 of the convicts, on account of the
bad air of the mine that they breathe, and the difficulty that is
experienced in clearing it of water. Asthmas, pulmonary and
rheumatic complaints, are those from which the miners most
suffer.</p>
<p>The next kind of labour in which the convicts are employed is
that of constructing a breakwater wall, that has received the
name of Macquarrie Pier; and that is intended to connect a small
island at the mouth of the river with the main land. The object
of this work is to prevent the effect of a cross tide, which in
south and south-east winds flows with rapidity and violence into
the regular channel of the river, and throws vessels that are
passing it on the shoals of the northern shore. The work will
certainly be useful when it is finished, but it proceeds very,
slowly.</p>
<p>The last mode of employment, or rather of punishment, for men
who are found to be refractory, or sent with bad characters from
the other settlements, is that of collecting oyster shells and
burning them into lime. The place selected for this operation is
a peninsula of low land, that is separated from the settlement of
Newcastle by the Hunter's River in front, on the eastern side by
the sea, and on the western by the large and spreading inlets of
the river. The place of labour is about six miles from Newcastle.
The convicts are lodged in one wooden building, and are guarded
by a corporal's guard, and superintended by one overseer, who is
a convict. Each convict is tasked to procure a certain quantity
of shells, which are found in a loose and rich deposit of sandy
loam, that is easily removed. The shells are thrown into heaps,
after being disengaged from the loam, and burnt into lime with
logs of wood. The loading of the boats with lime is a part of the
operation that has been complained of, as on account of the
shallowness of the shore the boats are moored at some little
distance, and the lime is carried in baskets on the shoulders of
the convicts and deposited in the boats. I found that this
operation was performed only once a month; but from the spray of
the sea mixing with the lime, and the shoulders of the convicts
being without protection, it sometimes happens that they are
slightly burnt. The eyes of the men also employed in burning lime
are affected by the smoke, but not in a greater degree than in
England; and I found that they were in the habit of exposing
themselves, unnecessarily, to the smoke of the lime kilns, that
the state of their eyes might afford a pretext for their removal
from the settlement. Frequent communications take place between
the lime-burners station and Newcastle, and the nature of the
punishment consists in the removal of the convicts from their
associates, and in the difficulty that they find in obtaining an
increased quantity of food, or in exchanging their rations for
tobacco.</p>
<p>The allowance of food to the convicts at Newcastle consists of
eight pounds of wheat and four pounds of salt pork, or seven
pounds of salt beef or mutton per week. Many complaints were made
to me of the insufficiency of this ration, and some well grounded
complaints of its bad quality, which arose from the causes
already adverted to, the bad packing and curing of the salt beef
and mutton from Van Dieman's Land, and the bad curing of the salt
pork from Otaheite. The want of a mill to grind flour (the
occasion of loss of labour to government, and real privation to
the convicts) was at last supplied by the establishment of a
windmill that had been begun and built by Major Morisset, the
present commandant, whose attention was no sooner drawn to the
necessity of such a building than he began, with the sanction of
Governor Macquarrie, to undertake it. In the month of February
1820, the stone work was completed; and seeing the obvious
necessity for quickly completing the other parts of so useful a
work, I requested of the chief engineer, on my return from the
Coal River, that no unnecessary delay might take place in
completing the iron work, which could only be executed and cast
in the lumber-yard at Sydney. This, however, had to compete with
the iron work supplied to the mill of Mr. W. Hutchinson, the
principal superintendent of convicts, and his partner at Sydney.
I found upon inquiry that the iron work for them was executed in
the months of February and April of the year 1820, and that the
iron work for the mill at the Coal River was not received there
until the 11th and 26th April, and 2d May. The windmill at
Newcastle is now finished and well placed, and in a strong wind
is capable of grinding ten bushels of wheat in an hour.</p>
<p>Major Morisset was so much impressed with the advantages of
messing the convicts to prevent gambling and plunder of each
others rations, that he has adopted that system whenever he could
find it practicable; and as I perceived that they frequently ate
their whole ration of meat at one meal, and that it was the
opinion of free persons who had been long in the settlement, that
the ration of flour and meat, with the small allowance of
vegetables that the convicts could procure, was not sufficient
for their support in hard work in such a climate, I recommended
to Major Morisset to apply to Governor Macquarrie for an
allowance of the meal of maize at breakfast, which has since been
adopted with considerable advantage; and the convicts are enabled
to reserve a part of their ration of meat for their supper. The
want of clothing and bedding for the convicts at the Coal River
was great during the period of my visit, and partook more
largely, but justly, of the general want of clothing that was
experienced at that time throughout the colony.</p>
<p>The punishments for offences committed at the Coal River
consist of work in the chain gang, and flogging inflicted with
more severity than at the other settlements.</p>
<p>Upon the arrival of Captain Wallis of the 46th regiment, in
January 1817, to take the command, the labour of the convicts was
slight and the discipline relaxed. The regulations that he
introduced were effectual in reforming both, and he had recourse,
in the first instance, to considerable severity of punishment to
restore and maintain them; during the period of his command the
overseen were allowed to strike the convicts with sticks, which
at present they are not permitted to do. By the tenor of the
orders that he first issued, Captain Wallis appears to have tried
the effect of intimidation, and denounced certain recapture or
death from the black natives to those convicts who attempted to
make their escape by these means he succeeded in diminishing the
number of their attempts, but they still continue to be made
notwithstanding the failures that attend most of them, and the
miserable and emaciated condition of those that return. I had an
opportunity of seeing one convict that was brought into Windsor
in a most emaciated state, after having been out three weeks in
the woods, and living upon snakes and grubs, or roots of shrubs;
and those who are captured and brought back to Newcastle are also
greatly reduced. The native blacks that inhabit the neighbourhood
of Port Hunter and Port Stephens have become very active in
retaking the fugitive convicts. They accompany the soldiers who
are sent in pursuit, and by the extraordinary strength of sight
that they possess, improved by their daily exercise of it in
pursuit of kangaroos and opossums, they can trace to a great
distance, with wonderful accuracy, the impressions of the human
foot. Nor are they afraid of meeting the fugitive convicts in the
woods, when sent in their pursuit, without the soldiers; by their
skill in throwing their long and pointed wooden darts they wound
and disable them, strip them of their clothes, and bring them
back as prisoners, by unknown roads and paths, to the Coal
River.</p>
<p>They are rewarded for these enterprizes by presents of maize
and blankets, and notwithstanding the apprehensions of revenge
from the convicts whom they bring back, they continue to live in
Newcastle and its neighbourhood, but are observed to prefer the
society of the soldiers to that of the convicts.</p>
<p>Severe flogging, when they are in a state to bear it, is the
punishment inflicted for the offence of escape, or as it is
termed, running and I observed two instances a where some very
deep lacerations of the back and shoulders had been made in the
infliction of this punishment. The number of lashes given is not
so great as is usual in military punishments, but they are
inflicted with more severity.</p>
<p>The number of prisoners punished in the year 1819 amounted to
91, and out of these 34 were punished for attempting to make
their escape from the settlement. Considering the character of
the prisoners who are sent to this settlement, the crimes for
which they received punishment in 1819 are not of a heinous
nature. Three convicts, however, were sent to Sydney on charges
of murder, and were convicted. Major Morisset felt convinced,
that except for the offence of escape to other settlements, he
should have very little occasion to resort to punishments after
he had succeeded in constructing places of confinement during the
night for the worst men, and affording separate houses for those
who were well conducted.</p>
<p>In the year 1818, Governor Macquarrie gave permission to
Captain Wallis to place a certain number of the convicts, who had
conducted themselves well, in some fertile plains that adjoin
Hunter's River (and that are now called Patterson's Plains, and
Wallis's Plains) to cultivate land on their own account, and to
hold it during the pleasure of the government.</p>
<p>Three free persons, consisting of the storekeeper, the
assistant surgeon, and the pilot's son (and who, with the
commandant and the military, form the whole free population of
the settlement of Hunter's River) have received grants of land in
these plains, and cultivated a small portion of them; they are at
a distance of twenty miles by land and seventy by water from
Newcastle; and I observed that the convict settlers, who now
amount to eleven, frequently brought down with them, maize,
butter, poultry and eggs, which they gave in exchange for tea,
sugar, tobacco and cotton goods, that they procured from the
retailers of those articles at Newcastle.</p>
<p>The settlers at the plains are, with the exceptions before
stated, all prisoners, under long sentences, to the Coal River.
The land they occupy is very fertile, though it is subject to the
inundations of the river; but the produce of their farms has
afforded temptations for plunder, and employment to the convicts
at Newcastle, and the means of procuring luxuries, which, in a
place of mere punishment, ought to have been denied. In this
respect the settlement of Newcastle was remarkably adapted to
that purpose: the soil, for several miles near it, is so sterile
and poor, that the sheep allowed for the use of the commandant
and the hospital, and the cattle that are employed in the
government teams, are with difficulty supported on the natural
grams; with care, and much manure, vegetables are raised in the
government garden, and similar attempts are made in the small
patches of ground that surround some of the convicts houses.
These natural disadvantages of soil constitute some of the local
advantages for punishment, for they render hard labour an
indispensable condition of existence; and I was much disposed to
think, that the attempt to mingle with the business of punishment
the enjoyments of property, and the luxuriant produce of a
fertile soil, was a deviation from that which ought to have been
the principal object of the establishment. The exclusion of
spirituous liquors has been very effectually maintained by good
regulation and vigilance; and escapes by sea, or violent attempts
to cut out vessels in the harbour, are anticipated, by obliging
the crews to deliver their sails and rudders soon after they
anchor.</p>
<p>All the convicts are required and made to attend divine
service, in the church at Newcastle, on Sundays, when it is read
by one of the officers of the 48th regiment. As the residence of
the chaplain is now completed, the Rev. Mr. Middleton, who
arrived in New South Wales in the year 1820, was appointed to do
duty at Newcastle, and was to proceed thither soon after my
departure. A school, for the children of the convicts and
soldiers, was established by Captain Wallis of the 46th regiment,
and is continued at present. The school is kept in the vestry of
the church by one of the convicts, who had suffered the
punishment of transportation to the Coal River; and the progress
of the children, as well as their appearance, was very
creditable.</p>
<p>I cannot conclude this part of my subject without expressing
to your Lordship the satisfaction that I derived from observing
the great attention paid by Major Morisset to every part his
difficult and disagreeable duty; his vigilance and constant
superintendence of the works, his attention to the complaints of
the convicts, his patient investigation of them, and his efforts
to maintain discipline, are equally conspicuous and successful:
although aware of the necessity of inflicting severe punishments,
he has always accompanied them with admonitions, calculated to
impress upon the minds of other convicts his reluctance to resort
to severity, except upon occasions where it was obviously
required; these occasions have entirely arisen from the imperfect
security against escape that the situation of the place afforded,
weakened as it was by the connivance of the constables, and the
daily increasing knowledge of the country that separates Hunter's
River from the settled districts of New South Wales. In the
punishment of all other crimes Major Morisset has strictly obeyed
the instructions with which he was furnished, and has endeavoured
to adapt them to the characters of the several convicts, avoiding
corporal punishment where he could, and endeavouring to prevent
the commission of crime, by taking away temptations to it. The
good judgment of this officer has been no less conspicuous in the
public works that he has conducted, by directing the means that
he possessed to the accomplishment of objects that were
immediately required for the purposes of the establishment, and
attending to the solidity and durability of their construction,
rather than to their ornamental effect.</p>

<h3>VII.<br>
<i>Nature and extent of Remissions of Punishment, and their
effects upon the Convicts.</i></h3>
<p><small>RESERVING</small> for future observation an account of
the buildings and works at Newcastle, and having now concluded a
description of the penal character of that establishment, I Shall
proceed to submit to your Lordship a statement of the several
mitigations and remissions of sentence that have been bestowed
upon the convicts in New South Wales and Van Dieman's Land, by
Governor Macquarrie, during the last 10 years, in the exercise of
the authority that he derives from the statute passed in the 30th
year of his late Majesty's reign, c. 47.</p>
<p>The authority of Governor Macquarrie to mitigate or remit the
sentences of convicts transported to New South Wales, has been
derived from the general power that His Majesty is authorized by
this statute to confer on governors of New South Wales; for the
commission that was given to Governor Macquarrie in the month of
May 1819, and under which he has acted ever since, contains no
special power, although His Majesty's instructions of the same
date recite and refer to it.</p>
<p>Governor Macquarrie's commission authorizes him to pardon in
criminal matters, and to grant reprieves; but that power
evidently applies to crimes committed in New South Wales, and not
to offences committed in Great Britain. The effects of this
omission upon the absolute and conditional pardons, conferred by
Governor Macquarrie, are too obvious to require further
explanation; and they furnish an additional reason for the final
confirmation of pardons, that is now held to be necessary, before
remitted convicts can enter into the full enjoyment of the
benefits that such exercise of authority was intended to
convey.</p>
<p>Until the first declaration issued by Governor Macquarrie on
the 22d June 1811, no period of the term of service for the
several classes of convicts had been known or declared, at which
applications for the conditional or entire remission of their
sentences were to be made. The declaration alluded to begins by
stating, "the importunity with which the governor had been
troubled, of applicants for free and conditional pardon; many of
whom were very undeserving such high indulgences"; and of the
necessity for preventing such encroachments upon his time, by the
declaration and strict observance of the following rules: first,
that it being the governor's unalterable intention to extend the
high boon of royal clemency only to such persons as had, by a
long and uninterrupted period of good conduct, and sincere
contrition of their past offences, evinced themselves worthy of
such favour and indulgence; he declared that no convict under
sentence of transportation for life need apply for a free pardon
or emancipation, except in a case of extraordinary merit, until
after a lapse of several years of servitude, and fidelity of
conduct; and convicts for limited terms of transportation were to
experience no remission of their original sentence until they had
served one-half of the time at least.</p>
<p>Tickets of leave were not to be given until the applicants had
served three years, at least, for the government, or the settlers
to whom they were assigned, subject always to good conduct during
that time certified by the magistrate or clergyman of the
district in which the applicant resided.</p>
<p>The declaration further stated, that the governor desired it
to be clearly and distinctly understood, that having laid down
the foregoing system for his own government, he was determined
not to deviate from it in any instance whatever.</p>
<p>In the month of January 1813, a new regulation took place in a
government and general order, in which it was declared that very
little attention had been shown to the former orders respecting
applications of convicts, and that they should thenceforth only
be made on one day in the year, viz. the first Monday in each
succeeding month of December. The clergymen and magistrates were
enjoined not to sign certificates for any persons with whose real
character they were not well acquainted, and that the
certificates must express their considering the applicants to be
sober, honest, and industrious.</p>
<p>Absolute pardons were not to be applied for by convicts for
life, until they had been 15 years in the colony, nor by convicts
for limited terms, until they had resided at least three-fourths
of those terms.</p>
<p>Conditional pardons, or emancipations, were not to be granted
to convicts for life until they had been to years in the colony;
nor to convicts for limited terms, until they had resided at
least two-thirds of their original sentences. The same regulation
that was declared in the year 1811, respecting tickets of leave,
was repeated.</p>
<p>I am not aware of any subsequent regulation on this subject;
and it is considered that these last regulations are still in
force.</p>
<p>Such are the rules by which Governor Macquarrie has professed
to guide himself in the exercise of this important branch of his
duty. Upon several occasions, however, since the promulgation of
these rules, he has thought it expedient to suspend their
operation, in consequence of the numbers of convicts that had in
the years immediately preceding received absolute or conditional
pardons, or tickets of leave. Suspensions of general
applications, stated to be founded upon this principle of
expediency, were ordered to take place on the 16th November 1816,
on the 7th November 1818, (except for tickets of leave), and
again on the 11th November 1820. These orders were not observed;
for in the year 1817, 10 free pardons, 16 conditional pardons,
and 202 tickets of leave, were granted. In 1819, 21 free pardons,
56 conditional pardons, and 205 tickets of leave and in 1820, 9
free pardons, 191 conditional pardons, and 365 tickets of leave,
were granted.</p>
<p>The terms of these different species of indulgence are to be
found in the Appendix. An absolute pardon of the governor of New
South Wales contains a declaration under his hand, and the seal
of the territory, that the unexpired term of transportation of
the convict is absolutely remitted to him. It is registered in
the secretary's office, and a fee of 5<i>s</i>. is paid there to
the principal clerk, and 6<i>d</i>. to the government
printer.</p>
<p>A conditional pardon contains a declaration of the governor,
under his hand and official seal, that the unexpired term of the
convict's sentence is conditionally remitted to him; and the
condition is expressed to be, that he shall continue to reside
within the limits of the government of New South Wales during the
space of the original sentence, under pain of incurring all the
penalties of re-appearing in Great Britain, for and during the
term of his original sentence or order of transportation; or as
if the remission had never been granted.</p>
<p>The ticket of leave contains a declaration of the governor's
pleasure to dispense with the attendance, at government work, of
the convict holding it, and of his being permitted to employ
himself (off the government stores) in any lawful occupation,
within any given district, for his own advantage, during good
behaviour, or until the governor's pleasure shall be made known.
It is either expressed to be by command of the governor and
signed by his secretary, or it is signed by the governor
himself.</p>
<p>The certificates issued by the secretary attest, that after an
examination of the indents, so many years have expired since
sentence of that term was passed on the party entitled to it,
describing the year and ship in which he arrived, and ending with
a declaration, that by reason of the expired service, the said
party is restored to all the rights of a free subject.</p>
<p>To all these documents a description of the person is added,
and they are registered in separate books in the office of the
secretary to the governor.</p>
<p>I will first submit to your Lordship a statement of the number
of these several kinds of remissions of punishment that have been
conferred by Governor Macquarrie, since he assumed the government
in New South Wales; the manner in which they are granted, and the
considerations for granting them; and lastly, the effect and
rights that they have been held to confer upon the parties.</p>
<p>From the year 1810 to the year 1820, Governor Macquarrie has
granted 366 free pardons, 1,365 conditional pardons, and 2,319
tickets of leave. A nominal list of the convicts that have
received these remissions of sentence, in each year, from 1810 to
to 1820, is to be found in the Appendix; distinguishing the
period of the conviction of the parties in England, the year of
their arrival in New South Wales, and the date of their remission
of sentence.</p>
<p>These particulars I thought important, as I was not certain
whether they had been fully stated, or regularly transmitted for
your Lordship's information, during the whole of the above
period.</p>
<p>By the first, regulations that appeared upon the subject of
remissions of sentence, applications might be made for them to
the governor in every month of the year; but by the regulation of
1813, they have been restricted to one day in the year. This
restriction arose from the inconvenience that was felt by the
governor in the augmentation of the business he had to transact,
and the pretexts that the applications afforded to the convicts
for perpetual absences, and journies to Sydney, to present their
applications. I was present at the government house on the 3th
January 1820, the day to which the petitions that were to have
been presented in November 1819 had been deferred, in consequence
of the governor's illness. The crowd, upon this occasion, was
very great; and observing their impatience, the governor
addressed them, and informed them that he would grant no tickets
of leave to those who had not been three years in the country,
nor any other indulgence, except in conformity to the terms of
his proclamation of the year 1813. This address produced no
effect. There was great difficulty in preserving order in the
presentation of the petitions that were delivered to the
governor; who, on perusing the statements, and looking at the
certificates, either wrote in pencil, on the margin, the initial
letters of the indulgence that was to be given, or rejected the
petitions altogether. The petitions presented upon this occasion
exceeded 700; they were collected by the major of brigade and two
clerks, who, with the superintendent of convicts, were the only
persons present.</p>
<p>The petitions to the governor for indulgences are generally
drawn up by the clerks to the magistrates, or the convicts who
are expert in writing: they set forth the year, and ship, in
which the petitioner arrived in the colony, and his services in
it, and, concluding with a complimentary appeal to the governor's
benevolence and humanity, pray for such remission of sentence as
he may think fit to bestow. They are signed either by the
magistrates or the chaplains of the districts; but I observed
that the certificates of the different magistrates varied as much
in their form, as they did in the degree of their recommendation:
in some cases there was a simple signature of one or more
magistrates, in others there was a mere recommendation of the
petitioner's case to the governor; but in none did I see that the
terms of the governor's order for the year 1813 were strictly
complied with, or that the petitioners were certified to be
"honest, sober and industrious". In the district of Windsor, the
magistrates have generally met previous to the day of presenting
petitions to the governor, and have made a selection of persons
whom they thought most deserving in the several districts, and
forwarded a list, with their petitions, to the governor.</p>
<p>The applications of the convicts in the employment of
government are signed by the respective superintendents, and at
Sydney by the chief engineer.</p>
<p>In the course of my attendance at the government house, on the
presentation of petitions, my attention was particularly drawn to
the numerous violations of the governor's orders that had been
committed by all the magistrates, in signing certificates and
recommendations for convicts, whose services had not reached the
several terms appointed by the governor's order of the year 1813;
and it was the more observable, as the governor had addressed
circular letters to them previous to the period of receiving
petitions of this kind, in which they were requested to pay
particular attention to these points. The instances of this
inattention were more numerous in the petitions signed by Captain
Piper, the naval officer, than in those of any other magistrate;
and they were less excusable in him, because, from constantly
residing in the town of Sydney, and from giving very little
attendance at the meetings of the magistrates there, he had fewer
opportunities of knowing the conduct of the applicants than the
other magistrates who resided in the country.</p>
<p>After the petitions are received, the governor makes out a
list of those to whom indulgences are to be granted, and it is
sent to the secretary's office, where, upon a reference to the
original indents, the documents are filled up and prepared for
the governor's signature.</p>
<p>The indents transmitted in the earlier periods of
transportation to New South Wales stated in numbers, and not in
words at length, the periods for which the convicts were
sentenced; and in several columns of these indentures I observed,
that, to save trouble in repeating the figures 7 or 14, the
letters D had been used. I also observed, that in the indents of
the same period the sentences and dates had been altogether
omitted, and these omissions have been noticed, as they occurred,
in the returns from Mr. Campbell's office. In the indentures that
arrived by the ship Providence, on the 4th July 1811, from
Ireland, the names of two men, James Nowlan and Mich Glennans,
had been omitted: the sentence of one was unknown to him, and he
was considered to have been transported for life; the other made
an admission to that effect. The name of John Streetham was
without particulars of his age, place, time of trial, or
sentence; and the name of Eleanor Doyle was in the same
situation: the indents were dated at Dublin, and signed
"Richmond", and "Charles Saxton". In referring to one of the old
indents of the year 1809, I found that two alterations had been
made in sentences for seven years, and they had been converted
into sentences for life. I did not observe more than these
instances of palpable alteration, but there were several names in
which erasures had been made; it is therefore very desirable that
the sentence of every convict should be stated at full length in
letters, and not in figures, and that the same practice should be
observed in this respect as has prevailed of late years in the
transmission of the indents from the office of the clerk of
arraigns for the county of Middlesex.</p>
<p>All the original indents of convicts transported to New South
Wales, excepting those that arrived by the Indefatigable, have
been kept in the custody of Mr. J. T. Campbell, since the arrival
of Governor Macquarrie. They were deposited in a wooden box, in a
room of his official residence, of which he always kept the key;
but, considering the importance of these documents, I do not
think that the place in which they were kept was sufficiently
secure.</p>
<p>Mr. Campbell's official residence did not afford any such
security, and he felt a delicacy in making applications to
Governor Macquarrie for any additions or improvement that might
appear to cast a reflection upon the defects of a plan that the
governor had approved. A book has been compiled by Mr. Campbell,
and is kept In his own office, containing a list of all persons
who apply for certificates, tickets of leave, and other
indulgences: this book is not permitted to be seen by the clerks,
and is made out upon the applications of the convicts, and by
reference to the original indents; and has been considered by Mr.
Campbell to be so authentic as to supersede any subsequent
reference to them; separate registers are also kept of
certificates, tickets of leave, and of remissions of sentence,
with the usual particulars of time of trial and sentence.
Certificates of expiration of sentence are issued on the first
Monday in every month; an arrangement which, although convenient
for the office of the secretary, has in several instances exposed
convicts to undue detention in their master's service, and
magistrates, to the consequences of inflicting illegal
punishment.</p>
<p>On referring to the returns, it appears, that out of the total
number of free pardons granted by Governor Macquarrie since the
publication of his last regulation, on the 9th January 1813,
until the 31st December 1820, there have been granted 124 free
pardons to convicts transported for life, in which there have
been 26 exceptions to the regulation; 24 have been granted to
convicts for 14 years, in which there have been 11 exceptions;
and 35 to convicts for seven years, in which there have been
three exceptions.</p>
<p>It further appears, that, in the same period of time, Governor
Macquarrie has granted 892 conditional pardons to convicts for
life, and that in these there have occurred 220 exceptions to his
regulations. In those granted to convicts for 14 years, 55 cases
of exception; and in those granted to convicts for seven years,
there have been only five cases of exception. Of the total number
of tickets of leave that have been granted to the several
descriptions of convicts by Governor Macquarrie since the month
of January 1813, and amounting to 1,655, there have occurred 450
exceptions to the regulations. Previous to the period at which
they were published, and more especially in the year 1810, which
was that of Governor Macquarrie's arrival, six persons
transported for life appear to have received absolute pardons
from the governor, at the expiration of two years from the date
of their arrival in the colony; one person of the same class in
one year, one in four years, and one in six years. These cases
were strongly recommended by Lieutenant-governor Patterson and
Lieutenant-governor Foveaux to the consideration of Governor
Macquarrie; and in consequence of the promises that had been made
to the individuals, the pardons that had been promised to them
were confirmed.</p>
<p>The considerations for which these several remissions and
indulgences have been bestowed, are not expressed in any list
that has been taken or kept by Governor Macquarrie; but lists
have been kept, and are signed by him, of the particulars of the
condition of the convicts to whom remissions of sentence or
tickets of leave have been given, with the names of the chaplains
or magistrates by whom they have been recommended.</p>
<p>The general principle upon which Governor Macquarrie has
professed to grant emancipations and indulgences, has been that
of reference to the good conduct of the applicants; and he has
generally considered, that the safest channel of information upon
this important point, was that of the magistrates and chaplains
of the colony. If reference had been made either by these
individuals to the records of the criminal proceedings before
them, or by Governor Macquarrie, to the quarterly returns that
were transmitted to him, negative evidence, at least, of the good
conduct in the colony, of the several applicants might have been
obtained, or positive evidence of their misconduct. Such means of
information, however, for reasons that have been stated before,
are not made use of upon these occasions; and in cases where the
magistrates have no knowledge themselves of the applicants, they
have appealed to the chief constable, or to the district
constable, for information. Some of the magistrates, however,
refuse to give these certificates to convicts who have resided
out of their immediate neighbourhood, of whom they have heard or
known nothing; and they are then obliged to repair to others, who
are less scrupulous, and more accommodating.</p>
<p>Another principle by which Governor Macquarrie has been guided
in bestowing pardons and indulgences, is that of considering them
as rewards for any particular labour or enterprize. It was upon
this principle, that the men who were employed in working upon
the Bathurst road, in the year 1815, and those who contributed to
that operation by the loan of their own carts and horses, or of
those that they procured, obtained pardons, emancipations, and
tickets of leave. To 39 men who were employed as labourers in
this work, three free pardons were given, one ticket of leave,
and 35 emancipations; and two of them only had held tickets of
leave before they commenced their labour. Seven convicts received
emancipations for supplying horses and carts for the carriage of
provisions and stores as the party was proceeding six out of this
number having previously held tickets of leave.</p>
<p>Eight other convicts (four of whom held tickets of leave)
received emancipations for assisting with carts, and one horse to
each, in the transport of provisions and baggage for the use of
Governor Macquarrie and his suite, on their journey from the
river Nepean to Bathurst, in the year 1816, a service that did
not extend beyond the period of five weeks, and was attended with
no risk, and very little exertion.</p>
<p>Between the months of January 1816 and June 1818, nine
convicts, of whom six held tickets of leave, obtained
emancipations for sending carts and horses to convey provisions
and baggage from Paramatta to Bathurst, for the use of Mr. Oxley,
the surveyor-general, in his two expeditions into the interior of
the country; and in the same period, 23 convict labourers and
mechanics obtained emancipations for labour and service performed
at Bathurst.</p>
<p>The nature of the services performed by these convicts, and
the manner in which some of them were recommended, excited much
surprise in the colony, as well as great suspicion of the purity
of the channels through which the recommendations passed.</p>
<p>Those who were employed in making the Bathurst road, were
selected by Mr. Cox and Richard Lewis, both of whom have before
been mentioned in the superintendence of that and the subsequent
operations.</p>
<p>The first principle that was kept in view by these persons in
the recommendations of the labourers, was, capacity for labour;
and it is stated by some of the free persons, who assisted in it,
that the men worked hard, and that they were excited to exertion
by the hope of receiving emancipations, which is certainly the
strongest moral incentive that can be applied to the compulsory
labour of convicts.</p>
<p>The recommendations of persons who lent their horses and carts
were still more suspicious, and in their nature more
objectionable. Few of the persons recommended, had to undergo any
degree of personal hardship, or the performance of any labour;
and the following persons amongst others, viz. Robert Hazard,
Bradbury, Carpenter, Hodges, Tindal, and Joel Josephs, only lent
their carts and horses, which were driven by their assigned
servants; or hired carts of other persons, to enable them to
perform the only condition, and to pay the only price of their
freedom.</p>
<p>When the attainment of emancipations was placed upon this
footing, there became many candidates for them, and a belief
prevailed, that Richard Lewis was the person to whom the first
applications were to be made.</p>
<p>It was also perceived, that Mr. Cox, to whom the management of
the Bathurst road, and the making of the Richmond road were
intrusted, exercised a very powerful influence in the
dispensation of remissions of sentence and tickets of leave.</p>
<p>It is to this influence that is to be attributed the success
that Mr. Cox has met with in his improvement of the convicts that
were placed under him. Men, who had been rejected by others, and
who have returned from the Coal River, have willingly entered
into the service of Mr. Cox, and worked for him industriously,
under his promises to obtain tickets of leave, or emancipations
for them: Mr. Cox also had the means of transferring to his own
farms the occasional services of men who were working on the
roads, under an expectation of emancipation, and obtained
services from them gratuitously, which other persons could with
difficulty obtain, and must have paid for. The evidence of
William O'Bryan, is very pointed upon this subject, and its truth
has not been denied by Mr. Cox, who had ample opportunities of
observing upon it.</p>
<p>In the same way and under the same influence, four of the men
who worked very frequently at Bathurst for Mr. Cox, and whose
labour was taken in exchange by him for that of other workmen
that he had lent to government, received emancipations upon his
recommendation.</p>
<p>I certainly believe, that in making these recommendations, Mr.
Cox followed only the example of other magistrates, and masters
of convicts in the colony, who have found, that the best way to
stimulate their industry is to promise them recommendations to
the governor, after the performance of any given quantity of
work. There are other masters, who are not disposed to make such
sacrifices of principle to profit, and it is only by the
instrumentality of such persons, and by taking care also, that
their refusal to certify the good conduct of a servant does not
proceed from a selfish wish to retain his services, that this
very important part of the reformatory influence of the colony
can be preserved in purity, or prevented from becoming a source,
either of private corruption, or of continued oppression.</p>
<p>As the principle of rewarding convicts with emancipations and
pardons for services, similar to those performed on the Bathurst
and Richmond roads, interferes with the operation of the
principle, upon which, alone, they should be given; and which
Governor Macquarrie, in his first orders on these subjects, very
emphatically proclaimed, "as the invariable rule by which he
intended to govern himself for the future;" the departure from
that rule, for the purpose of cheaply obtaining services that
would have been chargeable to the colonial fluids, has tended to
bring into suspicion and disrepute the exercise of a prerogative
that should of all others be most free from both. It produced a
belief, that the rewards of good conduct were become the subjects
of sale and barter, through the corruption of the agents
employed.</p>
<p>I think it necessary to state here, that although many persons
in the colony have regretted the facility with which Governor
Macquarrie has yielded to the recommendations for pardons and
emancipations upon these occasions, and have considered that this
facility has produced an unfortunate effect upon the minds of the
convicts in the colony; yet I never have heard the slightest
suspicion cast upon the purity of his own motives, or the
integrity of his conduct, either in these, or in other cases of
granting indulgences.</p>
<p>The conduct of some of the persons who received emancipation
for the services before alluded to is not undeserving of notice;
Thomas Gorman, who acted as storekeeper to the Bathurst road
party, and afterwards at Bathurst, appears, by the acknowledgment
and in the language of Mr. Cox, who recommended him, to have been
"a consummate villain."&mdash;Thomas Carpenter, after receiving
his emancipation for conveying stores to Bathurst for Mr. Oxley's
expedition, became the tenant of a public house in Sydney in the
month of February 1820, and contrary to the recommendation of the
magistrates at Sydney; in four months after that period, he was
convicted by the criminal court of receiving stolen goods,
amongst which was found some wearing apparel of the aide-de-camp
to Governor Macquarrie.&mdash;John Hodges had received a ticket
of leave prior to his sending his horse and cart for the same
service as Carpenter, in consequence of his having married a
young woman who was a native of the colony, and of having
purchased land. He afterwards took a house, and lived in
Paramatta, where he sold spirits without a license, and was
notorious for affording reception to the servants of settlers,
and for promoting licentiousness and debauchery. He was convicted
twice during my residence in the colony of selling spirits
without a licence, and was abandoned by his wife; but in
consequence of a promise that had been made to him by Governor
Macquarrie, that he should have a licence on condition of
building a good house in Paramatta, I find that be since received
one in the year 1821, after having performed the
condition.&mdash;Robert Hazard had been transported a second time
to the colony, and for life in the year 1815. He immediately
received a ticket of leave on his arrival, and married the
daughter of a person who had kept an inn at Paramatta, and who
had some property; with that, and with the profits of a
successful investment of tobacco that he had been allowed to make
while his ship, the Indefatigable, was at Rio de Janeiro, he
established himself at an inn in Sydney that was licensed in the
name of his wife, who was the daughter of a convict. Here he
conducted himself well, and his house continued to be the resort
of the most respectable settlers in the country until he died, in
the year 1820.&mdash;William Bradbury obtained a grant of land
soon after he received his emancipation, and has occupied it ever
since. He was one of those who accompanied Governor Macquarrie in
us last expedition to the newly discovered lakes; and gave his
personal attendance, with his horse and cart, receiving payment
from the police fund for that service. This man bore a good
character, and had succeeded better than many others of his class
in the cultivation of his farm.&mdash;David Lindley acted as
storekeeper at Bathurst from the year 1817 to the year 1819, and
having received a free pardon from His Majesty, on account of
circumstances unconnected with Ins conduct in New South Wales, he
returned home in fee year 1820. His character was stated to me to
have been good, although I had not the means of ascertaining
whether he had resisted the great temptations to which he was
exposed, by the system upon which Mr. Cox had been suffered to
conduct the government works, and the issues of provisions at
Bathurst.</p>
<p>Emancipations and tickets of leave have been likewise given to
convicts for services rendered by them in exploring the country.
On the 12th December 1818, Governor Macquarrie gave absolute
pardons to five men who had accompanied Mr. Oxley in two
expeditions, and to two men who had accompanied him in the last;
and he also gave conditional pardons to five others who had
accompanied Mr. Oxley in his last expedition. These pardons were
bestowed in consequence of the favourable report that Mr. Oxley
had made to the governor of their services, and of the hardships
that they had endured. I was informed by him that they had
conducted themselves well in the colony since they had received
their remissions of sentence; and all of those who had received
their free pardons have remained in it. But as a proof of the
difficulty of obtaining concurrent testimony respecting the
character of convicts, it is only necessary to refer to the
observations made by Mr. Cox respecting the character of Patrick
Hume and James Blake, two of the men who received absolute
pardons in 1818, and whom, on reference to their former conduct,
he describes "as persons scarcely to be equalled even in the
wretched society of the convicts of New South Wales". It must be
observed, that Mr. Cox had sent these men to be tried before a
criminal court on a charge of poisoning the horses that were
prepared for Mr. Oxley's expedition, a charge of which they were
acquitted, but of which Mr. Cox still thinks that they were
guilty; and that they had afterwards related to Mr. Oxley, on his
arrival at Bathurst, as well as to other persons, the nature of
Mr. Cox's proceedings there.</p>
<p>I found that Patrick Burne was acting as superintendent
stock-keeper of several large herds of cattle in and near
Sidmouth Plains, and he accompanied one in my expedition from
Bathurst to the lakes; and James Blake was acting as
superintendent and overseer on the farm of Mr. Assistant
Commissary General Cordeaux, and both of these men were much
trusted and commended by their employers.</p>
<p>In consequence of the suspensions in the annual distribution
of pardons and remissions of sentence, some inconvenience has
arisen in their having been withheld from those to whom promises
had been made by Governor Macquarrie and Mr. Cox, for services
performed either at Bathurst, or in those that he subsequently
superintended upon the Richmond and western roads. To remedy this
inconvenience, Mr. Cox and the magistrates of Windsor have
thought themselves justified in giving passes to these men to
work, as it is termed, "upon their own hands", and free from
molestation, till they should obtain their promised
emancipations.</p>
<p>The attention of the other magistrates, and of the chief
constables, had been drawn to this circumstance by the frequent
appearance of the men, before them with a pass, which, having
been given more frequently by Mr. Cox, than by any other person,
was vulgarly termed "Captain Cox's liberty", and at last it was
brought to the notice of Governor Macquarrie, at the muster of
the inhabitants that took place in 1819. A circular letter was
soon afterwards addressed by his secretary to the magistrates,
requesting that all convicts with these passes might be called
in, and that none should in future be given or admitted, except
those of the principal superintendent at Sydney, which were given
to convicts assigned in remuneration of overseers, clerks and
superintendents.</p>
<p>The system of granting tickets of leave to convicts on their
arrival, who are able to support themselves by their labour, or
by the means that they have brought with them, operates as an
encouragement to industry; but, at the same time, it too quickly
and too abruptly elevates them from a condition of punishment to
a condition of comparative enjoyment; there are many instances at
Sydney of the successful exertion of these people as retail
traders; but their industry feeds their vanity as well as their
vices, and they speedily lose that sense of humility and
contrition which is essential to a state of punishment and
reform.</p>
<p>Another evil arising from it is, the state of apparent
equality in which it places them with that part of the population
that came free to the colony; and with those who, having been
sent as convicts at a period when similar indulgences were not so
freely granted, feel surprise and some degree of mortification,
when they see them bestowed upon persons who, in their opinion,
have done nothing to deserve them.</p>
<p>It must be acknowledged that there is a great difficulty in
disposing of those convicts who have been in the higher
situations of life, and to whose attainments some respect is
naturally paid even in a state of punishment. It was a sense of
this difficulty, together with the recommendation that Mr. J. T.
Campbell, the governor's secretary, had given of Lawrence
Halloran, and a want of knowledge of his character and previous
conduct, that induced Governor Macquarrie to bestow upon him a
ticket of leave immediately upon his arrival in the colony. Mr.
Campbell had known Halloran at the Cape of Good Hope previous to
his altercations with the Earl of Caledon, and his attempts to
defame the character of General Grey, and believed, as many other
persons did, in the rectitude of his principles, and the general
propriety of his conduct. Mr. Campbell was not aware of the
circumstances that have since transpired, and that have so much
affected both; and he considered that the talents possessed by
Halloran, might be as usefully employed at Sydney as they
formerly had been at Cape Town, in the education of youth.
Halloran accordingly received a ticket of leave. He was no sooner
in possession of this indulgence, than he made a report to the
governor of the conduct of Captain Lambe of the ship Baring, and
preferred several charges against him, which were referred to the
investigation of the magistrates. Halloran, during this period,
had been observed to be much in the confidence of Mr. S. Lord, of
Sydney, and resided at his house; and Captain Lambe being
apprehensive that his case might receive some prejudice from that
circumstance, requested Mr. Justice Field to attend the bench.
Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde, Mr. Wentworth, and Mr. Brookes,
attended also. Four of these magistrates concurred in reporting
to Governor Macquarrie their opinion, that the charges of
Halloran against Captain Lambe, were both false and malicious,
and they ordered that his ticket of leave should be taken away,
and that he should be sent to government labour. This order was
not carried into immediate effect, and Mr. J. Field having met
Halloran in the streets of Sydney on the following day, and
feeling both surprise and indignation at such a sudden and
apparent reversal of the determination of the preceding day, he
re-assembled the magistrates, and after inquiring of the
superintendent of convicts whether an order had been given by him
for placing Halloran in the convict barrack, they were informed
that such an order had been given, but that on proceeding to
apprise Halloran of it, the superintendent saw Mr. Campbell, who
said, that he would be responsible for his appearance whenever he
was called for. The magistrates feeling that this act of Mr. J.
T. Campbell was an interference with their authority, as well as
a reflection upon its exercise, issued a summons for his
immediate appearance before them; with which he refused to
comply, on account of the unseasonable hour in which it reached
him. The magistrates forthwith made a representation to Governor
Macquarrie of Mr. Campbell's disobedience, which produced from
the governor a strong and just reproof. On the following day,
Halloran was again ordered and declared to be a convict in the
service of the crown; but to prevent the consequences of his
being compelled to labour, and to live in the convict barrack, he
was permitted to be assigned as servant to Mr. Simon Lord, and
afterwards received his ticket of leave. He then established a
school, which is much encouraged, and is well attended by the
sons of free persons, as well as of those who have been convicts;
and Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde, and Mr. J. T. Campbell, have
attended at a public examination of his scholars, and testified
their approbation of their progress and attainments. I was
solicited also by Halloran to attend upon one of these occasions,
but having had some previous knowledge of his conduct and
character in England, and bearing in mind the admonitions that
were transmitted by your Lordship to Governor Macquarrie upon
that subject, I declined Halloran's invitation; but visited his
school on the same day in which I visited the other schools at
Sydney. I found that the school was well conducted, and the
progress that had been made by the scholars, in a short period
after its establishment, added one more to the many proofs that
have been exhibited, of Halloran's skill in the art of
instruction. It was, however, justly remarked by the Reverend Mr.
Cowper, who accompanied me in my visit, that neither the Bible
nor any book of religious instruction, was used or taught in
Halloran's school. It having been suggested to him that some
representations that I had made to Governor Macquarrie, operated
unfavourably to his hopes of obtaining a conditional pardon, he
applied to me, and earnestly entreated my interference in his
favour, urging the hardship of ins situation, and the comparative
insignificance of the crime for which he was suffering. He
expressed his fixed determination of never returning to England,
and and of continuing to reside in New South Wales for the
remainder of his life. I observed, in reply, that I had the best
grounds for believing that a very just opinion had been formed of
his real character and conduct by His Majesty's government, and
that I did not consider it to be either consistent with that
opinion, or with the view that I had myself taken of his
situation, past or present, to relax in the slightest degree the
control over his conduct, that was afforded by the terms of his
ticket of leave; and acting upon the nine principle, I strongly
and repeatedly urged Governor Macquarrie to decline any
applications from Halloran for further indulgence, and the
governor promised that my suggestion should be observed, and that
his ticket of leave should be again withdrawn, in case of any
offensive or improper conduct.</p>
<p>The situation of Halloran was thus in no respect worse than
that which he had left in England, with the exception of being
separated from his family. It was his good fortune to meet with
those who sympathized with his condition, and who, from ignorance
of his real character, and from a natural recurrence to their own
fate, joined with him in reprobation of the severity and
injustice of the law by which he had suffered. He was regarded,
therefore, at Sydney as an unhappy victim, and the reports of his
real character were disbelieved, or imputed to the effects of
some concealed enmity. Halloran has forwarded through me, an
application to your Lordship for permission for his family to
join him in New South Wales; I have learnt that this permission
has already been granted, but I cannot help submitting it to your
Lordship as my opinion, that no further indulgence should be
extended to Halloran than that which he at present enjoys; and
that a particular instruction should be given to the local
authorities in New South Wales, to institute occasional inquiries
into his conduct in the management of his school.</p>
<p>Another conspicuous instance of early indulgence was afforded
in the person of Thomas Wells, a convict transported to New South
Wales for 14 years, for embezzling the property of his master.
His attainments had attracted the notice of Lieutenant-governor
Sorrell, on his voyage from England to assume the government of
Van Dieman's Land in 1817; and on his arrival at Port Jackson, he
recommended Wells to Governor Macquarrie, who gave him a ticket
of leave, and he then accompanied Lieutenant-governor Sorrell to
Hobart Town, where he was appointed to the situation of clerk in
the secretary's office. In this situation he has performed nearly
the whole of the duties of secretary, and has approved himself to
the lieutenant-governor by his diligence and ability; he has
become possessed of a very good house in Hobart Town, conspicuous
for its neatness and even elegance; and joined with a Mr.
Brodribb, a convict attorney, in the purchase of some cattle and
land, formerly the property of Major Mackenzie of the 46th
regiment.</p>
<p>The terms of this purchase were brought to my notice by an
agent of Major Mackenzie, who arrived at Hobart Town during my
residence there, and they were of such a nature as to preclude
him from having any remedy at law against the purchasers, and to
leave them in the unmolested possession of property for which
they had never paid. Upon my representing these circumstances to
them, they both disavowed any knowledge of a stipulation which
they admitted to be fraudulent, and insisted that they had
sustained a loss by the purchase. This circumstance was not
known, but I do not think it would have affected the character of
these persons in Hobart Town. I could not help regretting it, not
so much on account of the parties themselves, as on account of
the situations they held. T. Wells was the principal channel
through which all communications passed between individuals of
every description and the lieutenant-governor; he was even the
depositary of the copies of the indents of the convicts sent to
Van Dieman's Land, until I pointed out to the lieutenant-governor
the extreme danger of such a trust.</p>
<p>No complaints were made to me of any corruption in Mr. Wells
in the dispensation of the many favours that proceeded through
his hands; but he was represented to be presumptuous, and even
insolent.</p>
<p>I cannot omit this opportunity of stating, that men, who have
been convicts, are not fit persons to convey either the favours
or the commands of the local government; and lam persuaded, that
the lieutenant-governor would not have selected the individual in
question for the office in which he had been so long continued,
if he could have obtained any better or less exceptionable
assistance.</p>
<p>The convicts that have been employed by government, are
recommended to the governor for remissions of sentence by the
chief engineer, or the principal and other superintendents of
convicts at the different stations; and it appears by the
evidence of the superintendent Hutchinson, that he undertakes
that duty occasionally for individuals, who wish to recommend
their convict servants; and the statement of their merits is
confided to him, and conveyed verbally to the governor.</p>
<p>The ordinary statement of the claims of the government
convicts, is not always made in writing to the governor; but a
list is made out of those whom the chief engineer and the
principal superintendent join in recommending, and that list is
transmitted, when approved, to the secretary's office. Some
reluctance, however, appears to have taken place in that office,
on some late occasions, in making out tickets of leave for
convicts, to whom that indulgence had been promised by the
principal superintendent. Two convicts, Morris and Peate, who had
worked for the superintendent at Pennant Hills, in cutting timber
for his houses and mill, had received promises from him of
tickets of leave. They were desired to deliver their petitions to
him, and not to the governor; and they complied with that
request, receiving from the principal superintendent certificates
that they had been promised tickets of leave by Governor
Macquarrie. Upon repairing to the office of Mr. Secretary
Campbell, in three weeks afterwards, for their tickets of leave,
they were informed that their names were not in the governor's
list, and that no tickets of leave would be delivered to
them.</p>
<p>A complaint of the breach of promise to these two convicts was
made to me through Mr. G. D. Mathew, who, it appears, had engaged
the services of one of them, in sawing wood for himself, and upon
the expectation of his obtaining a ticket of leave. When the
circumstances of the case were represented to Governor
Macquarrie, the tickets of leave were granted. The principal
superintendent of convicts acknowledged that he had given the
certificates to the two men, and alleged that their names had
been inserted in the list of his recommendations to Governor
Macquarrie; the certificates being given to them for the purpose
of identifying their persons, when they went to the secretary's
office to apply for the tickets of leave. Mr. J. T. Campbell
observing, that the names, so certified, were not included in the
list signed by Governor Macquarrie, that had been transmitted to
him, refused to make out the tickets of leave. From all the
circumstances attending this transaction, I am led to infer that
the principal superintendent had either not included the men's
names in his list, or had only verbally mentioned them to
Governor Macquarrie, and depended upon the weight and authority
that he hoped would be given to his certificates, when they were
presented at the secretary's office. Morris stated, that he had
received from the principal superintendent, certain advances in
goods for the wood he had sawn for him, but that at the time of
his obtaining his ticket of leave, a balance was due to him on
the account. The rate of payment for the work was the same as
that which is usually made to sawyers; and Morris considered, and
acknowledged, that the work that he performed for the principal
superintendent, was without reference to the recommendation for
the ticket of leave that had been promised when the work was
finished.</p>
<p>Although I cannot positively infer, from the evidence, that
the motive of the principal superintendent in obtaining the
ticket of leave for Morris was a reduction in the price of the
work that he did for him; yet it is one of the many cases of
suspicion that are furnished by the concession of such ample
powers of recommendation, and such a large share of confidence to
this individual, by Governor Macquarrie.</p>
<p>Mr. Cox, it would appear, is less delicate in his negociations
with convict labourers; for he has expressly stipulated, with
some of them, that their tickets of leave would be given for the
performance of a given quantity of labour, for which subsistence
only, and no other remuneration, was given.</p>
<p>In Van Dieman's Land, a complaint was made to me, by Mr.
Anthony Fenn Kemp, a retail merchant of Hobart Town, and formerly
a captain in the 102d regiment, that tickets of leave had been
given by Lieutenant-governor Sorrell in a very profuse manner,
and without any reference to the character and conduct of the
parties: the same complaint was also made to me from other
quarters; and I made a particular inquiry into the
circumstances.</p>
<p>By returns, from the secretary's office, it appeared, that 79
tickets of leave, that had been promised by Lieutenant-colonel
Davey, were confirmed by Lieutenant-governor Sorrell on his
assumption of the command in 1817, and that 37 more were granted
by himself in that year; 120 were granted in the year 1818; 227
in 1819; and 47 up to the month of February 1820, the period of
my visit to Van Dieman's Land; making a total of 510 in the space
of three years: of these, no less than 184 were recommended by
the acting engineers, Captain Nairn and Major Bell, either from
length of time in the country, or meritorious exertion in public
service, with good character; 133 had been recommended by their
employers, and their conduct had been certified by the bench of
magistrates; 46 had been recommended by the commandant of Port
Dalrymple; to by the lieutenant-governor himself; and 5 by
Governor Macquarrie; and 29 were recommended for services in
making a road that was undertaken by a contractor; and 7 for
services in Macquarrie Harbour.</p>
<p>Major Bell has stated, that in consequence of the want of
information of the characters and previous conduct of the
convicts, on his succeeding to the situation of inspector of
works at Hobart Town, in the month of June 1818, he required all
those who applied to work for a ticket of leave, to produce, from
the police magistrate, certificates that they had not been
convicted of theft since their arrival in the colony. Very few of
the convicts being able to produce such a certificate, Major Bell
was under the necessity of looking amongst those, who were lately
arrived, and he selected from them, those who, from information,
appeared to have the best characters. They were employed in the
operation of making and improving the road from Hobart Town to
Austin's Ferry; Which, though one of no difficulty, mat was very
important to the settlement; and as no good superintendents could
be found at the time, the expectations of tickets of leave
operated as securities for the good behaviour of the men. Two men
only out of 29, the number employed upon that service, forfeited
their claims to the promised reward, on account of thefts that
they committed.</p>
<p>With a view to ascertain the correctness of this information,
I had reference to the registry of offences committed by the
convicts, and punished by the magistrates; and, by the facility
of reference that Mr. Humphrey's books afforded me, I made an
extract of the names of those convicts who had been punished, and
of the dates of their punishment, and compared them with the
dates of their tickets of leave.</p>
<p>A list of the names, so extracted, was furnished to
Lieutenant-governor Sorrell, to enable him to make such remarks
and explanations as his memory, or reference to Major Bell, might
afford. Upon the return of this list, it appears that very
erroneous certificates must have been given by Mr. Humphrey, the
police magistrate, respecting two cases in which recent thefts
had been committed; and that other offences and misdemeanors must
have been equally unnoticed; for amongst those convicts who were
recommended by Major Bell, two had been convicted of theft in the
space of 12 months previous to the dates of their tickets of
leave, and 16 of misdemeanors and other offences. This want of
accuracy of reference to former convictions is more conspicuous
in certain recommendations of Captain Nairn, of the 46th
regiment, (Major Bell's predecessor), and equally so, in some of
those recommended by individuals, by the assistant surgeon, as
well as those bestowed by the lieutenant-governor himself.</p>
<p>The lieutenant-governor has stated, that in making a rule not
to grant a ticket of leave to a convict employed in the
government works, except on the recommendation of the inspector,
he also leaves that officer a discretion, in determining whether
the convicts whom he recommends have, atoned for the offences
they had recently committed; and certainly there was no officer,
in the whole establishment of New South Wales or Van Dieman's
Land, civil or military, with whom this discretion was so justly
reposed, or was so little in danger of being abused, as Major
Bell.</p>
<p>The principle upon which Lieutenant-governor Sorrell states
himself to have been guided, in giving tickets of leave, is that
of the conduct of the men in the country; having, in few
instances only, any information of their previous history or
life; and although he has not found that the magistrates have
been inclined to favour the short-sentenced men, yet he has
considered that their claims to indulgence increase, as their
servitude draws to a close; and this observation he uses in
defence of those cases in which tickets of leave had been
granted, both by himself and the inspector, after recent
conviction for slight offences. He further states, that it would
have been impossible for him to have adhered to the same rule
that Governor Macquarrie had laid down for himself, in not
granting tickets of leave to any convicts, until after the
expiration of three years of service in the country; for, on his
arrival in Van Dieman's Land in 1817, he found only 400 convicts
of very bad character in the whole settlement, and to whom the
indulgence of a ticket of leave could not, with any propriety, be
extended; and that the price of labour was so high, that few
settlers could afford to obtain it. Governor Macquarrie, it
appears, had not, at that time, resolved to supply the wants of
the settlers in Van Dieman's Land with any portion of the
numerous convicts that continued to arrive in New South Wales;
and it was, therefore, with a view to reduce the price of labour
to the settlers, that Lieutenant-governor Sorrell determined to
make a selection of the best men that he could find amongst the
newly-arrived convicts, and after trying them in the public
works, to give tickets of leave to those who should approve their
conduct to the inspector.</p>
<p>Economy of the expense of subsistence to the government, and
an equalization of the supply of convict labour to the demands of
the settlers, have also had their share in increasing the number
of tickets of leave in Van Dieman's Land. This system was so far
beneficial to the settlement, that it considerably reduced the
price of labour to the settlers in the first instance; but I have
learnt that the demands of the men holding tickets of leave had
become so exorbitant, that Lieutenant-governor Sorrell thought
fit to issue a general notice to the settlers, that in any
instance that became known to, a magistrate, or district
constable, of excessive demand for wages being made, or of their
refusing to accept work at a just and reasonable rate of payment,
the ticket of leave man would be brought forward, and would
forfeit the indulgence of holding it. This condition was formerly
annexed to every one that was issued by Governor king, at a
period when labour was more in demand than it has latterly been
in Van Dieman's Land.</p>
<p>The number of ticket of leave men that have been convicted and
punished at Hobart Town, from the year 1817 to the 30th June
1820, amounts to 135 and 31 tickets of leave were forfeited in
that time; by which it would appear that this indulgence has not
been attended with the same good effects as at Sydney and New
South Wales, and that the previous consideration and estimate of
character has been made to yield too much to claims of colonial
expediency.</p>
<p>In considering the privileges that have been held to accompany
each of these remissions of sentence, it will be more convenient
to invert the order in which they have just been mentioned; and
first, to describe the nature and effect of a ticket of
leave.</p>
<p>It first enables the party to quit the compulsory labour of
government, and to apply his labour to his own benefit in any
district that he may choose.</p>
<p>In New South Wales, from the generally relaxed state of the
police, the residence of men holding tickets of leave has been
little watched, and the only restraint upon them has been that
which was very partially afforded by the Sunday musters. In Van
Dieman's Land, on the contrary, there is no class of persons to
whom the attention of the police is so much directed. They cannot
pass from one place to another, or from one district to another,
without a pass from a magistrate, which is required to be shown
to the magistrate, or chief constable of the district, to which
the individual is proceeding; and he is there enrolled as an
inhabitant of that district, and called upon to attend the Sunday
musters.</p>
<p>With a view to obtain the more regular appearance of the
ticket of leave men, the district of Hobart Town is, for this
purpose, considered to extend to many of the adjoining districts;
and the ticket of leave men are made to come, sometimes from an
inconvenient distance, to attend the muster, which is held on the
first Sunday of the month, and to have their passes renewed.</p>
<p>Some complaints were made to me, of the inconvenience of this
regulation, and the risk to which it exposed property by the
absence of the owner; but considering the number of these men,
and the importance of possessing information of their occupations
and residence, I think that the regulation was both necessary and
useful.</p>
<p>It has been seen that a man, holding a ticket of leave, is
amenable to the demands of government for his services, and to
the magistrates for his good behaviour.</p>
<p>Except in the early period of Governor Macquarrie's
administration, and when a real demand existed for the services
of convicts, for carrying on government works and buildings at
Sydney, this resumption of the indulgence has very rarely taken
place, on that account. The resumptions in New South Wales, on
account of misconduct, have not been numerous; 37 tickets of
leave having been withdrawn in the Sydney districts, from the
commencement of the year 1817 to the end of the year 1820; 15 in
Paramatta, and the neighbouring districts, from the year 1815 to
the year 1820; and one at Windsor, in 1819. The effects of the
system have thus been proved to afford a beneficial restraint
upon the parties upon whom the indulgence has been conferred, and
certainly afford some proof of the discretion with which it has
been granted. A ticket of leave, therefore, may be considered as
an excellent instrument of the reformation of convicts, from the
combined effect that it produces in stimulating their industry,
and of restraining their misconduct It is regarded by them as a
great boon; and it is by wise selection, and careful reference to
past conduct in the colony, and not to circumstances of an
accidental it nature, that the value of this indulgence can be
preserved.</p>
<p>A convict holding a ticket of leave is, and always has been,
allowed to bring actions in the civil courts against free
persons; and an instance of late date occurred, in which a
convict, holding a ticket of leave, recovered the sum of
25<i>l</i>. in damages for an assault and battery committed upon
him, by a military officer of the garrison.</p>
<p>Under this protection it is, that the convicts holding tickets
of leave become c traders; and that they have improperly, in some
instances, been allowed to keep public houses in the names of
their wives who happened to be free.</p>
<p>The liberty to bring and defend actions in the courts, that
has been given to convicts holding tickets of leave, has been
granted by the courts upon a mixed principle of equity and
convenience; for, as the convict is allowed by his ticket of
leave to appropriate the profits of his industry to his own
benefit, and to enter into dealings with others in the exercise
of that industry, it is considered only just that he should t be
allowed the means of securing what he has earned, as well as of
recovering what he has lent.</p>
<p>The effect of a conditional pardon is, to remit the sentence
under which the party was convicted and transported to New South
Wales, on condition of his remaining within the limits of the
territory during the remainder of the term. It has lately been
permitted to convicts holding such remissions to remove from New
South Wales to Van Dieman's Land; and, to some of them, to embark
in ships to New Zealand, on the recommendation of Mr. Marsden,
upon security being given for their return. They have also been
permitted to engage in the fisheries carried on along the coast;
but not to clear out generally on fishing voyages.</p>
<p>The terms of a general pardon have already been stated; and
until very lately, it had been generally considered in the
colony, that the legal effect both of absolute and conditional
pardons, conferred by the governor of New South Wales, was to
restore the parties to all the privileges of free subjects. This
doctrine, as far as regarded the governor's absolute, pardons,
was distinctly recognized by Mr. Justice Field, in a case that
came before him, in the supreme court at Sydney, on the 27th
August 1818, wherein, after deciding that a lease made by the
colonial government to the wife of a convict, vested in the
husband, and that no power but that of the crown, could take away
from a person who had been attainted of felony, either real or
personal estate; he declared, that the King's or the governor's
absolute pardon would of course restore him to his competency,
unless his conviction had been for perjury under the statute of
the 5th Elizabeth, c. 9, and to his blood, as to after-acquired
property, or after-born children. It must here be remarked, that
these observations of Mr. Justice Field, upon the effect of the
King's or governor's pardon, did not exactly apply to the facts
of the case before him; but appear to have been made for the
purpose of expressing his individual opinion upon a legal
question that might very possibly occur, and that he felt to be
of general importance to the colony of New South Wales. The
report of the case appeared in the Sydney Gazette, and, like all
other reports of the proceedings of the supreme court, were
furnished to the editor of the gazette, by Mr. Justice Field
himself.</p>
<p>This opinion continued to prevail in the colony (and perhaps
was the only legal opinion that was ever given upon that subject
in it) until the decision of the ease of Bullock <i>v</i>. Dodds,
by the court of King's Bench, became known.</p>
<p>This case was determined in Hilary term, and in the 59th year
Of his late Majesty's reign; and it was decided, that the
attainder of a person who had been trans; ported to New South
Wales for life, and whose sentence had been absolutely remitted
by the governor of New South Wales, but who name had not been
inserted in any general, pardon under the great seal, is
pleadable in bar to an action brought by that person subsequent
to the remission; and that the utmost effect of an absolute
remission of sentence by the governor, such as this had been, in
favour of the plaintiff Bullock, was to entitle the party at a
future time to have a new and distinct pardon, to operate from
that time, without any relation to his original transportation,
or to the act of remission; and, in the mean time, to stand as a
person with a sign manual pardon. The statute of the 30 Geo. III.
c. 47, had already declared, that the governor's absolute and
conditional remissions of sentence were to have this effect only;
but the second clause of the statute directed, that the governor
or lieutenant-governor of New South Wales should, by the first
opportunity, transmit to one of His Majesty's principal
secretaries of state, a duplicate, under the seal of the
government, of every instrument by which the time or term of
transportation of any felons, or other offenders, had been
remitted or shortened; and that the names of such felons and
other offenders, which should be contained in such duplicate,
should be inserted in the next general pardon which should pass
under the great seal of Great Britain, after the receipt of such
duplicate by one of His Majesty's principal secretaries of
state.</p>
<p>As this direction has never been literally complied with in
New South Wales, no one of the many persons who have received
absolute and conditional pardons front the respective governors,
stand in any better situation than that of the plaintiff Bullock;
and are therefore subject to this, as well as other disabilities,
arising from attainder for felony. These disabilities having been
fully described by the learned lord chief justice of the court of
King's Bench in delivering judgment, I beg leave to submit them,
in this place, to your Lordship's consideration:&mdash;"An
attainted person is considered in law as one <i>civiliter
mortuus</i>; he may acquire, but cannot retain; may acquire, not
by reason of any capacity in himself, but because if a gift be
made to him, the donor cannot make his own act void, and reclaim
his own gift: and as the donor cannot do this, and the attainted
donee cannot enjoy, the thing given vests in the Crown by its
prerogative, there being no other person in whom it can
vest."</p>
<p>The same consequences were held to affect personal property;
and that even a pardon under the great seal did not, without
words of restitution, enable the grantee to sue upon an
obligation which had vested in the King by his attainder.</p>
<p>An event of very late occurrence brought the effect of this
decision to the general notice of the inhabitants. Various
disputes having arisen between Mr. Francis Oakes, the chief
constable of Paramatta, and Beale the gaoler of that place, they
preferred mutual accusations before a bench of magistrates
assembled there on the 1st January 1820, and at which Mr. Justice
Field presided. Oakes charged the gaoler, who was a convict, with
the imprisonment of three free men for more than one night in the
gaol, for the purpose of extorting fees from them; and Beale
charged Oakes, with assaulting him in the execution of his duty,
and impeding and intimidating the petty constables from
apprehending drunken free men, and lodging them in gaol. It
further appeared, that Oakes had been guilty of addressing
indecorous and disrespectful language to Mr. Hannibal M&#145;Arthur,
the magistrate of the district, on a preceding day, and a
statement of the circumstances attending it, was made by Mr.
M&#145;Arthur, in his place, to the magistrates. In this statement Mr.
M&#145;Arthur detailed the previous conduct of Mr. Oakes, and his
refusal to make that apology for his former disrespect, which he
had been enjoined to do. He further stated to the bench, that he
had received several charges against Beale the gaoler from Mr.
Edward Eager (who was then present), and that he was at a loss to
know in what character Mr. Eager came forward to prefer such
charges against the gaoler, except from a combination with the
vindictive feelings of Oakes, under the pretence of redressing
injuries, of which the parties themselves did not complain, and
for which, if they chose, they had another remedy; and that
although he personally wished that the charges that he had
received from Mr. Eager, might be investigated, yet he trusted
that the magistrates would pause, before they entered into an
investigation of the propriety or impropriety of former
convictions, or of punishments inflicted by a single magistrate,
for the preservation of good order in the town. Mr. M&#145;Arthur
further stated that he had proof of the attempts made, both by
Eager and Oakes, to excite the persons who had been punished to
come forward and complain.</p>
<p>Upon this statement the magistrates determined that the
charges transmitted by Eager to Mr. M&#145;Arthur should be read; and
having examined William Jones, who was one of the persons who was
stated to have been unjustly detained in gaol by Beale, for
rioting and drunkenness in the streets; and having found by his
declaration, that he had never sent for Oakes or Eager to
undertake his cause, but that they had sent for him, the
magistrates determined that Eager should not be heard.</p>
<p>Mr. Oakes was then called upon to proceed in his charges
against the gaoler, but declined undertaking that duty himself,
and requested that Mr. Eager, who attended for him, might be
heard in his behalf. It is here necessary to state that Mr.
Edward Eager was one of those persons that had hem prevented from
practising in the courts of New South Wales, by your Lordship's
determination, signified to Governor Macquarrie in the year 1817,
and that since that period he had acted as deputy provost marshal
to Mr. Gore, and had subsequently embarked in trade, and lived in
Sydney. He attempted to address the magistrates in support of his
charges, but was stopped. Mr. Justice Field then delivered the
judgment of the bench, and took occasion to animadvert with great
severity of language upon the conduct of Eager. He declared that
his interference in the vindication of the pretended injuries of
poor and dissolute men, who had been justly punished for their
offences, was as illegal as it was uncalled for; that he had
incurred the penalties of being a common barrator; and that, by
encouraging emancipated convicts to resist the authority of the
gaoler in apprehending them, merely because he was a convict
clothed with that authority for beneficial purposes, and from the
difficulty of finding free persons to execute it, he had made an
attempt to raise the standard of sedition, and to excite
rebellion in the colony; crimes for which he might be justly
committed or trial, for be sent out of the colony by the
governor. Eager twice requested to be heard, but was ordered to
be silent; and the bench proceeded to investigate the charges
preferred by Mr. Hannibal M&#145;Arthur, as well as those preferred by
the gaoler against Oakes; and the evidence upon the charges
having been gone through, and Mr. Oakes having declined to make
any defence as Eager was not permitted to be heard; Mr. Justice
Field recapitulated the evidence, and in delivering the opinion
of the court, again made allusion to the conduct of Eager,
declaring that Oakes had betrayed the trust of his office, by
lending himself to the vindictive designs of certain criminals,
and of a factious party in the colony, and made some personal
allusions to the abuse that Eager made of the good talents with
which he had been blessed, for the purpose of misleading other
men from the line of their duty.</p>
<p>The report of these proceedings was furnished to me by the
magistrates clerk, and it is signed by Mr. Justice Field, as
chairman; but as I was present myself at the meeting, and as the
proceedings had not only attracted much notice, but afterwards
became the subject of a very unpleasant discussion in the colony,
I have thought it right to submit to your Lordship my own
statement of those particulars upon which the subsequent
discussion arose.</p>
<p>Eager made no observations in the court upon the judgment
delivered by Mr. Justice Field; but at the first sitting of the
governor's court, wherein Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde presides, and
where actions to the amount of 50<i>l</i>. only can be tried, he
filed two plaints against Mr. Justice Field; one for slanderous
words uttered and spoken by him upon the occasion to which I have
just now alluded, and the other for fees, which Eager alleged to
have been illegally demanded and taken by Mr. Justice Field, as
judge of the supreme court, of him, as a suitor in that court. To
these actions Mr. Justice Field resolved to alledge the attainder
of Eager for felony; and, tiling an affidavit of his belief of
that filet, stated, that although his sentence had been
absolutely remitted by the governor of New South Wales, yet that
he verily believed his name had not been included in any general
pardon under the great seal; and, as he was aware that nothing
but the production of an office copy of the record of the
conviction of the plaintiff could be admitted as evidence of that
fact, he prayed the court for time to obtain it, for the purpose
of pleading his attainder in the two actions. A motion was made
to this effect, and a petition to the judge advocate was filed by
Mr. Moore, Mr. Justice Field's solicitor; and after Mr. Eager had
been heard against the motion, and Mr. Moore in reply, the
governor's court determined that leave should be given to Mr.
Justice Field to produce an attested copy of the record of Mr.
Eager's conviction for felony in Ireland, and that the actions
that he had brought should be stayed till the record was
produced.</p>
<p>Mr. Eager then addressed a petition to Governor Macquarrie,
stating the circumstances of his case; that he had offered to
admit the fact of his attainder, and that it had been refused,
and that he had been denied justice and right in the governor's
court.</p>
<p>Governor Macquarrie declined any interference on this
occasion, and the actions were left in the state just
described.</p>
<p>In a very short time afterwards, Mr. Eager brought a qui tam
action against a foreign merchant, of the name of Le Mestre,
residing at Sydney, for the penalties he had incurred by trading
in one of His Majesty's colonies, under the statute of 12 Charles
II, c. 18, s. 2.</p>
<p>Mr. Eager, as well as a few other merchants of Sydney, had
engaged in speculations for the importation of tea from Bengal
but not having the means of importing it direct from China, which
Mr. Le Mestre possessed through an American interest at Canton,
and perceiving an intention on the part of Mr. Le Mestre and two
other French merchants to establish themselves in Sydney, and to
continue the trade, he determined to bring this action, in which,
if he had succeeded, Mr. Le Mestre must have been ruined, and Mr.
Eager would have secured the profits of the tea trade. Mr. Le
Mestre therefore applied to the supreme court for time to produce
the record of the plaintiff's conviction for felony, upon an
affidavit, that stated his belief of that fact, and that the
action, urn which he had a good defence upon the merits, was
brought against him from invidious motives. This application was
resisted by Mr. Eager, who was permitted to appear, and to
address the court with an argument that he had prepared, and
which is to be found in the Appendix. At his request I was
present at the hearing of this motion.</p>
<p>In giving the judgment of the court, Mr. Justice Field quoted
much at length the judgment given by Mr. Justice Bayley, in the
case of Bullock <i>v</i>. Dodd, and the judgment of Lord Chief
Justice Abbott, on the second argument in that case, where the
effects of attainder are explained; and the application of this
state of the lam to the case of Bullock, who, in the memory of
most of the persons present, had received Governor Macquarrie's
absolute pardon, for the purpose of enabling him to proceed to
India on behalf of Mr. Simon Lord, very forcibly impressed itself
upon the minds of many of the remitted convicts who attended.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Field then enlarged upon the precarious nature of
the pardons given by the governors of New South Wales, if His
Majesty should not be hereafter advised to include their names in
a general pardon under the great seal; and considered that a
right had been reserved to the King, by the last clause of the
Act of the 30 Geo. III, c. 47, of determining whether the conduct
of the remitted convicts, subsequent to the remission of their
sentences by the governors of New South Wales, had been such as
to justify His Majesty's final confirmation of them. He
considered that the action brought by Mr. Eager (whom he
designated as a convict of ten years standing) against Mr. Le
Mestre, was not one that ought to receive any favour front the
court; that by the policy hitherto adopted in the colony, the
emancipated convicts, who were themselves the creatures of
remission and indulgence, had been permitted to carry on trade,
and had become wealthy and prosperous, and that it did not become
them now to resort to the severe penalties of a law so old as
that of the 22 Car. II, c. 18, and a practice of such doubtful
policy, as that of excluding foreign merchants from trading in
British colonies, with the view of creating a gainful monopoly
for themselves.</p>
<p>The learned judge then expressed his doubts whether, under the
terms of the charter, the court could entertain an action that
was not strictly between party and party; and as he had no reason
to believe that Governor Macquarrie had authorized the action on
his own behalf, and as it was highly penal in its consequences to
the foreign merchants (a description of persons whose conduct had
been perfectly inoffensive), he declared it as his opinion that
leave should be given to the defendant for twelve months time to
plead, to enable him to procure a certified copy of the record
and judgment of the plaintiff's conviction of felony, which would
be absolutely necessary to sustain the plea of his conviction and
attainder. In this opinion the two members of the court
concurred; and the rule, for a twelve months time to plead, was
made absolute in favour of the defendant Mr. Le Mestre.</p>
<p>This decision, together with the result of the actions
commenced by Mr. Eager against Mr. Justice Field, produced some
sensation amongst the leading members of the remitted and
pardoned convicts, who had never contemplated till then the
operation of such disabilities; and Mr. Eager (who had been
defeated by them in his attempts to inflict a punishment on Mr.
Justice Field for the severity of his rebuke before the
magistrates at Paramatta, and in his last attempt to secure to
himself the profits of the tea trade) found no difficulty in
impressing the minds of the settlers of his own class with the
more extensive injuries that these decisions would produce upon
the property and rights of all the members of this numerous body,
including in it as well those persons whose terms of
transportation had been remitted, as those whose terms had
expired; industriously and artfully imputing to Mr. Justice Meld
a personal motive for the sanction that he had given in his
judicial capacity, to a doctrine that had protected him as a
suitor.</p>
<p>Mr. Eager was joined by Mr. Redfern, the Rev. Mr. Fulton, Mr.
Meehan, Mr. Simon Lord, and the principal superintendent of
convicts William Hutchinson, Samuel Terry and several others,
styling themselves emancipated colonists, and presented a
petition to Governor Macquarrie to be allowed to hold a meeting
at Sydney, for the discussion of the grievances under which they
were found to labour, and to consider of the best means of
obtaining a remedy. The governor consulted me upon the propriety
of granting permission to hold this meeting, and as I felt
impressed with the hardship of the situation in which the
principle of the law, but not the practice, had placed them, I
stated to the governor that I saw no objection to the meeting,
provided that the persons who were likely to take the lead in it
would furnish him previously with a copy of the resolutions that
they meant to propose, and that Mr. Eager should pledge himself
that no allusion should be made to the conduct of Mr. Justice
Field, in taking the benefit of the law in the actions that had
been brought against him. The governor having obtained this
promise, as well as a copy of the resolutions, I proposed certain
alterations in them, which appeared to me to generalize the
subject of the proposed discussion, and to prevent their
application to the circumstances that had so lately occurred.</p>
<p>Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde and Mr. Justice Field were at this
moment tiling their departure for their circuit to Van Dieman's
Land, and having observed that Governor Macquarrie's permission
had been given to the emancipated convicts to hold their meeting,
for the discussion of a subject that might reflect upon the rules
they had lately promulgated for the guidance of their judicial
conduct, addressed a letter to Governor Macquarrie, in which,
after stating that if they had been previously consulted by the
governor on the subject, they could have demonstrated to his
excellency that none of the civil privileges of the persons
styling themselves "emancipated colonists", had been affected by
any rules of law that they had laid down; but that now, as they
were about to leave the colony for some time they took leave to
apprise the governor of their objections to the meeting, not with
any view of opposing a measure that he had approved, but to
absolve themselves from the responsibility of any consequences
that might arise from convening such a meeting when the courts
would necessarily be closed.</p>
<p>The judges having done me the honour to transmit to me a copy
of this letter before they sent it to the governor, I returned it
to them with an answer, in which, after expressing my regret that
they had not been previously made acquainted with the governor's
intention of permitting the meeting to be held, or of the
restrictions that had been imposed upon it, I informed them that
I did not concur in the apprehensions they had expressed, of any
mischievous consequence to the public peace. Governor Macquarrie
replied to the judges letter, and observed, that if he had
conceived that the resolutions to be proposed at the meeting, or
the meeting itself, could have been interpreted into any mark of
disrespect to the judges, he should certainly have consulted
them; but, persuaded as he felt of the serious grievance under
which the emancipated convicts now laboured, he felt it his duty
to sanction their meeting for the purpose of seeking relief from
the injurious consequences of the present state of the law. To
this letter Mr. Justice Field replied, and the governor again
answered; but as Mr. Justice Field has requested me to lay this
correspondence before' His Majesty's government, beseeching it
likewise to deprive Mr. Edward Eager of the privilege of settling
in the colony of New South Wales, I take the liberty of
submitting it more particularly to your Lordship's attention.</p>
<p>The meeting of the emancipated convicts, convened by notice
and under the authority of the Provost marshal, took place at
Sydney on the 23d January 1821. It was numerously attended, and
Mr. Redfern being called to the chair, Mr. Eager addressed them
at some length, concluding with proposing the resolutions: they
were unanimously carried, and were inserted in the Sydney Gazette
of 27th January 1821; two others being added for the appointment
of an agent to convey the petition to England, and to conduct
there all matte: relating to it; and for raising a hind to defray
all necessary expenses. A complimentary resolution was then
passed, expressive of the gratitude of the emancipated colonists,
to Governor Macquarrie, the encouragement and protection it had
always afforded them, and of their assurance that his
excellency's name would live in the grateful remembrance of
nations yet unborn, as the founder and promoter of benevolent
principles, and the best interests of the colony and the mother
country. The governor was also requested to transmit the petition
of the emancipated colonists to his Majesty, in such manner as he
might deem proper.</p>
<p>I was informed by Mr. Campbell, the provost marshal, that the
meeting was conducted with decorum, and that the promise that had
been given to Governor Macquarrie was strictly observed. Since I
left the colony I have been informed that meetings of the
emancipated colonists continued to be held, by the permission of
Governor Macquarrie, at the house of Mr. Eager, in Sydney, for
the purpose of promoting the objects of the petition; and that
subscriptions have been raised amongst the class of emancipated
convicts, to enable Mr. Eager and Mr. Redfern to proceed to
England as their agents.</p>
<p>These persons were well aware, that in reporting to your
Lordship upon the state of the convicts in New South Wales, the
hardships of their situation would not be forgotten by me; but as
the part that I had taken on the appointment of Mr. Redfern to
the magistracy was well known, and some pains had been taken to
impress the minds of the persons of Mr. Redfern's class, that I
entertained strong prejudices against them, no communication of
their intentions or wishes was made to me, and I had no other
knowledge of them except that which I collected front private
channels, or from an inquiry of Mr. Eager himself.</p>
<p>I have learnt, that upon another occasion that has occurred
since my departure, an action of the same nature as that which he
brought against Mr. Le Mestre, was brought against Mr. Manigault,
a French merchant, and that it was defeated by the same
means.</p>
<p>A report of this trial was published in the Sydney Gazette of
May 26th, 1821, and I have no reason to doubt that it was
inserted by the authority of Mr. Justice Field.</p>
<p>The purport of the judgment is precisely the same as in the
preceding action; but the learned judge now stated, that "before
the court entertained so highly penal an action as this, and
applied this statute in favour of tradesmen who were themselves
only the creatures of remission of sentence, they ought to be
fully satisfied that they had the power to try a qui tam action,
a public penal action, two-thirds of the fruits of which are to
go to the King and the governor, under a charter, the object of
which is, to make sufficient provision for the recovery of debts,
and determining of private causes between party and party in New
South Wales. The court doubted this in the case of Eager v. Le
Mestre, and it was for that reason, they granted the defendant
time to procure from Ireland, a copy of the record of the
plaintiff's conviction of felony, and not with a view of applying
to this colony the strict law of England, upon the right of
convicts to sue, as had been misrepresented in one of a string of
false and absurd resolutions in the Gazette, at the head of which
Mr. Justice Field saw the plaintiff's name. The judge said, that
if he had been in this part of the territory at the time those
resolutions had appeared, he would have punished their author for
a contempt of court, in making this The fact was, that except in
such an oppressive case as this, and in which the powers of the
charter were doubtful, no convict had ever been prevented from
suing in the courts of the colony, nor ever should be, while Mr.
Justice Field had the honour of sitting there; and it appeared by
the returns of the court to the Commissioner of Inquiry, that
one-third of the plaintiffs in the supreme court had been
convicts."</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Field, since my arrival in England, has forwarded
to me, through the office of your Lordship, certain extracts from
judgments given by him, upon the power of the crown to take away
property forfeited by attainder for felony, or for
non-performance of conditions; and it would appear that they were
reprinted at Sydney, for the purpose of correcting a
misrepresentation that had gone abroad in the colony, respecting
their effect and import. In these extracts, I find one of the
cases that respecting already had the honour of submitting to
your Lordship, (Doe on the demise of Pearce against Jenkins) in
which the learned judge declared, that a government lease to the
wife of a convict, transported to New South Wales, vested in the
husband. I also find, that the observation made by the learned
judge, in his first report of the same case in the year 1818, as
to the effect of the governor's pardon, is omitted; and that it
is now limited to the King's absolute pardon. Without commenting
upon the learned judge's motives for making this omission, I
would beg leave to observe, that it would have been more prudent
in him to have abstained from the application of such epithets as
"false" and "absurd" to the resolutions of the emancipated
convicts, until he had been able, upon cooler reflection, to have
taken a more accurate view of the grievances of which they
complained.</p>
<p>The nature and effect of the governor's pardons, or remissions
of sentence, had, until the year 1820, been considered, by all
those who held them, as effectual in restoring all privileges of
whatsoever kind that they had lost by conviction; but when they
suddenly learnt, that by the state in which these pardons had
been suffered to lie, they were liable, even in England, to be
impeded in the recovery of their rights by judicial process, if
their opponents chose to take advantage of such a defect; and
that in New South Wales the courts would exercise a discretion in
permitting or not permitting that defect to bar the recovery of
them; they then felt that their appearance in a court of law was
no longer an exercise of a right to which they had been restored,
but an effect of judicial grace.</p>
<p>Having been absent, in Van Dieman's Land, when the first
action was brought against Mr. Justice Field by Mr. Eager, for
slander, and for demanding illegal fees, I had not an opportunity
of communicating with him, upon the subject of his application to
the governor's court for time to plead the conviction and
attainder of Mr. Eager. He did me the honour to write to me
privately, to know my sentiments upon the subject; and I took as
early an opportunity as my distance from New South Wales at the
time afforded, of expressing to him my conviction of the
inexpediency of such a measure on general grounds, and of the
disapprobation with which His Majesty's Government would view any
counteraction of that system of participation of civil rights and
advantages, which they had thought fit to introduce into the
colony in favour of emancipated convicts, and which had further
obtained the approbation of a Committee of the British
Parliament.</p>
<p>My letter did not reach Mr. Justice Field until after he had
made his application to the governor's court, or I think it
likely, from the respectful deference that he has on all
occasions shown to my opinions upon colonial subjects, that he
would have been induced to have met Mr. Eager's actions upon
their merits, and not put a negative upon them by pleading his
disabilities.</p>
<p>It was not sufficient for Mr. Justice Field to state, in his
vindication of this new principle, that its application had been
rare in the colony; that he had himself allowed emancipated
convicts to recover in one-third of the actions brought before
him; that he had declared that the personal property of the wife
of a convict vested in him after attainder; and that the eases in
which the principle had been applied were such only as merited,
such application, either in checking the malicious revenge or the
grasping ambition of an emancipated convict, and that they never
would be applied but in such cases: this class of persons could
not feel satisfied with such a state of things.</p>
<p>They have magnified in their resolutions, as your Lordship
will hereafter see, their relative importance in the colony, as
well as the extent of the grievance under which they found
themselves to labour; but they felt that they had just reason to
ask relief from disabilities, as new as they were alarming, and
which, though applied for the first time only in the case of Mr.
Eager, might be made equally applicable to the whole class. It
having been declared from high authority in England, that a
member of this class, that had been absolutely pardoned by
Governor Macquarrie, had no property in a bill of exchange, and
could not sue upon it there, on account of the same defect in his
remission of sentence that was known to vitiate all theirs, it
was very natural that the emancipated convicts of New South Wales
should seek for relief against a consequence that might operate
against themselves, and against the extent and hardship of which
they saw no effectual or certain guarantee: they saw that the
power exercised by the courts in New South Wales was in its
nature discretionary, and applied to the circumstances of each
particular case, as the court might choose to regard them, upon
the affidavits of one of the parties; and although they had
reason to acknowledge that this discretion had never been
exercised to the injury of the colony, yet they naturally dreaded
a state of things which left their property, both real and
personal, at the mercy of a discretionary power, in whomsoever
that power might be vested.</p>
<p>As the number and description of persons, whom this
declaration of the law thus affected, appeared to be
misunderstood, it may tend to simplify the nature of any future
regulations, if I take this opportunity of stating what I
conceive to be the legal effect of the punishment of
transportation upon the several classes of offenders.</p>
<p>The legislature, in passing the statute of the 4 Geo. I. c.
11, adopted the policy that had been introduced in the earlier
times of Charles the Second, in transporting felons to the
colonies, and making their punishment there subservient to the
purposes of colonization; and the same statute also defined the
classes of offenders for whom this new punishment seemed to be
particularly intended. The first class consisted of persons, who
having been convicted of felony without benefit of clergy, were
liable to be whipped or burned in the hand, or had been ordered
to any workhouse; secondly, of persons who should be thereafter
convicted of grand or petit larceny, or any other felonious
stealing, and who should by the law be entitled to the benefit of
clergy; thirdly, of offenders, who having been capitally
convicted, had received the King's pardon on condition of
transportation for a certain term, and had complied therewith;
fourthly, of persons convicted of receiving or buying stolen
goods, knowing them to be stolen. After reciting these several
classes of offenders, the statute declared, that where any of
them should be transported, and should have served their
respective terms, such services should have the effect of a
pardon, to all intents and purposes, as for the crime or crimes
for which they were transported and shall have served. The
statute of 8 Geo. III. c. 15, contains a similar provision in
favour of persons convicted of capital offences, whose sentences
have been first respited and afterwards commuted under a general
or special condition of transportation, and who have been
transported and served their respective terms according to the
tenor of those conditions; to offenders, therefore, who come
within any of the descriptions above-mentioned, the punishment of
transportation, when completed by service, affords the advantages
of the highest pardon that is known to the law; viz. a statutable
pardon.</p>
<p>It would appear, however, that some doubt had been entertained
by the legislature, whether this effect extended to cases of
petty larceny; for it was considered necessary, for the purpose
of restoring persons convicted of that crime to their competency
as witnesses, to pass the statute of 3 Geo. III. 3, c. 35, and to
place them in that respect on the same footing on which persons
convicted of grand larceny stood.</p>
<p>With regard to these, however, and to the other classes of
offenders named in the acts of 4 Geo. c. 11, and 8 Geo. III, c.
15, it is understood that transportation being the specific
punishment ordained by the legislature, as a substitute for the
former one of burning in the hand and whipping, which was itself
substituted for the system of purgation before the ordinary, all
the effects that these punishments were held to possess in
removing disabilities, are now attributed to that of
transportation.</p>
<p>In the periods that have elapsed since the passing of this act
of 4 Geo. I, c. 11, many statutes have been passed, by which the
punishment of transportation is specifically appointed and
enacted for offences that were not known to the common law of
England, and are not within the provisions of this statute; and
as the punishment of those offences is not followed by the same
remedial effects that have been declared to belong to those that
are, there will be found many persons in New South Wales who are
liable to certain disabilities produced by a conviction for
felony, from which other and greater offenders are by operation
of law, as well as by the before mentioned statute, exempt. If
this view of the subject be correct, there will thus appear to be
a difference in the degrees, or rather in the effect of
transportation as a punishment, that does not seem to have been
intended by the legislature. The leading principle that this
species of punishment seems to inculcate is, that of
proportioning, in the first instance, the terms of transportation
to the nature and extent of the crime, and of making their
duration to depend upon the effect that they had produced upon
the morals and conduct of each criminal.</p>
<p>The power of limiting the terms of punishment was conferred
upon the governors of New South Wales by the statute of 30 Geo.
III, c. 47, and to them was also impliedly given the power of
determining at what period a criminal had become a proper object
of remission, and what conditions should be annexed to it. The
service of the terms of transportation was declared, in certain
cases, to have the effect of removing all the consequences of the
punishment; while those, whose terms of service or sentences were
remitted, were to stand in the situation of persons holding a
pardon under the King's sign manual. The condition of persons
attainted for felony and holding a pardon of this nature, has
been already submitted to your Lordship's consideration; and I
will now only add a few observations upon its effects upon their
property, until it be confirmed by a pardon under the great
seal.</p>
<p>These effects upon the possession and transmission of real
property, were, as I have already had occasion to observe, both
mistaken and magnified by the emancipated convicts, in the
resolutions that were passed at their meeting. By the statute
that passed in the 54th of his late Majesty's reign, c. 145,
corruption of blood, and forfeiture of real property, were taken
away in all, cases except those of treason or murder; and
although by the state of the law, as to convicts whose sentences
have been pardoned and remitted by the governors of New South
Wales, and as explained by the learned chief justice of the court
of King's Bench, in the case of Bullock <i>v</i>. Dodds, an
attainted person may acquire property, but cannot retain it, yet
the title to that property is good against every person, except
the crown, where it vests, by reason of its prerogative; and the
utmost that the crown can now do, would be, to take the profits
of the real and personal property, during the offender's life. It
is upon this principle, that Mr. Justice Field held, that as long
as the crown left a convict's property untouched, he should
consider him to be entitled to dominion over it, and that he
should leave the crown to set aside any disposition of it, that
might deprive the King of his rights. It appears, therefore, that
that portion of property only, that is hell or has been
transmitted by emancipated convicts, guilty of treason or murder;
and of persons attainted for felony, Prior to the passing of the
statute in the 54th of his late Majesty's reign,(27th July 1814)
is liable to the forfeiture created by attainder, and is not
inheritable by their children. The property of attainted
convicts, acquired by them since that period, remains subject to
the claim of the crown for profits during their life-time, but
has been, and is now, descendable to their children.</p>
<p>Your Lordship will observe that this defect of title arises
solely from the claim and prerogative of the crown, and that
therefore the titles of persons in the situations just described,
or of those who have purchased from them, are not impeachable on
other grounds. It may be questionable even whether, as to grants
of land made to attainted convicts by its own authority or by its
own servants, the crown even can reclaim its own gifts, where
there is no breach of any condition annexed to them; but as all
the consequences arising from attainder, as affecting the
property of convicts acquired by them, both previous to the 27th
July 1814 and subsequent to it, may be removed by a pardon under
the great seal, having special relation to rights acquired and
transmitted in the interval, no legislative authority will be
necessary for effecting that purpose.</p>
<p>With reference, however, to the future condition of
emancipated convicts, it is material to consider whether the
disqualifications that are now found to belong to attainted
persons, upon whom pardons under the sign manual have been
bestowed, are such as were contemplated by the terms of the
statutes that authorized them, or are consistent with the
condition in which it is expedient that an emancipated convict
should be placed, for the purpose of fully enjoying the benefits
of a state of freedom.</p>
<p>The acts of the 4 Geo. I, c. 11, made provision only for the
service of convicts transported to the plantations of North
America, as well as for the prevention of their return to England
before the expiration of their terms of service, but did not look
to their subsequent condition in the colonies or the possibility
of their acquiring property them. The act of the 30 Geo. III, c.
47, expressly recites that it would tend greatly to advance the
design of sentences of transportation, if the governors or
lieutenant-governors for the time being had a power of remitting
or shortening the time or term for which felons may have been
transported, in cases where it should appear that such felons
were proper objects of the royal mercy. A power is there given to
the King to authorize the governors or lieutenant-governors to
remit absolutely or conditionally the whole or any part of the
time or terms of the sentences of felons, and that such
instruments of remission should have the like force and effect as
if his Majesty had signified his royal intention of mercy under
the sign manual. A pardon under the sign manual has been stated
by a great legal authority to imply only a preparation for
pardon, and if that construction be applied to the situation of
convicts whose sentences are remitted by the governors or
lieutenant-governors of New South Wales, it would seem that the
interval that must necessarily elapse between the period in which
it is bestowed by them, and that in which it is confirmed by the
crown, must form an intermediate state of civil existence that is
certainly not consistent with a state of freedom; and, when its
peculiarities are known, not very productive of contentment to
the person placed in it, or of the benefit which the statute
contemplated. Although, therefore, the words of the statute of
the 30 Geo. III. c. 47, are only directory, and point out the
manner in which effect is to be given to the acts of remission of
the governors and lieutenant-governors of New South Wales; and
although there may have been an intention of reserving an
exercise of the royal discretion upon them, yet there could have
been none of suspending the benefits intended to be conferred on
convicts who received the governor's pardon and continued to
reside in the colony.</p>
<p>By the instructions that have been furnished to the several
governors of New South Wales, they were directed to give grants
of land to convicts after remission or expiration of their terms,
and they thenceforth have been permitted to assume the condition
of proprietors of land and cultivators, under the influence of
these regulations. The convicts in New South Wales, whose terms
of sentence have been remitted, have become numerous, and a few
have become opulent, especially those who have established
themselves as traders and public-house keepers in the towns.</p>
<p>By the last muster taken by the magistrates of New South
Wales, in the month of October 1820, and by the muster taken in
Van Dieman's Land, there were 3,617 male and female convicts
whose terms of sentence had expired; 182 whose sentences had been
absolutely, and 1,170 whose sentences had been conditionally,
remitted; making a total number of 1,352 remitted convicts, out
of a population that amounted to 29,407 souls.</p>
<p>As I felt it to be a matter of importance to ascertain the
quantity of land held by this description of persons in New South
Wales; and as the form in which Governor Macquarrie determined
that the muster of 1820 should be taken by the magistrates, did
not afford the means of ascertaining this point, I requested the
magistrates, in a circular letter that I addressed to them
previous to the muster, to take an account of the quantity of
land held by persons in each district, whose sentences had either
expired or had been remitted. These returns were transmitted to
me; and I find that out of 389,288 acres of land, granted and
held in New South Wales, 22,238 acres were either granted to or
held by the class of remitted convicts; and 48,906 by convicts
whose sentences have expired.</p>
<p>They constitute the middle and lower order of settlers in the
colony, and having in general begun with very limited means, they
have been obliged to depend solely upon the return of the produce
of their land. It is through their means, therefore, that the
greatest quantity of grain has been produced for the consumption
of the colony; and it is also through their want of means, and
their want of capital and skill, that the productive powers of
the soil, that is not generally a fertile one, have been
exhausted by repeated cropping. Many of the original grantees are
now either reduced to a state of dependence upon their creditors,
or are seeking for opportunities of redeeming themselves, by
removal to some new and more productive tracts. There are,
however, exceptions to these cases, and they consist of the
emancipated convicts, who, during servitude, were enabled to
accumulate property, and acquired a knowledge of agricultural
occupations, and who obtained grants of some portion of the rich
lands in the valley and plain, that are fertilized by the
inundations of the rivers Nepean and Hawkesbury.</p>
<p>In these tracts, I observed some decent habitations that had
been established by emancipated convicts; but there were also a
great many, that were within reach of the inundations of the
river, the owners of which persisted in exposing themselves and
their property to its ravages, that they might indolently reap
the benefits of the fertility that it left behind. The tracts on
the shores of the river Hawkesbury have thus afforded support to
many of the most worthless and indolent cultivators, and the
produce has been diminished in quantity, as well as quality, by
the successive cultivation of the same grain and by the admixture
with it of rank weeds and wild vetches. Another fertile district,
that of Airds, has been occupied principally by small settlers or
the class Of emancipated convicts, who are proceeding in the same
course of rapid exhaustion of their lands, without regard to
their future means of support.</p>
<p>The return made from this district is not so full or
satisfactory as it ought to have been; Mr. Redfern having
declined to make any return to the magistrates of Liverpool, to
whom I addressed my circular letter, and having wilfully
misinterpreted the consideration for his feelings, that had
dictated that mode of communication, into a studied neglect of
his authority as a magistrate. Mr. Redfern, at the date of my
letter, continued to fill the office of magistrate; and I
conceived that it might be painful to him to record his own name
and circumstances amongst the emancipated convicts of his
district, more especially as I understood that at the annual
musters taken by the governor, the same consideration had been
shown to Mr. Redfern, Mr. Lord, and others of that class. The
number of acres, therefore, held by Mr. Redfern under grant and
lease, and amounting to 2,620, is not inserted in the return of
the Airds district. This farm, and two others in the same
district, belonging to remitted convicts, form exceptions to the
general observations that have been made respecting their system
of cultivation. The farm of Mr. Redfern, though not consisting of
good land, has begun to exhibit the improved system of English
husbandry, and reflects credit upon the intelligence and spirit
with which the expensive operation of clearing the land from
trees has been conducted.</p>
<p>It is necessary to offer to your Lordship a few remarks upon
the return of land held by persons that had been convicts, and
made in the Sydney district, first observing that the name of Mr.
Simon Lord, who returned in the general muster an amount of 4,363
acres, as held by him in the year 1820, was not inserted as it
ought to have been, in the return that I requested of the lands
belonging to persons of his class. Amongst the names of persons
who are free by servitude in the Sydney district, is that of
Samuel Terry, holding 19,000 acres of land, of which 17,000 were
obtained by purchase, and 2,000 by grant from Governor
Macquarrie. The name of Charles Thompson, holding 1,300 acres
obtained by purchase; of Thomas Clarkson, holding 2,150 acres, of
which 2,000 are obtained by purchase; Roberts, holding 700 acres
by grant; Thomas Rose, holding 930 acres; Daniel Cooper, holding
400 acres; Solomon Levy, holding 1,000 acres by purchase; and
Robert Waples, 200 by the same title, though only in possession
of a ticket of leave.</p>
<p>The first of these individuals. Samuel Terry, was transported
to the colony when young. He was placed in a gang of stone-masons
at Paramatta, and assisted in the building of the gaol. Mr.
Marsden states, that during this period he was brought before him
for neglect of duty, and punished; but by his industry in other
ways, he was enabled to set up a small retail shop, in which he
continued till the expiration of his term of service. He then
repaired to Sydney, where he extended his business, and by
marriage increased his capital. He for many years kept a public
house and retail shop, to which the smaller settlers resorted
from the country, and where, after intoxicating themselves with
spirits, they signed obligations and powers of attorney to
confess judgment, which were always kept ready for execution. By
these means, and by an active use of the common arts of
overreaching, ignorant and worthless men, Samuel Terry has been
able to accumulate a considerable capital, and a quantity of land
in New South Wales, inferior only to that which is held by Mr.
D'Arcy Wentworth. He ceased at the late regulations, introduced
by the magistrates at Sydney in February 1820, to sell spirituous
liquors, and he is now become one of the principal speculators in
the purchase of investments at Sydney, and lately established a
water-mill in the swampy plains between that town and Botany Bay,
which did not succeed. Out of the 19,000 acres of land held by
Samuel Terry, 140 only are stated to be cleared; but he possesses
1,450 head of horned cattle, and 3,800 sheep.</p>
<p>The return of Mr. Lord having been omitted, it is necessary to
add, that he is possessed, either by purchase or grant, of 4,365
acres of land, of which 200 are cleared. He has not devoted much
of his attention to agriculture, having, with great industry and
success, established manufactories of cloth and hats, that have
been very beneficial to the colony. In this point of view Mr.
Lord's exertions have certainly been creditable, and deserve
praise.</p>
<p>The other persons whose names are mentioned, consist (with the
exception of Solomon Levy) of licensed publicans in Sydney, who,
by the great profits attending that trade, or by availing
themselves of the same advantages as Samuel Terry, of concluding
profitable bargains with their customers, have been able to
realize property in land. These persons, however, as well as
those of the same description in the other towns of New South
Wales (and of which there are many) are not resident cultivators
of the soil. They receive the produce of the inferior settlers at
a low rate in exchange for their goods, and watch opportunities
of obtaining admission for it into the King's stores, where they
receive the regulated price that is there given for it.</p>
<p>Pressed by their necessities, as well as by their love of
excessive indulgence, and unable, from the want of proper
buildings, to secure their produce when gathered, these
thoughtless persons hasten to Sydney at the first opening of the
King's store, and if unable to obtain immediate admission for
their grain, or baffled in their expectations by the confusion
and want of regulation that prevails there, they sell it to the
publicans, who are the only persons in the colony that posses the
means of storing grain. They then buy dearly a few articles of
the first necessity, which, with a supply of spirituous liquors,
are soon consumed, and leave them in poverty and wretchedness,
until the return of the next harvest brings with it a diminished
return of produce, but affords a repetition of the same
improvident indulgence.</p>
<p>The returns from the districts of Evan, Castlereagh, Windsor
and Wilberforce, show, that as many as 240 of the remitted
convicts in these districts are only tenants under other
proprietors. This mode of tenure is either a consequence of the
system already described, by virtue of which the impoverished
owner of a grant of 50 acres of land, becomes at length the
tenant of an avaricious landlord, who is his creditor; or it is
the consequence of a system, by which the owners of the larger
For find it convenient to get their land cleared free of expense
to themselves. For this purpose, they let small portions of it
upon what are called clearing leases for five or seven years, to
convicts who have been in their service, or who upon their
recommendation, have received remissions of sentence. The tenant
clears as much land as his means will allow during the term, and
subsists upon the produce, or occasionally works for hire to the
landlord. From the mode of cultivation that is pursued by these
tenants (and they cannot afford to make it better) the land is
returned into the hands of the landlord in an exhausted state at
the end of the term; and it is generally found, that this
description of settlers, when placed at a distance from the
towns, and not having the opportunities or means that their
neighbourhood affords, of a ready market, gradually decline in
circumstances, and then resort to the plunder of their neighbours
for their support.</p>
<p>In the neighbourhood of Paramatta, the most favourable
instances that have occurred of the effect of transportation, are
exhibited in the persons, as well as the properties, of three men
who were transported in the early periods of the colony; their
names are George Best, John Pie, and William Mobbs: they have
been distinguished for the propriety of their conduct in the
colony; for their respectable characters; and for their
unremitting industry: and the state of their farms and
habitations attest, in a conspicuous manner, the united effects
of good conduct in New South Wales, and of industry, when well
applied.</p>
<p>The result of my inquiries, respecting the number of such
instances of reform amongst the class of settlers to which these
persons belong, was not satisfactory.</p>
<p>With a view to obtain information upon this subject, I
addressed myself to the Rev. Mr. Cartwright and the Rev. Mr.
Cowper, for the returns of those districts with which they had
been particularly acquainted; to the magistrates of the other
districts, in which a chaplain had not been constantly resident;
and to Mr. Hannibal M&#145;Arthur at Paramatta, in consequence of the
absence of the Rev. Mr. Marsden. The information returned by the
Rev. Mr. Cartwright, respecting the characters of the emancipated
convicts of those districts in which he resided so long, is
entitled to the greatest weight, as well on account of the
character of the reverend gentleman himself, as from the
opportunities that he had of observing those of the resident
settlers, both in the performance of his clerical and magisterial
duties.</p>
<p>Out of this class of the population in the districts of
Windsor, Richmond, Wilberforce, Portland Head and Pitt Town,
amounting to 149 persons, settled on their own property, and
generally married, he has returned the names of 83 persons, whom
he considered to be industrious and well disposed, living upon
their property and educating their children.</p>
<p>In the town of Sydney where the Rev. Mr. Cowper has resided,
and where he has always paid the most unremitting attention to
his clerical duties, and from his extensive charitable
occupations has had frequent intercourse with the families of the
inhabitants, and many opportunities of being acquainted with
their characters, he has made the following observation: "With
regard to character and respectability, allow me to observe,
briefly, that while some are, in general, well conducted persons,
concerning many, little that is praiseworthy can be advanced:
though on their property resident, they are poor and immoral;
there is not much religion amongst the best, and the far greater
part have not the appearance of it."</p>
<p>In the evidence of both these gentlemen is to be found, the
general opinion entertained by them of the conduct of the
emancipated convicts.</p>
<p>The Rev. Mr. Cartwright conceives that the instances of moral
conduct, arising mesa from an improved moral sense, are very
few.</p>
<p>The Rev. Mr. Cowper believes, that although there are
instances of temporary reform, yet that there are very few in
whom he could say, that there was an entire change of principle.
In proof of this last remark, I would observe, that two
emancipated convicts who had lived, at Richmond for some time,
and had enjoyed good characters in the estimation of the
magistrates, as well as in that of Mr. Cartwright, and would have
been included as such in his return, were tried and executed at
Sydney in the year 1820, for cattle stealing, in which they were
found to have been for a long time extensively engaged. From the
remaining districts of New South Wales, 147 names of emancipated
convicts have been returned to me, as those of persons living
respectably on their own property; but I cannot place as much
confidence in them, as in those from the Windsor district, to
which I have just referred. It would thus appear, that out of
4,376 remitted convicts, including those whose terms have
expired, and who are now resident in New South Wales, 296 may be
considered as respectable in conduct and character; and
considering one-half of those at Sydney in the same light, (but
subject to the observations made upon them by the Rev. Mr.
Cowper) this number will be increased to 369.</p>
<p>In Van Dieman's Land, the moral character and the general
condition of the emancipated convicts appeared to me to be still
lower than what it fairly may be taken to be in New South Wales.
The circumstances that I have already detailed, respecting those
settlements, will account for much of this result; and I now will
add one other cause, which is to be found in the inferior
character of the class of free persons in that settlement,
compared with those in New South Wales. Two conspicuous
exceptions, however, to this general estimate of the character of
the emancipated convicts, exist in Van Dieman's Land, in the
persons of Mr. G. Gatehouse, and Mr. Wade, formerly the chief
constable at Hobart Town. Both of these individuals have
recommended themselves by their good conduct; and one of them,
Mr. G. Gatehouse, was for some time a partner in a
mercantile-house at Hobart Town, conducted by Mr. Anthony Fenn
Kemp, formerly a captain in the 102d regiment.</p>
<p>After retiring from this connection, he has devoted his
attention to one of the most useful undertakings that has yet
been commenced in the colony, that of establishing a brewery.</p>
<p>This object recommended itself to my attention on so many
grounds, that I ventured to request of Lieutenant-governor
Sorrell, on behalf of Mr. Gatehouse, every facility in the
assistance of workmen that it was in his power to afford; a
request pi that was very cordially met by the
lieutenant-governor.</p>
<p>Mr. Wade was in possession of a well cultivated farm and
decent habitation at Pittwater; and was as remarkable for his
vigorous pursuit of the bush-rangers, when he was chief
constable, as for the severe losses he sustained from them.</p>
<p>These circumstances will enable your Lordship to form a
judgment of the actual condition of this class of the inhabitants
of New South Wales; and to determine upon the expediency of doing
that, which in other circumstances, would be only an act of
justice, namely, of removing the legal disabilities, under which
they yet may be found to labour, either as arising from the
operation of law, or from the imperfect execution of it.</p>
<p>I believe it to be the opinion of of the persons in New South
Wales, who have been conversant with the management of convicts,
that the hope of possessing property, and of improving their
condition, and that of their families, affords the strongest
stimulus to their industry, and the best security for their good
conduct. Many of these persons think that the preparatory periods
of labour, and the hardships and privations that belong to it,
and that constitute a state of punishment and one of trial,
should be much longer than Governor Macquarrie has made them;
they also think, with justice, that the emancipations that he has
given to opulent convicts, for services purely of a personal
nature, without reference to the past, and only as an
encouragement for their future conduct, have both lowered the
value of reward, and abridged the period that ought to precede
it; but I was not able to discover any argument or statement,
upon which (after the policy had been so long acted upon, of
giving property, in the nature of grants, to persons whose free
agency was in most other respects admitted) the expediency, or
the justice, could be made appea r, of withholding any longer
from the same persons, those rights that are essential to the
free enjoyment, the exchange, or the transmission of property, as
long as they remain in the territory of New South Wales.</p>
<p>In the intercourse that has hitherto subsisted, between the
free classes of the inhabitants and the emancipated convicts, a
defect of title, either to convey land, or to maintain personal
actions, has, until the events before mentioned, never occurred.
Lands have been purchased of them by free people, and they have
bought and sold lands from and to each other with a confidence in
the goodness of their titles, that has been quite reciprocal.
Although, therefore, I shall be prepared to state to your
Lordship certain limitations for the future acquirement and
disposal of land in the colony, by emancipated convicts, yet I am
at a loss how to make any other exceptions now to the completion
of their rights as to the property they have acquired, and that
they now possess; or to their right of maintaining personal
actions in the colonial courts, than that which should follow,
from the conviction of them, or any of them, in the colony for
felony, subsequent to the periods of their emancipation.</p>
<p>I have reason to believe that these cases are not numerous;
but as an accurate investigation of them required more time, and
a more tedious reference than I am enabled to bestow, or to make,
it will be necessary, in ease your Lordship should approve of
this exception, to require an accurate statement to be made to
you, of the condition and property of all the emancipated
convicts that have been convicted in the criminal courts in New
South Wales, subsequent to the period of their emancipation.</p>
<p>Although there are unquestionably, amongst the emancipated
convicts, a great many that have been suspected of committing
crimes since they received their emancipations, and whose reform
is still more problematical; yet such were the varieties of
opinion that I found upon this subject, either arising from
prejudice and personal feeling, or from the general opinion
entertained by the free classes of the indelible nature Old
effects of conviction, in those who have once suffered it, that I
cannot venture to make any such report to your Lordship of those
suspicions, as might furnish grounds for a positive act of
disqualification.</p>
<p>Such, until the occurrence of the events that I have now
detailed, were the presumed effects of the several pardons and
conditions of the emancipated convicts in New South Wales. I will
now shortly state the admission to society that has been given to
a certain number of them.</p>
<p>Until the assumption of in January 1810, by Governor
Macquarrie, the emancipated convicts (amongst whom, for the sake
of convenience, I include also those whose terms had expired)
had, with two exceptions, been excluded from general society.
Those two persons, consisting of Lieutenant Bellasis, and the
Rev. Mr. Fulton, were admitted to the society of Governors King
and Bligh. The situation and circumstances of one of them has
been already mentioned, and the other, Lieutenant Bellasis, was
an officer of the East India Company's service, who had been
transported from India for fighting a duel, in which his opponent
was killed. He was also appointed aide-de-camp to Governor King,
and acting engineer.</p>
<p>With these exceptions, I have been repeatedly informed, that
the exclusion of convicts from the society of the free classes,
had been uniformly adhered to by the governors of the colony; and
that the civil and military officers were in the habit of
exacting from the emancipated convicts, the same species of
respect as they had yielded in their former state of
servitude.</p>
<p>Whether Major-general Foveaux, in recommending several of the
emancipated convicts to the notice of Governor Macquarrie on his
arrival, had explained the view that he took of the policy of
admitting into society those whose conduct had merited that
distinction, or had recommended it to the adoption of Governor
Macquarrie, I cannot with any certainty determine; if it were so,
the recommendation would appear to have been at variance with his
own practice and principles, as manifested in his former conduct
towards them, as well as in the restrictions that he laid upon
those, who had practised as solicitors in the courts of the
colony, during the period in which he took an active part in its
administration. The terms of the order in which their exclusion
was pronounced are so strong, and they are so entirely opposite
to the principles by which Governor Macquarrie afterwards
professed to be guided, in the controversy that took place upon
the subject between himself and Mr. Justice Bent, that I think it
right to quote them at length. The order was published in the
Sydney Gazette of 28th August 1808, and is to the following
effect:</p>
<p>"Lieutenant-governor Foveaux has learned, with equal
indignation and surprise, that men who have been prisoners in the
colony have so far forgotten their former condition, as to
obtrude themselves into the courts of justice, in the character
of counsellors and advocates. Determined to prevent the
continuance of a practice, as injurious to decency as it is in
fact destructive of justice, Lieutenant-governor Foveaux feels it
incumbent upon him to forbid any person from presuming to
interfere with causes pending before the courts, without an
especial license from him for that purpose; and to apprise those
who have been convicts, that a disobedience of this injunction
will be punished in the most exemplary manner."</p>
<p>The individuals alluded to in the order, were George Crossley
and Michael Robinson.</p>
<p>Soon after the arrival of Governor Macquarrie, and the
appointment of Mr. Thomson and Mr. Simon Lord to the magistracy,
their introduction to the society of government house took place.
They were also invited to the regimental mess of the 73d
regiment.</p>
<p>The introduction of Mr. Redfern took place at the same period,
and was followed by the same consequences. The circumstances of
this person's situation have been already adverted to; and the
only remaining persons upon whom the same distinction has been
conferred, consisted of James Meehan, Richard Fitzgerald, Michael
Robinson, and Francis Howard Greenway. The first of these persons
was transported in the year 1800, for an offence committed during
the rebellion in Ireland, and that was not of a serious nature.
He was, on his arrival, assigned as servant to Mr. Grimes, the
surveyor-general of the colony, and continued, after the
departure of that gentleman, to fill his situation till his
return in the year 1806. After that period he assisted Mr. Grimes
in the business of the department, always taking a most active
and laborious part in it; and upon the resignation of Mr. Grimes,
Mr. Meehan was appointed acting surveyor-general by Governor
Macquarrie, and continued to act ill that situation until Mr.
Oxley, who now tills it by the appointment of your Lordship's
predecessor in office, arrived in 1815 to supersede him. At that
period Governor Macquarrie bestowed upon Mr. Meehan a new
situation, of inspector of roads and bridges, and collector of
quit rents, with a salary of 136<i>l</i>. 17<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.
payable from the police fund, equal to that which he receives
under the parliamentary grant, and equal to that of the principal
in the office, Mr. Oxley.</p>
<p>In the performance of his duties as deputy surveyor-general,
Mr. Meehan has been active and intelligent; and is justly
esteemed skilful in those of a subordinate and practical nature.
He has not however the advantage of any scientific acquirements,
and is more to be intrusted in the operations of practical
mensuration, than in those of delineation or general
surveying.</p>
<p>In the performance of the duty of inspector of roads and
bridges, or rather in the non-performance of them, I shall have
to submit some remarks to your Lordship, respecting Mr. Meehan,
which I will not now anticipate. I will at present observe, that
I did not become acquainted with any instance of corruption in
this officer, although no one has enjoyed larger opportunities of
profiting by it than he has done. Mr. Meehan has, during the
whole period of Governor Macquarrie's administration, been much
trusted by him; has enjoyed the most frequent access to his
society on all occasions; and has been much more referred to and
consulted, in the distribution of land, than Mr. Oxley.</p>
<p>Michael Robinson (the circumstances of whose case, and
conviction for writing a threatening letter, have acquired for
him some celebrity) was transported to the colony for life in the
year 1798. He was permitted to practise in the courts as an
attorney; but having incurred the displeasure of Governor King
when sitting in the court of appeal, he was sent to reside in
Norfolk Island. On returning to Sydney, he again practised in the
courts, and was one of those persons who were recommended to
Governor Macquarrie on his arrival, both for his local knowledge
and his intelligence in business. He was then appointed chief
clerk in the office of the governor's secretary, and received his
free pardon in the year 1811. He continued in the same office
until the year 1820, and was then appointed to that of deputy
provost marshal. During the same periods Michael Robinson has
been employed by Governor Macquarrie in copying his dispatches to
your Lordship, in consequence of the various and more important
avocations of Mr. Secretary Campbell, in resorting to and
extracting the original documents in his office, and preparing
copies of them for transmission. The official and even
confidential situation to which Michael Robinson was thus
admitted, together with his good conduct, appeared to Governor
Macquarrie to give him a claim, to admission to the society of
government house, on public occasions, when he has been permitted
to recite to the company assembled there, on the celebration of
the birth days of their late Majesties, certain odes of his own
composition, complimentary to the occasions, but eminently
praising the virtue of clemency that had so much distinguished
their late Majesties' reign, and that had led to the
establishment of New South Wales as a colony, and had made it an
asylum for unhappy convicts. These odes of Michael Robinson have
always concluded with a pointed compliment to the clemency and
virtuous example of Governor Macquarrie.</p>
<p>In one instance only did the conduct of this individual, who
it must be observed has for several years filled a highly
responsible situation under Mr. Secretary Campbell, come under my
notice. An original letter, addressed to him by an emancipated
convict, named Lam, and which is to be found in the Appendix, had
been produced before the magistrates at Paramatta, by Hodges, an
inhabitant of that place, in consequence of some resentment that
he entertained against him. This letter had been written by Lara,
for Hodges, when they were upon terms of friendship, for the
purpose of inducing Michael Robinson to assist him in procuring
an absolute pardon, which he had understood had been transmitted
to New South Wales from your Lordship's office, and which he
supposed had been mislaid, or forgotten, in the office of Mr.
Secretary Campbell. The contents of the letter from Lara to
Robinson are curious; and as they were upon terms of great
intimacy, furnish a suspicion that the modes of accelerating the
dispatch of business in the secretary's office, were not of the
most respectable kind. Relying upon the strength of Lara's
recommendation, it appears that application was made Robinson by
Hodges, and a friend of his, a dealer in Sydney of the name of
Cooper, who was to have given security for the payment of a sum
of money to Robinson, in remuneration for his trouble in looking
for, and obtaining, the pardon, when it should be found; but on
hearing that shorter methods of procuring an emancipation were
open to him, by obtaining recommendations to Richard Lewis, to be
allowed to send his horse and cart to work upon the Bathurst
road, Hodges abandoned this search after the general pardon, and
obtained his emancipation in the manner that was formerly
adverted to, in treating upon that subject.</p>
<p>With this exception, which only amounts to a suspicion of what
might have been done by Robinson, in performing one of the duties
of his office, I never heard any thing to the prejudice of his
honesty; and I have heard many testimonies given of the general
attention, and respectful demeanour, with which he acquitted
himself in situations that were strongly calculated to encourage
in him an insolent and unbecoming deportment.</p>
<p>The next of the persons mentioned, that have been admitted to
the society of government house, by Governor Macquarrie, was
Richard Fitzgerald, a person whose situation and conduct have
been before adverted to. I think it necessary, however, to
observe, that the good conduct of Mr. Fitzgerald, as agent to Mr.
J. M&#145;Arthur during his absence from New South Wales, had procured
him an admission to the society of his most respectable family,
upon the same footing, upon which a family agent would be
admitted in England.</p>
<p>Mr. Francis Howard Greenway was transported to New South Wales
for 14 years, for having concealed his effects at his bankruptcy.
He had received an education in London, in the office of an
eminent architect, and was afterwards employed at Bristol. Upon
his arrival in New South Wales, in the year 1814, with a strong
recommendation from Governor Philip, Governor Macquarrie gave
Greenway a ticket of leave. His first professional exertions were
made in drawing Governor Macquarrie's notice to the state of the
general hospital at Sydney, and to its defective construction and
he was afterwards employed in making designs for other buildings,
that Governor Macquarrie has since constructed.</p>
<p>His merits as an architect will be submitted to your Lordship
in another place; but Governor Macquarrie's estimate of them led
him to solicit for him the appointment to the situation of
colonial architect; and after the lighthouse at the South Head
was completed, the design of which was very creditable to the
taste of Mr. Greenway, he received a conditional pardon. Mr.
Greenway is allowed to occupy a small house in Sydney belonging
to government, where his family resides.</p>
<p>In referring to the principle, only, by which Governor
Macquarrie has been guided in introducing these individuals to
the society of government house, and in attempting and
encouraging others to adopt it, I can only add the humble
testimony of my approbation to that, which has been so
unequivocally expressed by the Committee of Parliament, that
reported on the state of transportation in 1812; and that which
was expressed in more qualified terms by your Lordship, in your
dispatch to Governor Macquarrie of 3d February 1814.</p>
<p>In an establishment like that of New South Wales, where a
great incentive to reformation and moral improvement seems to be
the possession and enjoyment of property; and where the value of
those blessings must be greatly enhanced by the participation of
the social rights that belong to them in other parts of the
world; any means that could communicate that benefit to those who
were for ever excluded from it in their native country, seem to
be as consistent with the reformatory object of the
establishment, as they are with the principles of humanity.</p>
<p>In adopting this sentiment as a rule of his government, at a
very early period of it, I have no doubt that Governor Macquarrie
was also swayed by that motive, which in a humane mind will
always be a powerful one, of endeavouring to relieve depressed
merit from a state of despondency and subjection. That he found
some of the emancipated convicts of New South Wales in this
state, at his arrival, is true; and that many of the free persons
who disdained any public association with them, kept up a
constrained and private intercourse, whenever they found it
beneficial.</p>
<p>Convinced of the rectitude of his own intentions, and not
probably calculating upon the possible evils of resistance in
quarters where co-operation was absolutely necessary for the
success of his measure; fortified also with the approbation of
the Parliamentary Committee of 1812, Governor Macquarrie has not
only continued his support to the emancipated convicts, by
assisting them in their enterprizes and speculations, but has
manifested on public occasions towards them a larger share of
attention than he has manifested towards those of the free
class.</p>
<p>Mr. Meehan, Mr. Fitzgerald, and Mr. Redfern, are the persons
who have enjoyed the greatest share of his confidence; and
although the governor could not be considered as justly
accountable to any one for the selection that he made of bids
confidential advisee, yet it has been remarked in the colony, and
so often, till at last it has become proverbial, that the surest
claim to the favour and confidence of Governor Macquarrie, was
that of having once worn the badge of conviction for felony. I
state this last circumstance more as a proof of the general
feeling produced by his conduct, than as a proof of what his
conduct has been in the distribution of this or of other favours
that he has it in his power to bestow.</p>
<p>In bestowing upon the emancipated convicts so great a mark as
that of introduction to society, he ought to have been aware that
the same act which might be consolatory to their feelings, and
perhaps to that of their own body, was likely, at the same
moment, to be an act of violence to those of the free population.
In considering this point, I conceive that the governor has
viewed only one of the parties affected by it. He has thought,
and often repeated, that New South Wales was a convict colony;
that it was established for their benefit; and he further has
declared an opinion, which I conceive to be a very erroneous one,
that it was brought to its present state (meaning, of course, a
state of prosperity) by their means. Of the free classes, and of
their origin, as well as of their efforts, he has always
entertained a very unfavourable estimate; and although it is
true, that a small proportion only of those who have arrived in
the condition of free settlers has answered the expectations that
were formed of them, or has done justice to the recommendations
that accompanied them, yet it should always have been remembered
by Governor Macquarrie, that they were the magistrates of the
colony; that it was through their means, imperfect as they were,
that the control of the convicts, the punishment of their
offences, the moral ascendency, was to be maintained; and he
ought not to have forgotten, that although the free settlers had
not latterly engaged in trade, or in commercial speculations, yet
that the best cultivated estates, the greatest quantity of cattle
were theirs; and that the best efforts for the solid improvement
of the colony had been made by them.</p>
<p>I am anticipating in some measure the details of this subject,
which I mean to submit to your Lordship under another head of
observation; yet, I now only advert to them, to show that it was
not altogether prudent in Governor Macquarrie to underrate the
pretensions, or abruptly to wound the feelings, of so important a
class of the community. Those persons, for instance, who have
been acquainted with the merits of the Rev. Mr. Marsden, and Mr.
Simon Lord, and the late Mr. Andrew Thomson, cannot but
acknowledge that an attempt to form an association of such
persons, even in so insignificant a matter as the trust of the
public roads, was a violence done to the feelings of Mr. Marsden,
which could not be compensated by flattering those of his two
future associates.</p>
<p>Equally unsuccessful, and, in my opinion, more inconsiderate,
have been the efforts of Governor Macquarrie to introduce the
emancipated convicts to the notice and society of the military
bodies.</p>
<p>His success with the officers of the 73d regiment is not a
proof against this assertion. The question of the admission of
the convicts into society was then new: Governor Macquarrie was
colonel of the regiment; and Lieutenant-colonel O'Connell, who
commanded it was also favourable to the principle, though he
punished that which appeared to him to be an exception to it, in
bringing to a court-martial Lieutenant M'Naughton, an officer of
his regiment, who had left his guard and joined in play with an
emancipated convict, named Nicholls, a superintendent of
convicts, and afterwards postmaster, who was much eulogized in a
public order by Governor Macquarrie.</p>
<p>Independent of these circumstances, the reports of the
association of military men in New South Wales, with persons who
had been convicts, or whose characters were suspicious, had not
then reached England, and it was only when the 46th regiment left
it, and brought with them to New South Wale the reflections that
had been made upon their predecessors in the public newspapers,
for their association with a certain individual, together with
some very coarse, but pointed references to the circumstances of
his former life, that the feelings of the officers of the
garrison began to be excited against any further association with
the emancipated convicts.</p>
<p>As far as I have been informed of the conduct of
Lieutenant-colonel Molle, he never pretended to dictate to his
officers the line of conduct they should pursue in associating
with emancipated convicts, nor ever manifested, by any vexatious
regimental regulations, his sense of that conduct. The details of
the disputes that ensued between Lieutenant-colonel Molle and his
officers and Governor Macquarrie, upon this subject, are in your
Lordship's possession; [*but I think it necessary to add, that
although they did not originate in, they were much exasperated by
the appearance of an anonymous and scurrilous poem, reflecting
upon Lieutenant-colonel Molle, that was circulated through the
town of Sydney, and thrown into the military barracks.</p>
<p>[* Matter in [] from here, and including the following two
paragraphs, were omitted from the edition printed for the House
of Lords.]</p>
<p>This poem was afterwards acknowledged by Mr. D'Arcy Wentworth
to be the composition of his son, Mr. William Wentworth, after
the departure of this gentleman from the colony, a fact which Mr.
Wentworth declared he was not acquainted with at the time that
Lieutenant-colonel Molle was endeavouring to discover the author,
and was suffering the greatest anxiety of mind from a report that
had been most wickedly and industriously propagated, that the
author of the poem was an officer of his own regiment.</p>
<p>A reproof, for the part that Lieutenant-colonel Molle and his
officers had taken against Mr. D. Wentworth, having been
transmitted to them by your Lordship, I do not consider it
necessary to enter further into the merits of the discussion that
gave rise to it. That which took place between Governor
Macquarrie and certain officers of the 46th regiment, who had, in
the warmth of an address to their commanding officer, cast some
strong reflections upon the conduct of Governor Macquarrie in
calling to his society certain individuals of the class of
emancipated convicts, grew out of the circumstances disclosed by
Mr. D. Wentworth on the occasion just alluded to.]</p>
<p>As the whole of the circumstances of this case has been
submitted to the highest military authority in England, I do not
think it incumbent upon me, at this moment, to consider any other
parts of the question than those which bear directly upon the
general principle that I am discussing, or that throw a light
upon the conduct of Governor Macquarrie in his application of it.
In referring to the charges that he preferred against the
officers of the 46th regiment, your Lordship will find that
Governor Macquarrie does not consider an officer under his
command to have any discretion in accepting or refusing an
invitation to his table; and Major Bell of the 48th regiment,
acting under the influence of the same opinion, considered it as
part of his duty to accept a similar invitation, although he was
well aware that he should meet Mr. Redfern, whose acquaintance,
so injudiciously thrust upon him by Major of Brigade Antill, he
had already declined. Now, although b this rule be universally
admitted to prevail military garrisons, your Lordship will see
that in that, of Sydney, its operation cannot but have an effect,
the reverse of that, which you had so strongly brought to the
notice of Governor Macquarrie, so far back as the month of
February 1814, and which, although he disclaimed in his address
to the officers of the 48th regiment at their first inspection,
yet he afterwards very pointedly adopted, by inviting several
officers of the regiment to meet the individual who was obnoxious
to them, and which invitations the governor knew that they could
not refuse. It may be said, that the officers were not unanimous
in the rejection of Mr. Redfern, and that both that individual
and the Rev. Mr. Fulton had been invited by Colonel Erskine to
the regimental mess of the 48th regiment. I do not consider it
necessary, in this place, to make any observations upon the
motives that may have influenced Colonel Erskine, Major Druitt
and Major Morisset, in cultivating the acquaintance and society
of Mr. Redfern, or upon those that influenced the conduct of the
other officers in declining it. This is a question purely of a
personal nature, upon which both parties had a right to determine
for themselves; but after such a manifestation of their dislike
to Mr. Redfern, as a large majority of the officers of the
regiment had shown, in withdrawing abruptly, and perhaps not very
delicately, from the table at which he was seated, I do not think
that Governor Macquarrie consulted either a prudent regard for
the feelings of the regiment, or for the harmony that it is so
essential to maintain in military societies, by showing to the
officers, that although they might take the liberty of avoiding
an obnoxious individual at their own table, yet that no such
option should be left to them at his. The effect of such a forced
introduction of the principle has been much felt in the 48th
regiment ever since its arrival in the colony, and has produced
in the minds of the officers of that regiment a feeling of
aversion for the person thus forced upon them, and a more fixed
hostility towards the principle itself.</p>
<p>The attempt of Governor Macquarrie to introduce the
emancipated convicts whom I have named into general society, has
not been attended with much better effect. In making this
attempt, it has been a favourite expression of Governor
Macquarrie, and is now adopted by the emancipated convicts
themselves, that by setting an example himself, and encouraging
association with them in others, he is in fact only restoring
these people to the rank in society that they had lost. I cannot
think that this favourite expression and argument of Governor
Macquarrie can have been either strictly used or well considered
by him; inasmuch as there is not one of the persons whom he has
thus admitted to his society, to whom (with the exception perhaps
of Mr. Redfern) it may not be truly said, that such an admission
was a very great elevation. The private and early history of all
of them would certainly not have placed their natural rank in
society above that level which, by their industry, they had
reached. Mr. S. Lord, but for his elevation to the bench of
magistrates, and his admission to the society of government
house, would have continued to be an industrious, intelligent
manufacturer; Mr. James Meehan would have remained an useful
subordinate officer in his department; Mr. Michael Robinson would
have had the satisfaction of printing his odes, instead of being
raised to the titular honours of poet laureat to the government
of New South Wales, and reciting his poetry in the government
house on birth days; and Mr. Fitzgerald would have enjoyed the
fruits of his industry and integrity as an agent, in the just
tributes of respect that were paid to both, by the family of Mr.
M&#145;Arthur, as well as others who bore testimony to them; Mr.
Greenway would perhaps have procured that gradual admission to
society to which his talents, as an architect, would have
entitled him, if the respect due to them had not been impaired by
his habits of negligence and of indulgence.</p>
<p>The elevation of these persons to a rank in society which they
never possessed, and for which, without meaning any reflection
upon them, their manners gave them no kind of claim, has not been
productive to them of the benefits that were contemplated.</p>
<p>It was in vain for Governor Macquarrie to assemble them, even
on public occasions, at government house, or to point them out to
the especial notice and favour of strangers, or to favour them
with particular marks of his own attention upon these occasions,
if they still continued to be shunned or disregarded by the rest
of the company.</p>
<p>With the exception of the Reverend Mr. Fulton, and, on some
occasions, of Mr. Redfern, I never observed that the other
persons of this class participated in the general attentions of
the company; and the evidence of Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde and
Major Bell, both prove the embarrassment in which they were left
on occasions that came within their notice.</p>
<p>Nor has the distinction that has been conferred upon them by
Governor Macquarrie produced any effect in subduing the
prejudices or objections of the class of free inhabitants to
associate with them. One instance only has occurred in which the
wife of a respectable individual, and a magistrate, has been
visited by the wives of the officers of the garrison, and by a
few of the married ladies of the colony. It is an instance that
reflects equal credit upon the individual herself, as upon the
feelings and motives of those by whom she has been so noticed;
but the circumstances of her case were very peculiar and those
that led to her introduction to society were very much of a
personal kind. It has generally been thought that such instances
would have been more numerous if Governor Macquarrie had allowed
every person to have followed the dictates of their own judgment
upon a subject, on which, of all others, men are least disposed
to be dictated to, and most disposed to judge for themselves.</p>
<p>Although the emancipated convicts, whom he has selected from
their class, are persons who generally bear a good character in
New South Wales, yet that opinion of them is by no means
universal. Those, however, who entertained a good opinion of
them, would have proved it by their notice, as Mr. M&#145;Arthur has
been in the habit of doing, by the kind and marked notice that he
took of Mr. Fitzgerald; and those who entertained a different
opinion would not have contracted an aversion to the principle of
their introduction, from being obliged to witness what they
considered to be an indiscreet and erroneous application of
it.</p>
<p>The efforts of Governor Macquarrie have not been confined to
the introduction of the emancipated convicts into general
society; he has attempted it in the formation of the bank of New
South Wales; in that of an agricultural society; and in placing
them upon the judicial seat, as members of the governor's court,
in which the judge advocate presides. Upon the first of these
occasions, it became an object both with Governor Macquarrie and
Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde, who took an active part in the
establishment of the bank, to unite in its favour the support and
contributions of the individuals of all classes of the colony.
Governor Macquarrie felt assured, that, without such
co-operation, the bank could not be established ate for he was
convinced that the emancipated convicts were the most opulent
members of the community. A committee was formed for the purpose
of drawing up the rules and regulations of the establishment, in
which are to be found the names of George Howe, the printer of
the Sydney Gazette, who was also a retail dealer Mr. Simon Lord,
and Mr. Edward Eager, all emancipated convicts, and the last only
conditionally.</p>
<p>Governor Macquarrie had always understood, and strongly
wished, that in asking for the co-operation of all classes of the
community in the formation of the bank, a share in its direction
and management should also be communicated to them.</p>
<p>Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde, in addressing a meeting that was
held at Sydney for the purpose of discussing the measure, had,
generally, stated to them, that every t interest in the bank
establishment would be open to the emancipated convicts. This
declaration was immediately taken advantage of by one of the
leading members of the class, Mr. Edward. Eager, who immediately
became a subscriber of nine shares, trusting always that so large
an interest would secure him a seat in the direction.</p>
<p>On the day in which the resolutions that had been prepared by
the committee were to be submitted to the general meeting, it was
intimated to Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde, by six of those gentlemen
who had been nominated to him as fit persons for the direction,
that Mr. Edward Eager was to be proposed by Mr. Redfern as a
candidate for that office; and four out of those six persons
having declared to the judge advocate their intention of
withdrawing from it at once if Mr. Eager was admitted, the judge
advocate, coinciding with them entirely in the propriety of his
exclusion, introduced a resolution, which now stands the seventh
rule and regulation of the bank, by which it is declared that no
person should be eligible as a director who should not be
absolutely and unconditionally free.</p>
<p>In introducing this resolution to the notice of the meeting, I
am informed that Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde made some severe
reflections both upon the impolicy admitting such persons into
the direction of a commercial establishment, whose names and
condition might justly injure its reputation abroad, as well as
the unpleasant consequences that might happen to free persons
lately arrived in the colony, a and who should become members of
the direction of the bank, from a near association with those
whom they might have possibly and very recently seen, on the
passage to the colony, wearing the badges of conviction; and who,
by means of a conditional pardon and a share in the bank, might
immediately be eligible to a seat in the direction. This allusion
is stated to have given great offence to Mr. Redfern, Mr. Eager,
and the other emancipated convicts who were present. The
resolution, however, was adopted; and Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde,
in submitting it to Governor Macquarrie, found that it was
entirely opposed to the expectations and to the views that he had
formed, as well in favour of the bank, as the opportunity that
its establishment would have afforded of bringing forward the
emancipated convicts. The disappointment, however, that had been
sustained by Mr. Eager on this occasion was soothed by his
receiving from Governor Macquarrie an absolute pardon.</p>
<p>In endeavouring to form an agricultural society, soon after
his arrival in the colony, Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde had
communicated with several of his friends, who fully concided with
him in the importance and utility of such a measure; but being
informed that it would not receive the sanction of Governor
Macquarrie, unless the society should include all classes of the
inhabitants, the judge advocate did not then suggest it to the
governor. He however resumed his project in the year 1819, and
mentioned it to Governor Macquarrie, from whom he received a
private note, in which he found reason to conclude that the
former opinion of his friends was well founded, and that the
system of ballot, by which it was proposed that the members of
the agricultural society should be elected, was not agreeable to
the wishes of the governor.</p>
<p>Upon another occasion also, when the intention of applying to
him was announced in a cursory manner, on the part of a few
individuals, for permission to meet and represent certain
grievances to His Majesty's government, the governor observed,
that as the grievances were general, the meeting should be
general also, and include all classes of the inhabitants. Upon
the signification of this opinion, the meeting did not take
place.</p>
<p>Governor Macquarrie has stated, in answer to the observations
that his conduct on these occasions had excited, that the
representations to him in favour of an agricultural society, or
of a meeting for taking into consideration any public grievances,
were not official, and that he never positively objected to
either. In neither case, certainly, were the applications
official; nor were the objections positive; but in my opinion,
the consequences which are admitted to have ensued from the
private communications, and the mere intimations that took place,
afford the strongest evidence of the powerful effect of Governor
Macquarrie's known opinions, in putting a negative upon all
measures in which the emancipated convicts were concerned, and
that did not strictly agree with his own. It may be alleged, that
the same reason would have operated in their admission to the
direction of the bank of New South Wales, in which Governor
Macquarrie's views were counteracted.</p>
<p>To this it may be observed, that the personal character of Mr.
Eager, and all the influence of Mr. Campbell, the governor's
secretary, who took a leading part in the establishment of the
bank, were quite adverse to his introduction into it, or that of
any other member of his class.</p>
<p>The selection of Mr. Lord, as an assistant member of the
supreme court, on the first arrival of Mr. Justice Field, has
already been adverted to; but another instance occurred in which
the same feeling was displayed.</p>
<p>Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde, with a view to accommodate the
inhabitants of the colony, determined upon holding his court at
Windsor, and Mr. Fitzgerald was appointed by the governor to act
with him.</p>
<p>The situation of Mr. Fitzgerald, as an emancipated convict and
retail dealer in goods and spirits, has already been mentioned;
and Governor Macquarrie was equally insensible on this occasion,
as he had been on others, to the impropriety of introducing to
the judicial seat those who had once been convicts, and who were
necessarily interested in the local trade and dealings of the
lower classes of the inhabitants.</p>
<p>In Van Dieman's Land no instance of this kind has occurred,
except in the person of Mr. G. Gatehouse, whose character and
conduct have already been mentioned.</p>
<p>It was with much surprise that I learnt from
Lieutenant-governor Sorrell, that Governor Macquarrie had never,
either in conversation or in his official communications;
adverted to the opinions that he himself had entertained upon the
subject, or to the instructions with which he had been furnished
by your Lordship. Lieutenant-governor Sorrell, however, in
following the dictates of his own good judgment, and in the
single instance in which he has tried the principle, has effected
more in its favour than certainly has been, or is ever likely to
be, accomplished in New South Wales. Mr. G. Gatehouse has been
invited to the government house at Hobart Town on public
occasions; and I understood from those who were most opposed to
the principle of admitting persons of his class, that his conduct
in society was no less becoming than it had before been exemplary
in private. Lieutenant-governor Sorrell did not think it either
necessary or prudent to admit to the government house, on public
occasions, Mr. Wells, the clerk in his office; and no other
individual of his class holds any official situation beyond the
rank of constable or gaoler in Van Dieman's Land.</p>
<p>After stating these circumstances, I cannot refrain from
expressing my regret, that the question had ever been made so
much one of policy by Governor Macquarrie, as to have been
brought into discussion with those whom he thought his power
might control.</p>
<p>The differences that took place between Governor Macquarrie
and Mr. J. H. Bent, upon the question of allowing these persons
to practise in the courts as solicitors, we reproductive of great
injury to individuals; and although Governor Macquarrie was not
responsible for it, yet it cannot be denied that his interference
with Mr. J. I I. Bent, upon a regulation of the court in which he
presided, was founded upon a great mistake of the extent of his
authority; and I have often been assured by persons who were much
acquainted with Mr. Bent, that it was a sense of this
interference that first excited resistance in him; and that but
for that feeling, leis objections to the admission of convict
solicitors would have yielded to the strong necessity by which
it, was supported, and would have been justified. I do not see
how that necessity would have been relieved by the proposed
introduction of the two clerks of Mr. J. H. Bent, and Mr. Ellice
Bent, as solicitors, as the former would have been obliged to
quit his situation as clerk and registrar of the supreme court;
and the clerk of Mr. Ellice Bent, Mr. Foster, had himself been a
convict.</p>
<p>I have detailed, more at length, the events to which this
question has given rise, because they will enable your Lordship
to form a more accurate view of the manner in which it has
affected the situation of the emancipated convicts, and to
account for those feelings that now separate them from the free
classes. Those of the former have been greatly excited. Their
ambition has been encouraged by the manner in which their
conduct, as well as their exertions, have been viewed and
rewarded by Governor Macquarrie. The same feelings have been
disappointed and exasperated by, the events of the late trials,
to which I have adverted; and no compromise is now to be
expected, as long as they are left in a state of uncertain
dependance upon the discretionary power of any individual for the
enjoyment of the rights to which they have considered themselves
entitled.</p>
<p>Both parties look upon each other as intruders. The free
settlers considering that the rank, as well as the rights of the
emancipated convicts, should be always kept in subordination to
their own: while the emancipated convicts look upon no title to
property in New South Wales, to be so good or so just, as that
which has been derived through the several gradations of crime,
conviction, service, emancipation and grant.</p>
<p>Both parties are equally disposed to depreciate the
pretensions of each other, but I sincerely believe that the great
body of the emancipated convicts do not partake of the ambition
of their leaders, Mr. Redfern, Mr. Eager, Mr. Terry, and Mr. W.
Hutchinson; that they would be satisfied with protection from
oppression and insult, and due encouragement in their
undertakings; and that they feel great indifference about their
admission either to public offices, or to any other rank in
society than that which their own industry and good character
will justly and naturally procure for them.</p>
<p>In referring to the observations that I have now made upon the
condition of the convicts in New South Wales, or such as it has
been during the administration of Governor Macquarrie, your
Lordship will, I hope, find the means of forming a judgment of
the conduct of that officer in the most difficult, and perhaps
the most important part of his duty.</p>
<p>In carrying into effect that part of your Lordship's
instructions by which I was directed to investigate the conduct
of any officer in the colony, however high his rank, or sacred
his character, if, in the course of my inquiry, I conceived such
a measure to be necessary, I trust that I shall be found neither
to have shrunk from that part of my duty, nor to have compromised
the authority, of any individual, by the manner in which it was
performed.</p>
<p>I certainly felt, on several occasions, that much of the
representations that had been made against Governor Macquarrie
had proceeded from a personal feeling of enmity towards him; and
in that which was submitted to your Lordship by Mr. Bailey,
respecting the state of the female convicts at Paramatta, wherein
the governor was charged with neglecting the means of affording
to them both control and lodging, I still perceive the existence
of the same feeling. At the same time, I am compelled to add,
that in not adopting at an earlier period some remedy for the
evils of so gross a nature, and applying to them the means that
he possessed, Governor Macquarrie has manifested in his conduct
an insensibility to those evils, and has given them a permanence,
which is greatly to be deplored.</p>
<p>With this exception, for which I confess that I feel a
difficulty in accounting whatever there is of error in the
conduct of Governor Macquarrie, in regulating the discipline of
the convicts, may be attributed to a humane disposition, that led
him to view their crimes in the light of misfortunes, which they
were to repair in New South Wales by success, rather than as
violations of the law, for which they were to atone to their
country by the bitterness of exile, or by the severities of toil
and privation.</p>
<p>In the dispensation of early indulgences to the convicts, he
has been guided partly by this feeling, and also by the
recommendations of persons in England, in whom he felt he could
place confidence; but he seems to have here forgotten, that
however just on other principles this consideration might be, it
was a violation of that which he professed to make his only rule
in giving rewards, viz. good conduct in the colony.</p>
<p>I will not again repeat the observations that I have already
made respecting the considerations for winch remissions of
sentence have been given; and with regard to the general
employment of the convicts, it appears to me that neither
Governor Macquarrie's views, nor measures, have kept pace with
the rapid increase of their numbers. He has always seemed to fear
the evils of their dispersion more than those of their
accumulation, and has not sufficiently reflected upon the
consequences to the convicts or to the morals of the colony, in
concentrating in the towns such a mass of moral poison, rather
than in diluting it by a gradual dispersion of the convicts in
the remoter districts of the colony.</p>
<p>The evil consequences that might have been expected to arise
from exposing convicts to the time temptations, and to the
contamination of the same vices that had been their ruin in
England, have been realized in New South Wales; while the chances
of reformation, and I may also add the progress of colonization,
have been much diminished and checked by the system that has
always been, and I believe is to this day, pursued, of reserving
the most useful convicts for the service of the government in the
towns, and sending the least useful to the settlers in the
country.</p>
<p>Governor Macquarrie has stated that he cannot consider it a
part of his duty, as governor, to select and separate the useful
from the useless convicts, or to determine, except in special
eases, to whom they are to be assigned: I trust, however, that
your Lordship will find reason to conclude, as
Lieutenant-governor Sorrell has done, that it is not only an
important duty, but that it is perfectly practicable: that it
tends to economize the expense of subsistence to the government:
and that while it adds to the prosperity of the settlers, it also
diminishes the necessity of punishing the convicts for neglect of
work, that, in many cases, may arise from their Incapacity
alone.</p>
<p>Governor Macquarrie has also alleged that he could not
reconcile it to himself to distribute the most useful convicts to
the settlers, and leave the worst to government.</p>
<p>A certain proportion of mechanics might justly have been
retained for the purpose of constructing those buildings that
were much wanted for government, or that were required by the
wants of the community; but I do not conceive that it was
consistent with good policy either to add to the evils of a
crowded and vicious population in the town of Sydney, by
retaining there a large body of the most useful mechanics, or to
augment the expense of mechanical labour to the settlers by such
a parsimonious distribution, as that which has been pursued from
the commencement of Governor Macquarrie's administration to its
close. It has been his misfortune to mistake the improvement and
embellishment of the towns, for proofs of the solid prosperity of
the colonists, and to forget that the labour by which these
objects have been procured, was a source of heavy expense to the
British treasury, and that other means of employment might have
been tried and resorted to, the effect of which would have been
to regulate in a cheaper and less ostentatious form, the progress
of colonization and of punishment.</p>
<p>It is necessary, however, to state in justification of
Governor Macquarrie's conduct, that the same system had always
been acted upon by his predecessors, except during the short
interval of Colonel Johnston's administration; that the penal as
well as the colonial objects of the establishment of New South
Wales had always been in a state of conflict as soon as ever the
necessities and privations that first accompanied it had ceased
or diminished; that many buildings were required for the use of
the colony, and that the belief that has always prevailed, and no
doubt was much cherished and encouraged by the settlers, of the
inexpediency of all attempts to subsist the convicts by the
produce of their own labour, disposed Governor Macquarrie to
employ them in mechanical rather than in agricultural operations,
by which they necessarily were more confined to the towns.</p>
<p>The want of good superintendence has operated as another cause
of the difficulties of controlling the convicts in all
situations, and has added to the risk of placing them in those
that were more remote.</p>
<p>With regard to the discipline of the convicts, your Lordship
will have seen, from the observations and references that I have
made to the several orders of Governor Macquarrie, that a very
commendable degree of attention has been paid by him to the
enforcement of religious duties, wherever it was practicable;
that he has endeavoured to restrain the use and severity of
corporal punishment; and that the instances in which he has
interposed his own authority in ordering it, have been such only
as required summary notice and punishment, and have not been of
frequent occurrence.</p>
<p>In the encouragement of marriage amongst the convicts,
Governor Macquarrie has shown the most anxious disposition to
improve their morals and condition; and in admitting them to
society, if his selection does not appear to have been the most
judicious, or his mode of introducing them the most successful,
he has certainly had to contend with prejudices of a very
powerful kind in the free population.</p>
<p>These prejudices are now, I fear, too deeply fixed to be
removed; and the ambitious feelings of the higher classes of
emancipated convicts have been too long encouraged and cherished,
to expect from them either submission or conciliation. Governor
Macquarrie has thus left to his successor the difficult, and I
way even add, the hopeless task, of bringing back to their proper
and just standard the pretensions of two large classes of the
inhabitants of New South Wales, without giving to tho one party,
a supposed ground of triumph, and without inflicting upon the
other, too large a measure of vexation and disgrace.</p>

<h3>VIII.<br>
<i>Nature of the future Establishments for Convicts in New South
Wales.</i></h3>
<p><small>I HAVE</small> thus endeavoured, and perhaps too much
at length, to detail to your Lordship the various circumstances
affecting the several conditions of the convicts transported to
New South Wales, with a view to enable your Lordship to form an
opinion of the expediency of those measures which, in obedience
to your instructions, I am about to recommend, either for
correcting whatever may be wrong, in the present system, or for
rendering it as applicable as it was formerly considered to be,
to the imposes of punishment.</p>
<p>In perusing the foregoing observations, your Lordship will not
fail to have observed that the great cause of the diminished
effect of transportation has arisen from the increase in the
numbers transported. All the evils of association, the
difficulties of superintendence and control, whether arising from
the extension and variety of the employments, or from the more
laborious duties of the magistrates and superintendents, have
arisen chiefly from this source. It has led, though in my
opinion, not necessarily so, to the accumulation of a great many
convicts in the towns; and it has certainly exceeded, during the
period of the last three years, in New South Wales, and during
that of two years in Van Dieman's Land, the positive demands of
the settlers for labour.</p>
<p>I found these causes in operation on my arrival; and I left
them operating in increased force at my departure. It was with
that impression that I never ceased to express to Governor
Macquarrie, during the whole of my residence in New South Wales,
the uneasiness I felt at the constant arrivals of convict ships,
and the anxiety with which I looked to the departure of the
expedition for the new settlement at Port Macquarrie, which might
tend in some degree to relieve the settled districts of New South
Wales, as well as the government establishments, from the
constant pressure of new arrivals.</p>
<p>The apprehensions entertained by Governor Macquarrie, of a
want of animal food in the colony, alone prevented the departure
of this expedition; but I since have learnt that it was
dispatched on the 18th of March, about a month after I left the
colony.</p>
<p>How far the late emigrations of free settlers to New South
Wales and Van Dieman's Land have relieved the pressure, I have
not any means of determining, I will only beg leave to observe
that the great advantage that is derived from their introduction
depends much more upon their respectability and their means, than
it does upon their numbers.</p>
<p>Another cause that I think will also be apparent, is the want
of a demand for the produce of convict labour.</p>
<p>It was with a view to revive this demand that I was induced,
though at a late period of my stay in New South Wales, and not
without some apprehensions of the consequences of the measure, to
give that consent to the distillation of spirits from grain,
which your Lordship had deemed necessary for its adoption. If the
sanguine expectations formed by Governor Macquarrie and other
persons of the effects of this measure, are at all equalled by
the result, the evils of a restricted demand for the produce of
land and labour in New South Wales and Van Dieman's Land, will be
much and speedily diminished; and the advantages of the
employment and support of a number of convicts, who otherwise
would be a charge upon the crown, will be much promoted. It was
in this view of the subject that I gave my consent to the measure
of distillation of spirits from rain in the colony; and I reserve
for a separate communication the details by which the measure was
to be introduced. Before, however, I proceeded in the examination
of the measures that seemed most likely to correct the evils of
diminished punishment in the colony, I was desirous of obtaining
the opinion of the most experienced persons in it, upon the best
modes of employing convicts, and the most probable means of
stimulating their industry.</p>
<p>It seemed to me to be a hopeless, if it had been an advisable
task, to attempt revive in a peopled district, such as the county
of Cumberland may now be considered to be all the hardships,
privations and severities, that belonged to it in its unsettled
state.</p>
<p>Those hardships, as your Lordship has seen, were sometimes
greater and sometimes less, than were desirable for a state of
punishment of the worst offenders; and although it appeared to me
to be possible to regulate their application, by a removal of the
convicts to a new and distant settlement, yet it was absolutely
impossible to make such an experiment in the old one.</p>
<p>I therefore addressed certain queries to the persons, whom I
thought to be the best informed upon the subject of convict
labour, requesting their opinion upon those kinds, that they had
found most conducive to reform, and those to which they
considered the soil and climate of the colony to be most
favourable. I also inquired of them the most probable methods of
stimulating the labour of convicts, and the possibility of
combining with it, the interest of the master, as well as the
servant. The opinions of the several gentlemen whom I consulted
are to be found in the Appendix; they all concur in the superior
advantages of every kind of agricultural occupation in effecting
the reform of convicts, as well as in affording the best means of
employing them. The opinions which I would more particularly beg
leave to point out 10 your Lordship's notice, are those of the
Rev. Mr. Marsden, Lt. Bell, Sir John Jamieson, Mr. John and Mr.
Hannibal M&#145;Arthur, Mr. Moore, Mr. Cox, the Rev. Mr. Cartwright
and Mr. Howe, and it is from these opinions, combined with my Awn
observation, that I now proceed to submit to your Lordship, the
means of restoring to transportation to New South Wales, as far
as it is practicable in the settled districts, the salutary
effects of punishment, and the more probable means of reform,
considering both in their connection with the present and actual
state of the population.</p>
<p>I will proceed in the same order that I have observed, in
describing the present state, or existing defects of this
punishment, that the reference to the measures of improvement, as
well as the defects they propose to cure, may be more distinctly
kept in view.</p>
<p>I would in the first place propose, that the descriptions that
are given of the convicts in the hulks, should embrace as many
particulars of their preceding history, conduct and employment,
as can be authentically reported there, together with whatever
can be obtained from the gaolers of the different gaols in the
kingdom, from whence they have been sent; these particulars
expressing, in addition to the age, the single or married
condition of the convict, the number of children that he may
save, legitimate or illegitimate, and whether the mother of the
children is left with means of support or is married. I need
hardly add, that the most essential point in the history of the
convicts, is the fact of their having suffered one, or more
preceding transportations, or other punishment.</p>
<p>The document containing these particulars should be addressed
to the Governor of New South Wales, or Lieutenant-governor of Van
Dieman's Land, and every care should be taken to keep the
particulars stated in it, as much as possible from the knowledge
of the convicts themselves.</p>
<p>The directions already issued by the Navy Board, to the
surgeons superintendent of the convict ships, provide for the
reports of the convicts during the passage, and although this
period of trial is but a short one, and that men with the worst
dispositions may for the hope of temporary benefits, during the
passage and recommendation at the end of it, conduct themselves
well, yet I think that the advantages of attending to these
recommendations, provided that they are the strict consequences
of good conduct, are so important in preserving discipline during
the lump, that they ought to be attended to, but to the extent
only, of allowing the recommended convict to go to the service of
a respectable settler.</p>
<p>The next point that occurs, is to prevent as much as possible
all communication between the convicts and the town of Sydney,
either by letter or message, during the period that takes places
between the arrival of the ship and the disembarkation. It
frequently happens, that the convict ships are under the
necessity of coming to an anchor in the space that lies between
the entrance of the North and South Heads, and Sydney Cove, a
distance of five miles. As boats are perpetually plying in this
passage, the prevention of their access, should here be begun,
and any instance in which it takes place should be communicated
by the telegraph, (that I recommended Governor Macquarrie to
erect near the lighthouse) and the arrival of a convict ship bow
the Heads should also be communicated by the same means to the
harbour police, for the purpose of procuring their immediate
attendance upon the ship, from its arrival within the Heads, to
the appointed anchorage between the forts.</p>
<p>The naval officer is the first person that is permitted to go
on board the convict ships, and I will here repeat the
recommendation that I often gave to this officer at Sydney, to
prevent the convicts, by whom his boat is manned, from conversing
with those that are just arrived, and of making his visit to the
newly arrived convict ship as short as possible.</p>
<p>Free passengers who may happen to arrive in the convict ships,
should be allowed to communicate with the shore in the ship's
boats, and not in those that belong to the port. The period that
takes place before the disembarkation of the convicts should be
made as short as may be consistent with the necessary inquiries
into the conduct of the convicts, and their treatment on board;
and it the governor should be absent, the duty of inspection
should be performed by the lieutenant-governor, or the colonial
secretary.</p>
<p>In addition to the precautions that should be taken to prevent
the access or information of the convicts in the town to those on
board, I conceive that no boat whatever, except that of the
superintendent of convicts, and the commissariat boat, conveying
supplies of fresh meat and vegetables, should be allowed to
communicate with the convict ships till the convicts are
disembarked, and that the sentries on board should be made to
challenge all boats that approach within ten yards of the ship. I
have already pointed out the situation in which I conceive it is
most fit they should be made to anchor, and sentries at each end
of the batteries that command this position should equally be
required to give their attention to the prevention of access, and
in cases of wilful disobedience, to fire, by way of intimidation
in the first instance, and afterwards more directly upon the
object.</p>
<p>The first distribution of the convicts affording, in my
judgment, one of the most important means of their reform, the
names of the inhabitants who are in want of servants should be
previously made known to the colonial secretary, either by
themselves, or through the magistrates of the different
districts, with a description of the place of residence of the
settler, and of the servant they wish to have.</p>
<p>It is hardly necessary to observe, that in placing this duty
in the hands of a high and responsible officer, who is now, and
will henceforth be appointed by the Crown, my principal object is
to secure the performance of it from the operation or the
suspicion of corrupt and partial views.</p>
<p>In the selection of convicts, I conceive, that an useful
reference may be made both to the degrees of their crimes, as
well as to their capacity for labour, but that the first should
always preponderate.</p>
<p>Acting upon the information received in this country, and
transmitted to the governor of New South Wales, the convicts who
are described to have the best character, and, who are generally
those that have been accustomed to the operations of agriculture,
should be sent to the large estates of the most respectable
settlers, where the advantages to be derived from good character
will be appreciated, and those of example in the master, and good
conduct in the servant, will be reciprocally felt.</p>
<p>In making the selection of the settlers, the colonial
secretary will be guided by the knowledge that he has it in his
power to acquire, respecting their property and character, from
the magistrates, from the chief constables, from the musters of
at the inhabitants, and from the chaplains. No settler who is now
in possession of a a smaller portion of land than 50 acres, and
that is not employed in the cultivation of gardens, should be
allowed to have a convict assigned to him.</p>
<p>Invidious distinctions may appear perhaps to be made in the
distribution of the best convicts, but the principle upon which
it should profess to proceed, and by which, as far as possible,
it should be guided, should be that of assigning, not only the
convicts with the best character, but those who are most skilful,
to the settlers of the best character, and of endeavouring to
preserve a moral distinction, even in conferring a civil
benefit.</p>
<p>The value of good character and good conduct will then perhaps
begin to be felt, and more seriously considered than it has
hitherto been in New South Wales, both by the convicts and the
settlers; and the expectations that are known to be cherished by
the former in England, of a successful employment of capital in
Sydney, and the practice that ought to be discouraged, of
carrying capital with them, either in the shape of money or
instruments, will be put to an end to, because it will cease to
be profitable.</p>
<p>It is always difficult in England to ascertain. Whether the
property and money conveyed to New South Wales by the convicts,
are the fruits of plunder, or the contributions of friends; but
in New South Wales, every thing in the shape of property that is
to minister to the indulgence of a convict, who is in the
condition of a labourer or that he obtains from any other source
than his labour, should be carefully kept from him on his
arrival. The establishment of the savings bank, by Mr. Justice
Field, to which I have already had occasion to advert, offers the
best means of providing for the deposit of convict funds, and
they should not be allowed to draw them till their condition was
improved by their good conduct, testified by, their masters.</p>
<p>When it is known to the convicts on their arrival, that by
reason of their condition their property will be of no use to
them, and when the advantages of such a place of deposit are
explained by better and higher authority than that of the present
superintendent of convicts, William Hutchinson, the savings bank
at Sydney will be more resorted to than heretofore; and the
excellent principle upon which these establishments are formed,
will be more operative than Mr. Justice Field was inclined to
hope, from the state of the colony in the year 1820.</p>
<p>The next class of convicts to be provided for, are the
mechanics and tradesmen; eat these (and with reference always to
previous good conduct and character, as testified by previous
information, and subject to the reservation I shall hereafter
make in favour of the government) the whole should be left to the
settlers; and in assigning them a condition may be made, that for
every useful mechanic thus assigned, there should also be taken
one or more convicts of an inferior description.</p>
<p>This regulation may appear to bear hard upon the master
workmen or tradesmen living in the towns; but I conceive that the
principle of excluding convicts from the towns is so strongly in
favour of their moral improvement, that it ought not to be broken
in upon by the consideration of the advantage that might accrue
to the master tradesmen, who, otherwise, are not the most correct
in point of moral conduct.</p>
<p>The last and a very large description of convicts, for whose
distribution and employment it is necessary to provide, are the
manufacturers, the artizans, soldiers and sailors, persons of
higher rank in those professions, and mercantile clerks.</p>
<p>As I do not conceive that it is consistent with the policy by
which this country has always been guided, to encourage in any of
her colonies, however distant, the establishment and growth of
manufactures; and as the association that is necessarily produced
by manufactures or any difficult mechanical operation conducted
in them, is always found to diminish the effect of venal
restraint, I think that no encouragement should be given, in the
shape of convict skill and labour, to such manufactures as
interfere with either object, or that require a number of men to
be confined to one spot. The only manufactures hitherto
established are those of Mr. Lord, for coarse cloths, stockings,
and blankets, and two for hats. From the specimens of these
articles that I have brought with me from New South Wales, your
Lordship be enabled to form a judgment of the progress that has
already been made in New South Wales, in the manufacture of a
principal article of export from the mother country, and of the
expediency of discontinuing any encouragement to its further
progress.</p>
<p>A few of the settlers have manufactured cloth and blankets on
their own estates, and tan their own leather; and I conceive that
when the manufacture of these articles is so conducted, it
affords an useful employment to the convicts, and is equally
beneficial to the settlers. To such persons, weavers and tanners
may continue to be usefully and very properly assigned. For the
remainder of these, with artizans, the sailors and soldiers, but
more especially the last, I should propose the following
employments:</p>
<p>Your Lordship is, I believe, aware that the greatest part of
the tract now called the county Of Cumberland, is encumbered with
trees, varying in size and number; but front the horizontal
direction of their roots, always presenting a formidable obstacle
to the first efforts, either of an emigrating colonist or an
emancipated convict. In the early periods of the colony, when the
use of the plough was seldom resorted to, the inconvenience of
cultivating land, from which the roots of the trees had not been
eradicated, was, in some measure diminished by the use of the
hoe. By this system the land was soon exhausted, its productive
powers were not brought into action, and a large portion ok its
surface being inaccessible to the operations either of the hoe or
the plough, remained uncultivated. Mr. Oxley states this
proportion to be at least "one-eighth". The roots of the trees
that yet remain in the lands, imperfectly cleared in the earlier
periods, render the use of the plough, even at the present
moment, expensive and difficult in those lands; and it is the
opinion of the best cultivators, that the soil of the largest
portion of the county of Cumberland requires all the advantages
of good cultivation to make it productive; and that these
advantages cannot be obtained without a previous and perfect
eradication of the roots of trees.</p>
<p>Although some of the higher classes of settlers are impressed
with this conviction, and have begun to clear their new land
entirely, or to perform that operation in the old, vet they find
it to be attended with a heavy expense, which very few are able
to afford, and which the lower classes of settlers cannot. It has
occurred to me therefore, as well as to some of those gentlemen
to whose opinion I have before referred, that it would be
conferring a great benefit on the colony, if parties of convicts
should be allowed to be employed in the first operations of
cutting down the trees and clearing the land of roots; and that
when thus prepared, it might either be put up to sale for what it
would fetch, or that it should be granted to individuals, subject
to the repayment of the cost of the labour incurred in meat and
wheat to His Majesty's stores, and which should remain as a
charge and lien upon the land, and be considered as preferable to
all other claims upon it, until perfect payment.</p>
<p>I will first consider the nature and the effect of this mode
of employing the particular class of convicts for whom I would
destine it.</p>
<p>From the observations I was enabled to make at the
agricultural establishments it Emu Plains and Grose Farm, I found
that there was no description of convicts that could not be
employed in the simple operation of cutting down wood, and in the
subsequent one of burning it off and taking up the roots. It
possesses also this great advantage of effecting a separation of
the convicts even in their work, it being seldom requisite that
more than two should work together. The work is easily and soon
learnt, it is capable of being measured and tasked, and it is
accommodated to the strength of each convict; there is no
complexity in it, and the eye, as well as the ear of the
superintendent will soon direct him to the convicts that are
indolent, or are neglecting their work.</p>
<p>For the sailors and soldiers this labour is particularly well
calculated, as well is the subsequent operation of levelling
inequalities of ground, and putting it in a condition to receive
the plough. The weavers, artizans, and domestic servants may be
gradually accustomed to the same operation, new as it is to them;
and instances of it have already occurred at Emu Plains, by
employing this class of convicts in the lighter work of burning
off the timber, collecting it into heaps, and eradicating the
stumps or roots by piling green sods around and over them for the
reception of fire.</p>
<p>The parties of men employed in these operations should not
exceed forty, having an overseer who should be a free person.</p>
<p>The difficulty of providing lodging for them may be explained
by a reference to what has already been observed respecting the
road parties.</p>
<p>Their huts may be erected in the course of one day, without
any other expense than that of tools and nails; and as this mode
of lodging is not found to be injurious to their health in the
climate of New South Wales, it possesses the additional advantage
of equalizing the condition of the class of convicts employed by
the Crown with those employed by the settlers, who, as I have
already observed, are all lodged in the same manner.</p>
<p>As I propose that these parties should be distributed in the
districts that are at some distance from the towns, and that, if
possible, they should not be placed nearer to any public road
than three miles, I conceive that the temptations to plunder that
have been observed to exist amongst the road parties, or to
exchange their clothes and blankets for spirits, will not occur
to them.</p>
<p>This employment, as well as all the others that have been
already enumerated, are destined only for the convicts of the
best character. The clerks and persons in higher situations of
life may be employed as assistants to the overseers, in keeping
the accounts of the work, and in making the weekly returns of
labour and tools but, with regard to the employment of this
description of convicts, certainly the most difficult of any, I
would generally observe, that it is not so much the performance
even of clerical labour that constitutes their punishment, as the
privation of those comforts to which they have been accustomed,
and the removal from those gratifications by which they have been
corrupted; to them any employment, however trifling, that takes
them from a town, is of itself a punishment.</p>
<p>Care should be taken by the overseer of the parties to make an
accurate admeasurement of the task allotted to each convict, and
to note the circumstances of a local nature, that will frequently
occur to impede the regular and allotted performance of it.</p>
<p>The value of the timber when cut is generally very
inconsiderable, as it chiefly consists of the eucalyptus or gum
tree; but there are tracts upon which the more valuable species
are found, and in which the employment of the wood-cutting gangs
will be beneficial in procuring an article that is always useful
in the colony, and always in demand for farm buildings and
fences.</p>
<p>It would also much encourage the employment of convicts by the
settlers, in the same operation, if an exportable value could be
given to any of the several species of timber that are found in
the interior of the colony, and that might afford freight to the
convict ships and traders on their homeward voyages either to
India or to England. The species of wood that are denominated
stringey bark, iron bark, blue gum, and cedar, are those which
have been found to be most useful in the colony; but from
specimens lately imported into England, their value, especially
that of stringey bark, is very questionable, and yet remains to
be roved. The beef wood is the only timber of an ornamental kind
that has hitherto been discovered; and although it is plentiful,
yet it is very inferior to the ornamental woods of Brazil and the
West Indies. All the species of wood that I have mentioned are
both hard and heavy, and although they will long continue in
general use in the colony, where these objections have ceased to
be of much importance, yet as articles of export, I should fear
the event of any competition between them and the woods of other
parts of the world, unless the disadvantages of an expensive
freight are counterbalanced by an entire exemption from duty.</p>
<p>By the Act of the 54 Geo. III. c. 66, no duty of customs was
chargeable on wood fit for naval purposes imported from any place
within the limits of the East India Company's charter; and the
duties that had been imposed on such wood by the 54 Geo. III. c.
36, were repealed.</p>
<p>By the Act of the 59 Geo. III. c. 52, that consolidated the
several duties of customs, and repealed former Acts imposing
duties, a duty of 1<i>l</i>. 10<i>s</i>. on every load,
containing 50 cubic feet, was laid upon teak wood or other wood
fit for ship building, imported from places within the limits of
the East India Company's charter, but a reference is made to the
above mentioned Act of 54 Geo. III. c. 66, by which such wood was
admitted free of duty. It would therefore appear to be doubtful
whether that Act is repealed by the 59 Geo. III. c. 52; but if
that should appear to be the case, I should recommend that all
duty whatever, upon any wood imported Into Great Britain, the
produce of New South Wales and Van Dieman's Land, should be
repealed.</p>
<p>The bark of the mimosa decurrens, that has received in New
South Wales the name of the black wattle, as well as almost all
the various species of mimosa and eucalyptus, contain a great
proportion of tannin; and in consequence of the expense of
freighting such an article to England, in bulk, one attempt has
been made in Van Dieman's Land, by an individual there, to reduce
it to the form of an extract.</p>
<p>With a view to encourage the employment of the convicts, by
individuals, in the operation of collecting and reducing this
bark, which is of a very simple kind, and partakes very much of
the same recommendations as those that exist in favour of cutting
wood and clearing land, I should recommend that the present duty
on extract of bark for tanning leather, and amounting to three
shillings per cwt. should, when certified to be made by convicts
in New South Wales, and exported direct from thence to Great
Britain, be entirely taken off.</p>
<p>Although I may be anticipating, in some degree, the mention of
the resources of the colony of New South Wales, yet I cannot here
omit the importance of one that has already been introduced to
public notice in the colony, as well as in this country, by the
great success that has attended it, and as affording, in an
eminent degree, opportunities of employing convicts to
advantage.</p>
<p>Your Lordship will hereafter observe the grounds from which I
think it reasonable to conclude that the tillage of the land in
New South Wales will never be removed to a great distance from
the coasts; and that the expense of transporting the produce of
cultivated land will always form a heavy deduction from the
profits of cultivation.</p>
<p>A great portion of the country that has been discovered to the
west and north of Bathurst is found to be particularly
calculated, even in its natural state, for the feeding of sheep
and cattle. With some improvement of the most difficult passes of
the blue mountains that separate that tract from the sea coast,
the transport thither of wool and the driving of cattle may be
rendered more practicable and less expensive than it is at
present.</p>
<p>Although the country that lies between the Bathurst Plains and
the course of the river Hastings has not yet been explored, I
think it most probable, that in this direction there will be
found several large tracts of natural pasturage, that will afford
the means of feeding and rearing numerous flocks of sheep; and,
generally speaking, the character of the country, the temperature
of the climate, and the pasturage, may be pronounced to be highly
favourable to those more delicate breeds that have hitherto
attained their greatest perfection in the warmer climates of the
south of Europe. The success that has attended the perseverance
and intelligence of Mr. J. M&#145;Arthur, in the improvement of his
own flocks, affords an unquestionable proof of the value of this
branch of rural industry in New South Wales, both as it regards
the employment of the convicts and the saving of all expense to
government in their subsistence, as well as in the production of
an article of export to Great Britain, that is indispensible to
the progress of her great staple manufacture; and that while it
renders her independent of foreign supplies, causes no
interference with the natural and most beneficial course of her
own agriculture, or with the produce of her own soil.</p>
<p>The employment of the convicts in the management of sheep in
New South Wales, I conceive, may be made highly conducive to
their improvement and reform; not, however, in the manner in
which it is conducted in Van Dieman's Land, where, as your
Lordship has seen, the convict is intrusted with a more
confidential and extensive charge than he is capable of managing,
and which the eye or control of his master seldom reaches, but by
providing, that all persons who apply for the temporary
occupation of a large tract of land, for the purpose of grazing,
shall not only perform the condition now required in Van Dieman's
Land, of constructing a principal stock yard for their sheep and
cattle, but that they shall employ an overseer, who shall be a
free and unconvicted person, and require his constant residence
at the principal station.</p>
<p>With a view also to encourage the more frequent and permanent
residence of the proprietors in these distant stations, grants of
land might be made to them, in proportion to the number of
convicts that they engaged to employ, as well as to the numbers
of sheep and cattle that the proprietors take with them in the
first instance; a power being added of purchasing, at a low rate,
such larger quantity as they might then require; and, with a
further understanding, that as the number of their flocks and
herds increased, a further augmentation of land would be made to
them gratuitously.</p>
<p>The principal object of these regulations is, to induce
persons of respectability to engage personally in the rearing of
sheep and cattle, on an extensive scale, in the interior of the
country, to employ convicts in that occupation, and to provide as
much control as possible for them, through the presence of their
masters, or a free overseer. No instance has occurred in which
this system has been so steadily pursued, as that of Mr. J.
M&#145;Arthur. He now maintains, upon his estate at the Cow Pastures,
between 90 and 100 convicts, who are all employed in the
management of sheep or cattle, or in cultivating as much grain as
may be requisite for his own consumption.</p>
<p>The local advantages possessed by this gentleman, in having
had a large grant of good land made to him at the Cow Pastures,
and in the virtual occupation of a part of those lands that were
reserved for the use of the government herds, have been greater
than have fallen to the lot of any other individual in the
colony. Mr. M&#145;Arthur has, however, made the best use of them; and
in the constant employment of a large number of convicts
indiscriminately assigned to him as they arrived, and by the
important improvement he has made in the value of his fleeces, he
has well repaid the liberality of His Majesty's Government.</p>
<p>I conceive that similar indulgence should be given, and the
same liberality should be manifested towards settlers possessing
capital, and a real intention of pursuing the same beneficial
course of industry, whether they may be now resident in New South
Wales, and capable of availing themselves of those advantages
immediately, or whether they may be desirous of repairing thither
from Great Britain.</p>
<p>Great as are the advantages that may reasonably be expected to
be derived by persons who will embark in these enterprizes, and
pursue them steadily, yet I feel convinced that in the first
instance, they must be accompanied by great personal sacrifices,
which will increase with the number of competitors in the same
occupation, and with some outlay of capital and expenditure, the
returns of which will be slow and distant.</p>
<p>In order to obtain the occupation of good tracts of land in
the interior, for grazing sheep and cattle, it will be necessary
for such persons to remove to a distance of not less than 120 or
150 miles from the sea coast. The cost of the transport of their
wool will thus become heavy, and unless every encouragement be
given to these enterprizes, either in the allowance of good
labourers from amongst the convicts that arrive, and in a certain
prospect that the importation of wool into Great Britain from New
South Wales will not be raised for a period of ten years, at
least, from its present trifling amount of one penny per pound,
the sacrifice to which I have alluded will not be encountered,
nor will that course of patient industry be entered upon, that
can alone lead to extensive and beneficial results.</p>
<p>The improvement of his flocks has been found by Mr. M&#145;Arthur,
even under circumstances of great local advantage (greater,
probably, than can again occur in New South Wales, and during a
period when no duty was imposed), to be a work that requires both
time and experience. The losses occasioned by the carelessness of
the convicts, even under the best superintendence, he has found
to make heavy deductions from the annual increase of his flocks;
it seems but reasonable, therefore, that some compensation should
be made for the risks thus encountered, and that the expense
incurred by the maintenance of the convicts should be relieved by
the admission of the produce of their labour with as little
incumbrance as possible from duties.</p>
<p>By the 59 Geo. III. c. 52, the present duty of 1<i>d</i>. per
pound on wool imported direct from any British colony, is to be
raised to 3<i>d</i>. after the 5th January 1823, and to
6<i>d</i>. after the 5th January 1826. The expenses of freight of
wool by the direct voyage from New South Wales to Great Britain
have been reduced from 4&frac12;<i>d</i>. to 3<i>d</i>. per
pound; and with the expenses of carriage from the interior of New
South Wales to the port of embarkation, and those of sorting and
packing, together with the expense of insurance and custom house
charges, commission and brokerage in the port of London, are
estimated to amount to 6&frac12;<i>d</i>. per pound, forming a
total charge of 9&frac12;<i>d</i>. per pound on wool brought from
the colony to the London market. The quantity of wool imported
from New South Wales into England in the year 1819, amounted to
71,299 pounds; in the year 1820 to 112,616 pounds; and in the
year 1821 to 175,433 pounds. From the public sales that took
place of the wool imported in the last year, and the beginning of
the present, it appears that one bale containing the best wool of
Mr. M&#145;Arthur's flocks, told as high as 10<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. per
pound, and two at 5<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per pound, but that out
of 326 other bales, that were imported at the same time, 223 sold
at prices varying from 1<i>s</i>. 2&frac12;<i>d</i>. per pound to
2<i>s</i>. inclusive; 84 bales sold from 2<i>s</i>. to 3<i>s</i>.
per pound, and 19 bales sold from 3<i>s</i>. to 4<i>s</i>. At the
last sale of 217 bales of wool imported from Van Dieman's Land
and New South Wales, 108 bales sold from 7<i>d</i>. to 1<i>s</i>.
per pound; 101 bales from 1<i>s</i>. to 2<i>s</i>.; six at
2<i>s</i>. 1<i>d</i>. and two at 2<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>.</p>
<p>From the present state of the flocks in New South Wales, and
of those in Van Dieman's Land, from the want of capital and
intelligence that prevails amongst the greatest number of the
proprietors of sheep, and the general disposition that I have
observed amongst them, to devote themselves to pursuits that
promise a limited but quick return, rather than to those that
require time and perseverance, the number of the fine woolled
sheep in the colony cannot be expected to increase with rapidity;
so that if the duty of 3<i>d</i>. per pound should meet the
importations of next year, it is to be feared; that the efforts
of those who are new endeavouring to improve their fleeces, and
who are beginning to procure to themselves and to the colony the
benefit of a valuable export, will be materially checked, and the
advantages arising to government from an extended employment of
the convicts will be greatly reduced. These advantages are easily
calculated, by referring to the estimated annual cost of every
convict in the employment of government, without including that
of superintendence.</p>
<p>Taking that cost to amount to an annual sum of 24<i>l</i>.
14<i>s</i>. for each convict, the employment of two thousand
convicts by individuals, would produce an annual saving to
government of 49,400<i>l</i>. In every point therefore, in which
those means of employment are viewed, whether with reference to
the reformation of the convicts themselves, the saving of expense
to government, or the production of valuable articles of export,
I conceive that the reduction of the duties that I have proposed
on the importation into Great Britain of the wood, and the
continuance of the present low duty on the wool of New South
Wales, are absolutely necessary for the preparation and
production of those commodities, and for encouraging the settlers
to have recourse to some other sources of industry than those
from which they have hitherto been able to derive
subsistence.</p>
<p>Your Lordship will perceive that in recommending these
employments for the convicts that are either now in the settled
districts of New South Wales or Van Dieman's Land, I have kept in
view, as far as was possible, the separation of the convicts,
that your Lordship's instructions prescribed, from the mass of
the population; and with a view to meet the present evils of a
redundant supply of labourers, and the demands of the settlers
for those accustomed to agricultural pursuits, I should recommend
that those who are now assigned, and that are the least useful to
their masters, or have been guilty of any misconduct, should as
soon as possible be withdrawn, and that with those of bad
character, who in future may arrive, and whose offences have been
accompanied by any peculiar circumstances of cruelty and
depravity, or who have manifested inveterate habits of
criminality, should be sent to one or more of the settlements
that I mean to propose, upon the northern coasts of New South
Wales.</p>
<p>The settled districts of the colony, or those immediately
adjoining, therefore, I should consider as providing employment
for the convicts of the best character and capacity for
agricultural labour, but as buildings are yet required by
government, both at Sydney and Paramatta, that will afford
occupation to a certain number of mechanics for the next two
years, I should recommend that a number, not exceeding four
hundred at Sydney, and one hundred at Paramatta, should be
retained and lodged in the convict barracks at each place, and
should be continued to be employed in the various works that are
now pursued in the lumber yard and dock yard. When these
buildings are completed, I should then recommend that no more
mechanics or convicts be retained in the employment of government
at any of the stations, or at Emu Plains, and that if at any
future time it may be considered necessary to retain them, the
same reference to good character, that I have hitherto
recommended in the selection of labourers for the settlers,
should always prevail in the selection of mechanics for
government. I have preferred this mode of constructing the
buildings that are yet required, because I consider that the
separation of the mechanics from the rest of the population, when
they are not too numerous for superintendence and inspection, or
for the accommodation that is afforded by the barracks, is more
attainable than by the assignment of them to individuals, who
might contract for the performance of the work.</p>
<p>In the hospitals and in the service of the commissariat at
Sydney, it will be necessary to retain a certain number of
convicts, who in conformity to the principle already laid down,
as well as to the statements that I have already submitted
respecting this class of convicts, should be more carefully
selected than any others.</p>
<p>The convicts of advanced age, and boys under the age of
sixteen, I should recommend to be retained at Sydney the former
to be employed in light work, about the dock yard and in the
convict barrack, and the latter to be entirely, confined to time
building called the carters barrack, in which it will be found
practicable, to instruct them in trades, and afterwards to assign
them to the service of settlers. A school may be established for
them in the same place, and they may be prevented from mixing
with the population of the town of Sydney, by confining them
strictly to the carter's barrack, and to the convict garden near
Hyde Park in their hours of exercise.</p>
<p>By thus withdrawing a great number of convicts from the
settled districts, leaving there as many of those of good
character as may be required by the settlers, a very large
proportion, amounting at present to not less than four thousand,
will be left for employment in other parts of the colony.</p>
<p>To meet your Lordship's views upon this subject, and to effect
an entire separation of this body of convicts from the mass of
the population, I recommend that settlements should be formed at
Moreton Bay, at Port Curtis, and Port Bowen.</p>
<p>I recommend that this direction should be taken, in forming
the future settlements; rather than one to the south, as from the
information that I received of the character and surface of the
country, as well as the want of good harbours on the coast, from
the entrance of Bass's Straits to Port Jackson, I am disposed to
believe that no settlement could be made there, without great
risk, or with any hope of deriving benefit from the labour of the
convicts. Another objection also arises, from that part of the
coast being frequented by the colonial vessels that are obliged
to anchor upon it on their passages to and from Van Dieman's
Land, and by vessels that are pursuing their course to Port
Jackson.</p>
<p>Your Lordship is aware that Port Macquarrie is already
occupied, but as I do not consider that it is sufficiently
distant from the other settlements to prevent the attempts at
escape, that are already so frequent at Port Hunter, and that the
appropriation of that place to the sole purposes of penal
restraint and discipline would prevent the colonization of the
fine country that lies on the banks of the River Hastings, or
those of Hunter's River and the intervening tracts; I should
recommend that three settlements should be made at the places I
have now mentioned, or at any other that may be found more
convenient between Port Macquarrie and the Southern Tropic, and
that whichever of these three should be found on further
examination to possess the fewest recommendations of soil, and to
be the least accessible to ships, should be destined for the
convicts sentenced to punishment by the magistrates of either the
older and settled districts of New South Wales and Van Dieman's
Land, or of the two new settlements that are destined to receive
the convicts. on their future arrival from England. I regret that
my information respecting all of the Three places that I have
mentioned, is very limited. The nature of my occupations, and of
my inquiry into the state of the present settlements, having
precluded a personal investigation of them, and Mr. Oxley, who
was the only person to whose report I could have trusted, having
been entirely occupied in accompanying Inc on my expedition to
Van Dieman's Land, and afterwards into the interior of the
country to the south-west of Bathurst, and to Port Macquarrie,
previous to the final determination of sending thither a
detachment of troops and convicts.</p>
<p>I have, however, reason to believe, that no other harbours of
any capacity exist in the same extent of coast, or that none are
accessible to vessels of large tonnage, except those have
mentioned.</p>
<p>Moreton Bay is situated in 27 deg. 30 min. south latitude,
Port Curtis in 24 deg. and Port Bowen in 22 deg. 28 min. south
latitude; and the distance from Moreton Bay to Port Macquarrie is
240 miles, and to Port Jackson 380 miles.</p>
<p>The anchorage in Port Bowen varies from a depth of three and
three quarters to nine fathoms; and on the south side of the
harbour from Cape Clinton there is good shelter for shipping.
Water has been found at a little distance from the Cape, on the
inside of which there is also a good beach for landing. The soil
of the country towards the south-west is represented to be of a
very good quality, and with these advantages, it is to be
expected that the labour of the convicts, if well applied, may be
made to produce sufficient grain for their own support.</p>
<p>The wood that has been observed at Port Bowen, consists of the
varieties of the eucalyptus that are found in the southern
settlements, and the species of pine that is distinguished by the
name of Norfolk Island.</p>
<p>The employments that I should propose for the convicts at
these settlements, are those that are strictly connected with the
clearing and cultivation of land, as soon as the requisite
buildings are constructed for the officers of the establishment,
and for the security of the stores. An enumeration and estimate
of these is to be found in the Appendix, as well as directions
for the employment of the convicts.</p>
<p>In providing lodging for them at these, or indeed any other
station in the country, I conceive that it is by no means
necessary that government should incur any expense, except that
of nails and tools, as the huts made of logs of wood, covered
with the bark of the eucalyptus, are amply sufficient for all
purposes of protection, and afford better means of separating the
convicts than the barracks at Sydney and Paramatta.</p>
<p>The temperature of the climate of Port Bowen, which is nearer
to the southern tropic than the other two settlements, will be
found to be considerably warmer than that of Port Jackson; the
thermometer, at noon, in the middle of the winter month of July,
having been observed to range as high as 70&deg;.</p>
<p>I do not conceive that this circumstance presents any
objection to the settlements that I have proposed, as the
ordinary effects of the same degrees of heat, upon European
constitutions in other parts of the world, have not thitherto
been experienced, and are not to be apprehended in New South
Wales.</p>
<p>The labour of clearing land, and preparing it for the
reception of maize, vegetables and the artificial grasses that
may be found necessary for the support of cattle in so warm a
climate, will afford constant and salutary occupation to the
convicts; and I should propose, that those who are not so
employed, may be distributed in parties for the purpose of
cutting and preparing wood, for sale and use, in the settled
districts.</p>
<p>Your Lordship will observe, that I have recommended the
removal of the present settlement at Port Hunter, not on account
of its not possessing within itself the character of a place of
punishment, but on account of its not being sufficiently
separated from a part of the country that must now be given up to
purposes of colonization; and which, from its fertility, and from
the circumstance of possessing a communication by water with Port
Jackson, will rapidly attract the notice of new settlers.</p>
<p>I have considered that, in forming the new settlements, their
contiguity to the sea coast was to be preferred to the removal of
the convicts into the interior, on account of the greater
facility of supply, and of the greater difficulties of
escape.</p>
<p>With these objects in view, I was naturally led to inquire
whether any of the islands in Bass's Straits, or upon the eastern
coast of New South Wales, were calculated for the reception of
convicts, without interfering with the fisheries that are carried
on there. I regretted to learn, that since the access to Norfolk
Island had been considered to be too perilous, no other island
had been discovered that afforded the same advantages of soil and
climate, or indeed any means of providing labour or support to a
convict population.</p>
<p>Your Lordship will have observed, that the employment that I
have proposed for the convicts that are in future to be allowed
to remain in the settled districts of New South Wales or Van
Dieman's Land, must necessarily be of a limited nature, and must
altogether depend upon the greater or less demand for the
services of the convicts, either in agriculture, or in the
depasturing of sheep and cattle.</p>
<p>The retirement of the useless or unemployed convicts from the
settled districts to those that are more remote, will, I
conceive, tend greatly to diminish the difficulties of control
over those that remain, and will afford that gradual prospect of
amelioration in their condition, to the convicts so removed, that
is essential to the purposes of their reform. In this view, a
permission to a convict to remain in the settled districts, or to
remove to them afterwards, from the newly established ones, must
be considered in the light of a reward, either for previous good
conduct, well attested in England, and during the passage, or for
good conduct in the new establishments.</p>
<p>Removed as these will be from all contact with the settled
districts, it will only remain for the commandants appointed to
them, to enforce the same rigorous exclusion of trading vessels,
and the same vigilance in detecting the importation of spirits,
that has been found practicable at Port Hunter.</p>
<p>The weekly allowance of food to each convict should not exceed
that of seven pounds of salt beef or mutton, or four pounds of
salt pork, five pounds of wheaten flour, and five pounds of the
flour of maize, and half a pound of sugar. Their dress should
consist of striped cotton shirts, duck trowsers and frock, shoes
and straw hat; and to those who are engaged in cutting wood,
there should be provided trowsers made of the coarsest blanketing
manufactured at Paramatta.</p>
<p>As it is proposed that the convicts should be lodged in huts
constructed by themselves, the only bedding that will be required
should consist of one rug and a palliass filled with fern
straw.</p>
<p>The superintendence of the convicts, either in the settled
districts or in the new establishments, I should recommend to be
entirely changed.</p>
<p>Your Lordship will have seen, that although I have not been
able to trace any positive corruption in the distribution of the
convicts by William Hutchinson the principal superintendent, yet
that the principle upon which the distribution has been professed
to be made, and the necessity to which the free settlers have
been compelled to submit in addressing themselves to him
exclusively upon this subject, have given great and general
dissatisfaction. The principle of selection by which I have
proposed that this important branch of duty should in future be
conducted, is certainly one that requires both more of
deliberation and discrimination than the present superintendent
has it in his power, even if he were willing, to bestow. I
therefore recommend that the office of principal superintendent
of convicts in New South Wales should be committed to the hands
of a person who has never been convicted, with whom the
magistrates of New South Wales will feel no objection to
communicate upon all subjects relating to the convicts in their
districts; and whose particular charge it should be to note all
changes in the situation of the convicts that are allowed to
remain in the settled districts; and above all, to enter in an
alphabetical register of those names, all offences committed by
them, with their dates.</p>
<p>To the same officer should also be addressed quarterly reports
from the superintendents of the new establishments, of the
conduct of the convicts sent thither, their occupations, and the
quantity of labour performed; and when any application or
recommendation for the removal of a convict from either of those
establishments is made to the governor of New South Wales, means
may exist in the hands of the superintendent of examining and
submitting to the governor the pretensions and grounds upon which
the recommendation of each particular case is founded. At each of
the new establishments I also recommend that there should be
appointed one superintendent of convicts with a suitable salary,
and an allowance of a certain proportion of the profit that may
be derived to government from the sale of all articles procured
at those settlements and exported to Sydney. It would be very
desirable that these persons should have a knowledge of
agriculture, or the superintendence and employment of labourers
of any description, so as to ensure an attention to agricultural
operations, rather than to any other species of labour.</p>
<p>Your Lordship will, doubtless, have observed in the remarks
that I have already made upon the character of the subordinate
officers employed in the superintendence of the convicts, that no
efficacious exercise of authority over them Is to be expected
from persons who have only lately emerged from the same class,
and stilt less from those that actually belong to it.</p>
<p>The system upon which the public works have been so long
conducted in New South Wales is now so deeply interwoven with the
interests of those overseen who have been engaged in the duty,
that I should consider any selection of them either for the
superintendence of the convicts in the labour of clearing and
cutting wood, that I have proposed in the settled districts or in
the new establishments, to be very unprofitable; and I should
have great doubts whether the present overseers would be willing
to proceed to the new settlements under any conditions. I should
recommend, therefore, that for both these purposes, the plan that
was submitted to me by Major Bell, the acting engineer at Hobart
Town, should be adopted, and that non-commissioned officers and
privates, either from the half pay of the corps: of royal
artillery or engineers, should be sent from England to take upon
them the duty of superintending the labour that is in future to
be performed by the convicts.</p>
<p>The habits of discipline and regularity, and the knowledge of
mechanics that are acquired by men of this description, qualify
them in a peculiar manner, for the superintendence and management
of the compulsory labour of convicts; and as an interest in the
produce of that labour will be given to them, by an allowance of
a certain proportion of the proceeds, their attention will be
drawn to the means of augmenting the amount, and thus be diverted
from schemes of profit, unconnected with their duty. It should be
clearly understood by these persons, that they will not be
allowed to derive any separate profit from the labour of a
convict, or to have more than one assigned to them for purposes
strictly domestic; but that as the purchase of animal foal will
not be practicable in the new settlements to which they proceed,
rations for themselves and wives will be allowed to be drawn from
the king's store, not exceeding the ration already recommended
for the convicts. No larger quantity of land must be allowed them
than is sufficient for a garden, otherwise there will be a
perpetual inducement to them to employ the convicts in raising
articles of consumption for their own exclusive profit, instead
of exacting all their labour for that of government.</p>
<p>The employment, lodging, and superintendence of the male
convicts at these stations, being thus disposed of, it is
necessary to state the regulations by which tho female convicts
are in future to be employed.</p>
<p>I should recommend that the assignment of the female convicts,
on their first it arrival, should be regulated by the colonial
secretary and the superintendent of convicts, but that all
applications for female convicts should be addressed to the
former; and when they are made by settlers living in the country,
the applications should, in the first instance, be transmitted to
the magistrates of the districts, describing the qualifications
of the servants that are required.</p>
<p>Presuming always, that the same information shall be
transmitted respecting the female convicts, that has been
recommended in the cases of the male convicts, it is an object of
great importance to the colony, as well as to the females
themselves, that the selection and distribution of them should,
as far as possible, proceed upon the same principles; and it will
then be both reasonable and just, that the covenants of the
indenture that are now entered into by the parties to whom female
convicts are assigned should be strictly enforced.</p>
<p>Those female convicts that are not assigned from the ship
should be sent from Sydney to Paramatta; and as greater care and
precaution are necessary in this transfer than can be expected
from a constable, I conceive it to be absolutely requisite that
the superintendent of the factory at Paramatta should repair to
Sydney, on the day of debarkation, and should accompany the
female convicts from thence to the place of their
destination.</p>
<p>All the precautions that I have already recommended in
preventing access to the ships in the period after arrival and
debarkation, are doubly necessary in the case of a female convict
ship; as well as those by which their property and dress may
hereafter be secured for their benefit, and prevented from
affording the means of present indulgence. And here I think it
necessary to repeat, that the female convicts should be required
to appear and land from the ship in the dresses that are provided
for them by the Navy Board, and should be required to repair to
their destined places of servitude, in those dresses and in no
others.</p>
<p>The indulgence that has hitherto been granted to female
convicts, to join their husbands on their arrival, is perhaps
productive of benefit, under the present system of convict
management in New South Wales; but it certainly tends to weaken
the effect of transportation, and to form a new and additional
motive for the commission of crime. Hard as it may appear,
therefore, I conceive it to be absolutely necessary to prohibit
the continuance of the practice, and at the same time to place
such female convicts as have husbands in the colony, and who are
either emancipated or suffering under sentences of
transportation, out of the reach of any improper temptation, but
still in a state of penal confinement. I accordingly recommend
that they should be sent to the factory at Paramatta, and that
nothing but proofs of their good conduct there, should be
considered as giving them a claim to release.</p>
<p>The management of the female convicts in the factory at
Paramatta, is a duty for which I do not conceive there is any
person now in New South Wales who is duly qualified; and it is of
the first importance to the colony, as well as to the future
success of that establishment, that a superintendent who has been
familiar with the details of management either in a factory or a
gaol, should be appointed to the situation. A married woman would
in my opinion be more competent to the duty than a married man,
and she should be assisted by a deputy superintendent, who, with
his family, should reside in one of the apartments already
described, in the outer yard of the new building. A house
situated at a little distance from the present entrance to the
factory, and commanding a view of it, should be provided for the
female superintendent, and to her should be committed the
management and direction of the whole establishment.</p>
<p>It should be a principal object to separate at all times, and
in all duties, the women who are placed in the factory for
punishment, and those who are placed there on arrival from
England; and for the accomplishment of this object no considers.
Cons of architectural ornament, in the present state of the new
building, should be allowed to interfere with the alterations
which will certainly be necessary. I should recommend, therefore,
that a complete separation should be made of the vacant spaces
now left on either side of the principal building, and that in
one of them a long range of sleeping rooms on the ground floor
should be constructed on the inside of the wall that incloses the
whole; the wall being first raised from its present height of 10
to 13 feet. A range of work-rooms should also be constructed, in
the scene manner, and in the same spaces; and the entire
separation of the female convicts placed in the factory for
punishment, from those placed there for work and confinement,
will thus be effected, and more ample accommodation will be
afforded to the females of that class.</p>
<p>The present employment given to the females, of picking,
carding and spinning wool, may be advantageously continued; and
to this employment may be added, the making of linen and calico
shirts, and straw hats, for the male convicts who are to be
employed at the distant settlements, and the spinning of flax
that will be grown there, for the purpose of being manufactured
into canvas for jackets and trowsers.</p>
<p>The future assignment of the females to settlers and others,
must be left to the joint discretion of the resident magistrates
at Paramatta, and the female superintendent of the factory; but
in the performance of this important duty, both as it regards the
male as well as the female convicts, no consideration of the
services of the individual being required for the purposes of
government, nor of relief to it, from the charge of maintenance,
should be allowed to interfere with the paramount considerations
of merit and demerit, or to constitute a claim, independent of
those considerations, for enlargement.</p>
<p>The control of the male convicts that may either continue in
the service of settlers in the settled districts, or that may in
future be assigned to them, must be left to the superintendence
of the magistrates and officers of police; but as I do not
consider it necessary to enter at present upon the detail of
those measures that I recommend for their improvement, or the
better performance of their duties, I shall only observe, that
the present regulation by which convict labourers are allowed to
claim annual wages, seems to me to be inconsistent with that
state of servitude which, as convicted criminals, they are bound
to endure.</p>
<p>From the opinion of His Majesty's attorney and
solicitor-general, that was transmitted by your Lordship to
Governor Macquarrie, it appears that this state of servitude is
created by the provisions of the statute of the 4th Geo. c. 11,
and subsequent statutes, by all of which a property in the
service of the convict, is reserved to the person to whom he
shall have been assigned. The condition of the convict is
therefore considered to be that of servitude, liable indeed to
the regulations or the will of the master, but subject always in
their exercise to the rules of humanity, in protecting the
convict from cruelty or bodily harm. Your Lordship will observe,
that the power of punishing any neglect of work in the convict,
remains as an inference only, from the right that the assignee
obtains in his services; and it will be for your Lordship to
determine, whether the punishment of an offence so frequent as
that of neglect of work in the convicts, or of insolence and
resistance to the overseers, either in the service of government,
or in that of individual settlers, should not be placed upon some
more defined basis.</p>
<p>The payment of wages to the convicts in the service of
settlers has now been sanctioned by a custom of several years
continuance; but it was the subject of much complaint, as it
leaves no option to the settler in requiting the service of an
expert or an useless convict, and as the larger proportion of
those assigned to the settlers has consisted of the latter
description.</p>
<p>When it becomes a duty, as I humbly presume it is, in the
local government of New South Wales, to endeavour, as far as
possible, to accommodate and to meet the views of the settlers,
in the assignment to them of the particular convicts that they
Want, the cause of complaint that I have stated will be much
removed, and I think that a disposition will generally prevail
amongst them to continue the present regulation of giving a
certain amount of wages to their convict servants. I still
however am of opinion, that any regulation by which a fixed sum
is appointed or required to be given as a remuneration for
services that are in their nature uncertain, and that cannot be
exchanged or dispensed with in a less term than one year, has a
tendency to relax the exertions of the convict, and make him
indifferent about the quantum of reward. It has been the custom
of many of the higher class of settlers to give task-work to some
of their convicts, and to pay them at the same rate as free
labourers; and in this mode of employment they have found their
advantage, while by the mode of payment in what is termed
property, the real price of the labour has been much reduced. I
consider, however, that it is much more consistent with the
notion of punishment, as well as reform, that no other claim of a
convict to remuneration, should exist or be recognized than that
of good conduct and industry; and that the only claim he should
be known to possess upon his master, should be a certain quantity
of food, clothing and lodging.</p>
<p>With this view, I recommend, that in future all claim to wages
on the part of the convict should be abolished, and that the
master should only be required to furnish a regulated amount of
clothing and food; the former, consisting of two full suits of
slops, with two additional pairs of shoes to stock-keepers in the
year, with a rug and palliass; and the latter, consisting of a
weekly allowance of seven pounds of fresh or salt beef, or four
pounds of salt pork, six pounds of wheaten flour, four pounds of
maize flour, and half a pound of sugar. Occasional allowances of
soap, and the repairs of clothes, should be included in this
allowance; but all the present indulgences that are given, of
tobacco and tea, should be considered as entirely dependent upon
the extraordinary exertions or the good conduct of the convict.
The same regulations should take place respecting the wages of
the female convicts; and in cases where it may be necessary to
limit their allowance of food, it should consist of two-thirds of
that which has been assigned to the male convicts. The best
security for the due enforcement of the regulations, and for the
protection of the convicts against oppression, will be found in
the encouragement that may be given in England to settlers of
respectability, to transfer their capital and families to New
South Wales, in preventing convicts from prematurely assuming the
character of proprietors and masters, and from the discrimination
and vigilance of the chief local authority.</p>
<p>It now only remains for me to submit to your Lordship the
nature of the regulations that may be most expedient for
effecting a reform in the convicts by a mitigation of their terms
of punishment. It has generally been considered, that the
declaration contained in the government order issued by Governor
Macquarrie on the 9th January 1813, by which certain terms of
service were fixed as preliminary conditions of remission or
indulgence, has had the effect of raising expectations in the
convicts that at the lapse of those terms the remissions would be
granted, or at least, that they might be always demanded. This
feeling has been found to interfere with the habits of dependence
and restraint that is of importance to maintain during the first
period of probationary servitude of a convict, and to induce a
belief that there was no crime, however great or atrocious, that
could not be atoned by a service of three years. I conceive,
however, that no general declaration upon the extent of the term,
is necessary or consistent with the considerations that must
guide the governors of New South Wales, in the exercise of this
branch of their authority. The claim of a convict for mitigation
of a sentence of seven years duration, at the expiration of
three, is evidently stronger than that of a convict transported
for 14 years, or for life; but by the regulation in question they
are all placed upon the same footing, as to the first indulgence
of a ticket of leave.</p>
<p>The regulation respecting the term for applying for
conditional pardons is equally objectionable, as a convict
transported for 14 years is not considered to have a title to
apply, until he has resided nine years and four months of that
time in the colony, whereas the term allowed for a convict
transported for life, to obtain the same indulgence, is only ten
years. I should therefore recommend, that in future no precise
term should be understood to prevail respecting any mitigations
of sentences; but that the applications that are made for them,
should give a more detailed statement of the pretensions of each
applicant, and that the magistrates should either be required to
certify, that the party has not been convicted of any offence
before them, within the period of his service, or if he has, that
it should be stated with the date of the sentence and punishment
inflicted. I conceive also, that a much more convenient mode of
receiving applications for these remissions of sentences may be
adopted by the governor of the colony of New South Wales, than
that. which at present exists. The confusion that arises from
limiting the applications to one day in the year, both in the
consideration of the petitions, and in the collection of so many
impatient and anxious individuals in one place, and especially in
the town of Sydney, is an evil not lea felt by the governor, who
has to deliberate upon the petitions, than by the applicants
themselves. It will be found much more conducive to the
convenience of both, to receive all future applications of this
nature in the particular districts in which the parties reside at
the time, or in which it is most probable that they have
previously resided, and in which therefore there is the best
chance of their characters and conduct being known.</p>
<p>In receiving the applications, the governor may receive great
assistance from the presence of the magistrates and chaplain of
the district, and he may have an opportunity that he cannot have
when alone, of establishing the truth of the statements submitted
to him, by the verbal representations of the magistrates and the
chief constables of the districts, who should be enjoined to keep
registers or every convict in their district, and to produce
these registers before the governor on the day appointed for
receiving applications. The magistrates will then be more
cautious than they are at present, of giving testimonials in
favour of persons with whom they are slightly acquainted, and
they will be called upon to justify the grounds upon which they
have given them. It should be always understood, that the best
recommendation for the indulgence of a ticket of leave, is
continued good conduct in the service of the same master. It
should further be known and understood, that the marriage of a
convict with a female convict, or with a native-born woman,
furnishes no claim to a ticket of leave, unless there has been a
previous service of four years at least, and recommendation of
good conduct, together with the means of future support.</p>
<p>Your Lordship has already seen the consequences, that arise
from giving tickets or leave, on their arrival in New South
Wales, to persons who are able to support themselves, and of
allowing convicts to be assigned to superintendents and overseers
in remuneration of their services. I believe that there is only
one opinion in New South Wales upon the inexpediency of these
practices; and I submit, that no considerations of relief to the
government, from the charge of supporting a convict, be his
condition what it may, no recommendation from any other person
than your Lordship, or from His Majesty's Secretary of State for
the Home Department, should be considered an authority to the
governor of New South Wales, or the lieutenant-governor of Van
Dieman's Land, to bestow a ticket of leave upon any convict
immediately after his arrival.</p>
<p>The practice of assigning convicts to magistrates, clerks and
overseers, as remuneration of their services, may be continued to
the former, with an understanding that they are to be employed
either upon the estate of the magistrate, or as his domestic
servants; but they ought not to be allowed to any other officer
whatever in the settled district; and only to the superintendents
and overseers in the new establishments, upon the condition that
I have before described.</p>
<p>It has appeared to me, that if the indulgence of tickets of
leave was granted, as I presume it should, as the reward of good
conduct alone, it would much promote that object, if the names of
the parties so rewarded were published in the colonial gazette.
The attention and notice of the settlers would then be drawn to
the most deserving individuals, and the influence of public
opinion might be brought in aid mud confirmation of the rewards
of individual merit.</p>
<p>The same remark equally applies to all the subsequent and
larger indulgences of conditional and absolute pardons.</p>
<p>Having adverted to the recommendations of the Parliamentary
Committee on transportation, respecting the check upon the power
of the governor of New South Wales in granting remissions of
sentences, as well as to the observations of Governor Macquarrie
in reply, I feel myself compelled to differ from the reasons
alleged by the governor, in his dispatch to your Lordship, for
not strictly complying with the recommendation of the Committee.
It appears to me, that the deductions that may occur in the
course of six months or more, in the list of tickets of leave
granted, can furnish no reason for not transmitting such list,
not only to your Lordship, but to His Majesty's Secretary of
State for the Home Department, by the first opportunity that may
occur, after the list has been published. This list should not
only contain the names of the convicts rewarded with tickets of
leave, but the name of the ship in which they arrived, the date
and place, and term of their sentence, the date of their arrival
in the colony, the date of the ticket of leave, the name of the
person by whom they were recommended, and the grounds of
recommendation, accompanied with such remarks as may occur,
especially including the fact of the ticket of leave having been
withdrawn for misconduct, since the time of granting it.</p>
<p>From reference to the considerations that have hitherto
governed the issue of tickets of leave, I feel it my duty to
press most strongly upon your Lordship's attention, the
importance of requiring a scrupulous observance of this
regulation, both from the governor of New South Wales, and the
lieutenant-governor of Van Dieman's Land.</p>
<p>A discretion must necessarily be reposed in these officers for
the honourable and faithful exercise of this important duty; but
I consider that nothing should be held to absolve them from
furnishing to your Lordship the most ample and regular means of
judging, whether the power has been judiciously exercised, and
whether the exceptions they have deemed it expedient to admit,
have been justifiable in themselves, or beneficial in their
consequences.</p>
<p>I conceive that the indulgence of a ticket of leave affords
such a wholesome restraint upon the conduct of a convict, that a
longer duration may be given to that condition, than Governor
Macquarrie has thought expedient.</p>
<p>Your Lordship will already have observed, that the punishment
of transportation is not sensibly felt by convicts transported
for seven years, unless the whole of that term be considered as
one of penal restraint. This mode of treating, convicts of this
class, will produce an inequality in their condition in the
colony, which is not justified by a simple reference to the
nature of their crimes, or a comparison with those of others. If,
however, it be considered expedient to continue the
transportation of offenders to New South Wales, for so short a
term as that of seven years (of which, with the exception of
persons long habituated to crime, I conceive that there are great
doubts) this inequality of punishment will be necessary, to
render it effectual; and it will then become more necessary that
all circumstances in the cases of such convicts, that may afford
a ground of remission of their sentences, should be stated with
great particularity; and that without such circumstances, the
indulgence of a ticket of leave should be altogether
withheld.</p>
<p>Having already described the beneficial effects of a ticket of
leave, I will not now repeat than; but I think it right to
suggest, that when they are considered strictly as the rewards of
good conduct, those effects are much impaired, and their value
lessened, by the continuance of one of the contingencies to which
they are now made liable. The recal of a well conducted mechanic,
holding a ticket of leave, to government labour, merely on
account of his valuable services, confounds and defeats all
notions of reward for good conduct; and as a power so prejudicial
to that object ought not to be exercised by the government, I
conceive that it should be abolished, and that the magistrates
should be instructed, in the first place, to make regular and
immediate returns to the governor of all tickets of leave that
they order to be withdrawn, with a statement of the circumstances
that have justified it. Good behaviour should be distinctly
understood to be the tenure upon which a ticket of leave is held;
and the magistrates should be authorized to consider, as Lieut.
governor Sorrell has done, that an exorbitant demand for labour,
by a ticket of leave man, is one reason, amongst others, for
withdrawing it. The convict, however, against whom any sentence
has been pronounced by the magistrates, by which his ticket of
leave is either withdrawn or suspended, should be considered to
have a right of appealing to the governor against it.</p>
<p>Your Lordship will have observed that instances have occurred
in which convicts holding tickets of leave have held and
purchased land in New South Wales, and that they have been
admitted to maintain actions in the courts of justice, although
in strictness of law, they are disabled from so doing, by reason
of their conviction, while they cannot allege that disability in
bar of an action brought against them. These circumstances are
certainly not favourable to the acquirement of property, by
ticket of leave men; but I do not conceive it to be necessary in
the present state of the colony, to encourage this class of
convicts to acquire it more expeditiously than they are disposed
to do, or to assume any other relation than that of tenants, if
they cultivate land, or in that of labourers working for their
own profit.</p>
<p>I cannot recommend, therefore, that the legal disabilities of
conviction should be removed from this class; and I think that
from the experience of the past their equitable right to maintain
actions may fairly be left as it hitherto has been, to the
discretion of the courts of justice.</p>
<p>Respecting the manner of receiving applications for
conditional and absolute remissions of sentence; the same
regulations should be understood to apply to them as to the
species of indulgence just now adverted to.</p>
<p>The magistrates and chaplains have hitherto been enjoined to
grant their certificates in favour of those convicts only whom
they know to be "honest, sober, and industrious".</p>
<p>As the declaration of a principle by which the governor
intended to guide himself in the exercise of the great power of
pardoning or mitigating sentences, and as a general rule for the
magistrates and chaplains in recommending convicts as fit objects
of his favours, this injunction might be proper; but I hardly
conceive that a compliance with it was practicable. The best
conducted men would naturally be the least known to the
magistrates; and the knowledge acquired by the chaplains of the
different convicts, assigned to settlers in the districts, was
too limited to afford them any means of forming a judgment of
their conduct. It is, however, practicable at all times for the
magistrates, by observing that their clerks make regular and
correct entries of the proceedings before them, to certify
whether an applicant for any indulgence has been convicted or
not; and this information they should be required to give. The
governor will then have to decide whether the offence has been of
sufficient importance to make it a ground of denial or
postponement of indulgence; and when it is distinctly understood
in the colony, that conviction before the magistrates forms an
impediment to a remission of sentence, the convicts will be more
careful in giving subject of complaint.</p>
<p>The term assigned by Governor Macquarrie, for negativing
applications for conditional and absolute pardons to convicts
transported for fourteen years, is more justly proportioned to
the length of their sentences than those of other classes.</p>
<p>I do not, however, conceive that any declaration is necessary
upon the subject; and think the rejection of applications, on the
ground of their being premature, will of itself demonstrate the
opinions of the governor; and by degrees produce a greater
conformity to them than the declaration of a rule which it has
been so often Sound expedient to disregard.</p>
<p>As it is of the utmost consequence to maintain the value of
these rewards, I conceive that the mere personal exertions of an
individual, without reference to his moral conduct, should never
be considered to constitute a sufficient ground for bestowing
them.</p>
<p>In this point of view the emancipations that I have already
alluded to, and that were given for the loan of carts and horses,
either for the accommodation of the governor, or for the
formation of a road, were equally objectionable; and the public
services for which these rewards were given, were not of that
urgent or important nature to require or sanction any such
sacrifice.</p>
<p>The governors of New South Wales are directed by their
instructions to give grants of land to such deserving and
industrious convicts as have received emancipations, and have
been discharged from servitude on that account. The manner of
receiving applications for this indulgence is very much the same
as that which has been described in the distributions of
remissions of sentence, and the same suspensions of applications
for laud have taken place, founded always upon the number of
grants of land that have been made in preceding years.</p>
<p>The applications, after receiving the signature of the
chaplains and magistrates of the districts, are delivered to the
governor on one day in the year.</p>
<p>I was present upon one occasion of this kind, when, from the
number of these applicants, consisting of every rank and
condition, and their eagerness to offer their petitions, great
confusion and some violence took place. The governor read the
petitions in the presence of the parties, and sometimes referred
to Mr. Meehan, the deputy surveyor general, who attended. Mr.
Oxley, the surveyor general, was not present; and upon my
expressing surprise at this circumstance, he informed me, that no
reference had ever been made to him by Governor Macquarrie, upon
the petitions for land, nor had his advice ever been requested or
taken upon them.</p>
<p>I have already described the number and character of the
emancipated convicts that now hold laud in New South Wales, and
it appears to me that the system that has hitherto been pursued,
of granting 30 acres of land to emancipated convicts, without
reference to their means of cultivation, is not attended with the
beneficial results that were expected from it. They have, in many
instances, been disposed of, to obtain relief from pressing
necessities, occasioned either by unfavourable seasons, bad soil,
or the effects of dissipation and indulgence and Governor
Macquarrie felt assured, that many of the applicants that
appeared before him, on the occasion to which I have just now
alluded, had alienated by private and previous sales, all right
to the land for which they were applying.</p>
<p>A rule had been promulgated by him, at an early period, and it
forms a condition of every grant, that it shall not be disposed
of or alienated within five years. This rule, however, has been
violated by persons of every class in the colony; amongst whom I
regretted to find were the surveyor and deputy surveyor of the
colony.</p>
<p>The occupation of the land in these cases is transferred to
the purchaser; and a bond is entered into by the seller to
deliver the grant to him at the expiration of the term of five
years. The small grants have by these means fallen into the hands
of the capitalists at Sydney, who have obtained them at a very
low rate, not exceeding 5<i>s</i>. an acre.</p>
<p>The indulgences, likewise, that accompany these grants,
consisting either of cattle from the government herds, or of
convicts assigned and victualled by the crown, have in some
instances been greatly abused. They have latterly been more
sparingly granted; and not until the grantee of the land had
actually repaired to his allotment and made some progress in its
cultivation.</p>
<p>Considering the general quality of the land of New South
Wales, it is not to be expected that an emancipated convict,
without capital or means of cultivation, can so manage an
allotment of 30 acres of land, as to derive subsistence or profit
from it.</p>
<p>The little success that has attended any of the settlements
made by this class of persons at a distance from the towns or
markets, shows the impolicy of continuing to place them in such
situations. I should therefore recommend that no grants of land
exceeding to acres in extent, should be given to remitted
convicts, or to those whose term of sentence had expired, unless
they could satisfactorily prove that they were possessed of
capital amounting to not less than 20<i>l</i>. either in stock or
implements; and that the same restriction upon the allowance of
convict labour and subsistence that Governor Macquarrie has
introduced, should, in all cases, be continued. At present, the
allowance is limited to the period of six months, which is
considered by many persons to be too short for affording any real
assistance to a convict, who has to clear the land of trees
before he can derive any assistance from it. I therefore
recommend that the period should be extended to twelve months. I
should farther recommend that no encouragement should be given to
any persons of this class that are not mechanics, and do not
possess capital, to settle in the more remote districts of the
colony; but that tracts of good land, and not exceeding to acres,
in the neighbourhood of the towns, should be reserved for them.
Their produce will be thus more easily and advantageously
disposed of, and their industry will be more readily excited by
the demand for labour, that the neighbourhood and wants of a town
never fail to create.</p>
<p>The lower class of remitted convicts, and those whose terms of
service are expired, will thus become resident labourers, rather
than settlers, and their hope of future success will be more
directed to their own industry and exertion, than to the early
disposal and abuse of the indulgences of the crown.</p>
<p>The inquiries into the merits and situation of these persons
may be made, and their claims to indulgence may be investigated
in the same manner as those recommended for remissions of
sentence; and I will only observe, that an inflexible adherence
to the rule that requires the certificate of a magistrate and a
chaplain, for applications of this sort, may lead to an unfair
denial of the pretensions of a party, whose previous occupations
had taken, as well as kept him, out of the reach of their notice,
and who, in other respects, may be well entitled to an
indulgence.</p>
<p>I have already submitted to your Lordship the nature and
extent of the disabilities to which the remitted convicts in New
South Wales, as well as those that return to this country, remain
liable, until the remissions of sentence bestowed upon them by
the governors of the colony, are confirmed by their being
inserted in general pardons under the great seal. That which
affects the right of maintaining actions in the courts of justice
in New South Wales will be more fully considered when the
judicial establishments of the colony are examined, but I will
now only observe, that it is a right that is so essentially
necessary to the enjoyment of property, that if it should be
considered good policy to give grants of land to convicts on
receiving remissions of sentence, or to encourage them to acquire
property in other ways; the enjoyment of that right, ought not to
be allowed to depend upon any exercise of judicial
discretion.</p>
<p>Respecting the property of attainted convicts, your Lordship
will have observed, that except in cases of murder and treason,
it is now inheritable by their children. The right of maintaining
actions for the recovery of such property, as well as the right
of dominion over it during their life-time, should accompany the
remissions of sentence by the governors or lieutenant-governors;
and in case of alienation, transfer or mortgage, no other
restriction should be imposed, than that of obtaining the
permission of the surveyor-general of the colony; without which,
all such acts on the part of remitted convicts, as well as of the
expirees, should be declared to be absolutely null and void.</p>
<p>I have already submitted grounds by which your Lordship will
be able to form a judgment, both with respect to the past and
future exercise of the power of granting remissions of sentence;
and I will now offer to your Lordship's notice such regulations
as appear to me to be advisable to secure the benefits that were
intended by them.</p>
<p>The governors and lieutenant-governors of the colony should be
enjoined to examine, with great particularity, the merits of
those convicts to whom they grant remissions; and to transmit
their names, and length of sentences, their service in the
colony, and the names of the persons by whom they are
recommended, by the earliest opportunity to your Lordship. The
pardon or remission of sentences so given by the governor of New
South Wales, should be declared by legislative authority to
confer, immediately, all the rights that a pardon under the great
seal would give, as long as the party holding it remains in the
territory and jurisdiction of New South Wales, and conforms to
the condition of the pardon; a power being always reserved to the
crown to revoke such pardons, and if not revoked within two years
from the date, the pardons to be considered as confirmed.</p>
<p>It should also be declared, that the effect of the governor's
pardon should not extend to any interest or property of a
remitted convict, that accrues to him out of the territory of New
South Wales and its dependencies, and that when he leaves it, he
should be placed in no other situation, than in that of a person
holding a sign manual pardon.</p>
<p>This difference in favour of the territory will dispose the
remitted convicts, who are generally those that have been
transported for life, to prefer it as their future home, and to
abandon all wish to return to En land; a disposition, the
importance of encouraging which, I have already adverted to.</p>
<p>In any legislative declaration that may be made upon this
subject, it will be expedient to notice the situation of those
convicts that have been transported for certain terms, and for
felonies that are not within the provisions of the 4 Geo. I. c.
11, and at the same time to declare, that all the benefits of
that Act are extended to them. The rights of those convicts, that
are now imperfect, will thus be completed by legislative
authority, and I have no doubt that their jealousy of that
discretion, by which it has appeared to them that their rights
were affected, will speedily subside.</p>
<p>In proportion, however, as the benefits of a state of freedom
are imparted to a large a portion of the inhabitants of New South
Wales, I cannot contemplate their character, or the possible
abuse that they may make of such privileges, without submitting
to your Lordship the expediency of providing against the
consequences of both, by conferring upon the governors of the
colony, or lieutenant-governors, the power of compelling any
person to leave it, that has been once in the condition of a
Convict, where it shall appear that such a determination is
necessary for the public security and tranquillity; the
responsibility for this exercise of power, always resting with
the governor; and time, as well as permission being given to the
party removed, to dispose of his property.</p>
<p>Respecting the admission of these persons to society, there is
reason to apprehend, that however desirable it may be to hold out
encouragement to the convicts to reform, by conferring upon them
distinctions that imply an entire oblivion of their former
transgressions, and a re-integration of all social and civil
rights, yet, that it is now impracticable, to unite other men in
giving effect to this encouragement, without appearing to violate
the independent exercise of their own judgment.</p>
<p>Without presuming to lay down any rule for the conduct of the
present or future governor, I conceive it to be desirable that
his efforts to introduce persons who have been convicts to
society, should be regulated by a more strict conformity, than
Governor Macquarrie has shown, to the tenor of your Lordship's
instructions.</p>
<p>The influence of the governor's example should be limited to
those occasions alone, when his notice of the emancipated
convicts cannot give offence to the feelings of others, or to
persons whose objections to associate with them are known. The
introduction of them on public occasions should in my opinion be
discontinued; and when it is known that they have been so far
noticed by the governor of New South Wales, as to be admitted to
his Private table and society, the benefit of the governor's
example may be expected to operate; and it will also be exempt
from the fatal suspicion of any exercise of his authority.</p>
<p>I have thus, my Lord, endeavoured to point out to your
Lordship, in the first part of my observations, the circumstances
that appeared to me to have diminished the effect of the
punishment of transportation in New South Wales, with such
remarks upon the conduct of the persons engaged in it as your
Lordship's instructions seemed to me to require. In the
performance of this duty, I conceived it to be as consonant to
your Lordship's wishes to add to the information that you already
possessed upon these subjects, as to endeavour to correct the
representations that from time to time had reached you. After
concluding this statement, it became my duty to submit to your
Lordship the measures by which I have considered that the effect
of the punishment of transportation might be restored and
preserved, both in the settled districts and in those that I have
recommended for the future employment of the convicts.</p>
<p>I have omitted for the present any mention of the measures of
police that may be advisable either in the old or the new
settlements, as I conceive that they will be better understood by
reserving there until I come to the mention of that particular
branch of my subject.</p>
<p>It has appeared to me that by removing the settlements
destined for the reception of convicts transported for long
terms, and for offences of a capital nature, from all contact
with those that are mow settled or likely to become so; a
salutary distinction may be made between the different degrees of
crime, and that the hardships of restraint, of privation of
comforts, of severe labour, and of restricted food, may be made
compatible with the benefits of present cultivation, and of
future colonization.</p>
<p>It will depend entirely upon the governor of New South Wales,
and the commandants of the different settlements, to maintain
that just degree of severity and rigour by which alone the
punishment of transportation may be made a subject of dread, even
to the worst offenders; and to refuse, with unrelenting
sternness, all applications that may have the effect of producing
inequalities in it.</p>
<p>The extent of country now unoccupied in the districts in which
the intended settlements are to be made, will afford
opportunities of gradually removing the convicts from the evils
of too near or too frequent association with each other, and of
separating those whose habits of criminality are confirmed.</p>
<p>At the expiration of terms of service, bearing reference to
the length of the sentences, and always to their good conduct in
those settlements; I think that the convicts thus inured to
labour and to restraint, will have a greater chance of becoming
useful labourers, on their return to the settled districts, than
if they were allowed, as they hitherto have been, to partake
immediately of indulgences that are quite inconsistent with a
date of punishment or reform. Upon their return to these
districts, they should first be assigned to the settlers; and
after continuing in their service for some time (the duration of
the period of service bearing reference to the extent of their
punishment, combined with a consideration of their good conduct)
tickets of leave should be granted to them. After a successful
exertion of their industry in this condition, grants of land,
under the limitations I have had the honour of submitting to your
Lordship, may be made to them on receiving their remissions of
sentence.</p>
<p>With these observations I beg leave most respectfully to
conclude my Report upon the first article of instruction with
which I was furnished.</p>

<br>
<b>DIRECTIONS and Regulations for the conduct of the New
Settlements at Moreton Bay, Port Bowen, and Port Curteis.</b></p>
<p><small>THE</small> settlements at Port Bowen, Moreton Bay, and
Port Curteis, are to be considered as receptacles for the
convicts that have been transported to New South Wales for heavy
offences, and for long terms, as well as for those who have,
during their residence in the settled districts of the colony,
shown, by their bad conduct, that they required a more severe and
rigid system of discipline than those districts were capable of
affording.</p>
<p>The Commandants of these settlements will therefore impress
upon the minds of the convicts, on their arrival, that the change
that has taken place in their condition, and the removal to which
it has led, from the settled districts of the colony, has been
the consequence of their crimes; and that nothing but a patient
endurance of the hardships which they now have to encounter, and
a manifestation of corrected habits, will lead to a termination
of them.</p>
<p>The name, age, sentence, place of trial, trade, condition,
date of arrival in the settlement, and name of the transport ship
of each convict, will be entered in separate columns of an
alphabetical register, with a number to each name, which must
thenceforth be invariably observed.</p>
<p>The copies of the indents that will be transmitted to the
commandants by the colonial secretary, together with all
documents relative to the conduct and character of the convicts,
will be carefully kept and preserved by him.</p>
<p>A copy of the hulk-list, and a copy of the report made by the
surgeon of the transport ship, and the remarks therein contained,
upon the conduct of the convicts, will be transmitted to the
commandant; and he will cause a copy to be made fur the guidance
and instruction of the superintendent of convicts. In doing this,
great care must be taken to prevent any communication of these
remarks to the convicts themselves.</p>
<p>In order to prevent the necessity of quartering the convicts,
newly arrived, upon those who have already been provided with
lodging, and to prevent them from being plundered of any property
that they may have brought with them, a large and long dormitory,
capable of containing 250 men, must be provided for their
temporary accommodation, and until they have erected houses for
themselves.</p>
<p>The superintendent of convicts will cause an accurate account
to be taken of the property that each convict may have brought
with him, and of the quantity of clothes and bedding, adding this
statement in a separate column of the alphabetical register of
names.</p>
<p>The commandant will impress upon the convicts the expediency
of depositing any cash that they may have brought with them, in
the savings-bank at Sydney, and will furnish each convict with an
acknowledgment of the directors of that establishment for the
sums so deposited, taking care always to transmit the name of the
convict, with his number, iii the alphabetical register, and the
name of the ship by which he came, and to require these
particulars to be noted in the acknowledgment by the
directors.</p>
<p>The commandant will recommend to the convicts, on their
arrival, to deliver into the hands of the superintendent, for
safe custody, all articles of property, or wearing apparel, that
they may have brought with them, declaring at the same time that
no other dress will be allowed to be worn than that which is
specially appointed by government.</p>
<p>The distribution of the convicts, and the separation of them
in the huts that they are themselves to build, must be made with
reference to the characters that are given of them. The number in
each but should not exceed two; and the only indulgence that
should be shown to their own feelings, in classing them, should
be in favour of the national one that is always found to prevail
amongst transported convicts, and especially amongst the
Irish.</p>
<p>The huts in which the convicts are to be lodged, should be
constructed, as nearly as possible, upon the model of those at
Pennant Hills, near Paramatta. The windows of these huts should
be made of wood, and be made to swing on hinges like the ports of
a man of war; and the floors should be laid with rough boards,
and always be raised above around.</p>
<p>It should be distinctly understood and observed, that in the
construction of these huts, no other implements will be allowed
than nails and axes; and that the bark of the eucalyptus is to
form the covering and sides of the hut.</p>
<p>The huts should be placed at a distance of not less than two
yards from each other, in straight lines, each line being
separated from the opposite one by a distance of 50 feet; leaving
30 for at street, and 10 feet on each side for footpaths.</p>
<p>The direction of these streets should be straight; and, as
nearly as possible, parallel to each other; houses fur two
overseers should be placed at both ends of each street, and
commanding a view of it, to ensure a constant superintendence of
the convicts during their hours of rest.</p>
<p>The contiguity of, or easy access to, fresh water, will
determine the precise situation in which the settlements are to
be formed: but it is not advisable that the huts in which the
convicts are lodged should be immediately contiguous to the
landing-place, or to the sea shore.</p>
<p>The residence of the commandant, and the military barrack,
should be placed upon any elevated situation that will command a
view of the settlement, sufficiently near to observe it, and to
afford early assistance, and yet so much removed as to prevent
communication between the soldiers and the convicts.</p>
<p>It should be understood by the convicts, that they are to have
no property whatever in their huts, and that misconduct always
lead to a forfeiture of the accommodation that they afford. Those
who show themselves unworthy of enjoying it, either by rioting,
quarrelling, gambling or thieving, should be lodged in a barrack
by themselves; the construction of which may be similar to that
lately provided at Newcastle. This barrack should be surrounded
with a high paling, and enclosing a cooking-house for the
separate use of the convicts confined in it.</p>
<p>In the rear of every fourth but there should be placed
water-troughs, at which the convicts should be made to wash
themselves on their return to breakfast, after the first hours of
labour in the morning.</p>
<p>In their huts no furniture should be allowed but their
bedding, and two stools; and these should be examined once a
week, by an overseer, who should report all deficiencies to the
principal superintendent.</p>
<p>A gang of washers should be appointed to wash the blankets,
and air the palliasses, as well as to furnish them with clean
straw.</p>
<p>The convicts are to be mustered in gangs, at daylight, on
every morning, except Sundays, by their overseers; and the names
of those who are missing are to be immediately reported, in
writing, to the principal superintendent, who will visit the
separate gangs on uncertain days and hours, for the purpose of
checking the returns of the overseers. The hours of labour for
the convicts will be from daylight to 8 o'clock; one hour and a
half will then be allowed for cleaning themselves and breakfast;
from half past 9 till 12, the work will be resumed. One hour will
be allowed for dinner, and the work will continue from I o'clock
till sunset.</p>
<p>The returns of the principal superintendent will be made out
on two days in each week, from the daily lists of the overseers
of each gang, according to a printed form, in which the number of
each gang, on each day of the week, will appear; and when
submitted to the commandant, and signed by him, will be an
authority to the officer of the commissariat department to issue
rations.</p>
<p>The labour of the convicts at the settlements of Port Bowen,
Port Curteis, and Moreton Bay, is to be devoted, in the first
place, to the construction of such buildings as are immediately
required; secondly, to the cutting and sawing of wood, and
clearing the ground from roots; and thirdly, to the cultivation
of maize, vegetables, flax and tobacco, and the collection and
preparation of bark. As the convicts are to be lodged in huts of
their own construction, the buildings to be undertaken will
consist of the following: A house for the commandant; barracks
for the officers and soldiers; a storehouse for the provisions; a
quarter for the chaplain; a quarter for the officer of the
commissariat department; a quarter for the surgeon; an hospital,
with cooking-houses for each; a washhouse; four cooking-houses
for the convicts, each of them large enough to dress provisions
for 500 men; four mess-rooms for the convicts; houses for the
overseers; a working shed, surrounded with a paling, and
containing two forges; eight saw pits, covered, and a carpenters
shop; a prison, containing two large rooms, and 20 cells for the
solitary confinement of convicts; a chapel.</p>
<p>In the construction of these buildings, no other objects are
to be considered than solidity and accommodation; and, with the
exception of the chimneys, the provision-store, and the gaol, are
to be built entirely of wood.</p>
<p>The provision-store should be situated as near as may be found
convenient to the landing-place and the sea beach, and with as
much exposure as possible to the sea breeze. It should consist of
three stories, of which the lowest should be 14 feet in height;
the floor being elevated two feet above the ground, and each of
the two upper stories being eight feet in heighth: The staircases
to this building should be on the outside, giving access to any
one of the stories, without unnecessarily opening the others.</p>
<p>The house of the commandant at Newcastle, the overseers houses
there, and the chapel at Pennant Hills, may respectively be taken
as fit subjects of imitation in the same buildings at the new
establishments.</p>
<p>When these buildings are completed, the labour of the convicts
will be altogether devoted to the cultivation of land in maize,
flax and tobacco, and the procuring of timber and bark for
exportation to Port Jackson, and the southern settlements.</p>
<p>The object to be kept in view by the commandants and the
superintendents of convicts at these establishments, is the
constant employment of the convicts in labour that mill raise a
proportion of the food required for their on subsistence, and
make some return to government for the expense which is incurred
in their clothing and maintenance.</p>
<p>In pursuing these objects, the superintendents of convicts
will bear in mind, that in the several species of labour that
have been assigned for the employment of the convicts, there is a
positive difference that is always to be taken advantage of, stud
to be adapted to the nature of the offences of which they have
been guilty, and to be subject to no other limitation than the
physical capacity of the individual. Thus, to the worst
description of men, must be given the labour of loading and
unloading, and removing heavy weights; that of cutting and sawing
the largest trees, and the hardest timber; and generally, those
employments that have the greatest tendency to exhaust the
strength.</p>
<p>To the men of better character should be assigned the lighter
operations of agriculture and gardening, the care of cattle, and
the driving of carts; and it should be considered and understood,
as an invariable rule, that the nature and extent of the labour
of a convict are to be determined by his character and conduct,
and not by his capacity, or the wants of the establishment.</p>
<p>The mechanics that successively arrive are to be employed in
the several trades described in the return, as long as the
construction of buildings, and the nature of the labour in which
the convicts may be employed, shall require it.</p>
<p>It is not advisable that task-work should be given to, men, as
it is not intended that they shall apply, to their own benefit,
any portion of the day that they may save, after their task is
completed. It will, however, be the duty of the superintendent to
proportion the amount of labour performed by each convict to the
greatest quantity that his strength will allow him to perform
during the day, More with a view to determine that quantity, than
to excite the men to an earlier or quicker performance of it.</p>
<p>As it is of great importance that this work should be
punctually and accurately measured, one person, to be named by
the deputy superintendent, will be specially charged with this
duty, and will make a report daily to his superior.</p>
<p>It is considered, that in all the severer parts of
agricultural labour, such as cutting timber, sawing, ploughing,
burning off, hoeing and billing maize, the quantity of work
required of each convict may be defined. In other operations of a
more complex kind, the quantity cannot easily be fixed, and they
are therefore, as much as possible, to be avoided.</p>
<p>The convicts, not assigned, are not to be allowed to cultivate
land on their own account, or to give their assistance, in any
shape, to the overseers in the cultivation of the portions that
will be allowed to them.</p>
<p>A station will be selected by the commandant for the draught
cattle that will be employed In assisting the construction of the
buildings, and the cultivation of the land; at which it will be
necessary to place an overseer, and a few convicts under him.</p>
<p>A station and stock-yard are to be made for the reception of a
breeding herd of cattle and swine, and a flock of sheep for the
use of the settlement, which should also be placed under the care
of an overseer, and a certain number of convicts.</p>
<p>Monthly reports of the increase and decrease of the stock, are
to be made by the overseer to the commandant of the settlement,
and to the officer of the commissariat department. No person
whatever is to have any interest in the herds or stock; and no
cattle or stock, belonging to individuals are to be allowed to
graze with or near them.</p>
<p>The herds and stock are to be placed under the control and
responsibility of the officer of the commissariat department, who
will include a statement of the increase and decrease in his
quarterly returns to the chief of the department, for the
information of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's
Treasury.</p>
<p>The supply of fresh meat from the government herds, for the
use of the settlement, is to be regulated by the officer of the
commissariat department; and a quarterly return of the quantity
so supplied is to be made to the commandant, and by him to be
transmitted to the governor of New South Wales. A similar return
will be made to the chief of the commissariat department at head
quarters.</p>
<p>The issues of provisions are to be made twice a week, and to
consist of the following rations: seven pounds of salt beef, or
four pounds of salt pork, five pounds of wheaten flour, and five
pounds of maize flour.</p>
<p>As the state of the herds and flocks may allow, rations of one
pound of fresh meat per day will be issued in lieu of the salt
meat.</p>
<p>Five pounds of wheaten flour, mid two pounds of flour of
maize, (producing eight pounds of bread) are to be baked for the
convicts, and served out daily to them one day old.</p>
<p>The remaining three pounds of flour of maize are to be boiled
and prepared for their breakfast, every morning in the week, with
a proportion of the allowance of half a pound of sugar.</p>
<p>The only increase to this ration is to be made in the flour of
maize to convicts who conduct themselves well, by adding two
pounds to the allowance of maize flour for breakfast and
supper.</p>
<p>A garden for the sole use of the convicts is to be immediately
formed for supplying pumpkins, potatoes, cabbages, and herbs.</p>
<p>The rations are to be prepared for the convicts by cooks and
bakers selected from them, mid are to be issued to them in messes
of six, and conveyed to them by one individual of the mess, to
prevent them from gambling for their rations. One overseer will
attend at each mess. table, at every meal, and one at each
cooking-house, to observe the issue of the rations, and to
prevent partiality in the distribution. As large a proportion of
vegetables as the garden will supply, and not exceeding half a
and to each convict, is to be constantly prepared with their
dinners, and served out with their rations of meat; when fresh
meat is issued, the broth in which it is boiled is to be served
with it.</p>
<p>All mess utensils are to be left at the mess-houses; and they
are to consist of one knife and fork, one spoon, one wooden
latter, one tin, pot, and one wooden bowl.</p>
<p>One overseer is to be appointed for the superintendence of the
cooking and baking, and messing, for the convicts of the
settlement; and to his care and control the mess apparatus is to
be delivered. A muster and inspection of this apparatus, as well
as of the bedding of the convicts, is to be made on the last
Saturday of every month, by the commandant; attended by the
superintendent of convicts; and a report of the deficiencies is
to be transmitted to the governor of New South Wales.</p>
<p>The clothing of each convict is to consist of two full suits
of the following articles: Two cotton striped shirts, one duck
frock, two duck trowsers, one straw hat, two pair of shoes.</p>
<p>The wash-house and care of the linen are to be placed under an
overseer, whose duty it will be to see that the linen is properly
washed and pressed by the gang of washers, and that it is issued
out to each convict twice a week from a laundry and store
adjoining.</p>
<p>Upon the issue of clothing to the convicts, care must be taken
to paint on each piece the number corresponding to the name of
each convict in the alphabetical register, and to make a separate
and accurate account of the date and quantity of clothing issued,
so as to check all complaints of the future want or waste of
it.</p>
<p>The clothes are to be changed on Wednesdays and Sundays, and
to be delivered to the convicts on the Sunday mornings, and on
Wednesdays on their return to breakfast.</p>
<p>Half a pound of soap is to be allowed to each convict per
week, and barbers are to be appointed to shrive them on the
Sundays and Wednesdays.</p>
<p>On Sunday mornings all the convicts at the establishment are
to be mustered at 6 o'clock by their overseers, and the principal
superintendent of convicts. Two hours will then be allowed for
cleaning themselves, and procuring a change of linen at the linen
store, and returning their dirty linen.</p>
<p>At 10 o'clock the convicts, in their clean dresses, are to be
mustered by the commandant, and their names called over in his
presence. He will then inquire into, and, if necessary, order
punishment for all deficiencies in their dress and clothing. One
half of the convicts will attend divine service in the morning,
and one half in the evening. During the hours of divine service,
every convict that does not attend church will be required to
remain in his hut, and will be punished if he is seen out of
it.</p>
<p>The bibles and prayer books, and religious tracts that are
sent on board the convict ships, with the convicts from England,
are to be sent with them from Sydney by the surgeon
superintendent, and addressed to the chaplain of the settlement.
To his care and discretion will be confided the distribution of
these books; and it is recommended that they should be returned,
by every convict, to the chaplain's house, after service, on each
Sunday. On ever Wednesday evening the labour of the day is to
close at four o'clock; and schools, for the instruction of such
convicts as are not able to read and write are to be formed,
teachers being selected by the chaplain from amongst the
convicts, who are to be rewarded for their trouble by an extra
ration of two pounds of bread per week.</p>
<p>The convicts who are not engaged in the schools are to attend
evening prayers, and a lecture in the chapel.</p>
<p>The direction of the labours of the convicts is to be placed
in the bands of the superintendent of convicts who will make a
weekly report of the nature of the employment of the convicts,
the number employed, and the quantity of work performed, to the
commandant. These reports, when signed by him, are to be
transmitted to the governor of New South Wales who will submit
them to the inspection and perusal of the chief engineer at
Sydney, for his report and observations.</p>
<p>When the buildings required at the several establishments are
completed, the labour of the convicts is to be devoted to the
raising of the produce hereinbefore specified, and to the
preparation of wood for exportation to the southern
settlements.</p>
<p>The vessels that will be employed to keep up a communication
between the southern and northern settlements are the only
vessels that are to be permitted to load at the latter skulk
places. If others touch there, they are to be allowed to obtain
water, but nothing else, of any description or kind whatsoever,
except in case of extreme distress. If the approach of vessels to
the harbour and anchorage be not visible at the settlement, the
commandant will place a signal-post and semaphore on some
elevated position, under the care of a corporal's guard, for the
purpose of giving the earliest intimation of the approach and
departure of vessels, and of any movement that may be made
towards them from the shore.</p>
<p>The semaphore should communicate to a signal-post placed near
the house of the commandant, and reports of the successive
signals should be made to the commandant, and to the
superintendent of convicts, as the vessels approach, and on their
departure, till they are out of sight. No boat, proceeding from
any vessel, is to be allowed to land, until a signal shall be
made from the shore. The master of the vessel is alone to be
permitted to land, to deliver his papers, and dispatches to the
commandant; and one landing-place only is to be allowed, and is
to be placed under the charge of a corporal's guard.</p>
<p>A specification of the cargoes of the vessels that proceed
from Sydney to the norther settlements is, invariably to
accompany the clearance signed by the naval officer. This
specification will be signed by the colonial secretary, and is to
set forth the contents of each package, and the name of the party
to whom it is addressed; the consignor being held responsible for
the conformity of the contents, both in quality and quantity, to
the description.</p>
<p>The clearance of the vessel from Sydney will contain the names
and description of the crew. It will be signed by the colonial
secretary, and dated according to the hour and day on which the
muster of the crew is taken. It is to be accompanied by the
receipt of the master for every article that is taken on
board.</p>
<p>If the vessel shall have remained at Sydney for any length of
time after the muster has been made by the colonial secretary,
the clearance is again to be signed, and certified to be correct,
by the naval officer.</p>
<p>No free person, except officers on the establishment, military
men, their wives and families, and free women proceeding to join
their husbands, will be permitted to repair to the new
settlements, or to reside there.</p>
<p>The vessels clearing out from Sydney to any of the three
northern settlements must proceed thither direct.</p>
<p>The captain's journal is to be submitted to the inspection of
the commandant, and an account of the expenditure of provisions
put on board fur the use of the crew and convicts, and guard,
stating also, the remains then on board, is to be submitted to
the commissariat officer at the settlement.</p>
<p>Every effort of the commandant is to be directed to prevent
the importation of spirituous liquors, or of any species of
luxury that is not authorized by the colonial secretary at
Sydney, for for the use of the free inhabitants of the
settlement. To the convicts no other article of luxury or
indulgence is to be allowed to be sent from Sydney, than those of
tea and sugar; and those only in small quantities to the convicts
who are married. Free women, who may be permitted to join their
husbands, must be made acquainted with this restriction, and be
strictly bound by it. To these persons the prohibition of
importing spirits is more particularly applicable than to any
others of the free inhabitants.</p>
<p>The quantity of spirits allowed to be imported by each of the
free overseers, is not to exceed 50 gallons in any one year after
their first arrival; mad the sale of spirits, by such persons, to
the convicts for their labour, is to be punished in an overseer
by suspension of his pay, for a period not exceeding six
months.</p>
<p>A duplicate account of all supplies sent from the commissariat
department at head quarters to the new settlements, is to
accompany the specifications of the cargoes of the government
vessels, and to be addressed to the respective commandants of
those stations.</p>
<p>Accounts are to be kept by the commandants and superintendents
of convicts of the quantities of wood, flax, bark, tobacco and
maize, that are cut, raised, and prepared by the labour of the
convicts at each settlement, specifying the name of the overseer,
the names and number of the gang or gangs of convicts by whom the
produce has respectively been raised. Copies of these accounts
are to accompany the specifications of the cargoes of the vessels
in which this produce is embarked, and are to be addressed to the
colonial secretary, and the chief engineer at Sydney.</p>
<p>No article of any kind is to be allowed to be exported by any
person from the new settlements, without the permission of the
commandant; and no article of wood, flax, bark, tobacco or maize,
is to be allowed to be exported by individuals, whether free or
convict.</p>
<p>An account of every article exported or put on board the
government vessels is to be entered in a book to be kept by the
commandant, who will transmit a copy thereof, signed by himself,
together with the receipt of the captain, to the commandant of
the next station, ii the vessel proceeds thither, and to the
colonial secretary, if the vessel proceeds to Sydney. Upon the
arrival at Sydney of a sufficient quantity of produce from the
new settlements, the chief engineer, with the permission and
direction of the governor of New South Wales, will cause a notice
to be inserted in the Gazette of a public sale by auction of the
said produce; the same being first divided into lots,
corresponding to the place of production, and, as nearly as
possible, to the different gangs and overseers by whose labour it
has been raised.</p>
<p>The account sales are to be made out in triplicate, and signed
by the auctioneer and chief engineer; and one copy thereof is to
be transmitted to the colonial secretary, for the information of
His Majesty's Secretary of State for the colonies, another to the
commandant of the respective settlement, the produce of which has
been the subject of sale, and another copy is to be transmitted
to the chief officer of the commissariat department in the
colony, to whom the proceeds are to be paid.</p>
<p>The proceeds are to be applied in the following manner:
fifteen sixteenths are to be carried to the credit of the public
account of the colony, and one eighth of the remaining sixteenth
is to be paid to the principal superintendent of each settlement,
and the remaining seven eighths to the several overseers of the
gangs, according to the amount of the respective produce of their
labour.</p>
<p>The clearances of the government vessels, proceeding from any
of the new settlements to Sydney, or from one settlement to
another, are to contain lists of the crew, and are to be signed
by the commandants.</p>
<p>No person whatever, whether civil or military, is to be
permitted to leave the settlements, or to remove from one to the
other, except in case of illness, or urgent necessity, without
the permission of the governor of New South Wales.</p>
<p>The wives of the convicts sent to the new settlements will be
permitted to join their husbands; and, with their children, to
reside there.</p>
<p>Separate huts are to be provided for the married convicts, and
they are to be built in a separate part of the settlement.</p>
<p>All letters that are conveyed by the government vessels must
be received from the post-office at Sydney, and must be delivered
to the respective commandants by the masters of the said vessels,
mho will be liable to a penalty of one month's pay for the breach
of that regulation.</p>
<p>The commandants will be allowed to exercise a discretion in
opening any letters that are addressed to convicts; and all
letters addressed by them are to be delivered to the commandants,
and to be sent to the post-office at Sydney in a bag, sealed with
the seal of the commandant.</p>
<p>No communication is to be permitted between the crews of the
government vessels touching at the new settlements, Laid the
convicts there; and the vessels are to be loaded by their crews,
and not by the convicts.</p>
<p>All sailors belonging to the Government vessels are to be on
board before eight o'clock on every evening, under pain of being
stopped by the sentries, and apprehended by the constables, and
of being confined for the night, together with a forfeiture of
one month's wages.</p>
<p>The same regulation must extend to the masters and mates of
vessels.</p>
<p>No free person is to be allowed to go on board a government
vessel without a pass signed by the commandant; and no convict,
or boat's crew composed of convicts, is to be allowed to go on
board a government vessel, either approaching or at anchor in the
harbour. Sentries must be ordered to enforce this regulation with
strictness and vigilance, and to fire at any boat or boats that
wilfully disregard a first caution.</p>
<p>To prevent the concealment and escapes of the convicts on
board the government vessels, it is expedient that they should
quit their anchorage at an hour to be fixed by the commandant, so
as to enable the superintendents of convicts to muster the gangs
immediately, or as nearly as may be, before the departure of the
vessel. Any master or sailor, belonging to a government vessel,
that shall be proved to have assisted in, or connived at, the
concealment of a convict on board his vessel, or to have received
any reward for assisting him to make his escape, shall be liable
to be imprisoned in the common gaol at Sydney, for a period not
exceeding twelve months, and to forfeit his wages for a period
not exceeding one year.</p>
<p>The commandants will order all government vessels, that anchor
within half a mile of the landing-places at each settlement, to
deposit their sails in the commissariat store, or other safe
place, the to remain during the stay of the vessel at that
settlement.</p>
<p>It is recommended, that as few boats as possible shall be kept
for the use of the settlement: they are to be chained and locked,
and hauled up every evening; and the oars and sails taken out,
and deposited in the guardhouse.</p>
<p>The commandants of the different settlements will select from
amongst the convicts sent thither the men of best character, and
will appoint them to be constables: they are to be placed under
the care and control of the chief constable.</p>
<p>The chief constable will report in writing to the commandants,
at ten o'clock every morning, the occurrences of the preceding
night; and will present a list of all prisoners who may have been
committed for any offences, either on the complaints of overseers
or of other convicts.</p>
<p>The commandants will proceed to take the information of the
several parties on oath; and will cause the evidence to be taken
down in writing, read over to the witnesses, and then to be
signed with their names or marks.</p>
<p>The commandants, after considering the evidence, will give
such sentence as the several cases may appear to them to
deserve.</p>
<p>The commandants, when sitting alone, are not to inflict a
greater corporal punishment Than so lashes.</p>
<p>When assisted by one or more of the military or civil officers
of the settlement, they will have the power of inflicting 100
lashes.</p>
<p>For the correction of ordinary offences, of neglect of work,
resistance or insolence to overseers, petty thefts, and the use
of indecent language or oaths,&mdash;the augmentation of labour,
and the diminution of food, will be found more effectual than
corporal punishments.</p>
<p>Convicts guilty of these offences should be placed and made to
sleep on one room of the barracks; should be made to work in the
heavy-work gang; and should be deprived of the breakfast
allowance which should be given in augmentation of the allowance
of the convicts who conduct themselves well.</p>
<p>They should further be made to work in chains at some labour
of a determinate quantity.</p>
<p>They should also be ordered to work in a tread-wheel, and to
grind into flour the maize that is ordered to be issued for the
rations of the convicts.</p>
<p>They should likewise be punished by solitary confinement in
the cells of the gaol, and by a reduction of the daily allowance
of food to that of one pound of bread per day.</p>
<p>The overseers are to be prohibited from striking the convicts
placed in their charge, and are to report all offences committed
by them to the superintendent.</p>
<p>The commandants will take care that the daily entries of
proceedings in the register of offences are made with accuracy,
and that they are always signed by themselves.</p>
<p>The registers of offences are be made up and concluded at the
end of every year; and an alphabetical reference is to be kept,
and accompany each register, in which the name of ash every
convict who has been brought before the commandant and
magistrates within that period, together with his number in the
general alphabetical register, and the term of his original
sentence, should be set forth.</p>
<p>A nominal list of all offenders that have been brought before
the commandant and magistrates, with a description of their
offences, their number in the general alphabetical register, the
date of their sentence and punishment, and the term of their
original sentence (according to the form in the Appendix), is to
be transmitted every quarter by the commandant to the colonial
secretary, who will cause a copy of it to be delivered to the
principal superintendent of convicts there.</p>
<p>All offences committed by convicts at either of the new
settlements, except that of murder, are to be tried and punished
by the commandants and magistrates.</p>
<p>The separation of the convicts, in their hours of labour as
well as of leisure, must be particularly attended to by the
superintendent.</p>
<p>As he will possess more ample means of informing himself of
their proceedings and conduct titan any other person, he will
order any change to be made in the individuals of each gang, that
may appear to hint to be necessary, for the separation of the
convicts that are well conducted, and that manifest a disposition
to reform, from those whose habits, conduct and conversation only
corrupt their associates. This system of separation may be
introduced into their labour, their lodging, and their meals; and
the superintendent of convicts is not only to enforce it as a
matter of duty, and to punish any violation of it, but always to
bear in mind, that although productive labour is to be considered
the lot of every convict sent to the new establishments, yet,
that whenever the plan upon which it is conducted shall be found
to interfere with the great object of reforming them, it must be
immediately changed or modified.</p>
<p>With a view to give more effectual separation to the convicts,
the commandants will from time to time, and as the number
increases by new arrivals, order separate establishments to be
formed in the interior of the country, at a distance of to or 15
miles from the principal settlement.</p>
<p>The buildings are in no case to exceed in number those
required for an overseer, a store for provisions, and a place of
confinement. The huts of the convicts will be constructed in the
same manner as those already described.</p>
<p>The commandants will frequently visit these detached
settlements, and inquire into and observe their progress;
reporting the same, as well mall occurrences at the principal
settlement, to the colonial secretary at Sydney.</p>
<p>The commandants will at all times pay attention to the
complaints of the convicts, and cause investigations to be made
into them: they will likewise frequently inspect the state of
their provisions and clothing.</p>
<p>The commandants are to make quarterly returns to the chief
engineer at Sydney, of all stores received, expended, and
remaining at each settlement; and to state the manner in which
they have been applied and expended.</p>
<p>The chief engineer at Sydney will give directions from time to
time for the buildings that are to be undertaken at the several
settlements, and will transmit plans for the same, when they have
been submitted to, and approved by, the Governor of New South
Wales.</p>
<p>The commandants of the different settlements, either in
forming the principal ones, or in making others, will not fail to
bear in mind, that the great objects proposed are, the employment
of the convicts in those kinds of labour that admit of
augmentation and diminution, proportioned to the past and present
conduct of the different convicts; that also admit of their
separation, and that at the same time create in many of them, and
fix in all, a knowledge of those kinds of labour that are
hereafter to become the means of their support.</p>
<p>The commandants will be careful to withdraw from the view or
reach of the convicts, all temptations to wander from the
settlements, and for this purpose will give permission to the
officers and soldiers alone to keep dogs, for taking kangaroos
and emus. Every opportunity should be given to drive them from
the neighbourhood of the settlements in the early periods of the
establishment; provided, however, that no convicts are to be
allowed to engage in this occupation.</p>
<p>The commandants will take the earliest opportunities of
establishing a friendly intercourse with the black natives of the
country, and punish severely any ill treatment of them by the
soldiers or convicts.</p>
<p>The black natives should be encouraged to apprehend all
fugitive convicts, and rewarded for such exertions with presents
of corn, fish-hooks, and blankets.</p>
<p>The commandants will from time to time transmit to the
Governor of New South Vales the names of such convicts as shall
in their opinion be deserving of removal to the settled districts
of the colony: to each name there must be added the number in the
general alphabetical register, his original sentence, its date,
the date of his arrival in the colony, the ship in which he came
and his occupation in the settlement, and his character for
industry and obedience.</p>
<p>The commandants are required to make a distinction between
cases, wherein a simple removal of a convict is recommended to
the settled districts, and those where they think that a further
indulgence of a ticket of leave may be added on their arrival
there, stating the special circumstances upon which the
distinction is founded.</p>
<p>Before he accedes to these recommendations, the Governor of
New South Wales will have reference to the nominal list of
offences transmitted every quarter by the commandants to the
colonial secretary, and will by that means be able to satisfy
himself whether the convicts recommended have been guilty of any
offences previous to the period or recommendation, and whether
such offences are of a nature to constitute just ground of
refusal.</p>
<p>Upon the receipt of this list from any of the new settlements,
the Governor of New South Wales, after determining the number of
convicts that in his judgment are fit to be removed, will order a
notice to be inserted in the Sydney Gazette, informing the
inhabitants of the colony, that a certain number of convict
labourers, or mechanics, are allowed to repair to Sydney, and
requiring, that all persons who are in want of such servants
should make application to the colonial secretary, and be in
readiness to receive such convicts on their arrival, or to
appoint places to which they may be sent.</p>
<p>The names of such convicts as are deemed by the Governor of
New South Wales fit to be rewarded with tickets of leave, are to
be inserted in the Sydney Gazette, together with the name of the
district in which they are to reside.</p>

acknowledged by Governor Macquarie, 22nd February, 1820.)<br></p>
<p align="right">Downing Street, 30th January, 1819.   </p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>The Prince Regent, having had under his consideration the
actual Circumstances of the Colony under your Government, more
particularly with a view of ascertaining how far in its present
improved and increasing State, it is susceptible of being made
adequate to the Objects of its original Institution, has been
pleased to direct that a special Commissioner <a href="#note-001"
name="noteref-001" id="noteref-001">{1}</a> should proceed to New
South Wales, and should there conduct the enquiries necessary to
this important Object.</p>
<p>The Gentleman selected for this Duty is Mr. John Thomas Bigge,
<a href="#note-002" name="noteref-002" id="noteref-002">{2}</a>
who has for many years filled a high Judicial Situation in one of
His Majesty's Colonies with the Entire Approbation of His Royal
Highness The Prince Regent.</p>
<p>In order to explain to you more distinctly the Objects of his
Appointment, I have the Honor to enclose a Copy of the
Commission, and of the Instructions with which he has been
furnished.</p>
<p>As it may be necessary for him in the course of his Enquiry to
have the Power of Administering an Oath to the Persons, whose
Testimony he may require, it is the Pleasure of His Royal
Highness that you should immediately on his arrival in the Colony
appoint him a Justice of the Peace and Magistrate for the
Territory; you will further give him every Facility of Access to
Official Documents, and every other Assistance in your power in
the prosecution of the Objects of his Commission.</p>
<p>During the interval, which has elapsed between Mr. Bigge's
Appointment and his Departure for the Colony, he had free access
to all the Correspondence connected with the Colony, and has been
put perfectly in possession of the views of His Majesty's
Government; His Royal Highness has therefore been pleased to
instruct Mr. Bigge to recommend to your immediate Adoption any
Alteration or Improvement of the System at present in force in
the Colony, which he may consider necessary either for the Remedy
of existing Evils, or for the prevention of Causes of Complaint
in future, and I have only to desire that you would give to his
recommendations in this particular the weight due to them by an
early, if not an immediate, adoption of them. Should however any
case occur, in which you may deem it adviseable to take upon
yourself the heavy responsibility of declining to adopt his
suggestions, you will communicate to me without delay the reasons
of your Refusal for the special consideration and Decision of His
Royal Highness.</p>

<p align="center"><b>EARL BATHURST TO MR. COMMISSIONER BIGGE.
[1]</b></p>
<p align="right">Downing Street, 6th January, 1819.   </p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>As the time is now approaching for your Departure for New
South Wales in the execution of the Duty to which His Royal
Highness The Prince Regent has been pleased to appoint you, it
becomes my Duty to direct your attention to those points which
will, on your arrival in the Colony, form the leading Object of
your Enquiry.</p>
<p>You are aware of the causes which first led to the Formation
of the Settlements in New Holland. As they were peculiar in
themselves, these Settlements cannot be administered with the
usual Reference to those general Principles of Colonial Policy,
which are applicable to other Foreign Possessions of His Majesty,
Not having been established with any view to Territorial or
Commercial Advantages, they must chiefly be considered as
Receptacles for Offenders, in which Crimes may be executed at a
distance from home by punishments sufficiently severe to deter
others from the Commission of Crimes, and so regulate, as to
operate the Reform of the Persons by whom they had been
committed. So long as they continue destined by the Legislature
of the Country to these purposes, their Growth as Colonies must
be a Secondary Consideration, and the leading Duty of those, to
whom their Administration is entrusted, will be to keep up in
them such a system of just discipline, as may render
Transportation an Object of serious Apprehension. While the
Settlements were in their Infancy, the Regulations, to which
Convicts were subjected on their arrival, were sufficiently
severe, and were moreover capable of being strictly and uniformly
enforced. Hard Labour, moderate Food, and constant
Superintendance were, and (what was at least of as much
Importance) were believed in this Country to be the inevitable
consequences of a Sentence of Transportation, varying only as to
the period during which they were enforced, either according to
the original Sentences of the Convicts or to the Evidence, which
their Conduct in the Settlement afforded of their Progress
towards Amendment and Reform. At this time it appears that
Transportation to New South Wales answered every end of
Punishment; For while it operated, not very severely though
always beneficially, on the Convicts themselves, the opinion of
its severity in this Country was so enhanced by the distance of
the Settlement and the little which was known of it, that it was
an object here of peculiar Apprehension. <a href="#note-003"
name="noteref-003" id="noteref-003">{3}</a> There are instances
on record, in which Convicts have expressed their desire that the
Sentence of Transportation might be commuted even for the utmost
Rigour of the Law, and it is not too much to assert that the
Punishment did then materially contribute to prevent the
Commission of those Crimes to which it was at that time more
particularly confined.</p>
<p>Many Circumstances however have since concurred to render the
Punishment lighter in itself, to diminish the Apprehension
entertained in this Country of its Severity, and to break down
all proportion between the punishment and the Crimes for which it
is now inflicted.</p>
<p>You will find these circumstances detailed in my Letter
<a href="#note-004" name="noteref-004" id="noteref-004">{4}</a>
to Lord Sidmouth, in which I first suggested the expediency of
this Commission. Every Information which I have since received,
and every consideration which I have since given to the subject,
confirms me in the conviction that an Investigation is become
necessary. Since the writing of that Letter, Intelligence has
been received of the arrival of that large body of Convicts,
which I then noticed to be under Sentence of Transportation, and
the number, on whom this Sentence has since been passed, has
considerably increased. In addition to which, a Great proportion
is for Offences of that Magnitude in Moral Depravity, or of such
serious Mischief to Society, as have been generally expiated by
the utmost Rigour of the Law. While Transportation to New South
Wales is thus applied as an adequate Punishment for the most
Heinous Crimes, it unfortunately at the same time carries with it
in Public Estimation so little of Apprehension in any proportion
to the Guilt of the Convicts, that numerous applications are made
from those who are sentenced to Imprisonment for Minor
Transgressions that they may be allowed to participate in the
Punishment to which the greatest Offenders are condemned.</p>
<p>Such being the actual State of Things, it appears to The
Prince Regent most important that the first Object of your
Enquiry should be to ascertain whether any and what Alteration in
the existing system of the Colony can render it available to the
purpose of its original Institution, and adequate for its more
extended application. With a view to this you will examine how
far it may be possible to enforce in the Colonies already
established, a System of General Discipline, Constant Work, and
Vigilant Superintendance. The Latter must necessarily be
understood to comprise complete separation from the Mass of the
Population, and more or less of personal Confinement, according
to the Magnitude of the Offence. You will therefore pay
particular Attention to the possibility of providing Buildings
proper to the Reception of all the Convicts, the want of such
Buildings having been frequently and justly represented by the
Governor as one main Obstacle to the Enforcement of Discipline.
Should it appear to you, as I have too much reason to apprehend
will be the Result, that the present Settlements are not capable
of undergoing any efficient Change, the next Object for your
Consideration will be the expediency of abandoning them
altogether as Receptacles for Convicts, and forming on other
parts of the Coasts, or in the Interior of the Country, distinct
Establishments exclusively for the Reception and proper
Employment of the Convicts who may hereafter be sent out. From
such a Measure, it is obvious that many Advantages must result.
It would effectually separate the Convict from the Free
Population; the Labour of forming a New Settlement would afford
constant means of Employment and that of a severer Description.
By forming more than one of such separate Establishments, the
means of classifying the Offenders, according to the Degrees of
Crime, would be facilitated, and that salutary Apprehension of
the punishment revived, which can alone make it available to the
grave Offences to which it is at present applied. But on the
other hand you will have to consider, what would in the first
instance be the expence of the measures, which you might think
yourself justified in recommending, and what may be the probable
Amount of Annual Charge, which may result from their Adoption. I
need not impress upon you the necessity of making your Estimates
as accurate as circumstances will admit, for it will be obvious
to you that in order to enable His Majesty's Government to decide
whether it is adviseable to continue, or to alter, or to abandon
the System, which for near Forty Years has been pursued, it will
be most material for them to know, not only the means by which
Transportation can be rendered an effectual Punishment for the
Prevention of Crime, but also the Expence at which, as compared
with other Systems of Punishment, it can be enforced.</p>
<p>I have only in conclusion to desire that you will in the whole
course of your enquiries constantly bear in mind that
Transportation to New South Wales is intended as a severe
Punishment applied to various Crimes, and as such must be
rendered an Object of real Terror to all Classes of the
Community. You must be aware that it is taking but an imperfect
view of the end of Punishment, if you look only to the state of
those on whom it is inflicted. The Great End of Punishment is the
Prevention of Crime, and as there are gradations in Crimes,
against the Commission of which the Legislature is bound to guard
in proportion to their moral Turpitude or to the injurious
Effects which, either necessarily in themselves or from the
Circumstances under which they were practised, they may have on
the Community, the sufferings of those, to whom punishment is
awarded, do not answer the purpose for which they were inflicted,
unless they are in some degree proportioned to the Offences
committed, and of a Character to deter others from Similar
Misdeeds. Transportation must not be considered like imprisonment
in Gaol applicable to the suspected and unfortunate in common
with the criminal, but it operates exclusively on convicted
Guilt, and that too as a part (not the most effectual part) of
the punishment assigned to it. For mere Expatriation is not in
these days an Object of considerable Terror. The Intercourse,
which it breaks, is readily reestablished, and the Mystery, which
used to hang over the Fate of those condemned to it, can never
long exist. It is the Situation of the Convicts in the place to
which they shall have been consigned, the strict Discipline, the
unremitting Labour, the severe but wholesome privations to which
they are condemned; It is their sad Estrangement from the sweets
and comforts of a Life, which their Guilt has forfeited, and the
Mercy of His Majesty has spared, and above all the strong feeling
impressed upon this Country that such is the unavoidable Fate of
the unhappy Men, on whom the Sentence has passed, that can alone
make Transportation permanently formidable. If therefore, by ill
considered Compassion for Convicts, or from what might under
other circumstances be considered a laudable desire to lessen
their sufferings, their Situation in New South Wales be divested
of all Salutary Terror, Transportation cannot operate as an
effectual example on the Community at large, and as a proper
punishment for those Crimes against the Commission of which His
Majesty's Subjects have a right to claim protection, nor as an
adequate Commutation for the utmost Rigour of the Law.</p>

[2]</b></p>
<p align="right">Downing Street, 6th January, 1819.   </p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>In the course of the enquiries, which you are authorized under
your Commission to institute in New South Wales, the conduct of
the several persons in authority in that Colony will necessarily
come under your particular Review, and as you are aware, from the
free access which you have had to the correspondence of this
Department, of the Grounds on which the Conduct of many of the
Servants in that Colony has been subjected to accusation, you
will not fail to enquire how far the reports, which have from
different quarters reached His Majesty's Government, are
deserving of Consideration. But although I am to desire that you
do not permit your respect for any Individual, however exalted in
rank or sacred in Character, to check an Investigation of his
Conduct, in cases in which you deem it to be necessary, yet I am
equally to impress upon you the necessity of not divulging in the
Colony the opinion, which you may ultimately form as to the
justice of the original suspicion. The Result of your
Investigation, and the Evidence by which it is to be supported,
is to be communicated to His Majesty's Government alone, and,
although it will be your Duty to furnish them with the most ample
details, it will be no less incumbent upon you to prevent any
disclosure in the Colony, which could only have the Effect of
inflaming existing Resentments and disturbing the Tranquillity of
the Colony, during the Interval which must elapse between your
departure from the Settlements and the final Decision of His
Majesty's Government.</p>
<p>Should however the result of your enquiries, either on this or
any other subject, lead you to entertain an opinion that the
system, which has been pursued in any Department, is either so
bad in itself or so liable to Abuse as to render an immediate
Alteration desireable, you will consider yourself authorized to
express to the Governor in writing the several Improvements and
Alterations, which you deem it your Duty to recommend to his
immediate Adoption, and you will consider the Instruction as
applying to every branch of Administration with the exception of
the Distribution of the Military Force.</p>

<p align="center"><b>EARL BATHURST TO MR. COMMISSIONER BIGGE.
[3]</b></p>
<p align="right">Downing Street, 6th January, 1819.   </p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>I have already had the occasion to point out to you those
Objects of Enquiry on your arrival in New South Wales, which are
connected with the Administration of the Settlements there as fit
Receptacles for Convicts; but although the Prince Regent
considers these to be the most important and therefore the main
Objects of your Investigation, yet His Royal Highness is also
desirous of availing himself of your presence in that Quarter in
order to obtain a Report upon the variety of Topics, which have
more or less Reference to the Advancement of those Settlements as
Colonies of the British Empire. It becomes therefore my Duty to
detail to you the Subjects, upon which it appears requisite that
you should furnish every Information in your power, and in doing
so I deem it necessary to premise that, in any opinion you may be
led to form with respect to any change in the existing Regulation
of the Colony, you must always bear in mind the possibility of an
Abandonment of the present System of Transportation so far as
regards the existing Settlements, and must therefore in
recommending any Measures for adoption carefully distinguish how
far you consider them applicable to the Settlements in their
actual State, or only to that in which they would be placed in
the event of the Convict part of the Population being henceforth
diverted to other Stations.</p>
<p>The Establishment of the Courts of Justice will form the first
subject of such an enquiry. It will be for you to consider
whether the Alterations introduced into the Constitution of the
Courts in 1812 have rendered them adequate to the wants of the
Inhabitants, and to the due Administration of Criminal and Civil
Justice, and, if they still appear to you to be defective, to
suggest the Improvement of which you conceive they are
susceptible. You will also particularly report whether the
Settlements in Van Diemen's Land have advanced so far in
Population and Wealth, as to require a Judicature altogether
separate and distinct from that of the Principal Settlements in
New South Wales. In connection with the Judicial Establishments,
you will not fail to review the Police Regulations of the Colony,
and the manner of their Application to the several Classes of
Inhabitants whether Free Settlers or Convicts; It will form also
a Branch of your Investigation to point out whether, in a
Population so compounded as that of New South Wales, it be
consistent with safety to dispense with any of those more severe
provisions, which have frequently given rise to complaints, and
which cannot but be irksome to the Free Inhabitants of the
Colony.</p>
<p>You will also turn your Attention to the possibility of
diffusing throughout the Colony adequate means of Education and
Religious Instruction, bearing always in mind in your suggestions
that these two Branches ought in all Cases to be inseparably
connected. The Agricultural and Commercial Interests of the
Colony will further require your Attentive Consideration. With
respect to them, you will both report to me their actual State
and the means by which you consider they can be most readily
promoted. It cannot fail to have struck you that many of the
Colonial Regulations are at variance with the general Principles,
by an Adherence to which such Interests are usually advanced.
Among those which in this point of view must have appeared of
very questionable Expediency, I would more particularly refer to
the Authority which the Governor has hitherto exercised of fixing
the Prices of Staple Commodities in the Market, and of selecting
the Individuals who shall be permitted to supply Meat to the
Government Stores. With respect to these Regulations, you will
investigate how far their Repeal is likely to lead to any General
Inconvenience or to any Public Loss. I am aware that when the
Colony was first established the necessity of husbanding the
scanty means of Supply, and regulating its Issue, might justify
an Interference on the part of the Government, but now that the
Quantity of Land in cultivation is so much increased, and the
number of cultivators proportionately enlarged, so as to preclude
on the one hand all fear of want, and on the other a General
Combination of all the Cultivators against the Government, I
confess that I have great reason to doubt the expediency of these
Regulations. At the same time, I feel unwilling to recommend so
material an Alteration without some examination on the spot as to
its probable Effects. It will therefore be for you to report to
me whether the Markets may not be freed either gradually or all
at once from such restriction, whether the Competition of Traders
will not here as elsewhere produce the most beneficial Effects,
and whether the Government Stores may not be supplied (as in
other Colonies) by Public Tender, with equal Advantage both to
the Public and to the Individual Cultivator.</p>
<p>Another Subject of enquiry will be the propriety of permitting
in future a Distillation of Spirits within the Colony. From the
access, which you have had to the Correspondence, you are aware
of the Grounds upon which this measure has been so frequently
recommended by the Local Government, and of those reasons which
have induced His Majesty's Government hitherto to withhold their
Sanction; I need not therefore enter into the details of this
Discussion. The main question, now at issue, is whether a
Distillation of Spirits in the Colony could be so checked and
controlled as to prevent the indiscriminate and unrestrained
Dissemination of Ardent Spirits throughout a Population, too much
inclined already to an immoderate use of them, and too likely to
be excited by the use of them to Acts of Lawless Violence; and to
this your enquiry in this particular will be principally
directed.</p>
<p>It will not be unimportant for you to enquire into and report
upon the actual and Probable Revenues of the Colony, whether they
may be looked to hereafter as affording the means of defraying
some part of the heavy expenditure annually incurred on account
of New South Wales, and whether they are in any and in what cases
susceptible of Increase without prejudice to the Prosperity and
Welfare of the Settlements.</p>
<p>There is one other point also, which I cannot avoid
recommending to your consideration, though I fear there is not
much prospect of your being able to reconcile that difference of
opinion which has prevailed in the Colony. I allude to the
Propriety of admitting into Society Persons, who originally came
to the Settlement as Convicts. The Opinion, entertained by the
Governor and sanctioned by The Prince Regent, has certainly been
with some few exceptions, in favor of their reception at the
expiration of their several Sentences upon terms of perfect
Equality with the Free Settlers. But I am aware that the Conduct
of the Governor in this respect, however approved by the
Government at home, has drawn down upon him the Hostility of many
persons, who hold association with Convicts under any
circumstances to be a degradation. Feelings of this kind are not
easily overcome, but I should be unwilling to forego the
possibility of reconciling the conflicting opinions on this
subject by not adverting to it as a proper question for your
consideration.</p>
<p>I forbear to enter into a variety of other minor points of
detail, which will necessarily fall under the several Heads of
enquiry which I have pointed out to you, because I am confident
that no important point will be left unnoticed in the report
which you may ultimately furnish, and that you will be as anxious
to afford, as His Majesty's Government are to receive, every
Information necessary to form an opinion with respect to the
Police, the Agriculture, the Commerce, the Revenue, or the State
of Society in the Settlements, to which you are about to
proceed.</p>

<p align="center"><i>A special Commissioner.</i></p>
<p>The conclusion of the Napoleonic wars enabled the British
government to pay more attention to the development of the
colonies. The colony had been established under Governor Phillip
purely as a penal settlement. Major Grose and captain Paterson
had carried on the administration from the time of Phillip's
departure to the arrival of Governor Hunter. During this period
certain individuals, chiefly of the military party, commenced to
acquire wealth. Hunter in his government was confronted with a
new problem in the birth of vested interests. The clash of these
interests with the idea of a penal settlement and the
misrepresentations that were made to England caused Hunter's
recall. He was succeeded by Governor King, who met with a similar
fate, to be in turn succeeded by Governor Bligh. By this time,
the party which had caused the unrest had become stronger, and
Bligh's government, therefore, terminated in his deposition.
Governor Macquarie was sent to reorganise the colony. He
attempted to elaborate the idea of a penal settlement. He
discouraged the immigration of free settlers. He adopted his
policy for the encouragement of emancipists; but this policy
assisted in the removal of some of the terrors of transportation.
At the same time, the settlers, who had adopted the colony as
their home, agitated for various reforms, and adverse
representations were made against Macquarie's administration. It
is probable that the colonial office was in a quandary as to the
merits and demerits of the colony as a penal settlement, of the
agitations for reform, and of the principles of Macquarie's
administration, and that for this reason the appointment of a
commissioner of enquiry was made.</p>

<p>John Thomas Bigge was the second son of Thomas Charles Bigge,
of Long Benton, Northumberland, and was born in the year 1780. He
was educated at Newcastle Grammar school, Westminster school, and
Christ Church, Oxford. He graduated B.A. in 1801 and M.A. in
1804, and two years later was admitted a barrister of the Inner
Temple. After some practice at the bar, he was appointed, in
1815, chief justice and judge of the vice-admiralty court at
Trinidad. He had thus acquired some colonial experience before
his appointment to the commission of inquiry into the state of
New South Wales. His report caused much bitterness in the colony,
and he was publicly accused even of causing Macquarie's early
death. Shortly after his return to England from this inquiry, he
was given a similar commission to inquire into the state of Cape
Colony, where he did excellent work in exposing the corruption
amongst the officials employed there. This mission lasted for
several years; during that time his leg was injured by a fall
from a horse, and for two years he was under the treatment of a
quack, who turned out to be a female. He died in the year
1843.</p>

<p align="center"><i>It was an object here of peculiar
Apprehension.</i></p>
<p>In the year 1718 a statute, 4 Geo. I, c. 11, was passed, which
authorised transportation, and established the machinery for
carrying it into effect. It provided that this punishment should
be substituted for branding and whipping, and that, in cases of
death sentences, the King might commute the punishment to
transportation for life or a fixed period to some part of the
American colonies. It was further provided that prisoners so
sentenced should be conveyed, transferred and made over "to the
use of any persons contracting for their transportation, to them
and their assigns," for the term of their sentence. The convicts
thus became the property of the contractors, upon whom no
restrictions were placed as to the manner of dealing with such
property. The contractors, who were usually shipowners, sold the
convicts as virtual slaves to the highest bidder, as soon as they
were landed in the American colonies. The colonial masters of
convicts made them work in the fields together with the black
slaves, and they were equally punished with the lash for idleness
and disobedience. The horrors of such a system naturally created
a dread of transportation.</p>
<p>By an order in council, dated 6th December, 1786, this system
was made applicable to the territory of New South Wales. But the
practice of selling the convicts on arrival at the place of
transportation was never adopted. In its stead, a ship was
chartered, the convicts were assigned to the owners or master,
who at the time of assignation agreed for a nominal sum to
re-transfer the services of the convicts to the governor or
lieutenant-governor at the port of debarkation. Whilst the colony
was in its infancy, and reports were received in England of
hardships endured, of subsisting on reduced rations, and being
clothed in rags, the thought of transportation to Botany bay, as
the settlements were commonly known, was dreaded, and acted as a
deterrent to crime. But when stories of prosperity, and of wealth
rapidly acquired by convicts and ex-convicts, reached England,
the dread rapidly disappeared. The attempt to revive this fear
was the cause of the rigorous systems adopted at Norfolk island,
at Port Arthur and Macquarie harbour, Tasmania, and Port
Macquarie, N.S.W.</p>

<p align="center"><i>My Letter to Lord Sidmouth.</i></p>
<p>The letter to Lord Sidmouth was dated "Downing Street, 23rd
April, 1817," and was as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"My Lord,</p>
<p>"I have for some time past had under consideration the present
State of the Settlements in New South Wales, principally with a
view of satisfying myself whether they are now calculated to
answer the object, for which they were originally established, or
whether it might not be expedient to introduce some alteration in
the existing system.</p>
<p>"Until a recent period the Transportation of Offenders to New
South Wales appears to have answered in a very great degree the
ends, for the Attainment of which it was adopted. The many
instances of persons returning from Transportation and becoming
afterwards useful Members of Society here, and the far more
numerous Cases in which Convicts, after the expiration of their
Sentences, became industrious Settlers in the Colony, are
sufficient to prove the Efficacy of the System in its Infancy, as
far at least as regarded the Improvement and Reform of the
Offenders. So long as the Colony was principally inhabited by
Convicts and but little advanced in Cultivation, the strictness
of the Police Regulations, and the Constant Labour under due
restriction, to which it was then possible to subject the
Convicts, rendered Transportation as a punishment an object of
the greatest Apprehension to those who looked upon strict
Discipline and Regular Labour as the most severe and the least
tolerable of Evils.</p>
<p>"It was not long however before the Settlements were found to
hold out to many Individuals inducements to become cultivators,
and thirty Years' experience of the Climate and Fertility of the
Soil has for some time past rendered a permission to settle in
New South Wales an object of anxious solicitude to all, who were
desirous of leaving their Native Country and had capital to apply
to the Improvement of Land. This System together with the Number
of Convicts, who after the Expiration of their Sentences remain
with their respective Families growing up under them, has so
increased the population of Free Settlers that the prosperity of
the Settlement as a Colony has proportionably advanced, and hopes
may reasonably be entertained of its becoming perhaps at no
distant period a valuable possession of the Crown. It is this
very circumstance which appears to me to render it less fit for
the object of its original Institution. The Settlers feel a
Repugnance to submit to the Enforcement of regulations which,
necessarily partaking much of the Nature of the Rules applicable
to a Penitentiary, interfere materially with the exercise of
those rights which they enjoyed in this Country, and to which as
British Subjects they conceive themselves entitled in every part
of His Majesty's Dominions. The greatest Objection however to the
present system arises from a cause over which Regulations in the
Settlement will not have any immediate Control. During latter
Years, the Number of Convicts annually transported has increased
beyond all Calculation, as will appear by a Reference to the
enclosed Return; and I am apprehensive that Your Lordship will
not be able to hold out any expectation that the Crimes to be
punished by Transportation will diminish in Magnitude or
Frequency, or that the Numbers to be transported will in this or
indeed in succeeding Years be less considerable. This continued
Influx must annually increase the Difficulty, which has long
began to be experienced of enforcing on the Convicts such a
strict Discipline, both as to Labour and Deportment, as is
essentially necessary to make Transportation answer the purpose
either of Punishment or Reform. The Difficulty of finding Regular
Employment for them has been such that it has been the practice
of Late Years to grant Tickets of Leave, almost without
exception, to those who had any prospect of obtaining a
Livelihood by their own exertions, and also to place a greater
proportion as Servants in the Families of Free Settlers. In the
former Case, the Convicts could be subjected to little more than
a nominal Restraint; and, in the latter, it is obvious that with
less regular Labour they must enjoy a freedom inconsistent with
the Object proposed in transporting them. Another Evil resulting
from the increased Number is the great Difficulty of subjecting
any of the Convicts to constant Superintendance either during the
Hours of work or Relaxation; and the necessity of leaving to a
large proportion of them the care of providing themselves with
their own Lodging during the night from the inadequacy of Public
Buildings, allotted to their Reception, forms one of the most
formidable objections to the present system. These Evils, and
more especially the Last, have been recently brought under my
Consideration by various persons, and also by the Governor, who
has coupled his Representations with a Recommendation that
Buildings should be erected for the reception of all the
Convicts; but the heavy expence of such a Work, if it be intended
that the New Buildings should encrease with the encreasing Number
of persons to be lodged in them, has induced me to decline my
sanction to this Recommendation except to a very limited Extent.
I am not however the less sensible of the Evil, nor can I conceal
from myself that Transportation to New South Wales is becoming
neither an object of Apprehension here nor the means of
Reformation in the Settlement itself, and that the Settlement
must be either placed upon a footing that shall render it
possible to enforce, with respect to all the Convicts, strict
Discipline, Regular Labour, and constant Superintendance, or the
System of unlimited Transportation to New South Wales must be
abandoned. I do not feel at present prepared to decide upon the
Alternative, which it may be expedient to recommend; but,
thinking it necessary as a preliminary to such a Decision that
the actual State of the Settlements in New South Wales should be
distinctly ascertained and that Information should without Delay
be procured both as to the Means, by which it is practicable to
remedy the existing Evils, and as to the Charge, which such an
undertaking might bring upon the public, I propose (should it
meet with Your Lordship's Concurrence) to recommend to His Royal
Highness The Prince Regent the appointment of Commissioners, who
shall forthwith proceed to the Settlements, with full power to
investigate all the Complaints which have been made both with
respect to the Treatment of the Convicts and the General
Administration of the Government, and to report to His Royal
Highness The Improvements and Alterations of which the present
System appears to them to be susceptible, and the Charge which
their Adoption may bring upon the Public.</p>

<h3>MAJOR-GENERAL MACQUARIE TO EARL BATHURST.</h3>
<p align="center"><b>(Despatch acknowledged by Earl Bathurst,
10th September, 1822.)</b></p>
<p align="right">London, 27 July, 1822.   </p>
<p>My Lord,</p>
<p>1. Although my proceedings in the administration of the
Government of New South Wales have been, from time to time,
submitted to His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the
Colonies, a Synopsis of their prominent features may yet be
acceptable to your Lordship, as the most convenient review of my
Correspondence with your predecessors; which, as well as the
early part of my Despatches addressed to your Lordship, may, at
this distance of time, be less familiar to you than other and
more weighty affairs constantly pressing on your attention.</p>
<p>2. I found the Colony barely emerging from infantile
imbecility, and suffering from various privations and
disabilities; the Country impenetrable beyond 40 miles from
Sydney; Agriculture in a yet languishing state; commerce in its
early dawn; Revenue unknown; threatened by famine; distracted by
faction; the public buildings in a state of dilapidation and
mouldering to decay; the few Roads and Bridges, formerly
constructed, rendered almost impassable; the population in
general depressed by poverty; no public credit nor private
confidence; the morals of the great mass of the population in the
lowest state of debasement, and religious worship almost totally
neglected.</p>
<p>3. Part of these Evils may perhaps be ascribed to the Mutiny
of the 102d Regiment, the arrest of Governor Bligh, and the
distress occasioned to the Settlers by the then recent floods of
the Hawkesbury and Nepean Rivers, from whose banks chiefly the
Colony was at that time supplied with Wheat.</p>
<p>4. Such was the state of New South Wales, when I took charge
of its administration on the 1st of Jany., 1810. I left it, in
February last, reaping incalculable advantages from my extensive
and important discoveries in all directions, including the
supposed insurmountable barrier called the Blue Mountains, to the
westward of which are situated the fertile plains of Bathurst,
and, in all respects, enjoying a state of private comfort and
public prosperity, which I trust will at least equal the
expectation of His Majesty's Government. This change may indeed
be ascribed in part to the natural operation of time and events
on individual enterprize. How far it may be attributed to
measures originating with myself, as hereinafter detailed, and my
zeal and judgment in giving effect to my instructions, I humbly
submit to His Majesty and his Ministers.</p>
<p>5. One of my first acts was to relieve the Colony from the
horrors of impending famine, the quantity of Wheat then in Store
being less than a hundred Bushels. Its immediate wants were
promptly supplied by my authorizing the purchase of a Cargo of
Wheat from Bengal, which providentially arrived at that time; and
foreseeing a scarcity in the ensuing year, I did not hesitate to
contract for another Cargo at 8s. p. Bushell, being 2s. a Bushell
under the price at which Wheat was turned into Store by the
settlers.</p>
<p>6. To avert the recurrence of similar effects from similar
causes, I ordered large tracts of land on high grounds, and out
of the reach of floods, to be forthwith cultivated with Wheat and
Maize Crops. As an encouragement to the Settlers in the
furtherance of this plan, I issued Cattle to them on Credit from
the Government Herds; and as a further inducement to those
Settlers living on the Banks of the Hawkesbury and Nepean Rivers,
I established several townships in convenient situations and near
the Banks of those Rivers, to which those, whose farms were
subject to floods, might occasionally retire with their cattle
and grain, and where they might build their Dwelling-houses and
Barns, etc., in safety. Few of the small Settlers being at this
time possessed of any Horned Cattle, I considered it good policy
to diffuse that species of Stock as much as possible amongst
them, not only for their own comfort, but also with the view of
creating a competition with the Richer Settlers and large Stock
Holders, who at that period had the exclusive advantage of
supplying the King's Stores with Animal food, the price of which
was then Nine Pence per pound.</p>
<p>7. My next object of attention was the general amelioration of
the Colony and the improvement and reformation of the manners and
morals of the Inhabitants. To reward merit, encourage virtue, and
punish vice, wherever I found them, without regard to rank, class
or description of persons, be they free people or convicts,
appeared to me unerring principles in prosecuting this desirable
end.</p>
<p>8. Finding, on my arrival, many persons free, who had come out
originally as Convicts, and sustaining unblemished characters
since their emancipation, but treated with rudeness, contumely,
and even oppressed, as far as circumstances permitted, by those
who had come out free and viewed with illiberal jealousy the
honest endeavours of the others to attain and support a
respectable station in Society, I determined to counteract this
envious disposition in one Class, by admitting, in my demeanour
and occasional marks of favour to both, no distinction where
their merits, pretensions, and capacities were equal. I
considered this as the first step towards a general reformation
of the manners and habits of the motley part of the population of
New South Wales, as it then existed; and I am happy to add that
twelve years experience of its effects has fully justified my
most sanguine anticipations.</p>
<p>9. With this view I also used every means, both by precept and
example as far as my influence extended, to inspire a religious
feeling amongst all Classes of the Community; to excite
sentiments of morality; and to inculcate habits of temperance and
industry. I recommended, in the most impressive manner, a
diligent attendance at Divine Worship on Sundays, and that
Marriage should take place of and supersede the disgraceful and
immoral state of Concubinage, which I found generally prevailing
on my arrival in the Colony. These injunctions, I am happy to
say, were very generally attended to, Marriage as well as a more
regular attendance on Divine Worship having soon become
conspicuously prevalent.</p>
<p>10. For the benefit of the rising generation and the youth of
the Colony, I established additional Schools at Sydney, and in
all the principal Districts in the interior of the Colony.</p>
<p>11. The decayed and dilapidated state of all the public
Buildings, both at Sydney and the subordinate Settlements, and
the State of the public roads and Bridges throughout the Colony
also claimed my early attention; but the resources then under my
controul were very inadequate to repairs and improvements of that
nature. My plans were circumscribed and my progress retarded
accordingly.</p>
<p>12. At that time, there were no Colonial Funds to defray the
expense of constructing such works, and there were then very few
Convict Artificers or Labourers in the Colony. I was therefore
under the necessity of getting some of these works by contracting
with private individuals. The first public roads and Bridges,
constructed in the Colony, and also the Colonial General Hospital
and a few other public Buildings, were of this description. But,
since the existence of a Colonial Revenue, and after so great an
increase of Convict Artificers and Labourers as has taken place
within the last seven years, all the public Buildings in the
Colony (with very few exceptions) have been erected by the
Government Artificers and Labourers, as have also all the roads
and Bridges.</p>
<p>13. To enumerate or particularize the several public Buildings
erected, and various other improvements made throughout the
Territory and its dependent Settlements, in this Report, would
occupy too large a portion of your Lordship's valuable time. I
therefore herewith do myself the honor to transmit to your
Lordship, in the form of an Appendix, a detailed List or Schedule
of all the Public Buildings erected and improvements made during
the period of my administration of the Colony, to which Document
I respectfully beg leave to call your Lordship's particular
attention, as from the perusal of it, your Lordship will be the
better able to appreciate the value and importance of these
Works, as well as of the labor bestowed upon them. I also do
myself the honor to transmit to your Lordship herewith, in
further elucidation of the Works in question, a <i>Port Folio</i>
containing the plans of the principal public Buildings erected in
the Colony during my administration, exclusive of those at
subordinate Settlements.</p>
<p>14. I have much satisfaction in having it in my power to state
to your Lordship that the progressive improvement and internal
resources of the Colony, in the great increase of the Flocks and
Herds, and in the quantity of ground cleared and brought into
Tillage, keep pace with the great increase of population, as your
Lordship will see by the following comparative Statement,
namely,&mdash;</p>

<p>15. Trade and Manufactures have not increased in the same
ratio as Agriculture and Grazing; but a very considerable Trade
has been carried on for some years past, both at port Jackson and
at the Derwent in Van Dieman's Land; and some useful branches of
Manufactures have been established at Sydney, namely Woolen-Cloth
and Linen, Hats, Boots, and Shoes, Tanning of Leather, Stockings,
and Common Pottery. But now that Vessels of small Burthen are
permitted to trade direct between England and New South Wales,
and that Distillation of Spirits is to be allowed in the Colony,
both Trade and Manufactures will increase rapidly; and this
Colony will, at no very distant period, vie in trade and opulence
with many others in His Majesty's Dominions.</p>
<p>16. On my taking the Command of the Colony in the Year 1810,
the amount of Port Duties did not exceed Eight thousand pounds p.
annum, and there were only Fifty or Sixty pounds of Balance in
the Treasurer's hands. But now Duties are collected at Port
Jackson to the amount of from Twenty eight to <i>Thirty thousand
pounds per Annum</i>. In addition to this Annual Colonial
Revenue, there are Port Duties collected at Hobart-Town and
George Town in Van Dieman's Land, to the amount of between Eight
and Ten thousand pounds per annum.</p>
<p>17. The credit of the Colony was also very low, when I
arrived, on account of the base paper Currency, which was then
the only circulating Medium, the lowest and most profligate
persons issuing their Notes of Hand in payment of Goods
purchased, without having the means of redeeming them when due.
This terrified Traders, and prevented them from having any
regular intercourse with Port Jackson: the practice became a very
serious evil, and many persons were ruined by it. A temporary
relief was however afforded by the circulation of Ten thousand
pounds in Dollars, which His Majesty's Government sent out for
the use of the Colony.</p>
<p>18. But the evil was only partially cured by that means. I
therefore, after mature deliberation and consultation with the
best informed persons in the Colony, determined on forming and
establishing a Colonial Bank in the year 1817, granting a Charter
under certain limitations and restrictions. In framing the
charter and the necessary regulations, I was most ably assisted
by Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde, and my Secretary, Mr. John Thomas
Campbell; to both of whom I feel greatly indebted for the trouble
they took on that occasion. This measure has been productive of
the most important and beneficial consequences to the Colony at
large, which was thus rescued from the state of Bankruptcy into
which it was declining fast; its credit raised at Foreign ports;
and an incalculable accommodation rendered to every Individual in
the Country. In short, I consider the Establishment of this Bank
to be the saving of the Colony from Ruin, and consequently the
greatest benefit that could be conferred upon it at the time the
measure was adopted.</p>
<p>19. With the view of simplifying and rendering more practical,
the several Colonial Orders and Regulations framed and issued by
my predecessors in Office, Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde, at my
request, collated and formed a <i>Digest</i> <a href="#note-005"
name="noteref-005" id="noteref-005">{149}</a> of them, some
little time previously to my being relieved, omitting all those,
which had become obsolete or which had been repealed by
subsequent regulations. This I consider a very important work,
and I feel particularly obliged to Mr. Wylde for the trouble he
took in framing and digesting it in so clear a manner. By these
Colonial regulations (most of which have been framed by myself),
I have been guided principally in my administration, and I trust
with no inconsiderable benefit to the Colony. Herewith I do
myself the honor of transmitting, for your Lordship's perusal and
information, the Book containing the Digest of the Colonial
regulations and Orders herein adverted to, submitting it to your
Lordship's superior judgment to confirm them in whole or in part,
as may appear most adviseable for the good of the Colony.</p>
<p>20. Considering the poor Black Natives or Aborigines of the
Colony entitled to the peculiar protection of the British
Government, on account of their being driven from the Sea Coast
by our settling thereon, and subsequently occupying their best
Hunting Grounds in the Interior, I deemed it an act of justice,
as well as of Humanity, to make at least an attempt to ameliorate
their condition and to endeavour to civilize them in as far as
their wandering habits would admit of.</p>
<p>21. With this view, I called a general meeting or Congress of
the Natives inhabiting the Country lying between the Blue
Mountains and Port Jackson. This Meeting took place accordingly
at the Town of Parramatta on the 28th of December, 1814, when
several propositions were made to the Natives in respect to their
discontinuing their present wandering predatory habits and
becoming <i>regular Settlers</i>.</p>
<p>22. It was also proposed to them to send their Children to
School, at a Seminary I intended to establish immediately for
that express purpose.</p>
<p>23. Many of the Natives agreed to take Lands and settle
permanently on them, and they all seemed highly pleased with the
idea of sending their children to school. It was therefore
determined to establish and open the Native Institution for
Educating and Civilizing the Children of the Aborigines on the
18th of the ensuing Month of January, when several of the Natives
promised to bring in their children, which they did; and the
Institution <a href="#note-006" name="noteref-006" id=
"noteref-006">{150}</a> was accordingly established on the day
above mentioned under the superintendence of Mr. William Shelly,
a pious, sober and steady good man, who had come out originally
as one of the Church Missionary Society.</p>
<p>24. This Institution has fully answered the purpose for which
it was established, it having proved that the children of the
Natives have as good and ready an aptitude for learning as those
of Europeans, and that they are also susceptible of being
completely civilized.</p>
<p>25. I limited the number of children to be received into the
Institution to Twenty four, as the expense of maintaining a
greater number at one time would be very considerable, one half
of whom to be male, and the other female. The progress, these
Black Children have made in their Education, has been a subject
of astonishment to every one, who has ever visited the
Institution. It has also had the good effect of completely
conciliating the good will and friendship of all the native
tribes to the British Government, and of securing the most
friendly and social intercourse with them. Three Girls, educated
at the Native Institution, have already been married from thence
to Native Youths, who have become <i>Settlers</i>.</p>
<p>26. The Adults, however, are naturally very indolent and
averse to labor, and I had consequently great difficulty in
prevailing on any of them to become <i>regular Settlers</i>. But
determined to persevere in my endeavours to civilize these poor
inoffensive Human Beings, I at length prevailed on <i>Five
different Tribes</i> to become Settlers, giving them their choice
of situations. Three of the Tribes chose to settle on the Shores
of Port Jackson in the vicinity of Sydney, on account of the
conveniency of fishing, for which purpose I furnished them with
Boats and Fishing Tackle. The other two Tribes preferred taking
their Farms in the Interior, from the produce of which they now
maintain themselves, and appear much pleased with their change of
condition; and their good example I hope will in due time
reconcile many of the other adult Native Blacks to become
Settlers. I appointed the 28th of December of each year for a
general Meeting or Congress of all the Natives, which they have
regularly attended, upwards of 300 having been present at the
last Annual Congress at Parramatta. Annual congress of
natives.</p>
<p>27. Having often viewed and considered with regret and
compassion the wretched and neglected state of a great number of
helpless illegitimate Orphan Children, consigned to want and
misery by their unnatural and unfeeling Parents, and the
consequent necessity of victualling numbers of that description
from the King's Stores, I was induced to form and establish an
Asylum for their relief, maintenance and education, to be
supported from the Colonial Revenue in the same manner as the
Female Orphan and Native Institutions are.</p>
<p>28. I accordingly established a Male Orphan Institution at
Sydney on the 1st of January, 1819, under certain Rules,
Regulations and Restrictions limiting the Orphans at first to be
received into the Institution to <i>Sixty Boys</i>; but which it
was afterwards found expedient to increase <i>to Eighty</i>, of
which number it at present consists. Mr. Bowden, who came out
free from England as a Schoolmaster, was considered a fit person
to take the charge of this Institution, and he was accordingly
appointed Master of it. The Female Orphans having been removed
from the Town of Sydney to <i>the New Building erected for their
residence and accomodation at Parramatta on the 30th of June,
1818</i>, the House <a href="#note-007" name="noteref-007" id=
"noteref-007">{151}</a> formerly occupied by them at Sydney was
allotted for the Male Orphan Institution, the House and Offices
being repaired, improved and perfectly fitted up for that
purpose.</p>
<p>29. The Establishment of this Institution, altho' it adds
somewhat to the Expences of the Colony, I reckoned then and do
now a measure of primary importance, and, as connected with the
Female Orphan Institution, is likely to prove of incalculable
benefit to the moral and Religious habits of the Rising
Generation, to whom the Colony of New South Wales must chiefly
look forward for the formation of a moral and respectable
Society.</p>
<p>30. The Children, who have already been admitted into this
Institution, have made a rapid progress in their Education. They
are taught Reading, Writing and Arithmetic, and are also
instructed, even before they quit the Institution, in some of the
most simple and useful Trades suitable to their years, such as
Tailoring and Shoe-making; and as specimens of their proficiency
in those two Trades, I take the liberty of sending for your
Lordship's inspection a Box containing some articles of Dress and
Shoes made by the Boys belonging to the Institution, none of whom
exceed thirteen years of age.</p>
<p>31. Besides this Male Orphan Institution, there is a large
Public Charity School at Sydney, which I established immediately
after my arrival in the Colony for the benefit of poor Children,
whose Parents did not possess the means of educating them; but
the Government are at no Expence in feeding or clothing these
Children, they being only what are called Day-Scholars.</p>
<p>32. The great number of Paupers, aged, infirm, and old Men and
Women, many of whom are both lame and blind and without any
permanent provision, unavoidably entailed on Government a very
heavy expence in victualling the greater part of them from the
King's Store; but, being houseless as well as pennyless, they
still went about begging and often sleeping out at nights in the
open air. I was therefore induced to have a comfortable House and
Offices erected at the expence of Government, as an Asylum for
those unfortunate persons, the Government now only victualling
from the Store such as came out originally as Convicts.</p>
<p>33. The system, I have invariably pursued in respect to the
treatment, management and appropriation of Convicts, your
Lordship I believe is already well acquainted with. But I may add
here that I have always endeavoured in my treatment of them to
temper Justice with Humanity, without any positive remission of
the punishment awarded to them by the offended laws of their
Country.</p>
<p>34. On their arrival, they were distributed amongst such
Settlers as required them, without favor or partiality, the
Government only retaining such useful Mechanics and proportion of
Labourers, as were required for carrying on the Public Works. But
the influx of Male Convicts for the last Five years has been so
great and so very far exceeding that of former years that the
Settlers had not employment for above an eighth of the number,
that annually arrived in the Colony, the remaining seven eighths
being left to be maintained and employed by Government. Hence it
became necessary to employ this large surplus of Men in some
useful manner, so that their labour might in some degree cover
the expence of their feeding and clothing.</p>
<p>35. I accordingly employed numerous Gangs of them in all parts
of the Colony in repairing the old public Roads and Bridges, and
in constructing new ones. I also established a Government
Agricultural Farm on "Emu Plains", one of the richest and most
fertile tracts of Land in the whole Colony, appointing Mr.
Richard Fitzgerald to be Superintendant and Inspector of
Government Agriculture, for which situation he is eminently
qualified, being a most honest upright good man and perfectly
well acquainted with all the branches of Agriculture, having been
employed several years in the same situation by my Predecessors,
Governors Phillip, Hunter and King, all of whom were highly
pleased with his conduct.</p>
<p>36. To this Establishment were sent those Convicts, who were
not required for the Settlers, for the Public Roads and Bridges
or other Government purposes. They are there most usefully
employed in productive Labour, which, from the most correct
calculation, more than repays to Government <a href="#note-008"
name="noteref-008" id="noteref-008">{93}</a> the amount of their
maintenance and all the other expences of the Establishment,
there being 300 Convicts employed there on the 30th of November
last.</p>
<p>37. This tract of Land is so extremely fertile, and so
peculiarly well situated for a Government Agriculture
Establishment, and so useful as a Nursery for instructing the
younger description of Convicts in the art of Husbandry, as well
as so valuable in many other points of view to Government, that I
cannot resist the desire of most respectfully recommending to
your Lordship never to permit this fine tract of Land to be
alienated from the Crown and to instruct the present and all
future Governors accordingly. 38. In respect to the Expences of
the Colony, I am sincerely sorry to say I cannot report that they
are on the decrease; on the contrary I fear they will continue to
increase, as long as such large bodies of Convicts are sent out
thither annually; for your Lordship must be fully aware that the
principal part of the present expence of the Colony is incurred
in feeding, clothing and lodging the Male and Female Convicts. At
the same time, it must not be forgotten that a very considerable
expence is incurred in the support of the Civil, Military and
Marine Establishments, and also in victualling, for a certain
period, Free Settlers, their Families and Convict Labourers. It
has ever been my most anxious wish to reduce the expences, as
much as possible, by every means in my power, and have often
incurred the ill will of the great Graziers and Holders of Stock
by my anxiety on this head.</p>
<p>39. In 1810, on my taking charge of the Government, I found
the price of Meat, delivered and supplied for the use of the
King's Store, at nine pence Sterling per pound. In a few years
afterwards, I reduced it to eight pence, then to seven pence,
then to six pence, and finally <i>to five pence p. pound</i>,
which was the price paid by the Government when I delivered over
charge of it to Sir Thomas Brisbane. The Graziers can afford to
supply the King's Store at this last price very well, and with a
handsome profit; it is true they <i>generally</i> complain it is
too low a price; but such of them, as are candid, allow it to be
a liberal one. A reduction of <i>one penny</i> in the pound of
meat, effected without injury to the Grazier, is a great object
to the Government in victualling such a number of people.</p>
<p>40. For instance, at the time of my being relieved, there were
upwards of 6,000 full Rations issued from the different King's
Stores in the Colony, and a great number of those, so victualled,
receive a full Ration and a half, in consideration of their being
kept at work the whole of the day; but supposing that only Six
thousand pounds of animal food are issued daily from the King's
Stores in the Colony, the saving to Government at one Penny per
Pound would be annually no less a sum than Nine thousand one
hundred and twenty five pounds, Stg.; so that had I continued the
price of Animal Food at Nine pence per pound, as I found it, the
expences of the Colony at the present moment would be at least
Thirty six thousand and five hundred (&pound;36,500) pounds
Sterling more than it is.</p>
<p>41. Exclusively of this great reduction in the price of Animal
Food, large quantities of Beef from the Government Tame Herds
have annually been supplied for the King's Stores to lessen the
expences. I adopted this also as a resource for counteracting the
great Stock-holders, when they appeared disposed to hold back
their supplies with the view of forcing the Government to raise
the price.</p>
<p>42. Thus the Tame Herds of Cattle, belonging to the Crown, are
a great and powerful check to the Graziers by preventing
monopolies and combinations to raise the price; since the King's
Stores can thus on any emergency be supplied from the Government
Herds for five or six weeks without materially decreasing the
female or breeding stock.</p>
<p>43. When I took the command of the Colony in January, 1810,
the Government Tame Herds and Flocks consisted only 3,483 head of
Horned Cattle, and 693 Head of Sheep; but notwithstanding the
numerous and heavy Draughts made from them during my
Administration to Settlers and other persons on credit, and also
the great number supplied to the King's Stores at the different
Settlements, there remained on the 1st of December last, at the
period of my resignation, no less than 5,049 Head of Horned
Cattle and 2,098 Head of Sheep.</p>
<p>44. In this number are included 872 Head reclaimed from the
Wild Herds between the 1st of December, 1819 (when that operation
commenced) and the 1st of December, 1821, which were accordingly
incorporated with the Tame Herds.</p>
<p>45. These reclaimed 872 Head of Wild Cattle, supposing them
only to weigh 400 pounds each (which is considerably under their
average weight) at the rate of 5d. per pound will give
&pound;7,266 13s. 4d., which is also a saving to Government,
deducting the trifling expence of reclaiming them, as all these
reclaimed Cattle are fit to be turned into Store when necessary.
In addition to the 872 Head of Wild Cattle, incorporated with the
Tame Herds, 178 Wild Bulls were shot for the sake of their Hides,
which were useful in the Stores and Work Shops.</p>
<p>46. In order further to reduce the expences of the Colony, I
attempted at one plentiful season to reduce the price of Wheat to
eight shillings per Bushel, but, on consultation with the most
experienced Farmers in the Colony and my own subsequent
observation, I was perfectly satisfied that the grower of Grain
would be a loser at that price; and, the Magistrates having
furnished me with their opinions to the same effect, I allowed
the former price of ten shillings a bushel to be continued and
paid afterwards.</p>
<p>47. I hope these endeavours on my part to reduce the public
expences will prove to your Lordship that I was not unmindful of
my duty on that important point. Had I remained longer in the
administration of the Colony, I had it in contemplation to submit
for your Lordship's consideration and approval the adoption of
some measures that would certainly, if carried into effect,
considerably reduce the present enormous expences. And should
your Lordship signify to me your pleasure to that effect, I shall
still be most happy to submit these measures verbally or in
writing as your Lordship may prefer.</p>
<p>48. It may not be irrelevant, while on the subject of the
expences of the Colony, to mention that <i>one Eighth</i> part of
the Colonial Revenue, by my regulations, is paid quarterly into
the hands of the treasurer of the male and female Orphan
Institutions, for the support of those two Establishments and for
the support of the several Charity Schools; but now it is my
opinion that <i>one sixteenth</i> part of the Colonial revenue
will be quite sufficient for those purposes in future.</p>
<p>49. I have thus briefly touched upon the principal measures of
my Administration, which according to my judgment were the best
calculated to ensure the general improvement of the Colony and
the prosperity and happiness of its inhabitants; how far they
have succeeded in the attainment of these important objects may
be judged by a comparison of what the Colony is now and what it
was twelve years ago.</p>
<p>50. That the Colony has under my orders and regulations
greatly improved in agriculture, trade, increase of Flocks and
Herds and wealth of every kind; that the People build better
Dwelling houses, and live more comfortably; that they are in a
very considerable degree reformed in their moral and religious
habits; that they are now less prone to Drunkenness, and more
industrious; and that crimes have decreased, making due allowance
for the late increase of Convict population; every <i>candid,
liberal minded</i> man, at all acquainted with the history of the
Colony for the last twelve years, will readily attest.</p>
<p>51. Turbulent Individuals, generally stumbling on the very
threshold of the law, impatient of all restraint, and ever ready
to asperse the most temperate administration of the most
wholesome regulations, are found in the best ordered communities;
unfortunately New South Wales had its share of them, and I am
aware that my Administration has been represented by them as
oppressive, and the people discontented.</p>
<p>52. Even my work of Charity, and, as it appeared to me, sound
Policy in endeavoring to restore emancipated and reformed
Convicts to a level with their fellow subjects, a work which,
considered in either a religious or a political point of view, I
shall ever value as the most meritorious part of my
administration, has not escaped their animadversion.</p>
<p>53. They have further, as I understand, had the audacity to
insinuate that I increased my fortune by improper means, while in
the Administration of New South Wales. This I assert, <i>on my
honor</i>, to be a falsehood, which, prepared as I was for their
hostility, I little expected the most depraved and malignant of
my enemies would have hazarded. The only change, that has taken
place in my small fortune since I embarked for New South Wales in
1809, has been from accumulation by its interest during my
absence and by my having in an evil hour authorized my Agents in
this Country to convert my money into land.</p>
<p>54. The persons therefore and the malice of my Detractors are
alike beneath my contempt; nor are the invectives, which on their
authority have been so unsparingly, wantonly and unjustly heaped
on my name and character in a public place, where more temper and
discrimination might have been expected, entitled to more
respect.</p>
<p>55. How far they have been merited, or to what extent my
measures may have justly incurred the censure of any class of the
Colonists or of their abettors at home, your Lordship has
hitherto only been able to judge from my official dispatches;
these have necessarily been deficient in minor points of
contingent detail, which, although individually unimportant, were
in the aggregate essentially conducive and highly interesting to
the comfort and happiness of the people; and that the whole tenor
of my conduct, both public and private, was very generally
approved, I hope will appear by an address presented to me by the
inhabitants of New South Wales, after I had resigned the
Government, and when they were no longer awed by my authority,
and another from the inhabitants of Van Diemen's Land on my last
Tour of inspection there, which I have the honor of transmitting
herewith for your Lordship's perusal.</p>
<p>56. I take the liberty of respectfully requesting that your
Lordship will do me the honor to submit this report to His
Majesty for his gracious consideration; and, in conclusion, I
have to express my anxious and fervent hope that my long,
faithful and arduous services will receive the approbation of my
Gracious Sovereign, which, if accorded, will be to me the most
gratifying and highest reward that can be bestowed upon them.</p>

MAJOR-GENERAL MACQUARIE.</small></b></p>
<p><small>WE</small>, the Magistrates, Clergy, Public Officers,
Merchants, Landholders and Free Inhabitants of the Colony of New
South Wales, beg to approach Your Excellency with the farewell
expression of our Respect and Regard on your Retirement from a
Government, which you have so long, so ably and so honorably
administered.</p>
<p>Your Excellency's incessant exertions for the Welfare and
Improvement of these Settlements, strongly exemplified by the
rapidly increasing and growing consequence of the Colony and its
Dependencies, which Our Sovereign was graciously pleased to
confide to your care and Government, have fully evinced the
Judgment of His Majesty's Selection, and Command our Gratitude
and Affection.</p>
<p>We cannot refrain from expressing our esteem for the mildness,
the equity and the wisdom of Your Excellency's measures,
generally, for the comfort and happiness of all the Inhabitants
of these Colonies during your long administration of the
Government; and we desire, Sir, to assure you of our due
appreciation of the value and salutary effects of those measures,
while we contemplate the advancement of Religion, of Benevolent
Institutions, of social Order, and of expanding Happiness, which
are everywhere visible throughout these Colonies, and which will
perpetuate Your Excellency's Merits in the Memory and in the
grateful affections of ourselves and our posterity.</p>
<p>That the merit of Your Excellency's long and faithful services
will meet the just Reward of Our Sovereign's Approbation, we
cannot but anticipate from His Majesty's Justice and Munificence;
that the recollection of them will remain indelible on our minds,
and ensure our lasting affections, we can more confidently
pronounce.</p>
<p>Accept, Sir, our earnest wishes that Your Excellency and
Family may be favored with a safe and speedy passage to your
Native Country, and that you may long enjoy the meed of an active
life, in an evening of peace, security and dignified retirement,
of public esteem and domestic happiness.</p>

<p><small>N.B.</small>&mdash;It was resolved at the Meeting of
the Inhabitants, which took place on this occasion, That a Piece
of Plate of the value of Five hundred pounds should be presented
to Governor Macquarie.</p>
<p>True Copy:&mdash;<small>L. MACQUARIE</small><br>
<br></p>
<p align="center"><b><small>ANSWER</small></b></p>
<p>Sir and Gentlemen,</p>
<p>It cannot fail at any time to be matter of much gratification
to receive the complimentary Address of so numerous and
respectable a Body of British Subjects, as that by which you are
now delegated; but that gratification is enhanced, far beyond the
ordinary standard on the present occasion, by the consideration
that it is made and presented at a time, when all those Political
Relations between me and you, as the Governor and Governed, which
might be supposed to have had a certain influence on your
deliberations, are now at an end.</p>
<p>Viewing the Address I have just received in this light, I am
proud in considering it as a pure emanation of the Heart; and let
me assure you that it makes its way accordingly to mine, and
shall be cherished there so long as Memory holds her Seat. It is
not compatible with the frail nature of Man that any Mortal
should attain perfection; and it is on this ground that the
comforts of the Gospel, the mild dispensations of the Christian
Religion, have been set forth as our great exemplar and guide
through life.</p>
<p>In these Holy Comforts and Divine Dispensations, I shall
repose in Christian Charity towards my frail Fellow Creatures,
conscious of the rectitude of my own purposes, and shall reflect
with serenity on the motives, which actuated that line of conduct
I have undeviatingly pursued during my Administration of this
Government, not a little flattered in having this testimonial
that my efforts have been crowned with so much success in the
increased and rapidly increasing prosperity of this Colony and
its Dependencies.</p>
<p>Please, Sir and Gentlemen, to accept towards yourselves my
acknowledgments for your personal kindness and attention to me on
this occasion, and to convey to your Fellow Citizens my most
sincere and heartfelt acknowledgments for this last tribute of
their affectionate and respectful regard; and allow me thus to
convey to the Colonists at large the assurance that it shall be
the study and pride of my future days (so far as circumstances
will admit) to suggest to His Majesty's Government, and to all
those in authority or possessing influence, the adoption of such
further measures for the future welfare and happiness of this
Colony and its Dependencies, as in my judgment will be most
likely to extend their Commerce and Political Rights, and confirm
their internal harmony and good will, one towards another. In
making such representations, I shall be only persevering in those
Political feelings and opinions, whereby I have been uniformly
actuated during the period of my Government and Residence among
you.</p>
<p>In taking my final leave of you as Colonists, I wish to remind
you that your Constitution is so composed as to require in its
direction measures calculated to produce at least forbearance to
each other from the separate Classes which form this Community. I
therefore most earnestly recommend to you individually to
promote, as far as possible, harmony in all your transactions,
with a determined resolution to submit yourselves to the guidance
and protection of your Governor, who feels alike disposed to see
Justice done to every Man, and who I trust will find in you that
ready support to his measures, to which I am very sure his
Efforts for your benefit will give him every just claim,
independent of the Authority with which His Majesty has invested
him.</p>

<p align="center"><b><small>ADDRESS FROM THE INHABITANTS OF THE
DISTRICTS OF THE HAWKESBURY.</small></b></p>
<p>To his Excellency Major General Macquarie, etc., etc.,
etc.</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>Twelve years having nearly elapsed since you took charge of
the Government of this Colony, at the close of this period
calling to our grateful recollection the many advantages we have
enjoyed under your wise and mild administration, We feel
ourselves bound by the ties of gratitude to offer you this
address as a grateful memorial and tribute of our undissembled
regard.</p>
<p>When we take a retrospective view of the Colony on your
arrival, and compare it with its present improved state, we
cannot but admire your wisdom and indefatigable perseverance, not
only in the convenience and comfort derived from the construction
of Roads, public Buildings, the erection of Schools, the
patronage afforded to benevolent and charitable institutions, but
for the great zeal manifested in correcting vice and encouraging
virtue, your own conduct having exhibited a pattern worthy of
imitation.</p>
<p>With every sentiment of regard, we now take our farewell of
your Excellency, trusting that your Excellency's Conduct will
receive the approbation of our most Gracious Sovereign, and
conscious that in retirement you will experience the happiness
resulting from a life spent in honorable pursuits.</p>
<p><small>N.B.</small>&mdash;It was resolved at the meeting of
the Inhabitants of the Districts of the Hawkesbury, which took
place on this occasion to request of Governor Macquarie to sit
for a half length Portrait in England <a href="#note-011" name=

Court House at Windsor to defray the expense of which Seventy

<p>Gentlemen,</p>
<p>I receive your Address with sentiments of gratification and
thankfulness.</p>
<p>I feel a degree of satisfaction, not to be expressed at the
termination of my command in this Colony, from the recollection
that the period it has embraced has not been marked by any great
calamity, and that under the divine protection we have been
advancing towards a degree of civilization and comfort, which can
only render life one of enjoyment to those who have been
accustomed from early habits to the manifold blessings extending
to the whole population in the Mother Country.</p>
<p>That my exertions have not escaped your observation, and that
they have been so directed as to meet your wishes and obtain your
approbation, is not only highly pleasing to me, but I hope not
altogether unworthy of commendation on your part.</p>
<p>The resolution passed at your late Meeting of requesting me to
sit for a Half length portrait is highly gratifying to my
feelings, and is too flattering a mark of the personal regard of
the Inhabitants of the Districts of the Hawkesbury to be
rejected. I therefore with sincere pleasure and pride acquiesce
in your request by agreeing to sit for my Portrait on my arrival
in England, and I shall ever bear in mind a lively recollection
of the honor thus conferred upon me.</p>

<p align="center"><i>A strong massy stone Pier.</i></p>
<p>When the Hunter river was first discovered, at the entrance to
the estuary there lay an island which was named Nobby's or Coal
island. It was separated from the south head by a channel, which
carried seven feet of water at low tide. This island was
ninety-two feet in height above high-water mark. Captain Wallis
proposed that it should be connected with the mainland by a
breakwater, thirty-feet broad, for the double purpose of
protecting the shipping in harbour and of increasing the scour in
the main channel to the north of the island. Governor Macquarie
gave his consent to the proposal, and on the 5th of August, 1818,
accompanied by captain Wallis, Reverend William Cowper, major
Antill, lieutenant Macquarie, ensign Roberts, and James Meehan,
he laid the foundation-stone and called the proposed structure
Macquarie pier. Progress on the undertaking was slow, and three
years later only half the gap was bridged from the mainland; but
at that time the channel had already been improved by the scour,
and the shipping felt the benefit of the additional shelter.</p>

<p align="center"><i>After the first Year will more than
reimburse Government.</i></p>
<p>In the seventh paragraph of his despatch dated 18th October,
1811 (see page 380, volume VII), Governor Macquarie reported that
he had totally abolished the government agricultural
establishment, as it had been proved to be very expensive to
government. Throughout the major part of his administration, he
held the opinion that the purchase of grain from the settlers was
the most economical method of supplying the commissariat. In his
despatch dated 28th February, 1820, he reported (see page 279)
that "there is No great Economy in the Measure of Cultivating
Lands on Account of the Crown." This policy was adversely
criticised by J. T. Bigge, and it is probable that the change in
Macquarie's opinions, as shown in the quotations at the head of
this note, was due to Bigge's influence.</p>

<p align="center"><i>A Digest of them.</i></p>
<p>It is probable that this book, containing a digest of the
government and general orders, was in manuscript, and that it
never came into general use by the magistrates. In a judgment by
Barron Field in a case, Marsden, clerk, <i>v</i>. Lawson and
Douglass (see enclosure to despatch of Sir Thomas Brisbane, dated
10th August, 1825), the question of general orders was discussed.
It was stated then that only two copies of the orders published
by Governor King (see note 185, volume III) were extant in the
colony, and that it was "a pity that the Colonial Laws have not
long ere this been revised and digested by skilful authority."
Reference was made to the abridgment of orders, which were
published in the almanacs for 1813 and 1814, but no mention was
made of a digest by judge-advocate Wylde, and it is probable
therefore that it was not in use in the colony.</p>
