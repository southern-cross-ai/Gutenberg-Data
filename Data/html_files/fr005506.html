<p>Lady Susan Vernon to Mr. Vernon.</p>
<p>Langford, December.</p>
<p>My dear Brother</p>
<p>I can no longer refuse myself the pleasure of profiting by your
kind invitation, when we last parted, of spending some weeks with
you at Churchill, &amp; therefore, if quite convenient to you &amp;
Mrs. Vernon to receive me at present, I shall hope within a few
days to be introduced to a Sister whom I have so long desired to be
acquainted with. My kind friends here are most affectionately
urgent with me to prolong my stay, but their hospitable &amp;
chearful dispositions lead them too much into society for my
present situation &amp; state of mind; &amp; I impatiently look
forward to the hour when I shall be admitted into your delightful
retirement. I long to be made known to your dear little children,
in whose hearts I shall be very eager to secure an interest. I
shall soon have need for all my fortitude, as I am on the point of
separation from my own daughter. The long illness of her dear
Father prevented my paying her that attention which Duty &amp;
affection equally dictated, &amp; I have too much reason to fear
that the Governess to whose care I consigned her was unequal to the
charge. I have therefore resolved on placing her at one of the best
Private Schools in Town, where I shall have an opportunity of
leaving her myself, in my way to you. I am determined, you see, not
to be denied admittance at Churchill. It would indeed give me most
painful sensations to know that it were not in your power to
receive me.</p>
<p>Yr. most obliged &amp; affec: Sister</p>
<p>S. VERNON.</p>

<h2><a name="aii" id="aii">LETTER 2.</a></h2>
<p>Lady Susan Vernon to Mrs. Johnson.</p>
<p>Langford.</p>
<p>You were mistaken, my dear Alicia, in supposing me fixed at this
place for the rest of the winter. It grieves me to say how greatly
you were mistaken, for I have seldom spent three months more
agreeably than those which have just flown away. At present,
nothing goes smoothly; the Females of the Family are united against
me. You foretold how it would be when I first came to Langford,
&amp; Manwaring is so uncommonly pleasing that I was not without
apprehensions for myself. I remember saying to myself, as I drove
to the House, "I like this Man; pray Heaven no harm come of it!"
But I was determined to be discreet, to bear in mind my being only
four months a widow, &amp; to be as quiet as possible: &amp; I have
been so, My dear Creature; I have admitted no one's attentions but
Manwaring's. I have avoided all general flirtation whatever; I have
distinguished no Creature besides, of all the Numbers resorting
hither, except Sir James Martin, on whom I bestowed a little
notice, in order to detach him from Miss Manwaring; but if the
World could know my motive <i>there</i>, they would honour me. I
have been called an unkind Mother, but it was the sacred impulse of
maternal affection, it was the advantage of my Daughter that led me
on; &amp; if that Daughter were not the greatest simpleton on
Earth, I might have been rewarded for my Exertions as I ought.</p>
<p>Sir James did make proposals to me for Frederica; but Frederica,
who was born to be the torment of my life, chose to set herself so
violently against the match that I thought it better to lay aside
the scheme for the present. I have more than once repented that I
did not marry him myself; &amp; were he but one degree less
contemptibly weak, I certainly should, but I must own myself rather
romantic in that respect, &amp; that Riches only will not satisfy
me. The event of all this is very provoking: Sir James is gone,
Maria highly incensed, &amp; Mrs. Manwaring insupportably jealous;
so jealous, in short, &amp; so enraged against me, that, in the
fury of her temper, I should not be surprised at her appealing to
her Guardian, if she had the liberty of addressing him&mdash;but
there your Husband stands my friend; &amp; the kindest, most
amiable action of his Life was his throwing her off forever on her
Marriage. Keep up his resentment, therefore, I charge you. We are
now in a sad state; no house was ever more altered: the whole
family are at war, &amp; Manwaring scarcely dares speak to me. It
is time for me to be gone; I have therefore determined on leaving
them, &amp; shall spend, I hope, a comfortable day with you in Town
within this week. If I am as little in favour with Mr. Johnson as
ever, you must come to me at No. 10 Wigmore Street; but I hope this
may not be the case, for as Mr. Johnson, with all his faults, is a
Man to whom that great word "Respectable" is always given, &amp; I
am known to be so intimate with his wife, his slighting me has an
awkward Look.</p>
<p>I take Town in my way to that insupportable spot, a Country
Village; for I am really going to Churchill. Forgive me, my dear
friend, it is my last resource. Were there another place in England
open to me, I would prefer it. Charles Vernon is my aversion, &amp;
I am afraid of his wife. At Churchill, however, I must remain till
I have something better in view. My young Lady accompanies me to
Town, where I shall deposit her under the care of Miss Summers, in
Wigmore Street, till she becomes a little more reasonable. She will
make good connections there, as the Girls are all of the best
Families. The price is immense, &amp; much beyond what I can ever
attempt to pay.</p>
<p>Adieu, I will send you a line as soon as I arrive in
Town.&mdash;Yours Ever,</p>
<p>S. VERNON.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="aiii" id="aiii">LETTER 3.</a></h2>
<p>Mrs. Vernon to Lady De Courcy.</p>
<p>Churchill.</p>
<p>My dear Mother</p>
<p>I am very sorry to tell you that it will not be in our power to
keep our promise of spending our Christmas with you; &amp; we are
prevented that happiness by a circumstance which is not likely to
make us any amends. Lady Susan, in a letter to her Brother, has
declared her intention of visiting us almost
immediately&mdash;&amp; as such a visit is in all probability
merely an affair of convenience, it is impossible to conjecture its
length. I was by no means prepared for such an event, nor can I now
account for her Ladyship's conduct; Langford appeared so exactly
the place for her in every respect, as well from the elegant &amp;
expensive stile of living there, as from her particular attachment
to Mrs. Manwaring, that I was very far from expecting so speedy a
distinction, tho' I always imagined from her increasing friendship
for us since her Husband's death, that we should at some future
period be obliged to receive her. Mr. Vernon, I think, was a great
deal too kind to her when he was in Staffordshire; her behaviour to
him, independent of her general Character, has been so inexcusably
artful and ungenerous since our Marriage was first in agitation
that no one less amiable &amp; mild than himself could have
overlooked it all; &amp; tho', as his Brother's widow, &amp; in
narrow circumstances, it was proper to render her pecuniary
assistance, I cannot help thinking his pressing invitation to her
to visit us at Churchill perfectly unnecessary. Disposed, however,
as he always is to think the best of every one, her display of
Greif, &amp; professions of regret, &amp; general resolutions of
prudence were sufficient to soften his heart, &amp; make him really
confide in her sincerity. But as for myself, I am still
unconvinced; &amp; plausibly as her Ladyship has now written, I
cannot make up my mind till I better understand her real meaning in
coming to us. You may guess, therefore, my dear Madam, with what
feelings I look forward to her arrival. She will have occasion for
all those attractive Powers for which she is celebrated, to gain
any share of my regard; &amp; I shall certainly endeavour to guard
myself against their influence, if not accompanied by something
more substantial. She expresses a most eager desire of being
acquainted with me, &amp; makes very gracious mention of my
children, but I am not quite weak enough to suppose a woman who has
behaved with inattention if not unkindness to her own child, should
be attached to any of mine. Miss Vernon is to be placed at a school
in Town before her Mother comes to us, which I am glad of, for her
sake &amp; my own. It must be to her advantage to be separated from
her Mother, &amp; a girl of sixteen who has received so wretched an
education could not be a very desirable companion here. Reginald
has long wished, I know, to see the captivating Lady Susan, &amp;
we shall depend on his joining our party soon. I am glad to hear
that my Father continues so well; &amp; am, with best Love,
&amp;c.,</p>
<p>CATH. VERNON.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="aiv" id="aiv">LETTER 4.</a></h2>
<p>Mr. De Courcy to Mrs. Vernon.</p>
<p>Parklands.</p>
<p>My dear Sister</p>
<p>I congratulate you &amp; Mr. Vernon on being about to receive
into your family the most accomplished Coquette in England. As a
very distinguished Flirt, I have always been taught to consider
her; but it has lately fallen in my way to hear some particulars of
her conduct at Langford, which proves that she does not confine
herself to that sort of honest flirtation which satisfies most
people, but aspires to the more delicious gratification of making a
whole family miserable. By her behaviour to Mr. Manwaring she gave
jealousy &amp; wretchedness to his wife, &amp; by her attentions to
a young man previously attached to Mr. Manwaring's sister deprived
an amiable girl of her Lover. I learnt all this from a Mr. Smith,
now in this neighbourhood (I have dined with him, at Hurst &amp;
Wilford), who is just come from Langford, where he was a fortnight
in the house with her Ladyship, &amp; who is therefore well
qualified to make the communication.</p>
<p>What a Woman she must be! I long to see her, &amp; shall
certainly accept your kind invitation, that I may form some idea of
those bewitching powers which can do so much&mdash;engaging at the
same time, &amp; in the same house, the affections of two Men, who
were neither of them at liberty to bestow them&mdash;and all this
without the charm of Youth! I am glad to find Miss Vernon does not
accompany her Mother to Churchill, as she has not even Manners to
recommend her, &amp; according to Mr. Smith's account, is equally
dull &amp; proud. Where Pride &amp; Stupidity unite there can be no
dissimulation worthy notice, &amp; Miss Vernon shall be consigned
to unrelenting contempt; but by all that I can gather, Lady Susan
possesses a degree of captivating Deceit which it must be pleasing
to witness &amp; detect. I shall be with you very soon, &amp;
am</p>
<p>your affec. Brother R. DE COURCY</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="av" id="av">LETTER 5.</a></h2>
<p>Lady Susan Vernon to Mrs. Johnson.</p>
<p>Churchill.</p>
<p>I received your note, my dear Alicia, just before I left Town,
&amp; rejoice to be assured that Mr. Johnson suspected nothing of
your engagement the evening before. It is undoubtedly better to
deceive him entirely; since he will be stubborn, he must be
tricked. I arrived here in safety, &amp; have no reason to complain
of my reception from Mr. Vernon; but I confess myself not equally
satisfied with the behaviour of his Lady. She is perfectly
well-bred, indeed, &amp; has the air of a woman of fashion, but her
Manners are not such as can persuade me of her being prepossessed
in my favour. I wanted her to be delighted at seeing me&mdash;I was
as amiable as possible on the occasion&mdash;but all in vain. She
does not like me. To be sure, when we consider that I <i>did</i>
take some pains to prevent my Brother-in-law's marrying her, this
want of cordiality is not very surprising; &amp; yet it shews an
illiberal &amp; vindictive spirit to resent a project which
influenced me six years ago, &amp; which never succeeded at
last.</p>
<p>I am sometimes half disposed to repent that I did not let
Charles buy Vernon Castle, when we were obliged to sell it; but it
was a trying circumstance, especially as the sale took place
exactly at the time of his marriage; &amp; everybody ought to
respect the delicacy of those feelings which could not endure that
my Husband's Dignity should be lessened by his younger brother's
having possession of the Family Estate. Could Matters have been so
arranged as to prevent the necessity of our leaving the Castle,
could we have lived with Charles &amp; kept him single, I should
have been very far from persuading my husband to dispose of it
elsewhere; but Charles was then on the point of marrying Miss De
Courcy, &amp; the event has justified me. Here are Children in
abundance, &amp; what benefit could have accrued to me from his
purchasing Vernon? My having prevented it may perhaps have given
his wife an unfavourable impression&mdash;but where there is a
disposition to dislike, a motive will never be wanting; &amp; as to
money-matters it has not withheld him from being very useful to me.
I really have a regard for him, he is so easily imposed on!</p>
<p>The house is a good one, the Furniture fashionable, &amp;
everything announces plenty &amp; elegance. Charles is very rich, I
am sure; when a Man has once got his name in a Banking House, he
rolls in money. But they do not know what to do with it, keep very
little company, &amp; never go to Town but on business. We shall be
as stupid as possible. I mean to win my Sister-in-law's heart
through the children; I know all their names already, &amp; am
going to attach myself with the greatest sensibility to one in
particular, a young Frederic, whom I take on my lap &amp; sigh over
for his dear Uncle's sake.</p>
<p>Poor Manwaring!&mdash;I need not tell you how much I miss
him&mdash;how perpetually he is in my Thoughts. I found a dismal
letter from him on my arrival here, full of complaints of his wife
&amp; sister, &amp; lamentations on the cruelty of his fate. I
passed off the letter as his wife's, to the Vernons, &amp; when I
write to him, it must be under cover to you.</p>
<p>Yours Ever, S. V.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="avi" id="avi">LETTER 6.</a></h2>
<p>Mrs. Vernon to Mr. De Courcy.</p>
<p>Churchill</p>
<p>Well, my dear Reginald, I have seen this dangerous creature,
&amp; must give you some description of her, tho' I hope you will
soon be able to form your own judgement. She is really excessively
pretty. However you may choose to question the allurements of a
Lady no longer young, I must, for my own part, declare that I have
seldom seen so lovely a Woman as Lady Susan. She is delicately
fair, with fine grey eyes &amp; dark eyelashes; &amp; from her
appearance one would not suppose her more than five &amp; twenty,
tho' she must in fact be ten years older. I was certainly not
disposed to admire her, tho' always hearing she was beautiful; but
I cannot help feeling that she possesses an uncommon union of
Symmetry, Brilliancy, &amp; Grace. Her address to me was so gentle,
frank, &amp; even affectionate, that, if I had not known how much
she has always disliked me for marrying Mr. Vernon, &amp; that we
had never met before, I should have imagined her an attached
friend. One is apt, I beleive, to connect assurance of manner with
coquetry, &amp; to expect that an impudent address will naturally
attend an impudent mind; at least I was myself prepared for an
improper degree of confidence in Lady Susan; but her Countenance is
absolutely sweet, &amp; her voice &amp; manner winningly mild. I am
sorry it is so, for what is this but Deceit? Unfortunately, one
knows her too well. She is clever &amp; agreable, has all that
knowledge of the world which makes conversation easy, &amp; talks
very well with a happy command of Language, which is too often
used, I beleive, to make Black appear White. She has already almost
persuaded me of her being warmly attached to her daughter, tho' I
have been so long convinced to the contrary. She speaks of her with
so much tenderness &amp; anxiety, lamenting so bitterly the neglect
of her education, which she represents however as wholly
unavoidable, that I am forced to recollect how many successive
Springs her Ladyship spent in Town, while her Daughter was left in
Staffordshire to the care of servants, or a Governess very little
better, to prevent my believing what she says.</p>
<p>If her manners have so great an influence on my resentful heart,
you may judge how much more strongly they operate on Mr. Vernon's
generous temper. I wish I could be as well satisfied as he is, that
it was really her choice to leave Langford for Churchill; &amp; if
she had not stayed three months there before she discovered that
her friends' manner of Living did not suit her situation or
feelings, I might have beleived that concern for the loss of such a
Husband as Mr. Vernon, to whom her own behaviour was far from
unexceptionable, might for a time make her wish for retirement. But
I cannot forget the length of her visit to the Manwarings; &amp;
when I reflect on the different mode of Life which she led with
them, from that to which she must now submit, I can only suppose
that the wish of establishing her reputation by following, tho'
late, the path of propriety, occasioned her removal from a family
where she must in reality have been particularly happy. Your friend
Mr. Smith's story, however, cannot be quite correct, as she
corresponds regularly with Mrs. Manwaring. At any rate it must be
exaggerated; it is scarcely possible that two men should be so
grossly deceived by her at once.</p>
<p>Yrs. &amp;c. CATH. VERNON.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="avii" id="avii">LETTER 7.</a></h2>
<p>Lady Susan Vernon to Mrs. Johnson</p>
<p>Churchill.</p>
<p>My dear Alicia</p>
<p>You are very good in taking notice of Frederica, &amp; I am
grateful for it as a mark of your friendship; but as I cannot have
any doubt of the warmth of that friendship, I am far from exacting
so heavy a sacrifice. She is a stupid girl, &amp; has nothing to
recommend her. I would not, therefore, on any account have you
encumber one moment of your precious time by sending for her to
Edward Street, especially as every visit is so many hours deducted
from the grand affair of Education, which I really wish to be
attended to while she remains with Miss Summers. I want her to play
&amp; sing with some portion of Taste &amp; a good deal of
assurance, as she has <i>my</i> hand &amp; arm, &amp; a tolerable
voice. <i>I</i> was so much indulged in my infant years that I was
never obliged to attend to anything, &amp; consequently am without
the accomplishments which are now necessary to finish a pretty
Woman. Not that I am an advocate for the prevailing fashion of
acquiring a perfect knowledge of all Languages, Arts, &amp;
Sciences. It is throwing time away; to be Mistress of French,
Italian, &amp; German, Music, Singing, Drawing, &amp;c. will gain a
Woman some applause, but will not add one Lover to her list. Grace
&amp; Manner, after all, are of the greatest importance. I do not
mean, therefore, that Frederica's acquirements should be more than
superficial, &amp; I flatter myself that she will not remain long
enough at School to understand anything thoroughly. I hope to see
her the wife of Sir James within a twelvemonth. You know on what I
ground my hope, &amp; it is certainly a good foundation, for school
must be very humiliating to a girl of Frederica's age. And by the
by, you had better not invite her any more on that account, as I
wish her to find her situation as unpleasant as possible. I am sure
of Sir James at any time, &amp; could make him renew his
application by a Line. I shall trouble you meanwhile to prevent his
forming any other attachment when he comes to Town. Ask him to your
house occasionally, &amp; talk to him of Frederica, that he may not
forget her.</p>
<p>Upon the whole, I commend my own conduct in this affair
extremely, &amp; regard it as a very happy instance of
circumspection &amp; tenderness. Some Mothers would have insisted
on their daughter's accepting so good an offer on the first
overture, but I could not answer it to myself to force Frederica
into a marriage from which her heart revolted; &amp; instead of
adopting so harsh a measure, merely propose to make it her own
choice, by rendering her thoroughly uncomfortable till she does
accept him.&mdash;But enough of this tiresome girl.</p>
<p>You may well wonder how I contrive to pass my time here, &amp;
for the first week it was most insufferably dull. Now, however, we
begin to mend; our party is enlarged by Mrs. Vernon's Brother, a
handsome young Man, who promises me some amusement. There is
something about him which rather interests me, a sort of sauciness
&amp; familiarity which I shall teach him to correct. He is lively
&amp; seems clever;, &amp; when I have inspired him with greater
respect for me than his sister's kind offices have implanted, he
may be an agreable Flirt. There is exquisite pleasure in subduing
an insolent spirit, in making a person predetermined to dislike,
acknowledge one's superiority. I have disconcerted him already by
my calm reserve, &amp; it shall be my endeavour to humble the pride
of these self-important De Courcys still lower, to convince Mrs.
Vernon that her sisterly cautions have been bestowed in vain, &amp;
to persuade Reginald that she has scandalously belied me. This
project will serve at least to amuse me, &amp; prevent my feeling
so acutely this dreadful separation from You &amp; all whom I love.
Adieu.</p>
<p>Yours Ever</p>
<p>S. VERNON.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="aviii" id="aviii">LETTER 8.</a></h2>
<p>Mrs. Vernon to Lady De Courcy.</p>
<p>Churchill.</p>
<p>My dear Mother</p>
<p>You must not expect Reginald back again for some time. He
desires me to tell you that the present open weather induced him to
accept Mr. Vernon's invitation to prolong his stay in Sussex, that
they may have some hunting together. He means to send for his
Horses immediately, &amp; it is impossible to say when you may see
him in Kent. I will not disguise my sentiments on this change from
you, my dear Madam, tho' I think you had better not communicate
them to my father, whose excessive anxiety about Reginald would
subject him to an alarm which might seriously affect his health
&amp; spirits. Lady Susan has certainly contrived, in the space of
a fortnight, to make my Brother like her. In short, I am persuaded
that his continuing here beyond the time originally fixed for his
return is occasioned as much by a degree of fascination towards
her, as by the wish of hunting with Mr. Vernon, &amp; of course I
cannot receive that pleasure from the length of his visit which my
Brother's company would otherwise give me. I am, indeed, provoked
at the artifice of this unprincipled Woman. What stronger proof of
her dangerous abilities can be given than this perversion of
Reginald's judgement, which when he entered the house was so
decidedly against her? In his last letter he actually gave me some
particulars of her behaviour at Langford, such as he received from
a Gentleman who knew her perfectly well, which, if true, must raise
abhorrence against her, &amp; which Reginald himself was entirely
disposed to credit. His opinion of her, I am sure, was as low as of
any Woman in England; &amp; when he first came it was evident that
he considered her as one entitled neither to Delicacy nor respect,
&amp; that he felt she would be delighted with the attentions of
any Man inclined to flirt with her.</p>
<p>Her behaviour, I confess, has been calculated to do away with
such an idea; I have not detected the smallest impropriety in
it&mdash;nothing of vanity, of pretension, of Levity; &amp; she is
altogether so attractive that I should not wonder at his being
delighted with her, had he known nothing of her previous to this
personal acquaintance; but against reason, against conviction, to
be so well pleased with her, as I am sure he is, does really
astonish me. His admiration was at first very strong, but no more
than was natural, &amp; I did not wonder at his being much struck
by the gentleness &amp; delicacy of her Manners; but when he has
mentioned her of late it has been in terms of more extraordinary
praise; &amp; yesterday he actually said that he could not be
surprised at any effect produced on the heart of Man by such
Loveliness &amp; such Abilities; &amp; when I lamented, in reply,
the badness of her disposition, he observed that whatever might
have been her errors, they were to be imputed to her neglected
Education &amp; early Marriage, &amp; that she was altogether a
wonderful Woman.</p>
<p>This tendency to excuse her conduct, or to forget it in the
warmth of admiration, vexes me; &amp; if I did not know that
Reginald is too much at home at Churchill to need an invitation for
lengthening his visit, I should regret Mr. Vernon's giving him
any.</p>
<p>Lady Susan's intentions are of course those of absolute
coquetry, or a desire of universal admiration. I cannot for a
moment imagine that she has anything more serious in view; but it
mortifies me to see a young Man of Reginald's sense duped by her at
all. I am, &amp;c.</p>

<p>My dearest Friend</p>
<p>I congratulate you on Mr. De Courcy's arrival, &amp; I advise
you by all means to marry him; his Father's Estate is, we know,
considerable, &amp; I beleive certainly entailed. Sir Reginald is
very infirm, &amp; not likely to stand in your way long. I hear the
young Man well spoken of; &amp; tho' no one can really deserve you,
my dearest Susan, Mr. De Courcy may be worth having. Manwaring will
storm of course, but you may easily pacify him; besides, the most
scrupulous point of honour could not require you to wait for
<i>his</i> emancipation. I have seen Sir James; he came to Town for
a few days last week, &amp; called several times in Edward Street.
I talked to him about you &amp; your Daughter, &amp; he is so far
from having forgotten you, that I am sure he would marry either of
you with pleasure. I gave him hopes of Frederica's relenting, &amp;
told him a great deal of her improvements. I scolded him for making
Love to Maria Manwaring; he protested that he had been only in
joke, &amp; we both laughed heartily at her disappointment; and, in
short, were very agreable. He is as silly as ever.&mdash;Yours

<h2><a name="ax" id="ax">LETTER 10.</a></h2>
<p>Lady Susan Vernon to Mrs. Johnson</p>
<p>Churchill.</p>
<p>I am obliged to you, my dear friend, for your advice respecting
Mr. De Courcy, which I know was given with the full conviction of
its expediency, tho' I am not quite determined on following it. I
cannot easily resolve on anything so serious as Marriage;
especially as I am not at present in want of money, &amp; might
perhaps, till the old Gentleman's death, be very little benefited
by the match. It is true that I am vain enough to beleive it within
my reach. I have made him sensible of my power, &amp; can now enjoy
the pleasure of triumphing over a Mind prepared to dislike me,
&amp; prejudiced against all my past actions. His sister, too, is,
I hope, convinced how little the ungenerous representations of any
one to the disadvantage of another will avail when opposed to the
immediate influence of Intellect &amp; Manner. I see plainly that
she is uneasy at my progress in the good opinion of her Brother,
&amp; conclude that nothing will be wanting on her part to
counteract me; but having once made him doubt the justice of her
opinion of me, I think I may defy her. It has been delightful to me
to watch his advances towards intimacy, especially to observe his
altered manner in consequence of my repressing by the calm dignity
of my deportment his insolent approach to direct familiarity. My
conduct has been equally guarded from the first, &amp; I never
behaved less like a Coquette in the whole course of my Life, tho'
perhaps my desire of dominion was never more decided. I have
subdued him entirely by sentiment &amp; serious conversation, &amp;
made him, I may venture to say, at least <i>half</i> in Love with
me, without the semblance of the most commonplace flirtation. Mrs.
Vernon's consciousness of deserving every sort of revenge that it
can be in my power to inflict for her ill-offices could alone
enable her to perceive that I am actuated by any design in
behaviour so gentle &amp; unpretending. Let her think &amp; act as
she chuses, however. I have never yet found that the advice of a
Sister could prevent a young Man's being in love if he chose it. We
are advancing now towards some kind of confidence, &amp; in short
are likely to be engaged in a sort of platonic friendship. On
<i>my</i> side you may be sure of its never being more, for if I
were not already as much attached to another person as I can be to
any one, I should make a point of not bestowing my affection on a
Man who had dared to think so meanly of me.</p>
<p>Reginald has a good figure, &amp; is not unworthy the praise you
have heard given him, but is still greatly inferior to our friend
at Langford. He is less polished, less insinuating than Manwaring,
&amp; is comparatively deficient in the power of saying those
delightful things which put one in good humour with oneself &amp;
all the world. He is quite agreable enough, however, to afford me
amusement, &amp; to make many of those hours pass very pleasantly
which would otherwise be spent in endeavouring to overcome my
sister-in-law's reserve, &amp; listening to her Husband's insipid
talk.</p>
<p>Your account of Sir James is most satisfactory, &amp; I mean to
give Miss Frederica a hint of my intentions very soon.&mdash;Yours,
&amp;c.,</p>
<p>S. VERNON.</p>

<h2><a name="axi" id="axi">LETTER 11.</a></h2>
<p>Mrs. Vernon to Lady De Courcy.</p>
<p>Churchill.</p>
<p>I really grow quite uneasy, my dearest Mother, about Reginald,
from witnessing the very rapid increase of Lady Susan's influence.
They are now on terms of the most particular friendship, frequently
engaged in long conversations together; &amp; she has contrived by
the most artful coquetry to subdue his Judgement to her own
purposes. It is impossible to see the intimacy between them so very
soon established without some alarm, tho' I can hardly suppose that
Lady Susan's views extend to marriage. I wish you could get
Reginald home again under any plausible pretence; he is not at all
disposed to leave us, &amp; I have given him as many hints of my
Father's precarious state of health as common decency will allow me
to do in my own house. Her power over him must now be boundless, as
she has entirely effaced all his former ill-opinion, &amp;
persuaded him not merely to forget but to justify her conduct. Mr.
Smith's account of her proceedings at Langford, where he accused
her of having made Mr. Manwaring &amp; a young Man engaged to Miss
Manwaring distractedly in love with her, which Reginald firmly
beleived when he came to Churchill, is now, he is persuaded, only a
scandalous invention. He has told me so in a warmth of manner which
spoke his regret at having ever beleived the contrary himself.</p>
<p>How sincerely do I grieve that she ever entered this house! I
always looked forward to her coming with uneasiness; but very far
was it from originating in anxiety for Reginald. I expected a most
disagreable companion for myself, but could not imagine that my
Brother would be in the smallest danger of being captivated by a
Woman with whose principles he was so well acquainted, &amp; whose
character he so heartily despised. If you can get him away, it will
be a good thing.</p>

<h2><a name="axii" id="axii">LETTER 12.</a></h2>
<p>Sir Reginald De Courcy to his Son.</p>
<p>Parklands.</p>
<p>I know that young Men in general do not admit of any inquiry
even from their nearest relations into affairs of the heart, but I
hope, my dear Reginald, that you will be superior to such as allow
nothing for a Father's anxiety, &amp; think themselves privileged
to refuse him their confidence &amp; slight his advice. You must be
sensible that as an only son, &amp; the representative of an
ancient Family, your conduct in Life is most interesting to your
connections. In the very important concern of Marriage especially,
there is everything at stake&mdash;your own happiness, that of your
Parents, &amp; the credit of your name. I do not suppose that you
would deliberately form an absolute engagement of that nature
without acquainting your Mother &amp; myself, or at least without
being convinced that we should approve of your choice; but I cannot
help fearing that you may be drawn in, by the Lady who has lately
attached you, to a Marriage which the whole of your Family, far
&amp; near, must highly reprobate.</p>
<p>Lady Susan's age is itself a material objection, but her want of
character is one so much more serious that the difference of even
twelve years becomes in comparison of small amount. Were you not
blinded by a sort of fascination, it would be ridiculous in me to
repeat the instances of great misconduct on her side, so very
generally known. Her neglect of her husband, her encouragement of
other Men, her extravagance &amp; dissipation, were so gross &amp;
notorious that no one could be ignorant of them at the time, nor
can now have forgotten them. To our Family she has always been
represented in softened colours by the benevolence of Mr. Charles
Vernon; &amp; yet, in spite of his generous endeavours to excuse
her, we know that she did, from the most selfish motives, take all
possible pains to prevent his marrying Catherine.</p>
<p>My Years &amp; increasing Infirmities make me very desirous, my
dear Reginald, of seeing you settled in the world. To the Fortune
of your wife, the goodness of my own will make me indifferent; but
her family &amp; character must be equally unexceptionable. When
your choice is so fixed as that no objection can be made to either,
I can promise you a ready &amp; chearful consent; but it is my Duty
to oppose a Match which deep Art only could render probable, &amp;
must in the end make wretched.</p>
<p>It is possible her behaviour may arise only from Vanity, or the
wish of gaining the admiration of a Man whom she must imagine to be
particularly prejudiced against her; but it is more likely that she
should aim at something farther. She is poor, &amp; may naturally
seek an alliance which may be advantageous to herself. You know
your own rights, &amp; that it is out of my power to prevent your
inheriting the family Estate. My Ability of distressing you during
my Life would be a species of revenge to which I should hardly
stoop under any circumstances. I honestly tell you my Sentiments
&amp; Intentions: I do not wish to work on your Fears, but on your
Sense &amp; Affection. It would destroy every comfort of my Life to
know that you were married to Lady Susan Vernon: it would be the
death of that honest Pride with which I have hitherto considered my
son; I should blush to see him, to hear of him, to think of
him.</p>
<p>I may perhaps do no good but that of relieving my own mind by
this Letter, but I felt it my Duty to tell you that your partiality
for Lady Susan is no secret to your friends, &amp; to warn you
against her. I should be glad to hear your reasons for disbelieving
Mr. Smith's intelligence; you had no doubt of its authenticity a
month ago.</p>
<p>If you can give me your assurance of having no design beyond
enjoying the conversation of a clever woman for a short period,
&amp; of yielding admiration only to her Beauty &amp; Abilities,
without being blinded by them to her faults, you will restore me to
happiness; but if you cannot do this, explain to me, at least, what
has occasioned so great an alteration in your opinion of her.</p>
<p>I am, &amp;c.</p>

<h2><a name="axiii" id="axiii">LETTER 13.</a></h2>
<p>Lady De Courcy to Mrs. Vernon.</p>
<p>Parklands.</p>
<p>My dear Catherine</p>
<p>Unluckily I was confined to my room when your last letter came,
by a cold which affected my eyes so much as to prevent my reading
it myself; so I could not refuse your Father when he offered to
read it to me, by which means he became acquainted, to my great
vexation, with all your fears about your Brother. I had intended to
write to Reginald myself as soon as my eyes would let me, to point
out as well as I could the danger of an intimate acquaintance with
so artful a woman as Lady Susan, to a young Man of his age &amp;
high expectations. I meant, moreover, to have reminded him of our
being quite alone now, &amp; very much in need of him to keep up
our spirits these long winter evenings. Whether it would have done
any good can never be settled now, but I am excessively vexed that
Sir Reginald should know anything of a matter which we foresaw
would make him so uneasy. He caught all your fears the moment he
had read your Letter, and I am sure has not had the business out of
his head since. He wrote by the same post to Reginald a long letter
full of it all, amp; particularly asking an explanation of what he
may have heard from Lady Susan to contradict the late shocking
reports. His answer came this morning, which I shall enclose to
you, as I think you will like to see it. I wish it was more
satisfactory; but it seems written with such a determination to
think well of Lady Susan, that his assurances as to Marriage,
&amp;c., do not set my heart at ease. I say all I can, however, to
satisfy your Father, &amp; he is certainly less uneasy since
Reginald's letter. How provoking it is, my dear Catherine, that
this unwelcome Guest of yours should not only prevent our meeting
this Christmas, but be the occasion of so much vexation &amp;
trouble! Kiss the dear Children for me. Your affec: Mother,</p>
<p>C. DE COURCY.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="axiv" id="axiv">LETTER 14.</a></h2>
<p>Mr. De Courcy to Sir Reginald</p>
<p>Churchill.</p>
<p>My dear Sir</p>
<p>I have this moment received your Letter, which has given me more
astonishment than I ever felt before. I am to thank my Sister, I
suppose, for having represented me in such a light as to injure me
in your opinion, &amp; give you all this alarm. I know not why she
should chuse to make herself &amp; her family uneasy by
apprehending an Event which no one but herself, I can affirm, would
ever have thought possible. To impute such a design to Lady Susan
would be taking from her every claim to that excellent
understanding which her bitterest Enemies have never denied her;
&amp; equally low must sink my pretensions to common sense if I am
suspected of matrimonial views in my behaviour to her. Our
difference of age must be an insuperable objection, &amp; I entreat
you, my dear Sir, to quiet your mind, &amp; no longer harbour a
suspicion which cannot be more injurious to your own peace than to
our Understandings.</p>
<p>I can have no other view in remaining with Lady Susan, than to
enjoy for a short time (as you have yourself expressed it) the
conversation of a Woman of high mental powers. If Mrs. Vernon would
allow something to my affection for herself &amp; her husband in
the length of my visit, she would do more justice to us all; but my
Sister is unhappily prejudiced beyond the hope of conviction
against Lady Susan. From an attachment to her husband, which in
itself does honour to both, she cannot forgive the endeavours at
preventing their union which have been attributed to selfishness in
Lady Susan; but in this case, as well as in many others, the World
has most grossly injured that Lady, by supposing the worst where
the motives of her conduct have been doubtful.</p>
<p>Lady Susan had heard something so materially to the disadvantage
of my Sister, as to persuade her that the happiness of Mr. Vernon,
to whom she was always much attached, would be absolutely destroyed
by the Marriage. And this circumstance, while it explains the true
motive of Lady Susan's conduct, amp; removes all the blame which
has been so lavished on her, may also convince us how little the
general report of any one ought to be credited; since no character,
however upright, can escape the malevolence of slander. If my
Sister, in the security of retirement, with as little opportunity
as inclination to do Evil, could not avoid Censure, we must not
rashly condemn those who, living in the World &amp; surrounded with
temptation, should be accused of Errors which they are known to
have the power of committing.</p>
<p>I blame myself severely for having so easily beleived the
slanderous tales invented by Charles Smith to the prejudice of Lady
Susan, as I am now convinced how greatly they have traduced her. As
to Mrs. Manwaring's jealousy, it was totally his own invention,
&amp; his account of her attaching Miss Manwaring's Lover was
scarcely better founded. Sir James Martin had been drawn in by that
young Lady to pay her some attention; &amp; as he is a Man of
fortune, it was easy to see that <i>her</i> views extended to
Marriage. It is well known that Miss Manwaring is absolutely on the
catch for a husband, &amp; no one therefore can pity her for
losing, by the superior attractions of another woman, the chance of
being able to make a worthy Man completely miserable. Lady Susan
was far from intending such a conquest, &amp; on finding how warmly
Miss Manwaring resented her Lover's defection, determined, in spite
of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Manwaring's most earnest entreaties, to leave the
family. I have reason to imagine that she did receive serious
Proposals from Sir James, but her removing to Langford immediately
on the discovery of his attachment, must acquit her on that article
with any Mind of common candour. You will, I am sure, my dear Sir,
feel the truth of this, amp; will hereby learn to do justice to the
character of a very injured Woman.</p>
<p>I know that Lady Susan in coming to Churchill was governed only
by the most honourable &amp; amiable intentions; her prudence &amp;
economy are exemplary, her regard for Mr. Vernon equal even to
<i>his</i> deserts; &amp; her wish of obtaining my sister's good
opinion merits a better return than it has received. As a Mother
she is unexceptionable; her solid affection for her Child is shewn
by placing her in hands where her Education will be properly
attended to; but because she has not the blind &amp; weak
partiality of most Mothers, she is accused of wanting Maternal
Tenderness. Every person of Sense, however, will know how to value
amp; commend her well-directed affection, &amp; will join me in
wishing that Frederica Vernon may prove more worthy than she has
yet done of her Mother's tender care.</p>
<p>I have now, my dear Sir, written my real sentiments of Lady
Susan; you will know from this Letter how highly I admire her
Abilities, &amp; esteem her Character; but if you are not equally
convinced by my full &amp; solemn assurance that your fears have
been most idly created, you will deeply mortify &amp; distress
me.&mdash;I am, &amp;c.</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="axv" id="axv">LETTER 15.</a></h2>
<p>Mrs. Vernon to Lady De Courcy.</p>
<p>Churchill.</p>
<p>My dear Mother</p>
<p>I return you Reginald's letter, &amp; rejoice with all my heart
that my Father is made easy by it. Tell him so, with my
congratulations; but between ourselves, I must own it has only
convinced <i>me</i> of my Brother's having no <i>present</i>
intention of marrying Lady Susan&mdash;not that he is in no danger
of doing so three months hence. He gives a very plausible account
of her behaviour at Langford; I wish it may be true, but his
intelligence must come from herself, &amp; I am less disposed to
beleive it than to lament the degree of intimacy subsisting between
them implied by the discussion of such a subject.</p>
<p>I am sorry to have incurred his displeasure, but can expect
nothing better while he is so very eager in Lady Susan's
justification. He is very severe against me indeed, &amp; yet I
hope I have not been hasty in my judgement of her. Poor Woman! tho'
I have reasons enough for my dislike, I cannot help pitying her at
present, as she is in real distress, &amp; with too much cause. She
had this morning a letter from the Lady with whom she has placed
her daughter, to request that Miss Vernon might be immediately
removed, as she had been detected in an attempt to run away. Why,
or whither she intended to go, does not appear; but as her
situation seems to have been unexceptionable, it is a sad thing,
amp; of course highly afflicting to Lady Susan.</p>
<p>Frederica must be as much as sixteen, &amp; ought to know
better; but from what her Mother insinuates, I am afraid she is a
perverse girl. She has been sadly neglected, however, &amp; her
Mother ought to remember it.</p>
<p>Mr. Vernon set off for Town as soon as she had determined what
should be done. He is, if possible, to prevail on Miss Summers to
let Frederica continue with her; &amp; if he cannot succeed, to
bring her to Churchill for the present, till some other situation
can be found for her. Her Ladyship is comforting herself meanwhile
by strolling along the Shrubbery with Reginald, calling forth all
his tender feelings, I suppose, on this distressing occasion. She
has been talking a great deal about it to me. She talks vastly
well; I am afraid of being ungenerous, or I should say <i>too</i>
well to feel so very deeply. But I will not look for Faults; she
may be Reginald's Wife&mdash;Heaven forbid it!&mdash;but why should
I be quicker-sighted than anybody else? Mr. Vernon declares that he
never saw deeper distress than hers, on the receipt of the
Letter&mdash;&amp; is his judgement inferior to mine?</p>
<p>She was very unwilling that Frederica should be allowed to come
to Churchill, &amp; justly enough, as it seems a sort of reward to
Behaviour deserving very differently; but it was impossible to take
her anywhere else, &amp; she is not to remain here long.</p>
<p>"It will be absolutely necessary," said she, "as you, my dear
Sister, must be sensible, to treat my daughter with some severity
while she is here;&mdash;a most painful necessity, but I will
endeavour to submit to it. I am afraid I have often been too
indulgent, but my poor Frederica's temper could never bear
opposition well. You must support &amp; encourage me&mdash;You must
urge the necessity of reproof if you see me too lenient."</p>
<p>All this sounds very reasonably. Reginald is so incensed against
the poor silly Girl! Surely it is not to Lady Susan's credit that
he should be so bitter against her daughter; his idea of her must
be drawn from the Mother's description.</p>
<p>Well, whatever may be his fate, we have the comfort of knowing
that we have done our utmost to save him. We must commit the event
to an Higher Power. Yours Ever, &amp;c.</p>

<h2><a name="axvi" id="axvi">LETTER 16.</a></h2>
<p>Lady Susan to Mrs. Johnson</p>
<p>Churchill.</p>
<p>Never, my dearest Alicia, was I so provoked in my life as by a
Letter this morning from Miss Summers. That horrid girl of mine has
been trying to run away. I had not a notion of her being such a
little devil before, she seemed to have all the Vernon Milkiness;
but on receiving the letter in which I declared my intention about
Sir James, she actually attempted to elope; at least, I cannot
otherwise account for her doing it. She meant, I suppose, to go to
the Clarkes in Staffordshire, for she has no other acquaintance.
But she <i>shall</i> be punished, she <i>shall</i> have him. I have
sent Charles to Town to make matters up if he can, for I do not by
any means want her here. If Miss Summers will not keep her, you
must find me out another school, unless we can get her married
immediately. Miss S. writes word that she could not get the young
Lady to assign any cause for her extraordinary conduct, which
confirms me in my own private explanation of it.</p>
<p>Frederica is too shy, I think, &amp; too much in awe of me to
tell tales; but if the mildness of her Uncle <i>should</i> get
anything from her, I am not afraid. I trust I shall be able to make
my story as good as hers. If I am vain of anything, it is of my
eloquence. Consideration &amp; Esteem as surely follow command of
Language, as Admiration waits on Beauty. And here I have
opportunity enough for the exercise of my Talent, as the cheif of
my time is spent in Conversation. Reginald is never easy unless we
are by ourselves, &amp; when the weather is tolerable, we pace the
shrubbery for hours together. I like him on the whole very well; he
is clever &amp; has a good deal to say, but he is sometimes
impertinent &amp; troublesome. There is a sort of ridiculous
delicacy about him which requires the fullest explanation of
whatever he may have heard to my disadvantage, &amp; is never
satisfied till he thinks he has ascertained the beginning &amp; end
of everything.</p>
<p>This is <i>one</i> sort of Love, but I confess it does not
particularly recommend itself to me. I infinitely prefer the tender
&amp; liberal spirit of Manwaring, which, impressed with the
deepest conviction of my merit, is satisfied that whatever I do
must be right; &amp; look with a degree of contempt on the
inquisitive &amp; doubtful Fancies of that Heart which seems always
debating on the reasonableness of its Emotions. Manwaring is
indeed, beyond compare, superior to Reginald&mdash;superior in
everything but the power of being with me! Poor fellow! he is quite
distracted by Jealousy, which I am not sorry for, as I know no
better support of Love. He has been teizing me to allow of his
coming into this country, &amp; lodging somewhere near
<i>incog.</i>&mdash;but I forbid anything of the kind. Those women
are inexcusable who forget what is due to themselves &amp; the
opinion of the World.</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="axvii" id="axvii">LETTER 17.</a></h2>
<p>Mrs. Vernon to Lady De Courcy</p>
<p>Churchill.</p>
<p>My dear Mother</p>
<p>Mr. Vernon returned on Thursday night, bringing his neice with
him. Lady Susan had received a line from him by that day's post,
informing her that Miss Summers had absolutely refused to allow of
Miss Vernon's continuance in her Academy; we were therefore
prepared for her arrival, &amp; expected them impatiently the whole
evening. They came while we were at Tea, &amp; I never saw any
creature look so frightened in my life as Frederica when she
entered the room.</p>
<p>Lady Susan, who had been shedding tears before, &amp; shewing
great agitation at the idea of the meeting, received her with
perfect self-command, &amp; without betraying the least tenderness
of spirit. She hardly spoke to her, &amp; on Frederica's bursting
into tears as soon as we were seated, took her out of the room,
&amp; did not return for some time. When she did, her eyes looked
very red, amp; she was as much agitated as before. We saw no more
of her daughter.</p>
<p>Poor Reginald was beyond measure concerned to see his fair
friend in such distress, &amp; watched her with so much tender
solicitude, that I, who occasionally caught her observing his
countenance with exultation, was quite out of patience. This
pathetic representation lasted the whole evening, &amp; so
ostentatious &amp; artful a display had entirely convinced me that
she did in fact feel nothing.</p>
<p>I am more angry with her than ever since I have seen her
daughter; the poor girl looks so unhappy that my heart aches for
her. Lady Susan is surely too severe, for Frederica does not seem
to have the sort of temper to make severity necessary. She looks
perfectly timid, dejected, &amp; penitent.</p>
<p>She is very pretty, tho' not so handsome as her Mother, nor at
all like her. Her complexion is delicate, but neither so fair nor
so blooming as Lady Susan's&mdash;&amp; she has quite the Vernon
cast of countenance, the oval face &amp; mild dark eyes, &amp;
there is peculiar sweetness in her look when she speaks either to
her Uncle or me, for as we behave kindly to her we have of course
engaged her gratitude. Her Mother has insinuated that her temper is
untractable, but I never saw a face less indicative of any evil
disposition than hers; &amp; from what I now see of the behaviour
of each to the other, the invariable severity of Lady Susan &amp;
the silent dejection of Frederica, I am led to beleive as
heretofore that the former has no real Love for her daughter, &amp;
has never done her justice or treated her affectionately.</p>
<p>I have not yet been able to have any conversation with my neice;
she is shy, &amp; I think I can see that some pains are taken to
prevent her being much with me. Nothing satisfactory transpires as
to her reason for running away. Her kind-hearted Uncle, you may be
sure, was too fearful of distressing her to ask many questions as
they travelled. I wish it had been possible for me to fetch her
instead of him; I think I should have discovered the truth in the
course of a Thirty-mile Journey.</p>
<p>The small Pianoforte' has been removed within these few days, at
Lady Susan's request, into her Dressing room, &amp; Frederica
spends great part of the day there; <i>practising</i>, it is
called; but I seldom hear any noise when I pass that way. What she
does with herself there, I do not know; there are plenty of books
in the room, but it is not every girl who has been running wild the
first fifteen years of her life, that can or will read. Poor
Creature! the prospect from her window is not very instructive, for
that room overlooks the Lawn, you know, with the Shrubbery on one
side, where she may see her Mother walking for an hour together in
earnest conversation with Reginald. A girl of Frederica's age must
be childish indeed, if such things do not strike her. Is it not
inexcusable to give such an example to a daughter? Yet Reginald
still thinks Lady Susan the best of Mothers&mdash;still condemns
Frederica as a worthless girl! He is convinced that her attempt to
run away proceeded from no justifiable cause, &amp; had no
provocation. I am sure I cannot say that it <i>had</i>, but while
Miss Summers declares that Miss Vernon shewed no signs of Obstinacy
or Perverseness during her whole stay in Wigmore Street, till she
was detected in this scheme, I cannot so readily credit what Lady
Susan has made him &amp; wants to make me beleive, that it was
merely an impatience of restraint &amp; a desire of escaping from
the tuition of Masters which brought on the plan of an elopement.
Oh! Reginald, how is your Judgement enslaved! He scarcely dares
even allow her to be handsome, &amp; when I speak of her beauty,
replies only that her eyes have no Brilliancy!</p>
<p>Sometimes he is sure she is deficient in Understanding, &amp; at
others that her temper only is in fault. In short, when a person is
always to deceive, it is impossible to be consistent. Lady Susan
finds it necessary for her own justification that Frederica should
be to blame, &amp; probably has sometimes judged it expedient to
accuse her of ill-nature &amp; sometimes to lament her want of
sense. Reginald is only repeating after her Ladyship.</p>

<p>From the same to the same.</p>
<p>Churchill.</p>
<p>My dear Madam</p>
<p>I am very glad to find that my description of Frederica Vernon
has interested you, for I do beleive her truly deserving of your
regard; &amp; when I have communicated a notion which has recently
struck me, your kind impressions in her favour will, I am sure, be
heightened. I cannot help fancying that she is growing partial to
my Brother; I so very often see her eyes fixed on his face with a
remarkable expression of pensive admiration! He is certainly very
handsome; &amp; yet more, there is an openness in his manner that
must be highly prepossessing, &amp; I am sure she feels it so.
Thoughtful &amp; pensive in general, her countenance always
brightens into a smile when Reginald says anything amusing; and,
let the subject be ever so serious that he may be conversing on, I
am much mistaken if a syllable of his uttering escapes her.</p>
<p>I want to make <i>him</i> sensible of all this, for we know the
power of gratitude on such a heart as his; &amp; could Frederica's
artless affection detach him from her Mother, we might bless the
day which brought her to Churchill. I think, my dear Madam, you
would not disapprove of her as a Daughter. She is extremely young,
to be sure, has had a wretched Education, &amp; a dreadful example
of Levity in her Mother; but yet I can pronounce her disposition to
be excellent, &amp; her natural abilities very good. Though totally
without accomplishments, she is by no means so ignorant as one
might expect to find her, being fond of books &amp; spending the
cheif of her time in reading. Her Mother leaves her more to herself
now than she <i>did</i>, &amp; I have her with me as much as
possible, &amp; have taken great pains to overcome her timidity. We
are very good friends, &amp; tho' she never opens her lips before
her Mother, she talks enough when alone with me to make it clear
that, if properly treated by Lady Susan, she would always appear to
much greater advantage. There cannot be a more gentle, affectionate
heart; or more obliging manners, when acting without restraint. Her
little Cousins are all very fond of her.</p>

<h2><a name="axix" id="axix">LETTER 19.</a></h2>
<p>Lady Susan to Mrs. Johnson.</p>
<p>Churchill.</p>
<p>You will be eager, I know, to hear something farther of
Frederica, &amp; perhaps may think me negligent for not writing
before. She arrived with her Uncle last Thursday fortnight, when,
of course, I lost no time in demanding the reason of her behaviour;
&amp; soon found myself to have been perfectly right in attributing
it to my own letter. The purport of it frightened her so thoroughly
that, with a mixture of true girlish perverseness &amp; folly,
without considering that she could not escape from my authority by
running away from Wigmore Street, she resolved on getting out of
the house &amp; proceeding directly by the stage to her friends,
the Clarkes; &amp; had really got as far as the length of two
streets in her journey when she was fortunately miss'd, pursued,
&amp; overtaken.</p>
<p>Such was the first distinguished exploit of Miss Frederica
Susanna Vernon; amp; if we consider that it was achieved at the
tender age of sixteen, we shall have room for the most flattering
prognostics of her future renown. I am excessively provoked,
however, at the parade of propriety which prevented Miss Summers
from keeping the girl; &amp; it seems so extraordinary a piece of
nicety, considering my daughter's family connections, that I can
only suppose the Lady to be governed by the fear of never getting
her money. Be that as it may, however, Frederica is returned on my
hands; and having now nothing else to employ her, is busy in
pursuing the plan of Romance begun at Langford. She is actually
falling in love with Reginald De Courcy! To disobey her Mother by
refusing an unexceptionable offer is not enough; her affections
must likewise be given without her Mother's approbation. I never
saw a girl of her age bid fairer to be the sport of Mankind. Her
feelings are tolerably acute, &amp; she is so charmingly artless in
their display as to afford the most reasonable hope of her being
ridiculed amp; despised by every Man who sees her.</p>
<p>Artlessness will never do in Love matters; &amp; that girl is
born a simpleton who has it either by nature or affectation. I am
not yet certain that Reginald sees what she is about; nor is it of
much consequence. She is now an object of indifference to him; she
would be one of contempt were he to understand her Emotions. Her
beauty is much admired by the Vernons, but it has no effect on
<i>him</i>. She is in high favour with her Aunt
altogether&mdash;because she is so little like myself, of course.
She is exactly the companion for Mrs. Vernon, who dearly loves to
be first, &amp; to have all the sense &amp; all the wit of the
Conversation to herself: Frederica will never eclipse her. When she
first came, I was at some pains to prevent her seeing much of her
Aunt; but I have since relaxed, as I beleive I may depend on her
observing the rules I have laid down for their discourse.</p>
<p>But do not imagine that with all this Lenity I have for a moment
given up my plan of her marriage; No, I am unalterably fixed on
this point, tho' I have not yet quite decided on the manner of
bringing it about. I should not chuse to have the business brought
forward here, &amp; canvassed by the wise heads of Mr. amp; Mrs.
Vernon; &amp; I cannot just now afford to go to Town. Miss
Frederica therefore must wait a little.</p>
<p>Yours Ever</p>

<h2><a name="axx" id="axx">LETTER 20.</a></h2>
<p>Mrs. Vernon to Lady De Courcy.</p>
<p>Churchill.</p>
<p>We have a very unexpected Guest with us at present, my dear
Mother. He arrived yesterday. I heard a carriage at the door, as I
was sitting with my children while they dined; &amp; supposing I
should be wanted, left the Nursery soon afterwards, &amp; was
half-way downstairs, when Frederica, as pale as ashes, came running
up, &amp; rushed by me into her own room. I instantly followed,
amp; asked her what was the matter. "Oh!" cried she, "he is come,
Sir James is come&mdash;&amp; what am I to do?" This was no
explanation; I begged her to tell me what she meant. At that moment
we were interrupted by a knock at the door: it was Reginald, who
came, by Lady Susan's direction, to call Frederica down. "It is Mr.
De Courcy!" said she, colouring violently. "Mamma has sent for me,
&amp; I must go." We all three went down together; &amp; I saw my
Brother examining the terrified face of Frederica with surprise. In
the breakfast-room we found Lady Susan, &amp; a young Man of
genteel appearance, whom she introduced to me by the name of Sir
James Martin&mdash;the very person, as you may remember, whom it
was said she had been at pains to detach from Miss Manwaring. But
the conquest, it seems, was not designed for herself, or she has
since transferred it to her daughter; for Sir James is now
desperately in love with Frederica, &amp; with full encouragement
from Mama. The poor girl, however, I am sure, dislikes him; amp;
tho' his person &amp; address are very well, he appears, both to
Mr. Vernon &amp; me, a very weak young Man.</p>
<p>Frederica looked so shy, so confused, when we entered the room,
that I felt for her exceedingly. Lady Susan behaved with great
attention to her Visitor; amp; yet I thought I could perceive that
she had no particular pleasure in seeing him. Sir James talked a
great deal, &amp; made many civil excuses to me for the liberty he
had taken in coming to Churchill&mdash;mixing more frequent
laughter with his discourse than the subject required&mdash;said
many things over &amp; over again, &amp; told Lady Susan three
times that he had seen Mrs. Johnson a few Evenings before. He now
&amp; then addressed Frederica, but more frequently her Mother. The
poor girl sat all this time without opening her lips&mdash;her eyes
cast down, &amp; her colour varying every instant; while Reginald
observed all that passed in perfect silence.</p>
<p>At length Lady Susan, weary I beleive of her situation, proposed
walking; amp; we left the two gentlemen together, to put on our
Pelisses.</p>
<p>As we went upstairs, Lady Susan begged permission to attend me
for a few moments in my Dressing room, as she was anxious to speak
with me in private. I led her thither accordingly, &amp; as soon as
the door was closed, she said, "I was never more surprised in my
life than by Sir James's arrival, &amp; the suddenness of it
requires some apology to <i>You</i>, my dear Sister; tho' to
<i>me</i>, as a Mother, it is highly flattering. He is so extremely
attached to my Daughter that he could not exist longer without
seeing her. Sir James is a young man of an amiable disposition
&amp; excellent character; a little too much of the <i>Rattle</i>,
perhaps, but a year or two will rectify <i>that</i>; &amp; he is in
other respects so very eligible a Match for Frederica, that I have
always observed his attachment with the greatest pleasure, &amp; am
persuaded that you &amp; my Brother will give the alliance your
hearty approbation. I have never before mentioned the likelihood of
its taking place to any one, because I thought that while Frederica
continued at school it had better not be known to exist; but now,
as I am convinced that Frederica is too old ever to submit to
school confinement, &amp; have therefore begun to consider her
union with Sir James as not very distant, I had intended within a
few days to acquaint yourself &amp; Mr. Vernon with the whole
business. I am sure, my dear Sister, you will excuse my remaining
silent so long, &amp; agree with me that such circumstances, while
they continue from any cause in suspense, cannot be too cautiously
concealed. When you have the happiness of bestowing your sweet
little Catherine, some years hence, on a Man who in connection
&amp; character is alike unexceptionable, you will know what I feel
now; tho' Thank Heaven! you cannot have all my reasons for
rejoicing in such an Event. Catherine will be amply provided for,
&amp; not, like my Frederica, indebted to a fortunate Establishment
for the comforts of Life."</p>
<p>She concluded by demanding my congratulations. I gave them
somewhat awkwardly, I beleive; for in fact, the sudden disclosure
of so important a matter took from me the power of speaking with
any clearness. She thanked me, however, most affectionately, for my
kind concern in the welfare of herself amp; daughter; &amp; then
said,</p>
<p>"I am not apt to deal in professions, my dear Mrs. Vernon, &amp;
I never had the convenient talent of affecting sensations foreign
to my heart; &amp; therefore I trust you will beleive me when I
declare that, much as I had heard in your praise before I knew you,
I had no idea that I should ever love you as I now do; &amp; I must
further say that your friendship towards me is more particularly
gratifying because I have reason to beleive that some attempts were
made to prejudice you against me. I only wish that
They&mdash;whoever they are&mdash;to whom I am indebted for such
kind intentions, could see the terms on which we now are together,
&amp; understand the real affection we feel for each other! But I
will not detain you any longer. God bless you for your goodness to
me &amp; my girl, amp; continue to you all your present
happiness."</p>
<p>What can one say of such a Woman, my dear Mother? Such
earnestness, such solemnity of expression! &amp; yet I cannot help
suspecting the truth of everything she said.</p>
<p>As for Reginald, I beleive he does not know what to make of the
matter. When Sir James first came, he appeared all astonishment
&amp; perplexity. The folly of the young Man &amp; the confusion of
Frederica entirely engrossed him; &amp; tho' a little private
discourse with Lady Susan has since had its effect, he is still
hurt, I am sure, at her allowing of such a Man's attentions to her
daughter.</p>
<p>Sir James invited himself with great composure to remain here a
few days&mdash;hoped we would not think it odd, was aware of its
being very impertinent, but he took the liberty of a relation;
&amp; concluded by wishing, with a laugh, that he might be really
one soon. Even Lady Susan seemed a little disconcerted by this
forwardness; in her heart, I am persuaded, she sincerely wishes him
gone.</p>
<p>But something must be done for this poor Girl, if her feelings
are such as both her Uncle &amp; I beleive them to be. She must not
be sacrificed to Policy or Ambition; she must not be even left to
suffer from the dread of it. The Girl whose heart can distinguish
Reginald De Courcy deserves, however he may slight her, a better
fate than to be Sir James Martin's wife. As soon as I can get her
alone, I will discover the real Truth; but she seems to wish to
avoid me. I hope this does not proceed from anything wrong, &amp;
that I shall not find out I have thought too well of her. Her
behaviour to Sir James certainly speaks the greatest consciousness
&amp; Embarrassment, but I see nothing in it more like
Encouragement.</p>

<p>Miss Vernon to Mr. De Courcy.</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>I hope you will excuse this liberty; I am forced upon it by the
greatest distress, or I should be ashamed to trouble you. I am very
miserable about Sir James Martin, &amp; have no other way in the
world of helping myself but by writing to you, for I am forbidden
ever speaking to my Uncle or Aunt on the subject; amp; this being
the case, I am afraid my applying to you will appear no better than
equivocation, &amp; as if I attended only to the letter &amp; not
the spirit of Mama's commands. But if <i>you</i> do not take my
part &amp; persuade her to break it off, I shall be half
distracted, for I cannot bear him. No human Being but <i>you</i>
could have any chance of prevailing with her. If you will,
therefore, have the unspeakable great kindness of taking my part
with her, &amp; persuading her to send Sir James away, I shall be
more obliged to you than it is possible for me to express. I always
disliked him from the first; it is not a sudden fancy, I assure
you, Sir; I always thought him silly &amp; impertinent &amp;
disagreable, &amp; now he is grown worse than ever. I would rather
work for my bread than marry him. I do not know how to apologize
enough for this Letter; I know it is taking so great a liberty; I
am aware how dreadfully angry it will make Mama, but I must run the
risk. I am, Sir, your most Humble Servt.</p>

<h2><a name="axxii" id="axxii">LETTER 22.</a></h2>
<p>Lady Susan to Mrs. Johnson</p>
<p>Churchill.</p>
<p>This is insufferable! My dearest friend, I was never so enraged
before, amp; must relieve myself by writing to you, who I know will
enter into all my feelings. Who should come on Tuesday but Sir
James Martin! Guess my astonishment &amp; vexation&mdash;for, as
you well know, I never wished him to be seen at Churchill. What a
pity that you should not have known his intentions! Not content
with coming, he actually invited himself to remain here a few days.
I could have poisoned him! I made the best of it, however, &amp;
told my story with great success to Mrs. Vernon, who, whatever
might be her real sentiments, said nothing in opposition to mine. I
made a point also of Frederica's behaving civilly to Sir James,
&amp; gave her to understand that I was absolutely determined on
her marrying him. She said something of her misery, but that was
all. I have for some time been more particularly resolved on the
Match from seeing the rapid increase of her affection for Reginald,
&amp; from not feeling perfectly secure that a knowledge of
<i>that</i> affection might not in the end awaken a return.
Contemptible as a regard founded only on compassion must make them
both in my eyes, I felt by no means assured that such might not be
the consequence. It is true that Reginald had not in any degree
grown cool towards me; but yet he had lately mentioned Frederica
spontaneously &amp; unnecessarily, &amp; once had said something in
praise of her person.</p>
<p><i>He</i> was all astonishment at the appearance of my visitor,
&amp; at first observed Sir James with an attention which I was
pleased to see not unmixed with jealousy; but unluckily it was
impossible for me really to torment him, as Sir James, tho'
extremely gallant to me, very soon made the whole party understand
that his heart was devoted to my daughter.</p>
<p>I had no great difficulty in convincing De Courcy, when we were
alone, that I was perfectly justified, all things considered, in
desiring the match; &amp; the whole business seemed most
comfortably arranged. They could none of them help perceiving that
Sir James was no Solomon; but I had positively forbidden
Frederica's complaining to Charles Vernon or his wife, &amp; they
had therefore no pretence for Interference; tho' my impertinent
Sister, I beleive, wanted only opportunity for doing so.</p>
<p>Everything, however, was going on calmly &amp; quietly; &amp;
tho' I counted the hours of Sir James's stay, my mind was entirely
satisfied with the posture of affairs. Guess, then, what I must
feel at the sudden disturbance of all my schemes; &amp; that, too,
from a quarter whence I had least reason to apprehend it. Reginald
came this morning into my Dressing room with a very unusual
solemnity of countenance, &amp; after some preface informed me in
so many words that he wished to reason with me on the Impropriety
&amp; Unkindness of allowing Sir James Martin to address my
Daughter contrary to <i>her</i> inclination. I was all amazement.
When I found that he was not to be laughed out of his design, I
calmly required an explanation, &amp; begged to know by what he was
impelled, &amp; by whom commissioned to reprimand me. He then told
me, mixing in his speech a few insolent compliments, &amp;
ill-timed expressions of Tenderness, to which I listened with
perfect indifference, that my daughter had acquainted him with some
circumstances concerning herself, Sir James, &amp; me, which gave
him great uneasiness.</p>
<p>In short, I found that she had in the first place actually
written to him to request his interference, &amp; that on receiving
her Letter, he had conversed with her on the subject of it, in
order to understand the particulars, &amp; assure himself of her
real wishes!</p>
<p>I have not a doubt but that the girl took this opportunity of
making downright Love to him. I am convinced of it from the manner
in which he spoke of her. Much good may such Love do him! I shall
ever despise the Man who can be gratified by the Passion which he
never wished to inspire, nor solicited the avowal of. I shall
always detest them both. He can have no true regard for me, or he
would not have listened to her; and she, with her little rebellious
heart &amp; indelicate feelings, to throw herself into the
protection of a young Man with whom she has scarcely ever exchanged
two words before! I am equally confounded at <i>her</i> Impudence
&amp; <i>his</i> Credulity. How dared he beleive what she told him
in my disfavour! Ought he not to have felt assured that I must have
unanswerable Motives for all that I had done? Where was his
reliance on my Sense &amp; Goodness then? Where the resentment
which true Love would have dictated against the person defaming
me&mdash;that person, too, a Chit, a Child, without Talent or
Education, whom he had been always taught to despise?</p>
<p>I was calm for some time; but the greatest degree of Forbearance
may be overcome, &amp; I hope I was afterwards sufficiently keen.
He endeavoured, long endeavoured, to soften my resentment; but that
woman is a fool indeed who, while insulted by accusation, can be
worked on by compliments. At length he left me, as deeply provoked
as myself; &amp; he shewed his anger <i>more</i>. I was quite cool,
but he gave way to the most violent indignation. I may therefore
expect it will the sooner subside; &amp; perhaps his may be
vanished forever, while mine will be found still fresh &amp;
implacable.</p>
<p>He is now shut up in his apartment, whither I heard him go on
leaving mine. How unpleasant, one would think, must his reflections
be! But some people's feelings are incomprehensible. I have not yet
tranquillized myself enough to see Frederica. <i>She</i> shall not
soon forget the occurrences of this day; she shall find that she
has poured forth her tender Tale of Love in vain, &amp; exposed
herself forever to the contempt of the whole world, &amp; the
severest Resentment of her injured Mother.</p>

<h2><a name="axxiii" id="axxiii">LETTER 23.</a></h2>
<p>Mrs. Vernon to Lady De Courcy</p>
<p>Churchill.</p>
<p>Let me congratulate you, my dearest Mother! The affair which has
given us so much anxiety is drawing to a happy conclusion. Our
prospect is most delightful; &amp; since matters have now taken so
favourable a turn, I am quite sorry that I ever imparted my
apprehensions to you; for the pleasure of learning that the danger
is over is perhaps dearly purchased by all that you have previously
suffered.</p>
<p>I am so much agitated by Delight that I can scarcely hold a pen;
but am determined to send you a few short lines by James, that you
may have some explanation of what must so greatly astonish you, as
that Reginald should be returning to Parklands.</p>
<p>I was sitting about half an hour ago with Sir James in the
Breakfast parlour, when my Brother called me out of the room. I
instantly saw that something was the matter; his complexion was
raised, &amp; he spoke with great emotion. You know his eager
manner, my dear Madam, when his mind is interested.</p>
<p>"Catherine," said he, "I am going home today; I am sorry to
leave you, but I must go. It is a great while since I have seen my
Father &amp; Mother. I am going to send James forward with my
Hunters immediately; if you have any Letter, therefore, he can take
it. I shall not be at home myself till Wednesday or Thursday, as I
shall go through London, where I have business. But before I leave
you," he continued, speaking in a lower voice, &amp; with still
greater energy, "I must warn you of one thing&mdash;do not let
Frederica Vernon be made unhappy by that Martin. He wants to marry
her&mdash;her Mother promotes the Match&mdash;but <i>she</i> cannot
endure the idea of it. Be assured that I speak from the fullest
conviction of the Truth of what I say; I <i>know</i> that Frederica
is made wretched by Sir James' continuing here. She is a sweet
girl, &amp; deserves a better fate. Send him away immediately.
<i>He</i> is only a fool&mdash;but what her Mother can mean, Heaven
only knows! Good-bye," he added, shaking my hand with
earnestness&mdash;"I do not know when you will see me again; but
remember what I tell you of Frederica; you <i>must</i> make it your
business to see justice done her. She is an amiable girl, &amp; has
a very superior Mind to what we have ever given her credit
for."</p>
<p>He then left me, &amp; ran upstairs. I would not try to stop
him, for I know what his feelings must be; the nature of mine, as I
listened to him, I need not attempt to describe. For a minute or
two, I remained in the same spot, overpowered by wonder&mdash;of a
most agreable sort indeed; yet it required some consideration to be
tranquilly happy.</p>
<p>In about ten minutes after my return to the parlour, Lady Susan
entered the room. I concluded, of course, that she &amp; Reginald
had been quarrelling, amp; looked with anxious curiosity for a
confirmation of my beleif in her face. Mistress of Deceit, however,
she appeared perfectly unconcerned, &amp; after chatting on
indifferent subjects for a short time, said to me, "I find from
Wilson that we are going to lose Mr. De Courcy&mdash;is it true
that he leaves Churchill this morning?" I replied that it was. "He
told us nothing of all this last night," said she, laughing, "or
even this morning at Breakfast; but perhaps he did not know it
himself. Young Men are often hasty in their resolutions&mdash;&amp;
not more sudden in forming than unsteady in keeping them. I should
not be surprised if he were to change his mind at last, &amp; not
go." She soon afterwards left the room. I trust, however, my dear
Mother, that we have no reason to fear an alteration of his present
plan; things have gone too far. They must have quarrelled, &amp;
about Frederica too. Her calmness astonishes me. What delight will
be yours in seeing him again, in seeing him still worthy of your
Esteem, still capable of forming your Happiness!</p>
<p>When I next write, I shall be able, I hope, to tell you that Sir
James is gone, Lady Susan vanquished, &amp; Frederica at peace. We
have much to do, but it shall be done. I am all impatience to hear
how this astonishing change was effected. I finish as I began, with
the warmest congratulations.</p>

<p>From the same to the same.</p>
<p>Churchill.</p>
<p>Little did I imagine, my dear Mother, when I sent off my last
letter, that the delightful perturbation of spirits I was then in
would undergo so speedy, so melancholy a reverse! I never can
sufficiently regret that I wrote to you at all. Yet who could have
foreseen what has happened? My dear Mother, every hope which but
two hours ago made me so happy is vanished. The quarrel between
Lady Susan &amp; Reginald is made up, &amp; we are all as we were
before. One point only is gained; Sir James Martin is dismissed.
What are we now to look forward to? I am indeed disappointed.
Reginald was all but gone, his horse was ordered &amp; all but
brought to the door! Who would not have felt safe?</p>
<p>For half an hour, I was in momentary expectation of his
departure. After I had sent off my Letter to you, I went to Mr.
Vernon, &amp; sat with him in his room talking over the whole
matter. I then determined to look for Frederica, whom I had not
seen since breakfast. I met her on the stairs, &amp; saw that she
was crying.</p>
<p>"My dear Aunt," said she, "he is going&mdash;Mr. De Courcy is
going, &amp; it is all my fault. I am afraid you will be angry, but
indeed I had no idea it would end so."</p>
<p>"My Love," replied I, "do not think it necessary to apologize to
me on that account. I shall feel myself under an obligation to any
one who is the means of sending my brother home, because,"
recollecting myself, "I know my Father wants very much to see him.
But what is it that <i>you</i> have done to occasion all this?"</p>
<p>She blushed deeply as she answered, "I was so unhappy about Sir
James that I could not help&mdash;I have done something very wrong
I know&mdash;but you have not an idea of the misery I have been in,
&amp; Mama had ordered me never to speak to you or my Uncle about
it,&mdash;&amp;&mdash;" "You therefore spoke to my Brother, to
engage <i>his</i> interference," said I, to save her the
explanation. "No; but I wrote to him&mdash;I did indeed. I got up
this morning before it was light&mdash;I was two hours about
it&mdash;&amp; when my Letter was done, I thought I never should
have courage to give it. After breakfast, however, as I was going
to my room, I met him in the passage, &amp; then, as I knew that
everything must depend on that moment, I forced myself to give it.
He was so good as to take it immediately. I dared not look at him,
&amp; ran away directly. I was in such a fright that I could hardly
breathe. My dear Aunt, you do not know how miserable I have
been."</p>
<p>"Frederica," said I, "you ought to have told <i>me</i> all your
distresses. You would have found in me a friend always ready to
assist you. Do you think that your Uncle &amp; I should not have
espoused your cause as warmly as my Brother?"</p>
<p>"Indeed, I did not doubt your goodness," said she, colouring
again, "but I thought Mr. De Courcy could do anything with my
Mother; but I was mistaken: they have had a dreadful quarrel about
it, &amp; he is going. Mama will never forgive me, &amp; I shall be
worse off than ever." "No, you shall not," replied I.&mdash;"In
such a point as this, your Mother's prohibition ought not to have
prevented your speaking to me on the subject. She has no right to
make you unhappy, &amp; she shall <i>not</i> do it. Your applying,
however, to Reginald can be productive only of Good to all parties.
I beleive it is best as it is. Depend upon it that you shall not be
made unhappy any longer."</p>
<p>At that moment, how great was my astonishment at seeing Reginald
come out of Lady Susan's Dressing room. My heart misgave me
instantly. His confusion on seeing me was very evident. Frederica
immediately disappeared. "Are you going?" said I. "You will find
Mr. Vernon in his own room." "No, Catherine," replied he, "I am
<i>not</i> going. Will you let me speak to you a moment?"</p>
<p>We went into my room. "I find," continued he, his confusion
increasing as he spoke, "that I have been acting with my usual
foolish impetuosity. I have entirely misunderstood Lady Susan,
&amp; was on the point of leaving the house under a false
impression of her conduct. There has been some very great
mistake&mdash;we have been all mistaken, I fancy. Frederica does
not know her Mother&mdash;Lady Susan means nothing but her
Good&mdash;but Frederica will not make a friend of her. Lady Susan
therefore does not always know what will make her daughter happy.
Besides, <i>I</i> could have no right to interfere&mdash;Miss
Vernon was mistaken in applying to me. In short, Catherine,
everything has gone wrong&mdash;but it is now all happily settled.
Lady Susan, I beleive, wishes to speak to you about it, if you are
at leisure."</p>
<p>"Certainly," replied I, deeply sighing at the recital of so lame
a story. I made no comments, however, for words would have been
vain.</p>
<p>Reginald was glad to get away; &amp; I went to Lady Susan;
curious, indeed, to hear her account of it. "Did I not tell you,"
said she, with a smile, "that your Brother would not leave us after
all?" "You did, indeed," replied I, very gravely; "but I flattered
myself that you would be mistaken." "I should not have hazarded
such an opinion," returned she, "if it had not at that moment
occurred to me that his resolution of going might be occasioned by
a Conversation in which we had been this morning engaged, &amp;
which had ended very much to his Dissatisfaction, from our not
rightly understanding each other's meaning. This idea struck me at
the moment, &amp; I instantly determined that an accidental
dispute, in which I might probably be as much to blame as himself,
should not deprive you of your Brother. If you remember, I left the
room almost immediately. I was resolved to lose no time in clearing
up those mistakes as far as I could. The case was this: Frederica
had set herself violently against marrying Sir James&mdash;" "And
can your Ladyship wonder that she should?" cried I, with some
warmth; "Frederica has an excellent Understanding, &amp; Sir James
has none." "I am at least very far from regretting it, my dear
sister," said she; "on the contrary, I am grateful for so
favourable a sign of my Daughter's sense. Sir James is certainly
under par&mdash;(his boyish manners make him appear the
worse)&mdash;&amp; had Frederica possessed the penetration, the
abilities which I could have wished in my Daughter, or had I even
known her to possess as much as she does, I should not have been
anxious for the match." "It is odd that you should alone be
ignorant of your Daughter's sense." "Frederica never does justice
to herself; her manners are shy &amp; childish. She is besides
afraid of me; she scarcely loves me. During her poor Father's life
she was a spoilt child; the severity which it has since been
necessary for me to shew has alienated her affection; neither has
she any of that Brilliancy of Intellect, that Genius, or Vigour of
Mind which will force itself forward." "Say rather that she has
been unfortunate in her education!" "Heaven knows, my dearest Mrs.
Vernon, how fully I am aware of <i>that</i>; but I would wish to
forget every circumstance that might throw blame on the memory of
one whose name is sacred with me."</p>
<p>Here she pretended to cry; I was out of patience with her. "But
what," said I, "was your Ladyship going to tell me about your
disagreement with my Brother?" "It originated in an action of my
Daughter's which equally marks her want of Judgement &amp; the
unfortunate Dread of me I have been mentioning&mdash;she wrote to
Mr. De Courcy." "I know she did; you had forbidden her speaking to
Mr. Vernon or to me on the cause of her distress; what could she
do, therefore, but apply to my Brother?" "Good God!" she exclaimed,
"what an opinion you must have of me! Can you possibly suppose that
I was aware of her unhappiness? that it was my object to make my
own child miserable, &amp; that I had forbidden her speaking to you
on the subject from fear of your interrupting the Diabolical
scheme? Do you think me destitute of every honest, every natural
feeling? Am I capable of consigning <i>her</i> to everlasting
Misery whose welfare it is my first Earthly Duty to promote?" "The
idea is horrible. What, then, was your intention when you insisted
on her silence?" "Of what use, my dear Sister, could be any
application to you, however the affair might stand? Why should I
subject you to entreaties which I refused to attend to myself?
Neither for your sake, for hers, nor for my own, could such a thing
be desirable. When my own resolution was taken, I could not wish
for the interference, however friendly, of another person. I was
mistaken, it is true, but I beleived myself right." "But what was
this mistake to which your Ladyship so often alludes? From whence
arose so astonishing a misconception of your Daughter's feelings?
Did you not know that she disliked Sir James?" "I knew that he was
not absolutely the Man she would have chosen, but I was persuaded
that her objections to him did not arise from any perception of his
Deficiency. You must not question me, however, my dear Sister, too
minutely on this point," continued she, taking me affectionately by
the hand; "I honestly own that there is something to conceal.
Frederica makes me very unhappy! Her applying to Mr. De Courcy hurt
me particularly." "What is it you mean to infer," said I, "by this
appearance of mystery? If you think your Daughter at all attached
to Reginald, her objecting to Sir James could not less deserve to
be attended to than if the cause of her objecting had been a
consciousness of his folly; &amp; why should your Ladyship, at any
rate, quarrel with my Brother for an interference which you must
know it is not in his nature to refuse when urged in such a
manner?"</p>
<p>"His disposition, you know, is warm, &amp; he came to
expostulate with me; his compassion all alive for this ill-used
Girl, this Heroine in distress! We misunderstood each other: he
beleived me more to blame than I really was; I considered his
interference less excusable than I now find it. I have a real
regard for him, &amp; was beyond expression mortified to find it,
as I thought, so ill bestowed. We were both warm, &amp; of course
both to blame. His resolution of leaving Churchill is consistent
with his general eagerness. When I understood his intention,
however, &amp; at the same time began to think that we had been
perhaps equally mistaken in each other's meaning, I resolved to
have an explanation before it was too late. For any Member of your
Family I must always feel a degree of affection, &amp; I own it
would have sensibly hurt me if my acquaintance with Mr. De Courcy
had ended so gloomily. I have now only to say farther, that as I am
convinced of Frederica's having a reasonable dislike to Sir James,
I shall instantly inform him that he must give up all hope of her.
I reproach myself for having ever, tho' innocently, made her
unhappy on that score. She shall have all the retribution in my
power to make; if she value her own happiness as much as I do, if
she judge wisely, &amp; command herself as she ought, she may now
be easy. Excuse me, my dearest Sister, for thus trespassing on your
time, but I owed it to my own Character; &amp; after this
explanation I trust I am in no danger of sinking in your
opinion."</p>
<p>I could have said, "Not much, indeed!" but I left her almost in
silence. It was the greatest stretch of Forbearance I could
practise. I could not have stopped myself had I begun. Her
assurance, her Deceit&mdash;but I will not allow myself to dwell on
them; they will strike you sufficiently. My heart sickens within
me.</p>
<p>As soon as I was tolerably composed I returned to the Parlour.
Sir James's carriage was at the door, &amp; he, merry as usual,
soon afterwards took his leave. How easily does her Ladyship
encourage or dismiss a Lover!</p>
<p>In spite of this release, Frederica still looks unhappy, still
fearful, perhaps, of her Mother's anger; &amp; tho' dreading my
Brother's departure, jealous, it may be, of his staying. I see how
closely she observes him &amp; Lady Susan. Poor Girl, I have now no
hope for her. There is not a chance of her affection being
returned. He thinks very differently of her from what he used to
do, he does her some justice, but his reconciliation with her
Mother precludes every dearer hope.</p>
<p>Prepare, my dear Madam, for the worst. The probability of their
marrying is surely heightened. He is more securely hers than ever.
When that wretched Event takes place, Frederica must wholly belong
to us.</p>
<p>I am thankful that my last Letter will precede this by so
little, as every moment that you can be saved from feeling a Joy
which leads only to disappointment is of consequence.</p>

<h2><a name="axxv" id="axxv">LETTER 25.</a></h2>
<p>Lady Susan to Mrs. Johnson.</p>
<p>Churchill.</p>
<p>I call on you, dear Alicia, for congratulations: I am again
myself;&mdash;gay and triumphant! When I wrote to you the other day
I was, in truth, in high irritation, and with ample cause. Nay, I
know not whether I ought to be quite tranquil now, for I have had
more trouble in restoring peace than I ever intended to submit
to&mdash;a spirit, too, resulting from a fancied sense of superior
Integrity, which is peculiarly insolent! I shall not easily forgive
him, I assure you. He was actually on the point of leaving
Churchill! I had scarcely concluded my last, when Wilson brought me
word of it. I found, therefore, that something must be done; for I
did not chuse to leave my character at the mercy of a Man whose
passions are so violent and resentful. It would have been trifling
with my reputation to allow of his departing with such an
impression in my disfavour; in this light, condescension was
necessary.</p>
<p>I sent Wilson to say that I desired to speak with him before he
went; he came immediately. The angry emotions which had marked
every feature when we last parted were partially subdued. He seemed
astonished at the summons, amp; looked as if half wishing &amp;
half fearing to be softened by what I might say.</p>
<p>If my Countenance expressed what I aimed at, it was composed and
dignified&mdash;and yet with a degree of pensiveness which might
convince him that I was not quite happy. "I beg your pardon Sir,
for the liberty I have taken in sending for you, said I; but as I
have just learnt your intention of leaving this place to-day, I
feel it my duty to entreat that you will not on my account shorten
your visit here even an hour. I am perfectly aware that after what
has passed between us it would ill suit the feelings of either to
remain longer in the same house: so very great, so total a change
from the intimacy of Friendship must render any future intercourse
the severest punishment; &amp; your resolution of quitting
Churchill is undoubtedly in unison with our situation, &amp; with
those lively feelings which I know you to possess. But at the same
time it is not for me to suffer such a sacrifice as it must be to
leave Relations to whom you are so much attached &amp; are so dear.
My remaining here cannot give that pleasure to Mr. &amp; Mrs.
Vernon which your society must; &amp; my visit has already perhaps
been too long. My removal, therefore, which must at any rate take
place soon, may with perfect convenience be hastened; &amp; I make
it my particular request that I may not in any way be instrumental
in separating a family so affectionately attached to each other.
Where <i>I</i> go is of no consequence to any one; of very little
to myself; but <i>you</i> are of importance to all your
connections." Here I concluded, &amp; I hope you will be satisfied
with my speech. Its effect on Reginald justifies some portion of
vanity, for it was no less favourable than instantaneous. Oh, how
delightful it was to watch the variations of his Countenance while
I spoke! to see the struggle between returning Tenderness amp; the
remains of Displeasure. There is something agreable in feelings so
easily worked on; not that I envy him their possession, nor would,
for the world, have such myself; but they are very convenient when
one wishes to influence the passions of another. And yet this
Reginald, whom a very few words from me softened at once into the
utmost submission, &amp; rendered more tractable, more attached,
more devoted than ever, would have left me in the first angry
swelling of his proud heart without deigning to seek an
explanation.</p>
<p>Humbled as he now is, I cannot forgive him such an instance of
pride, &amp; am doubtful whether I ought not to punish him by
dismissing him at once after this reconciliation, or by marrying
&amp; teizing him for ever. But these measures are each too violent
to be adopted without some deliberation; at present my Thoughts are
fluctuating between various schemes. I have many things to compass:
I must punish Frederica, &amp; pretty severely too, for her
application to Reginald; I must punish him for receiving it so
favourably, &amp; for the rest of his conduct. I must torment my
Sister-in-law for the insolent triumph of her Look &amp; Manner
since Sir James has been dismissed; for in reconciling Reginald to
me, I was not able to save that ill-fated young Man;&mdash;&amp; I
must make myself amends for the humiliation to which I have stooped
within these few days. To effect all this I have various plans. I
have also an idea of being soon in Town; &amp; whatever may be my
determination as to the rest, I shall probably put <i>that</i>
project in execution&mdash;for London will always be the fairest
field of action, however my views may be directed; &amp; at any
rate I shall there be rewarded by your society, &amp; a little
Dissipation, for a ten weeks' penance at Churchill.</p>
<p>I beleive I owe it to my own Character to complete the match
between my daughter &amp; Sir James, after having so long intended
it. Let me know your opinion on this point. Flexibility of Mind, a
Disposition easily biassed by others, is an attribute which you
know I am not very desirous of obtaining; nor has Frederica any
claim to the indulgence of her notions at the expense of her
Mother's inclination. Her idle Love for Reginald, too! It is surely
my duty to discourage such romantic nonsense. All things
considered, therefore, it seems incumbent on me to take her to Town
&amp; marry her immediately to Sir James.</p>
<p>When my own will is effected contrary to his, I shall have some
credit in being on good terms with Reginald, which at present, in
fact, I have not; for tho' he is still in my power, I have given up
the very article by which our quarrel was produced, &amp; at best
the honour of victory is doubtful.</p>
<p>Send me your opinion on all these matters, my dear Alicia, &amp;
let me know whether you can get lodgings to suit me within a short
distance of you.</p>

<p>S. VERNON.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="axxvi" id="axxvi">LETTER 26.</a></h2>
<p>Mrs. Johnson to Lady Susan</p>
<p>Edward St.</p>
<p>I am gratified by your reference, &amp; this is my advice: that
you come to Town yourself, without loss of time, but that you leave
Frederica behind. It would surely be much more to the purpose to
get yourself well established by marrying Mr. De Courcy, than to
irritate him &amp; the rest of his family by making her marry Sir
James. You should think more of yourself &amp; less of your
Daughter. She is not of a disposition to do you credit in the
World, &amp; seems precisely in her proper place at Churchill, with
the Vernons. But <i>you</i> are fitted for Society, &amp; it is
shameful to have you exiled from it. Leave Frederica, therefore, to
punish herself for the plague she has given you, by indulging that
romantic tender-heartedness which will always ensure her misery
enough, &amp; come yourself to Town as soon as you can.</p>
<p>I have another reason for urging this:</p>
<p>Manwaring came to town last week, &amp; has contrived, in spite
of Mr. Johnson, to make opportunities of seeing me. He is
absolutely miserable about you, amp; jealous to such a degree of De
Courcy, that it would be highly unadvisable for them to meet at
present. And yet, if you do not allow him to see you here, I cannot
answer for his not committing same great imprudence&mdash;such as
going to Churchill, for instance, which would be dreadful! Besides,
if you take my advice, &amp; resolve to marry De Courcy, it will be
indispensably necessary to you to get Manwaring out of the way;
&amp; you only can have influence enough to send him back to his
wife. I have still another motive for your coming: Mr. Johnson
leaves London next Tuesday; he is going for his health to Bath,
where, if the waters are favourable to his constitution &amp; my
wishes, he will be laid up with the gout many weeks. During his
absence we shall be able to choose our own society, &amp; to have
true enjoyment. I would ask you to Edward Street, but that he once
forced from me a kind of promise never to invite you to my house;
nothing but my being in the utmost distress for Money should have
extorted it from me. I can get you, however, a nice
Drawing-room-apartment in Upper Seymour St, &amp; we may be always
together there or here; for I consider my promise to Mr. Johnson as
comprehending only (at least in his absence) your not sleeping in
the House.</p>
<p>Poor Manwaring gives me such histories of his wife's jealousy.
Silly Woman, to expect constancy from so charming a Man! but she
always was silly&mdash;intolerably so in marrying him at all. She
the Heiress of a large Fortune, he without a shilling! <i>One</i>
title, I know, she might have had, besides Baronets. Her folly in
forming the connection was so great that tho' Mr. Johnson was her
Guardian, &amp; I do not in general share his feelings, I never can
forgive her.</p>
<p>Adieu, Yours, ALICIA.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="axxvii" id="axxvii">LETTER 27.</a></h2>
<p>Mrs. Vernon to Lady De Courcy</p>
<p>Churchill.</p>
<p>This letter, my dear Mother, will be brought you by Reginald.
His long visit is about to be concluded at last, but I fear the
separation takes place too late to do us any good. <i>She</i> is
going to London to see her particular friend, Mrs. Johnson. It was
at first her intention that Frederica should accompany her, for the
benefit of Masters, but we over-ruled her there. Frederica was
wretched in the idea of going, &amp; I could not bear to have her
at the mercy of her Mother; not all the Masters in London could
compensate for the ruin of her comfort. I should have feared, too,
for her health, &amp; for everything but her
Principles&mdash;<i>there</i> I beleive she is not to be injured by
her Mother, or all her Mother's friends; but with those friends (a
very bad set, I doubt not) she must have mixed, or have been left
in total solitude, &amp; I can hardly tell which would have been
worse for her. If she is with her Mother, moreover, she must, alas!
in all probability be with Reginald&mdash;&amp; that would be the
greatest evil of all.</p>
<p>Here we shall in time be in peace. Our regular employments, our
Books amp; conversation, with Exercise, the Children, &amp; every
domestic pleasure in my power to procure her, will, I trust,
gradually overcome this youthful attachment. I should not have a
doubt of it, were she slighted for any other woman in the world
than her own Mother.</p>
<p>How long Lady Susan will be in Town, or whether she returns here
again, I know not. I could not be cordial in my invitation; but if
she chuses to come, no want of cordiality on my part will keep her
away.</p>
<p>I could not help asking Reginald if he intended being in Town
this winter, as soon as I found her Ladyship's steps would be bent
thither; &amp; tho' he professed himself quite undetermined, there
was something in his look &amp; voice as he spoke which
contradicted his words. I have done with Lamentation. I look upon
the event as so far decided that I resign myself to it in despair.
If he leaves you soon for London, everything will be concluded.</p>
<p>Your affecly</p>

<h2><a name="axxviii" id="axxviii">LETTER 28.</a></h2>
<p>Mrs. Johnson to Lady Susan.</p>
<p>Edward St.</p>
<p>My dearest Friend</p>
<p>I write in the greatest distress; the most unfortunate event has
just taken place. Mr. Johnson has hit on the most effectual manner
of plaguing us all. He had heard, I imagine, by some means or
other, that you were soon to be in London, &amp; immediately
contrived to have such an attack of the Gout as must at least delay
his journey to Bath, if not wholly prevent it. I am persuaded the
Gout is brought on or kept off at pleasure; it was the same when I
wanted to join the Hamiltons to the Lakes; &amp; three years ago,
when <i>I</i> had a fancy for Bath, nothing could induce him to
have a Gouty symptom.</p>
<p>I have received yours, &amp; have engaged the Lodgings in
consequence. I am pleased to find that my Letter had so much effect
on you, &amp; that De Courcy is certainly your own. Let me hear
from you as soon as you arrive, &amp; in particular tell me what
you mean to do with Manwaring. It is impossible to say when I shall
be able to see you; my confinement must be great. It is such an
abominable trick to be ill here instead of at Bath that I can
scarcely command myself at all. At Bath, his old Aunts would have
nursed him, but here it all falls upon me&mdash;&amp; he bears pain
with such patience that I have not the common excuse for losing my
temper.</p>
<p>Yrs. Ever,</p>

<h2><a name="axxix" id="axxix">LETTER 29.</a></h2>
<p>Lady Susan Vernon to Mrs. Johnson.</p>
<p>Upper Seymour St.</p>
<p>My dear Alicia</p>
<p>There needed not this last fit of the Gout to make me detest Mr.
Johnson, but now the extent of my aversion is not to be estimated.
To have you confined as Nurse in his apartment! My dear Alicia, of
what a mistake were you guilty in marrying a Man of his
age!&mdash;just old enough to be formal, ungovernable, &amp; to
have the Gout; too old to be agreable, too young to die.</p>
<p>I arrived last night about five, &amp; had scarcely swallowed my
dinner when Manwaring made his appearance. I will not dissemble
what real pleasure his sight afforded me, nor how strongly I felt
the contrast between his person amp; manners &amp; those of
Reginald, to the infinite disadvantage of the latter. For an hour
or two I was even staggered in my resolution of marrying him, &amp;
tho' this was too idle &amp; nonsensical an idea to remain long on
my mind, I do not feel very eager for the conclusion of my
Marriage, nor look forward with much impatience to the time when
Reginald, according to our agreement, is to be in Town. I shall
probably put off his arrival under some pretence or other. He must
not come till Manwaring is gone.</p>
<p>I am still doubtful at times as to Marriage. If the old Man
would die, I might not hesitate; but a state of dependence on the
caprice of Sir Reginald will not suit the freedom of my spirit;
&amp; if I resolve to wait for that event, I shall have excuse
enough at present, in having been scarcely ten months a Widow.</p>
<p>I have not given Manwaring any hint of my intention, or allowed
him to consider my acquaintance with Reginald as more than the
commonest flirtation, amp; he is tolerably appeased. Adieu, till we
meet; I am enchanted with my Lodgings.</p>
<p>Yrs. ever,</p>
<p>S. VERNON.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="axxx" id="axxx">LETTER 30.</a></h2>
<p>Lady Susan Vernon to Mr. De Courcy</p>
<p>Upper Seymour St.</p>
<p>I have received your Letter, &amp; tho' I do not attempt to
conceal that I am gratified by your impatience for the hour of
meeting, I yet feel myself under the necessity of delaying that
hour beyond the time originally fixed. Do not think me unkind for
such an exercise of my power, nor accuse me of Instability without
first hearing my reasons. In the course of my journey from
Churchill, I had ample leisure for reflection on the present state
of our affairs, &amp; every review has served to convince me that
they require a delicacy &amp; cautiousness of conduct to which we
have hitherto been too little attentive. We have been hurried on by
our feelings to a degree of Precipitation which ill accords with
the claims of our Friends or the opinion of the World. We have been
unguarded in forming this hasty Engagement, but we must not
complete the imprudence by ratifying it while there is so much
reason to fear the Connection would be opposed by those Friends on
whom you depend.</p>
<p>It is not for us to blame any expectations on your Father's side
of your marrying to advantage; where possessions are so extensive
as those of your Family, the wish of increasing them, if not
strictly reasonable, is too common to excite surprise or
resentment. He has a right to require a woman of fortune in his
daughter in law, &amp; I am sometimes quarrelling with myself for
suffering you to form a connection so imprudent; but the influence
of reason is often acknowledged too late by those who feel like
me.</p>
<p>I have now been but a few months a widow; and, however little
indebted to my Husband's memory for any happiness derived from him
during a Union of some years, I cannot forget that the indelicacy
of so early a second marriage must subject me to the censure of the
World, &amp; incur, what would be still more insupportable, the
displeasure of Mr. Vernon. I might perhaps harden myself in time
against the injustice of general reproach, but the loss of
<i>his</i> valued Esteem I am, as you well know, ill-fitted to
endure; &amp; when to this may be added the consciousness of having
injured you with your Family, how am I to support myself? With
feelings so poignant as mine, the conviction of having divided the
son from his Parents would make me, even with <i>you</i>, the most
miserable of Beings.</p>
<p>It will surely, therefore, be advisable to delay our Union, to
delay it till appearances are more promising, till affairs have
taken a more favourable turn. To assist us in such a resolution, I
feel that absence will be necessary. We must not meet. Cruel as
this sentence may appear, the necessity of pronouncing it, which
can alone reconcile it to myself, will be evident to you when you
have considered our situation in the light in which I have found
myself imperiously obliged to place it. You may be&mdash;you must
be&mdash;well assured that nothing but the strongest conviction of
Duty could induce me to wound my own feelings by urging a
lengthened separation, &amp; of insensibility to yours you will
hardly suspect me. Again, therefore, I say that we ought not, we
must not yet meet. By a removal for some Months from each other, we
shall tranquillize the sisterly fears of Mrs. Vernon, who,
accustomed herself to the enjoyment of riches, considers Fortune as
necessary everywhere, &amp; whose Sensibilities are not of a nature
to comprehend ours.</p>
<p>Let me hear from you soon&mdash;very soon. Tell me that you
submit to my Arguments, &amp; do not reproach me for using such. I
cannot bear reproaches: my spirits are not so high as to need being
repressed. I must endeavour to seek amusement abroad, &amp;
fortunately many of my Friends are in town; among them the
Manwarings; you know how sincerely I regard both Husband &amp;
wife.</p>
<p>I am ever, Faithfully Yours</p>

<p>My dear Friend,</p>
<p>That tormenting creature Reginald is here. My Letter, which was
intended to keep him longer in the Country, has hastened him to
Town. Much as I wish him away, however, I cannot help being pleased
with such a proof of attachment. He is devoted to me, heart &amp;
soul. He will carry this note himself, which is to serve as an
Introduction to you, with whom he longs to be acquainted. Allow him
to spend the Evening with you, that I may be in no danger of his
returning here. I have told him that I am not quite well, &amp;
must be alone; &amp; should he call again there might be confusion,
for it is impossible to be sure of servants. Keep him, therefore, I
entreat you, in Edward St. You will not find him a heavy companion,
&amp; I allow you to flirt with him as much as you like. At the
same time do not forget my real interest; say all that you can to
convince him that I shall be quite wretched if he remains here; you
know my reasons&mdash;Propriety, &amp; so forth. I would urge them
more myself, but that I am impatient to be rid of him, as Manwaring
comes within half an hour. Adieu,</p>

<p>My dear Creature,</p>
<p>I am in agonies, &amp; know not what to do, nor what <i>you</i>
can do. Mr. De Courcy arrived just when he should not. Mrs.
Manwaring had that instant entered the House, &amp; forced herself
into her Guardian's presence, tho' I did not know a syllable of it
till afterwards, for I was out when both she &amp; Reginald came,
or I should have sent him away at all events; but <i>she</i> was
shut up with Mr. Johnson, while <i>he</i> waited in the Drawing
room for me. She arrived yesterday in pursuit of her Husband; but
perhaps you know this already from himself. She came to this house
to entreat my Husband's interference, &amp; before I could be aware
of it, everything that you could wish to be concealed was known to
him, amp; unluckily she had wormed out of Manwaring's servant that
he had visited you every day since your being in Town, &amp; had
just watched him to your door herself! What could I do? Facts are
such horrid things! All is by this time known to De Courcy, who is
now alone with Mr. Johnson. Do not accuse me; indeed, it was
impossible to prevent it. Mr. Johnson has for some time suspected
De Courcy of intending to marry you, &amp; would speak with him
alone as soon as he knew him to be in the House.</p>
<p>That detestable Mrs. Manwaring, who, for your comfort, has
fretted herself thinner &amp; uglier than ever, is still here,
&amp; they have been all closeted together. What can be done? At
any rate, I hope he will plague his wife more than ever. With
anxious wishes,</p>

<p>This Eclaircissement is rather provoking. How unlucky that you
should have been from home! I thought myself sure of you at 7. I am
undismayed, however. Do not torment yourself with fears on my
account; depend on it, I can make my story good with Reginald.
Manwaring is just gone; he brought me the news of his wife's
arrival. Silly woman, what does she expect by such Manoeuvres? Yet
I wish she had staid quietly at Langford.</p>
<p>Reginald will be a little enraged at first, but by To-morrow's
Dinner everything will be well again.</p>

<p>Mr. De Courcy to Lady Susan.</p>
<p>Hotel.</p>
<p>I write only to bid you Farewell. The spell is removed; I see
you as you are. Since we parted yesterday, I have received from
indisputable authority such an history of you as must bring the
most mortifying conviction of the Imposition I have been under,
&amp; the absolute necessity of an immediate &amp; eternal
separation from you. You cannot doubt to what I allude.
Langford&mdash;Langford&mdash;that word will be sufficient. I
received my information in Mr. Johnson's house, from Mrs. Manwaring
herself.</p>
<p>You know how I have loved you; you can intimately judge of my
present feelings; but I am not so weak as to find indulgence in
describing them to a woman who will glory in having excited their
anguish, but whose affection they have never been able to gain.</p>

<p>I will not attempt to describe my astonishment in reading the
note this moment received from you. I am bewildered in my
endeavours to form some rational conjecture of what Mrs. Manwaring
can have told you, to occasion so extraordinary a change in your
sentiments. Have I not explained everything to you with respect to
myself which could bear a doubtful meaning, &amp; which the
ill-nature of the World had interpreted to my Discredit? What can
you <i>now</i> have heard to stagger your Esteem for me? Have I
ever had a concealment from you? Reginald, you agitate me beyond
expression. I cannot suppose that the old story of Mrs. Manwaring's
jealousy can be revived again, or at least be <i>listened</i> to
again. Come to me immediately, &amp; explain what is at present
absolutely incomprehensible. Beleive me, the single word of
<i>Langford</i> is not of such potent intelligence as to supersede
the necessity of more. If we <i>are</i> to part, it will at least
be handsome to take your personal Leave. But I have little heart to
jest; in truth, I am serious enough&mdash;for to be sunk, tho' but
for an hour, in your esteem is an humiliation to which I know not
how to submit. I shall count every minute till your arrival.</p>

<p>Mr. De Courcy to Lady Susan</p>
<p>Hotel.</p>
<p>Why would you write to me? Why do you require particulars? But
since it must be so, I am obliged to declare that all the accounts
of your misconduct during the life &amp; since the death of Mr.
Vernon, which had reached me, in common with the World in general,
&amp; gained my entire belief before I saw you, but which you, by
the exertion of your perverted Abilities, had made me resolve to
disallow, have been unanswerably proved to me. Nay, more, I am
assured that a connection of which I had never before entertained a
thought, has for some time existed, &amp; still continues to exist,
between you &amp; the Man whose family you robbed of its Peace, in
return for the hospitality with which you were received into it!
That you have corresponded with him ever since your leaving
Langford&mdash;not with his wife&mdash;but with him&mdash;&amp;
that he now visits you every day. Can you, dare you deny it? &amp;
all this at the time when I was an encouraged, an accepted Lover!
From what have I not escaped! I have only to be grateful. Far from
me be all complaint, &amp; every sigh of regret. My own Folly had
endangered me, my Preservation I owe to the kindness, the Integrity
of another. But the unfortunate Mrs. Manwaring, whose agonies while
she related the past seemed to threaten her reason&mdash;how is
<i>she</i> to be consoled?</p>
<p>After such a discovery as this, you will scarcely affect further
wonder at my meaning in bidding you Adieu. My Understanding is at
length restored, &amp; teaches me no less to abhor the Artifices
which had subdued me than to despise myself for the weakness on
which their strength was founded.</p>

I rejoice to find that the prudent advice of your Parents has not

<p>Mrs. Johnson to Lady Susan Vernon</p>
<p>Edward Street.</p>
<p>I am grieved, tho' I cannot be astonished, at your rupture with
Mr. De Courcy; he has just informed Mr. Johnson of it by letter. He
leaves London, he says, to-day. Be assured that I partake in all
your feelings, &amp; do not be angry if I say that our intercourse,
even by Letter, must soon be given up. It makes me miserable; but
Mr. Johnson vows that if I persist in the connection, he will
settle in the country for the rest of his life&mdash;&amp; you know
it is impossible to submit to such an extremity while any other
alternative remains.</p>
<p>You have heard of course that the Manwarings are to part, &amp;
I am afraid Mrs. M. will come home to us again; but she is still so
fond of her Husband, &amp; frets so much about him, that perhaps
she may not live long.</p>
<p>Miss Manwaring is just come to Town to be with her Aunt, &amp;
they say that she declares she will have Sir James Martin before
she leaves London again. If I were you, I would certainly get him
myself. I had almost forgot to give you my opinion of Mr. De
Courcy, I am really delighted with him; he is full as handsome, I
think, as Manwaring, &amp; with such an open, good-humoured
countenance that one cannot help loving him at first sight. Mr.
Johnson &amp; he are the greatest friends in the World. Adieu, my
dearest Susan. I wish matters did not go so perversely. That
unlucky visit to Langford! But I dare say you did all for the best,

<p>My dear Alicia</p>
<p>I yeild to the necessity which parts us. Under circumstances you
could not act otherwise. Our friendship cannot be impaired by it,
&amp; in happier times, when your situation is as independent as
mine, it will unite us again in the same Intimacy as ever. For this
I shall impatiently wait; &amp; meanwhile can safely assure you
that I never was more at ease, or better satisfied with myself
&amp; everything about me than at the present hour. Your Husband I
abhor&mdash;Reginald I despise&mdash;&amp; I am secure of never
seeing either again. Have I not reason to rejoice? Manwaring is
more devoted to me than ever; &amp; were he at liberty, I doubt if
I could resist even Matrimony offered by <i>him</i>. This event, if
his wife live with you, it may be in your power to hasten. The
violence of her feelings, which must wear her out, may be easily
kept in irritation. I rely on your friendship for this. I am now
satisfied that I never could have brought myself to marry Reginald;
&amp; am equally determined that Frederica never <i>shall</i>.
To-morrow I shall fetch her from Churchill, &amp; let Maria
Manwaring tremble for the consequence. Frederica shall be Sir
James's wife before she quits my house. <i>She</i> may whimper,
&amp; the Vernons may storm; I regard them not. I am tired of
submitting my will to the Caprices of others; of resigning my own
Judgement in deference to those to whom I owe no Duty, &amp; for
whom I feel no respect. I have given up too much, have been too
easily worked on; but Frederica shall now find the difference.</p>
<p>Adieu, dearest of Friends. May the next Gouty Attack be more
favourable! And may you always regard me as unalterably yours</p>

<h2><a name="axl" id="axl">LETTER 40.</a></h2>
<p>Lady De Courcy to Mrs. Vernon.</p>
<p>Parklands.</p>
<p>My dear Catherine</p>
<p>I have charming news for you, &amp; if I had not sent off my
Letter this morning, you might have been spared the vexation of
knowing of Reginald's being gone to Town, for he is returned,
Reginald is returned, not to ask our consent to his marrying Lady
Susan, but to tell us they are parted forever! He has been only an
hour in the House, &amp; I have not been able to learn particulars,
for he is so very low that I have not the heart to ask questions;
but I hope we shall soon know all. This is the most joyful hour he
has ever given us since the day of his birth. Nothing is wanting
but to have you here, &amp; it is our particular wish &amp;
entreaty that you would come to us as soon as you can. You have
owed us a visit many long weeks. I hope nothing will make it
inconvenient to Mr. Vernon, &amp; pray bring all my Grand-Children;
&amp; your dear Neice is included, of course; I long to see her. It
has been a sad, heavy winter hitherto, without Reginald, &amp;
seeing nobody from Churchill. I never found the season so dreary
before; but this happy meeting will make us young again. Frederica
runs much in my thoughts, &amp; when Reginald has recovered his
usual good spirits (as I trust he soon will), we will try to rob
him of his heart once more, &amp; I am full of hopes of seeing
their hands joined at no great distance.</p>

<h2><a name="axli" id="axli">LETTER 41.</a></h2>
<p>Mrs. Vernon to Lady De Courcy</p>
<p>Churchill.</p>
<p>My dear Madam</p>
<p>Your Letter has surprised me beyond measure! Can it be true that
they are really separated&mdash;&amp; forever? I should be
overjoyed if I dared depend on it, but after all that I have seen,
how can one be secure? And Reginald really with you! My surprise is
the greater because on Wednesday, the very day of his coming to
Parklands, we had a most unexpected &amp; unwelcome visit from Lady
Susan, looking all chearfulness &amp; good-humour, &amp; seeming
more as if she were to marry him when she got to London, than as if
parted from him forever. She staid nearly two hours, was as
affectionate &amp; agreable as ever, &amp; not a syllable, not a
hint, was dropped of any disagreement or coolness between them. I
asked her whether she had seen my Brother since his arrival in
Town&mdash;not, as you may suppose, with any doubt of the fact, but
merely to see how she looked. She immediately answered, without any
embarrassment, that he had been kind enough to call on her on
Monday, but she beleived he had already returned home&mdash;which I
was very far from crediting.</p>
<p>Your kind invitation is accepted by us with pleasure, &amp; on
Thursday next we &amp; our little ones will be with you. Pray
Heaven, Reginald may not be in Town again by that time!</p>
<p>I wish we could bring dear Frederica too, but I am sorry to say
that her Mother's errand hither was to fetch her away; and,
miserable as it made the poor Girl, it was impossible to detain
her. I was thoroughly unwilling to let her go, &amp; so was her
Uncle; &amp; all that could be urged we <i>did</i> urge; but Lady
Susan declared that as she was now about to fix herself in Town for
several Months, she could not be easy if her Daughter were not with
her, for Masters, &amp;c. Her Manner, to be sure, was very kind
&amp; proper, &amp; Mr. Vernon beleives that Frederica will now be
treated with affection. I wish I could think so too!</p>
<p>The poor girl's heart was almost broke at taking leave of us. I
charged her to write to me very often, &amp; to remember that if
she were in any distress we should be always her friends. I took
care to see her alone, that I might say all this, &amp; I hope made
her a little more comfortable. But I shall not be easy till I can
go to Town &amp; judge of her situation myself.</p>
<p>I wish there were a better prospect than now appears of the
Match which the conclusion of your Letter declares your expectation
of. At present it is not very likely.</p>

<h2><a name="axlii" id="axlii">CONCLUSION</a></h2>
<p>This Correspondence, by a meeting between some of the parties,
&amp; a separation between the others, could not, to the great
detriment of the Post office Revenue, be continued longer. Very
little assistance to the State could be derived from the Epistolary
Intercourse of Mrs. Vernon &amp; her neice; for the former soon
perceived, by the style of Frederica's letters, that they were
written under her Mother's inspection, &amp; therefore deferring
all particular inquiry till she could make it personally in Town,
ceased writing minutely or often.</p>
<p>Having learnt enough in the meanwhile from her open-hearted
Brother, of what had passed between him &amp; Lady Susan to sink
the latter lower than ever in her opinion, she was proportionably
more anxious to get Frederica removed from such a Mother, &amp;
placed under her own care; and, tho' with little hope of success,
was resolved to leave nothing unattempted that might offer a chance
of obtaining her Sister-in-law's consent to it. Her anxiety on the
subject made her press for an early visit to London; &amp; Mr.
Vernon, who, as it must already have appeared, lived only to do
whatever he was desired, soon found some accommodating Business to
call him thither. With a heart full of the Matter, Mrs. Vernon
waited on Lady Susan shortly after her arrival in Town, &amp; was
met with such an easy &amp; chearful affection, as made her almost
turn from her with horror. No remembrance of Reginald, no
consciousness of Guilt, gave one look of embarrassment. She was in
excellent spirits, &amp; seemed eager to shew at once, by every
possible attention to her Brother &amp; Sister, her sense of their
kindness, &amp; her pleasure in their society.</p>
<p>Frederica was no more altered than Lady Susan; the same
restrained Manners, the same timid Look in the presence of her
Mother as heretofore, assured her Aunt of her situation's being
uncomfortable, &amp; confirmed her in the plan of altering it. No
unkindness, however, on the part of Lady Susan appeared.
Persecution on the subject of Sir James was entirely at an
end&mdash;his name merely mentioned to say that he was not in
London; &amp; indeed, in all her conversation she was solicitous
only for the welfare &amp; improvement of her Daughter,
acknowledging, in terms of grateful delight, that Frederica was now
growing every day more &amp; more what a Parent could desire.</p>
<p>Mrs. Vernon, surprised &amp; incredulous, knew not what to
suspect, and, without any change in her own views, only feared
greater difficulty in accomplishing them. The first hope of
anything better was derived from Lady Susan's asking her whether
she thought Frederica looked quite as well as she had done at
Churchill, as she must confess herself to have sometimes an anxious
doubt of London's perfectly agreeing with her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Vernon, encouraging the doubt, directly proposed her
Neice's returning with them into the country. Lady Susan was unable
to express her sense of such kindness, yet knew not, from a variety
of reasons, how to part with her Daughter; &amp; as, tho' her own
plans were not yet wholly fixed, she trusted it would ere long be
in her power to take Frederica into the country herself, concluded
by declining entirely to profit by such unexampled attention. Mrs.
Vernon, however, persevered in the offer of it; &amp; tho' Lady
Susan continued to resist, her resistance in the course of a few
days seemed somewhat less formidable.</p>
<p>The lucky alarm of an Influenza decided what might not have been
decided quite so soon. Lady Susan's maternal fears were then too
much awakened for her to think of anything but Frederica's removal
from the risk of infection. Above all Disorders in the World, she
most dreaded the influenza for her Daughter's constitution!
Frederica returned to Churchill with her uncle &amp; aunt; &amp;
three weeks afterwards, Lady Susan announced her being married to
Sir James Martin.</p>
<p>Mrs. Vernon was then convinced of what she had only suspected
before, that she might have spared herself all the trouble of
urging a removal which Lady Susan had doubtless resolved on from
the first. Frederica's visit was nominally for six weeks; but her
Mother, tho' inviting her to return in one or two affectionate
Letters, was very ready to oblige the whole Party by consenting to
a prolongation of her stay, &amp; in the course of two months
ceased to write of her absence, &amp; in the course of two more to
write to her at all.</p>
<p>Frederica was therefore fixed in the family of her Uncle &amp;
Aunt till such time as Reginald De Courcy could be talked,
flattered, &amp; finessed into an affection for her&mdash;which,
allowing leisure for the conquest of his attachment to her Mother,
for his abjuring all future attachments, &amp; detesting the Sex,
might be reasonably looked for in the course of a Twelvemonth.
Three Months might have done it in general, but Reginald's feelings
were no less lasting than lively.</p>
<p>Whether Lady Susan was or was not happy in her second
Choice&mdash;I do not see how it can ever be ascertained&mdash;for
who would take her assurance of it on either side of the question?
The World must judge from Probability; she had nothing against her
but her Husband &amp; her Conscience.</p>
<p>Sir James may seem to have drawn a harder lot than mere Folly
merited. I leave him, therefore, to all the Pity that anybody can
give him. For myself, I confess that <i>I</i> can pity only Miss
Manwaring, who, coming to Town &amp; putting herself to an expense
in Cloathes which impoverished her for two years, on purpose to
secure him, was defrauded of her due by a Woman ten years older
than herself.</p>
