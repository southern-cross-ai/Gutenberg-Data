  <h2><a id="book1"
     name="book1">BOOK I</a></h2>

  <h2><a id="ch101"
     name="ch101">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SINCE you are desirous, my friends, that I should relate to
  you, at length and in order, the things which happened to me during my
  journey to Rome, notwithstanding the pain which it must cost me to throw
  myself back into some of the feelings of that time, I cannot refuse to comply
  with your request. After threescore years spent in this remote province of an
  empire, happy, for the most part, in the protection of enlightened, just, and
  benevolent princes, I remember, far more accurately than things which
  occurred only a few months ago, the minutest particulars of what I saw and
  heard while I sojourned, young and a stranger, among the luxuries and
  cruelties of the capital of the world, as yet imperfectly recovered from the
  effects of the flagitious tyranny of the last of the Flavii.</p>

  <p>My father, as you have heard, came with his legion into this island, and
  married a lady of native blood, some years before the first arrival of
  Agricola. In the wars of that illustrious commander, during the reigns of
  Vespasian and Titus, he had the fortune to find opportunities of
  distinguishing himself; but when his general was recalled, by the jealousy of
  Domitian, he retired from public life, and determined to spend the remainder
  of his days in peace, on the lands which belonged to him in right of his wife
  here in Britain. He laid the foundations of the house in which I have now the
  pleasure of receiving you; and here, in the cultivation of his fields, and in
  the superintendence of my education, he found sufficient employment for an
  active, though no longer an ambitious mind. Early in the reign of Trajan he
  died. Never did either Roman or British dwelling lament a more generous
  master.</p>

  <p>I cannot pretend to regret the accident which immediately afterwards
  separated me from a gentle mother&mdash;never to see her more upon the earth.
  Yet deeply was^the happiness of my returning hour stained by that privation.
  It is the common rule of nature, that our parents should precede us to the
  grave; and it is also her rule, that our grief for them should not be of such
  power as to prevent us from entering, after they are gone, into a zealous
  participation both of the business and the pleasures of life. Yet, in after
  years, the memory of that buried tenderness rises up ever and anon, and wins
  rather than warns us to a deliberate contemplation of our own
  dissolution.</p>

  <p>Towards the end of the winter following the death of my father, there
  arrived letters which engaged anxious consideration. They were from members
  of his family, none of whom either my mother or myself had seen. It was
  explained, especially by Caius Licinius, the lawyer, (who was near of kin to
  our house,) that by the death of a certain Patrician, Cneius Valerius by
  name, I had become legally entitled to a very considerable fortune, to claim
  and take possession of which, demanded my immediate presence in the
  metropolis. My rights, said this jurist, were indeed called in question by
  another branch of the family, but were I on the spot, his professional
  exertions, with whatever interest he or any of his friends could command,
  should be at my service, for the sake of my father and of my name.</p>

  <p>The love of travel had never before been excited in my bosom; but now that
  I knew I was so soon to embark for Italy, the delights which I might there
  hope to experience came crowding upon my imagination. The dark and pine-clad
  banks of my native Anton, said I, shall now be exchanged for that
  golden-waved Tiber, of which so many illustrious poets have sung. Instead of
  moving here among the ill-cemented and motley fabric of an insulated colony,
  and seeing only the sullen submission of barbarians on the one hand, or the
  paltry vanity of provincial deputies on the other, I shall tread the same
  ground with the rulers of the earth, and wear, among native Romans, the gown
  of my ancestors. I shall behold the Forum, which has heard the eloquence of
  Cicero and Hortensius; I shall ascend to the Capitol, where Caesar triumphed;
  I shall wander in the luxurious gardens of Sallust, or breathe the fresh air
  in the fields of Cato: I shall gaze upon the antique majesty of temples and
  palaces, and open my eyes on all that art and nature have been able to heap
  together through eight centuries, for the ornament of the chosen seat of
  wisdom and valour.</p>

  <p>A single trusty slave was selected to accompany me. It was not certainly
  on account of his accomplishments that Boto had been chosen for this duty;
  for although he had lived all his days in the vicinity of the colonists at
  Venta, there was scarcely a person within the bounds of the British Belgae
  that spoke worse Latin. He was, however, a man of natural sagacity,
  possessing shrewd discernment concerning whatever things had fallen under his
  customary observation; and he showed no symptom either of diffidence
  respecting his qualifications for this new office, or of regret at being
  separated from those in whose company many years of gentle servitude had
  glided over his sun-burnt countenance. It was reported to me, that he invited
  several of our rustics to drink with him in one of the out-houses, where his
  exultation knew no limits. He was going to Rome, for his young master very
  well knew he could never get on in such a journey without the helping eye and
  hand of Boto; and he had a brother in Italy already, (he had gone over with a
  distinguished legionary some ten years before,) and from him (for he would of
  course meet with him as soon as our arrival should be known) he would receive
  all requisite information concerning the doings of the great city. The
  usefulness which, he doubted not, I should be constrained to acknowledge in
  his manifold qualifications, would, without all question, entitle him to some
  signal reward&mdash;perhaps nothing less than manumission on his return.</p>

  <p>Two days passed more quickly than any I ever remember to have spent amidst
  a strange mixture of mirth, and sorrow, and noisy preparation.</p>

  <p>Where that single tall naked pine now stands buffeted by the wind, then
  grew a thick grove, of which that relic alone survives. It was there that I
  turned round to gaze once more on the quiet verdure of these paternal fields,
  and our small pastoral stream glistening here and there beneath the shady
  covert of its margin.</p>

  <p>I had at first intended to cross over to Gaul, and traversing that
  province, enter Italy, either by the route of the Alps, in case we could
  procure convenient guides and companions, or by some vessel sailing from
  Marseilles or Forum Julii to Ostium. But the advice of one of my neighbours,
  who had himself been a great traveller, made me alter this plan, and resolve
  to commit myself to the care of an experienced mariner who was just about to
  sail for Italy, by the way of the pillars of Hercules, in a vessel laden
  chiefly with tin; and on reaching the Clausentum, I found this man, with
  several passengers, ready for the voyage.</p>

  <p>For the first three or four days, I was so afflicted by the motion of the
  vessel, that I could bestow little attention on any external object; my eyes
  were so confused and dazzled, that I saw nothing beyond the corner of the
  deck on which I had caused my carpets to be laid; and a few ejaculations to
  Castor and Pollux were all the articulate sounds that I uttered. By degrees,
  however, the weight of my depression began to be alleviated; and at
  intervals, more particularly during the night watches, if I was not
  altogether in possession of myself, I was at least well enough to enjoy a
  sort of giddy delight in watching the billows as they rose and retreated from
  the prow. There were moments, also, in which the behaviour of Boto, under
  this new species of calamity, could furnish me, as it had already done the
  more hardy of my fellow-voyagers, with store of mirth. Near us frequently,
  upon the deck, sat a Captain of the Praetorian Bands, who, more than any
  other of these, displayed a florid complexion and cheerful eye, unalterable
  by the fluctuation of the waters. This Sabinus had served in all the wars of
  Agricola, and accompanied him even in his perilous circumnavigation of the
  islands which lie scattered to the north of Britain. He had also gone back to
  Rome with his commander, not, like him, to extenuate imperial jealousy by the
  affectation of indolence, but to seek for new occupation on some other
  disturbed frontier of the Empire. In Syria and Cappadocia he had spent some
  years; after which, he had attended the Emperor himself through Maesia and
  Illyricum, and all those countries he traversed and re-traversed, during that
  shameful contest in which so many Roman eagles were made the prey of
  barbarous enemies, and which terminated at last in that cowardly treaty, by
  which Domitian granted a diadem to Decebalus, and condescended to place the
  Roman Senate among the tributaries of a Dacian. Our friend had also strutted
  his part in that gorgeous triumph, or rather succession of triumphs, by which
  the defeated and disgraced Prince, on his return from the Ister, mocked the
  eyes and ears of the incredulous and indignant Romans. In a word, he had
  partaken in all kinds of fortune, good and evil, and preserved his
  rubicundity and equanimity unaltered in them all. Having attained to a
  situation of some dignity, he had now been visiting Britain on a special
  message from the new Emperor, and was returning in the hope that no future
  accident of fortune, or princely caprice, would ever again make it necessary
  for him to quit the shows and festivities of the capital.</p>

  <p>This good-natured man sat down beside my suffering peasant, endeavouring
  to withdraw his attention from the pangs of his sickness, by pointing out the
  different boats which came in view as we held on from the Gobaean rocks,
  keeping close to the shore as we went, in order to shun, as well as we could,
  the customary fury of the Aquitanic Ocean. "Behold these fishing-vessels," he
  would cry, "which have undoubtedly been upon the coast of Rutupia for
  oysters, or it may be about the mouth of yonder Ligoris for turbot, and are
  now stretching all their canvass to get home with their booty to Italy.
  Smooth be your winds and fair your passage, oh rare fish!" To which the
  downcast Boto would reply, "Lavish not, oh master, your good wishes upon the
  mute fish, which have been tossed about all their lives, but reserve them
  rather for me (unhappy) who am thus tormented in an unnatural and intolerable
  manner;" or perhaps, "Speak not, I beseech you, of oysters, or of turbot, or
  of any other eatable, for I believe I shall never again feel hungry, so
  grievously are all my internal parts discomposed. Oh, that I had never left
  my native fields, and bartered the repose of my whole body for the vain hope
  of gratification to my eyes!"</p>

  <p>By degrees, however, custom reconciled all of us to the motion of the
  bark, and the weather being calm during the greater part of the voyage, I
  enjoyed, at my leisure, the beauties, both of the sea, and of the shores
  alongst which we glided. From time to time, we put in for water and other
  necessaries, to various sea-ports of the Spanish Peninsula; but our stay was
  never so long at any place as to admit of us losing sight of our vessel. Our
  chief delight, indeed, consisted in the softness and amenity of the moonlight
  nights we spent in sailing along the coasts of Mauritania,&mdash;now the dark
  mountains of the family of Atlas throwing their shadows far into the
  sea&mdash;and anon, its margin glittering with the white towers of Siga, or
  Gilba, or Cartenna, or some other of the rich cities of that old Carthaginian
  region. On such nights it was the custom of all the passengers to be
  congregated together upon the deck, where the silent pleasures of
  contemplation were, from time to time, interrupted by some merry song chanted
  in chorus by the mariners, or perhaps some wild barbarian ditty, consecrated
  by the zeal of Boto to the honour of some ancient indigenous hero of the
  North. Nor did our jovial Praetorian disdain to contribute now and then to
  the amusement of the assembly, by some boisterous war-song, composed,
  perhaps, by some light-hearted young spearman, which our centurion might have
  learned by heart, without any regular exertion, from hearing it sung around
  many a British and Dacian watch-fire.</p>

  <p>Thus we contrived to pass the time in a cheerful manner, till we reached
  the Lilybaean promontory. We tarried there two days to refit some part of our
  rigging, and then stretched boldly across the lower sea, towards the mouth of
  the Tiber. We were becalmed, however, for a whole day and night, after we had
  come within sight of the Pharos of Ostium, where, but for the small boats
  that came out to us with fresh fish and fruit, we should have had some
  difficulty in preserving our patience; for, by this time, our stock of wine
  was run to the last cup, and nothing remained to be eat but some mouldy
  biscuit which had survived two voyages between Italy and Britain. During this
  unwelcome delay, the Praetorian endeavoured to give me as much information as
  he could about the steps necessary to be pursued on my arrival in the city.
  But, to say truth, his experience had lain chiefly among martial expeditions
  and jovial recreations, so that I could easily perceive he was no great
  master of the rules of civil life. From him, however, I was glad to find,
  that the reputation of Licinius was really as great at Rome as it had been
  represented in our province; and, indeed, he treated me with a yet greater
  measure of attention after he was informed of my relationship to that
  celebrated jurist.</p>

  <p>Early in the morning, a light breeze sprung up from the west, and with
  joyful acclamations the sails were once again uplifted. The number of
  mariners on board was insufficient for impelling the heavily laden vessel
  altogether by the force of oars, but now they did not refuse to assist the
  favouring breeze with strenuous and lively exertion. The Praetorian cheered
  and incited them by his merry voice, and even the passengers were not loath
  to assist them in this labour. My slave, among the rest, joined in the toil;
  but his awkwardness soon relieved him from his seat on the bench; a disgrace
  which he would have shared with his master, had I been equally officious.</p>

  <p>Ere long, we could trace with exactness those enormous structures by which
  the munificence of Augustus had guarded and adorned that great avenue of
  nations to the imperial city. Those mountains of marble, projected on either
  side into the deep, surpassed every notion I had formed of the extent to
  which art may carry its rivalry of nature. Their immovable masses were
  garnished here and there with towers and battlements, on which the Praetorian
  pointed out to me the framework of those terrible catapults, and other
  engines of warfare, of which no specimens have ever been seen in Britain.</p>

  <p>No sooner had we stept upon the shore, than we were surrounded by a great
  throng of hard-favoured persons, who pulled us by the cloak, with innumerable
  interrogations and offers of service. Among these, the varieties of form,
  complexion, and accent, were such, that we could not regard them without
  especial wonder; for it appeared as if every tribe and language under heaven
  had sent some representative to this great seaport of Rome. The fair hair and
  blue eye of the Gaul or German, might here be seen close by the tawny skin of
  the Numidian or Getulian slave, or the shining blackness of the Ethiopian
  visage. The Greek merchant was ready, with his Thracian bondsman carrying his
  glittering wares upon his back; the usurer was there, with his arms folded
  closely in his mantle; nor was the Chaldean or Assyrian soothsayer awanting,
  with his air of abstraction and his flowing beard.</p>

  <p>Boto, as if alarmed with the prevailing bustle, and fearful lest some
  untoward accident should separate us, kept close behind me, grasping my gown.
  But our good friend Sabinus did not long leave us in this perplexity; for,
  having hastily engaged the master of a small barge to carry him to Rome, he
  insisted that I should partake of this easy method of conveyance. "We found
  the vessel small but convenient, furnished with a red awning, under which
  cushions and carpets were already stretched out for our repose. The oars were
  soon in motion, and we began to emerge from among the forest of masts with a
  rapidity which astonished me; for the multitude of vessels of all sizes,
  continually crossing and re-crossing, was so great, that at first I expected
  every moment some dangerous accident might occur.</p>

  <p>By degrees, however, such objects failed to keep alive my attention; the
  sleeplessness of the preceding night, and the abundance of an Ostian repast,
  conspiring to lull me into a gentle doze, which continued for I know not what
  space. I awoke, greatly refreshed, and found we had made considerable
  progress; for the continual succession of stately edifices already indicated
  the vicinity of the metropolis. The dark green of the venerable groves,
  amidst which the buildings were, for the most part, embosomed, and the
  livelier beauties of the parterres which here and there intervened between
  these and the river, afforded a soft delight to my eyes, which had so long
  been fatigued with the uniform flash and dazzle of the Mediterranean waves,
  and the roughness of the sea-beaten precipices. The minute and elaborate
  cultivation every where visible, the smoothness of the shorn turf on the
  margin, the graceful foliage of the ancient planes and sycamores,&mdash;but,
  above all, the sublimity of the porticos and arcades, and the air of
  established and inviolable elegance which pervaded the whole region, kept my
  mind in pleasurable wonder.</p>

  <p>Here and there, a gentle winding conducted us through some deep and massy
  shade of oaks and elms; whose branches, stretching far out from either side,
  diffused a sombre and melancholy blackness almost entirely over the face of
  Tiber. Loitering carelessly, or couched supinely, beneath some of these hoary
  branches, we could see, from time to time, the figure of some stately Roman,
  or white-robed lady, with her favourite scroll of parchment in her hand. The
  cool and glassy rippling of the water produced a humming music of stillness
  in the air, which nothing disturbed, save only the regular dash of the oars,
  and, now and then, the deep and strenuous voice of our cautious helmsman.
  Anon would ensue some glimpse of the open champaign, descending with all its
  wealth of golden sheaves to the very brink of the river&mdash;or, perhaps,
  the lively courts of a farmyard stretching along the margin of some tributary
  streamlet&mdash;or some long expanse of level meadow, with herds of
  snow-white heifers. I could not gaze upon the rich and splendid scene without
  reverting, with a strange mixture of emotions, to the image of this my native
  land; its wild forests, shaggy with brushwood and unprofitable coppice,
  through which of old the enormous wild deer stalked undisturbed, except by
  the adder of the grass, or the obscene fly of the thicket; its little patches
  of corn and meadow, laboriously rescued from the domain of the wild beast,
  and rudely fortified against his continual incursions;&mdash;the scattered
  hamlets of this Brigian valley, and my own humble villa&mdash;then humbler
  than it is now. Trees, and temples, and gardens, and meadows, and towns, and
  villages, were, ere long, lost in one uniform sobriety of twilight; and it
  was already quite dark, when the centurion, pointing to the left bank, said,
  "Behold the Gardens of Caesar: beyond, is the Portian Gate, and the street of
  the Rural Lares. In a few moments we shall see the lights of the Sublician
  Bridge, and be in the city." At these words I started up, and gazing forward,
  could penetrate through the mists of evening into the busy glare of a
  thousand streets and lanes, opening upon the river. The old wall was already
  visible; where, after having swept round the region towards the Vatican and
  Janicular Hills, it brings the last of its turrets close down to the Tiber,
  over against the great dock-yards by the Field of Brutus.</p>

  <p>Through a forest of triremes, galleys, and all sorts of craft, we then
  shot on to the bridge&mdash;beneath the centre arch of which our steersman
  conducted us. Beyond, such was the hum of people on the quays, and such the
  star-like profusion of lights reflected in the water, that we doubted not we
  had already reached the chief seat of the bustle of Rome. On, however, we
  still held our course, till the theatre of Marcellus rose like a mountain on
  our right. It was there that we ran our bark into the shore, not far from the
  little bridge&mdash;the third as you ascend the river&mdash;which conducts to
  the Island and the Temple of Aesculapius. While our friend was settling
  matters with the master, and the attendants were bringing out our baggage, I
  stood by myself on the elevated quay. Here a long tier of reflected radiance
  bespoke, it may be, the vicinity of some splendid portico&mdash;of palace, or
  temple, or bath, or theatre; there a broad and steady blaze of burning red,
  indicated the abode of artisans, resolved, as it seemed, on carrying their
  toil into the bosom of the night. Between&mdash;some speck of lustre
  betrayed, perhaps, the lamp of the solitary student, or the sober social hour
  of some peaceful family, assembled around the hearth of their modest lares.
  Behold me then, said I, in the capital of the globe; but were I to be
  swallowed up this moment in the waves of Tiber, not one of all these lights
  would be dimmed.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch102"
     name="ch102">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BEING told that my relation had his residence at no great
  distance, the friendly Sabinus insisted upon escorting me thither in safety.
  We walked, therefore, along two or three proud streets, which brought us near
  to the Pantheon of Agrippa, and there the house was easily pointed out to us;
  its porch decorated with recent palm-branches, which the Centurion said must
  have been placed there by the joyful hands of some fortunate client. Here
  having thanked this kind person, and left honest Boto among the crowd of
  slaves in the vestibule, I was speedily conducted into the presence of the
  Patrician.</p>

  <p>I found him in a small upper chamber, lighted by a single silver lamp
  suspended from the roof, enjoying, as it appeared, repose and relaxation
  after the exertions of the day. He was reclining when I entered; and although
  supper was long over, some fruits and other trifling things still remained on
  the board. At table with him there was no one present, excepting a Greek of
  solemn aspect, whom he introduced to me as the superintendent of his son's
  education, and Sextus himself, a modest and ingenuous youth, who sat at the
  lower extremity of his father's couch. He was indeed a very mild and amiable
  young man, and I had more pleasure, after a space, in surveying his features,
  than the more marked lineaments of the other two. At first, however, nothing
  riveted my attention so much as the energetic physiognomy of the Senator. The
  forepart of his head was already quite bald, although the darkness of the
  short curls behind testified that age was not the cause of this deformity.
  His eyes were black and rapid, and his eyebrows vibrated in a remarkable
  manner, not only when he spoke, but even when he was silent; indicating, as
  it appeared, by their transitions, every new train of thought and imagination
  within his mind. His style of conversation was quick and fervid, and his
  gestures vehement as he spake; it being apparent, that, from restlessness and
  vanity of disposition, he was continually exercising a needless measure of
  mental activity and anxiety. Not satisfied with his own sufficient richness
  of ideas, no thought could be expressed which he did not immediately seize
  upon, and explain, even to him by whom it had been first suggested, with much
  fluency and earnestness of illustration. On the other hand, the guest, who
  wore a long beard reaching to his girdle, preserved in all things an uncommon
  demureness of manner, restraining every salient movement of his mind, and
  watching, with the gravity of a Numa, the glancing eyes and sharp features of
  his patron. A roll of yellow parchment graced his left hand, but the other
  was employed in selecting from the table such articles as were most agreeable
  to his palate. Licinius, although meagre in person, and at that time parched
  with declamation, seemed to live in such a state of intellectual excitement,
  that he thought little either of eating or drinking; therefore, the Athenian,
  resigning, for the most part, his share of the conversation, amused himself,
  in exchange, with the more trivial gratifications abandoned to him by his
  host. Nor, if one might draw any conclusion from his complexion and figure,
  was this the first occasion on which Xerophrastes had exercised that species
  of humility.</p>

  <p>When Licinius had inquired of me concerning my native place, and also
  given a few words to the affairs which had brought me to the city, his
  conversation was naturally directed to subjects more new to me, if not more
  interesting to him. "You would observe," said he, "the palm branches at my
  door. They were won to-day by a five hours' harangue before the Centumviri.
  It is only in contests such as these that men of my order have now any
  opportunity to exercise themselves, and preserve some remembrance of those
  ancient worthies and great public characters that once adorned the state. To
  these things, therefore, young kinsman, I entirely devote myself; nor aim,
  like other citizens of rank, at passing the day in diversion, and ending it
  with luxuries. At supper my table is furnished with moderate fare, while in
  other houses I know not how many roasted boars and pompous sturgeons have
  been regaling with the rich perfume of their sauces and stuffing, guests who
  love the meat more than the man who gives it. This learned person knows how
  laborious is my course of life, and what an impatient crowd awaits my
  appearance every morning. His pupil will, I hope, tread in the same steps,
  and afford to a future generation the image of the former Licinius."</p>

  <p>With these, and the like discourses, he occupied our ears till it was time
  to retire; and then intimated that he had allotted to me an apartment which
  he expected I would continually occupy during my residence in the city. But
  being informed that I had a British slave with me, he insisted on having this
  man sent for, that he might see him, as he expressed it, before the genuine
  unsophisticated barbarian had been corrupted by keeping company with the
  cunning menials of the metropolis. Whereupon, it was commanded that Boto
  should come up, and he was forthwith ushered in by a certain leering varlet,
  with rings in his ears, whose face resembled some comic mask in the habitual
  archness of its malicious and inquisitive look.</p>

  <p>Not few were the bows and scrapes with which my Briton entered these
  penetralia; nor was the astonishment inconsiderable with which the orator
  regarded Boto. "So, friend," said Licinius,&mdash;"and you have ventured to
  come to Rome, without so much as shaving your beard?" But the merry and
  good-natured tone in which these words were uttered, having somewhat
  reassured the bashful rustic, he gave a sly side-look towards the
  philosopher, (who, I think, had never once glanced at him,) and replied to
  Licinius, "Pardon me, master, for coming thus into your presence; but I knew
  not, till Dromo told me, that beards were worn in Rome only by goats and the
  wisest of mankind." The words of the barbarian amused the orator&mdash;but,
  turning round to his own slave, "Ah! Dromo," said he, "do I already recognize
  the effects of your teaching?&mdash;beware the whip, corrupt not this good
  Briton, at your peril." He then asked of Boto various questions concerning
  his recent voyage; to all of which he made answers after his own fashion,
  sufficiently sagacious. Great contempt, however, was depicted on the face of
  the silent stoic during this conversation; which he, no doubt, looked upon as
  a very unworthy condescension on the part of Licinius; till at last, having,
  in a leisurely manner, poured out the last of the flagon, Xerophrastes arose
  from his couch and departed. As he withdrew, he unfortunately struck his knee
  on the corner of the table, which elicited from his stubborn features a
  sudden contortion. This, however, he immediately smoothed of, twisting his
  involuntary stoop into an obeisance to the Senator.</p>

  <p>Young Sextus conducted me to my chamber; and we conversed together with
  easy juvenile confidence for some time before he left me.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch103"
     name="ch103">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MY sleep was sound and sweet; nevertheless, when the morning
  began to dawn, I was awakened by its first glimmerings, and found that my
  thoughts became at once too busy to admit of a return to slumber. I therefore
  arose, and went to walk in an open gallery, with which my chamber was
  connected. This gallery commanded a prospect of a great part of the city,
  which at that hour appeared no less tranquil than stately, nothing being in
  motion except a few small boats gliding here and there upon the river.
  Neither as yet had any smoke begun to darken the atmosphere; so that all
  things were seen in a serene and steady light, the shadows falling broadly
  westward over streets and squares but pillars, and obelisks, and arches,
  rising up every where with unsullied magnificence into the bright air of the
  morning. The numerous poplars and other lofty trees of the gardens, also,
  seemed to be rejoicing in the hour of dew and silence; so fresh and cheerful
  was the intermixture of their branches among the piles of white and yellow
  marble. Near at hand, over the groves of the Philoclean Mansion, I could see
  the dome of the Pantheon, all burnished with living gold, and the proud
  colonnades of the Flaminian Circus, loaded with armies of brazen statues.
  Between these and the river, the theatres of Pompey and Marcellus, and I know
  not how many temples, were visible. Across a more crowded region, to the
  westward, my eye ascended to the cliffs and towers of the Capitol; while,
  still farther removed from me, (although less elevated in natural situation,)
  the gorgeous mansion of the Emperor was seen, lifted up, like some new and
  separate city, upon its enormous fabric of arcades. Behind me, the Flavian
  Amphitheatre, the newest and the most majestic of all Roman edifices,
  detained the eye for a space from all that lay beyond it&mdash;the splendid
  mass of the Esquiline- and those innumerable aqueducts which lie stretched
  out, arch after arch, and pillar after pillar, across the surrounding
  plain.</p>

  <p>As I stood upon a projecting balcony, I heard some person stepping softly
  along the floor, and, being screened by some pillars, looked back into the
  gallery without subjecting myself to observation in return. The noise, I
  found, was occasioned by one of the slaves of Licinius, (the same I had
  remarked over night) who had an air of anxious vigilance on this occasion,
  looking about from side to side as if afraid of being detected in some
  impropriety. I heard him tap at one of the apartments adjoining my own, and
  young Sextus, opening the door, eagerly asked, "Well, Dromo, good Dromo, what
  news?&mdash;Have you seen or heard any thing of her?&mdash;Speak low, I
  beseech you, and remember that my preceptor is near." "Which preceptor?"
  replied Dromo; "count me your best, and I will teach you how to manage all
  besides."&mdash;"Hush!" whispered the young man; "he may be astir with these
  eternal parchments."&mdash;"Be easy," returned the slave; "I have found out
  facts which will serve to bridle that tongue at any time."&mdash;"Dromo,"
  said Sextus, "have a care; remember the thong of sleek leather which hangs at
  the foot of the stair-case; and many is the time I have saved you from it;
  for which you may, perhaps, have to thank the beauty of her who has rendered
  you necessary to me, as much as my own good nature. But no more idle words at
  present&mdash;what have you to tell me?"</p>

  <p>"I have just been down," answered he, "to the herb-market. I had made my
  bargain, and was coming away, when I met one of old Capito's men, driving an
  ass laden with articles from the country. So I asked if he was carrying a
  present to his master's brother. He said he had brought nothing for Lucius
  but a letter; and that he believed its purport was to invite the two young
  ladies, to come out to-day and enjoy the beauty of the season. I no sooner
  got this information, than I ran hither as swiftly as my legs would carry me.
  You can easily go out, as if by chance, to pay your respects to the
  Patrician."</p>

  <p>"Ah, Sempronia!" sighed Sextus, "shall I approach you at last?&mdash;What
  will she think when she sees me there?&mdash;Oh, how will she speak to
  me?"</p>

  <p>While he was uttering these words, Dromo suddenly started, and came
  peeping on tiptoe towards the place where I stood. I stepped from behind my
  pillar, and said to the astonished youth, "Fear not, Sextus, that I shall
  intermeddle with your secrets, or make any use of what I have accidentally
  overheard. But I wish you would satisfy my curiosity, and inform me who is
  this lady, and what may be the meaning of all this concealment?"</p>

  <p>Here Dromo, perceiving that his young master was a good deal confused,
  came forward and said, "From observing your looks last night, when I was
  making a handle of yon barbarian to torture our friend of the porch, I think
  you are a good-natured person, who would not willingly bring any of us into
  trouble. The truth is, that Licinius wishes my young master here to marry a
  certain lady, who has already had wet eyes over the ashes of a first husband;
  but who is of noble birth, and very rich. Now Sextus, being only eighteen,
  does not like this great lady so well as she likes him; and has, in fact,
  lost his heart elsewhere."&mdash;"Dromo," answered I, taking young Sextus by
  the hand as I spoke, "this is a pretty common sort of story; but I shall take
  no side till I have seen both of the ladies; and the sooner your ingenuity
  can bring that about, the more shall I be beholden to you."&mdash;"We shall
  try," replied the slave, observing that I had overcome the reluctance of the
  lover; "but in the meantime I observe that the clients are beginning to
  assemble in the porch, to await the forthcoming of Licinius. Go, therefore,
  and get some breakfast, for, by and by, you will both be expected to
  accompany the Senator to the Forum, to hear him plead; which, between
  ourselves, will be a six hours' job for you, unless you manage matters
  dexterously."</p>

  <p>This hint produced a visible effect on Sextus; but we went down together
  immediately to an apartment, where some bread and grapes were prepared for
  us; and there, with much ingenuousness, he opened his heart to me. But what
  surprised me most of all, was to hear, that although he had been enamoured of
  Sempronia for several months, and was well acquainted with several of her
  relations, he had never yet seen her, except at certain places of public
  resort, nor enjoyed any opportunity of making known his passion.</p>

  <p>While I was expressing my astonishment at this circumstance, we were
  interrupted by Xerophrastes, who came to inform us that Licinius, having
  already descended into the hall, was about to issue forth, and desirous of my
  company, if no other occupation detained me. We accordingly followed the
  philosopher, and found his patron where he had indicated, pacing to and fro,
  in the highest state of excitation, like a generous steed about to scour the
  field of battle. The waxen effigies of his ancestors stood at one end of the
  hall, some of them defaced with age; and upon these he frequently fixed his
  ardent eyes. Seeing me enter, he immediately cried out, "Come hither, young
  friend, and I shall presently conduct you to a scene worthy, above all
  others, of the curiosity of a stranger."</p>

  <p>With this, arranging his gown, and putting himself into a dignified
  attitude, he ordered the porter, who stood chained by the door, to throw wide
  its massy valves; which being done, the litigants and consulters, who were
  without, received the orator with acclamations, and surrounded him on all
  sides. Some of the poorer ones, I observed kissing the hem of his garment,
  and dodging wistfully at his elbows, without ever attracting a word or look
  from him; while those of a higher class came forward more familiarly, seeking
  to impress particular circumstances upon his memory, and paying him
  compliments on the appearance he had made the day before in the Centum viral
  Court. Encircled by this motley group, he walked towards the great Forum,
  followed at a little distance by Sextus, the preceptor, myself, and some
  freedmen of his household. In moving on, we passed, by accident, the door of
  another great pleader, by name Bruttianus, who stood there attended in a
  similar manner. When he perceived Licinius, this man took from his door-post
  a green palm-branch, and waved it towards us in a vaunting manner; but our
  friend, saluting him courteously, cried out, with his sharp and cutting
  voice, ""We shall try it again." Whereon Xerophrastes, immediately stepping
  up to his patron, began thus, "How this vainglorious person exposes
  himself!&mdash;he is certainly a weak man; and his tones, by Hermes, are more
  detestable than those of an African fowl."&mdash;At which words, Sextus
  tipped me the wink; but I did not observe that Licinius was at all displeased
  with them. Yet, soon after, Bruttianus having overtaken us, the processions
  were joined, and the two pleaders walked the rest of the way together in a
  loving manner, exchanging complimentary speeches; to which Xerophrastes
  listened with edifying gravity of visage.</p>

  <p>At length we entered that venerable space, every yard of whose surface is
  consecrated to the peculiar memory of some great incident in the history of
  Rome. Young Sextus allowed me to contemplate for some time, with silent
  wonder, the memorable objects which conspired to the decoration of this
  remarkable place; but after the first gaze of astonishment was satisfied,
  proceeded to point out, in order, the names and uses of the principal
  structures which rose on every side over its porticos&mdash;above all, of its
  sublime temples&mdash;into whose cool and shady recesses the eye could here
  and there penetrate through the open valves. Nor did the ancient rostrum from
  which Tully had declaimed, escape our observation&mdash;nor within its
  guarding rail of silver, the rising shoots of the old mysterious fig-tree of
  Romulus&mdash;nor the rich tesselated pavement which covered the spot that
  had once yawned an abyss before the steady eye of Curtius&mdash;nor the
  resplendent Milliary pillar which marked the centre of the place. In a word,
  had the gathering crowds permitted, I could have willingly spent many hours
  in listening to the explanation of such magnificent objects; but these, and
  the elevated voice of Licinius, who was just beginning his harangue, soon
  compelled me to attend to things of another description.</p>

  <p>Within one of the proud ranges of arcade, on the side nearest to the
  Capitoline stairs, a majestic Patrician had already taken his seat on an
  elevated tribunal&mdash;his assessors being arranged on a lower bench by his
  side, and the orators and clients congregated beneath. When I heard the clear
  and harmonious periods of my kinsman; when I observed with what apparent
  simplicity he laid his foundations in a few plain facts and propositions;
  with what admirable art he upreared from these a superstructure of
  conclusions, equally easy as unexpected; when he had conducted us to the end
  of his argument, and closed with a burst of passionate eloquence, in which he
  seemed to leave even himself behind him, I could not but feel as if I had now
  for the first time contemplated the practised strength of intellect. Yet I
  have lived to discover that the talent which so greatly excited my wonder is
  often possessed from nature, or acquired through practice, in a measure which
  at that time would have afforded me scarcely inferior delight, by men of no
  extraordinary rank.</p>

  <p>The keen and lively gestures of the fervid Licinius, whose soul seemed to
  speak out of every finger he moved, and who appeared to be altogether
  immersed in the cause he pleaded, were succeeded by the solemn and somewhat
  pompous stateliness of Bruttianus, who made a brief pause between every two
  sentences, as if he were apprehensive that the mind of the judge could not
  keep pace with the stream of his illustrations, and looked round ever and
  anon upon the spectators with a placid and assured smile, rather, as it
  seemed to me, to signify his approbation of their taste in applauding him,
  than his own pleasure in their applauses. Nevertheless, he also was a
  splendid speaker, and his affectation displeased the more, because it was
  evidently unworthy of his understanding. While he was speaking, I observed
  that the Stoic preceptor was frequently shifting his place among the crowd,
  and muttering every where expressions of high contempt. But this did not
  disgust me so much as the fixed attitude of ecstasy in which he listened to
  the discourse of his own patron, and the pretended involuntary exclamations
  of his delight. "Oh, admirable cadence!" he would say, "I feel as if I were
  draining a honey-comb. Oh, harmonious man, where have I, or any other person
  here, sucked in such sweetness!" These absurd phrases, however, were caught
  up forthwith, and repeated by the numerous young men who hung upon the skirts
  of the orator, and seemed, indeed, to be drinking in nectar from the speech,
  if one might judge from their countenances. From their taking notes in their
  tablets from time to time, and from the knowing looks they assumed at the
  commencement of every new chain of argument, I guessed that these might be
  embryo jurisconsults, preparing themselves by their attendance for future
  exertions of the same species; and, indeed, when I listened to their
  conversation at the close of every speech, I thought I could perceive in
  their tones and accents, studied mimicry of the natural peculiarities of
  Licinius, Bruttianus, and the other orators. Altogether, the scene was as
  full of amusement as of novelty, and I could willingly have remained to the
  end of the discussion. But my eyes chanced to fall upon young Sextus, and I
  could not but see that his mind was occupied in matters remote from the
  business of the Forum. He stood with his arms folded in his gown, and his
  eyes fixed upon the ground, only lifting them up from time to time with an
  impatient air towards a side entrance, or to observe by the shadows on the
  porticos what progress the sun was making.</p>

  <p>Perceiving, at length, that Xerophrastes had his back turned to us, and
  that his father was engaged with his tablets, he plucked me by the sleeve. I
  understood his meaning, and followed him quickly through the crowd; nor did
  we look back till we had left the noise of the Forensic assembly entirely
  behind us. "I am depriving you," he said, "of no great gratification, for
  that old creature is, indeed, possessed of much natural shrewdness, but he is
  bitter from observing that his reputation is rather eclipsed by younger
  people, and looks like some worn-out and discarded cat, grinning from the top
  of the wall at the dalliance of some sleeker rival. You could find no delight
  in the angry sneerings of such an envious person; and his age would prevent
  you, at the same time, from willingly giving way to contemptuous emotions. I
  will be your guide to the villa. But if any questions be asked on our return,
  you can say I was anxious to show you something of the other regions of the
  city."</p>

  <p>He hurried me through noble streets, and past innumerable edifices, before
  each of which I would gladly have paused. Nevertheless, seeing him wrapped up
  in anxious thoughts, I did not oppose myself to his inclinations; and ere
  long, having passed the Hill of Gardens, I found that we had gained the
  eastern limit of the city.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch104"
     name="ch104">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A SHARP walk of about an hour and a half on the Salarean
  Way, brought us within sight of the Suburban of Capito.</p>

  <p>A lofty wall protected the fields of this retirement from the intrusive
  eyes of passengers. We entered by a small side-door, and found ourselves, as
  if by some magical delusion, transported from the glare of a Roman highway,
  into the depth and silence of some primeval forest. No nicely trimmed path
  conducted our feet. Every thing had at least the appearance of being left as
  nature had formed it. The fern rustled beneath us as we moved; the ivy was
  seen spreading its careless tresses from tree to tree; the fawn bounded from
  the thicket. By degrees, however, the gloom lessened, till at length, over an
  open space of lawn, we perceived the porch of entrance, and a long line of
  colonnade. We passed under the porch, and across a paved court where a
  fountain was playing, into the great hall, which commanded all the other side
  of the place&mdash;a noble prospect of elaborate gardens gradually rising
  into shady hills, and lost in a distance of impenetrable wood.</p>

  <p>Here a freedman attended us, who informed us that Capito had retired into
  a sequestered part of the grounds with some friends from the city; but that
  if we chose we could easily join him there. We assented, and, following his
  guidance, ere long traversed no narrow space of luxuriant cultivation. From
  one perfumed terrace we descended to another; till, having reached a certain
  green and mossy walk, darkened by a natural arching of vines and mulberries,
  the freedman pointed to a statue at the farther end, and told us it stood
  over against the entrance of his master's summer-house. When we reached the
  statue, however, we could perceive no building. The shaded avenue terminated
  in face of a precipitous rock, from which there fell a small stream that was
  received in a massive basin, where the waters foamed into spray without
  transgressing the margin. A thousand delicious plants and far-sought flowers
  clustered around the base of the rock and the brink of the fountain, and the
  humming of innumerable bees mingled with the whispers of the stream. We stood
  for a moment uncertain whether we should move on or retire, when we heard one
  calling to us from beyond; and passing to the other side of the basin,
  descried, between the rock and the falling water, a low entrance into what
  seemed to be a natural cave or grotto. We stooped, and found ourselves within
  one of the most luxurious retirements ever haunted by the foot of Dryad. A
  sparry roof hung like a canopy of gems and crystals over a group of
  sculptured Nymphs and Fawns, which were placed on a rustic pedestal within a
  circular bath shaped out of the living stone. Around the edge of the waveless
  waters that slumbered in this green recess, were spread carpets rich with the
  dyes of Tyrian art, whereon Capito was reposing with his friends. He received
  Sextus with kindness, and me with politeness, introducing us both to his
  companions, who were three in number&mdash;all of them, like himself,
  advanced in years, and two of them wearing long beards, though their
  demeanour was destitute of any thing like the affected stateliness of our
  friend Xerophrastes. These two, as our host informed us, were Greeks and
  Rhetoricians&mdash;the third, a Patrician of the house of the Pontii,
  devoted, like himself, to the pursuits of philosophy and the pleasures of a
  literary retirement.</p>

  <p>They were engaged, when we joined them, in a conversation which had sprung
  from the perusal of some new metaphysical treatise. One of the Greeks, the
  more serene-looking of the pair, was defending its doctrines with earnestness
  of manner, although in a low and measured cadence of voice; the other
  espoused the opposite side, with quickness of utterance and severe animation
  of look; while the two lordly Romans seemed to be contenting themselves, for
  the most part, with listening, although it was not difficult to perceive from
  their countenances, that the one sided in opinion with the Stoic, and Capito
  himself with the Epicurean.</p>

  <p>They all arose presently, and proceeded to walk together, without
  interrupting the conversation, along the same shaded avenue which Sextus and
  myself had already traversed. He and I moved along with them, but a little in
  their rear&mdash;my companion being still too much abstracted to bestow his
  attention on what they were saying; while I myself, being but little an adept
  in such mysteries, amused myself rather with the exterior and manners of the
  men, than with the merits of the opinions they were severally defending. The
  Greeks were attired in the graceful costume of their country, which was worn,
  however, far more gracefully by the Epicurean than his brother,&mdash;the
  materials of his robe being delicate, and its folds arranged with studied
  elegance, whereas the coarse garment of the Stoic had apparently engaged less
  attention. Nevertheless, there was a more marked difference between the
  attire of Capito and that of Pontius Mamurra; for the former was arrayed in a
  tunic of the whitest cloth, beneath which appeared fine linen rollers,
  swathing his thighs and legs, to protect them, as I supposed, from the heat
  and the insects, and a pair of slippers, of dark violet-coloured cloth,
  embroidered with silver flowers; while the other held his arms folded in the
  drapery of an old but genuine toga, which left his yet strong and sinewy
  nether limbs exposed to the weather, all except what was covered by his tall
  black sandals and their senatorian crescents.</p>

  <p>As we passed on, our host from time to time directed the attention of his
  visitors, more particularly of the two Greeks, to the statues of bronze and
  marble, which were placed at convenient intervals along the terraces of his
  garden. The symmetry of these figures, and the graceful simplicity of their
  attitudes, inspired me with I know not what of calm and soothing pleasure
  such as I had never before tasted, so that I thought I could have lingered
  for ever amidst these haunts of philosophic luxury. The images were, for the
  most part, portraits of illustrious men&mdash;Greeks, Romans&mdash;sages and
  heroes; but beautiful female forms were not wanting, nor majestic
  representations of gods and demi-gods, and all the ethereal imaginations of
  the Grecian poets. Seeing the name of Jupiter inscribed upon one of the
  pedestals, I paused for a moment to contemplate the glorious personification
  of might and wisdom, depositing, at the same time, a handful of roses at the
  feet of the statue&mdash;upon which I could observe that my behaviour
  furnished some mirth to the Epicurean Demochares; while, on the contrary,
  Euphranor, the disciple of the Porch, approved of what I did, and rebuked his
  companion for saying any thing that might even by possibility disturb the
  natural piety of an innocent youth. But the Roman Stoic stood by with a smile
  of stately scorn; and utter indifference was painted on the countenance of
  Capito. At another time, Sextus having staid behind to examine the beauties
  of a certain statue of Diana, which represented the goddess stretched out in
  careless slumber on the turf, with a slender grayhound at her feet, the
  Epicurean began to rally me on having a taste inferior to that of my friend,
  whose devotion, he said, could not be blamed, being paid to an exquisite
  imitation of what the great Nature of things had decreed should ever be the
  most agreeable of all objects in the eyes of a person of his
  age.&mdash;"Whereas you," continued he, "appear to be more occupied with
  deep-hung eye- brows, ambrosial beards, and fantastic thunderbolts, and the
  other exuberances of Homeric imagination."</p>

  <p>To this reproach I made no reply, but Capito immediately began to recite
  some verses of a Hymn of Calimachus, in which both the Greeks joined him; nor
  could any thing be more delightful than the harmonious numbers. A sudden
  exclamation of my friend, however, interrupted them, and Capito, looking up a
  long straight pathway, said, "Come, Valerius, we shall see whether you or
  Sextus is the more gallant to living beauties, for here come my nieces. I
  assure you, I know not of which of them I am the more proud; but Sempronia
  has more of the Diana about her, so it is probable she may find a ready slave
  in our Sextus."</p>

  <p>We advanced, and the uncle, having tenderly saluted them, soon presented
  us to their notice. Sextus blushed deeply when he found himself introduced to
  Sempronia, while in her smile, although she looked at him as if to say she
  had never seen him before, I thought I could detect a certain half-suppressed
  something of half-disdainful archness&mdash;the colour in her cheeks, at the
  same time, being not entirely unmoved. She was, indeed, a very lovely girl,
  and in looking on her light dancing play of features, I could easily
  sympathize with the young raptures of my friend. Her dress was such as to set
  off her charms to the utmost advantage, for the bright green of her Byssine
  robe, although it would have been a severe trial to any ordinary complexion,
  served only to heighten the delicious brilliancy of hers. A veil, of the same
  substance and colour, richly embroidered with flowers of silver tissue, fell
  in flowing drapery well-nigh to her knees. Her hair was almost entirely
  concealed by this part of her dress, but a single braid of the brightest
  nut-brown was visible low down on her polished forehead. Her eyes were black
  as jet, and full of a nymph-like vivacity.</p>

  <p>The other, Athanasia, was not a dazzling beauty. Taller than her cousin,
  and darker-haired, but with eyes rather light than otherwise, of a clear,
  somewhat melancholy gray&mdash;with a complexion paler than is usual in
  Italy, a demeanour hovering between cheerfulness and innocent gravity, and
  attired with a vestal simplicity in the old Roman tunic, and cloak of white
  cloth&mdash;it is possible that most men might have regarded her less than
  the other. A single star of diamonds, planted high up among her black hair,
  was the only ornament she wore.</p>

  <p>At the request of the younger lady, we all returned to the grotto, in the
  neighbourhood of which, as I have already mentioned, our tasteful host had
  placed the rarest of his exotic plants, some of which Sempronia was now
  desirous of inspecting. As we paced again slowly over those smooth-shaven
  alleys of turf, and between those rows of yews and box, clipped into regular
  shapes, which abounded in this more artificial region, the conversation,
  which the appearance of the cousins had disturbed, was resumed; although, as
  out of regard to their presence, the voices of the disputants preserved a
  lower and milder tone than before. I must confess, however, that mild as was
  the manner of the discourse, I could not help being somewhat astonished, that
  a polite Roman could permit such topics to be discussed in the hearing of
  females; above all, that he did not interpose to prevent Demochares from
  throwing out so many sarcastic reflections concerning the deities whose
  statues decorated the garden. A beautiful Mercury, in particular, which we
  all paused to admire, elicited many observations, that I could easily see
  were far from being agreeable to the fair cousins. But greatest of all was my
  wonder at the behaviour of Capito himself, who, after we had again entered
  that delightful grotto, turned himself to me as if peculiarly, and began a
  deliberate and ingenious piece of declamation concerning the tenets of his
  favourite philosophy;&mdash;such as the fortuitous concourse of atoms, the
  transitory and fluctuating nature of all things, and the necessity of
  snatching present enjoyments, as nothing permanent can be discovered whereon
  to repose the mind. With great elegance, indeed, did he enlarge on these
  golden theories, nor did he fail to intersperse his discourse with many
  exquisite verses from Lucretius and other poetical followers of his sect.
  Such, however, was the earnestness of his declamation, that I could not help
  believing him to be quite sincere to what he said, and asked him, not without
  anxiety, whether he had all his life been an Epicurean, or whether it was
  only of late that he had espoused that discipline.</p>

  <p>"Valerius," said he, "the question is not discreditable to your tender age
  and provincial education. To be born wise, Fate or Heaven has denied to the
  human race. It is their privilege to win wisdom for themselves; the fault is
  their own, if they do not die wise. When the stripling enters upon the
  theatre of the world, bright hopes are around him, and he moves onward in the
  buoyancy of conscious power. The pride of young existence is the essence and
  extract of all his innumerable sensations. Rejoicing in the feeling of the
  real might that is, it is his delight to think&mdash;to dream&mdash;of might
  existing and exerted as for ever. New to the material, but still more to the
  moral world, he believes in the stability of all things whose transitory
  nature has not been exhibited before him. New to the tricks of mankind, he
  believes that to be said truly, which, why it should be said falsely, he is
  unable to conjecture. For him, superstition has equal potency to darken the
  past, and illuminate the future. At that early period, when ignorance is of
  itself sufficient to produce a certain happiness, the ambition is too high to
  admit such doctrines as I have no shame in avowing. But time moves on, and
  every hour some tender plant is crushed beneath his tread. The spirit clings
  long to its delusions. The promise that is destroyed to-day springs into life
  to-morrow in some new shape; and Hope, like some warring deity of your poets,
  bleeds and sickens only to revive again. But disappointment at length gathers
  to itself the vigour of an enduring form. The horizon becomes colder around
  us&mdash;the soul waxes faint and more faint within. It is then that man
  begins to recognize the true state, not of his own nature alone, but of all
  things that surround him that having tasted much of evil, he is taught to
  feel the value of good and weaning himself from vainglorious dreams, learns
  the great lesson of wisdom, to enjoy the moments as they pass&mdash;to snatch
  some solid pleasure, at least, amidst a world of vision and imagination; so,
  in a word, as the poet has expressed it, he may not have reason to complain
  in the hour of death that he has never lived.</p>

  <p>"In me," he continued, "you behold one that has gone through the
  experience necessary to produce an entire acquiescence in these doctrines. I
  am one of those, Valerius, who have resolved to concentrate, after this
  fashion, the whole of my dreams upon the hour that is. There are not wanting,
  indeed, here and elsewhere, persons who profess the same theories, only in
  the view of finding excuse and shelter for the practice of vice. But till it
  be proved that the practice of vice is the best means of enjoyment, in vain
  shall it be asserted that our doctrine is essentially adverse to virtue. The
  mistakes or the misdeeds of individuals must be estimated for nothing; for
  where is the doctrine that may not be shown to have been defended by impure
  livers? The founder of our sect is acknowledged, by its most virulent
  enemies, to have been the most blameless of men, and they, I must take leave
  to believe, can never be sincere friends of virtue, who doubt, that he who is
  a true worshipper of pleasure, may also be the worshipper of virtue."</p>

  <p>There was a certain something, as I thought, more like suppressed
  melancholy than genuine hilarity, in the expression of the old man's face, as
  well as in the tone of his voice, while he gave utterance to these
  sentiments; nor did any of those present appear desirous of protracting the
  argument; although I did not imagine from their looks that any of them had
  altered their opinion. What, however, I could not help remarking in a
  particular manner, was the gentle regret painted in the countenance of the
  elder niece, while Capito was speaking. The maiden sat over against him all
  the while, her cheek supported on her left hand, with an expression of tender
  affection. From time to time, indeed, she cast her eye upward with a calm
  smile, but immediately resumed her attitude of pensive abstraction. Her uncle
  took her hand in his when he had done speaking, and kissed it gently, as if
  to apologize for having said any thing disagreeable to her. She smiled again
  upon the sceptic, and walked by herself, (for I could not help following her
  with my eye,) down into a dark walk of pines that branched off at the right
  hand from the entrance into the grotto. There I saw her stoop and pluck a
  pale flower. This she placed in her bosom, and then rejoined us with a more
  cheerful aspect; after which, we all walked towards the villa. Nor did it
  escape my notice, that, although Sempronia appeared willing to avoid Sextus
  as we went, it always happened, by some accident or other, that he was nearer
  to her than any other person of the company.</p>

  <p>They were both at a little distance behind the rest of the party, when
  Euphranor addressed himself to me, saying, "Is not this youth, your
  companion, the same that is under the guidance of a certain
  Xerophrastes?"&mdash;"The same," said I, "and a wary, sage-looking Athenian
  is his tutor. I believe he also is of the Porch."&mdash;"No doubt,"
  interrupted Demochares; "he has a beard that Zeno might have been proud of,
  and walks as if he conceived himself to be the chief pillar of the Porch, if
  not the Porch itself." "Who shall prevent Demochares from having his jest?"
  replied Euphranor. "The man is by birth a Thessalian, and his gutturals still
  remind one strongly of his native hills."&mdash;I would gladly have heard
  more of it, but he was interrupted by the nearer approach of the rest.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch105"
     name="ch105">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BEFORE the hour of taking the bath, we exercised ourselves
  for some time in the tennis-court, where I could not but admire, especially
  after having heard Capito philosophise, the vigour and agility displayed by
  him as well as his companions. I was then conducted into the baths, where,
  after being washed and perfumed in the most luxurious manner, I was arrayed
  in an elegant supper- garment by one of the slaves of our host. At table we
  were joined again by the ladies, who both reclined on the same couch with
  their uncle. Three comely youths attended us, in short tunics, and girt with
  napkins of fine linen; but, during the repast, an ancient female slave stood
  in silence behind the couch of the young ladies. A small fountain of
  alabaster played between two tall candelabra of the same material, at the
  farther end of the apartment; and a young damsel stood beside them, swinging
  slowly from time to time a silver censer, from which clouds of delicate odour
  rolled up to the mirrored roof.</p>

  <p>In all things the feast was splendid; but there was no appearance of
  useless or vain ostentation. Every thing was conducted in a style of great
  calmness and order, without the least formality. The repast interrupted not
  the conversation, which went on in a manner to me equally instructive as
  entertaining; although I must confess the presence of Athanasia sometimes
  rendered me inattentive to what was spoken. I could not divest myself of the
  idea, that some unknown circumstance was pressing on the mind of the fair
  creature, and that when she smiled upon those who addressed her, it was
  sometimes to conceal her ignorance of that which had been said.</p>

  <p>Being asked by Capito, I endeavoured, among other things, to inform him
  and his friends, as far as I could, concerning the then condition of this
  island, which, more particularly after the exploits of Agricola, had come to
  be a subject of some interest. In return, the chief topics which then
  occupied the capital were discussed by them, as I perceived, in a great
  measure on my account; and I listened with delight to the praises, which they
  all agreed on bestowing on the new Emperor. Many anecdotes were narrated,
  which tended to strengthen the feelings of admiration, with which I had
  already been accustomed to contemplate his character. But others were told,
  as the conversation went on, which I could not so easily reconcile with the
  idea I had formed of him.</p>

  <p>For example, I was somewhat disturbed with what they told me concerning
  his treatment of the Christians, who, as we understood in Britain, had been
  suffered to live in tranquillity ever since Nerva acceded to the empire. But
  now, from the circumstances related, it appeared that the mild and humane
  Trajan had taken up, in regard to this sect, the whole aversion of Domitian;
  every day some cruel catastrophe was made known of some person who had
  adopted their tenets. Being ignorant of the nature of those tenets, and
  having heard only in general terms that they were of Jewish origin, dark, and
  mystical, I was at a loss to account for the extreme hatred of the Prince, or
  rather for his condescending to give himself so much trouble concerning a
  matter so obscure and seemingly trifling.</p>

  <p>Capito, however, assured me, that although I might have good occasion to
  wonder at the steps taken by the Emperor, it would no longer be said by any
  one, that the progress of the Christian sect deserved to be considered as a
  matter either of obscurity, or of no consequence. "On the contrary," said he,
  "from what you have just heard of the numbers and quality of those that have
  lately suffered various punishments, you cannot hesitate to admit that the
  head of the empire has been justified in considering it as a subject worthy
  his attention."</p>

  <p>"We have adopted the gods of many nations," said Pontius Mamurra, "nor do
  I see why, because the Jews have been unfortunate in a contest with Rome, we
  should take it for granted that theirs are unworthy of respect, if, however,
  as we have heard asserted, he who embraces this creed becomes an infidel in
  regard to the deities of Rome, I say Caesar does well in refusing toleration
  to the intolerant superstition. Domitian was a tyrant, and a monster of
  humanity; the late prince was wise and good; and yet it may be, that, in
  regard to these Christians, the principle of Domitian's conduct was right in
  the main, and that of Nerva's wrong. But you, Capito, regard both sides of
  the question, I have no doubt, with the same indifference."</p>

  <p>"I hope," replied Capito, "I shall never regard will indifference any
  question, in which the interest of the empire and the honour of Trajan are
  concerned. But if you mean only that I am indifferent about the nature of
  this Syrian superstition, you are in the right. I have no knowledge of its
  dogmas, nor desire to have. I presume they have their share of that old
  eastern barbarity, in the shady places of which the elder Greeks used to
  think they could discover the outlines of something really grand and
  majestic."</p>

  <p>"It may be so," said Mamurra; "but if the superstition be found dangerous
  to the state, the Prince does well in repressing its progress. That is the
  only question of which I spake."&mdash;"There is, indeed, no other," said
  Capito; "I thought of none."&mdash;" And how do you answer it, dear uncle?"
  said Athanasia, (lifting herself up, for the first time, to take part in the
  conversation.)&mdash;"Nay, my love," said the old man, "to answer that is the
  business of Caesar, and of the Senate. I only regret, that blood should be
  shed, and citizens exiled; above all, in the reign of a just and merciful
  Prince.&mdash;Sempronia," continued he, "what is that strange story your
  father was telling about one of the daughters of Serennius?"</p>

  <p>"They only allege," replied Sempronia, with a smile, "that Tertulla had a
  flirtation with a handsome young Greek, and the Greek happened to be a
  Christian,&mdash;and she was converted by the Greek,&mdash;and she was found
  out in going with him to some secret assembly of these people, in a vault by
  the Vatican Hill,&mdash;and her father has been glad to send her to Corsica,
  partly to escape the lawyers, and partly, I suppose, in hopes that the
  quietness of the island, and the absence of handsome young Christians, may
  perhaps, in time, restore poor Tertulla to her right mind&mdash;This is all.
  Do you think that a strange story, uncle?"&mdash;"Not, if it be exactly as
  you have told it, Sempronia. What says Athanasia?" Athanasia answered
  gravely, that she was sorry for Tertulla, and had never heard any thing of
  the young Greek before.</p>

  <p>By this time, the increasing darkness of the chamber had warned me that we
  ought to be thinking of our return. I had more than once looked towards
  Sextus, but he refused to meet my eye. When I was on the point of speaking,
  Sempronia, starting from her couch, exclaimed, that she was sure there was
  thunder in the skies; and presently flash after flash gleamed along the
  horizon. All sat silent, as if awe-struck; but Sempronia was the only one
  that seemed to be in terror from the tempest. Nevertheless, my eyes rested
  more on Athanasia, who looked paler than she had done, although her
  countenance preserved its serenity. "How awful," said I, "is the voice of
  Jupiter!" Athanasia folded her arms upon her bosom, and lifting her eyes to
  heaven, said in a whisper,&mdash;"How awful is the voice of God!" She then
  dropt her hand on the end of her couch, and half unconsciously taking hold of
  it in mine, I asked her if she was afraid. "No," said she, "I am not afraid,
  but the heaviness of the air makes me faint, and I never can listen to
  thunder without feeling something extraordinary within me."</p>

  <p>Capito said, he could not think of our going into the city that evening,
  and that we must all make up our minds to remain in the villa. The
  countenance of Sextus brightened up, and he looked to me as if to ask my
  assent. I was easily persuaded, and our host despatched a messenger to inform
  Licinius of the cause of our absence. The old man then led us into another
  apartment, which was richly furnished with books and paintings. Here he read
  for some time out of one of the poets, to a party, none of whom, I am afraid,
  were very attentive in listening to him, till, the hour of rest being come,
  we were conducted to our several apartments, Sextus and myself, indeed, being
  lodged in the same chamber.</p>

  <p>We were no sooner left alone than I began to rally my friend on the beauty
  of his mistress, and the earnest court he had been paying her. The youth
  listened with blushes of delight to her praises, but seemed not to have the
  least idea that he had been so fortunate as to make any impression on her
  mind. On the contrary, he scarcely appeared to be aware of having done any
  thing to attract attention from her, and expressed astonishment when I
  assured him, that his behaviour had been such as could not possibly admit of
  more than one explanation in the eyes of a person so quick and vivacious as
  the lovely Sempronia.</p>

  <p>After we had both retired to our beds, and the lights were extinguished,
  we still continued for some time to talk over the incidents of our visit, and
  the future prospects of Sextus and his love; until at length sleep
  overpowered us in easy bonds, and agreeable dreams followed, I doubt not, in
  the hearts of us both, the thoughts and sights of a delightful day. Mine
  surely were delightful, for they were all of Athanasia. Yet, even in the
  visions of the night, I could never gaze on her face without some strange
  impression of mystery. I saw her placid smile&mdash;I heard the sweet low
  cadence of her voice&mdash;but I felt, and I could not feel it without a
  certain indescribable anxiety, that her deep thoughts were far away.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch106"
     name="ch106">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I AWOKE early, and drew near to the bed of Sextus; but
  seeing that he was fast asleep, and that a quiet smile was on his lips, I
  could not think of awakening him. The sun shone bright into the apartment,
  and I resolved to walk forth and breathe the balmy air of the garden.</p>

  <p>The moisture was still heavy on the green paths, and the birds were
  singing among glittering leaves; the god-like statues stood unscathed in
  their silent beauty. I walked to and fro, enjoying the enchantment of the
  scene;&mdash;a new feeling of the beauty of all things seemed to have been
  breathed into my soul; and the pensive grace of Athanasia hovered over my
  imagination, like some presiding genius of the groves.</p>

  <p>I found myself near the favourite grotto, and had stood over against its
  entrance for some space, contemplating the augmented stream as it fell from
  the super- incumbent rock, and regretting the ravage which the nightly
  tempest had made among the delicate flowers round its basin. Twice I thought
  I heard the murmurs of a voice, and twice I persuaded myself that it was only
  the rippling of the waters; but the third time I was satisfied that some
  person must be near. I passed between the water and the rock, and beheld the
  fair creature that had been occupying so many of my thoughts, kneeling far
  within the grotto, as it seemed, in supplication. To disturb her by advancing
  farther, would have been impious; to retire, without the risk of disturbing
  her, almost impossible; but I remained there fixed to the spot, without
  perhaps considering all these things as I should have done. The virgin
  modesty of her attitude was holy in my eyes, and the thought never occurred
  to me, that I might be doing wrong in permitting myself to witness the simple
  devotions of Athanasia. "Great God, listen to my prayers," was all I
  understood of what she said; but she whispered for some moments in a lowly
  and fervent tone, and I saw that she kissed something with her lips ere she
  arose from her knees. She then plunged her hands into the well, by whose
  brink she had knelt, and turned round to the light. "Athanasia, forgive me,"
  was already on my lips; but on seeing me, she uttered a faint cry and fell
  prostrate upon the marble. I rushed forward, lifted up her head, and laved
  water from the fountain, till I saw her lips tremble. At last she opened her
  eyes, and after gazing on me wildly for a moment, she gathered her strength,
  and stood quite upright, supporting herself against the wall of the grotto.
  "Great heavens!" cried I, "in what have I offended, that I should be rendered
  the cause of affliction to Athanasia? Speak, lady, and say that you forgive
  me."</p>

  <p>"I thought," said she, with a proud calmness, "that Valerius was of
  Roman&mdash;of Patrician blood. What brings him to be a spy upon the secret
  moments of a Patrician maiden?"&mdash;Then bursting into a tone of
  unutterable fervour, "Speak," said she, "young man, what have you heard? How
  long have you stood here? Am I betrayed?"</p>

  <p>"Witness, heaven and earth!" cried I, kneeling, "and witness every god,
  that I have heard nothing, except to know that you were praying. I have only
  seen you kneeling, and been guilty of gazing on your beauty."&mdash;"You
  heard not the words of my prayer?" said she. "No, not its words, Athanasia,
  nor any thing of its purpose."&mdash;"Do you swear this to me, young
  man?"&mdash;"Yes, I swear by Jupiter and by Rome&mdash;as I am a man and a
  Roman, I know not, neither do I desire to know, any thing of what you said.
  Forgive me for the fault of my indiscretion&mdash;you have no other to
  forgive."</p>

  <p>Athanasia paused for a moment, and then resuming more of her usual tone of
  voice, (although its accents were still somewhat disturbed and faltering,)
  said to me, "Valerius, since the thing is so, I have nothing to forgive. It
  is you that must pardon me for my suspicion."&mdash;"Distress me not,
  Athanasia," said I, "by speaking such words."&mdash;"From this hour, then,"
  said she, "what has passed here is forgotten. We blot it from our
  memories;"&mdash;and with that, as if in token of the paction, she extended
  to me her hand. I kissed it as I knelt, and swore that all things were safe
  with me; but added, as I arose, "that I was afraid I should be promising more
  than I should be able to perform,&mdash;did I say I should be able to forget
  any hour, or any place, where I had seen Athanasia."&mdash;"Nay," said she,
  "no compliment, or I shall begin to suspect you of insincerity." I was then
  about to withdraw from the grotto; but seeing a scroll of parchment lying at
  the feet of Athanasia, I stooped, and presented it to her, saying, "I was
  afraid she might forget it." She took it eagerly, and saying, "Of that there
  was no danger," placed it in her bosom, within the folds of her tunic. She
  was then gathering up her black tresses, and fastening them hastily on the
  back part of her head, when we heard the sound of footsteps not far off, and
  beckoning to me to remain where I was, she darted from me, and in a moment
  vanished among the trees. I waited for a few minutes, and then stepping
  forth, beheld her walking at a distance, beside her sister, in the direction
  of the villa. They were soon lost among the paths, and I returned alone into
  the grotto.</p>

  <p>I sat down beside the dark well, wherein she had dipped her hands, and
  mused in a most disturbed mood on all the particulars of this strange and
  unexpected interview. Every motion of her features&mdash;every modulation of
  her voice, was present with me; I had gathered them all into my heart, and I
  felt that I must cherish them there for ever. From the first moment I saw
  her, my eyes had been constrained to gaze upon her with an interest quite
  novel to me; but now I knew that she could not smile, without making my heart
  faint within me, and that the least whisper of her voice was able to bring
  tears into mine eyes. Now I thought of my own unworthiness, and could not
  help saying to myself, "Why should a poor ignorant provincial, such as I am,
  be torturing myself with the thoughts of such a creature as this?" Then,
  again, some benign glance of hers would return before me, and I could not
  help having some faint hopes, that her innocent heart might he won to me by
  faithful unwearied love. But what always threw me hack into despair, was the
  recollection of the mystery that I knew hung over her mind, although what it
  was I could not know. That she had been saying something in her prayers which
  could not be overheard without betraying her, she had herself confessed. What
  could be this secret, so cherished in dread, and in darkness?&mdash;A
  crime?&mdash;No crime could sully the clear bosom of her innocence. No
  consciousness of guilt could be concealed beneath that heavenly visage. But
  perhaps she had been made the confidante of some erring,&mdash;some unhappy
  friend. Perhaps, in her prayer, she had made mention of another's name, and
  implored the pardon of another's guilt. Last of all, why might it not be so,
  that the maiden loved, and was beloved again; that she might have some reason
  to regard any casual betrayal of her affection as a calamity; and that,
  having uttered the name of her lover in her secret supplications, her terrors
  might all have been occasioned by her apprehensions of my having overheard
  it? And yet there was something in the demeanour of Athanasia, that I could
  not bring myself to reconcile entirely with any one of these suppositions.
  Had she feared that I had overheard any confession of guilt,&mdash;even of
  the guilt of another,&mdash;surely some semblance of shame would have been
  mingled with her looks of terror. Had she apprehended only the discovery of
  an innocent love, surely her blushes would have been deeper, and her boldness
  less. Yet the last solution of the difficulty was that which haunted me the
  most powerfully. When I came forth into the open air, I perceived that the
  sun was already high in heaven, and proceeded in haste towards the villa, not
  doubting that Sextus and Capito would be astonished by the length of my
  absence. I found them and the ladies walking under the northern colonnade,
  having returned, as they told me, from a fruitless search after me through
  almost the whole of the garden. I looked to Athanasia, as if to signify that
  she well knew where I might have been found; but, although I saw that she
  understood my meaning, she said nothing in explanation. Sextus drew me aside
  shortly after, and told me, that his father had sent to inform him, that our
  presence was necessary in the city before supper-time, to attend a great
  entertainment which was to be given that evening by the lady whose cause he
  had successfully pleaded in the Forum on the preceding day; which lady, I now
  for the first time learned, was no other than the same Marcia Rubellia, to
  whom his father was very anxious the youth should be married. The success of
  this pleading had increased very much the wealth of the lady, and, of course,
  as Sextus well knew, the anxiety of Licinius for the proposed union; and to
  remain at the villa any longer, was, he said, entirely impossible, since he
  already suspected his father had not been quite pleased with him for leaving
  the Forum the day before, without staying to hear out a cause in which his
  duty, if not his inclination, ought to have made him feel so greatly
  interested.</p>

  <p>We bade adieu, therefore, to our kind host and the young ladies, not
  without more reluctance than either of us durst express, and ready promises
  to return soon again to the villa. We found Dromo and Boto waiting for us at
  the gate, the former of whom looked unutterable things, while the latter
  appeared to be as joyful in seeing me again, as if we had been parted for a
  twelvemonth. The two slaves were mounted on asses, but they led horses for
  our conveyance; so we mounted with all speed, and were soon beyond the
  beautiful enclosures of Capito. As soon as we were fairly out of sight of the
  house, Dromo began to ply Sextus with innumerable questions about the result
  of the visit, all of them in bad Greek; that, as he said, there might be no
  chance of what passed being understood by the Druid; for by that venerable
  designation, he informed us, the primitive Boto had already come to be best
  known in the vestibule of Licinius. "Ah!" quoth he, "there is no need for
  many words; I am sure my young master has not been behindhand with himself.
  If he has, it is no fault of mine, however. I put Opportunity into his hands,
  and she, you know, as the poets say, has only one lock of hair, and that is
  in front."</p>

  <p>Sextus being very shy of entering into particulars, I found myself obliged
  to take upon me the satisfying of the curiosity of this inquisitive varlet,
  which I did in a manner that much astonished Sextus, who by no means
  suspected, that in the midst of my own attention to the other cousin, I had
  been able to take so much notice of what passed between him and Sempronia.
  However, the gentle youth took a little raillery all in good part, and we
  laughed loudly in unison at the triumphant capers which the whip of Dromo
  made his poor ass exhibit, in testimony of his satisfaction with the progress
  which all things appeared to be making. We reached the city about three hours
  after noon, and were told by the slaves in attendance, that Xerophrastes had
  gone out some time before, and that Licinius was already busy in arraying
  himself for the feast of Rubellia.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch107"
     name="ch107">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">HER mansion was situated about the middle of the Suburra, in
  a neighbourhood nowise splendid, and itself distinguished, on the side
  fronting to the street, by no uncommon marks of elegance or opulence. A plain
  brick wall covered almost the whole of the building from the eye of the
  passenger; and what was seen deserved the praise of neatness, rather than of
  magnificence. Nevertheless, the moment one had passed the gate, and entered
  the court, one could not help perceiving, that taste and wealth had been
  alike expended abundantly on the residence; for the broad terrace and gallery
  behind were lavishly adorned, the one with sculpture and the other with
  paintings; and the gardens, which these overlooked, appeared to be both
  extensive and elaborate.</p>

  <p>We were conducted through several pillared halls, and then up a wide
  staircase, of somewhat sombre magnificence, into the chamber where the
  company were already in part assembled, and busy in offering their
  congratulations to the mistress of the feast. She was so much engaged with
  their flatteries that she did not at first perceive our entrance; but as soon
  as she knew who had come, the chief part of her attention was divided between
  her victorious advocate and his blushing son.</p>

  <p>Rapidly as we have been advancing in our imitation of the manners of the
  capital, our island, most unquestionably, has never yet displayed any thing
  that could sustain the smallest comparison with what then met my eyes in the
  stately saloon of this widow. The group around her was gay and various, and
  she was worthy of forming its centre; young and handsome, dressed in a style
  of the utmost splendour, her deportment equally elegant and vivacious. Her
  complexion was of that clear rich brown which lends to the eye a greater
  brilliancy than the most exquisite contrast of red and white; and over which
  the blood, when it does come into the face, diffuses at once the warmest and
  the deepest of blushes. Her hair appeared to be perfectly black, unless where
  the light, streaming from behind, gave an edging of glossy brown to the thick
  masses of her curls. Her robe of crimson silk was fastened by a girdle, which
  seemed to consist of nothing but rubies and emeralds, strung upon threads of
  gold. She wore a tiara that rose high above her tresses, and was all over
  resplendent with flowers woven in jewellery; and around her delicate wrists
  and ankles were twined broad chains of virgin gold, interspersed with
  alternate wreaths of sapphire. Her form was the perfection of luxury; and
  although I have said that her deportment was in general lively and brilliant,
  yet there was a soft seriousness that every now and then settled in her eyes,
  which gave her, for a moment, a look of melancholy that seemed to me more
  likely to be in harmony with the secret nature of her disposition. I watched
  her in particular when she spoke to Sextus; her full rich-toned voice was
  then merry, and her large eyes sparkled; but when she was engaged with any
  other person, she could not help gazing on the beautiful youth in silence;
  and then it was that her countenance wore its deepest expression of
  calmness&mdash;I had almost said, of sadness.</p>

  <p>I had been gazing on her, I know not how long, from another part of the
  room, when I heard a hearty chuckle from behind me, and thought I could not
  be unacquainted with the voice. Looking round, I saw, not without delight,
  the stately figure of my Praetorian Captain, Sabinus, whose cheerful eye soon
  distinguished me, and who forthwith came up to salute me in the most friendly
  manner. I introduced him to Licinius and Sextus, the former of whom expressed
  himself as being much gratified with the attention the centurion had shown to
  me during our voyage; so that I felt myself, as it were, no longer a stranger
  in the place; and the lutes and trumpets at that moment announcing that
  supper was ready to be served up, I took care to keep close to Sabinus, and
  to place myself near him on the couch.</p>

  <p>The room in which the feast was prepared, communicated by a pair of brazen
  folding doors, richly sculptured, with that in which the company had
  assembled; but from it, although the sun had not yet gone down, all light was
  excluded, excepting what streamed from golden candelabra, and broad lamps of
  bronze suspended overhead from the high and painted ceiling. The party might
  consist of about twenty, who reclined along one semi-circular couch, the
  covers of which were of the softest down, and the framework inlaid with
  ivory;&mdash;the part of the room enclosed by its outline being occupied with
  the table, and an open space to which the attendants had free access. We had
  no sooner taken our seats than a crowd of slaves entered, carrying large
  boards upon their heads, which being forthwith arranged on the table, were
  seen to be loaded with dishes of gold and silver, and all manner of drinking
  vessels, also with vases of rare flowers, and urns of perfume. But how did
  the countenance of Sabinus brighten, when the trumpet sounded a second time
  as if from below, and the floor of the chamber was suddenly, as it were,
  pierced in twain, and the pealing music 'ushered up a huge roasted boar, all
  wreathed with stately garnishings, and standing erect on his golden platform
  as on a chariot of triumph! "Ah! my dear boy," cries he, "here comes the true
  king of beasts, and only legitimate monarch of the woods. What should we not
  have given for a slice of him when we were pent up, half-starved and
  fainting, in that abominable ship of ours?&mdash;All hail, most potent
  conqueror! but whether Germanic or Asiatic be thy proper title, I shall soon
  know, when that expert Ionian has daintily carved and divided thee." But why
  should I attempt to describe to you the particulars of the feast? Let it
  suffice, that whatever idea I had formed of Roman profusion was surpassed,
  and that the splendour of the entertainment engaged the attention of all
  except Rubellia herself, who, reclining immediately above Sextus, kept her
  eyes fixed almost all the time it lasted, upon his luxuriant curls of dark
  hair, unless when she caused the young damsel, her cup-bearer, to pour out to
  her wine in a goblet of onyx, which she touched with her lips, and then
  handed to the indifferent boy. When the supper was half over, the folding-
  doors were again thrown open, and there entered a group of maidens and
  beautiful youths, who danced before us to the music of the lute, and
  scattered crowns of roses at the feet of Rubellia and her guests. She herself
  placed one of them on the head of Sextus, and another on that of his father,
  who lay on the other side of her, and then caused a large cup of wine to be
  carried all around, whereof each of us tasted, and drank to the health of the
  orator, in whose honour the entertainment was made. The ladies that were
  present imitated the example of the hostess, and crowned such as were by
  them; but Sabinus and I, not being near enough to any of them, received that
  courtesy from some of the dancing maidens. Libations were poured out
  abundantly on the marble floor, and all the gods were invoked to shower down
  their blessings on Rubellia, and those that had been so fortunate as to serve
  her. Sweet strains of music resounded through the tall pillars of the
  banqueting- room, and the lamps burned heavily in an atmosphere overloaded
  with perfumes.</p>

  <p>It appeared to me, from the beginning, that my friend Sabinus witnessed,
  not without some feelings of displeasure, the excessive attentions which
  Rubellia lavished on young Sextus; and I gathered, from the way in which he
  every now and then looked towards them during the supper, that, had the place
  permitted, he would not have allowed such things to go on without some
  comment. But when we had left the banqueting- room, and removed to another
  apartment, where, amidst various entertainments of dancing, music, and
  recitation, Rubellia still retained close to herself the heir of Licinius,
  the centurion made to himself abundant amends for the previous restraint to
  which his temper had been subjected. "Confess now," said he, "that she is a
  lovely creature, and that your British beauties are tame and insipid, when
  compared with such a specimen of Roman fascination; and confess, withal, that
  this curled boy is either the most ignorant, or the most insusceptible of his
  sex. Good heavens! in what a different style was she treated by the old
  magistrate, whose very bust there, in the corner, looks quite blank and
  disconsolate with its great white eyes, while she, that sat for so many
  months pale and weeping by his bed-side, is thinking of nothing but to bestow
  all the wealth he left her on a beardless stripling, who appears to regard
  the bust and the beauty with almost equal indifference. Alas! poor old
  withered Leberinus, little did you imagine that so small a phial would
  suffice to hold all her tears. My only wonder is, that she still permits your
  marble image to occupy even a corner of her mansion; but, no doubt, you will
  soon be sent on your travels. I dare say, some cold pedestal in the garden
  will, ere long, be the best birth you need look for. Well, well, you see what
  fools we may be made by the cunning of these pretty crocodiles. I trust my
  dotage, when it does come, will not show itself in the same shape with that
  of my good old friend. I hope the ghost of the worthy Praetor will not frown
  unseen the night she takes this Adonis to her arms. If I were in his place, I
  should give her curtains a pretty shake. By Hermes! it would not be a pretty
  monument and a flowery epitaph that would make me lie still."</p>

  <p>"How long is it," said I, "since this venerable magistrate died? Surely
  she has allowed him the decency of a tenmonth's grief, before she began to
  give suppers, and perceive the beauty of Sextus?"&mdash;"Whether it be a
  tenmonth ago or not," replied the Centurion, "is more than I can take upon me
  to decide; all I know is, that it appears to me as if it were but yesterday
  that I supped here, (it was just before I set off for Britain,) and saw the
  young lady reclining, even at table, with those long black curls of her's, in
  the bosom of the emaciated Leberinus. By Jupiter! the old man would not taste
  a drop of wine unless she kissed the cup&mdash;she coaxed every morsel he
  swallowed down his throat, and clasped the garland round his bald pate with
  her own fingers; ay, twice before that sleek physician&mdash;that
  solemn-faced Greek, whom you see at this moment talking with your kinsman,
  advised her to have him carried to his bed. For all the gravity of his looks,
  I would lay a trifle, that worthy Boeotian has his own thoughts about what is
  passing, as well as I. But the worst-pleased face in the whole room is, I
  think, that of old Rubellius himself yonder, who has just come in, without,
  it is evident, being aware that any feast was going forward. Without
  question, the crafty usurer is of opinion he might have been invited. I
  promise you, I can interpret the glances of that gray-headed extortioner; and
  well I may, for it is not the first time I have had an opportunity of
  studying them. Ay, ay, quoth he to himself, she may do as she will with the
  bonds of Leberinus: but she might have remembered, that a codicil can be
  easily tacked to the end of a living man's testament."</p>

  <p>"But, after all," said I, "one must admit, that if she married old
  Leberinus to please her father, the widow has some right to choose her second
  husband according to the pattern of her own fancy."&mdash;"Oh! by all means,"
  answered he; "let her please herself; let her make a fool of herself now, if
  she will. She may perhaps learn, some time or other, that it is as possible
  to have too young a husband, as to have too old a one."&mdash;"Come now,"
  said I, "Sabinus, confess that if she had selected some well-made,
  middle-aged man&mdash;some respectable man some man of note and distinction,
  you would have judged less harshly of poor Rubellia."&mdash;"Ah! you cunning
  dog," said he; "who would have thought that you had brought so much
  wickedness from that new world of yours? But do you really think she will wed
  Sextus? The boy appears strangely cold. I should not wonder, when all is
  done, if the match were more of the orator's seeking than his own."&mdash;"I
  can only tell you," said I, "that I have never heard Licinius mention any
  thing about it; and, I dare say, Sextus would be very sorry to think of
  losing his liberty for the sake of the wealth of Leberinus ay, or for that of
  old Rubellius to boot."&mdash;"Young friend," quoth he, "you are not quite
  acquainted with the way in which these matters are managed at Rome. If we had
  you six weeks at the other side of the Viminal, we should teach you
  better."</p>

  <p>I know not how long this sort of talk might have lasted; but Licinius put
  an end to it by joining us, and soon engaged the worthy Centurion, and
  several more of us, with some lively, but unintelligible discussion on the
  merits of some new edict, of which none of us had ever heard, or were likely
  ever to hear any thing again. We were glad to escape from the lawyer into
  another room, where some Greek slaves were performing a sort of comic
  pantomime, that appeared to give more delight to old Rubellius than any other
  of the spectators. As for Sextus, I saw plainly that he was quite weary of
  the entertainment, and anxious to get away; but we were obliged to remain
  till after Licinius was gone, for it was evident that he wished his son to
  see out the last. But no sooner had we heard his chariot drive off, than the
  young man and I took leave of the lady, and withdrew. Sabinus lingered a
  moment behind us, and then joined us in the vestibule, from which, his course
  lying so far in the same direction as ours, we all proceeded homewards on
  foot.</p>

  <p>We had proceeded along the street of the Suburra for a considerable space,
  and were already beneath the shade of the great Temple of Isis and Serapis,
  (which stands on the northern side of the Esquiline Hill, nigh over against
  the Amphitheatre of Vespasian,) when, from the opposite side of the way, we
  were hailed by a small party of soldiers, who, as it turned out, had been
  sent from the Praetorian camp in search of Sabinus, and one of whom had now
  recognized his gait and stature, notwithstanding the obscurity of the hour.
  The Centurion went aside with the leader of these men for some moments, and
  then informed us that it was very fortunate they had so easily recognized
  him, as the business on which they had been sent was such as did not admit of
  being negligently dealt with. "To-morrow," said he, pointing to the
  Amphitheatre before us, "that glorious edifice is to be the scene of one of
  the grandest shows exhibited by Trajan since his accession to the empire. It
  is the anniversary of the day on which he was adopted by Nerva, and the
  splendour of the spectacle will be in proportion to the gratitude and
  veneration with which he at all times regards the memory of that excellent
  benefactor. But there are some parts of the exhibition that I am afraid old
  Nerva, could he be present to behold them, would not regard with the same
  feelings as his successor."&mdash;"Surely," said I, "the beneficent Trajan
  will not stain the expression of his gratitude by any thing unworthy of
  himself, or that could give displeasure to Nerva."&mdash;"Nay," replied the
  Centurion, "it is not for me to talk about any thing that Trajan chooses to
  do being unworthy of Trajan; but you well know that Nerva would never suffer
  any of the Christians to be molested during his reign, and now here are some
  of these unhappy fanatics, that are to be compelled either to renounce their
  faith in the face of the assembly to-morrow, or to die in the arena. It is to
  inspect the condition of these unfortunates, who, I know not for what reason,
  are confined in a dungeon below the ramparts in the vicinity of our camp, and
  to announce to them the final determination of their fate, that I, as
  Centurion of the night, have now been summoned. If you are curious to see the
  men, you are at liberty to go with me, and I shall be obliged to you for your
  company."</p>

  <p>My curiosity having been excited in regard to the new faith and its
  adherents, I was very desirous to accept of this offer. Nor did Sextus any
  sooner perceive that such was my inclination, than he advised me to gratify
  it, undertaking, at the same time, to satisfy his father, in case of any
  inquiry, that I was in a place of safety, and under the protection of
  Sabinus. With him, therefore, and with his Praetorians,I proceeded along
  various streets which led us by the skirts of the Esquiline and Viminal
  Hills, on to the region of the Mounds of Tarquin, over against which, as you
  have heard, the great camp of those bands is situated;&mdash;if indeed that
  ought of right to be called by the name of a camp, which is itself a city of
  no slender dimensions, and built with great splendour of architecture, spread
  out beyond the limits of Rome, for the accommodation of that proud soldiery.
  There my friend took me into his chamber, and furnished me with a cloak and
  helmet, that I might excite no suspicion by accompanying him on his errand.
  The watch-word of the night also was given me, <i>Silent faith</i>; and
  proceeding again, we shortly reached the place where the Christians were
  lying.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch108"
     name="ch108">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ENTERING the guard-room, we found it crowded with spearmen
  of Sabinus's band, some playing at dice, others carousing jovially, many
  wrapped up in their mantles, and asleep upon the floor; while a few only were
  sitting beneath the porch, with their spears in their hands, and leaning upon
  their bucklers. From one of these, the Centurion, having drawn him aside,
  made inquiry concerning the names and condition of the prisoners, and whether
  as yet they had received any intelligence as to the morrow. The soldier, who
  was a grave man, well stricken in years, made answer, "that the men were
  free-born and of decent estate, and that he had not heard of any thing else
  being laid to their charge, excepting that which concerned their religion.
  Since they have been here," he continued, "I have been several times set on
  watch over them, and twice have I lain with one of them in his dungeon; yet
  have I heard no complaints from any of them, for in all things they are
  patient. One of them only is to suffer to- morrow but for him I am especially
  concerned, for he was known to me of old, having served often with me when I
  was a horseman in the army of Titus, all through the war of Palestine, and at
  the siege of Jerusalem."</p>

  <p>"And of what country is he?" said Sabinus. "Is he also a
  Roman?"&mdash;"No, sir," answered the spearman, "he is no Roman; but he was
  of a troop of the allies that was joined often to our legion, and I have seen
  him bear himself on the day of battle as well as any Roman. He is by birth a
  Greek of the Syrian coast; but his mother was of the nation of the
  Jews."&mdash;"And yet, although the son of a Jewess, he was with us, say you,
  at the siege of Jerusalem?"&mdash;"Even so," replied the man; "and not he
  only, but many others; for the Jews were divided against themselves; and of
  all them that were Christians, not one abode in the city, or gave help to
  defend it. As this man himself said, the oracles of the Christians, and their
  prophets, had of old given warning that the city must fall into the hands of
  Caesar, by reason of the wickedness of that people; therefore, when we set
  our camp against Jerusalem, these all passed out from the city, with their
  wives and children, and dwelt safely in the mountainous country until the
  fate was fulfilled. But some of their young men fought in our camp, and did
  good service, because the place was known to them, and they had acquaintance
  with all the secrets of the Rock. Of these, this man was one. He and all his
  household had departed from the ancient religion of the Jews, and were
  believers in the doctrines of the Christians, for which cause he is now to
  suffer; and of that, although I have not spoken to him this evening, I think
  he has already received some intelligence, for certain of his friends passed
  in to him, and they covered their faces as they went in, as if
  weeping."&mdash;"Are these friends still with him?" said Sabinus. "Yes,"
  answered he, "for I must have seen them had they come forth again. Without
  doubt, the two women are still with him in his dungeon."&mdash;"Women?" quoth
  Sabinus; "and of what condition think you they may be?"&mdash;"That I know
  not," replied the soldier; "for, as I have said, they were muffled in their
  mantles. But one of them, at least, is a Roman, for I heard her speak to him
  that is by the door of the dungeon."&mdash;"How long is it," said the
  Centurion, "since they went in to the prisoner?"&mdash;"More than an hour,"
  replied the soldier, looking at the water-clock that stood beneath the porch;
  "and if they be Christians, they are not yet about to depart, for they never
  separate without singing together, which is said to be their favourite manner
  of worship."</p>

  <p>He had scarcely uttered these words, when the soldiers that were carousing
  within the guard-room became silent, and we heard the voices of those that
  were in the dungeon singing together in a sweet and lowly manner. "Ah, sir!"
  said the old soldier, "I thought it would be even so&mdash;there is not a
  spearman in the band that would not willingly watch here a whole night, could
  he be sure of hearing that melody. Well do I know that soft voice&mdash;Hear
  now, how she sings by herself&mdash;and there again, that deep strong
  note&mdash;that is the voice of the prisoner."</p>

  <p>"Hush!" quoth the Centurion, "heard you ever any thing half so divine? Are
  these words Greek or Syrian?"&mdash;"What the words are I know not," said the
  soldier; "but I know the tune well I have heard it played many a night with
  hautboy, clarion, and dulcimer, on the high walls of Jerusalem, while the
  city was beleaguered."&mdash;"It is some old Jewish tune then," said Sabinus;
  "I knew rot those barbarians had had half so much art."</p>

  <p>"Why, as for that, sir," replied the man, "I have been all over Greece and
  Egypt&mdash;to say nothing of Italy&mdash;and I never heard any music like
  that music of the Jews. When they came down to join the battle, their
  trumpets sounded so gloriously, that we wondered how it was possible for them
  ever to be driven back; and then, when their gates were closed, and they sent
  out to beg their dead, they would play such solemn awful notes of
  lamentation, that the plunderers stood still to listen, and their warriors
  were delivered to them with all their mail as they had fallen."&mdash;"And
  the Christians also," said Sabinus, "had the same tunes?"&mdash;"Oh yes,
  sir&mdash;why, for that matter, these very tunes may have been among them,
  for aught we know, since the beginning of their nation. I have stood sentinel
  with this very man, and seen the tears run down his cheeks by the star-light,
  when he heard the music from the city, as the Jewish captains were going
  their rounds upon the battlements."&mdash;"But this, surely," said the
  Centurion, "is no warlike melody."&mdash;"I know not," quoth the old soldier,
  "whether it be or not&mdash;but I am sure it sounds not like any music of
  sorrow,&mdash;and yet what plaintive tones are in the part of that female
  voice!"&mdash;"The bass sounds triumphantly, in good sooth."&mdash;"Ay, sir,
  but that is the old man's own voice&mdash;I am sure he will keep a good heart
  to the end, even though they should be singing their farewell to him. Well,
  the Emperor loses a good soldier, the hour Tisias dies. I wish to Jupiter he
  had not been a Christian, or had kept his religion to himself. But as for
  changing now&mdash;you might as well think of persuading the Prince himself
  to be a Jew."</p>

  <p>"That last high strain, however," quoth Sabinus, "has ended their singing.
  Let us speak to the women as they come out; and if it be so that the man is
  already aware of what is to be done to-morrow, I see not why we should
  trouble him with entering his cell. He has but a few hours to live, and I
  would not willingly disturb him."&mdash;"I hear them coming," said the
  soldier. "Then do you meet them," said Sabinus, "and tell them that the
  Centurion wishes to speak to them ere they go away&mdash;we will retire out
  of hearing of the guard."</p>

  <p>With that he and I withdrew to the other side of the way, over against the
  door of the prison; and we stood there waiting for the women under a fig-
  tree, close by the city wall. In a few minutes two persons, arrayed as the
  soldier had described, drew near to us; and one of them, without uncovering
  her countenance, said, "Master, we trust we have done no evil in visiting the
  prisoners; had it been so, surely we should not have been permitted to enter
  without question."</p>

  <p>These words were spoken in a voice tremulous, as if with grief rather than
  with terror; but I could not help starting when I heard them. However, I
  commanded myself, and heard in silence what Sabinus replied.&mdash;"Be not
  alarmed," said he; "there is no offence committed, for no orders have been
  issued to prevent these men from seeing their friends. I sent for you, not to
  find fault with what you have done, but only to ask whether this prisoner has
  already been told that the Emperor has announced his resolution concerning
  him, and that he must die to-morrow, in the Amphitheatre of Vespasian, unless
  he renounce his superstition."&mdash;"He knows all," answered the same voice;
  "and is prepared for all"</p>

  <p>"By heavens! Valerius," whispered Sabinus; "it is no mean person that
  speaks so&mdash;this is the accent and the gesture of a Roman lady." Then
  raising his voice, "In that case there is no need for my going into the
  dungeon; and yet, could I hope to say any thing that might tend to make him
  change his purpose, I would most gladly do so. The Emperor is as humane as he
  is just, and unless when rebellious obstinacy shuts the gates of mercy, he is
  the last that would consent to the shedding of any blood.&mdash;For this
  Tisias, of whose history I have just been hearing something, I am in a
  particular manner interested, and to save him, I wish only I had power equal
  to my inclination. Is there no chance of convincing him"&mdash;"He is already
  convinced."&mdash;"Could his friends do nothing?" His friends have been with
  him," said the voice. This last sentence was spoken so distinctly, that I
  knew I could no longer be mistaken; and I was on the brink of speaking out,
  without thinking of the consequences that might occur, when she that had
  spoken, uttered a faint cry, and dropping on her knees before Sabinus, said,
  "Oh, sir! to us also be merciful, and let us go hence ere any one behold
  us!"&mdash;"Go in peace, lady," answered the Centurion, "and henceforth be
  prudent as well as kind;" and they went away from us, and were soon lost to
  our sight in the windings of the street.</p>

  <p>We stood there for some moments in silence, looking towards the place
  where they disappeared. "Strange superstition," said Sabinus; "what heroism
  dwells with this madness!&mdash;you see how little these men regard their
  lives; nay, even women, and Roman women too&mdash;you see how their nature is
  changed by it."&mdash;"It is, indeed, a most strange spectacle," said I; "but
  what is to be the end of it, if this spirit become diffused widely among the
  people?"&mdash;"In truth I know not," answered the Centurion; "as yet we have
  heard of few who had once embraced this faith, renouncing it out of fear for
  their lives." "And in the days of Nero and Domitian," said I, "were not many
  hundreds of them punished even here in the capital?"&mdash;"You are within
  the mark," said he; "and not a few of those who were sent into exile, because
  of their Christianity, were, as you may have heard, of no ordinary condition.
  Among these there were Flavius Clemens, the Consular, and his wife,
  Domitilla; both of whom I have often seen in my youth&mdash;both relations to
  the family of Vespasian&mdash;whom, notwithstanding, all the splendour of the
  imperial blood could not save from the common fate of their sect. But Nerva
  suffered all of them to live in peace, and recalled such as were in exile,
  excepting only Domitilla, whose fate has been regretted by all men; but I
  suppose it was not at first judged safe to recall her, lest any tumult should
  have been excited in her name, by those that regretted (and I am sorry to say
  these were not a few) the wicked license of which they had been deprived by
  the death of her tyrannical kinsman, and the transition of the imperial
  dignity into another line. She also with whom we have been speaking, is, I am
  sure, a Roman lady of condition; and you may judge of her zeal, when you see
  it brings her hither at midnight, to mingle tears and prayers with those of
  an obscure Asiatic. Did you observe, that the other female both walked and
  stood behind her."</p>

  <p>"I observed all this," answered I. But little did Sabinus suspect that I
  had observed so much more than he himself had done. Before parting from him,
  I said I should still be gratified with being permitted to see the prisoner;
  and although he declined entering himself, he accordingly gave command that
  the door of his dungeon should be opened for me, requesting me, at the same
  time, to refrain from saying any thing more than was necessary for the
  explaining the apparent purpose of my visit,&mdash;the communication, namely,
  of Trajan's decree.</p>

  <p>The Centurion withdrew to his camp; and the same old spearman with whom we
  had conversed at the Porch, carried a torch in his hand, and showed me the
  way into the dungeon.</p>

  <p>Between the first door and the second, which appeared to be almost
  entirely formed of iron, there intervened a few broad steps of mason-work;
  and upon the lowest of these, I stood waiting till he should open the inner
  door. Several keys were applied before he discovered the right one; but at
  last the heavy door swung away from before him so speedily, that the air,
  rushing out of the vault, extinguished the torch; insomuch, that we bad no
  light excepting that which streamed from an aperture high up in the wall of
  the dungeon itself; a feeble ray of star-light alone&mdash;for the moon had,
  long ere this time, been gone down&mdash;which, nevertheless, sufficed to
  show us to the prisoner, although we at first could see nothing of him.</p>

  <p>"Soldiers," said the old man, in a voice of perfect calmness, "for what
  reason are you come?"&mdash;"We come," said my companion, "by command of the
  Centurion, to inform you of things which we would willingly not have to
  tell&mdash;To-morrow Trajan opens the Amphitheatre of Vespasian."&mdash;"My
  comrade," said the prisoner, "is it your voice I hear? I knew all this
  already; and you know of old that I fear not the face of death."&mdash;"I
  know well, Tisias, you fear not death; yet why, when there is no need, should
  you cast away life? Think well, I beseech you, and reserve yourself for a
  better day."&mdash;"The dawn of that better day, Romans, already begins to
  open upon my eyes. I see the east red with the promise of its brightness.
  Would you have me tarry in darkness, when I am invited to walk forth into the
  light?"&mdash;"Your words rejoice me," answered the spearman; "and I am sure
  all will rejoice in hearing that you have at length come to think
  thus&mdash;Trajan himself will rejoice. You have but to say the word, and you
  are free."&mdash;"You mean kindly," said the old man, rising from his pallet,
  and walking towards us as far as his fetters permitted; "but you are much
  mistaken&mdash;I have but to keep silence, and I am free."&mdash;"Alas! what
  mean you? Do you know what you say? You must worship the gods in the morning,
  else you die."&mdash;"Evening, and morning, and for ever, I must worship the
  God that made heaven and earth. If I bow down to the idols of Trajan, I buy
  the life of a day at the price of death everlasting. Tempt me not in your
  kindness: I fell once. Great God, preserve me from falling! I have bade
  farewell to my friends already. Leave me to spend these few hours by
  myself.&mdash;Leave me to prepare the flesh for that from which the spirit
  shrinks not." So saying, he extended his hand to the spearman, and the two
  old men embraced each other before me.</p>

  <p>"Prisoner," said I, "if there be any thing in which we can serve you,
  command our aid. We have already done our duty; if we can also do any thing
  that may give ease to your mind now, or comfort to your kindred, you have but
  to speak."&mdash;"Sir," replied he, "I see by the eagle wings on your helmet,
  that you are one in authority, and I hear by your voice that you are young.
  There is a certain thing, concerning which I had some purpose to speak to
  this old brother."&mdash;"Speak with confidence," said I; "although I am a
  Roman, and bear all loyalty to Caesar, yet this Praetorian helmet is not
  mine, and I have but assumed it for the sake of having access to your prison.
  I am no soldier of Trajan: Whatever I can do for you without harm to others,
  speak, and I will do it. I will swear to you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nay, sir," said he, "swear not&mdash;mock not the God of heaven, by
  invoking idol or demon&mdash;I believe your word&mdash;but, since you will
  hear, there is no need why any other should be witness to my
  request."&mdash;"I will retire," said the other, "and keep watch at the door.
  I am but a poor spearman, and this young patrician can do more than
  I."&mdash;"Be it so," said the prisoner, a second time embracing him; "I
  would not willingly expose you to any needless danger; and yet I see not what
  danger there is in all that I have to ask."</p>

  <p>With this the spearman withdrew; and being left alone with Tisias, I took
  his hand, and sitting down beside him on his pallet, shortly explained to him
  the circumstances under which I had come thither.</p>

  <p>"Young sir," said he, "I know not what is about the sound of your voice,
  and the frankness of your demeanour, that makes me feel confidence enough to
  intrust you with a certain thing, which concerns not myself, nor any hope of
  mine, for that were little&mdash;but the interests of one that is far dearer
  to me than I can express, and who, I hope, will live many happy days upon
  earth, after I shall have sealed my belief in the message of God, by blood
  that has of old been exposed a thousand times to all mortal perils, for the
  sake of worthless things. But a very short while ago, and I might have
  executed this thing for myself; but weakness overcame me at the moment of
  parting."</p>

  <p>"If it be any thing which you would have me convey to any one, say where I
  may find the person," said I, "and be assured I shall deliver it in
  safety."</p>

  <p>"Sir," he proceeded, "I have here with me certain writings, which I have
  carried for these twenty years continually in my bosom. Among these, is one
  of the sacred books of the faith for which I am to die, and I would fain have
  it placed in the hands of one to whom I know it will be dearest of all for
  the sake of that which it contains; but, I hope, dear, also for the sake of
  him that bequeaths it. Will you seek out a certain Roman lady, and undertake
  to give into her own hands, in secret, the scroll which I shall give
  you?"&mdash;"I will do my endeavour," said I; "and if I cannot find means to
  execute your command, I shall destroy the book with my own hands before I
  quit Rome for my stay here is uncertain."&mdash;"If you cannot find means to
  do what I ask safely," he replied, "I do not bid you destroy the
  book&mdash;<i>that</i> is yours to do with as it shall seem good to
  you&mdash;but I conjure you to read it before you throw it away. Nay, even as
  it is, I conjure you to read it before you seek to give it to her whose name
  I shall mention."&mdash;"Old man," said I, "almost I believe that I already
  know her name, and more besides. If it be so that I have conjectured aright,
  be assured that all you ask shall be fulfilled to the letter; be assured
  also, that I would die with you to-morrow, rather than live to be the cause
  or instrument of any evil thing to her that but now visited you in your
  dungeon."&mdash;"Alas!" cried the old man, starting up, "lay not this also, O
  Lord! upon my head. Let the old bear witness but let the young be spared, to
  serve thee in happier years upon the earth!"&mdash;"Be not afraid," said I,
  "if it was Athanasia, no one suspected it but myself; and I have already told
  you that I would die rather than bring evil upon her head."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he answered, after a pause&mdash;"it was, indeed, Athanasia. Who is
  it but she that would have left the halls of nobles, and the couches of
  peace, to breathe at midnight the air of a dungeon, that she might solace the
  last moments of a poor man, and, save the bond of Christ, a stranger! But if
  you have known her before, and spoken with her before, then surely she must
  indeed be safe in your hands. You know where she dwells&mdash;that I myself
  know not. Here is the scroll, from which that noble maiden has heard my
  humble voice essay to expound the words of eternal life. I charge you to
  approach her with reverence, and give into her own hands my dying bequest;
  yet, as I have said, deliver it not to her till you have yourself read what
  it contains."&mdash;"Christian," said I, placing the writing in my bosom,
  "have no fear&mdash;I will read your book, and ere two nights have gone over
  my head, I shall find means to place it in the hands of Athanasia; and now,
  farewell."&mdash;"Nay, not yet for the last time. Will you not come in the
  morning, and behold the death of a Christian?"&mdash;"Alas!" said I, "what
  will it avail that I should witness the shedding of your blood? The Prince
  may have reason to regard you as an offender against the state; but I have
  spoken with you in your solitude, and know that your heart is noble. Would to
  Heaven, that by going thither I could avert your fate!"&mdash;"Methinks,
  sir," he replied, "it may be weakness but yet methinks it would give me some
  farther comfort in my death, to know that there was at least one Roman there,
  who would not see me die without pity; and besides I must have you constrain
  yourself, that you may be able to carry the tidings of my departure. Her
  prayers will be with me, but not her eyes. You must tell Athanasia the manner
  of my death."&mdash;"For that cause," said I, "I will constrain myself, and
  be present in the Amphitheatre."&mdash;"Then, farewell," said he; "&mdash;and
  yet go not. In whatsoever faith you live,&mdash;in whatsoever faith you die,
  the blessing of an old man and a Christian can do you no harm." So saying,
  the old man stood up, and leaning his hand on my head as I sat, pronounced
  over me a blessing which I never shall forget. "The Lord bless thee&mdash;the
  Lord enlighten thy darkness&mdash;the Lord plant his seed in thy kind
  heart&mdash;the Lord give thee also to die the death of a Christian!"</p>

  <p>When he had said so, he sat down again; and I departed greatly oppressed
  in spirit, yet feeling, I know not how or why, as I would rather have lost
  many merry days, than that dark and sorrowful hour. The soldiers in the
  guard-room were so much engaged in their different occupations, that they
  heeded me not as, dropping my borrowed habiliments, I stept silently to the
  gate; and I was soon out of sight of their flaming watch-fires, and far from
  the sounds of their noisy mirth.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch109"
     name="ch109">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE Roman streets were totally silent and deserted. It was
  the first time that I had been in the presence of a human being, foreseeing
  distinctly, and quietly waiting, the termination of his mortal existence, and
  I could not help asking of myself, how, under similar circumstances of
  terror, I should have been able to sustain my spirits?&mdash;to what
  resources I should, in such a moment, look for the support which seemed to
  have been vouchsafed so abundantly to this old man; by what charm, in
  fine,&mdash;by what tenet of philosophy, or by what hope of religion,&mdash;I
  should, in the midst of life, be able to reconcile myself to a voluntary
  embrace of death! To avoid disgrace, indeed, and dishonour, said I, I think I
  could be Roman enough to dare the worst; but this poor man is willing to die,
  rather than acknowledge, by one offering on the altar, the deities in whose
  worship all his Greek ancestors have been trained; yet who, except perhaps a
  few obscure individuals that have adopted the same new superstition, would
  think this man dishonoured by returning to the religion of his fathers? Deep,
  indeed, must be his conviction of the truth of that which he professes to
  believe serious indeed must be his faith, and high his trust. What if, after
  all, his faith should be true, and his trust wise? And the gentle
  Athanasia!&mdash;She too a Christian! Might not this mystery be hereafter
  explained to me by her lips?</p>

  <p>Musing and meditating thus, it was no wonder that I, who knew so little of
  Rome, should have soon wandered from the straight way to the home of my
  kinsman. But that I at last caught, at the turning of a street, a glimpse of
  the Flavian Amphitheatre, which I had before passed on my way from the feast
  of Rubellia, I might, perhaps, have wandered long. I had some notion how that
  grand edifice was situated with respect to the house of Licinius, and
  therefore moved towards it immediately, intending to pass straight down from
  thence into the Sacred Way. But when I came close to the Amphitheatre, I
  found that, surrounded on all sides by a city of sleep and silence, that
  region was already filled with all manner of noise and tumult, in consequence
  of the preparations which had begun to be made for the spectacles. The east
  hardly yet indicated dawn; but the torches and lanterns of workmen and
  artificers were in motion every where. On one side, the whole way was blocked
  up with a throng of waggons; the conductors, almost all Ethiopians and
  Numidians, lashing each other's horses, and exchanging, in their barbarous
  tongues, outcries of wrath and execration. The bellowings that resounded from
  any of the waggons, which happened to be set in motion amidst the throng,
  intimated that savage beasts were confined within them; and when I had
  discovered this, and then regarded the prodigious multitude of the vehicles,
  I cannot say what horror came over me at thinking what cruel sights, and how
  lavish in cruelty, were become the favourite pastimes of the most refined of
  nations. I recognized the well-known short deep snort of the wild boar, and
  the long hollow bark of the wolf; but a thousand fierce sounds, mingled with
  these, were new to my ears. One voice, however, was so grand in its notes of
  sullen rage, that I could not help asking a soldier, who sat on horseback
  near me, from what monster it proceeded. The man answered, that it was a
  lion; but then what laughter arose among some of the rabble, that had
  overheard my interrogation; and what contemptuous looks were thrown upon me
  by the naked negroes, who sat grinning in the torch-light, on the tops of
  their carriages! Then one or two of the soldiers would be compelled to ride
  into the midst of the confusion, to separate some of these wretches, fighting
  with their whips about precedence in the approach; and it seemed to me that
  the horses could not away with the strong sickly smell of the wild beasts;
  for they would prance, and caper, and rear on end, and snort as if
  panic-struck, and dart themselves towards the other side; while some of the
  riders were thrown off in the midst of the tumult, and others, with fierce
  and strong bits, compelled the frightened or infuriated animals to endure the
  thing they abhorred&mdash;in their wrath and pride forcing them even nearer
  than was necessary. In another quarter, this close-mingled pile of carts and
  horses was surmounted by the enormous heads of elephants, thrust up into the
  air, some of them with their huge lithe trunks lashing and beating (for they,
  too, as you have heard, would rather die than snuff in the breath of these
  monsters of the woods,) while the tiara'd heads of their riders would be seen
  tossed to and fro by their contortions. What a cry of cursing, what cracking
  of whips and cords, what blowing of horns, and whistling and screaming; and
  all this mixed with what roaring and howling from the savage creatures caged
  in darkness!</p>

  <p>I went, however, for a moment, into the Amphitheatre, by a little side-
  way, where admission was cheaply obtained. Here, as yet, all things were in
  order, for the hour had not yet come forgiving the wild beasts entrance to
  the huge dens prepared for them. A few carpenters only were seen in one
  corner, erecting a sort of low stage, and singing merrily, of whom, when I
  made inquiry concerning the purpose of that erection, one of these fellows
  also began to jeer; "Whence come you, good sir, that you do not know a common
  scaffold when you see it? It is surely not the first time that a Christian
  has had his head chopped off in the Flavian?"&mdash;"By Pluto, I am not so
  sure about that matter," quoth another. "I don't know whether any of the dogs
  were ever beheaded here or not; if they have been, I can only say it was
  better than they deserved."&mdash;"There spoke a true man," cries a third.
  "No, no; keep beheading for Romans&mdash;let citizens have their own. Things
  are come to a pretty pass, when they show us nothing but tigers against
  tigers. By Jove, I would rather see one of those misbelieving Atheists set
  right before the mouth of a true Getulian lion's cage, and hear his bones
  cracked ere all be over,&mdash;I say, I would rather see that, than fifty of
  your mere beast fights."&mdash;"After all," rejoined the first, "it must be
  allowed that our Caesar had a fine eye for the Amphitheatre."</p>

  <p>"Who doubts it?" says the other. "Rome has never seen any thing that
  deserved to be called a show, since he was killed by sneaking traitors. They
  say, Nero was still better at that sort of work; but 'let the skin-less Jew
  believe,' as the saying is. I desire to see no better sport than Domitian
  gave us the very week before his death. We shall never live to see his like
  again!". "Come, boys," rejoins one of the rest; "no despairing! I had begun
  to think that these good princes, as they call them, would never show us a
  bit of real sport again. Here, now, is at least something. Who can tell what
  may follow? and, besides, if the worst come to the worst, we shall still have
  lions against lions, tigers against tigers, Dacians against Dacians, and now
  and then a Jew or a Christian, or whatever you please to call him, exhibited
  <i>solus</i> on such a stage as this. Come, come, don't make matters worse
  than they are."</p>

  <p>The ruffians showed that they knew well enough I was displeased, and I
  half regretted, as I strode away from them, the want of that Praetorian
  helmet, which would have preserved me from the insolence of their mirth.
  However, I was well pleased to gain a distance at which I could no longer be
  troubled with them, and walked with rapid steps along the wide streets, over
  which morning was now beginning to shine; while the air, agitated with a
  quick breeze, refreshed my cheeks and temples&mdash;of which I had need,
  being heated with the glare and noise, and, perhaps, faint, too, after the
  manner of the young, from want of sleep.</p>

  <p>I was admitted into the house by Dromo, who seemed to have been looking
  out for me; for he opened the door almost before I had time to knock at it.
  He regarded me as I entered with a very cunning face; insomuch, that I
  comprehended without difficulty, he believed me to have spent the night in
  some scene of debauch; but he, nevertheless, attended me, without saying a
  word, into my chamber. He then assumed a countenance of great reflection, and
  advised me, with much appearance of friendly concern, to go to bed, even
  although I could not stay long there; "because," said he, "you will feel much
  fresher when you get up; and let me tell you, you must be up early, for I
  have already been with Licinius, who intends to send Sextus with a present to
  Rubellia immediately after breakfast; and you may be sure he will insist on
  your company, for he can do nothing without you. Ah! had it not been for u
  certain pretty creature, the young gentleman would not, I am confident, have
  permitted you to be going the rounds in this way by yourself. But I take it
  something amiss, and shall tell him so, that he did not depute me (who am not
  particularly enamoured just at present) to go with you, and take care of your
  safety. I only wonder how you have got home so well as it
  is."&mdash;"Indeed," said I, "good Dromo, I cannot help wondering a little at
  that myself&mdash;for I have been all through the city, and lost my way
  half-a-dozen times over, and yet here you see I am."&mdash;"The more reason,"
  quoth the slave, "that you should send some little offering to Mercury's
  Temple over the way, in the morning&mdash;a few sesterces will be
  sufficient&mdash;and if you have no objections, I shall willingly take care
  of them for you. Mercury is the guardian of all that travel about in the
  dark; and besides, he is the special patron of love expeditions. But to say
  the truth, you are not the only person that owes a gift to that shrine; for
  the worthy sage&mdash;Xerophrastes&mdash;he, too, has been a night- wanderer
  and he has not yet come in. I have my doubts whether, when he does so, he
  will be as sober as you are; but I must take care to be at my post, and admit
  him in silence, for the time is not yet come to uncloak his doings. Trust me,
  this is not the only vagary I have set down to his account all in good time.
  But what says my master Valerius, touching the offering to the great God
  Hermes?"</p>

  <p>I saw, by the knave's face, that it was necessary the sesterces should be
  forthcoming. "Here they are," said I, "good Dromo; and remember, that
  although Mercury, among other things, is the god of thieves also, he will not
  be well pleased if you curtail his offering."&mdash;"Never mind," answered
  the varlet, as he was shuffling out of the room, "Mercury and I understand
  each other of old. Go to bed, and try to get a little of your own old British
  red into your cheeks again; for Licinius has a hawk's eye, and will be sure
  to have his suspicions, if he sees you come down with such a haggard look.
  Remember you have not a beard to cover half your face, and all your
  iniquities."</p>

  <p>So saying, he left me to my couch, indeed, but not to slumber; for busy
  thoughts kept me broad awake, till, after the lapse of perhaps an hour, young
  Sextus entered my apartment, already arrayed with more than usual elegance,
  to execute, however unwillingly, the message of his father. He had in his
  hand a small casket of open ivory-work, which he flung down on my bed,
  saying, "Get up, dear Valerius, and save me at least from the pain of going
  alone with these gew-gaws. Would to Heaven my father would marry her himself,
  and then I should have no objection to carry as many caskets as he pleases.
  But do you get up and assist me; and as we go along, you shall tell me what
  you have seen and heard in company with your jovial Praetorian."</p>

  <p>I was soon ready, and ascended, along with my young friend, the chariot
  which Licinius had commanded to be ready. I told him. as we glided through
  the streets, as much as I judged expedient; and, in particular, when I
  perceived that our charioteer was making a circuit, in order to avoid the
  neighbourhood of the Amphitheatre, I could not help expressing to him the
  effect which had been produced in my mind, by my casual inspection of the
  preparations. "I am afraid, then," said he, "that you will scarcely be
  willing to witness the exhibition itself; and yet I would fain have you to
  overcome your aversion, both because, whatever you may think of such things,
  it is not fitting that you should go from Rome without once, at least, seeing
  how they are conducted; and more particularly, because I much suspect
  Rubellia intends to be present at the festival in which case I should be
  sorry to be compelled to attend upon her without you; and as to leaving her
  at the gate of the Amphitheatre, that, you know, would be quite impossible,
  unless I wished openly to contradict the wishes of my father."</p>

  <p>I assured him he should not want any comfort my presence could afford him;
  although not without, at the same time, expressing my astonishment that he
  should consider it at all probable that his dainty Rubellia would choose to
  sit among the spectators of an exhibition so abounding in circumstances of
  cruelty, and, as I had understood, forbidden to her sex. "Nay," answered he,
  "laws and edicts are made to be broken in such cases; and as for the cruelty
  of the scene, there is scarcely a lady in Rome that would be more scrupulous
  on that head than my widow. To tell you the truth, one of the things that
  makes me most unwilling to go, is the fear that Sempronia also may be there;
  and, perhaps, when she sees me with Rubellia, give credence to some of the
  reports which have been circulated (not without my father's assent, I think,
  if all were known,) about this odious marriage, which I swear to you shall
  never take place, although Licinius were to drive me from his door, and adopt
  a stranger."&mdash;"Sextus," I made answer, "if Sempronia thinks there is any
  thing serious between the widow and you, she must think you a pretty rascal,
  for the violent love you made to herself at the Villa. But I am sure she will
  easily perceive, by your countenance, that you do not regard Rubellia,
  handsome as she is, with any extraordinary admiration; whereas&mdash;if you
  were not conscious of it, I am sure she must have been so&mdash;there was
  never a face of more passionate love than yours, all the time you were in
  <i>her</i> company. And, even now, the very mention of her name calls a glow
  into your cheeks, yes, and even into your eyes, that I think would flatter
  Rubellia, could she excite such another, more than all the jewels of all the
  caskets your father will ever send."" Distract me not, O Valerius! " said the
  youth,&mdash;"distract me not with speaking of that too lovely, and, I fear,
  too scornful girl. Do you not perceive that we have at last struck into the
  Suburra, and are quite near to Rubellia's house?"&mdash;"It is so," said I,
  looking out of the carriage, "and I suspect you are right in thinking she
  means to be present at the Amphitheatre, for there is a crowd of urchins
  about her gate, and I perceive a brilliant group of equipages has attracted
  them. She purposes to go in all her splendour."&mdash;"Good Heavens!" replied
  he, "I believe all the world is to be there. I never passed so many chariots;
  and as for the rabble, see what a stream of heads continues pouring down out
  of every alley. My only hope is, that Rubellia may arrive too late for the
  best situations, and perhaps disdain to witness the spectacle from any
  inferior part of the Amphitheatre; and yet she must have interest, no doubt,
  to have secured good accommodation beforehand."</p>

  <p>We were just in time to meet Rubellia stepping from her portico with a gay
  cluster of attendants. On seeing us, however, she beckoned with her finger,
  and said, "Oh, are you come at last? Well, I must take Valerius with myself,
  for I insist upon it that I shall be best able to point out what is worthy of
  his notice; and you, Sextus Licinius, come you also into my chariot; we will
  not separate you from your Orestes." She said so with an air of sprightly
  ease and indifference, and sprung into the carriage. An elderly lady, with a
  broad merry face, went into it also, but there was still room for Sextus and
  myself; and the rest of the party followed in other vehicles that were
  waiting.</p>

  <p>The crowd by this time had so accumulated, that our horses could not
  advance but at leisurely pace; but the noise of the multitude as they rushed
  along, and the tumult of expectation visible on every countenance, prevented
  us from thinking of any thing but the festival. The variety, however, and
  great splendour of the equipages, could not but attract my attention. Now it
  was an open chariot, drawn by milk-white Thessalian horses, in which reclined
  some gorgeous female, blazing with jewellery, with a cluster of beautiful
  boys or girls administering odours to her nostril; and perhaps some haughty
  Knight or Senator now and then offering the refreshment of his flattery.
  Then, perhaps, would come rumbling along, a close clumsy waggon, of the
  old-fashioned matronly sort, stuck full with some substantial plebeian
  family&mdash;the fat, comfortable-looking citizen, and his demure spouse,
  sitting well back on their cushions, and having their knees loaded with an
  exulting progeny of lads and lasses, whose faces would, every now and then,
  be thrust half out of the window, in spite of the mother's tugging at their
  skirts. And then, again, a cry of "Place, place," and a group of lictors,
  shoving every body aside with their rods, before the litter of some dignified
  magistrate, who, from pride or gout, preferred that species of motion to the
  jolting of a chariot. Such a portly person as this would soon be hurried past
  us, but not before we had time to observe the richness of the silken cushions
  on which he lay extended, or the air of majesty with which he submitted
  himself to the fan of the favoured freedman, whose business it was to keep
  those authoritative cheeks free from the contamination of common dust and
  flies. Anon, a jolly band of young gallants, pushing their steeds along, to
  not a few of whom the fair Rubellia would vouchsafe her salutation.</p>

  <p>But wherever the carriage was stopped for an instant, it was wonderful to
  see the number of old emaciated men, and withered hags, that would make their
  way close up to the windows, imploring wherewithal to obtain a morsel. The
  widow herself leaned back on these occasions, as if to avoid the sight; but
  she pointed to a bag of small coin that hung in a corner of the chariot, and
  from it Sextus distributed to the one side, and I to the other; and yet it
  was impossible to give to every one; we were surrounded all the way with a
  mingled clamour of benedictions from those that had received, and execrations
  from those that had got nothing, and noisy ever-renewed solicitations from
  that ever- swelling army of mendicants. At last, however, we arrived in
  safety at the western gate&mdash;the same around which I had, the night
  before, witnessed such tumultuous preparation. One of the officers in waiting
  there, no sooner descried the equipage, than he caused a space to be laid
  open for its approach, and himself advanced to hand Rubellia into the
  interior, but she whispered to Sextus and me, by no means to separate from
  her in the crowd.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch110"
     name="ch110">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BEHOLD me, therefore, in the midst of the Flavian
  Amphitheatre, and seated, under the wing of the luxurious Rubellia, in a very
  convenient situation. There was a general silence in the place, because
  proclamation had just been made that the gladiators, with whose combats the
  exhibition was to commence, were about to enter upon the arena, and show
  themselves in order to the people. As yet, however, they had not come forth
  from that place of concealment to which so many of their number would never
  return; so that I had leisure to collect my thoughts, and survey for a
  moment, without disturbance, the mighty and most motley multitude, piled
  above, below, and on every side around me, from the lordly senators, on their
  silken couches, along the parapet of the arena, up to the impenetrable mass
  of plebeian heads which skirted the horizon, above the topmost wall of the
  Amphitheatre itself. Such was the enormous crowd of human beings, high and
  low, that when any motion went through their assembly, the noise of their
  rising up or sitting down might be likened to the sullen roaring of the sea,
  or the rushing of a great night-wind in a forest. Not less than eighty
  thousand human beings, they told me, were here met together.</p>

  <p>Such a multitude could no where be regarded, without inspiring a certain
  indefinable sense of majesty; least of all, when congregated within the wide
  sweep of such a glorious edifice, and surrounded on all sides with every
  circumstance of ornament and splendour, befitting an everlasting monument of
  Roman victory and imperial munificence. Judge, then, with what eyes all this
  was surveyed by me, who had but of yesterday emerged from a British
  valley&mdash;who had been accustomed all my life to consider as among the
  most impressive of spectacles, the casual passage of a few scores of
  legionaries through some dark alley of a wood, or awe-struck village of
  barbarians.</p>

  <p>Trajan himself was already present&mdash;his ivory chair distinguished
  only by its canopy from that of the other Consul who sat over against him;
  tall and majestic in his demeanour; grave, sedate, and benign in countenance,
  as you have seen in his medals and statues. He was arrayed in a plain gown,
  and appeared to converse quite familiarly, without affectation of
  condescension, with such Patricians as had their places near him; among whom
  Sextus and Rubellia pointed out many remarkable personages to my notice; as
  Adrian, afterwards emperor; Pliny, the orator, a man of courtly presence, and
  lively, agreeable aspect; and, above all, the historian Tacitus, the worthy
  son-in-law of our Agricola, in whose pallid countenance I could easily
  recognize the depth, but sought in vain to discover any traces of the
  sternness of his genius. Of all the then proud names that were whispered into
  my ear, could I recollect or repeat them now, how few would awaken any
  interest in your minds! Those, indeed, which I have mentioned, have an
  interest that will never die. Would that the greatest and the best of them
  all were to be remembered only for deeds of greatness and goodness!</p>

  <p>The proclamation being repeated a second time, a door on the right hand of
  the arena was laid open, and a single trumpet sounded, as it seemed to me,
  mournfully, while the gladiators marched in with slow steps, each
  man&mdash;naked, except being girt with a cloth about his loins&mdash;bearing
  on his left arm a small buckler, and having a short straight sword suspended
  by a cord around his neck. They marched, as I have said, slowly and steadily;
  so that the whole assembly had full leisure to contemplate the forms of the
  men; while those skilled in such business were fixing, in their own minds, on
  such as they thought most likely to be victorious, and laying wagers
  concerning their chances of success, with as much unconcern as if they had
  been contemplating irrational animals, or rather, indeed, I should say, so
  many pieces of ingenious mechanism. The diversity of complexion and feature
  exhibited among these devoted athletes, afforded at once a majestic idea of
  the extent of the empire, and a terrible one of the purposes to which that
  wide sway had often been made subservient. The beautiful Greek, with a
  countenance of noble serenity, and limbs after which the sculptors of his
  country might have modelled their symbols of graceful power, walked side by
  side with the yellow-bearded savage, whose gigantic muscles had been nerved
  in the freezing waves of the Elbe or Ister, or whose thick strong hair was
  congealed and shagged on his brow with the breath of Scythian or Scandinavian
  winters. Many fierce Moors and Arabs, and curled Ethiopians, were there, with
  the beams of the southern sun burnt in every various shade of swarthiness
  upon their skins. Nor did our own remote island want her representatives in
  the deadly procession, for I saw among the armed multitude&mdash;not surely
  without some feelings of more peculiar interest&mdash;two or three gaunt
  barbarians, whose breasts and shoulders bore uncouth marks of blue and
  purple, so vivid in the tints, that I thought many months -could not have
  elapsed since they must have been wandering in wild freedom along the native
  ridges of some Silurian or Caledonian forest. As they moved around the arena,
  some of these men were saluted by the whole multitude with noisy
  acclamations, in token, I suppose, of the approbation wherewith the feats of
  some former festival had deserved to be remembered. On the appearance of
  others, groans and hisses were heard from some parts of the Amphitheatre,
  mixed with contending cheers and huzzas from others of the spectators. But by
  far the greater part were suffered to pass on in silence&mdash;this being in
  all likelihood&mdash;the first who could tell whether it might not also be
  the last day of their sharing in that fearful exhibition!</p>

  <p>Their masters paired them shortly, and in succession they began to make
  proof of their fatal skill. At first, Scythian was matched against
  Scythian&mdash;Greek against Greek&mdash;Ethiopian against
  Ethiopian&mdash;Spaniard against Spaniard; and I saw the sand dyed beneath
  their feet with blood streaming from the wounds of kindred hands. But these
  combats, although abundantly bloody and terrible, were regarded only as
  preludes to the serious business of the day, which consisted of duels between
  Europeans on the one side, and Africans on the other; wherein it was the
  well-nigh intransgressible law of the Amphitheatre, that at least one out of
  every pair of combatants should die. Instead of shrinking from these more
  desperate brutalities, the almost certainty of their termination seemed only
  to make the assembly gaze on them with a more intense curiosity and delight.
  Methinks I feel as if it were but of yesterday, when,&mdash;sickened with the
  protracted terrors of a conflict, that seemed as if it were never to have an
  end, although both the combatants were already covered all over with hideous
  gashes,&mdash;I at last bowed down my head, and clasped my hands upon my
  eyes. I had scarcely done so, when Rubellia laid her hand upon my elbow,
  whispering, "Look, look, now look," in a voice of low, steady impatience. I
  did look, but not to the arena: No; it was upon the beautiful features of
  that woman's face that I looked, and truly it seemed to me as if they
  presented a spectacle almost as fearful. I saw those rich lips parted, those
  dark eyes extended, those smooth cheeks suffused with a steadfast blush, that
  lovely bosom swelled and glowing; and I hated Rubellia, for I knew not before
  how utterly beauty can be brutalized by the throbbings of a cruel heart. But
  I looked round to escape from the sight of her;&mdash;and the hundreds of
  females that I saw fixed with equal earnestness on the same horrors, taught
  me, even at the moment, to think with more charity of that pitiless gaze of
  one.</p>

  <p>At that instant all were silent in contemplation of the breathless strife;
  insomuch, that a groan, the first that had escaped from either of the
  combatants, although low and suppressed, sounded distinctly amidst the deep
  hush, and being constrained to turn once more downwards, I beheld that, at
  length, one of the two had received the sword of his adversary quite through
  his body, and had sunk upon the sand. A beautiful young man was he that had
  received this harm, with fair hair, clustered in glossy ringlets upon his
  neck and brows; but the sickness of his wound was already visible on his
  drooping eye-lids, and his lips were pale, as if the blood had rushed from
  them to the untimely outlet. Nevertheless, the Moorish gladiator who had
  fought with him had drawn forth again his weapon, and stood there awaiting in
  silence the decision, whether at once to slay the defenceless youth, or to
  assist in removing him from the arena, if perchance the blood might be
  stopped from flowing, and some hope of recovery even yet extended. There
  arose, on the instant, a loud voice of contention; and it seemed to me as if
  the wounded man regarded the multitude with a proud, contemptuous glance,
  being aware, without question, that he had executed all things so as to
  deserve their compassion, but aware, moreover, that even had that been freely
  vouchsafed to him, it was too late. But the cruelty of their faces, it may
  be, and the loudness of their cries, were a sorrow to him, and filled his
  dying breast with loathing. Whether or not the haughtiness of his countenance
  had been observed by them with displeasure, I cannot say; but those who had
  cried out to give him a chance of recovery, were speedily silent, and Caesar
  looking round, and seeing all the thumbs turned downwards, was constrained to
  give the sign, and forthwith the young man, receiving again without a
  struggle the sword of the Moor into his gashed bosom, breathed forth his
  life, and lay stretched out in his blood upon the place of guilt. With that a
  joyous clamour was uplifted by many of those that looked upon it, and the
  victorious Moor, being crowned with an ivy garland, was carried in procession
  around the arena by certain young men, who leaped down for that purpose from
  the midst of the assembly. In the meantime, those that had the care of such
  things, dragged away, with a filthy hook, the corpse of him that had been
  slain; and then, raking up the sand over the blood that had fallen from him,
  prepared the place, with indifferent countenances, for some other
  tragedy,&mdash;while all around me, the spectators were seen rising from
  their places, and saluting each other; and there was a buzz of talking as
  universal as the silence had been during the combat; some speaking of this
  thrust and that ward, and paying and receiving money lost and won; some
  already discoursing of other matters, as if nothing uncommon had been
  witnessed; while others, again, appeared to be entirely occupied with the
  martial music which ever struck up majestically at such pauses, beating time
  upon the benches before them, or joining their voices with the proud notes of
  the trumpets and clarions. Rubellia talked gaily with Sextus, inviting him to
  ridicule me with her, for the strangeness of behaviour I had displayed.</p>

  <p>The sun, by this, had already mounted high in the heavens, and the glare
  became so intolerable, that men could no longer fight on equal terms; which
  being perceived, Caesar gave command to look after the wild beasts, and, in
  the meantime, (for I heard his voice distinctly,) to give warning to the
  Flamens that they should have their altar set forth.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch111"
     name="ch111">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">UPON this, Trajan, with those immediately about his person,
  withdrew; but Rubellia told me he had only gone to the Palatine by the
  subterraneous path, for the purpose of taking some refreshment, and that
  there was no doubt he would return in time to witness the rest of the
  spectacle. This example, however, was followed in some sort by a great part
  of the spectators, for some departed altogether from the Amphitheatre, while
  many more were seen moving from place to place, crossing from one vomitory to
  another, and paying their respects to different parties of friends, who had
  occupied places at a distance from them during the combats. In the meantime,
  servants of Trajan's household were observed giving directions in the arena
  to a great number of persons, who afterwards began to distribute baskets of
  dried fish, bread, and other eatables, among such as chose to accept of them;
  while viands of a more costly description were introduced among the wealthy,
  by slaves and freedmen of their own. Neither were the bearers of water-jars
  idle, nor the street hawkers of fruit; least of all, those whose traffic is
  in snow, of whom, I believe, hundreds were scrambling in all quarters over
  the benches, whistling shrilly, as is their method, to announce the article
  in which they dealt.</p>

  <p>The Lady Rubellia was not one of those who would ever leave her friends
  destitute of the means of refreshment on such an occasion as this; and
  accordingly two or three of her household were soon with us, bearing jars of
  sweet-meats, baskets of fruit, flasks of wine, with other appurtenances of a
  luxurious collation. We had scarcely begun to taste of these things, when our
  attention was attracted by some one striding, with great activity, from one
  row of benches to another behind us, and looking round, I discovered the rosy
  countenance of Sabinus, whose anxiety to join us was, as I immediately
  suspected, the cause of this exertion. An ordinary person would have sought
  some circuitous method of approach, rather than attempt the sheer descent
  from one of the stone parapets which rose immediately in our rear; but the
  brawny limbs of the Centurion shrunk not from that adventurous leap, and, in
  a word, I soon found him seated beside us, bowing and smiling to Rubellia
  with his usual mixture of boldness and suavity. He delayed not from
  participation in her delicacies; but lifting a goblet of Falernian, drank
  down, without stopping, till he could see the foundation of its interior
  gold. His fingers also soon became acquainted with the receptacles of fruit
  and confectionary; and I was half-inclined to some suspicion, that he might
  perhaps have remained in his original situation, had he not chanced to
  observe the slaves of Rubellia, as they came up the vomitory, with their
  comely-looking, napkin-covered baskets upon their heads. As it was, his
  arrival was acceptable, except perhaps to Rubellia, who I thought looked as
  if she were not overmuch pleased with the interruption his mirthful talk
  occasioned to the conversation on which she had been endeavouring to fix the
  attention of young Licinius.</p>

  <p>For that, however, another interruption had been already prepared in
  another part of the assembly, from which our Xerophrastes also had taken
  cognizance of our position. There was such a crowd, however, immediately
  below us, that I know not whether the philosopher would ever have been able
  to make his way to the region where we sat, had it not been that we heard his
  voice in disputation, and entreated those that opposed his passage, if
  possible, to make room for him. The first glimpse we had of his countenance,
  showed us that the squeeze had been giving him serious inconvenience, for the
  drops of perspiration stood visible on his bald front. The persons whom he
  was addressing, however, seemed to listen with such unconcern, that it was
  impossible not to feel somewhat displeased with them, for treating so
  disrespectfully one whom his venerable aspect might have entitled to more
  courtesy. In vain did he represent to them, (for we heard his strong voice
  distinctly every now and then,) that it was not for the sake of any personal
  ease or convenience he was desirous of penetrating into an upper part. In
  vain did he reiterate " My pupil"&mdash;"my disciple"&mdash;"my young
  scholar, Sextus Licinius"&mdash;"the son of Caius Licinius"&mdash;"the son of
  the great orator Caius Licinius is there." In vain did he enlarge upon the
  constancy of attention which philosophers owe to those who are placed by the
  hands of parents under their superintendence. No sooner, however, did Sextus
  and I begin to show the interest we took in his situation, than Sabinus
  raised himself up on the bench, and called aloud on those that surrounded the
  Stoic, with a voice of much sternness and authority, to let him pass
  immediately at their peril.</p>

  <p>Many eyes were forthwith turned towards us; and whether it were the
  dignity and haughtiness of the Centurion's voice and attitude, or that his
  garb alone gave him much weight in the assembly, the resistance was relaxed,
  and Xerophrastes enjoyed an opportunity of almost entirely recovering his
  usual serenity of aspect before he reached us. The first thing he did was to
  accept of a cup which I held out to him, and then with much courtesy did he
  thank us all, but most the Centurion, for the part he had taken in working
  out his deliverance from the hands, as he expressed it, of those inhuman and
  illiterate persons; "while you," he continued, "brave warrior, have shown
  that in your breast, as in that of Epaminondas&mdash;of Alexander&mdash;and
  of your own Julius&mdash;the reverence of the muses, and of divine
  philosophy, does not disdain to inhabit with the ardour of active patriotism,
  and the spirit-stirring delights of Mars."</p>

  <p>"As for that," said Rubellia, with a smile, "all the world knows that
  Sabinus is quite a philosopher&mdash;he was just beginning a very learned
  harangue when we were attracted by your voice in the crowd; and you have the
  more reason to thank him, because he was cut very unseasonably short, in
  consequence of the distress in which we perceived you."</p>

  <p>"Most noble lady!" replied the Stoic, "you know not how much you have
  delighted me; from the first moment, indeed, that my eyes rested upon the
  countenance of your heroic friend, I suspected that he had subjected himself
  to some other discipline besides that of camps. I saw the traces of thought,
  lady&mdash;and serious contemplation. The mind can never exercise its
  faculties, without conveying some symptoms of those internal operations to
  the external surface of the visage. The soul can never energize habitually,
  without betraying its activity in the delicacy and acumen, which the more
  elegant and susceptible parts of the corporeal frame acquire during those
  elaborate and mysterious processes of thought. I saw, therefore, and
  suspected. But what thanks are not due to you, for having so agreeably
  confirmed me in this happy suspicion! Of a surety, the noise and tumult of
  the camp is not so well adapted for the theoretic or contemplative life, as
  perfect leisure and retirement; yet, who shall doubt that the soul of great
  energy can overcome all such disadvantages? Who shall think that the spirit
  of Socrates did not eagerly philosophize during the campaign he served? Who
  shall say that the Stagyrite must have suspended his acute, although
  imperfect investigations, even although he had accompanied his royal pupil
  across the Hellespont, and attended all the motions of his victorious army,
  instead of staying at home to teach the youth of Greece? Who, finally," said
  he, casting his courteous eyes full on the Praetorian, "shall suspect but
  that this generous warrior has been effectually advancing the growth of
  philosophic science, within his own mind at least, if not composing works, in
  his intervals of leisure, destined hereafter to benefit and instruct the
  world, even although he may have been attending the flight of the Eagle from
  utmost Britain to the desert frontiers of the Parthian?"&mdash;"Nobody,
  indeed," replied the sportive lady, "nobody, indeed, who has enjoyed any
  opportunity of being acquainted with the Centurion, can have any doubt on
  that head.&mdash;Sabinus," she continued, turning towards him, "what treatise
  are you at present engaged with? Come, now, speak out, and truly; are you
  still busy with your '<i>Concerning The Nature Of The Bacchic Stimulus</i>'
  that you were quoting from the other night?&mdash;or are you deep in '<i>The
  Delight of Contemplation</i>'?&mdash;or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," quoth the Centurion, interrupting her; "I am only deep in
  <i>love</i>&mdash;" Saying so, he laid his hand in a very tender fashion upon
  his breast, and even, as I thought, began to throw a little sentiment into
  his eyes; but he had no opportunity of going on with his speech, for
  Xerophrastes had no sooner heard him utter the word <i>love</i>, than he
  immediately began to pour out a new rhapsody.</p>

  <p>"Love!" quoth he; "Ha! love:&mdash;in good sooth, a noble subject, and one
  concerning which not a few laudable treatises have been composed. Yet,
  without question, much remains to be done in this matter; and I should be
  most proud if the illustrious Sabinus would vouchsafe to me a perusal of his
  speculations. Without question," he continued, "you have commenced with a
  proper definition and division of the subject. You have distinguished betwixt
  what is properly called <i>love</i>, and the other more or less kindred
  affections, with which hallucinating writers have too often committed the
  error of confounding it. You have described, in the first place, the
  difference between it and the <i>storg</i> or natural affection which
  parents have for their offspring&mdash;an affection in which not a few of the
  irrational tribes appear (if physiologists may be trusted) to be even
  superior to the human race."&mdash;"Hens, for example," quoth the Centurion,
  with a face of infinite gravity. "Even so&mdash;<i>hens</i>," continued the
  sage; "an apt illustration.&mdash;I perceive, indeed, lady," whispered he to
  Rubellia, "that you have not deceived me concerning the attainments of this
  your noble friend.&mdash;Hens&mdash;a most acute illustration! See you now,
  Sextus!" he went on, "it is not the characteristic of true philosophy to
  despise those illustrations which are drawn from the affairs of ordinary
  life, and the common surfaces of things. No: it is rather her part to show
  forth her own intrinsic excellence and splendour, by raising that which is in
  itself low and customary, to unexpected dignity, by her methods of felicitous
  application. See you, now, with what unexampled skill this hero&mdash;this
  philosopher, I should rather say&mdash;may I presume to add, this brother
  philosopher?&mdash;has illustrated the nature of love in this treatise of
  his, by introducing the domestic habits of your common household fowl. Such
  things should not pass unheeded by the young aspirants to learning, because
  these, more than any other circumstances, may furnish them with encouragement
  to proceed in their course, by showing how many of the materials of
  philosophy lie everywhere under the eyes of the most common traveller of the
  path of life; and how assuredly it is the fault of the individual himself, if
  he neglect the means of spiritual advancement, which are sure to be afforded
  in whatever situation may chance to have been assigned to him."</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon for interrupting you," said Rubellia; "but Sabinus has
  almost finished the grapes while you have been speaking; and I would only
  just beg to suggest, that it is the fault of the individual, Xerophrastes, if
  he neglects the means of corporeal refreshment, which may yet be afforded to
  him by what remains in the basket."</p>

  <p>"Most kind lady," resumed he, "your benevolence is worthy of your
  nobility.&mdash;But you know not how much the philosophy I have embraced,
  tends to lessen the natural desire of man for such things as you allude
  to&mdash;nevertheless," he continued, "I will not refuse to partake yet
  farther of your bounty; for I have been sorely dealt with in the multitude,
  as yourselves witnessed."</p>

  <p>So saying, he took hold of the basket, and began to feel in the bottom of
  it, but found very little to his purpose; for, to say the truth, the rest of
  the party had been almost as eager in their attentions to it as the
  Centurion. A few slender bunches, notwithstanding, were still there, one of
  which the philosopher thrust into his mouth, and the rest he concealed
  beneath one of the folds of his huge mantle, until he should have made an end
  of his criticism. Meantime, the natural language of the broad, jovial,
  unreflective countenance of our worthy Centurion, seemed considerably at
  variance from the notion of his attainments and pursuits, which this merry
  lady had been instilling into the pedagogue. Rubellia herself, however,
  appeared to enjoy the thing far more keenly than either Sextus or I;
  insomuch, that I was afraid Xerophrastes would penetrate through the joke she
  was playing off upon him, before he had given himself his full swing in
  commendation of the Praetorian. But Sabinus, on his side, was, as it seemed,
  of opinion, that he had already heard enough of such disquisitions; for he
  had scarcely seen out the last cup of Falernian, ere he began to give hints
  that he wished very much to descend into the arena, for the purpose of
  observing the animals about to be exhibited, while they were yet in their
  cages. Xerophrastes, however, even when he had heard him signify this desire,
  appeared still to be resolved on considering him as one of the philosophic
  order of mankind; for he at once offered to accompany him, saying, that the
  visit was of course intended for the gratification of some scientific
  curiosity, and that therefore he should think himself culpable did he neglect
  the opportunity.</p>

  <p>"Come, then," quoth the good-natured Sabinus, "by all means prepare
  yourself for the descent; but at least allow me to precede you, that there
  may be no risk of untimely obstructions."&mdash;"Most assuredly, noble
  Centurion," replied Xerophrastes, "in this, as in all things, I shall be
  proud to be enumerated among your followers. My pupil, also," he added, "and
  his friend, will no doubt accompany us, that they may benefit by our
  discourse on whatever may be subjected to observation."&mdash;"Venerated
  friend," said Rubellia, "would you leave the ladies by themselves in the
  midst of the Amphitheatre? I hope Sextus Licinius, at least, will consider
  our weakness, and remain for our protection."</p>

  <p>She laid her hand on my companion's arm, with a look which was decisive.
  Her ancient crony whispered something about the impropriety of leaving only
  one of the party to attend upon two females; but I took advantage of her low
  tone to pretend ignorance of that hint, and rose with the Centurion.</p>

  <p>"Go quickly," said Sextus, "for the interval must be well-nigh at an end;
  and if those that have gone out begin to rush in again, you may have
  difficulty in regaining your places."&mdash;"Give fear to the winds," quoth
  Sabinus; "am not I with them, that know every lion- feeder in Rome? No chance
  of the exhibition recommencing without my having sufficient warning. It is
  not for nothing that I have lost and won so many thousand sesterces in the
  Amphitheatre. Would to Hercules as much respect were paid to experience every
  where else, as in the Arena to your true old Better. Already, I perceive that
  half a dozen of those knowing characters down below, about the entrances to
  the dens, have detected me. They must fancy my purse is in a poor state
  indeed, when I don't seem to think it worth while to take even a single peep
  at the cages. Come, worthy brother in philosophy, and you, my fellow-voyager,
  let us be alert, lest we arrive after Plataea."</p>

  <p>We obeyed with due alacrity, and, leaving the reluctant Sextus to his
  fate, touched presently the margin of the arena. We had no sooner arrived
  there, than an old skin-dried limping Numidian, with a bit of lion's hide
  fastened round his loins&mdash;one who, from his leanness and blackness, had
  very much the appearance of having been baked to a cinder, drew to the
  Centurion, with many nods and significant grins of recognition. Sabinus, on
  his part, seemed noways backward to acknowledge this acquaintance; but, on
  the contrary, began to talk volubly with him in a strange sort of broken
  dialect, chiefly composed, as I afterwards learned, of Punic vocables. After
  this had lasted some minutes, he took Xerophrastes and me by the hand, and
  seemed to introduce us to the Numidian, who then desired us all to come down,
  and he would conduct us to a place where we should see something not unworthy
  of being seen. About to follow these directions, I felt my gown seized from
  behind, and looking round, observed that it was my faithful Briton, who, from
  the heat and confusion of his aspect, appeared not to have come thither
  without a considerable struggle. Sabinus seeing him, said, "Ah! my old friend
  Boto, how have you come to this part of the Amphitheatre? We must not leave
  you behind us, however: Of a surety, you have never seen a lion&mdash;you
  shall descend along with your master; and who knows but we may persuade
  Xerophrastes that you also are a brother philosopher?"&mdash;"Most noble
  Centurion," replied the grateful slave, "I saw you and my master from the
  very topmost bench, where I have been sitting for these three hours with
  Dromo, and I was determined to draw near to you, if it were possible. To go
  from this place up to yonder quarter would perhaps be impossible; but it is
  never a very difficult matter to go down in this world; so, saving your
  reverence, I trundled myself over the benches, and when heads were in my way,
  I trundled myself over them too."&mdash;"It is well, good Briton," quoth the
  Centurion&mdash;by this time we had crossed the arena&mdash;"and now prepare
  to exercise your eyes as well as you already have exercised your limbs; for
  know, that very near to you is the abode of nobler animals than even your
  lord hath ever observed."</p>

  <p>With this the African opened one of the iron doors edging the arena, and
  having received some money, admitted us to the sight of a long flight of
  marble steps, which appeared to descend into the bowels of the earth, far
  below the foundation of the Amphitheatre. "Come along, masters," quoth he;
  "we had better go down this way, for we shall have a better view of the
  animals so, than on the other side. My master, Sabinus, will tell you all,
  that old Aspar knows as much about these things as any Numidian in the
  place."&mdash;"Indeed, since friend Bisbal is gone," quoth the Centurion,
  "there is not another of these that is to be compared to you."&mdash;"Ah!"
  replied Aspar, "Bisbal was a great man; there is not a feeder in Rome that is
  worthy to tie the latchet of his sandals, if he were alive."&mdash;"Why, as
  to that," said the other, "old Bisbal was very seldom worth a pair of sandals
  worth the tying, when he was alive; but, come on, we have no great leisure
  for talking now, and Aspar shall show a lion with any Bisbal that ever
  wielded whip.&mdash;Come on."</p>

  <p>We soon reached a large vaulted place, apparently below the Amphitheatre,
  the sides of which were almost entirely covered with iron-
  gratings,&mdash;while up and down the open space were strolling many strange
  groups of men, connected in different capacities with the bloody spectacles
  of the arena. On one hand, we saw some of the gladiators, who had already
  been combating, walking to and fro with restless and agitated steps, as if
  they had not yet been able to recover themselves from the excitement into
  which their combats had thrown them. Even of such as had been victorious, I
  observed that not a few partook in all these symptoms of uneasiness; and the
  contrast thus exhibited to the haughty mien of calmness they had so lately
  been displaying, affected me with a strange sense of the irrational and
  inhuman life these unhappy persons were condemned by folly or necessity to
  lead. The blood had forsaken the lips and cheeks of others, and from the
  fixed stare of their eyes, it appeared that their minds were entirely
  withdrawn from every thing passing around them. Their limbs, so recently
  nerved to the utmost show of vigour, were now relaxed and unstrung, and they
  trod the marble floor with heavy and straggling feet. But they that appeared
  to me to be in the most wretched state, were such as, they told us, expected
  to be led forth shortly to contend with the wild beasts, in whose immediate
  vicinity they were now walking. The summons to battle with a human opponent
  calls into action the fierceness and the pride of man; but he that has to
  fight with a beast, how should he not be weighed down with the sense of
  mortal degradation; how should the Reason that is in him not fill him, in
  such a prospect, with dispiriting and humbling, rather than with
  strengthening and stimulating thoughts? Howbeit, the Centurion, although the
  most good-natured of mankind, being rendered from custom quite callous to
  these things, immediately entered into conversation with some of those
  unfortunates, in a tone of coolness and unconcern that shocked me the more,
  because it did not seem in the smallest degree to shock them. Among other
  topics, he enlarged at much length to one of them upon the best method of
  evading the attack of a tiger.</p>

  <p>"Look ye now," said he, "there are some that are always for taking things,
  as they call it, in good time,&mdash;these will be pointing their swords
  before the creature makes his spring; but I have seen what comes of that, and
  so has old Aspar here, if he would be honest enough to confess it. The true
  way is to watch his eye when he is setting; let him fairly fix upon his mark,
  and spring; but at the moment when he is taking his leap, then is the time
  for the gladiator to start aside, and have at him with a side-thrust. Your
  side-thrust is the only one I would lay an <i>as</i> upon."&mdash;"Yea,"
  quoth the grinning Aspar, "it was always on your cool steady side-thrust, the
  moment he had sprung, that the great Bisbal used to stake himself. Ha! ha! I
  was fond of the side-thrust in my day myself; but I got a scratch once
  witness my poor leg, masters, and since then I am a poor feeder."&mdash;"I
  was always clear for the side-thrust," quoth Sabinus. "I never saw it fail
  but twice, and then, to be sure, the men died; but they could have had no
  chance at all with the front- guard; and it is always something," continued
  he, clapping one of the poor expecting gladiators on the back, "it is always
  something to have a chance. Be sure you try him with the side-thrust, if it
  come to your turn to-day."</p>

  <p>The poor creature&mdash;he also was an African&mdash;lifted up his head on
  being so addressed, and showed all his white teeth in a melancholy attempt at
  a smile; but said not a word in reply, and forthwith became as downcast as
  before. But the Centurion took little or no heed of the manner in which his
  advice had been received. He contemplated the man's figure for a moment, as
  if to form some judgment concerning the measure of his strength; and after
  doing the like in regard to some of his companions, commanded Aspar to show
  us where the prime lions of the day were reposing.</p>

  <p>The Numidian seized a long pole that was leaning against one of the
  pillars of the vault, and led us to a certain part of the grated wall, behind
  which was the den, wherein six monstrous Atlantic lions were kept. I looked
  in upon them with wonder, and not without dread, through the iron net-work of
  the doors. An imperfect gleam of light descended from above upon their tawny
  hides and glaring eyes. They, like the gladiators, seemed also to be
  preparing for the combat; but not like them in fear, nor in cold dewy
  tremors; for the deprivation of food, which they had been made to suffer in
  prospect of the exhibition, had roused all the energies of their savage
  natures; insomuch, that a sulky and yearning rage seemed to spread through
  every nerve and sinew of their gigantic frames, and to make them paw their
  quadrangular prison with long and pliant strides. They moved, however, as yet
  in total silence; so that Boto having fixed his eyes upon them, took courage
  to approach the grate,&mdash;slowly, nevertheless, and with a face that
  appeared to lengthen an inch for every inch he advanced. But when he had
  almost touched the bars, one of the huge lions came forward towards him, with
  something between a growl and a sigh, which made Boto spring backward with
  great and surprising agility, and with such force, that both he and
  Xerophrastes, who happened unfortunately to have been standing a little way
  behind him, were overthrown at all their length upon the floor.</p>

  <p>The Centurion, and the limping old keeper, burst into laughter; but
  Xerophrastes rising, and shaking his garment, said, with some warmth, "Think
  not, O Sabinus, that any sudden start of fear has thus ridiculously stretched
  me upon the floor; but attribute the mischance only to this rude offspring of
  British earth, whose unreclaimed natural feelings are still shamefully
  affected by natural causes."&mdash;"Castor and Pollux," quoth the Centurion,
  "you take every thing too seriously, my friend."&mdash;"I take it not
  seriously," replied he, with admirable gravity. "My philosophy forbids me to
  do so; it has steeled me against externals."&mdash;"Has it so, in faith!"
  rejoined the Centurion. "I think some of your equanimity is, in fact, owing
  to the trifling circumstance, that you have in reality received no injury
  whatever from your tumble. And as to steeling, let me tell you, I think the
  iron in the grated door there is much better placed, than in the bosom of a
  philosopher; for, in the door, it serves the purpose of preventing all harm;
  but if these animals were once out, all the mental steel of which you boast
  would not save every bone in your body from being cracked in the twanging of
  a bow-string."&mdash;"You speak," replied Xerophrastes, "as if you had
  embraced the tenets of a sect not worthy of the lovers of wisdom&mdash;You
  speak as if the artificial contrivances of human workmen were all in all. An
  iron cage may confine wild beasts; but can cages be made for all those
  misfortunes to which mankind are liable, and against which the force of the
  mind is their only means of defence? Can you cage the Eumenides, when they
  come to avenge a life spent in ignoble indolence and degrading
  luxury?"&mdash;"In truth," replied the Centurion with a smile, "I have never
  seen the Eumenides except once, and that was in the theatre of Athens. But
  Boto, perhaps, has been more fortunate. Did you ever see the Eumenides, good
  Boto?"&mdash;"No, master," replied, stupidly, the perplexed Boto, "I never
  was at the theatre."</p>

  <p>"Ye gods!" exclaimed the Stoic, "of a surety this Britain must have been
  the last spot rescued from the dominion of Chaos!"</p>

  <p>But while we were yet contemplating those enormous animals, and amused
  with the awkward gestures of Boto, the trumpets were blown in the
  Amphitheatre, and no sooner did the sound of them penetrate into the vaults,
  than it was evident, from the bustle which ensued, that the Emperor had
  returned to his place. With all speed, therefore, did we reascend to the
  upper air, leaving the gladiators in the act of mustering in their respective
  quarters of the gloomy vault; and the feeders not less busied in preparing
  their beasts for the expected combat. Had we not been under the protection of
  Sabinus, we should have attempted in vain to regain our places; but he being
  an acknowledged and current authority, known in every department of the
  Amphitheatre, the door- keepers, and other functionaries, durst refuse him
  nothing; room was made for us where no room appeared; and, in a word, we
  shortly found ourselves once more seated by the side of Rubellia and
  Sextus.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch112"
     name="ch112">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE day was by this time considerably advanced; and, in
  spite of the awnings spread all over head, the rays of the sun were so
  powerful, that the marble benches felt hot to the touch, wherever they were
  exposed to them; and altogether there was such a glare and fervour throughout
  the place, that my eyes began to be weary of gazing; and very gladly would I
  have retired, rather than remain to see out the rest of the exhibition.
  Nevertheless, there was no appearance of any one having gone away in
  weariness; but, on the contrary, the seats, and even the passages, seemed to
  be more crowded than they had been in the anterior part of the morning.</p>

  <p>The arena was vacant, when I looked down upon it; but in a short time, a
  single old man, who, as Rubellia told me, had, without doubt, been found
  guilty of some atrocious wickedness, was led forth from a small wicket on the
  one side, and presently his fetters being struck off, those that conducted
  him retired, leaving him alone upon the sand. The eyes of this malefactor
  refused at first to look steadfastly on the objects around him, and it seemed
  to me that he had probably been long confined in some dark place, so
  grievously did the dazzling splendour, reflected from the floor and walls,
  appear to bewilder and confound him. Nevertheless, after a brief space, he
  seemed in some measure to recover himself, and assumed a posture of
  resignation, leaning with one hand against the parapet, as if he needed
  support to uphold himself. Pallid and extenuated were the outlines of the old
  man's visage, and his hair and beard exhibited not a little of the
  squalidness attendant on long confinement; yet there was something in the
  attitude, and even in the countenance, which made me harbour the suspicion
  that he had not, at some former period, been altogether unacquainted with the
  luxuries and refinements of social life. The beauty, indeed, of the mould in
  which his form had originally been cast, might, perhaps, have been the sole
  cause of these casual demonstrations of elegance; yet it was impossible not
  to regard the man with greater interest, by reason of the contrast suggested
  between what he once perhaps had been, and what he now was.</p>

  <p>A feeling of the same sort seemed to pervade many more in the assembly;
  and I heard a continual whispering among those around me, as if there was a
  general anxiety to learn something of the history of the man, No one,
  however, appearing to be able to say any thing concerning this, I kept my
  eyes fixed upon himself, awaiting the issue in silence. Judge then, what was
  my surprise, when one of the heralds of Trajan, having commanded that there
  should be silence in the amphitheatre, said, "Let Tisias of Antioch come
  forth, and answer to the things that shall be alleged against him." To which
  the old man, that was alone in the arena, immediately made reply,&mdash;"Here
  am I&mdash;my name is Tisias of Antioch."&mdash;In vain, however, even after
  hearing the well-remembered voice, did I attempt to persuade myself that the
  face was such as I had pictured within myself; for, as to seeing it, I have
  already told you that utter darkness prevailed in the dungeon all the time I
  was there with him.</p>

  <p>Then arose the Prefect of the city, who had his place immediately under
  the chair of Caesar, and said in a voice, which, although not loud, was heard
  distinctly all through the Amphitheatre,&mdash;"Tisias of Antioch, being
  accused of blasphemy and contempt for the Gods, has been brought hither,
  either to refute this charge, by doing homage at the altar of Jupiter Best
  and Greatest; or, persisting in his rebellion, to suffer openly the
  punishment which the laws have affixed to such perversity. Let him remain
  where he is until the Flamens invite all to join in the sacrifice."</p>

  <p>Tisias, hearing these words, stept forth into the middle of the arena, and
  folding his arms upon his breast, stood there composedly, without once
  lifting up his eyes, either to the place from which the Prefect had spoken,
  or to any other region of the Amphitheatre. The situation in which he stood
  was such, that I commanded, where I sat, a full and distinct view of every
  movement of the old man's countenance, and assuredly my eyes were in no
  danger of being directed away from him. For a few moments there was perfect
  silence throughout the assembly, until at length the same herald made
  proclamation for the doors to be thrown open, that the priests of Jupiter
  might have access. There was heard forthwith a noise, as of the turning of
  some heavy machinery, and a part of the ground-work of the arena itself
  appeared to be giving way, right over against that quarter in which Tisias
  had his station. But of this the purpose was soon manifested, when there
  arose from underneath into the space thus vacated, a wooden stage, or
  platform, covered all over with rich carpetings, whereof the centre was
  occupied by a marble altar, set forth already with all the usual
  appurtenances of sacrifice, and surmounted on one side by a gigantic statue
  of bronze, in which it was easy to recognize the features of the great
  Phidian Jupiter. Neither had the altar any sooner made its appearance there,
  and the sound of the machinery, by which its great weight had been lifted,
  ceased to be heard, than even as the herald had given command, the main gates
  of the Amphitheatre were expanded, and thereby a free passage prepared for
  the procession of the Flamens. With that, all those that were present in the
  Amphitheatre, arose from their seats and stood up, and a sweet symphony of
  lutes and clarions ushered in the sacred band to the place appointed for
  them. And, first of all, there marched a train of fifty beautiful boys, and
  then an equal number of very young maidens, all, both boys and maidens,
  arrayed in white tunics, and having their heads crowned with oaken garlands,
  and bearing in their hands fresh branches of the oak tree, which, above all
  the other trees of the forest, is, as you have heard and well know, held dear
  and sacred to Jupiter. Then these youthful bands were separated, and they
  arranged themselves, the boys on the right, and the girls on the left hand of
  the altar, some of them standing on the arena itself, and others on either
  side, upon the steps of the platform whereon the altar was fixed; and
  beautiful, indeed, was their array, and comely and guiltless were their
  looks; and much modesty was apparent, both in the downcast eyes and closed
  lips, with which some of them stood there to await the issue of their coming,
  and in the juvenile admiration wherewith others of them were regarding the
  wide and splendid assemblage around them; insomuch, that I could not but feel
  within myself a certain dread and fearfulness, when I saw the feet of so many
  tender and innocent ones placed there upon the same hot and guilty sand,
  which had so often drunk the blood of fierce beasts and cruel
  malefactors&mdash;alas!&mdash;which had drunk the blood of the innocent also
  and which was yet to drink thereof abundantly.</p>

  <p>And after them there came in the priests themselves of Jupiter, arrayed in
  the white garments of sacrifice, walking two by two, the oldest and principal
  of them coming last. And behind them again, were certain younger assistants,
  clothed also in white, who led by a cord of silk inwrought with threads of
  silver, a milk- white steer, without spot or blemish, whose horns were
  already gilt, and his broad brows crowned with oak leaves and roses. And last
  of all entered the Vestal Virgins, none of whom had ever before been seen by
  me, and they also walked two by two; and no one could contemplate without
  veneration the majesty of their demeanour. With broad fillets were they bound
  around the forehead, and deep flowing veils hung down to their feet, entirely
  covering their faces and their hands; nevertheless, their dignity was
  apparent; and it was not the less impressive, by reason of the great mystery
  in which all things about them appeared to be enveloped.</p>

  <p>Imagine, therefore, to yourselves, how magnificent was the appearance of
  all things, when youths and damsels, and priests and vestals, had taken their
  places, according to the custom of their sacred observances; and all that
  innumerable company of spectators yet standing up in the amphitheatre, the
  choral-hymn was begun, in which every voice there was united, except only
  that of Tisias the Christian. Now, it was the soft low voices of the young
  maidens that sounded, and then these would pause, and give place to the
  clearer and more piercing notes of the boys that stood on the other side of
  the altar; then again the priestesses of Vesta would break in from afar with
  their equable harmony; and anon these in their turn ceasing, the Flamens of
  Jupiter would lift up their strong deep chanting, until, at the appointed
  signal from him that stood on the highest step of the altar, with the cup of
  libation in his hand, the whole people that were present burst in and joined
  in the rushing stream of the burden, "Jupiter,&mdash;Jupiter, hear
  us!&mdash;hear us, Father of Gods and men!" while the wine was poured out,
  gushing red upon the marble, and the incense flung on high from fifty
  censers, rolled its waves of smoke all over the surface of the arena, and
  quite up to the gorgeous canopy of that resounding Amphitheatre. Magnificent,
  indeed, was the spectacle, and majestic the music; yet in the midst of it,
  how could I take away my eyes from the pale and solitary old man, by reason
  of whose presence alone all these things were so? With calm eyes did he
  regard all the pageantry of those imperial rites, with closed lips did he
  stand amidst all the shouting multitudes. He bowed not his head; he lifted
  not up his hand neither would he bend his knee, when the victim was slain
  before the horns of the altar; neither would he in any thing give semblance
  of being a partaker in the worship.</p>

  <p>At length the song ceased, and there was a proclamation again for deep
  silence; and the Prefect of the city, addressing himself once more to Tisias,
  spoke thus:&mdash;"Impious and unhappy man, with great clemency have all
  things been conducted as concerning thee. When, after long imprisonment, and
  innumerable exhortations in private and in public, thou hadst always rejected
  every means of safety, and spurned from thee the pardon of those in whose
  hands thy being is placed, yet, notwithstanding of all thine obstinacy and
  continual rebellion, was it determined, that, in the face of all the people,
  thou shouldst once more have free grace offered to thee, provided only thou
  shouldst, when all the assembly worshipped, join thy. voice with them, and
  bow thy head also toward the altar of Jupiter. Nevertheless all that now hear
  me shall bear witness, that, with open and visible contumacy, thou hast
  rejected this opportunity also of being reconciled unto the prince and the
  empire,&mdash;that, when every knee bent, and every voice was lifted up, thou
  alone hast stood upright, and thy lips alone have been closed. If it be so,
  that, from some inflicted, rather than voluntary perversion of mind, thou
  hast never yet been able to understand the danger in which thou art placed,
  know now, that there remains no hope at all for thee, except for a moment;
  and let the strong fear of death open thine eyes, that thou mayst see where
  thou art, and for what purpose thou hast been brought hither. Thou art a born
  subject of Rome, and thy life can only be held by thee, in virtue of
  obedience to the laws. These arc clearer upon nothing, than the necessity
  that all men should acknowledge the deities of Rome; and of good reason,
  since, if they be despised, and their authority set at nought, by what means
  shall an oath be ratified, or a pledge given; or how may the head, which
  counsels and protects, be assured that the members shall not be lifted up
  against it? Let silence remain in the assembly, and let Tisias of Antioch
  make his election, whether he will give obedience, or suffer the penalty of
  transgression."</p>

  <p>Then the Prefect, and all those round about Trajan, sat down, and there
  was a deep silence throughout the lower region, where, for the most part,
  they of condition were placed; but when the rabble, that sat above, beheld
  the stern and resolute countenance with which the old man stood there upon
  the arena, it seemed as if they were enraged beyond measure, and there arose
  among them a fierce uproar, and a shouting of hatred; and, amidst groans and
  hisses, there was a cry from innumerable voices of&mdash;"Christian!
  Christian!&mdash;Blasphemer! Blasphemer!&mdash;Atheist! Atheist! A tiger! A
  tiger!&mdash;Let loose a tiger upon the Christian!"</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the old man preserved unmoved the steadfastness of his
  demeanour, and lifting up his eyes to the place from whence the tumult
  proceeded, regarded the ferocious multitude with a visage, not of anger or of
  scornfulness, but rather of pity and calmness; insomuch, that I perceived the
  nobles and senators were somewhat ashamed of the outcry, and the Prefect of
  the city arose from his place, and beckoned with his hand, until the people
  were weary of shouting, and order was, in some measure, re-established in the
  Amphitheatre.</p>

  <p>Then Tisias, perceiving that silence once more prevailed, lifted up his
  hand, and bowed himself before Trajan, and the great men of authority that
  were near to his chair, and said, with a firm clear voice, in the Roman
  tongue, "My name, O Trajan, is Tisias&mdash;the son of Androboulos. I am a
  native of Antioch, in Syria, and have in all things, except only in what
  pertains to this cause, observed throughout all the years of my life the
  statutes of the empire, as they, by whose accusation I have been led hither,
  shall themselves be constrained to bear witness for me this day. My father
  was a Greek of Macedonian extraction, being descended from one of those that
  came into Syria beneath the banners of the great King Seleucus; but he took
  to wife a maiden of the Hebrew nation, and in process of time became a
  proselyte to the faith of her fathers. Nevertheless, he lived in trust and
  honour beneath the governors appointed by those that were before you in the
  empire, and brought up me and all his children to reverence, in all things
  that are lawful, the authority of Caesar. But as to the faith of the true
  God, whose worshippers ye blindly and foolishly call atheists and
  blasphemers, from that he neither swerved himself, nor would permit any of
  those that were in his household to depart. Now, when he had been a dweller
  for some time in Jerusalem, the great city of the Jews, he began to examine
  into those things which were reported publicly concerning Jesus of Nazareth,
  who is also called the Christ, of which things not a few that had been
  eye-witnesses were then living in that city. And when he had been satisfied
  from their testimony, that those miracles, of which you have all heard, were
  in truth performed in the sight of the people by Jesus, and had listened unto
  the words of their teachers, and saw how they proved that the old prophets of
  the Hebrews had foretold those wonderful works, he perceived that Jesus of
  Nazareth was indeed the Christ of God, and the great Deliverer that had been
  promised to that people, even from the beginning of their nation. And he
  believed on him with all his household; and I also, from a stripling, have,
  although unworthy, been a Christian; for by that name were they first called
  in Antioch, the city of my birth.</p>

  <p>"But being brought into trouble by reason of his religion, which the
  rulers of the Jews abhorred, my father departed, after a time, from
  Jerusalem, and dwelt with my mother in one of the villages of Palestine,
  until his death. Not long after which time, the Jews rebelled against Caesar,
  and the great war began, which terminated in the overthrow of Jerusalem, and
  the utter ruin of their nation. Now, when Vespasian first came with his army
  into those regions, I, being without employment in the place where we had our
  habitation, and having, moreover, taken up a great, and perhaps a sinful,
  wrath against the Jews, on account of the sufferings which my father had
  undergone among them, and of the evils which, at their hands, our whole
  household had sustained, joined myself to one of the bands of Syrian
  auxiliaries; and although my mother entreated me, could not be persuaded to
  refrain from following the camp of Caesar with them. Of which thing it has
  often since then repented me, and in which, it may be, I still hold myself
  not to have done altogether as was right; for if the Jews had offended
  Caesar, it was, indeed, a reasonable thing that Caesar should visit them with
  his vengeance; but, peradventure, it behoved not any of them that were
  descended from the fathers of that people, to take part in the warfare.
  Nevertheless, being then young, and, as I have said, irritated by the sense
  of domestic injuries, I scrupled not to fulfil in all things the duty of a
  soldier, and followed the eagles of Vespasian and his son, even to the day
  when the lines were drawn around the Holy City; and it was manifest, that the
  war could have no end, but in the eternal overthrow of the power of the Jews.
  Neither did the length of the siege weary me, or produce within me any sort
  of unwillingness; but, on the contrary, so long as the city was beleaguered,
  I remained with the band in which I had numbered myself, and did in all
  labours such service as my strength would permit. Even among the soldiers
  that have guarded my prison, since I was led into Rome for the sake of that
  accusation which has been brought against me in the matter of my
  belief,&mdash; even among them, I have seen the faces of some that were my
  comrades in that fierce war, and that long beleaguerment, who also, if they
  be commanded, will not refuse to bear testimony before you, that all these
  things are true, even as I have said, and that I was a faithful soldier, both
  of Vespasian and of Titus, unto the last. Neither, indeed, did I lay down
  arms immediately when Jerusalem had been sacked, and the Temple burnt,
  according to the prediction of Christ, but went with Caesar along the
  sea-coast, and was present with him all through the journeyings he made in
  Egypt, even to the day when he made his great festival at Alexandria, and
  crowned the Ox Apis with his own hands, in the presence of all that people.
  On which day it was, that, for the first time, I also was accused of being a
  Christian, and at the command of Titus himself, was interrogated by one of
  the rulers of the army.</p>

  <p>"Now with shame and confusion of face must I acknowledge, that on that day
  I, from desire of life, forgot myself utterly, and being deserted of all
  steadfastness, went up to the altar in presence of my judge, and offered
  gifts there, whereon I was declared free of all blame; and even received
  honour and commendation thereafter from them, on account of my services in
  the war. But, from that day, my spirit sunk within me, and I knew not what to
  do; I grew weary of all things, and determined to leave the band in which I
  was serving, that I might seek out, if it were possible, the habitation of my
  mother, and make atonement in secret for the wickedness of which I, unhappy
  and fearful man, had been guilty at Alexandria. Being absolved, therefore,
  from my oath of service, on account of the length of time I had remained with
  the army, I departed from Egypt, and, after a time, found out my mother where
  she was dwelling in the mountainous country of Palestine, to the north of
  Jerusalem. In going thither, however, I was constrained to pass by the place
  where I had so long lain in your camp, O Romans! and to look with my own eyes
  on the sorrowful desolation of that ancient city, where so many holy prophets
  of the Hebrews had ministered, and so many great kings reigned in the days of
  the old time, when their nation flourished, and was chosen and favoured of
  the Almighty. And it was then, indeed, that I first began to repent me of
  having been present in the host of Titus, and of having had a part in that
  terrible destruction; to which, when I added the recollection of my own
  miserable timorousness at Alexandria, great was my perplexity, and I fled
  across the mountains with much speed, seeking in vain to fly from the stings
  and unceasing torment of my own meditations, which nevertheless continued
  ever more and more to sink into my spirit; insomuch, that when I came into
  the place where my mother was dwelling, scarcely could she recognize me,
  wasted and worn as I was with that perpetual misery of shame and repentance.
  Without reproaches, however, and indeed with great kindness, did she receive
  me into her habitation, even although, as I have said, she had been much
  offended with me because of my going up to the beleaguerment of the city of
  her fathers. But when I, being humbled, made confession to her and her
  household, and to all the faithful that were in that place, of the grievous
  sin whereof I had been guilty in Egypt, both she and all the rest of them
  busied themselves continually to comfort me, and to assure me that there was
  yet hope, if my repentance were sincere, and my resolution immovable never
  again to yield myself to any similar temptation. One of them also, that had
  been set apart to minister in holy things among the scattered believers that
  dwelt up and down in that region, came not many days after to the same place,
  and having publicly heard my confession, admitted me once more to be a
  partaker with them in the mysteries of the sanctuary. From which day, O
  Trajan! I have never again been so far deserted of myself, as to fall back
  into that miserable error, or by any cowardly word of mine, to deny the faith
  that is in me, which is the faith of the True God that made heaven and earth,
  and of his Son Jesus Christ, whom he sent into the world to teach loving-
  kindness, and long-suffering, and patience, among all kindreds, and tongues,
  and nations of mankind; and to make expiation, by the accursed death of the
  cross, for the evil and the wickedness that is in the world. From which
  faith, should I now depart, out of terror for that which, by your command,
  may befall me in this place, of a surety no comfort could ever again come to
  me in my mind, for I should be bowed down, and utterly miserable, out of
  grief and shame; which as you yourself, Caesar, will admit and acknowledge,
  is far worse than death itself, or any evil which the body of man can
  sustain. Neither could I have any hope of being reconciled unto the True God,
  whom I should have so, once and again, denied; insomuch, that neither in life
  nor in death should I be able to have any happiness;&mdash;for in life, what
  happiness is there to him that is ashamed of himself?&mdash;and, in departing
  from life, what comfort can be given to him, that, knowing the truth, hath
  openly abjured the truth for the sake of a few, at the utmost, and these most
  miserable and unhappy years? I am an old man, and my near kindred and my
  friends are already dead, so that poor after all, and not worthy to be
  mentioned, is the sacrifice on which I have this day resolved. And as for
  you, Romans, should I now make shipwreck of my faith, and tell a lie to save
  my life before you, with what contempt would yourselves be constrained
  forthwith to look upon me? Whosoever is wise among you, according to the
  philosophy of the earth, would utterly despise me; and whosoever is brave and
  steadfast of spirit, would think foul scorn that a soldier of Titus should be
  so much afraid to die. Therefore, O Trajan, am I resolved to endure all
  things rather than sacrifice to your gods; and if such be your will, I will
  not refuse to die for this cause, to which witness has already been borne in
  Rome by the blood of holy Apostles, and other noble martyrs of Christ."</p>

  <p>The old man, having said these words, bowed himself once more reverently
  before Trajan, and then folding his arms in his cloak, appeared to await
  whatever might be appointed. Steadfastly did I look upon his face at that
  moment, to see whether it might exhibit no trace of wavering, or at least, if
  pride barred irresolution, whether, nevertheless, there might not appear some
  token of natural sorrow, and human unwillingness to die; yet in vain did I
  scrutinize and seek for any such symptoms of spiritual weakness; for although
  it was visible that, with the exertion of so long standing and speaking, to
  say nothing of thought and anxiety, his bodily strength was much spent, still
  his eye preserved firmness, and his brow remained serene; and the parched
  lips of the old man did not once betray the least shadow of trembling.
  Methinks I see him even now, as he then stood&mdash;his deep calm eyes
  sometimes turned upwards to Trajan, but for the most part bent to the ground,
  beneath those gray brows of his, whose dark shade rested upon his large
  solemn eyelids. Upon his broad front, as he stooped, no hair appeared, but
  long hoary ringlets, clustered down on either side, mingling with the
  venerable, although dishevelled beard, that lay upon his bosom. Heroic
  meekness was enthroned visibly upon all his lineaments, and a murmur began to
  run through the assembly, as if&mdash;even in a Christian&mdash;it were not
  possible to contemplate such things without admiration.</p>

  <p>But as they afterwards related to me&mdash;for I myself was not indeed
  sufficiently attentive to it&mdash;Trajan, who had as yet, during all the
  occurrences of the day, preserved unmoved the majestic serenity of his
  countenance, when he observed this last movement in the spirit of the
  assembly, began all at once to be very indignant, that such things should
  occur in such a place, in consequence of the appearance merely, and the
  language, of a culprit and a Christian. I confess it, that I was too much
  occupied with gazing on Tisias, to have any leisure for remarking the
  particulars of the deportment of any other person present&mdash;no, not even
  of Caesar; yet such had been the effect produced on me by the history which
  the old man delivered of himself, that I indeed was not prepared at the
  moment to find the strong arm of power directed ruthlessly, and immediately
  against him. At least, said I to myself, the Prince will institute an inquiry
  among all those now present in the capital, who are likely to be able either
  to contradict essentially, or to confirm, the narrative in which this man has
  thought fit to embody his only defence. Many years indeed have elapsed since
  the walls of Jerusalem were shattered by the engines of Rome, and the golden
  gate of its antique temple refused to be any protection against the furious
  soldiery of Titus. Yet surely not a few of such as were present in that proud
  host, must be still in life; yea, not a few of them must be now present in
  the capital of the world. The old spearman, with whom I talked in the
  guardroom, and beside the ramparts underneath which this Christian was
  imprisoned, he surely cannot be the only witness that remains to give
  testimony. He at least there is, and we shall forthwith have him at least
  confronted with Tisias.</p>

  <p>Such were my thoughts within me; judge, therefore, what was my
  astonishment when I heard the trumpet sound, and perceived that its note,
  without any word being spoken, was at once received as a sufficient warning
  by the priests and the vestals, and the youths and the damsels, and all those
  that had in any way been connected with the service of the altar, to retire
  from the place whereon they stood, and leave the old man there alone, to
  await the issue of his destiny. Immediately on the signal being given by the
  trumpet, did all these begin to move away; but although in silence they had
  at first marched into the Amphitheatre, they did not retire from it in
  silence. Another hymn, on the contrary, in which also, as it seemed,
  different parts were allotted for each different order of singers, was begun
  to be sung by them even before they had moved from the arena; and after the
  last of their procession had disappeared behind the wide folding-doors of the
  Amphitheatre, we still heard their voices chanting solemnly until they had
  entered the great Temple of Isis and Serapis, which, as I have already said,
  stands over against it, on the brink of the Esquiline. And while all were yet
  listening to their singing, and to the harmony of lutes and other sweet-
  sounding instruments that accompanied their voices, the slaves and other
  attendants removed every thing from the arena, except only the altar and
  statue of Jupiter, which were still left where they had been placed;
  insomuch, that ere they had made an end of singing, and we of listening, the
  old man was left alone there as at the beginning, when he first came
  forth.</p>

  <p>But just when deep silence once more prevailed, and expectation was most
  intense concerning what should be at length commanded by Trajan, it fell out
  so, that a little bald ape escaped through the bars of one of the grated
  doors, which were along the boundary-wall of the arena, and leaping forth
  upon the sand, began to skip up and down, challenging, by all manner of
  foolish gestures, the attention of those that sat over against it, leaning
  down from the parapet. And immediately certain painted courtesans, that were
  sitting not far from thence, with gilded breasts and bright-coloured
  garlands, and all other gorgeous trappings of the degradation of harlotry,
  began to throw down apples and nuts to the obscene creature, and to testify
  much delight in the grimaces with which it received them, hopping to and fro,
  and casting them away, and then catching them up again, with continual
  gibbering and prating; and no sooner did the rabble that were above perceive
  these things, than they all, as with one consent, began to applaud; so that
  the vaulted vomitories and wide arches of entrance, and all the marble walls,
  re-echoed with every wild sound of carelessness and merriment. While, in the
  meantime, the African feeders and naked gladiators, and all those hangers-on
  of the Amphitheatre, whom we had seen in the dark places below, hearing now
  the sounds that had arisen among the assembly, began to show themselves in
  crowds from behind the same grated doors through one of which the monkey had
  escaped, and to partake in the mirth of the spectators, and to whistle upon
  the creature, and to excite it to new caperings, by their outcries and
  jeerings. It seemed as if the minds of all present were entirely occupied
  with the pranks of this brute; and that almost it was forgotten amidst the
  tumult, not only for what purpose all that solemn and stately pageantry had
  just been exhibited before them; but even that Tisias was still standing
  there upon the same arena.</p>

  <p>For myself, who had never before looked upon any creature of this
  disgusting tribe, and had gathered only some general notion of its appearance
  from the treatises of the physiologists and the narratives of
  travellers,&mdash;I could not, indeed, refuse to contemplate at first its
  motions with some curiosity; but I knew not, after the scene had lasted for a
  little space, whether to be more humbled within myself by the monkey's filthy
  mimickings of the form and attitudes of mankind, or by the display of brutish
  heartlessness, which burst forth from all that countless multitude, while
  gazing on that spectacle of humiliation.</p>

  <p>But it was not until my eye fell again on Tisias, who stood all this time
  solitary and silent amidst the hub-bub, that my sorrow and indignation were
  the greatest. There stood the old man even as before, with his arms folded in
  his gown, and his eyes resting on the sand before him, pale, calm, and
  unmoved in his meekness, even as if his ears had not once received any sound
  of all the shoutings and the joyous laughters of that unpitying rabble, that
  had come there to behold him die. Once, indeed&mdash;it was but once&mdash;I
  thought I could perceive that a slight emotion of contempt wreathed for an
  instant his thin and bloodless lips; but it seemed as if that were but the
  involuntary and momentary passing over him of one proud thought, which he
  cast from him immediately, as a thing unworthy of the resolute mind of his
  integrity, choosing rather to array himself in the divine armour of patience,
  than to oppose, with any weapon of human passion, the insults heaped upon his
  head by the cruel callousness of that degenerate congregation of men. And,
  whether it were that the sight of all this did not affect me alone with such
  reflections, or only that they in authority were afraid too much of the day
  might be occupied with what formed so unseemly an addition to the ordained
  business of the assembly, while the uproar of mirth was yet at its height,
  certain of the lictors that were about the consular chairs leapt down into
  the arena, and beat the monkey back again among the feeders, and other base
  hirelings, that stood behind the grated doors of which I have spoken.
  Whereupon there was at once an end of the tumult, and the lictors having
  reascended to their places, the eyes of all began once more to fix themselves
  upon the Christian.</p>

  <p>And he also, when he perceived that it was so, and was sensible of the
  silence that once more prevailed, it seemed as if he, too, were aware that at
  last his appointed hour had come, and that he must needs prepare himself in
  good earnest for the abiding of the issue. For, instead of continuing
  steadfast in his place, as he had done during all the time he had as yet been
  exposed there, it appeared as if now at length, being swallowed up in the
  contemplation of the approaching fate, he had quite forgotten all the rules
  he had laid down to himself concerning his behaviour. Not that he now lost
  remembrance of the courage which hitherto he had manifested, or even, that
  any the least symptom of changeableness was made visible upon his
  countenance. But it seemed to me, of a truth, that of such things as he had
  determined upon within himself before he came thither, touching the mere
  external demeanour of his bodily frame, the memory now, in this final moment
  of expectation, had somewhat passed away; for Tisias stood still no longer on
  the centre of the arena; but retaining his arms folded as they had been, and
  his eyes fixed upon the sand, he began to pace rapidly to and fro, traversing
  the open space whereon he alone now was, from side to side, without once
  looking up, or exhibiting any token that he was conscious of the presence of
  any man. By and by, nevertheless, in the deeper knittings of his brows, and
  in the closer pressure of his extenuated lips, and then again in the
  quivering of the nerves and muscles upon the arms and legs of the old man, as
  he moved before us, it was testified how keenly the spirit was at work
  within; the strong soul wrestling, it may be, with some last stirring
  temptations of the flesh, and the mind itself not altogether refusing to
  betray its sympathy with the natural shudderings of the body. But the moment
  that the herald of Trajan commanded attention in the assembly, and that the
  Prefect of the city began again to prepare himself for speaking, that moment
  did the old man appear to return at once again entirely to himself; and he
  fixed his eyes upon the Prefect with even the same steadfastness as when he
  made his oration to Caesar.</p>

  <p>"By all the gods," whispered Sabinus at that moment, "this is a true
  soldier of Vespasian and Titus. He will die for this superstition with the
  constancy of a Roman."&mdash;"With all the constancy of a philosopher, say
  rather," quoth Xerophrastes, who had overheard his whisper&mdash;"yea, with
  all the constancy of a philosopher. Of a surety, there must be some lessons
  of nobility in this faith of the Jews."&mdash;"Now, speak not, but look at
  the old man," interrupted Rubellia; "the signal is given for the
  executioner."</p>

  <p>And I looked, and saw that the Prefect was standing up in his place,
  immediately below the chair of Trajan, and immediately' he began to speak;
  and he said, first looking towards the people,&mdash;"Let there be silence,
  and let no man stir in this place until this matter be ended." And then
  addressing himself, as it seemed, to Tisias,&mdash;"With all patience,"
  proceeded he, "have the words which this man chose to utter in his defence,
  been listened to; but it must be manifest to all men, that they contain no
  shadow of apology, but rather afford the strongest confirmation of all that
  had before been alleged. Instead of departing from his error, or offering any
  extenuation of its magnitude, his words have tended only to show what was
  already well known to all that have had any dealings with the adherents of
  this blasphemous sect; that their obstinacy is as great as their atheism is
  perverse; and that no clemency can, without blame, be extended to their
  wilfulness, and to the scorn wherewith they are resolved to regard all things
  sacred. Nevertheless, inquiry has been made, and confirmation has been given,
  by those who were present in the wars of the Divine Titus, as to that which
  this man hath said concerning his own service throughout the glorious
  campaign of Palestine, and the siege of the city of the Jews. For which
  service, it hath seemed right unto Caesar, Ever-Merciful, that no
  circumstance of needless shame be added to the death by which this Christian
  must now expiate before all them who have seen his contempt of the sacrifice
  of Jupiter, and heard his words of blasphemy against all the gods, the guilt
  of which, it is manifest to all, he hath been justly and necessarily accused.
  Let those, therefore, who had been commanded to bring forth a tiger, depart
  now with their beast, and let this man be beheaded before the Altar of
  Jupiter; after which, for this day, the assembly will disperse; for, until
  the morrow, the spectacle of the wild animals, which the Prince hath
  prepared, must be deferred."</p>

  <p>The Prefect made his obeisance again to Caesar, and sat down in his place,
  and immediately one of the doors of the arena was flung open, and there
  entered some slaves, bearing a wooden block upon their shoulders, behind whom
  followed also certain ill-favoured blacks, out of the company of African
  gladiators, one of whom carried bare in his hand a long and heavy sword, the
  surface of which glittered brightly as he moved, as if newly sharpened and
  burnished for the occasion. Seeing all which fatal preparations, Tisias
  immediately flung aside the long cloak in which hitherto his arms and all his
  body had been wrapped; and after regarding those that had come in for a
  moment with a steadfast eye, he turned himself to the place where the Prefect
  was sitting, as if he had yet one word to say before he should submit himself
  to the sword; whereupon the Prefect said, "If the prisoner has yet any thing
  to offer, it is not too late for mercy&mdash;Let him speak."</p>

  <p>"I have nothing more to offer, Romans!" answered the old man, "as
  concerning that of which I have spoken. But since already some favour has
  been extended to me by reason of my services in the army of Caesar, perhaps
  so neither will this be refused, that my body may be given to such as shall
  ask for it, that it may be treated without indignity after my soul is
  released."</p>

  <p>"It is granted," replied the Prefect.&mdash;"Is there any thing more?"</p>

  <p>The old man was silent.</p>

  <p>With that, the block being already fixed upon the sand immediately in
  front of the Altar of Jupiter, one of the Africans moved towards Tisias, as
  if to conduct him to the place where it behoved him to kneel; but he,
  observing what was his intention, forthwith prevented him, and walked of
  himself steadily close up to him in whose hand the sword was unsheathed.
  Being come thither, he immediately took his station over against the block,
  and having for a moment placed his hand upon his eyes, and moved his lips, as
  it seemed, in fervent supplication, dropped his one knee on the ground, and
  stretched forth his neck towards the block; but suddenly, after he had done
  so, he sprung again upon his feet, and began to gaze with a keen eye all
  around the assembly, as if he were in search of some one to whom he had
  something yet to say. In vain, however, as it appeared, did he make this
  endeavour; for after a little space, he shook his head despairingly, and gave
  over the steadfastness of his look. Nevertheless, he lifted up his voice,
  and, surveying once more the whole face of the Amphitheatre round about, from
  side to side, said audibly,&mdash;"There is one here who made last night a
  promise to me in my dungeon. I cannot see him where he is; but I conjure him
  to take good heed, and execute, as he is a man and a Roman, all those things
  which he said to me he would do." Now, when I heard him say so, I well knew
  within myself that it was for me only his eye had been searching, and half
  did I arise from my seat, that he might see I was there, and observe my
  resolution to keep the faith I had plighted voluntarily to him in his prison.
  But Sabinus, having watched my earnestness in contemplating Tisias, and
  comprehending something of that which was meant, held me firm upon the bench,
  whispering, "As you regard me, Valerius, and as you regard your own safety,
  be still."</p>

  <p>Being thus constrained, I neither rose up, nor made any attempt to attract
  the attention of Tisias&mdash;for which forbearance, I confess to you, I have
  since that day undergone the visitation of not a few bitter
  thoughts&mdash;but remained steadily in my place, while the old man once more
  addressed himself to kneel down upon the block that was before him. Calmly
  now at length did he kneel, and with much composure did he place himself.
  Yet, before the gladiator was ready to strike, he lifted his head once again,
  and gazed upwards for a moment towards heaven, with such a countenance of
  faith and hope, that there went through all the assembly a murmur, as it
  were, and a stirring breath of admiration. Then bowed he for the last time
  his gray hairs, and almost before he had rested his neck upon the tree, the
  strong sword of the African smote with merciful fierceness, and the headless
  trunk falling backwards upon the sand, the blood spouted forth in a gushing
  stream, and sprinkled all over with red drops the base of the statue of
  Jupiter Capitolinus, and the surface of the marble altar, whereupon the
  sacrifice of the Flamens had been offered.</p>

  <p>The executioner having made an end of his duty, wiped his sword from the
  blood of the Christian, and advancing towards the seats of the magistrates,
  claimed the largesse that was due to him,&mdash;which when he had received,
  as is the custom, he and all his attendants withdrew immediately from the
  arena; the Emperor, at the same moment, and the Consulars, and all they that
  were about him, departing also from the assembly; and the whole Amphitheatre
  speedily being filled with the clamours of an universal upbreaking and
  dispersion.</p>

  <h2><a id="book2"
     name="book2">BOOK II</a></h2>

  <h2><a id="ch201"
     name="ch201">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I SAW, my friends, that you listened with not less of
  indignation, than of astonishment, to the account which I yesterday gave you
  of a day spent in the Amphitheatre of Vespasian. Neither did I expect that it
  should be otherwise with young persons of ingenuous minds, whose feelings
  have never been hardened by any experience of the life of Rome.</p>

  <p>And yet, when you reflect a little more upon the matter, I think you will
  abate something of the wonder you manifested on hearing of the fondness of
  the Roman people for some of those cruel, ruthful spectacles. You will admit,
  at least, that there is a certain natural principle, on an exaggerated and
  morbid obedience to which, rather than on any total and absolute departure
  from the laws of our mind, much of that which excited so much of your
  astonishment and indignation also may be supposed to depend. In and by
  myself, I maintain it must always be a most interesting thing for a man to
  witness, in whatever shape, the last moments of any human creature. I mean
  not those merely corporeal struggles, in which there must always be every
  thing to revolt, and nothing to interest, because in them, it is evident, the
  nobler part of our nature can have no share&mdash;the soul being already
  swallowed up, and its divinity absorbed in the intense convulsions of animal
  suffering. These are things on which no eyes can gaze willingly, without
  indicating degradation of spirit. But before that curtain falls, beyond which
  every one must shudder to penetrate, there is a last terrible act of the real
  tragedy, which must ever have power to fix the eyes with an earnestness not
  the less deep, because of its being preceded by some struggles of reluctance.
  We live in a state in which, however we may clothe ourselves in the armour of
  levity, or with the more effectual armour of occupation, it is impossible
  that the one fearful idea of dissolution should not ever and anon come to
  scare us with its terrors. We feel that we are walking over a soil, on the
  most level and the most rugged parts of which it is equally possible we may
  meet with the dark pit wherein it is our destiny to stumble. How sudden, or
  how gradual soever the inevitable fall may be, we well know we shall have
  little enough space to prepare ourselves for the last leap, when we shall be
  fairly on the declivity; and I maintain, once more, that it is a rational, no
  less than a natural, curiosity, which leads us to seek to supply, in some
  measure, this necessary defect, and to gather, if possible, from witnessing
  the last moments of others, some hints which may be of use to us when our own
  dark hour shall come. We see a being standing on the edge of a precipice, to
  which the only thing we know certainly, is, that we ourselves shall one day
  be brought; and shall it be possible to feel no curiosity concerning the
  manner in which he conducts himself on that giddy brink? That which is denied
  to us in our own person, may, in part, be supplied in his; and the eyes which
  dwell upon his features, while they are filled with the overwhelming
  expectation of near approaching death, make the closest approximation of
  which our nature admits to penetrating the actual mysteries of the unseen
  region. For myself, both wiser and better did I come away from all that
  mournful spectacle. But perhaps I am joining together things which, after
  all, had no necessary connection, when I ascribe to my contemplation of the
  death of Tisias, and the other cruel sights which, as it seemed, were
  regarded with indifference by the great multitudes around me, so much of the
  change which, about this period, my own spirit underwent.</p>

  <p>The slumbers which followed that busy day of novelties and terrors, were
  long and heavy; for utterly worn out were both mind and body, and youth
  hastened to repair the waste of its energies, by drinking deeply at the great
  fountain of natural refreshment. Nevertheless, although the hand of sleep had
  lain steadily upon me, when I awoke in the already-confirmed light of
  morning, I found myself yet filled with a confused and tremulous sense of
  excitation, as if the spirit had disdained to be idle after having received
  so much food for activity, and Fancy had still been garnishing the passive
  sphere of the night with aerial representations of all the gorgeous and
  solemn realities of the by- past day. I lay there ruminating amidst the
  dispersing shadows of the mysterious world of dreams, and scarcely as yet
  aware that a whole night had passed since I had returned from the
  Amphitheatre, when I was at length roused to a sudden and complete
  recollection of all things by the entrance of Boto.</p>

  <p>"My dear master," said he, making a sort of start after he had come in, "I
  was afraid you would be angry with me for not coming to you sooner, but now I
  perceive you have been as lazy as the rest of us. Why, surely, you are not
  aware what time of day it is! What would my dear old lady over the water say,
  if she heard of my young master lying in bed till within three hours of noon?
  Oh, what a place is this you have brought me to! Why, when I awake in the
  morning, the first thought that comes into my head always is, What, Boto, and
  is it really possible that all that wide roaring sea lies between you and the
  green banks of quiet Anton? Is it truth, good truth, and neither dream nor
  witching, that you, <i>Boto</i>, are in <i>Rome</i>? But I sometimes have to
  jump up, and take a look out of the window before I am quite convinced; and
  then, to be sure, I know well enough that I, who used always to dream about
  driving cattle to Venta, and perhaps kissing a Brigian lass by the way, could
  never dream of so many fine things unless I were really among them. Good
  heavens! what a heap of stories I shall have to tell, when we get safe back
  to Old Britain!"&mdash;"Indeed, Boto," said I, you will be quite a travelled
  man. Be sure you do not give yourself too many airs on the
  occasion."&mdash;"Travelled man, in faith," replied the clown. "I should like
  to know, who it is that will be able to hold up his head with me, when I am
  once fairly back again? Oh, how the old smith will be humbled! He thought
  himself such a mighty person, because my old master, your father, had taken
  him with him as far as Camolodunum, and how he used to brag of what he had
  seen there; but now, I trow, Master Pernorix will be fain to talk quietly
  about his journeys.&mdash;O Rome, Rome! what fine things shall I have to tell
  them all about Rome,&mdash;and the lions, and the monkeys, and Caesar, and
  the elephants, and the fighting men, and the Christian, and all the wonderful
  sights we saw yesterday. But the worst of it is, that nobody will ever be
  able to believe one half of what I shall tell them.&mdash;And when does my
  dear Master Valerius think we shall be returning to my old lady, and all the
  rest of them in Britain?"</p>

  <p>"Of a truth, good Boto," said I, "that is more than I can pretend to give
  you any notion of; but I dare say, you shall have both time and opportunity
  to pick up a few more marvels still before we go. In the meantime, you are
  comfortable, I hope, in your quarters, and Dromo takes good heed of you."
  "Dromo," quoth he, looking as arch as his massive features would admit of,
  "Dromo, indeed!&mdash;If I had nobody to trust to but him, I should be very
  ill off. Dromo is a great man; the young lord of the house has him up in his
  chamber every day to talk with him by himself; and when he comes down again,
  or returns from any of the errands he is sent out upon, there is no bearing
  with him in the court-yard, where we are all huddled together. As for the
  overseer, old Sarcalus, the freed-man, he has quite given him up. Nobody dare
  speak about whipping him; he looks upon himself as almost as important a
  person as his master, I believe, if the truth were known; and yet I should
  not complain, for, after all, it was Dromo that carried me yesterday to the
  Amphitheatre."&mdash;"Ay, that was very kind of Dromo&mdash;I should have
  thought of it myself. And did he not see that you got your supper snugly,
  when you came back?"&mdash;"Ah! now, master, don't make them whip me&mdash;I
  see they, have told you all."&mdash;"All!" said I&mdash;"I do assure you they
  have told me nothing about you; but come, speak out. It must be something
  very bad that would make me think of having you whipped. You have only been
  three days in Rome&mdash;I shall make allowance for a few vagaries, provided
  they be not very extravagant."&mdash;"Well, then, Master Caius," quoth he,
  "since they have told you nothing beforehand, and you seem inclined to be so
  good- natured with me, I shall e'en tell you all myself, and I hope you won't
  think me, after all, very much to blame." "Speak out, my honest Boto, and
  remember there is Dromo also to be examined, in case you keep any thing back
  from me."&mdash;"Ah! master, but Dromo would not be so easily caught as poor
  Boto, Dromo is a cunning man, and a close; and besides, they say he was born
  in a city they call Crete, and the people of that place can't speak a word of
  truth, even although they were willing. Do not think any thing at all about
  Dromo; but trust entirely to your own poor Boto, and he will tell you every
  thing. Dromo is a sad dog."</p>

  <p>I know not what more he might have proceeded to say concerning Dromo, had
  not that crafty Cretan, who, without question, had been listening all the
  while behind the door, just at that moment glided in on very delicate tiptoe,
  and coming close up behind the British slave, as he stood in the act of
  haranguing me, smote him a smart fillip upon the cheek with the back of his
  fingers, mimicking, at the same time, the outlandish accent of the man, and
  repeating after him into his tinkling ears, the words, <i>Dromo is a sad
  dog&mdash;Dromo is a cunning man, and a close&mdash;Dromo would not be so
  easily caught as poor Boto.</i>&mdash;"Ha, ha! Master Valerius," then said he
  to me, "and so you would really take the trouble to ask questions of this
  worthy man, when you had it in your power to send for me? I thought it had
  not been for nothing that three persons I could name entered upon a certain
  alliance&mdash;but 'tis all one to the Cretan.&mdash;Both Sextus, and you,
  may manage your own affairs for yourselves, if such be your pleasure."</p>

  <p>I knew not on this whether to be more amazed with the impudence of the
  Cretan, or the confusion of poor Boto, who stood rubbing his cheek with a
  strangely mingled aspect of sheepishness and sulkiness; but Dromo soon put an
  end to the affair, by turning round with a face of admirably feigned
  astonishment to my Briton, and saying, "Good heavens! Boto, are you still
  there? Do you not perceive that your master and I have something to say to
  each other in private? Begone, my good man&mdash;shall I never be able to
  render you susceptible of the smallest polish?"</p>

  <p>These last words being accompanied with a gentle push on the back, soon
  expelled poor Boto, who, nevertheless, did not depart without casting towards
  me a look of woeful appeal over his shoulder. But I perceiving plainly, in
  the midst of all his frolicsome behaviour, that Dromo had really something to
  say to me; and suspecting, of course, that the interest of Sextus might be
  concerned in what he had to say, suffered my slave to withdraw in good
  earnest. Dromo, after the door was shut, laid his finger upon his lip, and
  stood still for a moment in an attitude of close attention; but the heavy
  heels of the reluctant Briton were heard with great distinctness, lumbering
  along the marble floor of the gallery; so, being satisfied that there was no
  eavesdropping in the case, the varlet seated himself forthwith in a posture
  of great familiarity on the nether end of my couch, and, to judge from the
  expression of his countenance, seemed evidently to be preparing himself for a
  disclosure of some importance. At length, after not a few winks of much
  intelligence, it was thus he began:&mdash;"You may hear Boto's story, sir, at
  any time you please, and I dare say it will amuse you; but, in the meantime,
  I must really have you attend to me, for, without jesting, things are by no
  means in so fair a train as I had thought for my young master; and if
  something effectual be not speedily discovered, I am really at a loss to
  think how we shall be able to get out of our difficulties, in such a manner
  as may be either satisfactory to him, or creditable to my management. But you
  had better get up and dress yourself, and while you are doing so, I will tell
  you every thing."</p>

  <p>I did as he bade me, and then the Cretan proceeded:&mdash;"As I was coming
  out of the Amphitheatre yesterday, I happened to find myself rubbing
  shoulders with a certain old fat Calabrian, whom I had seen before about
  Rubellia's house in the Suburra, and thinking that no harm could possibly
  come of being civil to him, I began immediately to ask his opinion of the
  spectacles. I wish you had been there to sec how much he was delighted with
  the attention I paid him, and how he plumed himself on being admitted to talk
  on such subjects with such a person as me; for the man himself is but an
  ignorant fellow, and seems never to have kept company but with the grooms and
  hinds. From less to more, we began to be the greatest friends in the world;
  and by the time we got to the Arch, it was evident that we could not possibly
  part, without having a cup together to cement the acquaintance. Well, we were
  just about to dive into one of the wine- cellars there, below the gateway,
  when I saw your friend Boto standing by himself in the middle of the street,
  apparently quite a-gaze and bewildered, and not able to form the smallest
  guess which way he ought to take in order to reach home; and being a
  good-natured fellow, in spite of all that has been said, I immediately
  shouted out his name till he was compelled to hear me, and then beckoned to
  him to come along with us, which indeed he did without much coaxing."</p>

  <p>"Well, Dromo," said I, "and so all your great news is, that you have been
  leading my Briton into one of your debauches? In truth, I think you need not
  have made such an affectation of mystery withal."&mdash;"Stop now," quoth he,
  cutting me short; "if the slave be too slow, I am sure the master's quickness
  will make up for it. Hear me out before you begin commenting; such
  interruptions would bring the Stagyrite himself to a stand. We were soon, all
  three of us, seated in one of those snug little places, which if you have not
  yet seen, you are ignorant of the most comfortable sight within all the four
  walls of Rome, a quiet cleanly little place, three good hassocks upon the
  floor, a handful of sausages, a plate of dried fish as broad as the shield of
  Ajax, and a good old fashioned round-bellied jolly jug of Surrentine in the
  midst of us. I dare say, there were a hundred besides employed in the same
  way in the house; but we shut the door, and were as private as behind the
  altar of Vesta."&mdash;"A tempting scene, Dromo; and what use did you make of
  your privacy?"&mdash;"All in good time, Master Valerius; you would have the
  apple before the egg. We had scarcely emptied our first jug, ere the
  conversation between the Calabrian and me took a turn that was not quite
  unnatural; for slaves, however little you may trust them, will always be
  smelling out something of the truth; and you may be sure, all this visiting,
  and feasting, and riding about in chariots, and sitting together at the
  Amphitheatre, has not been going on, without causing a good deal of talk both
  in this house and the rich widow's. The courtship was of course the subject
  of our conversation, and I, pretending to know nothing of it myself, except
  from the common report of the slaves about our house, affected to consider it
  as highly probable, that the fat Calabrian might have had much better
  opportunities than mine of being informed how the affair really stood."</p>

  <p>"And did he really seem to have any knowledge about it?" said I. "Not much
  not much; but still the man did tell me something that I think may turn out
  to be well worth the knowing. 'I am sure,' said I, (by this time Boto was
  fast asleep,) 'I am sure, if Rubellia won't have my young master, it won't be
  for want of presents; for we all know he has already given her a whole casket
  of rings and bracelets that belonged to his mother, and he is sitting for his
  picture, which, they say, he is to give her besides.'&mdash;'And <i>I</i> am
  sure,' quoth the Calabrian in return, 'that if your young master don't have
  my lady, it won't be for want of presents neither; for she is the most
  generous open- handed lady in the world, and that her worst enemies will
  allow, although her father be an old rogue, and an usurer, as all the town
  says he is. No, Dromo,' continued he, 'nor will it be for want of philtres,
  nor of charms, nor of any thing that soothsaying can procure; for, between
  ourselves, my lady keeps up a constant traffic of late with all that sort of
  gentry; and what the issue of it all may be, Hecate only knows.' Now, Master
  Valerius, when I heard him speak of philtres and charms, you may be sure I
  began to quicken up my ears more keenly than ever."</p>

  <p>"Dromo!" said I; "you are not serious. You do not mean surely to make me
  think that you believe in the efficacy of love-potions, or any such
  quackeries?"&mdash;"Quackeries! do you call philtres quackeries? Why, there
  was a girl once gave myself a philtre that kept me raving for six
  months."&mdash;"What sort of a looking girl was she, good
  Dromo?"&mdash;"Bah!" quoth he; "don't expect to jeer me out of memory as well
  as judgment. Heavens and earth! when did any body ever hear of any body
  denying the efficacy of philtres? What an atheistical sort of barbarians
  those Britons must be. I wonder you are not afraid of some evil coming upon
  you. Remember Dian's handful; remember the fate of Actaeon!"&mdash;"Good
  Dromo," said I, "I suppose you also suffered from peeping. But talk
  seriously; are you yourself a dealer in philtres, that you are so anxious I
  should believe in their power? Or what is your meaning?"</p>

  <p>"My meaning is this," quoth he, with great vehemence, "it is, that if
  Rubellia gives Sextus such another philtre as a certain cunning damsel gave
  me, before I left pleasant Crete, to be a drudge and a pack horse here in
  Rome, where a man may sweat all his life in another's service without being
  once thanked for his pains, and perhaps be laid out, look ye, for a supper to
  the vultures at last, because no body will treat his carcass to a blaze of
  old sticks, I say, that if the Lady Rubellia contrives to give Sextus such
  another philtre as that, the game's up, Master Valerius; and we may as well
  set about painting the dead, as try to save him from her clutches. The man's
  gone he's as lost as Troy."&mdash;"Well, Dromo," said I, for I perceived
  there was no use in fighting it with him, "and have you not been able to hit
  upon any feasible scheme?"&mdash;"Ay, have you come to that at last? that is
  just what I have been cudgelling my brains about for the last twelve hours.
  But if I do hit upon any thing, I shall need assistance. In such cases, the
  best judgment can do nothing by itself."&mdash;"Fear not, Dromo," quoth I;
  "if my assistance can do you any good, you well know you can command it to
  the utmost."&mdash;"Then prepare," replied the Cretan, rising up with an air
  of much solemnity " then prepare in good earnest; for, may Cerberus growl
  upon me, if I don't find out some scheme before another day goes over, and
  show you all what stuff I am made of. To think of entrapping Sextus without
  consulting Dromo! No, by Cretan Jove, she shall not accomplish it no, not
  even with a sea of philtres."</p>

  <p>"And, in the meantime," said I, "what must Sextus do with
  himself?"&mdash;"He must not go near the Suburra; he must remain closely at
  home; and as for tasting any thing at her house, or any thing that comes from
  her by heavens, if he does not take his oath against that we may as well
  leave him to his destiny. If he will but take good care for this one day, I
  think there is every chance something may be hit upon ere the morning. I have
  got my cue, and shall not be idle, I promise you; but I undertake nothing,
  unless you swear to keep Sextus safe, and at a distance from her, till
  night-fall."" Good Dromo," said I, "make yourself easy on that score; it will
  be a new circumstance indeed, if we find any difficulty in persuading Sextus
  to stay a single day away from the Suburra."</p>

  <p>"Persuading!" quoth the slave; "who ever heard of such a word as
  persuasion at such a crisis as this? I tell you he must be kept away; and if
  no other plan can be fallen on, I have a great mind to turn the key on him
  and his pedagogue both together. I heard them hammering at their lessons
  already as I came along and that puts me in mind that I have a very shrewd
  notion there is more between that bearded goat of ours and this Rubellia,
  than any of us had been suspecting. Unless that Calabrian lies and I think
  lying is above his sphere this old rogue has been oftener in the Suburra of
  late than we had any thought of. So help me Hermes! I believe Licinius has
  been employing him to go his private messages to Rubellia but that is only
  one insult more, and I shall have my revenge all in a lump."</p>

  <p>"I think it very likely," answered I, quietly, "that Licinius may have
  been employing Xerophrastes in some such embassies; and, if I mistake not the
  matter, he would feel himself quite as much in his element, trotting along
  the Sacred Way, and so forth, on such delicate errands for the father, as in
  expounding musty parchments to the son."&mdash;"No matter for all that,"
  quoth Dromo, rubbing his hands; "the more enemies the more glory. Would
  Miltiades have been pleased had the Spartans arrived? Leave all to me take
  you care only of Sextus, and I am not afraid for any reinforcement that
  rascally rhetorician may bring against me." While he was saying so, the face
  of the Cretan exhibited symptoms of incipient glee; and he concluded with
  snapping his fingers, and uttering a short keen whistle, such as you have
  heard from the lips of a hunter, when the dogs begin to bay around a
  thicket.</p>

  <p>Seeing his eyes dance with the expectation of some bustling scene, I could
  not help participating, in some measure, in the feelings of the Cretan; and,
  "Dear Dromo," said I, "I beseech you, if it be possible, let me have a share
  in whatever you resolve upon."&mdash;"Watch well," replied he, "during the
  day, and you shall see what you shall see, when the moon mounts above the
  Coelian, and the hour for grubbing among herbs and bones is come. But now I
  hear some one coming it is Licinius." Dromo, finger on lip, glided from the
  room. Nor had his well-practised ears deceived him, for he scarcely vanished,
  before my kinsman entered.</p>

  <p>"Valerius," said he, saluting me affectionately, "I thought you were
  probably much fatigued with your spectacles, so I desired that nobody should
  call you this morning; but I met Boto in the hall, and hearing that you were
  astir, I have come up, for I wish a little private conversation. Shall we
  walk in the eastern portico, till Xerophrastes leaves Sextus at liberty."</p>

  <p>He led the way along the gallery, and in passing, we also heard the deep
  voice of the rhetorician resounding among the pillars, and could even catch a
  few of the magniloquent phrases with which he was feeding the ears of his
  pupil. "Ay, ay," says Licinius, "I wish, indeed, it were possible to inspire
  the youth with some sense of what is due to the dignity of principle, and how
  absurd it is to think of gratifying whims at the expense of duty. But I fear
  the boy is incorrigible; and, Gains, I am sorry to say, I suspect you have
  been looking on his errors with a countenance rather of favour and of
  confirmation, than, as I should have expected, of rebuke."</p>

  <p>"Licinius," said I, "you know not how much you distress me. I could rather
  die than encourage Sextus in any thing I thought evil; but, indeed, I have
  seen nothing to make me imagine him capable of such conduct."</p>

  <p>"Come, by Hercules," returned he, "there is no occasion for so many words.
  I thought it very odd that you went away so soon from the Forum the other
  day, considering that you had never been there before; but I thought it
  doubly and trebly remarkable that Sextus should have accompanied you, when
  the case in hand affected the affairs of Rubellia. But I have since found out
  that it was not the society of old Capito which attracted him no, my friend,
  nor yet the alarm of a thunder storm that detained you at the villa. In a
  word, Valerius, I strongly suspect that Sextus is carrying on an intrigue
  with a young lady whom I never saw, but who, I am quite sure, will never be
  mistress of a dozen lizards, and that this is the true cause of his
  reluctance concerning a match, which, to say nothing of the pleasure it would
  give to me, is the only means by which I can see any prospect of the young
  man's fortune being made, and the dignity of his family kept up, after
  another effigy shall have been added to our hall. Infatuated and headstrong
  boy! if he owes nothing to himself or to me, is it possible that he can look
  upon that venerable line of sages and heroes, without feeling shame in the
  degradation of his own earth- stooping desires?"</p>

  <p>"Without question," said I, "you allude to the Lady Rubellia, whom, as I
  have heard from various quarters, you are desirous of seeing wedded to
  Sextus."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Caius Valerius, it is indeed to her I allude; and it is of the
  obstacle which unwittingly, I doubt not you yourself have been throwing in
  the way of that union, that I have now to make my complaint. Not such the
  service that I had expected from my kinsman. Rubellia is descended from a
  noble family, and, both in possession and expectation, her wealth is great.
  Two heavy fines laid upon me by Domitian, and the expense at which I have
  maintained my rank among the great patrons of Rome these things together have
  impoverished me, and to an extent not altogether convenient. In this boy my
  hopes were placed; and see now how they are all likely to be blasted for a
  dimpled cheek and a pair of wanton eyes! or rather, indeed, I should say, for
  the sake of the malignant pleasure that is derived from thwarting my
  purposes; for, if beauty were what the boy wanted, where should he find
  beauty beyond Rubellia? Perhaps, Caius, I should, before this time, have made
  you acquainted with my intentions from my own lips. But it is my own foolish
  indulgence which has made my degenerate boy quite forget, not only what is
  the duty of a son, but what is the power of a father."</p>

  <p>"I trust," said I, "there is no need for all this seriousness. Sextus has
  only laid aside the garb of a stripling it is too much to be despairing of
  his success in life, only because he is unwilling, at a period so early, to
  enter upon a permanent connection. Is it possible, that, if he really dislike
  Rubellia, you would wish to see him marry her only to divorce her, without
  question, as soon as he should find it possible to do so without
  inconvenience T " Handsome, rich, noble, and almost as young as himself, why,
  in the name of all the gods, for what cause should he divorce Rubellia?"
  "Sir," said I, "he loves not Rubellia, nor will ever love her; and if you
  cause your son to marry this woman, look you well to it, that the unhappiness
  of both rest not on your head. Handsome, rich, noble, and young she may be;
  but I am sure, she has neither such a heart, nor such a mind, as should
  belong to the wife of your Sextus. A luxurious woman is Rubellia, and I have
  seen her find luxury in the contemplation of blood. Wed not Rubellia to your
  son."&mdash;"Peace, Valerius," he answered; "what boyish nonsense is this? I
  will wed Rubellia to my son; and let him see to it, that he tempts me not
  farther with his disobedience."</p>

  <p>Licinius said these last words in a voice of so much earnestness, that I
  knew not well what answer to make to him; but while I was hesitating, one of
  the little boys about the house, (I mean the children of the domestic
  slaves,) said, "If it please my lord, the same senator that was here in the
  morning is waiting in the hall."&mdash;"Pontius Mamurra!" said the orator,
  leaving me.</p>

  <p>I, for my part, when I heard the name of the visitor, began to understand
  somewhat of the channel through which my kinsman had been informed about what
  had passed at the Suburban. I had no leisure, however, to reflect long upon
  this hint; for I found Sextus waiting for me. "Come," he said, "I was afraid
  I must set off without you. My father has been looking on me this morning
  with such an aspect of displeasure as I rarely before witnessed in him, and
  if I defer going to the painter about this likeness, he will be altogether
  enraged at supper-time. I know very well he means the ring, in which it is to
  be placed, for another present to Rubellia; but notwithstanding, what can I
  do? Any opposition to him in lesser matters would only tend to bring on some
  final explanation about the great affair itself, and that, whether it be
  weakness in me or not, I as yet have no courage to encounter. The man must be
  expecting me; and I am sure you will accompany me, for I have much need of
  you to keep up my heart. Xerophrastes, indeed, has been desired to go with
  me; but he will be no comfort, for I see plainly, from the drift of his
  harangues, that he is enlisted against me. Dear Caius, I have nobody in the
  whole world I can trust to but Dromo and yourself."</p>

  <p>He had scarcely said so, when we heard Xerophrastes pacing up and down
  with solemn strides in the gallery; so I knew not how to excuse myself,
  although I was very anxious to have staid at home for another purpose. Sextus
  had taken my gown from the nail; he threw it over my shoulders before I had
  time to say any thing, and we were soon on our way to his ungrateful
  destination.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch202"
     name="ch202">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WE had to traverse a considerable part of the city; for this
  painter was one of those who exercise their art during the public hours of
  the day in the baths of the Palatine, where, as you have heard, in the wide
  circuit of the princely residence, abundant accommodation is set forth for
  all such ingenious persons. We proceeded along the edge of the river, and by
  the west of the Capitol, following the line of that great Triumphal Way which
  has been witness of so many glorious pageants; for so, they told me, we
  should most easily ascend into the Caesarian courts. But when we had come
  thither, we found the whole open space, in front of the portico and stairs of
  Trajan, occupied by a detachment of the Praetorian cohorts, drawn up in
  splendid array to receive some promised donative; while the music, and the
  clamours of their mustering, had collected enough of spectators to render the
  passage onwards in some measure difficult. We were constrained to form part
  of their attendance, and stood gazing among the multitude. Even Xerophrastes
  caught some animation from the brilliancy of the spectacle; and the enamoured
  and perplexed Sextus himself, beating time on my shoulder, seemed to have
  forgotten, for a moment, the anxieties of his situation.</p>

  <p>Some horsemen, however, riding along to keep the ground open in front of
  the soldiery, compelled us to shift to the eastward, where many chariots were
  drawn up and in one of these Rubellia. The lady looked paler than I had
  before seen her, and had not the air of being in the smallest degree occupied
  with what was passing. I did not think it necessary to take any notice of her
  being there to my companions, and was willing, indeed, to keep myself turned
  away from the place where she sat, in order to avoid our being recognized.
  Yet there was something in her aspect and attitude, that, as by a sort of
  fascination, drew my eyes to the spot I wished to avoid. From time to time,
  therefore, I felt myself constrained to regard the melancholy lady; and by
  and by, Sextus perceived what it was that attracted my attention: so I
  discovered, although he said not a word, from a fervent pressure upon my arm
  as I stood before him. At that moment there drew near a little ugly old
  woman, with no covering upon her head but long coarse gray clusters of hair
  hanging matted and twisted down upon her shoulders, who lifted up a basket of
  trinkets, and presented it; but Rubellia started on her seat, and, looking in
  the face of the old creature, manifested signs of no trivial emotion; for her
  colour returned with a sudden flush, and her eyes recovered all their
  animation, and it was evident she had something to say which could not regard
  the gaudy ornaments offered to her view. Whatever it was, however, she did
  not occupy much time in saying it; for scarcely a minute elapsed before the
  basket was lowered again, and the old woman began to move towards another
  part of the crowd; on which Rubellia sunk back in her chariot, and appeared
  to relapse Into pensive abstraction.</p>

  <p>Presently a low voice croaking out, "Rings, rings amulets and rings!"
  amongst the crowd that stood immediately behind me; and I perceived the same
  woman pushing her basket between Xerophrastes and Sextus. "Noble youth,"
  quoth the hag, leering, "lovely young gentleman sweet Adonis, my charming
  lord, do now look into old Pona's basket do take a look at Ponula's rings and
  amulets her amulets and rings. Here is one that I could have sold a hundred
  times, but I was determined to keep it till I should see the prettiest young
  gentleman in Rome, and I will never go back to Naples without selling it,
  after this day; for this little amulet must be nobody's but yours. You will
  break my heart, my prince, if you buy not my beautiful amulet."</p>

  <p>"And what," said Sextus, blushing and laughing, "may be the virtues of
  your amulet?"</p>

  <p>Then laying her yellow hand upon his shoulder, till she had made him stoop
  down so that she might get close to his ear, she began to pour out, with much
  mysterious volubility, all the story of its marvellous potencies; but what
  she said even I could not know, only I heard the words, "Aethiopian,
  Aethiopian," and "Memnon, Memnon," and something about "not a pretty lady in
  Rome." But just as the woman was most earnest in her whisper, and Sextus,
  apparently at least, in listening, I found my gown plucked from behind, and
  behold, there was Dromo, with a countenance tremulously agitated, and white
  as a piece of dead parchment, pointing to his young master and the old hag,
  and beseeching me to separate them, by motions in nowise to be mistaken. How
  he had come thither, or what was the cause of this anxiety, I had no time to
  conjecture, for before I could say a word, he began to bellow out, "The
  horses, the horses make room for the horses;" and immediately those that
  stood near him began to move a little, and then, the cry being repeated,
  those that stood farther off mistaking the noise of their feet for the
  approach of some new squadron, there arose a sort of rushing among the crowd;
  and, in a twinkling, the voice of Pona was heard grumbling and croaking at a
  distance from the place to which our party were borne. Close, nevertheless,
  did the faithful Cretan stick to us; and no sooner was quiet in some measure
  restored, and the false alarm he had created at an end, than he whispered
  into my ear, "For the sake of all that is sacred, let not that foul hag speak
  another word to my young master I will tell you more anon. Meantime, haste
  ye, haste ye. Make the best of your speed to the Palatine; it will be much
  easier for you to push your way thither, than it was for me to reach
  you."</p>

  <p>My friend being already weary of the heat and the pressure, we were ready
  to take advantage of an opening pointed out by the Cretan. It so happened,
  however, that in the same commotion the chariot of Rubellia also had changed
  its situation; for just as we had escaped, as I thought, and were about to
  place our feet on the magnificent flight of stairs that leads from the New
  Way to the Augustan Towers, there came to us a lad of that lady's household,
  who told us she was near at hand, and desirous, if it so pleased us, of our
  company. Aware that we were in sight, how could we disobey? We found the lady
  in her chariot, but not such as we had seen her before. On the contrary, the
  liveliness of her aspect seemed now to be restored, and she received us with
  her usual gaiety of address. "Careless men," said she, as we drew near; "I
  suppose I might have sat here till the Greek Kalends, before any one of you
  would have observed me.</p>

  <p>"Most noble lady," quoth Xerophrastes, "bear it not indignantly, that
  amidst all the confusion of men and horses, and trumpets and shoutings, our
  attention was abstracted from that which was most worthy of notice. My young
  friends deserve to be excused, since even I, who am not in the habit of being
  much troubled by such vanities, was so bewildered that I scarcely knew my
  right hand from my left, in this human chaos. Pardon, noble Rubellia; we have
  been unwitting offenders."</p>

  <p>"And was it so?" said the lady, not looking at the Stoic. "But I did not
  call for you to hear useless apologies. What new sight is it that attracts
  you to the Palatine? or is it only that you are desirous of exhibiting to
  Valerius the old-established wonders of the place? In either case, I have
  half a mind to accompany you. In spite of all they tell us about the Golden
  House, I can scarcely think the Palatine showed more splendidly than it does
  now, even in the days of Nero."</p>

  <p>"Indeed," said I, as we began to mount together the broad slabbed steps
  which rise up, tier above tier, from the portico on the street, to that which
  hangs on the brow " Indeed, it is not easy for me to doubt that Rubellia is
  in the right." For now, on one side, were all the pillars and arches of the
  Forum stretched out below us, and, on the other, lay the great Circus, topped
  with its obelisk; while before rose the gray cliffs of the Capitoline, with
  their domes and proud pinnacles in the glow of noontide the space between,
  radiant with arms and banners. Even Xerophrastes did not refrain from some
  ejaculations. "Illustrious Rome! how great is thy sublimity!" And then, after
  a pause, he repeated, in a voice of much majesty, those verses from the Fury
  of Ajax:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"Oh! might I be where o'er the living deep<br>
  Lies the broad shadow of the Sounian cliff,<br>
  Waving with all its glorious garniture,<br>
  Of rock-sprung foliage: from old Ocean's side,<br>
  That I might look on Athens once again!"</p><br>

  <p>Some of the hints which had reached me concerning his nativity recurring
  to my recollection, I could not help echoing his quotation with another from
  the Aeneid, about the wide tracts ploughed by the Thracians; of which
  impertinence the sage took no notice.</p>

  <p>Nor was admiration diminished when, having gained the top of that massive
  staircase, or rather, as I should say, hill of marble, we passed beneath the
  sounding portal, the sole remnant of the original pile of Augustus, and found
  ourselves within the first of those great imperial quadrangles, by which the
  whole summit of that once so variously and multitudinously peopled region is
  now occupied. The light and airy porticos the domes the princely towers the
  universal profusion of marble, brass, ivory, flaming gold, lavished on arch,
  metope, and architrave all conspired to dazzle the sight, and I stood still
  to gaze.</p>

  <p>"Observe," said Sextus, "those two equestrian statues of bronze on the
  left hand. I have heard my father say that they mark the sites of two houses,
  which, before Augustus began to enclose the whole Palatine in his walls, were
  inhabited, the one by Cicero, the other by Clodius; these are the only traces
  of their mansions."</p>

  <p>"What grim-looking figures!" said the lady; "yet, I dare say, they don't
  cast half such fierce looks on each other, as the predecessors you mention. I
  should like to have seen the countenance of old Tully, the morning he went
  down the hill to deliver his harangue for Milo."</p>

  <p>"I am glad," said I, "that Sextus has told me this; for in reading those
  famous philippics in time to come, I shall possess a new key to the
  bitterness of their phraseology, knowing, as I do, that the two lived just
  over the way from each other, and that the orator, when his spirits were
  flagging, could derive a new reinforcement of spleen from merely putting his
  head out of the window."&mdash;"To hear you," says Rubellia, "one would think
  you were studying the art of making philippics I am afraid, that if it be so,
  my joining your party may prove to have been but an ill-judged thing; for if
  any of you be preparing to abuse me, my presence will serve to sharpen your
  weapons."&mdash;"In that case, however," interrupted the smiling
  Xerophrastes, "my noble lady will admit, that the converse also will hold
  good, and that if praise be in meditation, it will not be the feebler because
  the subject of the intended panegyric has passed before our
  eyes."&mdash;"Most courteous of men," replied the lady, "who talks of the
  stiffness of the Porch? To-day and yesterday you have paid me as many
  compliments as might give a lesson to the gayest trifler about these baths.
  If all," she continued, (gazing as she spoke, with all her eyes upon Sextus,)
  " if all were as profuse, I should be unable to sustain the weight of their
  civilities."&mdash;"Nay, Oh! generous lady," quoth the sage again, "it must
  be remembered, that, as the poet has expressed it, there are two kinds of
  shame there is the wicked shame and the good shame. Why should it be doubted,
  that a modest verecundity, not unsuitable to their age, has laid her finger
  on the lips of our young friends? I swear by the Victrix of Ida, that your
  presence itself is that which occasions their silence; bear it not ill bear
  it not harshly the young will learn not every one has seen
  Corinth."&mdash;"No, truly," answered the laughing lady; "but I doubt whether
  they that have been so fortunate, have ever seen any thing half so fine as
  what now awaits Valerius."</p>

  <p>She pointed to the solemn Doric columns which sustain the portico of the
  famous Temple of Apollo, whose shade lay far out upon the court before us;
  and, passing between those brazen horsemen, we soon began to ascend the steps
  that lead up to the shrine. Nor can I tell you how delightful was the
  fragrant coolness, which reigned beneath the influence of that massive canopy
  of marble, to us whose eyes had been so long supporting the meridian blaze.
  We entered with slow steps within the vestibule of the Temple, and stood
  there for some space, enjoying in silence the soft breath of air that played
  around the flowing fountains. Then passing on, the airy hall received us; and
  I saw the statue of Phoebus presiding, like a pillar of tender light, over
  the surrounding darkness of the vaulted place; for, to the lofty shrine of
  the God of day no light of day had access, and there lay only a small
  creeping flame burning thin upon his altar; but a dim and sweet radiance,
  like that of the stars in autumn, was diffused all upon the statue, and the
  altar, and the warlike trophies suspended in the inner recesses, from the
  sacred tree of silver that stands in the centre; amidst the trembling
  enamelled leaves and drooping boughs of which hung many lamps, after the
  shape and fashion of pomegranates: and out of every pomegranate flowed a
  separate gleam of that soft light, supplied mysteriously through the stem of
  the silver tree.</p>

  <p>There appeared presently from behind the statue, a majestic woman, arrayed
  in long white garments, and having a fillet of laurel leaves twined above her
  veil. Venerable and stately was her mien, but haughty, rather than serene,
  the Aspect of her countenance. Without looking towards us, she went up to the
  altar, and began to busy herself in trimming the sacred fire, which, as I
  have said, exhibited only a lambent flame. When, with many kneelings and
  other ceremonies, she had accomplished this service, the priestess turned
  again, as if to depart; and then first, as it seemed, observing the presence
  of strangers, she stood still before the altar, and regarding us attentively,
  began to recognize the Lady Rubellia; whom, forthwith advancing, she saluted
  courteously, and invited to come with the rest of us into her privacy, behind
  the shrine of the God.</p>

  <p>She led the way, Rubellia and the rest of us in her train, through several
  folding-doors, and along many narrow passages all inlaid, on roof, wall, and
  floor, with snow-white alabaster and rich mosaic work; until at length we
  came to a little airy chamber, where three young maidens were sitting with
  their embroidering cushions, while one, taller than the rest, whose back was
  placed towards us, knelt on the floor, touching, with slow fingers, the
  strings of a Dorian lyre. Hearing the sound of her music as we entered, we
  stood still in the door-way, and the priestess, willing apparently that our
  approach should remain unknown, advancing a step or two before us, said,
  "Sing on I have trimmed the flame; but remember, I pray you, that the
  precincts of Phoebus are not those of Pluto, and let not your chant be of
  such funereal solemnity. We solitaries have little need of depressing
  numbers."</p>

  <p>"Dear friend," replied she that had been thus addressed, without changing
  her attitude, "you must bear with my numbers such as they are; for if you bid
  me sing only merry strains, I am afraid neither voice nor fingers may be able
  well to obey you."</p>

  <p>These words were spoken in a low and melancholy voice, which I well
  recognized. Sextus, also, perceived who spoke; but when he looked at me to
  signify this, I motioned to keep silence.</p>

  <p>"Then please yourself," said the priestess, laying her hand on Athanasia's
  shoulders; "but do sing, for I should fain have my maidens to hear something
  truly of your music." With that she again applied her fingers to the lyre,
  and stooping over it, began to play some notes of prelude, less sorrowful
  than what we had at first heard. "Ay, my dear girl," says the priestess, "you
  could not have chosen better. Heavens! how many lordly choirs have I heard
  singing to that old Delian air. There are a hundred hymns that may be sung to
  it give us whichsoever of them pleases your fancy the best."&mdash;"I will
  try," replied the maiden, "to sing the words you have heard before. If I
  remember, you liked them." Then boldly at once, yet gently, did her voice
  rush into the current of that ancient strain that you have heard so often;
  but it was then that I myself for the first time heard it.</p><br>

  <p class="verse">The moon, the moon is thine, night,<br>
  Not altogether dark art thou;<br>
  Her trembling crescent sheds its light,<br>
  Trembling and pale, upon thine ancient brow.</p>

  <p class="verse">The moon is thine, and round her orb<br>
  A thousand sweet stars minister,<br>
  Whose twinkling rays dark wells absorb,<br>
  And all the wide seas drink them far and near.</p>

  <p class="verse">They kiss the wide sea, and swift smiles<br>
  Of gladness o'er the waters creep;<br>
  Old hoary rocks rejoice, and isles,<br>
  And there is glory on the slumbering deep</p>

  <p class="verse">Afar. Along the black hill's side,<br>
  Right blithe of heart the wanderers go,<br>
  While that soft radiance, far and wide,<br>
  Gleams on the winding streams and woods below.</p>

  <p class="verse">And gaily for the fragile bark,<br>
  Through the green waves its path is shorn,<br>
  When all the murmurs of the dark<br>
  Cold sea lie calm'd beneath that gliding horn.</p>

  <p class="verse">Yet hail, ye glittering streaks, that lie<br>
  The eastern mountain tops upon!<br>
  Hail, ye deep blushes of the sky,<br>
  That speak the coming of the bridegroom sun!</p>

  <p class="verse">Hail to the healing beam of day,<br>
  That rouses every living thing!<br>
  The forest gulphs confess thy sway,<br>
  And upon freshening branches glad birds sing.</p>

  <p class="verse">And loathsome forms, that crept unseen<br>
  Beneath the star-light faint and wan,<br>
  Cower in their brakes the thorns between,<br>
  Dreading that fervid eye, and its sure scan</p>

  <p class="verse">Triumphant. Welcome life and light!<br>
  Sing rocks and mountains, plain and sea;<br>
  Fearful though lovely was the night;<br>
  Hail to more perfect beauty hail&mdash;to THEE!</p><br>

  <p>"Why stop you, Athanasia?" said the priestess, finding that here she
  paused,&mdash;" why do you rise up, and take your fingers from the lyre,
  before you sing out the chorus?"&mdash;"No more, dear aunt excuse me no more.
  I have already sung all that I can," replied Athanasia. "Nay, then," says
  she, "if you be fatigued, sing not; but join me, maidens, in the close
  perhaps it rises too high for Athanasia."</p>

  <p>And with that the ancient lady herself, joined by the three damsels that
  had been embroidering, took up the strain, which, indeed, rose higher towards
  its end</p><br>

  <p class="verse">Hail to thee Phoebus, son of Jove,<br>
  Glorious Apollo, Lord of Light,<br>
  Hail, lovely in thy Delian grove,<br>
  And terrible on Delphos' haunted height!</p>

  <p class="verse">Hail to thee here beneath the dome,<br>
  Great Phoebus, of thy Latian shrine;<br>
  All hail from Caesar and from Rome;<br>
  Hail by thy dearest name, God Palatine!</p><br>

  <p>But as they were singing the last verse of all, Rubellia also aided their
  melody "with a rich strong gushing voice, which rose far above all the
  others; and the silent Athanasia turning round quickly, perceived, not
  without manifestation of alarm, by how many strangers her song had been
  overheard. On seeing who we were, she saluted Sextus and myself with modest
  courtesy, amidst her confusion; and it may be that my companion, as well as
  myself, blushed at the same moment; for he could not see Athanasia without
  thinking of Sempronia.</p>

  <p>It seemed as if her confusion were not unconnected with some suspicion of
  having been recognized near the Praetorian guard-house; for, after the first
  glance, I in vain endeavoured to meet her eye; while, on the contrary, to
  Sextus she directed both looks and words, enough to provoke visibly some not
  altogether benign movements in our Rubellia. Such, at least, was my
  interpretation of the fair widow's aspect, and the tone of impatience in
  which she, after a minute or two had passed, began to urge the propriety of
  our proceeding to the part of the imperial edifice in which the painter was
  expecting us.</p>

  <p>The priestess of Apollo hearing her say so, courteously offered to guide
  us beyond the precincts of the temple, and our whole party were again in
  motion; but Athanasia remained behind with the three young damsels, and I,
  who walked last, saw her, ere the portal received me, preparing again to
  handle the lyre, with fingers visibly trembling, and a pale countenance, not
  as I thought unstained with some yet more distinct traces of keen emotion.
  The sight of her agitation fixed my footstep for a moment, and it was then
  that, on her casting a sudden glance round to the place where I stood, I
  perceived truly that I had not been mistaken, and that the tears were
  gathered within her eyelids. It was no more, however, than one glance, for
  immediately she stooped again, and, dashing her fingers along the chords of
  the instrument, appeared to bury her thoughts in its harmony. I stood for a
  moment, and then ashamed of myself, and troubled with her troubles and with
  my own, I followed the rest into the great library which Augustus placed
  beneath the protection of the Palatine Apollo. The priestess parted from us
  at its entrance, after pointing out a low and massive door of bronze on the
  right hand, within which, as she told me, the remains of the Sybilline
  prophecies are preserved, unseen by profane eyes, watched over perpetually by
  the guardians of the place.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch203"
     name="ch203">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I HAD walked by the side of my young friend, and behind the
  Stoic, (who, I think, was expressing, in his pompous fashion, much admiration
  of the singing of Rubellia,) along one or two of the great halls in which the
  library is contained, before the novelty of the objects surrounding me made
  any impression even on my eyes; and even after these were in some measure
  engaged, my mind still continued to dwell on that troubled aspect, and on the
  notes of the uncompleted song. At length, however, the levity of youth, and
  natural curiosity revived; and I began to be present, not in body merely, in
  a place where there was much that might well interest the mind. Far-receding
  rows of columns conducted my eyes into the interminable recesses of that wide
  range of chambers, in which the records of the thought and spirit of all past
  ages are piled up together; and gazing on the loaded shelves which every
  where ascended into the galleries, I could not but be affected with many new
  emotions. I perused glorious names on the busts that seemed to preside over
  the different compartments. The high filletted front of Homer detained for
  the first time my contemplation; the eyes of the divine old man, even in
  sculpture, distinctly and visibly blind, while the serenity and sanctity of
  the towering forehead, revealed how the intense perception at once of the
  lovely and the great could compensate for visions of earthly beauty shut out.
  The mild Plato, and the imperious Stagyrite Pindar Simonides Alcaeus and I
  know not how many more, succeeded as we passed along each in his own sphere,
  reigning by himself; yet all connected together by a certain common air of
  greatness, like so many successive princes, or contemporary heroes of the
  same mighty empire.</p>

  <p>From this main range, there diverged many lesser chambers, in which we saw
  studious persons engaged, each seated by himself, and having his eyes fixed
  on the parchment before him. Of these, some deigned not to intimate by the
  smallest movement their perception that any one had approached; but with
  others Xerophrastes exchanged, as he walked, lofty salutation, and one or two
  even entered, for a moment, into conversation with him. With one of these,
  indeed, (an ancient of bitter aspect,) to such a length did the colloquy
  extend, that we began to think we should never be able to get our Stoic away
  from him; till, as our fortune would have it, it became necessary for them to
  have a certain book for the purpose of reference, and then Xerophrastes began
  to make inquiries concerning Parmeno, who, as I gathered, must needs be one
  of those intrusted with the care of the library.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," said the other, "if we must wait for him, we shall not be
  able to get that work either to-day or to-morrow; for his pupil, the son of
  Fabricius, is dead, and I suppose he will now change his quarters, and be no
  longer seen so often about these haunts of the muses."</p>

  <p>"Alas!" interrupted Sextus, "I met Fabricius in the Forum a few days ago,
  and he told me his son was ill; but little did I imagine my dear companion
  was so near his end! Is it indeed so?"</p>

  <p>"Even so," rejoined the other. "Rapid have been the shears of Atropos! It
  is but a few moments since Agaso, the painter passed; and, he told me he had
  been receiving orders to take a likeness, as well as he could, from the
  corpse."</p>

  <p>"If Agaso be so engaged," replied Xerophrastes, "I am afraid we need not
  expect to find him neither in his usual place. Perhaps we had better make
  inquiry for him at the dwelling of Fabricius."</p>

  <p>To this Sextus assented; or rather, being lost in reflection concerning
  the death of his friend, he suffered himself to be conducted by the Stoic.
  Passing, therefore, through one or two more apartments, we issued forth, and
  drew near to the vestibule of Fabricius' house, who, as they told me, was a
  noble Roman, having the chief superintendance of the whole library, and an
  intimate friend of Licinius one whose domestic calamity could not fail to
  spread much affliction through a wide circle of patrician kindred.</p>

  <p>At the vestibule, we found assembled not a few of the young man's
  relations; but Xerophrastes immediately said, "Behold Parmeno, he is the most
  afflicted; and what wonder that it should t?e so?"</p>

  <p>"Alas!" said Sextus, "the bier is set forth; the last rites are to be
  performed this evening."</p>

  <p>This Parmeno was a striking figure. Seated close by the bier, his head was
  involved in his cloak, so that only his eyes and his nose could be seen, but
  these of themselves expressed a decorous affliction; and the folds of the
  cloak fell down over the rest of his person in great order and dignity. On
  the pavement beside him was seen lying, half-unfolded, a book inscribed with
  the name of Heraclitus, which he appeared to have been reading. When
  Xerophrastes approached, this mourner stretched forth his hand, and shook his
  head, but he did not say any thing, nor even look towards the rest of us; and
  indeed to have done so, would have disturbed the attitude in which he had
  placed himself. Xerophrastes, on his part, received the proffered hand, and
  shaking his head in response, said, "Yes, my Ionian friend, I may still bid
  thee hail and live; but I must say farewell to the plant thou wast rearing.
  Farewell to the youthful promise of Fabricius!"</p>

  <p>On hearing these words, the sitting philosopher drew his mantle quite over
  his face, and leant himself heavily against one of the fluted columns of the
  vestibule, for he seemed to be much shaken. In the meantime Sextus approached
  the bier, and contemplated his companion as he lay there wreathed with
  melancholy garlands; his countenance bearing a natural mixture of sadness and
  astonishment. Nor could I, who had never before seen the young man, behold
  the spectacle without similar emotions; for his age, as it seemed, could not
  have been much different from my own, and the pale features were interesting,
  their expression not less amiable than solemn.</p>

  <p>"Alas!" said Sextus, "the last time I saw him, how differently did he
  appear! We rode out together with some others to Tibur, and spent all the day
  there; and as we returned by the moonlight, how joyous his conversation!
  Methinks I yet hear him laughing and speaking. We parted at the foot of the
  Capitoline, and never did I see him again till now."</p>

  <p>"Oh, fate of man!" quoth Xerophrastes; "how uncertain is life, how certain
  death! Without doubt, young Fabricius had as little thought of dying as any
  of your company; and yet, see now, he is arrayed for the last time, and this
  juvenile gown, which he should so soon have laid aside for the manly, is
  destined to be consumed with him."</p>

  <p>"A fine lad he was," cries one of the standers-by, "a fine lad, and an
  excellent horseman. The Martian Field did not often behold such a rider in
  these degenerate days of the Roman youth."</p>

  <p>But while the rest were still contemplating the bier, Xerophrastes,
  turning to his brother philosopher, said, "Tell me now, my learned friend, do
  you still, after this mournful event, continue to reside with the elder
  Fabricius? Has that excellent man any more sons to be educated, or will he
  retain you only for the sake of the library, with which assuredly he will
  find few so conversant as yourself?"</p>

  <p>To which Parmeno replied, "Your question, Xerophrastes, shows that clear
  judgment concerning the affairs of men, for which you have always been
  celebrated. No, my friend, the gray-haired Fabricius no longer requires my
  residence here; for he is about to retire into one of his villas on the
  Campanian shore, and to bury for ever his affliction in the privacy of his
  woods. We are about to part, not without mutual tears; and several Patricians
  have already been applying to him for his influence with me, whom, although
  unworthy of so much research, they earnestly covet, and wish to engage as the
  instructor of their young men. I have been sitting here not unseen, beside
  this my former charge, and each is impatient to solicit me into his
  service."</p>

  <p>"Your reputation I well know is high," replied Xerophrastes, "and
  deservedly so; more particularly, for that fine talent you have for giving
  metaphysical interpretations of mythology, and for explaining the obscure
  allegories of ancient poets. But for my own part, Parmeno, I find not so much
  delight in abstract ideas, or in the passive contemplation of the universe;
  but incline rather to study, as heretofore, that part of philosophy which
  relates to action, and the morality of duty."</p>

  <p>"Yes, worthy Xerophrastes," returned he, with a most languid serenity;
  "and so far as I understand, you sort well in this with the stirring
  disposition of your friend Licinius."</p>

  <p>To which Xerophrastes made answer: "My patron Licinius is fond of action,
  and I of the rules of action. He says, it is only in war, or in civil
  functions of a public nature, that a person can prove himself a man. The
  rest, he says, is visionary, and comes to nothing, or is a slumber of the
  mind in sensuality, without thought."</p>

  <p>"Does he think, then," quoth Parmeno, his wobegone countenance relaxing
  into a smile, "Does Licinius think, then, there is no sensuality in perpetual
  action, and declamation and noise? To me such things appear almost as trivial
  as the lazy enjoyments of Epicureans, besides being harsh and disagreeable,
  and not unfrequently ridiculous. But observe, Xerophrastes! that I speak
  these things as it were abstractly, and not by any means in disparagement of
  Licinius, your excellent patron and friend."</p>

  <p>To which the stoic replied in astonishment " What is this you have said?
  Do you assert that action is sensual?"</p>

  <p>Then Parmeno, lifting from the pavement the book which he had been
  reading, or appearing to read, said, "It is even so, most erudite
  Xerophrastes. Indeed, I have always delighted in the most primitive and
  remote doctrines handed down from antiquity; and among others, in the riddles
  of this obscure Ephesian. Following the scope of his philosophy, I am led to
  believe, that, so often as the mind impels, or is impelled by other causes,
  it begins to lose sight of pure knowledge, and becomes in danger of thinking
  that every thing is vain, light, and evanescent, except what is perceived by
  the senses. Heraclitus well says, that Love and Hatred govern all things.
  Now, when the principle of Discord prevails, it subjects all things to the
  dominion of action, and to the gross perceptions of sense. But when that of
  Love is prevalent, it emancipates the struggling chaos of things from the
  yearning of compulsion, and from the darkness of sensual proximity; for,
  between things that struggle immediately against each other, light has no
  room to enter in and shine; and therefore it is, that, when Love gains the
  ascendency, a new arrangement is produced an arrangement which, if I may so
  express it, is more serene, transparent, orderly and divine, and wherein
  things exist in safety from the danger of mutual destruction."</p>

  <p>After a preliminary cough: " My opinion," replied Xerophrastes, "coincides
  rather with that of Empedocles. The immortal Sicilian thinks that Discord is
  the only separating and arranging principle which marks the boundaries
  between things, and enables them mutually to act and repel, in such a way as
  to preserve order."&mdash;"Nay, nay," interrupted Parmeno, his hands being by
  this quite disentangled from his cloak, and his countenance lighted up, "Nay,
  nay, to such doctrine I never shall assent. From Empedocles even from
  Xerophrastes, I must differ for ever on this head. The order of which you and
  the Sicilian speak, is the order of darkness only, and of blind force, a kind
  of order in which fierceness and cruelty always reign." But Xerophrastes
  continued:&mdash;"And I farther concur with Empedocles in thinking, that Love
  is a principle of which the predominance is more fit to turn order into a
  chaos, than to produce the effects you have described."&mdash;"Nay, speak not
  against Love," quoth Parmeno "Speak not against Love, nor believe that any
  respect is due to the dictates of Empedocles, who taught' the worst that can
  be taught by any man that is to say, the alternation of order and confusion
  succeeding each other throughout all time. To seek for truth in conceptions
  like these, is no better than to seek repose in the bosom of
  Aetna."&mdash;"In reference to that point," resumed Xerophrastes, "I agree
  with you in your disapprobation of Empedocles. But when you say, that Love is
  the source of knowledge, you much astonish me; for I have always thought
  rather that its tendency is to bring confusion upon the mind."</p>

  <p>"Once more," said Parmeno " once more, let me beseech you to say nothing
  against love. You are thinking of the love of particular objects. You speak
  of Cupid, and not of that heavenly Eros, who, so far from enchaining, or
  tyrannizing over the mind, rather enables it to escape into the tranquil
  freedom of far extended contemplation. But what is contemplation without the
  knowledge of permanent forms, on which the mind may find repose, and so keep
  itself from being perplexed by the shifting aspects of the many-coloured
  universe? And therefore it is, O Xerophrastes, that, sometimes laying aside
  Heraclitus, I study the ancient verses of the poet, Xenophanes, who shows, by
  the nature of abstract forms, that a certain unity pervades all things.
  Xenophanes mused of old at Colophon, looking through the blue ether of my
  native Ionia. But why should I speak thus at length? Alas! what is the
  occasion of our being here! I perceive the approach of the poet, who was to
  compose an inscription for the urn of my dear Fabricius. Yonder also is the
  architect, who comes with a design for the tomb. Oh! day of woe, that I
  should sit in judgment concerning the epitaph and tomb of my ingenuous
  youth!"</p>

  <p>"It is, indeed, true," replied Xerophrastes, "that even I, in the
  repercussions of our talk, had well-nigh forgotten this unhappy occurrence;
  but, perhaps, there is something not after all entirely excusable in our
  giving so much superiority to the affairs of philosophical discussion. Now,
  however, it is evident, that we must suspend our colloquy And who, I beseech
  you, above all things, is he that now draws near to the place of this
  mournful assembly, holding a horse in his hand. Methinks I have seen his face
  before."</p>

  <p>"That you have indeed, Master," quoth he that had come up, "that you have;
  and no longer ago than yesterday neither, if you will be pleased to give
  yourself the trouble of recollecting. My name is Aspar I am well known. If
  but my excellent friend, the noble Centurion Sabinus, were here, poor old
  Aspar would have no reason to complain of the want of a good word."</p>

  <p>"Good morrow to you, Aspar," said Sextus; "but what is it that brings you
  hither just at this moment? And for what purpose have you brought your horse
  with you? for people of your sort do not in general ride in the courts of the
  Palatine."</p>

  <p>"Alas!" quoth Aspar, "and is it you, who seem to nave been one of the
  contemporaries of that peerless youth is it you that ask such a question as
  this? I did not, in truth, imagine that there was any friend of young
  Fabricius, who did not know his affection for little Sora. There is not such
  another within twenty miles of the Capitol; but I brought her hither merely
  out of regard for the family. As for myself, I should never bear to look on
  her again with pleasure, after knowing the sudden manner of his death. I wish
  to Heaven the filly were fairly lodged in one of the paddocks of the Lord
  Fabricius himself."</p>

  <p>"Lead the animal round into the stables," says Parmeno, "and I doubt not
  care will be taken of her. Yonder comes one of the buffoons of the theatre;
  he, I doubt not, is here to disgrace, if he be permitted, this solemn scene,
  with ranting quotations from the tragic poets. Alas! alas! I cannot bear all
  this: There also advance the officiators from the Temple of Libitina; they
  have their cypress boughs ready in their hands. Oh, my learned friend, I
  cannot sustain these things; let me be gone into the mansion."</p>

  <p>The admirer of Heraclitus, picking up his scroll, and gathering together
  the folds of his mantle, moved slowly into the house, Xerophrastes following
  with similar gestures. Sextus and I also were about to take our departure;
  and he, having procured from one of the slaves of the house a myrtle garland,
  had already placed it upon the bier of the young Fabricius, as the last
  testimonial of his concern; when there drew near two young men, clad in long
  mantles of black, who, solemnly embracing my friend, began to exchange with
  him many expressions of grief.</p>

  <p>While they were thus engaged, Rubellia, who had been standing all this
  while a little apart, sent a boy to inform us that the painter we were in
  search of had at last made his appearance, and was anxious to proceed with
  his portrait. I drew Sextus away, therefore, and soon joined the lady and the
  artist; but as we were moving off thus, one of the by-standing slaves, an old
  gray-headed man, came up and whispered to Sextus, "Sir, be not deceived;
  these two nephews of my bereaved master are to me the most disagreeable part
  of all this preparation. You have heard their lamentation, and seen their
  sweeping raiment of mourning; but, be sure, a principal subject of their
  reflection is the probability that one or other of them must be adopted by
  Fabricius. Alas! alas! so goes all between Lucina and Libitina. There was
  never a birth nor a marriage that did not create some sorrow, nor a funeral
  procession that did not give rise to some joy. Your rhetoricians talk, but
  what avails it all? Slaves and masters are alike subjected to the evils of
  the world, and of these death is both the last and the least."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch204"
     name="ch204">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AGASO, the painter, was a smart dapper little bandy-legged
  man of Verona, dressed in a Grecian mantle, and endeavouring to look as much
  as possible like a Greek. Had Xerophrastes not gone off with his brother of
  Ionia, I have no doubt this man would have made his presence a sufficient
  excuse for speaking nothing but Greek to us; but, even as it was, his
  conversation was interlarded with an abundant intermixture of that noble
  tongue. Nothing could be spoken of which Agaso did not think fit to
  illustrate, either by the narration of something he himself had seen or heard
  during his residence at Athens, or, at least, by some quotation from the
  Grecian poets. To judge from the square, and somewhat ponderous formation of
  the man's features, Nature had not designed him for any of the most mercurial
  specimens of her workmanship; but he contrived, notwithstanding, by perpetual
  shrugging and grimacing, and, above all, by keeping his eyes and eyebrows
  continually in motion, to give himself an air of no inconsiderable life and
  vivacity.</p>

  <p>Hopping before us with much alacrity, this artist conducted our steps
  through eight or ten galleries, until at length a curtain being withdrawn,
  which had covered the space between two pilasters, we found ourselves in a
  spacious apartment, which, from the courteousness wherewith he bowed us into
  it, there could be no difficulty in perceiving to be the customary sphere of
  his own exertions. It was not altogether deserted even when we entered, but
  the removal of the curtain attracted more of the loungers of the baths, and
  ere Sextus was fairly fixed before the table of the painter, the modest youth
  had the mortification to find himself surrounded with a very crowd of knowing
  and curious physiognomies. The presence of these, however, appeared not
  unwelcome to the master. On the contrary, there arose between the little man,
  as he was preparing his brushes, and those who had come to survey him at his
  work, such a gabble of compliments, remarks, and disquisitions, that it
  seemed to me as if he would have been disappointed had he not been favoured
  with their attendance.</p>

  <p>"How noble," cries one, "is that portrait you have just been finishing of
  Rupilius! Heavens! with what felicity you have caught the air! Methinks I see
  him about to enter the Basilica, when he knows that some great cause is
  awaiting his decision. What solemnity in his aspect! what grandeur in the
  gown! How finely the purple of the laticlave is made to harmonize with the
  colouring of the cheeks and chin! What beautiful handling about the fingers
  with which he grasps his tablets! As for the head of the stylus, it is the
  very eye of the picture."&mdash;"Exquisite indeed," quoth another; "but who
  can look at it, or at any thing else, in the same room with this little
  jewel? Heavens! what a beauty! who can it be? for I never saw her either at
  the Circus or the Amphitheatre. What an inimitable modesty!"</p>

  <p>The painter heard this last piece of eulogy with an air of some
  embarrassment, and at the same time looked very cunningly towards the person
  who had uttered it. But the Lady Rubellia tossed her head, and whispered to
  me, "Pretty she may be, though I cannot say that style of dressing the hair
  is at all adapted for such features; but for modesty! hem. I asked Agaso two
  or three days ago who it was, and he told me guess!</p>

  <p>it is a little Spanish girl, whom that august-looking person, with the
  grand laticlave, and the purple cheeks and chin, and the glittering stylus,
  thought fit to bring home with him when he was relieved from the hard duties
  of the Pro-praetorship. I dare say, he takes care she shall not be seen
  either at Circus or Amphitheatre; and, indeed, I think it is sufficient
  impudence to show her likeness in the company of so many portraits of
  respectability."</p>

  <p>"My dear lady," quoth the painter, who overheard somewhat, "for the sake
  of all that is sacred, no word of this again! Wait, at least, till the
  canvass for the Augurship be over. There are always so many to exaggerate and
  misrepresent."&mdash;"Exaggerate, indeed! I think Rupilius ought to be
  ashamed of himself; and at his time of life too. I think you said he was just
  the same age with my uncle?"&mdash;"Yes," says the painter, "he must be of
  that standing; and I think he went to Spain just about the period of your
  marriage."</p>

  <p>"filthy old fellow," quoth she, very quickly; "and this is the treasure he
  has brought home with him! I have a great mind to tell his
  wife."&mdash;"Hush, hush," said Agaso, "this is the very day Rupilius spoke
  of bringing her to see his own portrait; and, indeed, I am sure that is the
  Senator's cough. I rely on your prudence."</p>

  <p>And the portly original of the laticlaved portrait walked into the room,
  having his gown and every part of his dress arranged as represented in the
  picture; although in the living countenance it was easy to discover a few
  lines and spots which had been omitted in the copy. By his side moved a short
  woman, arrayed in the extremity of costly attire, whose swarthy complexion
  did not, in spite of cosmeticism, harmonize very well with the bright golden
  ringlets of her Sicambrian peruque; while behind the pair came a thin damsel,
  whose lineaments exhibited a sort of faint shadow of the same visage, the
  rudiments of which had been so abundantly filled up in that of the rubicund
  magistrate. The ex-pro-praetor, after saluting Agaso, stood still with
  dignity in the midst of the apartment, while the fond daughter, rushing close
  up to his picture, could with difficulty affix any limits to her expressions
  of satisfaction: "0 Jupiter! look at the ring. It is the very ring he wears!
  the very images are engraved upon it; one can see the three Graces. I never
  saw such a picture when will it be brought home?"&mdash;"Hush, hush, now,
  Primula," quoth the mother. "It is certainly a likeness; but why will
  artists, now-a-days, always paint people older than they are? And besides, it
  wants something of his expression. Don't you think so yourself, sir?"
  (turning to the painter) " Rupilius has surely been looking very gloomily
  when he sat."</p>

  <p>On this the painter, leaving Sextus, advanced to her side, and after a
  pause of some moments, spent in contemplating alternately his own work and
  the original, said, with a courteous simper, "How much am I indebted to you,
  most noble lady, for this visit, and these judicious remarks! I only wish you
  had accompanied the senator, for then, without question, his countenance
  would have worn the look you desiderate; and I perhaps might have more easily
  succeeded in catching it, being aided by your suggestions. I hope it may yet
  be amended."&mdash;"How modest he is! " ejaculated the spouse. "A single
  sitting will suffice, I am sure. We shall come some day when you are quite
  alone, and I will sit by you, and talk to Rupilius all the while."&mdash;"
  Delightful!" replied the artist; "how happy shall I be in such an opportunity
  of improving both the picture and myself! We must positively prevail on the
  senator to give us this one sitting more."&mdash;"Never ask his consent,"
  quoth the matron, smiling upon her lord; "leave the whole matter to me. The
  picture is for me. And besides, if he were to refuse, I know how I should be
  certain to overcome him; for ho has asked me to sit to you myself, and you
  know if I were to persist in sitting with my gloomy face, as he has with his,
  we should soon bring him to his right reason."&mdash;"Your gloomy face, noble
  lady!" replied the artist, strutting back a pace or two. "I am afraid, if
  that is the charm by which alone he is to be softened, we must give up all
  our hopes."&mdash;"I protest," says the lady, "I believe you will keep me
  laughing all the time I sit. And pray now, what dress do you think I should
  wear? Prima says, I ought certainly to be in green; but I was thinking, that
  perhaps a yellow byssine would suit me better. But I shall send over half a
  dozen robes, and then we can choose whichever seems to be the best. One thing
  only I am quite resolved upon, and that is, that I shall have my golden
  chain, with the miniature of the Pro-praetor the Senator, I mean at the end
  of it."&mdash;"Nothing could be in finer taste," he made answer; "and if my
  lady should think of green, or purple, or any dark colour for the gown, the
  rings of the chain and the setting of the miniature would have the richest
  effect."&mdash;"And do, my dear mother," interrupted Prima; "and do have on
  the sapphire tiara when you sit to Agaso. Or what would you think of having
  your own hair simply like this lady here? What a beauty!"&mdash;"A smart
  little girl, indeed," quoth the mother. "I think I should know that face. Is
  she Roman, Agaso?"&mdash;"No, not a Roman," answered the artist; "nor do I
  think my lady can ever have met with her. But perhaps my Lord Rupilius may,
  for she is a Spaniard."</p>

  <p>Agaso turned with a smile to the Senator; but he, scarcely appearing to
  look at the picture, answered, with great gravity, "I think I have seen the
  countenance before; and perhaps it was in my province. The face is certainly
  a pretty one; but nothing so very extraordinary."&mdash;"They may say what
  they like," observed the spouse, drawing herself up; "but there is no such
  thing as a really urbane air to be got out of Rome."</p>

  <p>Meantime, in another part of the room, some other picture appeared to be
  exciting a scarcely inferior measure of curiosity. On approaching the party,
  I perceived that this was a sketch, in chalk only, of the head and shoulders
  of an old man; and when I had gained an opportunity of more nearly surveying
  it, I recognized without difficulty the features of Tisias of Antioch. The
  greater number of those who were looking on it, seemed also to have been
  present at his death; for I heard pointed out by them with exactness the
  parts in which the resemblance had been most successfully taken. The beauty
  of the old man's lineaments, and the serenity of his aspect, they all
  admired; and while they were loud in praising these, Agaso himself also
  joined them, saying, "Oh, so you have found out my old Christian! How did you
  get hold of him? for I meant it not to be seen till I had lain on a little of
  the colour. But is it not a fine study? is it not a noble head? I think I
  shall introduce it in the picture I am painting for Pliny. The subject is the
  sacrifice of Iphigenia. I went to the Amphitheatre," he continued, "rather
  late, without expecting any thing particular; but it immediately struck me
  that he might be turned to some account. I made several little sketches of
  him, for it was a long time ere it was over; and this is from the one I took
  just after he had made his oration. His hands and feet were singularly fine,
  I thought. Here," said he, turning over the leaves of his tablets " here you
  have him in a variety of shapes! the muscles showed powerfully when he knelt;
  there, again, you have his fingers as they were folded on his breast not much
  flesh, but the lines good veins well expressed."</p>

  <p>But about this time the great bell rung in the tower above the Baths, and
  the greater part of the young loungers soon dispersed themselves; some to
  fence or wrestle others to play in the tennis-court others to ride in the
  Hippodrome, in preparation for the bath. So Agaso, being left alone with
  Sextus, Rubellia, and myself, had at length leisure to proceed with his
  portrait of the youth.</p>

  <p>Much did the lady and the painter discourse, and many merry things were
  said by them both; but all they said could not entirely remove the
  embarrassment fixed on the countenance of Sextus; nor, of a truth, did he
  present himself with much advantage before the artist. Rubellia,
  nevertheless, sat over against him with looks of no severe criticism; and I
  doubt not she would have remained to the end of the sitting, had not one of
  her household come with a message, which, as it seemed, rendered necessary
  her departure. It struck me, that the messenger answered very well to Dromo's
  description of the fat Calabrian with whom he and Boto had been drinking; but
  of this I said nothing to Sextus.</p>

  <p>It was near the hour of supper before we were dismissed, and we found
  Licinius already about to enter his eating chamber.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch205"
     name="ch205">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE orator received us with less coldness than I could have
  expected. I suppose' his knowledge that our morning had been spent in
  Rubellia's company, had in some measure softened his feelings of jealousy
  towards his son; and perhaps he had given me credit for advice, to the merit
  of which I had no claim. But he remained not long at table after supper was
  concluded, being summoned to discourse in private with a client: so that
  Sextus and I were left to spend the evening as it might please ourselves; for
  as to Xerophrastes, he had not as yet made his appearance, and we took it for
  granted he had remained at the mansion of Fabricius, for the purpose of
  consoling with philosophical controversies his bereaved brother of Ionia.</p>

  <p>We retired, therefore, into the apartment of my young friend; but he could
  not read a page without coming upon some verse which made him throw down the
  scroll to ruminate on the charms of his Sempronia. When he took up his lute,
  his fingers seemed to evoke only the most melancholy sounds. It was only in
  the exercise of the foil, that he succeeded in banishing from his thoughts
  the troubles of his situation; but both of us having contended till we were
  breathless, were soon compelled to sit down, and then the unhappy boy's
  exhausted body seemed to communicate a new debility to his mind. We sat for
  the most part in silence, (for I soon found that I could not say any thing
  capable of interesting him,) until the shades of evening had quite darkened
  the chamber, and then we walked together, not less silently, in the adjoining
  open gallery, until the moon had arisen from above the tall poplars around
  the Pantheon and Baths of Agrippa, and diffused her radiance over all the
  beautiful gardens and noble edifices that lay beneath us down to the brink of
  the river. Lassitude of spirit then, if not expectation of sleep, rendered
  Sextus desirous of retiring to his couch; so, having exhorted the youth to
  wrestle with his grief, and to call hope to his aid, I at length left him to
  himself. But as for me, I had as yet no feeling of weariness, and, besides, I
  remembered the promise I had made to Dromo in the morning.</p>

  <p>I was very much surprised, indeed, that the Cretan had not as yet come to
  me, and made inquiry concerning him of Boto; but hearing that the man was
  absent from the house, I thought from this there was the more likelihood of
  his being engaged in some scheme, the result of which I should by and by
  learn from his own lips. I dismissed my Briton, therefore, and prepared to
  read by my watch-light, and while I was considering what I should read, I
  remembered the scroll I had received from Tisias, which forthwith I took from
  the place in which I had locked it up on the morning of the preceding day.
  There fell from out of it, as I unfolded it, a letter sealed, but without any
  superscription. This I of course considered as meant only for the eye of
  Athanasia; so I kissed the parchment her fingers were destined to touch, and,
  before I began to read, restored it to its receptacle.</p>

  <p>More than one of you, my young friends, have already heard me speak, on
  another occasion, of the impression which that night's reading made upon my
  mind, and been told, from my own lips, what book it was that was contained in
  the scroll of Tisias; the rest of you will judge for yourselves with what
  astonishment it was that I, who had at the best expected to unfold some
  obscure treatise of Asiatic lore, some semi-barbarous exposition of mystical
  riddles, found myself engaged in the perusal of a plain and perspicuous
  narrative of facts, written evidently by a man of accomplishment and
  learning, and in Greek of which the most elegant penman of these times could
  have had no occasion to be ashamed. In a word, it was the Gospel of the holy
  physician St Luke which had been put into my hands; and at this day I am
  still grateful that this was the first of the Christian books which I had an
  opportunity of seeing; for such had been my education, that I am afraid
  others, not less worthy of the true faith, might have repelled me by the
  peculiarities of their composition, as well as by the acquaintance with many
  things, to me then entirely unknown, which they take for granted in the style
  of their commencement. Here, however, there was enough only of mystery, the
  more effectually to stimulate my curiosity, while the eagerness with which I
  engaged myself in its gratification, was abundantly repaid from the
  beginning, both by the beauty of the simple narrative itself, and the
  sublimity of the conceptions embodied and evolved in its course.</p>

  <p>Considering the book which I was reading, as one merely of human origin
  and invention, I could not help regarding it with such admiration, that it
  appeared to me above all things wonderful, I had never seen it mentioned by
  any of the writers of the age, or heard it spoken of by any of those who, in
  my presence, since I came to Rome, had talked concerning the faith and
  doctrines of the persecuted Christians. But this was not all. At least, said
  I to myself, there is something here which deserves to be inquired into and
  examined. Of things such as these, if told falsely, it must needs have been
  nay, it must still be, easy to prove the falsehood. It is impossible that, in
  the days of Tiberius, any such events should have occurred in Palestine,
  without being more or less submitted to the inspection of Roman eyes. This is
  no wild tale, handed down from the dark ages of a barbarous race. Here I have
  a Roman Centurion described as among the witnesses of this man's miraculous
  power, and acknowledging the divinity of his benevolence. Here, at least,
  must have been one spectator without prejudices, otherwise than against this
  Prophet of Nazareth. Of a surety, the legends of Rome herself contain many
  tales which demand a much greater measure of indulgence; since the wonders
  they narrate appear to have been oftentimes attended with no beneficial
  consequences, either to individuals or to the state; whereas here the
  occasion seems always to have been such as might justify the interference of
  supernatural might. The power of this person seems to have been exerted only
  for good; and his precepts are full of such godlike loftiness as neither
  Socrates, nor Plato, nor any of those Greek sages, who bowed in reverence to
  the hoary wisdom of Egypt and India, would have disdained to admire.</p>

  <p>The doubts, suspicions, and distrusts, with which such thoughts were
  mingled, the under-current of reluctance with which I felt myself all along
  contending, were such as you may more easily imagine than I can describe.</p>

  <p>As the narrative went on, however, you will have no difficulty in
  supposing that my attention became more and more rivetted, and that, occupied
  with the strange events and sublime scenes it unfolds and agitated by turns
  with the pity, the wonder, the terror, and the admiration that matchless
  story must ever awaken, I had forgotten every thing beyond the page of the
  volume on which my finger was fixed.</p>

  <p>It was only the rustling of Dromo's cloak against the edge of my chair,
  that made me aware my privacy was disturbed. His hands seemed to be busied in
  tightening his girdle even before he was able to speak, and the first words
  he uttered, were "Come, sir this is no time for study. I have acquaintance
  with some of the soldiers at the Capena Gate, and they will let us pass
  through; but they are relieved at the next watch, and then we shall have no
  chance."&mdash;" And why," said I, hastily thrusting the scroll into my bosom
  " why, Dromo, or for what purpose should we desire to pass through the Capena
  Gate at the dead hour of night?" u Come," said he; "there is no time for
  explanation. It is simply because it is the dead hour of night that we must
  pass through the gate; for it would do nobody any good to pass through at any
  other time. Come or abandon Sextus to his fate."</p>

  <p>Thus adjured, I could not oppose any obstacle to his zeal. The chained
  porter was lying asleep across the threshold; but Dromo had already found
  means to have the door opened, so he leaped lightly over the man, and I
  imitated his agility. The Cretan then locked the gate on the outside, by
  means of a key which he carried in his bosom; and I followed his rapid steps
  without farther question.</p>

  <p>This cunning varlet, (who seemed, indeed, to move as if he had a natural
  aversion to every open place,) threaded one obscure lane after another,
  keeping always, where the moonlight had any access, to the dark side of the
  way; a person better skilled than myself might well have been somewhat
  puzzled; as for me, I had not the least conception whither I was going.
  Close, however, did I adhere to him; and we reached the Capena Port, which is
  on the south side of the city, not many bow-shots from the Anio, before I
  could have imagined it possible to traverse so great a space.</p>

  <p>Here Dromo told me to wait for him a single moment, and stepped down into
  a cellar, in which a light was burning; but he staid not long, and when he
  returned to me, I observed that his style of walking was more clumsy than
  usual, which, indeed, was not to be wondered at, considering that he had now
  to carry, not only himself, but two huge skins of wine, intended, as I at
  once suspected, for the .purpose of facilitating our passage. I told him my
  suspicion in a whisper; but he made no answer, except by handing to me one of
  his burdens. So laden, we crept on as well as we could to the portal, beneath
  the shadow of which two Praetorians were pacing, their armour ringing audibly
  upon them amidst the silence of the night. Silently did the well-oiled hinges
  turn, and very silently stooping did we step beneath the lintel of the Capena
  Gate, which as silently was again made fast.</p>

  <p>As we advanced among the funereal monuments which line the Appian Way on
  either side, Dromo stood still every now and then for a moment, as if to
  listen; but whatever he might have heard, or expected to hear, I perceived
  nothing, except here and there the howl of a dog, or the lazy hooting of the
  night-owl, from the top of some of the old cypresses that rose between us and
  the moon.</p>

  <p>At last he seemed to catch the sound he had been expecting, for he started
  suddenly; and laying his finger on his lip, crept to the parapet.</p>

  <p>The ground behind was more desolate of aspect than any part of that which
  we had traversed stony and hard, with here and there tufts of withered fern;
  and immediately below the wall two human figures were visible. The one was
  sitting on the ground, wrapped in a dark cloak which entirely concealed the
  countenance: the other was a half-naked boy, holding in a string a little
  new- shorn lamb, which with one of his hands he continually caressed. But
  forthwith the sitter arose, and throwing away the cloak, displayed the gray
  tangled tresses of an old woman, and two strong bony arms, one of which was
  stretched forth with an impatient gesture towards the stripling, while the
  other was pointed upwards to the visible moon. "Strike," said she, "strike
  deeply beware lest the blood tinge your feet or your hands;" and I recognized
  at once the voice of the same Pona that had attracted my notice in the
  morning, at the foot of the Palatine.</p>

  <p>The boy drew forth instantly a knife from his bosom, whose glittering
  blade was buried in the throat of the yearling, and it was then first that I
  perceived a small ditch dug between the boy and the woman, into which, the
  lamb's throat being held over it, the blood was made to drop from the wound.
  So surely had the blow been given, that not one bleat escaped from the
  animal, and so deeply, that the blood flowed in a strong stream, dashing
  audibly upon the bottom of the trench. And while it was dropping, the old
  woman muttering a sort of chant to Hecate, as I gathered, showered from her
  girdle I know not what of bones or sticks, mingled with leaves and roots,
  which afterwards she seemed to be stirring about in the blood with one of the
  tall strong stems of the fern that grew there. The wildness of her gestures
  was such, that I could not doubt she had herself some faith in the efficacy
  of the foul charms to which she had resorted; nor could I see her stirring
  that trench of innocent blood, without remembering the still more ruthless
  charms, whose practice the poets of Italy have ascribed to such hoary
  enchantresses. The dreariness of the midnight wind, too, as it whistled along
  the bare and sterile soil around us, and the perpetual variations in the
  light, by reason of the careering of those innumerable clouds, and the
  remembrance of the funereal purposes for which, as it seemed, all this region
  was set apart the whole of this together produced, I know not how, a certain
  pressure upon my spirits, and I confess to you, I felt, kneeling there by the
  side of my now trembling Cretan, as if I owed him no great thanks for having
  brought me that night beyond the Capena Gate.</p>

  <p>It seemed as if the goddess, to whom the witch's song had been addressed,
  did not listen to it with favourable ear; for the clouds gathered themselves
  more thickly than ever, while the wind howled only more loudly among the
  tombs, and the half-scared owl sent up a feebler hooting. Notwithstanding,
  the old woman continued fixed in the same attitude of expectation, and the
  stripling still held the well-nigh drained throat of his lamb above the
  trench. By degrees, however, the patience of both seemed to be exhausted; and
  there arose between them an angry altercation. "Infernal brat of Hades!"
  quoth the witch, "look ye, if you have not stained your filthy hands, and if
  the thirsty shadows be not incensed, because you have deprived them of some
  of the sweet blood which they love!"&mdash;"Curse not me, mother," replied
  the boy " Did you think, in truth, that the blood of a stolen lamb would ever
  propitiate Hecate?"&mdash;"Imp!" quoth she, "Hold thy peace, or I will try
  whether no other blood may make the charm work better!"&mdash;"Beware!" quoth
  the boy, leaping backwards " beware what you do! I am no longer so weak that
  I must bear all your blows."</p>

  <p>"Stop," cried I, "for there are eyes that you think not of, to take note
  of your wickedness;" and in my vehemence I shook one of the great loose
  stones that were on the top of the wall, which rolled down and bounded into
  the ditch beside them; and the woman, huddling her cloak over her head, began
  to run swiftly away from us, along the wall over which we were leaning. The
  boy only stood still for a moment, and looked upwards towards the place where
  we were, and then he also fled, but in the opposite direction; and Dromo said
  to me in a very piteous whisper, but not till both were out of sight, "Heaven
  and earth! was ever such madness as to scare the witch from her incantation?
  Alas! for you and for me, sir and, most of all, alas for Sextus for I fear me
  after this we shall have no luck in counteracting the designs of
  Rubellia."&mdash;"Rubellia! what? can you possibly imagine Rubellia to have
  any thing to do with this madness?"</p>

  <p>"Imagine?" quoth he; "do you need to be told, that if things had gone well
  with that woman and her ditch, we should never have been able to preserve
  Sextus from her Clutches?"</p>

  <p>"By the rod of Hermes, good Dromo!" said I, "this will never do. I shall
  believe much on your credit, but not things quite so extravagant as
  this."</p>

  <p>He made no reply save a long, incredulous, and, I think, contemptuous
  whistle, which seemed to reach the ears of every owl between us and the
  Appian; with such a hooting and screeching did they echo its note from every
  cypress. And when Dromo heard that doleful concert, his dread redoubled
  within him, for he shook from head to foot, while I held his arm in mine;
  until, at last, he seemed to make one violent effort, and springing on his
  feet, said "Come, Master Valerius, let us behave after all like men!" I
  smiled when he said so " The hour has not yet come, if my Calabrian friend is
  to be trusted, at which the lady was to visit Pona in her dwelling. It is but
  daring a little more. If she has seen and known us already, then nothing can
  endanger us farther; and if she hath not, we may escape again."&mdash;"Well
  spoken," said I, "most shrewd Dromo, and like yourself; but what is it that
  you would have us to do?"&mdash;"The first thing," he replied, "is what has
  already been too long delayed."</p>

  <p>The Cretan produced from under his cloak a long fictitious beard, which he
  immediately proceeded to fix upon his own face with a string. A thin tall cap
  of black cloth was next brought forth, which he fastened in like manner
  around his brows; and a little piece of chalk, with which he once or twice
  rubbed over his black bushy eye-brows, completed a disguise beneath which I
  should certainly have sought in vain to discover any trace of the natural
  countenance of Dromo. In short, after a few changes in the folding of his
  cloak, there stood before me a figure so venerably mysterious, that had I met
  it unawares at midnight, in the neighbourhood of so many tombs, I am not
  sure, although of no superstitious temper, that I could have regarded it
  without awe.</p>

  <p>"Come now, good Master," quoth he, "you are taller than I, pluck me a
  branch from the nearest tree, and I think you shall confess I make a decent
  Soothsayer." In this it was easy to gratify him; for there was an old willow
  just a few yards off, and its boughs were so dry with age, that I soon
  abstracted a very proper wand for him. After receiving which, he stood for a
  moment leaning on it in a dignified fashion, as if to rehearse an attitude
  worthy of his new vocation; and then said " Well, sir, I think if the Lady
  Rubellia comes now, we shall be tolerably prepared for her. But I have no
  disguise for you; therefore, the moment you hear a footstep, be sure you wrap
  your face in your gown, and stand behind me, for so shall you best consult
  both your own concealment, and the dignity of this Assyrian. There is no
  other way by which she can come from the Suburra, therefore we might stay
  very well where we are; but I think it might be still better to await her
  coming where there are either tombs or larger trees to cast a shade over our
  equipage, in case the moon should take it into her head to be more kind to us
  than she was to Pona."&mdash;"By all means," said I, "most venerable man and
  besides, the wind is rather chilly, therefore I shall be well pleased to have
  shelter as well as shade."</p>

  <p>"You shall have both," quoth he; "there is a thick grove of pines only a
  little way on. I believe there is a very grand tomb in the midst of them, in
  case you should prefer to sit under it. By the bye," he continued, after some
  little pause, "it is odd enough that it should be so; but I believe it is the
  very place where all that race of the Sempronii, to which a certain young
  damsel belongs, have been burnt and buried ever since Rome was a city. You
  cannot see their tomb yet; but that is only from the thickness of the trees,
  some of which are, I suppose, even older than itself. Now I remember me, it
  was just there that they set up two winters ago the funeral pile of old Caius
  I mean the father of the Lady Athanasia, whom you saw at Capito's villa. They
  are a very noble race, and although none of the richest now-a-days, there is
  not a prouder in Rome. I saw the procession at that old man's funeral myself,
  and I think the images of his ancestors that they carried before him, would
  have reached half way from hence to the Great Road. Grim, dusty figures, I
  trow they were; but I doubt not there had been many a haughty captain among
  them when they were alive."</p>

  <p>These words were spoken as we were moving onwards towards this same grove
  of pines, and before he had made an end of speaking, we could clearly hear
  the wind sighing among their branches, and along the dry underground. And on
  coming to them I found that he had said truly there was a tomb in the midst
  of them, for a very noble, high, circular tower was indeed there, which, from
  the grayness of its walls, and luxuriance of ivy, had the appearance of being
  at least as ancient as any of the surrounding trees. The only method of
  access to the inside, seemed to be by means of a winding stair, which rose on
  the exterior from the ground to the summit a method not unusual in Roman
  sepulchres and it was on one of the steps of this stair that I seated myself,
  where, between the shaded wall on the one side, and the pine branches on the
  other, I was effectually concealed. As for Dromo, I know not whether it was
  that he coveted not exactly such close proximity to the stones of such an
  edifice; but instead of ascending with me, he took up a position beside one
  of the largest pines over against me.</p>

  <p>Although the moon had got rid of her clouds, and the sky, where any of it
  could be seen, was abundantly brilliant, the natural darkness of that
  funereal grove was such, that very little difference could be produced in the
  midst of it by any variation on the face of any nightly luminary. The tower
  itself received some of the moonbeams on its carved surface; but its
  contemporary trees participated not in any such illumination, one solemn
  shade covering all things beneath the influence of their growth. "I can
  scarcely see you, Dromo," said I; "but I think that speck must be your beard,
  and if so, I beg you would tell me what it is you really have in view by all
  this preparation? Do you expect me to stay here on a tomb-stone all night,
  merely because you wish to have an opportunity of terrifying poor Rubellia by
  some ghost-like howl or other when she passes you? which, by the way, it
  seems by no means certain she will do at all. Or what is your purpose?"
  "Hush!" was his answer; "ask no questions, but hem thrice if you hear a
  footstep for young ears are the keenest." Accordingly silence was kept so
  strictly, that, in spite of the chillness of the stone on which I sat, I
  presently fell into a sort of dozing slumber.</p>

  <p>By degrees, however, nor, considering the hour and the fatigue I had
  undergone, is it wonderful that it should have been so, my sleep must have
  become sufficiently profound, for I did not at first, on waking from it, very
  well remember either where I was, or for what purpose I had come thither.
  And, indeed, I have little doubt my slumbers might have continued till
  day-break, but for the interruption I am now to mention.</p>

  <p>And yet it seemed as if even in my sleep I had been prepared for this by
  some strange anticipation, for although it was a near sound of singing voices
  that dispelled my slumbers, and made me start from the stone on which I had
  placed myself, I could not help feeling as if that sound were not altogether
  new to me; whether it were that the half-sensible ear had been already
  ministering indistinctly to the dreaming spirit, or that some purely
  fantastic prelude had been vouchsafed to the real music. I started up
  suddenly, that much is certain, and listened with astonishment, yet not
  altogether with such surprise as might have been expected to attend a
  transition so hasty from sleep to waking, and from silence to the near
  neighbourhood of sounds at once so strange and so sweet. With breathless
  curiosity, nevertheless, with awe, and not entirely I think without terror,
  did I listen to the notes which seemed to ascend out of the habitation of the
  noble dead into the nightly air wild, yet solemn, as if breathed from the
  bosom of a stately repose and a pensive felicity; insomuch, that almost I
  persuaded myself I was hearing the forbidden sounds of another world, and the
  thought came over me, yet almost I think at that moment without farther
  disturbing me, what fearful interpretations the old poets have affixed to
  such untimely communion, and how the superstition of all antiquity has shrunk
  from its omen.</p>

  <p>My first impulse, after a moment had elapsed, was to call on Dromo, and I
  did so, at first in a low whisper, and then two or three times more loudly
  but all equally in vain, for no answer was returned; and though I strained my
  eyes in gazing on the place where I had last seen him, yet there I could
  perceive no trace whatever of any human figure. The moonlight indeed showed
  with more distinctness than before the tall stem of the old pine-tree against
  which he had been leaning; but no motion, nor the least appearance of
  whiteness, could either my eyes or my imagination discover there. I might
  easily, you will say, have stept across the road, and entirely satisfied
  myself; but I know not well what it was that nailed me to the place where I
  stood, and prevented me even from once thinking of doing so. The calm
  sepulchral music, my friends, still continued to stream from the recess of
  the mausoleum, and painless awe held me there, as if by a charm
  incontrollable. I gazed upwards, and beheld the moon riding above the black
  pine tops, in a now serene and cloudless heaven. The wind also had passed
  away, as it appeared, with the clouds it had agitated. The bird of night was
  asleep on her unseen bough; and all was silent as death, except only the
  dwelling of the departed; and a certain indescribable delight was beginning,
  as I gazed and listened, to be mixed with the perturbation wherewith at first
  I had been inspired.</p>

  <p>And I know not how long I might have stood so, but while I was yet
  listening to this mysterious music, there was mingled with its expiring
  cadence the sound of a heavy footstep on the staircase above me, and looking
  up, I perceived in the moonlight the figure of a man, clad in a white gown,
  but having a naked sword stretched forth in his hand, immediately over the
  place whereon I was standing. I obeyed the first natural impulse, and leaped
  downwards swiftly on seeing him; but this availed me nothing, for he also
  leaped, and almost before my feet had touched the ground, I felt the grasp of
  his hand upon my shoulder, and that so strongly, that I perceived plainly
  there was as little possibility of escape as of resistance. I made therefore
  no farther effort, but suffered him to do with me as he pleased; and he, on
  his part, said not a single word, but still retaining his hold, pointed with
  his sword to the same steps from which I had descended, and compelled me to
  mount them before him, up to the very summit of the round tower.</p>

  <p>"Why is this, sir?" said I; "and whither do you conduct me?"</p>

  <p>"Peace," was all his answer; and, in like manner as he had made me climb
  the exterior, so also he compelled me to begin the descent of a similar
  flight of steps, which led down from an aperture above, into the interior of
  the edifice. And although I must confess to you that I obeyed not this silent
  guidance without considerable fear, yet I strove as well as I could to
  control myself. I moved with a step in which I think not there could be
  perceived any trembling.</p>

  <p>Yet you will admit that even had I been master at that moment of less
  firmness, I might have been excusable; for looking down, I perceived that a
  lamp was burning in the midst of the sepulchral tower far below me, and saw
  sitting around it a company of eight or ten persons, at whose mercy, it was
  quite visible, I must be placed. Neither, if I might judge from the demeanour
  of the person that was bringing me into their assembly, did there appear to
  be any great room for dependence on them; for, as to themselves, not one of
  them looked up towards me as I was stepping down, and being wrapped in their
  cloaks, I had no means of discovering what manner of persons they were. The
  way in which I had been treated, however, by one of their number, was a
  sufficient evidence, either that they conceived themselves to have been
  injured by my being there, or that they were capable of taking some undue
  advantage of my helpless condition. The calmness of their attitudes, and the
  recollection of the sounds that I had heard, inclined me to the former of
  these suppositions; and when I perceived that not one of them stirred, even
  till I had reached the lowmost step of the interior staircase, in this,
  without question, I already felt myself considerably strengthened.</p>

  <p>"Behold," said my guide, as I at length touched the marble floor of the
  mausoleum itself "Behold proof, and that living, that my suspicions were not
  quite so groundless as you were pleased to imagine. Here is a man whom I
  found listening, even on the very steps of this tower. It is for you to
  decide what shall be done with the eaves-dropper."</p>

  <p>With this the whole company sprung at once to their feet, and I perceived
  evidently, from the surprise expressed in their looks and attitudes, that
  until that moment not one of them had been aware of my approach. I was about
  to speak, and declare my innocence of any treachery, or even of any knowledge
  concerning the purpose of their meeting; but before I could do so, one of
  them, and I think the oldest of all that were present, having in an instant
  recovered the tranquillity which my arrival had disturbed, said to me in a
  voice of the utmost gentleness, "Young man, what has brought thee hither, or
  who sent thee? Art thou indeed a spy, and was it thy purpose to betray our
  assembly?"</p>

  <p>"Sir," said I, "I know nothing of your assembly, or of its purpose; I fell
  asleep by accident on the outside of this tower, and, when I awoke, the music
  that I heard detained me."</p>

  <p>"Examine the stripling," quoth he that had conducted me " examine his
  person."&mdash;"His looks belie him," replied the senior, "if you have cause
  for suspicion. But if you will it so, search the young man." And with that my
  guide, laying his unsheathed sword upon a table, or altar of black marble,
  proceeded to search my garments, and finding in my bosom the scroll which I
  had received from Tisias, he glanced on it for a moment, and then handing it
  to the senior, said, "Now, sirs, doubt ye if ye will."&mdash;"Before heaven
  it is the book of the holy Luke!" said the other; "this is indeed suspicious.
  How came this scroll into thy hands, young man? Art thou aware that one of
  the books of the Christians has been found in thy bosom?"&mdash;"I know it,"
  said I; "it is one of the books of their faith, and I have read in it this
  evening for the first time."&mdash;"Then thou art not thyself a
  Christian?"&mdash;"I received the book from one Christian," said I, waiving
  the question; "and I made promise to deliver it into the hands of
  another?"&mdash;"Name the Christian who gave thee this book!" said my stern
  guide. "Tisias of Antioch," I replied; "the same who died yesterday in the
  Amphitheatre."&mdash;"Yes," quoth he, again; "and I suppose it was there he
  gave it to you. Every one knows the name of Tisias. Name, if you please, the
  person to whom you are to deliver the book."&mdash;"You shall pardon me,"
  said I, "that I will not. You may call me an eaves-dropper, if you will; but
  you shall find I am no traitor. It is a Roman a noble Roman lady to whom I
  must give this book; and I would not tell you her name although you should
  slaughter me here in this tomb, which I have entered living and without
  guilt." And having said this, I folded my arms, and stood still, abiding
  their will.</p>

  <p>But scarcely had I finished these words, ere I felt a small trembling hand
  laid upon my shoulder, and looking round, I perceived Athanasia herself, who
  whispered into my ear, "Valerius, was the book for me? If so, you may say it
  boldly, and I will vouch for your word."&mdash;"For you, lady," I answered in
  the same tone, "and for none other. You well know that I was present in his
  prison the night before his death; so far at least you can confirm what I
  have said."</p>

  <p>"Sir," said she, addressing the old man that had before questioned me, "1
  know this young man: and I believe what he has said, and will be answerable
  for his fidelity. It was he that went in to our friend the other night in his
  prison, and the book was intrusted to him by the old man, that it might be
  given into my hands. His name is Valerius Caius Valerius and he is by birth a
  noble Roman."</p>

  <p>"Say you so, lady?" interrupted my original conductor; "then I ask his
  pardon. I have wronged Caius Valerius; but both you and he must forgive me,
  for it must be confessed he was found in a very extraordinary situation."</p>

  <p>"Even so," I replied, "I have nothing to complain of. I perceive that I am
  present in an assembly of Christians; but he shall do me much wrong that
  thinks I bear any enmity to them, or, from all that I have yet seen or read,
  to the faith which they profess. I have read part of that book," I continued,
  "for I made promise to Tisias that I should 'do so before giving it to
  Athanasia; and I trust I shall still be permitted by her to read more of it
  before it is finally demanded from me."&mdash;"Oh, read it!" said Athanasia,
  gently again whispering to me. "Oh yes, read the book, Valerius, and may God
  enlighten the reader." And so saying, she herself took up the scroll from the
  table on which it was lying, and gave it again into my hands. "There was also
  a letter for you," said I, receiving it, "but that I left at home."" No
  matter," said Athanasia, "you shall give me the letter and the book both
  together hereafter."</p>

  <p>"In the meantime," said I, "I suppose it were better I should retire."</p>

  <p>"Young sir," said the senior, "that is as you please; in a little while we
  shall all be moving towards the city. Stay with us till then, if such be your
  will; that which you may hear, can at least do you no harm. Already, I doubt
  not, you have seen enough to despise the ignorant calumnies of our enemies."
  .</p>

  <p>When he had said so, the old man walked to the side of the sepulchre, and
  took out from behind one of the urns that stood there, (ranged in their
  niches,) a small casquet, which, returning, he placed before him on the
  marble table. Then, opening the casquet, he brought forth a silver goblet,
  and a salver containing some little pieces of bread; and, untying from his
  neck a massive cross of gold, he set that also on the table, between the cup
  and the salver. In brief, the Christian priest, (for such, as you already
  see, he was,) had finished his preparation, and was about to commence the
  administration of the blessed Eucharist. And when all the rest were kneeling
  before the table, Athanasia, laying her hand upon my arm, beckoned to me to
  kneel by her side; and so indeed I would have done in my ignorance, had not
  the priest himself pointed to a station a few yards behind the lady, to
  which, accordingly, I drew back apart from those who were to be privileged
  with the participation of those holy symbols.</p>

  <p>Scarcely had they composed themselves in their places, and listened to the
  first words of the appointed service, when I, standing there by myself,
  thought, unless my ears deceived me, there must be some one on the outer
  stair- case of the tower; and my eyes instinctively, I suppose, were fixed
  upon the aperture, which, as I have told you, was in the high roof above the
  circle of the niched walls. Here, however, when I first looked, there was
  nothing to be seen, but the round spot of the sky, far up in the midst of the
  marble roof; but while I was looking steadfastly, that space was suddenly
  diminished; and a dog bayed, and at the same moment a voice which I well
  knew, screamed, "I have them I hold them let them burst the net if they
  can."</p>

  <p>The cry of Pona disturbed effectually the Christian priest, and the whole
  of those that were with him. Rising up hastily from their knees, they stood
  all together around the table, while the old man, having kissed both the cup
  and the cross, restored them as quickly as he could to the casket from which
  they had been taken. But while the priest was doing this, he that found me on
  the stair appearing to revert into his suspicion, and looking sternly upon me
  where T stood, said, "Is this then the innocence which we spared! Is this the
  noble Roman for whom Athanasia pledged herself? Speak, brethren, what shall
  be done to this traitor, by whom, even more than by those dogs of the tombs,
  it is a shame for us that we have been hunted?" Saying so, the man lifted up
  his sword again, and it seemed as if he would have smitten me to the ground
  without farther question. But Athanasia threw herself swiftly between him and
  me. "For shame, Cotilius," said she; "such suspiciousness is unworthy of a
  Roman knight."&mdash;"You say well, noble damsel," quoth the old priest,
  interrupting her; "but you might say also that such cruelty is unworthy of a
  soldier of Christ. Peace, peace, children; there is no evil in the youth,
  nor, if there were, would it be our part to avenge it."</p>

  <p>While he was saying this, three or four blazing torches were thrust down
  into the place from above, and Athanasia, laying her hand upon my arm, said,
  "Look up, Caius, I see helmets. Alas! am I not already here? why, if they
  will slay me, should they drag me away now from the tomb of my fathers?" I
  felt the trembling of her hands, and she leaned upon my shoulder. I know not,
  I will confess to you, whether at that moment I tasted more of pleasure or of
  pain.</p>

  <p>But by this time several of the soldiers had already begun to descend into
  the tower, and before another minute had elapsed, we found ourselves
  surrounded by the flame of their torches. And he that seemed to lead the
  party, after counting us one by one, said, turning to his companions, "Well,
  an old woman has told the truth for once here are even more I think than she
  warned us of. Come along, worthy people, you must not keep the Tribune
  waiting for you all night, and our watch is well-nigh expired already. Come,
  mount the stair it will take a good half hour yet, I believe, to lodge you
  all safely in the Tullian&mdash;And do you," he added, laying his hand on the
  hilt of Cotilius' sword "do you, brave sir, allow me to save you the trouble
  of carrying this bauble." Nor was the stern knight so foolish as to dispute
  the command; but having yielded up his sword, he forthwith began to ascend,
  one or two spearmen preceding him with their torches. The priest followed,
  and so did the rest; the last being Athanasia and myself.</p>

  <p>On every side around the old tower, when I looked from the summit of it, I
  perceived foot soldiers drawn up in a double line, while the road along which
  I had come with Dromo, was occupied by a band of horsemen, one of whom moved
  forward when he saw us descending, as if to take cognizance of the number and
  quality of the surprised assembly. His long cloak being muffled about his
  ears as he sat, and the shadow of his helmet falling deeply, I did not at
  first suspect who it was; but he had not counted half the party to the
  superior Officer behind him, ere I recognized him from the sound of his
  voice; and who, think ye, should it be but my good friend Sabinus?</p>

  <p>The Centurion, when his eye detected me, checked his horse so sharply that
  the animal bounded into the air; and, "Valerius!" quoth he, "ha! by the life
  of Caesar, what is the meaning of this? Valerius in a Christian synagogue! By
  all the gods, there must be some mistake." But before I, in my confusion,
  could make any answer to these exclamations, his eye chanced to glance on
  Athanasia, who, trembling, still retained the support of my arm; whereupon,
  "Ha! ha!" said he, in a quite different tone of voice, "there is a lady in
  the case." And then, stooping in his seat, ho whispered, half laughing, into
  my ear, "My most hypocritical smooth-face, you shall see what is the
  consequence of bringing these transatlantic pranks of yours to Rome. By
  Hercules, you wild dog, it may cost you some little trouble to get out of
  this scrape."</p>

  <p>Having said so, he turned his horse, and rejoining the troop, appeared to
  enter into close conversation with him who sat at the head of the line. Of
  what my friend said, I could catch nothing more than certain vehement oaths,
  while, all the time, the Tribune (for such he was) continued to shake his
  head, in a way significant at once of doubt and determination. The end was,
  that he pointed with his sword; and Sabinus forced his horse backwards, at
  one plunge, into the place from which he had advanced.</p>

  <p>Our party were immediately separated one from another. I saw the priest
  lifted on a mule and hurried away towards the city, with a horseman on each
  hand of him. The fiery Cotilius, and one or two more, were compelled to
  follow, with similar attendance, in the same direction; others, again, had
  their horses' heads turned more to the westward but all departed at speed,
  and were soon lost to my view among the projections of the tombs. The last
  that remained to be disposed of were Athanasia and myself, and for a moment I
  had some hope that we might perhaps be intrusted to the same guards; but this
  hope was in vain, and after I perceived that it was so, scarcely even was
  time permitted to me for bidding her farewell. To kiss her hand, and to
  whisper a single word of parting hope into her ear, was all I could do. A
  tear rolled from her cheek and fell upon my hand; yet she smiled faintly upon
  me, and " Hope," said she " yes, dear Valerius, Hope and Faith both go with
  me." And with that the pale maiden was separated from the arm to which she
  had trusted, and I saw her also mounted and borne away rapidly. A moment
  after, I found myself, in like manner, seized and lifted upon a horse, and
  almost before I could look around me, we had escaped from the flare of the
  torches, and the crowd of the soldiery, and were stretching at a rapid pace,
  I knew not whither, although I suspected, from the width of the road, that we
  had regained the Appian.</p>

  <p>But I have forgotten to mention to you, that just at the moment when they
  were lifting Athanasia upon the mule that was to bear her from my sight, my
  eye caught a glimpse of the witch Pona, who was sitting at the root of one of
  the pine-trees, close to the tower. And behind her stood, leaning against the
  tree, a figure wrapped in a rich red cloak, which I suspected to be a female
  also, but could not be certain, because the countenance was concealed in the
  folds of the garment. To this person, whoever it might be, the witch turned
  round eagerly, while the soldiers were carrying off Athanasia. I saw no more,
  for, as I have told you, immediately afterwards I also was carried away.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch206"
     name="ch206">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">OUR hasty pace had not borne us to any great distance from
  the place where all these things occurred, ere the sky, which, as ye have
  heard, had all that night been sufficiently variable, began to exhibit
  appearances which my two companions interpreted as significant of the
  approach of one of those nocturnal storms, to which, at that season of the
  year, the fair heaven of Italy is peculiarly subject. That they apprehended
  somewhat of this sort, I perceived from their looks, as they stopped for a
  moment to draw the hoods of their mantles over their brazen helmets; for
  words they uttered none, either to me or to each other, until our journey
  drew near its close. For me, however, the numberless agitations through which
  I had passed in the course of the few preceding hours, had, I suppose,
  communicated an unnatural measure of ardour to my boyish blood; for neither
  did I feel the night-breeze chill me as we rushed through it, nor partook, in
  any sort, of the desire my companions testified to cover themselves from the
  rain, which seemed to be about to discharge itself out of all those black and
  lowering clouds now gathered above our heads from every region of the
  heavens. When, on the contrary, the first heavy drops fell, I bared my
  forehead with the eagerness of one who, in a parched region, comes suddenly
  upon the margin of a well-spring. Nor did this sensation subside even after
  the storm had thickened to the utmost, and the dusty roads had drunk
  abundantly of the plashing rain. The strong wind blew with redoubled coolness
  upon my moistened neck the rain-drops dashed on my hot hands; and I
  perceived, that, as is the nature of those animals, the thunder which was
  mustering in the air, filled my horse one moment with dread, and the next
  with a blind fierceness. At last the thunder shouted overhead, and its echoes
  spread wide and far on either side, until they seemed to be absorbed to the
  left in the remote depths of the Appenine, and on the right hand in the
  measureless bosom of the Western Sea of which, as we galloped along the hill
  side, the broad lightning (unless my fancy deceived me) revealed ever and
  anon a distant and melancholy glimpse.</p>

  <p>We had passed a hill covered with towns, villages, and stately mansions,
  (which I afterwards learned was no other than the famous Alban,) ere the
  storm subsided beneath the influence of the reddening dawn. Yet even then we
  slackened not our pace, although the horses were by this time not a little
  exhausted with the swiftness of their motion, and the weight of their wet
  riders. On rode we in the growing light of the morning; but I perceived ere
  long that we had left the wide and magnificent Appian Way, and were pursuing
  the line of a narrower road, which seemed to carry us more and more
  westward.</p>

  <p>We halted for a moment on the brow of a declivity, where three paths
  separated; and I perceived that among my guides there was some little
  uncertainty as to which of these it behoved them to follow. While they were
  muttering together, I looked and beheld at length the wide sea heaving far
  below, over what appeared to me to be a forest as mighty as I had ever seen
  in my native island.</p>

  <p>Old hoary oaks leaned on either hand quite over the narrow path-way, into
  which (after their brief pause of consultation) my conductors directed our
  course. Here and there, such a shield had those huge leafy boughs extended
  over the road, that the dust rose from amongst the feet of our horses as if
  all that night not one drop of rain had fallen there; although elsewhere, in
  the absence of such mighty trees, the water lying across the path in pools
  testified abundantly that the tempest had not spared the forest any more than
  the champaign. Vast waving gulfs of bay and ilex, with here and there some
  solitary pine raising itself proudly in the midst, seemed to stretch away on
  either hand between the groves of those gigantic oaks.</p>

  <p>The path we followed carried us ever deeper and deeper into the bosom of
  the woods; and, at length, so buried were we in the windings of their
  stifling shade, that I had lost all notion of the direction in which I was
  moving; until, after two or three hot hours, weary man and jaded horse were,
  I believe, equally delighted with snuffing once more the open current of the
  air. We reached not the edge of the forest, however, before I could hear
  distinctly the dashing of the Mediterranean waves; and the last ascent we
  climbed laid open to my view a long sweep of the rolling waters, and their
  rocky coast garnished every where with the richness of superincumbent woods.
  Far, very far, in the distant north, I thought I could recognize some of the
  stately towers of Ostium, bosomed apparently within the billows over which
  they presided. All between was one wide waste of wood and rock, save here and
  there a watch-tower perched on the margin, and whitened half-way up with the
  foam of the yet uncalmed sea.</p>

  <p>Then, nor ever could I look upon the waters of the great deep, without
  something of that filial yearning which seems so natural to every native of
  our sea-girt island. But neither could I contrast the condition in which I
  now approached it, with the gay and hopeful mood in which I had so lately
  left it behind me, without many thoughts more sad and serious than as yet had
  frequently visited my bosom. What a strange brood of visions had passed
  before my eyes, since, but a few days before, I stept for the first time,
  light of heart, beneath the shadow of those far-off bulwarks! What new
  emotions had arisen, in the interval! How had every sense been gratified! how
  had every dream of imagination been exceeded! Yet what a void had been
  revealed within! Alas! said I to myself, why is it that I have been subjected
  to all these novelties? Had I not done better to have remained, after all,
  where life flowed ever calmly where affection hung over me like a protecting
  buckler, and my soul could sleep in the security of unbroken faith! But this
  was only for a moment. The thoughts of Athanasia haunted me more deeply and
  more firmly. I thought over every word she had spoken every look of hers rose
  up in succession, with all the vividness of a beautiful and a troubled dream.
  I seemed to feel, as if she were yet present beside me, the trembling of her
  pale fingers upon my shoulder I kissed the hand on which her parting tear had
  fallen, as if it were yet wet with the dear moisture. When I thought of the
  perils in which she must now be enveloped of the pains she must have suffered
  must at that moment be suffering, it was as if I could have burst bands of
  iron, like flax, from off my hands. When a glimpse of the darker future
  opened before me, I shuddered, and, urging my poor horse onwards in the
  recklessness of total abstraction, I perceived that even my guides pitied the
  agony of my despair.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch207"
     name="ch207">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WE stopped before one of the watch-towers which, as I have
  told you, I had seen scattered along the edge of the sea. But this, when we
  came up to it, appeared larger than I had expected to find any of them. The
  narrow way, alongst which we had been riding, brought us close to its gate,
  on the side towards the land; but the rock shelving rapidly on the other
  side, gave it the semblance, at a little distance, of being suspended over
  the waves.</p>

  <p>It was a building of rude, and apparently very antique structure, the
  under part square, but the upper circular; as is, for the most part, the old
  Roman fashion in such erections. And this, indeed, I doubt not, might have
  stood there long enough to have shown a beacon, when some fleet of Syracuse
  or Carthage darkened the blue sea over against the Lestrigonian bay renowned
  in old song, or the snow-white promontory of Gaieta.</p>

  <p>One of the soldiers dismounted, and began to knock rather violently at the
  door; but some little time elapsed ere any sound from within responded to the
  clamour he raised. At last a hard and withered face made its appearance at a
  little opening above the door, and then the helmets passed, I suppose, for a
  sufficient warrant, for in a twinkling we heard the bolts creaking; the old
  postern was soon set ajar, and forth stepped the venerable keeper. Imagine a
  tall, skinny man of threescore years, with a face as dry and yellow as ye
  have seen on the outside of a pye, and hair as white as ever the skill of a
  confectioner could represent, and legs bearing the same proportion to the
  feet, which the shaft of Saturn's scythe usually does to its blade. Clothe
  the nether part of this figure in Dacian, or Gaulish breeches, throw a
  somewhat threadbare cloak over his shoulders, and to finish the outfit, deck
  his head with a casque of the Macedonian cut, that is to say, sitting close
  above the ears, and topped with a bristling plume of horse hair. The Warder
  stood with dignity, and listened with gravity, while one of my Praetorians
  whispered his message. On its conclusion, he shrugged his shoulders, and
  regarding me with a glance made up, I think, in pretty equal proportions, of
  surprise and contempt, signified by the motion of his hand that we might all
  three enter. He whistled at the same moment, and there came forth a comely
  damsel, who, with many blushes and smiles, took possession of the reins of
  our horses.&mdash;" Stand there," quoth he, "stand there, little Cestia, and
  see if there be never a handful of corn to be got for the prince's cattle,
  stand there, and we shall be with you again anon." And then he also whispered
  something into the maiden's ear, and I saw her looking at me from under her
  eyelids with an expression of very uncommon curiosity. Two or three
  curly-pated urchins, of different sizes, joined her at the same moment, and
  to them, in her turn, the maiden whispered; whereupon the eldest of the
  children retreating behind her, eyed me earnestly along the skirt of her
  tunic, while the younger ones continued to gaze where they were, with looks
  of open stupidity and wonder. Of all this I could make nothing at the moment,
  but when we had got fairly into the inside of the tower, I heard the children
  whispering to each other, "A Christian! A Christian! A Jew! A Jew!"</p>

  <p>The lower part of the tower, into which I had now been conducted, seemed
  to form nothing more than one huge, bare, and quadrangular apartment,
  serving, I supposed (and rightly) at once as hall and vestibule to the upper
  chambers contained within the walls. A small flight of steps, in one of the
  corners, seemed to afford the only means of access to what was above; but
  from the position of a door immediately below these, it was we inferred that
  there were vaults under ground. Close beside this door there stood, upon a
  very rude pedestal, a still more rude bust, either of Jupiter, of Apollo, or
  of Hercules. The workmanship was such, that I could not be very certain which
  of the family it was intended to represent, nor whether the principal
  appendage was a club, a lyre, a bow, or a thunder-bolt; but it did not escape
  my observation, that the old keeper crept as close as he could to the sacred
  stone, as soon as I stepped over the threshold.</p>

  <p>One of the little boys that had come out to the door on our arrival,
  busied himself in setting forth a wooden board, whereon he placed in great
  order a huge piece of yellow cheese, and a heap of crisp white cakes of rye.
  A large jug of water also garnished the mess; but there seemed to be a little
  less of diligence, or more of difficulty, about the wine. After some pause,
  however, the mistress of the garrison appeared. A string of amber beads
  floated to and fro on the ocean of her bosom. She had fine golden bracelets
  on her arms too, but they were only half seen, being almost buried in fat;
  and she wore a flaxen wig, which did not entirely conceal the dark bristles
  below. At the girdle of the amazon hung, on the right side, the much
  desiderated bunch of keys, being balanced on the left by a dagger and
  toothpick case, almost of equal dimensions.</p>

  <p>"Will you drink to Caesar, young man?" cried the matron, ere the sitting
  had been much prolonged; "will you drink honestly to the Emperor, in case you
  also have a full cup given you? and, by the by, I think you must have almost
  as much need of it as the rest." And, with this courteous invitation, I heard
  her whisper to one of my guards, "By Jove, 'tis a proper lad, after all; is
  this true that they have told me of him? Why, I believe, the young man has a
  red edge to his gown. What is his name? who is he?" I heard him answer, "By
  the life of Caesar, you know as much about him as any of us. There was a
  whole cluster taken last night a little way beyond the Capena Gate, and he
  was one; but what they were about, or who he is, I know not, only he is
  certainly somebody, for I saw our Centurion salute him."&mdash;"I saw him
  with Sabinus," whispered the other "I am quite sure of it, the last day the
  Amphitheatre was open; they sat together, and appeared familiar."&mdash;"I
  pray you, sir," quoth the lady, raising her voice, "I pray you fill your cup,
  and here I pledge you to our better acquaintance. You shake your head well.
  But what must be, must; and while you are with us, we may at least be good
  friends."" Thanks," said I, complying with her command; "Here, then, is
  health to all present; and fair health to the great Trajan, says no one here
  more heartily than I." I drank off the wine, and setting down the goblet, I
  believe I said, "Excellent, by Jove," or something of that sort; for they all
  started when they heard what I said, and the old woman called out lustily,
  "Fill him another cup to the brim, whether he be Christian or not. The young
  man at least swears by the gods, and drinks to Caesar."</p>

  <p>"The old man," observed one of the soldiers, "he that was killed the other
  day in the Amphitheatre he might have saved his head, even at the last
  moment, if he would have done as much."&mdash;"Well, well," quoth she again;
  "let every one mind his own matters. Husband, bring down your book, and let
  the newcomer enter his name with his own hand."</p>

  <p>Having drained his cup, the keeper rose, and ere long returned with a
  musty scroll of parchment, which, having blown away the dust from it, he
  presented to me. I glanced over the record, and found in it the names of
  various persons, all apparently entered in their own handwriting; and most of
  them, as I could perceive, bearing date in the troublous reign of Domitian.
  The last was that of Marcus Protius Lamontanus, who, as it seemed, had been
  set free from his confinement immediately on the accession of Nerva; and
  immediately under this I wrote my own name, with that of my birthplace. The
  keeper read, and said, "So preserve me the power of Jove! A Valerius! and
  born in Britain! Can you be the son of the same Valerius who was Centurion in
  the ninth legion under Agricola?"&mdash;"You have guessed rightly I am the
  same." "Then the more is the pity," he replied, in a grave voice, "that you
  should have entered, in such a case as this, the dwelling of one that was a
  true soldier beneath the eagle of your father. But forgive me if in any thing
  we have been disrespectful."&mdash;"There is no occasion," said I, "for any
  such apology. I am here as a prisoner, and have been treated with all
  courtesy beyond what a prisoner could expect."</p>

  <p>"By Hercules!" interrupted the spouse, "I thought I had some knowledge of
  the face Well, I hope ten years hence he will be as fine a man as his father
  was the day he slew the Caledonian giant, and tumbled him from his chariot in
  front of all the line yes, in sight of Galgacus himself. It was the same
  day," said she, turning to her lord, "that you were taken prisoner, and
  driven away into the woods."&mdash;"As witness these marks," quoth the man;
  and with that he stripped open his tunic, and displayed part of his breast,
  stamped with various figures of blue and yellow, after the northern fashion,
  and bearing withal the traces of two formidable wounds.</p>

  <p>The woman redoubled her kindness; but not wishing to interrupt festivity,
  I soon requested her to show me the place where I was to be confined. And,
  indeed, as you may imagine, I had by this time not a little need of
  repose.</p>

  <p>Both she and her husband accordingly rose to usher me to my prison. I gave
  money to the soldiers, and requested them to inform Sabinus of the place to
  which I had been conveyed; but did not choose to write any thing, either to
  him or to Licinius, until I should have had a little time for reflection.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch208"
     name="ch208">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MY fatigue brought speedy sleep; and so profound, that
  before I again unclosed my eyes, the calm sea was already purple below me,
  and the sun about to set. But neither purple sea, nor golden sky, nor all the
  divine tranquillity of the evening air, could sooth my mind into repose,
  after I had once awaked to a sense of the situation into which I had been
  brought I should say rather of the situation in which Athanasia was placed.
  For myself, I could not in seriousness fear any calamity worthy of the name,
  if such should come, it must be my business to wrestle with it as I might.
  But to think of her, young, beautiful, innocent; and of all to which she
  might be exposed amidst the rude hands in which I had left her!</p>

  <p>Some time had passed before my attention was attracted by a conversation
  carried on in the chamber below me, in which you will not be surprised that I
  should have felt myself interested, even although the distance was such that
  I could not distinguish one word that was said. I knew from the first moment
  that it was impossible I should be mistaken I was perfectly certain it was
  Sabinus himself, who was talking with the old woman; and I at once suspected
  that the worthy Centurion, having learned from the soldiers who carried me
  off, to what place they had conveyed me, had undertaken this speedy journey,
  for the purpose of comforting me in my confinement. The kindness with which
  he had treated me from the beginning of our acquaintance had been such, that
  I could have no occasion to wonder at his exerting himself to discover me;
  but I confess this alacrity was more than I had been prepared for, and I
  waited only for the moment when he should enter my apartment to throw myself
  upon his bosom, and intrust all my troubles to him, as to a friend and a
  brother. There was something, however, which J could not at all comprehend in
  the merriment which seemed to be reigning below on his arrival. Peals of
  female laughter interrupted the uniform hearty tone of the Centurion's voice;
  and the feeble treble of the old Warder himself was stretched ever and anon
  in attempt at a chuckle.</p>

  <p>At last in they came, and Sabinus, embracing me affectionately, thrust
  into my hand a piece of parchment, which I perceived to be nothing less than
  an order for my immediate release. Then taking off his riding-cap, and
  rubbing with his handkerchief his most audacious and soldier-looking brows,
  "My dear boy," quoth he, "I see you are going to thank me but wound not
  modesty by fine speeches. There was war before Helen have a better care
  another time, and don't pay Rome such a poor compliment, as to say that you
  can find nobody to charm you but a Christian damsel, and no place for
  flirtation but a gloomy tomb lined with urns and lachrymatories. My honest
  friend here was quite frightened with the idea of having such an unbelieving
  reprobate as they said you were, under the same roof with her children. But
  now her fears are dispelled, for good souls are always tolerant to the little
  vagaries of young blood; so thank your hostess, my lad, kiss her hand, take
  one cup to the hearth of the old tower, and tighten your girdle."</p>

  <p>"Well!" quoth the woman; "who should have thought when the soldiers
  brought him in with such mystery, that it was all for kissing by moonlight! I
  protest to Venus, they would have made me believe he had been caught eating
  an infant; but still I cannot quite pardon him. Well well we must e'en take
  good hope he will mend ere he dies."</p>

  <p>"Die?" cried the Centurion; "do you talk of dying to one that has scarcely
  yet begun to live! Come, come, Caius, I hope, after all, you may never get
  into a worse scrape."</p>

  <p>"And if I do," said I, "I hope I shall always be equally fortunate in my
  jailers."</p>

  <p>"By the beard of Jove!" quoth Sabinus, "it needs no great skill to see
  that you have been fortunate in that respect. I swear that, if the truth were
  known, yon are almost as unwilling to leave this tower now, as you were last
  night to be torn away from another."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Master Kaeso," quoth she again, "when will you have done with your
  joking? Well, your father loved a jest in his time himself; but now he, I
  suppose, is quiet enough. And he, good old man, how does he wear? Can he
  still sit in his porch of a fine morning, and listen to the news, as he used
  to do, with his cup at his knee?"</p>

  <p>"I trust the old grasshopper can still chirp when the sun shines. But to
  tell you the truth, it is long since I have seen him; and if this young blade
  has no objection, I mean to pay him a visit this very night. I am only just
  come home from Britain, and have not yet had leisure to salute my Lares."</p>

  <p>I said something about being anxious to return as soon as possible to
  Rome; but the Centurion answered me with another shout, "Come, come; she 's
  safe enough. I suppose you think every one gets out of jail as easily as
  yourself."</p>

  <p>I found it was out of the question to disapprove of any of the schemes of
  Sabinus; so, having saluted the hostess, and flung my purse to her children,
  (who, by the way, still regarded me with looks of apprehension,) I
  accompanied him with a good grace to the gate. I made inquiry before I went
  forth concerning the old jailer likewise; but I could easily gather from the
  expression of face with which his wife accompanied her indistinct reply, that
  he had, long before that time, reached a state in which she felt little
  desire to exhibit him. The Centurion whistled as he stepped across the
  threshold, and there forthwith drew near a soldier, wearing the Praetorian
  helmet, (now sufficiently familiar to my sight,) and leading in his hand
  three horses. In the rear, I recognized, not without satisfaction, the busy
  countenance of my friend Dromo, whose ass did not appear quite so eager to
  join the party as its rider. A few sturdy thumps, however, at last brought
  the Cretan close to us, who saluted me with great appearance of joy, and then
  whispered into my ear, "Great Jove! we must keep silence for the present.
  What a story I have to tell; and I suppose there is one to hear likewise but
  all in good season. "We must not crack nuts before monkeys. I have a letter
  for you," he added, "from Sextus, and another from Licinius."</p>

  <p>The Centurion sprung on his trusty war-horse, who seemed to rejoice in the
  feeling of his weight; and we were soon in motion. I asked no questions
  either about the course or distance, but rode by his side so silently, that
  he bestowed on me many good-natured rebukes, for suffering a little affair of
  love to distress me so greatly. "Cheer up now," quoth he, "and do not make me
  repent of carrying you to my father's house, by showing the old man, who has
  had enough of troubles, such a countenance as must make him think of Orcus,
  even although he did not know himself to be near its gates. It is more than a
  year since I have seen him."</p>

  <p>This sort of speech he repeated so often, that I thought the best way
  would be to tell him frankly the true history of the adventure, from whose
  immediate consequences he had delivered me. I told him, therefore, every
  thing about both Tisias and Athanasia, and, indeed, kept nothing from him in
  the whole matter, except only what referred to the impression made on my own
  mind by what I had read of the Christian book, for, as to this subject, it
  was one which I totally despaired of being able to make him in any measure
  comprehend, and besides, the state of my own mind was still so uncertain in
  regard to it, and my information so imperfect, that I could not trust myself
  with speaking of it to any one, until I should have had leisure for more both
  of reading and of reflection.</p>

  <p>He preserved silence for some minutes, and then said, "In truth, Caius,
  you have distressed me. I thought it was merely some little frolic born of an
  hour, to be forgotten in a day; but I cannot refuse you my sympathy. Would I
  had more to offer!"&mdash;"Dear Sabinus," said I, "I know not how to thank
  you. You saw me but a few days ago the merriest young fellow that ever trod
  the pavement of Rome happy in the moments that passed, and full of glad hopes
  for all that were to come; but now I feel myself quite changed. Almost I wish
  I had never left my British fields; and yet I should never have seen
  Athanasia."&mdash;"Poor fellow!" quoth he, laying his hand on the mane of my
  horse, "I perceive there is, indeed, no trifling in your case. Compose
  yourself; whatever chances there may be in your favour will never be bettered
  by despondence." He paused a little, and proceeded " The worst of the whole
  is this new bitterness against these Christians. Except during Nerva's time,
  there was always some punishment to be feared by them, in case of being
  detected; but there was a way of managing things in almost every case, and
  people were well enough disposed to grant immunities which were always
  attended with some good to the Fisk. Nero and Domitian, to be sure, acted
  otherwise but these were madmen; and even they did so only by fits and
  starts. But now, when a prince like Trajan has taken up the matter, it is no
  wonder that one should consider it more seriously. One cannot help fancying
  he must have had some good reason before he began that is one thing; and
  having once begun, he is not the man to drop it lightly which is a more
  weighty consideration. Do you think there is positively no chance of her
  giving up this dream, when she finds what it has exposed her to?"</p>

  <p>"No," said I; "I am sure she will not, nor can I wish it would be
  otherwise with her."</p>

  <p>"Well," he resumed, "I enter into your feelings so far, my friend, even on
  that point. I cannot imagine you to have been so deeply smitten with a girl
  of a flighty unsteady character. But then this is not a case to be judged of
  on common principles. It is no light thing to be exposed to such examinations
  as are now set afoot for these people; and if she behaves herself so
  resolutely as you seem to expect, what is the end of it? I consider it highly
  probable for there is no friendship in uncandid speaking that, in spite of
  all her friends can do, they will banish her at the very least; scarcely dare
  I speak of it, but even worse than banishment has heretofore befallen Romans
  ay, Roman ladies too, and these as high in birth and place as Athanasia."</p>

  <p>"My dear Sabinus," said I, "do not imagine that now for the first time all
  these things are suggested to me. Imagine rather, how, unable for a moment to
  expel them from my mind, I have spent these miserable hours. Her friends,
  too, what must not be their alarm!"</p>

  <p>"The thing was so done," quoth the Centurion, "that I think it is
  impossible it should have made much noise as yet. If there was in the family
  no suspicion that the lady had any connection with these people, they must be
  in perfect perplexity. I lay my life they take it for granted she has had
  some private intrigue, and has gone off with her lover."</p>

  <p>"Alas!" said I, "when they hear the truth, it will be still worse than
  this in their eyes. Yet it appears fit that no time should be lost in making
  them acquainted with the real state of the case. Sabinus, I foresee that in
  all these things I shall have need of your counsel and your help."</p>

  <p>"You shall have them both, my dear boy," said he, "you shall have them
  both to the uttermost. But there is no question at all about the propriety of
  telling the relations all you know. Licinius is probably well acquainted with
  them. I am almost sorry for having prevented your immediate return to the
  city; and yet one night will soon be over."</p>

  <p>"But Athanasia herself "</p>

  <p>"Ah! that indeed is a point of some difficulty. It was merely from having
  remembered who the men were that rode off with you, that I was enabled to
  learn so soon whither you yourself had been conveyed. But the party consisted
  of a few men out of almost every one of our cohorts, those, in short, that
  were on duty, scattered up and down in different parts of the city; and I may
  not find it very easy to discover who had the care of any other
  individual."</p>

  <p>"But Athanasia "</p>

  <p>"True," said he, "I had not thought of it. There was but one female
  besides herself. That will furnish a clue. You may rely on it, I shall easily
  find out the place to which they have taken her; but then where, and at what
  distance that may be, Heaven only knows; for it seemed as if every prisoner
  were to be carried to a separate place of confinement. At all events, even if
  we knew where she is, we could do nothing at present.</p>

  <p>Come, cheer up, now you have unburdened yourself of all this load. I shall
  be ready to start as early as ever you please in the morning."</p>

  <p>By this time the moon was in full splendour, and nothing could be more
  beautiful than the scenery of the native place of Sabinus, as we drew near to
  its precincts. A little gentle stream, which kissed our path, did not desert
  us as we entered the village, but murmured all through its humble street.
  Street, indeed, I should not say; for there were dwelling-houses on the one
  side only, the other being occupied with gardens, in the midst of which I saw
  the Doric portico of a small temple. In front of this a bridge crossed the
  stream, and there we were met by a troop of maidens, who seemed to be moving
  toward the sacred place with some purpose of devotion, for they were singing
  in alternate measures, and in their hands they carried garlands. Some
  recognized Sabinus, and, without interrupting their chant, saluted him with
  their laughing eyes. We halted our horses, and saw them proceed all together
  into the hallowed enclosure, which they did, not by means of the bridge,
  although they were close by it, but by wading hand in hand through the stream
  below; whose pebbles, as it appeared from the evenness of their motion, dared
  not to offer any violence to the delicate feet that trod upon them. "Happy
  creatures," said I to the Centurion; "of a surety they think these moonbeams
  shine on nothing but glad faces like their own. Alas! with what heart does
  poor Athanasia at this moment contemplate this lovely heaven!"&mdash;"Nay,
  Valerius," quoth he, "if people were not to be contented with their own share
  of sorrow, would the world, think ye, be worth living in? I hope Athanasia
  herself will ere long sing again by the moonlight. But stop, here is my own
  old haunt, the abode of our village barber, and now I think of it, perhaps it
  might be as well that you and Dromo should remain here for a moment, till I
  ride on to the house, and let them know you are coming, for the sudden sight
  of strange faces might alarm the old folks at this hour."</p>

  <p>He had scarcely said so, when the tonsor himself, hearing, I suppose, the
  sound of our horses' feet, ran out with his razor and basin in his hand, to
  see what might be the matter. "Ah, good Virro," quoth the Centurion, "with
  joy do I once more behold your face. Well, the girls still sing, and Virro
  still shaves; so every thing, without question, goes well."&mdash;"The
  Centurion himself!" replies the barber; "so Venus smile upon me, it is Kaeso
  Sabinus, who I began to think would never come back again. Here, boy, bring
  out a cup of the best. Alight, I pray you well, at least, you shall kiss the
  rim of the goblet."&mdash;"I will," said he, "I promise you, my good friend,
  and that in a minute or two; but I must first salute my father; and, in the
  meantime, I leave with you in pledge, good Virro, my excellent friend here,
  and the most knowing Cretan that ever landed at Brundusium. Dismount,
  Valerius, I shall be with you again ere Virro can half smoothen the chin of
  Dromo, which even this morning showed no small need of
  trimming."&mdash;"Well, well," said the tonsor, "eagles will have their own
  way. Be speedy."</p>

  <p>The Centurion had set the spur to his charger; and we, in obedience to his
  command, submitted ourselves to the guidance of the oily-faced little barber.
  A stripling was already holding two horses at the door, but another came out
  and took care of our animals, and we entered, exchanging courteous
  salutations, the tonsorial penetralia.</p>

  <p>They were occupied by as various and talkative a company, as the
  imagination of Lucilius ever assembled in such a place. In the middle of the
  room, which was spacious, though low-roofed, hung a huge shield of brass,
  with a dozen mouths of flame blazing around the edge of its circumference,
  close beside which sat a man with a napkin tucked about his neck, the one
  side of whose visage, still besmeared with a thick coat of lather, testified
  that the curiosity of Virro had induced him to abandon a yet uncompleted job.
  The half- trimmed physiognomy, however, displayed no sign of impatience, and
  the barber himself seemed not to think any apology necessary, for he resumed
  his operations with an air of great cheerfulness, saying, "Neighbours all,
  here is Kaeso Sabinus, that is now the Centurion, come once more to gladden
  the old village with his merry face, and that, I promise you, is prettily
  tanned since we knew him first."</p>

  <p>This piece of news appeared not a little to interest several of those who
  were sitting under the tonsor's roof. "Ha!" said one, "the noble Centurion!
  Well, has he brought home a wife with him at last? for the talk was, that he
  had been seen at the Amphitheatre, paying great court to one of the richest
  ladies in Rome."</p>

  <p>"A wife?" says Virro, "no, no, centurions and barbers can do without
  wives. But if he is to have one, I shall be happy to hear she is rich; for
  centurions, after all, sometimes carry most of their silver upon their
  helmets, as we do most of our brass on our basins."&mdash;"Indeed," said I,
  "I never heard of it before."</p>

  <p>"If it please you, friend," said another of them, "is this the same
  Sabinus that has lately been in Britain?"&mdash;"Britain," quoth an ancient
  dame; "I never heard that name before Britain! I know it not I know not where
  he hath been, but they told me it was over the sea, perhaps in
  Palestine."&mdash;"Tut, dame," interrupted the barber, (who was now busy on
  Dromo,) "you think every one goes to Palestine, because your own boy carried
  a spear with Titus; but you know they ruined the city, and killed all the
  Jews and Christians, and there is no occasion for sending Centurions thither
  now."&mdash;"Killed all the Jews and Christians, said you T quoth another. "I
  think the old dame has the better of you as to that point at least, Virro.
  Not Trajan himself will ever be able to kill them all; the superstition
  spreads like a pestilence. It was but last night that a hundred of them were
  taken together in one place, eating human flesh."&mdash;"Human flesh!" quoth
  the barber. "Oh, ye gods, why do ye endure such barbarians!"</p>

  <p>"Human flesh!" echoed Dromo, springing from his seat, and I looked at him,
  and saw that the barber in his horror had made in truth a deep incision upon
  the cheek of the poor man. The blood, oozing from the cut, had already traced
  a river of crimson upon the snowy surface of his well-soaped chin. It was
  this that had deranged the philosophic composure and customary phlegm of my
  Cretan; and no wonder; but the enthusiastic tonsor took no notice of what had
  occurred.</p>

  <p>"Great Jove," he proceeded, and he pointed to the roof with his razor as
  he spake " Great Jove! I adjure thee! are all thy lightnings spent; is there
  never a thunderbolt' remaining?"</p>

  <p>"In the meantime," quoth one of the bystanders, "they are in the hand not
  of Jove, but of Trajan, and he, I think, cannot now be accused of treating
  these wretches with too much lenity. You have all heard of that
  Tisias?"&mdash;"We have," cried another; "but what was a single individual.
  to this great assembly? what a sight will it be the day they are all
  executed!"</p>

  <p>"I think," said the same person who had inquired whether our Centurion
  were the Sabinus that had been in Britain, "I think you are overrating the
  numbers of that assembly. I heard of no mere than a dozen."</p>

  <p>This stranger (for such he seemed) had probably taken that day a
  considerable journey, for his tunic and boots were covered with dust. He was
  attired in the plainest manner, but notwithstanding, there was something
  about him which gave one the idea of rank superior to the company in which he
  was seated; and his complexion was so dark that I could not help thinking to
  myself, I am not the only provincial in the room; here is certainly some
  well- born African or Asiatic.</p>

  <p>"You have not told me, however," said he, after a pause, "whether or not
  this be the Sabinus that was lately in Britain."&mdash;"Sir," said I, "it is
  the same; I myself came in the same ship with him, but a few days ago. He is
  a Centurion in the Praetorian Bands."&mdash;"Yes," replied the stranger, "I
  guessed in truth, it must be the same; for I remember no other of that rank
  bearing the same name."&mdash;"If you are acquainted with him," said I, "you
  may have an opportunity of seeing him immediately, for I expect him here
  every moment to conduct me to his father's villa, which is hard by."</p>

  <p>"Well," quoth the barber, who by this time had ended, without fresh
  misadventure, the trimming of the Cretan " well, I hope he will stay for a
  moment when he does come, and then we shall be sure to hear the truth as to
  this story about the Christian assembly. They may talk as they please, but
  may Jove devote me, if I had Caesar's ring upon my finger for one night, this
  should be the last of them."&mdash;"And how, friend," said the stranger, "by
  what means, if I may ask you, should you propose so speedily to do away with
  this fast-spreading abomination?"&mdash;"Look ye, sirs," quoth he, "I would
  place myself thus in my tribunal" (he took his seat at a little table, beside
  a goblet of wine, as he spake,) " I would seat myself thus in the midst of a
  field, as Cato and the great Censors of old used to do. I would cause Rome to
  be emptied man, woman, and child should pass before me; and every one that
  did not acknowledge the gods as he passed, by all the gods! he should sprawl
  upon a tree in presence of all the people. What avails watching, prying,
  spying, and surprising? I should make shorter work of it, I trow."</p>

  <p>"You may say what you will," said one who had not before spoken, "I cannot
  bring myself to believe every thing I hear concerning their superstition."
  "Ay, goldsmith," quoth the barber, "you were always fond of having an opinion
  of your own; and, pray, what is it that you have had occasion to know about
  the Christians, more than the rest of us who hear you? If you mean that you
  have seen some of them die bravely in the Amphitheatre, why, that we have all
  heard of at least, and I think nobody disputes it."&mdash;"No, master
  barber," replied he, "that is not what I was thinking of. I have seen your
  common thief-knave, when he knew he could do no better, brace you his nerves
  for the extremity, and die like a Hercules. I would rather judge of a man by
  his living than his dying."&mdash;"True," rejoins Virro; "and pray, what have
  you got to tell us about the life, then, of the Christians?"&mdash;"Not
  much," said he, "you shall hear. My old mother (peace to her manes) was
  passing the Salarian one day last year, and there came by a hot-headed spark,
  driving four abreast in a chariot as fiercely as Nero in the Circus. He
  called out, that I believe, but the dame was deaf, and whether he tried to
  pull up, I know not, but the horses trod upon her as she fell. Another of the
  same sort came close behind, and I have been told they were running a race;
  but however that might be, on they both passed like a whirlwind, and my poor
  mother was left by herself among the flying dust. But the gods had mercy on
  her; they sent a kind heart to her aid. She was carried into one of the
  stateliest villas on that side of Tiber, and tended for six weeks by a noble
  lady, as if she had been not my mother, but her own; and this lady, friends
  by Jove I suspected it not for long after this lady was a Christian; but I
  shall not say how I found it out, nor would I mention the tiling at all but
  among honest men. But where were these you spoke of taken? I should like to
  know who they were." "They were taken," said the stranger, "not far from the
  Appian Way, within one of the old monuments there, a monument, it is said, of
  the Sempronii." "Of the Sempronii?" cried the goldsmith, "Phoebus Apollo
  shield us!" and from that moment he became as silent as hitherto he had been
  communicative.</p>

  <p>The swarthy stranger, the silence yet continuing, arose from his seat,
  laid a piece of money upon the table, and moved towards the door. The barber
  also rose up, but he said to him, "Sit still, I pray you, my friend;" at the
  same time beckoning with his finger to the goldsmith, who, with a very
  dejected countenance, followed him into the street. What passed between them
  there, we perceived not; but the artificer re-entered not the chamber till
  some moments after we had heard the departing tread of the stranger's horses.
  When he did come in again, he had the appearance of being in great
  confusion.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch209"
     name="ch209">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SHORTLY after Sabinus reappeared, and bidding adieu to our
  tonsor, we walked with him towards the paternal mansion, and we soon reached
  it; for, as I have already said, it was but a little way out from the
  village.</p>

  <p>The dwelling was modest enough, having no external ornament but a single
  portico, with a few statues ranged between its pillars. We entered by this
  portico, and found the feeble old man sitting by himself in an apartment
  immediately adjacent, wherein the beams of the moon, having partial access,
  were mingled with the subdued light of a painted lamp suspended from the
  ceiling. The father of my friend had all the appearance of sinking apace; yet
  he received me with an air, not of cheerfulness, but of kindness. The breeze
  found admission through the open pillars, and his countenance exhibited in
  its wan and faint lines the pleasure with which the coolness affected him.
  Beside him were placed baskets of roses, gathered from the abundance of his
  gardens. The young Vernae, who from time to time brought in these flowers,
  came into the chamber with a decent appearance of sobriety and concern; but
  they were never long gone before we could hear them laughing again at their
  play. "Poor children," quoth the old man; "why should they trouble themselves
  with thinking of the not remote victim of Orcus?" To which the Centurion
  replied, somewhat softening that loud and cheerful tone with which he was
  accustomed to address all persons " Courage, my dear father, you must not
  speak so. Cerberus, I perceive, has only been making an ineffectual snap at
  you, and you will be growing younger after all this."</p>

  <p>At which the old man shook his head, without any external sign of emotion,
  and replied, in a low monotonous voice, "Younger in the wrong way, my boy;
  for I become every day smaller in body, and feebler, and less able to do any
  thing to help myself. Nor am I unconscious that I have seen my due proportion
  of time. And yet, oh! fast sliding gentle brook, which I see between these
  paternal trees I am still loath to exchange thee for Styx, and to lose the
  cheerful and sacred light of the sun and moon. I wish only I were once more
  able to repair with thy stream to the banks of father Tiber, that I might
  salute the good Emperor, who has been so kind to my son, and who would treat
  even an old broken-down, and long-retired soldier, like myself, with more
  favour than is to be expected from Rhadamanthus. As clouds let down their
  drops, so the many-peopled earth lets fall dismissed ghosts upon the Stygian
  shore."</p>

  <p>While he was saying things in the same strain, an ancient Egyptian, who
  seemed to have the chief management of every thing, came into the chamber,
  and after desiring some of the boys to bring forth refreshments, took his
  place on a low stool by the foot of his master's couch. "Come, Tarna," said
  the Centurion, "what has become of all your philosophy? Why do you not
  inspire our friend with less of gloominess? Why is it that you do not bring
  out for his use some of those old stories, with which, when I was young, you
  were more willing to treat my ears than they were to attend?"</p>

  <p>"Nay," said the invalid, before the Egyptian could make any answer, "I
  liked well to listen to his Epicurean theories when I was able to walk about
  the fields; but now I would rather have him be silent. Do not trouble me any
  more, good Tarna, with any of your speeches. Allow me to believe as all my
  fathers did, and to contemplate not only the sepulchre in which their urns
  are placed, but the same dim regions in which many dear shades expect the
  greeting of a descendant."</p>

  <p>"To me," said the slave modestly, "it still seems, that by the rushing
  shower of atoms which moves every where through space, the mind is soothed,
  as by the sound of a great river carrying continually the watery offspring of
  the mountains into the bosom of ocean. The mind, sirs, appears to me to be
  calmed by the contemplation of infinity, even as the ear of an Egyptian
  sleeper is calmed by the eternal music of rolling Nilus. It mingles itself
  with that which it contemplates; it perceives it feels itself to be a liquid
  part of that vast endless stream of universal being: a part which has been
  casually arrested and detained, but which will soon mingle again and be
  scattered away in a thousand fragments, to wander, no one knows whither,
  through the great all-receiving void not to lose existence, for in that my
  dear master entirely misunderstands me but to cease from feeling as &amp;
  Sabinus, or a Tarna."</p>

  <p>The old man kept regarding his Egyptian with a placid smile; but I could
  not help interposing: " What is this you have said? Do you assert that I can
  cease to be Valerius, to feel as Valerius, and yet not lose my existence? Can
  I be, and yet not be myself?"</p>

  <p>"Most easily," replied he; "the divided fragments may move about for a
  thousand years, before it befall any of them to be stopped in some future
  combination of atoms. These, it is manifest, only tremble and suffer when
  they form part of a soul, but are immediately released from all pain or
  mischance, when this confinement and cohesion are at an end, and they, being
  dispersed, regain liberty and wander about singly, as of yore; for, as our
  great dispeller of delusion says When death is, we are not. If, therefore,
  Sabinus shrinks from the fear of death, it is an idle fear. Does he not
  perceive that when death arrives, Sabinus is no longer to be found. Whatever
  its effects may be, they must affect not him, but an army of innumerable
  disjointed essences, in no one of which could he by any means be able to
  recognize himself."</p>

  <p>"To make a short story out of a very long one," interrupted the Centurion;
  "life, you think, is not worthy of the name of existence that being so, it is
  no wonder you should think lightly of death."</p>

  <p>"Mistake me not," quoth the sage; "no life is existence; I not only admit
  that, but I assert that it is the business of every man, and the sole true
  object of wisdom, to render life, while it endures, pleasant. Earthly
  pleasure consists in a bland juxtaposition of atoms necessarily, though not
  permanently, connected; the removal of pain implies that quiescence which
  pervades the nobleness of the unenclosed ALL. To exist in this shape, we are
  compelled; it is our business to render our existence as near an approach to
  felicity as we may."</p>

  <p>"Fill your cup, Tarna," quoth the Centurion; "I am no great philosopher,
  yet methinks I can see the drift of this part of your story. Fill up your
  goblet, most venerable Epicurean, and see (if it be not below your dignity,)
  whether the atoms, which, by a fortuitous and temporary juxtaposition have
  formed your throat, will not feel their corners very philosophically softened
  by the rushing of a little rivulet of good Falernian one cup of which, saving
  your presence, I hold to be more worthy of wetting my guttural atoms, than
  all the water that ever sported its music between Memphis and
  Alexandria."</p>

  <p>While the slave and the Centurion were thus discoursing, the old man
  appeared to taste, as it were, the pleasure of a renovated existence, in
  contemplating the brown health and strong muscular fabric of the inheritor of
  his name. The hearty masculine laugh with which my friend usually concluded
  his observations, was, I take leave to think, richer music to his ears than
  ever Egyptian heard in the dark rollings of the Nile, or Epicurean dreamt of
  in the airy dance of atoms. I suspect he was more reconciled to the
  inevitable stroke of fate, by considering that he was to leave such a
  representative behind him, than by any argument which his own superstition,
  or the philosophy of his attendant, could suggest. In return for this obvious
  admiration, the Centurion, without question, manifested every symptom of
  genuine affection. Yet, I think, the instinctive consciousness of his own
  strength made the piety of the robust son assume an air more approaching to
  that of patronage, than might have been altogether becoming. If such a fault
  there were, however, it escaped the notice of the invalid, who continued,
  till Tarna insisted upon his retiring, to gaze upon my friend, and listen to
  his remarks, with looks of exultation.</p>

  <p>The Centurion withdrew with his father, so that I was left alone with
  Tarna for some time; and it was then that, in my juvenile simplicity, I could
  not help expressing my surprise at finding in servile condition a man
  possessed of such acquirements as his, and addicted to such pursuits.</p>

  <p>"It would argue little," he replied, "in favour of such pursuits, if they
  tended only to make me repine at the place which has been allotted me no
  matter whether by the decree of fate, or the caprice of fortune. And after
  all, I am not of opinion that any such external circumstances can much affect
  the real happiness of any one. Give to him that has been born a slave, what
  men are pleased to call his freedom; in a few weeks he will become so much
  accustomed to the boon, that he will cease to think of it. Heap wealth upon
  him; to wealth also he will gradually become habituated. Rank power with all
  it is the same. It is in the mind only that the seat of happiness is placed;
  and there it never can be, unless in companionship with thoughts that look
  down upon, and despise being affected by trifling things."</p>

  <p>"And are such," said I, "the views of all those who follow your sect?"</p>

  <p>"I wish it were so," he replied; "but ere you remain long in the city, you
  will meet with not a few, philosophers only in the name, who, having small
  means of subsistence, but being desirous of leading a luxurious and agreeable
  life, become teachers of such doctrines as may accord best with the vicious
  inclinations of those who are most likely to entertain them. These persons
  assume too often the name of Epicureans. They are seen every where at feasts
  crowned with myrtle, and fawning upon gouty senators; and whenever a boar's-
  head appears, they are sure to call it worthy of Meleager. Their conversation
  is made up of stale jests about Charon and his boat, and the taking of
  Auguries; and, when finally inebriated, they roll upon the ground like those
  animals, to whom, in consequence of the proceedings of such hypocritical
  pretenders, the ignorant have dared too often to liken the wisest of mankind.
  Such things I disdain I am satisfied to remain, as I was born, in the rank of
  Aesop, Epictetus, Terence."</p>

  <p>By this time the Centurion had returned. He had a lamp in his hand; and he
  interrupted our conversation. "Come, we start betimes, Caius; and you too, my
  sweet cock of Cyrene, I think you had better fold your wings, and compose
  yourself upon your roost."</p>

  <p>Oh, enviable temperament! said I to myself you liken the slave to a bird.
  Methinks yourself are more deserving of the simile. The light and the air of
  heaven are sufficient to make you happy your wings are ever strong their
  flight ever easy and the rain of affliction glides off them as fast as it
  falls. Sleep softly, kind heart. It is only the troubles of a friend that can
  ever disturb your serenity.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch210"
     name="ch210">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I WAS in bed before Dromo interrupted my reflections by
  saying, in a low tone of considerable confidence, "And now, Master Valerius,
  do you still continue, as much as two days ago, to disbelieve in philtres and
  despise enchantresses? You see what, with all my precaution, has come of this
  connection between Rubellia and the Neapolitan."</p>

  <p>"In truth, Dromo," I replied, "it is visible that Pona had some share in
  leading the soldiers to the Sempronian Sepulchre; but I am doubtful if that'
  had any thing to do with the private affairs of the lady Rubellia. As to that
  matter, I confess myself entirely in the dark."&mdash;"Dark indeed," quoth
  he, "must your observation have been, if you have yet to learn that, but for
  that accursed witch, nothing of all this had befallen; but if there be an
  edict against the Christians, there are twenty laws against sorcery; and that
  both Pona and she that consulted her shall know well ere long, if they do not
  as yet know it; or may Cretan change places with Boeotian?"&mdash;"Say on,
  good Dromo," I replied, "I am all ears; and as you appear to have been all
  eyes, I shall probably soon be more enlightened."</p>

  <p>"Well," quoth he, "I am glad to find that you are in a mood to listen to
  me decently. You remember where I took my station when you mounted those
  unfortunate steps upon the tower. I had not stood there many minutes before I
  heard somebody approaching; and having no doubt it was Rubellia, I was
  preparing myself for giving her such a salutation as I thought would put a
  speedy end to her wandering for that night. On came the steps, but no
  Rubellia. No; it was Xerophrastes himself; and although he had laid aside the
  Greek mantle, and donned a boatman's black cloak for the nonce, I promise you
  I knew his stately gait well enough beneath all these new trappings. It was
  no part of my job, however, to attempt frightening the stoic."&mdash;"And so
  you let him pass without doing any thing?"&mdash;"I did; I confess I gave one
  or two groans after he had gone on a few paces, but I did not observe him
  much quicken his walk, and I believe, to do the man justice, he set it all
  down to the wind rustling among the trees. But I thought not much of him at
  all, to speak the truth; for, said I to myself, Well, if it be as I have
  suspected for these two blessed days, and this master long-beard is really in
  league with the widow, the chances are, she herself is not far behind him. I
  lay by, therefore, and expected in silence till I should hear another tread;
  and in the meantime I spoke to you once or twice across the path, but you
  made me no answer, for which you know your own reasons."&mdash;"The reason,"
  said I, "was a very simple one, I assure you. I had fallen asleep, and no
  wonder, for you know how long I had been a watcher."&mdash;"Well," said he,
  "I guessed as much, and it was nothing but the born tenderness of my
  disposition, which made me cease from offering you any disturbance. I thought
  I should surely be enough single-handed for the widow; and besides, in case
  of need, I knew your waking would always be in my power."</p>

  <p>"Admirably reasoned, Dromo," said I; "and so it seems no need came, for
  you certainly never awakened me; for which I may thank the bonds from which
  the Centurion's kindness has just set me free. But you have atoned abundantly
  I pray you, get on with your tale."</p>

  <p>"Presently," he resumed, "I heard footsteps, indeed, my good master, and
  not footsteps alone, but voices; and I moved from the place as hastily as I
  could, till I came to a tree, the branches of which, springing low on the
  trunk, offered an opportunity for mounting, which I should have been a
  Boeotian indeed had I neglected. I mounted, and hiding myself as well as I
  could among the boughs, awaited the arrival of the party, which consisted ay,
  stare if you will of Xerophrastes and the widow, walking in front, in earnest
  talk by themselves, and the Neapolitan in the rear. They halted, and though
  they spoke low, I could hear them distinctly."&mdash;"And what, in the name
  of Heaven, said they?"</p>

  <p>"'Are you sure,' said the widow, 'that this is indeed the girl whom Sextus
  went to see at the Villa? Can there be no mistake?'&mdash;'Mistake, lady,
  there is none,' replied the Stoic. 'Pona was at the villa with her basket,
  and she saw them all walking together in the garden.'&mdash;'And this little
  Christian,' said the lady as if to herself, 'it is she that has cost me all
  this trouble! It is for this Athanasia that I have been insulted as never
  woman was by man, and they are both here in the tower!'&mdash;'They are,
  lady,' quoth the witch; 'they are both in the tower, for I saw her go in by
  her self first, and then in went some dozen of those muffled blasphemers,
  and, last of all, went in he himself. I saw him not enter indeed, but I swear
  to you, that I saw him here not twenty paces from hence, and he had with him
  that cunning slave of his, (meaning myself, sir,) whose ugly face, (the foul
  woman added,) I would know although it were disguised beneath all the washes
  that were ever mixed in the seething-pots of Calabria.'&mdash;'But what,'
  interrupted our long-beard, 'what will Licinius say? At least, my lady and my
  friend Pona will take good care that no suspicion rests upon me. Sextus is a
  silly boy, without taste, judgment, or discretion; but Licinius is acute and
  powerful.'&mdash;'Fear not,' said Rubellia; 'fear not, dear Xerophrastes.
  Nobody shall appear in the matter except Pona, and she tells you she has
  already given warning at the Capena Gate. There are always a hundred men
  stationed on the Coelian. Nothing can save them!'</p>

  <p>"These words were scarcely out of her mouth, ere the soldiers were heard
  approaching. Xerophrastes ascended with great agility a tree just over
  against mine; Rubellia retreated among the pines; and Pona alone awaited the
  guard. I would have periled a limb to have been able to give you the alarm;
  but little did I suspect, that had I sought you where I left you, I should
  have sought in vain.&mdash;How, I pray you, did you contrive to get into the
  accursed tower?"</p>

  <p>I told him I should give him the story another time at full length, and
  mentioned briefly what had occurred. And then the Cretan proceeded with his
  narrative.</p>

  <p>"I leave you to guess, Valerius, how my heart beat when I saw the witch
  lead the soldiers straight to the place where I supposed you were still
  sitting&mdash;with what anxiety I saw the tower surrounded&mdash;its tenants
  brought out,&mdash;with what astonishment I saw you led out, the last of
  their number.&mdash;I had neither time to think by what means all this had
  happened, nor the least power to interfere. I saw you all
  mounted&mdash;guarded&mdash;borne away. Whither they carried you, I was
  unable to make the smallest conjecture. I saw Sabinus speak to you, and then
  I had hope,&mdash;but that too failed. In brief, I did not venture from my
  tree till the whole assembly, not forgetting Xerophrastes, had departed; and
  you may judge what a story I had to tell Sextus when I reached home.</p>

  <p>"Instead of waiting to ponder and hesitate, as he used to do when his own
  matters perplexed him, he went from me straight to his father. But before
  they had done with their conversation, Sabinus himself arrived, and he was
  immediately taken into the same chamber where they were. Licinius and he went
  out together soon afterwards, and I think they walked towards the Palatine;
  but whithersoever they went, they had a good deal of work before them, for
  the day had advanced considerably before they returned. The Centurion's
  horses were brought to the door shortly after; my master desired me to
  accompany him; and gave me letters for you, which I had almost forgotten to
  deliver."</p>

  <p>Such was the story of the faithful Cretan. The letter of Licinius I have
  still preserved:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">"Since our Sabinus desires that I should write to you,
  although his own kindness renders it unnecessary that I should do so, I
  cannot refuse. I understand little, my Valerius, of what has brought you into
  this condition, from which, not without difficulty overcome, you are,
  notwithstanding, speedily to be delivered. I guess, that hastiness of various
  sorts, not, however, entirely without excuse in a person of your age, has
  been the means of implicating you in the affairs of a sect, equally unworthy
  of your communication, whether you consider the country in which their
  superstition originated, or the barbarities with which it is stained. But
  even for beauty, my young friend, it becomes not a Roman, least of all a
  Valerius, to forget what is due to the laws of Rome, and the will of the
  Prince. Consider with yourself how nearly you have escaped serious evil.
  Return to us, and forget what has passed, except for the lesson it must teach
  you. Of Rubellia and Xerophrastes I am unwilling to believe, without farther
  examination, what has been told me by my slave Dromo. We shall speak of that
  and other matters, when (which I hope will be early to-morrow) you once more
  give me the pleasure of seeing you. I have then much to say. Farewell."</p>

  <h2><a id="book3"
     name="book3">BOOK III</a></h2>

  <h2><a id="ch301"
     name="ch301">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">DAY was far advanced before the Centurion and myself once
  more drew near to the city. When we reached the first declivity beyond the
  Anio, the sun was about to sink behind the Janicular. The innumerable sounds
  of the capital, blended together into one mighty whisper, seemed only to form
  part of the natural music of the air, and might almost have been confounded
  with the universal hum of insects. We rode slowly down the hill, the base of
  which is ever darkened by the solemn groves of the Appian.</p>

  <p>We advanced in silence through that region of melancholy magnificence. I
  scarcely knew whether I should be able of myself to recognize, among so many
  similar edifices, the mausoleum of the Sempronii, and some feeling rendered
  me unwilling to put any questions concerning it to Sabinus.</p>

  <p>But while we were moving leisurely, we heard of a sudden a clang of
  cymbals among the trees, a little to the right hand, and the Centurion,
  saying, "What company can this be?" led the way down a narrow path branching
  from the main road. This path was winding and dusky, being edged on either
  side with pines and cypresses, so that for some space we saw nothing; and the
  cymbals having ceased again, the Centurion said, "I suppose it is some
  funeral; they have probably completed every thing, and have seen out the last
  gleam among the embers. Let us get on, for perhaps we may be kept back by
  their procession, if they are already returning." We quickened our pace
  accordingly, till a sharp turning of the road discovered to us a great number
  of persons who were standing silent, as if in contemplation of some ceremony.
  Several persons on .horseback seemed, like ourselves, to have had their
  progress interrupted; but they were sitting quietly, and making no complaint.
  The silence of the whole assembly was indeed such, that Sabinus motioned to
  me to ask no questions, adding, in a whisper, "Take off your cap; it is some
  religious rite&mdash;everybody is uncovered."</p>

  <p>The Centurion, however, was not a person to be stopped thus, without
  wishing to understand farther the cause of the interruption. The one side of
  the road was guarded by a high wall, to the top of which a number of juvenile
  spectators had climbed;&mdash;the other by a ditch of great breadth, and full
  of water, beyond which was a grove of trees; and I saw him eyeing the ditch,
  as if considering whether, by passing it, it might not be possible, without
  disturbing the crowd, to get nearer the object of their attention, or at
  least to make progress in our journey. At last he beckoned to me to follow
  him, and the bold equestrian at one leap passed easily. I imitated the
  example, and so did the Praetorian soldier, his attendant, who had now come
  up to us; but as for Dromo, he was obliged to remain behind.</p>

  <p>Ere we reached the bottom of the declivity, I perceived that we had come
  close to the Sempronian monument, and that the ceremony, whatever it might
  be, was taking place in front of the tower. We gave our horses to the
  soldier, and contrived to gain the bank over against it&mdash;the same place,
  in fact, where the Cretan slave had taken his station among the pine-trees,
  on the night when all those things occurred of which I have spoken to you.
  Like him, we placed ourselves as quietly as we could behind the trees, and,
  indeed, for our purpose, there could have been no better situation. We were
  contented, however, to occupy it as much as possible without attracting
  observation; for it was evident, in spite of the curiosity that detained so
  great a multitude near at hand, there must be something mysterious or ominous
  of nature in that which was taking place, since not one of the crowd had
  dared to come forward, so as to be within hearing of the officiators.</p>

  <p>And these, indeed, were a melancholy group. For men, and women, and
  children of every age, to the number it may be of an hundred, appeared all
  standing together in garments of black; while, in the midst of them, and
  immediately by the base of the tower, two or three veiled priests, with their
  necessary assistants, seemed to be preparing for sacrifice a black bull,
  whose hoofs spurned the dust as they held him, and his gilded horns glittered
  in the light of the declining sun. Sabinus no sooner discovered the
  arrangement of the solemn company, than he whispered to me, "Be sure, these
  are all the kindred of the Sempronii. Without question they have come to
  purify the mausoleum, and to avert the vengeance of the violated Manes.
  Behold," said he, "that stately figure, close to the head of the animal on
  the right hand; that, I know, is Marcia Sempronia, Priestess of Apollo.
  Without doubt, these by her are her brothers."</p>

  <p>"Some of her near relations they must be," I made answer; "for observe you
  that girl whose face is wrapped in her mourning veil, and whose sobs are
  audible through all its folds? I had one glimpse of her countenance, and I am
  sure it is young Sempronia, the cousin and companion of Athanasia, the
  daughter of Lucius the senator."</p>

  <p>"Poor girl," replied Sabinus, "from my heart I pity her. They are all
  joining hands, that the nearest of the kindred touching the priest, his deed
  may appear manifestly to be the deed of all."</p>

  <p>At this moment, one of the officiators sounded a few mournful notes upon a
  trumpet. The priest who held the axe, clave at one blow the front of the
  bull. The blood streamed, and wine streamed with it abundantly upon the base
  of the mausoleum; and then, while we were yet gazing on the convulsions of
  the animal, the trumpet sounded a second time, and the whole company sung
  together, the priest leading them.</p>

  <p>The shadows of the tower and of the pine trees lay strongly upon them, and
  I thought there was something of a very strange contrast between the company
  and their chant, on the one hand, and the beautiful sculptures, full of all
  the emblems of life and happiness, on the other, with which, according to the
  gay dreams of Grecian fancy, the walls of the funereal edifice itself had
  here and there been garnished. Fauns, and torch-bearing nymphs, and children
  crowned with garlands, and wreathed groups and fantastic dances, seemed to
  enliven almost to mockery the monumental marbles; but one felt the real
  gloominess both of death and of superstition, in the attitudes and accents of
  the worshippers. It was thus they sung:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">Ye Gods infernal! hear us from the gloom<br>
  Of venerable depths remote, unseen;<br>
  Hear us, ye guardians of the stained tomb,<br>
  Majestic Pluto&mdash;and thou, Stygian Queen,<br>
  On the dark bosom leaning of great Dis&mdash;<br>
  Thou reconciled Star of the Aybss.</p>

  <p class="verse">Blood, not for you, unholy hands have poured,<br>
  Ye heard the shriek of your insulted shrine;<br>
  Barbarian blasphemies, and rites abhorred,<br>
  Pollute the place that hath been long divine;<br>
  Borne from its wounded breast an atheist cry<br>
  Hath pierced the upper and the nether sky.</p>

  <p class="verse">With blood of righteous sacrifice again<br>
  The monumental stone your suppliants lave.<br>
  Behold the dark-brow'd bull&mdash;Behold him slain!<br>
  Accept, ye powers of the relenting grave,<br>
  The sable current of that vital stream;<br>
  And let the father's hope upon the children gleam.</p>

  <p class="verse">And ye, that in the ever dusky glades<br>
  Of Hades, wandering by Cocytus' shore,<br>
  Ancestral spirits&mdash;melancholy shades&mdash;<br>
  With us the trespass of the tomb deplore;<br>
  Oh! intercede that terror and disgrace<br>
  May not possess (as now) your resting-place.</p>

  <p class="verse">What though the liquid serpent of the deep<br>
  Between lie coiled in many a glittering ring:<br>
  Not unobserved of your pale eyes we weep,<br>
  Nor to deaf ears this doleful chant we sing;<br>
  Strong is the voice of blood through night to go,<br>
  Through night and hell, and all the realms below.</p>

  <p class="verse">Then hear us, kindred spirits&mdash;stately Sire<br>
  And pensive Mother! wheresoe'er ye glide;<br>
  If ever solemn pile and soaring fire<br>
  In freedom sped you to the Stygian tide.&mdash;<br>
  Have pity on your children: let the breath<br>
  Of living sorrow melt the frozen ear of death.</p>

  <p class="verse">For HER that, sprung like us from your high line,<br>
  Hath mingled in the sacrifice of guilt,<br>
  Ye know that angry star, her natal sign,<br>
  To expiate whose curse this blood is spilt;<br>
  If not suffices this atoning blood,<br>
  Oh, steep the thought of her in Lethe's flood.</p>

  <p class="verse">Beneath that current lazy and serene,<br>
  In whose unfathomable waters lie<br>
  The slumbering forms of horrors that have been<br>
  In Hades, and in Ocean, Earth, and Sky&mdash;<br>
  With long forgotten curse and murder old,<br>
  Steep that lost daughter's errors manifold.</p>

  <p class="verse">Once more for you an hallowed flame there burns.<br>
  Once more for you an hallowed stream there flows;<br>
  Despise not our lustrations of your urns,<br>
  Nor let unhoused Manes be our foes!<br>
  Above the children of your lineage born,<br>
  Hover not, awful ghosts, in anger and in scorn.</p><br>

  <p>These words were sung, as I have said, by the whole of this kindred there
  assembled together; the first part of them distinctly, though not loudly; but
  the last verses in a note so low, that no one, unless quite near, (like
  ourselves,) could have comprehended their meaning. But as for the young
  Sempronia, when they came to that part of the chant in which reference was so
  particularly made to Athanasia, not only did her lips refuse to join in the
  words, but her agitation was such that I thought the poor maiden would have
  screamed outright, had she not been controlled by the eye, and the hand also,
  of her aunt the Priestess. Sobs, however, and low hysterical groans, could
  not be stifled; and at last so great was her agony, that even the haughty
  Priestess was compelled to give way to it.</p>

  <p>"Bring water," said she; "dash ye water upon the foolish thing: methinks
  it seems almost as if she had partaken in the frenzy of her
  unhappy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And before she could finish the sentence, one or two of the females that
  were present did take hold of Sempronia, and began, seeing there was no water
  nearer at hand, to bear her slender form towards the small stream of which I
  have already spoken, and which flowed immediately behind the clump of pine
  trees, amongst which the Centurion and I were standing.</p>

  <p>She was quite passive in their hands; and they dragged her without
  resistance or difficulty to the place where we were standing; but they could
  not pass without seeing us: and no sooner did the eyes of Sempronia fall upon
  me, than she burst by one unexpected effort from the arms of those that were
  sustaining her, and ere I or any one could suspect what she was to do, there
  lay she at my feet, clinging with her arms around my knees. "Oh, Valerius,"
  said she&mdash;"Oh, dear Valerius, they curse Athanasia! Where is my
  Athanasia? whither have they taken her? Oh, tell me, that I may go to
  her&mdash;that I may go to comfort Athanasia!"</p>

  <p>"Peace!" said, before I could answer, the Priestess of
  Apollo&mdash;"Peace, mad, wretched thing,&mdash;has infatuation blasted the
  whole of our line?" And she seized Sempronia by the arm, and compelled her to
  spring from her knees. But the maiden still clung by her hands to me, and
  continued, with looks and words of misery, to demand from me that knowledge
  which, alas! I would myself have given so much to possess. Sabinus, however,
  smote me on the shoulder, as if to make me recollect myself; and I had
  resolution enough not to betray the feelings with which I listened to
  Sempronia's frantic supplication.</p>

  <p>"What is this, sir?" then said the Priestess&mdash;"What is it that you
  know of Athanasia? and why is it that you have presumed to witness the secret
  sacrifice of a noble race?&mdash;Speak&mdash;or is there no meaning in this
  poor girl's frenzy? And yet, methinks I have seen you before, and that, too,
  in the presence of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It was," said I, hastily&mdash;"it was indeed in the presence of
  Athanasia; but that circumstance, if you please to remember, was altogether
  accidental. I was with the lady Rubellia when you found her in the Temple of
  Apollo&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said she, "it was that same day when she refused to name the name
  of Phoebus in his own precincts! Ha! little did I imagine what thoughts were
  in her breast&mdash;else might we at least have been spared this open
  degradation. And yet you, methinks, saluted Athanasia.&mdash;What is your
  name, sir?&mdash;Know you, in truth, whither the lady Athanasia has been
  conveyed?"</p>

  <p>"He was with her! he was with her!" exclaimed Sempronia,&mdash;"he was
  with her in the tower when the soldiers came.&mdash;O Valerius! tell me where
  she is now,&mdash;into what dungeon have they cast my friend&mdash;my sister
  "</p>

  <p>"Ha!" quoth the Priestess, "he was with her in the tower!
  Romans&mdash;kinsmen&mdash;Lucius&mdash;Marcus&mdash;hear ye this? I charge
  ye, seize upon this treacherous blasphemer!&mdash;It is he that has deceived
  Athanasia; and now must he come here to taint the smoke of our sacrifice, and
  pollute our prayers with his presence. Seize him!" And she herself grasped my
  cloak as she spake&mdash;"Seize, I charge ye, this accursed Christian!"</p>

  <p>But Sabinus, when he saw the Priestess thus furious, stept forward, and
  said to her kinsmen, who were standing in perplexity behind her, "Sirs, I
  beseech you, be not you also carried away with this madness.&mdash;My friend
  here knows nothing of the lady Athanasia, except that she was borne away by
  soldiers from the very place where we are standing. I myself witnessed it
  also, being here with the Praetorians. Valerius is no more a Christian than
  she who accuses him."</p>

  <p>"I know not, sirs, how we are to understand all this," said one of the
  Sempronii, in a calm voice. "Is this young man the same Valerius who is
  living in the house of Licinius?&mdash;Yet it must be he. I have been with
  Licinius this very day; and if this be he, whatever he may have known before,
  I am sure he knows nothing of where Athanasia is now,&mdash;and, sister, I am
  well assured he is no Christian."</p>

  <p>"It is the same, sir," said Sabinus. "He is the same Caius Valerius of
  whom you spake, and I am Sabinus, a Centurion of the Praetorians."</p>

  <p>"We have all heard of your name," said Sempronius, respectfully; "I
  perceive there is some mistake in all this matter. If it please you, let us
  walk aside, and understand each other."</p>

  <p>So saying, he withdrew Sabinus to a little distance, and beckoned to me to
  accompany him. "Valerius," said the old man, when he perceived that we were
  out of hearing, "I crave you, in the first place, to forget all this trouble
  which has been occasioned to you by the violence of my daughter, on the one
  hand, and of my sister on the other. They are women; and, for different
  reasons, the violence of both is excusable. I have been for a considerable
  part of this day with Licinius, and have heard from him enough to satisfy me
  how guiltlessly you yourself have been involved in this affair; and your
  speedy liberation from confinement is more than enough to confirm my belief
  of all that tie said. Yet there is much which I do not understand. I pray you
  speak openly, and fear nothing&mdash;you have, indeed, nothing to fear. Was
  it in consequence of any private meeting with my niece&mdash;nay, I mean not
  to suspect you of any thing amiss&mdash;in one word, how was it that you
  happened to be taken into custody with that unhappy girl?"</p>

  <p>"Sir," I replied, "you are a noble Roman, and the near kinsman of
  Athanasia. You have a right to put these questions, and whatever reluctance I
  may have to overcome, I feel that I have no right to refuse an answer." And
  so I told Sempronius, plainly and distinctly, the story both of my unwilling
  entrance into the mausoleum, and of my forcible abduction from it. In short,
  I saw no reason to conceal any thing from the person who was most likely to
  be able to serve Athanasia, if any thing to serve her were possible.</p>

  <p>"It is well," he said; u you speak as becomes a man of the Valerian blood.
  But as for poor Athanasia, I swear to you I cannot yet bring myself to
  believe that he hath in reality been privy to such things as have been
  discovered concerning these Christians."&mdash;"Discovered!" said I. "I pray
  you, what has been discovered concerning them? If you allude to any of the
  wild stories that are circulated about their religion, you may depend upon
  it, it is all mere madness to believe a word of it. I have read in their
  sacred books myself, and I swear to you, that, so far as I have seen, nothing
  can be more simple, benign, humane, than the morality inculcated by their
  leader."</p>

  <p>"Young man," he answered, "I was not thinking of their creed, which, for
  aught I know or care, may be sublime enough; for there was always a
  mysterious sort of philosophy current among those old Asiatic nations. But I
  speak of the designs of these men; in one word, I speak of their conspiracy."
  "Conspiracy!&mdash;What? How? Against whom? I will pledge my life, no
  conspiracy was sheltered beneath yon tower that night. I swear to you, they
  are simple people, and were thinking of nothing but their
  worship."&mdash;"Worship!" quoth he; "I promise you it will not be so easy to
  persuade me that Cotilius has suddenly become a man of so much piety, either
  to our gods, or to the deities (if they have any) of the
  Christians.&mdash;What, Cotilius? By Jove, Rome does not hold at this moment
  a more bold, daring, godless rascal. You may as soon try to make me believe
  that Capaneus came to Thebes with a hymn in his mouth. No, no&mdash;the sworn
  friend of Domitian will not easily gain credit for his new-sprung
  sanctity."&mdash;"Cotilius? That was the very name of the man that seized me,
  as I have told you."&mdash;"I should have guessed as much," said he; "Yes, I
  promise you, how little soever Athanasia might have known, secrets they had;
  and Cotilius was well aware at what peril they should be revealed."</p>

  <p>"The late example," said I, "must indeed have alarmed him."&mdash;"What,"
  said he, "do you speak of that fanatic Syrian? You know little of Cotilius.
  No, no&mdash;had the worst of his fears been the necessity to worship all the
  deities between Euphrates and Rhine, he would have slept soundly."&mdash;"But
  surely," said I, "you do not believe that Athanasia had any knowledge of the
  man's secret designs, if he had any. He may have used Christianity, or
  desired to use it, as a weapon against the State; but be certain, neither she
  nor any of those really attached to their religion, had any notion of his
  purpose."</p>

  <p>"It may be so, indeed," he answered; "Heaven grant it may. As for
  Cotilius, I will speak to you more at length of him anon. I will bid adieu to
  my sister, and take order about my daughter; and then, if it so please you,
  we shall walk together to the city."</p>

  <p>To this I agreed, but Sabinus rode on to the camp of the Praetorians. He
  whispered to me, however, that unless he were most necessarily detained, he
  should be, ere long, at the house of Licinius.</p>

  <p>"To you," said the Senator, as we went on, "who have so lately come from
  your island, the whole of this expiatory spectacle is probably quite new; but
  I am sure Sabinus could not have been aware what was its purpose, otherwise
  he would not have been guilty of so grievously offending the feelings of my
  sister, and some of the rest of my kindred, by remaining a witness of these
  most private rites. The Priestess is indeed inconsolable, and her grief has
  set half her other passions in motion likewise. Athanasia was as dear to her
  as if she had been her daughter; so, in truth, she was to us all, ever since
  her parents died. But Cotilius, this knave Cotilius, has, I fear, blasted her
  hopes and ours."&mdash;"It occurs to me," said I, "and I should have
  mentioned it to you before, that there seemed to be no great understanding
  between this Cotilius and Athanasia. She was evidently displeased with many
  things he both said and did; and he, on his part, did not appear to relish
  her interference."&mdash;"True," he continued, "you have already hinted as
  much; and I assure you, these are some of the circumstances in the whole case
  that tend most to excite my hopes. Great Heavens! what would Caius have said
  had he dreamt that his orphan was to be suspected of having sympathy with any
  of the dark designs of that shame to Roman knighthood! But you, of course,
  are a stranger to this man's history."&mdash;"With its end, at least," I
  replied, "it is like we may all be soon enough acquainted."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said he, "Heaven grant we have not cause too deeply to remember it!
  but I have known him from the beginning. I told you already that he was in
  great favour with Domitian."&mdash;"And the reverse, of course," said I,
  "both with Nerva and Trajan."</p>

  <p>"Even so," he continued, "and with reason; for in all the disturbances
  which occurred on the accession of the last sovereign, and, in particular, in
  those foul intrigues among the Praetorians, which at one time brought Nerva's
  own life into immediate danger and compelled him to bare his neck to the
  soldiery at his gate, this Cotilius was more than suspected to have had a
  deep concern. When Petronius and Parthenius* were hacked in pieces, it needed
  no great witchcraft to detect some of the moving spirits that produced their
  catastrophe; but proof there was none at the time; and even had there been
  proof enough, the good old man would have been too timid to act upon it.
  These things, however, could not be forgotten either by Nerva or his
  successor. Hitherto, the strong hand has repressed every rebellious motion;
  but be sure that no man ever lived more an object of suspicion, than this man
  has done ever since Nerva adopted Trajan."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* These were the principal conspirators by whom Domitian
  was slain. They were afterwards butchered by the Praetorians, who regretted
  the tyrant; and it was supposed to be chiefly in consequence of that
  slaughter, and its shameful consequences to himself, (for he was compelled,
  among other insults, to return public thanks to the butchers,) that Nerva
  called to hit aid the personal vigour and high military genius of Trajan.
  ]</p>

  <p>"And you think," said I, "that, among other intrigues, it had occurred to
  this man to make his own use of the Christians; despised and persecuted
  though they be, there can, indeed, be no doubt that their numbers are
  considerable, and that their faith is a strong bond of cohesion."</p>

  <p>"It is even so," said the Senator. "But as yet the treason even of
  Cotilius rests on suspicion only, and report; and, after all, even if he were
  proved guilty of having nourished such schemes, the account you give of what
  you saw and heard at their assembly, inspires me with considerable doubts
  whether he can be supposed to have ever as yet ventured to invite their
  participation; unless, indeed, they practised deception while you were with
  them. The moment I heard of what had happened, I went to the Palatine, in
  hopes of attaining either assistance from Urbicus, or mercy, if that were all
  we could look for, from Trajan. But Urbicus could give me no satisfaction,
  except that my niece was in a solitary and safe place. The charges, he said,
  against one of the leaders (he meant Cotilius) were heavy; and until these
  were sifted, it was impossible that access could be afforded to any one who
  had been thrown into confinement. The Emperor had shown unusual symptoms of
  anxiety, and had even, so he hinted, been in person investigating the matter
  at a distance from the city, during great part of the preceding night and
  day. To tell you the truth, Valerius, till this thing fell out, I was wont to
  consider the new violence about the Christians as somewhat unworthy of the
  enlarged intellect of Trajan: it had not occurred to me, how easily the
  resources of such a superstition might be enlisted in the cause of
  discontent."</p>

  <p>"Of course," said I, "nothing will be done in regard to Athanasia until
  all circumstances have been examined."</p>

  <p>"Done!" said he; "has not enough been done already to justify almost in a
  man more than you have seen among our women? Has not a whole family been
  disgraced? Has not the mausoleum of their fathers been prostituted for the
  unholy purposes of this barbarian sect? If the Senate should be summoned,
  with what countenance should I show myself among my friends?&mdash;Unhappy
  girl! How little did she know in what trouble she was to involve those that
  love her the best."</p>

  <p>By this time we had come within sight of the house of Licinius, and the
  Senator took leave, with a promise that I should see him on the morrow.</p>

  <p>I found Sextus alone in his chamber, where he embraced me with all the
  ardour of juvenile affection. "Alas!" said he, "my dear Caius, at any other
  time I might have found fault with you for taking so great a part in my
  griefs, and yet keeping so many of your own to yourself. But if it be indeed
  as Sempronia has said, I should be a strange friend to choose this hour for
  complaining of such trifles as regard only myself."</p>

  <p>"Sextus," I replied, "it was only because of the greatness of your own
  distresses that I concealed from your kindness any of mine."</p>

  <p>"My Valerius," he answered, "we shall talk at length to-morrow; at
  present, I have only time to say, that the misfortune of Athanasia was
  communicated to Sempronia almost immediately, by an old freedwoman, who had
  been in the habit of attending her when she went from home in secret, and
  who, going to the mausoleum to accompany her on her return, arrived there
  just in time to see what befell her. She saw you also, (how she knew who you
  were, I know not,) and when she had told her story to Sempronia, the poor
  girl, before speaking even with her father, sent for me to come to her in the
  gardens. I did so; all that passed I need not repeat; but I hope my advice
  was the right one. At all events, I acted for the best, and my father, who is
  now aware of every thing, seemed to approve of what I had done. O Valerius!
  were Athanasia free, and you happy, many things have occurred to make me much
  more at ease than when you left us. My father is evidently shocked with what
  Dromo told about Rubellia; and as for Xerophrastes, he had not once spoken to
  him either yesterday or to-day. Indeed, neither of them have been much here.
  My father is continually exerting himself concerning Athanasia; and
  Xerophrastes, I suppose, is afraid of a discovery. As for me, I am sorry I
  must leave you, for I promised to meet Sempronia; and although I have nothing
  to tell her, I cannot fail in my appointment. She must have returned before
  this time from the mausoleum, where an expiatory sacrifice was to be made at
  sunset."</p>

  <p>Sabinus by this time had hastened to me once more, according to his kind
  promise. I told him that my kinsman was not at home, and that I proposed, in
  the meantime, accompanying his son a part of the way towards the Suburban of
  Capito. The Centurion insisted on going with us, saying, that he could not
  think of returning to the camp without having spoken with Licinius.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch302"
     name="ch302">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE Centurion, in virtue of his office, had free access to
  the gardens of Trajan; so he led us by both a more delightful and a nearer
  path towards the Salarean Gate. Young Sextus then quitted us; and we returned
  slowly through the beautiful groves of the Imperial Villa, in hopes of
  finding my kinsman by the time we should reach his mansion. But as we were
  walking very quietly along one of the broad green terraces, we heard voices
  in an adjoining alley, separated from us by luxuriant thickets of myrtle, and
  Sabinus, whispering to me, "Hush, let us see what we have got here,"
  insinuated himself with great dexterity among the verdant shrubs. I followed
  him with as little noise as was possible, and having found a convenient
  peeping place, we soon perceived two figures at some little distance from us
  in the moonlight.&mdash;"Come, Sabinus," I whispered, "they are lovers
  perhaps&mdash;I don't see what right we have to overhear."&mdash;"Peace,"
  quoth he, "if you stir, they will detect us, and it is nothing unless it be
  known."</p>

  <p>With some reluctance I remained where I was; but my scruples were at an
  end the moment I perceived who they were.</p>

  <p>"Most noble, most illustrious lady," said Xerophrastes, "this matter has
  indeed been conducted unfortunately, yet no reason see I why you should give
  way to so many groundless apprehensions. The only thing, after all, that you
  have lost, if indeed you have lost it, is the good opinion of Licinius; for,
  as to that foolish boy&mdash;"&mdash;"Name him not," replied Rubellia, "name
  not the stripling. Surely madness alone can account for my
  behaviour."&mdash;"Madness!" quoth the Stoic; "yes, truly, and who, at
  certain moments, is free from such madness? As Euripides has expressed it,
  Venus, if she come in wisdom, is the wisest; if otherwise, the most frenzied
  of influences. The greatest have not been exempt from such visitations.
  Banish it from your heart, noble lady, or replace it by something more worthy
  of your discernment. There is, I think, but one pair of eyes in Rome that
  could have been blind to such perfections."&mdash;"Xerophrastes!" said she,
  "speak not to me of perfections. Alas! I was born under a deceitful
  star&mdash;a star of apparent splendour and real misery."&mdash;"Noble lady,"
  he replied, "I swear to you that what tincture of philosophy I have imbibed,
  is unable to sustain my serenity when I hear such words from your lips. You
  are surrounded by all that externals can minister. It is your part to compose
  your mind, and then how should it be possible for you to taste of
  unhappiness? Think no more of that boy."</p>

  <p>The philosopher took her hand with an air of the deepest sympathy, and at
  the same time drew the end of his mantle over his face, as if to conceal the
  extent of his participation in her distresses.&mdash;"Alas! lady, this is,
  after all, a miserable world. There is no rest but in the affections, and
  behold how they are harassed on every hand by the invidious accidents of
  life. Philosophy proclaims her antidote, but the poison is every where; and
  it is all "one course of being wounded to be cured, and being cured only to
  be more easily wounded again."</p>

  <p>Our friend continued in an attitude of pensive contemplation. The
  moonbeams fell full on his high brow and the large massy features of his
  countenance, and on the robust limbs which emerged from below the stately
  folds of his mantle; and I could not help thinking that there was something
  almost heroic, which I had never before remarked, in the whole of his
  appearance. Rubellia kept her eyes fixed steadfastly upon him.</p>

  <p>"I should have known nothing of it," he resumed, "had I never deserted my
  paternal valley for the vain pleasures of Athens, and the magnificence of
  Rome."&mdash;"You repent," said she, "that you ever visited Italy? I pray you
  deal with me openly. If it be your wish to leave Rome, speak, and I shall put
  it in your power to retire to Greece as handsomely as you could ever have
  hoped to do from the family of Licinius. Of wealth, as you well know, I have
  enough both for myself and for my faithful friends, among whom, be sure, I
  place you in the first rank. Control your feelings, I pray you once
  more&mdash;and speak freely."</p>

  <p>Hastily and fervently he pressed his lip upon the beautiful hand of
  Rubellia, and whispered something into her ear. She started, and I think
  blushed in the moonlight; but neither seemed offended very deeply with what
  he had said, nor with the gesture he had used.</p>

  <p>"Softly, softly," whispered the Centurion, "be not ashamed, fair lady, of
  the love of thy servant."</p>

  <p>But (whether the echo of his Horatian parody had reached her ear or not, I
  cannot tell), scarcely had these words been uttered, ere Rubellia started
  from her seat, and began to move pretty quickly down the shaded alley, as if
  towards the entrance of the gardens. Xerophrastes sat still for a moment,
  even after the lady had arisen, covering his eyes, and part of his broad
  forehead with his hands, as if buried in his own thoughts too deeply to be
  with ease affected with a sense of things passing around him. Then, at last,
  he arose, and uttering an exclamation of surprise, walked after the noble
  dame, taking heed, however, (it did not escape our observation,) to arrange,
  as he rapidly followed her, the massive folds of his mantle into a graceful
  drapery.</p>

  <p>Sabinus restrained himself till they were beyond the reach of his voice;
  but he then made himself ample amends. "Ha!" said he, "is this to be the end?
  Most pensive ghost of Leberinus, is this to be thy successor?"&mdash;"Good
  heavens!" said I, "Sabinus, do you think it possible she should make the
  pedagogue her husband she that was but yesterday so desperately enamoured of
  the beautiful young Sextus?"&mdash;"My dear islander," quoth the Centurion,
  "do you remember the story of a certain beautiful boy, called
  Adonis?"&mdash;"To be sure," said I, "who is ignorant of the story of Adonis,
  or of the beautiful verses of Bion&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="verse">'I weep for fair Adonis&mdash;for Adonis is no more,<br>
  Dead is the fair Adonis&mdash;his beauty I deplore;<br>
  His white thigh with a tusk of white the greenwood monster tore,<br>
  Aud now I weep Adonis&mdash;for Adonis is no more.'"</p><br>

  <p>"Well spouted," quoth the soldier; "and with an excellent gravity: But
  think you Venus never altered the burden of her ditty? Have you never heard
  of Mars the blood-stained, the destroyer of men, the leveller of city
  walls&mdash;nor of Anchises, the Dardan shepherd, wiser in his generation
  than one who inherited both his station and his opportunity; no, nor even of
  Vulcan, the cunning Artificer, the Lord of the One-eyed Hammerers, the
  Lemnian, the Chain-maker, the Detector, the awkward Cup-bearer, whose
  ministration, as honest Homer confesses, fills Olympus with inextinguishable
  laughter. Have you heard of all these, and I take it of a few more besides;
  and yet do you talk as if Venus, after the white boar's tusk had pierced the
  white thigh of her Adonis, had made no use of her beautiful girdle, but to
  wipe the tears from her pretty eyes withal?&mdash;her girdle, of which,
  heaven pity your memory, I know not how many blessed ages after Adonis had
  fallen, the same faithful bard said,</p><br>

  <p class="verse">'In it is stored whate'er can love inspire:<br>
  In it is tender passion, warm desire,<br>
  Fond lovers' soft and amorous intercourse;<br>
  The endearing looks and accents that can fire<br>
  The soul with passionate love's resistless force,<br>
  'Gainst which the wisest find in wisdom no resource.'</p><br>

  <p>I was there the night she espoused Leberinus, and I pitied her very
  sincerely, when I saw the pretty creature lifted over the old man's threshold
  in her yellow veil, which I could not help thinking concealed more sighs, if
  not more blushes, than are usual on such occasions. But I promise you the
  glare of her new torches shall affect me with different emotions."</p>

  <p>Such talk passed as we were leaving the gardens of Trajan. But as we
  advanced into the more peopled region, we found the streets full of clamour,
  insomuch that quiet discourse could no longer be carried on. The evening was
  one of the most lovely I had ever seen, and the moon was shedding a soft and
  yellow light upon the lofty towers and trees, and upon all that long
  perspective of pillars and porticos. Yet groups of citizens were seen running
  to and fro with torches in their hands; while many more were stationary in
  impenetrable crowds, which had the air, as it seemed to us, of being detained
  in the expectation of some spectacle. Accordingly we had not jostled on much
  farther, ere there arose behind us a peal of what seemed to me martial music;
  but my companion, as soon as the sounds reached him, warned me that a
  procession of the priests of Cybele must be at hand.</p>

  <p>At last they came quite close to us, and passed on dancing around the
  image of the Goddess, and singing the chant of Atys. A path being opened for
  them by the crowd all along, they made no halt in their progress, but went on
  at the same pace, some of them leaping high from the ground as they dashed
  their cymbals, and others dancing lowly while they blew the long Phrygian
  trumpets and crooked horns of brass. The image itself was seated in a brazen
  chariot, to which brazen lions also were fastened, the whole being borne on
  the shoulders of some of the assistants. Behind it came others, beating great
  hollow drums; and then again more, leaping, and dancing, and singing, like
  those who preceded it. They were all clad in long Asiatic vests, with lofty
  tiaras; and their countenances, as well as their voices, intimated
  sufficiently that they were ministers of the same order to which the hapless
  Atys had belonged. Yet nothing but enthusiasm and triumph could be discovered
  in their manner of singing that terrible hymn.</p>

  <p>They had not advanced much beyond the spot where we were standing, ere
  they stopped of a sudden, and, placing the chariot and image of Cybele
  between the pillars of one of the porticos that run out into the street,
  began a more solemn species of saltation. When they had finished this dance
  also, and the more stately and measured song of supplication with which it
  was accompanied, the priests then turned to the multitude, and called upon
  all those who reverenced the Didymaean mysteries, to approach and offer their
  gifts. Immediately the multitude that were beyond formed themselves into a
  close phalanx, quite across the street, and torches being conveyed into the
  hands of such as stood in the foremost rank, there was left in front of the
  image an open space, brightly illuminated, for the convenience, as it seemed,
  of those who might come forward to carry their offerings to the foot of the
  statue. And, indeed, it appeared as if these were not likely to be few in
  number; for the way being quite blocked up by those torch-bearers, no one
  could hope to pass on easily without giving something, or to pass at all
  without being observed. Not a few chariots, therefore, and litters also,
  having been detained, the persons seated in these vehicles seemed to be
  anxious, as soon as possible, to present their offerings, that the path
  onward might be cleared to them by command of the priests. It was necessary,
  however, as it turned out, that each person in advancing to the chariot of
  Cybele, should imitate the motions practised by the Galli themselves; and
  this circumstance, as may be imagined, was far from being the most acceptable
  part of the ceremony to some of those who had thus been arrested. A few of
  the common sort, both men and women, stepped boldly into the open ring, and
  with great appearance of joy went through the needful gesticulations. But, at
  first, none of the more lordly tenants of the chariots and litters seemed to
  be able to prevail on themselves to follow the example. At length, however,
  the impatience even of these dignified persons began to overcome their
  reluctance; one and another red-edged gown was seen to float in lofty
  undulations across the torch-lighted stage, and when a handful of coin was
  heard to ring upon the basin of the Goddess, doubt not the priests half-
  cracked their cheeks in blowing horn and trumpet, and clattered upon their
  great tambourines as violently as if they had made prize of another Atys. But
  how did the Centurion chuckle when he observed that one of the next chariots
  was no other than that of Rubellia herself, and perceived that she and the
  Stoic were now about to pass onwards like the rest, at the expense of
  exhibiting their agility before the multitude.</p>

  <p>"Jove in heaven!" cried he, "I thought the garden scene was all in all;
  but this is supreme! Behold how the sturdy Thracian tucks up his garment, and
  how, nodding to the blows of the tambourine, he already meditates within
  himself the appropriate convolutions. And the pretty widow! by the girdle of
  Venus, she also is pointing her trim toe, and, look ye! better and better, do
  you not see that she has given her veil to the Stoic, that so she may perform
  the more expeditely?"</p>

  <p>At this moment, some one from behind laid hold of my arm, and whispered my
  name. I looked round, and perceived an old man, wrapped f in a very large and
  deep mantle, the folds of which, however, were so arranged that I could see
  very little of his features. Stepping a pace or two backwards, he beckoned to
  me with his hand. I hesitated; but his gesture being repeated, I also entered
  within the shade of the pillars, and then he, dropping his mantle on his
  shoulders, said, "Valerius, do you not remember me? We met last at the tomb
  of the Sempronii."&mdash;"At the tomb of the Sempronii!" said I; and
  recognized, Indeed, the features of the Christian priest, who had treated me
  on that eventful evening with so much courtesy; but my wonder was great to
  find him in such a situation; for I had seen him conveyed away between armed
  guards, and I could not imagine by what means he, of all others, should have
  so soon regained his freedom. He observed my astonishment, and said, in a low
  voice, "My friend, perhaps I might have as much reason to be surprised with
  seeing you here, as you have in seeing me. But follow me into this house,
  where we may communicate what has occurred."</p>

  <p>The hope of perhaps hearing something concerning Athanasia determined me.
  I cast a look towards Sabinus, and saw him attentively engaged in witnessing
  the performance; and hoping that he might continue to amuse himself so for a
  few minutes longer, I permitted the old man to lead me into the vestibule.
  The slaves, who were waiting there, seemed to receive him with much respect.
  He passed thorn, saying, "Do not trouble yourselves&mdash;I shall rejoin your
  master;" and shortly ushered me into a chamber situated over the hall of
  entrance, where a grave personage was reclining by the open window. He
  perceived not our approach till we had come close up to his couch, for he was
  occupied with what was going on without. When the old man accosted him, and
  said, "Pontius, I have been successful. Here is my friend, Caius Valerius,"
  the stranger rose up, and saluted me with kindness. "Caius Valerius," said
  he, "will pardon me for being desirous of seeing him here, when he learns
  that I was one of his father's oldest friends, and served with him many
  campaigns both in Germany and Britain. I should have been ill pleased had I
  heard that you had been in Rome, and departed without my having an
  opportunity of retracing, as I now do, the image of my comrade."</p>

  <p>I had to answer not a few questions concerning the situation of my mother
  and myself, before I could lead the conversation into the channel I desired;
  and at length, indeed, it was not so much any thing I said, as the readiness
  of the priest himself, which gave to it that direction; for the first pause
  that occurred in the discourse between Pontius and myself, he filled up, by
  saying, "And now, will Valerius pardon me for asking, if he has ever looked
  again into the narrative of Luke, or whether his curiosity, in regard to
  these matters, has been entirely satisfied by the adventures of one
  unfortunate night?"</p>

  <p>The manner in which Pontius regarded me when the priest said this, left me
  no doubt that he was at least .favourably inclined to the opinions of the
  Christians; so I answered without hesitation, "My curiosity, instead of being
  satisfied by what I saw that evening, received new strength; but you may
  easily believe that the troubles in which I was involved, and still more the
  troubles with which I know others yet to be surrounded, have hitherto taken
  away from me both the means and the power of gratifying my curiosity as I
  would wish.&mdash;But tell me, I pray you, by what means is your imprisonment
  at an end?"&mdash;"My friend," replied the priest, "you speak naturally but
  rashly. I believe you yourself are the only one of those surprised in the
  tower, whose imprisonment has as yet terminated. Yet hope, good hope is not
  absent,&mdash;above all, I trust there is no reason to despair concerning
  that dear child who interfered in your behalf, when a bold, and, I fear me, a
  false man, had drawn his weapon to your peril. As for me, I have but gained
  the liberty of an hour or two, and long ere dawn I shall be restored again to
  my fetters."&mdash;"Your fetters!" said I, "am I to understand, that, by the
  connivance of a Roman jailor, you are this night at liberty to perambulate
  the streets of Rome?"&mdash;"Young man," answered the priest, "he is a
  Christian."&mdash;"Even for his sake," said I, "the name is honourable."</p>

  <p>"Valerius," said he, "I pray you speak not things which may hereafter give
  pain to your memory. Already you have read something of the life of ONE, for
  whose sake our name is indeed honourable&mdash;of Him I trust you shall ere
  long both read and think more; but how shall I bless God, that threw my lot,
  since captivity it was to be, into a place where such authority was to have
  the superintendence of me? Yet more, how shall I be sufficiently grateful,
  that She, in all things so delicate, although in nothing fearful, has shared
  the same blessing?"</p>

  <p>"Heavens," said I, "what do I hear!&mdash;Is Athanasia indeed lodged in
  the same prison with yourself, and may she also go abroad thus freely?"</p>

  <p>"Think not," he replied, "that I embrace such freedom for any purposes of
  mine own. What I do for the service to which I am bound, think not that
  Athanasia will ever desire to do for herself. She abides her time patiently
  where the lot hath been cast for her; in due season, if such be the will of
  the Lord, she shall regain that in truth, of which this is but the
  shadow."</p>

  <p>"God grant our prayer," said Pontius, "and not ours only, but the prayer
  of all that know her, and have heard of this calamity!&mdash;Whatever the
  exertions of her family and their friends can accomplish, most surely shall
  not be awanting. Would that those who are linked to her by ties yet more
  sacred had the power, as they have the will, to serve her! Yet Hope must
  never be rejected. The investigations of this very night may produce the true
  accomplices of Cotilius; and then Trajan will be satisfied that the
  Christians stand guiltless of that treason."</p>

  <p>"Alas!" said I, "if this faith be a crime, how can any one hope to follow
  it without being continually liable to accidents as unfortunate? In Rome, at
  all events, what madness is it thus to tempt the fate which impends over the
  discovery of that which it must be so difficult, so impossible to
  conceal?"</p>

  <p>The aged Priest laid his finger on his lips, and pointed to the window. I
  listened, and heard distinctly the shrill voices of the mutilated dancers, as
  they brake forth above the choral murmurs of the drums and cymbals, and I
  perceived that the bloody legend of Atys was once more the subject of their
  song.</p>

  <p>The ancient waited till the voices were drowned again in the clamour of
  the instruments, and then said to me, "Young man, do you know to what horrid
  story these words of theirs refer? Do you know what sounds all these are
  designed to imitate? Do you know what terror&mdash;what flight&mdash;what
  blood&mdash;what madness are here set forth in honour of a cruel
  demon&mdash;or rather, I should say, for the gain of these miserable and
  maimed hirelings? Do you know all these things, and yet give counsel of
  flight and of cowardice to me, upon whose head the hand of Christ's holy
  apostle hath been laid? Read, dear Valerius, read and ponder well.&mdash;My
  prayers, and the prayers of one that is far purer than me&mdash;they are ever
  with you. But now since I have introduced you to Pontius, why should I delay
  here any longer? He, both for your father's sake and for your own, and for
  that of the faith, (of which you have had some glimpses) will abundantly aid
  you in all things. Deal not coldly nor distantly with him. I commit you into
  his hands, as a brand to be snatched from the burning."</p>

  <p>Pontius reached forth his hand and grasped mine in token of acquiescence
  in all the old man expressed. He, by and by, looking into the street, said,
  "These jugglers have now departed to their dens, and the gaping multitudes
  have dispersed. But I still see one person walking up and down, as if
  expecting somebody; and it seems to me that it is the same, Valerius, who was
  in your company." I perceived that it was indeed Sabinus, whistling to
  himself on the bright side of the pavement. I therefore bade them adieu,
  saying, "Dear father, when shall I see you again, and when shall I hear
  farther of Athanasia?"&mdash;The old man pausing for a moment, said, "To-
  morrow at noontide be in the Forum, over against the statue of Numa. You will
  there find tidings."</p>

  <p>The Centurion plainly intimated that he took it for granted I had been
  engaged in something which I wished to keep from his knowledge; but such
  affairs made no great impression on him; and after laughing out his laugh, he
  bade me farewell by the portico of Licinius.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch303"
     name="ch303">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN the morning I found my kinsman and his son extremely
  uneasy, in consequence of the absence of Xerophrastes, who had not returned
  during the night; but Sabinus came in while they were talking to me, and
  narrated, without hesitation, all he had seen and heard both in the garden of
  Trajan, and at the procession of the Galli. Young Sextus could scarcely be
  restrained by respect for his father, from expressing, rather too openly, his
  satisfaction in the course which the affairs of the disappointed lady
  appeared to be taking; while the orator muttered words which I thought boded
  not much of good to the ambitious pedagogue. The Centurion alone regarded all
  these things as matters of mere amusement, or so at least he seemed to regard
  them; for, as I have already hinted, I was not without my suspicion, that he
  was at bottom by no means well pleased with the contemplation of the future
  splendour of the Stoic.</p>

  <p>However, after many jests had been exchanged between Sextus and the
  Centurion concerning this incongruous amour, Licinius said, he was in so far
  much relieved by what he had heard, as it satisfied him that both the widow
  and Xerophrastes were now otherwise occupied, than in prosecuting their
  designs against the niece of his friend Capito.</p>

  <p>"I myself," he continued, "was all yesterday, as well as the day before,
  exerting every means in my power for her extrication from this unfortunate
  confinement. Cotilius, without question, has indeed been a traitor; but I
  believe the Prince himself is, by this time, well inclined to absolve, not
  only the young lady, but by far the greater part of those who were taken with
  her, from any participation in his traitorous designs. The charge, however,
  of which it rests with them alone to exculpate themselves, is one of a nature
  so serious, that it is impossible to contemplate without much anxiety the
  pain to which so many families&mdash;above all, the noble and excellent
  Sempronii&mdash;may still be exposed. But this day Cotilius will, in all
  likelihood, pay the last penalty of <i>his</i> crimes&mdash;and then we shall
  see what intercession may avail. Would to heaven there were any one who could
  obtain access to the deluded lady, and prevail with her to do that which
  would be more effectual than I can hope any intercession to prove. This
  infatuation&mdash;this dream&mdash;this madness&mdash;is, indeed, a just
  source of fear; and yet, why should we suppose it to be already so deeply
  confirmed in breast young, ingenuous, so full, according to report, of every
  thing modest and submissive? Surely this affectionate girl cannot be
  insensible to the affliction of those who love her. But you still shake your
  head, Valerius; well, it is in our hands to do what we can; as for the issue,
  who can hope to divert Trajan from doing that which he believes to be just?
  Our best hope is in his justice&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And in his clemency," interrupted the Centurion; "you will scarcely
  persuade me that Caesar can meditate any thing serious concerning a young
  beauty, who has been guilty of nothing but a little superstition and
  enthusiasm. Nobody will confound her case with that of any obstinate old
  fanatic. In the meantime, what avails it to distress ourselves more than is
  necessary? Licinius is able to do something; and as for Valerius, the best
  thing he can do is to get on horseback, and go with Sextus and myself to
  inspect the cohorts that have arrived from Calabria."</p>

  <p>Young Sextus, on all occasions fond of military spectacles, embraced this
  proposal; and fain would they both have prevailed on me to accede to it
  likewise. I knew, however, that it would be impossible, if I accompanied
  them, to keep my appointment with the old Christian; and that I was resolved
  on no account to forego. I therefore retired to my chamber, there to await
  the approach of the hour; and spent the time till it drew near, in perusing
  once more the volume which had been restored to me by Athanasia. This volume,
  and the letter which I have before mentioned, I placed together in my bosom,
  before I went forth into the city.</p>

  <p>I entered the Forum, and found it^ as formerly thronged with multitudes of
  busy litigants and idle spectators. A greater concourse, indeed, than was
  usual, crowded not it only, but the avenues to it, and the neighbouring
  streets, by reason of a solemn embassy from the Parthian, which was to have
  audience that day in the Senate. But I, for my part, having discovered the
  statue of Numa Pompilius, resolved to abide by it, lest, being mingled in the
  tumult of the expecting multitudes, I should, by any mischance, escape the
  notice of the old man, who, I doubted not, meant to seek me there in person.
  The time, however, went on&mdash;senator after senator entered the
  temple&mdash;and, at last, the shouts of the people announced that Trajan had
  arrived. And immediately after he had gone in, the pomp of the embassy
  appeared, and every, eye was fixed upon the long line of slaves, laden with
  cloth of gold and rich merchandise, and upon the beautiful troop of
  snow-white horses, which pawed the ground, in magnificent caparisons, before
  the gate of the Senate-house. But while all were intent upon the spectacle, I
  observed a little fair-haired girl standing over against me, who, after
  looking at me for some moments, said with great modesty, "Sir, if you be
  Caius Valerius, I pray you, follow me."</p>

  <p>I followed her in silence up the hanging stairs, and, in a word, had soon
  reached the level of the Capitol, from whence, looking back, I could perceive
  the whole array of the forensic multitudes far below me. The child paused for
  a moment at the summit, and then, still saying nothing, conducted me across
  two magnificent squares, and round about the Temple of Jupiter, until, at
  length, she stopped at one of the side doors of an edifice, which, from the
  manner in which it was guarded, I already suspected to be the Mammertine.</p>

  <p>The girl knocked, and he who kept the gate, saluting her cheerfully,
  allowed us to pass without question into the interior of the prison. My
  companion tripped before me along many passages, till we reached at length a
  chamber which was arranged in such a mariner that I could with difficulty
  believe it to belong to a place of punishment.</p>

  <p>Here I was soon joined by the old priest, (whose name, if I have not
  before mentioned it, was Aurelius Felix,) together with a mild-looking man of
  middle age, whom he desired me to salute as the keeper of the prison, saying,
  "Here, Valerius, is that Silo, of whom yesterday evening you spake with so
  great admiration. But I hope the benevolence of a Christian will ere long
  cease to be an object of so much wonder in your eyes."</p>

  <p>"My father," said the jailer, "methinks you yourself say too much about
  such little things. But, in the meantime, let us ask Valerius if he has heard
  any thing of what has been determined by Caesar."</p>

  <p>I answered by telling what I had just heard from Licinius; upon which the
  countenance of the old man was not a little lightened; but Silo fixed his
  eyes upon the ground, and seemed to regard the matter very seriously. He
  said, however, after a pause, "So far, at least, it is well. Let us hope that
  the calumnies which have been detected, may turn more and more of discredit
  upon those that have gone abroad concerning that which is dearer to you, my
  father, and to all your true companions, than any thing of what men call
  their own. But, alas! these, after all, are but poor tidings for our dear
  young lady."</p>

  <p>"Fear not," answered Aurelius: " have I not told you already oftentimes,
  that strength of heart goes not with bone and sinew, and that my gentle child
  is prepared for all things? She also well knows that the servant is not
  greater than the master."</p>

  <p>The old man motioned to us to remain where we were, and withdrew. I sat
  for some minutes by the side of Silo, who was, indeed, manifestly much
  troubled, until at length the same modest little damsel opened the door, and
  addressing the jailer as her father, asked leave to conduct me to
  Aurelius.</p>

  <p>The child led me, therefore, into the adjoining chamber, and tapped gently
  at a door on the other side of it. The voice of the old priest bade us come
  in, and Athanasia arose with him to receive me. She was dressed in a white
  tunic, her hair braided in dark folds upon her forehead; her countenance was
  calm, and, but for the paleness of her lips, I should have said that her
  gravity scarcely partook of sadness. When, however, we had exchanged our
  salutations, it was evident that some effort had been necessary for this
  appearance of serenity; for when she spoke to me her voice trembled in every
  tone, and, as she stooped to caress my young guide, who had sat down by her
  feet, I saw the tear that had been gathering drop heavily, and lose itself
  among the bright clusters of the little damsel's hair. I took her unresisting
  hand, and imitated as best I could the language of consolation. But it seemed
  as if my poor whispers only served to increase the misery. She covered her
  face with her hands, and sobs and tears were mingled together, and the blood
  glowed red in her neck, in the agony of her lamentation.</p>

  <p>The old priest was moved at first scarcely less than myself by this
  sorrowful sight. Yet the calmness of age deserted him not long, and after a
  moment there remained nothing on his countenance but the gravity and
  tenderness of compassion. He arose from his seat, and walked quietly towards
  the end of the apartment, from which when he returned, after a brief space,
  there was an ancient volume open in his hand. And standing near us, he began
  to read aloud, in the Greek tongue, words which were then new, and which have
  ever since been in a peculiar manner dear to me.</p>

  <p><i>God is our refuge and strength; a very present help in trouble.
  Therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed; though the mountains
  be carried into the midst of the sea; though the waters thereof roar and be
  troubled; though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof.</i></p>

  <p>Athanasia took her hands from her face, and gradually composing herself,
  looked through her tears upon the old man as he proceeded.</p>

  <p><i>There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God;
  the holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High.</i></p>

  <p><i>God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved; God shall help her,
  and that right early.</i></p>

  <p><i>The heathen raged; the kingdoms were moved. He uttered his voice; the
  earth melted.</i></p>

  <p><i>The Lord of Hosts is with us. The God of Jacob is our refuge.</i></p>

  <p>The blood had mounted in the countenance of Aurelius, ere he reached these
  last words. The tears also had been dried up on the pale cheek of Athanasia;
  and although her voice was not heard, I saw that her lips moved fervently
  along with those of the priest. Even in me, ignorant of their source, the
  words of the royal prophet produced I know not what of buoyance and emotion,
  and perhaps my lips, too, had involuntarily essayed to follow them; for when
  he paused from his reading, the old man turned to me with a face full of
  benignity, and said, "Yes, Valerius, it is even so; Homer, Pindar,
  Aeschylus&mdash;these, indeed, can stir the blood; but it is such poetry as
  this that alone can sooth in sorrow, and strengthen in the hour of
  tribulation. Your vainglorious Greeks called all men barbarians but
  themselves; and yet these words, and thousands not less precious than these,
  consoled the afflictions, and ennobled the triumphs of the chosen race of
  Israel long, long years, ere ever the boasted melody of Ionian or Doric verse
  had been heard of. From this alone, young man, you may judge what measure of
  candour inhabits along with the disdain of our proud enemies:&mdash;how
  fairly, without question, or opportunity of defence, the charge of barbarity
  is heaped upon what they are pleased to call our
  <i>superstition</i>;&mdash;how wisely the learned and the powerful of the
  earth have combined in this league against the truth which they know
  not,&mdash;of which they fear or despise the knowledge. Surely the truth is
  mighty, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against her."</p>

  <p>"But, alas! my dear father," said Athanasia, "I fear me this is not the
  place, nor the situation, in which Valerius might be most likely to listen to
  your words. It may be that his own narrow escape, to say nothing of our
  present danger, has rendered him even more cautious than he was before."</p>

  <p>"And who, my dear child," he replied hastily,&mdash;"and who is he that
  shall dare to blame caution, or to preach, above all in such things as these,
  the rashness that is of folly? Valerius will not believe that we, like the
  miserable creatures whose impious songs he heard last night, are studious
  only of working upon the fears of the ignorant, and harassing, with dark and
  lying dreams, the imaginations of the simple. <i>Here</i> are no wild stories
  of blood- thirsty deities, and self-sacrificing maniacs. <i>Here</i> is that
  which Socrates vainly sought by all the ingenuity of reason. <i>Here</i> is
  that of which some faint and mysterious anticipations would appear to have
  been shadowed forth in the visions of Plato. <i>Here</i> is that which, as
  that Mighty Martyr who died in this very city hath said, innumerable prophets
  and kings of the old time desired to see, and yet saw not. Do nothing rashly,
  young man; but it is possible, as you yourself well know, that this may be
  the last opportunity I shall ever have of speaking with you; and therefore,
  before we part, I must needs charge you solemnly, that henceforth, if your
  knowledge increase not, the sin shall be upon your head. I charge you,
  Valerius, that when you return to your island, you blot not from your memory
  the things that you have seen and heard in this great city of light and of
  darkness. Examine&mdash;judge&mdash;ask aid, and aid shall not be refused
  you. I take Athanasia to witness, that I have given you the warning that is
  needful."</p>

  <p>"Oh, sir!" said Athanasia, "I am sure it shall not be in vain that you
  have done so. I am sure Valerius will never forget this hour&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She gazed in my face, and a tear was again visible, yet on all her
  countenance there was no other semblance of passion. The venerable Aurelius
  clasping his thin hands together, whispered,&mdash;"Would to God that I were
  here alone! Shall the axe be laid to the root of the fair young tree that
  hath but begun to blossom when so many old trunks stand around withered with
  the lightnings, and sore broken by the winds?&mdash;The will of the Lord be
  done!"</p>

  <p>"Amen!" said Athanasia, taking the old man by the hand, and smiling, I
  think, more cheerfully than I had yet seen her&mdash;"My dear father, I fear
  you yourself, after all, are teaching Valerius to take but a sad farewell of
  us."</p>

  <p>"Alas! my child," he replied, "he must have a hard heart that could look
  unmoved on that sweet face in this hour of sadness. But we are in the hands
  of a greater than Trajan. If so it please Him, all may yet go well with us
  even here upon the earth. You may live to see many happy years among your
  kindred&mdash;and I, (the old man smiled most serenely,) and for me, my gray
  hairs may be laid in bloodless dust. Whatever awaits us, blessed be the name
  of the Lord!"</p>

  <p>So saying, the old man retired from the chamber, and once more I was left
  alone in the presence of Athanasia. I took from my bosom the book and the
  letter which I had placed there, and laid them upon her knee. She broke the
  seal, and read hastily what Tisias had written, and then concealed the scroll
  within her tunic, saying, "Alas! Valerius, little did the brave old soldier
  suspect how soon his peril was to be mine&mdash;Will you permit me like him
  to make you my messenger? will you seek out my cousin, my sister, and tell
  Sempronia in what condition you have found me?&mdash;no, not in what you
  found&mdash;but in what you now see me. Will you go, Valerius, and speak
  comfort to my poor friend? Her pity, at least, I am sure is mingled with no
  angry thoughts; and yet she only has reason to complain, for her secret
  thoughts were not hid from me, and, alas! I concealed mine from her."</p>

  <p>"I have already seen her," said I, "and you do her no more than justice.
  But, indeed, Sempronius himself thinks of you even as gently as his
  daughter."</p>

  <p>"I doubt it not, Valerius; but, alas! there are many others besides these;
  and I know not what relic of weakness it is, but methinks I could have borne
  the worst more easily, had it not been for what I picture to myself of their
  resentment. Alas! I am cut off for ever from the memory of my kindred." She
  threw open the lattice, as if that she might inhale the free air, and her
  eyes wandered to and fro over all the magnificent prospect that lay stretched
  out below us,&mdash;the temples and high porticos of the Forum, the gleaming
  battlements and long arcades of the Palatine, the baths, and theatres, and
  circuses between and the river Tiber winding away among fields and groves and
  the sky of Italy extending over all things its arch of splendour. When the
  trumpets were blown by the gate of the Senate-house, the sound floated
  upwards to us as gently as if it had been borne over the waters. The shouts
  of the multitude were faintly re-echoed from the towers and the rocks. The
  princely pageant showed like a pomp of pygmies; spear, and helmet, and eagle
  glittered together, almost like dews upon the distant herbage. Athanasia
  rested her eye once more upon the wide range of the champaign, where fields
  and forests were spread out in interminable succession away towards the
  northern region and the visible mountains. She raised her hand, and said,
  "Valerius, your home lies far away yonder. I must give you something which
  you shall promise me to carry with you, and preserve in memory of Rome."</p>

  <p>Before I had time to make any answer, she had taken out of a casket that
  stood beside us, a scroll of parchment, bound with a silk ribbon, which she
  immediately put into my hands, and "To-morrow," said she, "Valerius, our
  fate, they tell us, must at length be determined; if we share the fate of
  Tisias, the last gift of Tisias shall be yours. If, however, any mercy be
  extended to us, I cannot part with that memorial of a dying martyr. I must
  keep to myself the old man's favourite volume, for it was for me he had
  designed it. ,But I have made a copy of the same book for yourself. I have
  written it since I came hither, Valerius, and you must not despise it because
  the Mammertine has not furnished the finest of materials. Take this,
  Valerius, and take with it my thanks my prayers. I know you will not forget
  my message to my dear sister. Sextus and she may many happy days be theirs
  and yours."</p>

  <p>I kissed the sad gift, and placed it in my bosom.</p>

  <p>"Valerius," she said, "dry up your tears. You weep for me because I am a
  Christian; forget not that the Roman blood flows in my veins, and think not
  that its current is chilled, because I have forsworn the worship of idol and
  demon, and am in peril for the service of The Living God."</p>

  <p>"Athanasia!" said I, "I weep for you, but not for you alone. I ask nothing
  I hope nothing but I could not bear to part with you thus, and not to tell
  you that when I part from you, I bid farewell to all&mdash;things. Pardon me
  once more pardon me."</p>

  <p>A single flush of crimson passed over her face, and I saw her lips move,
  but the syllables died ere they were uttered. She continued for a moment
  gazing on me, pale, and trembling; and then at last she fell upon my neck and
  wept&mdash;not audibly&mdash;but I felt her tears.</p>

  <p>Athanasia was still folded to my bosom in that strange agony of sorrow and
  of confidence, when Silo, the jailer, entered the apartment, abrupt and
  breathless.</p>

  <p>"Oh, sir!" said he, "your sufferings are mine&mdash;but it is necessary
  that you should leave us, and on the instant, for the Prefect is already at
  the gate, and unquestionably he will examine every part of the prison; and
  should you be recognized as the person who was taken in the Mausoleum, you
  see plainly to what suspicions it might give rise. Come then, sir, and let me
  secure your escape&mdash;we shall take care to warn you of whatever occurs,
  and we shall send for you, if there be opportunity."</p>

  <p>Athanasia recovered herself almost instantly, when she heard what Silo
  said.</p>

  <p>"We shall meet again," said I.</p>

  <p>"Once more," she replied&mdash;"at least once more, Valerius."</p>

  <p>And I tore myself away from her; and the jailer having once again
  committed me to the guidance of his child, I was in a few moments conducted
  to the same postern by which I had been introduced. In a word, I found myself
  in the court of the Capitol, at the instant when the Prefect, with all his
  attendants, was entering by the main gate of the Mammertine.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch304"
     name="ch304">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ON reaching home, I was told that Licinius was still absent;
  and found at the same time a billet upon the table, which informed me that
  Sabinus had carried Sextus with him to his quarters, and that both expected I
  would join them there immediately upon my return. I knew not how to refuse
  compliance, and yet I could not bear the thought of being so far from the
  Capito, in case of any message being sent to me from the prison. Since I
  could do no better, however, I charged Boto to remain in my apartment till
  sunset, and bring me, without delay, any letter or messenger that might
  arrive in my absence. Should none such appear within that space, I gave him a
  note, which I desired him to deliver into the hands of Silo; and having, as I
  thought, furnished him with sufficient directions how to discharge this
  commission, I myself took the path to the Praetorian Camp, where I thought it
  very probable that I might gather some new intelligence as to Cotilius.</p>

  <p>The Praetorian who had accompanied Sabinus at my release from the rustic
  tower, recognized me at the gate, and conducted me immediately to the
  Centurion, who, to my surprise and displeasure, had directed that I should be
  ushered without delay to, not his own apartment, but the general table. Here
  I was received most courteously, however, and hoping the feast was nearly
  over, took my place near my friend.</p>

  <p>Several of those high-fed warriors who had more than once disposed of the
  empire, were reclining upon rich couches around the board; and their
  effeminate exterior would, perhaps, have made them less formidable in my
  eyes, had I not remembered the youth of the great Caesar, the Parthian
  retreat of Antony, and the recent death of Otho.* There were present,
  besides, a few casual visitors like ourselves; among others, a sleek Flamen,
  who reclined on the right hand of the presiding Tribune, and a little bald
  Greek, who seemed to think it incumbent upon himself to fill up every pause
  in the conversation, by malicious anecdotes or sarcasms, of which last it was
  easy to see that the Flamen opposite was a favourite subject. Neither wit nor
  impiety, however, could make speedy impression upon the smooth-faced Flamen,
  who seemed to think, if one might judge from his behaviour, that the most
  acceptable service he could render to the deities, was to do full and devout
  justice to the gifts of their benevolence.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* ... Catonem/ Novisti moriens vincere, mollis Otho.
  ]</p>

  <p>A very animated discussion concerning the review of the newly-arrived
  cohorts, (which, I have told you, had taken place that morning by the river
  side,) relieved for some time the patient Flamen from the attacks of this
  irreverent person, and engaged the zealous participation of those who had
  hitherto been the most silent of the company. Sabinus, among the rest, was
  ready with a world of remarks upon the equipments, the manoeuvres, the
  merits, and the demerits of the troops in question; but something he said was
  quite at variance with the sentiments of one of his brother Centurions, who
  disputed with him rather warmly than successfully for a few moments, and at
  last ended with saying,&mdash;"But why should I take so much trouble to
  discuss the point with you, who, we all know, were thinking of other matters,
  and saw not much more of the review than if you had been a hundred miles off
  from it?"</p>

  <p>The Centurion coloured a little, and laughed, as it seemed to me, with
  rather less heartiness than usual; but the disputant pursuing his advantage,
  said, "Yes, you may laugh if you will; but do you think we are all blind, or
  do you suppose we are not acquainted with certain particulars? Well, some
  people dislike the Suburra, but for my part I agree with Sabinus; I think it
  is one of the genteelest places in Rome, and, that there are some of the
  snuggest houses in it too&mdash;and if old men will die, for me, I protest, I
  don't see why young men should not succeed them." The Centurion laughed
  again, and natural ruddiness of complexion was, I thought, scarcely quite
  sufficient to account for the flush on his countenance, as he listened to
  these innuendos. But the master of the feast cut the matter short, by saying
  that he had a health to propose, and that he expected all present should
  receive it with honour.&mdash;"Here," said he, "is to the fair lady Rubellia,
  who is never absent when the Praetorians turn out, and may all things fair
  and fortunate attend her now and hereafter." I whispered to
  Sabinus,&mdash;"My friend, I think you have really some reason for blushing.
  If you had no pity on Xerophrastes, you might at least have had some for the
  pretty widow."</p>

  <p>He made no answer to this, and looked, if possible, more confused than
  ever; but, just at that moment, a soldier came in, and delivered a billet to
  the presiding Tribune, who handed it to Sabinus immediately after he had read
  it, and said, loud enough to be heard by all those who sat near him, "I wish
  the Prince would give some of this work to these new comers. But, indeed, I
  wonder what Lictors are good for now-a-days; but every thing that these
  Christians are any way concerned in seems to be a matter of importance."</p>

  <p>Sabinus, having read the billet, handed it back again to the Tribune, and
  said aloud, "<i>Exit</i> Cotilius!&mdash;Who would not be of the chorus at
  the falling of that curtain?"</p>

  <p>The Tribune shrugged his shoulders, whispered something into the ear of
  the messenger, and then, dashing more wine into his cup, said, "Rome will
  never be a quiet place, nor the Praetorian helmet a comfortable head-piece,
  till these barbarians be extirpated."</p>

  <p>The Flamen tossed off a full goblet, and, smiting with his hand upon the
  table, said, "There spake a true Roman, and a worshipper of the Gods. I
  rejoice to find that there is still some religion in the world; for, what
  with skulking Jews on the one hand, and bold blasphemous Cyrenaeans on the
  other, so help me Jupiter, the general prospect is dark enough!"</p>

  <p>"In my opinion," quoth the bald Greek, putting on an air of some gravity,
  "the Jews will have the better of the Cyrenaeans. Indeed, I should not be
  much surprised to see this Christian superstition supplant every other." The
  Flamen half started from his couch. "You observe, gentlemen," proceeded the
  Greek, "what great advantage any new superstition has over any thing of the
  same sort that is old. We all know, for example, that Isis and Cybele have
  for many years past left comparatively few worshippers to Mars,
  Apollo,&mdash;even to Jupiter. It is lamentable; but it is true. I have heard
  that unless on some very great day, a gift is now quite a rarity upon the
  altar of any of the true ancient deities of Rome. Egypt and Mount Ida have
  done this; and why should not Palestine succeed as well as either? In the
  meantime, the enlightened contemplate every different manifestation of the
  superstitious principle with equal indifference; and, I confess to you, I
  have been a little surprised to perceive how far Trajan is from imitating
  their example. But that Chaeronsean master of his, that Plutarch, was always
  an old woman; and I fear the Prince has not been able to shake off the
  impression of his ridiculous stories."</p>

  <p>"Hush!" quoth the master of the day, "if it please you, nothing can be
  said here against either Trajan or his friends; and, as for Plutarch, he was
  one of the pleasantest fellows that I ever met with."</p>

  <p>Sabinus, desirous of restoring the harmony of the assembly, called
  forthwith on a musical senior, to join him in a song. The gentleman required
  solicitation, but at last announced his consent to attempt the female part in
  the duet of Horace and Lydia. Sabinus, always ready, began to roar out the
  tender words of regret and expostulation which the most elegant of poets has
  ascribed to himself; and the delicate squeaking response of our wrinkled
  Lydia formed an agreeable contrast.</p>

  <p>All, in short, were once more in perfect good humour,, when another
  soldier appeared behind the couch of the president, and handed to him what
  seemed to be another billet of the same complexion. He tossed the paper
  before to my friend, who looked very serious as he read it.&mdash;"Caius," he
  whispered, "an additional guard is ordered to the Palatine&mdash;and the
  reason is said to be that the rest of the Christian prisoners are to be
  examined, within an hour, by the Emperor himself."</p>

  <p>I had scarcely had a moment to compose myself, when one of the slaves in
  attendance signified that a person wished to speak with me in the
  ante-chamber. It was Dromo.&mdash;"Sir," said he, "I have no time for
  explanation. Silo wishes to see you&mdash;I left Boto with him at the
  Mammertine."</p>

  <p>As we walked from the camp, Sabinus, with his guard, passed without
  noticing me; and I received some explanations which I must give to you very
  briefly. Boto, mistrusting his recollection of my instructions, had requested
  Dromo to assist him in finding his way to the Mammertine; and the Cretan had
  come to be witness of a scene, which, in spite of his sarcastic disposition,
  he could not narrate without tokens of sympathy. I mentioned to you that my
  faithful slave, in coming with me to Rome, had indulged the hope of meeting
  once more with a brother, who many years before had been carried off from
  Britain. I smiled when the poor man expressed confidence that he should find
  out this ere he had been many days in the metropolis of the world. But now,
  in truth, a fortunate accident had recompensed much ill-regulated search. He
  had found his brother, and he had found him in the Mammertine. That very
  brother was Silo, to whose kindness I, and one dearer than myself, had been
  so deeply indebted. The Cretan, himself a slave and an exile, had partaken in
  the feelings of the long-lost brothers, and hastened to bring me from the
  camp, that Boto might be spared the pain of immediately parting from
  Silo.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch305"
     name="ch305">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I HAD hurried along the darkening streets, and up the ascent
  of the Capitoline, scarce listening to the story of the Cretan. On reaching
  the summit, we found the courts about the Temple of Jupiter already occupied
  by detachments of foot. I hastened to the Mammertine&mdash;and before the
  postern opened to admit us, the Praetorian squadron had drawn up at the great
  gate. Sabinus beckoned me to him. "Caius," said he, stooping on his horse,
  "would to heaven I had been spared this duty! Cotilius comes forth this
  moment, and then we go back to the Palatine; and I fear&mdash;I fear we are
  to guard thither your Athanasia. If you wish to enter the prison, quicken
  your steps."</p>

  <p>We had scarcely entered the inner-court, ere Sabinus also, and about a
  score of his Praetorians, rode into it. Silo and Boto were standing together;
  and both had already hastened towards me; but the jailer, seeing the
  Centurion, was constrained to part from me with one hurried word: "Pity me,
  for I also am most wretched. But you know the way&mdash;here, take this
  key&mdash;hasten to my dear lady, and tell her what commands have come."</p>

  <p>Alas! said I to myself, of what tidings am I doomed ever to be the
  messenger!&mdash;but she was alone; and how could I shrink from any pain that
  might perhaps alleviate hers? I took the key, glided along the corridors, and
  stood once more at the door of the chamber in which I had parted from
  Athanasia. No voice answered to my knock; I repeated it three times, and
  then, agitated with indistinct apprehension, hesitated no longer to open it.
  No lamp was burning within the chamber, but from without there entered a
  wavering glare of deep saffron-coloured light, which showed me Athanasia
  extended on her couch. Its ominous and troubled hue had no power to mar the
  image of her sleeping tranquillity. I hung over her for a moment, and was
  about to disturb that slumber&mdash;perhaps the last slumber of peace and
  innocence&mdash;when the chamber-walls were visited with a yet deeper glare.
  "Caius," she whispered, as I stepped from beside the couch; "why do you leave
  me? stay, Valerius." I looked back, but her eye-lids were still closed; the
  same calm smile was upon her dreaming lips. The light streamed redder and
  more red. All in an instant became as quiet without as within. I approached
  the window, and saw Cotilius standing in the midst of the court; Sabinus and
  Silo near him; the horsemen drawn up on either side, and a soldier close
  behind resting upon an unsheathed sword. I saw the keen blue eye as fierce as
  ever. I saw that the blood was still fervid in his cheeks: for the complexion
  of this man was of the same bold and florid brightness so uncommon in Italy,
  which you have seen represented in the pictures of Sylla, and even the blaze
  of the torches seemed to strive in vain to heighten its natural scarlet. The
  soldier had lifted his sword, and my eye was fixed, as by fascination, when
  suddenly a deep voice was heard amidst the deadly
  silence&mdash;"Cotilius!&mdash;look up, Cotilius!"</p>

  <p>Aurelius, the Christian priest, standing at an open window, not far
  distant from that at which I was placed, stretched forth his fettered hand as
  he spake:&mdash;"Cotilius! I charge thee, look upon the hand from which the
  blessed water of baptism was cast upon thy head. I charge thee, look upon me,
  and say, ere yet the blow be given, upon what hope thy thoughts are
  fixed?&mdash;Is this sword bared against the rebel of Caesar, or a martyr of
  Jesus?&mdash;I charge thee, speak; and for thy soul's sake speak truly."</p>

  <p>A bitter motion of derision passed over his lips, and he nodded, as if
  impatiently, to the Praetorian. Instinctively I turned me from the spectacle,
  and my eye rested again upon the couch of Athanasia but not upon the vision
  of her tranquillity. The clap with which the corpse fell upon the stones had,
  perhaps, reached the sleeping ear, and we know with what swiftness thoughts
  chase thoughts in the wilderness of dreams. So it was that she started at the
  very moment when the blow was given; and she whispered&mdash;for it was still
  but a deep whisper&mdash;"Spare me, Trajan, Caesar, Prince&mdash;have pity on
  my youth&mdash;strengthen, strengthen me good Lord! Fie! fie! we must not lie
  to save life. Felix&mdash;Valerius&mdash;come close to me, Caius&mdash;Fie!
  let us remember we are Romans&mdash;'Tis the trumpet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Praetorian trumpet sounded the march in the court below, and
  Athanasia, starting from her sleep, gazed wildly around the reddened chamber.
  The blast of the trumpet was indeed in her ear&mdash;and Valerius hung over
  her&mdash;but after a moment the cloud of the broken dream passed away, and
  the maiden smiled as she extended her hand to me from the couch, and began to
  gather up the ringlets that floated all down upon her shoulder. She blushed
  and smiled mournfully, and asked me hastily whence I came, and for what
  purpose I had come; but before I could answer, the glare that was yet in the
  chamber seemed anew to be perplexing her: and she gazed from me to the red
  walls, and from them to me again: and then once more the trumpet was blown,
  and Athanasia sprung from her couch. I know not in what terms I was essaying
  to tell her what was the truth, but I know that ere I had said many words,
  she discovered my meaning. For a moment she looked deadly pale, in spite of
  all the glare of the torch-beams; but she recovered herself, and said in a
  voice that sounded almost as if it came from a light heart,&mdash;"But Caius,
  I must not go to Caesar, without having at least a garland on my head. Stay
  here, Valerius, and I shall be ready anon&mdash;quite ready."</p>

  <p>It seemed to me as if she were less hasty than she had promised, yet many
  minutes elapsed not ere she returned. She plucked a blossom from her hair as
  she drew near to me, and said, "Take it: you must not refuse one token more;
  this also is a sacred gift. Caius, you must learn never to look upon it
  without kissing these red streaks these blessed streaks of the Christian
  flower."</p>

  <p>I took the flower from her hand, and pressed it to my lips; and I
  remembered that the very first day I saw Athanasia, she had plucked such an
  one, when apart from all the rest, in the gardens of Capito. I told her what
  I remembered; and it seemed as if the little circumstance had called up all
  the image of peaceful days; for once more sorrowfulness gathered upon her
  countenance. If the tear was ready, however, it was not permitted to drop;
  and Athanasia returned again to her flower.</p>

  <p>"Do you think there are any of them in Britain?" said she; "or do you
  think that they would grow there? You must go to my dear uncle, and he will
  not deny you, when you tell him that it is for my sake he is to give you some
  of his. They call it the Passion-flower&mdash;'tis an emblem of an awful
  thing. Caius, these purple streaks are like trickling drops; and here, look
  ye, they are all round the flower. Is it not very like a bloody crown upon a
  pale brow? I will take one of them in my hand, too, Caius; and methinks I
  shall not disgrace myself when I look upon it, even though Trajan should be
  frowning upon me."</p>

  <p>I had not the heart to interrupt her; but heard silently all she said, and
  I thought she said the words quickly and eagerly, as if she feared to be
  interrupted.</p>

  <p>The old priest came into the chamber while she was yet speaking so, and
  said very composedly, "Come, my dear child, our friend has sent again for us,
  and the soldiers have been waiting already some space, who are to convey us
  to the Palatine. Come, children, we must part for a moment&mdash;perhaps it
  may be but for a moment&mdash;and Valerius may remain here till we return to
  him. Here, at least, dear Caius, you shall have the earliest tidings, and the
  surest."</p>

  <p>The good man took Athanasia by the hand, and she, smiling now at length
  more serenely than ever, said only, "Farewell, then, Caius, for a little
  moment!" And so, drawing her veil over her face, she passed away from before
  me, giving, I think, more support to the ancient Aurelius than, in her turn,
  she received from him. I began to follow them, but the priest waved his hand
  as if to forbid me:&mdash;the door closed after them, And I was alone.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch306"
     name="ch306">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I KNOW not, my friends, how to proceed with the narrative of
  what followed. Thoughts, passions, fears, hopes, succeeding so rapidly, give
  to that strange night, when I look back upon it through the vista of years,
  the likeness of some incoherent, agonizing dream. Much, without doubt, of
  what passed within my own mind I have forgotten; but it seems to me as if
  what I saw or heard were still present in the distinctness of reality. That
  chamber in the Mammertine! Its walls are before me blazing with the
  reflection of torch-light, and then again, all dim and shadowy&mdash;the
  stars shining feebly upon them from the twilight sky&mdash;everything around
  lonely and silent, except the voice of Silo's little maiden,&mdash;bewailing
  no doubt in her privacy the departure of Athanasia.</p>

  <p>Her father after a little time rejoined me. "Sir," said he, "all is now
  quiet here; will you walk with me towards the Palatine, that we may at least
  be near to know what is reported of their proceedings? My brother will stay
  here till we return."</p>

  <p>We soon had descended from the Capitoline, passed through the silent
  Forum, and gained the brow of the opposite eminence, where, as shortly before
  at the Mammertine, all was light and tumult. Every court was guarded with
  soldiery, and groups of busy men were passing continually about the imperial
  gates and porticos. Silo led me round and round the buildings, till we
  reached what seemed an abandoned wing. "Sir," said he, "you do not know more
  familiarly the house in which you were born and reared, than I do every
  corner within these wide walls. But I have not crossed the threshold since
  the day Caesar died.&mdash;I was the slave of Domitian, and he gave me my
  freedom.&mdash;He was kind to his household."</p>

  <p>We entered beneath a small portico and Silo drew a key from his bosom. The
  lock, after two or three trials, yielded to its pressure. A large empty hall
  received us, the circumference of which was scarcely visible by the light of
  the newly-risen moon, streaming down from a cupola.</p>

  <p>Another and another sombre chamber we in like manner traversed, till at
  length Silo opened one so comparatively light, that I started back,
  apprehending we had intruded farther than he intended. A second glance,
  however, seemed to indicate that we were still in the region of desolation,
  for a statue lay in the midst of the floor, one of its limbs snapped over, as
  if it had fallen and been permitted to remain.</p>

  <p>"Where are we, Silo?" I whispered, "what means this unnatural light among
  so many symptoms of confusion?"</p>

  <p>"Sir," said the freedman, "this is the place in which alone Domitian used
  to eat and sleep, and walk about for the last months of his life, when he was
  jealous of all men; and he contrived these walls, covered all over with the
  shining Ethiopian stone, that no one might be able to approach him without
  being discovered. Even when a slave entered, he would start as if every side
  of the chamber had been invaded by some host of men; fifty different
  reflections of one trembling eunuch. It was, they say, behind this shattered
  piece of marble that he ran when he had felt the first treacherous blow.
  Yonder in the corner is the couch he slept upon, and he had always a dagger
  under his head, and he called to the little page that was waiting upon him to
  fetch it from the place; but the scabbard only remained; and then in came
  Parthenius and Claudianus, and the gladiator, and the rest, who soon finished
  what the cunning Stephanus had begun. Let us go on;&mdash;we have not yet
  reached the place to which I wished to bring you&mdash;but it is not far off
  now."</p>

  <p>With this Silo walked to the end of the melancholy chamber, and pressing
  upon a secret spring, where no door was apparent, opened the way into a room,
  darker and smaller than any of those through which we had come. He then said
  to me, "Now, sir, you must not venture upon one whisper more&mdash;you touch
  on the very heart of Domitian's privacy. It is possible that the place I have
  been leading you to may have been shut up&mdash;it may exist no longer; but
  the state in which all things are found here makes me think it more likely
  that Trajan has never been master of its secret. And in that case, we shall
  be able both to see and to hear, without being either seen or heard, exactly
  as Domitian used to do, when there was any council held either in the Mars or
  the Apollo."</p>

  <p>I started at the boldness of the project which now, for the first time, I
  understood; but Silo laid his finger on his lip again, cautiously lifted up a
  piece of the dark-red cloth with which this chamber was hung, and essayed
  another spring in the panelling beneath. Total darkness appeared to be
  beyond; but the jailer motioning to me to remain for a moment where I was,
  and to keep up the hanging, glided boldly into the recess. I wondered how he
  should tread so lightly, that I could not perceive the least echo; but this
  no longer surprised me, when I had the sign to follow. The floor felt beneath
  my foot as if it were stuffed like a pillow; and, after I had dropped the
  hanging, every thing was totally dark, as it had at first appeared to me,
  except only at certain points, separate and aloft, which let in gleams of
  light, manifestly artificial. Silo, taking hold of me by the hand, conducted
  me up some steps towards the nearest of these tiny apertures; and, as I
  approached it, I heard distinctly the voices of persons talking together in
  the room beyond. I did not draw my breath, you may well believe, with much
  boldness; but my eye was soon" fixed at one of the crevices, and, after the
  first dazzle was over, I saw clearly. Silo took his station by my side,
  gazing through another of these loop- holes, which, that you may understand
  every thing, were evidently quite concealed among the rich carved-work of an
  ivory cornice.</p>

  <p>The chamber was lighted by three tall candelabra of silver, close beside
  one of which was placed a long table covered with an infinity of scrolls and
  tablets. One person, who had his back turned towards us, was writing, and two
  others, in one of whom I instantly recognized the Emperor, were walking up
  and down on the other side.</p>

  <p>"No, Palma," said Trajan, for it was that old favourite whom he
  addressed&mdash;"I have made up my mind as to this matter. I shall never
  permit any curious inquisition as to private opinion. Every man has a right,
  without question, to think&mdash;to believe&mdash;exactly what pleases him;
  and I shall concede as much in favour of every woman, Palma, if you will have
  it so. But it is totally a different affair, when the fact, no matter how, is
  forced upon my knowledge, that a subject, no matter who or what he be&mdash;a
  subject of the Roman empire, refuses to comply with the first, the elemental,
  and the most essential of the laws. The man&mdash;aye or the woman&mdash;that
  confesses in my presence contempt for the deities whom the commonwealth
  acknowledges in every step of its procedure&mdash;that person is a criminal;
  and I cannot dismiss him unpunished, without injuring the commonwealth by the
  display of weakness in its chief. As for these poor fanatics themselves, it
  is the penalty of my station that I must control my feelings."</p>

  <p>"But you are satisfied, my lord," said Palma, "that these people are quite
  innocent as to Cotilius's designs; and as it was upon that suspicion they
  were apprehended, perhaps it may be possible&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Palma," interrupted the Prince; "quite possible and quite easy,
  provided they will condescend to save themselves by the most trivial
  acknowledgment of the sort which, I repeat to you, I do and must consider as
  absolutely necessary. And women too&mdash;and girls forsooth&mdash;I suppose
  you would have me wait till the very urchins on the street were gathering
  into knots to discuss the nature of the Gods.&mdash;Do you remember what
  Plato says?"</p>

  <p>"No, my lord, I do not know to what you refer."</p>

  <p>"Why, Plato says that nobody can ever understand any thing accurately
  about the Deity, and that, if he could, he would have no right to communicate
  his discoveries to others; the passage is in the Timaeus, and Tully has
  translated it besides. And is it to be endured that these modest fanatics are
  to do every hour what the Platos and the Ciceros spoke of in such terms as
  these? I think you carry your tolerance a little farther than might have been
  expected from a disciple of the Academy."</p>

  <p>"I despise them, my lord, as much as yourself; but, to tell you the truth,
  it is this young lady that moves me to speak thus&mdash;and I crave your
  pardon, if I have spoken with too much freedom.&mdash;Her father was one of
  the best soldiers Titus had."</p>

  <p>"The more is the pity, Palma. Have you ever seen the girl yourself? Did
  you give orders that she should be brought hither? I have not the least
  objection that you should have half an hour, or an hour if you will, to talk
  with her quietly; perhaps your eloquence may have the effect we desire."</p>

  <p>"I doubt it, my lord, I greatly doubt it," he replied; "but, indeed, I
  know not whether she be yet here&mdash;Did you not send to the
  Mammertine?"</p>

  <p>The man writing at the table, to whom this interrogation was addressed,
  said, "I believe, sir, both this lady and the old man that was in the same
  prison arc now in attendance." And upon this Trajan and Palma retired
  together towards the farther end of the apartment, where they conversed for
  some minutes in a tone so low, that I could not understand any thing. of
  what, was said. Trajan at length turned from his favourite with an air, as I
  thought, of some little displeasure, and said aloud, coming back into the
  middle of the room,&mdash;"I know it is so; but what is that to the affair in
  hand? I am very sorry for the Sempronii, but I doubt if even they would be so
  unreasonable as you are."</p>

  <p>"Will you not see the poor girl yourself, Caesar."</p>

  <p>"You do not need to be told, that my seeing her would only make it more
  difficult for me to do that, which, seeing or not seeing her, I know to be my
  duty. Do you accept of my proposal? Are you willing to try the effect of your
  own persuasion? I promise you, if you succeed, I shall rejoice not less
  heartily than yourself; but it is rather too much to imagine that I am
  personally to interfere about such an affair as this an affair which, the
  more I think of it, seems to me to be the more perfectly contemptible. Nay,
  do not suppose it is this poor girl I am talking of&mdash;I mean the whole of
  this Jewish, this Christian affair, which does indeed appear to me to be the
  most bare-faced absurdity, that ever was permitted to disturb the
  tranquillity of the empire. A mean and savage nation have but just suffered
  the penalty of obstinacy and treachery alike unequalled, and from
  them&mdash;from the scattered embers of this extinguished fire, we are to
  allow a new flame to be kindled&mdash;ay, and that in the very centre of
  Rome. I tell you, that if my own hand were to be scorched in the cause, I
  would disperse this combustion to the winds of heaven; I tell you, that I
  stand here, Caesar, and that I would rather be chained to the oar, than
  suffer, while the power to prevent it is mine, the tiniest speck to be thrown
  upon the Roman majesty. By all the Gods, Palm a, it is enough to make a man
  sick to think of the madness that is in this world, and of the iron arguments
  by which we are compelled to keep those from harming us, that at first sight
  of them excite no feeling but our pity. But I am weary of these very names of
  Palestine&mdash;Jew&mdash;Christian. Go to this foolish girl, and try what
  you can make of her; I give you fair warning no breeders of young Christians
  here."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch307"
     name="ch307">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">CORNELIUS PALMA, after the Prince retired, was apparently
  for some space busied with his reflections. He then talked in a whispering
  manner with the secretary, and moved towards an extremity of the chamber. But
  the moment Silo perceived this, he plucked my sleeve, and drew me to the
  other end of our closet, where, as I have told you, the light had admittance
  in a similar manner. Here another of the imperial apartments was visible in
  equal distinctness; and in it appeared Athanasia and her friend, as waiting
  now at length in entire composure the moment when they should be
  summoned.</p>

  <p>Palma entering, both rose, and he, returning their salutation, remained
  before them for a moment in silence, his eyes fixed on Athanasia. It was to
  Aurelius, nevertheless, that his first words were addressed:&mdash;"From what
  has been reported of your behaviour at the execution of Cotilius, I fear
  there is nothing to be gained by speaking to you, concerning the only means
  by which your own safety can yet be secured. You are obstinate, old man, in
  your superstition?"&mdash;"Noble Palma," said the priest, "contempt is the
  only thing I fear from men. But I thank my God, that it is the only thing I
  have it in my power to avoid."&mdash;"I will not argue with you," answered
  Palma, pointing to a door near him: "It was not with any purpose of bending
  you, that I undertook this painful office. I desire to speak in freedom with
  one whose case is, I trust, less hopeless."</p>

  <p>The old man, pointing to his fetters, said meekly, w m Let them guard me
  whither it pleases you."</p>

  <p>"Sir," said Athanasia, "I pray you let Aurelius remain; imagine not that I
  shall either hear or answer less freely because of my friend's presence."</p>

  <p>"He will, at least, retire to the other end of the chamber," said
  Palma&mdash;"and interfere no farther."</p>

  <p>The priest drew back; Athanasia, on her part, seeing that Palma hesitated,
  and seemed at a loss how to begin, said to him in a tone of modest
  composure:&mdash;"Noble sir, if your purpose be indeed as kind as I think it
  is, I pray you spare me at least the pain that is needless, and spare
  yourself what I am sure is painful to you. You see my youth and my sex, and
  it is not unnatural for you to think as you do; but know that my faith is
  fixed, and that I hope I shall not be deserted, when I strive even at the
  last moment to do it no dishonour."</p>

  <p>"This gray beard," said Palma, "has made you, then, thoroughly a
  Christian?"</p>

  <p>"I would it were so," she answered&mdash;"I would to God it were so!"</p>

  <p>"Lady," resumed Palma, "we have knowledge both of your father's high
  character, and of your own amiable dispositions. If you persist in this
  manner, you will give grief to Caesar; and as for your family, have you yet
  seriously considered into what misery they must be plunged?"</p>

  <p>"Sir," she replied, "this is cruel kindness. I have considered all
  things."</p>

  <p>"Young maiden," continued Palma, "the touch of the physician's knife is
  painful, yet his hand must not falter. But I have sent for those, who, I
  hope, may speak more effectually."</p>

  <p>The Senator turned from the pedestal on which he had been leaning, and
  walked to the door over against where Aurelius was sitting: and after a
  moment had elapsed, there entered, even as I had anticipated, both her
  uncles, Lucius and Velius. Behind them came, wrapped in her consecrated veil,
  the Priestess of Apollo; and last of all, gazing wildly around, her apparel
  disordered, the friend of her youth, the sister of her bosom,&mdash;she to
  whom in all things, save one, Athanasia's heart had ever been laid open. The
  two Patricians advanced, deeply dejected, towards the place where Athanasia
  stood waiting their approach. The stately Priestess, walking yet more slowly,
  lifted the veil from her face, which was pale and calm as marble. But when
  the youthful companion at last rested her eye upon her friend, and the
  fettered hands clasped together on that bosom, she rushed past them all, and
  was folded in a cold embrace; for though Athanasia pressed Sempronia to her
  bosom, I saw also that she trembled from head to foot, and that her eyes were
  riveted on those who approached with seriousness more terrible than the
  passion of young sympathy.</p>

  <p>"Athanasia," said Lucius, taking her by the hand, "look not upon us thus;
  we come as to a daughter."</p>

  <p>"Dearest," said old Velius, "listen to thy true friends. Do you put more
  faith in the words of strangers than in the blood of kindred&mdash;the
  affection of your father's brothers&mdash;the guardians of his dear
  orphan?"</p>

  <p>"Woe is me!" said Athanasia&mdash;"God, strengthen me! Why, oh, why am I
  forced to wound these kind hearts! Have pity upon me, have pity upon
  me&mdash;you know not what you speak of, else you would all be silent."</p>

  <p>"Weep," said the Priestess; "weep, and weep largely. There is yet time to
  repent. Abjure this madness; let the last of your tears be shed upon the
  altars of your paternal Gods, and they also will be merciful. Nay, tremble
  not when you hear my voice, Athanasia. I love you as tenderly as the rest,
  and if you have deceived me also, I have long since pardoned."</p>

  <p>The Priestess kissed her forehead; and she bowed her head, weeping at
  length audibly. But Athanasia speedily recovered herself, and gently removing
  the hands of Sempronia, stood erect again in the midst.</p>

  <p>"Dear friends," said she, "the moments you have to be with me are
  numbered; what avails it that they should be spent in words that can have no
  effect? I have been baptized in the name of the one true God&mdash;I have
  partaken of the symbols of the Christian mystery&mdash;and I have no more
  power to bring myself out of this peril, than he that stands in the front
  rank&mdash;without sword or buckler&mdash;deprived of all things but his
  honour."</p>

  <p>"Athanasia!" said Velius, "alas! my dear girl, what madness is this? Do
  you hold yourself wiser than all the wise men, and all the good, and all the
  great men that have ever lived in Rome? Do you deem yourself able to
  penetrate mysteries from which all the sages of the earth have retreated with
  humility? Consider with yourself&mdash;remember the modesty that might be
  becoming in your tender years&mdash;and, I must speak the truth, your
  ignorance."</p>

  <p>"Oh, sir!" she answered, "believe not that I have been brought into this
  place, because of my being puffed up with emptiness of conceit. I know well
  that I am a poor, young, unlearned creature; but God gives not according to
  our deserts; and because I am poor and ignorant, must I therefore reject the
  promise of his riches, and the great light that has been manifested to me ,
  which,&mdash;would to God it had also been to you, despite the perils which a
  dark world has thrown around it."</p>

  <p>"O Athanasia!" said young Sempronia, "I know the secrets of your heart,
  although you have kept from me some of them. Think, dear sister, of all the
  love that we bear to you and, oh!&mdash;think of Valerius."</p>

  <p>"The more, then, is the sacrifice!" said Athanasia. "Caius Valerius also
  is a Christian&mdash;at least I hope in God he will soon be sealed into our
  brotherhood."</p>

  <p>"Amen! amen!" said Aurelius.</p>

  <p>The Priestess turned round when he uttered this, and observing that he
  also was fettered, "Blasphemer!" cried she, "behold the end of your frenzy.
  Your eyes are dim, your clay is already yearning, it may be, to be sprinkled
  into ashes; but behold your victim. Ye Gods that see all things, have mercy
  upon the errors of deceived, ensnared, murdered youth! Hoary Apostate! feeble
  though you be, may strength be given to you in anger, that you may taste the
  full struggle and the true agony. May you be strong to wrestle, that you may
  fall slowly, and feel your fall! Would to the Gods, just and merciful, that
  you might struggle and fall alone!"</p>

  <p>"Rash woman," said the manacled Saint, "most surely your last wish is
  mine. But why is it that you have come hither with cruel words, to embitter
  equally the last moments of a life that is dear to you, and a life that you
  despise? You speak of ignorance and of deceit. Little know ye who are the
  deceived. We are the servants of the living God, whose light will soon shine
  abroad among the nations, and quench glimmering tapers, fashioned with the
  hands of men, with which, hitherto, ye have sat contented amidst darkness.
  Caesar may bind and slay&mdash;but think ye that the spirit is his to do with
  it what he will? Think ye that chains and dungeons, and the sword of man can
  alter the course of things that are to be, or shake from its purpose the will
  of Him, in whom, blind and ignorant, ye refuse to behold the image of the
  Maker of all&mdash;shutting eyes, and ears, and your proud hearts; and
  blaspheming against the God of heaven, whose glory ye ascribe to stocks and
  stones, and to the ghosts of wicked and bloody tyrants, long since mouldered
  into dust,&mdash;and to the sun, and the moon, and the stars of the sky,
  which God set there to rule the day and the night, even as he lets loose his
  winds to scatter the leaves of the forest, and to lift up the waves of the
  great deep?&mdash;Leave us, I beseech you.&mdash;The young and the old are
  alike steadfast, for God is our strength, and he bestows it on them that ask
  for it in the name of the Redeemer."</p>

  <p>"Peace, thou accursed!" said the Priestess; "I serve the altar, and came
  not hither to hear the Gods of heaven and earth insulted by the lips of
  hardened impiety.&mdash;Athanasia! will you go with us, or will you stay
  here, and partake the fate of this madman?"</p>

  <p>"God!" cried the maiden; "how shall I speak that they may at length hear
  me!&mdash;Friends&mdash;dear friends&mdash;if you have any love, any
  compassion, I pray you kiss me once, and bid me farewell kindly, and lay my
  ashes in the sepulchre of my fathers&mdash;beside the urn of my mother. Fear
  not that I will disturb the repose of the place&mdash;I shall die in anger
  against no one, and I shall have rest at length when I am relieved from this
  struggle. Pardon, if in any thing besides I ever gave you pain&mdash;remember
  none of my offences but this&mdash;think of me kindly. And go now, dear
  friends; kiss my lips in love, and leave me to bear that which must be borne,
  since there is no escape but in lying, and in baseness, and in utter
  perdition here and hereafter. May the Lord strengthen his day soon, and may
  ye all bless the full light, although now ye are startled by the redness of
  the dawn! Farewell&mdash;kiss me, Velius&mdash;kiss me, Lucius&mdash;my aunt
  also will kiss me."</p>

  <p>They did kiss her, and tears were mingled with their embraces; and they
  said no more, but parted from her where she was. Palma himself lifted the
  desolate Sempronia from the ground, and he and her father carried her away
  senseless, her tresses sweeping the pavement as they moved.</p>

  <p>The prisoners were alone. "The moment is come," said Silo; "now, sir,
  prepare yourself to risk every thing where every thing may be gained."</p>

  <p>He did not whisper this, but spake the words boldly; and ere I could
  either answer any thing, or form any guess as to his meaning, he had leaped
  down from my side, and thrown open another secret spring. Silo rushed in, and
  I followed him. It was all done so rapidly, that I scarce remember how. I
  cannot, indeed, forget the wild and vacant stare of Athanasia, the cry which
  escaped from her lips, nor the fervour with which she sunk into my embrace.
  But all the rest is a dream. The door closed swiftly behind us;&mdash;swiftly
  I ran, bearing the maiden in my arms through all the long course of those
  deserted chambers. Door after door flew open before us. All alike, breathless
  and speechless, we ran on. We reached the last of the chambers, the wide and
  echoing saloon, ere my heart had recovered from the first palpitation of
  surprise; and a moment after we breathed once more the free air of
  heaven.</p>

  <p>"Stop not," said I, "for the sake of God. Hasten, Silo, it is you that
  must guide us."&mdash;"Ha!" said he, "already have they perceived it? Great
  God! after all, is it in vain?" We heard shout echoing shout, and the
  clapping of doors. "Treachery, treachery! Escape, escape!" and trumpet and
  horn mingled in the clamour of surprise, wrath, terror. "Ride, ride,"
  screamed a voice high over all the tumult&mdash;"ride this
  instant&mdash;guard every avenue&mdash;search every corner&mdash;the wing of
  Domitian!"</p>

  <p>"We are lost," said Silo;&mdash;"we can never reach the gate."</p>

  <p>"To the Temple of Apollo!" said I; "the Priestess will shelter
  Athanasia."</p>

  <p>"Thank God," whispered Silo, "there is one chance more."&mdash;And so we
  began again to run swiftly, keeping close beneath the shaded wall of the
  edifice, and then threading many narrow passages of the hanging gardens of
  Adonis, we reached indeed the adjoining court of the Palatine, and found
  ourselves, where all was as yet silent and undisturbed, under the sacred
  portico. The great gate was barred. Athanasia herself pointed out a postern,
  and we stood within the temple.</p>

  <p>It was filled as before, (for here the alternations of day and night made
  no difference,) with the soft and beautiful radiance proceeding from the tree
  of lamps. But the fire on the altar burned high and clear, as if recently
  trimmed, and behind its blaze stood one of the ministering damsels. Her hand
  held the chain of the censer, and she was swinging it slowly, while the
  clouds of fragrant smoke rolled high up above the flames;&mdash;and the near
  light, and the intervening smoke, and the occupation with which she was
  busied, prevented her from at first perceiving what intrusion had been made
  on the solitude of the place. Athanasia ran on, and clasping the knees of the
  astonished girl with her fettered hands, began to implore her by the memory
  of old affection and companionship, and for the sake of all that was dear to
  her, to give escape, if escape were possible at least to give concealment.
  The girl had dropped the censer from her hand, and seemed utterly confused,
  and unable to guess the meaning of what she saw and heard. "Lady!" cried
  Silo, falling by the side of Athanasia&mdash;"Oh, lady! stand not here
  considering, for this is the very moment of utmost peril. Behold these
  fetters&mdash;they tell you from what her flight hath been."</p>

  <p>The girl grasped the hands of Athanasia, and gazed upon the manacles, and
  still seemed quite amazed and stupified; and while Silo was renewing his
  entreaties, we heard suddenly some one trying to open the postern which the
  freedman had fastened behind us. Once and again a violent hand essayed to
  undo the bolt, and then all was quiet again. And in a moment after, the great
  gate was itself thrown open, and the Priestess entered, followed by her two
  brothers, who supported between them the yet faint and weeping young
  Sempronia.</p>

  <p>In a moment Athanasia had rushed across the temple, and knelt down with
  her forehead to the ground, close by where the feet of her haughty kinswoman
  were planted.</p>

  <p>"Unhappy!" said she; "by what magic do I behold you here? How have you
  escaped? and why&mdash;oh! why fled hither? Think ye, that here, in the
  Temple of Apollo, the priestess of an insulted God can give shelter to
  blasphemy flying from the arms of justice? Ha! and he, too, is
  here!&mdash;Outcast! how durst thou? Speak, unhappy Athanasia- everything is
  dark, and I see only that you have brought hither&mdash;"&mdash;"Friends,
  friends&mdash;oh! blame them not," interrupted the maiden- "Oh! blame them
  not for venturing all to save me. Oh! help us, and help speedily for they
  search every where, and they may speedily be here."</p>

  <p>"Here?" cried the priestess&mdash;"who, I pray you? Ha! run, fly, bolt the
  door. If Caesar speaks, I answer."</p>

  <p>The ring of arms, and voices of angry men, were heard distinctly
  approaching. In a moment more we could hear them talking together beneath the
  very portico, and trying, in their turn, to thrust open the massive valves of
  the temple. "Who calls there?" cried the Priestess&mdash;"Who calls and
  knocks? If a suppliant approaches, let him come as a
  suppliant."&mdash;"Castor! We are no suppliants," answered a rough
  voice:&mdash;"Dead or alive, you must give up our pretty Christians. Come,
  come, my sly masters; yield, yield, there is no flying from Caesar."</p>

  <p>"Peace, insolent!" quoth the Priestess&mdash;"peace, and begone! This is
  the Temple of Apollo, and ye shall find no Christians here. Turn, rude man,
  and dread the arm that guarded Delphos!" And saying so, she at length lifted
  up Athanasia, and moved towards the other extremity of the fane, where, as I
  had occasion once to tell you before, the private chamber of the Priestess
  was situated on the right hand beyond the statue of Apollo. In passing the
  image she halted an instant, laid her hand on her eyes, and kissed its feet,
  with a murmur of supplication; but that was her only utterance: and the rest
  gave none.</p>

  <p>She thus led us across the chamber in which, on a former day, I had heard
  Athanasia sing; and in like manner, having taken a lamp in her hand, on
  through the long passages which conduct towards the receptacle wherein the
  Sybilline prophecies are said to be preserved. She opened the door which she
  had, on that earlier day, told me led into the repository of those mysterious
  scrolls. Two inner doors appeared before us; that to the left she opened
  likewise, and we perceived, descending from its threshold, a dark flight of
  steps, as if down into the centre of the rock.</p>

  <p>"Here," said she, as she paused, and held the lamp over the gloomy
  perspective&mdash;"here, at last, I leave you, having already done too much,
  whether I think of the God I serve, or of Trajan, or of myself. But for the
  blood of kindred not little may be dared. Go with her, since you have come
  with her. More I cannot do. Here&mdash;take this lamp; the door at the bottom
  is fastened only from within; let it fall behind you, and make what speed you
  may."</p>

  <p>"One thing," said Silo, "had better be done ere you depart;" and so, very
  adroitly, he, by means of his jailer's key, relieved both of them from their
  fetters. He then whispered, "Go no farther, Valerius; you may rest assured
  that no one suspects us." I saw that he designed to return into the courts of
  the Palatine, and so proceed homewards, as if ignorant of every thing that
  had occurred. The good freedman had no other course to pursue, either in duty
  to himself or to his family. But for me, all my cares were here. I squeezed
  by the hand both Lucius and Velius, and both warmly returned my pressure. The
  Priestess gave the lamp into my hand, and the door was shut upon us; and we
  began, with hearts full of thankfulness, but not yet composed enough to taste
  of lightness&mdash;with thankfulness uppermost in our confused thoughts, and
  with no steady footsteps, to descend into the unknown abyss.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch308"
     name="ch308">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE steps were abrupt and narrow; but in a few minutes our
  feet became accustomed to them, and we descended rapidly. After we had done
  so for some time, we found ourselves in a low chamber of oblong form, in the
  midst of which an iron stake was fixed into the floor, having chains of
  ponderous workmanship attached to its centre, and over against it, a narrow
  chair of the same metal, it also immovable. I asked Athanasia to repose
  herself here for a moment; for it was evident that the tumultuous evening had
  much worn out her strength. But she said, shuddering, "No, not here,
  Valerius; I never saw this place before, but the aspect of it recalls to me
  fearful stories. Here, woe is me, many a poor wretch has expiated offences
  against the dignity of the shrine, and the servants of its Demon. My father
  knows, I doubt not, some humble Christian roof, beneath which we may be safe
  until the first search be over. Let us breathe at least the open air, and He
  who has hitherto helped will not desert us."</p>

  <p>"No, my children," said Aurelius; "let us not linger here. Christian
  roofs, indeed, are known to me, both humble and lofty; but how to know how
  far suspicion may already have extended?&mdash;or why should we run any
  needless risk of bringing others into peril, having by God's grace escaped
  ourselves, when all hope as to this life had been utterly taken away? Let us
  quit these foul precincts&mdash;let us quit them speedily&mdash;but let us
  not rashly be seen in the busy city. There is a place known to me, (and
  Athanasia also has visited it heretofore,) where safety, I think, may be
  expected, and where, if danger do come, it shall find no unnecessary victim.
  Let us hasten to the Esquiline."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, father!" said Athanasia; "there no one will seek us: there best
  shall our thanksgivings and our prayers be offered. We will rest by the
  sepulchre of our friend, and Valerius will go into the city, and procure what
  things are needful."</p>

  <p>We began the descent of another flight of steps, beyond the dark chamber.
  This terminated at length in a door, the bolts of which being withdrawn, we
  found ourselves beneath the sky of night, at the extremity of one of the
  wooded walks that skirt the southern base of the Palatine&mdash;the remains
  of the Assyrian magnificence which had once connected the Golden House of
  Nero with the more modest structures of his predecessors. I wrapped Athanasia
  in my cloak, and walked beside her in my tunic; and Aurelius conducted us by
  many windings, avoiding as far as was possible the glare of the Suburra, all
  round about the edge of the city, to the gardens which hang over the wall by
  the great Esquiline Gate.</p>

  <p>"Is it here," said I, when he paused&mdash;"is it in the midst of this
  splendour that you hope to find a safe obscurity?"</p>

  <p>"Have patience," replied the old man; "you are a stranger:&mdash;and yet
  you speak what I should have heard without surprise from many that have spent
  all their days in Rome. Few, indeed, ever think of entering a region which is
  almost as extensive as the city itself, and none, I think, are acquainted
  with all its labyrinths."</p>

  <p>So saying, the priest led the way into one of the groves. Its trees formed
  a dense canopy overhead; nor could we pass without difficulty among the
  close-creeping undergrowth. At length we reached the centre of the wide
  thicket, and found a small space of soil comparatively bare. The light of
  moon and star plunged down there among the surrounding blackness of boughs,
  as into some deep well, and showed the entrance of a natural grotto, which
  had, indeed, all the appearance of oblivion and utter desertedness.
  "Confess," said he, "that I did not deceive you. But there is no hurry now;
  let me taste once more the water of this forgotten spring."</p>

  <p>I had not observed a small fountain hard by the mouth of the grotto,
  which, in former days, had evidently been much cared for, although now almost
  all its surface was covered with leaves. The marble margin showed dim with
  moss; nor had a statue just within the entrance of the grot escaped this
  desolation. Damp herbage obscured its recumbent limbs, and the Parian stone
  had lost its brightness. "You can scarcely see where the inscription was,"
  said Aurelius, "for the letters are filled up or effaced; but I remember when
  many admired it, and I can still repeat the lines&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="verse">Nymph of the grot, these sacred springs I keep,<br>
  And to the murmur of these waters sleep;<br>
  Ah! spare my slumbers, gently tread the cave,<br>
  And drink in silence, or in silence lave." *</p>

  <p class="quote">* So Pope has rendered the beautiful lines:</p>

  <p class="verse">Hujus Nympha Loci, sacri custodia fontis,<br>
  Dormio, dum blandae sentio murmur aquae;<br>
  Parce meum, quisquis tangis cava marmora, somnum<br>
  Rumpere; sive bibas, sive lavere, tace.</p><br>

  <p>Little did they, who graved this command, conjecture how well it was to be
  obeyed. But there should be another inscription. Ay, here it is," said he,
  stepping on a long flat piece of marble among the weeds. I was advancing to
  examine the stone, but the old man stopped me: "What avails it to spell out
  the record? Do you remember the story of Asinius? It was within this very
  cavern that the man was butchered;* and now you see both he and his monument
  are alike sinking into forgetfulness. I believe, however, the monument itself
  must bear the blame in part; for I have heard my father say that he had been
  told this was a favourite fountain until that slaughter."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Asinius autem brevi illo tempore quasi in hortulos in
  <i>arenarias</i> quasdam juxta portam Exquiliniam perductus, occiditur. Cic.
  <i>Pro Cluent</i>. ]</p>

  <p>Athanasia meantime had sat down by the grotto, and was laving her forehead
  with the water of the solitary fountain. Aurelius, too, dipped his hands in
  the well, and tasted of the water, and then turning to me, he said, with a
  grave smile, "Valerius, methinks you are religious in your regard for the
  slumbers of the nymph." He whispered something into the oar of Athanasia, and
  received an answer from her in the same tone, ere he proceeded:&mdash;"Draw
  near&mdash;fear not that I shall do any thing rashly&mdash;we owe all things
  to your love&mdash;we know we do; but speak plainly.&mdash;Do you indeed
  desire to be admitted into the fellowship of the true Faith? Let not the
  symbol of regeneration be. applied hastily. Without doubt, great were my joy
  might my hands be honoured to shed the blessed water of baptism upon the brow
  of dear Valerius."</p>

  <p>"Caius," said Athanasia, "I know God has touched your heart; why should
  this be delayed any longer? You have shared the perils of the faithful.
  Partake with them in good as in evil. Hesitate no longer; God will perfect
  what hath been so begun."</p>

  <p>"Dearest friends!" said I, "if I hesitate, it is only because I doubt if I
  am yet worthy. Surely I believe that this is the right faith, and that there
  is no God but He whom you worship."</p>

  <p>"Acceptable is humility in the sight of Heaven," said the priest; and he
  rose up from the place where he had been sitting, and began, standing by the
  margin of the well, to pour out words of thanksgiving and supplication, such
  as I have never heard equalled by any lips but his. The deep calm voice of
  the holy man sounded both sweet and awful in the breathless air of midnight.
  The tall black trees stood all around, like a wall, cutting us off from the
  world, and from the thoughts of the world; and the moon, steady in the serene
  sky, seemed to shower down light and beauty upon nothing in all the wide
  earth, but that little guarded space of our seclusion. I stepped into the
  cool water of the fountain. The old man stooped over me, and sprinkled the
  drops upon my forehead, and the appointed words were repeated. Aurelius
  kissed my brow, as I came forth from the water, and Athanasia also drew
  slowly near, and then hastily she pressed my forehead with trembling
  lips.</p>

  <p>We sat down together by the lonely well; and we sat in silence, for I
  could not be without many thoughts partaken by none but myself, at the moment
  when I had thus, in the face of God and man, abjured the faith of all my
  fathers, and passed into the communion of the despised and persecuted Few;
  nor did either the priest or Athanasia essay to disturb my meditations.</p>

  <p>There were moments (for I must not conceal from you my weakness) in which
  I could scarcely help suspecting that I had done something that was wrong. I
  thought of my far distant mother; and I could not reflect without pain upon
  the feelings with which I had every reason to suppose that she, kind as she
  was, and merciful in all things, would have contemplated the scene which had
  passed. I thought of my dead parent too; and that was yet more serious and
  awful. The conviction of my own mind, in obedience to which I had acted,
  relieved me, however, from any feelings of self-reproach.&mdash;My father is
  dead, said I to myself&mdash;He died in ignorance, and he has not been judged
  according to the light, which never shone upon him. But now&mdash;Oh, yes! it
  must be so&mdash;the darkness has passed from before his eyes; and, if the
  spirits of the departed ever visit, in the dim hours of silence, those who
  were dear to them upon this earth, surely his venerable shade stood by
  smiling while the forehead of his son was laved with these blessed
  waters.</p>

  <p>Meantime, minutes&mdash;hours, perhaps, glided away, while troubled, and
  solemn, and tender thoughts thus occupied by turns my bosom. The old priest
  sat by me, his arms folded on his breast, gazing upwards upon the spangled
  glories of the firmament. Athanasia was on the other side, close by the
  statue of the Sleeping Naiad. From time to time, she too would fix her eyes
  for a moment upon the untroubled beauty of the moon; and then, stooping over
  the brink. of the fountain, once and again I saw its calm dark waters rippled
  beneath her by the dropping of a tear.</p>

  <p>"My children," said, at length, Aurelius, "methinks more sadness is
  amongst us than might suit the remembrance of what Providence has done for
  us, since the sun that went down upon fear and sorrow is about to rise upon
  many fair hopes. I am old; the world lies behind me, save a remnant I know
  not how brief. It lies all before you, and you have a light whereby to look
  upon it, which my early day wanted. I trust that soon, very soon, ye shall
  both be far from this city&mdash;I say both, for I know well, go where ye
  may, ye will go together. As for me, my lot is cast here, and here I will
  remain. Caius, you must leave us betimes&mdash;you must return into the city,
  and consult with your friends and hers, how best Athanasia may be conveyed
  safely beyond the bounds of Italy. Caesar, indeed, rules every where; but at
  a distance from Rome suspicion is, at least, less watchful; and there is no
  precept given by which ye are bound to seek unnecessary perils."</p>

  <p>"Aurelius," said I&mdash;"dear father, think not but that I have already
  been considering all these things anxiously. As soon as I have seen you
  safely placed within the retreat of which you have spoken, I shall hasten to
  Licinius, my kinsman, who already, indeed, must be feeling no small anxiety
  from my absence. I shall speak with him, and with both the Sempronii. My own
  errand to the capital I value as nothing, and I shall be ready on the
  instant, if Athanasia herself will consent to partake my voyage."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Caius," said the father&mdash;"this child of God will be your wife,
  and ye will both serve the Lord many days, amidst the quiet valleys of your
  far off island.&mdash;Nay, daughter, do not weep, for these are not common
  days, and you must follow without fear the path which God's providence points
  out. Before ye go, my children, I myself shall join your hands in the name of
  our God."</p>

  <p>Athanasia heard his words, and saw me gaze upon his face, but she made no
  reply, except by the tears which Aurelius rebuked, and a timid, yet grave and
  serious pressure, with which she, when he had made an end of speaking,
  returned the fervid pressure of my hand upon hers.</p>

  <p>"Children," said the old man, "there is no need of words when hearts are
  open&mdash;the tears that ye have shed together are the best earnest of the
  vows that ye shall ere long, I trust, pronounce. Yet, let no rashness attend
  your steps. The dawn must now be near, and Athanasia and I had better retire
  into our protecting covert. Valerius will leave us, and return at eventide.
  Till then, fasting and praying, we shall give thanks for our deliverance, and
  ask the aid that alone is precious for the time that yet remains."</p>

  <p>I had, fortunately, brought all the way with me the lamp which lighted our
  steps down the mysterious staircase, from the shrine of Apollo. Some little
  oil still remained within it, and Aurelius soon struck a light, and, taking
  it in his hand, began to enter before us the dark cavern, by the mouth of
  which we had all this while been sitting. You, perhaps, have never heard of
  those strange excavations, the whole extent of which has probably never been
  known to any one person, but which appear, indeed, as the priest had said, to
  be almost co-extensive with the great city beneath which they are placed. For
  what purpose they were at first dug, is a subject which has long exercised
  the conjectures of those fond of penetrating into the origin of things, and
  the customs of antiquity. By some it is supposed, that in such caverns,
  winding far away into unseen recesses, the first rude inhabitants of Italy,
  like the Troglodytes of Upper Egypt and Ethiopia, had fixed their miserable
  abodes. Others assert, that they owe their origin merely to the elder
  builders of the visible Rome, who, to avoid marring the surface of the earth,
  were contented to bring their materials of sand, clay, and stone, from these
  subterraneous labyrinths, which so grew with the progress of diligence, and
  with the extension of the city itself. Perhaps both conjectures may have some
  foundation in truth; but be that as it may, there is no question, that, in
  succeeding times, these catacombs had been widened and extended, to serve as
  places of burial for the mortal remains of the poor citizens. And now is it
  to be wondered at, that here, in regions so obscure and dismal, the
  persecuted adherents of the Faith should have frequently sought not only
  resting-places for the bodies of their dead, but even shelter for themselves,
  amidst the terror of those relentless days? Hither, more than once, the aged
  priest said, he had fled to escape the pursuit of his enemies&mdash;here once
  more he hoped the shield of safety would lie over his peril&mdash;here, at
  last, by whatever death he should die, his brethren had promised to lay his
  bones in the earth, beside Tisias of Antioch, and many more that, in the
  bloody times of Nero and Domitian, had already, in the sight of all that
  heartless city, merited the crown, and the spotless robe, and "the
  palm-branch of martyrdom, by patient endurance of the last insolence of
  man.</p>

  <p>Our father, therefore, held the lamp before us, and we entered those
  gloomy regions, wherein alone the servants of the Son of God could at that
  troubled era esteem themselves in safety from the hot pursuit of contemptuous
  power. We passed along beneath the arches of the rock-hewn roof, and between
  the endless winding walls, on either side of which appeared many humble
  inscriptions, recording the virtues of the departed and the regrets of the
  surviving poor. Of these last, however, as it appeared, all must long since
  have been gathered to the ashes of those they lamented, for there was no
  semblance of any new monument among all that we observed, and most of them,
  to judge from the shape of the letters upon them, must have been set up at
  least as long ago as the period of Asinius. After traversing many of these
  subterraneous galleries, we came, at last, to one more low-roofed than the
  rest, into which Aurelius struck aside, saying, "Here Tisias lies, but no
  inscription marks the place where a martyr finds repose. Here is the spot;
  with my own hands I lent feeble help in digging the grave. Athanasia, too,
  knows it well, for she also did not fear to assist in rendering the last
  honours to that soldier of Christ."</p>

  <p>A flat thin stone, without mark or epitaph, indicated the spot.</p>

  <p>"Father," said Athanasia, "let me rest here. I am weary and worn&mdash;but
  here I shall fear no evil. Conduct Caius back to the grotto; it is time he
  should go."</p>

  <p>Thus leaving her by the funeral-stone, Aurelius and I retraced our steps
  to the mouth of the catacomb.</p>

  <p>"Already," said he, "the sky is red eastward&mdash;walk cautiously through
  the gardens, and regain with all speed the house of your kinsman. Go, my son;
  may all blessings attend your steps. Come back at the rising of the moon, and
  cast a stone into the fountain, and I shall be within hearing. Go, and fear
  not."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch309"
     name="ch309">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I PASSED without disturbance through the gardens of the
  Esquiline, and the streets of the city, in which no one was as yet moving,
  except a few rustics driving asses laden with herbs to the market-place. When
  I reached the house of my kinsman, however, it was evident that sleep did not
  prevail within its gates; lights were visible in the vestibule, and there I
  found several of the slaves sitting in conversation. My own could not conceal
  the extravagance of his satisfaction on seeing me enter among them in safety;
  so that I had no doubt his brother had informed him, in so far at least, of
  what had passed after our leaving him in the Mammertine. Dromo received me
  also with warm demonstrations of joy, and conducted me to the chamber of
  Licinius, in which, with the orator himself, were Sextus, pale with watching,
  Sabinus, still habited in military attire, with a goblet of wine before him
  on the table, and Lucius Sempronius, who was reclining at some little
  distance from the rest. It was he that eagerly began to question me; and I
  perceived from the style in which he spoke, that all present had already been
  made aware of the manner in which Athanasia had been withdrawn from the
  council-chamber. A few words informed them of what had followed after we
  quitted the Temple of Apollo.</p>

  <p>"I thank the gods," said Sempronius,&mdash;"so far at least it goes
  well&mdash;but if this strictness, of which the Centurion speaks, shall be
  adhered to, there still must be no small difficulty about conveying her
  beyond the city."</p>

  <p>"In truth," quoth Sabinus, after a little pause, "I am afraid this is
  scarcely a matter in regard to which I should be consulted. I know not but
  already I have done several things that could not be quite reconciled with my
  duty. I shall, in all probability, be set on the watch myself, and if
  so&mdash;much as I must regret the necessity&mdash;it certainly will be most
  necessary for me to discharge what is committed to my trust. Is there no
  possibility, think you, of inventing some impenetrable disguise? Depend on
  it, it is quite impossible the young lady should remain any where in Rome,
  without being ere long discovered. The first thing is to have her safe beyond
  the city-walls."</p>

  <p>"I myself," said I, "shall embark instantly for Britain. Sempronius,
  Athanasia must go with me Surely it may be possible to have her carried
  unobserved to the shore."</p>

  <p>"You!" said Licinius " you embark instantly for Britain? You know not what
  you speak; your lawsuit has been determined this very afternoon. Every thing
  that Cneius left is your own."</p>

  <p>"O Jove!" cried Sabinus, "did ever mortal receive such news with such a
  face! But come, here is health to the heir of the Valerii, and may this
  Massic choke me, if I love him not the better for his gravity."</p>

  <p>"Would to heaven!" said Sempronius, "our young friend had loved under
  other auspices! No, Valerius must stay and take possession, destined, as I
  hope he is to equal, under the favour of the gods, the noblest name in his
  lineage. My dear niece&mdash;let us trust she may be concealed somewhere in
  safety from the pursuit. Separated from this fanatic crew, she will, ere
  long, without question, abandon the dreams they have filled her mind withal;
  and on some happier day, our friend may perhaps have no reason either to fear
  or to blush, for lifting her over the threshold of the Valerii."</p>

  <p>I drew near to the old man, and, receiving his embrace, whispered into his
  ear, "Sempronius, you speak generously; but know that this very evening I
  also have become a Christian."</p>

  <p>"Heavens!" cried he, "what limits shall be affixed to this contagion! Rash
  boy! have you not seen already to what consequences this must lead?"</p>

  <p>"What?" says Licinius&mdash;"what new calamity is this? Have my ears
  deceived me? Speak, dear Caius&mdash;for the sake of all the blood in your
  veins-&mdash;you have not embraced this frenzy?"</p>

  <p>"My friends," said I, "why should I speak to one, when all of you are, I
  well know, alike interested? In all things else I bow to age and
  understanding so much above my own; but here I have thought for myself, and
  my faith is fixed."</p>

  <p>Licinius heard me with a countenance of painful and anxious emotion. In
  the eye of young Sextus I saw a tear ready to start, and his whole aspect was
  that of one sad and bewildered. Sempronius leaned his brow upon his hand, and
  turned himself away from me. But as for the Centurion, he preserved his usual
  air; and after a moment, all the rest continuing silent, said, "Valerius, I
  have been in love ere now, and perhaps am not out of the scrape at present;
  but you have thrown a new light upon the matter. What do you fancy to be the
  great merits of the present age, that it should be treated with more favour
  than all that have gone before it? And, if you come to speak of the Jews,
  every body knows they are a most pitiful, mean, knavish set of creatures.
  They were always by the ears among themselves; but I think it is rather too
  much that they should have the credit of bringing their betters (by which I
  mean all the world besides) into confusion. You are but green yet; all this
  will blow over anon, and you will laugh more heartily than any one else when
  you think of your weakness. But look up, good friend, I don't think you are
  listening to me."</p>

  <p>"My dear Sabinus," said I, "I do listen, but I think it is rather to the
  gay Praetorian, than to the patient friend I had expected to find in
  you."</p>

  <p>"Come!" said he again, "you take every thing so seriously. If you are
  resolved to be a Christian, I am very sorry for it; but even that shall not
  stand between me and a true friend. I hope you will soon see the thing as I
  do&mdash;I know you will; but, in the meantime, Valerius, you may count upon
  me." And the kind man squeezed my hand with his customary fervour.</p>

  <p>He then turned round to the rest of our friends, and began to propose for
  their consideration a dozen different schemes of escape, that had already
  suggested themselves to his imagination.</p>

  <p>Licinius took advantage of the first pause, to suggest that the Centurion
  seemed in a hurry to get rid of me. He then passed into an account of the
  speech he had delivered on the preceding afternoon before the Court of the
  Centumvirs, and of the unhesitating manner, so gratifying to his feelings, in
  which its judgment had been pronounced. For some moments, in his detail of
  these proceedings, he seemed almost to have lost sight of the present
  situation and views of the person most interested in their termination. But
  when, in the progress of his story, he came to enlarge upon the magnificence
  of my new possessions&mdash;the domains in Africa&mdash;the rich farms in
  Sicily&mdash;the numerous slaves engaged in their cultivation&mdash;the
  Spanish silver mine&mdash;and, last of all, the splendours of the great villa
  upon the banks of the Tiber&mdash;it was not difficult to perceive that he
  could scarcely restrain his indignation at the purpose I had been expressing.
  "And such," said he, "are the realities which our young friend quits for the
  reasons he has mentioned! Well, every man must judge for himself. If it must
  be so, let it be so."</p>

  <p>I heard him patiently to the end, and then said, "You have well summed up
  the whole matter, my dear Licinius. It must indeed be so. I go immediately to
  Britain, and I trust she&mdash;for whom I would leave all these things, were
  they greater than they are&mdash;shall, by the aid of your kindness, go with
  me in safety. There is one request only which I have, in addition to all
  this, to lay before you; and that you may hear it the more patiently, it does
  not concern myself.</p>

  <p>"In a word, then," I continued, "should happier days arrive, I hope once
  more to be among you here in Rome.</p>

  <p>The wealth which, thanks to your zeal, Licinius, is this day mine, can be
  of little use to me in the British valley, to which, for the present, I
  retire. Above all, this beautiful villa of which you speak,&mdash;why,
  because for a time I am unable to occupy it, should the mansion of my fathers
  stand empty, when there are others among their descendants, who lie not under
  the same necessity of exile? Till I am enabled to breathe in freedom the air
  of Italy, I trust Licinius will consent to let Sextus represent me in my
  villa. There, too, I hope Sempronius will permit his daughter to be. It will
  give pleasure to Athanasia, to think that those halls contain the dearest of
  our friends. When we come back, if ever we do so, they will not grudge to
  make room for us beneath the same roof with themselves.
  Licinius&mdash;Sempronius&mdash;what say you?"</p>

  <p>They were both silent for a moment; but Sabinus was at hand to answer for
  them:&mdash;"By all Olympus! I shall knock down any man henceforth, that in
  my presence abuses Christianity as a destruction of men's hearts. Let it be,
  good friends, as our Caius says. I know, Sextus, I have at least your voice
  upon my side. Let it be so; and, for heaven's sake, let it be immediately. A
  wedding is the very thing to divert attention from these troubles in both
  kindreds."</p>

  <p>Our conversation was interrupted by Dromo, who told me that Silo the
  jailer had come to see me, and was below in the hall. There I found the
  humane man, with his little daughter in his hand, and walked aside with him
  into the inner portico of the house. I told him how the escape, for which his
  zeal alone was to be thanked, had been terminated&mdash;and to what
  resolution I had now come;&mdash;and then inquired whether no suspicion had
  been attached to himself, in consequence of his absence from the Capitoline.
  Having assured me that he had no reason to think so,&mdash;"The oath which I
  had taken to Trajan," said he, "prevented me from adopting the simpler course
  of setting open for our dear friends the gates of the Mammertine; and I trust
  that I did not offend against that oath by acting as I did, after they had
  been taken away for the time from my keeping. But both they and you must be
  aware of the pain which I suffered during their confinement, and of the
  dangers which I have encountered by their escape. I am resolved no more to be
  subject to such struggles. I cannot preserve my faith as a Christian, and my
  honour as a servant of Trajan. This very day I resign my charge in the
  Mammertine; this very night, if it so please you, I am ready to accompany you
  and my dear young lady, in your flight to Britain."</p>

  <p>I need not say with what gladness I heard this proposal. Returning to my
  friends, I informed them of what I had just heard, and perceiving now at last
  that there was no chance of diverting me from my project, they entered, like
  true friends, into serious consultation respecting the best method of
  carrying my project into execution. The aid of Silo, who had already given
  such proofs both of presence of mind, and of prudence, and courage, was
  regarded by them as of the highest importance. He was shortly summoned to
  take part in our deliberation, and it was resolved, that after resigning in a
  formal manner the office he held, and transferring his property for the
  present into the custody of Licinius, he should forthwith repair to Ostium,
  and there hire and put in readiness, for immediate use, a small vessel, the
  lightest he could find, in which the fugitive party might transport
  themselves at least as far as Corsica. To this the zealous Silo without
  hesitation assented. It was agreed that he should have the mariners on their
  benches by the coming on of night, and that he himself should be waiting for
  us by a certain ruined tower, which stands conspicuously by the river side,
  about a mile and a half above Ostium. We left it to Silo himself, to stock
  the bark with any merchandise which he might deem best adapted to deceive the
  superintendents of the haven.</p>

  <p>Partly from the necessity of making provision of various kinds for this
  voyage, but still more in consequence of the law-suit, with the termination
  of which you have just been made acquainted, I had no leisure that day, from
  which to work out unnecessary pain either for myself or for others. I had to
  assist Licinius in looking over an infinity of deeds, and to superintend the
  drawing out of others. In the next place, I had to go to the Forum for the
  purpose of manumitting some slaves, (such a largesse being naturally
  expected); and while I was occupied with this, need I tell you, that my own
  poor Briton was not forgotten? Licinius having, at the joint request of
  Sextus and myself, accorded that morning to the Cretan also the well-merited
  gift of his liberty, Boto and Dromo were seen strutting about the Forum
  together for some moments, each arrayed in that worshipful cap which had
  formed the most prominent object in their daydreams of felicity. I shall not
  trouble you with needless particulars. Let it suffice, that the greater part
  of the day was thus spent in unavoidable business.</p>

  <p>Towards evening, I stole privately from my kinsman's house, being willing
  to avoid a formal farewell, and repaired to Sabinus, who received me with
  very lively emotion. What he dwelt upon most fervently, however, was the
  probability&mdash;the certainty he seemed to esteem it&mdash;that a
  persecution of this nature could not be long persisted in by such a prince as
  Trajan; and the pleasure with which, that being all at an end, he should see
  me come back to Rome, and take due possession of the inheritance of my
  fathers. After expatiating most fluently for some minutes on the expected
  delights of that day, he paused suddenly, and then added, in a tone of some
  little hesitation, "And as for me, I wonder in what state you shall find me.
  Rich or poor&mdash;married or single&mdash;Centurion or Tribune&mdash;one
  thing is certain, that I shall, in all circumstances, be not a little
  rejoiced to see you."</p>

  <p>"You had better marry, my good captain," said I.</p>

  <p>"Marry! me to marry? I have not the least thought of such a thing. You did
  not put any faith, did you, in the raillery of those waggish fellows of
  yesterday?"</p>

  <p>"A little&mdash;a very little, Sabinus."</p>

  <p>"Poh! poh! now you are jesting."</p>

  <p>"And much, very much, Sabinus, in the conscious looks of a certain
  blushing Centurion, yesterday."</p>

  <p>"Come," quoth he, "there is more cunning in these British eyes than I ever
  should have dreamt of. Fill your cup to the brim, boy, and since you are to
  leave us so speedily, I shall have no secrets for you. I have seen
  service;&mdash;true, but what of that? I have kept a light heart in all my
  campaigns. But my day, it must be confessed, begins to wear a little, a very
  little, towards the evening; and, Castor! if you allow supper time to slip
  over, I don't know but you must go to bed with a light stomach. Now or never
  was the word, my boy; and the widow is mine own."</p>

  <p>"And Xerophrastes?" said I.</p>

  <p>"And as for the most sagacious and venerable Xerophrastes, why, to tell
  you the truth, I see nothing for him but that he should allow his beard to
  curl as it pleases, drop his long cloak over his ambitious pair of shanks,
  forswear moonlight, purchase for himself a dark lantern instead, and see
  whether he can't find, within the four walls of Rome, an honest Greek, and a
  constant widow, to make one blessed wedding withal. That is my advice to the
  Stoic&mdash;Stoic no longer&mdash;but, if there be hoops upon a tub, the most
  cynical of all Cynics."</p>

  <p>When it was at last necessary that I should move&mdash;"Dear Caius," said
  the Centurion, "you know the Prefect has set a price on their heads, and I
  promise you it is such a temptation as no virtue, that keeps watch beneath
  any common praetorian breast-plate, could well be trusted to wrestle with.
  But hope, and dare. And here, take once more this helmet, and cloak, and
  sword, and with them share the password of the night."</p>

  <p>Sabinus then gave private orders to one of his troop, and walked with me
  towards the Esquiline.&mdash;But why should I linger over what little remains
  of this story? Why pain you with the parting which I witnessed between my
  Athanasia and the holy Aurelius, afterwards numbered among the martyrs of
  Christ?&mdash;Behold us at last issued from the Catacombs, and mounted on the
  trusty horses which our friend had caused to be waiting at no great distance
  from the thicket that clothed their entrance. Behold us arrived without
  interruption at the Ostian Gate of Rome.</p>

  <p>The soldiers on guard challenged us cheerily as we came up to them.</p>

  <p>"The word, comrades?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Titus</i>!" quoth the Centurion.</p>

  <p>"Pass on&mdash;whom bear you with you, comrades!"</p>

  <p>"A Christian&mdash;a Christian prisoner," said I.</p>

  <p>"By Jove, that's worth gold to you, brother," quoth the guard.&mdash;"Open
  the gate there;&mdash;pass on, friends. I hope I shall have luck one day
  myself."</p><br>
