<h3><span class="aa">Preface: Historical Background.</span></h3>
<h4>[Excerpts from "History of West Australia", Chapter 17, by
Warren Bert Kimberley.]</h4>
<br>
<p><i>. . . . Mr. Ridley, attached to Mr. Padbury's first party,
was a Government Surveyor, and in his report wrote flatteringly
of the district ["the scenes of Gregory's explorations" (in the
Pilbara)]. The example of the pioneer was therefore early followed
by other gentlemen. By May, 1863, Messrs. K. Brown, S. Hamersley, A.
Brown, B. Clarkson, F. Pearse, and Dr. Martin had chartered a
vessel&mdash;the Flying Foam, Captain Cooper&mdash;to convey them
to the Glenelg River. The Glenelg was reached on the 30th June,
and the ship proceeded as far as the rapids, about twenty-eight
miles from the coast. Then the equipment and stores were landed,
and Messrs. K. Brown, Clarkson, and Dr. Martin left the camp on
6th July with five horses for Camden Harbour, in the north. They
experienced few difficulties, and returned on 10th July. They
reported of the intervening tract:-"A very fine country, with
abundance of good grass and water&mdash;one of the finest
countries in the world." The experiences of a second party were
not so pleasant. Messrs. Clarkson and Hamersley proceeded on the
16th July on another northerly course, and returned four days
later with their horses so fatigued as to be unfit for travel.
Much of the country they entered was exceedingly rough.</i></p>
<p><i>The rise and fall of the tide at the rapids, according to
Captain Cooper, was about twenty feet. On the 25th July two
boats, manned by Captain Cooper, Messrs. Brown Brothers,
Clarkson, Hamersley, and Taylor, went about ten miles up the
river. While they were looking for water in a mangrove thicket
some thirty powerful savages prepared to attack them. The natives
shipped their large spears and approached. Captain Cooper fired
and brought down one who appeared to be the leader; the others
did not stop, and Mr. A. Brown then shot and wounded a second,
and Mr. Clarkson a third. At the last report the blacks gave way,
and with an awful yell disappeared in the thicket. Captain Grey
had reported that the valleys in this country were as rich as any
part of the globe, and that the grass was so high that he could
not see over it. The present explorers were astonished at the
luxuriance of the vegetation, and Captain Cooper considered the
grass to be higher even than Captain Grey led him to expect. On
the banks of the river, he said, thousands of tons of hay could
be cut. The country back from the Glenelg was very hilly, and
clothed with tall grass. The Flying Foam reached Champion Bay on
the return voyage on 13th August. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>. . . . The imagination of a convict led to another voyage
to Exmouth Gulf and Camden Harbour.</i></p>
<p><i>[Henry] Wildman, the felon in question, made a
circumstantial and reasonable report to the authorities that the
north-west was rich in gold. With consummate versatility (which
was truly meritorious) he told them that when first mate of the
Maria Augusta, from Rotterdam to Java, in 1856, his ship lost her
rudder on the north-west coast. He anchored near Camden Harbour
to effect repairs, and mentioned the names of several land-marks
thereabouts. The vessel remained in the bay for twelve days;
while inspecting the neighbouring country he picked up in two and
a half hours eight nuggets of gold, which, on his return to
England, he sold to a bullion merchant in Liverpool for £416. He
carefully kept his discovery secret, and would not now tell the
authorities the exact locality, except that it was some distance
up a river which entered Camden Harbour. It had been his
intention to charter a small vessel to return to the place. He
now asked that a ship should convey him thither as a prisoner,
and magnanimously desired that, when his story was confirmed, he
should receive a remission of his sentence of fifteen years'
penal servitude recorded in 1861.</i></p>
<p><i>The listeners were pleased, and the story was taken from
one to another until settlers, newspapers, and Government were
excited, and thought it advisable to accede to Wildman's request.
The river flowing into Camden Harbour was surely meant for the
Glenelg, which disembogued into Doubtful Bay near by. An
expedition was equipped, and there were numerous applications for
membership. It is said that the Government communicated with the
Home Authorities to ascertain if such a quantity of gold had been
sold by a seafaring man at Liverpool, and when Wildman's story
was confirmed, excitement led to sensation.</i></p>
<p><i>The Government voted £150 towards the expenses of the
expedition, and commissioned Dr. Martin to act as surveyor and
botanist. Surveyor-General Roe, who was acquainted with the
country from his voyages with Captain (since Admiral) King gave
valuable instructions. Mr. Panter, inspector of police, was given
charge of the party, among whom were Messrs. Turner, F. and H.
Caporn, Du Boulay, W. Scott, Langoulant, and Stokes, besides
Wildman and two natives. The ship New Perseverance, under Captain
Owston, was chartered, and on 2nd March, 1864, sailed on the
quest. Horses were taken for the inland travelling.</i></p>
<p><i>During the voyage up the coast the convict was treated on
terms of equality. The vessel was in risk of being wrecked in a
willy willy, but by the seamanship of Captain Owston managed to
weather the storm. When Camden Harbour was reached the real
difficulties of the adventure were experienced. The convict
refused to point out the spot, and notwithstanding the cajolery
and threats of Mr. Panter, he preserved a stubborn silence. He
was disrated from the position of passenger to that of cook.
Finally the party proposed to find the gold without the felon's
assistance. The horses were landed, and Mr. Panter and his band
proceeded inland some twenty miles, but though they searched
sedulously, they found no gold, and returned to the vessel. After
inspecting the country for pastoral stretches they coasted down
to Roebuck Bay, where the horses were again landed, and more
exploration work was done. For two days the convict remained on
the ship in seeming content. Then at night he attempted to
escape, taking with him the two boats. He was caught some days
later and placed in irons. The New Perseverance returned to
Fremantle in June. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>[Martin's glowing reports, including this one to the
Governor, no doubt helped fuel the establishment of the Camden
Harbour Pastoral Association shortly after his return.]</i></p>

<p class="foot">[* This part of the memoir is a portion of the
narrative of an expedition sent out, with live stock, from
Western Australia, in search of new pastoral land in the vicinity
of Glenelg River (Lat. 15° 40' S.). The exploring party consisted
of three gentlemen (besides Mr. Martin), and sailed from Champion
Bay (20° 45' S. lat.) in the schooner <i>Flying Foam</i>, on the
6th of June, 1863.]</p>

<h3>FROM DOUBTFUL BAY TO THE LOWER RAPIDS OF THE GLENELG
RIVER.</h3>
<p><i>June</i> 22, 1863.&mdash;Doubtful Bay is a magnificent
sheet of water, 9 miles in length from north to south, and six
miles in breadth from east to west. Although in the summer vast
quantities of water may from all sides pour into the bay, and the
tides gain additional force thereby, yet, as it is thoroughly
protected from every wind and from a heavy sea by a range of
islands and reefs to seaward, and the natural break-water of the
Montgomery Islands and the coral reef, 14 miles still further to
the westward, as the holding ground is of the very best, and as
there is abundance of room in which to work the largest ship,
Doubtful Bay, if ever this part of the Australian coast should be
colonised, will prove a harbour of refuge second to none. From
the great rise and fall of the tide also, 36 feet, this bay would
be a good site for works necessary to the repairing of ships. A
better terminus to the system of Australian telegraphs, when
connected with those of Europe and Asia, I think it will be
difficult to find. There does not seem to be any agricultural or
even pastoral land in the immediate vicinity of the bay, and the
hills both of the islands and the main are of the most
precipitous character. The south-east shore is fringed with an
immense mangrove swamp, intersected by numerous deep creeks. It
has all the appearance of being the mouth of a large river. About
the centre of this mangrove swamp, on its western limit, rises
the Conical Hill we had in line with the centre of "Foam Passage"
when we entered the bay last night. It is a remarkable hill
rising abruptly from among the mangroves, of a deep red colour,
and without any other hill or land visible from our anchorage,
nearer than two miles. I believe it to be of the old red
sandstone formation, as are the islands to the westward of the
bay. Wood and water are obtainable in Doubtful Bay. The old red
sandstone here exhibits a great variety of the most picturesque
scenery. Outside the bay, in the islands, it attains its grandest
development, wrapping round older rocks and effectually
protecting them from the action of the tides and current. The
rock is a conglomerate of fine hard gravel of a dark red colour.
The character of the old sandstone, and the way in which it is
broken and worn away to form picturesque cliffs, is also well
illustrated in the smaller islands to the south of the entrance
to Doubtful Bay. A bold headland is here nearly separated from
the principal island by the action of the waves, which have
already worn away deep cavities beneath, and threaten soon to
complete the destruction they have begun. The dark, frowning, and
gloomy masses of rock are piled over one another in an order not
irregular, and the huge step-like terraces, by which one may
descend nearly to the line of high water, afford admirable
instances of stratification, joints, and faults. The larger of
the rugged, isolated, projecting fragments in the island, taken
as a type of the whole group, is from 100 to 120 feet in height,
and about the same in breadth and thickness.</p>
<p>At 8.45 <span class="aa">a.m.</span>, a party consisting of
three of the explorers, with one servant, and the master of the
vessel, left in the long boat to climb the range eastward of the
bay to search for a navigable entrance to the Glenelg. Fires, in
groups of two, sprang up from the sea-beach, where the party
landed, to the summit of the first range;&mdash;they are
doubtlessly native signal fires. At noon the tide was running
into the bay at the rate of four knots per hour. A great many
more fires are now springing up in all directions. At 3
<span class="aa">p.m.</span> a signal was made from the shore,
upon which we got under weigh. About a mile and a half from our
anchorage we met the party in the long boat. They report a rugged
country without soil, but with trees and coarse grass growing
luxuriantly, the latter was nearly three feet in height. Among
the trees seen were&mdash;eucalypti, acaciæ, adansoniæ, palms,
and a tree whose leaf, as to venation and other features, closely
resembled the camellia. The walk was so fatiguing that the ascent
to the highest point of the range was not accomplished. The
natives seemed very numerous, judging by their fires and
cooeeing, but they kept out of sight at first; indeed, a near
view of one individual only was obtained. This native carried a
bundle of unusually long spears. Before the party rejoined the
boat, however, several were seen in the distance, as if watching
the behaviour of their unlooked for visitors. From the set of the
tide, which seemed to come from the north-eastern of the two
supposed mouths of the Glenelg, as laid down upon Grey's chart,
we determined to examine it more closely. At 4 <span class=
"aa">p.m.</span>, although the tide was just commencing to run
out, the wind was sufficiently strong to carry us about 2½ miles
up the supposed river, to a point on the western shore, where a
few detached rocks to the northward protected us from the force
of the tide. We anchored in 10 fathoms water at about 50 yards
from a rocky precipitous shore, about 30 minutes after sundown.
At one mile from the entrance of this passage, on the eastern
shore, there was a broad water-course, with mangrove swamps on
either side, trending from east by south.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 23.&mdash;Before breakfast a party went on shore,
and in an hour returned with numerous specimens of the flora,
together with geological and other specimens. Of the geological
collection, by far the most interesting were the basaltic
fragments. At 9 <span class="aa">a.m.</span> the tide was ebbing
rapidly. After breakfast another boating party returned with many
specimens of coral and sponge alive, obtained from just below
low-water line; also a trochus and triton, both of which I
believe to be undescribed species; rock-oysters were found
adhering in large clumps to the rocks and to each other, but they
were of small size. At a quarter past 10 <span class=
"aa">a.m.</span>, we fired a gun as a signal to the land party,
who forthwith came on board, just as the anchor was weighed at
the commencement of flood-tide. The passage here is little more
than half a mile wide. About two miles to the north of our
anchorage a reef of rocks came out into mid-stream. Through the
passage, in soundings of from 8 to 17 fathoms, the tide was now
rushing with immense velocity; at one time it took three men at
the tiller to keep the vessel under command. Sailing through this
critical pass, not more than a quarter of a mile in width, the
stream opened to a wide expanse of water about 6 miles in
breadth, from east to west, with an apparently clear extent to
north of about 9 miles. There seems to be an opening to seaward
on the south-west boundary. This splendid sheet of water we
propose to name George Water: there was barely a ripple upon its
surface, and during the afternoon we were sailing gently through
with a scarcely perceptible tide, at a rate varying from two to
three knots, and in soundings exceeding 15 fathoms. On our
passage we observed dolphins, seals (<i>Phoc&oelig;na
vulgaris</i> and <i>Leptonyx weddellii</i>), and many aquatic
snakes (both <i>hydrophides</i> and <i>hydri</i>). At 3.30
<span class="aa">p.m.</span> the water shoaled rapidly to six
fathoms; the vessel was put about immediately, and we then
anchored in east longitude 124° 39' 15", and south latitude 15°
45' 40". Before us stretched a long line of mangroves with
several openings: one of the latter a little westward of our
course. As soon as possible after coming to anchor, the boat
party, as yesterday, left with provisions and equipment, for 24
hours, to search for a navigable passage to that portion of the
river which had been seen by Grey; from which point we cannot now
be distant more than ten miles in a straight line. The force of
the tide, strange to say, is not much diminished here; further
observations may, perhaps, show the reason why. At 8 <span class=
"aa">p.m.</span> the boat party returned; they had found the
passage N.N.W. of our anchorage to be navigable, with a muddy
bottom, and boundaries on either side of mangrove banks. At a
distance of about four miles from the vessel, the water-course
divided at the base of a round hill, up which our explorers
climbed a part of the way; but night coming on, they returned to
the vessel.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 24.&mdash;At 9.25 <span class="aa">a.m.</span>,
the boat party again left to search for an opening to the
eastward of the mangrove bank. The stream immediately before us
has a mud bar, dry at low water, but, from soundings taken last
night, with more than a sufficient depth of water on it at high
water; inside the bar the soundings exceed 15 fathoms. An ibis,
resembling the <i>ibis religiosa</i>, or white ibis, was seen on
the mud bar, but beyond the range of our guns. A curious marine
creature of the order <i>Errantia</i>, family <i>Eunicidæ</i>,
was this day captured alongside the vessel. It may be described
as an elongated and distinctly annulated worm, possessing a well
developed head, furnished with tentacles and eyes, and a mouth
with an armed proboscis. The branchial tufts were developed only
slightly. At 1 <span class="aa">p.m.</span>, the boat party
returned unsuccessful as to their search for a navigable opening;
so, half-an-hour afterwards, we weighed anchor and crossed the
mud bar in from 3 to 4 fathoms water; an hour and a half after
this the ebb-tide commenced, and we cast anchor in 6 fathoms
water about a mile south of the confluence of the two broad
streams immediately before us. Two parties then made preparation
to start directly to examine the two streams. One of them, with
the master of the vessel and one man, went in the long boat, and
undertook the exploring of the western stream; the other, taking
the gig, pulled up the eastern. I belonged to the long-boat
party; we thoroughly examined our water-course and its
tributaries, but we found that all the creeks terminated in
tangled mangroves, through which the boat could not pass. At the
junction on the return trip, we met the party in the gig, equally
unsuccessful: mangroves baffling all in their attempts to get
through. The head of the broad sheet of water we entered
yesterday, so far as we have examined it, consists of numerous
islands, having in many cases their surfaces some distance below
high-water mark. The creeks which intersect these low mud islands
are deep&mdash;from 6 to 17 fathoms&mdash;with steep sides
covered with a dense growth of at least five species of mangrove.
At the head of one of these creeks the water was only brackish at
high water; this fact, coupled with the appearance of flocks of
cockatoos and pigeons, argues the presence of fresh water at no
great distance from our anchorage. A white crested eagle-hawk was
this evening shot, whilst perched upon our topsail yard. Another
white crested hawk, with wings of a rich chocolate brown, the
extremities of the feathers darkening to almost black, was shot,
whilst perched upon a mangrove; this I believe to be an
undescribed species; I have therefore spared time to preserve the
skin and skull. The aquila fucosa we have seen already several
times.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 25.&mdash;At 4 <span class="aa">a.m.</span>, two
boat parties were dispatched. In the long boat, Mr. Cooper and
Mr. A. Brown, with one servant, went to examine a gulley in which
we thought we saw a cascade on the 23rd, with a view to discover
some convenient spot where we might obtain a sufficient supply
(1000 gallons) of fresh water to fill up our tanks; we have only
600 gallons on board now; the stock require a plentiful supply,
as the temperature ranges rather high. The shore party in the gig
consisted of two of our party, with a man to bring the boat back
after they had landed. The shore party were to walk to a high
hill, distant about 5 miles, and from its summit to examine the
country, and if possible discover water communication with that
portion of the Glenelg seen by Grey. The man, after landing the
party, was to return to the vessel and then explore the creeks in
search of fresh water. The gig returned at 8 <span class=
"aa">a.m.</span>, after landing us on a mud-bank where there were
tracks of alligators, both large and small. One large
creature,&mdash;its motion was too rapid to catch more than a
glimpse (although from that glimpse I believe it was an
alligator),&mdash;ran down the mud-bank opposite to which we were
anchored, and with a loud splash plunged into deep water. This
was about the time of sunrise. I watched some time, hoping to see
it again, but in this hope I was disappointed. Parrots,
cockatoos, pigeons, and kingfishers, were all most richly
coloured; they were very numerous here. Small birds, too, not
larger than humming-birds, fluttered about in great numbers.</p>
<p>The morning was occupied in taking observations to determine
the exact position of the vessel. Found the longitude to be 124°
39' 12" E., and latitude 15° 43' 10" S. Found a scarlet-and-black
pea in the pod, with leaves but no flowers. Found a half-ripe
bean floating past the vessel. The long-boat party returned at 1
<span class="aa">p.m.</span> After sailing down the western shore
of the broad reach for a short distance they landed at promising
spots and looked for water; and although they did not find water,
they collected some highly interesting geological specimens.
Finally they landed at the conical red hill, four creeks to the
south of the cascade gully;&mdash;(this latter, by the way, is no
cascade at all&mdash;but merely a vein of greenstone, which,
glistening in the sun, gave us the effect of falling water when
we were about four miles off); but, to continue: the party had
landed and were advanced some distance in the muddy bank of the
little stream, when they overheard natives among the mangroves.
In a few minutes about 20 natives made a bold dash to cut off the
party from the boat. A very numerous body were also seen rapidly
approaching in an opposite direction, that is from the south. The
first body of natives then advanced steadily in line, each with a
spear shipped in a woomera (throwing-stick) and a bundle of
spears held in the left hand. At 15 paces from our party, who had
now covered each his man, the natives were prepared to throw
their spears, as was seen by their left hands being lowered from
the spear about to be thrown. One of them then stepped in
advance, and just as he was in the act of hurling his deadly
weapon, the first shot was fired. Although the native fell, the
rest still advanced steadily. A second then ran forward: he fell
at the firing of the second shot. This made them pause for a
moment and then retreat in all haste behind the mangroves. During
the retreat, a third charge of shot was fired at one poor fellow
in the act of running away; none of the shots proved immediately
fatal. A ludicrous incident in the affair happened to the man in
charge of the boat. He was in the water endeavouring to prevent
the boat grounding when he first saw the natives; he immediately
took up the gun left for his protection, and found it was not
loaded. He at once loaded it, and then discovered there were no
caps left in the boat. The affray commencing, he levelled his
uncapped piece and commenced a series of shouts and grimaces that
rivalled, if they did not excel, those made by the natives. From
these details two conclusions may, I think, be arrived at. First:
That a species of discipline prevails among the natives; this was
evident from the regularity of their advance and retreat, and
their conduct under fire. The use of firearms was apparently
unknown to them; the rifles, judging by their approach to within
a distance of 15 paces, they probably mistook for a kind of club.
Second: That the attack was premeditated, as will be seen from
the following particulars:&mdash;Their personal decoration must
have occupied them some considerable time; their foreheads and
temples were ornamented with the figure of a half-moon, painted
in white. Each man carried a bundle of very long spears. They had
most likely seen us sail by their encampment last Tuesday
afternoon; indeed, we passed so closely as to see plainly that
the place was a native encampment, by the number of small fires,
the smoke from which just curled up above the mangrove and other
trees. After the skirmish our party passed by some of their fires
recently extinguished by scattering about, probably with a view
to conceal their proximity just before the attack. Around their
fires were strewn fragments of greenstone (syenitic) with
conchoidal fractures, broken so as to adapt the cutting edges for
making and pointing their spears, chips and shavings of which lay
in all directions. Specimens were obtained of this greenstone and
also the limestone (a brecciated limestone) which is used, after
burning, as a paint. Several other geological contributions were
brought away from the vicinity; they nearly all belonged to the
primary group.</p>
<p>None of the native weapons were secured, as it was not deemed
expedient to follow them into the mangrove thicket; and the whole
affair from beginning to end occupied so short a space of time
that not one of the party noticed even whether the spears were
barbed or not. The half-moon figure seems to be their war
standard: even the night previous to the encounter we noticed the
shape of the fires on the side of the hill above their camp, to
have a half-moon-like outline. In person the natives were tall,
broad-shouldered, muscular, and exceedingly black. Their hair was
straight and tied at the back of the head. They had no covering
whatever. Our party remained on the spot for about half an hour
afterwards, collecting such botanical and other specimens as lay
in their way. Just before leaving in the boat, the native women
and children, who, from higher ground, had surveyed the attack,
commenced a wail which resembled that fabulous Dutch concert,
where every performer contributed to the harmony by playing his
own melody <i>fortissimo</i>, all commencing at a given signal.
One remark more may be worth recording, perhaps, as it may tend
to prove how little communication takes place between the various
native tribes. When the attacks were made on Grey and Stokes, the
natives invariably retired when a shot was fired, or, at latest,
when the first man fell. Here, however, it was only at the second
shot that some connection between the boat party as a cause, and
the falling of their men, as an effect, seemed to dawn upon them.
The report of the rifles did not produce the slightest hesitation
or sign of fear. The afternoon was occupied in attending to
botanical specimens, securing various packets of seeds, and so
forth. A very pretty gomphrena was among the botanical
collections of to-day.</p>
<p>At 4 <span class="aa">p.m.</span> the land party returned.
From the summit of the hill they had seen the River Glenelg,
distant about six miles to the eastward, and they recognised the
large lagoons with streams running into them, as laid down in
Grey's chart. They also saw the River Gairdner and the land away
to the north as far as Camden Harbour. But the 30 or 40 miles of
low flat country, as shown upon Grey's chart, seemed from the
position of our party to consist of well-grassed ranges of hills,
with here and there fertile flats. The hill from which these
observations were made was about 600 feet above mean sea-level;
but viewed as this part of the country was by Grey from a
distance of 15 miles or more, and at an elevation of 1000 or 1200
feet, it doubtless presented an aspect exactly corresponding to
that mentioned on the chart. The party also sighted the Glenelg
running towards George Water, and also its upper course above the
rapids, taking a general southerly direction. They also observed
a chain of mangrove marshes running from some swamps, on the
northern side of the hill, towards and into Camden Harbour. From
these observations and bearings it is probable the water we are
now in has no navigable communication with the Glenelg nearer
than George Water. Only one opening remains to be examined and
that lies in the north-east corner of George Water, so named
after the discoverer of the inland Glenelg. The inpenetrable
mangrove-swamps forming the northern boundary we propose to name
"Barlee's Impediment", after the Honourable the Colonial
Secretary of Western Australia. More tracks of alligators seen in
the mud to-day.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 26.&mdash;At 9 <span class="aa">a.m.</span> a
large alligator, not less than 20 feet in length, came out from
the mangroves abreast of the vessel and slowly floated along with
the receding tide, just below the surface of the water. With the
binocular glasses we could clearly distinguish the head, eye,
ridges of the back and tail, and observe the slow paddling motion
of the feet. The master of the vessel, whilst out with the
long-boat in search of fresh water, saw a small alligator, about
3 feet in length, on a mud-bank; he fired with shot, but these
glanced from the creature's back as if it had been a coat of
iron. At 10 <span class="aa">a.m.</span> the boats again left to
buoy the stream to an anchorage nearer the spot where they expect
to find fresh water. At noon the boats returned; they found an
abundant supply of fresh water and cut a road through the
mangroves to the water's edge in the creek. The master buoyed the
passage to within a few yards of the road. At 5 <span class=
"aa">p.m.</span> set sail to go up to the new anchorage. Anchored
again in one fathom water, at low tide, about a mile and a half
from last anchorage, up the north-west stream, past the
confluence. The tide even here rises 36 feet. There is plenty of
fresh water in the bush: almost every little gully yields a
supply. It is perfectly fresh, but it has a slightly bitter
taste, only just perceptible. During the night an exceedingly
heavy dew falls here. Lying on the deck to sleep, we are obliged
to make an awning of the mainsail.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 27.&mdash;At daylight the gig, manned by two of
our party, and one of the men, left the vessel, with provisions
for two days, to explore the north-east corner of George Water.
Shortly afterwards all spare hands left in the long-boat with two
hogsheads to fill with fresh water. At 9 <span class=
"aa">a.m.</span> the first trip was accomplished: they brought
back 130 gallons of water. The obtaining of it, however, was very
hard work. They had cut down mangroves from the spring to the
landing-place, a distance of nearly 200 yards, and with the
felled trees they made a corduroy road over the mud: along this
road the water had to be carried in buckets to the boat. The road
was passable on foot for a man carrying two buckets full of
water, but not solid enough to bear a hogshead when filled;
otherwise the watering might speedily have been concluded. I was
left, with the steward only, in charge of the vessel: in the
event of an attack by natives&mdash;here the creek is not 50
yards wide at low water and only 6 feet deep&mdash;I consoled
myself with the belief that if the steward could only load fast
enough we could manage to hold the Foam for some hours. The tide
was still nearly 36 feet here. Only four hogsheads of water were
obtained to-day: the softness of the mud proved a greater
hinderance than was expected.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 28.&mdash;At 1 <span class="aa">a.m.</span> the
gig party returned. They have found a passage into Grey's part of
the Glenelg, through the little bay to the north-east of George
Water; the accurate examination of this bay was abandoned last
Wednesday as unpromising. The Glenelg falls into this bay, which
I intend to name Maitland Bay, by a very narrow mouth, situated
on the eastern side, as I have hitherto firmly believed by every
indication: the appearance of the ranges warranted this
conclusion; and the fact that the chart of our voyage, plotted up
to the present date, leaves a blank of scarcely two miles between
our survey and that of Grey, made the case stronger; the banks of
each part of the river in the two charts trending towards the
other in the most unmistakable manner, and, seemingly, inviting
us to persevere and accomplish their perfect union. This might
have been done three days ago, had a more thorough examination
been made; but Wednesday's search in the same direction proved
useless, solely from over anxiety on the part of the explorers
engaged. They did not deem themselves justified in spending an
hour more in that direction; because (1) the stock of fresh water
(our total consumption exceeds 50 gallons per diem) was getting
low; (2) there seemed but little hope of a navigable river
flowing into Maitland Bay; and (3) to the north of our anchorage
a sufficiently broad and deep stream lay immediately before us.
This, after very accurate and determined examination proving to
terminate by numerous branches in mangrove-creeks, not passable
by the gig, and in many places traced to the very base of the
hills&mdash;this brought about the resolution to undertake the
land exploration of Thursday, and the boat trip of yesterday,
which have resulted so perfectly to our satisfaction.</p>
<p>Before quitting this series of mud-islands and
mangrove-swamps, I could have wished to preserve an accurate
delineation; but inartistic skill suffices not to record
faithfully any of the varied effects. Photography alone could
portray the minutiae; I can only compare the effect to that of a
level country with clumps of varied and exquisitely green trees,
having openings&mdash;now straight&mdash;now
serpentine&mdash;ever graceful; with a ground of crystal
reflecting every leaf with an almost exaggerated accuracy.
Reference to the meteorological journal will shew an almost
entire absence of wind and cloud during the past week. The tides
are regular, and at springs rise 36 feet. High water in the
"Impediment", at full and change, would be, by calculation from
observed tides, at 9 <span class="aa">a.m.</span> But the highest
tides occur three days after the full and change.</p>
<p>At 6 <span class="aa">a.m.</span> got the anchor home and,
towed by the long-boat, proceed south to the mud-bar, <i>en
route</i> to the newly found passage to the known part of the
Glenelg. The south-west passage from George Water to the sea
bears south-west from the anchorage of Tuesday last Native fires
still discernible to the West of Cooper's Creek, but at some
distance inland. Anchored at noon just inside Rocky Island at the
mouth of Maitland Harbour, in the north-east corner of George
Water. At 2.15 <span class="aa">p.m.</span> got the anchor aboard
and attempted to tow with the long-boat, but we could only just
keep our position owing to the force of the tide. At 4.20
<span class="aa">p.m.</span> a slight breeze from the south-east
gave us a slight advance. The shores of Maitland Bay are of old
red sandstone, covered with long coarse grass. Adansoniæ and
Eucalypti prevail. A shrub (in fruit) with a strong lemon odour
was obtained here, as also some varieties of Melaleuca, a white
Hibiscus and some other plants in seed. The soundings in Maitland
Bay averaged 15 fathoms.</p>
<p>The mouth of the Glenelg was entered with some little
difficulty: a reef bars the entrance, but there is a deep channel
near the southern end of the reef. The mouth of the river is
about a quarter of a mile in width for the first mile; and it
takes a general south-east course. There are several small rocky
islands, in this first mile, from 25 to 50 feet in height. The
banks also partake of the same precipitous character. A sudden
bend of the river opens into a reach, having a northerly course
of about four miles; and a width in some places exceeding a mile.
This reach, like the first mile of the river, is studded with
islands and reefs running parallel to the general course. We
anchored to the north of a rocky point on the left bank, about
two miles up the reach, in 5 fathoms water, at 7 <span class=
"aa">p.m.</span> A little to the westward. and northward of the
anchorage, on the right bank, there are mangrove and mud islands;
and, no doubt, there is a tidal communication between this part
of the Glenelg and Barlee's Impediment; at each change of the
tide the set was observed to be stronger in the direction of the
Islands than in the direct course of the river.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 29.&mdash;At the dawn of day, the tide serving, we
hove anchor and continued our upward course. The wind was very
light, so our progress was slow. After passing the northern
termination of the first reach, the rocky banks of the river give
place to mangrove and muddy shores; the belt appearing from the
centre of the stream to be exceedingly dense. The course of the
river also is now generally east by north. At about 1½ mile above
the point the tide turned, and there being no wind we were again
compelled to anchor. Soon after this, the long-boat with a party
of six, left to take soundings and to explore the river. At 4
<span class="aa">p.m.</span> the tide left the vessel aground on
a mud-bank, and in half an hour she canted over to an angle of
30° and remained high and dry. Tracks of alligators from the
river up the mud are to be seen on the north bank; any one may
easily understand, after an examination of mud-banks such as this
on which we grounded, how fossil tracks were preserved until they
were sufficiently hardened; here, on all sides, notwithstanding
the rush of tidal waters, tracks we know to be at least two tides
old, remain as fresh and as perfect as if just made. This we
observe both in the case of birds and heavy reptiles.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 30.&mdash;About 1 <span class="aa">a.m.</span>,
the long-boat party returned, having gone up the river as far as
the first rapids. They landed on the country marked in Grey's
chart "rich alluvial soil"; they found it level and covered with
luxuriant grass, in some places 9 feet high: in other places not
exceeding 3 feet and apparently adapted to the keeping of sheep.
They found fresh water in abundance and a second series of rapids
in the river. They report the river itself to contain sufficient
depth of water between half tides to sail the <i>Flying Foam</i>
up to within a short distance of the first rapids. At 7
<span class="aa">a.m.</span> hove the anchor and commenced towing
upwards. At half-past 11 <span class="aa">a.m.</span> got the
vessel entangled among the mangroves to our great hinderance. A
north-east wind, blowing in fitful gusts, ultimately compelled us
to anchor again, having accomplished a distance of not more than
two miles. The tide at ¼ ebb runs two knots per hour. At 5.30
<span class="aa">p.m.</span> aground: the vessel assuming an
angle of not more than 20°. At 11 <span class="aa">p.m.</span>,
in a perfect calm but with a favourable tide, we again hove
anchor, and for two hours drifted along stern foremost, to a
position about one mile to the eastward of Alligator Point, Long
Reach. The river here gradually narrows. The tide flows with
great velocity in the little bend of our evening anchorage.
Duration of flood-tide, 5 hours; of ebb-tide, 7 hours. Rise 28
feet. The mud contains a large proportion of sand at this part of
the river. Mosquitoes are both numerous and troublesome.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 1.&mdash;At 1 <span class="aa">a.m.</span> at
anchor in mid-stream in Long Reach in 3¼ fathoms. At daybreak we
found the vessel aground at an angle of about 35°, with a ridge
of-rocks just rising above the mud, and stretching across the
river from north to south, about 200 yards in advance of us.
Ducks flying about, but not within range. At 11.40 <span class=
"aa">a.m.</span> hove anchor. Along the banks of the river at low
water we see clumps of oysters, and a shoal of porpoises has
passed and repassed several times. At noon cast anchor near what
appears a favourable spot for landing stock in three fathoms at
high water. The long-boat with two land parties left to search
along the right bank for a temporary depôt and landing-place. At
sunset the two parties met at the boat, when she was found to be
about 20 feet above the water-level at the time. The mud seemed
very slippery, so a line was sent from the vessel, and, the
travellers having seated themselves, a slight impetus was given
to the boat, when she glided down the mud at a flying pace into
the water without the slightest mishap. Had the temperature been
120° lower, we might have fancied ourselves witnessing the
Russian ice-hill sport. The parties report favourably of the spot
selected for landing the horses, and the men have cut a road
through the mangrove-belt down to the river-bank. In the
afternoon, from the mast-head, took bearings of many of the hills
shown on Grey's chart. Mount Lyell bears E. 28° N., and is
distant about 7¼ miles. At low water we are surrounded by
detached rocks: it was fortunate the anchor happened to be cast
in the midst of a soft mud-bank. At low water the vessel draws 5
feet of <i>mud!</i> The mosquitoes are a perfect torment here. It
is not possible to keep them wholly away: although we sleep in
our clothes, cap and boots included, with thick gloves and veils,
the little pests, assisted in their onslaughts by minute
sandflies, are continually finding their way within our lines. In
fact, our only means of obtaining a few hours' sleep during these
long nights, consist in fortifying our position with an outer
defence of opossum-rugs, with the fur inside; and even under
these apparently favourable circumstances the enemy (occasionally
with success) puts into force every conceivable stratagem with a
view to surprise us. The flood-tide commenced at 11.15
<span class="aa">p.m.</span>, and in twenty minutes the vessel
was afloat; after the first hour of flood, the rush of tide
diminished and kept steadily on for three hours more, when the
usual eight hours of ebb commenced.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 2.&mdash;Before breakfast, two of the party landed
on the south bank to see what game could be obtained; after an
hour's absence they returned laden with spoil. One of two fine
cranes shot by them measured from tip to tip of wings, 7 ft.;
height, standing, 5 ft. 6 in; from claw to lower end of femur, 1
ft. 3 in.; length of femur, 1 ft. 1½ in: colour, rose or French
grey, with a rose blush. Besides these, there were ducks, geese,
and a teal. These birds were obtained from the swamps in the
summer bed of the Glenelg, left bank; 1 never saw so many
varieties of birds or in numbers so great, in any other part of
the world. For breakfast we had geese obtained in a raid last
night; they were of excellent flavour, but not fat: perhaps they
are scarcely in season at present. The ducks are exquisite
eating; they fly over from one side of the river to the other in
vast flocks. At 45 minutes after noon we commenced landing the
horses, and in an hour they were all safe ashore, in very fair
condition. Not one of them has suffered more from the voyage than
a week's rest and green food will remedy. The landing, although
conducted in rather an every-man-his-own-master style, was
certainly as smart and as successful a work as could be wished.
At 3 <span class="aa">p.m.</span>, five of the party started with
the seven horses to travel up the right bank of the river to the
spot selected for the temporary depôt, whilst the long-boat under
the guidance of the master of the vessel carried a load of
provisions and stores by water. The long boat returned at sunset
having left the depôt party with the horses safely encamped.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 3.&mdash;A watering party went to the rapids with
two hogsheads. They returned at 4 <span class="aa">p.m.</span>,
having been detained only by the tide. Preparing now for bush
exploration. We propose first to examine the country between this
and Camden Harbour. Amongst many highly interesting botanical
treasures secured this day, I find a very beautiful bunch of
flowers gathered from one of the numerous white acacias, which we
here find growing plentifully on the banks of every fresh-water
stream. It is generally associated with the palm. As the palm
alone here seems to be an unfailing indicator of fresh water, so
this acacia would appear to be a finger-post to point out streams
plentifully supplied and constant. The tree here attains a height
varying from 15 to 30 feet; but at a mile or two of distance from
the mangrove-belt which fringes every salt-water stream, it
attains, in some instances, a height exceeding 100 feet. In every
detail it answers to the description of Mr. F.
Gregory&mdash;"very handsome tree, resembling an ash. . . . .
bearing a beautiful white flower, 4 to 5 inches across, having on
the inside a delicate tinge of yellow, and yielding a sweet scent
like violets."* Some bunches of this exquisitely beautiful flower
measured 3 + 2 + 2 feet. Where several of these trees happened to
be in flower, in close proximity, the violet-like odour was
perceptible at a great distance. Our old friend the very
beautiful pea,&mdash;of a bright scarlet colour, with a jet-black
spot on one end, is still met with in every ramble ashore. These
peas appear from the seed-pods to be precisely similar to those
of <i>Abrus precatorius</i> which come from the East and West
Indies, where they are used as beads. The leaves and root of this
plant taste like liquorice. In the West Indies the <i>Abrus
precatorius</i> is called wild liquorice. The roots abound in
sugar, and from experiments made since the return of the
expedition, I believe them a perfect substitute for liquorice in
every respect. These beautiful seeds are strung for necklaces and
other ornaments by the people of both Indies. Their specific name
(<i>precatorius</i>) was given from the fact of their being
occasionally made into Rosaries. De Candolle, speaking of the
<i>Abrus</i>, says, "these plants attain a height of about 9 ft.
The seed is a wholesome pulse." Hughes, in his 'Natural History
of Barbadoes,' treating of <i>Cajanus flavus</i>, a pea most
closely allied to A. <i>precatorius</i>, says:&mdash;"I know of
no part of this shrub but what is of some use. The wood is good
for fuel, and by the often falling of its numerous leaves the
land it grows upon is very much enriched; and its fruit is of
great service by affording hearty, nourishing food to man and
beast. The peas, green or dry, are boiled and eaten, and esteemed
very wholesome, especially if eaten in the wet time of the year;
for, being of a binding quality, they prevent diarrhoeas and
dysenteries, so common in wet seasons. The branches, with the
ripe seeds and leaves, are given to feed hogs, horses, and other
cattle, which grow very fat upon them." Nearly every word of what
is-here said of C. <i>flavus</i> applies to the pea now found
growing abundantly in the Glenelg district. Here, too, the
aborigines have discovered the valuable properties of this useful
legume: for on the 31st July, on an island in Collier Bay, many
pods of this pea were found among the remains of a native feast,
although no plants were observed growing upon the island.</p>
<p class="foot">[* 'Journal of the North-Western Australia
Exploring Expedition,' F. Gregory, p. 18.]</p>
<p><i>July</i> 4.&mdash;Went to the depôt in the gig: it is just
below the first rapids, on the north or right bank of the
Glenelg, and within the limit of the summer bed: not a very nice
spot. The grass is plentiful, but rank: so much so that the
horses feed away to sweeter grass growing within a very short
distance to the north and east. Mount Lyell is just visible among
the trees, distant about 4½ miles north-east. Camden Harbour
would seem to bear W. 33° N. from us, and to be distant about 18
miles in a right line; but so many ranges of high hills
intervene, that we have no expectation of seeing the sea-coast in
that direction, until we are within a distance of a few miles. In
some fresh-water pools around the encampment, a lily of great
beauty grows abundantly.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 5.&mdash;'At 8 <span class="aa">a.m.</span>
walked to a hill about a mile and a half W. 11¼ N., to seek
ground for the measurement of a base line, but no suitable
locality was found. The hill proved very rugged; in some places
the stones had sharply cutting edges, in others they were rounded
and loose,&mdash;piled in heaps; in all cases, owing to the
luxuriant clothing of grass, they were seldom seen before they
were felt. There is no great variety of grasses on our route of
this morning, but all are thickly growing, and in height run from
3 to 7 feet Nearly all the hills appear grassed to their summits.
This hill, which by Grey's chart is in a line with our depôt and
Mount Yule, afforded no extent of view to the north; a higher
range, about two miles distant cut off our view in that
direction; but to the east our range of view extended to Mount
Lyell and its neighbouring hills. The horses are eating better
to-day; it was, of course, no more than might be expected that
horses after being on board ship for a month, and being in the
mean time transferred to a new country, should, when landed, eat
sparingly at first of their new food. Even the sheep to-day
looked round bewildered, and showed but little disposition to
eat. They cannot understand at first that grass four feet high,
somewhat coarse and dry, as it is near the depôt, from the
advanced period of the season, is their destined food for the
future. But in a few days all kinds of stock will feed amply
here. The little tree with melon-like seed-pod and lemon odour is
now in flower all about these hills. Its yellow flowers and
leafless stem look very curious as they peer above the high
grass. I saw no specimen exceeding 9 ft. in height. Walking among
the acacias after sunset reminds one acutely of the little
violets in the old country. In the afternoon sought for beetles,
but after a diligent search, extending over nearly four hours, I
was only rewarded with two or three small specimens. A few
Geocores and Mantidæ were seen, but not captured. Whilst hunting
for insects, I came across a dead tree with the bark off, for a
space of 3 ft. 6 in. all round. I tested the wood with an
axe&mdash;it was exceedingly hard, and made the axe rebound. The
barking I do not think to be the work of aborigines, as it is so
regularly done, and apparently with a keener edge than the stone
axe of the Australian native. As our camp is situated close to
the Rapids, as the tree is much older than any of the trees in
the immediate vicinity, and would therefore be selected for
marking by any white man, and, as Grey's route on my copy of his
chart runs close to this spot, I am convinced that the tree is
one marked by Grey's party.</p>

<h3>LAND EXPLORATION TO CAMDEN HARBOUR.</h3>
<p><i>July</i> 6.&mdash;At 7 <span class="aa">a.m.</span>,
barometer 30.105; thermometer 55.8; wind 0, cloud 0. Yesterday I
found a plant that had the smell and taste of mint, and another
that smelt strongly of musk. At 9.30 left camp with two of our
party, three saddle and two pack-horses, with a fortnight's
provision, having for our object to reach Camden Harbour, and
examine the country between the Glenelg and the sea along the
north-west and north boundaries of the district. Hanover Bay and
the Prince Regent's River we do not at present intend to explore.
I should describe the country between our starting-point and our
noon camp as well fitted for sheep, especially after the present
growth of grass has been burned&mdash;as for feeding it down, it
would be impossible. The riding over it now is very rough work,
because we keep as nearly as possible to our proposed course N.
57° W., over hill and valley; but if the object was to find an
easy road, I can see no difficulty whatever. Pitched our camp at
5 <span class="aa">p.m.</span> on the western branch of the
Gairdner River. The afternoon's march has been much easier than
that of the morning, and we have passed over a greater distance
(6 miles) with less fatigue to our horses. From the summit of a
range 600 to 700 ft. high, a beautiful prospect was obtained. The
whole of this day's track lies through a splendidly grassed
country; few birds have been seen, but kangaroo and turkeys have
been noticed beyond range. My two companions ascended a hill to
the west, and from the top they could see the line of swamps
extending towards Camden Harbour. During the night a heavy dew
fell, and some birds, uttering a cry I could not recognise, flew
over our camp.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 7.&mdash;Started at 7 <span class=
"aa">a.m.</span>; country good at first and easy to travel over;
rode two miles to the foot of a double-cone hill, 500 feet high,
then turning westward 3¼ miles round the base of two hills, one
of them 700 feet in height, and 2½ miles north of fine country to
another hill 800 feet high, from which we had a magnificent view
of sea and islands in Brecknock and Camden Harbours, with arms of
the sea both north and south. From the hill to our camp, one
mile, the country was exceedingly rugged, with steep hills coming
almost to an edge up and down. In a rocky gully of coarse red
sandstone I obtained a large collection of shells. The grass was
rather coarse and rank, like coarse wheat-straw; the country more
rugged, but still easy and well grassed; noticed some poor
sandal-wood, also acacia, baobab, and palms, and a rose-like
vine. Good water, probably permanent, is found wherever palms are
seen. Camped near the southern arm of the sea, which terminates
in mangrove-swamps running towards a remarkable conical hill
nearly due south.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 8.&mdash;Travelled over a country with perfectly
easy succession of undulations, then crossing the heads of
several tidal creeks with mangroves, one of which we attempted to
cross but failed, found a particularly easy country with gravelly
soil stretching quite across the neck of the peninsula towards.
Camden Harbour. It was singular that our route of yesterday
should have been so remarkably rough; we chose it because it
appeared the better of the two, but our march of to-day, although
only a short distance from it, may be considered quite easy and
well grassed. At 1 <span class="aa">p.m.</span>, ascended a hill
and took bearings; pack-horses and all went up here; we had a
magnificent view of Brecknock Harbour; the green islands studding
it and its silvery unruffled surface, from the position in which
we stood could only be compared to emeralds in a broad setting of
silver. The view was so enchanting that I unwillingly ceased
gazing at it to resume the dry work of taking observations.
Camden Harbour is somewhat disappointing, it seems, as we look
down upon it, so small after those magnificent sheets of water
Collier Bay, Doubtful Harbour, George Water, and others. From
Camp 4 we passed to a hill about one mile south-east of Camden
Harbour, 600 feet high, and then on our return route to Camp 6,
half a mile south-east, where we noticed a remarkable geological
formation&mdash;quartz veins through sandstone. At 4 <span class=
"aa">p.m.</span>, resumed march 2½ miles west to the southern
heads of Brecknock Harbour, and after passing very tolerable
country formed Camp 7 in a well grassed and watered locality.
During the night some heavy four-footed animal trotted past at no
great distance from our camp, to the great terror of Peter, the
pony. I am curious to know what creature it could be; it was
evidently a heavy beast, and its motion I noticed very carefully,
and can only compare it to a distinct trot. Butterflies abundant
and beautifully coloured, but I do not catch as I cannot preserve
them.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 9.&mdash;At 8 <span class="aa">a.m.</span>, <i>en
route</i> passing over a particularly easy country, chiefly with
a gravelly soil of quartz, ironstone, old red sandstone, and
trap. Here and there this easy country was cut by belts of strong
country with coarse grass, but still not so rough in any place
that a bullock or horse team could not travel all the way.
Passing south of the double-coned hill, we made a course east by
south, cutting all the little streams that drain the MacDonald
Range, under which we camped at noon on the most eastern bend of
the Gairdner. Under the range there was fine grass and large
timber; the river has permanent water; in some of the pools was a
carpet of lilies in flower; palms abundant, water excellent, and
characeæ and other water-plants numerous. At 3.30 <span class=
"aa">p.m.</span> resumed the march 4¾ miles to the first of the
streams rising in the MacDonald Range and flowing into the
Glenelg, over magnificently grassed downs, gently undulating, but
elevated 240 feet above mean sea-level, which I proposed calling
"Hampton Downs"; they divide the streams falling into the
Gairdner and Glenelg. Exquisite palms all around our camp.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 10.&mdash;To the Depôt camp. All the country we
passed over is beautifully grassed, but as we approached the
depôt the grass became coarser; the soil is a rich alluvium
nearly the whole distance. We found all well in camp. The parties
looking for land seem disinclined at present to leave a depôt
party here, but this is a magnificently grassed and well-watered
country, with a practicable natural dray-route all the distance
from Camden Harbour to this depôt. The whole of our route during
the past week is fringed by timber of sufficient size and in
sufficient quantities for all building and pastoral purposes for
many years to come; we have already seen 300,000 acres of land of
the finest quality for grazing, and at present, although it is
now drawing near to the close of the dry season, clothed with
grass of the most luxuriant growth. During our march of this
morning there were places where, as we rode along, we could not
see each other for the grass; in fact the grass-seed was at least
three feet above our heads. It is the opinion of us all that the
lowest estimate of the carrying power of this district is a sheep
to an acre, therefore 300,000 sheep might be fed upon it; but in
this estimate of land we do not include the sandstone ranges we
have seen, which, although so precipitous as to be impassable
save on foot, are still well grassed and available to the
depasturing of sheep, and in process of time, as the more easily
traversed land becomes stocked, would naturally be included in
the runs. But to what extent the ranges would increase the
pastoral lands of the district north and north-west of the
Glenelg, it is impossible now to conjecture; it is very easy,
however, to foresee that in a short period after the settling of
the country, ramblers in search of game, or shepherds would
discover easy passes through them, and feeding valleys to their
summits. Another matter worthy of notice&mdash;we have not yet
seen one of the many poisonous plants, the bane of the south of
this colony, and to eyes so well accustomed as ours to the
various kinds, they would if here, before this, doubtless have
become apparent.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 11.&mdash;On board the vessel; found all the
collections of specimens I had left behind excessively damp, and
the botanical ones I fear spoilt. During the last night the
mosquitoes prevented all chance of sleep, in spite of smoke or
any attempts at covering ourselves up. In the morning a shooting
party left for the lagoons on the south side of the Glenelg,
returning at noon with a goodly supply of game. One of the
silver-grey cranes measured 7 feet 6 inches from tip to tip of
wing, and 5 feet 10 inches from toe to beak.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 12.&mdash;A day of rest.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 13.&mdash;Went to the depôt, as it is proposed to
start this day on the south and west exploration; on our way up
in the long-boat saw eleven alligators on the mud banks, some we
estimated at 6 feet, others at 25 feet in length. Left the depôt
at 2.30. <span class="aa">p.m.</span> with two saddle and one
pack horse, carrying a fortnight's provisions. By a direct course
steered for Mount Lyell, distant 4¼ miles from depôt, and visible
all the way; reached it an hour before sunset, camped and then
ascended to the summit. It has changed its appearance very much
since Lieutenant Grey described it, and is now clothed with grass
and trees; from a clump of huge stones on the apex we had a
magnificent view of the surrounding country, extending over the
Prince Regent River on one side and the Glenelg district on the
other.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 14.&mdash;Left our camp at the foot of Mount Lyell
and steered a course generally S. 20° E. until noon, 4½ miles.
The first mile was over very rough but well-grassed country, with
the largest timber we have yet seen, and water everywhere; the
last camp was our first experience of water without palms, there
replaced by three species of acacia. The second mile was over an
excellent grassed and well watered country, the third and fourth
the same, but larger timber; the last half mile was over sandy
and rocky country very difficult to travel over, having deep
creeks and water-holes equally difficult to cross. When we struck
the Glenelg it was at a fine deep reach, one-eighth of a mile
broad, with little current in it, and its sides were fringed with
lofty eucalyptus and cajeput trees, with fine grass down to the
water's edge. Many new flowering trees were passed to-day, and
kangaroo seen several times. Palms everywhere around us. In the
afternoon, after two hours' particularly difficult travelling
both for selves and horses, we only made one mile, and camped in
a gully running into the Glenelg; we ascended the hill, out of
which the gully runs; it was nearly all stones piled loosely, and
spinifex here and there, but with a fair proportion of feed. I
was astonished to find a very fine acacia growing among the pile
of stones on the top of the hill, sufficiently large to enable us
both to climb it, and, sitting among the branches, to take
bearings. Here are rapids in the Glenelg, which in the rainy
season must afford a magnificent landscape, as the fall in the
rocky bed is not less than 50 feet Fish in the river and the
water extremely good.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 15.&mdash;<i>En route</i>, steering a general
course of S. 20° E. After travelling an eighth of a mile we
entered what we may well call "the Happy Valley;" this was a
valley running to the southward, of no great breadth (say an
eighth of a mile in the widest), clothed with a very carpet of
green grasses. The first pines we had seen here fringed our track
and formed, with the old red sandstone walls bounding the valley
on either side, picturesque clumps of eights and tens
intermingled with palms, acacia, eucalypti, and melaleuca, of
great variety and beauty. A deliciously cool and clear stream of
water flowed everywhere copiously along the valley; we disturbed
birds of varied hue, but mostly of brilliant colours; one kind of
parrot struck me as peculiarly beautiful, the head and tail of
bright green, the wings of a silvery grey hue; pigeons were
numerous, but small; at the upper end of the valley two stately
emus, at different intervals, gave us first an inquiring and
suspicious examination, and then in turn afforded us an
opportunity of observing their powers of retreating. The "Happy
Valley" terminated in a happier circular plain of about half a
mile diameter, covered with the most luxuriant grass, not less
than three feet in height and perfectly level; this plain was
bounded by timber of different kinds and a wall, broken here and
there, of old red sandstone behind the trees; the first Banksias
we met with grew here. From the plain we ran up a creek bounded
by rocky walls to its source in the dividing range, the route
being over a chocolate-coloured sandy detritus; the neighbourhood
had been lately burnt, was easy to travel over, well watered and
grassed, and had an abundance of fine timber. Our afternoon
course was over exceedingly difficult country for three quarters
of a mile, then, branching westward, to a gully running parallel
to that of the morning, we continued our course over a similar
country until we arrived at a large flat, where we camped for the
night. Just before making camp we saw extraordinary proofs of the
recent presence of some very large, and, I should say from the
tracks, five-toed herbivorous animal; during the day we saw a
large stone-coloured snake, black cockatoos, and numerous
kangaroos.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 16.&mdash;My companion went to the top of the
range bounding the eastern side of the swamp, and on his return
reported that the country S. 30 ° W. promised easier travelling,
and we therefore started on that course. After crossing the
Glenelg and a most important tributary, at a spot which we
denominated "Rocky Springs", we camped. An entomological research
produced me only 30 coleoptera, of three or four species; a
beautiful white moth with red markings rewarded me. Native fires
sprung up in all directions towards sunset; it is evident the
aborigines are close to us.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 17.&mdash;Ascended a hill 1300 feet high. There
are between this range and the Prince Regent River three distinct
high ranges; one about 12 miles S. 20° E. appeared clothed with
grass of the colour of that on Mount Sturt, and apparently as
coarse. All the country within this radius of 12 miles I should
describe as second-rate compared with the country north-west of
the Glenelg, but still it was well grassed on the strong ridges,
and magnificently grassed on the flats; it is equally well
watered, and possesses finer timber. The hill is singularly
uninteresting in a scientific point of view, no specimen of any
kind having been collected upon it except the cast skin of a
small lizard; no flowers, no insects, except ants and flies; the
latter are a daily pest except when travelling; a few butterflies
alone gave colour to the eye; clumps of spinifex appear towards
the apex.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 18.&mdash;Returned to the last camp, taking a more
southerly route. Thence N. 30° 10' W. to the Rocky Springs,
passing through some rich alluvial flats, having on our left a
stony range well grassed and timbered. We have several climatic
nuisances&mdash;flies by day, mosquitoes by night, and ticks
manifold both by day and night; beyond these trifling
discomforts, the climate, since we passed the north-west Cape,
may be described as heavenly; only just warm enough in the middle
of the day to make shade preferable to sunshine, and the nights
delightfully cool but not cold.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 19.&mdash;Whilst gathering palm-leaves to make a
fire, I noticed a very beautiful wasp's nest pedicillated
delicately to the under side of the green leaves; I was almost
too late, however, when I returned, to effect the capture of one
or two specimens; they seemed quite indignant at the intrusion,
and threatened dire vengeance if molested. The capture of one or
two of the ringleaders soon caused the rest to retreat, leaving
their city with its inhabitants, in every stage of waspdom from
the egg to the larvæ, an easy prey to my spirit bottle. Started,
and by picking our way carefully up and down the gullies crossed
the Glenelg, by cutting down the palm jungle, after an hour's
hard work, camped 1½ mile further on, having only accomplished 4¾
miles direct, at 1.30 <span class="aa">p.m.</span>, owing to one
of the horses having been severely cut the previous day. All the
ground passed over during the last three days has been recently
burned by the natives. The bed of the river here is drift sand,
indicating a river-bed in the summer of 300 to 400 yards in
width, fringed by lofty cajeput, eucalypti, acacia, and
occasionally dense palm-jungle. I noticed one fine white
gum-tree. After dinner I went upon an entomological tour about a
mile down the rivulet towards the Glenelg, but with partial
success only as to beetles, there being so few flowering trees
and shrubs in blossom at this season. In places here the white
ants are very numerous, and their hills are frequently from 5 to
6 feet in height with a diameter almost equal to the height.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 20.&mdash;The period of sunrise here is a daily
feast: a cloudless sky, not a zephyr stirring with sufficient
force to move the smallest leaflet, and a temperature perfectly
enjoyable, even clad, as we were, in our travelling garments,
which are simply our usual under-clothing, boots, trousers, and
outer Crimean shirt, a silk neckerchief, which serves as a cap at
night, a light cloth cap, with calico cover cut after the Indian
mode, with a well-projecting peak to protect the eyes from the
noon-day glare, and a veil about 10 inches square rolled round
the cap, except when flies and mosquitoes are troublesome; these,
with stout leather gloves only worn on state occasions, such as
breaking a road through prickly bush-rose vine, acacias, or
palms, complete our toilet of every day and Sunday. Started at
9.15 <span class="aa">a.m.</span>, and after crossing two broad
reaches of water at 1 <span class="aa">a.m.</span> crossed our
southern track and thence pursued our route down the Happy
Valley, whence we passed over 2 miles of stony ridges and 2½
miles of easy well-grassed country, and camped on the
Glenelg.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 21.&mdash;Travelled over easy-grassed country as
far as Mount Sturt, where we were long delayed hi crossing the
Glenelg, and by a reedy swamp running into the broad stream near
Mount Sturt; reached the depôt about noon. Went to the vessel to
pack away specimens and returned with instruments for measuring a
base line, and took lunar distances in the evening to determine
the exact position of the depôt. Since our departure all hands at
the depôt have been occupied in cutting grass for hay, any
quantity of. which is at present to be had for the cutting, and
it is of good quality and in such profusion all around us that
ships might obtain cargoes of it as quickly as it would be cut,
made, and pressed into bales. One of the first objects that met
our eye was a tolerably neat press, erected in the midst of the
camp, after the manner of a primitive wool-press; close beside
the press lay six wool-bales of well-pressed hay, and about a ton
of loose. During our absence a good addition has been made to my
geological collection, which now includes what I take to be a
fair number of specimens of the chief geological treasures
brought from the hills by the summer floods of past centuries;
many are of a highly interesting nature, either from their
exhibiting the general geological features of the district, or
from some peculiarity of conformation of strata or crystalline
arrangement.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 22.&mdash;The party propose to send some of the
hay on board to-day, from this I presume it to be their intention
to reship some if not all of the horses, which I cannot think a
wise proceeding, for these reasons: first, because a district of
unsurpassed fertility has been found and traversed, possessing
abundance of feed and water for half a million of sheep, together
with timber in far larger quantities than will ever be required
for building and fencing purposes; a district blessed with a
climate which, at this season of the year, is a joy to live in,
with evidences of continual and periodical summer rains of
sufficient amount to warrant us in the supposition that this is
no exceptional year of fertility, but that an annual supply of
grass of a like quality and in no less quantity might reasonably
be predicated; a district having a fine and securely land-locked
harbour in Brecknock Bay, with a country of almost unequalled
fertility immediately adjoining, and fit without road-making to
drive a bullock or horse team over it at once so far as even to
the very centre of the district: a district having a river
leading from the southern harbour, in Doubtful Bay, to the very
heart of the grazing country&mdash;a river I should describe as
safe and easy to navigate with cargo-boat, or a small steamer,
from George Water to the rapids, and south of the actual
river-entrance in the north-east corner of George Water,
perfectly secure for vessels of any class or size, especially if
the south-west opening of George Water into the sea should prove,
on our return trip, to be wider and less tortuous than the
entrance through which we sailed from Doubtful Bay. Here I must
admit that although the Flying Foam came safely through the
passage, and the actual river entrance from George Water, still
the work was hazardous (doubly so then from the fact of ours
being the first soundings taken there), but even now, viewed from
the most favourable point, a work fraught with visible dangers to
any vessels larger than cargo-boats of 10 to 15 tons. At 10.30
started with Mr. Aubry Brown to measure a base line south of
Mount Yule. During the whole day it was exceedingly sultry; being
on a low mud-flat only just above low-water mark, without wind or
cloud, we certainly felt the heat more than on any day since we
landed in the Glenelg district. After finishing our chain line
and solar observations, we discovered a convolvulus with the
leaves and vine dry and dead, twined round a mangrove; the-seed
was quite ripe; the signal for our recall sounded from the ship,
the tide was then high enough for us to get on board without
difficulty. Our usual mode of going on board from the mud-banks
has been by a process, compared with which a mud-lark's trade on
the Thames is clean work, much more pleasantly described than
performed, but this is a favourable description of the process:
after a toilsome walk along the northern margin of the mangroves
we reach a spot where, at low tide, we are just able to wade
through the mud and spots of water left by the previous tide, and
then by a decidedly muddy and circuitous route reach a road
cleared through the mangroves to the edge of the mud-bank proper,
when, although we have a road-way paved with mangrove-logs, we
sink up to our knees on a bluish grey mud of the consistency of
dough, and in some places a man would sink over head in it if
unacquainted with the geography, and then by a series of
ungraceful evolutions glide alongside or into the boat to be put
on board the vessel, objects to be carefully shunned and
commiserated; we wash and change our garments and sit down
perfect <i>bonnes bouches</i> for the mosquitoes. In early
evening, that is by the liberal use of smouldering rags, we
obtained a respite from the mosquito nuisance, but from that hour
throughout the night an unceasing hum was kept up by clouds of
these pests hovering about our heads, but wholly defeated in my
case by the manner in which I was packed up in my rug on deck; as
to sleeping below, of course no one has been so venturesome as to
attempt it during the past month.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 23.&mdash;This morning I found an entomological
treasure in the shape of a tick upon my left arm: it was in the
same condition as we usually find them&mdash;the head buried in
the skin immediately over a vein, and its body swollen with its
stolen food; it was larger than those we found on the Upper
Glenelg. I tried the experiment of making it disengage itself by
putting the lighted end of a match to its body; but it required a
second application before it would show any signs of
relinquishing its hold. This individual seemed unfitted for the
experiment of drowning by oil from the hardness of its epidermis;
but other species, as soon as a drop of oil is placed on them,
disengage themselves quickly, owing, I presume, to the closure of
the spiracles by the oil and the consequent stoppage of their
powers of breathing. As they are frequently met with in many
parts of Australia, and as I am not aware of the existence of any
recorded observations on their anatomy or habits, I think it will
not be time thrown away to take measures to obtain as many
species as possible and make some enquiries into their history,
the more especially as I know no greater plagues to travellers in
these parts of the world. It is not so much the immediate as the
remote consequences that are to be dreaded, for if incautiously
the creature be detached summarily on its discovery, or rubbed
off by the hand, its presence being undetected, its head may
remain in the skin and then there is formed a hard callous lump,
which I have known to become a source of pain and anxiety for two
years after the first formation. Towards sunset two of the horses
and a party arrived from the depôt, and were got on board
preparatory to leaving the river. I am lost in amazement at this
resolve; for granting the cost of leaving a depôt here, I ask
myself, can they expect to find 500,000 acres of land, in any
part of the world, capable of carrying perfectly half a million
of sheep, at a cheaper rate? However our exploration will open to
some future occupants this tract of superb grazing country,
certainly inferior to none in the world that I have seen, and I
have travelled much. In the evening the whole party returned to
the depôt.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 24.&mdash;This morning an alligator was caught
by one of the sailors: it was 6 feet in length, head 1 foot 4
inches, first pair of feet 2 feet 5 inches, second 2 feet 9
inches, circumference 2 feet, and weighed 80 lbs. I skinned and
dissected the creature, preserving the cervical vertebræ, lungs,
skull, and skin. In the afternoon the remainder of the horses
arrived from the depôt and were got on board.</p>

<h3>FROM THE GLENELG RIVER TO COLLIER BAY.</h3>
<p><i>July</i> 25.&mdash;In the early morning the long-boat
went to the depôt for the sheep, and returned at 8 <span class=
"aa">a.m.</span> when they were forthwith put in their pens.
During the day I was employed in cleaning, preserving, and
stuffing the bones and skin of the alligator, a tedious
operation, as some of the smaller bones are so exceedingly thin
that the slightest cut would have easily passed through them. At
dusk we left our anchorage and towed down the river to long. E.
124° 43' 52", S. lat. 15° 43' 8", and stuck fast in the mud at
9.45 <span class="aa">p.m.</span> We did not perceive this bank
on our upward passage, or we might easily have avoided it and
continued to use the tide for another hour. On reference to our
chart of the river we perceive our track runs along the northern
edge of the bank: as shown by the soundings this bank can
scarcely be called a hidden danger, for it consists of a deposit
of mud about a foot in depth lying on a smooth bank of sand, thus
affording a safe berth to any vessel during the receding tide;
but of course if the vessel were not somewhat flat-bottomed she
would have a considerable list For two hours before low tide we
were left high and dry with the river running placidly on either
side of us. This change of anchorage of last night was a boon
appreciated by every individual on board&mdash;we were actually
enabled to sleep with our faces uncovered. Just before leaving
our anchorage a desperate attempt was made to capture a large
alligator floating in the river like a log: one shot from a rifle
was fired and the ball undoubtedly struck the creature somewhere,
for by its rapid lashing of the water we can only suppose that it
was in a flurry, at the very least; but, alas! when the vessel's
gig and a numerous party reached the spot, no reward awaited them
save the view of the still troubled water. One can imagine the
creature, when aroused from its reverie by the leaden messenger,
to give a look of intelligence around it, and on catching a
glimpse at the advancing boat, to resolve, all things being well
considered, to explore the bottom of the stream and recline its
aching head on its customary mud-pillow, at any rate for a
season.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 26.&mdash;At 8 <span class="aa">a.m.</span> left
our anchorage, and by dint of sail and towing proceeded down the
river at a tolerable speed. At 11 <span class="aa">a.m.</span>
ran aground on a mud and sand bank half a mile south-west of our
anchorage of June 6: the vessel was so far fortunate enough in
her choice of a berth, as to have avoided a mass of sandstone
rocks and boulders, which at low water we found immediately east
of us, and against which, if she had struck, an unlucky thumping
would have brought us to a stoppage less easily than the mud did;
moreover the rocky heap was a foot higher than the mud-bank, and
the vessel could not have assumed so upright a posture during the
interval before the flood-tide of the afternoon. The shoal patch
I purpose naming "Sunday Shoal". At low water many of the party
and some of the crew got over the side of the vessel to seek
shells, &amp;c.; they were so far rewarded as to find an abundant
supply of hermit crabs, which were new to many of them. None of
the shells obtained struck me as being very curious or new. The
party on the bank spread far and wide over the ground in quest of
Glenelg treasures,&mdash;I cannot say the treasures of the deep,
for when the vessel grounded the lead proclaimed ¼ less 1. Just
before sunset the vessel, in swinging with the flood-tide, bumped
and grazed upon the rocks in the bed of the river; there are not
two fathoms on the rocks at high water. After sunset we sailed to
a point in the river, long. E. 124° 42' 10", lat. S. 15° 45' 34",
three miles from our anchorage of the 28th June, and then
anchored to await the tide of to-morrow morning, so that we may
have daylight to pass the narrows and rocky islands; it would be
imprudent to attempt the passage in the night owing to the force
of the tide. We observed at our last anchorage that there was a
considerable set of tide out of the opening opposite to which we
were anchored. This would argue some other communication of the
river with the sea, besides that with which we are already
acquainted: this, although a question of great interest, would be
a matter, the solution of which would now be quite foreign to the
object of the present expedition.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 27.&mdash;Sailed at 7.45 <span class=
"aa">a.m.</span> with tide and wind north by east, in our favour;
notwithstanding this it required the boat, manned with four
hands, to keep way upon the vessel from time to time. Cast anchor
in Maitland Bay at 11.20 close to the anchorage of the 28th June.
Nearly the whole party was here engaged in securing a baobab-tree
and collecting seeds. The inner part of the baobab set us all to
work chewing away, some pronouncing it almost as good as
cocoa-nut; but for my own part I think it tasted more like Indian
rubber. At 8 <span class="aa">a.m.</span> sailed and passed
through the channel between the two islands off the southern
extremity of the bay and the main, with soundings all exceeding
10 fathoms. With a variable wind we proceeded down George Water
until 1 <span class="aa">a.m.</span> Tuesday, 28th July, when
both wind and tide leaving us, we anchored in 10 fathoms (mud),
in longitude E. 124° 34' 10", latitude S. 15° 51' 35".</p>
<p><i>July</i> 28.&mdash;After a night of the most refreshing
sleep, so well appreciated by us after our steamed and mosquito
bitten nights on the Glenelg, we arose to see before us what we
desired in the south-west corner of George Water; namely&mdash;a
far wider, shorter, and from this distance we judge, a safer
outlet to the sea than the south-east channel, by which we
entered from Doubtful Bay. Sailed at 11.15 <span class=
"aa">a.m.</span>, calm; at 1 <span class="aa">p.m.</span> a
breeze sprung up, and we began to beat towards the south-west
passage, but at 3.15 <span class="aa">p.m.</span>, just as we had
sighted a series of native fires close by the shore, a loud
grating noise&mdash;whilst I was making entry of the last
sounding ½ 5&mdash;and the sudden stoppage of the vessel showed
us that we were aground on some rocks, where in a few moments the
receding tide left us at an angle of 30°, on a comparatively flat
rock with deep water on either side. The master of the vessel
left in the long-boat to examine the south-west passage, and
after dusk he returned, reporting a deep and safe passage, not as
I supposed, to seaward, but into Doubtful Bay, not very far
distant from the south-east passage. Just before sunset the
natives on shore lighted up many fires, and gave us a "cooee",
but whether of friendship or defiance I know not; however, we
returned the salutation in like form, and continued this pastime
for an hour or so, hoping to entice them, if they possessed
canoes, to pay us a visit. On the return of the long-boat the
propriety of landing and tying up some presents (we had brought
looking-glasses and other trifles with us for the purpose) to the
trees was debated; but it was thought generally, that the
articles, when found, might be taken possession of with the idea
that they had stolen them from us, and that the idea of our
leaving them there intentionally as presents, would involve too
complex a matter for their understanding. When the tide suite,
which will be about 9 <span class="aa">p.m.</span>, the master of
the <i>Flying Foam</i> purposes to sail down the newly explored
channel, so it is very improbable the natives will see us depart.
About 9 <span class="aa">p.m.</span> set sail from the rocks, but
the wind failing, had to tow the vessel down the south-west
channel. It. was a much safer passage from Doubtful Bay into
George Water than the south-east one. The soundings were equally
good, and its width on an average twice that of the other, whilst
there was no dangerous navigation at all to be compared to the
northern extremity of the south-east channel. Two points shown in
the chart were exceedingly rugged, and there were many parts of
the shores precipitous and some cliffs quite perpendicular. We
reached Doubtful Bay in half an hour after midnight, and after
cruising for some little time in search of a wind, anchored
S.S.W. (nearly) of the south-west passage into George Water.</p>

<h3>COLLIER BAY.</h3>
<p><i>July</i> 29.&mdash;An immense whale (humpback) estimated
at 6 to 10 tons, is sporting about the bay. From this anchorage
the two mouths of the Glenelg appear to be in the positions
indicated on Grey's chart, and the shores of the bay and adjacent
islands to be moderately but not precisely correct. At 11
<span class="aa">a.m.</span> sailed with wind and tide into
Collier Bay; the breeze lasted until after sunset and carried us
well up into the bay, but then dropped and left us to the mercy
of the tide, which drifted us back again to the entrance, from
whence it is rather a pretty sight. It is a magnificent sheet of
water; we sailed closer to the eastern shore than the western, as
it was the wish of the party to land and examine the country
sighted from Mount Lizard. What makes the bay so interesting as
we sail along is the beautiful geological sections displayed
every here and there by hills and cliffs; the distance of our
course from the shore is too great to admit of more than a
general recognition of strata, but as I do not purpose
accompanying the party on the preliminary exploration on foot, I
promise myself a ramble along the shores, in the hope of an
augmentation to my various collections. The country at the head
of the bay is remarkably rugged: hills of very irregular
conformation confusedly piled, with here and there a cone of
graceful outline. Beyond all a lofty blue range towers over,
whose summits are rent and split occasionally in a grotesque
manner; lower down towards the level there is now and then a
cubical block of old red sandstone standing quite bare, and,
viewed at a distance over half a mile, looking very like a red
brick house. The soundings up to the present time have all been
good, the leadsman having on no occasion called less than 12
fathoms, and very frequently no bottom at 15 fathoms. Drifted at
8.20 <span class="aa">p.m.</span> into 20 fathoms water, and
there cast anchor for the night. The moonlight is exceedingly
brilliant here; some of our party seated on the deck have more
than once enjoyed a game of chess by moonlight. This comfort of
free exposure of face and hands to the cool evening air after the
muffling up we had recourse to on the Glenelg, during the month
of our river experience (this applies only to the river itself,
mosquitoes being rarities in the bush a mile or so distant)
becomes a boon we well know how to appreciate.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 30.&mdash;At 6 <span class="aa">a.m.</span>, left
the anchorage of last night, and sailed till 8 <span class=
"aa">a.m.</span>, when we anchored in Shoal Bay in 4 fathoms.
Here the long-boat left with a crew of three, and three days'
provisions, with a view to walk to some high hills and examine
the country which appeared so promising from Mount Lizard. Some
of those left on board landed on two of the islands for an hour
or two's stroll in the morning. They found nothing worthy of note
except an abundance of beans and numerous tracks of turtles. They
noted well the spot, however, and intend to re-visit the place
this evening in the hope of surprising one of these turtle
visitors; it will be acceptable to us as a change of food. Close
to the turtle-tracks a vast quantity of fine beans grow; they are
now in every stage of development from the green pod to the
perfectly ripe seed. So 'plentiful are they that we contemplate
sending our spare hands who remain on board to gather some sacks
full; our stock of vegetables has long since been exhausted. They
observed recent tracks of large parties of natives, who beyond
doubt assemble on these islands to feast on the produce of the
sea. A few corals and shells were brought to add to my
collection. About 6 <span class="aa">p.m.</span>, the gig, with a
crew, went to the turtle-bank, but after waiting an hour or so
returned unsuccessful. The long-boat party also returned; the
boat's crew had not taken sufficient provisions to last 24 hours
from the vessel, and 12 of the biscuits of our land party were
lost; hence the return. They report the bay they entered as much
larger than laid down on the chart; it was the hay to the east of
Shoal Bay. They also found a river running into the south-east
corner of this bay, with the first wide reach running about
south-east. They did not get into this river for the reason above
alleged. From a hill on the southern shore of the bay they
sighted a large sheet of water E.N.E., which they thought might
be Doubtful Bay, but on marking the bearings on the chart, it
would appear to be a large sheet of water which would be found
close to the opening opposite to the anchorage of this morning.
The country described agrees so far with our distant view of it
from Mount Lizard. They brought with them three specimens of the
native canoes, which are a step, and that only, in advance of the
single log so frequently used by the Australian aborigines. They
(the canoes&mdash;not the aborigines) consist of three or four
mangrove-sticks, about 6 or 7 feet in length, pegged together
with pine. The ends of all the sticks are carefully sharpened,
and only such sticks as are naturally bent to a suitable shape
appear to be chosen; about the middle of the canoe there is a
pine pin projecting 6 or 7 inches on either side, probably
affording a similar support to the native mariner as a stirrup
does to a horseman. Of course there is no attempt to make a
bottom to the canoe, nor do the specimens brought show the least
sign of ornamentation. There is a red ochreous stain to be
detected upon them here and there, but we account for them as
having been communicated from the persons of the natives coloured
with <i>wilgi</i>, or they may possibly have been designedly
coloured with <i>wilgi</i> (red ochre). They also brought the
first specimen we had seen of a <i>Hakea</i>, some few seeds,
coral, and other natural objects, but nothing remarkably
interesting.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 31.&mdash;At 7 <span class="aa">a.m.</span>, the
long-boat, with an exploring party of six, taking with them a
week's provisions, left the vessel to examine the river supposed
to exist in the south-eastern corner of "Secure Bay", which
latter is laid down in the charts about half its real size. One
of our party and myself, an hour afterwards, left for the turtle
islands; we were, as we expected, too late for the turtles, but
their recent tracks upon the sand and their holes were numerous.
At the upper part of the sandy beach there were the remains of an
aboriginal festival. Many old fire-places, cracking stones,
break-winds, the soft shell of many a turtle's egg, with
fragments of a turtle's carapace, were noticed about the ground.
Near our fire we observed a portion of a native canoe; it was the
thicker end of one of the sticks, standing in the place of the
ribs; from this specimen we suppose the natives to be in
possession of sharp-edged tools, probably made from the same
greenstone which they sharpen their spears with, because the end
of the stick was formed by clean even cuts, with no sign of
scraping; but as they do not require boring tools, the
mangrove-sticks being evidently chosen when dry and capable of
being fastened by driving a sharpened pine peg through them, as a
carpenter would drive a nail through boards, they seem to be
unacquainted with the use of them. Moreover, the pine pegs drive
easily through the dry mangroves, and it is only rarely we find
the sticks split by the process. On the same sand-patch we found
large quantities of the beans, whose creeping runners are of
enormous length, some exceeding 40 paces. As the seed was nearly
ripe I collected 1½ pint, and gathered a few of the green pods
hoping to be able to dry and preserve them. Growing along with
the beans was a convolvulus whose shoots equalled theirs in
length; a small quantity of its seed I also preserved; we could
only find one flower, and that not larger than that of C. major
grown in England; its colour was of a purplish pink, with the
usual deeper tinge of colours towards the centre of each petal.
We then walked up a valley with a water-course having deep stony
holes but no water, nor were there any palms to indicate
permanent water even at a depth below the ground, so that we
imagine the island to be surface-watered, and that alone. When
the natives visit this island in the dry season to enjoy a turtle
feast they must bring the water from the mainland in shells; for
these latter we sought carefully but unsuccessfully.</p>
<p>The formation of the island is old red sandstone and
freestone, the latter of excellent quality; in one or two places
the strata are vertical, but in general the dip is south at an
angle of about 15°. Instances of <i>scoria</i> were occasionally
met with, and between the water-marks, here 37 feet distant, the
formation was evidently volcanic. The trees were not by any means
stunted, the eucalypti attaining a height of 50 feet and upwards,
but all gave evidences of occasional strong winds prevailing
which caused the trunks to grow in anything but a straight line.
The fact was the more apparent to us because we had noticed in
the Glenelg district how very straight all the timber, from the
smallest to the largest, grew. The grass was thin but of good
quality. The surface of the ground being covered with loose
stones we merely walked to the top of the hill, whence we enjoyed
a magnificent view of Collier Bay and our good little vessel at
anchor, a mere speck on the water. We then returned to the sandy
beach and spent a couple of hours in examining the shells and
corals; there were but few good shells, but the specimens of
corals were numerous, and my collection included more than an
average number of species. Foraminifera are rare in the
drift-sand. Towards noon we returned to the boat; <i>en route</i>
to the ship we espied, coming rapidly towards us, a dark object
which from its direction of progress through the water we thought
might possibly be a native crossing the bay on his canoe. As the
line of travelling of this object did not exactly coincide with
our course, we at once steered towards it in the hope of at least
witnessing the mode of propelling and guiding the singular craft
used as a canoe. Great was our disappointment to find our native
and his canoe to be only the roots of a large tree floating
steadily, trunk downwards, through the water; nor was it a little
provoking to find a white spot on the top, on which we had laid
good stress in our predication, turn out to be a sea-bird perched
there and enjoying a quiet sleep until the noise of our approach
awoke him, made him stare a little at our intrusion, and then
take to flight in utter consternation.</p>
<p>At dusk the long-boat and exploring party returned. They had
passed safely through Secure Bay and entered the river passage,
which is very narrow, has an island in the middle and
perpendicular cliffs on both sides, and a tide which ebbs and
flows with wonderful force; passing up the reach they had come to
a second narrow passage of greater velocity and danger than the
former. Here whirlpools were formed by the flowing tide, and only
by the united strength of all on board was the boat prevented
being drawn in; fortunately the passage was clear of rocks, for
the velocity was estimated at 20 miles per hour, and of course
the slightest check or impediment would have dashed the boat to
pieces, and certain death alone would have stared the explorers
in the face. This hurling of the boat through the second passage,
as through a sluice, terminated in the discovery of a large sheet
of water, equal in extent to George Water, bounded on all sides
by mangrove banks and creeks. With difficulty effecting a
landing, they ascended a high hill of a dark purple coloured
granite, on which only scattered tufts of spinifex and stunted
bushes grew, the rest was all bare granite boulders and
fragments, to walk safely over which the greatest attention to
the footing was every moment necessary. From the summit no view
was obtained, save of numerous cones and bluffs of granite
equally bare and difficult to walk over. The large sheet of water
E.N.E. of Secure Bay was not again sighted. On consideration, it
was thought prudent to return to the vessel at once and proceed
to Roebuck Bay, as the corn and water on board the vessel would
not last more than a month from the time we left the Glenelg, and
to reach the country we sighted from Mount Lizard from this point
would certainly make a sad inroad into the stock of provender and
water, and these failing, nothing could be done save the killing
and throwing overboard some, if not all, of the horses.
Therefore, at 8 <span class="aa">p.m.</span>, both boats were
hoisted on board, and all made ready to sail from this bay, <i>en
route</i> to Roebuck Bay, by to-morrow morning's tide. The tide
here to-day rose 36 feet.</p>

Governor of Western Australia, and the Promoters of the
North-Western Expedition of 1864, on the Voyage and the Resources

<p class="foot">[* This Report accompanied the narrative of a
second expedition, in which Mr. Martin was engaged, in 1864,
having the same objects as that of 1863, namely the discovery of
new tracts of pastoral country in North-Western Australia. The
commander of the expedition was Mr. F. K. Panter.]</p>
<p>The voyage from Champion Bay to the anchorage in Brecknock
Harbour occupied 25 days, owing to a succession of light and
contrary winds after passing North-West Cape. During this period
two incidents only call for especial remark; namely, a visit to
Bedout Island, and the discovery of a dangerous reef.</p>
<p>The visit to Bedout Island was resolved upon in consequence of
adverse winds. From careful observations made, the position of
the highest land seems to be in longitude E. 118° 56' 20",
latitude S. 19° 40' 45"; according to the charts, longitude E.
119°, latitude 19° 36' 20"; according to Norrie's list, longitude
E. 118° 52', latitude S. 19° 29'. These data show an extreme
difference in the position of the island amounting to 8 minutes
of longitude and 11 of latitude. Ships sailing in this direction,
therefore, should approach the island cautiously. The island is
about a mile in length; its mean breadth is half a mile. It
appears to be formed as islands are usually formed in the centre
of circular coral-reefs or atolls; it is merely a heap of
coral-sand piled up upon a sandstone point of ancient elevation,
whose dip is about 15° to the westward. This has gradually become
clothed with soil capable of supporting a coarse and stunted
vegetation. The rock forming the basis of the island is a
trappean sandstone composed of particles derived from the
decomposition of greenstones and basalts, consisting chiefly of
feldspar and hornblende grains, devoid of external crystalline
form, with which are mingled quartzose grains and mica-flakes
derived from other sources. The diameter of the encircling reef
is about 3 miles; the space between the reef and the island is
not more than 6 or 7 feet below low-water mark, in any place.
There was no water upon the island. The anchorage 3 miles to the
southward of Bedout Island, in 6 fathoms at low water, is good.
High tide at full and change of the moon occurs at 10.50
<span class="aa">a.m.</span> Rise of tide (spring) 24 feet. The
island is at present the resort of pelicans and turtles.</p>

<br>
<p>On Thursday, the 29th of March, we sighted Caffarelli Island
towards sunset, and sailed a course midway between that island
and the Brue Rock. But at 8.30 <span class="aa">p.m.</span>, it
being very dark and the weather threatening, we shortened sail;
before this was quite accomplished we struck upon a reef. After
striking, the vessel drifted into 25 fathoms water. At 8.45
<span class="aa">p.m.</span> the anchor was let go, with 60
fathoms of chain. Half an hour afterwards it became necessary to
cast a second anchor, with 60 fathoms of heavier cable. During
the night a gale from the S.S.E. gradually sprang up. At noon, on
the 30th March, the smaller of the two cables parted, whereby we
lost the kedge anchor and 70 fathoms of chain. The starboard
anchor, weighing 12 cwt., with 60 fathoms of chain, dragged for
about 30 minutes, when, just as the preparations were made to
unshackle it and try what sails could do, it held; nor did the
most violent bursts of the gale again start it. This reef is not
laid down upon the charts. The point of the reef where we struck
is between 5 and 6 miles from the westernmost point of
Caffarelli; the island bearing E.S.E. The reef, on its northern
and southern sides, is of a flattened horseshoe shape, and it
extends as far as we can see towards Caffarelli. It is awash at
three-quarter flood-tide. According to the charts there should be
a passage of 14 miles here, between the Brue Rock and Caffarelli,
with soundings from 15 to 25 fathoms.</p>

<h3>THE DISTRICT OF THE GLENELG; CLIMATE, EXTENT, PASTORAL
RESOURCES, AND GENERAL CAPABILITIES OF THE SOIL.</h3>
<p>Partially surrounded by sea and deeply indented with noble
harbours, this district, so far as longitude E. 125° 15', may be
said to enjoy a sea climate. The two periods during which
meteorological observations have been made are far too short to
admit of any precise conclusions on climatological questions even
with respect to the particular months during which they were
recorded; but as they do not differ greatly from results which
might have been predicated of the district, taking its
geographical situation alone as argument, they may be of some
slight value, although, doubtless, they will have to undergo many
alterations and corrections hereafter. These observations,
together with our experience of the weather and the appearance of
the country, rivers, and vegetation, all confirm the supposition
that there are two rainy and one dry season in the year. The
first wet season commences about December, and as we find the
country everywhere clothed with the richest vegetation of about a
month or six weeks' growth, whilst young leaves of such trees as
the eucalypti are parched with the sun, it is probable the first
and heaviest rains end in February; to these succeeds a period of
warm clear weather lasting until the end of March, when the sky
again becomes cloud-bearing, but at this season with
thunderstorms only. The mornings of April were almost always
cloudless, or with high cumulus and cirrus of small amount; but
in the afternoon or evening dense banks of cumulus appeared
generally upon the eastern horizon, working up against a westerly
or sea breeze, and terminating nearly every day in a thunderstorm
with rain. These storms rarely lasted more than an hour; they
travelled quickly. In the months of June and July the sky is
again cloudless, and the various grasses ripen slowly: the heat
of the noonday sun being tempered by exceedingly heavy dews and
cool sea-breezes. On one of the hottest days in July (19th),
1863, sitting in the sun or in the shade during midday bivouac
was a matter of indifference, although the thermometers at the
time stood at 122° in the sun and 94° in the shade, at a distance
of 45 miles from the coast-line and at an elevation of only 200
feet above mean sea-level. This, the hottest season of the year,
lasts until the heavy rains in December. During the latter wet
and the succeeding dry seasons the mean temperature appears high;
this is caused by the high readings of the minimum thermometers:
they seldom register less than 80° in April and 65° in June and
July, yet the nights rarely feel oppressive. Lightning to the
east and north-east occurs nearly every night in March, April,
and May. In June and July the days are bright and cloudless: the
nights cool and refreshing. The health of the party has in no
case suffered from climatic causes; slight inflammation of the
conjunctiva has attacked a few who have been subjected to
unavoidable exposure; there has been one case of diarrh&oelig;a,
and one of dysentery,&mdash;both yielded to a single dose of
chlorodyne; and one attack of fever, of a typhoid nature, which
was successfully treated with quinine.</p>
<p>The mean atmospheric pressure, temperature, &amp;c, is shown
in the following Table:&mdash;</p>
<p align="center"><a name="Table-1" id="Table-1"></a><img alt=""

<p>The extent of the known portion of the Glenelg
district&mdash;that is, from the meridian of E. 125° 15' to the
sea-coast, and from the parallel of S. 16° 15', to the latitude
of Camden Harbour&mdash;includes only 2925 square miles; of which
area, deducting one-third for stony ridges, an excessive amount,
and the sea-inlets Doubtful Bay, George Water, &amp;c, 1,000,000
acres are suited to the depasturing of sheep. Of these 1,000,000
acres, about 100,000 acres are adapted to the cultivation of rice
and similar grain; 250,000 acres are especially favourable to the
growth of spices, sugar, tea, and coffee; even cereals at high
altitudes, and at certain seasons of the year, might be grown at
any rate in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements of a
pastoral and agricultural population. It is essentially a
wool-growing country; it would be difficult to conceive a more
luxuriantly grassed and watered territory; at the very lowest
estimate it would carry a sheep to an acre, but in some picked
spots there would be no risk in quadrupling that number of stock
per acre, especially if sheep-farming were here practised with
such intelligence as may be found in the tropical and subtropical
districts of the Eastern Colonies of Australia. The district,
however, is neither fitted for cattle nor horses, except they be
paddock-fed.</p>
<p>The islands westward of Brecknock Harbour, although quite as
stony as the Glenelg district, are superbly grassed and watered.
Augustus Island contains 56,000 acres of pastoral land, after
deducting 0.4 of its whole area on account of the deep bays with
which its shores are indented. Byam Martin's and Heywood's
islands give 20,000 acres more. There are, therefore, about
80,000 acres of the richest pastoral land upon these islands,
capable of carrying 80,000 sheep. All this country is so superior
in grazing capabilities to the best districts occupied in the
southern parts of Western Australia, that it is difficult to
institute a comparison.</p>
<p><i>Mineral Resources</i>.&mdash;Excluding building materials,
the chief mineral resources are copper and iron.</p>
<p>1. <i>Copper</i>.&mdash;Indications of copper-lodes are to be
met with in several parts of the Glenelg district; whether these
lodes will be found hereafter to yield sufficient quantities to
be profitably worked remains to be seen. Other specimens are
collected than appear in the following list; but as the means of
identification are not now to be obtained, their examination must
be made at some future time:&mdash;</p>

<p>2. <i>Iron</i>.&mdash;Hydrous oxides, veins of both
crystalline and amorphous iron-ore, together with nodular masses
of specular iron-ore, highly crystalline and of considerable
size, occur abundantly throughout the district. In Brecknock
Harbour, at the base of Mount Lookover, and in the summer bed of
the Glenelg, vast quantities of these examples may be found;
scarcity of manual labour alone can prevent these ores of iron
from becoming an important resource to the Glenelg district when
occupied. Titaniferous iron-sand occurs plentifully wherever the
formation is either basaltic or sedimentary; it is even found
largely predominating in soundings of from 10 to 15 fathoms, at a
distance of several miles from the coast-line.</p>
<p>Of the existence of an extensive gold deposit there is no
evidence. From the discovery of exceedingly minute particles in
the mud of the Glenelg River, and from the finding of a single
specimen of nagyagite, an auroplumbiferous telluret, search, if
made, should he directed towards the source of the Glenelg River
and thence southward as far as the FitzRoy River and the
"provincia aurifera" of the old charts.</p>
<p>Precious stones will not be found in sufficient quantity to be
of economic value; indifferent specimens of topazes, sapphires,
zircons, rubies, agate, &amp;c, will reward the seeker in almost
any stream-bed; more rarely beryl, chalcedony, porzellanspath,
obsidian, and flint, will be found.</p>
<p><i>Building Materials</i>.&mdash;The principal building stones
are basalt and sandstones of various kinds, micaceous,
argillaceous, and pseudo-crystalline. The latter, as it has no
tendency to split in one direction more than another, may be
termed a freestone: it is nearly white in colour, and can be
procured in vast quantities upon the surface. The argillaceous
variety is a flagstone well fitted for street flagging, steps,
&amp;c.; it would likewise be found effective in ecclesiastical
architecture.</p>
<p>Limestone yielding lime for building purposes is found in
several localities; the specimens obtained from the range of
hills to the westward of George Water contain the highest
percentage of lime. In the district of the Upper Glenelg there
are fine varieties of crystalline limestone of the saccharine
kind, together with large deposits of a true magnesian limestone
of a pearly lustre. Until an accurate examination of the
palæontological contents and petrological relations of these
limestones be made, their precise value cannot be more exactly
determined.</p>
<p><i>Indigenous Vegetable Productions</i>.&mdash;The following
is a very imperfect sketch of the resources which the indigenous
vegetation furnishes to this district. In grouping these
according to the products afforded by them, the variety,
abundance, colossal size of many and the durability of some,
first attract the attention. By far the greater number of trees,
valued for their timber, may be included among the Eucalypti,
several species of which here attain a height but little inferior
to the <i>E. globulus</i>, or bluegum-tree of Victoria. The
flooded gum-tree (<i>E. rostrata</i>), the white gum (<i>E.
acervula</i>), and the ironbark-tree (<i>E. resinifera</i>), are
all to be found here in situations where, although too distant
from the coast to export, they will prove invaluable to the
future settler. Other species of Eucalypti, <i>e.g</i>. <i>E.
aspera, ferruginea, citriodora, aurantiaca,
ph&oelig;nicea</i>,&mdash;besides their notable service in the
bush as ample shade-givers, will all prove useful woods to the
settler and to the artisan.</p>
<p>Upon the dividing ranges between the Prince Regent's River and
the Glenelg, and in many other localities, the <i>Callitris
verrucosa</i>, a pine not unfrequently met with throughout the
interior of the Australian continent, from Victoria westward and
northward to Champion Bay, Shark's Bay, and Arnheim's
Land,&mdash;here, in the above-mentioned district, attains a size
rendering it an object of great value. It is fitted for all the
usual purposes to which deal is applied in buildings generally,
and it occasionally reaches dimensions that suffice for the
making of masts and spars of moderate size. The wood is nearly of
equal value with the well-known <i>Dammara australis</i>, or
Kauri pine. Perfectly straight trees of the following
admeasurements are common:&mdash;Circumference near the base, 8
feet; 5 feet from the ground, 7 feet; approximate height of the
whole tree, 100 feet. Sir George Grey speaks of this tree (vol i.
p. 275) as "fit for the purposes either of building or making
spars for vessels"; he adds, "it is abundant and good, and could
be readily and cheaply exported, if they were cut in the vicinity
of the streams, and floated down to the sea in the rainy season,
whereby all land carriage would be avoided." This Callitris is
frequently associated with the <i>Araucaria excelsa</i> on the
higher ranges both inland and on the sea-coast.</p>
<p>A melaleuca, very closely allied to if not identical with the
<i>Melaleuca leucodendron</i> of India, from whose leaves the
cajeput oil of commerce is extracted, grows abundantly, and
attains an enormous size. There are many other trees yielding
timber in every respect suitable to the requirements of the
cabinet-maker, whether of plain or ornamental works.</p>
<p>Fruits.&mdash;Amongst the edible indigenous fruits, those of
the "quandang" or native peach-tree (<i>Santalum preissianum</i>)
deserves first mention: the fruit, notwithstanding its thin
pericarp and strongly acidulous taste, is grateful and largely
available for food. Other fruiting bushes of the same order
(<i>Santalaceæ</i>) yield berries of a pleasant flavour.</p>
<p>Three species of Cissus are found: two run along the ground or
entwine amongst shrubs, the third is arborescent. All bear fruit
in size, appearance, and flavour like the small black cluster
grape, and in bunches from ten to forty. The Baobab-tree yields a
drupe as large as a cocoa-nut: the pulp and seeds of this fruit
are very palatable; the bark and spongy inner wood, when soaked
in boiling water, afford an agreeable mucilaginous drink not
unlike maccaroni in taste. These trees attain an enormous
diameter (50 feet in one instance), but they rarely exceed 25
feet in height. The young leaves and seeds of the palm fruit are
of an excellent flavour: when green the seeds or nuts are not
dissimilar to the English filbert.</p>
<p><i>Native Vegetables</i>.&mdash;Amongst the indigenous plants
available as culinary vegetables the fine bean, which grows so
abundantly on the sand-hills of the coast, offers, when boiled, a
nutritious diet: as a species it is as yet unnamed The pea, Abrus
precatorius, is plentiful all over the district: its valuable
properties as a legume are recognised even by the aborigines.
Horses eat greedily the branches, ripe seeds, and leaves. Several
herbaceous members of the small family <i>Basellaceæ</i> may be
regarded as a substitute for spinach. The amylaceous roots of the
Dioscorea, "warrein", and Typha, "yun-jid" or "adjico", are here,
as in the southern parts of Western Australia, important articles
of vegetable food of the natives.</p>
<p><i>Fibres</i>.&mdash;The lemon grass, <i>Anatherum
schoenanthus</i>, is pretty generally distributed throughout the
district: this and one of the Liliaceæ, not unlike a dwarf
<i>Phormium tenax</i>, yield a fibre from which the aborigines
manufacture a strong and well-made twine. But of all the
indigenous fibre-yielding leaves that of the palm deserves
especial examination: it is a species of Livistonia growing in or
near to every stream; its leaf, even if the fibre prove useless
for cordage, will be valuable for the manufacture of hats,
umbrellas, &amp;c, suited to the climate. It might even be
employed in the making of any coarse kind of paper.</p>
<p><i>Medicinal Plants, Gums, &amp;c</i>.&mdash;In this division
of the indigenous vegetable productions, little can be safely
predicated until opportunity has been afforded for an
investigation into the medicinal properties of the plants already
discovered; which, doubtless, form a very inconsiderable number
of this class within even the limited area explored. The abrus
and the anatherum, the pea and the lemon grass, as of most
frequent occurrence, may be considered first. From the roots of
the former we expect a perfect substitute for liquorice in every
respect; from an infusion of the leaves of the latter, we know,
from Indian experience, we can obtain a tea acknowledged to be
stomachic, tonic, and useful in dyspepsia, From the
convolvulaceæ, one species of which is included in the genus
Ipomæa, we may extract deoretin, affirmed to be identical with
jalapin; from a second species, of the genus convolvulus,
scammony or a cathartic resin of equal value may be prepared from
the expressed juice of its roots and stalks. From the root-stocks
of the typha, extracts astringent and diuretic are obtainable. An
elastic gum, something like Indian-rubber, and gum tragacynth,
have been found. Sandaric resin can be procured from the pine and
gum-resins of various descriptions from several of the
eucalypti.</p>
<p>The bark of some of the trees indigenous to this district will
yield a tonic and stimulant, depending on the presence of an
alkaloid, which there is every reason to believe will make them
become an article of export ere many years. The unlimited
quantities of the melaleuca may be expected to produce an oil not
inferior to the cajeputi oil extracted even by the simple Indian
process. There are but few genera of the myrtaceous trees and
shrubs from whose leaves and flowers we fail to extract a greater
or lesser quantity of essential oil&mdash;aromatic, volatile,
though somewhat camphoric.</p>
<p>As perfume plants the <i>Chamælaucieæ</i>, the <i>Rutaceæ</i>,
and the <i>Labiatæ</i> abound in species; but to what extent they
will prove of value for perfume distillation is is difficult to
foresee. Lastly, the Acaciæ, producing flowers in the utmost
profusion (especially the large species fringing the upper
Glenelg and nearly all the freshwater streams of the district),
possessing such powerful and agreeable odours, may be indicated
as proximate objects of commercial value when this luxuriant
country shall become the home of an intelligent people.</p>
<p><i>Animal Products</i>.&mdash;To the geological character of
the land its almost universal pre-oolitic fauna may be traced.
Here, as elsewhere throughout the Australian continent, the
pouch-bearing mammals, Marsupiata, rank next to man, so far as
the development of their physical organization is concerned.
These native animals, particularly the larger species of the
Macropidæ, are extremely numerous in the Glenelg district: the
skin of the <i>M. major</i> and the <i>M. laniger</i>, or large
red kangaroo, as well as the skins of the smaller varieties, will
form no mean item in the resources of the early settlers; whilst
these fur-clad skins are regarded as articles of commerce, the
value of the carcase of the animals, as excellent meat, must not
be wholly ignored.</p>
<p>Of birds, which are numerous both as to species and
individuals&mdash;the emu, geese, ducks, the native turkey
(<i>Otis Australasianus</i>), the "ngowoo" or native pheasant
(<i>Leipoa ocellata</i>), the jungle-fowl (<i>Megapodius
tumulus</i>), the lyre bird (<i>Menura superba</i>), and very
many others, may be mentioned as valuable either for their flesh,
brilliant plumage, oil, or eggs.</p>
<p>The waters of the district, both fresh and salt, are rich in
products which await enterprise alone to raise them. Foremost
amongst these ranks the dugong (<i>Halicore</i>), a marine
herbivorous animal included in the Cetacea, observed in both
Doubtful Harbour and Camden Sound: its flesh alone, which is not
unlike beef, would make it a welcome visitant; but regarded as
the source of an invaluable oil, superior in a nearly twofold
ratio to the best cod-liver oil, its annual visit would give rise
to a fishery attended with greater profit, outlay and other
things being taken into account, than that of the sperm oil. The
pearl oyster of commerce, the species valued for its nacreous
substance, is undoubtedly to be found here plentifully, for the
aborigines who would not be likely to undertake any excessive
labour to procure them, very commonly wear them as an ornament
suspended round the neck. The <i>Tridacna</i>, a conchiferous
mollusk, found upon any point of the coast between North-West
Cape and the Prince Regent's River, might be included in the
pearl-oyster fishery; for although its shell has no valuable
nacreous lining, in it pearls of great beauty and of considerable
size are not unfrequently obtained. The trepang fishery could not
be profitably carried on by Europeans. Whales and seals have been
more than once seen within the harbours of this district. There
are fine beds of oysters for the table in Brecknock Harbour:
turtles, crabs, cray-fish, &amp;c, abound. Deep-sea fishery would
in all probability be a profitable occupation. The fresh-water
streams teem with fish of large size and of excellent
flavour.</p>
<p><i>Harbours, Rivers, and Internal Communication</i>.&mdash;The
district of the Glenelg is especially rich in bays,
river-harbours, and sheltered anchorages. Along its western
shore, from Collier Bay to Camden Sound inclusive, a vessel may
at all times select a safe position with good holding ground in
15 fathoms water, and shelter from either the islands or the
great coral-reef known as Montgomery Shoal. Doubtful Bay into
which the Glenelg flows after receiving the Gairdner and the Fish
Rivers, both considerable streams, and almost an innumerable host
of minor tributaries, any one of which in the settled districts
of Western Australia would be called a river&mdash;is a
magnificent sheet of water, 9 miles in length from north to
south, and 6 miles in breadth from east to west. Although in the
summer vast quantities of water may from all sides pour into the
bay, and the tides gain additional force thereby, yet as it is
thoroughly protected from every wind and from a heavy sea by a
range of islands and reefs to seaward, and the natural breakwater
of the Montgomery Islands and the coral-reef, 14 miles still
further to the westward,&mdash;as the holding ground is of the
very best,&mdash;and as there is an abundance of room in which to
work the largest ship,&mdash;Doubtful Bay, when this portion of
the Australian coast is colonised, will prove a harbour of refuge
second to none. From the great rise and fall of the tide also, 36
feet, this bay is a good site for works necessary to the
repairing of ships. A better terminus to the system of Australian
telegraphs, when connected with those of Europe and Asia, it will
be difficult to find. About the centre of a large mangrove-swamp
on the eastern side of the bay, there is a red conical hill,
which vessels entering by "Foam Passage" should get in a line
with the centre of the passage; at a distance of 2 miles westward
of "Foam Passage", the summit of the red cone will just appear
above the horizon within the bay (bearing true east by south);
this course should be kept for 2½ miles within the bay when
Success Channel, the western entrance into George Water, will
bear due north. The anchorage is safe anywhere within the bay;
but in the vicinity of the spot indicated by the above bearings,
a vessel at anchor will feel the tidal effect to a much less
degree than elsewhere. There is but one known shoal within the
bay, and that is situated at a distance of 4 miles from the red
cone, on a line bearing N. 31° W. from the hill. At spring-tides
this sand-bank was seen dry at low water. Soundings through "Foam
Passage" and to the anchorage recommended are not less than 10
fathoms at low water; sand and mud bottom. Wood and water are to
be had without difficulty in Doubtful Bay.</p>
<p>Brecknock Harbour, area nearly 20 square miles, is so
thoroughly land-locked that a ship once at anchor, need fear no
wind. The coast line within the harbour is everywhere indented
with beautiful bays. There are several picturesque islands, on
nearly all of which there is fresh water; every valley of the
main has its rippling brook of the purest water running down to
the beach. Ships entering from Camden Sound have but two dangers
to avoid; one is the bank extending northwards from the pinnacle
rock,&mdash;the other is the rocky bar between Careening Island
and the circular reef. Until further surveys have been made,
Roger's Strait is considered a very dangerous entrance on account
of the reefs, and Camden Harbour a hazardous anchorage by reason
of its terrace-like bottom, which at some tides has not more than
half or three quarters of a fathom of water. Brecknock Harbour is
an excellent place for watering ships, and drift-wood is abundant
near the line of high water; but timber, fit for spars and the
repairs of ships, grows at too great a distance inland to be
available.</p>

<br>
<p>Vessels entering from Camden Sound should do so only with the
flood-tide and with a fair wind; the rocks to the south-west of
New Island, to be seen at all times, may be passed in
mid-channel; but on sighting the Pinnacle, which is close to the
southern shore, a course about one-eighth of a mile distant from
New Island will command the deepest water, running from 13 to 14
fathoms at the narrowest part of the entrance; when the Pinnacle
bears south, a course E. 10° N. may be sailed for 2½ miles, when
the northern entrance opens out into Camden Sound, bearing
north-west, all bearings true; thence, a course E.N.E. of 3 miles
may be steered, with 6 and 7 fathoms of water, either towards
Green Island or Camden Harbour. Vessels above 100 tons register
may select any spot within these limits, and obtain safe
anchorage. Vessels of less than 100 tons register, with a draught
of about 10 feet, after crossing the rocky bar north-east by
north of Careening Island, may find a perfectly secure anchorage,
anywhere in mid-channel, as far as the entrance to Camden
Harbour, with not less than 3 and 4 fathoms of water; all these
soundings are at low tide. For beaching a vessel on a soft
bottom, it would be difficult to find a better spot than the
sand-patch on Careening Island; whilst if a hard even bottom be
desired, for repairs of keel, &amp;c, the deep bay whose head
bears south-east from Mount Lookover, distant half a mile from
the base of the mount, will be found convenient and safe. The
time of high water within Brecknock Harbour, at full and change
of the moon, or the Establishment of the Port, is at noon; that
is 40 minutes later than in Camden Sound. Spring rise of tide 30
feet; neap, 12 feet. The tides rush through the entrances with
great force; it would not be advisable for any vessel to attempt
the passages under sail, with an opposing tide.</p>
<p>"Success Channel", the north-west passage from Doubtful Bay to
George Water, is safe for vessels of any draught, provided the
flood tide be made use of; and anchorage in George Water or
Maitland Bay is good; thence, to the lower rapids of the Glenelg,
distant 40 miles from "Foam Passage", the river Glenelg may be
described as safe and easy to navigate with cargo-boat or small
steamer. Above the rapids cargo-boats might ply, for fully half
the year, to a distance of 25 miles; but this last-mentioned
navigation would be uncertain between the months of May and
November. The Gairdner and Fish Rivers have a tide of not less
than 10 feet; water communication to a limited extent, therefore,
could be depended upon in these rivers for the same period as in
the case of the upper Glenelg.</p>
<p>With regard to the internal communication of the district, it
will suffice to state that there would be no great difficulty in
the construction of roads: but lines of railway would in several
directions entail great engineering difficulties, owing to the
naturally precipitous character of the hills, and deep
stream-beds of the rivers and gullies.</p>

<h3>THE DISTRICT OF ROEBUCK BAY; CLIMATE, EXTENT, PASTORAL
RESOURCES AND GENERAL CAPABILITIES OF THE SOIL.</h3>
<p>The country explored to the eastward of Roebuck Bay between
the 17° and 18° S. lat. and along the sea-coast from the head of
Roebuck Bay to Cape Latouche Treville, although only 150 miles to
the southward of the Glenelg district, offers a remarkable
contrast in point of climatic phenomena. The mean temperature in
the shade is here only 64° lower than in the Glenelg district,
and the solar radiation 50 miles eastward of the sea-coast,
although generally 5° lower, is occasionally a few degrees
higher; nevertheless the amount of humidity in the atmosphere is
here very greatly decreased. In this month, May, the weather is
found to resemble that of the Glenelg District in July. Clear
cloudless days and nights prevailed, and only such winds, a few
miles inland, as serve to keep the air in a perceptible motion;
so that the days, although the thermometers read high, are not so
warm but that a man can walk 20 or 30 miles without inconvenience
from the heat; on one occasion, indeed, our exploring party
walked 45 miles of course between the hours of 6 <span class=
"aa">a.m.</span> and 9 <span class="aa">p.m.</span> The annexed
meteorological tables will in part account for this. The dryness
of the atmosphere is like that of the Champion Bay district in
the month of October or early in November, when a man can work
eight or ten hours of day in the open air without suffering on
account of heat. May seems to be an early spring month: the trees
are just coming into flower and the grass is everywhere green;
the natives take considerable trouble to burn their hunting
grounds to entice the game with young feed; but so speedily does
the grass grow again, that in a few days the burnt place is once
more green, before the ash of the former grass has been displaced
by wind or showers. For nearly a week before the party landed,
showers were occasionally seen to fall over various parts of the
country, but during the period of the land exploration no rain
fell. There was more or less dew every night, but an hour after
sunrise it had all disappeared.</p>

<p>The extent of explored country within the limits already
mentioned as far eastward only as the meridian of 123° includes
an area of 3300 square miles; but from what has been seen at the
most distant stations from our depôt, there is every reason to
believe that the same kind of country extends eastward at least
as far as the Fitzroy River, in long. E. 123° 30'; and southward
we know not to what extent. The known portion, however, contains
2,112,000 acres of perfectly level country,&mdash;so level that
with the exception of the sea-coast range of sand-hills and three
little hummocks near Cape Villarêt, no spot traversed eastward
from the depôt exceeded 50 feet in altitude. Of these 2,112,000
acres, perfectly level, well-grassed and almost treeless plains
occupy 80,000 acres, the one-half of which lie round the south
and east shores of Roebuck Bay, and the remainder inland from or
east of Lagrange Bay. These plains possess chiefly an alluvial
soil capable of growing many tropical productions; they are
fringed with belts of moderately large Cajeputi trees. In the
native wells, which are found on these plains at intervals of not
more than a mile, water is obtainable within 16 or 18 feet,
whilst within the belt of Cajeputi trees it is found plentifully
within 4 or 5 feet of the surface. The rest of the country
consists of grassy plains with shrubs and small timber chiefly of
the order Myrtaceæ, sub-orders Chamælaucieæ, Leptospermeæ,
Myrteæ, not growing so thickly as to impede rapid riding except
where thickets occur. These thickets are rather difficult to
traverse on account of the mass of dead wood, the accumulation of
years, not because of the density of the vegetation; once burnt
thoroughly, as thickets they would disappear. The grass is fine,
sweet, and plentiful; our route crossed no sand plains or barren
places; in May the grass averages one foot in height, and it is
quite green. A distinguishing feature between the grass of the
Glenelg District and that found here must be mentioned, as upon
it is based the comparatively low estimate of sheep-grazing
capability. The grass grows in <i>tufts</i>. (This is also the
case in certain highly valued parts of the already settled
districts of Western Australia.) For this reason, as it is as
well to under-estimate the carrying capability of a newly
discovered country, a deduction of <i>one-half</i> its supposed
carrying power is now made, although it is more than probable
that the experience of the future settler will declare the amount
to be greatly underrated. This premised, the known parts of the
Roebuck Bay District, within the limits already mentioned, may be
safely asserted to be capable of carrying upwards of one million
of sheep.</p>
<p>No evidence of mineral resources was discovered in sufficient
quantities to warrant more extended research. Building materials
do not abound. The indigenous Vegetable resources are very
similar to those already named in reporting of the Glenelg
country. The Baobab, palm, and pine do not occur here, and the
timber generally can only be described as affording an ample
supply of firewood and an inferior material for fencing. With
respect to perfume plants, however, the whole district is
particularly rich. Nearly every tree and plant in flower yields a
strong and grateful odour; the dwarf myrtle, so common here,
perhaps, has the most powerful odour; but some of the acaciæ and
small shrubs possess scents exquisitely beautiful. The perfume of
the heliotrope, the violet, the clove pink, the rose, the stock,
were all recognised; but many others, although delicious, were
such as could not be likened to that of any commonly known plant
or flower. Such animal products as are found here are already
included in the list given of those within the district of the
Glenelg.</p>
<p><i>Harbours and Internal Communication</i>.&mdash;Roebuck Bay
was well explored by Mr. Arthur Du Boulay, during the absence of
the expedition inland. Six days were spent in its examination. It
is a sheet of water at high tide extending 15 miles inland and
having an opening from Cape Villarêt to the opposite coast of
Dampier Land of no less than 22 miles; but if a line be drawn
from Cape Villarêt to Point Gantheaume, the land dry at low water
is at no point distant more than 4 miles from that line. The bay
is thus reduced for the purposes of navigation to a trifling
indentation of the coast line not exceeding an average breadth of
2 miles at the most. The whole of this is very shallow, 3 fathoms
at low water, with the exception of a narrow channel running
parallel from Cape Villarêt along the south-east shore of the
bay. At a distance of 1½ mile to the north of Cape Villarêt this
channel has a depth of 12 fathoms, but on tracing it up the bay
it is found to shoal rapidly and ultimately disappeared at 6½
miles in a north-east direction. If a line due north from Cape
Villarêt be drawn, after crossing the narrow channel just
mentioned, for 20 miles extensive shoals are formed which give in
no instance deeper water than 4 fathoms upon that line. The
anchorage, however, in or near this deep channel is good and the
ship is protected from the strong south-east breezes by the
sand-hills of the coast; nor is it found a bad anchorage during
south-west, south, east, or north-east winds. No strong wind has
yet been registered from the west, north-west, or west. Only one
detached rock, dangerous to shipping, has as yet been seen, and
that is situated off Cape Villarêt, at a distance of about 1 mile
north by west from the beach at the foot of the Cape; it is well
above water at low tide. The bay has a series of fine sandy
beaches from Cape Villarêt in a north-east direction for 12
miles; to these succeeds a mangrove fringe, attaining its
greatest density and breadth at the head of the bay. High water
at full and change occurs at 10 <span class="aa">a.m.</span>
Spring-tides rise 23½ feet; neap-tide 12 feet.</p>
<p>Lagrange Bay as a harbour is of still less value than Roebuck
Bay. It is only an indentation of the coast line to the extent of
4 miles at the deepest part. Viewed from the high land on Cape
Latouche Treville it appears to be shallow. There was no
opportunity to obtain soundings in Lagrange Bay. From the hammock
on Cape Latouche Treville, whose summit is 180 feet above mean
sea-level, an excellent view of the hay was obtained extending
all round its coast line to Cape Bossut and Casuarina Reef. No
considerable stream, perhaps not a creek, falls into the sea by
this bay.</p>
<p>Throughout the country explored in this district there is an
entire absence of rivers and even creeks, except a number of very
short ones between Cape Villarêt and Cape Du Boulay. Land
transit, however, is exceedingly easy, for the country is
perfectly level; the soil, at a greater distance than 2 miles
from the sea coast, is a red sandy loam without stone and only
rarely showing a very fine gravel upon the surface. It is
sufficiently hard for heavy drays to traverse it in any
direction: nor does it seem likely to cut up much with continuous
traffic.</p>

<h3>THE ABORIGINES OF THE DISTRICT OF ROEBUCK BAY.</h3>
<p>The tribes of natives in the interior excel those of the
sea-coast in bodily structure. They are more muscular, taller,
and apparently more intelligent; at any rate, the expression of
their countenances is more pleasing: some of those we met had a
profile more resembling that of a Polynesian, or a Keloenonesian
of the first division (New Hebrides, &amp;c.), rather than that
of the second division to which the Australian belongs. Of the
form of the head (it is an argument from the particular to the
universal, for my data are founded upon the examination of the
only human skull discovered during the exploration
inland),&mdash;it is as well perhaps here to give the chief
particulars. The facial angle, as indicating the proportions of
the cranial cavity and the grade of intelligence, contrasts very
favourably with that of the lower types of the Australian native;
whilst this angle of the latter is included within an arc of 85°,
that of the skull before me measures 94°, or only 1° less than
the average facial angle of the European. The occipito-frontal
diameter measures 7.23 inches; the inter-parietal 5.31 inches;
the vertical height from the glabello-occipital line 45 inches;
from the level of the glabello-occipital line on each side,
across the middle of the sagittal suture to the same point on the
opposite side 11.75 inches; the longitudinal arc from the nasal
depression along the middle line of the skull to the occipital
protuberance 13.1 inches; the horizontal circumference in the
plane of a line joining the glabella with the occipital
protuberance 20.7 inches. The walls of the cranial cavity are
less thick than in the skull of an adult aboriginal of the
southern parts of Australia. The malar bones are prominent; the
zygomæ make a wide curve outwards, giving breadth to the face.
The upper jaw is so prognathic as to give a very oblique
insertion of the teeth.</p>
<p>The eyes of the inland aboriginal are black, and set very
deep; the nose in some is a great deal flattened; the nostrils in
a few instances were observed to be larger laterally than
forwards; the mouth exceeds the average size, but, generally, was
well formed, and without the usual accompaniment of thick lips.
The chin is of proportionate size, neither long nor broad. The
lower part of the face is prominent; the teeth are beautifully
even and white. The hair, when allowed to grow naturally, appears
in spiral locks about three or four inches in length, spreading
out all over the head; its texture may be described as wavy-crisp
or frizzled, not strongly; and its colour is what is generally
styled a jet-black. The prevailing fashion in both sexes seems to
be, to allow the hair to grow long and then to gather it all
smoothly to the back of the head, and there tie it in a knot
about the size of a cricket ball. No instance was seen of the
addition of colouring or oleaginous matters as beautifiers of the
hair. The moustache and beard are about equally abundant; these
possessions seem as much treasured as coveted: some who rejoiced
in them carefully bound the beard beneath the chin with a
wrapping of string, others trained the moustache into a
horizontal spiral after the fashion of the King of Italy; others
again whose upper lips were deficient in quantity of hair, wore
<i>false hair</i>, that is, they supplemented that deficiency by
a piece of dark-haired opossum skin, cat to the required
shape.</p>
<p>In colour these natives are decidedly <i>black</i>; as black
as we might expect to find a people in a locality elevated but a
few feet above mean sea-level&mdash;with large tracts of alluvial
soil&mdash;and near enough to the equator to feel the influence
of the moister character of tropical heat. There are, however,
two shades very distinctly marked, like the blonde and brunette
of the white race; in one of these shades a bluish hue
predominates, in the other the colour might be described as a
reddish black.</p>
<p>These natives of the interior wear no clothing whatever, and
their shelter from the cold and rainy weather seems to be of two
forms: first, a hut of the rudest description, made of a few
boughs piled loosely together, affording but little shelter from
either wind or rain; and secondly&mdash;an arrangement somewhat
more complicated but equally defective&mdash;a platform of
brushwood laid evenly to a height of about one foot above the
ground, beneath the centre of which a circular hole wider at the
base than at the top, is scraped out of the soil, deep enough and
of sufficient size to contain the persons of one or two
individuals coiled up, as it were, beneath the overhanging sides
of the cavity.</p>
<p>This kind of habitation is used, doubtlessly, in dry but cold
weather; when it rains, it is probable they make use of the
platform of sticks above the hole, as a sitting or reclining
place; it would answer to keep them from the wet earth and that
is all. For the greater part of the year, their primitive hut
would suffice in exposed situations, if protection of any kind be
needed; but during the periodic tropical rains these people,
resident in a level country where no cave or other natural
shelter is at hand, must practice no mean amount of patient
endurance. They seem, nevertheless, to attain a good old age, in
spite of privations and exposure; we fell in with several old men
and women who had evidently lived many summers more than fall to
the lot of Australian natives in general.</p>
<p>Foremost among the ornaments in common use by these people
ranks the pearl-oyster shell of the coast. The centre of this
shell, that is, so much of it as can be ground into an oval shape
whilst retaining the nacreous substance very nearly flat, is
either worn plain or engraved. In the manufacture of these plain
ornaments, nothing more is required than the grinding away of
about two-thirds of the entire substance of the margin of the
shell, the drilling of a hole through it near one end of the
smaller diameter, and the suspending of the shell by one or more
thicknesses of the native string. But the more valued ornament,
after passing through the processes enumerated, has its nacreous
surface completely covered with a lace-like pattern composed of
four and five sided figures, combined in a very curious manner
and included within one or several parallel elliptical lines
running equi-distant from the ground edge of the shell. These
figures composed of three or more series of the lines, are
engraved to a depth of about .025 of an inch; then the spaces are
filled up with a black pigment, a mixture of gum and charcoal.
Amongst the minor ornaments examined may be mentioned a necklace
made of the claws of a crab (Porcellana, a genus of anomurous
Crustacea found only occasionally on the north-west coast of
Australia): the pieces composing the necklace were about the size
and shape of large bugles, similar to those used in ladies' fancy
work; and a hair-pin made out of a kangaroo's tooth&mdash;an
incisor of the lower jaw of one of the larger species of
Macropidæ. These natives are as fond of personal decoration in
plastic colours done in small round spots upon the legs, arms,
and upper parts of the body, as other Australian tribes. Some
years ago, at a famous native festival in south-west Australia,
several men were painted round the neck in imitation of the then
fashionable ladies' lace-collars, with lappets down the breast:
this was very neatly executed with a white paint made of
pipe-clay, laid on in minute spots with an extempore brush; this
kind of painting we also noticed in the case of an individual
amongst the group we first met in the interior, but the colouring
included four tints and extended down to the feet in a
harlequin-like pattern.</p>
<p>As this race of people have no rivers or deep-sea inlets to
cross, the craft already described as commonly used by the
natives of the Glenelg district is of rare occurrence here. The
instrument of most general utility is in the form of a scoop;
with this they dig wells, and the indigenous roots used as food;
it is their basket and portmanteau: their water-jug and shovel.
It is of very varied size and shape, both these latter depending
upon the elbow of the tree from which it is cut; so important an
instrument is it, that as a rule it receives the highest possible
degree of ornamentation; it is carved, sometimes inside and
outside, with closely adjoining parallel lines, disposed in a
zigzag pattern. Some of the larger scoops are not carried from
place to place with the tribe, but left beneath some bush in the
neighbourhood of a well: these larger instruments are those which
receive the maximum amount of decoration. For cooking purposes
they use large shells, species of Strombus and Triton; (the seed
of the mangrove undergoes a most elaborate process in its
preparation as an article of food). They also make bags of
kangaroo skin, fastened with a twine made of the fibres of an
Anatherum, and a species of the Liliaceæ; a kind of twine is also
made here of a mixture of opossum hair and vegetable fibre;
another kind, which was found in use only as a means of
suspending the engraved shells, was made of human hair alone.</p>
<p>These natives do not seem to be acquainted with the use of the
womera, or throwing-stick. The spears we saw with each tribe or
party we presume to be hunting-weapons; these are ill-shapen and
not barbed; in some cases they were pointed at both ends; in
every case they were intended to be thrown by the hand from the
middle: some natives carried bundles of small spears only 3 feet
in length; these were no doubt designed to spear small birds,
whilst the thrower was in ambush. The usual stone hatchet of the
Australian native is everywhere found on this coast. The kiley,
however, is a superior instrument to that used by the aboriginal
of the south-west coast; its shape more nearly approaches the
bomerang of the Eastern Australian: but it is not so effective an
instrument either in war or in the chase; both the kiley and the
bomerang of Australia are instruments as inferior to that used by
the ancient Egyptians as their weapon was inferior to that of the
Assyrian huntsman. But notwithstanding the inferiority of the
kiley of these natives, it is a weapon in their hands worthy of
attention in an engagement; on a shield obtained, there were
several indentations made by the kiley. The shield alluded to
differs from that common to southern tribes in being cut out of
the solid; it has a handle with a sufficient space for the hand
of the holder also cut out of the same solid piece. Although
heavy, it seems to have done the original owner good service in
warding off blows from the kiley in its bizarre and rapid
flight.</p>
<p>As concerning the natives of the sea-coast, it will suffice to
state that they are inferior to the natives of the interior in
physical development; they are less cleanly in their persons and
less industrious in the chase. The same extraordinary mutilation,
referred to by the officers of the <i>Beagle</i> when describing
the sea-coast tribes of this district (Stokes, vol. i., page 117)
was observed by members of our expedition; but the custom does
not extend beyond the tribes of the coast.</p>
<p>The language of both sea-coast and inland tribes, judging from
a limited vocabulary of about seventy words, is agglutinate, with
Malay affinities few, obscure, and only partially recognised; the
dialects prevail over exceedingly small areas, as is the case
with eastern Kel&oelig;nonesian tribes. The following vocabulary,
in the construction of which the Italian vowel sounds * are
adopted, will serve to illustrate these remarks:&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[* The vowels marked with a grave accent are
long, those with an acute are short.]</p>
<p align="center"><a name="Table-5" id="Table-5"></a><img alt=""
src="1402201h-images/Table-5.jpg"></p>
<p>By this it will be seen that the language ignores sibilant
letters; many of our consonants these natives cannot pronounce at
all; <i>e.g</i>. t, and its compound th, f, g, &amp;c. In short,
the language may be said to be composed chiefly of vowel and
liquid sounds, with a limited number of consonants. The terminal
h in many of the native words given above is very strongly
marked, and is characteristic of and points prominently to the
origin of the dialect. The letter r is rolled in the native
pronunciation after the manner of the French.</p>

<h3>Appendix 1: Discussion of the Paper by RGS Members, 22
January, 1866.</h3>
<br>
<p align="center">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY OF
LONDON VOLUME X,<br>
pages 86-89, 22 January, 1866.</p>
<br>
<h4>2. <i>Explorations in North-Western Australia</i>. By
<span class="aa">James Martin</span>, Esq., M.B.</h4>
<p>The chief geographical interest of this paper referred to the
discovery and exploration of the mouth of the Glenelg River, by
the party of which Mr. Martin was a member. The River Glenelg was
discovered so long ago as 1838, by Captain (now Sir George) Grey
and Lieutenant Lushington, and an attractive account of the
region was given in the 'Journals of Discovery in North-West
Australia', afterwards published by Captain Grey. But neither of
these explorers was able to reach the mouth of the river, nor had
it been detected by our naval surveyors. The expedition to which
Mr. Martin belonged was organised in 1863, by a committee of
settlers in Western Australia, for the discovery of new pastoral
lands in the tropical portion of the colony; and the party,
consisting of four explorers, set sail in the schooner Flying
Foam. It was not until many vain attempts and much delay, that
the schooner succeeded in finding the mouth of the Glenelg, in
the place where it was supposed to lie&mdash;namely, in Doubtful
Bay. The difficult entrance from the sea led into a large expanse
of waters (called "George"), all the channels out of which,
landward, seemed to end in a passage choked up with mangroves.
Land parties could, however, descry from the top of a
neighbouring hill the river flowing towards the place, and the
true mouth was, after six days' search, found in the
north-eastern end of the George Water. The river for the first
few miles flows through a rugged hilly country, and has many
rocky islands in its channel. Its shores afterwards become
flatter, but the navigation was difficult, owing to the great
fall of the tide&mdash;28 feet&mdash;leaving the schooner aground
always at low water. After connecting their explorations with
those of Grey and Lushington, the party examined the tract of
country between the Glenelg and Camden Harbour, and reported
favourably on its suitableness for settlement.</p>
<p>This communication will be printed <i>in extenso</i> in the
'Journal', vol. XXXV.</p>
<blockquote>At the conclusion of the papers, the <span class=
"uu">Chairman</span> read the following extract from a letter of
Admiral Stokes, who expressed his regret at being unable to
attend the meeting:&mdash;<br>
<br>
"I consider Mr. Martin's discovery of great importance, as it
gives water-carriage to the good land that Sir George Grey (the
discoverer of the Glenelg) speaks of having found on its banks.
Such a mode of transit in so rugged a country must indeed be
considered a great acquisition. Delighted as I always am, at
seeing enterprising colonists taking up positions on the northern
and western shoves of Australia, I fear that success will not
attend settlers on the north-west coast in the neighbourhood of
Camden Bay; for, bountiful as Nature has there been in the way of
harbours and in giving a great rise and fall of tide, numerous
islets and outlying reefs give the coast a forbidding approach,
added to which are the frequent calms which prevail. Nowhere does
salubrity depend more on a certain fresh breeze than in
intertropical settlements. I consider that the very rugged nature
of the country, with its ovenlike valleys in the neighbourhood of
Camden Bay, holds out but poor prospects for the proprietor of
cattle and sheep."<br>
<br>
<span class="uu">Mr. Crawfurd</span> was of opinion that the
tropical part of Australia, which constitutes about one-third of
the whole continent, is not at all likely to be a fit place for
the rearing and pasturing of sheep, or for European colonization.
With respect to the temperate portion of Australia, although
possessing a most salubrious climate, it is deficient in those
grand features of physical geography which make a country fertile
and capable of sustaining a great population. For instance, there
are no great rivers in this vast region: there is no valley of
the Mississippi; none comparable to that of the Ohio, the Danube,
or the Ganges.<br>
<br>
<span class="uu">Sir Charles Nicholson</span> here remarked that
there were the valleys of the Murrumbidgee and the Darling, much
larger than any of those which Mr. Crawfurd mentioned, except the
Mississippi.<br>
<br>
<span class="uu">Mr. Crawfurd</span>, in continuation, said that
the South Australians had planted a settlement at Adam's Bay, in
lat. 12°, and never was failure more complete. The country in
that part of Australia was totally unfit either for sheep or for
Europeans. It was from that spot that a party of the settlers
made the extraordinary boat-voyage of 1600 miles (of which we
heard an account on a previous evening) in order to escape from
it. Another attempt had been in lat. 15°, at Camden Harbour, the
neighbourhood of which Mr. Martin said was favourable for
depasturing sheep. Admiral Stokes, on the contrary, said it never
will be fit for the depasturing of sheep. The summer-heat is from
98° to 120°, and is that a place for sheep whose fleece is
required only for warmth? He had seen an account in a Dutch
newspaper of a visit to the settlement paid by the English vessel
Jenny Orwell, in the spring of 1865. The account stated that
there were 100 persons there, and that the chief purpose of the
experiment was the depasturing of sheep, of which about 5000 were
taken to the place. The colonists were in a very desponding
condition: a great many of the sheep had died from the effects of
heat and want of food; and out of the 5000 a few hundred only
remained, after seven months' residence. That report seemed to
condemn Camden Harbour most completely.<br>
<br>
<span class="uu">Sir Charles Nicholson</span> said, on one or two
points he was happy to agree with Mr. Crawford. He thought, for
instance, that the settlement at Camden Harbour was a most absurd
enterprise. The first statement in the report of the survey of
that district&mdash;namely, that there was only a million of
acres of land&mdash;was at once decisive against the
establishment of a colony there, when there arc hundreds of
millions of acres of land unappropriated in various other parts
of the Australian continent. Besides, the very character of the
grass, 6 feet high, was to any one accustomed to the rearing of
sheep a sufficient proof that such a country is utterly unfit for
the depasturing of sheep. This was the first occasion upon which
he had really acquired a clear conception that a colony had been
formed in that particular locality. With regard to Adam's Bay, no
doubt there has been a great deal of wrangling and squabbling
among the persons entrusted with the founding of that colony; but
it remained to be proved that that country is not capable of
profitable occupation in some way or other. That North Australia
should be placed under the jurisdiction of South Australia is an
absurdity for which the Colonial Office is responsible. That
sheep will thrive within the limits of the tropics is a matter
placed utterly beyond doubt. It is notorious that, at the present
moment, there are within the region of the tropics not less than
four or five millions of sheep depasturing, and thriving as well
as in any part of the Australian continent. He quite admitted
that further north the climate would be found incompatible with
the healthy growth of sheep; but in those regions at the head of
the Gulf of Carpentaria there is most luxuriant pasture suitable
for cattle. With regard to the alleged want of fertile valleys,
like those of the Mississippi and the Ohio, it is a fact that
there are some of the largest rivers in the world in the
south-eastern part of Australia, which, in the case of the
Murrumbidgee and the Murray, are made available by steamers for a
distance of 1200 miles. There is no doubt that these valleys will
ultimately become the seat of a vast population. Again, on the
east coast, the Fitzroy River drains an area of country as large
as the whole of England. There are portions of Australia
destitute of water, and not suitable for settlement; but there is
the whole of the eastern and south-eastern portions, with
capabilities equal to those of any portion of the globe.<br>
<br>
<span class="uu">Mr. Crawfurd</span> said he was aware of the
existence of the Murrumbidgee and the Murray, but they have no
outlet, and are, therefore, inferior to the great rivers in other
parts of the world. No doubt, parts of the continent are fertile;
but the fact that the Australians are fed by corn brought from
California and Chili shows that the general fertility of the
country is inferior. He had said that with respect to sheep there
is no part of the world comparable to temperate Australia. The
amount of wool imported, into this country alone, from Australia
last year was 99,000,000 lbs., of the estimated value of
8,800,000<i>l</i>. He had also said that, within certain limits
of the tropics up to, perhaps, about latitude 21°, sheep might
thrive. But he maintained that the fleece deteriorated
considerably in quality and quantity; already the fleece of
Queensland is inferior to the fleece of Sydney.<br>
<br>
The <span class="uu">Chairman</span>, in conclusion, said what we
wanted in discussions of this kind was as little as possible of
inferential argument and as much as possible of direct testimony.
On the one hand we have the fact that a settlement has been
formed in tropical North-Western Australia, the sheep being
transported with the settlers by a long sea-voyage from Swan
River, and we know that those sheep have entirely failed. On the
other hand, we have direct testimony that sheep from Queensland
and the temperate regions of Australia have been gradually
transported by land into the sub-tropical and tropical portions
of the continent, passing quietly and gradually through a grass
country favourable to the pasturing of sheep, and these sheep
have suffered no material deterioration and have most distinctly
thriven. It is not in the competence of any man at present to be
able to draw a line, and say that at the tropic of Cancer, or at
a line north of it, the pasturing of sheep stops and ceases to be
profitable. The most that can be said is this&mdash;he was citing
the opinion of Mr. Brodrib, quoted by Sir Roderick Murchison in
his Annual Address&mdash;that sheep do most distinctly thrive
which go northwards from Queensland to the tropics: not in the
equatorial tropics, but in the less typically tropical regions on
the north side of the tropic of Cancer. But the weight of the
fleece does undergo diminution, and it has been found necessary
to import fresh rams every two years from the temperate regions
of Australia, in order to perpetuate the breed and enable it to
produce wool at anything like a satisfactory profit. Still, if
that can be done, it is so far an argument in favour of this
gradual and tentative extension of sheep-breeding from Queensland
northward. He wanted to point out the difference between that and
the sheep which are transported, per saltum, by a long sea-voyage
from south to north; and that, in this way, it is perfectly
possible to reconcile the conflicting statements they had heard.
He wished, finally, to explain that the new establishment at Cape
York is neither an agricultural nor a pastoral settlement, but is
founded by the Government of Queensland, in conjunction with the
Home Government, chiefly as a harbour of refuge in connection
with tho navigation of Torres Straits.</blockquote>

<h4>Appendix 2: Paper Read by Mr. C. A. Wilson, F.L.S.,
&amp;C., on Tuesday, 29th May, 1866.</h4>
<hr>
<h3>SUBJECT&mdash;THE LATE EXPLORATIONS OF THE WEST AND
NORTH-WEST COASTS OF AUSTRALIA.</h3>
<hr>
<p>It was first My intention to read a paper on this subject
about twelve months ago, or soon after I received from Western
Australia one of the within-mentioned pamphlets of explorations
to which I shall often allude in the following pages; but having
other papers to write for some London Societies (which I must
plead as an excuse for not more frequently doing so for this),
and also desiring further and more authentic information about
the coasts of North-West Australia from the colonization there in
progress, I delayed till the commencement of the present year. I
was then glad to find that other members of our Society had
prepared papers to read, as this would give still further time
for the accounts to come in from the Northern Territory, as the
north-west coast has been called in relation to South
Australia.</p>
<p>During this last period of about twelve months but little has
been added, as is well known, to our knowledge of the north-west
coast, and that little confined to only a small extent of country
of a few square miles; nor can we expect more till Mr. McKinlay's
reports come in, which are beginning for many reasons to be
looked forward to with some anxiety. In the course of the same
past year a new and unexpected event occurred&mdash;the arrival
at Champion Bay, from the Northern Territory, of the "Forlorn
Hope," or boat party, as it is popularly called, with the news of
the successful termination of a hazardous voyage. In the
interesting account since published and circulated are many
remarks and statements which apply to the present subject, and
which I shall be glad occasionally to make use of in the
following pages.</p>
<p>I did purpose, besides mentioning the country explored, to
make this paper more complete by speaking as far as known of its
natural productions, but this would lengthen the article too much
for one sitting. I shall therefore have to confine this to the
late failure of the Camden Harbour settlement on the north-west
coast, with a review in general terms of the explorations, and at
a future time of particular districts, with notices of their
geology, botany, and zoology.</p>
<p>By the <i>late</i> explorations I mean those of Mr. James
Martin, the only explorer to any extent in the last few years,
also the nearest in time previous to his, and what little has
been done subsequently as to observations of the north-western
coasts of this vast island or island-continent. Mr. Martin is but
slightly known, except by name, in this colony; and in the few
paragraphs in which he is mentioned has not been spoken of
favourably, but hastily, or without consideration or knowledge of
all the facts&mdash;that is, with regard to his late
explorations, statements, and descriptions thereafter published.
I do not come forward this evening as Mr. Martin's champion or
defender, for, as far as I am aware, there is no opponent of his
among our members, but as his vindicator only, or to show that in
what has been alleged against him he is not fairly spoken of. His
name has been brought before the public here as one who has
misrepresented facts; whereas, with regard to his explorations,
there is every reason to think, looking into other accounts as
well as his own, that his statements are perfectly correct. I
must be excused from dwelling a little on this part of my
subject, as he is the mainspring&mdash;or at least one of the
principal wheels&mdash;in the works of the late explorers of our
western coasts; and to establish his truthfulness in all these
things is necessary, as the basis on which I must rely in quoting
his doings. My own knowledge of Mr. Martin is, I confess, not
personal, but as a correspondent I have been acquainted with him
for some years, being first introduced to him in this way by Dr.
Mueller, the Government Botanist at Melbourne. In Dr. Mueller's
letters Mr. Martin it called Doctor, but <i>of</i> what I was
not aware till latterly, when I found it was the common title of
courtesy to a medical practitioner, which he is. I mention this
little circumstance because one of his opponents&mdash;I speak
only of published statements&mdash;complains of his calling in
himself Doctor. There appears to be no proof of his having done
so, and even should there be the grievance is a very slight
one.</p>
<p>The hue and cry raised about Camden Harbour
settlement&mdash;that is, its unfitness as such&mdash;seems not
without good reason; but if blame rests anywhere it should not
alight on the wrong party.</p>
<p>This place&mdash;Camden Harbour&mdash;is on the north-west
coast, from 3° to 4° south of Adam Bay, lying north and south of
latitude 13°. I was about to take it in its course in my remarks
quoted from the explorers of different parts of the coast, but
having commenced, it will be best to explain here.</p>
<p>The substance of the complaint is that from the published
statements of Dr. Martin (whom I shall hereafter call Doctor, as
others do) of a beautifully-grassed and watered country at and in
the neighbourhood of Camden Harbour, settlers from various parts
were enticed to go there, but did not find the country such as
they had been led to expect, and thereby were deceived and
injured.</p>
<p>Now as to his statements, published in his "Journal of
Explorations in 1863 and 1864," about Camden Harbour. On 6th
July, 1863, three of the party, one being Dr. Martin, set off on
land explorations from Camden Harbour, with three horses and a
fortnight's provisions. At the end of the day he says, "The whole
of this day's track lies through a splendidly-grassed country."
Next day, July 7, he writes:&mdash;"From a hill 800 feet high to
our camp, the country was exceedingly rugged, with steep hills
coming almost to an edge up and down. . . . The grass was rather
coarse and rank, like coarse wheat straw. . . . Good water,
probably permanent, is found wherever palms are seen." On the
8th:&mdash;"Camden Harbour is somewhat disappointing&mdash;it
seems, as we look down upon it, so small after those magnificent
sheets of water, Collier Bay, Doubtful Harbour, George Water,
&amp;c." On July 9&mdash;"Here and there were seen belts of stony
country, with coarse grass. . . . We camped at noon on the most
eastern bend of the Gairdner. Under the range there was fine
grass and large timber; the river has permanent water. In some of
the pools was a carpet of lilies in flower," &amp;c. On July 10
the explorers went to the Depot Camp, where he says:&mdash;This
is a magnificently-grassed and well-watered country, with a
practical natural dray-route all the distance from Camden Harbour
to this depot. The whole of our route during the past week is
fringed by timber of sufficient size and in sufficient quantities
for all building and pastoral purposes for many years to come. We
have already seen 300,000 acres of land of the finest quality for
grazing, and at present, although it is now drawing near to the
close of the dry season, clothed with grass of the most luxuriant
growth. During our march of this morning there were places where,
as we rode along, we could not see each other for the grass; in
fact the grass-seed was at least three feet above our heads. It
is the opinion of us all that the lowest estimate of the carrying
power of this district is a sheep to an acre, therefore 300,000
sheep might be fed upon it; but in this estimate we do not
include the sandstone ranges we have seen, which, although so
precipitous as to be impassable save on foot, are still
well-grassed and available to the depasturing of sheep, and in
process of time, as the more easily traversed land becomes
stocked, would naturally be included in the runs." On the 16th
July the party began to explore to the south and west of the
Glenelg. The expedition in 1864, or the following year, was in
the months of March, April, and May. After some preliminary
observations, he says the depot camp was "pitched on the side of
a beautifully-grassed hill, with a brook of the purest water at
its base, winding its course into Camden Harbour." This was on
the 5th April. On the 6th he remarks:&mdash;"All the country
passed over to-day is splendidly-grassed, with sufficient shade
for sheep." Next day:&mdash;"Before we had taken many paces
through the grass we were wet through to the waist&mdash;each
blade of grass bending under the load of dew-drops." This falling
of a copious dew and the consequent daily moistening of the grass
was a frequent subject of remark by the members of the
expedition&mdash;these damp nights often following the hottest
days; not, as is so frequently here the case, dry nights
succeeding dry days, the thermometer standing above 80° Fahr.
through the 24 hours for days and nights together. This, of
course, is only in our summer, but I will shortly show how
different the seasons of the year are between our south and
north-west coasts&mdash;that is, in the latter case, north of a
certain latitude. At the end of the account of that day (7th
April) Dr. Martin writes:&mdash;"The length and close growth of
the grass is such as greatly to retard our progress," &amp;c.
Passing by a few other similar remarks made in the journal on the
succeeding days, we come to the last day of the stay of the party
at Camden Harbour, where he concludes thus:&mdash;"The coast-line
within the harbour is everywhere indented with beautiful bays;
there are several picturesque islands, on nearly all of which we
find abundance of fresh water; nearly every valley, too, has its
rippling brook running down to the blue waters of the harbour.
Grass is plentiful in any direction."</p>
<p>I have quoted all these passages to show the nature of the
Doctor's statements about the appearance of the country, &amp;c.,
and I now wish to prove how he was supported or borne out in
these statements. I hope I shall not be too tedious in trying to
do this, for the matter seems to me an important one, as not only
here, or in this and his own colony has Dr. Martin been spoken
against, but these remarks have been repeated in England, where
his journals have been received, commented on, and by some
objected to as untruthful, and this by parties who, though
persons of note in their several occupations, have had not only
no personal acquaintance with the country described, but very
little personal knowledge of any one <i>from</i> thence;
arguing therefore, upon unsupported statements, suppositions, and
analogies.</p>
<p>To continue. Each of the two expedition bodies&mdash;that of
1863 and 1864&mdash;consisted of several individuals. There were
ten in the first; in the second the number is not stated. Now
these persons confirm Dr. Martin's report of the nature and
productions of the country traversed, which reports must
therefore either be true, or there was a conspiracy or agreement
among all of them to intentionally deceive&mdash;which latter is
in the last degree improbable; and I wish to draw particular
attention to the report of Mr. Panter, a member of the second
expedition. In his journal&mdash;a clear and concise one&mdash;he
says:&mdash;"The day after my arrival at Brecknock Harbour I
started inland with a party, consisting of Dr. Martin, Mr. David
Shields (first mate of the vessel), and native Dundale). We
travelled over about 90 miles of country, which for
pastoral&mdash;and most, of it for agricultural&mdash;purposes
could not be excelled. I refrain from entering into minute
details concerning the soil, its capabilities, &amp;c., as Dr.
Martin will do so in his report. The country we travelled over is
abundantly watered by rivers and streams. . . . I visited many of
the islands outside of Camden Harbour, all of which, with two
exceptions, I found to be permanently watered. Augustus and Byam
Martin's were the two largest islands I landed upon. The former,
which contains about 56,000 acres, is luxuriantly-grassed, and
watered by numerous streams. The latter is well watered, but not
so well grassed, and contains 12,000 acres. All the islands are
very stony, including the above two islands. I think I may safely
assert that in the vicinity of Brecknock and Camden Harbours
there are 1,680,000 acres of laud which could scarcely be
surpassed, if equalled. I have every reason to believe that,
there are immense tracts of similar country both to the south and
eastward of Brecknock Harbour. . . . I have not the slightest
doubt in my own mind that the whole of Dampier's Land, containing
2,400,000 acres, is a rich pastoral country." And
again:&mdash;"Including Dampier's land, the total number of good
pastoral land discovered may be safely estimated at 5,592,000
acres. The land in the vicinity of Brecknock Harbour exceeds
anything I have ever seen before. From my own experience I can
confidently state that the land in the vicinity of Roebuck Bay
would bear favourable comparison with some of the best runs in
Victoria." After some further remarks Mr. Panter says:&mdash;"In
Dr. Martin's report much more valuable information will he found.
It is only due to that gentleman to state that he was always
ready and willing to give me any assistance in his power."</p>
<p>I will not further weary you with these extracts; but I think
some will agree with me that Mr. Panter's reports about the
grassy state of the country are more strongly expressed than even
Dr. Martin's.</p>
<p>After the settlers, sheep-farmers, and others had gone to
Camden Harbour and failed, we have the notes of a late visitor to
the spot in the person of Mr. J. P. Stow, the head of the "boat
party" before mentioned from Adam Bay, who says in his pamphlet
(p. 5):&mdash;"The whole scheme for settling Camden Harbour was
rash and ill considered. How far the Association were to blame I
would not venture to say; but it is fair to suppose they knew
nothing of the character of the country they induced so many poor
men to try and settle in to their ruin. The victims blame
principally Dr. Martin, who visited that part of the coast, and
published a journal more valuable as a scientific work than as a
guide to squatters and other settlers, for having given such
inaccurate accounts of the country. Having read Dr. Martin's work
I came to the conclusion that his description of the land was, in
the main, correct. He describes it as dreadfully stony and as
having high, rank grass; but then he concludes by giving an
opinion that sheep would thrive there."</p>
<p>This is further proof, first that Dr. Martin did not misstate
facts&mdash;if he erred it was only in opinions&mdash;and second,
that he had <i>not</i> given inaccurate accounts of the
country. Intending settlers, however, said "we did not on arrival
there find the country as he describes it." This is very
possible. We all know, whether residents in New South Wales,
Victoria, or this colony how different certain parts of it look
in different years&mdash;from the prevalence of heat, or the want
of water, and other climatic influences&mdash;and even how
totally altered in appearance will the same spot of ground,
whether cultivated or not, be at different seasons or months in
the same year&mdash;say, February and August&mdash;so that
persons who have been away either abroad or in other colonies
between these periods would hardly know the place again on their
return. Another matter, too, has not been borne sufficiently in
mind by settlers in other colonies, that is, the difference in
seasons and climate between the country south of Champion Bay and
that north of Cape Cuvier and the North-West Cape, where the
coast-line turns boldly to the north-east. Among other things
there are what may be called two wet and one dry season in the
latter country, and great heats frequently in what we here call
our winter months. These I shall notice more in my next paper,
but will just say here that one of the hottest days the exploring
party experienced was the 19th July, in the district of the
Glenelg, when the thermometer at midday stood at 122° in the sun
and 94° in the shade. It is hot there until December, when the
rain commences.</p>
<p>To draw this part of my paper to a conclusion, I will name
only one other objection made&mdash;that Dr. Martin had reasons
of his own for thus publishing his journals. What these reasons
are or were it would be difficult to say&mdash;not for any
pecuniary advantage all who knew him would be convinced. In one
of his early letters to me he says:&mdash;"It may, perhaps,
surprise you to learn that, with the exception of a single grant
of £50, the whole of my expenses in explorations during the last
two years have been defrayed from my own resources&mdash;the
amount exceeding £500. As you may, perhaps, have seen in the
Western Australian papers, the Governor in Council expresses his
wish to give; me an appointment, but this I could not for an
instant, entertain, so long as this remains a convict colony." In
two of his letters of a later date about the Camden Harbour
Settlement he writes:&mdash;"Of course you have heard of the
miserable failure at Camden Harbour. I am sorry it so happened.
Opinions as adverse to the settlement of Champion Bay delayed its
occupation ten years. (See Stokes, vol. 2, pp. 380-394.) Champion
Bay district has been the mainstay of the colony for the past ten
years. At Roebuck Bay the Sheep Company promises to be a great
success. At Nicol bay I many settlers from the eastern colonies
are established." And further:&mdash;"Of the Camden Harbour
settlement and its present failure I am vexed beyond measure. The
miserable want of success will but delay its occupation for at
time, for there is good country, abundantly watered. The
Resident's last despatch speaks, it anything, more favourably
than I spoke of it. I cannot conceive the cause of the instant
failure of the Camden Harbour Association."</p>
<p>I will here take leave of this part of my subject, but shall,
perhaps, briefly allude to it again in a future paper, when I
have..to mention the anchorages in Camden Bay and other places;
for, as Dr. Martin is accused of painting everything <i>couleur
de rose</i>, it will be seen that in this and other instances
they are of quite a different complexion.</p>
<p>To proceed now with the explorations. The coast-line of
Western Australia, as far north as Champion Bay, has long been
known, and I shall have to notice, therefore, the principal
places touched at or spoken of to the north of this. I shall do
so at present in general terms, using the names of former
explorers when I come to particularize. First, of Dr. Martin's
observations, coasting upwards; then, of the "Forlorn Hope"
downwards from Adam Bay.</p>
<p>Dr. Martin's first exploration was commenced in June, 1863,
with a party of ten persons, as before mentioned. Four of these
acted as the exploring patty, the other six as a depot. The
course of the expedition was, briefly, thus:&mdash;From Perth to
Champion Bay; thence to the Glenelg River; from this place the
exploring party went overland to Camden Harbour, and afterwards
to the country south-west of the Glenelg; from the Glenelg to
Collier Bay, Nicol Bay, Lewis's Island; thence back to Champion
Bay. The second expedition was undertaken in 1864, from 10th
March to the end of May. First, from Champion Bay to Camden
Harbour, as before; this was followed by land explorations in
different directions from that place; then to Brecknock Harbour
and neighbourhood; to Roebuck Bay and adjacent country; and
thence back to Fremantle. Most or all these places are shown in
the maps of the West Australian coast made before that time, and
many other places are noted and named since, which I will speak
of on a future occasion.</p>
<p>Mr. J. P. Stow's course was:&mdash;From Adam Bay, to Chambers
Bay; then passed Vernon Islands to Port Paterson; by Cape Blaze
into Anson Bay; by Cape Dombey; across Cambridge Gulf; then
passed Capes Bernier and Londonderry, into Vansittart Bay; and
last, by Troughton Island to Camden Harbour.</p>
<p>All the explorers describe nearly the whole line of coast as
excessively rocky, sterile, and bare of vegetation, except
mangroves, with a little grass here and there, often in the most
inaccessible and least likely places, but generally of a coarse
kind, and on the more level country in tufts or patches.</p>
<p>Trees on the coast were usually scarce, but more inland were
of various kinds hitherto rare, and some of a gigantic size, in
most respects differing from those of these southern parts.</p>
<p>It is remarkable how all the coast-line and sometimes the
country extending inland is generally wanting in that fertility
which is so prevalent on the eastern and southern shores; and
this want appears to continue far upwards towards the northern
coast. The question here arises, why are the north-west coasts of
Australia so different to the fertile state of most of the
islands of the East Indian Archipelago? Are they unfed by the
numerous showers and storm-charged winds that the smaller islands
are subject to; or are they more affected by hot winds at some
parts, and by counteracting influences at others on the extended
coast-line? Explorers and meteorologists are in doubt or at
variance as to the causes. The islands, too, which are so
numerous on the western coast that Mr. Stow in his Journal says
"after leaving Cape Bougainville we passed at least 500," are
described as mostly bare and bleak in he extreme&mdash;"the
picture of desolation, without any sign of life."&mdash;no
wandering or migratory bird is thereby invited to rest on them to
deposit, as in other more favourable spots, the fertilizing
guano, from which seeds carried by winds, currents, or the birds
themselves spring and grow to large forests. These islands,
however, nearly all require examination as to their productive
capabilities, and as so many of them lie adjacent to the coast
they would naturally be included in coast explorations.</p>
<p>Dr. Martin's furthest point north appears to have been Camden
Bay and neighbourhood. Stow's subsequent boat voyage gives,
therefore, the latest account of the coast between that place and
Adam Bay. Within half a degree of the latter place and Port.
Essington, including Melville Island, which was frequently
visited nearly forty years ago, the country is thoroughly known
(or rather was) to the Port Essington settlers. The late G. W.
Earl, Esq., has told me that he has over and over again been as
it were in every nook and cranny of the country round about. This
now completes the line of the coast all round our island, with
the exception of the shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria and
upwards to Cape York. The coast-line of these has, of course,
also long been laid down and traversed of late years by the
lamented Leichardt and others, but I believe no complete
explorations have been made.</p>
<p>In the north-west coast, between Fremantle and Adam Bay,
certain spots on the mainland and some of the islands and smaller
bays are called by different names in different charts, and
others are mentioned in one chart and not in another, but the
principal ones, or those longest known remain unaltered. In my
next paper I intend to notice the natural productions of these
shores, coasting from Fremantle upwards, which I have not space
or time to mention here. Those discovered by Dr. Martin are
exceedingly numerous, curious, and interesting, and in all the
three kingdoms; but, as he has given separately the items of each
day, or Journal-fashion, they require to be analyzed or
classified. Then we have several jottings by Mr. Stow, and others
previously by G. W. Earl,&mdash;Gregory, and Sir Geo. Grey (then
Capt. Grey) in his travels on those parts of the coast. Sir
George Grey is a professed naturalist, and was in his younger
days an ardent one. I am still favoured with occasional
communications from him.</p>
<p>A few words before I conclude about our Northern Territory, so
called. The colonization of this distant spot is still an
engrossing theme, and has acquired greater interest, if possible,
from late events. It will I trust be our lot to know, should it
fall into other hands, that they will at least be those of some
of our <i>Australian</i> Colonies. If we cannot colonize it
others will try. But may the British flag be successful to mark
colonization as it has done conquest in every quarter of the
globe. Other places, other colonies, at their
commencement&mdash;that of South Australia among the
number&mdash;have had difficulties to contend with. It would
never do to resign without a struggle such a fertile soil, which,
aided by its intertropical climate, is ready and offered to the
hand of man to cultivate and improve&mdash;neglected as all this
is by the original inhabitants of the soil, according to their
usual inherent indolent and wandering habits. Let us do this,
while we remember their rights of priority and possession, and
hold out to them certain advantages or privileges in place of the
same. That whole extent of country, open as it is to direct
communication with all the productive islands of the East Indian
Archipelago, will form in its ports the mart or keystone of the
trade and commerce of the Australias, as do Rio and Para of the
South American continent, and be hereafter, perhaps, the noblest
of Her Most Gracious Majesty's possessions in the southern
hemisphere.</p>
