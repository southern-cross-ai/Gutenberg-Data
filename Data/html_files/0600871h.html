<h2><a id="ch1" name="ch1">1. &mdash; VOODOO</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE twigs which N'Longa flung on the fire broke
and crackled. The upleaping flames lighted the countenances of the
two men. N'Longa, voodoo man of the Slave Coast, was very old. His
wizened and gnarled frame was stooped and brittle, his face creased
by hundreds of wrinkles. The red firelight glinted on the human
finger-bones which composed his necklace.</p>

<p>The other was an Englishman, and his name was Solomon Kane. He
was tall and broad-shouldered, clad in black close garments, the
garb of the Puritan. His featherless slouch hat was drawn low over
his heavy brows, shadowing his darkly pallid face. His cold deep
eyes brooded in the firelight.</p>

<p>"You come again, brother," droned the fetish-man, speaking in
the jargon which passed for a common language of black man and
white on the West Coast. "Many moons burn and die since we make
blood-palaver. You go to the setting sun, but you come back!"</p>

<p>"Aye," Kane's voice was deep and almost ghostly. "Yours is a
grim land, N'Longa, a red land barred with the black darkness of
horror and the bloody shadows of death. Yet I have returned."</p>

<p>N'Longa stirred the fire, saying nothing, and after a pause Kane
continued.</p>

<p>"Yonder in the unknown vastness"&mdash;his long finger stabbed
at the black silent jungle which brooded beyond the
firelight&mdash;"yonder lie mystery and adventure and nameless
terror. Once I dared the jungle&mdash;once she nearly claimed my
bones. Something entered into my blood, something stole into my
soul like a whisper of unnamed sin. The jungle! Dark and
brooding&mdash;over leagues of the blue salt sea she has drawn me
and with the dawn I go to seek the heart of her. Mayhap I shall
find curious adventure&mdash;mayhap my doom awaits me. But better
death than the ceaseless and everlasting urge, the fire that has
burned my veins with bitter longing."</p>

<p>"She call," muttered N'Longa. "At night she coil like serpent
about my hut and whisper strange things to me. Ai ya! The jungle
call. We be blood brothers, you and I. Me, N'Longa, mighty worker
of nameless magic! You go to the jungle as all men go who hear her
call. Maybe you live, more like you die. You believe in my fetish
work?"</p>

<p>"I understand it not," said Kane grimly, "but I have seen you
send your soul forth from your body to animate a lifeless
corpse."</p>

<p>"Aye! Me N'Longa! priest of the Black God! Now watch, I make
magic."</p>

<p>Kane gazed at the old voodoo man who bent over the fire, making
even motions with his hands and mumbling incantations. Kane
watched, and he seemed to grow sleepy. A mist wavered in front of
him, through which he saw dimly the form of N'Longa, etched dark
against the flames. Then it faded out.</p>

<p>Kane awoke with a start, hand shooting to the pistol in his
belt. N'Longa grinned at him across the flame, and there was a
scent of early dawn in the air. The fetish-man held a long stave of
curious black wood in his hands. This stave was carved in a strange
manner, and one end tapered to a sharp point.</p>

<p>"This voodoo staff," said N'Longa, putting it in the
Englishman's hand. "Where your guns and long knife fail, this save
you. When you want me, lay this on your breast, fold your hands on
it and sleep. I come to you in your dreams."</p>

<p>Kane weighed the thing in his hand, highly suspicious of
witchcraft. It was not heavy, but seemed as hard as iron. A good
weapon at least, he decided. Dawn was just beginning to steal over
the jungle and the river.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch2" name="ch2">2. &mdash; RED EYES</a></h2>

<p class="first">SOLOMON KANE shifted his musket from his shoulder
and let the stock fall to the earth. Silence lay about him like a
fog. Kane's lined face and tattered garments showed the effect of
long bush travel. He looked about him.</p>

<p>Some distance behind him loomed the green, rank jungle, thinning
out to low shrubs, stunted trees and tall grass. Some distance in
front of him rose the first of a chain of bare, sombre hills,
littered with boulders, shimmering in the merciless heat of the
sun. Between the hills and the jungle lay a broad expanse of rough,
uneven grasslands, dotted here and there by clumps of thorn
trees.</p>

<p>An utter silence hung over the country. The only sign of life
was a few vultures flapping heavily across the distant hills. For
the last few days Kane had noticed the increasing number of these
unsavoury birds. The sun was rocking westward but its heat was in
no way abated.</p>

<p>Trailing his musket he started forward slowly. He had no
objective in view. This was all unknown country and one direction
was as good as another. Many weeks ago he had plunged into the
jungle with the assurance born of courage and ignorance. Having by
some miracle survived the first few weeks, he was becoming hard and
toughened, able to hold his own with any of the grim denizens of
the fastness he dared.</p>

<p>As he progressed he noted an occasional lion spoor but there
seemed to be no animals in the grasslands&mdash;none that left
tracks, at any rate. Vultures sat like black, brooding images in
some of the stunted trees, and suddenly he saw an activity among
them some distance beyond. Several of the dusky birds circled about
a clump of high grass, dipping, then rising again. Some beast of
prey was defending his kill against them, Kane decided, and
wondered at the lack of snarling and roaring which usually
accompanied such scenes. His curiosity was roused and he turned his
steps in that direction.</p>

<p>At last, pushing through the grass which rose about his
shoulders, he saw, as through a corridor walled with the rank
waving blades, a ghastly sight. The corpse of a black man lay, face
down, and as the Englishman looked, a great dark snake rose and
slid away into the grass, moving so quickly that Kane was unable to
decide its nature. But it had a weird human-like suggestion about
it.</p>

<p>Kane stood over the body, noting that while the limbs lay awry
as if broken, the flesh was not torn as a lion or leopard would
have torn it. He glanced up at the whirling vultures and was amazed
to see several of them skimming along close to the earth, following
a waving of the grass which marked the flight of the thing which
had presumably slain the black man. Kane wondered what thing the
carrion birds, which eat only the dead, were hunting through the
grasslands. But Africa is full of never-explained mysteries.</p>

<p>Kane shrugged his shoulders and lifted his musket again.
Adventures he had had in plenty since he parted from N'Longa some
moons agone, but still that nameless paranoid urge had driven him
on and on, deeper and deeper into those trackless ways. Kane could
not have analysed this call; he would have attributed it to Satan,
who lures men to their destruction. But it was but the restless
turbulent spirit of the adventurer, the wanderer&mdash;the same
urge which sends the gipsy caravans about the world, which drove
the Viking galleys over unknown seas and which guides the flights
of the wild geese.</p>

<p>Kane sighed. Here in this barren land seemed neither food nor
water, but he had wearied unto death of the dank, rank venom of the
thick jungle. Even a wilderness of bare hills was preferable, for a
time at least. He glanced at them, where they lay brooding in the
sun, and started forward again.</p>

<p>He held N'Longa's fetish stave in his left hand, and though his
conscience still troubled him for keeping a thing so apparently
diabolic in nature, he had never been able to bring himself to
throw it away.</p>

<p>Now as he went toward the hills, a sudden commotion broke out in
the tall grass in front of him, which was, in places, taller than a
man. A thin, high-pitched scream sounded and on its heels an
earth-shaking roar. The grass parted and a slim figure came flying
toward him like a wisp of straw blown on the wind&mdash;a
brown-skinned girl, clad only in a skirt-like garment. Behind her,
some yards away but gaining swiftly, came a huge lion.</p>

<p>The girl fell at Kane's feet with a wail and a sob, and lay
clutching at his ankles. The Englishman dropped the voodoo stave,
raised his musket to his shoulder and sighted coolly at the
ferocious feline face which neared him every instant. Crash! The
girl screamed once and slumped on her face. The huge cat leaped
high and wildly, to fall and lie motionless.</p>

<p><br>
KANE reloaded hastily before he spared a glance at the form at
his feet. The girl lay as still as the lion he had just slain, but
a quick examination showed that she had only fainted.</p>

<p>He bathed her face with water from his canteen and presently she
opened her eyes and sat up. Fear flooded her face as she looked at
her rescuer, and she made to rise.</p>

<p>Kane held out a restraining hand and she cowered down,
trembling. The roar of his heavy musket was enough to frighten any
native who had never before seen a white man, Kane reflected.</p>

<p>The girl was slim and well-formed. Her nose was straight and
thin-bridged. She was a deep brown in colour, perhaps with a strong
Berber strain.</p>

<p>Kane spoke to her in a river dialect, a simple language he had
learned during his wanderings and she replied haltingly. The inland
tribe traded slaves and ivory to the river people and were familiar
with their jargon.</p>

<p>"My village is there," she answered Kane's question, pointing to
the southern jungle with a slim, rounded arm. "My name is Zunna. My
mother whipped me for breaking a cooking-kettle and I ran away
because I was angry. I am afraid; let me go back to my mother!"</p>

<p>"You may go," said Kane, "but I will take you, child. Suppose
another lion came along? You were very foolish to run away."</p>

<p>She whimpered a little. "Are you not a god?"</p>

<p>"No. Zunna. I am only a man, though the colour of my skin is not
as yours. Lead me now to your village."</p>

<p>She rose hesitantly, eyeing him apprehensively through the wild
tangle of her hair. To Kane she seemed like some frightened young
animal. She led the way and Kane followed. She indicated that her
village lay to the southeast, and their route brought them nearer
to the hills. The sun began to sink and the roaring of lions
reverberated over the grasslands. Kane glanced at the western sky;
open country was no place in which to be caught by night. He
glanced toward the hills and saw that they were within a few
hundred yards of the nearest. He saw what seemed to be a cave.</p>

<p>"Zunna," said he haltingly, "we can never reach your village
before nightfall. If we bide here the lions will take us. Yonder is
a cavern where we may spend the night&mdash;"</p>

<p>She shrank and trembled.</p>

<p>"Not in the hills, master!" she whimpered. "Better the
lions!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" His tone was impatient; he had had enough of native
superstition. "We will spend the night in yonder cave."</p>

<p>She argued no further, but followed him. They went up a short
slope and stood at the mouth of the cavern, a small affair, with
sides of solid rock and floor of deep sand.</p>

<p>"Gather some dry grass, Zunna," commanded Kane, standing his
musket against the wall at the mouth of the cave, "but go not far
away, and listen for lions. I will build here a fire which shall
keep us safe from beasts tonight. Bring some grass and twigs you
may find, like a good child, and we will sup. I have dried meat in
my pouch and water also."</p>

<p>She gave him a strange, long glance, then turned away without a
word. Kane tore up grass near at hand, noting how it was seared and
crisp from the sun, and heaping it up, struck flint and steel.
Flame leaped up and devoured the heap in an instant. He was
wondering how he could gather enough grass to keep a fire going all
night, when he was aware that he had visitors.</p>

<p>Kane was used to grotesque sights, but at first glance he
started and a slight coldness travelled down his spine. Two men
stood before him in silence. They were tall and gaunt and entirely
naked. Their skins were a dusty black, tinged with a grey, ashy
hue, as of death. Their faces were different from any he had ever
seen. The brows were high and narrow, the noses huge and
snout-like; the eyes were inhumanly large and inhumanly red. As the
two stood there it seemed to Kane that only their burning eyes
lived.</p>

<p>He spoke to them, but they did not answer. He invited them to
eat with a motion of his hand, and they silently squatted down near
the cave mouth, as far from the dying embers of the fire as they
could get.</p>

<p>Kane turned to his pouch and began taking out the strips of
dried meat which he carried. Once he glanced at his silent guests;
it seemed to him that they were watching the glowing ashes of his
fire, rather than him.</p>

<p>The sun was about to sink behind the western horizon. A red,
fierce glow spread over the grasslands, so that it seemed like a
waving sea of blood. Kane knelt over his pouch, and glancing up,
saw Zunna come around the shoulder of the hill with her arms full
of grass and dry branches.</p>

<p>As he looked, her eyes flared wide; the branches dropped from
her arms and her scream knifed the silence, fraught with terrible
warning. Kane whirled on his knee. Two great forms loomed over him
as he came up with the lithe motion of a springing leopard. The
fetish stave was in his hand and he drove it through the body of
the nearest foe with a force which sent its sharp point out between
the man's shoulders. Then the long, lean arms of the other locked
about him, and the two went down together.</p>

<p>The talon-like nails of the stranger were tearing at his face,
the hideous red eyes staring into his with a terrible threat, as
Kane writhed about and, fending off the clawing hands with one arm,
drew a pistol. He pressed the muzzle close against the savage side
and pulled the trigger. At the muffled report, the stranger's body
jerked to the concussion of the bullet, but the thick lips merely
gaped in a horrid grin.</p>

<p>One long arm slid under Kane's shoulders, the other hand gripped
his hair, the Englishman felt his head being forced back
irresistibly. He clutched at the other's wrists with both hands,
but the flesh under his frantic fingers was as hard as wood. Kane's
brain was reeling; his neck seemed ready to break with a little
more pressure. He threw his body backward with one volcanic effort,
breaking the deadly hold. The other was on him, and the talons were
clutching again. Kane found and raised the empty pistol, and he
felt the man's skull cave in like a shell as he brought down the
long barrel with all his strength. And once again the writhing lips
parted in fearful mockery.</p>

<p>And now a near panic clutched Kane. What sort of man was this,
who still menaced his life with tearing fingers, after having been
shot and mortally bludgeoned? No man, surely, but one of the sons
of Satan! At the thought Kane wrenched and heaved explosively, and
the close-locked combatants tumbled across the earth to come to a
rest in the smouldering ashes before the cave mouth. Kane barely
felt the heat, but the mouth of his foe gaped, this time in seeming
agony. The frightful fingers loosened their hold and Kane sprang
clear.</p>

<p>The savage creature with his shattered skull was rising on one
hand and one knee when Kane struck, returning to the attack as a
gaunt wolf returns to a wounded bison. From the side he leaped,
landing full on the sinewy back, his steely arms seeking and
finding a deadly wrestling hold; and as they went to the earth
together he broke the other's neck, so that the hideous dead face
looked back over one shoulder. The body lay still but to Kane it
seemed that it was not dead even then, for the red eyes still
burned with their grisly light.</p>

<p>The Englishman turned, to see the girl crouching against the
cave wall. He looked for his stave; it lay in a heap of dust, among
which were a few mouldering bones. He stared, his brain reeling.
Then with one stride he caught up the voodoo staff and turned to
the fallen man. His face set in grim lines as he raised it; then he
drove it through the savage breast. And before his eyes, the great
body crumbled, dissolving to dust as he watched horror-struck, even
as the first opponent had crumbled when Kane had first thrust the
stave.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch3" name="ch3">3. &mdash; DREAM MAGIC</a></h2>

<p class="first">"GREAT GOD!" whispered Kane. "The men were dead!
Vampires! This is Satan's handiwork manifested."</p>

<p>Zunna crawled to his knees and clung there.</p>

<p>"These be walking dead men, master," she whimpered. "I should
have warned you."</p>

<p>"Why did they not leap on my back when they first came?" asked
he.</p>

<p>"They feared the fire. They were waiting for the embers to die
entirely."</p>

<p>"Whence came they?"</p>

<p>"From the hills. Hundreds of their kind swarm among the boulders
and caverns of these hills, and they live on human life, for a man
they will slay, devouring his ghost as it leaves his quivering
body. Aye, they are suckers of souls!</p>

<p>"Master, among the greater of these hills there is a silent city
of stone, and in the old times, in the days of my ancestors, these
people lived there. They were human, but they were not as we, for
they had ruled this land for ages and ages. The ancestors of my
people made war on them and slew many, and their magicians made all
the dead men as these were. At last all died.</p>

<p>"And for ages have they preyed on the tribes of the jungle,
stalking down from the hills at midnight and at sunset to haunt the
jungle-ways and slay and slay. Men and beasts flee them and only
fire will destroy them."</p>

<p>"Here is that which will destroy them," said Kane grimly,
raising the voodoo stave. "Black magic must fight black magic, and
I know not what spell N'Longa put hereon, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are a god," Zunna decided aloud. "No man could overcome two
of the walking dead men. Master, can you not lift this curse from
my tribe? There is nowhere for us to flee and the monsters slay us
at will, catching wayfarers outside the village wall. Death is on
this land and we die helpless!"</p>

<p>Deep in Kane stirred the spirit of the crusader, the fire of the
zealot&mdash;the fanatic who devotes his life to battling the
powers of darkness.</p>

<p>"Let us eat," said he; "then we will build a great fire at the
cave mouth. The fire which keeps away beasts shall also keep away
fiends."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Later Kane sat just inside the cave, chin rested on clenched
fist, eyes gazing unseeingly into the fire. Behind in the shadows,
Zunna watched him, awed.</p>

<p>"God of Hosts," Kane muttered, "grant me aid! My hand it is
which must lift the ancient curse from this dark land. How am I to
fight these dead fiends, who yield not to mortal weapons? Fire will
destroy them&mdash;a broken neck renders them helpless&mdash;the
voodoo stave thrust through them crumbles them to dust&mdash;but of
what avail? How may I prevail against the hundreds who haunt these
hills, and to whom human life-essence is Life? Have not&mdash;as
Zunna says&mdash;warriors come against them in the past, only to
find them fled to their high-walled city where no man can come
against them?"</p>

<p>The night wore on. Zunna slept, her cheek pillowed on her round,
girlish arm. The roaring of the lions shook the hills and still
Kane sat and gazed broodingly into the fire. Outside, the night was
alive with whispers and rustlings and stealthily soft footfalls.
And at times Kane, glancing up from his meditations, seemed to
catch the gleam of great red eyes beyond the flickering light of
the fire.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Grey dawn was stealing over the grasslands when Kane shook Zunna
into wakefulness.</p>

<p>"God have mercy on my soul for delving in barbaric magic," said
he, "but demonry must be fought with demonry, mayhap. Tend ye the
fire and awake me if aught untoward occur."</p>

<p>Kane lay down on his back on the sand floor and laid the voodoo
staff on his breast, folding his hands upon it. He fell asleep
instantly. And sleeping, he dreamed. To his slumbering self it
seemed that he walked through a thick fog and in this fog he met
N'Longa, true to life. N'Longa spoke, and the words were clear and
vivid, impressing themselves on his consciousness so deeply as to
span the gap between sleeping and waking.</p>

<p>"Send this girl to her village soon after sun-up when the lions
have gone to their lairs," said N'Longa, "and bid her bring her
lover to you at this cave. There make him lie down as if to
slumber, holding the voodoo stave."</p>

<p>The dream faded and Kane awoke suddenly, wondering. How strange
and vivid had been the vision, and how strange to hear N'Longa
talking in English, without the jargon! Kane shrugged his
shoulders. He knew that N'Longa claimed to possess the power of
sending his spirit through space, and he himself had seen the
voodoo man animate a dead man's body. Still&mdash;</p>

<p>"Zunna," said Kane, giving the problem up, "I will go with you
as far as the edge of the jungle and you must go on to your village
and return here to this cave with your lover."</p>

<p>"Kran?" she asked naively.</p>

<p>"Whatever his name is. Eat and we will go."</p>

<p><br>
AGAIN the sun slanted toward the west. Kane sat in the cave,
waiting. He had seen the girl safely to the place where the jungle
thinned to the grasslands, and though his conscience stung him at
the thought of the dangers which might confront her, he sent her on
alone and returned to the cave. He sat now, wondering if he would
not be damned to everlasting flames for tinkering with the magic of
a black sorcerer, blood-brother or not.</p>

<p>Light footfalls sounded, and as Kane reached for his musket,
Zunna entered, accompanied by a tall, splendidly proportioned youth
whose brown skin showed that he was of the same race as the girl.
His soft dreamy eyes were fixed on Kane in a sort of awesome
worship. Evidently the girl had not minimized this new god's glory
in her telling.</p>

<p>He bade the youth lie down as he directed and placed the voodoo
stave in his hands. Zunna crouched at one side, wide-eyed. Kane
stepped back, half ashamed of this mummery and wondering what, if
anything, would come of it. Then to his horror, the youth gave one
gasp and stiffened!</p>

<p>Zunna screamed, bounding erect&mdash;"You have killed Kran!" she
shrieked, flying at the Englishman who stood struck speechless.</p>

<p>Then she halted suddenly, wavered, drew a hand languidly across
her brow&mdash;she slid down to lie with her arms about the
motionless body of her lover.</p>

<p>And this body moved suddenly, made aimless motions with hands
and feet, then sat up, disengaging itself from the clinging arms of
the still senseless girl.</p>

<p>Kran looked up at Kane and grinned, a sly, knowing grin which
seemed out of place on his face somehow. Kane started. Those soft
eyes had changed in expression and were now hard and glittering and
snaky&mdash;N'Longa's eyes!</p>

<p>"Ai ya," said Kran in a grotesquely familiar voice.
"Blood-brother, you got no greeting for N'Longa?"</p>

<p>Kane was silent. His flesh crawled in spite of
himself&mdash;Kran rose and stretched his arms in an unfamiliar
sort of way, as if his limbs were new to him. He slapped his breast
approvingly.</p>

<p>"Me N'Longa!" said he in the old boastful manner. "Mighty ju-ju
man! Blood-brother, not you know me, eh?"</p>

<p>"You are Satan," said Kane sincerely. "Are you Kran or are you
N'Longa?"</p>

<p>"Me N'Longa," assured the other. "My body sleep in ju-ju hut on
Coast many treks from here. I borrow Kran's body for while. My
ghost travel ten days march in one breath; twenty days march in
same time. My ghost go out from my body and drive out Kran's."</p>

<p>"And Kran is dead?"</p>

<p>"No, he no dead. I send his ghost to shadow-land for a
while&mdash;send the girl's ghost too, to keep him company; bimeby
come back."</p>

<p>"This is the work of the Devil," said Kane frankly, "but I have
seen you do even fouler magic&mdash;shall I call you N'Longa or
Kran?"</p>

<p>"Kran&mdash;kah! Me N'Longa&mdash;bodies like clothes! Me
N'Longa, in here now!" he rapped his breast. "Bimeby Kran live
along here&mdash;then he be Kran and I be N'Longa, same like
before. Kran no live along now; N'Longa live along this one fellow
body. Blood-brother, I am N'Longa!"</p>

<p>Kane nodded. This was in truth a land of horror and enchantment;
anything was possible, even that the thin voice of N'Longa should
speak to him from the great chest of Kran, and the snaky eyes of
N'Longa should blink at him from the handsome young face of
Kran.</p>

<p>"This land I know long time," said N'Longa, getting down to
business. "Mighty ju-ju, these dead people! No need to waste one
fellow time&mdash;I know&mdash;I talk to you in sleep. My
blood-brother want to kill out these dead fellows, eh?"</p>

<p>"'Tis a thing opposed to nature," said Kane sombrely. "They are
known in my land as vampires. I never expected to come upon a whole
nation of them."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch4" name="ch4">4. &mdash; THE SILENT CITY</a></h2>

<p class="first">"NOW we find this stone city," said N'Longa.</p>

<p>"Yes? Why not send your ghost out to kill these vampires?" Kane
asked idly.</p>

<p>"Ghost got to have one fellow body to work in." N'Longa
answered. "Sleep now. Tomorrow we start."</p>

<p>The sun had set; the fire glowed and flickered in the cave
mouth. Kane glanced at the still form of the girl, who lay where
she had fallen, and prepared himself for slumber.</p>

<p>"Awake me at midnight," he admonished, "and I will watch from
then until dawn."</p>

<p>But when N'Longa finally shook his arm, Kane awoke to see the
first light of dawn reddening the land.</p>

<p>"Time we start," said the fetish-man.</p>

<p>"But the girl&mdash;are you sure she lives?"</p>

<p>"She live, blood-brother."</p>

<p>"Then in God's name, we can not leave her here at the mercy of
any prowling fiend who might chance upon her. Or some lion
might&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No lion come. Vampire scent still linger, mixed with man scent.
One fellow lion he no like man scent and he fear the walking dead
men. No beast come, and"&mdash;lifting the voodoo stave and laying
it across the cave entrance&mdash;"no dead man come now."</p>

<p>Kane watched him sombrely and without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"How will that rod safeguard her?"</p>

<p>"That mighty ju-ju," said N'Longa. "You see how one fellow
vampire go along dust alongside that stave! No vampire dare touch
or come near it. I gave it to you, because outside Vampire Hills
one fellow man sometimes meet a corpse walking in jungle when
shadows be black. Not all walking dead men be here. And all must
suck Life from men&mdash;if not, they rot like dead wood."</p>

<p>"Then make many of these rods and arm the people with them."</p>

<p>"No can do!" N'Longa's skull shook violently. "That ju-ju rod be
mighty magic! Old, old! No man live today can tell how old that
fellow ju-ju stave be. I make my blood-brother sleep and do magic
with it to guard him, that time we make palaver in Coast village.
Today we scout and run, no need it. Leave it here to guard
girl."</p>

<p>Kane shrugged his shoulders and followed the fetish-man, after
glancing back at the still shape which lay in the cave. He would
never have agreed to leave her so casually, had he not believed in
his heart that she was dead. He had touched her, and her flesh was
cold.</p>

<p>They went up among the barren hills as the sun was rising.
Higher they climbed, up steep clay slopes, winding their way
through ravines and between great boulders. The hills were
honey-combed with dark, forbidding caves, and these they passed
warily, and Kane's flesh crawled as he thought of the grisly
occupants therein. For N'Longa said:</p>

<p>"Them vampires, he sleep in caves most all day till sunset. Them
caves, he be full of one fellow dead man."</p>

<p>The sun rose higher, baking down on the bare slopes with an
intolerable heat. Silence brooded like an evil monster over the
land. They had seen nothing, but Kane could have sworn at times
that a black shadow drifted behind a boulder at their approach.</p>

<p>"Them vampires, they stay hid in daytime." said N'Longa with a
low laugh. "They be afraid of one fellow vulture! No fool vulture!
He know death when he see it! He pounce on one fellow dead man and
tear and eat if he be lying or walking!"</p>

<p>A strong shudder shook his companion.</p>

<p>"Great God!" Kane cried, striking his thigh with his hat; "is
there no end to the horror of this hideous land? Truly this land is
dedicated to the powers of darkness!"</p>

<p>Kane's eyes burned with a dangerous light. The terrible heat,
the solitude and the knowledge of the horrors lurking on either
hand were shaking even his steely nerves.</p>

<p>"Keep on one fellow hat, blood-brother," admonished N'Longa with
a low gurgle of amusement. "That fellow sun, he knock you dead,
suppose you no look out."</p>

<p>Kane shifted the musket he had insisted on bringing and made no
reply. They mounted an eminence at last and looked down on a sort
of plateau. And in the centre of this plateau was a silent city of
grey and crumbling stone. Kane was smitten by a sense of incredible
age as he looked. The walls and houses were of great stone blocks,
yet they were falling into ruin. Grass grew on the plateau, and
high in the streets of that dead city. Kane saw no movement among
the ruins.</p>

<p>"That is their city&mdash;why do they choose to sleep in the
caves?"</p>

<p>"Maybe-so one fellow stone fall on them from roof and crush.
Them stone huts, he fall down bimeby. Maybe-so they no like to stay
together&mdash;maybe-so they eat each other, too."</p>

<p>"Silence!" whispered Kane; "how it hangs over all!"</p>

<p>"Them vampires no talk nor yell; they dead. They sleep in caves,
wander at sunset and at night. Maybe-so them fellow bush tribes
come with spears, them vampires go to stone kraal and fight behind
walls."</p>

<p>Kane nodded. The crumbling walls which surrounded that dead city
were still high and solid enough to resist the attack of
spearmen&mdash;especially when defended by these snout-nosed
fiends.</p>

<p>"Blood-brother," said N'Longa solemnly, "I have mighty magic
thought! Be silent a little while."</p>

<p>Kane seated himself on a boulder, and gazed broodingly at the
bare crags and slopes which surrounded them. Far away to the south
he saw the leafy green ocean that was the jungle. Distance lent a
certain enchantment to the scene. Closer at hand loomed the dark
blotches that were the mouths of the caves of horror.</p>

<p>N'Longa was squatting, tracing some strange pattern in the clay
with a dagger point. Kane watched him, thinking how easy they might
fall victim to the vampires if even three or four of the fiends
should come out of their caverns. And even as he thought it, a
black and horrific shadow fell across the crouching fetish-man.</p>

<p>Kane acted without conscious thought. He shot from the boulder
where he sat&mdash;like a stone hurled from a catapult, and his
musket stock shattered the face of the hideous thing who had stolen
upon them. Back and back Kane drove his inhuman foe staggering,
never giving him time to halt or launch an offensive, battering him
with the onslaught of a frenzied tiger.</p>

<p>At the very edge of the cliff the vampire wavered, then pitched
back over, to fall for a hundred feet and lie writhing on the rocks
of the plateau below. N'Longa was on his feet pointing; the hills
were giving up their dead.</p>

<p>Out of the caves they were swarming, the terrible black silent
shapes; up the slopes they came charging and over the boulders they
came clambering, and their red eyes were all turned toward the two
humans who stood above the silent city. The caves belched them
forth in an unholy judgment day.</p>

<p>N'Longa pointed to a crag some distance away and with a shout
started running fleetly toward it. Kane followed. From behind
boulders taloned hands clawed at them, tearing their garments. They
raced past caves, and mummied monsters came lurching out of the
dark, gibbering silently, to join in the pursuit.</p>

<p>The dead hands were close at their back when they scrambled up
the last slope and stood on a ledge which was the top of the crag.
The fiends halted silently a moment, then came clambering after
them. Kane clubbed his musket and smashed down into the red-eyed
faces, knocking aside the upleaping hands. They surged up like a
great wave; he swung his musket in a silent fury that matched
theirs. The wave broke and wavered back, then came on again.</p>

<p>He&mdash;could&mdash;not&mdash;kill&mdash;them! These words beat
on his brain like a sledge on an anvil as he shattered wood-like
flesh and dead bone with his smashing swings. He knocked them down,
hurled them back, but they rose and came on again. This could not
last&mdash;what in God's name was N'Longa doing? Kane spared one
swift, tortured glance over his shoulder. The fetish-man stood on
the highest part of the ledge, head thrown back, arms lifted as if
in invocation.</p>

<p>Kane's vision blurred to the sweep of hideous faces with red,
staring eyes. Those in front were horrible to see now, for their
skulls were shattered, their faces caved in and their limbs broken.
But still they came on and those behind reached across their
shoulders to clutch at the man who defied them.</p>

<p>Kane was red but the blood was all his. From the long-withered
veins of those monsters no single drop of warm red blood trickled.
Suddenly from behind him came a long piercing wall&mdash;from
N'Longa! Over the crash of the flying musket-stock and the
shattering of bones it sounded high and clear&mdash;the only voice
lifted in that hideous fight.</p>

<p>The wave of vampires washed about Kane's feet, dragging him
down. Keen talons tore at him, flaccid lips sucked at his wounds.
He reeled up again, dishevelled and bloody, clearing a space with a
shattering sweep of his splintered musket. Then they closed in
again and he went down.</p>

<p>"This is the end!" he thought, but even at that instant the
press slackened and the sky was suddenly filled with the beat of
great wings.</p>

<p>Then he was free and staggered up, blindly and dizzily, ready to
renew the strife. He halted, frozen. Down the slope the vampire
horde was fleeing and over their heads and close at their shoulders
flew huge vultures, tearing and rending avidly, sinking their beaks
in the dead flesh, devouring the creatures as they fled.</p>

<p>Kane laughed, almost insanely.</p>

<p>"Defy man and God, but you may not deceive the vultures, sons of
Satan! They know whether a man be alive or dead!"</p>

<p>N'Longa stood like a prophet on the pinnacle, and the great
black birds soared and wheeled about him. His arms still waved and
his voice still wailed out across the hills. And over the skylines
they came, hordes on endless hordes&mdash;vultures, vultures,
vultures! come to the feast so long denied them. They blackened the
sky with their numbers, blotted out the sun; a strange darkness
fell on the land. They settled in long dusky lines, diving into the
caverns with a whir of wings and a clash of beaks. Their talons
tore at the evil horrors which these caves disgorged.</p>

<p>Now all the vampires were fleeing to their city. The vengeance
held back for ages had come down on them and their last hope was
the heavy walls which had kept back the desperate human foes. Under
those crumbling roofs they might find shelter. And N'Longa watched
them stream into the city, and he laughed until the crags
re-echoed.</p>

<p>Now all were in and the birds settled like a cloud over the
doomed city, perching in solid rows along the walls, sharpening
their beaks and claws on the towers.</p>

<p>And N'Longa struck flint and steel to a bundle of dry leaves he
had brought with him. The bundle leaped into instant flame and he
straightened and flung the blazing thing far out over the cliffs.
It fell like a meteor to the plateau beneath, showering sparks. The
tall grass of the plateau leaped aflame.</p>

<p>From the silent city beneath them, fear flowed in unseen waves,
like a white fog. Kane smiled grimly.</p>

<p>"The grass is sere and brittle from the drought," he said;
"there has been even less rain than usual this season; it will burn
swiftly."</p>

<p>Like a crimson serpent the fire ran through high dead grass. It
spread and it spread and Kane, standing high above, yet felt the
fearful intensity of the hundreds of red eyes which watched from
the stone city.</p>

<p>Now the scarlet snake had reached the walls and was rearing as
if to coil and writhe over them. The vultures rose on heavily
flapping wings and soared reluctantly. A vagrant gust of wind
whipped the blaze about and drove it in a long red sheet around the
wall. Now the city was hemmed in on all sides by a solid barricade
of flame. The roar came up to the two men on the high crag.</p>

<p>Sparks flew across the wall, lighting in the high grass in the
streets. A score of flames leaped up and grew with terrifying
speed. A veil of red cloaked streets and buildings, and through
this crimson, whirling mist Kane and N'Longa saw hundreds of dark
shapes scamper and writhe, to vanish suddenly in red bursts of
flame. There rose an intolerable scent of decayed flesh
burning.</p>

<p>Kane gazed, awed. This was truly a hell on earth. As in a
nightmare he looked into the roaring red cauldron where dark
insects fought against their doom and perished. The flames leaped a
hundred feet into the air, and suddenly above their roar sounded
one bestial, inhuman scream like a shriek from across nameless
gulfs of cosmic space, as one vampire, dying, broke the chains of
silence which had held him for untold centuries. High and haunting
it rose, the death cry of a vanishing race.</p>

<p>Then the flames dropped suddenly. The conflagration had been a
typical grass fire, short and fierce. Now the plateau showed a
blackened expanse and the city a charred and smoking mass of
crumbling stone. Not one corpse lay in view, not even a charred
bone. Above all whirled the dark swarms of the vultures, but they,
too, were beginning to scatter.</p>

<p>Kane gazed hungrily at the clean blue sky. Like a strong sea
wind clearing a fog of horror was the sight to him. From somewhere
sounded the faint and far-off roaring of a distant lion. The
vultures were flapping away in black, straggling lines.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch5" name="ch5">5. &mdash; PALAVER SET!</a></h2>

<p class="first">KANE sat in the mouth of the cave where Zunna lay,
submitting to the fetish-man's bandaging.</p>

<p>The Puritan's garments hung in tatters about his frame; his
limbs and breast were deeply gashed and darkly bruised, but he had
had no mortal wound in that deathly fight on the cliff.</p>

<p>"Mighty men, we be!" declared N'Longa with deep approval.
"Vampire city be silent now, sure 'nough! No walking dead man live
along these hills."</p>

<p>"I do not understand," said Kane, resting chin on hand. "Tell
me, N'Longa, how have you done things? How talked you with me in my
dreams; how came you into the body of Kran; and how summoned you
the vultures?"</p>

<p>"My blood-brother," said N'Longa, discarding his pride in his
pidgin English, to drop into the river language understood by Kane,
"I am so old that you would call me a liar if I told you my age.
All my life I have worked magic, sitting first at the feet of
mighty ju-ju men of the south and the east; then I was a slave to
the Buckra and learned more. My brother, shall I span all these
years in a moment and make you understand with a word, what has
taken me so long to learn? I could not even make you understand how
these vampires have kept their bodies from decay by drinking the
lives of men.</p>

<p>"I sleep and my spirit goes out over the jungle and the rivers
to talk with the sleeping spirits of my friends. There is a mighty
magic on the voodoo staff I gave you&mdash;a magic out of the Old
Land which draws my ghost to it as a white man's magnet draws
metal."</p>

<p>Kane listened unspeaking, seeing for the first time in N'Longa's
glittering eyes something stronger and deeper than the avid gleam
of the worker in black magic. To Kane it seemed almost as if he
looked into the far-seeing and mystic eyes of a prophet of old.</p>

<p>"I spoke to you in dreams," N'Longa went on, "and I made a deep
sleep come over the souls of Kran and of Zunna, and removed them to
a far dim land, whence they shall soon return, unremembering. All
things bow to magic, blood-brother, and beasts and birds obey the
master words. I worked strong voodoo, vulture-magic, and flying
people of the air gathered at my call.</p>

<p>"These things I know and am a part of, but how shall I tell you
of them? Blood-brother, you are a mighty warrior, but in the ways
of magic you are as a little child lost. And what has taken me long
dark years to know, I may not divulge to you so you would
understand. My friend, you think only of bad spirits, but were my
magic always bad, should I not take this fine young body in place
of my old wrinkled one and keep it? But Kran shall have his body
back safely.</p>

<p>"Keep the voodoo staff, blood-brother. It has mighty power
against all sorcerers and serpents and evil things. Now I return to
the village on the Coast where my true body sleeps. And what of
you, my blood-brother?"</p>

<p>Kane pointed silently eastward.</p>

<p>"The call grows no weaker. I go."</p>

<p>N'Longa nodded, held out his hand. Kane grasped it. The mystical
expression had gone from the fetish-man's face and the eyes
twinkled snakily with a sort of reptilian mirth.</p>

<p>"Me go now, blood-brother," said the fetish-man, returning to
his beloved jargon, of which knowledge he was prouder than all his
conjuring tricks. "You take care&mdash;that one fellow jungle, she
pluck your bones yet! Remember that voodoo stave, brother. Ai ya,
palaver set!"</p>

<p>He fell back on the sand, and Kane saw the keen, sly expression
of N'Longa fading from the face of Kran. His flesh crawled again.
Somewhere back on the Slave Coast, the body of N'Longa, withered
and wrinkled, was stirring in the ju-ju hut, was rising as if from
a deep sleep. Kane shuddered.</p>

<p>Kran sat up, yawned, stretched and smiled. Beside him the girl
Zunna rose, rubbing her eyes.</p>

<p>"Master," said Kran apologetically, "we must have
slumbered."</p>
