  <h2><a id="pro"
     name="pro">PROLOGUE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The Redford rail smash was a bad business. On that cold
  November morning, glittering with sunshine and a thin layer of snow on the
  fields, the London- Manchester express hit a wagon that had strayed on to the
  main line from a siding. Engine and two first coaches were derailed;
  scattered cinders set fire to the wreckage; and fourteen persons in the first
  coach lost their lives. Some, unfortunately, were not killed outright. A
  curious thing was that even when all the names of persons who could possibly
  have been travelling on that particular train on that particular morning, had
  been collected and investigated, there were still two charred bodies
  completely unaccounted for, and both of women.</p>

  <p>Behind the second coach the force of the collision was not felt so
  disastrously; there were several casualties in the third, but in the fourth,
  which was a restaurant-car, occupants escaped with a shaking.</p>

  <p>As usual on such occasions there were heroic incidents. Conspicuous among
  these was the behaviour of one of the restaurant-car passengers, a
  middle-aged man, who jumped down to the track within a few seconds of the
  impact, and began work of rescue amidst the piled up and already burning
  debris. Five persons, it was afterwards computed, owed their lives to his
  gallantry, nor could he be persuaded to desist until his arms and hands were
  badly burned, and all hope of saving further lives had clearly to be
  abandoned. Passengers and railway officials alike were limitless in his
  praise&mdash;&ldquo;He was like a fury,&rdquo; one said, &ldquo;dashing into
  the flames again and again, just as if they weren&rsquo;t there&mdash;it
  seemed impossible that one man could do so much in so short a
  time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The following day was Sunday and Armistice Day, and the newspapers were
  naturally full of stories of the disaster and of its hero. He had collapsed,
  it was reported, after his efforts, but letters and papers in his possession
  revealed him to be the Reverend Howat Freemantle, a dissenting minister in
  Browdley, Lancashire. Interest in him was further stirred by the disclosure,
  made by his wife, who was telegraphed for and arrived later in the day, that
  he had been travelling alone. This seemed to set his heroism on a higher
  pinnacle than ever; Mr. James Douglas made it the theme of a long and moving
  article; and a chorus of adulation rose from all parts of the country. For,
  as one &lsquo;leader&rsquo; put it: &ldquo;Many doubtless would have done as
  much for their loved ones, but this man&rsquo;s devotion and self-sacrifice
  were for complete strangers, and in this he showed himself magnificently
  worthy of his profession. In these days, when so much is heard of the failure
  of organised religion to attract the masses, the selfless bravery of this
  Nonconformist clergyman strikes a note that will echo far beyond the thunder
  of rival sectaries.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Reverend Howat Freemantle spent a week in hospital, and for a few days
  there were fears that he might have to lose one of his hands. Meanwhile the
  gaze of the whole country was on him, for the Press, with that capriciously
  epidemic enthusiasm that partly leads and partly follows the mood of its
  registered readers, decided unanimously that he was the &lsquo;big
  news&rsquo; of the moment. Photographs of him, looking tired and rather sad
  in his hospital bed, appeared on front pages; his face was impressive and
  thoughtful, and it was even commented by some that he had &lsquo;the eyes of
  a saint&rsquo;. Of the disaster and of his own exploits he would say not a
  word&mdash;a pathetically understandable attitude in a man in whom modesty
  and horror were doubtless equally profound. When at last the announcement was
  made that his hand might, after all, be saved, and that he would soon be fit
  to undertake the journey to Browdley, the sentimental heart of the
  newspaper-reading public gave a great upward leap.</p>

  <p>That journey home was rather like the return of a wounded victor after a
  successful military campaign. Hundreds cheered him as he walked from the
  ambulance to the train at Redford; and by courtesy of the railway company his
  coach was sent on a through line to Browdley Station, where he was welcomed
  by the Mayor and Corporation, the Salvation Army Silver Prize Band, and a
  crowd estimated at nearly five thousand. It had not been realised, however,
  that he was so ill; and as he was helped down the station slope by his wife
  and sister- in-law, the Mayor hurriedly cancelled a prepared speech and
  substituted a few short sentences of praise and welcome. Even the cheers of
  the crowd were hushed by the man&rsquo;s tragic appearance, and his words,
  &ldquo;Thank you all&mdash;very much,&rdquo; were clearly heard amidst an
  awestricken silence. But the cheers swelled out again as the ambulance passed
  through the narrow streets to the Manse.</p>

  <p>The massed limelights of the Press then focused themselves upon that
  middle-sized manufacturing town, of which few persons in other parts of the
  country had ever even heard; and it was soon discovered that in the Reverend
  Howat Freemantle Browdley had possessed no ordinary minister. Everywhere
  citizens and chapel-goers testified to his generosity, his kindliness, and
  his devotion to good works, while it was recalled that during the War he had
  served in Gallipoli as an ordinary soldier and been wounded twice. Nor in
  Browdley had he confined himself to strictly professional work; his sermons
  had been eloquent, but he had also identified himself with local literary and
  artistic societies, the League of Nations Union, and other movements.
  Newspaper interviewers, unable to approach the man himself (he was confined
  to his room and could see nobody), found his wife and sister-in-law most
  gratifyingly ready to answer questions; among other matters it was revealed
  that his stipend was a very poor one, and that, like so many other clergymen
  in industrial districts, he had for some time been hard put to it to make
  ends meet. In particular, he could barely afford even the most urgent repairs
  to the large, red-bricked residence with which an earlier and more prosperous
  generation had burdened him. Such facts, together with an insurgent wave of
  popular emotion, prompted a leading daily newspaper to open a fund for the
  provision of &lsquo;some tangible expression of nation-wide esteem&rsquo;.
  Headed by a contribution of fifty guineas from the proprietor, Sir William
  Folgate, it speedily reached a sum of nearly eleven hundred pounds, a cheque
  for which was eventually handed to Freemantle at a special meeting convened
  in Browdley Town Hall. He was still suffering then from the effects of a
  complete nervous and mental breakdown, and could not make more than a very
  short speech of thanks. The money, he said, would be devoted entirely to
  local charities.</p>

  <p>But this was by no means the only tribute paid to his heroism. A certain
  Miss Monks, aged eighty-nine, who belonged to Freemantle&rsquo;s chapel, was
  so deeply overcome by reading newspaper accounts of how the minister had
  behaved that she died of heart failure; whilst another old lady, who lived at
  Cheltenham, and had never even seen Freemantle, offered to pay for the
  education of his children. He had none, as it happened, of school age, so
  that the lady&rsquo;s beneficence was frustrated; but he was able to accept
  Sir William Folgate&rsquo;s three months&rsquo; loan of a luxurious villa
  overlooking the sea at Bournemouth. It should perhaps be added that he
  received many anonymous gifts, among them being an Austin Seven car, which
  had to be sold, since neither he nor any of his family could drive.</p>

  <p>One of the many disclosures made by Mrs. Freemantle to an interviewer had
  been that her husband&rsquo;s hobby was the composition of music. The
  enterprising journalist had wished to know more of this, so she had hunted up
  as many of her husband&rsquo;s compositions as she could find and handed them
  over. Among them was one, dated 1909, which for some reason attracted more
  attention than the rest, and within a few days Mrs. Freemantle received an
  offer from a firm of publishers. But she was unwise enough to hold out for
  too high terms and negotiations finally broke down, with the unfortunate
  result that none of Freemantle&rsquo;s music has yet been made accessible to
  the general public.</p>

  <p>By the time the minister and his wife returned to Browdley the following
  April the whole affair had been almost completely forgotten, and even at
  Browdley station there was no one to meet them except Mrs. Freemantle&rsquo;s
  sister. But the Manse, when they reached it, was not quite the same as
  before; it had been painted inside and out, and there was new linoleum on the
  floors, and in the minister&rsquo;s study a small bust of Beethoven, which
  had been accidentally smashed during the renovations, had been replaced by a
  large silver-framed photograph of Gipsy Smith, subscribed for by the Young
  Men&rsquo;s Bible Class.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap1"
     name="chap1">CHAPTER ONE &mdash; MONDAY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The Reverend Howat Freemantle awoke about the usual time on
  Monday morning of that second week in November. From habit, as soon as he was
  completely conscious, he lit the bedside candle, glanced at his watch ticking
  loudly on the table, and then at his wife, whose huddled back and deep
  regular breathing presented a familiar picture close by. Seven-thirty. He
  reached out an arm to light the gas-ring under the kettle&mdash;a manoeuvre
  dexterously performed as a result of long practice. Then he leaned back to
  doze for those last and frequently most delightful minutes.</p>

  <p>But this morning they were not particularly delightful. Parsons, he had
  often reflected, were not immune from the &lsquo;Monday morning&rsquo;
  feeling&mdash;on the contrary, they were subject to a peculiarly distressing
  Monday morning feeling of their own. After Sunday, with its sermons and
  services, Monday came, not as the beginning of a six days&rsquo; holiday, as
  so many lay persons imagined, but as a sudden drop to the bottom of a hill
  which had to be slowly and laboriously climbed over again.</p>

  <p>And it had been a difficult Sunday, he recollected, dark and foggy all
  day, with congregations and collections very small&mdash;serious matters to a
  Nonconformist minister in a northern manufacturing town already impoverished
  by the trade slump and unemployment. The chapel, too, had been bitterly cold,
  owing to an ancient and defective heating apparatus (soon, however, to be
  replaced), and the fog and chill had got at his throat and given him acute
  pain during the evening service&mdash;&rsquo;<i>that</i> pain&rsquo;, he had
  already begun to call it in his mind. Curious how people could stare at him
  up there in the pulpit, and not know that the chief thought in his mind all
  the time was&mdash;&rsquo;I&rsquo;ve got the most frightful sharpness in my
  throat&mdash;wonder if anything serious starts like this?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>When the kettle began to boil he warmed the teapot, put in the tea, and
  poured. Then, reaching out further, he gave his wife&rsquo;s shoulder the
  gentle shove which was nearly always sufficient to wake her. She stirred,
  opened her eyes sleepily, and gave an incoherent murmur. &ldquo;Good
  morning,&rdquo; he said, with a smile at her huddled shoulders. He did not
  look at her face. He felt, though he scarcely admitted it even to himself, a
  reluctance to observe her during those first few inelegant moments after
  waking&mdash;with her hair crimped up in clusters of curlers, her skin greasy
  with perspiration, and her lips dry and parched through breathing through her
  mouth. She could not, of course, help all that; the fault, he knew, lay with
  himself&mdash;in a certain initial fastidiousness which, he feared, was
  hardly less a sin for being involuntary.</p>

  <p>She did not reply to his &lsquo;good morning&rsquo; except by further
  murmurs, and after a little pause he poured out a cup of tea and placed it on
  the table next to a novel by W. J. Locke which she was in the course of
  reading. Then, after putting on an old brown dressing-gown, he poured two
  other cups and carried them out of the room, across the landing, and into
  another room where his daughter Mary slept. She was a thin-faced,
  sallow-complexioned girl of twenty, working as a teacher in the school that
  adjoined the chapel. He lit the gas and wakened her now, according to
  established routine; he liked that early morning habit of tea and a chat. He
  began desultorily to mention politics (there was a by-election pending in the
  neighbourhood), though he had not uttered many words before he felt again
  that sharp, cramping sensation in his throat. Mary, however, was not
  interested in politics, and plunged into chapel and school matters with a
  briskness that made him, as for relief, pull aside the curtains and see the
  pale grey dawn outlining the roofs and factories of Browdley; there was no
  fog, but a soft slanting rain. Then she asked if he would &rsquo;hear some
  Latin verbs she had been learning by heart; she was cramming for a degree
  examination, and had to make use of every odd moment. He agreed, and for the
  next five minutes stood solemnly and shiveringly by the window with the
  text-book in his hand (she had slept with it under her pillow), while she
  went through the various moods and tenses of the third conjugation.
  &ldquo;Rego, Regis, Regit...&rdquo; How chilly it was, he reflected, and
  there would be no hot water in the bathroom (the kitchen fire was always
  allowed to go out on Sunday afternoons), and the smell of bacon was drifting
  up the stairs just as it had done for goodness knew how many years&mdash;did
  there await him, he wondered, some glorious morning in the dim future, an
  alternative breakfast smell that would amaze and delight his nostrils? Not
  that he disliked bacon, or would have preferred any other dish for breakfast;
  it was in atmosphere rather than actuality that something in him craved for a
  change..."Regimus, Regitis, Regunt."...He must call and see Mrs. Roseway some
  time today, and perhaps young Trevis as well&mdash;oh yes, and Councillor
  Higgs about the Armistice Day service. &ldquo;Well, there you are !&rdquo; he
  exclaimed brightly, when she had finished. &ldquo;You seem to know them all
  right. Now we&rsquo;d better hurry up and dress, or else Aunt Viney will have
  something to say to us when we get down.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Half an hour later breakfast at the Manse began&mdash;Quaker oats, bacon
  and eggs, toast and marmalade&mdash;the whole rather carelessly prepared by
  the maid-of-all-work, Ellen, whose intelligence was so far below normal that
  Aunt Viney, in her more blustery moments, usually referred to her as
  &lsquo;that half-wit&rsquo;. But then, you could never get satisfactory
  servants in Browdley, and Aunt Viney, with or without the slightest
  encouragement, would tell you why. It was because of the dole, which enabled
  out-of-work factory hands to live in luxury (silk stockings and lip-stick,
  Aunt Viney said) while honest people searched vainly for &lsquo;good girls to
  train&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>Aunt Viney (short for &rsquo;Lavinia&rsquo;), viewed in the grey daylight
  that came in through the dining-room window, was always a rather imposing
  spectacle. She was fifty-one years of age, and had large staring eyes, quick
  bustling movements, more than a tendency to stoutness, a menacing optimism
  that was not quite matched by a sense of humour, and the most decided
  opinions upon everything. She was an excellent &lsquo;manager&rsquo;, and for
  more than a decade had lived at the Manse with her sister and brother-in-law
  and their children (there had been boys at one time), looking after them all
  with undoubted if rather relentless competence. Mrs. Freemantle, it was
  generally known, was &lsquo;not strong&rsquo;, but happily there was no such
  fragility about Aunt Viney. Vigorous in body and mentally impervious, she
  knew exactly how to control the children at a Sunday School treat, she could
  organise round games at a Missionary bazaar, prepare tea for seventy at the
  Women&rsquo;s Annual Social, win the egg-and-spoon race at the summer outing,
  turn away the crowd of mendicants who knocked at the door of the
  Manse&mdash;and all with that same air of confident downrightness. She
  entertained a just slightly contemptuous admiration for Howat. In truth she
  had never really managed to like Browdley (she was Kentish by birth), and
  when, on holiday at Southport or Llandudno, she saw sleek, well-dressed
  parsons playing golf or motoring in smart-looking cars, she often wished that
  her brother-in-law, with all the brains he was supposed to have, had belonged
  to one or other of the wealthier denominations.</p>

  <p>This morning, as on so many other Monday mornings, she faced the oncoming
  week with a nonchalant glint of her prominent blue eyes. Breakfast was her
  particular scene of triumph, since Mrs. Freemantle took hers in bed, rarely
  appearing downstairs till the morning was well aired. Aunt Viney poured out
  tea with a steady hand, rebuked her niece for grumbling at the bacon (it was
  abominably cooked, she perceived, and privately made up her mind to have a
  real good row with that girl Ellen afterwards), and watched the progress of
  her brother-in-law&rsquo;s breakfast with managerial solicitude. He seemed to
  her exactly as she had always known him at breakfast times&mdash;quiet, good-
  tempered, perhaps a little dreamy. Over the Quaker oats he opened his private
  letters, slitting the envelopes with the knife he would later use for the
  bacon. Over the bacon and eggs he talked a little, and after that, during the
  hurried moments before his daughter left for school, he glanced through the
  <i>Daily News</i> and mentioned a few odd things that were happening in the
  vast world outside Browdley. All this was perfectly according to custom.</p>

  <p>From nine till eleven every morning, except Sunday, the Reverend Howat
  Freemantle was to be found in his &lsquo;study&rsquo;. During those two hours
  he answered letters, planned addresses and sermons, interviewed callers, and
  (if he had any spare time left over, which did not often happen) read books
  and the more serious type of periodicals. The study was a moderate-sized and
  rather gloomy room on the ground floor, overlooking a tiny soot-blackened
  front garden. A dozen years ago it had been furnished by Mrs. Freemantle, who
  had modelled it upon that of her father, himself a dissenting preacher; and
  Howat, who had no especial preferences in furnishing, had been content to
  leave it undisturbed from that primal exactitude. There were books, of
  course&mdash;shelves of them&mdash;his own training college textbooks, and
  stacks of theological works inherited from his father-in-law. There was a
  pedestal writing-desk, a swivel desk-chair, and a pair of ragged leather
  armchairs. Two black and white lithographs, one of &ldquo;Dawn&rdquo; and the
  other of &ldquo;Sunset,&rdquo; embellished alcoves on either side of the
  fireplace; a many-volumed series of the Expositor&rsquo;s Bible (a gift from
  his first chapel) occupied a frontal position above the mantelpiece; and a
  bust of Beethoven (many visitors thought it was Luther) stood on the top of a
  bookcase containing the latest edition of the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>,
  on which Howat was still paying monthly instalments. Apart from the Beethoven
  bust the room was impeccably what Mrs. Freemantle had originally planned it
  to be&mdash;the sanctum of a dissenting minister of the more
  &lsquo;thoughtful&rsquo; type. Its composition as such was far too massive to
  be overlaid by any freakishness of personality, and all that Howat&rsquo;s
  occupation ever inflicted on it was a merely surface litter that Aunt Viney
  easily and regularly cleared away.</p>

  <p>Passing along Browdley High Street, and then up School Lane beyond the
  tram junction, the pedestrian reaches the Manse, after a short and rather
  depressing walk through a district given over to factories and slum property.
  There is a privet hedge along the street frontage, but it is low enough for a
  vague interior view of the study to be available to anyone who deliberately
  stares, and the Reverend Howat Freemantle must often have been seen at work
  there during the last dozen years, especially in winter when it is so dark as
  a rule that the lamps have to be lit.</p>

  <p>On that Monday morning in November Howat lit the single gas-burner over
  his desk and gave his morning&rsquo;s mail a second perusal. Besides a bunch
  of obvious-looking circulars there were three private letters, the first from
  a firm of engineers in Queen Victoria Street, London, confirming an
  arrangement by which he should call at their head office on the coming Friday
  to consult about a new heating apparatus. For his chapel members, after
  freezing and catching influenza for several successive winters, had at last
  decided to spend money on such an unspiritual but none the less necessary
  object; sixty pounds had already been subscribed, and there would be a bazaar
  or something to raise whatever extra might be required. To Howat had fallen
  the job of going to London to make final arrangements; of course he knew
  nothing at all about central heating, but his congregation had the usual
  optimistic belief that a parson must know something about everything.</p>

  <p>The second letter was from a well-known missioner, offering to conduct a
  week&rsquo;s revival in Browdley for twenty pounds <i>plus</i> his hotel and
  travelling expenses.</p>

  <p>The third letter was from another London address&mdash;Wimpole Street. It
  fixed an appointment for the Reverend Howat Freemantle to see Doctor
  Blenkiron at 4. p.m. that same Friday. Howat turned it over rather awesomely
  in his hand; he had somehow nourished a slender hope that his little plan to
  fit in a visit to a London specialist might not have succeeded. However,
  there it was; Blenkiron could see him, even at such short notice, and no one
  at home, for the present at least, need be told anything about it. It was not
  only that he was anxious not to worry them&mdash;he was equally anxious that
  they should not worry him. He knew from frequent observation how
  magisterially Aunt Viney took command of other people&rsquo;s illnesses; she
  was always so noisily optimistic about them, and at the same time so full of
  parallel anecdotes of persons who had either died lingering deaths, or had
  cured themselves by Christian Science or herbs, or some other specific in
  which Howat had no particular faith. She had, too, a robust common sense
  which would certainly have made her point out the absurdity of his paying
  hard-earned guineas to a London specialist before Ringwood&rsquo;s verdict,
  which could be obtained for as many shillings, had been even asked for. Nor
  could Howat say precisely why he was unwilling to consult Ringwood
  first&mdash;except that Ringwood was a personal friend as well as a family
  doctor, and he shrank, somehow, from the human touch in such a business.</p>

  <p>Ah, he told himself a shade irritably, throwing the letter into the fire,
  he was getting nervy&mdash;mustn&rsquo;t think any more about it&mdash;wait
  till Friday, anyhow. Plenty of jobs to be done meanwhile. There was the
  address on Mozart he was due to deliver at the Young People&rsquo;s Guild
  that night. Fortunately he knew a good deal about Mozart&mdash;no need to
  prepare anything especially. He might carry over his portable gramophone and
  a few records...He took the remainder of his correspondence to the fireside
  and pencilled a few memoranda on the back of a circular. Mozart...There was a
  Trio in E Major he might play over and also, of course, the overtures to
  &ldquo;Figaro&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Magic Flute &ldquo;. His eyes brightened
  a little at the prospect, and he stared across the room to observe, without
  irony, the view through the window of dilapidated slum cottages overtopped by
  a five-storeyed cotton-mill. Then, in a mood almost of abstraction, he began
  to open the circulars hitherto neglected. One was from a tailoring firm in
  London, advertising a sale of lounge suits at five guineas&mdash;to be had in
  either black or &lsquo;clerical grey&rsquo;. Well, perhaps on Friday, if he
  could find time, he would call and see about it&mdash;he certainly needed a
  suit badly enough...Another circular was from a firm of outside stockbrokers
  in Leicester, recommending shares in a brewery. A third was from an
  ecclesiastical supply stores in Paternoster Row, offering a job line of
  individual communion cups. A fourth came from Boston, Mass., and accosted him
  with a list of pertinent questions&mdash;&ldquo;Are your sermons full of pep?
  Are you sure you are delivering the goods? Are you satisfied with your
  freewill offerings? Do you feel tired Sunday nights? Are you inclined to be
  low-spirited, diffident, disheartened?&rdquo; And for a twenty-dollar course
  of ten lessons it could all, apparently, be put right.</p>

  <p>Howat read through the enclosed and illustrated brochure, but did not tear
  it up afterwards as he had done the other advertising matter. Instead he put
  it away in the middle drawer of his desk; it would do for Ringwood to see
  some time&mdash;he would be amused.</p>

  <p>Still with the trace of a smile he tore open one of the remaining
  envelopes. A coloured picture dropped out and fell at his feet, making a
  little patch of brightness on the drab carpet. He picked it up, guessing it
  to be a sample sent him by some firm of art publishers&mdash;Raphael&rsquo;s
  &ldquo;Saint Catherine of Alexandria&rdquo;, he recognised, for he had often
  admired the original in the National Gallery. The reproduction pleased him,
  and he was still examining it when he perceived a handwritten note in the
  envelope. It was just the shortest of messages&mdash;&ldquo;Dear Mr.
  Freemantle, I am afraid I shall not be able to come for a lesson on Tuesday,
  as I shall be out of Browdley that day. I saw the enclosed in a shop recently
  and thought you might like it. Yours sincerely, Elizabeth Garland.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His first thought was that he would have an extra free hour on the
  following day. Every Tuesday for some months past he had been giving lessons
  in German to Miss Garland, the daughter of his chapel secretary. It was a
  means of adding to his rather poor income, besides which it meant rubbing up
  his own knowledge of German, which was good for him. She was a pleasant and
  intelligent girl, and had seemed to pick up the language quite
  satisfactorily; still, he could not but feel grateful for one engagement less
  during a more than usually crowded week.</p>

  <p>He studied the picture again and reflected that it was kindly of the child
  to have sent it him&mdash;yes, very kindly. There was something boyish and
  simple in him that showed instantly when anyone gave him anything, or even
  thanked him; he was always pleased in a rather bewildered kind of
  way&mdash;bewildered because he quite genuinely could not think what he had
  done to deserve it.</p>

  <p>He put the picture on the mantelpiece, and several times looked towards it
  with pleasure during the clerical tasks that kept him employed during the
  next hour or so. Finally Aunt Viney came in, saw it, and smiled steadfastly
  while he explained the circumstances of its arrival. &ldquo;Very kind of her
  indeed, Howat,&rdquo; was her verdict at length, &ldquo;but are you quite
  sure it is very suitable? After all, it looks rather a Catholic picture,
  don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was, he admitted, and put it away in a drawer. As a
  Nonconformist clergyman he could not be too careful.</p>

  <p>Punctually at eleven he put on his overcoat and hat (an ordinary dark grey
  and somewhat shabby felt) and went out into School Lane. There, in the murky
  daylight that was only a degree brighter than the gloom of the study, it was
  possible for one to observe him in some detail. Tall and slim-built, with
  just the very slightest stoop of the shoulders that suggested thoughtfulness,
  he was, beyond doubt, fine-looking, and would have been conspicuous among his
  fellows even had his collar not buttoned at the back. His hair was touched
  with silver over the temples, but otherwise he looked younger than his age,
  which was forty-three. His eyes were grey, deep-set, and very bright; he had
  a strong, rugged profile, and an expression which, in its stern setting, was
  rather astonishingly winsome. Dr. Ringwood often told him he had missed his
  vocation in being a parson&mdash;he should have been an actor. &ldquo;With
  that face you could have been the answer to the maiden&rsquo;s prayer,&rdquo;
  he used to say, and Howat was always, beyond his amusement, a little puzzled,
  and beyond his puzzlement, a little grieved. There seemed such a lot of
  irrelevance in the world. He was dimly aware that he might be considered not
  bad-looking, but, so far as the matter affected him at all, he found it
  rather tiresome. Some of the girls at the chapel, for instance, whenever
  there was a bazaar or a social&mdash;so silly and pointless, all that sort of
  thing. Anyhow, he had never tried to trade on his looks, and most certainly
  never attempted any gallant airs.</p>

  <p>Proceeding along School Lane he entered the High Street. It had stopped
  raining, but the roadway and pavements were covered with a film of brown mud
  which glittered in the light of some of the shops. The sky was already
  yellowing into a kind of twilight; probably there would be fog again later
  on. People passed dimly by with a nod or a greeting&mdash;women doing their
  marketing, unemployed men lounging around, business folk bustling about the
  town, and so on. He had to keep his eyes well open&mdash;people were so
  offended if he didn&rsquo;t see them, they were always prone to think he had
  cut them deliberately. Whom should he visit first? Higgs would be at his
  place in the High Street; Mrs. Roseway lived over at Hill Grove; there was
  young Trevis in Mansion Street, close by. Better leave Mrs. Roseway till
  afternoon&mdash;she wouldn&rsquo;t like him to call before everything in the
  house had been put to rights&rsquo;, though, Heaven knew, he wasn&rsquo;t the
  man to notice whether things of that sort were right or not. Young Trevis
  then, it might as well be; and he was walking briskly along with this
  intention when a little girl suddenly ran up to him. &ldquo;Please, Mr.
  Freemantle, Aunty says will you come and see her at once, as she&rsquo;s been
  took very had in the night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He stared down with a kind of surprised vagueness and then identified the
  child as Nancy Kerfoot, one of his Sunday School youngsters. Her aunt, he
  knew, was Miss Letitia Monks, and lived in the end house in Lower George
  Street. &ldquo;Very well, my dear,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Run along and
  tell your Aunty I&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It wouldn&rsquo;t do to ignore a summons of that sort, despite the fact
  that he had been abruptly sent for by Miss Monks on several previous
  occasions. She was a character, the old lady, and he had always rather liked
  her, despite the fact that her piercing voice, her equally piercing eyes, her
  stern old- fashioned principles, and her quite spotless four-roomed cottage
  in which she lived on a very few shillings a week, made him feel
  uncomfortably like a large fly in the presence of a small but exceptionally
  strong-willed spider. There was something indubitably wonderful about her, he
  felt; she was eighty-nine, and had never been further away from Browdley than
  Blackpool. Moreover, she had worked in the same cotton-mill for half a
  century, had invested all her savings in that same cotton-mill, and during
  the last few years had lost the greater part of them.</p>

  <p>He hastened towards Lower George Street, and outside the end house saw
  Ringwood&rsquo;s battered Morris-Cowley. As he approached, Ringwood himself
  came out of the doorway&mdash;an elderly, apple-cheeked, rather shrewd-
  looking general practitioner.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hullo, Freemantle. You been sent for too?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go along then. Mustn&rsquo;t keep you. It&rsquo;s no false alarm
  this time, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You think not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bet you a shilling not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ringwood was always outrageously flippant about death. The other clergy in
  the town did not care for that, or for him either, but Freemantle found it an
  oddly bearable trait. He half-smiled, nodded, and passed through the open
  door into the front parlour which had never, he supposed, been used except
  for funerals, weddings, Christmas and other exceptional occasions. The fender
  was crowded with huge brass fire-irons that gleamed through the shadows as he
  passed to the narrow steep staircase beyond. A woman, doubtless a neighbour,
  called to him to come up. He obeyed, feeling his way in almost complete
  darkness, and was at last manoeuvred into a very small, hot, and dimly-lit
  bedroom.</p>

  <p>Miss Monks was the oldest member of his chapel; she had belonged to it
  ever since its opening in 1860. She had regularly attended services twice
  every Sunday until quite recently; she had given generously to all chapel
  funds and charities; nor, during her prime, had she ever shirked personal
  duties. But that was only one side of the picture. For over four
  decades&mdash;ever since most people could remember&mdash;she had constituted
  herself a sort of super-authority to which all chapel questions must in the
  last resort be submitted. She had waged bitter and incessant warfare against
  anything and everything new, different, or experimental, and it was hardly an
  exaggeration to say that she had driven several parsons out of the town, and
  at least one into a home for the victims of mental breakdown. Of Freemantle
  himself she had misgivings, but they were weaker ones; and this was partly
  because she was getting old, partly because he was tactful, and partly
  (though neither she nor he realised or would have admitted it) because she
  was attracted by his face.</p>

  <p>His eyes, accustoming themselves to the dimness, observed the shrivelled
  cheeks and piercing eyes that confronted him from the head of the bed.
  &ldquo;Good morning, Miss Monks,&rdquo; he began, stooping slightly. His
  greeting, rather huskily spoken, filled the room with its deep resonant
  tones&mdash;he had a magnificent voice (Ringwood had once
  said&mdash;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so damned easy to listen to you talk that one
  sometimes doesn&rsquo;t bother what it is you&rsquo;re
  saying&rdquo;&mdash;and he had never felt quite the same about his own words
  after that). The neighbour passed him a chair and whispered loudly in his
  ear: &ldquo;Doctor says she won&rsquo;t last out the day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he answered vaguely, seating himself at the bedside and
  gazing at the subject of this despairing prophecy. He was, he was aware, a
  little terrified by Miss Monks. He was just wondering whether she were fully
  or only partly conscious when she startled him by croaking suddenly:
  &ldquo;Very poor attendances there must have been at chapel yesterday, Mr.
  Freemantle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he admitted, fidgetting under her glance. &ldquo;The
  weather, you know, was most unfortunate. I suppose one really can&rsquo;t
  expect people to turn out in thick fog.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In my young days people wouldn&rsquo;t have let that keep them at
  home on a Sunday.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was her favourite theme, and he gave her the cue she wanted. &ldquo;Ah,
  Miss Monks, I&rsquo;m afraid this is a slacker generation
  altogether.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She talked for a few minutes as she enjoyed talking, and as he knew she
  enjoyed talking. The conversation touched upon the question of Sunday games
  in the parks (soon to come before the Borough Council again), and the
  forthcoming service on Armistice Day. She was, of course, a bitter opponent
  of Sunday games, and as for the Armistice Day affair, she had doubts as to
  the wisdom of those so-called &lsquo;undenominational&rsquo; ceremonies, at
  which parsons of all creeds appeared together on a single platform.
  &ldquo;Safer to keep ourselves to ourselves,&rdquo; she declared, with a
  tightening of wrinkled lips.</p>

  <p>After a time talking seemed to tire her, and Howat was just beginning to
  think he might decently take his leave when she whispered, with a kind of
  sinister pride: &ldquo;Doctor says I won&rsquo;t last out the day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, dear me, what nonsense!&rdquo; The exclamation came out
  trippingly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Dr. Ringwood never said anything of the
  sort, and even if he did&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He <i>did</i>,&rdquo; she insisted, in such a way that further
  conventional protests found themselves checked at source. She added hoarsely:
  &ldquo;Perhaps we could have a prayer together, Mr. Freemantle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, certainly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he bent his head into his hands (Miss Monks would have thought any
  more abject posture idolatrous) and began to pray. He felt a little unnerved
  by it all. It was so difficult to think of anything really suitable. What
  <i>could</i> you say to the Almighty by way of introducing an old lady of
  eighty-nine who was perfectly certain of going to Heaven and equally certain
  that Heaven was full of marble and white tiles, like a combination of
  underground convenience and fish-shop? And all the time he was speaking he
  knew too that Miss Monks was listening with the air of a connoisseur; she
  felt herself in no pressing need of his interpolations on her
  behalf&mdash;she was merely trying him, seeing what he could do, enjoying a
  luxury to which she considered herself entitled.</p>

  <p>That, he felt, was the worst of being a Nonconformist parson&mdash;in the
  last resort people didn&rsquo;t need you, they felt themselves able to get
  just as near Heaven on their own. Not that they probably couldn&rsquo;t, but
  still, if they thought that, why bother to keep a parson at all? As some
  species of communal pet, perhaps. It was different in the Roman Church, where
  people really believed in priestly functions. And again, as often before, he
  wished there were some ritual for such occasions as this...What could he say,
  anyhow?...Yet, to his considerable surprise, he heard himself saying all
  kinds of things, quite eloquently and not at all insincerely; he really meant
  every word of them&mdash;the poor old creature was dying&mdash;there had been
  something rather grand and magnificent about her&mdash;he was stirred,
  touched, and aware that his voice was vibrating with emotion. And when at
  last he raised his head there were actually tears in his eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Freemantle,&rdquo; said Miss Monks rather in the
  tone of an examiner to a student who has done passably well in a <i>viva
  voce</i>.</p>

  <p>He bade her a kindly farewell, and held her thin hand for a moment. The
  stuffy air inside the room (all the windows closed for the past dozen years,
  he guessed) and the smells of drugs and bedclothes made him feel a little
  faint. His throat too, was giving him pain again. After a few conventional
  courtesies to the woman who had shown him up, he descended the stairs and
  passed out gladly into the street.</p>

  <p>Too late now to call on young Trevis; he had to sec Higgs the councillor,
  and there wouldn&rsquo;t be time for both visits. He hastened out of Lower
  George Street and into the High Street again. Higgs was an optician, who had
  an office and consulting-room on the first floor of Bank Buildings, just
  above Phillips&rsquo;s gramophone shop. He was a clever fellow, not yet
  thirty, the youngest and in many ways the ablest of the local Labour Party.
  Self-educated, he had worked as a mill-hand while studying for the
  examinations that entitled him to set up in business. He never attended a
  place of worship, but had once surprisingly turned up at a series of lectures
  Howat had given on music. The relationship between the two men was cordial up
  to a point, and then sharply antagonistic.</p>

  <p>Howat felt still somewhat exhausted as he walked along the passage by the
  side of the gramophone shop, and climbed the stairs to the first floor. He
  rang the bell and Higgs himself answered it. &ldquo;Oh, Hullo,
  Freemantle&mdash;glad to see you&mdash;do come inside.&rdquo; Howat did not
  in the least mind being called Freemantle&rsquo; without the &rsquo;Mister
  &rsquo;&mdash;indeed he rather preferred it&mdash;but he could not help
  reflecting that at Higgs&rsquo;s age he should never have had the nerve to
  leave out the prefix with a man nearly twice as old...Nerve, that was
  it&mdash;and Higgs had plenty of it. Cool-headed fellow climbing steadily up
  the ladder which began with a seat on a local council and ended, quite
  possibly, at Westminster. He was determined to get on in the world, and Howat
  liked him for it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good morning, Higgs. I hope I&rsquo;m not interrupting&mdash;I
  thought I&rsquo;d better call where I&rsquo;d be sure of finding
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quite right. Do take a chair. I&rsquo;ve an appointment in ten
  minutes, but I daresay he&rsquo;ll be late.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t suppose my business will take more than the ten
  minutes in any case. I only wanted to know the plans for the Armistice Day
  service.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, yes. There&rsquo;s been the usual fuss about it, you know. Or
  perhaps you don&rsquo;t know. Doxley of the Congregationals thought it was
  unfair for the Baptist fellow to be given the opening prayer two years in
  succession. So we&rsquo;ve given him the opening prayer instead. The Vicar of
  the Parish Church, of course, does the address&mdash;that seems to be
  generally agreed upon. Then there&rsquo;s the second prayer&mdash;Salcombe
  rather wants that. Unfortunately that means you&rsquo;ll have to take the
  hymns, as you did last year and the year before. I don&rsquo;t know how you
  feel about it&mdash;if you object, then Salcombe will have to take his turn
  with the hymns, whether he likes it or not, only he&rsquo;s not so good at
  the job&mdash;fusses with the tuning-fork for about five minutes before he
  can get the note&mdash;I daresay you&rsquo;ve seen him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat smiled. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind what I do&mdash;I&rsquo;ll fit
  myself in just wherever&rsquo;s convenient. As it happens, I have absolute
  pitch, so I don&rsquo;t need a tuning-fork.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Absolute pitch? What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>One thing in Higgs that always especially attracted Howat was his
  eagerness to assimilate any casual scrap of knowledge that might come his
  way. He answered: &ldquo;It means that if I want a certain note&mdash;middle
  C, for instance&mdash;I know it, instantly, without having to think. Nothing
  very unusual a good many people can do it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see. A sort of gift? Must be very useful. You&rsquo;re fond of
  music, aren&rsquo;t you, Freemantle?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, extremely.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m beginning to be, too. When I&rsquo;ve time to
  spare I sometimes go down to the shop below and play over records. I like
  Bach.&rdquo; He pronounced it &lsquo;Back&rsquo; and added: &ldquo;By the
  way, how should one say that fellow&rsquo;s name&mdash;was I
  right?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat replied: &ldquo;Well, I think &lsquo;Bark&rsquo; is nearer the
  German pronunciation. But you don&rsquo;t need to be too particular. Far more
  important to enjoy him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Far more important to enjoy everything.&rdquo; The youth&rsquo;s
  face clouded over with a look of half-truculent eagerness. &ldquo;Which
  reminds me, Freemantle, there&rsquo;s that Sunday games question coming up
  before the Council again. I suppose it&rsquo;s no use trying to persuade you
  to come over to our side?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No good at all,&rdquo; Howat answered, with a shake of the head.
  &ldquo;And you ought to know better than ask, after that last argument we
  had.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The trouble is, that last argument didn&rsquo;t convince me. And
  not only that, but it didn&rsquo;t convince me that it convinced you,
  either.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come now, that&rsquo;s too subtle for a parson on Monday
  morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Higgs leaned forward and tapped Howat&rsquo;s knee with his forefinger.
  &ldquo;Look here, why can&rsquo;t you be serious about it? I&rsquo;ve always
  had a sort of feeling you were the only parson in the town there was any hope
  at all for.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very flattering.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I mean it sincerely, flattering or not. We Labour fellows
  constantly find you on our side in all sorts of things&mdash;the housing
  question, unemployment grants&mdash;oh, any amount of matters that crop up.
  What we sometimes wonder is why you don&rsquo;t come over to us altogether.
  Frankly, we&rsquo;d welcome you just as wholeheartedly as we respect you
  now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat smiled, but rather wearily. He was in no mood for a political
  argument, especially with such a notoriously adroit debater as Councillor
  Higgs. He said, quietly: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really believe that parsons
  ought to identify themselves entirely with any political party. It&rsquo;s
  quite true that I often find myself on your side. On the other hand, I
  sometimes don&rsquo;t, and what would you have me do then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;d try to convince you. This question of Sunday
  games, now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear chap, I&rsquo;m not going to go over all that again with
  you. My position is exactly the same as it was last year&mdash;in such a
  matter I regard myself as the delegate of my congregation, and as
  they&rsquo;re overwhelmingly against the idea, there&rsquo;s nothing more to
  be discussed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I always thought a shepherd led his flock, not was led by
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think a shepherd would be foolish if he led both
  himself and his flock over a precipice?&rdquo; Howat&rsquo;s voice became
  more animated. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you try to understand my position? I
  hope&mdash;I even try to believe&mdash;that I do some good in this town.
  Amongst other things, I try to broaden people&rsquo;s minds&mdash;I&rsquo;m
  keen, as I daresay you know, on literary societies, debating clubs, music,
  the drama; anything that I think will get and keep people out of the
  commonplace rut. If I step warily, I may succeed&mdash;indeed, I sometimes
  feel that I am succeeding. But if I were to back you up in supporting Sunday
  games, I should merely split my congregation, smash up all the good work
  I&rsquo;m interested in, and&mdash;quite likely&mdash;make my whole position
  in Browdley an impossible one. Do you think that would really be the best
  thing that could happen?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, since you ask me, I do. It&rsquo;s the only course I&rsquo;d
  honour you for. As it is, I know for certain what I&rsquo;d for a long time
  suspected&mdash;that you&rsquo;re secretly on our side, but haven&rsquo;t the
  courage to stand with us.&rdquo; His voice rose excitedly, and after a pause
  for breath he added quickly: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Freemantle, I really
  don&rsquo;t mean to be insulting at all&mdash;I&rsquo;m only being as frank
  as I know how.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I quite see that.&rdquo; And at the back of Howat&rsquo;s mind
  was the thought: I&rsquo;ve said too much, somehow or other; I oughtn&rsquo;t
  to have let myself be enticed into an argument with this fellow&mdash;Heaven
  knows where it will lead to, or what tales he&rsquo;ll spread about
  afterwards...Higgs was one whom eloquence always stirs to greater eloquence.
  He went on: &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind so much if your people were all as
  virtuous as they pretend to be. But they&rsquo;re not. Look at the
  Makepeaces, the Battersbys, that dreadful old Monks woman&mdash;are they
  <i>really</i> the moral cream of Browdley society? Oh, and Garland the
  draper&mdash;mustn&rsquo;t forget <i>him</i>. He&rsquo;s the chap who shakes
  hands at your chapel door after Sunday services&mdash;the &rsquo;right hand
  of fellowship&rsquo;, isn&rsquo;t that what you call it? There&rsquo;s not
  much fellowship about him on week-days, I can tell you. We&rsquo;re on to him
  now about some cottages he owns in Silk Street; the rain comes in at all the
  roofs, but he won&rsquo;t do any repairs&mdash;we&rsquo;re trying to make
  him, but he&rsquo;s got a cute solicitor. I suppose, though, since he&rsquo;s
  a pillar of your chapel, this kind of talk must sound rather
  offensive?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat thought despairingly: I mustn&rsquo;t argue, whatever happens; the
  rain comes in at my roof too, by the way; Higgs and Garland are natural
  enemies, and I&rsquo;m not going to interfere between them...He said:
  &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t strike me as particularly offensive, but that&rsquo;s
  not to say I&rsquo;d consider it good taste to join in a discussion of
  individual chapel members with outsiders.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have a look at those houses in Silk Street and see things for
  yourself&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I might do that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good of you if you do. And I don&rsquo;t mind a bit being called an
  outsider. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll feel one yourself some day, so far as the
  chapel&rsquo;s concerned. The fact is, this town&rsquo;s sunk in narrow-
  mindedness, and it really makes a fellow sick sometimes to find out what
  he&rsquo;s up against. And I can&rsquo;t help feeling, too, that the sort of
  chap in these days who wants to do real good, to improve and elevate people
  and all that, doesn&rsquo;t find much scope or encouragement in the church.
  The church, if he lets it, will just use him up, waste his energies, and
  cramp him all the time. He can find better machinery elsewhere. There&rsquo;s
  dirt and hypocrisy in politics, I admit, but I think on the whole it gives
  bigger opportunities.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat smiled again. &ldquo;Perhaps so, perhaps so. But I sometimes wonder
  whether the people who live most usefully of all are neither parsons nor
  politicians, but just ordinary folk, like village postmen and engine-drivers
  and charwomen. It&rsquo;s an interesting question, but I mustn&rsquo;t wait
  to argue it&mdash;I&rsquo;ve already taken up far too much of your time, and
  I&rsquo;m pretty busy myself, too...It&rsquo;s settled, then, that I take the
  hymns?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, if you will. Thanks for making so little trouble about it. And
  as for the Sunday games&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find me, I&rsquo;m afraid, ranged alongside my brother
  ministers. Perhaps that will make you reconsider the comparison you made
  between me and them&mdash;I hope it will, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They both laughed and shook hands cordially, and Howat went down the
  stairs to the street with a feeling of almost reluctant liking for the young;
  councillor. Dangerous, though, to say too much to him...It was becoming
  foggy, as had seemed likely, and through the yellow gloom came the muffled
  chiming of the parish clock&mdash;a quarter to one. He hurried, so as not to
  be late for his midday dinner.</p>

  <p>Monday&rsquo;s dinner at the Manse was always predictable; it consisted of
  the remains of Sunday&rsquo;s joint minced into a sort of rissole and warmed
  up. Howat had had this so often and so unfailingly that it seemed now, by
  sheer familiarity, to have become appropriate&mdash;it both smelt and tasted,
  somehow, of Monday. He did not, however, bother a great deal about food,
  which was perhaps as well in the circumstances. He was not even aware that a
  few minor ailments from which he had suffered at times during the past dozen
  years had all been dyspeptic in origin.</p>

  <p>Dinner was served for four, since by that time Mrs. Freemantle had dressed
  and come downstairs. She was a thin, angular woman with everything rather
  sharp about her&mdash;her nose, her chin, her cheekbones, her eyes, her way
  of moving about, and her voice and speech. She was the youngest of her
  family, while Aunt Viney was the eldest, and despite a difference of physique
  which could hardly have been greater, there was yet an obvious sisterhood
  between them. They might bicker when they were alone (indeed, they sometimes
  did), but whenever they were together they had an air of being ranged
  foursquare against the rest of the world, even when the rest of the world
  consisted only of Howat. Their dispositions were complementary rather than
  similar; Aunt Viney could bluster, fly into tempers, and shout; but Mrs.
  Freemantle&rsquo;s voice, even in most perturbed moments, never rose above a
  high-pitched and hurried wail.</p>

  <p>Howat was always extremely thoughtful and polite to both of them, and
  submitted good-humouredly to their varying attentions. It was Aunt Viney who
  sewed buttons on for him (when she remembered), cooked, ordered from shops,
  and did the more domestic work of the household; in a shadowy way, if ever he
  were inclined to be irritated by her, he could always reflect comfortingly
  that she worked very hard, and that no one could imagine what they would all
  do without her. For his wife, of course, he had tenderer feelings, and if
  ever she were a little trying he always remembered how highly strung she was,
  and that quite small things were apt to upset her in a way that she
  couldn&rsquo;t really help.</p>

  <p>This particular Monday dinner found both Aunt Viney and Mrs. Freemantle a
  little cross, the former from a noisy and indeterminate quarrel with the
  servant which had been in progress; most of the morning, and the latter
  because the roof of one of the bedrooms was leaking again and the builder, in
  her opinion, couldn&rsquo;t have done his job properly when last he had come
  to repair it. But she was the kind of woman who could never he satisfied with
  saying a thing once; she had to talk rapidly and indignantly about the
  leaking roof for over ten minutes, while Howat listened with sympathy
  tempered by the knowledge that the roof always would leak till it was
  overhauled thoroughly, and that such an operation would cost more than he was
  ever likely to he able to afford. His stipend was just under three hundred a
  year, and though both his wife and Aunt Viney had small incomes of their own,
  there was really nothing like enough for the upkeep of so big a house. He
  himself would have preferred to move into a much smaller one, but his wife
  would never listen to the suggestion, and always talked of any residence less
  in size than the Manse as &lsquo;one of those poky little working-class
  houses&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>During or just after the midday meal it was Howat&rsquo;s habit to outline
  and discuss with her some part of his daily routine; he did this even when it
  was an effort, for he believed it his duty to let her share in all his
  affairs. He hardly realised that she had other and more satisfying points of
  contact with the small world of Browdley, and that a good deal of his well-
  meant conversation bored her. It bored her now, for instance, when he began
  to talk about the address he was going to deliver that evening on Mozart. He
  began to sketch out a plan of his ideas, and as often happened when once he
  began, he went chattering on, with slowly mounting enthusiasm, till Mary
  began to fidget and his wife to exchange supercilious glances with her
  sister. Their private opinion was that ideas might be all right for the
  platform or pulpit, but were hardly suitable for the dinner-table. In the end
  Mary neatly torpedoed the monologue by enquiring the date of Mozart&rsquo;s
  birth. Howat, after a rather vacant pause, said he didn&rsquo;t know exactly,
  but he fancied it must be somewhere about the middle of the eighteenth
  century. They were all very much amused at his confessed ignorance, and Mary
  rejoined pertly: &ldquo;You know, dad, I think you always go far above
  people&rsquo;s heads when you talk to them about music. Why don&rsquo;t you
  tell them the useful facts&mdash;when he was born, when he died, the names of
  the things he wrote, and so on?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat answered: &ldquo;Yes, of course&mdash;I ought to include all that, I
  admit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo; added Mary, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose it matters
  a great deal, for if this fog keeps on, there won&rsquo;t be more than half a
  dozen there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat nodded and stared blankly at the window, where yellow was already
  merging through orange to grey.</p>

  <p>It was too foggy, indeed, to go visiting in the town that afternoon,
  especially with the excuse of his bad throat; so he spent a pleasant couple
  of hours in the little school associated with his chapel. It was a
  second-rate school, doomed, no doubt, to extinction when any enterprising
  education policy should take possession of the Browdley authorities; but that
  day was unlikely to happen soon. Architecturally the school was hopelessly
  out of date; its rooms were small and badly lit, its corridors long and
  draughty, and its playgrounds mere patches of wasteland strewn with ink-black
  cinders. In this establishment there were three classes, the senior in charge
  of the headmaster, a Mr. Wilkinson, and the two junior ones taught by his
  daughter and another young woman.</p>

  <p>He first of all, as a matter of courtesy, paid a visit to Mr. Wilkinson.
  Wilkinson was a shabby little man with a pompous manner and a very large,
  pale, and flabby nose. He experienced certain difficulties of discipline, of
  which both he and Howat were well aware, but of which they both steadfastly
  pretended not to be aware; the wastepaper-basket in his room was usually
  sticky with the remains of half-sucked sweets which, from time to time, he
  made his pupils disgorge. (Howat would never have known this but for a
  complaint by the caretaker&rsquo;s wife.) After spending a few perfunctory
  moments in the senior room, Howat passed on to his daughter&rsquo;s, and
  here, indeed, his pleasure began. For he liked children, with an intensity
  that was no affectation; he often thought: If I were not a parson I should
  like most of all to be a schoolmaster. It was true enough, in a way, though,
  on reflection, he recognised that he would never have made a very good
  schoolmaster. He would always have shrunk from teaching the dull stuff that
  had to be learnt. Besides, he had the most preposterous ideas about
  education&mdash;preposterous, he was prepared to admit, from any normal
  parent&rsquo;s standpoint. As it was, he could put his theories into strictly
  limited practice with the certainty that as soon as he was out of the school
  the teacher would undo any harm he might have perpetrated.</p>

  <p>His daughter was pleased to let him take the class for a time, since it
  gave her extra moments to work at her Latin verbs. He began by walking round
  amongst the desks and observing what the children were doing; it was a
  geography lesson, apparently, and most of them were laboriously copying a map
  of Ireland out of ancient and very dirty text-books. He asked one boy why
  they were doing this, but the boy said he did not know. Then he began to talk
  to the boy, at first in an undertone, but later, without definitely realising
  it, in a voice to which all the class soon came to listen. He asked if anyone
  had ever been to Ireland; none had; then he asked if anyone had ever crossed
  the sea in a ship. And from that he progressed to a general talk about
  islands, and then islands very far away, and then uninhabited islands, and
  soon he was off on one of those extraordinary impromptu stories which he
  enjoyed just as much as did any of his listeners. This one was about two
  small boys sailing across the sea in a small boat, and coming to a land where
  nobody from England had ever been before. Howat then went to the blackboard,
  wiped out a careful list of exports and imports which his daughter had drawn
  up, and began to sketch a map of this strange land just as it came to the
  knowledge of the two boys. First the vague outline of the shore in the
  distance, then a narrow river inlet leading into the heart of dense jungle,
  and so on. Mountains, lakes, and vast swamps all figured in the boys&rsquo;
  wanderings, and as each exciting adventure happened Howat marked it down on
  the board. By the time that the young travellers had lost themselves in the
  midst of a forest infested with giant spiders and boa- constrictors, the
  whole class was in a ferment of excitement, as was Howat himself; for half an
  hour during that November afternoon Browdley did not exist for some four
  dozen of its inhabitants; the fog and the cotton-mill across the road were
  lost behind a blaze of tropic sunshine. When at last the school-bell rang,
  Howat stopped as one disturbed suddenly from a dream; he seemed to recollect
  himself and added, in an ordinary voice: &ldquo;Well, boys and girls,
  that&rsquo;s all to-day, I think. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll tell you more about what
  happened to the two boys some other time. I hope you know now something about
  maps, anyhow.&rdquo; But it was a lame excuse; he didn&rsquo;t particularly
  hope they did, or care whether they did or not; his aim had been
  different&mdash;something not very easy to put into words&mdash;something,
  indeed, which he was never quite sure of understanding himself.</p>

  <p>After he had gone his daughter resumed her work of teaching. She had been
  glad of the interval&rsquo;s respite, though she always said that after her
  father&rsquo;s intervention a class was completely ruined for the rest of the
  day.</p>

  <p>Howat usually ignored afternoon tea, though if he were out visiting and
  were offered it, he would accept. He preferred, however, when he was at home,
  an uninterrupted hour by the fire before his &lsquo;proper&rsquo; tea&mdash;a
  meal which consisted as a rule of tea and an egg. After this there was often
  another gap of an hour or so before the beginning of evening engagements.</p>

  <p>On this unpleasant November day Howat occupied both odd hours in reading a
  book which would have deeply shocked ninety per cent of his congregation had
  there been the slightest possibility of their understanding it. It was
  Jeans&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Universe Around Us,&rdquo; borrowed from the local
  library, which had obtained it at his own request.</p>

  <p>As Mary had predicted, there was only a very small attendance at the Young
  People&rsquo;s Guild that evening. The Guild was one of Howat&rsquo;s pet
  institutions; he had founded it himself some half-dozen years before, and it
  had flourished, he ventured to think, as handsomely as could have been
  expected. It met weekly during the winter months; in summer there were
  country rambles, visits to places of interest, and so on. It had always been
  Howat&rsquo;s idea to make it a centre of secular enlightenment
  (backgrounded, of course, by the chapel atmosphere); most of the weekly talks
  were on literary, musical, or artistic subjects&mdash;very few were
  definitely religious. This aspect alienated the sympathies of some of the
  older people, who thought that Howat was coddling the young and shirking his
  plain job of rubbing religion into them. Howat, though, did not care about
  that; if there were ever to be a choice (though there would not be if he
  could help it) he was all out for the young; the old, he felt, were so
  confident of attaining Heaven that they could look after themselves.</p>

  <p>As founder and president, Howat always opened the terminal session by an
  address on some subject or other; it also fell to him to fill in any gaps
  made by speakers dropping out after the programme had been made up. This
  November Monday was one of these gap-filling occasions, his talk on Mozart
  being in lieu of a paper on modern town-planning by a young local
  architect.</p>

  <p>The place of meeting was a bleak schoolroom furnished and panelled in
  pitch pine&mdash;a very hot room at one corner near a stove, and very cold
  and draughty elsewhere. Nothing relieved the brown varnished monotony of the
  walls except a map of Palestine and a tattered and faded temperance banner. A
  desk stood on a slightly raised platform, and on the desk lay a Bible, a
  hymn- book, and a carafe of water. (The room was used regularly for Sunday
  School and other chapel functions.) There was also a cupboard which, when
  incautiously opened, usually emitted a cascade of ragged hymn-books and
  tea-party crockery. Two inverted T-shaped gas-brackets shed a hissing
  illumination over the rather melancholy scene, and this evening wisps of fog
  curled in fitfully when the green-baize doors opened from the vestibule.</p>

  <p>Howat gazed with a certain dreamy satisfaction on the dozen or so young
  persons who comprised his audience. In some ways they satisfied him as much
  as a far larger gathering; because he could think of most of them
  individually, knowing their names, homes, and circumstances; and he could
  marvel a little at the spirit that had brought them out, on a foggy night, to
  hear him talk about Mozart. Surely he was not wrong, at such a moment, in
  thinking that he was accomplishing some kind of good in Browdley, that his
  years of persistence were bearing fruit after all? And he felt, as deeply as
  he had ever felt in the pulpit, inspired by a passionate desire to give these
  few youngsters something adequate to their degree of needing and wanting. The
  whole world stretched out beyond Browdley, a world they might and probably
  would never see; could he not show them an inner world of beauty, visible to
  all whose eyes were attuned to it? He thought then, quite suddenly and with
  an odd sensation of mind- wandering: These walls would look better with a few
  pictures&mdash;why not some of those coloured reproductions of Italian
  primitives, and so on? It wouldn&rsquo;t cost more than a few shillings; I
  daresay I could afford it myself. Still, I shall have to economise for a
  time&mdash;that trip to London will cost a bit, and the specialist&rsquo;s
  fee will probably be stiff- five guineas, maybe, or three if I plead poverty.
  Wonder if there is anything really serious the matter&mdash;queer how that
  pain comes and goes&mdash;I hadn&rsquo;t it this afternoon while I was
  talking to those children in school, but it came back during tea. Never mind,
  stick it out, whatever it is&mdash;no sense in whining over things...</p>

  <p>The mere thinking of his throat made it feel dry and parched; he would
  have poured out a drink from the carafe had not the water repelled by its
  stale, yellowish tinge. And just for a moment there carne over him the most
  absurd and ridiculous longing for something he would never dream of
  having&mdash;a glass of beer. One of those dark brown frothing tumblers he
  sometimes saw through the windows of public-houses&mdash;public-houses all
  warm and brightly lit, with men in them talking sociably and perhaps playing
  darts. In his mind, just for the moment, the picture stood out in vivid
  contrast to the chill, comfortless room in which he was shortly to begin his
  address.</p>

  <p>He half-smiled at the quaintness of the vision, and then, with a quick
  return to reality, nodded and smiled to Mr. and Mrs. Garland, who had just
  entered. They were by no means &lsquo;young people&rsquo;, and he did not
  recollect their ever having attended a Guild meeting before; still, he was
  glad enough to see them, though faintly surprised.</p>

  <p>Swallowing hard to ease the dryness of his throat, Howat rose from his
  chair and began to speak. He began haltingly, unfluently, as he so often did;
  those who heard him for only the first minute of any speech or sermon must
  certainly have thought him a very poor orator. It was as if he had, by a
  tremendous effort, to launch himself into a world of mind and spirit in which
  words came of their own accord. He kept saying: Mozart...Mozart...His face
  had a peculiar nervous twitch during those initial struggles; his rugged
  features looked, for the time, almost agonised; till, with a suddenness that
  was sometimes rather amusing, he was &lsquo;off&rsquo;. He had, beyond doubt,
  a voice and an enunciation of great beauty.</p>

  <p>Certain of his words and phrases sounded, in his own ears, far above
  others, and went on echoing long after he had spoken them. Was he soaring
  above their heads, he wondered, momentarily, remembering his daughter&rsquo;s
  caution? Well no, he thought not; he hoped not; and besides, even if he were,
  perhaps he could get them to soar with him&mdash;above their own heads and
  his too. If only that sharpness in his throat would disappear; it was absurd,
  at his age, to be bothered in such a way; he was only forty-three and already
  seeing specialists and worrying about his health. And suddenly, looking round
  at the young faces in front of him, he saw them all labelled, as it were,
  with the inevitable doom of age and death; life was so tragically short, and
  it seemed in some sense a kind of divine toss-up whether one succeeded or
  failed in getting anything out of it during the time allowed. How necessary
  to make the most of youth, to pursue while the pursuit had zest, to apprehend
  the beauty of the world that lay everywhere around, in sight and sound and
  feeling...He made a pause in his remarks, wound up his portable gramophone,
  and played over the Trio in E Major and then the two great Overtures; the
  music floated past him, dissolving, as it were, into the air of which it was
  born; he always felt that Mozart was like that, perfectly and enchantingly
  meaningless except for that one central unanalysable meaning&mdash;beauty.
  &rsquo;fever, he said when the records were finished, there had been an angel
  born upon this earth, that angel was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. We might not
  know a very great deal about the future life, but we must feel&mdash;indeed
  it was almost impossible not to feel&mdash;that it was linked up in a
  marvellous way with the beauty of our own world...Mozart...Raphael the
  painter...William Blake the poet...And then, with a little mist before his
  eyes, he was aware that he was making contact, that he was actually and for a
  second or so putting into the minds of these boys and girls an urge, a
  longing for something beyond their own immediate surroundings.</p>

  <p>He finished in secret triumph. He sat down. He felt drained of power, yet
  with a tired dreamy feeling of having conquered. Yes, yes, he would get those
  pictures. Was the fog worse, he wondered? His throat was not so bad now, and
  anyway, he didn&rsquo;t care&mdash;he was too tired and triumphant to care.
  The tune of the E Major Trio was in his ears. What happened next? Oh yes,
  someone usually got up and moved a vote of thanks. Only a
  formality&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t take more than a couple of minutes. Then a
  little chat with anybody who chose to stay behind, then the short walk
  through the fog across the playground and past the front of the chapel, and
  so into his house. A cup of hot cocoa. Bed. Heavens&mdash;he was
  tired&mdash;he was sure he would sleep well.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he realised that Garland was on his feet and beginning to talk.
  Pity it couldn&rsquo;t have been somebody else; Garland had such a raucous
  voice and would go on far too long. Never mind, though&mdash;decent of him to
  come.</p>

  <p>Garland, in fact, was one of those fussy, self-important men, full of
  official correctness, who never miss a chance to say &lsquo;a few
  words&rsquo;. An air of portentous solemnity hovered over everything he did
  and had, from the pompous modulations of his ill-pronounced words to the
  black cut-away coat whose collar was always lightly powdered with dandruff.
  He was rather squat in build, and had a black curling moustache whose waxed
  ends were absurdly visible when one saw him from the rear. Howat respected
  him as a trustworthy chapel official, but they had never attempted any more
  intimate relationship.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Garland was a thin-lipped precise-looking woman with a rigidity of
  bearing less solemn but more aggressive than her husband&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>Garland was saying: &ldquo;Of course we&rsquo;re all extremely grateful to
  Mr. Freemantle for his address, but I do feel there is an aspect&mdash;and a
  very important aspect&mdash;of his subject which he has left quite out of
  account. And that is religion. All this talk about beauty&mdash;music,
  poetry, and all that&mdash;isn&rsquo;t any use without the true spirit of
  religion. And I must say I don&rsquo;t hold with him when he said that we
  might not know a great deal about the future life. I contend, as every true
  believer must, that we do know a great deal about it&mdash;we know all about
  Heaven, and anyone who doesn&rsquo;t has only got to read his Bible. Fact of
  the matter is, people don&rsquo;t read their Bibles enough
  nowadays&mdash;there&rsquo;s far too much discussion of other books, poetry,
  music, and what not. First things should come first...And now let&rsquo;s
  refresh ourselves with a hymn&mdash;&rsquo;There is a Book who runs may
  read&rsquo;...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat&rsquo;s chin and mouth were half-hidden in the palm of his hand. At
  the mention of the hymn, however, he looked up abruptly and gave the opening
  note with his clear, vibrant baritone. In a scattered and rather ineffectual
  way the audience began to sing, led by Howat, and with Garland supplying a
  morose and untuneful rumble far below any classifiable key. It was unusual to
  sing hymns after a Guild meeting, but Howat didn&rsquo;t care&mdash;Garland
  could go through the whole hymn-book if he wanted. Howat felt: He means well,
  but I&rsquo;m glad he doesn&rsquo;t come to these affairs oftener.</p>

  <p>The hymn came to an end, and as the audience began to pick up hats and
  wraps and prepare to disperse, he realised that Garland was waiting behind
  deliberately, as if he wanted to say something. Howat was just slightly
  peeved about that; if the fellow wanted to see him, why didn&rsquo;t he call
  at the Manse? After meetings Howat liked a chat with the youngsters, but
  there wouldn&rsquo;t be any, clearly, if Garland stayed.</p>

  <p>After a few moments he was quite alone in the room with Garland and Mrs.
  Garland. The others had all disappeared through the green-baize door, and
  there was left no sound except the hissing of the four gas jets. Howat
  remarked conversationally as he packed up his gramophone: &ldquo;Bad night,
  Mr. Garland.&rdquo; (Garland was the sort of man who wouldn&rsquo;t do for
  anyone to drop the prefix.)</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; replied Garland, massively, and went on: &ldquo;As a
  matter of fact, Mr. Freemantle, we shouldn&rsquo;t have come but, only we
  thought it would give us a chance of seeing you in private.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Really? Well, anything I can do, of course&mdash;&rdquo; He felt so
  thoroughly tired, and more in the mood for anything on earth than for a
  private talk with Garland. However...</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You see, Mr. Freemantle, it&rsquo;s about our girl. She&rsquo;s run
  away from. home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; he made the necessary mental
  effort&mdash;Garland&rsquo;s daughter&mdash;the girl he had been teaching
  German&mdash;a pleasant girl, she had always seemed, and she had surprised
  him once, he recollected, by humming a tune from a Brahms sonata.</p>

  <p>He repeated: &ldquo;Indeed? She&rsquo;s run away from home, you
  say?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. On Saturday. She packed up all her things and went before we
  knew anything about it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But surely&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, it astonishes you, does it?&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Garland,
  tartly. &ldquo;We thought maybe you mightn&rsquo;t be so astonished as we
  were, seeing the chances she&rsquo;s had lately of confiding in
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Confiding in me?&rdquo; Howat was sheerly bewildered. &ldquo;I
  don&rsquo;t understand you, Mrs. Garland&mdash;I really don&rsquo;t
  understand. Your daughter has been taking lessons in German from me week by
  week, but apart from that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And it wasn&rsquo;t our idea she should do it, please don&rsquo;t
  think that for a moment. What would she be wanting to learn German for, I
  should like to know?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She gave no definite reason&mdash;not to me, anyhow&mdash;but I
  suppose she wished to improve her general education. Surely there&rsquo;s
  nothing very outrageous in that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very outrageous. She was full of mad ideas, always
  was.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But in these days, Mrs. Garland&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>These days</i>? It&rsquo;s a pity these days are what they are.
  A sinful, godless age, that&rsquo;s what it is.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat&rsquo;s fingers drummed on the desk-lid; he was becoming just a
  shade impatient. &ldquo;Well, well, that&rsquo;s a big subject&mdash;you were
  telling me about your daughter, weren&rsquo;t you? Do you mean that
  she&rsquo;s disappeared, and that you don&rsquo;t know where she is at
  all?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Garland here thought fit to intervene; he said, as if realising that his
  wife would only bungle the business: &ldquo;The fact is, Mr. Freemantle, we
  can only guess. We&rsquo;ve had no news at all except a card saying she was
  quite well but wouldn&rsquo;t be coming back. We couldn&rsquo;t read the
  postmark. And what crossed our minds was that perhaps she might have hinted
  to you something about her intentions. It&rsquo;s a most upsetting thing to
  have happened altogether.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I agree with you, Mr. Garland, and I wish I could help, but I
  assure you she never gave me the slightest idea that such a notion was in her
  mind. If she had, I need hardly say that I should have strongly dissuaded her
  and even, if necessary, approached you on the matter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Garland seemed to find this reply moderately satisfactory, but Mrs.
  Garland&rsquo;s eyes narrowed sharply. &ldquo;You mean that you haven&rsquo;t
  heard from her at all, then?&rdquo; she interposed.</p>

  <p>He shook his head and then suddenly remembered the Raphael picture that
  had arrived by the first post that day. &ldquo;Stay, though&mdash;well yes,
  now I come to recollect it, I did hear from her this morning, but it was
  merely a short message to say she wouldn&rsquo;t be coming for her usual
  German lesson to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh? So she has written to you then? Was that all she said? Did she
  give no explanation?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She merely said she would be out of Browdley at the
  time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What was the postmark?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must confess I didn&rsquo;t notice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps you still have the letter and it could be
  examined.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m afraid. It may be torn up&mdash;quite
  probably it is. Naturally it didn&rsquo;t strike me as particularly important
  when I received it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Garland again took the lead. &ldquo;Well, Mr. Freemantle, it&rsquo;s an
  unfortunate business, anyhow. She&rsquo;s left home, and we don&rsquo;t know
  what&rsquo;s happening to her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat found himself slowly rising out of a dream into this new and
  intricate reality that was being forced upon him. &ldquo;But surely, Mr.
  Garland, you have some idea <i>why</i> she&rsquo;s gone, at any rate? That
  seems to me almost as important as where she is, apart from the fact that it
  might afford a clue. She can&rsquo;t have acted like that without some big
  reason of her own.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He felt: Why are they bothering me about it? I can&rsquo;t help them, but
  I can see now it was a mistake to give the girl German lessons&mdash;I never
  guessed that her parents didn&rsquo;t approve of it. She ought to have told
  me, really...</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, she has her reasons, I&rsquo;ve no doubt,&rdquo; retorted Mrs.
  Garland, sourly. &ldquo;And precious fine reasons they are, too, if they were
  only known, I daresay. The idea&mdash;talking of giving up her job at the
  library and going abroad! That&rsquo;s what she did talk about, though you
  mayn&rsquo;t believe it. Of course we forbade it&mdash;absolutely. A good
  deal that we don&rsquo;t like we may have to put up with in these days, but
  there are certain limits, I&rsquo;m glad to say.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She talked of going abroad, did she?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been talking of it off and on for some time. But it
  came to a head last Friday night when we found she&rsquo;d been writing to a
  travel agency about railway tickets to Paris. And then, if you please, she
  calmly told us that she was going to go abroad in any case.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To Paris?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the things we have to guess. It doesn&rsquo;t
  sound a nice sort of place for a young girl to want to go to, does
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, really, she must have had some purpose in mind? People
  don&rsquo;t suddenly go to Paris without any reason at all. Did she give you
  no idea how&mdash;how she intended to support herself while she was
  away?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Garland rubbed his nose decisively. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t argue with
  her, Mr. Freemantle. When a daughter calmly informs her parents that
  she&rsquo;s going to do what they&rsquo;ve forbidden her to do, there&rsquo;s
  nothing left to argue about. She went up to her bedroom&mdash;as we hoped, to
  think it over and come to her senses. It seems, though, that she just packed
  her things, went to bed, and went off early in the morning by the first train
  before any of us was up. Altogether a most disgraceful affair. Of course one
  naturally thinks of all sorts of possibilities when a girl does a thing like
  that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat stared far away over Garland&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;I must say, from a
  very slight acquaintance with your daughter, she didn&rsquo;t really seem to
  me the sort of girl who would do anything that either you or she would need
  to be ashamed of.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That remains to be found out,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Garland.
  &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t mind telling you to your face, Mr. Freemantle, I
  think you&rsquo;re one of the prime causes of it all! You have a thoroughly
  unsettling influence on the young people&mdash;you always have had&mdash;you
  put ideas into their heads&mdash;it was quite enough to listen to you
  to-night to realise how all these things begin. As my husband said,
  there&rsquo;s a great deal too much loose talk in the world nowadays, and
  ministers, of all people, ought to know better than join in it. They&rsquo;re
  here to give us religion, that&rsquo;s what I say, not the things of this
  world.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat said, rather curtly: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we can discuss all
  that. You must let me know if there&rsquo;s anything practical I can do. And
  I&rsquo;m afraid I must go now. Good-night, Mrs. Garland. Goodnight, Mr.
  Garland.&rdquo; There was something unusual and rather sharp in his eyes.</p>

  <p>He strode out of the schoolroom into the cold moist fog. Something was
  hammering away in his head&mdash;a sort of desperately controlled temper,
  something that made him feel hot and ice-cold simultaneously. Those
  intolerable people! He could not bring himself to hate them, but his
  impatience of them was like a flame. And then quite suddenly the flame died
  down and he felt merely tired, emptied of all energy and willpower and
  enthusiasm. He found his way into the dark house and, over the remains of the
  kitchen fire, made himself a cup of cocoa. It was after midnight when he got
  to bed, and though his tiredness had increased with every moment, he did not
  find it easy to sleep.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap2"
     name="chap2">CHAPTER TWO &mdash; TUESDAY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The next morning, Tuesday, there was no fog or rain, but a
  clear frosty sunlight and a high wind from the east that scoured the streets
  of Browdley till they looked like bones picked clean. Most of Howat&rsquo;s
  morning study hours were taken up by callers, and at eleven he went out with
  the intention, before anything else, of getting his first breath of fresh air
  for several days.</p>

  <p>Once the pedestrian leaves the outskirts of Browdley he enters a flat,
  loamy, and not unpicturesque countryside, stud ded with small farms and semi-
  industrialised villages, with here and there a barn or an old mill that
  Rembrandt might have etched. There are paths through almost every field and
  in all directions, but one cannot, during an ordinary walk, lose sight of
  Browdley. Indeed, Browdley looks almost more massive and dominating at a
  distance of a few miles than closer by. Its factories huddle together into a
  compact pile, and on a misty day the observer might with a little effort
  fancy himself in sight of some medieval walled and fortified city, so sharply
  do the square cliff like factories mark the outlines of the place. There are
  dozens of tall chimney-stacks, but at such a moment they can seem almost
  decorative&mdash;the spires, perhaps, of the black cathedrals of
  industrialism.</p>

  <p>On Tuesday morning Howat took his favourite walk, which was along School
  Lane for a quarter of a mile beyond the town, across the potato fields to
  Shandly&rsquo;s Farm, and then back over the railway and along the bank of
  the canal. The sun was shining, and he walked fast, enjoying the cold wind
  and the cheerful landscape. Those who saw him doubtless envied a
  parson&rsquo;s freedom to take a constitutional on a fine morning.</p>

  <p>Mentally, however, he was still ruffled from that talk with the Garlands
  the previous evening, and as often happened, his mood was inclined to be one
  of rather desperate unbelief in himself. After all, <i>could</i> he be quite
  sure that what he was doing in Browdley was for the best? Could he even be
  quite sure that he was doing any good in Browdley at all? Mrs. Garland had
  accused him of unsettling the young, of putting ideas into their
  heads&mdash;well, all that, in a way, was what he wanted to do; and yet, when
  the balance was struck, was the net result indubitably favourable? He wished
  there were someone over him to say, with authority, either Yes, go ahead,
  you&rsquo;re all right&rsquo;, or No, stop it at once, you&rsquo;re
  wrong&rsquo;. That was the weakness, he had always felt, with these
  independent Nonconformist creeds&mdash;a man, if he were sincere, had to work
  everything out for himself, and by the time he had finished doing that he had
  often worried himself into complete lack of confidence in his own
  judgment.</p>

  <p>Of course, so far as the runaway daughter herself was concerned, he was
  fairly certain he had not been to blame. She had rarely attended chapel, and
  had not been a member of any of its associated societies; his influence on
  her, of whatever kind, could only have been slight. There had been the German
  lessons, true, but they had always, he recollected, been strictly matter-of-
  fact; indeed, it was curious how little he knew about the girl after those
  regular weekly meetings&mdash;she had told him practically nothing about
  herself, and he, perhaps unconsciously, had found this a welcome change from
  the usual outpourings of self-revelation to which every parson becomes
  accustomed. Apart from those German lessons, and a few chance words in the
  library where she worked, he hardly remembered ever speaking to her at all.
  And that reminded him, as he turned homeward along the canal bank, that he
  might use the remaining time before dinner to change a few library books for
  young Trevis.</p>

  <p>It was a relief, after so much doubting and self-incredulity, to be of
  some plain and obvious service to somebody. Trevis was a young fellow of
  twenty- one, who, after a successful and even brilliant career at Cambridge,
  had had a bad motorcycling smash and was compelled for the present to take a
  complete rest. The injuries had affected his spine, and Ringwood as well as
  more exalted medical authorities were not too optimistic about recovery.
  Fortunately old Mr. Trevis was fairly well off and could afford to keep the
  boy at home but the latter hated Browdley with a fierceness of which only
  Howat and Ringwood, perhaps, were aware; it was maddening, on the very brink
  of what had promised to be a fine career, to have to spend day after day in a
  stuffy little drawing- room full of presentation silver and unreadable
  law-books. For Mr. Trevis was a solicitor, a prominent local Freemason, and
  one of the most popular men in the town. Bluff, cheery, happy in his
  widowerhood, and with an elder son to take over the practice eventually, he
  did not worry alarmingly about the lad who, apart from a certain stiffness in
  moving about, did not appear to have very much wrong with him. &ldquo;What
  you want is fresh air and exercise,&rdquo; he often said; he did not realise
  that the boy could not have walked a hundred yards without falling down.</p>

  <p>Howat had liked the boy at their first meeting (Ringwood had brought them
  together&mdash;neither Trevis nor his family had ever had any connection with
  the chapel); and had soon come to feel for him an affection deeper than for
  anyone he knew outside his own home circle. One of the few ways he could help
  besides visiting was this changing of library books; he knew the kind of
  stuff that Trevis liked and took a keen pleasure in making selections which
  he thought would please. This morning he chose Somerset Maugham&rsquo;s
  &ldquo;Moon and Sixpence&rdquo;, Edith Wharton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ethan
  Frome&rdquo;, and a book by a youth named Michael Terry detailing his
  adventures whilst driving a Ford car across the Northern Territory of
  Australia from Queensland to the Indian Ocean. Carrying this oddly assorted
  literature under his arm, Howat called at the house in Mansion Street, and
  thoroughly enjoyed a half-hour&rsquo;s chat. There was something almost
  radiantly attractive about the boy now; his earlier robust good looks had
  been transmuted into a more remote and poignant charm; and to Howat, always
  acutely eager to put himself into another&rsquo;s position, it seemed as
  though Trevis must look on life as a receding pin-point of light glimpsed
  from the interior of a darkening tunnel. He talked to him for a little time
  about books; it was what they generally talked about; they certainly did not
  discuss religion. That was a topic Howat would never have been the first to
  broach. Ringwood, he was aware, told the boy improper stories, and though
  Howat hoped to satisfy a loftier need, he could never be quite sure that any
  gift, in such a case, could be more precious than a moment of any sort of
  amusement.</p>

  <p>After they had chatted desultorily for a time, Trevis asked if Howat had
  chanced to notice Miss Garland on duty at the library. Howat said no, she
  hadn&rsquo;t been there, and asked why Trevis had enquired. The boy replied:
  &ldquo;Because there&rsquo;s a definite rumour going about the town that
  she&rsquo;s run away with a man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;With a man, eh?&rdquo; Howat exclaimed, and in such a tone that
  Trevis interposed acutely: &ldquo;Oh, so you did know that she&rsquo;d run
  off, then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat&rsquo;s forehead contracted into a slow frown. &ldquo;Well, yes, I
  had heard so. But I didn&rsquo;t know that there was any suggestion of a man
  in the case.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps it isn&rsquo;t true. It&rsquo;s just the sort of thing
  people in this town would say, anyhow. Did you know her at all, by the way?
  Her father&rsquo;s something to do with your church, isn&rsquo;t
  he?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s the chapel secretary. But I don&rsquo;t know the
  girl at all well, though it so happens that for the last few months
  I&rsquo;ve been giving her private lessons in German.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed? Enterprising idea. How did you like her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Like her? Well, she seemed a pleasant sort of girl, though I
  can&rsquo;t say I formed any definite opinion. I just taught her the German,
  that was all&mdash;we never talked on any other matters.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just like you, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Trevis laughed.
  &ldquo;I can see now why you&rsquo;ve got the reputation in this town of
  being absolutely impervious to female charm. I don&rsquo;t suppose you even
  noticed whether the girl was pretty or not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat smiled; it slightly gratified him to receive this kind of
  unsolicited testimonial, for it had always been his aim to avoid any of that
  foolishness that so often mars and complicates the relationship between a
  minister and the younger ladies of his congregation. He replied: &ldquo;Well,
  anyhow, I certainly don&rsquo;t recollect that she <i>was</i>
  pretty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Trevis said, abruptly. &ldquo;But
  she&rsquo;s attractive, in her own way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know her, then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I used to. I haven&rsquo;t seen much of her for the last few years,
  though&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been away so often, and she also doesn&rsquo;t spend
  more time in. Browdley than she needs. They say that most nights she&rsquo;s
  off to Manchester as soon as the library closes down, and that she
  doesn&rsquo;t come back till the last train. Gay life, eh? Possibly&mdash;I
  should say she&rsquo;s capable of most things, and certainly of not telling
  anyone her own business. Unusual sort of girl.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you used to know her well?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, till my old man quarrelled with her old man-that must have
  been about ten years ago. Dad was old Garland&rsquo;s solicitor, you know,
  and solicitors have pretty cast-iron consciences, but even Dad boggled at
  some of Garland&rsquo;s business. Anyhow, they had a fine old row which ended
  by Garland taking his affairs somewhere else. I remember it all quite
  well&mdash;the girl and I were of the age when we were told that we
  mustn&rsquo;t play with each other any more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, we did, lots of times. But we gradually saw less of each
  other, for all that. I always rather liked her, I must say, and I&rsquo;d be
  sorry if she&rsquo;d made a fool of herself. I suppose it doesn&rsquo;t
  exactly fall within your province to do anything in the matter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At present the difficulty is that she hasn&rsquo;t let anyone know
  where she&rsquo;s gone to. Of course, if I could do anything I
  would&mdash;very willingly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Trevis, and the matter
  dropped.</p>

  <p>During dinner at the Manse conversation eddied and swirled around the
  dramatic disappearance of Elizabeth Garland, and Howat, in the centre of the
  whirlpool, was rather baffled by it all. He knew so little, and both his wife
  and Aunt Viney seemed to expect him to know so much; there were, it appeared,
  all kinds of astonishing rumours about the town. Not only was it now
  definitely accepted that the girl had absconded with a man, but the man
  himself had been provisionally identified as a member of a cinema orchestra
  in Manchester. It was quite obvious, Mrs. Freemantle said, that the girl had
  a completely bad character, and everyone must feel sympathy for Mr. and Mrs.
  Garland, such respectable people, in having been so disgraced. &ldquo;And to
  think,&rdquo; commented Aunt Viney, &ldquo;that only last Tuesday she was
  here for her German lesson, as large as life!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Freemantle, &ldquo;that you found
  it possible to get on at all with her, Howat. But then you&rsquo;re so
  unobservant about things. I must say, <i>I</i> never took to her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat said nothing for the simple reason that there seemed to him nothing
  to say; he had already heard quite enough talk about the girl, besides which,
  he hated gossip, especially of the less charitable kind.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And as for sending you that picture of a woman, I consider it
  nothing less than shameless in the circumstances,&rdquo; Mrs. Freemantle
  still went on. (Aunt Viney must have told her about it, Howat reflected; but
  then, of course, Aunt Viney always did tell her about everything.) &ldquo;She
  must actually have posted it on Saturday, when she was on her way with that
  man. I&rsquo;m surprised, Howat&mdash;I really am surprised that even you
  could have gone on giving her those lessons week after week without noticing
  anything!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat crumbled his bread uncomfortably. &ldquo;But, my dear, what
  <i>could</i> I have noticed? I merely taught her German. She behaved
  quite&rsquo; normally while she was here, if that&rsquo;s what you mean. And
  I do think that it would be better to refrain from judging the matter
  until&mdash;at any rate&mdash;we know a little more about it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And with this very mild rebuke, which he did not for a moment expect to
  have any effect, he relapsed again into silence.</p>

  <p>During the afternoon he &lsquo;visited&rsquo;. He believed that it was no
  use preaching at people merely; you must go and see them in their own homes
  and get to know them personally. He had always been regular and conscientious
  in so doing, but he did not, despite that, reckon himself a good
  &lsquo;visitor&rsquo;. He was pretty fair with people who were in any trouble
  or who needed the more straightforward kinds of advice, and he was all right
  with people who happened to attract him personally, and he was always a huge
  success with children; but there were a few persons who came into none of
  these categories. He was never quite certain whether they dreaded meeting him
  as much as he dreaded meeting them; and for the sake of this meagre doubt he
  kept up the practice, till, after several years of it, he had developed a
  barely adequate technique of small-talk suitable for such occasions.</p>

  <p>This afternoon he did a rather strange thing; he thought of all the people
  he least liked to visit, and visited them one after another. He did not quite
  know why he did this&mdash;not entirely, anyhow, to mortify the spirit, and
  certainly not at all with any idea of &lsquo;getting them over&rsquo;. On the
  contrary these visits were to be extra ones&mdash;surplus dividends, as it
  were, from the store of loving kindness in his heart. He thought: If
  I&rsquo;m going to be any good in this town, I&rsquo;ve got to dive far
  deeper than I&rsquo;ve done hitherto. Yesterday, while I was with Miss Monks,
  my feelings were absolutely selfish&mdash;I was thinking all the time what an
  old tyrant she was and wondering how soon I could decently get
  away&mdash;that, remember, with one of my chapel-members lying on her
  deathbed. After all, what do I do in this town with any enthusiasm except the
  things I like doing?&mdash;I like pottering about with children and young
  people, I like giving talks on literature and music, I like preaching, too,
  in a way&mdash;I like all these things, and therefore I do them. It all boils
  down to the fact of a rather stupendous selfishness masquerading as virtue;
  the truth is, I&rsquo;m no better than anyone else&mdash;I like what I like.
  But as a parson I ought to be different&mdash;yes, better&mdash;or else, in
  Heaven&rsquo;s name, why do I wear this collar the wrong way round?</p>

  <p>So, in a state of self-disgust that only gradually wore itself out, he
  visited old Jack Harmon, who was nearly stone deaf and was interested in
  nothing but Association football. Not only had he to be shouted at in a way
  of which his daughters alone had acquired the perfect knack, but his voice,
  when he spoke, was a barely coherent muttering to which nobody in his house
  ever paid the slightest attention. Howat, moreover, was not learned in
  football, and could only vaguely follow the gist of the man&rsquo;s talk. The
  pleasure his visit was giving was, however, obvious&mdash;too obvious,
  perhaps, since the old man, delighted to entertain the parson in a room which
  directly overlooked the street and through whose window every passer-by could
  see, clucked and gurgled his satisfaction till the saliva dribbled
  inelegantly down his chin. Howat shouted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and
  &ldquo;No&rdquo; and &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; while the pain in his throat,
  rarely absent altogether, became a white-hot ache; then, after about an hour,
  he managed to drag himself away, pursued even from the street-door by the
  man&rsquo;s joyful incoherencies.</p>

  <p>Next he called on Mrs. Roseway in Hill Grove (he had intended visiting her
  the previous day, but had put it off with an excuse which, he knew now, had
  been merely a disguise for selfish personal reluctance); she was eighty-four,
  and did nothing but grumble because she had rheumatism ("By Jove,&rdquo;
  Ringwood had once said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s time she had something!&rdquo;)
  Howat had never been able to make any headway against the quiet, almost
  contented querulousness of this old creature; she was fairly well off, yet
  (again quoting Ringwood) &rsquo;you couldn&rsquo;t get a penny out of her
  without chloroform&rsquo;. She had children, hard-working but unfortunate,
  living in neighbouring towns, and Howat always hoped he might some day
  persuade her to deal more generously with them. He had often come near to the
  point of broaching the matter, but had never quite managed it; this
  afternoon, with new determination in his heart, he decided that he would. He
  listened for a time to her complaints, and then began a plea for greater
  charitableness and help towards those in need of it, till at last the old
  lady, shrewdly perceiving where his eloquence might lead, shut him up with a
  quite final if not very courteous remark and resumed the more satisfying
  topic of her own ailments.</p>

  <p>Then he visited Joe Maracot, a former chapel member, now turned atheist,
  who had fallen off a lorry and fractured a leg. Maracot treated him with
  scarcely veiled hostility; he was a strong Labour enthusiast, an admirer of
  Councillor Higgs, and tried to lure Howat into an argument about Russia, but
  Howat, feeling himself being baited, declined to be drawn.</p>

  <p>Then (purely as a treat for himself) he looked in at the Infirmary and
  spent half an hour in the children&rsquo;s ward. After that he called on the
  two Miss Jekylls, who talked endlessly about foreign missions&mdash;a
  department of religious enterprise for which he had never, somehow, been able
  to share the optimism of its partisans. The continual twitter of the two
  ladies bored him (try as he would he could not help it), and their vision of
  an Africa perfected by frock-coats and hymn-books had that large simplicity
  that always affected him with a certain sadness of mind. And yet, he felt,
  the Misses Jekyll were very likeable; they believed in their vision and
  subscribed money for it with far more generosity than they could really
  afford (there was a little box for &lsquo;missionary pennies&rsquo; behind
  the clock on the mantelpiece); they thought as kindly of an idealised black
  man bowing down to wood and stone as they did harshly of the real
  unfortunates who lived within a quarter-mile of their own house. If only
  Howat could give a twist to that pathetic stream of good will, could bring it
  nearer home and canalise it so that it ran in a warming current through the
  streets of Browdley! He tried valiantly, but as fast as he mentioned local
  hardship, the two ladies romped merrily along to some other instance of
  wholesale conversion in distant lands&mdash;&ldquo;over a thousand baptised
  last month in India alone, so my missionary cousin writes to me.&rdquo; Howat
  forebore to reply that during that same month in India there must have been
  at least a quarter of a million non-Christians born; he felt so sure that
  they would be offended as well as unable to see the point of such a remark.
  He just let them talk on, accepted a cup of tea and a piece of cake, and
  then, after many mutual assurances that the visit had been enjoyable, took
  his leave.</p>

  <p>Lastly he visited an old man, a former chapel caretaker, slowly dying of
  heart disease; the man was obviously too ill to talk or to want to be talked
  to, and Howat did not stay more than a few minutes.</p>

  <p>By that time it was time for &lsquo;high tea&rsquo; at the Manse.</p>

  <p>After tea he went into his study and prayed. He did not kneel or even bow
  his head; he just sat back in an armchair before the fire and shut his eyes.
  He did not want his wife or Aunt Viney to come in (as they would often do
  without knocking) and find him in an obviously prayerful attitude; not that
  he was ashamed of praying, but prayer to them was such a professional
  business, something a parson did night and morning, a good deal on Sunday,
  and occasionally at other people&rsquo;s bedsides; he was sure they would
  think him ill if they caught him at it on any less customary occasion.
  Besides, his wasn&rsquo;t a definite prayer; he didn&rsquo;t put much of it
  even into words; it was just an expression of the feeling of worthlessness
  that had come over him, the doubt as to whether he was doing any good, and
  the desire to be given (if it were possible) some secret reassurance.</p>

  <p>As it chanced, Aunt Viney did interrupt; a message, she said, had come
  from Miss Monks&mdash;would Howat call round and see her some time that
  evening, if he could, as it was important?</p>

  <p>He sighed and answered yes, certainly. It was all over the town, of
  course, that the old woman was dying, and that Ringwood had given her the
  news, however, had been dwarfed in significance by that more exciting
  business about Garland&rsquo;s daughter. He put on his hat and overcoat and
  went into the chilly, lamp-lit streets. Well, he reflected, he would have a
  chance to do better with the poor old soul than the day before&mdash;perhaps
  it was more than he deserved. But he was very tired again, and there was the
  Temperance meeting he ought to look in at later on&mdash;they liked him to
  lead the singing.</p>

  <p>He reached the house in Lower George Street about half-past seven, and was
  shown up into that same stuffy, stale-smelling bedroom. But instead of a
  dying woman&rsquo;s greeting he was welcomed by a brisk &ldquo;Good evening,
  Mr. Freemantle &ldquo;, and saw Miss Monks sitting up cheerfully in bed with
  her eyes fixed on him in a way that put him rather in mind of a snake poised
  to strike. He began:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Miss Monks, and how are you to-day?&rdquo; in the usual
  manner, but he was hardly prepared for the tremendous precision with which
  she replied: &ldquo;Better.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Better? That&rsquo;s great&mdash;great!&rdquo; he murmured, and
  added irrelevantly that it was a gloriously clear evening, cold, but no
  fog&mdash;so different from yesterday.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And so I suppose,&rdquo; said Miss Monks, ignoring the weather,
  &ldquo;that Garland&rsquo;s girl has run away from home?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I believe so, yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not surprised. There was always something queer about
  that girl. I put it all down to not being made to go to chapel&mdash;Garland
  seemed to have no control over her at all. And then having that job at the
  library, too.&rdquo; She paused and continued impressively: &ldquo;There are
  books in that library, Mr. Freemantle, whether you believe me or not, which
  ought not to exist anywhere&mdash;let alone where young people can get hold
  of them. I don&rsquo;t hold with public libraries.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat made no answer to that, but smiled gently and waited for her to get
  to the real reason why she had sent for him. It was soon forthcoming. It
  appeared that she had been on the point of death about three o&rsquo;clock
  that morning and had then made a sudden recovery. She was convinced it was a
  miracle&mdash;the special intervention of a Providence evidently desirous of
  preserving her for some future activity. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m grateful, too, for
  such mercies,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;d like you, Mr.
  Freemantle, to join with me in a little prayer of thankfulness.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So he prayed again, and when that was over she went on to say that, as a
  more practical expression of gratitude, she had been thinking of making an
  alteration in her will. She had only a few hundred pounds to dispose of, and
  as the will stood, it was all left to Mrs. Kerfoot, her widowed niece who
  lived next door and had looked after her for many years. In view, however, of
  the recent dramatic intervention of Providence, she had come to feel that
  this would be a selfish arrangement; a hundred pounds would surely be enough
  for Mrs. Kerfoot, and the rest could then be devoted to loftier things. She
  had been thinking out details, in fact, ever since early morning, and had
  already sent a message to her lawyer. What she had in mind was some sort of
  charity, associated with the chapel and administered by the parson. She knew
  there were several existing charities of the kind in Browdley&mdash;one
  provided for loaves and candles to be given every Christmas to fifty
  deserving Church of England spinsters&mdash;she had often seen mentions of it
  in the local paper, and she had noticed that it was always called after the
  name of the original benefactor. Something like that she had in mind; it
  seemed to her a really charitable way of disposing of money, much better than
  leaving it all in bulk to a private person, however deserving.</p>

  <p>Howat listened rather unhappily as she expounded this evidently well-
  prepared scheme. He mentioned with diffidence that most charities of such a
  kind dated from hundreds of years back, when social conditions were
  different, and survived nowadays merely as antiquities. He also indicated
  that it was already becoming a matter of some intricacy to discover the fifty
  deserving spinsters who would accept the Christmas loaves and candles, and
  that the vicar of the parish church had often commented that there ought to
  be some way of altering things to fit in with more modern needs. In his
  (Howat&rsquo;s) opinion, if she would forgive him for expressing it, he
  didn&rsquo;t think such a bequest would really be the best way of using the
  money; there were many other things in these days&mdash;the infirmary, for
  instance, which badly required new X-ray equipment, or the cottage
  hospital&mdash;</p>

  <p>But that, if he had remembered, was tactless of him, for Miss Monks had a
  violent grudge against all such institutions, and answered tartly: &ldquo;Not
  with <i>my</i> money, thank you, Mr. Freemantle&mdash;I don&rsquo;t hold with
  them at all. Those who give to such things can do what they like with their
  own, but I have a right to do what I like with mine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh quite, quite,&rdquo; agreed Howat.</p>

  <p>In the end he did, after much persuasion, manage to convince her that a
  Letitia Monks Bequest on the lines of the loaves and candles would be a
  rather pointless affair. But he could not convert her to any alternative idea
  of his own; two things, he realised, were fixed in her mind&mdash;first, that
  the bequest should be connected with the chapel, and second, that it should
  be permanently associated with her own name. Finally, as the only terms on
  which she could be diverted from something absolutely fatuous, he agreed that
  the chapel was in some need of a new vestry. Yes, of course, it could be the
  Letitia Monks Vestry, and the name could be inscribed in stone
  somewhere&mdash;oh yes, he was sure it could. And he would certainly consult
  with her lawyer about it, if she wished&mdash;yes, he would do anything she
  asked. A splendid idea&mdash;extremely generous of her&mdash;future
  generations would undoubtedly appreciate it&mdash;oh yes,
  yes&mdash;undoubtedly...</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Miss Monks, with shrewd triumph, &ldquo;I feel
  it&rsquo;s the chapel that has made me what I am.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He stayed a little longer till a distant chiming reminded him that it was
  nine o&rsquo;clock; he had been there for an hour and a half; it really was
  time he looked in at that Temperance meeting. He was just shaking hands and
  preparing to leave when Ringwood&rsquo;s brusque voice came booming up the
  stairs.</p>

  <p>Ringwood, red-cheeked and cheerful as ever, came striding into the room in
  his heavy motoring coat. &ldquo;Hullo, Miss Monks! Thought I&rsquo;d just
  look in to see you again on my way home! Still feeling better? That&rsquo;s
  right&mdash;take things easily. Hullo, Freemantle&mdash;you here, too?
  Wonderful old lady, isn&rsquo;t she? No, don&rsquo;t run
  away&mdash;we&rsquo;ll go down together in a minute just give me time to hold
  her hand!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He had an air with him, Ringwood had; and Howat had often half-envied it.
  He was bluff and sometimes rude in his jovial way, but nobody ever
  minded&mdash;not that he cared if they did. He was by far the most popular
  doctor in Browdley; he was generous, kind-hearted, and hard-working, but he
  stood no nonsense and never let anyone waste his time. And the brusquer he
  was, the more, in a way, he was liked. In a few years, when his hair had
  turned completely white, he and his sayings would doubtless begin to grow
  legendary.</p>

  <p>Miss Monks, at eighty-nine, was no more impervious to that forceful charm
  than many a girl in her teens. She simpered almost coyly as Ringwood felt her
  pulse and passed a hand across her forehead. &ldquo;Keep quiet,&rdquo; he
  adjured her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been talking too much. Freemantle&rsquo;s
  fault, I daresay. Good night, now. Sleep well. And I&rsquo;ll be round in the
  morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He nodded, drew on his gloves, and took Howat&rsquo;s arm; and the latter,
  with a murmured farewell to the old lady, allowed himself to be piloted
  downstairs and into the street. The doctor&rsquo;s Morris, five years old,
  waited at the kerb. &ldquo;Get inside,&rdquo; said Ringwood, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
  going to drive you home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat clambered in; he was weary, and not sorry to be given a lift.
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cold night,&rdquo; he commented. &ldquo;Damn cold,&rdquo;
  agreed Ringwood, and slipped into gear. It was difficult to talk during the
  drive, as the car made at least twice as much noise as any other Howat had
  ever experienced; he stared ahead through the murky windscreen, a little
  confused in mind with that sudden rush of lamp-posts and shop-fronts past
  him. &ldquo;That was a stuffy room,&rdquo; he shouted, as if in indirect
  explanation of his silence. Ringwood shouted back: &ldquo;Sour as a midden.
  Why don&rsquo;t she have a window opened? How long had you been there?&rdquo;
  Howat answered: &ldquo;Since about half-past seven,&rdquo; and Ringwood, with
  a curious and characteristic noise in his throat, exclaimed: &ldquo;Good
  God!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then it was gradually borne upon Howat&rsquo;s mind that Ringwood was
  driving him, not to the Manse, but to his own house in Dawson Street. He said
  &ldquo;I say, Ringwood, I thought you were taking me home,&rdquo; and
  Ringwood replied, gruffly: &ldquo;So I am&mdash;to <i>my</i> home. What more
  do you want?&rdquo; Howat began to explain his Temperance meeting, but
  Ringwood interrupted: &ldquo;My dear man, you&rsquo;re coming in with me for
  a while, and your temperance people can all go and drink themselves to
  death.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They drew up outside the ugly detached villa in which the doctor lived. He
  had only a housekeeper to look after him, and the house was many rooms too
  big; it had formerly belonged to an older-fashioned doctor with a large
  family, a top-hat and tail-coat, and a brougham. Ringwood had made no effort
  to adapt the premises to his more modest uses; some of the rooms were
  altogether unfurnished, and all were shabby. He had a decent income, but he
  never cared about the more complicated comforts of life; he would keep the
  chairs in his dining-room till they actually fell to pieces, just as he would
  drive his old car till the repairers finally declined to patch it up any
  more. He liked good, plain food and fifteen-year-old whisky, and (when he had
  any spare time, which was not often) he would read any sort of book except
  novels.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he said, almost pushing Howat out of the car. He
  followed the parson up the short gravelled path and, unlocking a side-door,
  manoeuvred him into the unlit waiting-room that adjoined the surgery.
  &ldquo;Straight through&mdash;you know the way,&rdquo; he directed, switching
  on a light. The unlovely room faced them with its stiff array of
  straight-backed chairs and table of ancient magazines. Ringwood passed
  through into the surgery beyond. It was a crowded, glass-roofed apartment,
  not unlike a greenhouse, full of the usual smell of drugs and india-rubber,
  and lined with shelves of books, bottles, and the accumulated litter of three
  decades in Browdley. It was extraordinary, though true, that amidst this
  confusion Ringwood always did know exactly where everything was.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;sit down and make yourself
  comfortable.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He put Howat in a big leather chair that could be made to tilt
  backwards&mdash;the chair in which, before the days of specialised dentistry,
  many a Browdley sufferer had lost an aching tooth. Then he lit the gas-fire
  and wandered away into the small dispensary that opened off the surgery at
  the further end. He kept shouting out from this inner room, his words
  punctuated with the clink of bottles and glasses.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I was wrong about the old girl after all, Freemantle&mdash;you
  win that bob. Could have sworn she&rsquo;d peg out during the
  night&mdash;never was more surprised than when I saw her perking up in bed at
  ten o&rsquo;clock this morning. They&rsquo;ll have to shoot her, that&rsquo;s
  all...Seriously, though, her heart&rsquo;s pretty dicky&mdash;take her off
  sudden one of these days. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind betting all the money
  I&rsquo;ve got that you and I&rsquo;ll be in at the kill before this time
  next month.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat half-smiled; Ringwood&rsquo;s flippant phrases sometimes shocked,
  but never exactly offended him. He said, after a pause: &ldquo;You know,
  Ringwood, I often envy you doctors. There&rsquo;s something so downright
  about the things you do for people. We parsons have to grope about wondering
  what we <i>can</i> do. You just go and do it. To-night, for instance, you
  took that woman&rsquo;s pulse and temperature in about a
  minute&mdash;probably a far more useful service than I managed to perform in
  the whole hour and a half I was there with her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;it depends a lot on what you did do.
  Chattered, I suppose&mdash;I noticed her heart was a bit jerkier after it. If
  she dies in the night I shall put on the certificate &lsquo;Talked to death
  by a parson.&rsquo; Can&rsquo;t think what you found to say to her all that
  time, I must admit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, for one thing, I prayed.&rdquo; He said that in a queerly
  troubled voice, and added: &ldquo;Does that sound to you a rather odd
  confession?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not at all. After all, it&rsquo;s in your line of business, just as
  I tap chests and look at tongues.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wonder if it really is quite the same sort of thing as
  that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sometimes, Freemantle, I think you wonder a damn sight too
  much.&rdquo; Ringwood came bounding out of the dispensary with a tumbler of
  whisky and water in one hand and a half-filled medicine-glass in the other.
  The latter he held out to Howat. &ldquo;Here, drink this. You need
  it&mdash;it&rsquo;s only a pick-me-up&mdash;quite harmless and nonalcoholic.
  Don&rsquo;t think I haven&rsquo;t noticed the state you&rsquo;ve been getting
  yourself into these last few months.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat took the glass. &ldquo;Thanks, Ringwood&mdash;though I&rsquo;m not
  sure I do need it. Touch of nerves, perhaps. A few rather troublesome things
  have been happening lately. Last night, for instance, I had a worrying kind
  of interview with the chapel secretary, Garland.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Garland the draper?&mdash;yes, I know him. Little chap with
  black moustaches&mdash;looks rather like a seedy croupier at a fifth- rate
  casino. Well, what was all the fuss over? They say, by the way, his
  daughter&rsquo;s hopped it&mdash;maybe the old boy was feeling a bit peeved
  over that when you saw him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was about that&mdash;that we had the&mdash;the argument,&rdquo;
  said Howat. Then he told Ringwood briefly all the details. Ringwood listened
  intently, perching himself on the edge of the desk and sipping whisky from
  time to time. At the end of the story he said: &ldquo;So they&rsquo;re trying
  to blame you for what&rsquo;s happened, are they? Well, I don&rsquo;t think
  I&rsquo;d worry about it if I were you. Queer sort of girl, I
  remember&mdash;rather nice voice&mdash;good figure, too&mdash;I had to give
  her the once-over, you know, before she took on that job at the library. Cut
  above her pa and ma, I thought jolly good luck to her if she <i>has</i> left
  the old folks at home. Wish there were more would do it&mdash;look at the
  unemployed&mdash;thousands of &rsquo;em&mdash;no initiative&mdash;no
  ambition&mdash;rather hang about Browdley street-corners than try their luck
  anywhere else. Of course they might say much the same of us&mdash;we stick to
  the old place, don&rsquo;t we?&mdash;but then, we&rsquo;re getting
  on&mdash;at least I am&mdash;I&rsquo;m sixty next birthday. But you&rsquo;re
  not so old, Freemantle&mdash;I often wonder why you stay on here. Don&rsquo;t
  you ever feel you&rsquo;d like to try for a change?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Often. Terribly often. But there again, you doctors have the
  advantage. You could clear out to-morrow and feel that you were doing just as
  much good somewhere else, but I couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;it&rsquo;s taken me
  twelve years even to begin to do anything here, and if I went away all that
  would probably be wasted.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, nonsense. You parsons take yourselves far too seriously. After
  all, if you do your best, what more <i>can</i> you do? That&rsquo;s how I
  always feel in my job. Sometimes I cure, sometimes I kill&mdash;people take
  the risk when they call me in&mdash;I make no promises except to do as well
  as I know how. If I come a cropper over something it&rsquo;s not my
  fault&mdash;I can&rsquo;t help it&mdash;and I assure you I never let it lose
  me a wink of sleep. Why should I?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Howat said. &ldquo;But then, you&rsquo;re so certain
  of the good you do&mdash;you know it&mdash;you can see it with your own
  eyes&mdash;people whom you&rsquo;ve cured walk about the streets as a living
  reminder and proof.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And a damn sight worse off some of &rsquo;em are than if I&rsquo;d
  killed &rsquo;em! My dear chap, it isn&rsquo;t a matter of doing good,
  it&rsquo;s a matter of carrying on with a job. If I once began to think in
  terms of ethics, I should probably send old mother Roseway an overdose of
  strychnine to-night&mdash;yes, and a dozen others I could name. Fortunately
  I&rsquo;m content to plod along at the job I&rsquo;m paid for, and it&rsquo;s
  a pity you can&rsquo;t be satisfied in the same way. After all, you preach,
  you visit, you bury and marry and all that, you run no end of societies and
  things&mdash;I should imagine you give pretty good value for money, on the
  whole.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t even that. I&rsquo;ve got to satisfy
  myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ringwood approached Howat and laid a firm hand on his shoulder. &ldquo;You
  know, Freemantle, I should say you were in for a fairly serious breakdown if
  you don&rsquo;t take care. You want a holiday&mdash;some kind of change from
  this infernal round of visiting old women and singing temperance
  hymns.&rdquo; His voice, which had been serious for a moment, relapsed into
  its more usual bantering tone as he added: &ldquo;Personally I never take
  holidays of the ordinary kind&mdash;haven&rsquo;t done for twenty
  years&mdash;but when I feel myself getting a bit edgy I ring up Hudson and
  hand him over my practice for two or three days; then I pop off to London and
  have a real good beano. Dinner at a chophouse, then the silliest show I can
  find, then a few drinks wherever I can get them, then&mdash;well, I
  wouldn&rsquo;t like to tell you all that is on the programme sometimes when
  I&rsquo;m in town. But it doesn&rsquo;t often happen&mdash;I find a few days
  of dissipation lasts me longer now than it used to. Growing old, I suppose
  that&rsquo;s what it is.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you can&rsquo;t really see me doing
  anything of that sort. Though as a matter of fact I do happen to be going to
  London this Friday&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got to come to terms with a firm about
  supplying a new heating apparatus for the chapel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s your chance. You won&rsquo;t be all day
  choosing a heating apparatus. And I don&rsquo;t expect you&rsquo;ll hurry
  back to this benighted spot by the very next train, will you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall put up for the night at one of those bed-and-breakfast
  hotels in Southampton Row, and probably catch the 10.30 back on Saturday
  morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rubbish, man! Stay in town and make a week-end of it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps I might except for the fact that I have a Bazaar committee-
  meeting and a young men&rsquo;s class on Saturday evening and two services to
  take on Sunday, as well as Sunday school and the Armistice service. People
  don&rsquo;t realise that a parson has work to do&mdash;indeed, I hardly dare
  mention to most people that I&rsquo;m going to London; they look at me with
  that &lsquo;lucky dog&rsquo; expression, as if I were just treating myself to
  a holiday.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Which is precisely what you ought to be doing. Anyhow, you&rsquo;ll
  have one night in town&mdash;and take my tip: make a real night of
  it&mdash;dinner and theatre&mdash;don&rsquo;t stint
  yourself&mdash;don&rsquo;t go to bed till the small hours. Remember that: I
  shall ask you, mind, when you get back, for a full report, and if you
  haven&rsquo;t taken my prescription there&rsquo;ll be trouble!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They laughed and chatted on for a few minutes longer, until Howat looked
  at his watch and said he must be going. He rose and glanced shyly at
  Ringwood, for momentarily he had an impulse to tell the doctor about that
  pain in his throat. Why not, after all?&mdash;it would save a few guineas,
  and if it were anything serious...but the mere possibility checked the words
  long before they could have reached his lips. Ringwood had been a good friend
  for years, and Howat suspected real affection behind the ferocity of manner;
  it would all be so much less unnerving with someone whom he did not know.</p>

  <p>He said good-bye, but Ringwood insisted on driving him back to the Manse.
  When at last he was alone in his study, glancing at a few things that had
  arrived by the evening post, he began to think in some detail about his
  Friday plans. He would travel up by a morning train, arriving in London soon
  after lunch; he could see the engineering people in the early afternoon, and
  then be at Wimpole Street for four. And after that? It would depend, of
  course, on how he felt; he might not be in the mood for anything at all. A
  pity, perhaps, that he couldn&rsquo;t get back to Browdley the same
  night...He tore open the wrapper of the London <i>Times</i>, which was sent
  him by post each day, and on the front page an announcement caught his
  eye&mdash;a violin and piano recital at the Cavendish Hall on Friday evening;
  a good programme, too&mdash;Schumann, Beethoven, Brahms. Sometimes, in
  earlier years and at very rare intervals, he had made special trips to London
  to attend some particular concert or recital; he had not done so lately, for
  financial reasons, but now the thought of sitting once again in a
  concert-hall and listening to Brahms (Brahms of all composers) gave him a
  sudden pricking of anticipation 3 whatever dreadful things were in store for
  him on Friday, that would at least help to redress the balance. He wondered
  if they would play the Sonata in A major. The opening theme of the first
  movement began to pour through his mind in a clear stream; it reminded him of
  something, of somebody, of somewhere he had once heard it before, and not so
  very long before&mdash;curious, yes&mdash;he remembered now&mdash;he had
  heard that &rsquo;girl humming it at the beginning of one of those German
  lessons, and he had been too surprised at the time to make a remark or ask a
  question. Perhaps, he now reflected, she had picked it up from the cinema
  musician.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap3"
     name="chap3">CHAPTER THREE &mdash; WEDNESDAY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">He slept rather well (it might have been, he guessed, that
  Ringwood&rsquo;s pick-me-up had contained something to make him do so) and
  woke up feeling considerably refreshed; then, after breakfast, a rare mood
  seized him, and for the first time for many months he did not spend his
  allotted morning hours in the study. Instead he adjourned to the room on the
  opposite side of the lobby&mdash;the parlour, a chilly bay-windowed apartment
  used only on fairly infrequent occasions, and furnished in a style which
  future period connoisseurs will perhaps extol as Edwardian. There was a
  litter of spindly chairs, a large-patterned and highly-coloured Axminster,
  and a good deal of poor-quality inlaid work and china in cabinets. The only
  object, however, which lured him to this unrewarding scene at nine
  o&rsquo;clock on a November morning was the pianoforte&mdash;an upright
  German instrument, not very good in tone, but on the other hand not nearly as
  bad as its surroundings might have suggested. On and off since he got out of
  bed Howat had been thinking of that concert on Friday evening; he had already
  begun to feel a little excited about it, and excitement had put him in one of
  his periodic moods for what his wife called &lsquo;making up bits of
  tunes&rsquo;. She could never see much point in the occupation, for although
  some of the tunes had occasionally won prizes in competitions, they were
  never &lsquo;printed,&rsquo; as she said, nor did they seem to her at all
  attractive when Howat played them over to her. She also disliked the sound of
  improvising and experimentation on the piano, and complained that even in the
  bedroom she could hear it, and that it always gave her a headache. Howat,
  therefore, never devoted himself to his &rsquo;tunes while she was in the
  house, which meant that for years he had had very few opportunities of doing
  so at all. But this morning, Mrs. Freemantle, contrary to usual habit, had
  taken breakfast downstairs and had gone out immediately afterwards with Aunt
  Viney; there was a sale at a dress shop in a neighbouring town, and it was
  most important that she should arrive in time.</p>

  <p>Howat, in that cold and unwelcoming room, was almost childishly happy with
  his music-paper and pencil. They revealed a part of him that few people ever
  saw; indeed, he kept it particularly to himself, because (for one reason) he
  did not wish his congregation to think he still had designs on their hymn-
  book. Years before, when he had first arrived in Browdley, there had been a
  tremendous row over that; he had nourished great visions of making the chapel
  a centre of musical culture (why, he had argued, should that sort of thing be
  left entirely to the Anglicans and Romans?) and had incautiously let it be
  known that he did not consider certain old and well-known revivalist
  hymn-tunes to be musically first-rate. The resulting upheaval, which he had
  barely managed to live down, had convinced him that his more important work
  would be sadly hampered if he allowed himself to be sidetracked into the
  position of a musical Savonarola; so thenceforward he had scrupulously left
  all questions of hymns and anthems to the organist, a local insurance-agent,
  whose dream was to play the &ldquo;Poet and Peasant&rdquo; overture on a
  three-manual instrument that had a Vox Humana stop.</p>

  <p>It was remarkable how completely Howat had learned that early lesson.
  Rigid self-discipline over a period of years had given him power to tolerate
  what the strictly musical part of him must have detested; Sunday after Sunday
  heard him joining, with that deep baritone of his, in music whose words and
  tunes matched each other in utter commonplaceness; and whenever the critical
  temptation arose he could manage to stifle it by thinking of the spirit that
  ranked beyond the mere letter, and of that deep religious feeling which must
  be held so much more worthy than any technique of art.</p>

  <p>This morning, however, no such distracting thoughts occurred to him, and
  he yielded himself; for two hours and more, to a task which he found totally
  absorbing. There was a school concert due to take place about Christmas time,
  and he usually taught the children some kind of song for the occasion; why
  not, then, something composed by himself, if it seemed good enough when he
  had finished it? But the idea, after all, did not strike him till he had been
  some time at work; it was a mere excuse for going on, not a reason for
  beginning. The truth was, to put it quite plainly: his wife was out and he
  felt in the mood.</p>

  <p>When he left the Manse, a little later than his usual hour (for he had
  somewhat lost count of time whilst at the piano) he felt pleased, though far
  from satisfied, with what he had done. It sent him back, in memory, to those
  very early years when he had day-dreamed himself the author of some colossal
  symphony, bowing acknowledgments before a frantic first-night audience at the
  Queen&rsquo;s Hall. Absurd, of course; he knew more accurately now the true
  extent of his talent; but it was tempting, and rather fragrant, to recollect
  those ancient ecstasies. Sing-song homeward walks along the Kentish lanes,
  with stars overhead and his boyhood friends arm-linked on either side; hours
  with the piano or violin (he played both instruments passably well); trips to
  Canterbury, Dover, Maidstone, sometimes even London, to sample the art of
  some celebrity. One after another, and in completely unchronological order,
  the great masters had moved into his youthful comprehension&mdash;Chopin
  first, then Beethoven, Bach, Mozart, and Brahms last of all. In those days
  music had seemed everything to him, but that of course was before the crisis
  in his early life which, though he did not greatly care for the term, could
  only be called his &lsquo;conversion&rsquo;. Looking back now over a span of
  a quarter of a century he had a disappointingly vague recollection of how
  that had happened; but he could remember perfectly a certain winter&rsquo;s
  night when he had first heard the Kreutzer Sonata and had walked home
  afterwards along moonlit and frost-bound roads from the railway station...It
  was a pity, really, that there was no kind of musical club or society in
  Browdley; he had often thought of starting one, but he was rather afraid it
  would take up too much of his time. Besides, nowadays people had gramophones
  and the wireless...He wondered if Higgs, who had said he was keen on music,
  would support him in the idea of holding short evening concerts on Sundays
  after the time of church and chapel services? Of course one had to move
  warily in things like that; there would probably be opposition from some of
  the older people, or else they would insist that all the music played on such
  occasions should be &lsquo;sacred&rsquo; music...as if all good music were
  not sacred...</p>

  <p>Howat, striding along the High Street with these and other reflections in
  mind, was far too preoccupied to keep his usual keen look-out for people he
  knew; indeed, he was not even looking where he was going and narrowly escaped
  collision with a man who was standing in a rather peculiar posture on the
  pavement. He was about to mutter a vague apology when he caught sight of a
  pair of very recognisable black moustaches. &ldquo;Ah, Mr. Garland,&rdquo; he
  exclaimed, and wondered whether Garland really wanted him to stop or not. For
  Garland was outside his own shop, scrutinising through the glass a roll of
  cloth which an assistant was fixing in position. At intervals of a few
  seconds he shouted directions, ignoring the fact that the assistant could not
  possibly hear him; but as this had been his method of supervising
  window-dressing for thirty years or so, he probably did not see any reason to
  alter it. &ldquo;Ah, good morning, Mr. Freemantle,&rdquo; he answered,
  swinging round sharply. He stopped, as if waiting for Howat to make the first
  move in the conversation, and for a few moments the two men stared at each
  other with some discomfort, while the assistant behind the plate glass stared
  at both of them impartially. At last Garland opened with: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
  heard the latest news about my daughter, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Latest news? Have you&mdash;have you heard from her
  then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, we&rsquo;ve not heard, but we&rsquo;ve got to know, and
  that&rsquo;s been quite enough. Come inside a moment&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want
  to shout these things on the pavement.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat followed dubiously, reflecting that there was really no need to
  shout them at all. The interior of Garland&rsquo;s shop, as they both walked
  through it to an inner apartment, afflicted him with a spasm of melancholy;
  it was very dark, and the assistants were pale and sickly-looking youths,
  whom Garland glared at fiercely as he passed them. In a sort of inner office
  filled with bills and ledgers and patterns of cloth Garland motioned Howat to
  a chair, closed the door carefully, and resumed: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s run away
  with a man&mdash;a man who plays the fiddle in a picture-house.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat said: &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;d heard something to that effect, but I
  was hoping it could be no more than a rumour.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A <i>rumour</i>? God bless my soul, they were seen together at
  Manchester getting into the train!&rdquo; His voice thickened with
  indignation. &ldquo;Of course neither my wife nor I could countenance that
  sort of thing. Not at any price would we take her back now that we know what
  has happened. She&rsquo;s disgraced our name&mdash;the only thing we can do
  is to try to forget that she&rsquo;s our daughter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat found himself staring at a peculiarly sinister-looking
  tailor&rsquo;s dummy, armless and legless, that had been flung into a corner
  of the office amidst a heap of brown paper. He had been propelled so
  abruptly, as it were, from the world of his own thoughts into this other
  world of angry fathers and erring daughters and rolls of gents&rsquo;
  suitings that he could hardly, for the moment, get his bearings. Then the
  last few words of Garland&rsquo;s remarks echoed in his mind and brought him
  up with a jerk. He said, rather sadly: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it may be
  a little too early to reach such a decision, Mr. Garland?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not at all. We&rsquo;re a respectable family&mdash;we&rsquo;re not
  going to make any terms with evil-doing. Out she stays, now that she&rsquo;s
  gone, and I&rsquo;d say the same to any of my other children. She need never
  come back to Browdley thinking she&rsquo;ll be admitted here
  again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, well, I suppose if you feel like that about
  it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I <i>do</i> feel like that, and my wife would say the same. If thine eye
  offend thee, pluck it out, so the Good Book says.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It also, I believe, mentions forgiveness&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It says we should forgive our enemies, not our
  daughters.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Which set Howat reflecting absently that it was, most certainly, much
  easier to forgive one&rsquo;s enemies than one&rsquo;s friends and
  relatives&mdash;could it be, then, that the more difficult achievement was
  not seriously expected of us? Garland, however, had clearly not meant so
  much, and Howat answered, with sudden distaste for the entire argument:
  &ldquo;Anyhow, Mr. Garland, there doesn&rsquo;t seem much point in discussing
  all this till we definitely hear where the girl is and what she&rsquo;s
  doing. I wish&mdash;I do wish sincerely&mdash;that I could help you in some
  way&mdash;I assure you I sympathise most deeply&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what anybody <i>can</i> do. Personally, I
  don&rsquo;t expect ever to hear from her again&mdash;if she&rsquo;s decided
  to live that sort of life, she&rsquo;ll know that we won&rsquo;t have
  anything more to do with her. We don&rsquo;t even want to hear her name
  mentioned. Henceforward&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Garland continued in this strain for several minutes longer, and Howat, at
  the first considerable pause, was glad to make his excuses and get away.</p>

  <p>The second post usually arrived at the Manse towards noon, and was placed
  on the study table to await Howat&rsquo;s return from his morning&rsquo;s
  visits. That Wednesday morning, when he reached home, there was quite a
  collection for him to deal with&mdash;bills, circulars, appeals&mdash;the
  usual mixture, and then, between two larger envelopes, a small one, addressed
  in a writing which he faintly recognised, though he could not quite decide
  where he had seen it before. He opened the envelope and read, from a single
  sheet of plain paper without any address heading:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Mr.
  Freemantle</span>,&mdash;You will be surprised to hear from me, I am sure,
  but I am presuming on our slight acquaintance to ask a favour. No doubt by
  this time you and everyone else in Browdley must know that I have left home,
  and though I do not regret doing so, I do not want my parents to worry about
  me unnecessarily. I wish you could assure them that I am perfectly all right
  and quite happy. I hate leaving as I had to do, but I really do feel that I
  am too old to be treated as a child. Do you think you could possibly explain
  that to them? I know it is asking a great deal, but I cannot think of anyone
  else who could do it. I must thank you, too, for the German lessons which I
  am sure will prove of use to rue, and I enclose two pounds which I think I
  owe you for them. I have no permanent address just at present, but for the
  next few clays anything addressed c/o the Charing Cross post office would
  reach me. With kindest regards and many thanks,<br>
  Yours sincerely, <span class="smcap">Elizabeth Garland</span>.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>Howat stared at the letter with a sharp sensation of dismay. This Garland
  affair seemed to get more and more complicated and to be dragging him,
  against his will, nearer and nearer to the centre of it. He had always been
  careful to avoid any sort of private friendship with the younger girls of his
  chapel&mdash;he thought it undesirable for a good many reasons&mdash;yet here
  he was, the confidant, whether he chose to be or not, of a girl who had run
  away from home and was eloping (to use the politest word) to Paris. It was
  all rather unfortunate, and he did not quite know what would be the best
  course to take. If he showed the letter or conveyed the message to Garland,
  he could imagine the fellow&rsquo;s conclusions. Nor, despite the
  girl&rsquo;s optimism, did he feel at all equal to explaining to Garland that
  his daughter was &rsquo;too old to be treated as a child&rsquo;. Really, it
  was a most difficult situation and he went into dinner feeling sadly
  perplexed. Almost as soon as he sat down, his wife said: &ldquo;I suppose you
  didn&rsquo;t call on the Garlands, Howat? Don&rsquo;t you think you ought
  to&mdash;to express our sympathy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He answered: &ldquo;I met Garland in the street outside his shop and we
  went in for a little talk. I told him how sorry we were.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did he tell you that the person the girl&rsquo;s run off with is a
  man over fifty&mdash;married and with a family?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good heavens, no? Wherever did you hear that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mrs. Freemantle smiled in a satisfied way and exchanged a glance with Aunt
  Viney; it was so rarely that she could rouse her husband&rsquo;s interest,
  much less a touch of excitement, in any titbit of local gossip. &ldquo;Viney
  heard it from a woman in the baker&rsquo;s shop this morning. It&rsquo;s
  true, because the woman&rsquo;s son has a job at the same
  cinema&mdash;he&rsquo;s a ticket attendant or something.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know. It sounds so&mdash;so incredible. A man
  of that age and a girl of&mdash;how old would she
  be&mdash;nineteen&mdash;twenty or so&mdash;I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s twenty-two.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat did not answer for a time, and at last he merely remarked, as if to
  himself: &ldquo;Oh, then she has a legal right to do as she likes. I
  didn&rsquo;t quite realise that. But still...&rdquo; He checked himself,
  feeling he had already discussed the matter at far too great a length.
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all most unfortunate,&rdquo; he ended up, &ldquo;and I do
  think that the less people talk and spread gossip about it, the
  better.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Wednesday afternoon was the time for the weekly meeting of his
  Ladies&rsquo; Working Party and Sewing Guild, and it was his custom to look
  in about three o&rsquo;clock, and take an unwanted cup of tea in a schoolroom
  that always smelt rather depressingly of old clothes. He did not much care
  for the job, but it was expected of him; the women liked the few minutes of
  social contact with the minister; it gave them food for gossip afterwards
  whether he looked well or ill, whether his clothes were shabby, whether he
  got on all right with his wife, if it were true that his son in Canada had
  entirely gone to the bad and never wrote home, and so on.</p>

  <p>Howat read in his study till three o&rsquo;clock that afternoon; then he
  walked over to the schoolroom. The women greeted him with their usual fussy
  murmurs of appreciation, but it was noticed immediately by the more observant
  of them that he did not seem altogether himself&rsquo;&mdash;he did not make
  those customary jovial remarks about the garments they were working at, those
  time-honoured witticisms which never failed to produce attacks of coyly
  restrained giggling. On the contrary, he seemed preoccupied, his smiles went
  over their heads as if directed at another world, and he went on stirring his
  tea in an absent-minded way long after the two lumps of sugar were most
  certainly dissolved.</p>

  <p>And at a quarter-past three, which was rather earlier than his habit, he
  bade adieu to the ladies and went out into the glooming streets. He felt he
  wanted a walk, and left the town by the main road, turning into muddy fields
  as soon as he could. He walked briskly for a mile or so, and then leaning
  against a stile, re-read the letter in his pocket amidst the falling
  twilight. A puzzle, really, to know what to do. She had appealed to him, and
  despite the impossibility of what she asked, he rather liked the style of the
  letter&mdash;simple, straightforward, neither explaining nor apologising, but
  merely asking. And no mention of the man in the case. That, he thought,
  showed a certain delicacy. But a married man with a family...really, how
  could such a thing be possible?</p>

  <p>Howat, in fact, was bewildered; for, despite his years, he knew little
  about the world of private scandal&mdash;certainly less than did an average
  girl at a boarding-school, He never read the <i>News of the World</i>, and
  never went to the cinema; throughout his adult life, even during the War, he
  had preserved an ignorance, perhaps even an innocence, that was largely
  compounded of distaste and lack of interest. Divorces, liaisons, <i>crimes
  passionels</i>, and all the rest of the Sunday diet of many a quite
  respectable family, affected him with a slightly disgusted incredulity which
  he found hard to conceal; fortunately, however, such things belonged mainly
  to a world with which Browdley had little in common.</p>

  <p>Then, with a jerk of inward perception, he passed from bewilderment to
  personal misgiving. Here was a girl, a daughter of one of his own chapel
  officials, proposing to do something monstrously unwise (quite apart from any
  question of morals); and he, the Reverend Howat Freemantle, was stirred by
  the matter to no more profound emotion than a sort of peeved fastidiousness.
  It was rather as if Ringwood, meeting a man bleeding to death by the
  roadside, should pass by for fear of getting Ms clothes soiled. After all,
  what was the good of his pastorate if he couldn&rsquo;t make himself of use
  in such an emergency? He thought, with a quick return of his old
  self-upbraiding mood: Oh yes, you&rsquo;re all right for giving addresses
  about Mozart and drinking tea with the ladies, but when it comes to tackling
  the practical sort of work that justifies the rather eccentric costume you
  wear and the prefix to your name, then you fail utterly and hopelessly.
  Really, really, you aren&rsquo;t going to let a girl of twenty-two run off
  with a married man of fifty...or are you? (He answered himself: But you
  can&rsquo;t stop her; she&rsquo;s over age; she has the legal right to do
  what she wants and she knows it.) But, man, you can stop her, or you&rsquo;ve
  got to try, anyhow. She&rsquo;s given you a loophole; she&rsquo;s sent you an
  address; there&rsquo;s nothing, indeed, to prevent you from actually meeting
  her, if she&rsquo;ll see you, when you go to London on Friday; then you can
  put your persuasive eloquence to a more vital test than the luring of
  threepenny bits into the collecting plate. However much you dislike the job,
  you&rsquo;ve got to see that girl, you&rsquo;ve got to talk her into her
  right senses, and you&rsquo;ve got to make her return home. (But then,
  Garland says he won&rsquo;t have her back at any price.) Nonsense; he will,
  or, if he says he won&rsquo;t, then you&rsquo;ve got another job&mdash;to
  persuade <i>him</i>. And in any case, whether he relents or not, your duty
  with the girl is plain...</p>

  <p>Howat was thoroughly wretched by the time he returned to the Manse for
  tea. He had made up his mind that he would not and could not shirk his duty,
  but he felt no sort of enthusiasm about it, still less any confidence of
  being successful. It was all so extraordinary, so unpleasantly removed from
  his usual &lsquo;beat&rsquo;. During the past dozen years there had been many
  occasions on which he had had to exert his personal influence in some cause
  or other, but they had all been interventions of a more straightforward
  kind&mdash;pleading with an employer not to prosecute in a case of theft,
  arranging terms of peace between landlord and tenant, telling youths they
  oughtn&rsquo;t to spend so much money in the public-houses, and so on. But
  this affair was clearly different in kind as well as in degree.</p>

  <p>That evening there took place in the chapel the customary week-night
  service, and for perhaps the first time in his life Howat gave an address
  which he knew, while he was speaking, did not represent the best that was in
  him. The subject was &lsquo;prayer&rsquo;, and he heard, with dismay, his own
  voice, perfectly fluent and modulated, dispensing a representative selection
  of all the more obvious platitudes that had ever been coined on the
  topic.</p>

  <p>He wished, while he was leading the singing of the last hymn, that he
  could remember more about the girl. He couldn&rsquo;t even picture her in his
  mind, but then, he had never had a good memory for faces. All he recollected
  (rather oddly, in the circumstances) was that she had seemed to him quite
  normal and pleasant.</p>

  <p>He felt so sure that he would not easily sleep that night that after
  making cocoa in the kitchen he took the cup to his study, and settled himself
  in his favourite armchair. But in such a solitude he was more than ever at
  the mercy of upbraiding conscience; he knew that he must, inevitably, see the
  girl, and he could no longer even shirk the necessary details of fixing an
  appointment. In the end (about midnight) he took pen and paper and wrote the
  following:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Garland</span>,&mdash;
  I received your letter, but before attempting to do what you ask, I would
  rather like to talk things over with you. It happens that I shall be in
  London on Friday of this week&mdash;could you meet me, say, at Charing Cross
  post office at 5.30 p.m.? There will not be time for you to write in answer,
  so I will hope to see you there if you can manage it.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>As he read this over he had the ignoble thought: Maybe she won&rsquo;t
  come; she&rsquo;ll guess I mean to argue with her and try to get her
  back...And that, after another troubled bout with his conscience, made him
  compose a much shorter note&mdash;merely:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Miss
  Garland</span>,&mdash;I shall be in London on Friday&mdash;can you meet me at
  Charing Cross post office at 5.30 p.m.? There will not be time for you to
  reply to me here, but I will hope to see you if you can possibly manage
  it.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>It was almost one o&rsquo;clock when he went out to post the letter.
  Caution advised him not to drop it in the pillar-box at the corner of School
  Lane; the Browdley post office was notorious as a centre of gossip and
  scandal- mongering. Instead he walked to a small wall-box about a mile away
  in the country and in a different postal area. A tired wakefulness was on
  him, and his throat was giving pain again; well, never mind, in another
  couple of days he would know the truth about that. The walk calmed him a
  little; the night was cold and clear, and even the badly-proportioned faade
  of the chapel loomed with a certain dignity into the blue-black sky. The
  theme of the song he had been composing that morning recurred, but somehow
  failed to satisfy&mdash;poor stuff now, remembered against a background of
  pain and starlight that seemed to throb in rhythmic unison together.</p>

  <p>Back at the Manse he thought of the earlier draft of his letter, thrown
  into the wastepaper-basket; safer, perhaps, to burn it. He did so, with
  difficulty in the dying embers of the fire, and afterwards, on sudden
  impulse, opened the drawer of his desk which contained the Raphael picture.
  He stared at it for a moment, almost as if he hoped it would tell him
  something; then, after a faint sigh, nothing was left but to put it away,
  turn out the light, and go to bed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap4"
     name="chap4">CHAPTER FOUR &mdash; THURSDAY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">He had slept poorly; his throat was bad again; and the bacon
  and eggs, due to renewed miscalculation or negligence on the part of Ellen,
  were almost uneatable. He did not grumble, partly because Mary grumbled so
  much, but chiefly because he had no appetite. &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll
  be wanting your breakfast early tomorrow, Howat?&rdquo; Aunt Viney said, but
  he replied: &ldquo;Oh no, I&rsquo;ll make myself a cup of tea before I
  go&mdash;I can get a meal on the train. There&rsquo;s no need for you or
  Ellen to get up any earlier than usual.&rdquo; He disliked giving trouble,
  not wholly from unselfish motives&mdash;he disliked the trouble that giving
  trouble caused.</p>

  <p>After breakfast he had hoped for an hour or so of quietness; as it
  chanced, however, several callers took up his time; a woman wanted a
  &lsquo;character&rsquo; written out for her small boy, a Sunday school pupil;
  and an unemployed young fellow, a complete stranger, called to know if Howat
  could give him some job of painting or cleaning windows in the chapel. Howat
  couldn&rsquo;t, but the man&rsquo;s long story of tramping the country in
  search of work depressed him in a way which the narrator joyfully perceived;
  he amplified his tale till Howat was finally reduced to a condition of
  nodding melancholy. In the end a ten-shilling note, which Howat could ill
  afford, changed hands, and the man was sent to the kitchen to see if he could
  be given a meal. He got one, but Aunt Viney meanwhile put him through various
  tests of her own devising, with the result that, so she claimed afterwards to
  Mrs. Freemantle, she felt sure he was a fraud&mdash;&ldquo;though, of course,
  you can never prove these things, and Howat had given him something,
  I&rsquo;ll dare be bound, as he always does unless I catch them first before
  they get inside the house.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Afterwards came a professional call from Salcombe, the Wesleyan minister
  at the other end of the town&mdash;a large, grey-bearded man with a harsh
  voice and a curious trick of fidgeting with his pince-nez all the time he was
  speaking. He wanted to talk to Howat about the Armistice Day service; Howat,
  he understood, had charge of the hymns; what hymns were going to be chosen?
  Something well-known, of course; and if he, Salcombe, might be excused for
  making a few suggestions...Howat found that Salcombe had everything most
  accurately mapped out&mdash;he wanted this hymn and that, and this and that
  verse omitted&mdash;all, naturally, for reasons which he was quite prepared
  to explain in detail. Howat, however, saved him the trouble by a swift and
  comprehensive acquiescence; yes, quite; exactly; he was perfectly agreeable;
  oh, most certainly, just so, just so. And Salcombe went home afterwards and
  remarked to his wife at lunch (they took dinner in the evening): &ldquo;By
  the way, I called on Freemantle this morning, my dear. I got my way with him
  about those hymns. An easy man to deal with, if only one uses a little
  tact.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>About a quarter-past eleven Howat went out; he had several calls to make
  in the town. One was at the bank; he cashed a cheque on his own private
  account for twenty pounds (more than enough, he reckoned, for the London
  trip, including the cost of a new suit of clothes, if he should decide to buy
  one, and the highest conceivable specialist&rsquo;s fee.) Then visited the
  library, verified the times of his trains the next morning, and chose another
  batch of books for young Trevis. The boy read so fast it was difficult to
  keep up with him, but at length Howat made a selection which he hoped would
  please&mdash;Haldane&rsquo;s &ldquo;Possible Worlds&rdquo;, and two novels,
  Hergesheimer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Java Head&rdquo; and one called &ldquo;Brown on
  Resolution&rdquo; by a writer named Forrester. Those ought to last Trevis
  over the week-end, anyway. He went round to Mansion Street with them and
  spent an hour or so chatting with the boy, whom he found at first in a rather
  depressed mood. Before leaving, he asked if there were anything Trevis would
  like him to bring back from London&mdash;&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be there more
  than a few hours, but I&rsquo;ll have time to run round the shops, if
  there&rsquo;s anything you think you&rsquo;d care about.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Trevis answered, rather sadly: &ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t too much trouble
  you could bring me a London evening paper&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t seen one
  since I left Cambridge. And it&rsquo;ll only cost threepence if you get them
  all. There&rsquo;s nothing else I want, thanks all the same.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Right, then. I won&rsquo;t forget. And you can expect me round with
  them on Monday morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shook hands and was just going out of the room when Trevis called back:
  &ldquo;Oh, by the way&mdash;any more news about that girl of
  Garland&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat answered: &ldquo;Nothing very definite, I&rsquo;m afraid. Only
  rumours which perhaps I oughtn&rsquo;t to repeat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No need&mdash;I&rsquo;ve probably heard them. They say the
  man&rsquo;s a dreadful creature fat little Jew with a bald head and gold
  teeth. So they say, mind you But I thought you might know
  something.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat shook his head. &ldquo;I wish I did. Who gave you that description
  of the man?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Our maid had it from one of the neighbours, and heaven knows where
  she got it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s extraordinary&mdash;if it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, isn&rsquo;t it? But then, Elizabeth was always an
  extraordinary girl.&rdquo; There was a pause, after which Howat continued,
  with growing intensity: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not only extraordinary,
  it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s monstrous. A young girl barely out of her teens
  and a man&mdash;like that&mdash;married&mdash;twice her age&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I suppose it all counts for nothing when two people reckon
  themselves to be in love.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Love?</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat uttered the word incredulously, as if it were the last that would
  ever have occurred to him in such a connection. Even its very sound, though
  he enunciated it often enough in his public prayers and sermons, had a way of
  seeming different when uttered in a small room and in the course of casual
  conversation. <i>Love</i>, indeed? Love to him was the feeling he had for his
  wife, and which he presumed other men had for their wives; he understood it
  as such; it was a straightforward, simple feeling, perfectly reasonable and
  devoid of complication. Whereas this feeling of Elizabeth Garland for her
  paramour (the quaintly old-fashioned term was the only one he could bring to
  mind) must be something altogether different, something totally and
  mercifully outside his own and most other people&rsquo;s personal
  experience.</p>

  <p>He said, abruptly: &ldquo;Good-bye, Trevis, must get away&mdash;so many
  odd things to do before tomorrow. I won&rsquo;t forget those papers for
  you...And as for that other matter&mdash;the one we&rsquo;ve just been
  discussing I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s useless to theorise. Perhaps things
  may not turn out as badly as we fear. Good-bye, now, until Monday.&rdquo;
  Then he went home to dinner at the Manse.</p>

  <p>He was busy all afternoon; it was amazing how even a projected absence of
  two days entailed all sorts of arrangings and postponements, letters to this
  person and that, instructions, suggestions, and excuses. He was by nature a
  hard and enthusiastic worker, and Browdley had well learnt that if there were
  a charity concert to be organised, a subscription to be raised, a movement to
  be launched, a defunct society to be resuscitated, or any particularly
  tiresome or exasperating piece of work to be done, the Reverend Howat
  Freemantle could usually be relied upon for the job. It was not that he
  enjoyed the fuss and bother of such things (quite the contrary, indeed), but
  it was always easy to persuade him that they were duties that someone ought
  to do, and that if he didn&rsquo;t tackle them, probably nobody would. It was
  known, too, that once he had set his hand to a task, he never flagged, never
  complained, and never shirked responsibility.</p>

  <p>So, during a dozen years, his life had gradually become more fretfully
  busy, nor had he developed to any degree the art of delegating authority and
  leaving odd jobs to subordinates. He was old-fashioned, too, in his methods;
  a telephone would have been a help to him, but he believed he could not
  afford it, and he still wrote out all his letters by hand. He would sometimes
  have welcomed assistance from his daughter, but he felt that she had her own
  work to do, and he did not care to ask her. Often, when a succession of
  exacting trivialities tired him out completely, he would feel that he really
  must cut down some of his societies; but when he began to think out which
  ones to cut, he always found the problem far too hard. Enthusiasm, indeed,
  was ever ready in him to rise up at the mere thought of neglecting or
  abandoning anything.</p>

  <p>This afternoon, this Thursday afternoon, he found the hundred and one
  urgencies of the moment producing in him that familiar mood of tired
  resentment. One of his activities was the treasurership of a Savings
  Certificate Club; children at day and Sunday school brought their pennies to
  him or to Mary, and the accumulation was invested at the local post office.
  All this required careful booking, and now, he discovered, as he went through
  the records, Mary had let things get in a muddle. After over an hour of
  exceedingly tiresome reckoning he succeeded in restoring the club to solvency
  by means of a grant from his own pocket of three and ten-pence. It was
  annoying, and he was, so far as he could ever be, annoyed. If Mary had been
  there in the house he might even have addressed her strongly; but she was
  out, and he could only feel vaguely out of humour with himself and things in
  general. Really, he reflected, surveying the litter on his desk that
  represented work both finished and unfinished, he would have to prune away a
  lot of his routine work; he felt like a pioneer in a tropical jungle, growing
  weaker every moment while the enveloping foliage became denser and harder to
  penetrate. There was the Antiquarian Society, which always for some reason
  sent him the most troublesome Latin documents to translate he knew Latin, it
  was true, but he was no particular scholar&mdash;why couldn&rsquo;t the
  Grammar School masters try their hands at that sort of thing? And the Tennis
  Club (he wasn&rsquo;t interested in tennis and couldn&rsquo;t imagine why
  they had asked him to be secretary), and the local League of Nations Society
  (he was interested in the League of Nations, but there were other people who
  ought to be able to do the job of President quite as adequately), and the
  Hospital Sunday Fund (a splendid thing, doubtless, but why didn&rsquo;t some
  of his professional colleagues take their turn with it?)&mdash;he reviewed
  them all in his mind, one after the other, and wondered which obligation he
  could get rid of with least commotion.</p>

  <p>And then, on top of it all, and in addition to that annoying three and
  ten-pence, came the thought of the morrow&mdash;the early rise, the walk
  through the dark streets to the station, bag in hand, the crawling local
  train, the ride across Manchester in a tram, the express to London, booking a
  room at a hotel, visiting the heating-apparatus people in the afternoon, then
  the appointment with the specialist, and after that, if she turned up, his
  meeting with that girl at Charing Cross. What a day! It was the last two
  items that seemed most to be feared, and perhaps even of the last two, the
  vision of the Wimpole Street consulting-room did not trouble him quite so
  much as the thought of what he would have to say to the girl. Yet he felt,
  with slow rage inside him: This is my real work, this job of saving
  souls&mdash;this one job which I shirk is the real thing I&rsquo;m here for.
  All this other stuff, this parade of being busy that makes many a parson
  think he&rsquo;s a success when he&rsquo;s really only doing a clerk&rsquo;s
  job&mdash;all this merely disguises the real issue&mdash;the fact that if I
  fail in this Garland affair, I fail utterly. These societies and clubs and
  meetings and such-like have been a veil hiding life from me and me from life;
  after all my years of ministerial work, I don&rsquo;t know where I am when
  I&rsquo;m faced with something out of the ordinary; I don&rsquo;t understand
  the mainsprings of human conduct, probably not as well as young Trevis,
  certainly not as well as Ringwood or the Catholic priest...</p>

  <p>Towards twilight he took his letters to the pillar-box, and after posting
  them walked along School Lane as far as the edge of the town, despite a light
  rain that was falling. The problem of what he should say to Elizabeth Garland
  and how he should persuade her to return to Browdley, was more than
  perplexing; it was beginning to be an obsession. All the so far known and
  meagrely reported ingredients of the affair danced before his mind like
  animated fragments of a jig-saw puzzle&mdash;the Raphael picture she had sent
  him, the fuss with Garland, her letter from London, and Trevis&rsquo;s
  description of the fat little Jew fiddler with the bald head and the gold
  teeth. What was it that she or any girl could feel for such a man? Some kind
  of physical infatuation? But there once more he was in uncharted seas,
  wondering at the sort of desire that could so outweigh considerations of
  home, family, position, and morals.</p>

  <p>He tried even to recollect his own desires, so far as he had ever been
  conscious of them; and, though he felt it almost sacrilegious to do so, he
  cast back in memory to his early days of courtship and marriage. Of course he
  had always loved his wife, and he was still, he would have said, &lsquo;in
  love&rsquo; with her; but he recognised, nevertheless, that there was a
  fiercer passion that belonged peculiarly to youth. In his own life it had
  coincided with his &lsquo;conversion&rsquo;, and when he tried to think of
  those early days he had a vision of peaceful evening walks across fields to
  chapel, with Mary by his side; he could not, at such a distance in time,
  recollect exactly what had been his feelings during those walks, but he was
  quite certain that the course of true love, in his case, had been
  exceptionally smooth.</p>

  <p>As for temptation of any kind since marriage, he could honestly and with
  confidence assert that he had never even known what it was; indeed, the mere
  contemplation of it was distasteful. Yet there was a world, he knew, in which
  unpleasant things of that sort did abound&mdash;a strange world in which
  Elizabeth Garland, for one, was dangerously adrift, and which lay pitilessly
  beyond the scope of all the societies of which he was president and
  secretary. He dared not, merely to preserve his own comfort, shirk total
  knowledge of that world; on the contrary, it might sometimes be his
  unpleasant duty to explore.</p>

  <p>He went home for tea, and in the evening there was the weekly Brotherhood
  Meeting. His throat, which was definitely worse, gave him a good excuse for
  not attending, but he would not take it; he went, sang, spoke, and made his
  throat so painful that it kept him awake for half the night. In the early
  morning darkness of his bedroom he felt desperately afraid of all that the
  coming day might bring, and when at last he fell asleep and dreamed, his
  dreams were of restless, inexplicable things.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap5"
     name="chap5">CHAPTER FIVE &mdash; FRIDAY MORNING AND AFTERNOON</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Unless on some definitely professional errand Howat always
  travelled in mufti. He did so quite openly, even sometimes when he went no
  further than Manchester, and though many of his colleagues in the town did
  not approve, the lay population were quite accustomed to seeing him dressed
  as one of themselves. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something about a parson&rsquo;s
  collar that puts people off,&rdquo; Howat had once said to Doxley, of the
  Congregational Church, &ldquo;especially in such a confined space as a
  railway compartment, where they have nothing to do but stare. It makes them
  uncomfortable among themselves, they feel under constraint with one
  another&mdash;they either talk at&rsquo; you, or else relapse into a brooding
  silence which you can feel to be anti-clerical. When I was a young fellow,
  just beginning, I used to wear the whitest and highest of clerical collars
  because I was so proud of my profession, but now I think I&rsquo;m less proud
  of that than I am of my common humanity. I feel that if I&rsquo;ve got to
  wear something that marks me out as different or superior to others, then in
  fairness to them I ought to travel first-class&mdash;like officers in the
  army.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But surely,&rdquo; Doxley had said, &ldquo;that argument would
  apply just as much against wearing the clerical habit at all, even in
  Browdley?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not quite. In Browdley, I&rsquo;m on business, as it were&mdash;my
  professional badge is as appropriate as a doctor&rsquo;s black bag or a
  collier&rsquo;s black face. But when I&rsquo;m shopping, say, in Manchester,
  or on holiday at the seaside, then I&rsquo;d feel as unseemly in my
  parson&rsquo;s rig-out as a judge if he had to play golf in his wig and
  gown.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean that when you&rsquo;re out of Browdley, you don&rsquo;t
  want people to know what you are?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see why I should fling my profession in their
  faces, anyhow.&rdquo; Doxley always put Howat in the impish mood of the small
  boy who knocks at doors and then runs away; he had added, then, with a touch
  of that impishness: &ldquo;I consider it an impertinence to approach
  strangers with a sort of label tied on to you saying&mdash;&rsquo; Beware!
  I&rsquo;m not an ordinary person like you&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And as the Reverend Jefferson Doxley had never for a moment believed
  himself to be an ordinary person like anyone else, the argument had here
  tapered away into an infinite shaft of disagreement. Doxley had, however,
  said one thing that Howat afterwards remembered. &ldquo;Well, Freemantle,
  whatever you say, you can&rsquo;t deny that a parson&rsquo;s collar does mean
  something to people; they look on it as a guarantee of character, even if
  they pretend to scoff at it. Take, for instance, the case of some timid,
  nervous girl walking alone along a country lane late at night. She sees a man
  approaching her in the distance, wonders who and what he is, begins to feel
  rather terrified, and then&mdash;suddenly&mdash;sees that collar. Don&rsquo;t
  you think it&rsquo;s a relief? She may be agnostic or an atheist or anything
  you like, but she knows she needn&rsquo;t be afraid of meeting a parson in
  the dark.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It seems a rather negative tribute to parsons in general,&rdquo;
  Howat had answered, still impishly. That conversation had taken place some
  half- dozen years before, since when Doxley had never wholly &lsquo;approved
  of&rsquo; his brother minister; he suspected him, indeed, of being
  dangerously imbued with eccentric, undignified, and even socialistic
  ideas.</p>

  <p>But now, on this Friday morning in November as the Manchester-London
  express raced over the plains of Northamptonshire, there could have seemed
  little eccentric, much less dangerous, in the quiet, tired-looking man who
  took lunch by himself at the far end of the dining-car. He had been sleeping
  for part of the journey, and there were lines beneath his eyes that made many
  a traveller, especially women, give him a fleetingly compassionate glance as
  they hurried along the centre aisle. There was something in his face that
  curiously attracted most people&mdash;a sort of rather sad winsomeness that
  made them feel they could rely on him for infinite depths of sympathy and
  understanding. Though, as a matter of fact, he did not always understand as
  well as they imagined; people often poured out intimate personal confessions
  to which his carefully kind attention was only a mask to cover up extreme
  uncomfortableness and a bewildered lack of comprehension.</p>

  <p>He took coffee and a cigarette after lunch (he only very rarely smoked,
  and never knew quite whether it gave him any pleasure or not); then he looked
  through the <i>Manchester Guardian</i>, and tried to interest himself in the
  passing scenes of the countryside; but soon his head was slipping forward
  again and he dozed fitfully till the train slowed down for the terminus.</p>

  <p>After leaving the train he walked to an hotel in Southampton Row, at which
  he had stayed on the occasion of his first overnight visit to London as a
  youth. It consisted of three adjacent Georgian houses, a good deal spoiled in
  the process of conversion into one establishment, and always smelling (more
  or less, according to the time of day) of cabbage and floor-polish. Its
  principal and perhaps only merits were that it was cheap (seven-and-six for
  bed-and- breakfast), respectable, and near the big northern railway
  stations.</p>

  <p>This last was an important consideration for Howat, who reckoned himself
  unable to afford cabs (he knew little about the prices of things and had
  never bothered to discover that London taxis were only half as expensive as
  those in Manchester and about a quarter the cost of hiring any sort of car in
  Browdley).</p>

  <p>Having lunched on the train, he had nothing to do at the hotel except book
  a room. They gave him a small low-ceilinged, top-floor apartment, overlooking
  the roof of a garage, sparingly but perhaps just adequately furnished for its
  purpose, with a shilling-in-the-slot gas-fire, and an electric light in the
  most difficult of all positions for either tying a tie or reading in bed.
  Howat hurriedly dumped down his bag; it was already two o&rsquo;clock (the
  train had been rather late); he must get along to those engineering people.
  In the hotel lobby as he descended, the proprietress called to him to sign
  the register; he did so, writing &lsquo;Howat Freemantle, Browdley,
  British&rsquo; in his usual clear script. He disliked the title
  &lsquo;Reverend&rsquo; and never used it of himself, though he could not
  prevent others doing so. He disliked it for a certain pretentiousness it
  seemed to have, just as he never much cared for the word &lsquo;study&rsquo;
  as applied to the room at home in which he worked.</p>

  <p>It was a fine day, fortunately, for it had been intermittently on his mind
  throughout the journey that he had forgotten to bring an umbrella. He boarded
  a bus outside the hotel and rode to Aldwych; then he changed to another bus
  and got down at Mansion House station. It was a quarter to three when he
  arrived at the showrooms and city headquarters of Neal &amp; Sons, Sanitary,
  Hydraulic, and Central Heating Engineers. In another hour and a quarter, he
  reflected, he would be arriving at Wimpole Street. Another hour and a quarter
  of uncertainty, followed, perhaps, by a certainty that would be even more
  dreadful. He felt his throat like something burning and malevolent that did
  not belong to him; he was sure now, with a sudden inward lurch of panic, that
  the verdict would be all that he had feared.. As he gave his name to the
  clerk in the outside office he heard his own voice as that of another man
  speaking; he wondered if he would be able to mobilise his wits for this
  earlier interview. The clerk ushered him through an inner office into the
  presence of a smartly dressed and very shining, voluble person who shook him
  eagerly by the hand, offered him an arm-chair, and proceeded to talk in a
  hearty way about the weather. &ldquo;And was it raining in Manchester when
  you came through this morning, Mr. Freemantle? Ha, Ha!&rdquo; The weather,
  politics, bad trade, and finally, as if with apologies that such an
  irrelevant thing should after all be mentioned, this question of a new
  heating apparatus.</p>

  <p>Howat sat back and wished that the chair were not such an easy chair; he
  was in grave danger of falling into a sleep, or at any rate, into a dream; he
  kept hearing the other man&rsquo;s voice and had to wonder whether he were
  still just talking or had begun to ask questions that demanded answers.
  &ldquo;Well, Mr. Freemantle, we could probably do you quite a satisfactory
  system for a hundred pounds or so&mdash;of course I couldn&rsquo;t give an
  exact quotation till our man has been up to see the place. I can assure you
  we&rsquo;re used to the job just take a look at this catalogue&mdash;it
  contains merely a few examples of churches and chapels throughout the country
  that have given us their heating contract...&rdquo; Howat fingered the
  smooth, glossy pages and had a misty vision of one church after
  another&mdash;plain-looking churches with oblong windows, elaborate- looking
  churches with stone facings and Gothic stained-glass, churches with stone
  crosses, churches without stone crosses, churches surrounded by a litter of
  schoolrooms and vestries, churches with turrets, cupolas, even (so it
  appeared) minarets, churches with machicolated towers, crocheted spires, and
  Ionic porticoes, churches enveloped by apparently tropical verdure, churches
  with the minister standing on the front step, churches of all sizes,
  denominations, architectures, and degrees of prosperity. It had hardly seemed
  possible that there could be so many churches in the world, and all, it
  appeared, were warmed by radiators supplied by Neal and Sons.</p>

  <p>Howat said at length: &ldquo;Well, yes, I think it will be all right. We
  shall be very glad to have your system.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can promise you, sir, that both you and your congregation will be
  well pleased with it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sure, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A good heating apparatus, sir, is half the battle, I always think.
  Warm your church well and people will flock into it. How can people worship
  when their feet are cold?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quite&mdash;oh, quite.&rdquo; At any other time Howat might have
  found it refreshing to talk to this enthusiastic young fellow, and even to
  discuss with him such vital matters as he had just touched upon; but as it
  was, he felt anxious at all costs to end the interview. He said:
  &ldquo;Perhaps, then, you&rsquo;ll get on with the job as soon as you can,
  eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The other seemed genuinely grieved by this display of haste. &ldquo;Would
  you care to step down into the basement, sir, and see the kind of
  installations we put in? We have a few models on view and we can also show
  you the apparatus that actually heats this office, and is heating it at the
  present moment&mdash;identical, of course, with the type we shall he
  supplying to you. I think you&rsquo;ll admit, sir, that the temperature of
  this room is just about what one would wish for.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Too hot, Howat thought sleepily&mdash;far too hot; but he said: &ldquo;Oh
  yes, just about right.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We can regulate it, of course. A single turn of the knob&mdash;like
  this&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat watched him rather sadly. Was it merely professional, such
  enthusiasm? Did the youth go home and dream about heating-apparatus? Did
  heating-apparatus fill a &rsquo;niche in his soul? Howat felt: I wish at this
  present moment I could believe in anything as fervently as this fellow seems
  to believe in these pipes and radiators...</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps, sir, you would care to come down and
  inspect&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat rose and shook his head sombrely. &ldquo;Well, no, I don&rsquo;t
  think I&rsquo;ll bother, if you don&rsquo;t mind. I&mdash;I have several
  other appointments this afternoon, and not much time left for them. Your
  apparatus, I have no doubt, will suit us admirably. I&rsquo;d better be
  getting along now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very good, sir. And when would it be convenient for us to send our
  man up to Browdley?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your man? Oh yes, about the pipes and things&mdash;yes&mdash;oh,
  any time next week would do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very good, Mr. Freemantle. We will advise you definitely by
  postcard. Good-bye, sir&mdash;very pleased indeed to have met you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And in another moment Howat was outside in the street again. It was nearly
  half-past three.</p>

  <p>He boarded a bus at the corner and rode past the Temple and Charing Cross
  and up Regent Street. By that time it was ten minutes to four, and at Oxford
  Circus he took to the pavements and began to thread his way diagonally into
  that stately district almost equally consecrated to music and medicine. He
  tried to think of the concert he might attend that evening, and of his more
  immediate rendezvous at Charing Cross at half-past five; but he hardly
  succeeded in either effort; a greater imminence was on him, a vertical
  barrier of time beyond which even futurity seemed scarcely to exist. He knew
  now that this interview with the specialist had been an unrealised background
  of all his thoughts and emotions for weeks. He felt beyond panic just numb
  with a secret, paralysing excitement of mind.</p>

  <p>It was a few minutes past the hour when he rang the bell beside the
  massive blue-enamelled door. He recalled the last time he had been there, ten
  years before, when his youngest boy had been discovered tubercular; it had
  been Blenkiron&rsquo;s partner then whom he had seen, and he had still a
  memory of the old man, and of his calm and somehow almost reassuring way of
  telling a father that his boy was seriously affected. He remembered coming
  out of the house with the boy&rsquo;s hand in his; they had walked aimlessly
  round a few corners, and had then had muffins for tea in a small caf, which
  he was sure he would never be able to find again, even if it still existed.
  Eighteen months after that, the boy had died.</p>

  <p>Now, he thought, waiting for the door to open, it was <i>his</i> turn. The
  door swung back; he gave his name to the maid; he was shown into the same
  room, with the same furnishings&mdash;exactly the same, they looked, despite
  the fact that the old man had died in the interval and his assistant- partner
  had succeeded to the practice. There was certainly the same ormolu clock on
  the mantelpiece and the same locked bookcase full of richly bound copies of
  Dickens, Thackeray, and Lord Lytton. Howat put his hat and gloves on the
  table with a gesture almost of familiarity, and the maid, as she left him,
  switched on a cluster of lights that hardly illumined the room so much as
  extinguished the fading daylight outside.</p>

  <p>The clock ticked on; and he knew, as he listened to it, that he was no
  longer nervous at all, but just calm, frozenly calm, and ready for whatever
  fate might send. Even the pain his his throat had merged into that all-
  enveloping numbness of sensation.</p>

  <p>The door opened, and there half-entered a man of rather more than middle-
  age, keen-faced and handsome in conventional morning-dress. He shook hands
  with Howat, and guided him into an inner room.</p>

  <p>Half an hour later the examination, which had been very thorough, was
  finished. Blenkiron sat in his swivel desk-chair, with his long fingers
  splayed out on the shining mahogany. He looked as if he could not quite
  decide how to begin. So far he had hardly spoken at all, except to ask
  questions. Howat faced him steadfastly from an armchair opposite; he was
  pale, excited, and twitching about the mouth as he sometimes did when he
  began sermons.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I understand, Mr. Freemantle,&rdquo; mused Blenkiron at length,
  &ldquo;that you decided to consult me because my late partner, Doctor
  Newsome, once examined your son?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. It was the only medical address in London I knew.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quite.&rdquo; A faint superciliousness edged round the
  doctor&rsquo;s clear&mdash;cut lips. &ldquo;And you have a great deal of
  faith, I suppose, in a London medical address?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps one has, rather naturally.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Blenkiron smiled and began to fidget with a brass paperweight.
  &ldquo;Well, well, I wonder whether one ought to say so&mdash;but it&rsquo;s
  a fact, you know, that there are some exceedingly clever doctors and surgeons
  in the provinces. Liverpool, Birmingham, Manchester&mdash;really, I could
  give you names in those cities, but of course I won&rsquo;t&mdash;dear me,
  no. It is a most gratifying and profitable superstition that the best medical
  brains in this country are all congregated in the region bounded by Oxford
  Street and the Marylebone Road. Only a superstition, of course, but I
  don&rsquo;t know what we doctors would do without it. I suppose you think
  that every brass plate in Wimpole Street and Harley Street means a fabulous
  income? Not at all&mdash;the superstition has shown signs of waning in recent
  years. Believe me, there are men in this road who can hardly find the cash
  for their quarterly telephone bills.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat nodded and wished he would get to the point. Doctors seemed to enjoy
  keeping their patients in suspense as long as possible&mdash;as a nerve test,
  perhaps? Blenkiron caught the impatient glance and went on: &ldquo;But these
  are digressions, are they not? By the way, Mr. Freemantle, how is your boy
  now? It was&mdash;let me see&mdash;what was the trouble exactly?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He died. It was consumption.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s bad, very bad. I didn&rsquo;t realise.&rdquo; He
  paused, apparently for deep thought, and then added: &ldquo;And I understand
  that you yourself are a clergyman in Browdley?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A minister&mdash;a Nonconformist minister.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the town, but I gather from the papers that
  trade has been very bad lately in that part of the country. I suppose cotton
  is the black spot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And coal? Have you any coal mines?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Several in the district.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;ve ever been down one, eh?
  You&rsquo;re just as bad as some of us Londoners. I had a titled person
  consulting me yesterday&mdash;I won&rsquo;t tell you his name, but he&rsquo;s
  very well known in politics&mdash;he confessed to me that he had never yet
  been inside the Tower of London. As I never had either, we were able to share
  the deep disgrace...However, that is rather by the by...Are you happy in your
  work in Browdley? Have you any particular worries&mdash;professional worries,
  I mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No more than most parsons, I should think.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You work hard, no doubt?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I try to.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. And you have to talk a good deal in public,
  that&rsquo;s rather inevitable, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is, I&rsquo;m afraid, yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll have to drop doing so much of it for a time. I
  don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;re surprised to hear me tell you that, eh?...Is
  your wife living?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And in good health?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fairly good. She&rsquo;s not strong, I&rsquo;m sorry to say.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And your children&mdash;have you any other children?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have a boy&mdash;in Canada&mdash;and a girl, who lives at
  home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They are both well?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The girl is. The boy&mdash;well, we haven&rsquo;t heard from him
  for several years.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Really? Perhaps he&rsquo;ll come romping home someday with his
  pockets bulging with banknotes. They do sometimes, you know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should be glad to see him whether his pockets were bulging or
  not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, of course...What would you do, though, if he did strike
  lucky and make you a present of a few thousand pounds? I suppose you&rsquo;d
  rebuild your church or something of the sort.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve never considered it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thought you clergymen always knew what to do with money?...But
  tell me now, coming back to the point, do you often have
  headaches?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fairly often.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And your eyes&mdash;have they been tested lately?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;About a year or so ago.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you enjoy your food?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Moderately.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Only moderately?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I ever was very keen on eating and
  drinking.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you an abstainer?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps that accounts for your not being keen on drinking, eh?
  Seriously, though, it&rsquo;s a pity you don&rsquo;t enjoy good food. Do you
  like corn on the cob?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I know what it is.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an American dish&mdash;they do it very well at
  Fouchard&rsquo;s, in Greek Street. It&rsquo;s something you oughtn&rsquo;t to
  miss during your visit to London. You eat it, you know, with your
  fingers&mdash;rather like playing a mouth organ. Very messy, but extremely
  palatable. I have a doctor friend who says that a great part of its value
  lies in the mode of eating&mdash;it satisfies the atavistic desire we all
  have, consciously or unconsciously, to take our food in our hands and tear it
  to pieces with our teeth. I wonder if that is really so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Howat, without wondering at all.</p>

  <p>Blenkiron gave the brass paperweight a little push to one side of the
  desk. &ldquo;Well, I expect you&rsquo;re waiting for me to tell you something
  about yourself. Of course the really hard problem in such a case as yours is
  not &lsquo;what&rsquo; but &lsquo;why&rsquo;. I must confess that for the
  last ten minutes I&rsquo;ve been puzzling myself over that...and I&rsquo;m
  not much nearer an answer. You&rsquo;ll have to knock off most things for a
  time, that&rsquo;s clear. I daresay you know that your nervous system
  isn&rsquo;t exactly a strong spot. But what prevented you from letting your
  own local doctor tell you so? As for your throat, I gather it&rsquo;s been
  causing you a fair amount of worry, lately?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It has, yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Which means, I suppose, that you&rsquo;ve been having the same
  worry that ninety-nine people out of every hundred have nowadays when they
  feel a pain. Oh, you needn&rsquo;t bother to confide in me&mdash;I know all
  about it. Even doctors aren&rsquo;t immune. I made a report on one the other
  day&mdash;a woman doctor&mdash;she suspected she had an internal carcinoma,
  but it turned out she was only going to have a baby. So you
  see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean, then, that there&rsquo;s <i>nothing wrong with
  me?</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear sir, there&rsquo;s a very great deal wrong with you. You
  are, I should say, within a very short distance of a serious nervous
  breakdown. But apart from that, which is quite bad enough, surely, I
  don&rsquo;t find anything much amiss&mdash;your heart and lungs are sound,
  you have a reasonable blood pressure, and as for the larynx&mdash;well,
  clergyman&rsquo;s sore throat is rather a vocational disease, isn&rsquo;t
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He went on to say a great deal more, but Howat did not hear him, and was
  hardly aware of the three pound notes that somehow escaped from his wallet
  and into the doctor&rsquo;s. The fee, in fact, was three guineas, but Howat
  forgot the odd shillings and Blenkiron did not remind him. Of that final
  handshake and the maid&rsquo;s guidance through the hall to the street-door
  Howat was almost totally unconscious; but the cold air awakened him when he
  found himself standing on the pavement outside the house, with his hat and
  gloves still in his hand and the street-lamps glittering like chains of gems
  in either direction. Beyond them, into the star-speckled sky loomed the tall
  grey houses, and a taxi came cruising slowly down that enchanted canyon.
  Howat raised his hand; the driver pulled up at the kerb; Howat sprang inside,
  without a word till the driver asked where he was to drive to; then Howat
  stammered&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, yes, of course&mdash;the main street, where the
  shops are&mdash;Oxford Street, yes&mdash;oh, anywhere...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He sat well forward on the seat and stared hard out of the window, as one
  who had somehow never used his eyes before. It did not even occur to him that
  he had never been in a London taxi before, so completely was that trivial
  novelty submerged in the vaster novelty of life itself. All the doubts and
  miseries of the last few months were lifted; the barrier was down, and life
  stretched ahead of him like a new dream, buoyant and zestful and rich in
  promise. He opened the window, despite the cold, and took in deep draughts of
  air that seemed to him purer than any he had ever breathed before; he could
  see a woman crossing the road with a pram and smiling at the baby inside it;
  there, over there, two men were standing at a corner reading the same
  newspaper and laughing; in the middle of the road a night-watchman slowly
  filled his pipe as he settled himself beside a brazier-fire. And suddenly,
  with a little swirl, the taxi turned out of that lovely tributary into the
  full tide of the river itself, that blazing river of shops and omnibuses and
  skysigns&mdash;Oxford Street. &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; he shouted through the
  window on the driver&rsquo;s side, and then sank back amidst the cushions
  with glorious exhaustion.</p>

  <p>The cab soon became embedded in a long line of slow-moving traffic, and he
  thought, during those moments, that he had never seen anything in the world
  so truly lovely as that pageant of shop-windows and eager happy faces. There
  was one window full of gorgeously tinted silks, slung rainbow-like from
  corner to corner, and there was a shop that had a machine in the window that
  twisted skeins of toffee together, and a sky-sign, high up above, that gave
  the weather forecast in scampering electric letters, and a huge shop-building
  with a frontage of Ionic columns silver-white in the upward glow of
  arc-lamps, and people, people&mdash;hundreds and thousands of them in one
  long, throbbing, colourful fresco of life itself.</p>

  <p>And the loveliness was in his ears as well&mdash;he heard the clamour of
  motor-horns and the shouting of newsboys and all the mingled noises of
  streets and houses like some triumphant symphony on a new theme; he wanted to
  join in it, to lean his head out of the window and shout to someone in sheer
  exultation; and then he thought: Steady, Steady&mdash;keep
  calmer&mdash;you&rsquo;ve got a happy evening before you&mdash;there&rsquo;s
  that concert&mdash;have you forgotten it? They&rsquo;re playing Brahms...and
  all at once, with that little twist of recollection, his mind was flooded
  with imagined melody, and he saw himself, as in those ridiculous boyhood
  dreams, standing on a conductor&rsquo;s rostrum, baton in hand, controlling a
  world of his own creation.</p>

  <p>There were trees now, iron railings, vistas of glittering headlights, and
  a faint smell of wood-smoke on the air; then he caught sight of a
  clock&mdash;twenty-five past five&mdash;and suddenly remembered that business
  at Charing Cross. His spirits fell momentarily at the thought, but rose again
  almost instantly and with new intensity, for his imagination transformed him
  magically from the conductor of an orchestra into an orator of burning zeal,
  a Peter the Hermit and Savonarola combined, whose impassioned pleadings no
  sinner could hope to resist. He was certain now that he would meet that girl,
  talk to her, convince her, and have her returning to Browdley that very
  night; there was no longer any doubt about it; he could not fail with this
  new and god-like strength that was in him. He put his head out of the window
  and called to the driver&mdash;&rdquo; Charing Cross&mdash;the post
  office&mdash;as quick as you can!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was beginning to be the evening &lsquo;rush&rsquo; period, and the taxi
  was held up many times, at the Marble. Arch, at Berkeley Street, and for
  several minutes at Piccadilly Circus. It was nearly a quarter to six when
  Howat stepped to the pavement at the corner of Trafalgar Square; he was
  rather excited by that time; perhaps she hadn&rsquo;t come, or had got tired
  of waiting; he paid the driver, adding a far too lavish tip, and found
  him-self staring vacantly at buses and sky-signs and a pavement
  artist&rsquo;s drawings of Ramsay MacDonald and Lloyd George; it was an
  absurd place, he reflected, as he became conscious of the crowds all about
  him, to have fixed for meeting anyone, especially someone he didn&rsquo;t
  know very well.</p>

  <p>He had been staring about for several minutes when he felt a hand touching
  his arm. He looked round and saw a girl, and though he knew immediately that
  it was Elizabeth Garland, he was certain he would never have recognised her
  of his own accord. Really, it was as if he had never seen her before.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap6"
     name="chap6">CHAPTER SIX &mdash; FRIDAY TEA</a></h2>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;Good evening, Mr. Freemantle,&rdquo; she said, in a
  slow soft- toned voice (it was as if, too, he had never heard it before), and
  he said &ldquo;Good evening&rdquo; and observed her rather incredulously. A
  certain sense of the extraordinariness of the situation came over him, and
  with a little effort he made himself recollect how matters stood&mdash;he a
  Browdley parson meeting a young girl at Charing Cross to persuade her not to
  run away to Paris with an elderly Jew with a bald head and gold teeth (he
  could not unfix that graphic picture from his mind). But the picture gave him
  renewed and indignant confidence; by God, he thought, glancing at her again,
  she mustn&rsquo;t do a thing like that; it would be worse than an offence
  against morals, it would be&mdash;and then he checked himself and wondered
  what <i>could</i> be worse than an offence against morals? Dimly he felt that
  something could be, and the feeling, obscure and transient, linked itself
  with all the new and astonishing perceptions that were invading him from all
  directions. By God, no, she mustn&rsquo;t; he must prevent her, at all costs.
  And, as earnestly as he had ever prayed for anything, he prayed, wordlessly,
  for strength to achieve that end.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I got your letter,&rdquo; she was saying, returning his glance with
  one just as curious. &ldquo;It was nice of you to think of meeting me. Are
  you in London for long?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I go back to-morrow. Just a business visit. I&rsquo;m afraid I must
  have kept you waiting a long time&mdash;the traffic delayed me. What a crowd
  there is here!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she agreed. They were still standing exactly where they
  had met, on the edge of the pavement, surrounded by eddies of omnibuses,
  cabs, and pedestrians. &ldquo;Have you had tea?&rdquo; she continued.
  &ldquo;Because if not we might find it quieter inside a caf.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, a good idea.&rdquo; He had forgotten all about tea himself and
  was relieved by the suggestion. It would be easier, no doubt, than talking in
  the streets. There was a Lyons tea-shop within a few yards of them, and they
  made their way to it, finding a couple of scats at a small table in a corner
  of a first-floor room. In the sudden brilliance of electric lights his eyes
  were dazzled at first, but as soon as he could see her clearly again he felt
  indignation and determination rising in him to fever-point&mdash;she must
  not, must not, do a thing like that&mdash;it was monstrous, a sin more
  certainly a sin than anything he could ever have imagined. He wondered how he
  should broach the matter, whether directly or by oblique remarks; or whether,
  during tea, he had better let the talk remain just casual. But it was she who
  left him no choice, for she said, almost straightway: &ldquo;Did you give my
  message at home, Mr. Freemantle?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Then he
  went on, slowly and with not half the fluency he had hoped for: &ldquo;The
  fact is, you don&rsquo;t seem to realise what&mdash;what a commotion you have
  caused by&mdash;by leaving home like this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has there been such a terrible fuss?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, naturally. What else could you have expected? Your parents
  are both extremely upset, and I would gladly have conveyed your message if I
  had thought it would relieve their minds at all. Unfortunately it seemed to
  me quite likely to make matters worse, which was why&mdash;or one of the
  reasons why, at any rate&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t do as you suggested.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean that they wouldn&rsquo;t have been relieved to learn that
  I&rsquo;m all right and quite happy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s not quite the way to put it. You must remember
  how deeply you have hurt their pride as well as their affections. I saw your
  father the other day, and I found him in a very angry mood about you. After
  all, you can understand that, I&rsquo;m sure. He feels you have disgraced
  him. But I still think it possible&mdash;even probable&mdash;that if you were
  to go back now, immediately, giving up all&mdash;all that you have in
  mind&mdash;they would be reasonable with you. At least I can promise that I
  would do my best to smooth matters over.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very kind indeed of you, Mr. Freemantle, but really,
  you know, I haven&rsquo;t the slightest intention of going back. You
  mustn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m repentant or anything like that. I&rsquo;d like
  to be on good terms with them if it&rsquo;s possible&mdash;that&rsquo;s why I
  wrote to you&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t alter my plans.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He faced her solemnly for a long moment and then said: &ldquo;I hope you
  realise that unless you do go back, your parents arc quite determined to have
  nothing more to do with you&mdash;ever.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose if they take up that rather silly attitude,
  I&rsquo;ll have to make the best of it, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Make the best of it and go back?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. Make the best of it and stay away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She spoke so calmly that he just stared at her in amazement and then
  replied: &ldquo;You really mean that&mdash;quite finally?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, of course. I do Hope you haven&rsquo;t made a special journey
  here just to try to argue me round.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no&mdash;not at all.&rdquo; He seemed tremendously eager to
  convince her of that. &ldquo;Oh no, you see, I had to come to London to make
  arrangements for a new heating apparatus we are having installed in the
  chapel&mdash;it was just an idea of mine that, since you were in London also,
  we might meet and talk things over. I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;re so
  determined&mdash;I had hoped, you see&mdash;&rdquo; And all the time he was
  stammering these and similar things, he felt: You&rsquo;ve failed,
  You&rsquo;ve bungled it all, You can do nothing with her! Where&rsquo;s that
  marvellous eloquence you were going to employ? You&rsquo;re no use, and why,
  in Heaven&rsquo;s name, should you ever have imagined you could be? Does
  anybody decide on a course of action as important as hers is and then give it
  up because a parson comes along with a few tea-table platitudes? And
  suddenly, with a new note in his voice, he leaned towards her across the
  table and began to speak, not with his usual easy flow of words, but in
  sharp, broken sentences and in a voice husky with disappointment: &ldquo;My
  dear girl, I&rsquo;m not preaching at you&mdash;don&rsquo;t think
  that&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want you to think I&rsquo;m talking to you as a
  parson just, shall we say, as a friend&mdash;a friend rather older than
  you&mdash;though even that I won&rsquo;t plead too strongly, because in some
  ways I&rsquo;m nearly as much a stranger to life as you are. Perhaps you
  don&rsquo;t know what I mean by that&mdash;well, never mind, it doesn&rsquo;t
  matter&mdash;it&rsquo;s a side issue. What I feel is that I want to talk to
  you&mdash;perhaps impertinently, in a way&mdash;I want to tell you how this
  course that you&rsquo;re taking strikes me, as a complete outsider.
  It&rsquo;s difficult, really, for me to express what I mean; I don&rsquo;t
  want to bring in the question of morals; I&rsquo;d rather put it to you as a
  matter of wisdom&mdash;after all, you probably believe in wisdom&mdash;you
  don&rsquo;t look at all the sort of person to act recklessly, without
  thinking things out beforehand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought out everything beforehand, I assure
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know, I expected you to say that. All the same, there are times
  when one&rsquo;s thoughts aren&rsquo;t very reliable, when imagination loses
  its proper perspective, runs riot, as it were&mdash;do you know what I mean?
  It&rsquo;s like all this new mathematics&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been reading a book
  about it lately. Normally we live in a Euclidian sort of world&mdash;straight
  lines, everything very logical, just the ordinary life that we all grow
  accustomed to&mdash;then, suddenly, without any warning, something gets hold
  of us and we go switching over into an Einstein world full of curved space
  and parallel lines that do meet in the end&mdash;all very marvellous and
  perhaps truer, in a way, than the other sort of world, but we can&rsquo;t
  afford to think so, because it wouldn&rsquo;t work. All I want is for you to
  ask yourself whether what you are going to do will work&mdash;will it be a
  practical success&mdash;will it&mdash;will it&mdash;do you&mdash;are you
  going to&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped abruptly and continued, after a pause and
  with a slight smile: &ldquo;I wonder if you really understand what I&rsquo;m
  talking about?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think I probably do,&rdquo; she answered cautiously,
  &ldquo;though I&rsquo;m puzzled to know why you&rsquo;re talking about
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because I <i>must</i>, whether I offend you or not. To be quite
  frank, this man whom you know, whom you&rsquo;re proposing to go to Paris
  with&mdash;is he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her eyes widened incredulously. &ldquo;A <i>man?</i>&rdquo; she
  interrupted. &ldquo;What man? And you say I&rsquo;m going to Paris with him?
  Really&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t be offended. As I told you at the beginning, I
  don&rsquo;t intend to preach&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She suddenly laughed. &ldquo;But, Mr. Freemantle, it&rsquo;s all so
  utterly ridiculous! Oh, how absurd it is!&rdquo; She laughed again, a little
  helplessly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine how you got hold of such an idea.
  There&rsquo;s no man at all. I&rsquo;m not going with anybody.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean to say it&rsquo;s all untrue? You&rsquo;re not going to
  Paris with&mdash;with that man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am going abroad, certainly, but not with that man, or any man.
  And not, incidentally, to Paris, either. But I wish you&rsquo;d tell me who
  that man is. I&rsquo;m quite curious about him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His eyes, watching her and her amusement, half-filled with tears, he did
  not know why, and all the world around him seemed drowned in the most
  shattering and unspeakable loveliness. &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what
  to say,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m only going by all the
  talk in Browdley; how people find everything out I can&rsquo;t think.
  Someone, I believe, saw you getting into the train at Manchester with this
  man&mdash;a musician, I understood&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her laughing was almost hysterical now. &ldquo;Oh, poor Isaac&mdash;how
  funny he&rsquo;d think it all if he knew! He plays the fiddle at a cinema in
  Manchester; he&rsquo;s married and has three children, I think&mdash;or
  perhaps four. He&rsquo;s a dear old man, and a very great friend of mine. He
  saw me off at the station because I had a lot of luggage to handle, and
  before the train started we sat in the compartment together and talked. I
  suppose that must have been when people saw us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat could only stammer: &ldquo;You must forgive me, forgive
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, of course, if there were anything to forgive. It&rsquo;s
  Browdley that&rsquo;s to blame, not you. Anyhow, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. It
  all makes me rather more determined that ever not to go back.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going back? You still say that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Still? Why do you think I ought to change my mind?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;except that I&rsquo;m sure that
  your parents, now that this horrible story turns out to be untrue&mdash;would
  be very glad&mdash;very glad indeed&mdash;to have you back.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that they would, and in any case, I
  wouldn&rsquo;t be glad at all. You don&rsquo;t seem to realise that I
  don&rsquo;t want to go back. I&rsquo;ve got all sorts of other plans.
  I&rsquo;m going to Vienna to study music. Didn&rsquo;t you hear that?
  Weren&rsquo;t there any true rumours flying about?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Music?</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They stared at each other across the table amidst a curiously fateful
  silence. She continued, with sudden eagerness: &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so
  pleased we&rsquo;ve cleared up all that stupid misunderstanding&mdash;we can
  talk to each other now just as I&rsquo;ve wanted to for a long time. I was
  often on the point of telling you during those German lessons, but you never
  gave me the least encouragement&mdash;I had an impression you weren&rsquo;t
  interested in me and my affairs. But you&rsquo;re different now&mdash;I can
  see that&mdash;I suppose it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re out of Browdley.
  Anyhow, I must tell you all about it now that we&rsquo;re here together. Do
  you mind?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At first she had been aloof, baffling, cordial but on the defensive; now,
  however, the armour dropped and a warm friendliness took its place and made
  him exclaim: &ldquo;Mind? Good heavens, no! I want to be told the whole
  story&mdash;especially about the music. I&rsquo;m rather interested in music
  myself, but I&rsquo;d no idea you were. What is it, the piano?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, the fiddle. I&rsquo;ve always been keen, ever since I was a
  child. There was a fiddle at our house that used to belong to an uncle of
  mine who died, and I taught myself to play on that. I never had any lessons
  at first; my father didn&rsquo;t believe in that sort of thing. As a matter
  of fact, though perhaps you&rsquo;ll smile and won&rsquo;t believe it, I have
  an idea he thought all music, except hymn tunes and funeral marches, rather
  irreligious.&rdquo; Howat certainly did smile, and she went on, as though
  encouraged: &ldquo;When I was fifteen I wanted to earn a living somehow or
  other, so I got a job in the town library&mdash;the usual graft, you know,
  father being a Councillor. It wasn&rsquo;t at all a bad job, and it gave me a
  chance of reading all sorts of books as well as studying music in my spare
  time. As soon as I could afford it I began having lessons from Isaac in
  Manchester&mdash;his real name&rsquo;s Isaacstein, but everybody calls him
  Isaac&mdash;I used to go once a week till he said he&rsquo;d give me two
  lessons for the same money. He&rsquo;s really been awfully kind and generous,
  and he&rsquo;s quite a marvellous teacher. I wish you knew him. Well, all
  this has been going on now for some years; I&rsquo;ve been improving my
  playing, I think, and I must admit I&rsquo;ve been fairly happy all the time,
  only&mdash;only&mdash;&rdquo; Her fluency ceased, and she gave him a queer
  abrupt smile across the table. &ldquo;Only it isn&rsquo;t any longer enough
  to satisfy me. I could never get anyone to realise that, except Isaac.
  It&rsquo;s really not much use, is it, being fairly comfortable in what
  you&rsquo;re doing, if there&rsquo;s something else you want so dreadfully
  that you&rsquo;re willing to put up with all the discomforts in the world for
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know. I think I can understand that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how I feel about music. It&rsquo;s probably quite
  ridiculous of me, but I don&rsquo;t care&mdash;other people are constantly
  doing things which I think ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a difficult profession, of course.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know that. I&rsquo;m prepared for all sorts of hardships, because
  I&rsquo;m so certain in my own mind that they could never make me as unhappy
  as staying at home in Browdley. Besides, though it may seem a conceited thing
  to say, there is something in me. Musically, I mean. Even Isaac thinks there
  is. If I give myself a chance I might, some day, do something worth doing.
  Haven&rsquo;t you ever felt like that about anything?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He did not answer, but said, instead: &ldquo;What I&rsquo;m rather
  puzzling over is why you didn&rsquo;t tell all this to your parents before
  you left. It seems such a pity to have needlessly quarrelled with
  them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But there was no quarrel&mdash;not on my side, at any rate. I told
  them I was going to live abroad, and I was quite ready and willing to give
  them the fullest details about it, but they wouldn&rsquo;t listen. I believe
  I did tell them a few things, but they obviously didn&rsquo;t believe me.
  When I saw it was no use talking to them any more, I just went to bed, packed
  up my things during the night, and caught the first train in the
  morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that rather precipitate?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What else could I have done? They wouldn&rsquo;t believe me or even
  listen. They never understood how I could be so keen on music, and I
  don&rsquo;t think they ever believed that when I went to Manchester so often
  in the evenings it was only for fiddle lessons. Recently, too, I&rsquo;ve
  been doing most of my practising in Manchester, in a room belonging to a
  music-shop, because they didn&rsquo;t like the noise of it at home. Of course
  it is rather an awful noise sometimes, I admit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It seems a pity, though, that you couldn&rsquo;t have convinced
  them that it was all quite genuine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I often tried, I assure you. But in the end I just had to give up
  bothering. After all, if people <i>want</i> to think things of that
  sort...&rdquo; She shrugged her shoulders and added: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
  you must think me very cool and ruthless about it. I dare-say you&rsquo;d
  understand better if you knew my parents.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He said, more gently: &ldquo;I do know them, a little. I can understand
  they were not very&mdash;sympathetic...Now tell me, what&rsquo;s given you
  this idea of going to Vienna?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I want to join a school there. Isaac says it&rsquo;s the best
  school in Europe, except one in Berlin, which I couldn&rsquo;t afford. Ail
  sorts of people attend the classes&mdash;men and women of all ages and from
  all countries. I have to pass a kind of entrance examination first of all,
  but Isaac says I&rsquo;ll do that quite easily.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has this Mr. Isaacstein&mdash;is that it?&mdash;has he been
  encouraging you in all these ideas?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. He says, as you say, that it&rsquo;s a fearfully hard
  profession, and that I&rsquo;m taking a big risk in giving up home and a job.
  But he likes my playing, all the same, and thinks there&rsquo;s about a
  hundred to one chance that I&rsquo;ll turn out pretty good.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A hundred to one in your favour?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&rsquo;No, against me, of course.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t sound very optimistic.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t optimistic, he just means everything he
  says.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And, assuming he&rsquo;s correct, are you satisfied with such a
  chance?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to be, haven&rsquo;t I? It&rsquo;s either that or no
  chance at all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What exactly will you do in this school?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Play the fiddle every day for hours and hours. Have
  lessons&mdash;perhaps from somebody of importance if I&rsquo;m lucky.
  Eventually, if the hundred to one chance comes off, I&rsquo;ll begin giving
  recitals.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Even that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean success. There are scores
  of recitalists one never hears of.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I know. And you know, too, apparently. We both know.&rdquo; She
  laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ve carefully looked into the financial side of
  it all?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So carefully and so often that I know it by heart. I can live in
  Vienna&mdash;not luxuriously, of course, but then I wouldn&rsquo;t want
  to&mdash;on a hundred and fifty or so a year. Living&rsquo;s a little cheaper
  than it is in England. At the end of six months, if I show promise, the
  school may grant me a scholarship, and I might also be able to get a few
  outside pupils. I&rsquo;ve saved up exactly a hundred and eighty-seven pounds
  during the past six years, so I can afford at least twelve months at the
  school, even as an experiment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What if the experiment doesn&rsquo;t succeed?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll at least know that I&rsquo;ve had the chance and
  failed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You may find yourself back in England penniless and without a
  job.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Possibly. But I&rsquo;ll manage somehow&mdash;I can typewrite and
  do shorthand, card-indexing, and all that sort of thing. I shan&rsquo;t need
  to go back to Browdley.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s taking a big plunge.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re not afraid of doing it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m more afraid of not doing it. I&rsquo;d be afraid of
  looking back when I&rsquo;m older and wishing I&rsquo;d had the nerve when I
  was young.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat rose abruptly from his chair, picking up the bill that the waitress
  had placed on the table. &ldquo;Shall we go?&rdquo; he said, smiling.
  &ldquo;By the way, where are you staying in London?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;With friends in South Kensington. Till to-morrow. I&rsquo;m off in
  the morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To Vienna?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s the middle of term, but I think they&rsquo;ll
  probably let me begin. If not, I&rsquo;ll just wait there till next
  term.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He paid the bill downstairs and walked with her into the street. The
  crowds and traffic had not noticeably subsided in the interval. He reached
  the kerbside with her; they had neither of them spoken since leaving the
  shop; and he thought, as he stood there: Shall I say good-bye and wish her
  luck, or shall I continue an argument that hasn&rsquo;t the slightest chance
  of making her alter a single one of her intentions? Finally he adopted
  neither course, but said, altogether on impulse: &ldquo;It just occurs to me
  that I&rsquo;m feeling hungry. I haven&rsquo;t had anything to eat since my
  lunch on the train this morning. What about your own plans? Are you doing
  anything particular this evening?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There was a violin concert I wanted to go to.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The one at the Cavendish?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. How did you know?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I saw it advertised and rather thought of going myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s go together after we&rsquo;ve had some food
  somewhere.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That sounds a very happy suggestion.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know a place in Soho, quite good and not expensive.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Splendid. We&rsquo;ll go there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s near Regent Street. If you&rsquo;re hungry we&rsquo;d
  better take a bus and go there now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They crossed the road and waited for a Regent Street bus, but it was full
  inside and they had to climb to the roof, which was open to the sky and the
  cold wind. Yet something in that arctic elevation gave all Howat&rsquo;s
  perceptions a renewal of acuteness; once again he was caught up in swirls and
  eddies of enchantment, and as he felt her small tense body at his side, he
  knew that finding out the real truth about her had set a dizzying crown upon
  his happiness. She was pure and good; that was everything; and her purity
  merged with the new hopefulness of his own future into a single celestial
  harmony. He could not be quite sure how it all fitted in, but he felt, during
  that short tingling journey: There is nothing wrong with me, in the way I
  feared, and there is nothing wrong with her, in the way I feared. We are both
  all right, and the whole world is all right...and the more he thought about
  it, the more marvellous that simple discovery seemed to him. In the
  ever-changing pattern of lamplight he observed her profile, the delicate
  little chin cushioned serenely in the fur collar, the bold slope of the
  forehead under the close fitting hat&mdash;it was a pure profile, he thought,
  matching her in other ways, too&mdash;it looked so eager, intent, and not to
  be deflected. There was something in the way she stared ahead that put him in
  mind of a rather lovely figurehead of a ship.</p>

  <p>But he still felt it somehow his duty to persuade her to return to
  Browdley, even though he knew the futility of the attempt. The Vienna idea
  seemed to him quite hopelessly impractical; even her friend Isaac had not
  been encouraging. Howat felt that he ought, at least, to stress the
  uncertainty of it, the risks of ultimate disappointment and failure. On the
  other hand, he reflected, she knew all the risks quite as well as he did; she
  was walking into them with her eyes open; and then, glancing towards her
  momentarily, he saw her as the living symbol of an attitude&mdash;that
  attitude of knowing and taking risks with eyes wide open. And it was an
  attitude which suddenly, by sheer loveliness of appeal, broke down his last
  misgiving, so that he said, there on that bus-top, just the opposite of what
  he felt he ought to say and just the essence of what he felt; he said,
  stooping a little to her: &ldquo;My dear girl, I&rsquo;m going to give you
  some advice which may rather surprise you. You go. Go to Vienna. Take your
  chance. Work hard, and may God be with you and reward your
  courage!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She turned to him with a look of eager, startled friendliness, clutching
  his arm meanwhile like an excited child. &ldquo;Thank you&mdash;thank you
  very much,&rdquo; she said simply, and he responded&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, no,
  no&mdash;&rdquo; and held her gloved fingers for a fraction of a moment in
  his cold hand. Her instant response to his benediction had filled him with
  overmastering ease of mind; he had done right, he was certain now, and he
  could even feel a touch of that priestly serenity he had so often imagined
  and envied. &ldquo;But I <i>do</i> thank you,&rdquo; she insisted, and he
  could only repeat-"-Oh no, not at all...&rdquo; His head was full of a divine
  singing, and all he could think of again was the astonishing rightness of
  himself, herself; and of all the world.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap7"
     name="chap7">CHAPTER SEVEN &mdash; FRIDAY DINNER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">She had said the Soho restaurant was not expensive; but it
  was, in fact, like most Soho restaurants, cheap if you picked out the very
  cheapest things, but fairly expensive to the person who asked for just what
  he wanted. Howat, sitting down at the small table and studying the bill of
  fare, did not feel in any mood to make intricate mathematical calculations.
  He was never very competent with money; if he had been alone he would
  doubtless have had eggs on toast in a Lyons shop for cheapness&rsquo; sake;
  but, on the other hand, if Lyons had grossly overcharged him he would never
  have noticed it. So that, though he stared hard at the items on
  Barroli&rsquo;s comprehensive list, they conveyed little to his
  understanding&mdash;three and six for <i>poulet en casserole</i> seemed to
  him neither more nor less outrageous than a hundred pounds for a heating
  apparatus. Nor, apart from the prices, did he peruse very intelligently; he
  knew French, but to know French is not always to know the identities of
  dishes in a Soho restaurant owned by an Italian. Two things, however,
  supervened immensely above all his perceptions; he was hungry, and the world
  still retained its extraordinary attributes of perfection. As he gazed about
  he could not have conceived any restaurant pleasanter than the one whose
  interior surrounded him; he liked its touch of old-fashionedness, its red
  plush benches and baroque decorations; he liked the red-shaded table-lamp
  near his elbow, and the French and Italian newspapers on wooden frames that
  lay about; he liked the quick-moving and slightly shabby waiters, the
  smallness and easygoingness of the place, and the fact that at two tables
  nearest his own two different gentlemen were dining, the one, in full evening
  dress, with a lady, and the other, alone, in a very exuberant plus-fours.</p>

  <p>In truth, it was just an average sort of place, better than some and not
  so good as others; its chief title to distinction, among a limited circle
  being an attractive kind of egg-nog made with sherry.</p>

  <p>He said, across the table: &ldquo;Remember now, this is a little farewell
  dinner in celebration of your Vienna adventure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She smiled, and looking at her as she did so, he wondered how it had been
  possible for her to come to him for those lessons week after week without his
  noticing her more particularly. In the glow of the table-lamp he saw a rather
  pale oval face with a slender nose, longer than average, and a decidedly
  small mouth&mdash;like an Italian picture, he thought suddenly, and then,
  remembering the Raphael Saint Catherine, he said: &ldquo;Oh, by the way,
  thanks for the picture you sent me. I liked it very much.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hoped you would. I felt I had to send you something, however
  trivial, in return for your kindness to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>My</i> kindness to you?&rdquo; As always, he was bewildered by
  the notion that he had ever been particularly kind to anybody.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; she answered, spiritedly. &ldquo;You worked
  hard with my German, and you were always so patient. I did appreciate it,
  though I had an impression you didn&rsquo;t appreciate me. I rather came to
  the conclusion that I bored you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you didn&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You always would keep so strictly to the subject&mdash;I so often
  wanted to have a real talk with you about other things, but you froze me
  up.&rdquo; She laughed. &ldquo;How absurd it is to be telling you all this
  now!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He laughed also. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather odd as well as amusing,
  considering my daughter&rsquo;s opinion of me as a teacher. Sometimes, you
  know, I visit the school and take her class for a chance hour or so. She says
  I wander about from one subject to another in a most distracting way, that I
  never teach the children anything, and that I undermine her discipline by
  making them laugh too much.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That sounds utterly delightful.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not from her point of view, though. She has to prepare them for
  examinations.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, anyhow, I can&rsquo;t join her in complaining about you. You
  certainly taught me German all right and I don&rsquo;t think you made me
  laugh at all&mdash;not even once.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Probably because I was being paid for the job. A sort of
  fundamental honesty urging me to give the utmost value for money.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They both laughed again, but in the background he was searching his memory
  for some clue to that earlier attitude; how was it, once again, that he had
  never noticed her particularly during those German lessons? He remembered
  how, when she had first approached him about giving them, he had wondered who
  she was, for the moment, and would have made some excuse for declining had
  she not revealed herself as his chapel secretary&rsquo;s daughter. Even after
  accepting, he had felt a little doubtful; he hadn&rsquo;t cared for the idea
  of giving private lessons to young girls...But the waiter&rsquo;s approach
  cut short such tangled recollections; it was more important now to decide
  what to eat.</p>

  <p>A moment later, when the waiter had left them after taking the order, they
  intercepted each other&rsquo;s glances and smiled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just
  thinking how extraordinary it is for you and me to be here, aren&rsquo;t
  you?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I was. But so many extraordinary things have been happening to
  me to-day. One of them, for instance, happened just before I met you. I went
  to see a specialist, thinking I might have something rather serious the
  matter with me, and he told me it was all nerves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you delighted?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, altogether. I felt like a condemned prisoner who&rsquo;s been
  give a reprieve and a free pardon all at the same moment. I still feel rather
  like that. I left the doctor&rsquo;s place soon after a quarter to five, I
  suppose it was, and I hardly know what I did between then and seeing you. I
  remember getting into a taxi and being driven along Oxford Street. I never
  ride in taxis as a rule. For that matter, I never dine alone with young
  ladies in Soho restaurants. If I could see myself now from the outside, I
  daresay I should think I&rsquo;d gone completely crazy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Having left the Euclid world and passed into the
  Einstein&mdash;that was your own simile, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He looked across at her then with a curious, tranquil admiration. She was
  clever; she could seize a point; she had an alertness of mind that perfectly
  matched the alertness of her eyes and bearing. Trevis had the same kind of
  alertness, dimmed, though, by physical suffering; Ringwood had a touch of it,
  but in him it was rougher, less clarified. Only in her did this quality which
  he liked so much seem brought almost to perfection.</p>

  <p>She went on: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad it was nothing seriously wrong. As a
  matter of fact, I had noticed you looking ill lately. I suppose you were
  worrying?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, frightfully.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think you work far too hard in Browdley. Didn&rsquo;t the doctor
  tell you you had to take a rest?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I believe he did. D&rsquo;you know, I hardly remember what he did
  tell me, except that I hadn&rsquo;t got what I thought I had. I believe he
  forbade me to speak in public again for a long time&mdash;it was my throat,
  you see, that was the bother&mdash;and I rather think he talked about a
  nervous breakdown. A breakdown! Do I look like it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not now, but you may when you get back to Browdley. I think you
  probably will. I don&rsquo;t know how you can ever stand the place. You must
  be so unhappy.&rdquo; She spoke that last word with a rather scared glance,
  as if it had arrived too impulsively to be checked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Unhappy?</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, yes. Of course it&rsquo;s always difficult to imagine oneself
  in someone else&rsquo;s place, but I always feel&mdash;I always have
  felt&mdash;that if I were you I should be terribly unhappy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Unhappy!&rdquo; he echoed again, but not interrogatively this time.
  He was so happy at that moment that the mere conception of being otherwise
  evaded him till, with a strong effort of imagination, he pictured Browdley,
  the Browdley he would be returning to on the morrow, its narrow streets of
  slums leading from the railway station to the Manse, the factory
  overshadowing the chapel, the little rooms in all the little houses that he
  visited.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she suggested, again with a scared glance,
  &ldquo;because I feel that you try for so much, and must so often be
  disappointed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He said: &ldquo;Ah yes, but it isn&rsquo;t all disappointment, you know.
  And whether it is or not, I have to do it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You feel about it as I feel about music? That you must do it,
  whatever happens? You never have any doubts?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I ever had any when I was your age, anyhow.
  Perhaps when one reaches middle life, it isn&rsquo;t natural to be as certain
  of things.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have doubts, then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only of my own usefulness. It doesn&rsquo;t seem quite so
  inevitable that I shall convert the world as it did when I first left
  college.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you want to convert the world?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say I do&mdash;now. I&rsquo;ll be satisfied with
  doing a certain amount of good in Browdley.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Giving up the big ambitions?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think doing a certain amount of good in Browdley is
  a big ambition? I do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, so do I, but&mdash;&rdquo; The waiter came with soup, and the
  interruption broke the sequence of discussion. &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; she said
  afterwards, with a smile, &ldquo;you must think I&rsquo;m terribly
  impertinent, cross-examining you like this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not so impertinent as I was to you a little while ago, I&rsquo;m
  sure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>that?</i>&rdquo; She laughed. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind my
  being amused by it, do you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m relieved that you can be.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t you think it was rather funny?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps...&rdquo; And he laughed, with an effort at first, and then
  spontaneously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was such an odd way of getting to know you,&rdquo; she went on.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;d imagined all sorts of ways, but none in the least like that.
  Yes, I <i>had</i> imagined all sorts of ways. As a matter of fact, I&rsquo;d
  been really wanting to know you ever since I heard you give an address on
  William Blake&mdash;two years ago, it must have been. Usually I hate literary
  talks, they&rsquo;re so artificial, and gushing, and speakers always quote
  the tags that you privately don&rsquo;t think much of&mdash;but you were
  different. You were rather queer, in a way. You talked totally above the
  heads of everybody in the audience (totally above my head, anyhow), and you
  went rambling on and on, about all sorts of things that had nothing to do
  with the subject&mdash;and yet somehow, in the end, I did get a vague idea of
  what you were driving at. Anyhow, I didn&rsquo;t come away feeling
  bored.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So that was why, when you wanted to learn German&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, precisely. I knew you knew the language, because I&rsquo;ve
  seen you getting German books out of the library. But my parents didn&rsquo;t
  at all approve. To begin with, they couldn&rsquo;t see why I wanted to learn
  German at all, and then they said that since I never attended the chapel it
  was a piece of impudence for me to ask you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no, that never occurred to me.&rdquo; He paused a moment
  and then said: &ldquo;By the way, as a mere matter of curiosity, why have you
  never attended the chapel?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you really want me to tell you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, very much.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She seemed to be having to arrange her thoughts. At length she replied:
  &ldquo;I used to go regularly when I was younger. I was made to. It was the
  Silk Street chapel then, till my father had some kind of row with the
  minister there and decided to change to yours. I was seventeen and came to
  the conclusion that if he could please himself about which chapel he attended
  I ought to be able to please myself whether I attended one at all. There was
  a fuss about it at home, of course, but after all, at seventeen one
  can&rsquo;t exactly be dragged screaming along the aisle. And. I did go once
  or twice, just to sample it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t like it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not a very great deal. I never heard you preach, if that&rsquo;s
  any personal consolation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it isn&rsquo;t. What I really want to find out is
  your reason for disliking chapel itself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, to begin with, the building&rsquo;s not very attractive, is
  it? I wouldn&rsquo;t mind if it were downright ugly, like a factory, but
  it&rsquo;s got all those extra things on it&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how to
  describe them&mdash;but it looks as if it had been built in a straightforward
  way by a builder and then someone had gone round sticking architecture on
  afterwards. Perhaps that&rsquo;s rather a vague criticism. As a matter of
  fact it reminds me too much of Gounod&rsquo;s music.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like Gounod?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Neither do I, particularly. And I quite agree with all that you say
  about the chapel building; it&rsquo;s the product of a period when taste in
  architecture was at its lowest. Still, that alone oughtn&rsquo;t to keep
  anyone outside.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh no, it wouldn&rsquo;t keep me, either, if I liked everything
  else. But I suppose I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell me, if you can, some of the other things that you don&rsquo;t
  like.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s the organ, and the way the organist plays it,
  and the hymns&mdash;such stupid words, very often, which people sing without
  meaning them&mdash;&rsquo;False and full of sin I am&rsquo;, for
  instance&mdash;do you think anyone in your chapel really thinks he&rsquo;s
  false and full of sin? I&rsquo;m quite sure my father doesn&rsquo;t. Nor do
  the rest, either&mdash;they&rsquo;re far too proud of being respectable
  middle- class people ever to have such a thought...And the tunes are
  sometimes rather dreadful, too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll even agree with you in most of all that. I did try years
  ago to improve the music, but it led to trouble with the organist and
  choirmaster; they said I was interfering outside my province. Probably I was.
  It isn&rsquo;t an easy job, you know, being a parson.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it isn&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s why I said just now I
  was sorry for you&mdash;you must find so many things that seem all
  wrong.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Most of us have that experience, don&rsquo;t we? But tell me now,
  apart from the building and the music, which we both agree are far from
  perfect, what is it that you really dislike? I&rsquo;m certain it can&rsquo;t
  be entirely a matter of externals.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t, but it&rsquo;s rather difficult to answer without
  being impolite.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I shan&rsquo;t be offended&mdash;I asked for it, and anyhow, I
  really do want to know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She replied, musingly and with evident care: &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s
  probably that I don&rsquo;t feel sympathy with the spirit of the place. It
  all seems rather bleak to me, and it doesn&rsquo;t seem to have much room for
  art and beauty&mdash;in a way, I feel it almost distrusts that sort of thing.
  I know I can&rsquo;t prove what I&rsquo;m saying&mdash;I&rsquo;m only telling
  you just how things appear to me. And the revivals you sometimes
  have&mdash;they&rsquo;re a bit hysterical&mdash;and I&rsquo;m not built to
  like that sort of business. And then the preaching&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care
  much for the system that encourages practically anybody to preach. I
  can&rsquo;t feel interested, somehow, in what all kinds of people tell me,
  out of their own heads, so to speak, about religion.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There, of course, you attack the whole foundation of
  Nonconformity&mdash;perhaps even of Protestantism altogether.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do I? I&rsquo;m not really trying to attack
  anything&mdash;I&rsquo;m only describing a few rather shadowy feelings I
  have.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quite. I see that.&rdquo; On any other occasion he would have felt
  immensely worried and perturbed and would have been bursting with eloquent
  confutations and counter-arguments; but with her, rather oddly, he felt no
  inclination to do anything but just go on talking quietly and discovering her
  opinions on one thing after another. It was queer how comfortable he felt,
  and how pleasantly in sympathy with her, even all the time that she was
  undermining, in a few calm sentences, the whole fabric of his professional
  existence; the truth was that beyond and surpassing any disagreement with her
  ideas was an extraordinary interest in them that had taken possession of
  him.</p>

  <p>The waiter here provided a second interruption by removing the soup-
  plates and bringing a large <i>Sole Colbert</i> on a dish; it looked so
  enormous, even when divided, that they broke off their religious argument to
  discuss the more urgent if less exalted matter of appetite. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
  astonished to find how hungry I am,&rdquo; he declared, zestfully. &ldquo;I
  never fed equal to this sort of thing at home. It must be the change of
  air.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;More likely the good cooking,&rdquo; she answered, and then,
  perceiving the implication of her remark, flushed slightly. &ldquo;Really,
  I&rsquo;m saying the most dreadful things; I don&rsquo;t know why it is; I
  just seem to find myself speaking to you exactly as I feel&mdash;anything
  that comes into my head...But I think it&rsquo;s true, though, about the
  cooking. Once, when I came to your house for a German lesson, you were out,
  and the maid had me in the kitchen talking to her. She was alone there,
  cooking your dinner, I suppose, and ever since watching her that morning,
  I&rsquo;ve had an extra reason for being sorry for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He laughed. &ldquo;I never trouble about food when I&rsquo;m at home. I
  don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m really very interested in it. Of course,
  it&rsquo;s different to-night, but then, to-night...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The waiter approached with the wine-list, and Howat, after a
  moment&rsquo;s hesitation, passed it across the table to her. &ldquo;Will you
  choose something you like?&rdquo; he asked, doubtfully.</p>

  <p>She also was doubtful. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m very ignorant
  about drinks. I&rsquo;d rather you ask for something <i>you</i> would
  like.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Something <i>I&rsquo;d</i> like?&rdquo; He was about to disclaim
  any desire for non-teetotal drink of any kind when suddenly an impulse seized
  him and he began talking, almost to himself: &ldquo;I remember something I
  once had&mdash;I was in Germany, on a holiday, as a youth&mdash;it was some
  kind of beer, I think&mdash;ah, here&rsquo;s the list&mdash;I wonder if I
  shall call to mind the name...&rdquo; He glanced down the column and felt a
  slight stirring of memory. &ldquo;Ah, Pilsener, Pilsener&mdash;that was it.
  Yes, I think I&rsquo;d like to drink it again, after all these years. But
  what about you? Won&rsquo;t you have wine?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have the beer with you. May I?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; And he gave the order to the waiter, who had
  probably never before heard Pilsener discussed with such solemnity.</p>

  <p>But when the waiter had gone she laughed. &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s
  rather a symbolic act,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t Browdley be
  shocked?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Possibly. But without reason. It&rsquo;s merely another instance of
  the quite exceptional things that can happen during an Einstein
  interlude.&rdquo; He smiled buoyantly, yet a moment later, after watching the
  pale brown liquid stream into the glasses, he took up his own with a certain
  sense of significance. It was true, of course, that this simple glass of beer
  was quite sufficient to shatter all kinds of reputations that he possessed in
  Browdley; but somehow he could not bring himself to be concerned about it.
  The cool drink, slightly iced, gave him far different thoughts, breaking
  through the years till he remembered himself, a young man in his early
  twenties, on that first thrilling holiday abroad, walking along a winding
  Rhenish lane amidst blazing sunlight, and calling for a drink at a little
  wayside refreshment-house where he had sat outside at a bare scrubbed table
  with a group of working men in peaked caps. He had asked for mineral water,
  but the girl, misunderstanding his German, had brought him a mug of something
  which he drank and enjoyed before he realised that it was actually that
  horrible and dreaded infamy&mdash;beer.</p>

  <p>He told this story now and she was highly amused, and they went on talking
  gaily, yet with certain intervals of seriousness, throughout the rest of the
  meal, until the black coffee, accompanied with cigarettes, provided just that
  epilogue of reflectiveness that prepared them for the next stage of the
  evening&rsquo;s progress. The concert was timed to begin at eight, and at
  seven thirty he called for the bill and paid a sum which, if he had ever
  thought about it (but he did not), would have seemed entirely fantastic.</p>

  <p>On the pavement outside the restaurant someone said &ldquo;Taxi,
  sir?&rdquo; and he answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the same mood of
  impulsiveness that had made him ask for Pilsener.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap8"
     name="chap8">CHAPTER EIGHT &mdash; FRIDAY EVENING</a></h2>

  <p class="first">In the taxi he began to wonder what was really happening,
  and after musing for a time a word occurred to him, a rather astonishing
  word, he thought, but so definitely the right one that he did not seek for
  any other. It was all a &lsquo;lark&rsquo;. It was quite the most gigantic
  lark he had ever had; but then, in fact, his life up to the present had been
  somewhat deficient in larks of any kind. And it was good for him, he felt, or
  at any rate, not bad for him, to indulge in such an occasional escapade.
  Dinner, talk, music&mdash;what could be more harmless? After all, he
  reflected, he had something to celebrate as well as she.</p>

  <p>Besides, like all the best larks&mdash;perhaps it was what made them the
  best&mdash;it was all to be such a transient thing. To-morrow she would be
  abroad, to-morrow he would be in Browdley, and possibly, indeed probably,
  they would never see each other again. She would have those hours and hours
  of fiddle practice that she longed for, and he would be back in his little
  world of guild meetings and chapel services, good works and bad cooking. He
  saw, with a certain grim relish, the years stretching ahead of him; viewed in
  mind from the dark recesses of a taxi after a good dinner they seemed to
  reflect, mirror-like, something of that queer quality in the present-which
  could only be indicated by that same word&mdash;a. &lsquo;lark&rsquo;. After
  all, the spirit of fun, of adventure, of enterprise, was surely not to be
  confined to a single place or occasion. Why should there not be adventure in
  Browdley? He felt, with conviction, that he would be all the better for this
  London &lsquo;night-out&rsquo; when he got home; it had been a revelation of
  something he had so far rather missed&mdash;the joy of life, that
  unreasonable and illogical human joy that made a man buy what he could not
  afford and drink (for once) against his convictions and progress to sudden
  enchanting intimacy with someone whose very charm, perhaps, lay partly in the
  unlikelihood of any further meeting.</p>

  <p>He looked out of the cab-window and glimpsed again the throbbing and
  incredibly lovely world&mdash;the omnibuses and taxis and private cars
  passing by with people in them he would never know, each with a life-history,
  ambitions, and a soul to be saved; the whole pageant of life, no more real of
  course than was to be seen in Browdley, yet somehow swifter, more picturesque
  in its setting of electric sky-signs and opera-cloaks. He felt like an
  explorer, almost, in a strange land; all this goes on, he thought, night
  after night, just as night after night in Browdley the factory-sirens scream
  at half- past five and the crowds come tumbling into the streets&mdash;the
  curious, animated routine of two worlds, each ignorant of the other, and
  meeting, when they did, only in the gaze of some bewildered intermediary like
  himself. He thought of how such a contrast would strike Councillor Higgs, how
  it would all seem to him no more than a demonstrated theorem from the
  economics text-book; which might be very sound and scientific, but now Howat
  was perceiving another aspect&mdash;there was this question of joy, of
  &lsquo;having a lark&rsquo;, in which, despite Councillor Higgs, the poor
  were altogether in agreement with the rich. Both understood perfectly the
  technique of &lsquo;the good time&rsquo;, and both were looked at askance by
  the intermediate class. That made him think of the girl&rsquo;s description
  of his Browdley congregation&mdash;&rsquo;respectable middle-class
  people&rsquo;, she had called them, and it was accurate enough; he tried in
  vain to call to mind a single &lsquo;chapel&rsquo; family that did not come
  easily within the category. Some were hard up, he knew, but all were of the
  class that could sniff superiorly in both directions. Why was it that none of
  the really poorest and commonest people ever came to his chapel? He had seen
  them often enough outside the Catholic church. Was it possible, he thought,
  with an uprush of indignation, that he had been doing nothing for a dozen
  years but preach to the already converted? Suppose for the future he were to
  concentrate on the rest? But what had he to offer them? Respectability? The
  right hand of fellowship as dispensed by a narrow-minded and tight-fisted
  shopkeeper? A Letitia Monks Vestry complete with sham-Gothic gargoyles?
  Sermons about the Christian life by one who had passed the age of forty
  without knowing much about any kind of life?</p>

  <p>She interrupted his stormy self-questionings to ask what it was that had
  kept him silent for half the length of Regent Street.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rather an odd thought,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It just occurred
  to me that if ever there&rsquo;s armed revolution in this country I daresay I
  shall escape, if I wear my collar, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if those
  fellows in opera-hats over there escape too, but the gutters will probably be
  running with the blood of respectable middle-class people who go to
  chapel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That sounds rather fierce.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, perhaps I don&rsquo;t mean it very seriously. But I feel
  fierce enough when I call to mind all the lies that were told me about
  you.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t bother about them. Why do you care any more than I
  do what people say?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t care, do you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not a bit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Accidentally in the darkness of the cab his hand touched hers, and the
  contact, together with her answer, gave him a suddenly warming affection for
  her, and through her, for all struggling and adventurous humanity&mdash;for
  the street urchin fighting his first fight, for the speculator staking a
  fortune on some hairline of probability, for the artist never quite
  succeeding, and for all kinds of obvious heroes and heroines as well; he saw
  her spirit in them all, and that such a spirit should be maligned by the
  secure and the unadventurous swept him again into passionate indignation.</p>

  <p>But they had reached the concert-hall and the uniformed commissionaire was
  holding open the taxi-door.</p>

  <p>As soon as he was settled comfortably in his seat he wanted to laugh. He
  felt so happy, and he had been anticipating this moment of settlement for so
  long, and the people all around him looked so very solemn, and the girl at
  his side stared ahead with such radiant eagerness at the sleek grand piano on
  the platform. The Cavendish was one of the older concert halls, and gazing
  round at its chocolate and gold decorations he said: &ldquo;This is nearly as
  ugly as my chapel, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Rather uglier, if
  anything, I think,&rdquo; she replied, and the retort pleased him obscurely
  and made him want to laugh more than ever.</p>

  <p>But soon they found something definitely merrymaking, for the printed
  programme contained a series of verbal descriptions and interpretations of
  the music, such as&mdash;&ldquo;Now all the noontide rapture and pulsating
  vitality of the preceding movement have given place to a calm twilight
  atmosphere in which the soul begins to glimmer like a star&rdquo;; and they
  made the sudden mutual discovery that this was the sort of thing that amused
  them both intensely. For the next few minutes it seemed a pity to do anything
  but rummage through their programmes with occasional remarks of &ldquo;Oh,
  <i>do</i> read this&mdash;it&rsquo;s better still!&rdquo;&mdash;until they
  became so uproarious that people near them began to look round reprovingly.
  &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; he exclaimed at last, after laughing a great deal,
  &ldquo;is this a proper mood for approaching great music?&rdquo;&mdash;and
  she answered: &ldquo;Yes, I think it is&mdash;much better, anyhow, than the
  mood of the person who wrote that programme stuff.&rdquo; He responded:
  &ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;oh, yes,&rdquo; with almost worshipful eagerness; he
  knew what she meant, and it was somehow deep with all kinds of meanings that
  were his also.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It would be much more intelligent to call music just a nice noise,
  as a child might,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I agree. These attempts to describe tunes in words are ridiculous.
  You can&rsquo;t ever be sure what a composer means.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why should he mean anything at all? Isn&rsquo;t the nice noise that
  he invents reason enough?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reason enough for us, but is it <i>his</i> reason? Why does he
  compose?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because he feels like it, or because it&rsquo;s his job. Or, most
  often perhaps, because he can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The person who wrote these programme notes would think your reasons
  very unromantic.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think they&rsquo;re tremendous reasons. Especially to do
  something because you can&rsquo;t help doing it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I&rsquo;ve had that feeling myself at odd
  times.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When you first became a minister, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He seemed puzzled for a moment. &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; he replied at
  length. &ldquo;But that wasn&rsquo;t really in my mind. I was thinking of
  once or twice when <i>I&rsquo;ve</i> tackled music composition.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve composed?&rdquo; she queried, her eyes showing more
  surprise than her words.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only a little. When I was younger I was very keen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What did you compose?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Songs, hymn-tunes, all sorts of things. I once won ten pounds for a
  string quartet. That was my biggest hit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where was that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At a musical festival in East London. I had the pleasure of hearing
  my quartet played once, very badly, at a special festival concert; that was
  twenty odd years ago, and I&rsquo;m fairly certain it&rsquo;s never been
  heard anywhere since.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It must have been pretty good.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t bad, I admit. But it wasn&rsquo;t very good,
  either. I won the prize because the others were worse.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know more about it. I never guessed you&rsquo;d
  done that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I never guessed you were interested in music at
  all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know. It was a pity.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And while he was pondering on what exactly she meant or could mean by
  that, the pianist and violinist appeared on the platform and the audience
  broke into applause. The first item was the Kreutzer Sonata, and from the
  very opening notes Howat had the impression of never having heard it, or even
  any music, before. He was amazed and a little awed by the feeling; it was
  terrifying, this acuteness of perception that had come over
  him&mdash;something beyond his mastery, threatening to engulf him in a flood
  of turbulent sensation, and though he could not identify it with anything
  known or imagined, yet during the Andante movement it rose in him to such a
  curious ache that but for the girl at his side and the thought of making a
  disturbance he might have left the hall. He gripped with his hands tightly on
  the arm-rests and commanded himself not to be so foolish, so overcome; it was
  absurd that even music should create such emotional tumult; but it was not
  the music alone, he explained to himself, but the strange sequence of events
  that had been happening all day. To-morrow, anyhow, he reflected, would see
  him reduced to his normal temperature; to-morrow, walking down the slope at
  Browdley Station, he would step into his old accustomed groove. But the final
  presto movement swept him out of all such reassurance into a world in which
  even thought could not be resolved into words, or even feeling into thought.
  Only the applause at the finish wakened him to reality. He felt dazed, then,
  and exhausted, as if he had been fighting some secret battle all alone.</p>

  <p>The girl, fresh and confidant, turned to him immediately. They discussed
  the Kreutzer performance for a time, and then she wanted to know more, in
  detail, about composing work. He told her, as well as he could, and she
  listened with grave attention. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you do any of it
  now?&rdquo; she asked, afterwards.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do, occasionally. I put in an hour or two only this last
  week&mdash;trying a song for the school Christmas concert.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve given up your big ambitions?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, entirely.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is it because you don&rsquo;t think any more that you <i>could</i>
  do anything big? Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s in you to do it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He pondered and replied slowly: &ldquo;Honestly, I don&rsquo;t know for
  certain, but I should say probably not. I was far too ambitious years ago,
  that&rsquo;s obvious. Of course I have a certain amount of talent&mdash;it
  could perhaps be developed if I had the time. But I haven&rsquo;t the time,
  and never will have, so really it&rsquo;s not much use thinking about it, is
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; she said, thoughtfully, &ldquo;that these things
  usually work themselves out in the right way. I mean, if there is great stuff
  in anyone, it <i>does</i> come out&mdash;it <i>has</i> to&mdash;nothing else
  can happen. One would just give up everything for it. The same old
  reason&mdash;doing something because you can&rsquo;t help doing
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He smiled. &ldquo;Very well, when you hear that I&rsquo;ve given up my
  pastorate in Browdley to go and compose string quartets in some garret in
  Chelsea, or wherever they do compose them, you can assume that I&rsquo;ve
  done it because I couldn&rsquo;t help doing it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The programme then continued. The pianist played a Schumann group; next
  followed the Brahms A Major Piano and Violin Sonata.</p>

  <p>Howat had hoped all along that they would play this, and its name on the
  programme had set a further seal upon the perfection of the evening. Now, as
  it began, he fell into a second storm of emotion, but he did not, as during
  the Kreutzer, attempt resistance; he let himself be carried along the crest
  of the flood-tide and, at the end, found himself tranquil, though in a
  strange harbour. He could not collect his thoughts for a time, but it was the
  end of the concert and people were already chattering and shuffling out of
  their seats. He rose with his companion and joined the crowd streaming to the
  exits; &ldquo;I like that Brahms,&rdquo; he said, soberly; and she answered:
  &ldquo;So do I.&rdquo; There came a point in experience, he reflected (and he
  felt that she realised it also), when understatement was the less absurd of
  alternatives. When they were halfway to the doors renewed applause brought on
  the performers again; they played a short encore piece&mdash;some little
  modern thing which Howat did not know and did not particularly care for
  either. Nor did she; and he thought: How I like that way she has of being so
  effortlessly cool and downright&mdash;the way she says &lsquo;I like
  this&rsquo; or &rsquo;I don&rsquo;t care .for that&rsquo;&mdash;with her eyes
  clear as crystal and her nose in the air like some high-spirited
  thoroughbred. But there was something warm and excited behind the crystal
  coolness, and in the lobby outside the hall she suddenly took his arm and
  exclaimed: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go in yet&mdash;it&rsquo;s quite
  early. Are you tired? Do you want to go back to your hotel?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He had never thought about the matter until now, but he answered:
  &ldquo;Oh no, I&rsquo;m not tired, either.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s selfish of me&mdash;I&rsquo;m
  forgetting the long day you&rsquo;ve had.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had one of the most extraordinary days of my
  life&mdash;far too wonderful to have been tiring.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be tired to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall probably sleep in the train all the way.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then at Browdley I suppose your work begins again
  immediately?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ve got a Bazaar Committee meeting and the Young
  Men&rsquo;s class to-morrow night, and Sunday&rsquo;s going to be even busier
  than usual, because it&rsquo;s Armistice Day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I shall be on my way to Vienna. Isn&rsquo;t it odd to think
  about it? Do you suppose we shall ever meet again?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you come to Browdley, perhaps, or if I go to Vienna.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Neither of which seems very likely, does it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ve got to make the most of what&rsquo;s left. When I
  think of all those hours we spent over the German without ever guessing how
  much we both liked&mdash;Brahms&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I once heard you humming the opening theme of that sonata. I was
  rather surprised.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There was your chance. If you had only asked me about
  it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know. I wish I had asked you. I&rsquo;m an awful misser of
  chances.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Does nobody in Browdley know <i>anything</i> about you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not really such a mystery as all that. I think quite
  a number of people know me fairly well.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But the music?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a secret&mdash;it&rsquo;s merely that most people
  aren&rsquo;t interested. You wouldn&rsquo;t be, unless you were keen on the
  thing yourself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They had walked away from the hall and were now in quiet and almost
  deserted side-streets. &ldquo;Where shall we go?&rdquo; she asked, and he
  could not give any definite answer, except a suggestion that they should make
  their way nearer to the the theatres and restaurants. He knew little about
  London&rsquo;s night civilisation and at that moment cared even less. His
  senses were full of enchantments, and he was perfectly happy to be strolling
  in a direction which, by instinct rather than calculation, he believed to be
  correct. With her arm in his they walked all the way, skirting spacious
  squares and across the main traffic highways and into narrow yards and alleys
  and diagonally across short streets from lamp-post to lamp-post, past
  shuttered windows and cabmen&rsquo;s shelters and cats sitting delicately in
  doorways; till at last a distant glow over roofs came so near that they
  walked abruptly right into it&mdash;it was Piccadilly Circus. All the way
  they had been talking, but now they stopped, dazzled by the brilliance, and
  felt for a moment like country cousins. There were so many restaurants where
  evening dress was clearly expected, and so many others whose precise
  character did not look too obvious, that finally Howat made for the swing
  doors of the Regent Palace Hotel; he had heard of it; it was where people
  from Browdley sometimes stayed.</p>

  <p>Under the dome in the lounge of that rather amazing establishment they
  took coffee and sandwiches and smoked cigarettes. A certain recklessness was
  on him, not diminished by the realisation that it was approaching an hour
  when all good parsons are in bed. The colourful scene alternately attracted
  and repelled; it pulsated with crude, animal vitality, and the saxophones
  droning in the distance expressed that vitality to perfection, within the
  limits of their own peculiar technique. It was all something that he rather
  disliked, yet it drew him nearer in mind and sympathy to the girl at his
  side; he looked at her as she sat there, so calm and close to him, and he
  thought: But for you I should be fantastically unhappy in this place, but
  with you it&rsquo;s rather exhilarating; you make its vitality stand out;
  you&rsquo;re like a prism, through which I&rsquo;m managing to see all kinds
  of different, magical things...And then, in a way that had never happened
  before, he reflected: Browdley&mdash;Browdley&mdash;Browdley to-morrow...</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope we <i>shall</i> meet again sometime,&rdquo; he said,
  transmuting his thought a little.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I do, too,&rdquo; she answered, and they exchanged a glance
  that lasted only a fraction of a second, and then went on talking, about
  music and pictures and books and all kinds of side-topics that thrust
  themselves unwanted yet unshirked into the conversation; it was midnight
  before they decided that they really must go. As they passed through the
  crowded lobby and into the street, he said: &ldquo;Let me see now&mdash;where
  is it you said you were staying?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;South Kensington. It&rsquo;s a studio in a sort of mews. The people
  who have it are rather amusing&mdash;the man&rsquo;s an actor and the woman
  paints&mdash;very badly, I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;but they&rsquo;ve both been
  awfully nice to me. They&rsquo;re friends of Isaac&rsquo;s, and when he wrote
  to them about me they asked me to stay with them as long as I was in
  London.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Crowds were jostling down the tube entrances.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose the tube&rsquo;s your best way,&rdquo; he said,
  &ldquo;but there seems a tremendous rush. Would you rather try for a bus?
  It&rsquo;s not so quick, but usually pleasanter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a return ticket from Charing Cross. That&rsquo;s
  only a few minutes&rsquo; walk away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So they set off down the Haymarket and across Trafalgar Square; six-and-a-
  half hours, he reflected, since he had met her there outside the post office;
  but the interval was hardly reckonable in time. Down Northumberland Avenue to
  the river the wind swept past them in cold gusts; little pools in the gutters
  were already frozen hard. They crossed the tramlines to look at the river,
  rolling by like coils of black snakes; the railway bridge soared above them,
  glittering with red and green signal-lights. A moving brilliance zoomed
  across and sent a cascade of silver-blue sparks into the darkness below.
  &ldquo;How beautiful that is,&rdquo; she exclaimed, watching the train
  disappear over the south side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the bridge they&rsquo;re always talking of pulling
  down because they say it&rsquo;s ugly and spoils what&rsquo;s supposed to be
  one of the finest views in the world.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s much more beautiful than a good many views of
  that sort.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. It represents the best of its period just as the architecture
  of my chapel represents the worst. The Victorians only achieved beauty when
  they aimed at utility.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know. I always think the best things in Browdley to show visitors
  are the cotton-mills. They&rsquo;re so downright ugly you can stand
  them&mdash;they&rsquo;re almost beautiful because of that. Anyhow,
  they&rsquo;re not depressing, and they don&rsquo;t put on airs, like the Town
  Hall and the Technical School.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They walked over the road to the station entrance and he was full of the
  feeling that there were unnumbered things he wanted to say to her and that as
  soon as she was gone they would all come tumbling upon him. But when they
  reached the booking-hall they found there were no more trains. They might get
  a bus, someone suggested, in the Strand, so they hurried back along
  Northumberland Avenue to Trafalgar Square and puzzled themselves over several
  vehicles, all quite full, that were bound for places neither of them had ever
  heard of. At length he said: &ldquo;Well, we can walk a little way, unless
  you&rsquo;re tired, and get one as it overtakes us. I daresay there&rsquo;ll
  be room in them soon.&rdquo; It sounded rather vague, but she agreed without
  argument, and they skirted the corner of the square and passed under the
  Admiralty Arch into the Mall, unaware that omnibuses did not traverse that
  spacious highway. But it was pleasant enough to stroll at one o&rsquo;clock
  in the morning under the leafless trees. At last a turning opened out on the
  left and she exclaimed: &ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s go down here, it leads through
  St. James&rsquo;s Park to Victoria Station&mdash;I know there are always late
  buses from there. And there&rsquo;s no hurry so far as I&rsquo;m concerned;
  those people I&rsquo;m with always stay up half the night. Besides, they gave
  me a key.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They entered the park. He was not quite sure how it would help the journey
  to South Kensington, but he was still in rather the mood of not
  caring&mdash;after all, it was their last chance, they would never meet and
  talk again. The prospect of that imminent farewell gave him not so much a
  feeling of sadness as of something cold and rather blank that he must soon
  encounter and become used to. He wondered, then, for the first time, if they
  would correspond. On the whole, he thought better not; there could be no
  particular point in it, since they would probably never renew the
  acquaintance. But he did say, with a fervour that rather astonished him:
  &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re in Vienna I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;ll think a
  great deal about Browdley&mdash;no reason, of course, why you
  should&mdash;but I do want you to feel that&mdash;in any emergency&mdash;you
  have a friend there. Remember now. At any time&mdash;years hence,
  perhaps&mdash;a letter to me will not be wasted. I mean, I shall always want
  to help you, if it should ever happen that I can. And I daresay I shall
  always be in Browdley, so you&rsquo;ll know where to write.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very kind of you, and I do thank you. I shall
  like to feel that. I wish there&rsquo;d been more time for us to get to know
  each other. It&rsquo;s absurd, really&mdash;dashing away like this to the
  opposite ends of the earth. They are rather opposite ends, aren&rsquo;t
  they?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Absolutely, I should say.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s so lovely here to-night. What&rsquo;s that building
  over there with all the lights shining on it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t think I really know where I
  am.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Probably I&rsquo;m dragging you miles out of your way. I keep
  forgetting how tired you must be. What time&rsquo;s your train to-
  morrow?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one at ten-thirty I might try for.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mine&rsquo;s at ten.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose we both ought to hurry up and get some sleep.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t sleep. I&rsquo;ll be too excited.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;About to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. And to-day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He felt the very slightest pressure of her arm in his, and the sensation
  moved him to a curious whimsical tenderness. &ldquo;Elizabeth,&rdquo; he said
  (he had never called her by her name until then)&mdash;&ldquo;to-day
  <i>has</i> been rather fine, hasn&rsquo;t it? Finer, for me, probably, than
  for you. It seems a hundred years since a solitary grey-haired parson stepped
  out of a train at St. Pancras Station and carried his bag to a second-rate
  hotel in Bloomsbury. He was tired and worried, partly because he thought he
  was very ill, and partly because he had to face an embarrassing interview
  with a certain young lady of whom he had not had, to be candid, the very best
  reports.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He had expected her to be amused, but instead she was silent for a time
  and then responded, as if with some effort to achieve the same mood:
  &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not solitary and I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re
  really very grey- haired, either. Besides, even if you were both, the
  description wouldn&rsquo;t do, because it suggests someone old and decrepit.
  You aren&rsquo;t exactly that, are you, Howat? Is &lsquo;Howat&rsquo; what I
  have to call you? It&rsquo;s a queer name, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was my father&rsquo;s. I think it suits a parson, though
  <i>he</i> wasn&rsquo;t one&mdash;it has just a slight flavour of
  pretentiousness. I sometimes wish I had another name. No, no, I
  don&rsquo;t&mdash;I really don&rsquo;t care at all. I&rsquo;m not sure that I
  know what I&rsquo;m talking about.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps that&rsquo;s why you called yourself solitary.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;More likely I was thinking of those old-fashioned boys&rsquo; yarns
  in magazines years ago that used to begin&mdash;&rsquo;One glorious
  summer&rsquo;s evening, in the heart of the Canadian Rockies, a solitary
  horseman might have been seen&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you do know what you&rsquo;re talking
  about.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course not. I warn you, I shall talk nothing but nonsense till
  we say good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He felt, indeed, as if a divine yet rather wistful nonsense were closing
  round him on all sides. The sky was full of stars and there was a new moon,
  and that shining building, whatever it was, now stood directly ahead, its
  tall square tower, brilliantly flood-lit, facing them like some fairy goal
  beyond the trees. The path they were traversing sloped gently down to the
  suspension bridge over the ornamental water, and there the loveliness of the
  scene was like a sudden droning in his ears; he stopped, and put his arm
  round her shoulder as they both gazed down at the water and then across to
  the spectral buildings in the distance. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the Foreign
  Office, I think,&rdquo; she said, and he replied: &ldquo;Ah yes,
  yes...&rdquo; But he was thinking of something else; he was thinking&mdash;By
  God, I believe there is something in me, if it had a chance; I believe what
  I&rsquo;m everlastingly seeking for wouldn&rsquo;t always elude...He felt as
  if some utmost beauty of the world were calling to him with open arms, while
  he, for some unfathomable reason, wanted to answer yet could not either speak
  nor stir.</p>

  <p>When, a few moments later, they entered Bird-cage Walk, Big Ben was
  chiming the quarter, and it was too late, he guessed, to think of finding an
  omnibus. He asked for the address where she was staying and summoned the
  first taxi that carne along. He would accompany her, he planned, say good-bye
  at her destination, and return to his hotel in the same taxi.</p>

  <p>As they drove off she said: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go back straight away.
  Can&rsquo;t you spare a minute to come up and see the people I&rsquo;m
  staying with? I think you&rsquo;ll probably like them&mdash;they&rsquo;re
  interesting.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it rather late for paying a call?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, they don&rsquo;t care. They very often stay up most of the
  night talking to people. And they&rsquo;ve got a photograph of
  Isaac&mdash;I&rsquo;d rather like you to see it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, &rsquo;I&rsquo;d like to myself. All right, I&rsquo;ll come,
  but I really mustn&rsquo;t stay long. Think of my train to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And mine. Just now I find them both rather dreadful to think
  of.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, but you&rsquo;ll love Vienna.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you been there?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;ve always had a great desire to go. Not that I ever
  will&mdash;it&rsquo;s too far. The Viennese are supposed to be delightful
  people.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So long as Viennese landladies don&rsquo;t object to fiddle
  practice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps some day I shall pay my five-and-ninepence to hear that
  fiddle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should think it very, very improbable.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In a way I don&rsquo;t care. As I told you, I&rsquo;m not
  especially optimistic about making money and being successful. I&rsquo;m just
  doing everything because I must&mdash;because I don&rsquo;t seem to be able
  to get what I want any other way. It&rsquo;s a personal thing. I don&rsquo;t
  really care a bit about showing off before other people, though I&rsquo;d be
  willing enough to do it for a living. I just want to play the fiddle,
  that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think I understand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I really believe you do, and I&rsquo;m certain nobody else
  does.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Except Isaac?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah yes, except him.&rdquo; They both laughed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
  like his face, I think. He&rsquo;s terribly ugly, so people say, but I never
  noticed it particularly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He has understanding, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. He knows how it is that so many things don&rsquo;t matter when
  once you&rsquo;re certain what does matter. At his cinema, for instance, he
  has to play the most awful music from three every afternoon until eleven at
  night, but he doesn&rsquo;t mind. He says very often he doesn&rsquo;t even
  <i>hear</i> it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can believe that. Often I don&rsquo;t hear my own congregation
  singing a very bad hymn_ tune half a semitone fiat. I suppose I&rsquo;ve got
  used to it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that a pity, though, in your case? You&rsquo;d have
  hated it at one time, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I did hate it, then.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And nowadays you don&rsquo;t bother?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I try not to. Somehow, though it perhaps sounds foolish to say so,
  I&rsquo;m a bit afraid of bothering. It would be so easy for me to bother too
  much.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t afraid years ago.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, heavens, no. I was keen enough till&mdash;oh, till I realised
  it wasn&rsquo;t much use being keen. When I was in my teens and early
  twenties I used to scribble down tunes nearly every night. My parents died
  when I was young, and I went to live with a rather fine old dissenting
  preacher in a small Kentish village. There was a family of seven daughters. I
  remember some of them used to sing&mdash;the usual kind of songs people did
  sing in those days&mdash;and I sometimes tried to teach them things of my
  own, but it was never much of a success. I&rsquo;m sure the fault was chiefly
  mine&mdash;they were probably written in impossible keys. It was the youngest
  girl, by the way, who afterwards became my wife.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Were you very much in love with her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The question, so artless and direct, took him by surprise, so far as
  anything, in the mood he was in, could have done so; he reflected for a
  second and then evaded with: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think people who marry
  are usually in love at the time?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At the time? Do you mean only that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He felt her keen, eager mind in sharp contact with his own; it was
  exciting and a little uncanny, the way she could open up long avenues of
  speculation, not so much by her questions as by the questions that her
  questions suggested. He did not know what to say in answer, but the taxi
  rescued him from the problem by drawing in and halting at the kerbside. He
  paid the driver and then, as the cab drove away, stared around with a renewed
  sense of strangeness; there they were, the two of them, marooned at that
  rather forlorn hour of the morning amidst a waste of empty pavements and tall
  unlit houses. &ldquo;This way,&rdquo; she said, leading him into a narrow
  side turning that appeared to expand further on into a sort of enclosed yard.
  &ldquo;These used to be stables belonging to those big houses, but now
  they&rsquo;re mostly garages. My friends are lucky because the garage they
  live over belongs to a man who spends half the year abroad. They&rsquo;re
  really quite comfortable places to live in. This way. I suppose as it&rsquo;s
  so late I&rsquo;d better use the key.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She took a Yale key from her bag and unlocked a door that gave directly on
  to the yard. A dark interior was revealed, and a second later, when she had
  switched on the light, a small lobby with a flight of stairs ascending to a
  first floor. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go up,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re
  probably in the studio.&rdquo; She climbed the stairs, with Howat following
  her. All this seemed to be happening, so far as he was aware, in a curious
  dream, a dream in which the most fantastic things followed one another with a
  kind of preposterous reasonableness. At the top of the stairs was a landing
  with several closed doors; she opened one of them, switched on a light, and
  gazed around. The room was empty, but it bore signs of having been fairly
  recently inhabited. Used glasses stood on a Sheraton sideboard, and there was
  a cabinet gramophone with a record still on the turntable. It was a rather
  cosily furnished room, in which one window had evidently been enlarged to
  give a good north light. There were several bookcases, a baby grand piano,
  and an easel supporting a half finished and not very attractive portrait of a
  ballet- dancer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t seem here,&rdquo; she said, and then caught sight
  of a letter on the mantelpiece addressed, in a very conspicuous scribble, to
  herself. She tore open the envelope and a few seconds later exclaimed:
  &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve gone away for the week-end&mdash;some friends called and
  invited them suddenly.&rdquo; She handed Howat the note; it was signed
  &lsquo;Finola&rsquo;, and in the course of a few dozen roughly pencilled
  words conveyed an explanation, an apology, good wishes for the future, a hope
  that she would be sure to come again when next she was in London, and a
  command for her to make herself thoroughly comfortable during that last night
  at the studio. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Finola,&rdquo; she added, and pointed to a
  portrait on the wall of a pale thin-lipped woman with prominent cheek bones
  and a necklace of large green beads. &ldquo;She painted that of herself, but
  it doesn&rsquo;t flatter. I&rsquo;m sorry you couldn&rsquo;t have met
  her&mdash;and her husband. But its really just like them to go rushing off in
  such a hurry.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, too. I like their room. It&rsquo;s got a sort of
  genial untidiness about it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re like that themselves&mdash;genial and untidy.
  I&rsquo;m very fond of them both, though I&rsquo;ve only known them for a few
  days. It&rsquo;s queer how a room can sometimes make you feel at home,
  isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, this one does, I admit. It&rsquo;s the casualness of
  it&mdash;everything just comfortably anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They <i>are</i> casual&mdash;the way they just go off at a
  moment&rsquo;s notice like this, for instance. Somehow I don&rsquo;t feel
  it&rsquo;s at all impolite of them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s almost a charming characteristic. This room makes me
  wish my own wasn&rsquo;t so stiff and formal. But I&rsquo;m afraid
  that&rsquo;s in the hands of my sister-in-law. She has the strictest ideas
  about tidying up. I can just imagine how shocked she&rsquo;d be by a place
  like this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. I met her once. I found her just a bit
  terrifying.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s very good-hearted, of course. I don&rsquo;t know what
  my wife would do without her, with all that great house to look
  after.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you move into a smaller house?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s what I would do if I had my own
  way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d be happier.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes...Those enormous houses were part of a different social system
  altogether. I&rsquo;d be just as comfortable and certainly much better off
  living over a garage. After all, what does it matter where you
  live?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Provided you&rsquo;re happy in what you&rsquo;re doing...I like
  that picture over there, don&rsquo;t you? They picked it up at a sale the
  other day&mdash;they&rsquo;re always picking things up. That&rsquo;s why the
  place is in such a glorious muddle. I don&rsquo;t believe they ever
  &lsquo;furnished&rsquo;, as people say. I imagine they just began with an
  almost empty room and let things accumulate.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not a bad way. Better than going to a shop and buying vanloads of
  standardised stuff all at once.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was leaning against the mantelpiece with her heels on the fender-rail
  when suddenly she slipped and caused a little clatter of fire-irons. The
  noise awoke him from the almost trance-like gossip in which he had been
  taking part; it was as if both of them, more or less unconsciously, had been
  talking hard to obscure the fact that they were alone in someone else&rsquo;s
  studio at half- past one in the morning, and would soon be saying good-bye,
  never to meet again.</p>

  <p>He looked at his watch. &ldquo;Really, I ought to go. It&rsquo;s very
  late.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose it is...Oh, you haven&rsquo;t seen that photograph
  of Isaac. It&rsquo;s in their other room&mdash;I&rsquo;ll get it for
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She rushed away and reappeared a few seconds later with a cabinet-sized
  photograph of a rather fleshy, genial-looking man, obviously a Jew, with a
  high domed forehead and deep-set eyes that more than made up for coarse
  features in the lower part of the face. Howat studied it closely and with a
  certain willingness to be impressed. &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s an
  interesting-looking man,&rdquo; he said at length.</p>

  <p>She was standing near him, gazing over his arm at the photograph.
  &ldquo;He&mdash;he&rsquo;s a musician,&rdquo; she responded, with a sudden
  stammer in her voice.</p>

  <p>I know&mdash;I can believe ii. He felt a warm spring of sympathy rising in
  him, and beyond it, a tinge of whimsical envy; the girl, he realised, was
  fond of this man in a way which it was not given to many men to experience;
  and he had a vague sensation of desire, of desire to share the rays of such
  eager, comradely affection. He felt, amidst the flurry of that desire&mdash;I
  wish she were my daughter; and then he thought of his own daughter, cramming
  away at her text-books, and rejecting all in life that did not assist in her
  melancholy progress from matriculation to &lsquo;inter&rsquo; and from
  &lsquo;inter&rsquo; to &lsquo;final&rsquo;; he thought, dispassionately:
  Mary&rsquo;s a rather unattractive girl, she&rsquo;ll probably never marry,
  it&rsquo;s just as well she is keen on degrees and things. Yet why, be
  reflected, was there such a tremendous difference, between his own
  daughter&rsquo;s ambitions and this girl&rsquo;s musical career in Vienna,
  between his daughter&rsquo;s Latin verbs and the German lessons he had given
  to Elizabeth Garland? He felt that there <i>was</i> a difference, absolutely
  and in kind; but <i>why?</i> The answer eluded him, and was lost, anyhow, in
  a renewal of desire as he laid the photograph on the table and began
  buttoning his overcoat. Oh, I <i>wish</i> she were my daughter, he kept
  thinking, and as he saw her clear unswerving eyes still fixed on the
  photograph, he thought further: There&rsquo;s something in you that means all
  that I&rsquo;ve been meaning, all those ideas I&rsquo;ve been trying to
  spread, everything I&rsquo;ve been groping for in a blind way for
  years...</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, smiling at her.</p>

  <p>She moved back to the mantelpiece and stood again with her heels on the
  fender-rail. &ldquo;Must you go?&rdquo; she said, casually.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well...it&rsquo;s late, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make myself some coffee before I go to bed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably too late for you to find a taxi in the streets.
  There&rsquo;s a telephone in the other room&mdash;I could ring for one when
  you wanted it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take off your coat for a few minutes. I&rsquo;ll light the fire.
  After all, they told me to make myself comfortable, didn&rsquo;t
  they?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She knelt on the rug to strike a match, and the gas-fire lit with a loud
  pop. When she rose he saw that her eyes were wet with tears.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;d&mdash;I&rsquo;d much rather&mdash;you didn&rsquo;t go
  till&mdash;till I&rsquo;ve made you some coffee,&rdquo; she said, in a level
  voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he answered cheerfully. He took off his overcoat
  and almost flung himself into one of the deep armchairs that lay about.
  &ldquo;I agree with you,&rdquo; he added, with a sort of forced nonchalance,
  &ldquo;this room does make one feel at home. You&rsquo;ll have a job to turn
  me out of it if you&rsquo;re not careful.&rdquo; He laughed and she laughed
  also, and then went out to the little kitchenette that adjoined the
  studio.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap9"
     name="chap9">CHAPTER NINE &mdash; SATURDAY MORNING</a></h2>

  <p class="first">He lounged by the fire while she made coffee. A certain
  outward excitement died down in him, and he began to feel very cosy and
  tranquil and quietly talkative, so that when she brought the coffee and sat
  opposite him at the other side of the fire, they both plunged into chatter
  about the concert and music and other topics as casually as if the time and
  the place had been utterly normal. He felt, as he sat there, that he would
  like nothing better than for such a thing to happen after every long day of
  his life&mdash;to talk thus, and drink coffee, with her at the other side of
  a fire. It was something else in life that he had missed, and was now
  enjoying with all the more relish because till then he had never even guessed
  its existence&mdash;this pleasant comradely domesticity of two persons
  sitting up late to talk together after everyone else had gone to bed. A
  dreamy tenderness enveloped him as he gazed across at her; and gradually, in
  the midst of that tenderness, there grew in him the thought that she was
  beautiful. Like the lovely figurehead of a ship, he had imagined formerly,
  but now he imagined much more&mdash;she seemed to him rather like every
  beautiful thing there ever was or had been in the world&mdash;like Brahms,
  Raphael, William Blake...</p>

  <p>They talked for over half an hour before he said he would have to go.
  &ldquo;Really, I must&mdash;it&rsquo;s nearly half-past two, and I
  don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s a night-porter at my hotel. I assure you I
  don&rsquo;t want to go a bit&mdash;I&rsquo;m so comfortable here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m hating the thought of going out into that cold
  street, but it&rsquo;s got to be.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hating the thought of you going.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s lonely for you by yourself. You&rsquo;re not
  nervous, are you, in a strange place?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, no...&rdquo; She seemed all at once filled with regret too
  intense even to try to conceal. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go then and ring for a cab
  for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She hurried away and he heard her switch on the light in some further
  room. Left alone, he had a disconcerting vision of Browdley as it would await
  him on the morrow, of his prim and comfortless study, of the routine of weeks
  and months and years reaching into the future, of being an old man some day.
  Such thoughts induced him in a gloom which was all the harder to endure after
  his previous serenity&mdash;come now, he thought, as she returned,
  let&rsquo;s say good-bye and get it over quickly. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d
  better go down and wait in the street,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the man will
  never find his way through that narrow entry. No, you mustn&rsquo;t come with
  me, it&rsquo;s far too cold. Don&rsquo;t bother to come down
  even&mdash;I&rsquo;ll let myself out. Thanks for the coffee. And remember
  what I said&mdash;if there&rsquo;s ever any way I can help you, write and
  tell me...The very best of luck...Good-bye, Elizabeth...Goodbye, my&mdash;my
  dear girl...&rdquo; He did not look at her while he was speaking&mdash;come
  on, come on, he urged himself, don&rsquo;t linger and make it all more
  difficult...</p>

  <p>Those few words; that quick handshake; and he was down the stairs, feeling
  for the door-catch. In another moment the door closed behind him and he stood
  shivering in the night air. He felt chilled and numb, with a little pinpoint
  of misery somewhere inside him that was expanding with every second. The
  world hung still and silent; it would take a minute or two, no doubt, for the
  cab to arrive. He paced up and down a short stretch of pavement, trying not
  to think, not even to feel.</p>

  <p>Then, in the darkness of the yard whence he had come, a patch of light
  shone suddenly; he stared round, and saw her standing at the doorway. Never
  had his whole being swung into keener ecstasy than at such a reprieve&mdash;a
  few pitiful seconds snatched from an eternity ahead. He went back, trying to
  seem rather offhand and casual. &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he began,
  but he could hardly control his voice, &ldquo;you shouldn&rsquo;t have
  bothered to come down. It&rsquo;s too cold for you to stand here. Do please
  go back. The cab will be up in a minute&mdash;there&rsquo;s really no
  need&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; she whispered, clutching his sleeve. Dimly he
  wondered, and when she drew him into the little lobby at the foot of the
  stairs, the wondering grew to a tingling excitement. &ldquo;That cab,&rdquo;
  he stammered, &ldquo;I must keep a lookout for that cab...</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t come...Howat, I never rang for it...I
  couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;I found I couldn&rsquo;t...Are you very angry with
  me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The world dizzied about him, and he took her closely into his arms with
  all his senses brimming over. He did not and could not speak, but he knew
  bewilderedly that he had wanted her like that. After a moment, and without a
  word between them, they climbed the stairs and stood again in that warm,
  companionable room; it seemed full of welcome now. He took her to him again
  and the sweetness of her body streamed into his, and made him feel like a
  youth about to conquer the world. She clung to him with that strange, simple
  intentness that was in the way she talked and looked; he still could not
  think of any words, but she said to him, in a calm whisper: &ldquo;I do love
  you so much, Howat. I can&rsquo;t help it. It began all the time you were
  giving me those lessons&mdash;all the time you weren&rsquo;t taking any
  notice of me. Of course it was absurd&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I told myself
  then&mdash;but now it doesn&rsquo;t seem absurd any more. It&rsquo;s
  everything else that seems absurd now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;I know.&rdquo; His mind was tremulously aflame at
  her confession, but especially at her mention of those earlier meetings;
  somehow the realisation that her love had come spontaneously and long before
  his, lifted him to a supreme pinnacle of rapture. &ldquo;My dearest
  child...&rdquo; he began, and meant to say such infinities of things, but
  found he could not progress beyond those few words. They drew away from each
  other then, and she went on talking in abrupt but still calm sentences.
  &ldquo;Howat, I couldn&rsquo;t help it. I. tried, but it was no use. And
  I&rsquo;m glad now that this has happened&mdash;yes, I&rsquo;m glad, even if
  you aren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m glad too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you? You don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll begin to hate me as
  soon as you get back to Browdley?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He said then, only just audibly: &ldquo;Impossible to do
  that&mdash;impossible...And as for Browdley&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She watched him in gentle silence, and he saw the future dissolving into
  new backgrounds of such impossibilities. He felt as if he were sitting in the
  stalls of a theatre, seeing the curtain rise on the strangest and newest of
  plays, the play of the life which he himself had yet to live. He returned her
  gaze incredulously, and the thought came to him: Every day and night for so
  many years I have praised God with my lips, but now for the first time I
  praise Him with all my heart. He sank into a chair, silenced with
  thankfulness, and she came to him then; she sat on the arm of the chair and
  drew his head against her small firm bosom. &ldquo;How tired you must be,
  Howat,&rdquo; she whispered. That enchantment of her bodily nearness soothed
  him; he did feel tired, but somehow eager as well, and he knew that he could
  rest, because she understood utterly both his eagerness and his tiredness. He
  closed his eyes and visions crowded on him&mdash;of music and painting and
  poetry and all the beauty of line and contour; a hundred sensuous images took
  meaning, while tunes raced through his mind with sharp unlooked-for
  harmonies; the whole world seemed on fire about him, while he, at its centre,
  found peace on the breast of this girl. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go back,&rdquo;
  he stammered, huskily. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t...Do you realise that? Do you
  realise what you&rsquo;ve done?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;ve done to you what you&rsquo;ve done to me, then
  I&rsquo;m glad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t go back now! Do you realise that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To your hotel? Well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. You can stay here. We
  can talk. I&rsquo;m not sleepy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s more than that I mean. Much more.
  I&rsquo;m thinking of Browdley...Oh, Elizabeth, I wish I&rsquo;d known you
  years and years ago!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Before I was born, that would have been!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. It&rsquo;s monstrous, I admit&mdash;a child like you
  and a man of my age. With a wife&mdash;children&mdash;and&mdash;and a chapel!
  My God, a chapel&mdash;think of that! Tell me, how much does all this mean to
  you? How long will it last? I want to know&mdash;is it just a fancy&mdash;the
  sort of thing you feel in the mood for after Brahms? How much exactly does it
  mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She touched his forehead and then his hair with &rsquo;her fingertips.
  &ldquo;Everything, Howat. There&rsquo;s only one thought in my mind, and
  that&rsquo;s how much I could be to you if you wanted me. Howat, I&rsquo;m
  not afraid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;re not afraid!</i>&rdquo; He drew her to him
  exultantly and kissed her in the flush of splendour that her words had
  evoked. &ldquo;Elizabeth, do you mean that-absolutely? You strange
  girl&mdash;you&rsquo;re so cool and calm all the time, and it&rsquo;s all so
  marvellous&mdash;the most marvellous thing that&rsquo;s ever happened to me.
  Do you think I could dare to let it go now?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not if you feel certain that it&rsquo;s everything.
  <i>I&rsquo;m</i> certain, in my own case, because I&rsquo;ve never felt
  anything like it before. That makes it so simple. But you, of
  course&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And do you think I ever have, either?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She gave him a single fearless glance that made him certain that there was
  nothing in his life beyond her instant comprehension. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t
  you?&rdquo; she said softly, and he shook his head, knowing that she would
  understand how true it was. Never before had there been in him this curious
  ache that made him feel almost raw with tenderness at the sight of her
  fingers stretched out on the arm of the chair or the delicate curving of her
  nostril or the little side-tooth that wasn&rsquo;t quite in line with the
  others. He said, abruptly: &ldquo;You were right when you said I&rsquo;ve not
  been happy. I&rsquo;ve had some bad times. Did you ever hear about my two
  boys? One died when he was twelve&mdash;he would have been clever, I think,
  especially at music. The other, the elder, wasn&rsquo;t so clever, but he was
  a dear fellow&mdash;a bit wild at times, but there was no harm in
  him&mdash;oh, no real harm at all. He didn&rsquo;t like Browdley, and he was
  rather bored at home&mdash;we got him a job in a bank, but he wouldn&rsquo;t
  stay&mdash;he went off to Canada then&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t had any letter
  for three years. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll see him again sometime.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You were very fond of him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He added, fiercely: &ldquo;He went off because he
  couldn&rsquo;t stand it. The routine of the bank, and then the routine of
  home life&mdash;the chapel services and everything else&mdash;I can see now,
  I ought to have taken his part more than I did. He told me, before he left,
  that he couldn&rsquo;t stand it. And I can&rsquo;t stand it now, either. The
  very thought of it turns me cold&mdash;to leave you and go back to that
  life&mdash;my God, I <i>can&rsquo;t</i> do it, Elizabeth. Do you think I
  ought to?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you think I want you to?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But ought I&mdash;<i>ought</i> I?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m ever sure what other people ought to
  do, Howat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That being more in my line of business, eh?&rdquo; He laughed
  sharply. &ldquo;It used to be, but it isn&rsquo;t any more. I&rsquo;ve found
  myself out. I see my chance now, just as you see yours. I want to take
  it&mdash;oh, I want to take it so much&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I want everything that <i>you</i> want&mdash;everything you
  could possibly want.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I want <i>you</i>&mdash;I want&mdash;oh, my darling, we&rsquo;ve
  only our two lives and they belong to us more than to any other
  person&mdash;shall we <i>run</i> for those lives of ours?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know what you mean, Howat. I feel it, too&mdash;I feel it just
  like that&mdash;it&rsquo;s curious and rather dreadful, yet it makes me very
  happy.&rdquo; She stooped and laid her cheek against his. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
  thought of it all, as well as you&mdash;probably long before you did, really
  even to working out details. During dinner while we were talking I kept
  thinking of it all, though it seemed such absolute nonsense then.&rdquo; She
  smiled and went on softly: &ldquo;I was imagining the two of us in Vienna
  together. Some big comfortable room with a piano in it, where you could
  compose when you felt in the mood, and I could fiddle away. And again later
  on, while I was making the coffee, I thought of it&mdash;a room perhaps
  something like this, though with a real fire for preference, and all kinds of
  interesting people dropping in at odd times to see us, and then afterwards,
  when they&rsquo;d gone, being by ourselves&mdash;and drinking
  coffee&mdash;and talking&mdash;oh, plenty of talk&mdash;there&rsquo;d always
  be that, wouldn&rsquo;t there? Howat, I can see it just exactly as it ought
  to be&mdash;why couldn&rsquo;t it all happen to us?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He turned to her with a look of worship; he too was entranced by the
  imagined picture of that room, and as for the music he would compose, it was
  in his cars already. &ldquo;It shall happen,&rdquo; he whispered, and there
  stole over him again that divine tenderness for her, making him aware, even
  had he not earlier guessed it, that there was still something more; it was
  not enough to have found the meaning of love, since on the very crest of
  discovery a further peak swung into view.</p>

  <p>He kissed her and whispered again, with this new certainty of desire:
  &ldquo;It shall happen,&rdquo; and felt her tears warm and then cool upon his
  face.</p>

  <p>Later he began to tell her about his early life at Kimbourne...</p>

  <p>It was early in the century when he had first arrived there. He was
  sixteen then, a tall thin youth wearing a grammar-school cap of exuberant
  hues that aroused the liveliest conjectures in the little Kentish village.
  His father, after losing money in rash speculation, had been killed in the
  South African War, and his mother had survived her husband by barely a year,
  having tried vainly in the meantime to retrieve the family fortunes by
  running a seaside boarding-house. The lawyer who wound up the estate had not
  known quite what to do with Howat; he thought him a nice-looking and
  decently-educated youth, but rather young to be flung into the world entirely
  on his own; clearly it would be a good thing if he could be got into a family
  for a few years; he would probably earn his keep, at least, as soon as he was
  put to work. It so happened that about that time the lawyer was visiting a
  client of his, a Mr. Coverdale, who was noted as a very religious and
  philanthropic person; he mentioned Howat&rsquo;s case, and Coverdale
  suggested that the boy should come along to Kimbourne, at any rate for a
  short holiday.</p>

  <p>Howat walked from the station on a blazing June afternoon.
  Coverdale&rsquo;s house was about a mile out of the village a pleasant
  detached property with verandahs and low windows and a big garden full of
  flowers; the path from the garden gate to the porch was through an avenue of
  tall hollyhocks. Howat was hot from the walk, and he was also very shy. The
  house seemed grand to him after the miserable boarding-house basement, and he
  felt shyer than ever when a rather plump and cheerful-looking woman
  introduced herself as Mrs. Coverdale and asked him if he had had tea. He said
  no, and she took him into a room which, to his rather faltering eyes at that
  first sight of it, seemed entirely full of girls.</p>

  <p>There were, indeed, seven of them, and they were presented one after
  another. Howat was struck almost completely dumb; he had never had anything
  to do with girls, and didn&rsquo;t know in the least what to say to them. He
  merely answered their questions when they asked if the train had been late,
  and whether he liked the hot summer; for the rest of the time he sat silent
  and uncomfortable. They chattered loudly all around him, and he wondered if
  it would be very rude to ask permission to go to his bedroom and wash, but he
  was too nervous to do so, and he actually made up his mind to run away to
  London the following morning after breakfast. Soon, however, the girls
  disappeared in ones and twos, leaving him alone with Mrs. Coverdale. He was
  not so nervous with her; she had a very genial and easygoing manner, and
  asked him scores of questions about himself, what his tastes were, what
  subjects he had liked best at school, and so on. He told her he liked music,
  and she said: &ldquo;Ah, Mr. Coverdale will want you to play the harmonium
  this evening, then.&rdquo; The thought of that made him nervous again, and he
  wished he had said nothing at all about music.</p>

  <p>Towards seven o&rsquo;clock a mysterious imminence made itself felt in the
  atmosphere; there was a good deal of scurrying about on the part of the seven
  girls, and at a certain moment one of them, who had apparently been looking
  out of an upstairs window, called out: &ldquo;Father&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo; A
  few moments later a rather elderly man, grey-haired but very upright, walked
  briskly between the two rows of hollyhocks and entered the house. He kissed
  his wife and each one of his daughters very loudly, and then, on being made
  aware of Howat&rsquo;s presence, said gruffly: &ldquo;How do you do, my
  boy?&rdquo; and shook hands with him. After that he led the way to the
  dining-room and said a slow and solemn grace. There was little talking during
  the meal; sometimes he made a remark to which someone gave answer, but there
  was none of the chatter that had made the tea-table so noisy, and even Mrs.
  Coverdale did not seem in such an easy-going mood.</p>

  <p>Afterwards she mentioned that Ho wat had confessed to being
  &lsquo;musical,&rsquo; and sure enough, Mr. Coverdale suggested that he
  should &lsquo;play a tune&rsquo; on the harmonium. For this purpose he was
  conducted into a very primly furnished drawing-room, full of stuffed birds
  and china ornaments; he was terribly nervous with all the family crowding
  round him, and more especially because he had never played a harmonium
  before. At first he failed to realise that he had to work the pedals, and
  even when he had made this important discovery he found that some of the
  notes wouldn&rsquo;t sound, and that a rather rapid Chopin study hardly
  suited the peculiarities of the instrument. He made what he felt to be a
  complete hash of the whole thing, but to his surprise and relief everyone
  appeared delighted, and Mr. Coverdale even went so far as to thank him in a
  deep booming voice.</p>

  <p>A fortnight later it was somehow or other settled that Howat&rsquo;s
  holiday should not come to an end in the normal way, but that he should take
  up a permanent position in the Coverdale household.</p>

  <p>Mr. Coverdale, indeed, thought the boy might &lsquo;do pretty well&rsquo;,
  and this, from such a source, was high enough praise. He had been a little
  prejudiced against him at first for having been brought up &rsquo;Church of
  England&rsquo;, but he soon found that the boy was intelligent,
  well-mannered, and ready to work hard. Mr. Cover-dale owned a saw- mill and
  timber-yard adjoining Kimbourne station, and it was not difficult to find
  ways in which the boy, by working eight or nine hours a day, could thoroughly
  earn the weekly half-crown which, in addition to his keep, became his initial
  wage.</p>

  <p>Mr. Coverdale was a strict employer, but he was a strict man altogether;
  he neither drank nor smoked; he would literally have shrunk from touching a
  pack of cards; and his dislike of strong language went so far as to bring
  even such phrases as &lsquo;good heavens&rsquo; under the ban. Every Sunday,
  without fail, he preached long and lugubriously eloquent sermons in little
  dissenting chapels scattered over the surrounding districts; some of these
  engagements involved journeys of ten or a dozen miles, and he would always
  make these on foot and in all weathers, disdaining even to saddle a horse,
  much less to make use of the unhallowed Sunday train service. Fortunately, he
  was a man of strong constitution and excellent physique; it was his boast,
  made with due thankfulness, that he had never had a day&rsquo;s illness in
  his life.</p>

  <p>Howat did not dislike him even from the beginning, and soon came to be
  quite comfortable at Kimbourne. After a week or so he knew all the girls by
  sight and by name, though he was still rather nervous of them; the eldest,
  Lavinia, was hardly a girl at all; she was twenty-four, which seemed to him
  an immense age. It was Lavinia who kept the others in order, but Howat, if
  his shyness permitted him to have any active preferences at all, liked the
  younger ones better; the youngest of all was Mary, aged fifteen. He felt
  rather more drawn to Mary because she was only a &lsquo;kid&rsquo;, and was a
  good deal bullied by the elder girls.</p>

  <p>Life would really have been very pleasant, but for Sunday, which came as a
  day of gloom after the comparatively cheerful activities of the working week.
  On Sunday no newspapers or ordinary books were allowed to be read, though if
  Mr. Coverdale&rsquo;s preaching engagements were at a distance it was
  sometimes possible to persuade Mrs. Coverdale to unlock the bookcase after he
  had gone. When, however, as very often happened he was occupied locally, the
  day progressed from morn to evening according to a most rigid routine. The
  whole family trooped out twice to the bleak little chapel at the Dover end of
  the village and filled up the pew immediately under the pulpit. Howat usually
  sat at one end and Mrs. Coverdale at the other, with the seven girls in
  between. He did not exactly enjoy the services, which seemed to him cold and
  uninteresting compared with the ones he had been used to, but there were
  times when Mr. Coverdale&rsquo;s rough eloquence stirred him to a vague
  self-scrutiny; and in any case, he always liked the singing, for he was
  beginning to develop a good voice and enjoyed using it. Then one Sunday the
  organist failed to appear, and Howat was asked, in an emergency, to play the
  hymns. He did so, fairly well, and when, some months later, the organist
  died, the boy was officially appointed in his place.</p>

  <p>It was only an old and very wheezy American harmonium, but in it Howat
  found something to make Sunday a day to look forward to; he enjoyed
  particularly the opening and closing voluntaries, which gave him a chance of
  showing what he could do. Usually he played one or other of the simple pieces
  that had been left behind by the previous organist, but one morning, in a
  mood of great daring, he ignored the music sheet before him and made up
  something of his own as he went along. Rather to his astonishment no one
  complained or even appeared to notice any departure from the normal; and thus
  emboldened, he made a fairly regular habit of such improvisations. He did
  not, though, tell anyone about it.</p>

  <p>After be had been at Kimbourne a year Mr. Coverdale increased his wage to
  ten shillings a week, and declared himself &rsquo;quite satisfied with
  him.</p>

  <p>Those were the years when Howat was growing up, and when every month,
  almost every day, marked new and noticeable development. He was a rather
  quiet boy, good-looking in a thoughtful way, and he had very fine and
  striking eyes. He was not, however, particularly observant or knowledgeable,
  or he would have been aware that at least three of the Coverdale girls were
  head over ears in love with him. Lavinia, the eldest, considered she had a
  prior right to any attachment he might eventually make, and there were
  frequent quarrels between her and her sisters on this account. Howat, in
  fact, treated them all with complete impartiality, except that Mary, as still
  something of a kid, was admitted to more casual intimacies.</p>

  <p>Howat&rsquo;s chief thoughts at this time were all on one
  subject&mdash;music. Since his very earliest days he had been entranced by
  tunes, and now, with advancing youth, the desire to explore the magic world
  of harmony became speedily a passion. After the discovery that he could
  improvise, he seriously set himself to study the technique of composition;
  and most evenings, if he had time to spare, he would go to the harmonium in
  the drawing- room and try over invented tunes of his own. The family believed
  him to be &lsquo;practising&rsquo;, but at last the secret had to come out.
  He had submitted a song in a competition run by a musical journal, and had
  received the second prize of a guinea. The cheque arrived one morning at
  breakfast-time, and his delight was quite impossible to hide. When they all
  learned the truth, they were rather mystified; it seemed odd to them that
  Howat should have been able to pick up actual money in such a peculiar
  way.</p>

  <p>One effect the disclosure had was to remove any further need for secrecy;
  henceforth all Howat&rsquo;s musical work was carried on openly. Some of the
  girls had mediocre voices, and Howat sometimes composed songs for them; but
  this was never much of a success, and the girls only bothered about it
  because they enjoyed the intimacy with Howat which trying over the songs
  involved. Even Lavinia, who had no voice at all, tried to develop one so as
  not to be at a disadvantage in this respect.</p>

  <p>Howat was happy enough. He had come gradually to like as well as to
  respect Mr. Coverdale, and the old man, in his turn, had begun to feel for
  the boy an affection all the deeper because he had always wished for a son of
  his own. The family did nit know, and would perhaps hardly have credited, the
  terms upon which the two worked together at the timber-yard. Howat&rsquo;s
  job had developed into a sort of informal private secretaryship, but there
  was not always much work of that sort to be done, and sometimes in the
  afternoons they would sit together in the little matchboard office amidst the
  smells of glue and sawdust and hold most solemn discussions. There was
  something very impressive about the old man; with his white bushy hair and
  bright almost jet- black eyes, he looked rather like Howat&rsquo;s conception
  of an Old Testament patriarch. Howat soon perceived that the saw-mill and
  timber-yard were utterly secondary considerations with him; he ran them
  efficiently and conscientiously &rsquo;enough, but his real interest in life,
  and more and more as he was growing older, was religion. There was no
  doubting the sincerity of that religion, or that it was vastly more than a
  one-day-a-week affair. It steeped Coverdale&rsquo;s whole life, not precisely
  in happiness, but in a sort of wild and stupendous triumph. Once when Howat
  heard a certain theme of Beethoven&rsquo;s he thought instantly that it
  reminded him of Coverdale&rsquo;s attitude.</p>

  <p>Howat was always very sensitive and impressionable, and the fervent
  booming eloquence of the old man, both publicly and in private, easily
  stirred him emotionally. Coverdale had, indeed, a noble though undisciplined
  command over English; he could paint the joys of heaven and the pains of hell
  in language which filled Howat&rsquo;s mind like great chords of music. The
  girls were all apparently unmoved by it, but often when Howat raised his head
  in chapel at the close of one of Coverdale&rsquo;s long prayers, his eyes
  were dim with tears. He always felt that the prayers had been framed to apply
  to himself personally, and though he knew that this was absurd, he could not
  get the idea out of his mind.</p>

  <p>One day a curious incident took place at the saw-mill. A workman had been
  censured by Mr. Coverdale for using bad language; Coverdale had had him up in
  the office and, in Howat&rsquo;s hearing, had delivered a long and impressive
  harangue on the sinfulness of such conduct and on the possibility that
  Providence might inflict sudden and condign punishment on anyone guilty of
  it. A few minutes after the man had returned to his work loud screams sounded
  from the saw-mill; Howat and Coverdale both rushed down, and found that the
  offending machinist had had all the fingers of one hand taken off by the
  circular saw. After he had been removed to hospital, Howat fainted; the sight
  had been too much for him; and when he recovered he saw Coverdale kneeling by
  his side with a fiercely triumphant light in his eyes. He was convinced that
  Providence had spoken through the medium of the ghastly affair, and into
  Howat&rsquo;s ears he poured there and then a terrific exposition of his own
  religious feelings and convictions. It was then that he told Howat that he
  prayed every night that the boy might &lsquo;get&rsquo; religion as he had
  &lsquo;got&rsquo; it, and might come to realise that there were more serious
  things in life than experimenting with little bits of tunes. Howat was
  touched and moved by the revelation that Coverdale thought so much about him
  and his future; and when the old man suggested that they should both pray
  aloud and in turn for the quick recovery of the injured workman, Howat, who
  was in a rather dazed mood, agreed. After a little preliminary nervousness
  when it came to his turn, he found that the words sprang to his lips quite
  fluently; he had listened to so much of Coverdale&rsquo;s eloquence that mere
  imitativeness, if nothing else, could have carried him along. He found the
  experience rather exhilarating in a way; he enjoyed the consciousness of
  control over language; it was rather like the first zestful sensation of
  riding a bicycle. When he had finished Coverdale signified a grave approval;
  he was convinced, from that moment, that the boy was destined to be the means
  of saving innumerable souls.</p>

  <p>Gradually, after that, and to a degree that Howat hardly realised,
  Coverdale&rsquo;s influence over him deepened and became more dominating. The
  day came when Coverdale at last persuaded him to use his &rsquo;gift of
  tongues&rsquo; in public; he was very reluctant, but at last consented. It
  was a meeting held in the chapel schoolroom to raise funds for a new organ,
  and Howat, as organist, felt that there was some small excuse if he chose to
  say a few words on such an occasion. When he first stood up before that
  audience of forty odd people he was so nervous he could scarcely enunciate a
  word; his mouth began to twitch; and Lavinia&rsquo;s eyes, staring at him
  from the front row, seemed to transfix him into stupor. He did, however,
  manage at last to begin, and after a few halting sentences found himself
  escaping into some extraordinary upper air in which words came pouring on
  him, copiously and without effort. He spoke for ten minutes, and those ten
  minutes established his fame far more thoroughly than any of his tunes had
  done. The family, in particular, were thrilled to the point of hero-worship.
  They had never been able to comprehend the significance of his musical
  activities, but his eloquence, modelled on that of Mr. Coverdale, but
  delivered with such a refreshingly youthful and pleasant-sounding voice,
  seemed to them convincingly successful.</p>

  <p>He was nineteen then, and a youth for whom in that little world of
  Kimbourne, the future seemed large with promise. There was a world, however,
  beyond Kimbourne, which he still privately inhabited, and even this world, to
  some extent, gave him encouragement. He bought himself a violin, and learned
  to play it moderately well; but it was not so much his intention to become a
  skilled executant as to master the technical possibilities of stringed
  instruments. In that twentieth year he began to compose pieces for violin and
  piano; he even tried his hand at trios and quartets, and a string quartet of
  his actually won a ten-pound prize at a London musical festival, and was
  performed once at a special concert. Kimbourne knew little of this, and the
  family, though they knew, were much less interested in it than in the verbal
  eloquence with which Howat could occasionally be persuaded to deluge them.
  For his successful first speech had naturally led to others, even to short
  addresses in the chapel; he found that he rather liked talking in public when
  once he got over the initial nervousness that always assailed him; it was the
  same sort of enjoyment that he derived from improvising on the organ or on
  the schoolroom piano to which he now had permanent access&mdash;all his
  speeches were, in a sense, improvisations on a theme. Success did not make
  him conceited, though he was human enough to enjoy sometimes the fulsome
  flatteries that were showered upon him; he was still very shy and rather
  unapproachable by strangers. But it was true, in a literal way, that he liked
  the sound of his own voice; and no wonder, for that voice, both in talking
  and singing, was a vibrant baritone which perfectly matched a face of
  singularly tender and thoughtful handsomeness. All the Coverdale girls were
  now more or less in love with him, even including Mary, and he was still
  entirely unaware of it. Even the prettiest girls in the village (which the
  Coverdale girls certainly were not) found him disappointingly aloof and
  unsusceptible.</p>

  <p>At last he made a further surrender to Cover-dale&rsquo;s fervent
  pleading, and conducted a whole Sunday service&mdash;prayers, sermon, hymns,
  organ voluntaries, everything. As a one-man show it would in any case have
  been a noteworthy exhibition of versatility; but it was actually much more
  than that&mdash;so much more that it is possibly remembered to this day by
  some of the older inhabitants of Kimbourne. It happened that a massacre of
  workmen had just taken place in St. Petersburg, and Howat&rsquo;s sermon was
  a spirited attack on autocracy which brought the small assembly dangerously
  near to cheering point; Coverdale felt that there should have been more
  religion in it, but as a strong Liberal in politics, he could not but approve
  of the boy&rsquo;s sentiments. One effect of this rather astonishing outburst
  was to attract the attention of the local Liberal party organisers, and
  during the general election campaign a year later Howat made many speeches
  throughout the constituencies. By that time he had become a recognised local
  preacher, and the chapels in which he preached were always crowded with folk
  who came, many of them, to savour the novelty of a youth of twenty who could,
  as was said, &rsquo;let go as well as all the rest of them put
  together&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>Coverdale&rsquo;s dream was now that Howat should ascend to far loftier
  pinnacles than that of mere preaching in country chapels. He saw in the boy a
  coming Spurgeon, and he wished him to have all the benefits that the
  completest religious training could provide. His idea was that Howat should
  spend a few years at a college for prospective ministers, and then astonish
  the world by eloquence made more tumultuous than ever by means of
  book-learning; the old man, whose education had been entirely self-acquired,
  had a pathetically simple belief in the efficacy of study and collegiate
  life. To Howat, however, the whole idea did not especially appeal; he was not
  keen on becoming a full-time professional minister, nor did he wish to give
  up helping Coverdale at the saw- mill. He liked sermonising as a sort of
  hobby, but he was not sure that he wanted more of it than that. A good many
  of his friends, too, were urging him to take up a political career, and
  several constituencies were nibbling at him as a prospective Liberal
  candidate for the next election.</p>

  <p>Then, quite suddenly, Coverdale had a slight stroke. For the first time in
  his life he had to resign himself to the ways of a semi-invalid; the doctor
  said he would probably recover, but would never be the same again, and would
  certainly have to sacrifice the cast-iron routine to which his life had up to
  then been dedicated. To Coverdale this meant only one thing; he would have to
  give up the saw-mill, since he would not, while there was breath in him,
  neglect his religious duties. Unfortunately Howat, though a hard and willing
  worker, had no aptitude for business and could not, it was clear, take on the
  job of management; but at that time, as it chanced, the profits were
  considerable, and it was not hard to obtain a satisfactory offer of purchase
  from a big joinery firm in Maidstone. The deal was put through; the Coverdale
  family found themselves with some thousands of pounds comfortably invested in
  gilt-edged securities, and Howat, of course, was out of a job.</p>

  <p>That was in May of the year in which he had turned twenty-one. Coverdale,
  now a retired gentleman, passed most of his time at home, greatly to the
  family&rsquo;s discomfort; the immense seriousness of the problems of life
  and death weighed upon him more heavily than ever. He bought quantities of
  theological literature and studied it in a rather uncomprehending way; his
  mind was not attuned to subtleties, but he felt that the books would be very
  useful to Howat when he went to college. He had quite made up his mind that
  the boy should go, and Howat, with nothing else immediately in prospect, was
  also beginning to let such a future be taken for granted. Term began the
  following September, and the college, with which Coverdale had been in
  communication, had already signified its willingness to accept so promising
  an entrant.</p>

  <p>But towards the end of June Howat went up to London for a concert; it
  would finish too late for him to return the same night, so he put up at a
  little hotel in Southampton Row which had been recommended him as cheap. It
  was the first time he had ever stayed overnight in London, and he was rather
  thrilled at being so completely on his own. The concert was not a public one;
  it was given by the students at a college of music, and Howat had been sent a
  ticket by a friend. A few men and girl students played Mozart and Haydn
  chamber music, not very marvellously, but with much enthusiasm, and
  afterwards there were ham sandwiches and lemonade and informal chatter round
  the piano. Howat got into conversation with several youths and was invited to
  join a party in somebody&rsquo;s rooms in St. John&rsquo;s Wood, close by; he
  went, and stayed there front eleven until the party broke up about three in
  the morning. As usual he was very shy at first, but after a time he found
  himself talking and discussing with the rest, and he even played over on the
  piano one or two of his own compositions, which were admired, though not
  excessively. A rather elderly man, well-known as a critic on a weekly paper,
  led him aside, however, and asked him if he intended to take up music
  composition seriously. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to give you a swelled
  head,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I think your stuff shows a certain amount of
  promise.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That night, as he walked from St. John&rsquo;s Wood to his hotel, with the
  first glimmer of dawn streaking the eastern sky, Howat saw the future clearly
  enough. He did not want to be a minister. He did not want to go into
  politics. His overwhelming triumphs in the pulpit and on the platform seemed
  tame and petty things compared with the very moderate amount of success he
  had so far achieved in the realm of music. He hated himself for having
  already wasted so much time. He felt that there was only one thing in life he
  could do, with any honesty of purpose; and that was to devote himself to the
  work that he loved, whether it would eventually bring success or not.</p>

  <p>When he arrived at Kimbourne he made this decision known to Coverdale. He
  had guessed that the latter would be extremely disappointed, but he had
  scarcely been prepared for such a storm as ensued. Still less had he
  conceived it possible that Coverdale, in the heat of his excited protests,
  would have another and more serious stroke, rendering him speechless and
  partly paralysed.</p>

  <p>During the days that followed, Howat spent hours at the old man&rsquo;s
  bedside, stared at by quivering eyes that now, in default of words, had to
  perform the whole function of expression. Howat was stirred as he had been
  years before, on the occasion of the saw-mill accident; only now he felt a
  personal remorse; he knew that he had given Coverdale what might prove a
  deathblow. The odd thing was that no one else knew this; no one had heard the
  argument; no one suspected that Howat had changed his mind about the training
  college. If only the others had known all about it, Howat could have defended
  himself; after all, it hadn&rsquo;t been really his fault&mdash;surely he had
  a right to please himself about his own future. But as he watched Coverdale
  through so many hours, he began to be oppressed with an emotion profounder
  than such comforting assurances; he began to doubt whether, after all, he had
  done right in flouting the old man&rsquo;s wishes; and he heard again, as in
  a dream, the Beethovian chords that stood for the grandeur and magnificence
  of Coverdale&rsquo;s beliefs. Remorse blackened and deepened upon him, and
  one afternoon, alone by the bedside, he was so moved that he knelt down, took
  Coverdale&rsquo;s hand, and asked for forgiveness. He would go to college, he
  said, and would become a minister. The look in Coverdale&rsquo;s eyes,
  instant and revealing, came to him then as a directly approving answer from
  Providence.</p>

  <p>A kind of frenzy swept over Howat during that summer. He was definitely
  booked to enter college in September, and in the meantime he sought, with
  every atom of strength that was in him, to make amends for the harm he
  reckoned himself to have done. His sermons and prayers in the little chapels
  rose to impassioned intensity; he gave up all his political work, and took a
  leading part in an evangelist revival that was being conducted in the
  district. All this was reported to Coverdale and so encouraged his partial
  recovery that by August he was able to speak again, though slowly and with
  difficulty. His first words were to utter a prayer of thankfulness that Howat
  had at last &lsquo;seen the light&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>Howat, in fact, was in an almost hysterically emotional condition and
  overworked himself dangerously; he discontinued all his music composition
  because he found that the revival he was assisting in left him no time for
  it; yet somehow, rather to his dismay, he discovered that he could not escape
  it altogether; casual airs and tunes often obsessed him when he walked hone
  at evening across starlit fields; all kinds of things, moreover, seemed to
  excite him emotionally in a way he had never exactly experienced
  before&mdash;the sight of sunset over the long ridge of the Downs, the
  distant hoot of a steamer entering harbour at night, the smell of hay in the
  noonday lanes. Sometimes at twilight he passed lovers strolling side by side,
  and though they presented no novel phenomenon, he was aware of them now, for
  the first time, as part of the strange insurgent problem to which only
  religion, he felt, could supply an answer. He was dimly conscious that love
  must be a very lofty and spiritual thing, and he was sure that if he ever
  loved a woman, it would be in such a way.</p>

  <p>Mary was then almost twenty. He had always been more intimate with her
  than with any of her sisters, some of whom he now almost disliked; they were
  silly, he had discovered, and shirked the main seriousness of life. Three,
  anyhow, had definitely given up all hopes of him and had accepted the
  attentions of other young men; Howat would occasionally find them loitering
  in the garden late at night, caressing and being caressed in a manner which
  seemed to him unnecessary as well as disagreeable. Lavinia was still
  unattached; she was too busy about the house to have time for that sort of
  thing, she said; for now Mrs. Coverdale also was in failing health, and a
  good deal of domestic responsibility fell on the eldest girl. Fortunately she
  was the type that could well shoulder it&mdash;a brisk, managing young woman,
  hardworking and capable, except that she did not cook very well. Howat now
  liked her perhaps best of the lot, next to Mary.</p>

  <p>He liked Mary because, of all the seven, she was the only one who appeared
  to him in any way spiritual. Formerly he had appreciated her as a
  &lsquo;kid&rsquo;; now it was as if at one clear bound she had acquired
  womanhood, but womanhood of a rather special kind. Even physically she was
  marked out from the rest; she had none of that tendency to plumpness that was
  a family trait. Really, she was not at all strong; she was nervous (Howat was
  nervous, too), and little things often upset her in a way that drew his
  particular sympathy. Moreover, she was deeply interested in his religious
  work; she attended all his meetings and services most assiduously, and during
  homeward walks she talked earnestly, if a shade ingenuously, about the more
  momentous concerns of life. On the night before he left for college, after a
  very prolonged and emotional talk with Mr. Coverdale, he asked her calmly if
  she would marry him when he had finished his training, and she answered,
  instantly but with equal calmness, that she would...</p>

  <p>Most of this, so far as he was able to recollect it, Howat told Elizabeth
  as they sat by the studio fire throughout that November night.</p>

  <p>About five o&rsquo;clock they wakened after fitfully dozing in
  armchairs...</p>

  <p>She prepared a small meal (they were far too excited to be very hungry),
  and by dawn were in the streets. It was bitterly cold, and there was a bleak,
  scouring easterly wind with a hint of snow in it. Everything had been planned
  and discussed; it only remained to put into execution all the strange things
  that had been decided on. The first Howat did without delay; he called at his
  hotel, retrieved his luggage, paid the bill for the room, and gave the
  proprietress (who was not really interested) some shadowy reason for not
  having occupied it. So much had been easy, but the next thing, though it
  seemed at first only a detail, gave much more trouble&mdash;the question of
  passports for the journey. Elizabeth had hers, of course, but Howat did not
  possess one at all, and the matter proved full of complications. He had the
  necessary photographs taken at a shop in the Strand as soon as it opened, but
  then came the business of having them endorsed by someone who knew him. He
  rushed to Blenkiron, in Wimpole Street, but found the doctor had gone away
  for the week-end; failing him, and after much cogitation, the nearest person
  he could think of was a minister, living near Kettering, whom he had not seen
  for six years. It meant a journey, but it had to be done, and he would
  probably be back in time to have the passport made out before the office
  closed that afternoon&mdash;then they could cross by the night boat and be in
  Paris the following morning.</p>

  <p>It was settled that they should go to Kettering together, because they
  were in the mood of children; to have been separated even for those few hours
  would have seemed intolerable to both. They were wildly excited, but she,
  beyond her excitement, was calm enough to remember all the details of what
  had to be done; though it was he, perhaps, who was in the bigger hurry to get
  through them all. In the bus to the station he talked and laughed in sheer
  high spirits; he was a little drowsy, but it was the rapturous drowsiness of
  a small boy awakened early for some gloriously anticipated outing.</p>

  <p>They caught the nine-fifty express with a few minutes to spare, and as
  soon as they were settled for the journey, in a compartment which they had to
  themselves, an attendant asked if they would take breakfast. Howat did not
  need to look long for her answer; they were both, it appeared, exceedingly
  hungry.</p>

  <p>They passed along the corridors to the restaurant car and there commenced
  what Howat felt to be altogether the most delightful meal of his life. A thin
  film of snow had fallen during the night, enough just to cover the fields and
  roofs; bright sunshine struck tints of saffron into the pallor and a delicate
  unearthly glow came flooding into the train through the wide windows. As he
  watched her, he saw that it had turned her face to golden-brown; she looked
  lovelier to him than ever, and it was as if he were bathing all his nerves in
  that soothing loveliness. Even his sore throat, which had returned somewhat,
  he could now regard with toleration if not affection.</p>

  <p>He was happy in an almost foolish way; he kept laughing and chattering and
  then falling half-asleep for a moment; and the smallest and most trivial
  things gave him infinite pleasure&mdash;because, for instance, he found he
  could have fish for breakfast as an alternative to eggs and bacon his eyes
  glistened like a child&rsquo;s. He felt, indeed, that in some secret way he
  had got back to childhood, that he was facing all life afresh, and with no
  anxiety save lest the years he was escaping from might somehow turn in
  pursuit. For the sake of that instinct rather than reason, he was feverishly
  eager to begin everything; he wanted to cross the Channel that night if it
  could possibly be managed, and she kept comforting him by talking about it
  and about the rest of the journey they would have. She was concerned for his
  tiredness and would gladly have spent another night in London, but he was
  passionately determined; and when she asked if he would not find three
  successive nights without proper rest rather fatiguing, he only laughed and
  answered: &ldquo;I shall be perfectly happy on the train, unless you happen
  to know some kind friends in Paris who&rsquo;ve gone off for the week-end and
  left their studio vacant.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That put them both in a mood of ecstatic recollection. &ldquo;Oh yes,
  wasn&rsquo;t it extraordinary? Will you ever forget it, Howat? Even if I were
  never to see you again, I know I&rsquo;d remember last night better than
  anything else that could ever happen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, so would I. That curious way the clock stopped at seventeen
  minutes to four. Did you notice it? I suppose it was the sort that needs
  winding every night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We might really have wound it ourselves, mightn&rsquo;t
  we?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It would only have gone on for another twenty-four
  hours.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Till we were over in France, perhaps.&rdquo; And there they were,
  back again at the irresistible topic. &ldquo;We reach Dieppe about three in
  the morning, don&rsquo;t we? It&rsquo;s the cheapest route, and I don&rsquo;t
  mind a long crossing. At least I think I don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve been abroad
  once before, but only to Paris. We get there towards breakfast-time, I think.
  What shall we do if we have a few hours to spare? Have you been to Paris
  ever?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Once, years ago. I had the usual tourist&rsquo;s week. We&rsquo;ll
  stroll along the Boulevards, if it isn&rsquo;t too cold, and drink beer
  outside a caf.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And then we go through Switzerland, don&rsquo;t we, into Austria?
  I&rsquo;ve never seen high mountains before. We go through Zrich and
  Innsbrck and Salzburg. What shall we do as soon as we get to
  Vienna?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Drive straight to the best hotel&mdash;if they&rsquo;ll have
  anything to do with us when they see our luggage. We&rsquo;ll afford it, for
  one day, anyhow. Then the morning after we&rsquo;ll search for that big room
  with the piano in it. And also, by the way, I shall have to buy some shirts
  and things. I won&rsquo;t have time in London to-night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What <i>fun</i> it&rsquo;s all going to be, Howat, as well as
  everything else!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Just then they became aware of the grinding of brakes on the train-
  wheels, and she said, getting up: &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re slowing down for
  somewhere. We mustn&rsquo;t forget we&rsquo;ve left things in the
  compartment&mdash;it&rsquo;s not the coats that matter, but those passport
  papers in the pocket of yours are really too precious...perhaps I&rsquo;d
  better dash back and make sure that they&rsquo;re safe.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He answered: &ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll attend to the bill and follow
  you along in a moment...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded smilingly and left him signalling to the waiter. Those were the
  last words he ever spoke to her.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="epi"
     name="epi">EPILOGUE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">One April evening Ringwood sat sipping his whisky and water
  in a very characteristic attitude. He was balancing himself on the edge of
  his pedestal desk, with his legs dangling and kicking the drawers, and his
  eyes directed over the edge of the tumbler in a rather quizzical stare. It
  was a favourite pose, though instead of a tumbler he would more usually hold
  up a medicine- bottle or a thermometer or a box of pills. The front of his
  desk was full of marks where he had been kicking it for thirty years.</p>

  <p>To-night, however, the object of his scrutiny, though a patient, was also
  rather more than a patient. Ringwood was not quite certain how much more, but
  he knew, as he would have said, that he &lsquo;kind of cottoned on&rsquo; to
  that chap Freemantle. He disliked parsons, as a rule (though no more than
  they disliked him); but Freemantle was an exception; you could talk to him;
  he wasn&rsquo;t stiff and starchy or shocked at a little strong language; and
  he had been particularly decent with young Trevis. Pity he had such a wife
  and that dreadful sister-in-law...</p>

  <p>But Ringwood was puzzled. It was a week now since Freemantle had returned
  from his three months&rsquo; rest-cure in Bournemouth, and every evening of
  that week he had called round at the surgery. Not that Ringwood minded, of
  course; he enjoyed a chat, especially if Freemantle wanted one; but the chats
  had not been the usual desultory discussions of politics and local affairs.
  On the contrary, Freemantle had seemed to have something on his mind all the
  time; he had kept harking back to matters which, Ringwood was sure, it was
  far better that he should try to forget altogether.</p>

  <p>Ringwood, indeed, was just a little contemptuous of the newspaper fuss
  that had been made over Freemantle. It was all over now, of course, but at
  the time it had slightly irritated him. He disliked mob-emotion, and it
  seemed to him rather silly that a man should work hard and meritoriously for
  twenty years without any recognition at all and then suddenly leap into fame
  because of something perfectly accidental and irrelevant. Of course
  he&rsquo;d behaved very pluckily; but wasn&rsquo;t there something rather
  fatuous in the way the Press and public had gone wild over him? It had been
  nothing less than disgusting, anyhow, to see those two women exploiting the
  poor devil as hard as they could go&mdash;that article, for instance, in one
  of the Sunday papers&mdash;&ldquo;My Husband, by the Wife of the
  Clergyman-Hero of Browdley&rdquo;&mdash;it was rumoured that she&rsquo;d been
  given a hundred guineas for it, and every word had been written by a Fleet
  Street journalist. Disgusting...And Ringwood had thought, after reading it:
  God, I wish they&rsquo;d give me a hundred and five quid to write &ldquo;My
  Patient, by the Doctor of the Clergyman-Hero of Browdley&rdquo;&mdash;I
  wouldn&rsquo;t need to have it done for me; I&rsquo;d just tell the stark
  truth; I&rsquo;d say: This chap&rsquo;s been slaving away at a damned hard
  job for donkey&rsquo;s years, and that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s a hero, if he
  is one, not because of a few hectic minutes after a railway smash...And
  I&rsquo;d also say: It&rsquo;s true he&rsquo;s had a bad breakdown, but
  that&rsquo;s not all through doing the heroic stuff, as the mob likes to
  think&mdash;he was heading for trouble long before that, and if anyone wants
  to know the reason, call at the Manse and take a look at those two damned
  women, or three, counting the scraggy daughter...&rsquo;</p>

  <p>He drank a little whisky, and then resumed his gaze at the man for whom,
  as much as for any person in the world, he felt a concern mounting to
  affection. Yes, he did look ill, there was no doubt of that; and his hand,
  his right hand, unfortunately, would never be much good to him again; he had
  gone greyer, too, much greyer, since the affair. The Bournemouth holiday had
  toned him up physically, but there was a good deal, obviously, that was still
  wrong. Yet if the whole experience had been so terrible, as could well be
  believed, why did he want to go on talking about it night after night, and to
  Ringwood only, it appeared, out of the entire population of Browdley?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; Ringwood said, with more seriousness than was
  usual with him, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you drop it all, Freemantle? I can see
  how it&rsquo;s still on your mind, and I can understand it&rsquo;s something
  you can&rsquo;t easily forget, but why don&rsquo;t you try to? After all, you
  did your best, and a damn good best it was&mdash;you&rsquo;ve nothing to
  reproach yourself with.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I know...&rdquo; Freemantle&rsquo;s quiet, troubled voice
  trailed off, but his eyes continued to speak; and they were queer eyes,
  Ringwood thought&mdash;indeed, he could almost agree with a sensational
  journalist&rsquo;s description of them as &lsquo;haunted&rsquo;. He thought
  to himself: We&rsquo;ll have him going off his rocker yet if we&rsquo;re not
  careful...</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You see, Ringwood,&rdquo; Freemantle continued, you haven&rsquo;t
  heard the true story. The newspapers got hold of everything but
  that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They seem to get hold of quite enough, if you ask me. Frankly, in
  your place, I&rsquo;d just drop the matter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t, Ringwood. I want to begin at the
  beginning&mdash;before the newspapers came into it at all. Last night and for
  several nights I&rsquo;ve been trying to tell you, but somehow I
  couldn&rsquo;t get started. But I&rsquo;ve made up my mind to-night.
  I&rsquo;ll be happier afterwards. Do you remember, before I went to London,
  you said when I came back I was to report to you what sort of a time
  I&rsquo;d had there?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I think I remember. I was only chaffing you, of
  course.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve come to make that report now. You don&rsquo;t mind
  listening, do you? Am I taking up too much of your time?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Lord, no, don&rsquo;t think that. It&rsquo;s only that I
  feel...still, if you say it&rsquo;s going to do you good, fire away, by all
  means.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And Freemantle began, with what Ringwood at first took to be a mere
  irrelevance that would further delay the matter: &ldquo;Do you remember that
  girl who ran away from home&mdash;Elizabeth Garland, her name was?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Some little time afterwards, Ringwood interrupted: &ldquo;Well,
  Freemantle, if that&rsquo;s your yarn, all I can say is, I don&rsquo;t quite
  know what you&rsquo;re being so dashed serious about. First you went to a
  specialist who diagnosed a sore throat&mdash;which I could have done for less
  than three guineas, by the way&mdash;then, feeling pretty bucked with life,
  you met this girl, and discovered that she wasn&rsquo;t, after all, eloping
  with a Jew old enough to be her father, but was off to Vienna on her own to
  study music. Personally I&rsquo;d have thought the former project rather less
  of a risk, but that&rsquo;s by the by. Anyhow, you took her to dinner in
  Soho, and then went on to a concert. Quite the thing to do&mdash;I&rsquo;d
  have done the same myself except that I&rsquo;d have chosen a music-hall.
  Really, Freemantle, you don&rsquo;t expect me to be very shocked by this
  revelation of a parson&rsquo;s night out in the metropolis, do
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>(Behind his banter, Ringwood was thinking: Wonder what they talked about,
  those two? Fearfully highbrow stuff, I suppose&mdash;can&rsquo;t imagine
  Freemantle being very gallant&mdash;she probably thought he was rather sweet,
  but a bit of a bore&mdash;unless, of course, she was a bit of the same sort
  of bore herself. Must say, I can&rsquo;t abide &lsquo;arty&rsquo; women at
  any price, but then, I&rsquo;m not artistic, and as for music, I hardly know
  &lsquo;God Save the King&rsquo; till I see people standing up...)</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve more to tell you yet,&rdquo; Freemantle went on,
  deliberately. &ldquo;After the concert we spent an hour or so at an hotel,
  and then, as it was getting late, I took her to the place where she was
  staying. It was a studio over a garage in Kensington&mdash;it belonged to
  some friends of hers. When we got there she asked me to come up and meet
  them, but we found the place empty. They&rsquo;d left a note to say
  they&rsquo;d been called away suddenly for the week-end.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see. So there you were, pleasantly parked with this girl in an
  untenanted studio?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Freemantle took no notice. &ldquo;She made some coffee and we sat and
  talked by the fire. I stayed on&mdash;talking&mdash;and&mdash;in the
  end&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t go back to my hotel at all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you, by Jove? Bit imprudent, eh? Supposing the studio
  people had come back unexpectedly?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we either of us thought about that. We were too
  absorbed thinking of other things. We&mdash;we discovered that&mdash;that we
  were both rather&mdash;rather desperately fond of each other.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ringwood flushed slightly, not exactly from embarrassment, but because he
  felt he was going to be made a reluctant confidant in a matter which, for
  some reason, he would not be able to treat in any of his usual ways. Scores
  of times in that surgery men had confessed, as a rule shamefacedly, to some
  kind of amorous adventure, and scores of times he had kicked his heels
  against the desk and shouted at them, blusteringly: &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t
  look so solemn about it&mdash;it&rsquo;s not the first time such a
  thing&rsquo;s been done in the history of the world, you know!&rdquo; But
  with Freemantle an instinct warned him that his customary banter would not be
  appropriate; in his case there might be, after all, a certain seriousness.
  Ringwood, in fact, was just a little astonished; he hadn&rsquo;t really
  suspected Freemantle of being that sort of chap. Not that he thought any less
  of him for it; as a man; heavens, no&mdash;but really, you did somehow expect
  parsons to behave themselves a bit more than other people. Rather like the
  Wakeford case, in a way...</p>

  <p>He said, after another gulp of whisky: &ldquo;Look here, old man, I really
  don&rsquo;t see the point in your telling me all this. I&rsquo;m not a
  father-confessor or a censor of morals or anything like that, but I do
  suggest, as a man of the world, that all that sort of thing is better not
  chattered about. Know what I mean, eh? Lots of things we all do that we
  shouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;naturally&mdash;but what I do feel is, Why tell
  people&mdash;why tell anybody?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But you don&rsquo;t understand what I am telling you, Ringwood! There
  wasn&rsquo;t anything anything like that! We just talked&mdash;and
  talked&mdash;there was nothing&mdash;of the kind of thing you&rsquo;re
  suggesting&mdash;nothing at all&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, old chap, all right. Sorry if I dropped a brick.&rdquo;
  (He thought: Poor devil, does he really think anyone would believe that? And
  Ringwood reflected curiously upon the morbid mentality that would embark upon
  a totally unnecessary confession and then furiously deny the only thing that
  gave the confession any point at all.) He went on, almost gently: &ldquo;My
  dear Freemantle, I still say&mdash;Why bother about it? Whether you did or
  didn&rsquo;t do this or that, what the hell&rsquo;s the use of arguing about
  it now? It&rsquo;s over and done with for better or worse&mdash;why
  can&rsquo;t you forget it with all the rest?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Freemantle still went on, and still with the same slow and inexorable
  emphasis: &ldquo;I was telling you, wasn&rsquo;t I, that she and I had
  discovered that&mdash;that we&mdash;meant everything to each other.
  So&mdash;so we talked things over&mdash;and decided&mdash;in the end&mdash;to
  go and live in Vienna together.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>What?</i> What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Just as I said. And the next morning we&mdash;she and I&mdash;were
  going to Kettering, because I knew somebody there who would sign my passport
  papers&mdash;that was necessary, you know, before I could get away. We were
  having breakfast together on the train, and she&rsquo;d just gone along to
  the compartment while I stayed behind a moment to settle the bill&mdash;I
  didn&rsquo;t even have time to do that&mdash;I never paid it, as a matter of
  fact&mdash;because the other thing happened so quickly...Now&mdash;<i>now</i>
  do you understand?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ringwood&rsquo;s heels banged against the desk. &ldquo;What? I don&rsquo;t
  quite follow&mdash;what&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re saying?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It happened&mdash;then&mdash;you see&mdash;while she was
  away&mdash;and I was staying behind...Don&rsquo;t you understand?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good God, man, I&rsquo;ve heard all you&rsquo;ve said,
  but&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t grasp it&mdash;surely you don&rsquo;t
  mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I do mean it. It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s a rather queer
  and awful thing to have happened, isn&rsquo;t it? But it&rsquo;s the
  truth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The truth!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. The truth that the newspapers never guessed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;that she&mdash;this girl you were travelling
  with&mdash;was <i>killed?</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Freemantle answered quietly, but with his voice deep with horror:
  &ldquo;She must have just reached the first coach when&mdash;it happened. I
  saw her there&mdash;amongst it all. I tried to get her out. I couldn&rsquo;t.
  She was burned to death. I <i>saw her</i>...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His eyes took on a vivid glare, and Ringwood, even in the midst of his
  amazement, sprang to instinctive professional awareness. &ldquo;Come,
  come,&rdquo; he said, putting down his glass and walking over to Freemantle.
  &ldquo;None of that, now. No good, you know.&rdquo; He put a hand on the
  parson&rsquo;s swaying shoulders, and Freemantle seemed to derive strength
  from the contact. After a while he looked up with more tranquil eyes and
  said, with a sharp sigh: &ldquo;Well, there it is. I&rsquo;ve told you now.
  I&rsquo;m glad somebody knows at last.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear chap, yes...&rdquo; Ringwood went to a cupboard and drew
  out his emergency bottle of brandy, but Freemantle waved it aside; he was all
  right, he said, now that he had told what he wanted to tell. He added,
  plaintively: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Ringwood, for wasting your time all the
  other evenings of this week.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must have been a terrible nuisance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, nonsense...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well...you can understand...now...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to, anyway. But&mdash;but
  it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s all so damned extraordinary I don&rsquo;t know
  what to think. It&rsquo;s just about taken the wind out of my sails.
  D&rsquo;you mean&mdash;I suppose you do&mdash;that nobody&rsquo;s got the
  slightest inkling of what&rsquo;s really happened?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not the slightest, Ringwood. All the passport things were left in
  the compartment and were burned. Nobody who knew either of us had seen us on
  the train, and it happened to be a Manchester train that I might very well
  have been travelling on in any case. I was even using up the return half of
  my Manchester ticket. And she&mdash;she was wearing no
  jewellery&mdash;nothing that gave any clue&mdash;afterwards. Even her parents
  aren&rsquo;t curious&mdash;they&rsquo;ve quite made up their minds that
  she&rsquo;s gone to the bad, and they neither expect nor wish to see her
  again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all most amazing. The most amazing thing I ever heard of
  in my life.&rdquo; A faint thought struck him and he added: &ldquo;I suppose
  you&rsquo;ve not been dreaming all this by any chance, have you,
  Freemantle?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hardly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ringwood flung himself down in his swivel-chair and for a few seconds
  scribbled idly on his blotting pad, trying to absorb the intricacies of a
  situation to which all his years of experience could provide nothing
  approaching a parallel. He was not a very imaginative person, and he found
  himself more and more befogged as he pondered over it all. The only theory
  which to him, as a medical man, seemed to fit the case was that Freemantle
  might be completely off his head, and have invented the whole story with the
  fervid ingenuity of the mentally deranged. At last, throwing down his pencil,
  he exclaimed: &ldquo;Well, if you say it all happened I&rsquo;ll have to
  believe it did, that&rsquo;s all. But what I chiefly can&rsquo;t fathom is
  this Vienna business. You say you had definitely made plans to go out there
  with this girl?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. If the passport could have been arranged quickly enough, we
  should have left London that same Saturday evening.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But what on earth would you have done when you got
  there?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She was going to study music. I was going to compose, if I
  could.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Compose?</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. Compose music.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Would it have brought in any money?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Probably not. I might have tried for some teaching job in a school.
  I could have taught English, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And what if you couldn&rsquo;t have found such a job?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t know how things would have turned
  out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Had you money?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She had nearly two hundred pounds, and there were a few shares and
  things I might have sold for a hundred or so. It would have been enough to
  begin on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To begin what on?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Our lives. To begin our lives on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He said that with such simplicity that Ringwood was swept into still
  further bewilderment. &ldquo;But good heavens, man, do you mean you were
  never going to come back at all?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, probably that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But what about your wife&mdash;your daughter&mdash;and, for that
  matter, your chapel?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I felt that all that didn&rsquo;t matter compared&mdash;compared
  with the other thing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What other thing?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Something I can&rsquo;t exactly describe&mdash;I never
  could&mdash;but I saw it then&mdash;while I was with her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ringwood shrugged his shoulders with a gesture of profound bafflement.
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have had to be less vague than that to your wife when you
  wrote explaining things.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have tried to explain. She wouldn&rsquo;t have
  starved&mdash;she has money of her own. And as for caring, do you think
  she&rsquo;d have cared a great deal, apart from the scandal?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But really, Freemantle, even if she wouldn&rsquo;t, you can&rsquo;t
  throw over your responsibilities in that casual fashion. It&rsquo;s
  preposterous!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I felt then that everything else was preposterous.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean that you&rsquo;d no doubts or misgivings of any
  sort?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t doubt anything that seemed so beautiful to me at
  the time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Seems to me, old chap, it isn&rsquo;t so much a question of
  what&rsquo;s beautiful or not beautiful as of what&rsquo;s right and
  what&rsquo;s wrong.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wonder if thinking that makes you really a more religious man
  than I am.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ringwood shrugged his shoulders again; he was no metaphysician; his code
  was rough but simple. Much as he disliked Freemantle&rsquo;s wife, he was,
  though he would not perhaps have used the word, a little shocked at the idea
  of any husband so calmly deserting his legal partner. Casual adultery he
  could comprehend and excuse, much as he might deplore the bad taste of
  subsequent confession; it was human, in his view, compared with the chilly
  ruthlessness of Freemantle&rsquo;s Vienna proposition. He gave his nose a
  vigorous blowing and went on, rather gruffly: &ldquo;Well, all I can say,
  Freemantle, is that to me the whole thing&rsquo;s still perfectly
  astonishing. Do you really believe you could have been happy for long in a
  foreign country with a mere girl you hardly knew?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. Absolutely happy. And always.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A quarter of an hour later Ringwood had recovered something of his normal
  equanimity of mind. It was characteristic of him that he never worried for
  long over a problem; if it proved too much of a twister he merely gave it up,
  and passed on to the next. Freemantle&rsquo;s emotional altitudes were beyond
  him, and he felt, moreover, a sort of reluctant crossness over them; he
  preferred a discussion in territory where he knew a few signposts. He
  didn&rsquo;t want to preach; but there was, after all, a certain
  rough-and-ready morality which, as a man of the world, he felt it his duty to
  impart on rare occasions; and the more he thought about it, the more
  convinced he was that Freemantle was desperately in need of someone to give
  him a dose of good &lsquo;horse sense&rsquo;. That was, of course, assuming
  that his amazing story were true; Ringwood could not yet make up his mind
  entirely about that. He noticed that Freemantle&rsquo;s face was very pale
  and that a rather unnatural and bloodshot brilliance was still in his eyes;
  he felt so confoundedly sorry for the chap, but what could one
  do&mdash;except give him sound advice? Completely mad, he must have been,
  Ringwood reflected, to be bowled over like that by a mere
  girl&mdash;attractive girl, though, with a deuced good figure, he
  remembered&mdash;and some excuse, perhaps, for any man with a wife like that
  and a sister-in-law bullying him all the time...But what was clearest of all
  to Ringwood was that it was the future that had to be faced, not a lot of
  had-beens and might-have-beens. Ringwood&rsquo;s natural outlook on life soon
  cut through the tangle of Freemantle&rsquo;s position; he did not solve the
  problem; he just thrust it to one side in a you-be-damned kind of way, and
  with growing confidence gave the man&rsquo;s shoulder a few encouraging
  shakes. &ldquo;Look here, old chap, you may think I&rsquo;ve not been
  particularly sympathetic over all this, but believe me, I&rsquo;m just about
  as sorry for you as anyone could be. I can quite understand how you feel
  about it all, but the fact is, you&rsquo;re rather bound not to see things as
  logically as a mere outsider can. That&rsquo;s natural, isn&rsquo;t it? Well,
  I&rsquo;m the outsider, and I look at it rather in this way, if you
  don&rsquo;t mind d a very candid opinion&mdash;You&rsquo;ve had a damned
  narrow escape!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>An escape?</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. Don&rsquo;t you see what I mean? Really, though I
  wouldn&rsquo;t call myself in any sense a religious chap, there does almost
  seem a sort Providence in it&mdash;don&rsquo;t you feel that? At any rate,
  what&rsquo;s the harm in thinking so? You go and get yourself into the deuce
  of a hole and then, just as you stand on the very brink of the precipice
  Providence steps in and cuts all the knots for you, so to speak. Those are
  mixed metaphors, but you can see what I&rsquo;m driving at. Don&rsquo;t you
  realise that you&rsquo;re being given a chance&mdash;a chance to put all that
  silly escapade on one side as if it had never happened? Why, man,
  you&rsquo;ve got half your life in front of you yet&mdash;think of
  it&mdash;think of the future&mdash;and if at odd times you do happen to
  recollect this queer business, call it just a mistake&mdash;a single solitary
  mistake that you couldn&rsquo;t help!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>A mistake?</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, we all make &rsquo;em don&rsquo;t we? And we&rsquo;re dashed
  lucky if we&rsquo;re given the chance of covering them up without a trace.
  Why, when you&rsquo;re as old as me, and you look back on a lifetime of
  decent honest straightforward doing-your-job, you won&rsquo;t bother much
  about a mad mood that happened in the midst of it all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Doing my job? What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, your ordinary everyday parson&rsquo;s job, of
  course.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here&mdash;in Browdley?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You think I can carry on here&mdash;as if&mdash;as if nothing had
  happened?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not? You told me yourself that nothing did happen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did I?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>(Ah, Ringwood thought, just as I suspected&mdash;anyhow, he&rsquo;s
  admitted it now&mdash;that&rsquo;s better than persisting in an absurd
  fairy-tale that nobody in his senses would believe&mdash;and, after all,
  there&rsquo;s nothing so very dreadful in it&mdash;she probably lured him on,
  anyway.) He replied, with growing cordiality: &ldquo;My dear Freemantle, I
  understand all that of course, of course. But the point is, as I&rsquo;ve
  been saying a good many times, it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to happen that
  matters, not what did happen. Here you are, with all your roots, as it were,
  in Browdley, working well and doing quite a deuce of a lot of
  good&mdash;perhaps in a smallish way, but then, when you come to think about
  it, aren&rsquo;t all our ways pretty small? It&rsquo;s the small ways,
  anyhow, that keep the world going&mdash;I&rsquo;m certain of that. Well, here
  you are, as I said, and whether you know it or not, you&rsquo;re liked in
  this town, you&rsquo;re respected, even admired, and folks would damn well
  miss you. That&rsquo;s as much as can truthfully be put on most tombstones.
  You&rsquo;ve had a dozen years of useful slogging away, and there ought to be
  at least twice as many ahead of you in the future&mdash;are you going to
  smash all that for the sake of a single incident that nobody knows or could
  ever know about unless you tell them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Some of the biggest things that have ever happened have been single
  incidents.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; replied Ringwood, stoutly, in haste to check any
  further plunge into abstract philosophy. &ldquo;Believe me, nothing&rsquo;s
  forgotten more quickly than a week-end flirtation, however much you think it
  means at the time...The point is, once again, that you&rsquo;ve been given
  this chance to carry on, and you&rsquo;ve jolly well got to take it.
  D&rsquo;you suppose other people haven&rsquo;t got Secrets in their pasts?
  See, here&rsquo;s a little yarn about myself&mdash;it&rsquo;s the sort of
  story most doctors could tell, no doubt, only they don&rsquo;t&mdash;no more
  would I, except to convince a chap like you. It happened about five years
  ago; I was called in to attend to two kids with the measles&mdash;ordinary
  working-class family, you know&mdash;no nurse or anybody like that to look
  after them. Well, they didn&rsquo;t have it very badly, and all seemed to be
  going along quite normally when one afternoon I was sent for in a mighty
  hurry&mdash;those two kids had suddenly got worse. I went along and
  found&mdash;to make the story short&mdash;that somehow or other in mixing up
  the medicine for them I&rsquo;d come an awful cropper&mdash;I&rsquo;d put
  loads of strychnine in by mistake&mdash;heaven knows how I&rsquo;d managed to
  do it, but there it was. My God, I worked pretty hard, that day&mdash;I was
  at the house till nearly midnight, trying to rinse out the stomachs of those
  kids. The boy kicked the bucket, but I managed with the girl. Well, what
  d&rsquo;you suppose I did then? Blabbed it all to the first person I met? Not
  a bit of it&mdash;I said to myself: Ringwood, this is a nasty business, but
  mistakes will happen&mdash;it&rsquo;s the first of this kind you&rsquo;ve
  ever made, and with luck it&rsquo;ll be the last. You do more good than harm
  on balance, and that&rsquo;s as much as can be said of most men. So I just
  signed &lsquo;measles&rsquo; as the cause of death on the certificate and
  that was that. The kids&rsquo; mother swears by me&mdash;she tells everyone
  how I slaved away for hours trying to save their lives&mdash;nobody could
  have done more, she says, which is true enough, by Jove. I&rsquo;m not
  Inventing that, Freemantle&mdash;I once actually overheard the woman praising
  me to the skies at a street-corner...I suppose it seems a terribly immoral
  story to you? Perhaps you think I ought to have phoned the coroner and
  confessed to manslaughter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, no&mdash;I don&rsquo;t blame you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, isn&rsquo;t it the same sort of thing in your
  case?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They talked for a little time longer, but Freemantle seemed exhausted, and
  Ringwood, too, felt that the argument might prove all the more effective if
  it were now curtailed. When Freemantle rose to go, Ringwood wanted to drive
  him home, or at least walk with him, but Freemantle said no; there was no
  need; it was bright moonlight; and Ringwood had an impression he rather
  wished to be alone to think things over. &ldquo;Just as you prefer
  then,&rdquo; he answered, jovially, and gave the parson a hearty handshake at
  the surgery-door. &ldquo;Good-bye, old chap, remember what I&rsquo;ve
  said.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat walked slowly along the High Street, trying to remember what had
  been said by both of them, but hardly a word or a sentence of the long
  discussion came to memory. All he could sec and think of was that silver
  slope of the roofs as the moonlight streamed upon them, and the pale glare
  that filled the middle of the roadway. He was more tranquil in mind than he
  had been for many days, but it was the moonlight making him so, he
  felt&mdash;not anything that had been said that night. And yet he was glad to
  have had that talk with Ringwood; he liked the doctor&mdash;a thorough good
  fellow.</p>

  <p>Just one small matter was still on his mind, even when all else had been
  pacified; he was aware, though dimly, of having forgotten
  something&mdash;some time ago&mdash;yet not so very long ago,
  really&mdash;what was it, he wondered? He had been wondering for many days
  and had often felt himself on the brink of recollection; and now, all at
  once, as he was turning the corner from the High Street into School Lane, he
  remembered; it was those evening papers he had promised to bring back for
  Trevis. Only a little thing, but he felt helplessly sorry about it; it was
  the one thing, of all things, that stirred him to real remorse. Perhaps he
  might visit Trevis in the morning.</p>

  <p>And suddenly then the whole familiar routine of life swung into focus and
  became once more possible. The meetings and services and committees and what
  not, the daily hours in the study and the visits to old ladies and the
  baptisms and weddings and funerals and all the rest of it&mdash;there it was,
  facing him inexorably, but somehow with the beauty of that night around it
  all, lending it a rich and fragrant hopefulness. That factory over there,
  black against the sky, but with all its windows gleaming, and that line of
  workmen&rsquo;s cottages pushing out into the sea of moonlight like a long
  black jetty, and the tramlines shimmering into the distance as he crossed the
  road&mdash;lovely, lovely, all that was. He hummed a tune that was in his
  head&mdash;ah, that thing of Brahms again&mdash;strange how it seemed to fit
  in with everything he felt. How short life was, and how brief the moments in
  it that really mattered! Nor could the framework of years enclose such divine
  fragments; they were timeless, notes in the never-finished symphony of the
  world. It was the quality of life that counted; forty years, a whole
  lifetime, could be as nothing weighed in the balance against a moment&rsquo;s
  lifting of the veil that hid beauty.</p>

  <p>As he came within sight of his house and chapel a small boy passed by with
  a timid smile. Howat stopped and spoke to him in the friendly way he always
  had with children, and after a few shy answers the boy asked: &ldquo;When are
  you going to tell us some more, sir, about the two little boys who sailed in
  a boat to an island?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Howat was puzzled at first; he could not think was being referred to; but
  at length he called to mind that foggy afternoon when he had given his
  daughter&rsquo;s class a so-called geography lesson. He said, happily:
  &ldquo;Very soon&mdash;perhaps this week,&rdquo; and gave the boy all the
  money he had in his pocket&mdash;four pennies and two half-pennies.</p>

  <p>When he reached the Manse he found his wife waiting up for him in one of
  her less amiable moods; but of course she was so highly-strung&mdash;he knew
  it was really not her fault. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re well enough to stay
  gossiping with that man Ringwood until this hour,&rdquo; she said, with some
  asperity, &ldquo;I should think you might begin on the pile of correspondence
  that&rsquo;s been waiting for you to answer for the last four
  months.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps so, perhaps so,&rdquo; he replied softly, blinking his eyes
  to the light. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time I was back again at work, isn&rsquo;t
  it?&rdquo; He gave her a very gentle smile and added: &ldquo;If you like, my
  dear, you can tell Ellen to put a fire in the study to-morrow...&rdquo;</p>
