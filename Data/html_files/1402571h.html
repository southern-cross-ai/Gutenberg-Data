  <h2><a name="ch1"
     id="ch1">CHAPTER I.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">TIME was when Castlerayne estates marched for miles along
  the Yorkshire coast. Not so long ago the Castleraynes were people of
  importance; indeed, the head of the House could claim that distinction now.
  On second thoughts, he did not so much make the claim as look upon it as a
  natural and indisputable right. As a matter of fact, the vast estates had
  been thrown into the crucible of change; they had gone as lands and fields
  will do under the sway of three generations of spendthrifts. The 'First
  Gentleman in Europe' had been a friend of the present owner's grandfather,
  and, after that, little explanation of the family fallen fortunes is
  needed.</p>

  <p>The old castle to-day is a mass of ivy-clad, picturesque ruins, standing
  high on the seaboard and commanding inland one of the most exquisite
  prospects in the North. So far as the passer-by can judge, the grounds about
  the ruins are beautifully kept, whereat the would-be picnicker wonders and
  envies, for none of his class are ever admitted within the sacred precincts
  of what had once been a great feudal castle.</p>

  <p>If you are bold enough to explore the rugged walls, or fortunate enough to
  get beyond the sunken dike where the moat used to run, you will be equally
  surprised. You will cross a brown trout-stream filled with great
  gold-and-white lily pads; you will see a quiet stretch of velvet lawn, with
  the grim ivy-clad walls of the fortress for a background. Behind the ruins is
  a sloping hill covered to the summit with larches and birches and
  rowans&mdash;a marvellous setting to the picture. And then you will note why
  the ruins are so carefully guarded; for, nestling amongst them, built from
  their very stones, and knit into their very frame, is a marvellously
  beautiful and picturesque house covered with creepers to the roof-ties. The
  house has every appearance of great antiquity; it has latticed panes in the
  mullioned windows, the upper halves of which are stained glass. There is
  something very romantic and charming in this refined house, protected by the
  frowning fortress beyond; something very cooling in the brown stream where
  the lily pads flourish. Then, if you are discreet, you will make a bolt of
  it, being perfectly satisfied why the general public are excluded so rigidly
  from Castlerayne Towers.</p>

  <p>As to the house itself, it is pure Elizabethan, though as a matter of fact
  it is not more than a century old. All the same, it was built&mdash;stone and
  timber&mdash;from the remains of the older keep; every bit of panelling,
  every carved ceiling and cornice, had come from the parent place. The house,
  together with some four thousand acres of sour, poor land, is all that
  remains of the Castlerayne property.</p>

  <p>But, poor as the land is, it is wonderfully beautiful and picturesque. It
  lies for the most part fringing the North Sea, a rolling prairie of short
  thymy grass and heather, with here and there deep dells filled with bracken
  and blackberry, sand-dunes, and green lawns the turf of which has not been
  disturbed for centuries. Here and there are deep pits, with banks of refuse
  at the sides&mdash;refuse now covered with heather&mdash;where once the
  tenants of the estate extracted small doles of plumbago. But the plumbago
  vanished with the rest of the family prosperity, so that to-day there is no
  sign of commerce there. As for the rest, the greater part of the estates was
  useless save as a living for a few hundred hardy sheep. Still, the prospect
  was wonderful, the air brisk and bracing, so that folks came from Hardborough
  in the summer-time and picnicked there. The bathing was splendid&mdash;far
  more alluring than at Hardborough, the great fashionable and residential
  watering-place some few miles down the coast. There were still greater and
  more prosperous towns within twenty miles, and there were people who avowed
  that Mr. Rayne Castlerayne had the making of a fortune if he would but
  transform the Towers estate into a watering-place. But nobody ever ventured
  to make that suggestion to Mr Castlerayne, for nobody had the necessary
  courage.</p>

  <p>For the man's poverty was only exceeded by his pride. For eight hundred
  years there had been a Castlerayne more or less ruling over these parts. They
  had been warriors, divines, statesmen, robbers, in turn. Rayne Castlerayne
  never forgot that; the reflection warmed him on cold days, and kept him from
  worrying about his creditors. The slight little man with the clean-shaven
  face and hooked nose was not in the least like the head of an ancient race;
  he was shy and diffident so long as you took no liberties and remembered what
  he was. His eldest daughter, Angela, on the other hand, was all that one
  might expect from the class of Vere de Vere&mdash;tall, dark, exceedingly
  handsome, the beauties of her face softened by a pleasing smile and a little
  mouth that sometimes had a pathetic droop in it. There was another daughter,
  May, who quite incontinently was a Radical. Nobody quite knew where her
  sentiments came from, whence sprang the spirit of modern
  commercialism&mdash;those terrible ideas. For the rest, she was a pretty
  blonde, with charming easy manners, and no idea of the family dignity.</p>

  <p>As to the household itself, it was greatly swayed&mdash;one could not call
  it ruled&mdash;by Miss Gertrude Castlerayne, sister of the head of the
  family. Miss Gertrude was small, a little faded and nervous; the face was
  relieved by a pair of dark eyes and abundance of silver hair, the rich silver
  that has gold flecks in the sunshine. There are certain old maids who are as
  beautiful and charming as their younger sisters, and Miss Gertrude was one of
  them. Nobody called her aught but Miss Gertrude, and all loved her, as was
  fitting they should.</p>

  <p>There was a canker in the rose, of course&mdash;there always is; and the
  canker in this rose was a prosaic inability to make both ends meet. The
  metaphor sounds trite and vulgar in the case of such exalted personages, but
  that is what it came to. The poor land and the equally poor sheep made but
  scanty provision for the Castleraynes; the scattered tenants on the estate
  with difficulty paid their rent, though the spirit was willing enough. As May
  frequently said, things could not go on like this much longer.</p>

  <p>'What is the use of our fine old name?' she demanded. 'It does not pay old
  Morris for his milk and butter; it does not prevent us from owing Mrs. Lacey
  more than we can ever pay for meat. Dad is fond of saying that honour and
  integrity no longer form part of the character of the English people. And
  then he goes on to tell Sutton that he will send him a cheque next week for
  those seed-potatoes. Now, he knows perfectly well that there is not the
  slightest chance of paying Sutton next week or next year. And perhaps Sutton
  will make his arrangements on the strength of that promise. Angela, I ask
  you, is it honest?'</p>

  <p>Angela sighed gently as she proceeded to tie back a refractory verbena.
  The garden was a blaze of sunshine; the wide stretch of dune and heather and
  bank was flooded with it. The whole place might have been Tennyson's 'haunt
  of ancient peace.' If the canker was here, it was certainly not in the hearts
  of the crimson roses.</p>

  <p>'I calculate that we are six hundred pounds in debt,' the remorseless May
  went on. 'We are living at present on the charity of Aunt Gertrude. And I
  know for a fact that she has spent all her money but a thousand pounds. And
  here is a chance of making a steady five hundred a year for the rest of our
  lives. It drops into our laps like a godsend, and dad puts it aside as if
  some horrid brewer had offered to turn the old house into a tavern. We can't
  afford to be independent.'</p>

  <p>'I call it gross presumption,' Angela said with dignity. 'Surely you have
  not given the proposal proper consideration, dear. For some time past we have
  tolerated the visits of trippers and the like from Hardborough, who make use
  of the common. They come here with their baskets; they leave a horrid litter
  in the heather&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'There are a great many rich people in Hardborough,' May interrupted; 'and
  a good many nice people too. They are not all trippers. Hardborough is the
  queen of watering-places. I should very much like to live there myself.'</p>

  <p>Angela very properly ignored the atrocious sentiment.</p>

  <p>'Our father put an end to that kind of thing. He has been too lenient.
  Then he gets the offer you speak of from the Imperial Hotel Company. They are
  desirous of taking the old Dower-House on a repairing lease, and opening it
  as a high-class hotel.'</p>

  <p>'Well, why not? The Dower-House is at present in ruins. Put it in order
  and reduce the grounds to something like form, and there need be no more
  charming spot in England. It would not interfere with us in the least; it
  would only mean that the visitors had the right to reconnoitre on the sacred
  common, and we should be five hundred pounds a year better off. We should be
  able to pay our creditors then, and look the world in the face. And the
  pensioners would not have to go to the workhouse.'</p>

  <p>Angela blushed slightly, for May had touched her on a tender spot. For the
  pensioners in question were dependent on the family bounty&mdash;a sacred
  thing, a tradition that had come down the grooves of the centuries. High up
  on the common stood ten small houses in which were ten old men and women who
  had served out the measure of their strong years on the estate; and those
  almshouses went back to the seventeenth century. To a certain extent, the
  common was theirs; it had been given them by the founder of the hospital as a
  means of revenue for keeping up the hospice, subject always to the rights of
  the Lord of the Manor. In those days plumbago had been found on the common,
  and the proceeds from the sale thereof had endowed the cottages. But the
  plumbago had failed, and the pensioners had fallen back on the hospitality of
  the family.</p>

  <p>Sooth to say, the pensioners were having an exceedingly hard time of it at
  present. Besides the plumbago, there had been a certain well or spring of
  water containing mineral qualities, a well which had a place in history, a
  stream with a romance of its own, and the better class of visitors from
  Hardborough and the like had come there and drunk the water and left largesse
  behind, so that week in and week out there was as much as keep body and soul
  together in the hospice. And now the well had suddenly fallen away because,
  so May said, of the prosaic fact that the new owner of the estate adjoining
  Castlerayne to the north had been draining his property along the fringe of
  the sea. May brought up the fact now. She was terribly practical in her
  arguments.</p>

  <p>'The offer ought to be accepted,' she said, 'if only for the sake of the
  hospitallers. For all practical purposes, the common belongs to them&mdash;I
  mean those few hundred acres of it&mdash;and they can do what they like with
  it. My dear Angela, I could not possibly sit down and see a chance like this
  thrown away. It will be no fault of mine if the chance is lost. I have taken
  the bull by the horns and written to Mr Clifford Warrener.'</p>

  <p>Angela blushed pink as the verbena she was still training in the way it
  should go.</p>

  <p>'Mr Warrener is almost a stranger,' she protested. 'We only met him a few
  times during our visit to London in the spring. And he is actually engaged in
  trade, May.'</p>

  <p>'Soap,' May said cheerfully&mdash;'household soap. After all, that is an
  honest occupation. Soap is a valuable asset in the nation's balance-sheet.
  Anyway, I've written to Mr. Warrener, and he has telegraphed saying that he
  will be here to-morrow afternoon.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2"
     id="ch2">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">'I HOLD in my hand,' Mr. Castlerayne said oracularly, 'a
  most extraordinary letter. It is from a firm of solicitors in Hardborough,
  and refers to the offer of the hotel company as to that preposterous
  suggestion relating to the opening of a licensed house here. These solicitors
  are instructed by their client, Mr. Samuel Craggs, to oppose any such action,
  and state that the rights of the common are vested in the hospitallers under
  the deed of 17th December 1699. This deed I am prepared to admit; and here
  comes the strange part of the letter. The hospitallers will resist any
  attempt to infringe their rights, and they claim the free lease of the common
  under the said deed; and, further, they claim that in them is vested the sole
  authority to admit or prevent any building on the common or the use of the
  said common for any other purpose save the right of sheep-grazing. In other
  words, they claim that the common belongs to them. Really, my dear Gertrude,
  your protégé Sam Craggs is going too far. For a Radical cobbler to oppose me
  like this!'</p>

  <p>Miss Gertrude flushed faintly. If the expression might be permitted about
  so impeccable a lady, there was the suggestion of guilt about her.</p>

  <p>'Samuel is eccentric,' she admitted; 'and he has dreadful revolutionary
  ideas. He is fond of reading Carlyle and Adam Smith, and all kinds of
  formidable books. Still, he would never have gone into the hospital had it
  not been for the rheumatism that crippled his hands. And, like most people,
  he had no desire to starve. I don't know who told him about the proposal from
  Hardborough, but he had heard of it some time ago. It was he who gave me the
  first intimation of it.'</p>

  <p>'And, of course, he was heartily in favour of it,' Mr Castlerayne said
  bitterly. 'It is just the kind of Radical progress idea to please
  Samuel.'</p>

  <p>'Those people are living on my bounty, and they know it,' Miss Gertrude
  reiterated. A retort with her was so rare that she blushed at her own
  temerity. 'Fifteen years ago I wanted to close the hospital and send the poor
  creatures to the workhouse. But you would not hear of it, Rayne; the family
  dignity prevented you. Craggs may be all that you say; but the bread of
  charity is bitter to him; he does not like the flavour of it. He would like
  to see the offer accepted; he would like to feel that his weekly dole comes
  from people who paid honestly for a remunerative privilege. And he was
  equally certain that you would refuse to entertain the offer. He had a rod in
  pickle for you, he said.'</p>

  <p>'A rod in pickle!' Mr Castlerayne groaned. 'For <i>me?</i> He actually
  said that?'</p>

  <p>'He did. I am afraid that Samuel is no respecter of persons. This he told
  me. He has been looking up the family archives; he has been to Lancaster, and
  examined the deeds relating to the Crown lands and the manors of East
  Yorkshire. He says he is quite sure of his ground, and that the commoners
  here have a vested right in the income to arrive from that part of the common
  whence the plumbago originally came. On his own initiative he has placed the
  matter in the hands of those lawyers in Hardborough, and they advise him that
  he has a good case.'</p>

  <p>'Ah!' Mr Castlerayne went on, with one of his rare flashes of illumination
  upon him. 'As I know to my cost, the lawyers are expensive friends. And
  Craggs has no money. Who has been providing him with funds for this
  disgraceful litigation, I should like to know?'</p>

  <p>No reply came to the question. Miss Gertrude's head was bent, a little red
  spot on either of her pallid cheeks. It was perhaps fortunate that the head
  of the House did not repeat his question. He muttered something to the effect
  that he would have to consult his own lawyers. He had not the slightest
  intention of accepting that hotel company's offer, nor was he disposed for a
  moment to admit the claim of the preposterous and revolutionary Craggs. The
  bare idea that an old tenant on his own estate should take this step filled
  him with pain.</p>

  <p>Angela had listened languidly to the discussion. On the contrary, May was
  deeply interested. Her blue eyes sparkled with amusement. It was evident that
  her dignity was not touched. Sooth to say, the Radical cobbler was by way of
  being a favourite of hers. Dreadful as it sounds, those two had much in
  common. May placed her arm affectionately through that of her aunt and drew
  her out into the sunshine.</p>

  <p>'Come as far as the trout-pool,' she said. 'I have something serious to
  say to you. Aunt Gertrude, you are a wicked old woman who is deliberately
  conspiring to upset the peace and dignity of a once happy family. It is a
  good thing that dad is so dazzled with his dignity that he can't see as far
  as I can. To save you from prosecution, I am going to make a double charge
  against you. It was you who found the money for Craggs's action!'</p>

  <p>'He didn't tell you?' Aunt Gertrude exclaimed. 'He never so far forgot his
  promise&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Not a single word did he tell me. But you are such a transparent old
  darling! When you blushed just now I guessed it like a flash. Not that I
  blame you, dear. Ah no! It would be nothing less than downright dishonesty
  for my father to refuse this offer. And yet he is so blind, so eaten up with
  his family pride, that he would not hesitate. I only hope that Craggs is
  right. He is an obstinate old thing, but he is as honest as the day. The idea
  is to force dad into some compromise. And if he fails&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'He will not fail,' Aunt Gertrude whispered. 'Everything is absolutely
  correct. And I found him the money. I have promised to let him have five
  hundred pounds. Only, you must not tell this to anybody. I dare say you will
  think that I am a poor, timid creature, and that I should have told your
  father everything. But he can be very hard when he is roused, and&mdash;and I
  am very fond of Angela and yourself, dear. I hate the idea of having
  strangers here as much as anybody; but, as you say, it would be criminal to
  refuse this offer. I have urged your father to sell the place; but nobody
  would buy it at anything beyond the land-value of the house, for the land
  around is so poor. I had thought it over day and night, and I have prayed to
  do right. I <i>think</i> I have done what is right. At any rate, I
  <i>have</i> done what is best for the happiness of the people here. And not
  one word&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Not one,' May said solemnly. 'And now, go back to your jams and
  preserves, and let me take a hand in the business. I hope you won't be
  shocked, Aunt Gertrude; but I am going up to the common to meet a young man.
  You have heard me speak of Clifford Warrener?'</p>

  <p>'The gentleman you met in London?' Aunt Gertrude asked. She spoke in a
  studied prim and cold voice. 'I should say that it is hardly the
  proper&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Oh yes, it is. Mr. Warrener is a business man. We were great friends in
  London in the spring. We are all the greater friends because he does not
  admire me a bit, and because he is very much in love with Angela. She refuses
  to look at him because he is in trade. Just as if that makes any difference
  so long as the man is a gentleman! Well, I gave Mr. Warrener a good deal of
  our family history. You see, he told me all about Angela, and that
  established a bond of sympathy between us. And he said that some day he would
  like to come down and discuss a proposal with dad when he had time. He seems
  to know all this part of the country very well. And he seemed quite familiar
  with the name.'</p>

  <p>'That is quite possible,' Aunt Gertrude said quietly. 'You see, I was
  engaged to his father at one time. They were dreadfully poor at that period,
  and Mr. Warrener incurred great odium by going into trade. I believe he made
  a mess of it, poor fellow! but I never saw him again. Still, as a girl I was
  very fond of him. How foolish I am!'</p>

  <p>May bent and kissed the cheek of the faded little figure by her side. She
  knew the sweet nature of Aunt Gertrude. She knew the life of noble
  self-sacrifice her aunt had always led. And here in these few simple words
  was her life's romance, the turned-down page she had hidden from everybody.
  And May knew at last why Aunt Gertrude had never married.</p>

  <p>'You are a darling!' she said; 'and I love you better than ever. Good-bye,
  dear.'</p>

  <p>May went up the slope past the hollow where the ruins of the Dower-House
  lay, with its magnificent range of scenery inland and to the sea; past the
  trout-stream and on to the common, where the wind was blowing fresh and
  sweet, and her feet were deep in the purple heather. Away at the back, behind
  a stretch of great pines, lay the hospital.</p>

  <p>It was not all gorse and bracken and heather here; there were wide gaps
  and tracks made ages ago by the workers in plumbago, and turf eaten short and
  thick by generations of sheep. The grass was wonderfully thick and level,
  broken here and there by banks of undergrowth, little ravines full of sand,
  and heathy rainpits where the plumbago had been mined. To the left was the
  glorious sea, to the right a panorama of the kind that only the British Isles
  can afford. It was an ideal spot, and May sighed as she looked at it. On the
  whole, despite the mutual advantages, the hotel idea was not pleasing.</p>

  <p>A tall figure in Harris tweed came towards May and raised his cap. The
  sinister hand of trade had left no stain on Clifford Warrener. It occurred to
  May that her sister was an exceedingly fortunate young woman, if she had only
  the sense to see it. Then, without further preamble, May plunged into the
  subject that was nearest her heart.</p>

  <p>'I am deeply interested,' Warrener said&mdash;'far more interested than
  you are even aware of. Let us walk as far as the Dower-House and back to that
  turf yonder. And you can tell me everything. After that I may have a proposal
  to make.'</p>

  <p>May talked vivaciously and well. The dark eyes of her companion watched
  her with admiration. He smiled from time to time. Before the recital was
  finished the empty shell of what had been the Dower-House was reached. Below
  it was a level plain like a platform formed of heather and gorse, and there
  lay an even patch of grass, the bents growing compact and thick like the
  foliage of the carnation. There were acres of it there.</p>

  <p>'So the Radical is abroad.' Warrener smiled. 'I fancy I shall be able to
  find the way to bring Craggs to reason. When I was quite a boy he instructed
  me in the art of poaching&mdash;fish-poaching, for he was too honest to touch
  game. If I were to make Craggs listen to me, I could make the fortune of your
  family at the same time. All this poor land&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'That is the trouble,' May said dryly. 'If it were rich land we could let
  it. As it is, the whole four thousand acres is worth nothing. In my
  imagination I try to think what would happen if we were to find gold
  here.'</p>

  <p>'I also have an imagination.' Warrener smiled. 'It is a mistake to think
  that the business man is devoid of imagination. On the contrary, some of the
  richest men I know have made their money by the exercise of imagination. Some
  people call it foresight Well, I have had a fine flash of foresight so far as
  this place is concerned. Look at that lovely turf, those rolling hills, the
  little brook with its feathery ferns; look at those sand-dunes over there.
  Take in the lovely prospect from the Dower-House. My dear Miss May, I can see
  the gold fairly bubbling out of the ground. I can see all that fine fringe of
  gorse and heath and heather over there by the sea selling for its weight in
  silver. The whole thing came to me when I was waiting for you. There is the
  fortune crying aloud to be picked up and dropped in your pockets.'</p>

  <p>'Coal!' May cried. 'Dirty gray coal! The hideous blotting of the
  landscape&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Nothing of the kind.' Warrener laughed. 'Nothing shall disturb the
  peaceful serenity of the scene; nothing shall move the firmness of the
  prospect. Let us go to the top of the common, and there, under the seal of
  secrecy, I will tell you of my discovery.'</p>

  <h2><a name="ch3"
     id="ch3">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">'PERHAPS you will wonder why I tell you this,' Warrener said
  finally. He had been speaking for a long time; there was a fine glow of
  enthusiasm on his brown face. 'In the first place, I was pretty sure that you
  would be in sympathy with my idea. You did not expect anything so poetic from
  a business man?'</p>

  <p>'Why not?' May asked. The glow on Warrener's face was reflected on her
  own. 'Two of the most delightful and fanciful books I know are written by
  business men. Take <i>The Golden Age,</i> for instance. And I suppose there
  is romance in business?'</p>

  <p>Warrener laughed. He seemed to be very pleased with himself.</p>

  <p>'Of course,' he said. 'Take my own career, for instance. We manufacture
  our commercial necessity in a village. That was my idea&mdash;the ideal
  working man in the ideal village! That was laughed at as a dream. But there
  it is&mdash;over two thousand workmen housed in model cottages covered with
  creepers&mdash;roomy, airy, efficient! We even have a theatre. We give
  pastoral plays in the park. And my people are getting enthusiastic as to
  Shakespeare! All that from prosaic soap! Oh, I can assure you there is much
  latent poetry in commerce. It was my education in this direction that first
  gave me my inspiration as to the common. But it is to remain a secret for the
  present. It is very fortunate for everybody that I am in time to avert the
  plans of those hotel people.'</p>

  <p>'My father would never have consented,' May said.</p>

  <p>'Probably not. But, you see, the matter is out of his hands. I am afraid
  that I am mainly responsible for this Hampden-like attitude of Samuel Craggs.
  I had quite forgotten the place of my birth. I had hardly visited it since I
  was a boy. Pardon my egotism; but it is necessary to tell you these things.
  My early memories are not pleasant; there is too much sordid poverty in them.
  Do you know that at one time my father wanted to marry your Aunt
  Gertrude?'</p>

  <p>'I only learnt the fact to-day,' May explained.</p>

  <p>'That was a real romance for you! My people were as poor&mdash;well, as
  you are. It was the most dreadful kind of poverty. My father had the
  opportunity of going into business, and he took it. It was a shocking thing,
  of course, degrading and all that. And your father had no alternative. He was
  conscientious according to his lights. But he ruined a very pretty and tender
  love-story. The tragic side of the medal lay in the fact that my father was
  not in the least fitted for business. It was only a long struggle against the
  black wolf of bankruptcy. I learnt the lesson that my father failed to grasp.
  I threw myself heart and soul into the concern; I became a master of detail.
  And to-day I have two thousand of the happiest employés in England and a
  fortune that is sweet and honest. Then I met you and your sister in London,
  and I fell in love with the daughter of my father's old friend. And when the
  time comes I am going to make Angela my wife.'</p>

  <p>There was a clear ring in the last part of the speech, a challenge in the
  flung-back head that May did not fail to notice. Really, Angela was a very
  fortunate girl if she had only sense to see it. Yet Angela had been coldly
  polite to this highly successful trader; she had tolerated the emollient for
  the sake of the old family friendship. Angela was quite as proud and foolish
  as her father. Warrener flung back his head and laughed at his own sheer
  conceit.</p>

  <p>'There,' he said, 'I have made my confession; and I am not in the least
  ashamed, knowing what the soap has done. It has given my mother her villa in
  the south of France, the only air that she can breathe; it has given my
  erstwhile little brother all that Harrow and Cambridge can afford; and there
  are other things. Is that not better than the smug contemplation of the
  family dignity and a set of unpaid tradesmen's books? There is a purse-proud
  person for you!'</p>

  <p>'Nothing of the kind, sir.' May laughed. 'I like you all the better for
  it. But you have not told me why you are so interested in us.'</p>

  <p>'Indeed I have. I have told you that I am going to marry your sister. And
  I told you something of the romance of Aunt Gertrude. And when I discovered
  that Angela was the one girl for me, I began to ask questions. Oh, I know all
  about it&mdash;all about the struggle to lay the ghost of the family pride,
  about the poor people at the hospital. I came down here and made friends with
  Sam Craggs. I found the emollient of the greatest possible assistance then.
  The hotel prospect I heard of in London. Then the Great Inspiration came on
  me like a flash. We could dispense with the hotel programme, which is by no
  means a pretty one. I bring back prosperity to the family at the same time,
  and that without spoiling the lovely spot or interfering with the seclusion
  of anybody. I may admit that Craggs gave me the first germ idea. For a long
  time past he has been pretty sure that your father would not listen to my
  suggestion. And yet I think that I have convinced you that here is a
  veritable goldmine.'</p>

  <p>May nodded thoughtfully. She had been absolutely convinced. She was also
  absolutely convinced that her father would have nothing whatever to do with
  it. Still, if Craggs was right, happily Mr. Castlerayne would not be in a
  position to interfere.</p>

  <p>'Let us go and discuss it with Craggs,' Warrener suggested. 'I will tell
  him that you have come over to the side of the angels. He is very fond of
  you.'</p>

  <p>On the crest of the hill, beyond the belt of pines, the hospital lay, a
  series of stone buildings with a chapel in the centre. The place was quite
  two centuries old; the stone part was ruddy and violet and saffron with the
  beating of bygone storms; on the green in front two good old cedars slanted
  in from the direction of the sea. There were hammered-iron railings in front,
  with the device of the Castleraynes worked into them. There was something
  purely feudal about the idea of these pensioners on the bounty of the head of
  the clan. It would have been much purer still had the income been a regular
  one and not a precarious dripping of doles from the overlord, who was little
  better than a pauper himself.</p>

  <p>Under one of the slanting cedars, guarded from the sunshine, sat an old
  man reading a big volume by the aid of a pair of round iron-rimmed
  spectacles. His face was grooved and knotted, filled with crossed lines like
  the rind of a melon. He had bushy eyebrows and a chin of aggressive
  obstinacy. His hands were drawn and knotted by chronic rheumatism. He put
  aside his book with a palpable sigh as he saw his visitors.</p>

  <p>'Well, Craggs,' Warrener said cheerfully, 'I have brought Miss May to see
  you&mdash;brought another convert to the Great Conspiracy!'</p>

  <p>'She always had the brains of the family, did Miss May,' Craggs said
  bluntly. 'Not that I'm going to say a word against Miss Gertrude. Spending
  her little fortune, she is, on we folks here, and makes me downright mad to
  think on. But these poor creatures here as would never go to the House, nor
  should they be asked to, seeing as the place rightly belongs to we. It was
  all right so long as the plumbago lasted; it was not so bad till our mineral
  spring gave out; but latterly it's the bread of charity, and right nasty
  stuff it is. But I'm going to stop all that.'</p>

  <p>The speaker brought his knotted hands together with a snap. The village
  cobbler seemed to be terribly in earnest. The others let him run on for the
  time.</p>

  <p>'I found things out,' he said. 'This common belongs to us; and it comes
  hard if we can't get a living out of it and be independent of everybody. Time
  was when every rood of ground maintained its man. That's Goldsmith, as wrote
  the <i>Deserted Village</i>&mdash;a proper Radical he were, surely. And when
  I found out as every rood here belonged to us, I began to rack my brains for
  a way to turn it to account. Not as I liked the hotel idea; I liked it so
  little that I said nothing further, as the squire would have to put a stop to
  that. And then Mr. Warrener here comes along with a good notion as tickles me
  dreadfully. I don't know whether he said anything to you about it, miss.'</p>

  <p>'Mr Warrener has been so good as to take me into his confidence.' May
  smiled. 'I regard the scheme as a distinct inspiration. I wonder it has not
  been thought of before. But you are going to be the man to bring it all
  about, Craggs.'</p>

  <p>The old cobbler flushed with pride. The gray eyes twinkled under the bushy
  brows. Given scope and opportunity, Craggs would have been a great reformer,
  he would have been a good parliamentary debater; he had a rugged eloquence of
  his own. Strange that so great a Radical should have been in so uncongenial a
  soil. Yet he was conservative enough to dislike the idea of anything like
  constitutional change in the environment of his birth.</p>

  <p>'I love the old place,' he said. 'For seventy years I've lived here. I
  buried my wife and my two children back yonder; and I came to the hospital
  feeling as I had earned my rest, not to eat the bread of charity. It lies too
  cold and sour in the stomach for me. What I want to see arising from the
  place is income; the unearned increment does not appeal to me. And yet I
  don't want to see the place cut up and spoilt. This is a place made by God
  Almighty for people to breathe the fresh air and be grateful for the gift of
  life&mdash;a kind of sanatorium made natural. And Mr. Warrener has found the
  way to do it, which comes of education and a proper use of the brain as
  Providence has given him.'</p>

  <p>'That is very nice of you,' Warrener said gently. 'Your dream is pretty
  certain to come true, Craggs, provided that you are right as to your reading
  of the charter. According to your argument, the common belongs to the
  hospitallers to do as they please with.'</p>

  <p>'Not to sell it,' Craggs remarked. 'Let's be fair. The chief rights belong
  to the Lord of the Manor, which is Mr. Castlerayne and his heirs for ever;
  but to work the place to the best advantage and to apply it to any legitimate
  purpose by means of which we can derive benefits by way of income. That's
  what my lawyers in Hardborough say, and they are prepared to fight the matter
  out for me. And the squire will fight us for certain. I've got five hundred
  pounds to go on with.'</p>

  <p>Craggs paused and looked uncomfortable under the close gaze of May
  Castlerayne. He had a shrewd idea that she knew where the five hundred pounds
  had come from.</p>

  <p>'It won't be wasted, miss,' he said almost penitently. 'Like bread cast
  upon the waters, it will come back after many days&mdash;ay, and not so many
  days either. That money came from an angel, if ever there was one, and every
  coin of it is blessed. And who's the squire that he should stand like a stone
  in the path of progress?'</p>

  <p>The latter question was flung like a missile at the head of May. She had
  no answer to the challenge. She smiled in a pleased kind of way.</p>

  <p>'When Craggs falls back on that frame of mind I always fear him,' she
  said. 'Let us go back to the house, Mr. Warrener; you will come and have a
  cup of tea. My father would never forgive me if I allowed you to go without
  something, even if it is only a cup of tea.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch4"
     id="ch4">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">As matters turned out, Clifford Warrener was destined to
  something besides the conventional meal temptingly offered by May
  Castlerayne. He had come down to stay for a day or two with some friends in
  the neighbourhood; he had telegraphed to say that they might expect him about
  dinner-time; his kit-bag had gone on in advance. Outside the gate of the
  Towers a messenger awaited him with a note. It appeared that the telegram had
  been delayed, the which is a pleasing malady with the average railway station
  telegraph-office, where labour is scanty and electric message importunity of
  little favour. There was nobody at home at The Haven, and the butler, who had
  been away all day, had taken the liberty of opening the telegram. A wandering
  gamekeeper had chanced to see Mr. Warrener, and thus his movements had been
  recorded. Meanwhile, the kit-bag and its contents awaited the good pleasure
  of the owner thereof.</p>

  <p>'Very awkward,' Clifford muttered. 'The Marchmonts are all away. I did not
  know that when I telegraphed last night. Perhaps I had better have my bag
  sent over to the Royal Hotel at Hardborough. There is a train about six,
  and&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Indeed, you will do nothing of the kind,' May said with decision. 'We
  will send the donkey-cart to fetch your bag, and you will stay here
  to-night.&mdash;&mdash;Aunt Gertrude, will you be so good as to neglect your
  precious flowers for a moment? This is Mr. Warrener, who is belated and
  stranded by the way, with no rest for the sole of his dress-slippers, so to
  speak. Come and persuade him to dine and spend the night here.'</p>

  <p>Aunt Gertrude came slowly down the grass path below the rose-bushes. There
  was a flush on her pale face, a questioning in her eyes as they fell upon
  Warrener's tall figure. She seemed to be looking into the past, beyond the
  events of the cold, dead years. She breathed just a little faster; her lips
  were parted.</p>

  <p>'I am glad to see you,' she said. 'My dear boy, you are very, very like
  your father.'</p>

  <p>Warrener took the slim hand extended to him and raised it to his lips.</p>

  <p>'I am more than pleased to meet you,' he said. 'I have heard so much of
  you from my father. He used to allude so frequently to the Towers. He spoke
  of it as one of the most charming houses he had ever been in, and I am bound
  to say that he did not exaggerate. After the rush and fret of a great town,
  this is utterly restful and soothing.'</p>

  <p>Clifford spoke with a deep sincerity in his voice. His gaze wandered from
  the short, thick turf at his feet to the rose-garden, and from the garden to
  the gray walls of the house in its frame of deeper, more frowning gray, and
  the vivid trees beyond. Verily, here was a place to be envied. It looked as
  if trouble and war could not live here, as if the burdens of the world had
  been left on the other side of the stream.</p>

  <p>But Warrener knew better than that; he knew of the grim poverty that
  lurked behind the smiling flowers. He knew of the pride that pinches, the
  pitiful arrogance of the decaying race. And he was in a position to alter
  this with a wave of his wand. He could scatter aside all those carking cares
  and take the wrinkles out of Mr. Castlerayne's brows. He would not have been
  sanguine but for the forces arrayed behind him.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Warrener is going to stay here to-night,' May said. 'There has been a
  mistake over a telegram, and he is stranded here. I will send the donkey-cart
  over to The Haven for the luggage.'</p>

  <p>'Of course,' Aunt Gertrude observed as if it were the most natural thing
  in the world, 'it is a genuine pleasure to have a Warrener here. Your father
  and my brother were such great friends in the past. Come into the hall and
  have some tea.'</p>

  <p>Warrener hesitated. It was hard not to see Angela again; it was equally
  hard to stay there and partake of the hospitality of a man whose prejudices
  the guest was going to violate ruthlessly and mercilessly a little later on.
  But the great oak door of the hall opened at the same moment, and Angela
  stood there with the amber light of the fading sun on her face. She stood
  there tall and fair and stately, a slender figure in white. She started, and
  her face coloured strangely as she saw Warrener. It seemed to him that her
  look was one of cold surprise.</p>

  <p>'I did not expect to see you down here,' she said.</p>

  <p>'We are ever the sport of circumstance,' Warrener replied lightly. 'I have
  been over the Common with your sister. My idea was to stay with the
  Marchmonts to-night; but I find that they are away from home. Miss
  Castlerayne has very kindly offered to put me up this evening. I feel like an
  intruder, really; but&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Angela smiled gloriously. Whatever her feelings might have been, a lack of
  hospitality certainly was not one of them. A Castlerayne could not possibly
  have been guilty of that failing. The girl extended her hand to Warrener
  quite warmly.</p>

  <p>'Of course you will stay the night,' she said. 'I was just coming to call
  the others in to tea. You have certainly arrived at the psychological
  moment.'</p>

  <p>Warrener passed into the dim hall, full of cool brown shadows and sweetly
  fragrant of roses. The light filtered through the stained-glass windows; it
  fell on the dainty tea-service, flickered on the facets of old silver that
  shone as only old silver can. There were comfortable lounges here and there,
  the suggestion of comfort that only a refined English home can give. Warrener
  abandoned himself to the exquisite pleasure of the moment.</p>

  <p>Mr. Castlerayne was glad to see him when he came presently from the study.
  It was a great pleasure to him to have the son of his old friend under his
  roof. Perhaps the host was secretly surprised to find that contamination with
  trade had left no brand on Warrener. Perhaps he had expected to see a man in
  loud clothes, with a loud voice, who talked a jargon of discounts and par
  values and the fluctuation of stocks and shares. So far as Warrener was
  concerned, he, like Gallio, might have cared for none of these things.</p>

  <p>Tea came to an end at length. There was a lovely hour spent in the garden,
  and then dinner. It was a plain dinner, though the wine was excellent; so,
  too, were the peaches and nectarines gathered fresh and ruddy from the ripe
  south wall of the garden. Warrener lingered afterwards over a cigarette and a
  glass of claret the like of which he had never tasted before. He felt just a
  little ashamed of himself; he was a kind of traitor in the camp. He wandered
  off presently to the drawing-room, where the lamps were not yet lit. Angela
  was alone there, playing some soft and soothing melody on the piano.</p>

  <p>'We did not expect you quite so soon,' the girl said. 'The others are in
  the garden. Shall we join them? Really, it is a most exquisite night.'</p>

  <p>It was indeed an exquisite night, full and warm, and gently lighted by a
  crescent moon. A pearly diaphanous mist was rising over the Common. Beyond it
  the great belt of pines loomed out like the masts of ships in a summer
  sea.</p>

  <p>'The Common always looks like a pearly land at this time,' Angela said.
  'It seems almost a pity to get near enough to destroy the illusion.'</p>

  <p>'All people do not take the same view of it.' Warrener laughed. They had
  paused before the old sundial. Angela stood leaning on it with an arm that
  gleamed like ivory in the moonlight. 'I am told that there are prosaic eyes
  on the sacred spot.'</p>

  <p>'I suppose you got that from May,' Angela said a little coldly. 'Some
  people in Hardborough want to start a hotel here. Of course the idea is
  preposterous. Fancy our Common being made the abiding-place of Saturday till
  Monday people, who smoke cheap cigars and drink beer! My father would never
  listen to such a suggestion.'</p>

  <p>The speaker looked proud and scornful in the moonlight. Lady Clare Vere de
  Vere might have presented no more contemptuous a figure. She seemed a being
  of another world, a race apart. And yet in its way it was not devoid of
  cheapness, the juggling of theatrical show. Angela had no sympathy with the
  lower classes, yet she did not so much mind being dependent on these
  creatures for little things she could not pay for.</p>

  <p>'Is your father likely to have the last word?' Warrener asked.</p>

  <p>'Well, really, I suppose so,' Angela said. 'I dare say May has told you
  everything. There is a man called Craggs who has advanced some preposterous
  claim&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I would not run away with that idea if I were you. I believe that Craggs
  and the hospitallers are quite within their rights in this claim. I have gone
  into the matter carefully. To do Craggs justice, he is as much averse to the
  hotel idea as you are. At the same time, he naturally looks to the Common to
  provide the money income to keep up the hospital. Poor old Craggs is just as
  proud in his way as you are.'</p>

  <p>'My <i>dear</i> Mr. Warrener, does the moonlight always make you talk
  nonsense?'</p>

  <p>'I am talking no nonsense,' Clifford repeated. 'Do you know what I would
  do with you if I had my own way? I would make you get your own living amongst
  the people whom in your heart of hearts you so despise! You should go amongst
  them and discover for yourself that there is as much pride and dignity in
  labour as there is in the caste. I have seen enough of it, and I ought to
  know. When I was quite a young man I lodged for a time in the cottage of an
  artisan&mdash;I could afford no better quarters. That man taught me more than
  I ever learnt at school. His feelings and sentiments were those of a refined
  gentleman; his wife was his equal in every way. He is one of my managers
  to-day, respected and liked by all who know him. It is only a matter of
  refinement and education. Craggs would have been a statesman and a Cabinet
  Minister if he had only had the chance of the modern boy. If you took a
  little girl from the slums of London&mdash;the child of the gutter, I
  mean&mdash;and educated her properly, do you suppose that anybody could guess
  what her parentage had been?'</p>

  <p>Angela smiled faintly, with her proud head uplifted to the stars. It was
  strange how this man always thrilled her, how exalted she always felt in his
  company. The girl regarded his lapse into trade as an obsession, the
  backsliding of a gentleman. Perhaps it was contamination with soap that made
  him talk in that way.</p>

  <p>'I should not be in the least interested,' she said. 'I am quite content
  with my lot.'</p>

  <p>'But how long is it likely to be your lot?' Warrener proceeded. 'Forgive
  me if I speak too plainly; only recollect the interest I take in your future
  welfare. Have you ever thought what is likely to take place if anything
  happens to your father? He may die at any time&mdash;we all have to die
  sooner or later. I understand the estate&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'It is very polite of you to call it by that name,' Angela said with some
  bitterness.</p>

  <p>'Goes to the next of kin. It passes from you altogether. Angela, have
  you&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>The girl faced round on Warrener almost angrily. Her eyes were
  blazing.</p>

  <p>'Really,' she said&mdash;'really, Mr Warrener, you forget yourself! Your
  only excuse&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Is the excuse that every man has in the presence of the woman he loves. I
  have never told you that I cared for you, for the simple reason that there is
  no necessity. You <i>know</i> it. If you can look me in the face and say
  honestly that you did not know it&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I think that will do,' Angela interrupted. 'We had better go and find the
  others.'</p>

  <p>She flung her glorious head high in the air. The dignity of her manner was
  queenly, and yet down in her heart was a certain wealth of gladness; her
  lips, red and full, were curved in a little smile.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch5"
     id="ch5">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WARRENER strode along by the side of his companion in
  silence. He was not in the least sorry for what he had said; he felt no
  dismay that he had angered Angela. He did not fail to recognise her good
  qualities, nor was he blind to her faults. After all, it was a selfish and
  useless life that she was leading. And, again, it was one thing to be Miss
  Castlerayne of The Towers, but it would be quite another to be the daughter
  of the late Rayne Castlerayne. What would the girls do when they had to leave
  their ancestral home? These things troubled Warrener.</p>

  <p>In the same silence they walked down the garden, with the house behind
  them. It stood out sharply in the moonlight like a nocturne&mdash;gray,
  graceful, picturesque. The air was heavy with the fragrance of the roses.
  Nothing was needed to make the picture complete. But all that Warrener could
  see now was the hollowness of it all.</p>

  <p>A rustic bridge led from the garden to the fringe of the Common beyond.
  Something white flittered in the gorse, and Warrener made out the forms of
  Aunt Gertrude and May. The upland slope was silver and saffron in the
  moonlight.</p>

  <p>'What a glorious evening!' May cried. 'Positively it is a crime to go in
  yet. I am going as far as the pines to look at the sea.'</p>

  <p>'Won't it be rather damp?' Miss Castlerayne protested.</p>

  <p>But May waved the suggestion aside. With a common accord they turned their
  faces to the slope, slanted upwards. They came at length to the belt of
  pines. Between the rugged boles and the shadow flashed the silver-gray of the
  sea. Far beyond the haze a light flashed from time to time. The cold beauty
  of it all kept the little party silent for a time. It was May who spoke
  first.</p>

  <p>'Let us go round by the hospital,' she suggested, 'and over the headland,
  and so home by way of the village. It is not so very far.'</p>

  <p>The heavy flow of the sea glittered and flashed in the moonlight. Work and
  bustle and the fret of life seemed wonderfully far away. A dull light moved
  in one of the windows of the hospital, and a door opened. A faint moan came
  like a jarring note on the air.</p>

  <p>'Somebody is ill!' May exclaimed. 'They are trying to get Craggs up. It
  looks as if Mrs. Masters was having one of her bad turns.'</p>

  <p>Craggs emerged into the moonlight presently. Evidently he had just tumbled
  out of bed. He was listening with patience to what his visitor had to say.
  The angel of mercy was no more than a child, a little girl with a mass of
  shining curls.</p>

  <p>'Granny's bad,' she said simply in reply to May's questions. 'She has some
  of her pains again; and she wants Dr. Marfell.'</p>

  <p>'Then you go back to granny, and say that Dr Marfell is coming,' May
  said.&mdash;'I know exactly what is the matter with the poor old thing. A
  little brandy and a mustard-leaf is all that she requires. Aunt Gertrude, let
  us go and get the medicine.'</p>

  <p>'She's really bad this time,' Craggs explained. 'I saw her last thing
  to-night. Always was a bit of a grumbler was Martha; but to-night she's
  suffering terrible.'</p>

  <p>'We'll fetch the doctor,' Warrener volunteered. He turned to find that
  Miss Castlerayne and May had already vanished.&mdash;'Will you show me the
  way, Miss Angela?'</p>

  <p>'It is on the way home,' Angela explained. 'We might just as well take
  that path as any other. Mrs. Masters has a wonderful recuperative faculty.
  Still&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>The girl shrugged her shoulders slightly and led the way. Evidently she
  had but little sympathy with the sufferings of Mrs. Masters. Also, she was
  not disposed to amiable conversation. She carried her head still higher in
  the air. She pointed presently to a pretty white-creeper-covered cottage, and
  intimated that here was the residence of Dr Marfell.</p>

  <p>In response to Warrener's ring a little man came to the door. He was short
  in his manner. His white closely cropped hair stood on his head like a
  scrubbing-brush.</p>

  <p>'Who are you, and what do you require?' he asked.&mdash;'Good-evening,
  Miss Castlerayne. Hope there is nothing wrong, for I'm dog-tired. Out for two
  nights in succession, out all day to-day, and no food since breakfast.'</p>

  <p>'It's at the hospital,' Warrener explained curtly. He rather resented the
  shortness of the other's manner. 'A Mrs. Masters, I believe. If you will be
  so kind&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I won't be so kind,' the doctor cried. 'I don't know who you are, sir,
  but I decline to be ordered about in this manner. And as to that old woman, I
  tell you plainly that there is nothing whatever the matter with her. Besides,
  why should I work for nothing? I'm supposed to be doctor to the hospital. I'm
  supposed to get a fee of thirty guineas per annum to look after the health of
  these people&mdash;that is supposed to be Mr. Castlerayne's affair&mdash;and
  not one penny have I had for the last eight years.'</p>

  <p>The words sounded rude enough; they were abrupt to the verge of brutality,
  and yet there was nothing of the savage in the little doctor's expression.
  There was even a suggestion of a humorous twinkle in his eyes. And Warrener
  could not know that here was a man who worked hard for a poor pittance, and
  who never listened unmoved to a story of distress. Perhaps he was too
  familiar with the idiosyncrasies of Mrs. Masters.</p>

  <p>'I am sorry to disturb you,' Warrener said coldly, 'but I am under the
  impression that the poor woman is really ill. Samuel Craggs says so.
  Still&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'There, don't be huffy,' Marfell cried. 'How would you like to be dragged
  away from your first meal to attend an obstinate old woman who will eat nuts
  when she has been told over and over again that they are not good for her?
  Not that I withdraw a single word as to my long-belated fees, and my giving
  up my one luxury, my cigar, to keep my boy at his London hospital. I'll
  go.'</p>

  <p>'I shall be very happy to pay your fee,' Warrener said.</p>

  <p>'You pay my fee when I ask for it,' Marfell snapped. 'Confound the old
  woman!&mdash;Miss Castlerayne, I'm positively ashamed to have so far
  forgotten myself in your presence. It was very wrong of me.'</p>

  <p>'An apology is hardly necessary, Dr Marfell,' Angela said coldly. 'I dare
  say&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'My dear young lady, I am not apologising,' the doctor cried. 'The way I
  am being treated over the hospital fees is disgraceful. I have told your
  father so. I am a great fool not to have put him in the county court long
  ago.' Without another word the speaker bustled away up the path below the
  rolling gorse.</p>

  <p>Warrener could see that the face of his companion was flaming with shame
  and anger.</p>

  <p>'You must not take Dr. Marfell too seriously,' she said. 'He is really one
  of the best and kindest of men. He has been known to give his own dinner to a
  poor patient in need of a meal. And, really, old Mrs. Masters is a confirmed
  grumbler. Shall we get along a little faster? It is very late.'</p>

  <p>Warrener increased his pace as desired. On the whole, he was not sorry to
  see Angela lifted from her lofty pedestal in this way. It was all very well
  to be a Castlerayne of Castlerayne Towers, but less exalted people might have
  questioned the honesty of that distinguished family. And Warrener had gone
  through all that in his younger days. But there was a lesson in store for
  Angela.</p>

  <p>In the porch of the house Rayne Castlerayne stood. He looked quite the
  patrician in his evening-dress, the typical master of broad acres; also, he
  was smoking a cigar of most excellent quality.</p>

  <p>'Where have you all been?' he asked. 'It is past ten o'clock. Angela, your
  aunt and May have gone out again on some ridiculous errand to the hospital.
  Somebody ill, or something of that kind. Really, those poor people are most
  inconsiderate. They wait till the very last thing at night, and then think
  nothing of keeping everybody up for hours. Why could they not have sent for
  Marfell?'</p>

  <p>'They did,' Angela said with a vexed laugh. 'Mr. Warrener kindly went for
  him. And he was most rude. He volunteered to Mr. Warrener, who is a perfect
  stranger, that he had had no fees in reference to the hospital for eight
  years, and that he was very foolish not to have put you in the county court
  long ago.'</p>

  <p>No glow of shame tinged the cheeks of the listener. On the contrary, he
  smiled as if something amused him.</p>

  <p>'Capital fellow Marfell, when you know him,' he said with a faint air of
  patronage. 'And, upon my word, it really is time I paid that hospital
  account. The same remark applies to many others of those tradesmen's
  bills.&mdash;Come and have a cigar, Warrener. I have a new sort down from
  London to-day; a little expensive, but an excellent cigar.'</p>

  <p>Warrener declined the tempting offer. If his host would excuse him, he
  would go along the Common again and meet Miss Castlerayne coming back.</p>

  <p>They came presently with the information that the patient was really ill
  this time, and that Dr. Marfell had promised to stay for some time. Miss
  Castlerayne laid a detaining hand on Warrener's arm, so that May might
  precede her into the house. She looked white and anxious.</p>

  <p>'Why does the matter trouble you so?' Warrener asked.</p>

  <p>'Because I am to blame,' Miss Castlerayne said. 'Dr. Marfell says that the
  symptoms point to typhoid fever. He has told me over and over again to have
  the drains at the hospital thoroughly renovated&mdash;he had threatened to
  report me to the authorities; and I have not the money. I actually sold some
  jewellery to find the money for Craggs. It is a dreadful thing that I should
  be conspiring against my own family in this way, but what can I do? I have
  exhausted my little capital on the hospital. I dared not let those poor
  people want. They look forward to the hospital for their old age as a sacred
  right, which it is; and now I have nothing further to give them. It is
  useless to approach my brother, for the simple reason that he has practically
  nothing beyond his debts. If he were not Rayne Castlerayne of The Towers he
  would have been sold up without mercy years ago. Oh! I am tired and weary of
  his kind of pride&mdash;pride that lives on other people's credulity, and
  which revolts from the idea of making the place a paying property. That is
  why I flung in my lot with Craggs, why I pray that he should beat my brother
  and bring us prosperity. I hate that hotel idea myself; but what can we do?
  And now it is absolutely necessary to spend at least four hundred pounds on
  the hospital. If it isn't done I shall feel like a murderess.'</p>

  <p>'Let me do it,' Warrener said eagerly. 'Let me find the money. And permit
  me to have the pleasure of advancing the necessary funds to keep the hospital
  going. It is only for a time. Believe me, you can repay every penny later on
  if you like. Am I mistaken in understanding that under your father's will a
  certain portion of the income of the estate comes to you?'</p>

  <p>'Eight hundred a year,' Aunt Gertrude said with a faint smile. 'Which is
  just twice what my brother's revenue amounts to. The mockery of it!'</p>

  <p>'Not at all,' Warrener said coolly. 'You shall have your income. The great
  conspiracy is going to be successful if it costs me half my fortune. But
  there will be a sharp lesson first, and Angela shall have her share of it. It
  will be exceedingly good for Angela.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch6"
     id="ch6">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AUNT GERTRUDE started and quivered; there was a faint pink
  on her faded cheeks. Warrener turned to see the cause of this sudden display
  of emotion. He saw that Angela was standing there pale and cold in the
  moonlight. She said nothing, she asked no question, though clearly she must
  have heard what was said. She ignored Clifford as if she had been absolutely
  unaware of his existence.</p>

  <p>'You must come in, Aunt Gertrude,' she said. 'The night is getting
  chilly.'</p>

  <p>Miss Castlerayne followed with the meek obedience of a little child who is
  detected in a fault. In her heart of hearts she was terribly afraid of
  Angela. Warrener walked behind, with a smile on his lips. So far as he was
  concerned, he had not the slightest doubt as to the ultimate issue. He could
  see the sword of Damocles hanging in the air; he was prepared to cut the
  suspending thread if the weapon did not fall as quickly as he desired. He
  would root this senseless, selfish pride out once and for all.</p>

  <p>He was just as set of purpose the next morning as he came across the
  Common before breakfast from a long interview with Samuel Craggs. He had
  found the old reformer in a savage state of mind. Craggs had been talking to
  Marfell.</p>

  <p>'We are being murdered here,' he had said, 'poisoned. It's the drains. I
  told the squire all about them years ago. But where the money is coming
  from&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Warrener explained where the money was coming from. Also, Craggs need be
  under no fear as to the future of the hospital.</p>

  <p>'It is merely money borrowed,' he said. 'I shall get it all back again as
  soon as you win your action, so there need be no outrage of your sturdy
  Radicalism. I want you to press your action on as keenly as possible. The
  squire will fight you, and he will be badly beaten. And he will not be in a
  position to pay the costs of the fight. Really, I am very much in love with
  the little scheme of mine. I'm going into Hardborough as soon as I have
  breakfasted, and I shall hope to meet you there after luncheon. And I hope
  you have the grace to be very much ashamed of yourself, Craggs.'</p>

  <p>'I ain't,' Craggs said stolidly. 'Not a bit of it. On the whole, though
  I'm what you call Socialist, not to say iconoclast, I like your scheme better
  than mine, sir. I love the place too well to see a hotel here.'</p>

  <p>'To say nothing of the fact that we can do so much better, Craggs. What
  would my friends in the City say if they could see me losing such a glorious
  chance of making money? Instead of which, I am wasting my time putting it in
  the pockets of other people!'</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was the glow of a clear conscience that enabled Clifford to eat
  so good a breakfast. He walked in the rose-garden afterwards, enjoying his
  cigarette. Aunt Gertrude was not down yet, and May was not to be seen.
  Presently to Clifford came Angela. She looked very fair and dainty in her
  white print dress, with plain cuffs and collar. It was a beautiful face,
  Warrener thought; it would be all the more lovely still without the cold
  expression. It was quite evident that the girl had something serious to say
  to her companion.</p>

  <p>'Been helping to make the beds?' he asked cheerfully. Like most utterly
  bald remarks, it had its effect. In the presence of the commonplace, even
  dignity turns its face. 'If ever I am so fortunate as to win a wife, I hope
  she will not be above helping with the beds. I wonder if you could make a
  tart, Miss Angela&mdash;a raspberry and red-currant tart. I'm told that it is
  a real art properly to boil a potato.'</p>

  <p>The ghost of a smile curved Angela's lips for a moment. Really, she had
  not expected to find Clifford Warrener vulgar.</p>

  <p>'I know nothing of what you say,' she replied. 'I did not come from the
  house to discuss domestic economy with you. I wanted to allude to a little
  conversation I overheard last night between Aunt Gertrude and yourself. You
  seem to have made a friend of Aunt Gertrude.'</p>

  <p>Warrener bent down and sniffed at the red heart of a rose. So Angela had
  heard. All her queenly dignity had come back to her; she was once more a
  Castlerayne of The Towers sweetly condescending to a glorified tradesman who
  had forgotten the calls of his order. It became necessary, therefore, to be
  harsh once more.</p>

  <p>'I should say that anybody would,' he said. 'Are you aware that at one
  time your aunt was engaged to my father? When my father decided to go into
  trade the match was broken off. My mother is one of the best and dearest of
  women; my father's affection for her was warm and sincere; but his heart was
  Aunt Gertrude's. When I think of it I am filled with the most bitter contempt
  for those who interfered. But, of course, it could not be; it was quite
  impossible that your blood could be contaminated with trade. Miss Angela, I
  am going to speak very plainly to you.'</p>

  <p>Angela gave a little gasp; she faltered before the blazing fire in
  Warrener's eyes. Verily, the interview was not working out quite so smoothly
  as she had planned it. She was going to be cold and dignified, sarcastic, but
  always as befitted her father's child. She was going to insist upon a proper
  explanation of Warrener's cryptic words of the night before. She had made up
  her mind to forgive him if he were duly penitent. And now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Really,' she faltered, 'I am quite at a loss to understand
  why&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Then I had better hasten to explain. I won't speak about your early life,
  but about mine. My father decided to go into trade because he was an honest
  man. He had an eccentric weakness for paying his debts. He could not
  understand why my grandfather never paid anybody. The fact that my father was
  a very unsuccessful business man has nothing to do with the story. Suffice it
  to say that he brought me up to share that eccentric weakness of his, and
  that I have never regretted it. When some twelve years of age I went to stay
  with my grandfather. We were poor enough, and often we lived the life of the
  keenest anxiety; but it was better than the life at the other place. My
  grandfather lived in a very cycle of debt; all his nicest feelings were
  warped. My grandfather counted the cost of nothing so long as he got all he
  wanted. He was a fine gentleman; he was a man of honour; he was a Warrener,
  in short; but that did not prevent three of his victims from dying in a
  workhouse and one of them from committing suicide. I tell you, no swindling
  scoundrel in the City was more degraded in my eyes than my grandfather. I
  hated and loathed it all. I got away from it as soon as I could, and I was
  only a boy at the time. To think of those poor, patient creatures being
  robbed so that the good name of the family for hospitality could be kept up!
  Nothing was paid for. It was no better than picking pockets. And there was
  the man who spoke in tones of the deepest regret for his son who had gone
  into business! But I dare say you are wondering why I tell you this. Let me
  ask you a question: Do <i>you</i> know any household where exactly the same
  kind of thing is going on to-day?'</p>

  <p>Angela's face flamed crimson; the cruel tell-tale tide flamed over her
  features; the tiny ears were pink with an agony of shame. Warrener had struck
  home, and he had struck hard.</p>

  <p>'You are going too far,' the girl said. Her voice shook; her eyes were
  full of tears. 'It is not fair to say this when you are under the shadow of
  our house. And it is not true.'</p>

  <p>'It <i>is</i> true,' Warrener said slowly. 'Oh, I know that this talk of
  mine is inconsistent&mdash;that it exceeds the bounds of what society calls
  good taste. In ordinary circumstances I should say good-bye to you and go;
  but I can't say good-bye to you, Angela, because I love you, and because some
  day I hope to call you my wife. There is everything that is good and sweet
  under that cold manner of yours; but the time has to come when you shall
  realise that to be Miss Castlerayne of The Towers is not everything.'</p>

  <p>'I suppose you mean to pay me a compliment,' Angela cried. 'If that is
  your idea&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'It is. I am paying you the highest compliment a man can pay to a woman.
  The remark is trite, but it is true, all the same. And I tell you I am glad
  that you are going to have your lesson. Before long The Towers will cease to
  belong to you.'</p>

  <p>'Really, is this part of the lesson that you have arranged for me?'</p>

  <p>'The lesson is no doing of mine. Later on you will thank Craggs for that.
  It sounds like a wild and impossible situation from some play, Miss
  Castlerayne being ousted from her high estate by Craggs the Radical
  shoemaker! Craggs will fight your father to the end, and he will win his
  action. He is certain to succeed in proving the rights of the hospital to the
  Common. I have been all through his claim, and there is not a flaw in it. On
  the other hand, your father will fight as bitterly and as obstinately. He
  will lose, and the action will cost every penny of two thousand pounds. It
  won't be for Craggs to forgo these expenses, because they will form part of
  the costs of his solicitors; and solicitors keep their offices open for the
  specific purpose of making costs. They will bring a further action against
  your father for the raising of this money. They will make a bankrupt of him
  if he does not pay. Then, everything here will be sold and the house will
  have to be let. May I ask, Miss Angela, what is going to become of you
  then?'</p>

  <p>Angela looked at the speaker with dull eyes. She was trying to comprehend
  what all those hard, cold words meant. The full force of the picture was
  coming to her slowly. She tried to smile, but the smile faded from her lips.
  All her dignity was gone now; she was merely a very pretty girl mutely asking
  for a strong man's protection.</p>

  <p>'And this is your lesson?' she faltered. 'This is what you hope will
  happen?'</p>

  <p>'It is your own lesson,' Warrener retorted, 'brought about by yourself.
  And you will be the better for it. Still, there is an alternative.'</p>

  <p>'I am glad to hear that. Will you be so good as to tell me what it
  is?'</p>

  <p>'Not at present&mdash;that would spoil the actual beauty of the story. But
  one thing you may be sure of: this lovely spot will not be defiled by a
  hotel. There is a far better way out of the difficulty than that. I would
  suggest it to your father to-day, but I feel quite sure he would not listen
  to me. He also will have to learn his lesson at the hands of the immovable
  Craggs. After the lesson is learnt, I shall come in again as a kind of fairy
  godfather and put things right. I shall put things right mainly by the use of
  the money that I have made in my despised trade. Where my model village
  stands to-day was once desolation and misery and demons in drink. To-day the
  place blooms like a rose. In this lovely spot is anxiety and doubt and
  despair; when I have done with it all those demons will be gone. I can't tell
  you more, Angela, because if I did so I should spoil the romance of the
  story. There is one thing that I ask: that you will give me credit for a
  sincere desire to&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Angela looked up swiftly. She had forgotten that she had had all the worst
  of the argument. She saw the high resolution that shone in Clifford's eyes;
  she felt like one who is in the presence of a prophet. Her heart was
  curiously warm and light; she felt strangely drawn towards this masterful
  man.</p>

  <p>'I do,' she cried impetuously. 'Perhaps I am utterly wrong. Perhaps we
  have lived in far too narrow a circle here. Mr. Warrener, let us shake hands.
  Though we are to be foes we may respect each other. And if you <i>can</i>
  convert me&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch7"
     id="ch7">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE girls sat out on the Common in the full glory of the
  sunshine. It was a day in late September, one of those perfectly still
  afternoons when the air is heavy with the hum of insects and the bees drug
  themselves with the saffron. Ever and again there was a touch of crispness in
  the sea-breeze, but the great sheet of blue lay there under the veiled light
  like the shimmer of innumerable jewels. From somewhere inland came the drone
  of a threshing-machine. The gorse was touched here and there with points of
  flame&mdash;the second bloom of the year; but the heath had lost its purple
  sheen now, though the bracken was turning from russet-brown to gold and
  purple and crimson. There was never a time, May thought, when the Common
  lacked a mantle of beauty. It seemed impossible to be anything but peaceful
  and contented there; but both the girls looked a little restless and anxious,
  as if expecting something. They were both very silent, with their eyes turned
  towards the sea. It was May who spoke first.</p>

  <p>'I dare say the matter is settled by this time,' she said.</p>

  <p>'What matter?' Angela asked with a poor attempt at indifference. 'I was
  trying to forget it. May, I believe that you are in sympathy with the
  enemy.'</p>

  <p>'I don't recognise that Craggs is an enemy,' the younger girl replied.
  'Why blame him? He is acting for the best from his point of view. And,
  whatever happens, we shall not be any worse off than we are at present.
  Suppose Craggs loses his action, how does that benefit us? Dad will have
  established his right to do what he pleases with the Common. He will be
  monarch of all he surveys. He will refuse to let anybody come here. He will
  repudiate that hotel idea with scorn.'</p>

  <p>'But you admitted just now that you hated that hotel scheme!'</p>

  <p>'So I do. Dad will do nothing; he would refuse to permit any industry
  here, however remunerative. Castleraynes have no connection with business.
  Craggs will have no scruples of the kind. He wants to win so that this
  classic spot can be used for the benefit of the hospitallers. That is why I
  hope he will win.'</p>

  <p>Angela turned from the speaker with a gesture of contempt.</p>

  <p>'What do you <i>want</i> to see here?' she asked. 'Oh, why are we so poor?
  Why can't we find minerals here&mdash;coal, or something of that kind?'</p>

  <p>'The Spanish fleet you cannot see, because it's not in sight,' May quoted
  with a laugh. 'There is no coal here. As you have learnt by personal
  experience, I have a poetic mind, Angela. I want Craggs to win so that dad
  can't interfere with the Great Scheme. I have spoken of the Great Scheme
  before.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, you have,' Angela sighed. 'The Great Scheme is to make our fortunes.
  I hardly think that dad would turn his back on a prospect like that.'</p>

  <p>'He would. I sounded him. He pronounced the whole thing ridiculous. That
  is why he is to-day wasting his time and money in York defending the action
  which has been brought against him by the hospitallers. If he wins, then
  good-bye to all prospect of peace and happiness in the future. But he will
  not win.'</p>

  <p>Angela plucked impatiently at a spike or two of gentian. She had heard of
  the hints of possible fortune many times lately. For the past three months
  May had been cryptic and mysterious; she had discussed Craggs's action with a
  smile of meaning, though she kept her secret well. And to-day was the second
  of the trial of the action Craggs <i>versus</i> Castlerayne, and at any time
  the verdict might arrive from York Assizes. Outwardly indifferent, Angela was
  inwardly in a fever of expectation. She was heart and soul on the side of her
  father; she would have been prepared to make any sacrifice to uphold the
  honour of the family.</p>

  <p>'What is this precious secret of yours?' she asked. 'I feel sure that it
  is something between you and Mr. Warrener. Why do you keep it from me?'</p>

  <p>'Because I promised to say nothing to anybody. And it is Mr. Warrener's
  idea. Mind you, he is quite powerless unless Craggs wins his action. Dad will
  never listen to the scheme if he keeps control of the Common.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, indeed? Then this is a deliberate plot to bring about something that
  will be distasteful to us Castleraynes. A soap-factory perhaps. Or maybe a
  steam laundry. That would be a natural conclusion to the Warrener soap.
  Extensive drying-grounds of five hundred acres close to the sea! Are you
  going to be manageress?'</p>

  <p>May laughed pleasantly. She remarked that Angela looked very handsome when
  she was angry.</p>

  <p>'You are foolish,' May said, 'and very narrow in your views. There will be
  no steam laundry and no building of any kind if you except the restoration of
  the Dower-House. And this lovely common will not be touched; the Great Scheme
  will provide for its being left intact for ever. People will come here from
  all parts of the kingdom; they will rise up and call the creator of the
  scheme blessed. Angela, what is the present value of our land that fringes
  the whole of the Common?'</p>

  <p>'Really, I don't know,' Angela replied. 'Martin says the five thousand
  acres of ours would be dear at half that amount of money. Why?'</p>

  <p>'Because those gorsy acres are worth a fortune. Honestly, I am not joking.
  I know you give Mr. Clifford Warrener no credit for imagination; but in my
  eyes he is a poet. Like me, he is a benefactor to his race. Why did he not
  fall in love with me instead of you?'</p>

  <p>'It seems a pity,' Angela said, with a red stain on her cheeks. 'If you
  care for him&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Not in that way. I could, easily enough, all the same. But he chose you
  instead; in fact, he told me so at the same time as he took me into his
  confidence over the Great Scheme. That beautiful imagination of his took in
  the whole thing; he saw the jewel lying at our feet, though we were too blind
  to see it for ourselves.'</p>

  <p>Angela shrugged her shoulders indifferently; she turned away her head to
  the sea. She was too proud to ask for further particulars, though her
  curiosity was aflame.</p>

  <p>'Goblin gold,' she said, with the petals of a head of gorse in her
  fingers. 'If this scheme would only pay some of those dreadful bills of ours,
  why&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Oh, it will. It will pay everybody; dad will be rich <i>malgré lui</i>.
  And in the course of time he will refer with pride to the brilliant qualities
  of his son-in-law.'</p>

  <p>Angela rose with cold and frosty dignity. Really, May's joke was in very
  bad taste. And yet, deep down in her heart, Angela was a little sore and
  annoyed with Warrener. She had never forgotten that morning amongst the
  roses&mdash;the morning when Warrener had spoken so plainly to her, and she
  had responded with outstretched hand and a challenge to him to convert her to
  his side if he could. In spite of some provocation, Angela had behaved very
  well on that occasion, and she was cognisant of the fact.</p>

  <p>She had quite come to admit Warrener's high qualities. He was a handsome
  man, too, and his family was as good as the Castleraynes. Also, he had spoken
  quite freely of his admiration for Angela. Also, she had not resented the
  boldness of his speech. And Angela had been reading a good deal of
  Shakespeare lately; she had been especially affected by the <i>Taming of the
  Shrew.</i> Unconsciously, her point of view had been Petruchio's. And here
  was the story of it all. Warrener had not been near The Towers since that
  June morning when he and Angela had stood face to face in the roses. Not one
  line had he sent the whole time. It never occurred to Angela to ask who had
  been responsible for all that work at the hospital or who paid for the staff
  of nurses who came to grapple with the demon of typhoid there. Warrener had
  gone away and made no sign. He had been playing with her.</p>

  <p>The girls were by the edge of the hospital now. A figure crossed the lawn
  in the direction of the stone sundial, and May called aloud.</p>

  <p>'Why, there is Craggs!' she exclaimed. 'He is back from York already.
  Beyond doubt the case is finished. Angela, let us go and get the
  verdict.'</p>

  <p>Angela raised no objection. She was thrilled and eager to know the result.
  From the bottom of her heart she detested Craggs; she was a little ashamed
  that she should give so much feeling to so commonplace an object.
  Nevertheless, now her step was as quick as May's, her lips were parted more
  widely. Craggs raised a hand to his cap; the serenity of his gnarled old face
  was unchanged.</p>

  <p>'I came back last night,' he explained. 'They said as I should not be
  wanted any more. I dare say as the case is done with by this time.'</p>

  <p>'But you must be very anxious, of course. You arranged for a
  telegram?'</p>

  <p>Craggs shook his head and smiled. He appeared to be exasperatingly sure of
  his ground, Angela thought. It was very unladylike, but she would have liked
  to shake him.</p>

  <p>'Lord bless you, miss!' he said, 'there's no doubt about it.'</p>

  <p>'But why did you start this claim?' Angela burst out. Her face was white;
  her eyes were flaming with indignation. 'I call it disgraceful of you,
  Craggs. After all the years that you have lived on the estate,
  to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Angela's indignation deprived her of further speech. The slow,
  tolerant&mdash;not to say patronising&mdash;smile did not fade from the old
  man's face. On the grass in the sun two little girls were playing. Craggs
  called to them; he laid a hand on the shoulder of each. There was something
  very manly and very tender about the old fellow now.</p>

  <p>'Look at these two,' he said gently. 'Granddaughters of MacMasters, who
  was your family body-servant for fifty faithful years. Look at
  them&mdash;ain't they two pictures? Look at their blue eyes, their fair hair,
  and their lovely colouring. They are like the pictures as you have at The
  Towers.&mdash;Run away, little kittens, and go back to your play.&mdash;You
  ask me a question, Miss Angela, and I'll answer it. If things don't mend
  soon, who is going to look after the pretty creatures? What is going to
  become of 'em? Why, they are going to the workhouse. We are all going to the
  workhouse. And why? Because Castlerayne has failed in his duty to his people;
  he has forgotten his honour. For three steady generations you have wasted
  your property; you might, at any rate, have recollected those who were
  faithful to you, and put the money aside for the upkeep of the hospital. I
  tell you that was a debt of honour. The plumbago went, and then our spring of
  water went, and we should all be at the big house over beyond the village if
  it hadn't been for Miss Gertrude. Then we were dying of disease; we should
  have all been dead but for Mr. Warrener, who found the money to make the
  place fit for habitation. You want me to fold my hands and do nothing, to see
  those dear little children that Christ loves beyond us all carried off to
  herd it with the scum of the town. As for me, the hospital is my birthright.
  I looked forward to this home for my old age. I trusted to the word of a
  Castlerayne; but I trust to it no longer. And yet there is a funny side to it
  all.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, indeed?' Angela said coldly. 'I confess that I fail to see it.
  Perhaps you will be so good as to enlighten me on that point.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch8"
     id="ch8">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE lines about the corner of Craggs's mouth relaxed for a
  moment. Angela would have felt less dignified if she had only known how
  completely and thoroughly the old man read her.</p>

  <p>'The gift of humour is one of God's good things,' Craggs remarked
  sententiously. 'It came to me somewhere about the first time I had a few
  words with my old missis. Perhaps that's why we lived so happily together. It
  is a funny thing that old Craggs should be fighting the squire and getting
  the best of him. It's a queer thing that indirectly I am making the squire's
  fortune in spite of himself. But we need not go into that. If I can see the
  hospital on a proper footing that's all I care for.'</p>

  <p>Angela turned and walked in the direction of the gate. She was filled with
  a strong idea that Craggs had had all the best of the argument. And it would
  have been a dreadful thing for all those poor people to go to the workhouse.
  The exodus would have been reflected on the Castleraynes. Angela looked
  thoughtfully at the picturesque building, with its brown-and-golden face, the
  lattice windows, and the fruit-trees in the garden beyond. There was quite a
  picturesque flavour about the hospital&mdash;it had been a feature of the
  landscape to point out to visitors with some pride. Here in this fair haven
  of rest the doyens of the clan lived out the evening of their lives, secure
  in the bounty of a powerful chief. Thus Angela had always regarded it. Craggs
  had been pleased to put a different face on it altogether, and Craggs's
  speech had not been couched in the language of diplomacy. In the highly
  coloured metaphor of the day, he had rubbed it in.</p>

  <p>'And every word of it true,' May declared as the girls went down the
  winding path together. 'It would be a shameful thing if anything happened to
  these people. Well, I won't pursue the subject any further. Let us go home
  and have some tea&mdash;that is, providing the grocer has sent it. He
  intimated in a letter to-day that he must decline further credit unless he
  has a cheque on account. Oh, how sick and tired I am of it all! I should be
  far happier behind the counter of a shop!'</p>

  <p>Tea was ready laid in the dim, oak-panelled hall where the family
  portraits hung. Perhaps the sordid soul of the grocer had relaxed, for the
  tea was there fresh and strong, and Aunt Gertrude sat by the side of the
  table. No message had come from York, though by this time doubtless the court
  had risen. The cosy meal was despatched, the daylight began to fade, and the
  lamps appeared, and yet no message from York. It was a little before
  dinner-time when the head of the house returned.</p>

  <p>'We quite expected a telegram from you, father,' Angela said
  reproachfully.</p>

  <p>'I dare say it would have been better,' Mr. Castlerayne admitted candidly.
  'Fact is, I went with Brownlow to see some horses that he had been buying,
  and forgot all about it. A pair of dark bays, Angela, dirt cheap at four
  hundred guineas.'</p>

  <p>May's eyes twinkled. All this was so like her father.</p>

  <p>Angela flushed angrily. It was very unfortunate; but she lacked the saving
  grace which Craggs had found in the early days of his married life. She laid
  her hand on Mr. Castlerayne's shoulder; the pressure of her fingers was
  warmer than was absolutely necessary.</p>

  <p>'We have spent a miserably anxious day,' she said. 'I have been most
  restless and unhappy. And all you can talk about is Mr Brownlow's new horses!
  How did the case go on?'</p>

  <p>'Bless me, there is the dinner-bell!' Mr. Castlerayne exclaimed, 'and I am
  not dressed yet. I'll tell you all about it after the servants have put the
  dinner on the table. Tell Williams that I shall want a bottle of the
  claret&mdash;<i>the</i> claret, mind. And let him be more
  careful&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>The rest of the speech was lost in the gloom of the corridor.</p>

  <p>The dinner dragged slowly along from the soup to the grouse and the
  entrée, and the sweets afterwards. There were the ruddy, lovely peaches, the
  blooming grapes, the claret warmed to a nicety and poured from the cup given
  to the last profligate Castlerayne by George the Fourth. To use simple words,
  Rayne Castlerayne calculated that that jug had cost half a million of money.
  There are times when the favour of a monarch proves expensive.</p>

  <p>'Well,' Angela asked as the door closed behind the butler, 'tell us what
  happened.'</p>

  <p>'How impatient the girl is!' Mr. Castlerayne protested. 'Gertrude, the
  grouse had not been hung quite long enough. Oh, the action? Craggs was quite
  right. Indeed, I was told yesterday morning that I had a poor case. I was
  advised then that it would be better to withdraw, and save a hundred or two
  in lawyers' fees, but I refused. Couldn't give in like that, you know. Most
  tiresome case all along. Those fellows talked and argued until I didn't quite
  understand whether I was plaintiff or defendant. But the judge held that the
  hospitallers had a vested interest in the Common, and that they had the right
  to use it for their benefit, provided that they don't sell it, or dig for
  minerals, or anything of that kind. Very annoying; but at any rate nobody can
  blame me for the hotel that is going to be erected on the Common. Not that
  I've done with Craggs yet by any means. I shall certainly take the case to
  the Court of Appeal.'</p>

  <p>'But that will want a deal of money,' May protested. 'How much do you
  think has been spent already in this action? But I suppose you have no
  idea.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Castlerayne poured himself out another glass of claret with a judicial
  air. As he sat there, well groomed, smart, debonnaire, he did not in the
  least resemble the bankrupt that he really was. He was surrounded with every
  luxury, with the reflected refulgence of absolute prosperity; in short, he
  was the head of the Castleraynes. There was something like a frown on his
  face as he turned to May.</p>

  <p>'My dear child, you pay a poor compliment to my intelligence,' he said.
  'It is not to be supposed that I have gone into the unfortunate action with
  my eyes shut. I gathered from my lawyers to-day what has been expended up to
  now.'</p>

  <p>'Was that after you had broached the question of an appeal?' May
  asked.</p>

  <p>'Well, yes. I am bound to admit that it was. I told Summers that I could
  not possibly allow matters to end in this unsatisfactory verdict. He reminded
  me that from first to last I had incurred a responsibility of some fifteen
  hundred pounds.'</p>

  <p>'Every penny of which you will have to pay,' May suggested.</p>

  <p>'That, I understand, is the position. I either pay up, or I appeal. If I
  appeal and win there is an end of the matter.'</p>

  <p>'And if you appeal and lose,' May asked, 'what will happen in that case,
  dad?'</p>

  <p>Mr. Castlerayne declined to discuss the matter further. He had quite made
  up his mind what to do, and as head of the family he could not tolerate any
  interference. Furthermore, he wanted to know if anybody had seen his
  cigar-case. He had no feeling of animosity against Craggs, though he
  confessed that he was a little ashamed at the fellow's ingratitude.</p>

  <p>May had a mind to ask where the ingratitude came in, but she wisely
  refrained.</p>

  <p>'There is only one thing I should like to know,' she said as she rose from
  the table. 'It is quite useless to talk about an appeal. Mr. Summers will
  refuse to do anything of the kind till you have some security for his
  expenses. What I should like to know is where the fifteen hundred pounds is
  coming from. Seeing that we are not in a position to pay for the necessaries
  of life&mdash;such as grouse, and brown trout, and the like&mdash;where is
  this big sum coming from? I ask this because I should like to know how soon
  it will be necessary for me to get something to do.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Castlerayne frowned at his claret-glass. He saw some parallel between
  himself and King Lear. He was pained to find that his every action did not
  meet with the entire approval of his family. Doubtless the money would come
  from somewhere. Summers was a clever fellow, and he could devise some scheme.
  That was what lawyers were paid for. Meanwhile, he would like to know what
  had become of that day's <i>Times</i>.</p>

  <p>'He's absolutely hopeless,' May sighed as she took a seat in the
  drawing-room. 'He is quite as unreasonable as any child. Aunt, what are you
  crying about?'</p>

  <p>Two large tears gathered in Aunt Gertrude's eyes and rolled down upon her
  knitting. She looked like a guilty child about voluminously to confess to
  some fault.</p>

  <p>'It's so dreadful, May,' she sobbed. 'I'm glad Angela is not here. Angela
  is so hard at times. She never seems to feel anything.'</p>

  <p>'Oh yes, she does,' May said. 'She has gone to bed. Whenever Angela goes
  to bed early it is to have a good cry. She is at the present moment weeping
  on her lonely pillow. And now, what are you blaming yourself about, you dear
  old thing?'</p>

  <p>'I'm blaming myself, May. It is all my doing. I gave Craggs nearly all I
  possessed to fight this case. I could see that we could not last very much
  longer. I could see that everything would have to go. It was only by drawing
  on my savings that I kept certain creditors from taking serious steps. But it
  was the future of the hospital that troubled me, May. I could not sleep at
  nights for thinking of it. There was a plain and sacred duty before me. It
  would have been such a mean and despicable thing to let those people go to
  the workhouse. And yet I could not possibly see how to avoid it. And then
  when things got to the very worst, when Craggs discovered that it was I who
  was keeping up the funds of the hospital, he told me what he had discovered
  years before: that the hospitallers had a vested right in the Common. That
  was after the hotel scheme was mooted. I knew that in ordinary circumstances
  your father would never consent to the project, and saw in it rent enough
  from the hotel to save the hospital. But Craggs had no money. Oh, if you only
  knew how I was torn and distracted! I prayed for guidance. I could only see a
  way whereby I should be guilty of treachery to my own flesh and blood, and
  yet not to do something would have been more wicked and unworthy. So, in the
  end, I gave Craggs that money. And in my heart of hearts I am glad that I did
  so. I am glad that I acted so. I could not possibly go on like this much
  longer, May.'</p>

  <p>'Of course we can't,' May cried. She rose to her feet and paced up and
  down the room. 'I can see quite plainly what is going to happen. The largest
  sums of money are represented by lawyers' costs. They will not spare dad as
  his poor creditors do. They will compel us to sell this house and all the
  family treasures. We ought to have done it ourselves years ago, and retired
  to Hardborough as the Montagues did. Those Romneys and Reynolds and Raeburns
  would fetch a small fortune, to say nothing of the silver and the Empire
  furniture. And then we can go about with our heads in the air and boast about
  our ancestry with a feeling that we are not taking the bread out of the
  mouths of other people. We will take a little of the surplus and open a shop
  in Hardborough, and sell a few hundred bales of that knitting that you have
  been engaged upon for the last half-century. I am going to write to Mr.
  Warrener and ask him to come down to-morrow.'</p>

  <p>Aunt Gertrude blushed and looked a little uneasy. May laughed, though
  there were tears in her voice all the time she had been speaking.</p>

  <p>'Confess it,' she said. 'You have done something wrong. Naughty child!
  what have you been doing?'</p>

  <p>'It's Clifford Warrener,' Aunt Gertrude whispered. 'I&mdash;I have written
  to him myself, and he has promised me to come and see us on Saturday.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch9"
     id="ch9">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was a pregnant saying of May Castlerayne's that her
  father must have been born with the artistic temperament, he had so little
  knowledge of the value of money and so little heed for the future. Most
  geniuses have suffered from the same amenable weakness. But we have it on
  record that even so splendid a spendthrift as Oliver Goldsmith had his
  moments of carking anxiety, not lessened by the knowledge that his
  misfortunes were entirely of his own making.</p>

  <p>Rayne Castlerayne was much in this position. It was gradually coming home
  to him that there was only one way out of the <i>impasse</i>. He looked very
  old and haggard as he sat at his desk in the library turning over a number of
  papers. It had quite suddenly come home to him that not only had he no money,
  but that he had no means of raising money. There was a polite but firm note
  from his bankers refusing to honour any further cheques; here were numerous
  applications for payment of accounts; and here, also, was a letter from the
  family lawyer couched in the plainest and most unpleasant terms. Mr. Summers
  had not minced matters. He pointed out the fact that something would have to
  be done to meet certain pressing claims, or the annoyances would be serious
  indeed. Mr. Summers further intimated that he would come over after luncheon
  and discuss the situation with his client.</p>

  <p>Rayne Castlerayne was almost ready to admit that he had been to blame.
  When he had taken possession of the property five-and-twenty years ago the
  income of the estate had been a little over fifteen hundred pounds a year.
  Where had it all gone to? It was quite impossible for the head of the family
  to say. He had lost certain good opportunities of making the condition of
  things better. For instance, there were those five thousand odd acres of land
  between the sea and the Common. The land was grandly picturesque, the air
  bracing and rigorous, but the crop was mainly blackberries and bracken.
  Twenty years ago a big speculative firm had offered Mr. Castlerayne a fancy
  price for the land with an eye to the formation of an exclusive
  watering-place. The offer had been rejected with scorn. Castlerayne began to
  wish that he had not been quite so precipitate. Greater men than himself had
  taken such golden opportunities; he could call to mind a score of members of
  the peerage who sold a deal of their property to popular watering-places.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it would be possible to let The Towers and go abroad. He could not
  sell the house, for it formed the very last portion of the Castlerayne
  settled estates. The land beyond the Common was his to do with as he pleased,
  but nobody would buy it; the poor soil was good for nothing. And it would be
  difficult at this time of day to try to compete with prosperous Hardborough
  close by.</p>

  <p>Castlerayne's meditation was bitter enough, and his cigar lacked flavour
  as he faced these stern facts. He welcomed the advent of his solicitor with
  effusion. It seemed to relieve him of a part of his responsibility. And
  Summers was a clever fellow; he would be pretty sure to find some way out of
  the difficulty. It sounded vague, but the typical Micawber-like attitude was
  essentially a Castlerayne attribute. The family solicitor sat down and wiped
  his gold-rimmed glasses. With his erect figure, his keen eyes, and his
  well-trimmed gray moustache, he looked not unlike 'the county' himself.</p>

  <p>'Glad you've come, Summers,' Castlerayne said with a sigh. 'I've been
  going over those papers till my head aches. Have a cigar? I forgot you don't
  smoke till after dinner. What's all this about Foster? As far as I can judge,
  it seems to me that Foster has been behaving very badly.'</p>

  <p>'Foster naturally wants his money. He is in difficulties himself. Really,
  my friend, it isn't a nice thing for you to owe Foster fifty pounds. He is a
  very hard-working fellow, with a big family. He put you in the county court.
  You simply let the matter slide, and he issued what is called a judgment
  summons. So far as I can understand, you let that slide also. If you had not
  been Mr. Castlerayne of The Towers you would have found yourself in an
  awkward position&mdash;a very awkward position. A judgment debtor is expected
  to come before the judge periodically and be examined as to his ability to
  pay. If the judge is satisfied that the debtor is telling the truth, he makes
  an order for so much per month. You ignored the matter altogether, and you
  were ordered to pay the full amount within eight days. If the money is not
  paid by Friday you will go to jail.'</p>

  <p>The choice cigar dropped from Castlerayne's mouth and lay unheeded on the
  floor. The blood receded from his face, leaving it ghastly white. The
  statement was stupendous, incredible! It seemed impossible that such things
  should be permitted in a civilised country. And the day after to-morrow was
  Friday!</p>

  <p>'Is&mdash;is this true?' Castlerayne stammered. 'But it must be true. I
  never heard you joke, Summers. And my bank people refuse to cash any more
  cheques for me. I tell you, I haven't a five-pound note in the world. Anyway,
  I'll get you to pay this for me.'</p>

  <p>'No,' Summers said firmly, 'I think not. I'm not justified in doing it,
  Castlerayne. It's not fair to my family, with two boys at Cambridge. You will
  probably be surprised to hear that you owe me five hundred pounds one way and
  another, and that nearly half of it is money out of my pocket. That is why I
  came to see you to-day. I advised you very strongly not to fight Craggs's
  action, but you would not listen. To-day I accepted service of a writ from
  Craggs's solicitors for over eleven hundred pounds costs in the action. In a
  week's time they can levy execution.'</p>

  <p>Castlerayne wiped the damp from his forehead. He seemed to have aged
  strangely in the last hour or two since he had the courage to face his
  position. He picked up the fallen cigar, but he did not place it in his lips
  again. There was a queer pain in his left side, a twitching of the arm, that
  he had never felt before.</p>

  <p>'Will you put that quite plainly, please?' he whispered.</p>

  <p>'I thought I had. Craggs's solicitors can come here and take everything.
  They can sell your pictures and your plate and your old furniture to pay
  their claim. There is only one way by which you can prevent the
  inevitable.'</p>

  <p>'Go on, Summers. I begin to understand things more clearly. I seem to have
  been living in a kind of fool's paradise all these years. It is a kind of
  hideous dream. Only a day or two ago I was Castlerayne of The Towers; to-day
  I am a pauper. If I can't find this money by Friday I go to jail; if I don't
  pay Craggs's solicitors I lose my home. If there is any possible way out of
  the mess&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Well, there is no way out of the mess,' Summers went on coldly and
  judicially. 'The utmost you can do is to save yourself from unpleasant
  exhibition. Bankruptcy wipes out everything of that kind. If you put your
  petition in bankruptcy, Foster can't touch you. You will be spared the
  indignity of having the bailiffs and sheriffs officers in possession of The
  Towers. But everything will have to be sold for the benefit of the creditors.
  My dear old friend, I am exceedingly sorry, far more sorry than I can say;
  but there is absolutely no other way to save you.'</p>

  <p>So it was coming at last, the very thing that the head of the family had
  so absolutely refused to look squarely in the face. There had been no
  disgrace in the steady robbing of poor tradesmen, no contumely in those
  imposed bills; but bankruptcy was another matter altogether. It meant
  exposure, and awkward questions by a cold official who had no respect for the
  Castlerayne dignity. It meant the resignation of exclusive clubs, the loss of
  the Commission of the Peace. It was so sordid and vulgar.</p>

  <p>'Wait a moment,' Castlerayne groaned. 'My head has all gone queer. I can't
  think. It will be a terrible thing for my family, Summers.'</p>

  <p>'Of course it will. But, after all, it will be no more than people have
  been expecting for years. There is enough here to pay everybody, and perhaps
  leave a little over. There would not be the slightest trouble in letting The
  Towers for three hundred a year, and you could all live on that money. You
  might be worse off.'</p>

  <p>But Castlerayne refused to be comforted. He was fond of his home, and
  proud of it. He fully appreciated the artistic beauties of his pictures; the
  elegant simplicity of the old furniture was absolutely essential to him. And
  ruthless hands would deprive him of all this in a few days' time. He felt
  troubled and humiliated, ready to ask favours of those whom he had hitherto
  patronised.</p>

  <p>'I can't decide anything now,' he groaned. 'Really I can't, Summers. Give
  me a day to think it over. I don't want to be rude, but I should like to be
  alone for a time. I'll come and see you to-morrow afternoon.'</p>

  <p>Summers took the hint and departed. For a long time Castlerayne sat with
  his head on his hands, moved for once to the depths of his soul. Presently he
  could see the sun shining through the stained glass of the windows; he noted
  the light as it lingered on a Romney and caught the corner of a Louis XVI.
  commode. That Persian carpet had been on the floor for the best part of a
  century. How fresh the colours were!</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was possible to do something yet. Foster might be paid. No
  doubt Gertrude would not mind advancing the money for that purpose. It was
  hard upon Gertrude, who had found so much out of her slender portion lately;
  but still&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>Aunt Gertrude was in the still-room putting up some early damson-jam. Her
  slender figure was covered with a long white apron. The air was heavy with
  the rich aroma of fruit. Miss Castlerayne's face grew a little anxious as she
  noted her brother's expression. He paced up and down the room. He was showing
  none of his usual optimistic reticence now.</p>

  <p>'I'm going to see Craggs,' he said. 'In his heart, Craggs is by no means a
  bad fellow. That fellow Foster is quite different. Foster must be paid and
  his account closed. In no circumstances could I ever consent to deal with him
  again.'</p>

  <p>Castlerayne spoke quite firmly. There was no animosity in his
  voice&mdash;nothing but pleasing determination. Aunt Gertrude looked a little
  anxious.</p>

  <p>'That is all very well,' she said; 'but who is going to pay him?'</p>

  <p>'Well, it occurred to me that you would oblige. It is only a matter of
  fifty pounds. As a loving sister, you could not for a moment contemplate the
  alternative. Therefore, I shall look to you to see that this claim of
  Foster's is satisfied.'</p>

  <p>'I'm afraid that it is quite impossible,' Aunt Gertrude faltered. She had
  grown very pale; her lips were white and drawn. 'It is not that I will not do
  it, Rayne; it is simply because I can't. I haven't the money. I&mdash;I had
  one or two claims to settle. At the present moment I have certainly not more
  than five pounds to my credit at the bank. Oh Rayne, if you only knew how it
  hurts me to tell you this; if only&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'But there&mdash;there are other things. Part of your mother's jewellery,
  which I understood&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Oh Rayne, Rayne, they are gone too! What a wicked woman I am!'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was hard for Mr. Castlerayne to act just at that moment
  as the fine gentleman that he believed himself to be. He could not exactly
  reproach his sister, seeing that most of her slender fortune had gone to
  satisfy his own extravagance. But a little time ago he had entirely been
  under the impression that Gertrude had some hundreds of pounds at her
  disposal. It might have been that she had paid some of his more pressing
  debts, for the head of the family had never troubled himself about them.</p>

  <p>'There is no occasion to blame yourself, my dear,' he said magnanimously.
  'I have no doubt that you have acted for what seemed to be the best. I dare
  say we shall find some means to satisfy the rapacity of that fellow Foster.
  Meanwhile, I will go as far as the hospital and see Craggs. I have not the
  slightest doubt that his lawyers are acting on their own responsibility in
  this matter.'</p>

  <p>Castlerayne spoke lightly and pleasantly enough, but he was haunted by a
  certain wearying doubt as he crossed the Common. The violence of his sister's
  agitation had afforded him a clue. There had been no occasion for so marked a
  display of feeling. Castlerayne did not forget how great and tender an
  interest his sister took in the hospital, and how she had fought for the poor
  people there for the last twenty years. He put the doubt from him as
  unworthy. Gertrude would never have committed so base an act of
  treachery.</p>

  <p>The Common lay smiling in the still September sunshine. It was one of the
  golden days with a touch of autumn in the air. The seed-pods of the gorse
  crackled; the hum of the bees rose high in the air. For fifty years now
  Castlerayne had marked the changes of the year there; man and boy, it had
  become part of his existence. He began to realise what the loss of it all
  would be. There he had shot his first grouse; there he had found the hawk's
  nest. His mind travelled back over the level range of the years. And it was
  all going at last&mdash;he had frittered it all away. There was the glorious
  fringe of gorse and heath and heather beyond the Common, where by this time
  villas and streets of houses might have stood if he had not been so filled
  with his pride of race. A duke had done the same at Eastbourne, and nobody
  had thought any the worse of him. After all, it would have been no very great
  inconvenience to have a hotel erected on the site of the Dower-House. Perhaps
  there was reason in the action that Craggs had undertaken; at any rate, a
  graceful surrender would have obliterated the necessity for the disgraceful
  bankruptcy that Castlerayne saw before him.</p>

  <p>He came at length to the hospital, bathed in the brown light of the
  September afternoon. An elderly woman with some kind of lacework before her
  curtsied to him. A couple of shy children emerged from one of the dark
  doorways and touched their forelocks. There was something soothing about the
  process.</p>

  <p>Craggs roared a welcome as Castlerayne knocked at the door. The old man
  sat in his big arm-chair before a wisp of fire in the grate, for the
  rheumatism was hard upon him. He had a big book open on a little table by his
  side, and Castlerayne could see that it was a volume of Cobbett. The old man
  regarded his visitor with surprise.</p>

  <p>'Well, this is a nice mess you've got me into!' Castlerayne exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Craggs indicated a hardwood chair on the other side of the fireplace. He
  did not seem in the least impressed by the importance of the occasion. He
  wiped his iron-rimmed glasses on a flaming red handkerchief, and replaced
  them carefully. There was no sign of the victor about him.</p>

  <p>'I'm sorry to hear it, sir,' he said. 'I'm doing the best I can for
  everybody. I'm not by disposition a quarrelsome man; but when I have to
  fight, I'm like the Quaker in the story. You should never have gone and
  fought that action, I guess.'</p>

  <p>'It is easy to be wise after the event, Craggs. To do my solicitor
  justice, he strongly advised me to come to terms with you. I honestly
  believed myself to be entirely in the right, and so I refused to do anything
  of the kind. And now your solicitors are pressing me for an enormous bill
  that I can't possibly pay. If the money is not paid I shall be turned out of
  The Towers and everything will be sold. As you are so tenacious on the
  subject of your own house, perhaps you can judge of my feelings, Craggs.'</p>

  <p>Craggs nodded thoughtfully. He was not moved to any display of extravagant
  sympathy. From his hard, logical point of view, the squire had brought this
  thing on himself.</p>

  <p>'I could do nothing else,' he said. 'The Lord put it into my head as I was
  to be the guardian of these poor folks here. He led me to look up that old
  charter; and then I found out as the Common really belonged to the
  hospitallers, who could fit it to any purpose as they'd a mind so as to make
  a little money out of it. There was money provided by the will of your
  great-grandfather to endow the hospital for ever, and your grandfather took
  and spent every penny of it amongst his dissolute companions. And you never
  did a thing for us, squire; and you can't deny it. If it hadn't been for Miss
  Gertrude we should have all gone to the House long ago. That's why I took
  action under our rights conferred by the charter. When the money was found,
  no time was lost in making our position clear.'</p>

  <p>'But who found the money, Craggs? One of your Radical associates, I
  suppose&mdash;the set of people who are never happy unless they are setting
  class against class. Or perhaps you are in the hands of some speculative
  money-lender&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Nothing of the kind, sir,' Craggs cried indignantly. 'The money came from
  somebody who is very dear to us&mdash;a lady, in fact. But I am talking too
  fast, like the querulous old idiot that I am. After all, it's no business of
  yours, squire.'</p>

  <p>Castlerayne was ominously silent for a moment. His face had turned very
  pale; then it flushed very red till there was a mist before the eyes of the
  squire. He was likely to flare out there and then in a sudden fit of wild
  Berserk rage, the strong, hasty passion of the man who usually is of even
  temperament. He restrained an impulse to take Craggs by the throat and choke
  the life out of him.</p>

  <p>The fit passed presently, and left him trembling and breathless. Craggs,
  staring thoughtfully into the fire through the round glasses, saw nothing of
  this. He was convinced that the squire didn't suspect anything. He could not
  look into the black, raging heart of the other. It was some little time
  before Castlerayne spoke again.</p>

  <p>'We need not trouble about the past,' he said. 'It is the future that
  concerns me. I never thought that I should come here to ask you a favour,
  Craggs. I bear you no malice. You have fought me openly and honourably, and I
  am beaten. But from your solicitors' point of view it is a different matter.
  They look upon this as a mere money-making game. They are going to have their
  pound of flesh or force me into bankruptcy. I want you to tell them to give
  me a little time&mdash;say a month. If you will do this for
  me&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I'll do all I can, squire; though the matter you mention is out of my
  power. It's a dreadful thing for a gentleman in your position to find
  that&mdash;&mdash; But I'm getting presumptuous.'</p>

  <p>Craggs thoughtfully wiped his glasses again, and Castlerayne stared
  moodily into the fire. He was cherishing vengeful thoughts now. He was in a
  black and bitter mood which would considerably have astonished the old
  cobbler if he could have looked into the mind of his visitor.</p>

  <p>'I suppose that you will close with these hotel-people now?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'No, we sha'n't,' Craggs returned with something like a smile. 'There's a
  better scheme than that. It was useless to bring the scheme before you,
  because you would have been certain to oppose it. Lord, how short-sighted
  some people are, to be sure! And how the blessing in disguise is regarded as
  a black misfortune! You're down on your luck to-day; but the good time is
  coming, a far better time than you deserve, if you'll pardon me for saying
  so. I'll do what I can with the lawyers. I'm afraid, though, it isn't much
  good.'</p>

  <p>In his heart of hearts Castlerayne was of the same opinion. But he was not
  thinking of those learned in the law just at that moment. He had something
  sterner to distract his attention. His face was dark and stern as he made his
  way across the Common in the direction of The Towers. He had to deal with the
  black treachery, as he called it, existing under his own rafters. He no
  longer doubted where the money had come from to fight Craggs's action. Out of
  her sympathy for the hospital, Gertrude had found it. In a mean and
  despicable manner she had helped to ruin her own flesh and blood. If the
  means had not been forthcoming Craggs could never have been successful in his
  action; nay, he could never have brought an action at all. And the result had
  been to drag down an honourable name and cause an unfortunate man to go into
  a vulgar and sordid bankruptcy. Castlerayne was quite sure that he could have
  pulled round but for the treachery on the part of his sister.</p>

  <p>He swung through the heather, lashing the tips with his cane as he went
  along. He came at length to his own room, where the candles were burning on
  the dressing-table and his evening suit had been laid out by his man. He
  changed very slowly and carefully. Barely had he taken more pains over the
  setting of his black tie. Outwardly he was cool enough, but inwardly he was
  raging. He was hardly conscious of the fact that his lips were twitching
  strangely. There was a queer contortion of the left eyelid. The healthy brown
  of the face had given way to a positively gray tinge. But Castlerayne heeded
  it not.</p>

  <p>Down in the drawing-room the lamps were lighted. Nobody was there when the
  master of the house arrived. Everything looked so orderly, so refined, so
  fastidious; there lay no shadow of poverty there. The clock over the
  fireplace chimed the half-hour after seven; then the door opened and Gertrude
  Castlerayne, attired in some soft gray silk, came in.</p>

  <p>'As the evening was chilly, I thought that you would like a fire, Rayne,'
  she said. 'What is the matter? How gray and strange your face looks!'</p>

  <p>She started back, filled with some undefined fear; but Castlerayne came
  forward and took her by the shoulders. She had never seen her brother like
  this before. Her own face had gone as pale and chill as his. He seemed to
  have some difficulty in speaking.</p>

  <p>'I have seen Craggs,' he said between his teeth. 'He did not mean to
  betray you, but he has. And only this afternoon you told me that you had lost
  all your money. I know where all that money has gone. There is no need for
  you to prevaricate. So it is from my own household that the treacherous blow
  comes. After all these years! Men have done murder for less than this before
  now. But I shall say nothing. I shall leave it all to your conscience. I
  shall, I hope, not forget that so long as you are a guest
  here&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>A quick, broken cry rang through the room, half-drowned by the clang of
  the dinner-gong. With white face and startled eyes, Gertrude Castlerayne
  faced the speaker.</p>

  <p>'Rayne,' she wailed&mdash;'Rayne, you are cruel! Oh, so cold and cruel! A
  guest in the house! I! And after all these years, to think&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Will you take my arm?' Castlerayne said. 'I heard the gong. Do not let us
  forget that, after all, there are certain social obligations to observe. Will
  you, please?'</p>

  <p>Gertrude Castlerayne sank to her knees on the floor; her head had fallen
  into the seat of a chair. Her form was torn by passionate sobs that seemed to
  choke her. The door opened again, and May stood astonished and amazed by the
  extraordinary scene that lay before her.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was something very swift and dramatic about the whole
  business. Castlerayne's face was white like that of his sister, but the
  expression was not the same. His mouth was hard and cruel, his lips pressed
  together with a fine simulation of firmness; he had never been really firm in
  his life, though he looked it now. He stood there with his back to the
  fireplace, slim anger in immaculate black-and-white, with the fine carving of
  the overmantel for a background. It was no setting for the vulgar
  emotions&mdash;there could be nothing like violence.</p>

  <p>In front of him stood Aunt Gertrude, with her slim white hands
  outstretched tremblingly. A ray of light from one of the lamps shone on her
  face. For background she had the oak-panelled wall and a couple of sombre
  brown-and-yellow portraits by Reynolds. Her breath was coming fast between
  her parted lips.</p>

  <p>'What does all this mean?' May asked. 'What has Aunt Gertrude done?'</p>

  <p>'We will not discuss it,' the stern figure by the fireplace said. 'As I
  informed my sister just this moment, the dinner-gong has sounded.&mdash;One
  should never keep servants waiting, Gertrude. Let me give you my arm.'</p>

  <p>It sounded very terrible and very grand, no doubt. It was the dignified
  conduct of monarchs and statesmen in the hour of stress, the kind of thing
  one reads in the Grandisonian class of novel. May bit her lips quite in the
  modern way.</p>

  <p>'There will be plenty of time to explain afterwards,' Castlerayne
  said.</p>

  <p>Aunt Gertrude came out of her waking dream. The mere suggestion of food
  filled her with loathing, yet she took the proffered arm and clung to it.</p>

  <p>In his secret heart Mr. Castlerayne was greatly pleased with himself. He
  was about to vindicate the outraged honour of the family without saying
  anything calculated to lower the dignity of his position. He chatted affably
  to May; he smiled benignly on his elder daughter. His face grew sterner when
  the dessert reached the table and the servants had gone. There was a
  fluttering turn of heads in his direction.</p>

  <p>'I see you are expecting me to speak,' he said.</p>

  <p>His voice was quite smooth; the lamplight gave dignity to his face. Also,
  the lamplight fell in glaring shafts of light on the artistic confusion of
  fruit&mdash;purple grapes and ruddy peaches&mdash;old silver and glass, ruby
  wines, and the flashing cut-glass decanters. Approving ancestors lined the
  walls&mdash;there could not have been more appropriate setting for the
  dignity of the speaker. 'After all, it is entirely a matter between
  your&mdash;my sister and myself. She has chosen to take certain steps which I
  entirely disagree with. I will not blame her; no doubt she has acted
  according to her lights. It was not the line of conduct I expected. Still, so
  long as she remains a guest under my roof&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>A moan of pain came from Aunt Gertrude. She sat there with folded hands,
  meek and quiet as a child.</p>

  <p>May rose and kissed her. May understood.</p>

  <p>'What is the meaning of all this nonsense?' she demanded.</p>

  <p>It was the banal note frequently so destructive of the higher flights of
  dialectics.</p>

  <p>'You had better ask your aunt,' Castlerayne retorted somewhat feebly.
  'During the short time that she is likely to remain under my
  roof&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Are any of us likely to remain here long? I am sorry to be rude, father;
  but this is&mdash;is disgraceful. Oh, I know exactly what you are alluding
  to. But for Aunt Gertrude, old Craggs could not have fought that action of
  his. She lent him the money. In similar circumstances I should have done the
  same thing.'</p>

  <p>'You would have done&mdash;the same&mdash;thing?' Castlerayne faltered.
  'My child!'</p>

  <p>'Indeed I would. There would have been no action had you listened to Mr.
  Summers. He told you that Craggs was merely fighting for the rights of the
  hospitallers, for their very existence. There are people yonder who have
  worked for us all their lives. It has been an understood thing that we
  provided for their old age, and now we leave them to go to the workhouse. Oh,
  the shame of it! the disgrace of it! And because Aunt Gertrude has stripped
  herself to preserve the good name of the family&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'What has she done?' Angela pleaded. 'Oh, what <i>has</i> she done?'</p>

  <p>'What has she done?' May echoed scornfully. 'Oh, nothing. She has given up
  her whole life to our father and ourselves. For our sakes she has remained
  single; she resigned the man who loved her because the family dignity called
  for the sacrifice.&mdash;Aunt Gertrude, I must, I <i>will</i> speak.'</p>

  <p>'It were better I had died years ago,' Miss Castlerayne sobbed.</p>

  <p>'It would have been a very sad day for us,' May went on. 'We never went to
  school for the simple reason that there was no money to send us; and yet we
  are quite well-educated girls because Aunt Gertrude taught us all she knew.
  No mother could have been more kind and tender, more thoughtful for our
  happiness.'</p>

  <p>'It is all the more inexplicable,' Castlerayne remonstrated, 'that she
  should ruin us now.'</p>

  <p>A bitter laugh rose to May's lips, but she crushed it down,</p>

  <p>'Has she ruined us?' she asked. 'I may be dense, but it seems to me to be
  quite the other way about. I understand that when Aunt Gertrude came to us
  she had nearly five thousand pounds of her own. That was the provision for
  her old age, the least that a gentlewoman could live on. Where has all that
  money gone? It has gone to pay our shameless debts; it has passed into the
  pockets of poor people who trusted to the word of a Castlerayne for payment.
  Little by little that money has vanished. A good deal of it has gone to
  cigars and vintage&mdash;clarets, I should say.'</p>

  <p>The head of the house winced perceptibly. He murmured something as to the
  modern daughter and her ways. But the Grandisonian manner was no longer
  there. Then, to the surprise of everybody, Aunt Gertrude rose. She was
  trembling from head to foot, her face was very pale, yet her voice was firm
  and sweet.</p>

  <p>'Hush, May,' she said; 'you are forgetting yourself. It is so good of you
  to take my part; but you are going too far. I have done wrong in your
  father's eyes; he has asked me to look for a home elsewhere. I have found it.
  For some time past I have looked for something of the kind. It was wrong of
  me&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'It was absolutely impossible of you,' Castlerayne said indignantly.</p>

  <p>'Perhaps so, Rayne. Still, I looked upon the welfare of the hospital as a
  sacred duty. I knew what was going to happen. That hotel suggestion was a
  hateful one; but, nevertheless, I welcomed it because I saw in the scheme a
  way to save our poor people. So long as you, as lord of the manor, had the
  final word, the scheme was hopeless. But Craggs put a different complexion on
  it altogether. He proved to me that the Common belonged to the hospital. He
  could do nothing without money. I lent him the money. I would do it again
  to-morrow. I am not in the least ashamed of my action. From your point of
  view, Rayne, I have struck a blow at the family honour. You have told me
  quite politely that I am no longer a member of your household; you are good
  enough to regard me as your guest until I can find a home elsewhere. That
  home is found. I shall not trouble you with my presence after to-morrow.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, this is out of the question!' Angela cried. 'What does it matter what
  Aunt Gertrude has said and done? She is still Aunt Gertrude to us. The Towers
  would not be the same place without her. If she stays here&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'She has ruined us,' Castlerayne protested; 'and she has done it
  deliberately.'</p>

  <p>'We were ruined in any case,' May protested. 'My dear
  father&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'The discussion is getting painful,' Castlerayne said with much dignity.
  'There is nothing to be gained by continuing it. I hold very strong views in
  the matter. As a man of determination, I could not possibly regard your
  aunt's conduct as&mdash;as&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>The speaker paused and indicated the door with a fine gesture. It was a
  signal that the conference was at an end. Hot words trembled on May's lips,
  but she restrained them. It was an outrage and violation of all the sacred
  laws of consanguinity. Aunt Gertrude's transient dignity had vanished; she
  was crying softly now. She passed in the direction of the drawing-room,
  trembling and marvelling at her own temerity. She did not look in the least
  like a martyr; but nevertheless she was the stuff that martyrs are made of.
  She was sorry; she was hurt and grieved; but she had no regret for her
  action. She sat in a big arm-chair and suffered the girls to make much of
  her.</p>

  <p>'You are not going away,' Angela said vehemently. 'We will detain you by
  force if necessary. What should we do without you, auntie? All the same, I'm
  sorry you helped that dogmatic old Craggs to get the best of us.'</p>

  <p>'I had to,' Aunt Gertrude sobbed. 'My duty lay plain before me. I could
  not die happy knowing that my dear hospitallers were in need. They are
  provided for now that the hotel scheme is accomplished.'</p>

  <p>'It isn't accomplished, and it never will be accomplished,' May declared.
  'No hotel is going to defile the serenity of our own dear old common. All the
  same, your great sacrifice has not been in vain, auntie. The result will be
  exactly the same thing, and the sun of prosperity is going to shine on us
  again.'</p>

  <p>'More of May's enigmas,' Angela laughed. 'And when I ask her to say what
  she means she tells me to wait and be patient. As if anybody could be patient
  at such a time as this! Auntie, do you know what this wonderful secret
  is?'</p>

  <p>'Indeed I don't, dear,' Miss Castlerayne said, wiping her eyes on some
  faded yellow square of lace miscalled a handkerchief. 'May is too clever for
  me. All I know is that the fate of the hospital is saved, and we can ask Mr.
  Warrener to help us with every confidence that he will not lose his
  money.'</p>

  <p>'Mr Warrener!' Angela exclaimed. A spot of crimson tinged her cheeks. 'I
  should like to know what Mr. Warrener has to do with it.'</p>

  <p>'You will know all in good time,' May laughed. 'Strange that our lives
  should be so bound up in the emollient!&mdash;Auntie, you were going to say
  something.'</p>

  <p>'I was alluding to the hospital,' Aunt Gertrude resumed. 'There will be
  money for each of the houses there now, enough to keep the poor people
  decently and in order. Unless your father changes his mind I could not remain
  here. Don't interrupt me, or I shall break down again. The handkerchief
  belonged to my grandmother. It is old Brussels. One of the houses in the
  hospital is vacant; it is furnished, as you know. With a cottage like that
  and a few shillings a week it would be possible to live. Fortunately, my
  needs are simple. I can quite understand my brother's feelings; I can quite
  sympathise with his point of view. I have sinned beyond redemption, and he
  could not tolerate me any longer. Therefore, as I am a poor member of the
  clan, for the time being I am going to become a hospitaller. I take up my
  abode there to-morrow. It is no use protesting, my dears; my mind is made up.
  And I shall have the company of Craggs to fall back on. I am really fond of
  Craggs.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MR. CASTLERAYNE was having an exceedingly bad quarter of an
  hour at the hands of his younger daughter. She was full of questions; she
  bubbled with pointed interrogation. Was her father going to sit down and see
  this disgraceful thing accomplished? Was he aware of the fact that,
  practically speaking, he owed Aunt Gertrude five thousand pounds? Did he know
  that he had robbed his sister of her fortune bit by bit?</p>

  <p>To May's intense surprise, she had found Aunt Gertrude quite fixed on her
  intention. She had been gentle and smiling, blushing and tearful, by turn;
  but she was perfectly firm. May had hoped for better things on a night's
  reflection, but morning brought no change. Aunt Gertrude had been up betimes;
  she had been as far as the hospital, and Craggs had arranged for a local
  man-of-all-work to call later in the day for Miss Castlerayne's <i>lares</i>
  and <i>penates</i>. It is just possible that Rayne Castlerayne regretted his
  behaviour of the previous evening. But the head of the family had given his
  word; he could not go back now.</p>

  <p>'We were ever a headstrong race,' he said grandly&mdash;'headstrong and
  impulsive.'</p>

  <p>'I should scarcely call Aunt Gertrude headstrong,' May said dryly. 'You
  have only to go to her and offer her an ample apology for&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Apology? My dear May, the magnanimity of my conduct&mdash;&mdash; But,
  really, it might be a great deal worse. It is not as bad as a girl of
  position marrying beneath her station. If Gertrude chooses to quarrel with
  me, why&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>May abandoned the contest as hopeless. She was a little sorry for her
  father, too. He had a worried expression, and a heap of papers before him. He
  was making some sort of effort to grapple with his position. And perhaps Aunt
  Gertrude had not so very much to regret. It might only be a matter of hours
  now before the old home was in the possession of strangers. When the crash
  came the episode of Aunt Gertrude and the hospital would only be a minor one
  in the clang of the great catastrophe.</p>

  <p>'I am not in the least an object of pity,' Aunt Gertrude said cheerfully.
  'I shall be very comfortable in my rooms yonder. The sitting-room is
  charming; the view is far better than the one from here. I have all the
  furniture I need, and flowers for the getting. All I require is a certain
  amount of time, with some table cutlery and glass and silver. And there are
  three bedrooms, in case you and Angela need one each.'</p>

  <p>'I am afraid that people will talk,' May ventured to suggest.</p>

  <p>But Aunt Gertrude cared nothing for that. People were certain to talk in
  any case. Her cheerfulness was a pretty thing, but obviously exaggerated. For
  over fifty years The Towers had been her home, for the most part a sad and
  miserable house; but then it is one of the rare blessings of Time that he
  softens all the pain and brings out all the pleasures when one looks back
  from the autumn of life.</p>

  <p>It was nearly four o'clock before the exodus was made, and the homely,
  tender figure crossed the Common in the direction of the hospital. The head
  of the household had gone over to Hardborough to consult his solicitor. He
  was more disturbed and dismayed over the business than he would have cared to
  confess. He had said on the spur of the moment that which had struck him as
  quite the proper thing to say; he had not expected for a moment that his
  sister would take him at his word. He had anticipated tears and a plea for
  forgiveness; he had even prepared to be exceedingly magnanimous. It had never
  occurred to him how deeply the knife had cut, how cruelly his speech had
  wounded. And May's plain words had rankled in his heart as he drove along. He
  had not slept either, and his usually robust appetite had left him. He
  wondered, too, what brought about these fits of giddiness, and why his lips
  twitched in that singular manner.</p>

  <p>His head cleared again, and his nerve came back to him. Of course, all
  that talk about Gertrude and the hospital was all so much feminine hysteria;
  Gertrude would be seated at the bottom of the dinner-table as usual. These
  things would wear off. The head of the household would not have been quite so
  easy in his mind if he had seen the little caravansera crossing the Common at
  that same moment.</p>

  <p>It was not Craggs who came to meet the procession and give his aid in
  getting that little pile of household goods into the cottage. On the
  contrary, a tall figure in gray Harris tweed stood on the threshold. May's
  heart gave a little leap of delight as she recognised the figure in the
  September sunshine.</p>

  <p>'Mr Warrener!' she cried. 'I was wondering what had become of him. I began
  to think that he was going to play me false.'</p>

  <p>Clifford Warrener advanced smilingly. He was obviously pleased to see the
  flush that mantled to Angela's face as he shook hands.</p>

  <p>'I have been exceedingly busy lately,' he said. 'I slept in Hardborough
  last night, and came home to-day to see Craggs. The hero of the fight had to
  go to Hardborough himself this afternoon, so I did not gather much news,
  except the startling information that Miss Castlerayne was taking up her
  abode here for the present. Don't think that I mean to be inquisitive if I
  make a guess at the reason.'</p>

  <p>'The reason is quite simple,' Aunt Gertrude said. 'My brother found out
  all about Craggs and that money. Naturally, he was exceedingly angry. I dare
  say I should have taken exactly the same view if I had been in his
  place.'</p>

  <p>Warrener discreetly turned the conversation; it would have been bad taste
  to pursue it further. But he could not altogether keep the contempt from his
  face. He professed his readiness to help with the pile of luggage standing on
  the smooth turf in front of the hospital.</p>

  <p>'I am looking for some outlet for my energies,' he declared. 'Let me act
  as porter for you. There is something in the air of the place that is a
  certain cure for idleness. I have brought my golf-clubs with me for a few
  practice-shots, and I am accompanied by a mighty player who is also a great
  authority on the game. He can do for a new golf-links what Clement Scott did
  for Cromer; to go higher up the scale, what Wordsworth and Coleridge did for
  the Lake District.'</p>

  <p>Warrener's eyes twinkled strangely as he spoke, and May laughed as if she
  understood and saw something subtle in the plain statement of facts.</p>

  <p>'What is the name of your friend?' she asked. 'I fancied I saw somebody
  with a bag of clubs on the far side of the Pulpit Rocks.'</p>

  <p>'That was Raymond Brooke right enough,' Warrener replied. 'I left him in a
  state of fascination by the Pulpit. We are staying at Watson's farm for a few
  days. But let me help in getting this stuff into the cottage.'</p>

  <p>It was all done at length, to Aunt Gertrude's satisfaction. Nothing seemed
  to have been forgotten. They all sat down to tea, served on an oak
  gate-legged table of Cromwell's time. Any connoisseur would have raved over
  the chairs and the settle and the dresser. With tears in her voice and moist
  eyes, Aunt Gertrude declared that she was delighted with her new abode. They
  walked out presently across the Common to find the indefatigable Brooke. He
  came up presently with a look of interest, dragging his bag of clubs behind
  him.</p>

  <p>'Never saw anything like it,' he said. 'And I'm not easily pleased, as you
  know. How it came about that a spot like this, made for the game, has never
  been&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Try and restrain yourself,' Warrener laughed. 'Manfully refrain from
  using a language that the ladies do not understand.&mdash;Let me introduce my
  friend Brooke to you.'</p>

  <p>They paired off presently, Warrener a little in front with Angela. The
  heather was crisp to their feet; the glorious breeze from the sea was in
  their faces. The sun, slanting across the Common, filled it with a golden
  glow. The distant hills were veiled in a blue haze.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Warrener, I want to ask you a question,' Angela said suddenly. 'May
  says that you have come here with some plan; in short, that there is a
  possibility of averting the ruin that hangs over our house. Our troubles are
  not strange to you; therefore I can speak all the more freely. I have not
  forgotten that morning in the rose-garden three months ago. Is it possible
  that there is any way of saving us?'</p>

  <p>'I think I can promise that,' Warrener said slowly and thoughtfully. 'In
  fact, I am down here for that very purpose. With a less elaborate and
  stiff-necked man than your father I could have spoken freely at first of my
  scheme. He would not have listened to it. He did not sufficiently realise his
  position. That is why it was necessary to permit things to take their natural
  course. Had it not been for your aunt I should never have succeeded at all.
  You don't recognise what a heroine she is: Jeanne d'Arc was no greater. No
  wonder my father loved that woman.'</p>

  <p>'It seems sad,' Angela murmured. 'I&mdash;I have learnt a great many
  things lately. It is very foolish of us to despise other people because they
  are not Castleraynes. It is a dreadful thing to be living on other people as
  if you were conferring a favour upon them. And now, what is going to become
  of us?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, you will find that there is no occasion to worry,' Warrener said. 'My
  scheme is going to save all that, and Aunt Gertrude is the heroine of the
  story. I am going to try to see your father some time to-morrow. I fancy that
  the time has come when he may be persuaded to listen to me.'</p>

  <p>'It has something to do with the Common?' Angela asked eagerly. 'You could
  do nothing so long as the Common was apparently in the hands of the lord of
  the manor?'</p>

  <p>'You have guessed it so far,' Warrener said grimly. 'It has everything to
  do with the Common. And it has nothing whatever to do with a hotel. You may
  imagine that the Common has passed from under your father's sway, and that is
  true. The next best thing to the rose is being near the rose, and the next
  best thing to the Common is all that glorious bit with the lovely views about
  it. But I see that you are as much in the dark as ever, and I prefer to keep
  you in suspense for a little longer. It is pleasant to see you smiling in
  that way; it is a sign that you have forgiven me.'</p>

  <p>Angela's face was flushed; there was a tender light in her eyes; her mouth
  was soft and drooping. Warrener had never seen her look like that before; but
  in his mind he had always pictured her with an expression like that. He could
  see that the ice was melting from her heart, that the pride of race was
  passing away.</p>

  <p>'Let me ask you a question,' he said. 'It is a fine thing to be a
  Castlerayne of The Towers; but has it been a happy life that you have passed
  there?'</p>

  <p>'No,' Angela said boldly and candidly, 'it hasn't Mr. Warrener, I am
  ashamed of myself. I should like to have my time over again. There are
  happier lives&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Indeed there are, Angela. Mine, for instance. And some of these days, if
  I could only persuade you to share it with me, why&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Angela's face flushed again, but her lips quivered in a smile.</p>

  <p>'You have not given me your confidence, so I shall refuse you mine,' she
  said, though there was no sting in her voice. 'I am going back to pet Aunt
  Gertrude. I feel as if I could not make enough of her to-day.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">HEEDLESS of these drastic changes, the lord of the manor was
  spending a very unpleasant afternoon at the office of his solicitor. By this
  time Castlerayne had almost forgotten the shortcomings of his sister. He had
  asserted his authority the night before, and he was pleasantly flattered by
  the impression he had made. He had not really expected Miss Castlerayne to
  take him precisely at his word; indeed, he had a vague idea that the whole
  scene was the result of some novel he had read years ago and forgotten. He
  was rather pleased with the clever way in which he had informed his sister
  that she could no longer consider herself one of his household.</p>

  <p>There would be something nice in acting with magnanimity later on. That
  the victim would take it <i>au pied de la lettre</i> Castlerayne had not
  expected. He was disposed to regard Gertrude's action as one of his
  misfortunes&mdash;misfortunes which he hoped to meet with great dignity. That
  his cruelty and unkindness had cut like a knife he did not for one moment
  realise.</p>

  <p>All this was forgotten presently. Mr. Summers had no good news to offer;
  he took the gloomiest view of the situation. He had seen the solicitors who
  acted for Samuel Craggs in the matter of the action, and they were
  obdurate.</p>

  <p>'Between ourselves,' he said, 'they are not a very high-class firm.
  Neither is their practice a large one. They will only be too glad to get hold
  of the eleven hundred odd pounds you owe them.'</p>

  <p>'They can't do anything for a few weeks, I suppose?' Castlerayne
  asked.</p>

  <p>'Oh yes, they can,' Summers said irritably. 'Strange that I cannot make
  you see things in their proper light There was no stay of execution, as we
  call it; the costs had been taxed, and those people are in a position to come
  over to The Towers at any moment. To be perfectly frank with you, they are
  afraid of your other creditors. If they strike now they may get everything;
  if they wait there is a chance of having to share with the rest. If they do
  go to extreme limits there is only one thing for you to do.'</p>

  <p>'And what is that?' Castlerayne asked. The strange shakiness had come over
  him again, the same twitching of the muscles. He had been hoping against
  hope, in his infatuated way&mdash;the feeling that Summers would be able to
  do something. 'What do you want me to do? I am sure that anything in
  reason&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Bankruptcy,' Summers said curtly. 'If you go into bankruptcy you will be
  spared the indignity of seeing the sheriffs officer in possession of The
  Towers. Then everything will go through the hands of the court. Otherwise,
  Craggs's lawyers will take possession of your effects, and sell them for what
  they will fetch. They won't care how things are sacrificed so long as they
  realise enough to meet their own claims. In fairness to the great body of
  your creditors, your duty is to take this course.'</p>

  <p>The dry professional jargon was sinking like lead into Castlerayne's soul.
  For the first time he fully realised the desperate nature of his position.
  Still, with the obstinate weakness of his nature, he argued. Was there no
  other way? Could not Summers do something in the way of a
  mortgage&mdash;anything to get rid of those fellows? The idea of bankruptcy
  was horrible, repulsive. Was there not such a thing as a public examination
  in bankruptcy? Would he not have to stand in open court and reply to insolent
  questions from irate creditors? All these punctilious questions Summers
  replied to in a cold affirmative.</p>

  <p>'Oh, it is not pleasant,' the old lawyer said grimly. 'Nor is there any
  great consolation in the knowledge that you have brought it all on yourself.
  At the same time, it may be quite an honourable bankruptcy. If your family
  treasures are properly disposed of&mdash;the pictures sold at Christie's, and
  so on&mdash;I fully believe that there will be sufficient to pay everybody
  and leave you a small surplus. The Towers would let for three hundred pounds,
  and you could live on that. But you are your own master.'</p>

  <p>Summers shrugged his shoulders as if declining further responsibility. The
  papers on his desk swam before Castlerayne's eyes; he was conscious of a
  queer numbness in his left side. The sensation passed, but left him trembling
  from head to foot.</p>

  <p>'I'll think it over,' he whispered. 'I'll let you know to-morrow. Don't
  force me to-day. I'm not in a fit state to decide. I'm going as far as the
  club. I feel that I need something to pull me together. I've never done such
  a thing before, Summers. I have always despised people who touch spirits,
  especially in the daytime.'</p>

  <p>Castlerayne lounged away to the club. He stopped once or twice in the
  road; he was not quite certain which way to go. He had never had lapses of
  memory like this before. One or two people spoke to him as they passed, but
  he did not heed. In the club he sat and wondered why the waiter stared at him
  in that strange way. He could not see the ghastly gray pallor of his own
  face. Presently he was sipping brandy and soda-water; the strong and
  unaccustomed cordial filled him with a glow, a new strength. He felt utterly
  tired and worn out a moment later. When he came to himself again he saw that
  it was long past six, and the smoking-room was deserted.</p>

  <p>He was home again presently, walking up to the porch. He had not the least
  idea how he had reached there, though he was absolutely free from the touch
  of insobriety. There was a lapse of memory, a perfect hiatus, the last hour.
  He dressed presently and went down to the drawing-room. By this time the
  queer inertia of brain had gone, and he was his quiet, dignified self again.
  It seemed impossible to believe that anybody could interfere with him here.
  He was pleasant and affable to Angela and May, who sat in the drawing-room
  waiting for the gong to ring. Castlerayne had a vague sense of something
  missing. Presently he realised what it was: the quiet, placid figure in the
  gray silk who had occupied the big arm-chair by the fireplace all these
  years. And Gertrude was the soul of punctuality.</p>

  <p>'Why is your aunt so late, girls?' he asked.</p>

  <p>Angela looked up without reply. As usual, it was May who explained.</p>

  <p>'Aunt Gertrude has gone,' she said. 'Surely you have not forgotten what
  you said to her last night&mdash;so long as she remained a guest under your
  roof?'</p>

  <p>'Gone? Gone where? She has no money. Do&mdash;do you suppose that I meant
  it? I was deeply distressed by your aunt's conduct. Indirectly she has
  brought about the downfall of the House. I am not questioning her motives,
  her integrity. After my discovery of yesterday I had no alternative but to
  say what I did. But that she would take me at my word like this! Where has
  she gone?'</p>

  <p>'She has gone to the hospital,' May explained. 'One of the cottages there
  was empty. We have been helping her to move all the afternoon. Mr. Warrener
  came and assisted. Aunt seemed very happy when we left her.'</p>

  <p>'And you fell in with this idea&mdash;you did not make the slightest
  attempt to&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Indeed we did, father. We had no idea that Aunt Gertrude could be so
  terribly obstinate. She fairly bore us down by her gentle determination. And
  she has gone.'</p>

  <p>Castlerayne opened his mouth to speak with majestic wrath. But the
  sonorous words refused to come at his bidding; he could only mumble instead.
  His eyes were filled with tears. It was strange how his tongue refused to
  speak. It was only when he controlled himself with great effort that he found
  words at all.</p>

  <p>'A further humiliation,' he said. 'Something for the servants to talk
  about. Angela, will you take my arm? We must not forget what we owe to our
  position. We will discuss the matter more fully presently. Directly I become
  excited my head is all queer. What a dreadfully poor light the lamps give
  to-night!'</p>

  <p>The two girls exchanged glances. A terrible fear was thrilling at May's
  heart. She saw how gray and twisted her father's face had become. He was a
  little more like himself presently; he prattled on commonplaces in a way that
  jarred on May's nerves. It was only after the servants had gone that the
  effort faded and left an old, gray man behind.</p>

  <p>'Tell us what you did in Hardborough to-day,' May said.</p>

  <p>'What I did in Hardborough to-day?' Castlerayne echoed. 'I have not been
  in to Hardborough to-day. Oh yes, of course, I went to see Summers. My dear
  girls, that man grows harder and less sympathetic as he gets older. He would
  not listen to a word that I had to say. He had only one cry, and that was
  bankruptcy.'</p>

  <p>'And what would be the result of that?' May asked.</p>

  <p>'Well, Summers seems to think that everybody would be paid in full. If I
  sit quietly down, Craggs's solicitors will sell everything at any price so
  long as they are paid. I find that they are in a position to do this at any
  moment. Not that we need fear&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Stop!' May cried. Her face had grown suddenly pale. 'I implore you not to
  prevaricate at this moment. Remember what happened in the case of the
  Montagues. Without the slightest warning strangers entered the house, and
  they had to go. They had to leave everything behind, even the flowers in the
  vases in the drawing-room. I saw that after they had left; it was one of the
  most pathetic sights I have ever seen. Father, is that likely to be our own
  fate to-morrow&mdash;nay, to-night?'</p>

  <p>'Of course I could prevent it by going into bankruptcy,' Castlerayne said
  hastily. He had answered May's question despite himself. He could see the
  girl shudder and shrink. 'That is what Summers advised me to do without
  delay. In that case everything would be sold in a proper way, and he
  estimated that the creditors would be paid in full. There might even be a
  small surplus to come to us. But everything would have to go.'</p>

  <p>Angela glanced round the room at the old oak furniture, the old silver and
  china, the almost priceless pictures and portraits on the walls. Her
  slippered foot pressed into the pile of a Persian carpet with the weight of
  centuries upon it. The girl loved all these things; she would find it hard to
  part with them. May's views were not quite the same. She was getting to hate
  these things. The upkeep of an artistic house was calculated to destroy the
  nerve-centres and take all the temper out of life.</p>

  <p>'You must do it,' she said. 'There must be no delay. To be out of debt, to
  be free to look everybody in the face, to think that we had not deprived a
  soul of a farthing! Oh! I can only partly imagine the feeling. Father, you
  will do it?'</p>

  <p>'Really, I think so,' Mr Castlerayne murmured. 'I fancy so. But a step
  like that is not to be taken in a hurry. Nothing can be gained by undue
  haste, which, as the poets say, is half-sister to delay. I am going to give
  this matter my deep consideration. If you think that I am
  incapable&mdash;&mdash; Well, what is it?'</p>

  <p>The butler stood in the doorway waiting for his chance to speak.</p>

  <p>'A stranger&mdash;a&mdash;a gentleman to see you, sir,' he said. 'He says
  that it is absolutely necessary that he should see you at once, sir.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">RAYNE CASTLERAYNE rose with dignity. He could not quite
  understand why anybody should venture to disturb him at this time of night.
  No gentleman would intrude in the dinner-hour. The visitor had been asked
  into the library, of course. It was the two girls who looked so frightened.
  By the instinct of their sex they had guessed what was taking place. May
  shuddered; she put down the section of a peach that she was peeling, and the
  sight of the cool, luscious fruit filled her with loathing.</p>

  <p>'It has come,' she whispered. 'I feel quite certain of it. Why did not
  dad&mdash;&mdash; But why do I ask so silly a question? As if he would ever
  do the proper thing without being forced to it. If he had followed Mr.
  Summers's advice we should have been spared this crowning indignity. It is
  bad enough to have all these creditors, and now&mdash;&mdash; I shall never
  forget that afternoon at the Montagues'. And though they are living now in a
  small house in Hardborough, they are quite happy.'</p>

  <p>'It may not be quite what you think it is,' Angela said.</p>

  <p>'You <i>know</i> that it is; you are as certain as I am. Oh, the shame,
  the vulgarity of it! They leave dreadful creatures behind who smoke pipes and
  drink beer. Ada Montague told me all about it. Oh, if I could only do
  something!'</p>

  <p>May paced restlessly up and down the room. She longed for some outlet for
  her fierce energy. It seemed almost impossible to believe that in this quiet
  refinement, this cameo amongst homes, the grip of reality had clutched like
  this. A grip with grimy fingers, too, and nails in mourning!</p>

  <p>Mr. Castlerayne crossed with leisurely step to the library. A little, fat
  man, with a hot, greasy face and impudent eyes of shallow blue, sat there
  whistling softly. A hard bowler hat lay on the table on top of some white
  foolscap papers. Castlerayne would have frozen his visitor at a glance; but
  the imperturbable stranger merely rose and bade his involuntary host a
  cheerful, not to say impudent, good-evening.</p>

  <p>'Sorry to trouble you, Mr. Castlerayne,' he said; 'but I couldn't get here
  before. And, after all, these things are done better in the dark. It's that
  little matter of Craggs and yourself, suit of plaintiffs solicitors&mdash;one
  thousand two hundred and seventy-one pounds four shillings and nine-pence
  costs in the action. From the office of the sheriff, you know. Of course, if
  you can pay me the money, sir, I give you a receipt, and there is an end of
  it.'</p>

  <p>'And if not?' Castlerayne asked. 'If it is not convenient to pay you a
  cheque?'</p>

  <p>'Couldn't take a cheque, my dear sir; cash or notes. If you don't pay I
  shall have to leave my man in possession. It is a mere formality, of course;
  but the man will have to stay till the claim is satisfied or you put your
  petition in bankruptcy.'</p>

  <p>'I have no means of paying you at present,' Castlerayne said hoarsely.</p>

  <p>'Right you are,' came the cheerful response. 'In that case I'll call Bob.
  He's in the hall. If I hurry up I shall catch the ten train back to
  Hardborough.&mdash;Here, Bob; come this way.&mdash;You'll find Bob quite
  harmless, Mr. Castlerayne.' The little man vanished without further
  ceremony.</p>

  <p>A tall, melancholy individual, with sombre eyes, lounged awkwardly into
  the library. He resembled nothing so much as one of Leech's sketches of the
  mute who used to follow old-fashioned funerals. His mouldy black suit was
  several sizes too large for him; he had not washed within recent memory.</p>

  <p>'Good-evening to you, sir,' he said huskily. 'Name of Bob, sir. It is
  unfortunate as you have got to put up with my company for a day or two. Not
  that I shall trouble anybody. Give me a bed or a sofa, and my three meals a
  day, with beer, and I'm willing to make myself agreeable. Which mine is a
  hard life at the best of times.'</p>

  <p>Castlerayne nodded his head slowly; he could not have spoken just then for
  a kingdom. He felt as if all the world were slipping from him. He was only
  conscious of the damp, mouldy smell of the intruder's black garments, of the
  odour of the thick boots. That lank, dark figure seemed to fill the entire
  atmosphere.</p>

  <p>'Where am I going to sleep to-night, sir?' the figure asked.</p>

  <p>Castlerayne roused himself with an effort. He picked his scattered senses
  up one by one. Something had to be done with this dreadful incubus. He would
  have to be lodged and fed. And the servants would have to know; it was
  impossible to keep this from the servants. Castlerayne rang the bell and
  explained to the butler&mdash;at heart he had an idea that he had explained.
  He dragged himself into the drawing-room, pulling one leg after the other.
  There was a ghastly smirk on his face; his lips were blue. Angela positively
  recoiled from him.</p>

  <p>'What is it?' she stammered. 'What has happened, father? I heard a voice
  say&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Yes, yes,' Castlerayne said thickly; 'it is the man in possession. He
  says that he is not likely to cause us any trouble, so I have handed him over
  to the servants. It seems very strange to think that here, in the old home of
  the family&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>The speaker paused and threw back his head. A peal of loud laughter came
  from his lips. The discreet silence of the house rang with it. The thing was
  so unnatural, so strident, so terrible, that May held her hand to her
  father's mouth.</p>

  <p>'Oh, hush, hush!' she said. 'Do not go on like that. I had no idea that
  you felt the strain so much, that you realised how&mdash;&mdash; Come and sit
  down.'</p>

  <p>The laughter had died away to a shallow cackle. Castlerayne collapsed into
  a chair, and his eyes closed. Nothing could be heard but his stentorian
  breathing. The silence was all the more oppressive by very contrast. May
  turned and whispered something to Angela, who rang the bell. The old butler
  came in scared and agitated.</p>

  <p>'Your master is ill,' May said. 'I am afraid he has had a shock. If you
  will be so good as to get somebody in the kitchen to go for Dr.
  Marfell&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I'll go myself, miss,' the old butler said. 'I know exactly what has
  happened. And if you will pardon me for saying so, miss, it was bound to come
  sooner or later. And there isn't one of us in the kitchen as isn't as sorry
  as you are, miss. We'll take good care as you're not troubled by that man,
  miss, even if we have to make ourselves affable to him in the kitchen.'</p>

  <p>'I am sure you are all very good,' May said tearfully.&mdash;'I hope to
  goodness I'm not going to begin crying now. Oh Angela, if Aunt Gertrude were
  only here now!'</p>

  <p>But Angela had already left the room. May stayed there by the side of the
  chair, holding a cold, limp hand, and chafing it in her fingers lovingly.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>The little house in the hospital was all in order at last, everything put
  in its place. It was a pity that nothing now remained to be done, Gertrude
  Castlerayne thought, because the time had come that she had dreaded, the hour
  when she could sit down and think. That being so, she cleaned out the cage of
  her canary for the second time in the afternoon, much to the annoyance of the
  somnolent bird, who had suffered sufficient change for one day. For the
  moment the eternal knitting had been mislaid; and, besides, Miss Castlerayne
  was not in the mood to sit down and knit to-night. She could hear some
  children still playing on the lawn outside, though it was quite dark by this
  time, and in the next cottage Mrs. Masters was obviously putting the smallest
  of her grandchildren to bed. It was very hard for that poor woman to be
  saddled with children at her time of life, but then they would have been
  worse off in the workhouse. It was a vision like this that reconciled Miss
  Castlerayne to the step that she had taken with regard to the hospital. And
  before long there was going to be ample provision for the old people.</p>

  <p>The children outside quarrelled presently; the sound of a smack floated on
  the heather-tinged air. Then there was something to do, a mission of
  forgetfulness. A few moments later, and the two little girls were in the
  cottage, one on either side of Miss Castlerayne, the pretty faces all smiles
  again; and never before had they listened to such a fairy tale as tickled
  their ears now. The blue eyes glistened; the light of the cheap lamp touched
  hair that had a warmer sheen of bronze in the shadows. They were pretty
  children, and they were clever children, which is the more valuable asset so
  far as the fastidious are concerned; and yet they would have looked
  commonplace and dowdy in workhouse poke-bonnets.</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the door presently, and Mrs. Masters's hard, gray
  head looked in. The vengeance in her eyes softened. Much hard work and much
  privation and sorrow had hardened a heart that was made to be soft and
  tender. Miss Castlerayne smiled a welcome.</p>

  <p>'Well, I never!' the old woman said. 'I couldn't make out <i>what</i> had
  become of they dratted children. I thought they'd gone off somewhere. And
  I've had a time getting their little brother to sleep. Still, I do my duty by
  them, as I promised their mother I would, poor girl!&mdash;And what do you
  want to come and worry the lady like this?'</p>

  <p>'They didn't,' Miss Castlerayne said, with that smile of hers that brought
  any child or dog in the neighbourhood to her side. 'I fetched them in. I am
  afraid they were having a little difference of opinion, so I got them to come
  and keep me company, and I told them a fairy tale. I am feeling very lonely,
  Mrs. Masters.'</p>

  <p>'Which I can feel for you, miss,' the elder woman said. 'I loved my old
  man and all my children; and but for you and the grace of God I should have
  ended my days in the House. And here these children of mine worrying you like
  this!&mdash;Come to bed.'</p>

  <p>'Let me come and help you. I'm not used to idleness.'</p>

  <p>It was almost a royal function in its way. Never had the pretty, blue-eyed
  little girls been put to bed like this before. Under Miss Castlerayne's
  gentle sway, the brushing of hair even had realised itself into a pleasure.
  The little ones had deemed that ceremony impossible hitherto without much
  tugging of tangles and vexatious tears. There was a ring of sincerity in
  their prayers that was quite unusual. As a token of gratitude, both the
  children conceived the intention of going to live with Miss Castlerayne as
  soon as possible. The whole thing was so pleasing that the lonely woman
  forgot her troubles for the time.</p>

  <p>She set out her frugal supper, and afterwards washed up the plates with
  her own hands. She was just a little afraid to go to bed; she had made up her
  mind that she was not going to break down, and she had her doubts as to her
  own strength of purpose. She wondered what they were doing at The Towers now,
  if Angela was in the drawing-room yet. She could see Angela in her black
  dress, with the whiteness of her arms and neck gleaming through the network
  of lace.</p>

  <p>And then the door opened, and Angela in the flesh stood there. She was
  wearing the black dress. Her clear, healthy flesh glowed in the light of the
  cheap lamp; but there was no smile on the face of the girl. A tragedy was in
  her dark eyes.</p>

  <p>'I knew that we could not do without you, Aunt Gertrude,' she said
  breathlessly, for she had come across the Common fast. 'The worst has
  happened&mdash;the very worst. And dad has had a kind of stroke. We can do
  nothing with him. Come with me at once, dear.'</p>

  <p>They sped over the Common together, leaving the door open and the light of
  the lamp flaring like a beacon behind them.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A RAGGED moon just gave sufficient light for Miss
  Castlerayne and Angela to keep to the path across the Common. It had been
  much darker when Angela felt her way towards the hospital. She had known
  every inch of it all her life, but it had been terribly hard work to reach
  her goal in the darkness. There were pitfalls and stumbling-blocks that she
  had never dreamt of, dangerous gullies and heathery waterways that in the
  daytime were no more than oases for the late gentians.</p>

  <p>'Your dress is all in rags around your feet!' Aunt Gertrude exclaimed. 'It
  was very brave of you to come like this, Angela.'</p>

  <p>'I did not stop to think,' Angela said simply. 'I was so horribly
  frightened. And I know that in a crisis like this we could not do without
  you. It was dreadful.'</p>

  <p>They had struck a cart-track by this time, so that walking was
  comparatively easy. Miss Castlerayne asked Angela to tell her all about
  it.</p>

  <p>'There is very little to tell,' Angela explained. 'Dad came back from
  Hardborough in a very depressed state of mind. Mr. Summers had pointed out to
  him the hopelessness of the situation. He had urged bankruptcy. He said that
  when everything was disposed of we could let The Towers, which would produce
  a living income. He wanted dad to take that step at once to prevent the
  humiliation which has come. The thing should have been done at once; but of
  course dad put it off. And to-night, about an hour ago, the blow fell. It was
  horrible!'</p>

  <p>'You mean that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash; I hardly know how to express it,
  Angela.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. A man came&mdash;two men, in fact; and one of them remained&mdash;he
  will not leave till the money is paid. Don't ask me what money, for I can't
  say. Dad came into the dining-room and told us. Then he burst into a dreadful
  laugh and dropped into a chair. It was a stroke of some kind. Evidently he
  has been grieving and worrying far more deeply than we had imagined. And I
  came for you, dear.'</p>

  <p>The words were simple enough, but Miss Castlerayne did not fail to read
  the tragedy that lay behind them. A little time before, and she had been
  praying for some strenuous occupation for her hands and head, and the prayer
  had been answered.</p>

  <p>'Will he know me, do you think?' she asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>'I fancy so. I don't think that the mind is affected, only the body and
  power of speech. I am quite sure that dad was terribly upset to find you
  gone. From what he said, he was only posing last night. I expect that the
  phrase as to your being a guest in the house struck him as clever. I am
  certain he was very sorry.'</p>

  <p>Miss Castlerayne was glad to hear it. The ragged moon was falling behind
  the walls of the old castle and the trees beyond; there were lights all over
  the house. May sat in the dining-room by the side of her father, still
  chafing his hands. As yet the doctor had not put in an appearance.</p>

  <p>Gertrude Castlerayne came and bent over the couch; a little sigh of
  gratitude escaped her. She wanted no telling that nothing was wrong with the
  brain of the stricken man. There was no sign of apoplexy or serious mischief
  of that kind here. The eyes were too clear for that, their gaze steady and
  sane. There was utter paralysis, the result of a great shock.</p>

  <p>'Can you understand what I am saying?' Miss Castlerayne asked. 'You know
  where you are?'</p>

  <p>The clear eyes responded where the tongue was useless. The head of the
  house understood.</p>

  <p>'I am going to remain here,' Miss Castlerayne went on. 'I should never
  have gone away. I shall be only too glad to do what I can.&mdash;May, you
  have sent for the doctor?'</p>

  <p>May responded through her tears that such was the case. The girl was
  crying quietly without being in the least aware of the fact.</p>

  <p>It was a great relief when Dr. Marfell bustled in presently. The white
  hair was ruffled on his head as if he had had no time to brush it, as if he
  had tumbled straight out of bed to come here. He nodded curtly without
  waiting to waste time in words of sympathy. He proceeded with his work.</p>

  <p>'Paralytic stroke,' he said. 'Result of some shock. Easy-going people are
  often more easily knocked over than those who fret and worry. There are no
  sinister signs, and the patient knows exactly what I am saying. He must be
  got to bed; he must get sleep, though I don't want to administer drugs if I
  can help it.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Castlerayne was in bed at length; he lay there absolutely still, with
  his eyes closed. At the instigation of Dr. Marfell, there were no lights. He
  could do nothing further, he said; it was all a question of time and nature.
  He would come again in the morning.</p>

  <p>Angela followed the speaker into the dining-room, where May was
  waiting.</p>

  <p>'Is it very, very bad?' she asked. 'Is there any hope of recovery?'</p>

  <p>'Bless my soul! yes,' Marfell snapped. 'Every chance. Your father is not
  yet sixty; he has a sound constitution. He has been worrying lately, and the
  shock has been too much for him. If you could only remove the source of
  anxiety he would pick up marvellously. I've known cases like this practically
  cured in a fortnight. And, mind you, his brain is quite clear; he knows every
  word that you say to him. If you can remove the trouble&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>May started eagerly. She moved as if about to say something; then she
  changed her mind.</p>

  <p>'The trouble is in the kitchen,' Angela said bitterly. 'It takes the form
  of a sheriff's officer&mdash;I believe that is the legal jargon. It means,
  Dr. Marfell, that the Castleraynes of The Towers have ceased to exist as a
  family; it means that we shall have to leave here. I am afraid that that
  trouble is permanent, if my father's recovery rests on that.'</p>

  <p>'I didn't say it did,' Marfell retorted. 'I said that the removal of the
  trouble would facilitate the recovery of the patient. I hope to pull him
  round in any case. What you have to pray for is a good night's rest for him,
  which will be better than all the medicine in the world. I am going to leave
  things to nature for the present.'</p>

  <p>It was a long and lonely vigil that Angela insisted on taking on herself.
  She drove Miss Castlerayne to bed on the understanding that the latter was to
  be called if necessary. She would not hear of May sharing her watch. She sat
  there in the velvety darkness by the bedside, listening to the heavy
  breathing of the sick man. On the whole, these were the darkest and most
  miserable hours of the girl's life. She did not realise, perhaps, that she
  was better for the ordeal; but so it was. The glory of the family had
  departed; henceforth there were going to be no Castleraynes of The Towers.
  She and May would go and get their own living as girls quite as well nurtured
  as themselves had done before. It seemed incredible now that she had held up
  her head so haughtily with the full knowledge of the shameful indebtedness of
  the family. How much nobler had been the part played by the Warreners!
  Contact with trade had not contaminated Clifford Warrener; he had been
  enabled to make a garden from an arid desert. Angela blushed as she thought
  of that June morning in the rose-garden. She had had her chance then; the
  best man she had ever met had loved her, and she had scorned his advances. He
  no longer cared for her, or he would never have stayed away all these months.
  These thoughts and others played through Angela's mind as she sat there till
  the velvet blackness of the room turned to a sombre gray, and the gray
  presently was shot with saffron tinges. Then the gold and pink edged the
  saffron, and the pearly dawn came tiptoe from the mists of the Common. The
  stentorian breathing from the bed had ceased. Angela bent, to find that her
  father was fast asleep.</p>

  <p>This was exactly what Marfell had hoped for. It was necessary to keep the
  house quiet.</p>

  <p>May came in presently to relieve Angela's long vigil. She hoped that
  Angela would go and sleep for a few hours.</p>

  <p>'I have not the least disposition to sleep,' Angela whispered. 'I am going
  to have a bath and a cup of milk. Then, as it is such a lovely morning, I
  shall take a long walk across the Common and back. All you have to do is to
  keep the house quiet.'</p>

  <p>The red rim of the sun was climbing over the fringe of pines behind the
  hospital, driving the pearly mists before it. The air was fresh and sweet
  from the sea, so that a faint wave of exhilaration filled Angela. So far as
  she was concerned, the bitterness of disgrace and trouble was past; she was
  in the mood of contentment and the dinner of herbs. She looked very dainty
  and refined as she reached the fringe of the Common. There was a kind of big
  valley here, interspersed with patches of gorse and heather, and a ragged pit
  where the drift-sand lay. The floor was carpeted with the thick grass of
  centuries, and each fine blade sparkled with the dew of diamonds. There was
  the sound of a crack behind, and a little white ball fell almost at Angela's
  feet. Then came another. It was borne in upon Angela's mind that somebody
  close by was practising golf-shots.</p>

  <p>'Absolutely perfect,' a clear voice rang out. 'Nothing better in the
  kingdom. That line of natural hazards on the left side of the
  valley&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>The voice stopped. Angela had recognised it. A moment later and Clifford
  Warrener was properly apologising for the carelessness of himself and his
  companion. He had not expected anybody to be out on the Common at that hour
  of the morning.</p>

  <p>'I might have killed you,' he said anxiously. 'You see, it's a blind
  hole&mdash;I mean from where we stood in the valley&mdash;and out of sight.
  You know my friend Brooke?&mdash;Brooke, come and help me to make my peace
  with Miss Castlerayne.'</p>

  <p>The tall man in the Harris tweeds abased himself before Angela. He was
  exceedingly sorry, but one of his balls had rolled into a patch of heather.
  It was a new kind of ball, and he was anxious not to lose it. If Miss
  Castlerayne would excuse him&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Golf lunatic,' Warrener laughed as his colleague moved away; 'otherwise
  quite sane. He is a marvellous player, and one of the great scribes of the
  game. You will see later on the uses that I shall put Brooke to. You are out
  very early, Miss Angela, and, if I may be allowed to say it, you are looking
  very tired.'</p>

  <p>Angela proceeded to explain. She conquered her pride to that extent. It
  was better that Warrener should hear the story from her lips than hear it
  garbled by gossip later on. And as the story proceeded, Angela was glad that
  she had confided in Warrener. He looked very handsome and very sympathetic as
  he listened to what she had to say. Her words were well spoken and to the
  point. There was a light like a flash of triumph in his eyes.</p>

  <p>'I think I can be of assistance here,' he said. 'Indeed, I am quite sure
  of it.&mdash;Brooke, will you take the clubs back to the farm and ask that
  breakfast should be ready for me in half-an-hour? I find that I have to go in
  to Hardborough.&mdash;I am sorry that I left this thing so long to take care
  of itself.'</p>

  <p>'You speak as if the fault were yours,' Angela said.</p>

  <p>'Well, so it is to a great extent,' Warrener said with a cryptic air.
  'Still, Dr. Marfell is right in saying that the removal of the source of the
  trouble will be attended by the happiest results. I shall be able to try the
  experiment. It would be a terrible trial to you to have to leave the old
  house behind you.'</p>

  <p>'I think I could endure it,' Angela confessed. 'I am not so proud as I
  was.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WITH a spontaneous gesture, Angela held out her hand. It was
  a brave and generous confession, and the girl felt all the better for it.
  There was a deep, admiring light in Warrener's eyes as he held the slim
  fingers in his. He knew what an effort the words cost.</p>

  <p>'You can't tell how glad I am to hear you say that,' he said in a low
  voice. 'You are ready for the sacrifice; but the blow shall not fall if I can
  prevent it. I shall come and see you this evening, if I may; I shall have
  something to say to you.'</p>

  <p>Angela smiled and coloured. She had forgotten all about her troubles for
  the moment. The sun and the shadows chased each other across the Common; the
  breeze was fresh from the sea. Angela's step was light and springy as she
  turned her face towards home.</p>

  <p>All the same, it was a monotonous morning that followed. The patient awoke
  a little before midday and took some food. He was obviously the better for
  his long sleep; he managed to articulate a few words with difficulty. He
  seemed anxious to know if Miss Castlerayne was there; he seemed to be
  relieved by her presence. Marfell was frankly pleased. The recovery was only
  a question of time, especially if the source of the trouble could be
  moved.</p>

  <p>Luncheon was ready on the table when Mr. Summers arrived. He had heard
  casually in Hardborough what had happened, and had come over at once. There
  was a repressed air of excitement about him that was very unusual in the
  decorous old family attorney. Subject to the doctor's approval, he had a
  proposal to make to his unfortunate client. Perhaps Miss Castlerayne would
  send for the doctor after luncheon.</p>

  <p>'There is really no necessity, Mr. Summers,' Angela said. 'If you have
  anything calculated to ease my father's anxiety of mind you need not hesitate
  to tell him what it is. His mind is as clear as yours or mine. Dr. Marfell
  would welcome anything calculated to ease his anxiety. But it can't be
  possible that there is any chance&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'My dear young lady, nothing is impossible. Money flies in strange
  fashions; it comes in the same way. The wealth of the world was more or less
  started by a genius who watched a kettle boiling. There are different kinds
  of diamond-mines at the back-door of all of us, if we had the sense to know
  it. I shall be glad to see your father as soon as possible.'</p>

  <p>It was Angela who escorted Summers to the invalid's bedroom. Miss
  Castlerayne would have done so had not May mentioned that the task should be
  Angela's. She whispered that there was the beginning of the unfolding of the
  great secret. But Angela took no heed. She was glad to see the gleam of
  recognition in her father's eyes as Summers entered the sick-room.</p>

  <p>'I'm going to talk to you,' Summers said. 'I can see that you are
  perfectly capable of following me. If you had taken my advice the trouble
  would have been saved. Still, it really does not matter, seeing that you are
  in a position to clear off all your liabilities in a day or two. If you are
  quite agreeable, we will get rid of Craggs's claim at once. I've telegraphed
  the Deputy-Sheriff to see me here at three o'clock and get his cheque.'</p>

  <p>Angela fairly gasped. It was the old miracle of the unexpected again.
  Castlerayne's hand moved to his head and then fell again. He essayed a
  smile.</p>

  <p>'What does it mean?' Angela whispered. 'Mr. Summers, what does it
  mean?'</p>

  <p>'It means nothing at all unless you restrain yourself,' Summers said
  severely. 'If you unduly excite your father I shall have to turn you out of
  the room. It is very irregular for a third person to be present at an
  important interview between solicitor and client. It means, in plain English,
  that I have had a good offer&mdash;a splendid offer&mdash;for the waste land
  between the high-water mark and the hills that lie on the far side of the
  hospital. There are about two hundred acres of this land altogether, and I
  have been offered fourteen thousand pounds for them. As for some years I have
  been authorised to accept as many hundreds, I closed with the offer. The
  purchaser is a rich man, and he paid the deposit to-day. He stipulated that
  the transaction should be completed in a week, and there is no reason why it
  should not be so completed. The cheque he paid me will more than satisfy the
  claim of Craggs's solicitors, so that in a short time you will be rid of your
  skeleton in the butler's pantry. Within a few days all the creditors will be
  paid, and you will save your family treasures. But so far as I can see, it
  would be wise of you not to try and keep up The Towers any longer.'</p>

  <p>'Who is this madman?' Angela asked in a voice that shook strangely. 'Who
  is the dreamer who offers all this money for that waste land?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, he is no dreamer,' Summers laughed. 'He is a fine business man, and
  you may be certain that he is not going to throw his money away.'</p>

  <p>'But it sounds so like an act of magnificent charity on the part of some
  friend&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'My dear young lady, tell me the name of any friend of yours who is in a
  position to indulge in such an act of magnificent charity. I tell you the
  purchaser is one of the most successful business men in England. He is
  speculating. As frequently happens in such cases, he does not wish to have
  his name declared for the present. Be satisfied that he has saved your good
  name and lifted the trouble from your house.'</p>

  <p>Something like a smile passed over the face of Rayne Castlerayne; it was
  quite evident that he had followed every word with the closest attention. The
  white, strained look had gone from his face. He gave a long, contented sigh,
  and closed his eyes. The obvious suggestion was that he left everything to
  Summers. A moment later and a sound of his regular breathing could be heard
  in the room.</p>

  <p>'He is asleep again,' Angela whispered. 'Let us go and discuss the
  marvellous change of affairs with the others. I can hardly believe it
  yet.'</p>

  <p>Miss Castlerayne cried placidly as she listened to Summers's dry recital.
  The story washed the last drop of bitterness from her cup. She had saved the
  hospital without doing the least harm to the fortunes of the family. May
  laughed; there was a strange glitter in her eyes. In some vague way, Angela
  decided that May knew all about it. She expressed no astonishment at
  Summers's amazing story. The butler looked in presently with the information
  that somebody had called to see Mr. Summers on business. With a quiet air of
  satisfaction, the lawyer called for pen and ink, and he produced a
  cheque-book from his pocket. He came back from the library presently with a
  smile of pleased contentment.</p>

  <p>'The skeleton has gone,' he said. 'The skeleton's employer has taken
  nearly twelve hundred pounds that might just as well have been saved; but it
  is no use to cry over the milk that has been spilt. I am going to take the
  liberty of settling my esteemed client's affairs for him, seeing that he is
  incapable of doing so himself, which perhaps, in a way, is not altogether a
  misfortune. In a few days I shall have the balance of that purchase-money in
  my possession. If you will supply me with a full list of all the claims, Miss
  Castlerayne, I will discharge them at once.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, indeed, I will!' Aunt Gertrude laughed and cried in the same breath.
  'Oh, the peaceful heaven of being absolutely out of debt! I can't realise it
  yet. And if I could go down on my knees and thank this unknown benefactor of
  ours&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'He would feel very awkward,' May smiled. 'Mr&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I mean
  the gentleman in question&mdash;may not be such a benefactor after all. He
  may spoil the place; he may start some dreadful manufacture there&mdash;say,
  for instance, soap. I did not mean that. I&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>May paused in some confusion. Angela shot a keen glance at her. May had
  evidently known all about this from the first. A flash of illumination came
  to Angela. All her tenderness and self-abasement had vanished; her pride was
  in arms once more. She knew everything now as plainly as if May had told her.
  The first suspicion had been correct. She crossed over to the window and
  looked towards the Common, soft and tender in the sunshine. It had been bad
  enough before; it was no better now. What did it matter whether the family
  had a host of small creditors or one large one, generous as the latter might
  be? And as if any girl worthy of the name was likely to be dazzled by
  ostentation like that! Angela was feeling very hard and bitter at that
  moment.</p>

  <p>She was glad to be alone presently. May had gone as far as the hospital
  after tea, and Miss Castlerayne was sitting with the invalid. He had managed
  to ask for a cup of tea. Angela had strolled into the garden, where a few
  late roses were blooming still. The amber light of the slanting sun was on
  her face; it seemed a very fair one to Warrener as he came up the drive. His
  head was high; he seemed to be on the best of terms with himself.</p>

  <p>'You told me I might come,' he said. 'How is the invalid now?'</p>

  <p>'The invalid is much better,' Angela said coldly. 'A wonderful thing has
  happened. A purchaser has come forward and bought some of the waste land
  behind the hospital. It appears that he has paid about four times as much for
  it as the whole estate is worth. Mr. Summers told me so. He has paid enough
  absolutely to clear us and leave us something besides. The skeleton has gone,
  and my father is so much better that he was able to ask for a cup of tea. And
  for all this we are indebted to the generous charity of Mr. Clifford
  Warrener.'</p>

  <p>The attack was so swift, so cold, and so unexpected that Warrener was
  thrown into confusion. His face hardened a little as he noted the clear,
  metallic brilliancy of Angela's eyes.</p>

  <p>'Will you be so good as to be a little more explicit?' he said.</p>

  <p>'Why fence with me?' Angela cried. 'I know that you are the purchaser. May
  could not disguise her thoughts; she was in the conspiracy. A few words of
  hers betrayed you. Mr. Warrener, is this thing kind or generous of you?'</p>

  <p>'Generosity has nothing to do with it. What do you complain of?'</p>

  <p>'Of the whole thing. Why do you humiliate us? Why do you come here like
  this, making a display of your wealth? You may think it very clever to trap
  us like this; but the result is just the same. You might have left us our
  pride. We were going to sell everything and leave The Towers. The hurt of it
  would have softened. And your scheme is so transparent. Nobody in their
  senses would give a tenth part of what you gave for that poor land. I can't
  recognise it as anything but another form of charity.'</p>

  <p>The words came rapidly from Angela's lips; she stood there with the
  sunshine still full upon her beautiful, haughty, angry face. Yet there was a
  pathetic droop of her lips, a suggestion of a plea in her splendid eyes.
  Warrener was obviously restraining himself.</p>

  <p>'You are quite wrong,' he said; 'and you will be bound to admit it when
  you know everything. And there is no suggestion of charity about what I have
  done. I am going to make twice the money out of my purchase, regarded as a
  fine business transaction. If that land had been the property of a total
  stranger I should have been quite as eager to get it&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Stop, before you go any further. Would you have offered as much money for
  it?'</p>

  <p>An angry red flushed Warrener's face. He could not stoop to lie. Angela
  had hit the one weak spot in his argument. He waited for her to go on.</p>

  <p>'I see it is exactly as I say,' she resumed. 'I dare say you mean well.
  But if you think that your money is a sure and certain way to a girl's heart,
  why&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>It was Angela's turn to pause in confusion. The cruel scarlet flamed over
  her face; tears of vexation rose to her eyes. Oh, what must he think of her?
  By way of reply, Warrener raised his cap, and, turning on his heel, walked
  slowly from the garden.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE peace of the Indian summer seemed to lie over all the
  land. They were halcyon days for the Castleraynes, such as they had no
  recollection of before; and the weather seemed to be in sympathetic mood.
  There were the still mornings filled to the zenith with the pearly mist out
  of which the rowans and the ivy-clad walls of the encircling castle rose,
  then the gradual transformation to the thin pink veil, with the Common rising
  like a picture beyond. No sound broke the stillness; nothing disturbed the
  sheets of bracken beaten now to a dull-red gold, a flaming scarlet, a pure
  veined cream where the shade of the oaks had protected it. Nature rested in a
  kind of orange glory. The fine profligacy of the October hedgesides struck
  the eye boldly; the bees, drugged by the saffron, had ceased to hum in the
  still air; even the sea was silent.</p>

  <p>The gales would come later; the rain would roar over the hillside in
  blinding battalions; but that time seemed far off. Inside the house was the
  same feeling of peace and restfulness, the same brimming joy of existence;
  for the skeleton had gone, and the cloud of debt had vanished. There was
  nothing to be afraid of now, and Miss Castlerayne positively grew fat over
  the red-lettered tradesmen's books which she was now paying regularly each
  week. She had forgotten all about her harbour of refuge at the hospital. She
  had a vague idea that she would go back there some of these days. But not
  yet, not until Rayne Castlerayne was fit to take the reins of government once
  more in his own hands. He was wonderfully better; he had made marvellous
  progress since the day when Mr. Summers had come with the good news. He had
  asked no questions; he was quite prepared to take the goods the gods
  provided. He was getting about his bedroom now, and was eager for the
  sunshine.</p>

  <p>'I've told him to come down to dinner to-day,' Marfell said. He was a
  little more gracious than usual, his white hair almost on the verge of
  tidiness. The paying of his account had perhaps had a soothing effect. 'After
  to-morrow he may do as he likes.'</p>

  <p>'A most wonderful recovery,' Miss Castlerayne said unsteadily, 'is it
  not?'</p>

  <p>'Nothing of the kind,' Marfell retorted. There was the opportunity to
  contradict that he had longed for without violating his conscience. 'Really,
  there was nothing the matter. I told you from the first that there was no
  real brain-mischief. There are some natures that can't rise superior to
  trouble, and your brother is one of them. You say that care never worried
  him. That was because he only knew care by hearsay; he could not believe that
  it would come. And when it did come, when it was brought home to him, the
  shock was very great. The trouble vanishes, and he begins to be himself
  again. He will be quite well by the end of the week.'</p>

  <p>Marfell's prophecy was fulfilled to the letter. By the end of the week
  Rayne Castlerayne was quite himself again. He began to hold up his head once
  more; there were one or two little schemes for the improvement of The Towers
  that might be put in hand. The balance of his windfall he regarded as quite
  inexhaustible.</p>

  <p>'No, no,' May protested; 'let us wait a little and see if the good fortune
  is going any further. Even as it is, we cannot afford to live here.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Castlerayne demurred. They were walking together along the terrace on
  the west side of the house, in the sun. There were still a few late roses,
  but for the most part the trees glistened with the elastic shine of cobwebs.
  Angela paced up and down with the others gloomily. She was the only one of
  the family who looked none the better for the good fortune. She was pale and
  distracted; there were dark rings under her eyes. She had moments when May
  found her very difficult.</p>

  <p>'What do you want me to do?' Castlerayne asked.</p>

  <p>'Invest the balance of your windfall,' May said. 'Ask Mr. Warrener to
  advise you. He will be able to do that to the best advantage. It ought to
  give us another three hundred a year, which, with the rent of The Towers,
  will enable us to live.'</p>

  <p>'Leave The Towers?' Mr. Castlerayne protested. 'Really, my dear
  child&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Leave The Towers,' May went on inexorably. 'We had arranged to do it
  before. We have nothing like enough money to live properly here. Oh! don't
  let us drift into debt again. Let us be thankful for the unknown
  benefactor&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Is he unknown?' Angela asked suddenly. There was a look of scorn on her
  pale face. 'May, do you mean to say that you don't know who purchased that
  land&mdash;you don't know whose charity we have been relying on?'</p>

  <p>A puzzled expression crossed May's face. It was clear she did not
  understand.</p>

  <p>'Indeed I don't, my dear,' she said. 'I didn't ask any questions. Mr.
  Summers told me that the purchaser desired that his name should not be
  mentioned for the present. He had consented not to start any trade there, and
  that sufficed me.'</p>

  <p>'Then the offer has nothing to do with the great secret you and Mr.
  Warrener&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Nothing whatever,' May cried. 'If you had been sharp-sighted enough to
  discover&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'It is rather you who have been so blind,' Angela said bitterly. 'But I
  thought you knew. The purchaser of that land is your friend Clifford
  Warrener.'</p>

  <p>May's look of astonishment was perfectly genuine. Angela could see that at
  a glance. Mr. Castlerayne was taking no interest in the discussion whatever.
  He was rather afraid that some of the roses needed renewing.</p>

  <p>'Are you quite sure of your facts?' May asked. 'I hardly think that Mr.
  Warrener&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Would have kept you in the dark,' Angela cut in in the same bitter
  strain. 'Evidently he has done so on this occasion. But he is the purchaser
  of that land on the far side of the hospital, because he admitted as much to
  me.'</p>

  <p>'Go on,' May murmured. 'You don't know how interested I am.'</p>

  <p>'There is very little more to tell. It happened the morning after father
  was taken ill. I sat with him most of the night, you remember.'</p>

  <p>'Good girl!' Castlerayne said <i>sotto voce</i>. He was examining the
  heart of a tea-rose with consuming interest. 'The comfort that one gets from
  one's children, especially if they have been brought up as well as
  means&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'It is a blessed privilege.' Angela laughed unsteadily. 'I went for a walk
  before breakfast&mdash;I could not sleep&mdash;and I met Mr. Warrener. It was
  quite early; he was out with Mr. Brooke practising golf-strokes. It struck me
  then as rather a strange thing for two grown men to be so childishly
  occupied.'</p>

  <p>'Not at all,' May said in some indignation. 'Golf is a great institution.
  I have heard it called one of God's good things. Look what a healthy game it
  is, so devoid of morbid excitement. I have been having lessons from Mr.
  Brooke. He is one of the finest players in the country; he is a great
  authority on the game, and he tells me that we have the making here of
  perhaps the best golf-links in the kingdom. The turf is absolutely perfect;
  the greens are wonderfully good; the hazards are just what they should be,
  and they are just in the right places. The Romans probably played golf
  here.'</p>

  <p>'Go on,' Angela laughed. 'Apparently you have caught the fever. Tell us
  that golf is a panacea for old age; in fact, there is no old age when one
  takes to golf. I believe that in Scotland it is an institution. But you
  interrupted me. As I was saying, on that particular morning I met Mr.
  Warrener. I told him everything. He stopped his game at once, saying that he
  had to go to Hardborough. Of course I did not guess what was in his mind
  then, but I knew directly Mr. Summers came. As soon as Mr. Summers told us
  all about the mysterious sale of that land I knew quite as well as if Mr.
  Warrener had made a confession to me. And you didn't, May?'</p>

  <p>'I give you my word of honour that I didn't,' May declared.</p>

  <p>'I can't think how you could have been so blind. Oh, can't you see that
  this is only another form of accepting charity? I said nothing about it till
  dad here was strong again.&mdash;There is nothing the matter with that
  rose-tree; it is only that the bark has grown rusty.&mdash;I repeat that we
  owe all our present prosperity to the charity of Mr. Warrener. He didn't come
  and fling the money at us; he is too much of a gentleman for that. But he
  does something that is quite as transparent: he buys some acres of mud and
  sand at a fancy price, and pretends that he has driven a wonderfully good
  bargain.'</p>

  <p>'So he has,' May said calmly. 'I begin to understand now, though I had not
  been consulted as to the developments. If you taxed him with
  it&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I have done so; and he did not deny it.&mdash;Father, have you nothing to
  say?'</p>

  <p>Mr. Castlerayne abandoned his critical examination of the offending
  rose-tree with reluctance. He had no great admiration for Angela in these
  moods. He was never likely to conquer his distaste for facing an awkward
  question squarely.</p>

  <p>'Really, my dear,' he protested, 'I fail to see why you should drag me
  into the business. I have a certain estate to dispose of; on the other hand
  there is a man who needs the estate. He offers me what appears to be a fancy
  price; in reality, it may be a great bargain. I lack the commercial mind, so
  I can't possibly tell. Warrener is a gentleman; he belongs to a good old
  family; he is a very nice fellow, but he is essentially a man of business. I
  refuse to believe that he bought this land to please me. I shall be very glad
  if you will ask him to come and dine to-morrow, and bring his friend Brooke
  along. I was at Oxford with a Raymond Brooke. I wonder if this man is any
  relation.'</p>

  <p>Probably Angela would have persisted in her hopeless task had not she
  detected the mocking smile in May's eyes. That smile seemed to take all the
  steel out of her arguments. For, till quite recently, May had been more
  vehement on the subject of the family carelessness than herself. May had
  always soundly denounced the extravagance and sin of debt; she was the last
  person in the world to nibble at the bread of charity, buttered though it
  might be and spread with caviare withal. And May, though Angela had obviously
  surprised her, was not in the least annoyed or offended; quite the
  contrary.</p>

  <p>'It is no use for you to "kick against the pricks,"' the younger girl
  said. 'I am perfectly certain that Mr. Warrener has made an excellent
  bargain. He could sell that land for twice the money to-morrow. My dear, you
  are like Mrs. Partington with her broom trying to sweep back the Atlantic
  Ocean; you are a pretty little fly on the wheel of progress. Would you like
  to know everything?'</p>

  <p>'Of course I should,' Angela admitted. She laughed despite herself. 'Being
  a woman, it is only natural I should have a little curiosity.'</p>

  <p>'Then your curiosity shall be gratified. You shall make your peace with
  Clifford Warrener in your own way afterwards. Go into the house and write the
  note dad requires to those two men asking them to dinner to-morrow. Cophetua,
  Cophetua, you are translated! "For you shall walk in silk attire, and siller
  hae to spare!" And to-morrow night you shall know the great secret.'</p>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was with some hesitation that Angela fulfilled her
  father's request. She had not seen Clifford Warrener for some days; it seemed
  to her that he was keeping out of the way. She wanted him, and she did not
  want him; she did not recognise as yet how essential he was to her happiness.
  It had pleased her lately to look upon Warrener as a purse-proud man who had
  tried to earn favour at the hands of the Castleraynes by a clumsy expedient
  which was obviously borrowed from the cheaply sensational class of novel.</p>

  <p>And yet Angela was doubtful. She felt more than doubtful after she had
  exploded her mine with so little effect. She had expected, at any rate, to
  enlist May on her side. But May seemed to be in close alliance with the foe;
  also, she had shaken Angela's most cherished convictions by her statement
  that Warrener's action had had nothing of charity about it, but that the most
  possible explanation was a mutual convenience.</p>

  <p>If that were so, then Angela would have to apologise. In the plainest
  possible words she had accused Warrener of thrusting his charity upon the
  family; indeed, she had gone further than that. She knew that Warrener loved
  her; she dared not ask herself yet if she reciprocated that feeling. She knew
  that she dared not analyse her feelings, and she had actually told Clifford
  Warrener that he had done this thing as a cheap and short cut to a girl's
  heart. The words came back to her now with cruel force. Warrener had turned
  his back on her and gone away without another word. Really, he might have
  stopped; he might have given her a chance to prevaricate, as women can in
  such cases. But he had gone off, obviously wounded, and the girl had not seen
  him since. If May's contentions were correct, then there would be nothing for
  it but a penitent apology. Angela recognised that, and she would make the
  apology whatever it cost her. So she wrote the note, and in the course of the
  next morning came the reply to the effect that the men in question would be
  only too happy. Angela had settled the dinner <i>menu</i> with Aunt Gertrude;
  she had nothing to do. May stood before her, radiant in homespun skirt and
  coat, with a bag of new clubs under her arm.</p>

  <p>'Come along and try this exasperating, fascinating game,' she cried. 'My
  new clubs have come; Mr. Brooke got them from Westward Ho for me. He says
  there are no clubs like Gibson's. He is going to give me a lesson. Do come
  and see.'</p>

  <p>Angela hesitated for a moment She had very little doubt that Warrener
  would be there also. She felt that she would like to meet him before he came
  to dinner. Angela told herself that she did not quite approve of the way in
  which May was passing her afternoons in the company of Mr. Brooke. There was
  a sacred duty before her.</p>

  <p>On the level plantation of ground before the half-ruined Dower-House the
  powerful figure of Mr. Raymond Brooke stood. He was contemplating the sweep
  of landscape before him with admiring eyes. It seemed to Angela that she
  could hear the purring rattle of mowing-machines. Certain patches of the turf
  looked a lighter colour than the rest. Here and there red and white flags
  fluttered from tall bamboo sticks; here and there were poles picked out in
  red and white and blue. May's colour had heightened; her eyes were sparkling
  with pleasure.</p>

  <p>'Oh Angela! they've laid it out,' she cried. 'They must have worked like
  demons since the early morning. And H&mdash;&mdash;, the champion, only
  planned out the course yesterday. It shows how naturally good it is, to get
  everything ready so soon.'</p>

  <p>Brooke came forward with his cap in his hand. He took the bags and handed
  the clubs to a couple of small boys standing by. Angela had had a great deal
  to occupy her attention lately, and a guilty feeling came over her as she saw
  the familiar terms the golfers were on. It was a relief to know that Raymond
  Brooke was in all ways desirable.</p>

  <p>'It's all ready,' Brooke cried. 'The course is as good now as it ever will
  be. To my mind, there is nothing like it in the kingdom; an absolutely
  natural course&mdash;the golfer's ideal dream! And here it has been all these
  years, and nobody has discovered it.&mdash;Miss Castlerayne, are you going to
  have a lesson too?'</p>

  <p>'I am not,' Angela said decidedly. It was obviously the answer that was
  expected of her, and Brooke looked relieved. Golfers are generally selfish
  people, and hunt in couples. Occasionally they make a favour of taking in a
  third player; but the politeness is of the shallowest kind. 'I am going to
  keep at a respectful distance, and watch you.'</p>

  <p>Brooke smote a ball long and far in the direction of the first flag, and
  May followed. Angela heard something that sounded like a 'perfect series of
  brassy lies;' but the jargon of the game was quite beyond her. If she had
  only realised what an abject slave she was going to become before long!</p>

  <p>'It is glorious!' May cried. 'You must have a try, Angela. To think that
  we have conquered boredom for good and all! Castlerayne will never be dull to
  me again.'</p>

  <p>It sounded foolish and extravagant; but there are thousands of wise and
  good people&mdash;statesmen, divines, authors, poets, and the like&mdash;who
  say the same thing; and there are thousands of poor villagers away up north,
  on sterile coasts, who have good reason to welcome the advent of the finest
  outdoor game that ever came as a boon to mankind. But Angela was not
  enthusiastic yet. She was almost glad when Warrener appeared. He came out of
  the Dower-House with a man who in some subtle way conveyed to Angela that he
  was an architect.</p>

  <p>'No, I'm not going to play,' Warrener said. 'I have too much to
  do.&mdash;Miss Angela! You have my sincere sympathy in your sister's
  affliction. She's got the fever.'</p>

  <p>Angela laughed; her face flushed slightly. She wondered why she always
  felt so exalted and happy in the society of this man, and why she always
  quarrelled with him. She was a masterful girl, and she had met her master.
  When she realised the fact she had her happiness fairly grasped in both
  hands. He seemed to have forgotten their last disagreement; there was a smile
  on his face, and something in the look of his eye that caused Angela to cast
  hers down. So he had not forgotten her, and she was insanely glad.</p>

  <p>'Let us follow them,' he suggested. 'I want to go over the whole course
  now that it is finished. Between ourselves, I am almost as enthusiastic a
  player as Brooke, only he has more time. You see, he had his future ready
  made. At one time he wanted to be Lord Chancellor; but on mature
  consideration it came to him that Amateur Golf Champion would be a far more
  distinguished position. I may say it is much more likely to be realised.'</p>

  <p>'He seems a nice man,' Angela said. 'He has such a pleasing, open
  face.'</p>

  <p>'He is one of the best fellows in the world,' Warrener cried. 'And if my
  eyes are correct in their reading of those human documents yonder, your
  sister is a lucky girl, I'm glad of it, because I have a genuine affection
  for May. She has a very sweet temper, too.'</p>

  <p>'Meaning that I have not?' Angela laughed unsteadily. 'Perhaps you are
  right.'</p>

  <p>'Well, you have given me plenty of chances for judging,' Warrener said.
  'Still, we will not return to that. It is so glorious and perfect a day, with
  the grass in such good condition, that&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Now you are laughing at me!' Angela said with some indignation. 'Mr.
  Warrener, I have to make a sincere and humble apology to you. The last time
  we were together I was very rude and very unjust to you. How unjust I was I
  did not realise until this morning. I accused you of laying the family under
  a great obligation, of taking advantage of your money to impose&mdash;to
  impose&mdash;oh, how can I say it? You <i>know</i> what I mean.'</p>

  <p>Warrener looked down into the beautiful flushed face and tear-laden eyes.
  Here was the Angela that he had dreamt of, the loving woman who put
  everything aside for the man and his happiness. All the coldness and
  haughtiness had gone from her lips.</p>

  <p>'I know exactly what you mean,' he said. 'You accused me of trying to win
  your love that way. It was untrue and unkind, and you knew it all the
  time.'</p>

  <p>'Indeed, indeed I didn't. How could I? You purchased that worthless land
  at an enormous price, and thus rid us of all our troubles; you saved my
  father's life. And yet I was angry with you, because I thought more of my
  wretched self than the others. It is only now that I begin to realise how
  selfish and cowardly I have been.'</p>

  <p>'That's true,' Warrener admitted a little unexpectedly. 'But let me assure
  you that I have not done anything of the kind. The convenience was absolutely
  a mutual one. Your father had something to sell; there was something that I
  wanted to buy. I admit that it was lucky that the purchaser was here just at
  the psychological moment. And yet, before the misfortune came, if I had told
  your father what I wanted he would have refused me it. There has been a
  conspiracy, a conspiracy of three people against the dignity and comfort of
  the Castleraynes: I allude to your aunt Gertrude, to Craggs, and myself. I am
  not quite sure that I ought not to include your sister in the plot. At any
  rate, when I discussed my scheme to her she was very enthusiastic. But we had
  to use diplomacy. We had to face the latter in the shape of Mr. Castlerayne;
  we had to make him rich man.'</p>

  <p>'But nobody would call my father a rich man, Mr. Warrener.'</p>

  <p>'Not yet, but they will in two years' time. The whole thing is going to be
  divulged at dinner to-night. I was very glad to get your note. And you mean
  to say that you can't guess what the secret is; that you can't see the gold
  scattered all over the ground that you are walking on at this very
  minute?'</p>

  <p>Angela shook her head and smiled. She took a tendril of gorse in her
  slender pink fingers and tossed it in the air.</p>

  <p>'Only this yellow gold,' she said; 'but you can't pay bills with it.'</p>

  <p>'Oh yes, you can. It is all part of the fortune. The gorse is typical of
  the place, like the heather and the bracken. Angela, if you are satisfied
  that what I say&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Angela murmured a word under her breath. It sounded very like 'Bother!'
  For May and her companion had just appeared from the sloping side of a ravine
  filled with sand and bracken. Beyond the ravine and a little in front of it
  was a flat tableland edged with rugged sandhills, and in the centre of the
  level spot one of the flags waved in the breeze.</p>

  <p>'There's no question about it,' Brooke said in the tones of authority.
  'These are the best four successive holes in England. Three, two, and one
  shot holes. To think of this paradise lying neglected here for all these
  years! I dare say you have been telling Miss Castlerayne all about it.'</p>

  <p>'Indeed I haven't,' Warrener said dryly. 'We have been discussing a
  personal question. I really think that we have come to a proper understanding
  on a subject that has been a vexed question between us for some time.'</p>

  <p>Angela's face flamed, but there was a look of softness and happiness in
  her eyes. May smiled demurely. Everything was going just as she had hoped
  for.</p>

  <p>'Then you are not in possession of the great secret,' she said. 'My dear
  Angela, you must be blind! It lies before you so that he who runs may
  read.'</p>

  <p>'Miss Angela has not caught the fever yet,' Warrener said. 'But I shall
  proceed to make a full confession of the whole thing to-night after
  dinner.'</p>

  <p>May waved a club over her head with the abandon of utter enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>'To the secret!' she said. 'Here's to the secret, and Castlerayne
  Golf-Links; and long may they flourish! I shall love them for the rest of my
  life.'</p>

  <p>'<i>Royal</i> Castlerayne,' Brooke corrected. 'If ever the prefix was
  deserved by any links, it is deserved in the case of Royal Castlerayne.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">'FOR once in your life, I believe you are nervous,' May
  said. She was putting a few deft finishing-touches to Angela's toilet. 'You
  are pale, my sister; you are anxious over the great secret. There is nothing
  to fear.'</p>

  <p>'I believe I am,' Angela admitted. She stood contemplating herself
  dreamily in the long glass. She was dressed, as usual, in black; but she was
  not pale, and there was the most beautiful tinge of colour on her cheeks.
  There was a softness about her that was becoming, a gentle expression in her
  eyes. 'May, I have behaved badly. I'm <i>glad</i> old Craggs won that
  action.'</p>

  <p>'I knew you would be sooner or later,' May laughed. 'But then, you see, I
  have been behind the scenes all the time. Never was a greater blessing in
  disguise. We do not deserve our good fortune; and, indeed, we have done
  nothing to earn it, if we except Aunt Gertrude. We have been perfectly
  satisfied with the fact that we are Castleraynes. People who are in business
  we have despised. This pride of ours ruined Aunt Gertrude's life; it looked
  like ruining yours at one time; and now you are going to become the slave of
  the Emollient!'</p>

  <p>'You are ridiculous!' Angela laughed. 'Let us go downstairs.'</p>

  <p>'Oh yes, you are. Why don't you be honest and admit it? You love Clifford
  Warrener, and he loves you. You <i>know</i> it. That is why you were so
  miserable when he kept away. Let us go down and welcome our guests.'</p>

  <p>The curtains were drawn; the lamps, with their pink shades, filled the
  room with a rosy, subdued light. Angela had gathered the last of the roses;
  they had been arranged in the old Nanking bowls, with sprays of asparagus
  fern&mdash;the whole place was fragrant with the dewy scent of them. Here and
  there a shaft of light broke from under the fringe of the shades, and touched
  up the sombre brown-and-yellow of a Reynolds or a Romney. From obscure
  corners old silver gleamed. There was something very restful and very
  artistic about The Towers dining-room, Clifford Warrener thought as he
  glanced around him. Small wonder that the Castleraynes would have found the
  parting like a slow bleeding to the death. But they were not going to part
  with it now; the danger was over.</p>

  <p>Rayne Castlerayne stood expansively before the fireplace. There was not
  the slightest trace of his recent affliction on him now; he was essentially
  master of The Towers, bland, self-satisfied, and yet the colour of his speech
  was a trifle more subdued than it was wont to be. Like the others, he was
  just a little restless. Brooke had begun discussing golf eagerly with May
  directly she entered; Warrener was bending over Miss Castlerayne's chair.
  There was a small lamp behind it, and the eternal knitting was in her hand.
  It was impossible for those hands to remain idle for long.</p>

  <p>With fingers that trembled slightly, Angela drew one pink bud and a spray
  of fern from one of the Nanking bowls. She crossed over to Warrener and
  gently touched his shoulder. His eyes spoke to her; she read their
  message.</p>

  <p>'You have no flower,' she said simply. 'I&mdash;I have brought this for
  you. It is from my favourite tree in the garden, a tree that blooms for four
  months in the year. Do you remember that morning in June in the rose-garden
  when&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Warrener remembered&mdash;ay, he remembered. His eyes told Angela that
  too.</p>

  <p>'On that morning the first bloom came,' she went on. 'To-day I found the
  last one. I&mdash;I should like to put it in your button-hole for you.'</p>

  <p>There was no occasion for words; there was a perfect understanding between
  them. It was a very pretty and very graceful action of surrender. And Aunt
  Gertrude did not fail to understand; she looked up with moist eyes.</p>

  <p>'I feel as if Clifford might be a son of mine,' she said. 'We have been
  talking of his father. So I am going to have my romance over again in a new
  form, Angela. Oh, I know! And Clifford is so very like what his father used
  to be when&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>They filed in to dinner presently, the dinner which Aunt Gertrude had
  planned with such loving care. Her approving eye swept along the table,
  lingering on the silver and crystal, the flowers, and the fruit still with
  the ruddy bloom upon it. So the meal proceeded till at length the cloth was
  drawn in the old-fashioned way, and the dark, gleaming mahogany shone like a
  brown pool with the orchards of fruit upon it. There was a moment's
  pause.</p>

  <p>'I think,' Rayne Castlerayne began, 'that our young friend on my left has
  something to say. I hope he will speak freely. We have no strangers with us,
  unless we except Mr. Brooke, whom I am exceedingly glad to see here
  to-night.'</p>

  <p>'I&mdash;I hope I shall not be a stranger long, sir,' Brooke said calmly.
  'It rests more or less in the hands of your&mdash;I mean that circumstances
  have brought me into the conspiracy.'</p>

  <p>Clifford Warrener rose to his feet. He seemed to feel the gravity of his
  position.</p>

  <p>'The thing began quite naturally,' he said. 'When I met the daughters of
  my father's old friend in London we saw a good deal of one another. I made up
  my mind to come and revisit the pale glimpses of the moon the first time I
  had a chance. Eventually I came down because Miss May sent for me. She wanted
  to know if I could do anything to rescue the fallen fortunes of the family.
  Forgive me, but I must speak plainly, I came; I looked about me; I gave my
  imagination free play. Perhaps it is a little fortunate that I am a poet as
  well as a man of business. I lay on the Common and reflected. Surely all that
  grand sweep of country was not intended to be wasted! What good purpose could
  it be put to, to benefit humanity and put money in the proprietor's purse at
  the same time? You see, I was bound not to ignore the commercial side of the
  undertaking. As I walked over the Common the inspiration came to me. I sent
  for my friend Brooke, and he was emphatically of the same opinion as myself.
  There was a fortune for the making without doing one single act to defile the
  Common or mar its natural beauty.'</p>

  <p>'One moment,' Castlerayne murmured. 'Why did you not come to me?'</p>

  <p>'Because at that time you would not have been in sympathy with the
  project, sir,' Warrener said grimly. 'I am sorry, but I must be candid. I am
  certain you would have opposed it. Recollect how vehement you were against
  the hotel scheme. We had to contrive some way to render your opposition
  utterly powerless. Then the <i>deus ex machina</i> materialised in the person
  of Craggs. I wanted to do something for the hospital, and Craggs told me of
  his discovery in the matter of the charter. The hospital was saved. After
  that action was fought I had only to get the consent of the hospitallers, and
  they were secured for all time. They gave me a perpetual lease of the Common
  on certain conditions, in return for which all income arising from the Common
  is to be paid to the hospital for ever. Before very long we shall be able to
  quadruple the hospital accommodation, to build a chapel, to make it one of
  the finest charities in this part of the world. But I am getting on too
  fast.</p>

  <p>'Let me look to the great discovery. My discovery was that Castlerayne
  Common has the making of the finest golf-links in the world. Practically,
  nothing requires to be done to it; it is ready to play on to-day. In my
  friend Brooke I have the right man to make the place known far and wide.
  Whatever he writes about the game is law; and golf has become a British
  institution, one of the blessings of modern life. Any doctor will tell you
  that. Brooke says there is no place like the Common&mdash;it has everything.
  The golf will be perfect, the air delightful, the view unsurpassed in these
  islands. Close by we have aristocratic Hardborough, with its population of a
  quarter of a million. Within fifteen miles are quite a million and a half of
  people. We can command five hundred members at any entrance-fee we like to
  ask for, and any subscription. There will be no difficulty in getting a
  station here, as the Great Midland are going to make a line to Castleford;
  and if we can show them that it will pay they will make a detour here. That
  is only a detail.</p>

  <p>'I bought that piece of land above high-water mark. I was supposed to pay
  a fancy price for it; but I was in a position to accommodate my father's old
  friend here and do myself a good turn at the same time. I want to make that
  point clear.'</p>

  <p>Angela bent her head over her plate. Her face had grown suddenly warm. It
  was very fine and noble for Clifford to take his revenge in this way. She
  knew that he was speaking now to her alone, that he would never allude to the
  topic again. Oh, it was a fine thing to have a lover like that!</p>

  <p>But Warrener was speaking again.</p>

  <p>'We shall get our station,' he said, 'and, therefore, there will be no
  trouble to reach here. Before very long Castlerayne Links will be known all
  over the world. Well-known players will come here and give the place their
  blessing; doctors will recommend it. All I want Mr. Castlerayne to do is to
  give us the use of the Dower-House; it will make one of the finest
  club-houses in the kingdom. It is so old, so artistic, so fitting to the
  place. If we can manage that, our task is complete.'</p>

  <p>'I am quite in your hands,' Mr. Castlerayne murmured. 'I owe you so
  much.'</p>

  <p>'Thank you sincerely,' Warrener went on. 'Then everything is done. The
  income from all this will go to the hospital. I promised you that not one
  single inch of the face of nature should be defiled, and I have kept my word.
  Fortunes have been made in this way, and they will be again; but no greater
  fortune than lies in the splendid range of hills and heathery dunes that
  fringe the Common. To pursue the sordid side for a little longer, what is the
  present value of the land I allude to, sir?'</p>

  <p>'Practically nothing,' Mr. Castlerayne smiled. 'And I quite fail to

  <p>'Oh, that is because you have not had the business training. There must be
  at least five thousand acres of that land. People with means will naturally
  want to come and live here; they will require houses. We will cut the land up
  into plots of good size; we shall be able to sell that land at our own
  price&mdash;perhaps five hundred pounds per acre. We shall be able to dictate
  terms as to the class of house to be erected. There will be no shops or
  hotels&mdash;as lord of the manor you will see to that. We will have red
  roofs to all the houses as well. You will forgive my dwelling so long on the
  sordid side of the question; but I wish to impress upon you the fact that
  your fortune lies yonder, beyond the Common. That fortune is assured; it is
  so certain that at this very moment I would give something like sixty
  thousand pounds for the land. You will be happy and comfortable here. There
  will be Castleraynes of The Towers for generations yet. And all this because
  of the cult of the little white ball! People say there is no romance in
  business. I have just given a practical demonstration to the contrary. In my
  way I am a philanthropist, for I have promised one of our lovely spots to the
  people for ever, and at the same time I have extorted a fortune from it. And
  this is the great secret unfolded at last. Let us drink properly to the
  Castlerayne Common Golf-Links.'</p>

  <p>There was silence for a little time, a reflective silence that was
  soothing. Then Miss Castlerayne rose suddenly and gave the signal for
  departure. Her heart was full of happiness; but she saw little of the faces
  of the others, for her eyes were dimmed in tears.</p>

  <p class="first">The restoration of the Dower-House had been finished some
  time; Angela had been most interested in the furnishing of it. It had been a
  costly proceeding; but Warrener would not hear of anything but old oak there.
  He was justified in his extravagance, he said, by the fact that the club
  membership had filled in six weeks after the first of Raymond Brooke's
  glowing paragraphs in the press. The great gods of the game had been hurried
  down there to play matches, and the salt of the earth had gone away
  enthusiastic. Everybody, except the forty odd million who sat in the desolate
  darkness beyond the bunkers, was talking of the wonderful Castlerayne Links.
  The winter visitors from Hardborough had been over in shoals. There had been
  no trouble with the railway company; and all this blessed result for the
  simple reason that one of the Warreners had broken away from the old
  traditions and had gone into trade! Already, though not quite six months had
  elapsed, the roads in the new estate were made, and people were tumbling over
  one another to get the precious land. Castlerayne's bankers took off their
  hats to him. He was invited to the manager's room when he called. As to the
  rest, he trusted implicitly to Warrener's advice. He was even beginning to
  learn the advantage and value of paying ready money for everything.</p>

  <p>March was gone and sly April was at hand. The warm breath of spring came
  over the Common, where solemn men in red coats marched. There was no longer
  any distress or any calls for occupation at Castlerayne; the golf-links took
  all the casual labour that was to be had. A telephone line to Hardborough
  ministered to the natural comforts of the players.</p>

  <p>Nothing had been forgotten. Warrener was explaining all these things to
  Angela. They had just been playing a round together. Angela had deemed it
  base ingratitude not to take an interest in this wonderful game that had so
  altered the face of the family fortunes. She was a very different Angela in
  these days, too; all her old haughtiness had gone. She began to be mildly
  amazed at her own growing popularity. Latterly she had won Craggs's approval,
  and after that there was nothing to strive for.</p>

  <p>'We've gotten our own,' Craggs had said. 'There's a hospital now that is a
  hospital and not a hollow sham. And the land's been turned to the best
  advantage without harm to anybody. Our income comes from the soil, and the
  soil is none the worse for it. Also, there is occupation for everybody. A
  little more of this kind of thing, and they'll come back to the land fast
  enough. It is a fine thing that Mr. Warrener and myself have brought the
  squire to his senses.'</p>

  <p>'It was very good of you, Craggs,' Angela said humbly. 'You always did
  your best. I dare say you will come to forgive me in time.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, <i>you'll</i> be all right enough when once you are married,' Craggs
  declared. 'Mr. Warrener will see to <i>that</i>. I always said as what you
  needed was a masterful man, and you've got him. Not as anybody's told me as
  you be going to marry Mr. Warrener; my old spectacles ain't so old as they
  can't see <i>that</i> coming this long time.'</p>

  <p>Angela beat a hasty retreat. She was terribly afraid of the old man and
  his tongue. Time was when she would have resented a speech like that; but the
  spring was in her veins, and she was at peace with all the world, and
  Clifford loved her.</p>

  <p>'There is one thing about golf, Clifford,' she said. She flung herself
  down recklessly on a sand-dune and took off her hat so that the breeze could
  play over her forehead. 'I am quite certain that it is good discipline for
  the temper. I am the better for playing it. Don't you think that I have a
  better temper than I used to have?'</p>

  <p>'I am quite certain of it, sweetheart,' Clifford replied. 'But don't you
  think that the sense of prosperity has something to do with it as well? There
  is nothing that sours the disposition like poverty, especially the poverty
  that oppresses the fallen family. I ought to know, for I saw enough of it in
  my childhood. Which reminds me I have been terribly neglectful of my
  obligations lately. I have practically lived here all this winter. I have my
  own people and my own obligations to think of. I want you to come and share
  them all first, Angela. I want you to come down to my village and make
  friends with the workers there. I am anxious to introduce them to my
  wife.'</p>

  <p>Angela's reply was probably suitable, for Clifford caught her in his arms
  and kissed her. There was an obliging dip in the sand-dune that hid them from
  view.</p>

  <p>'Then let it be soon,' Warrener said. 'We can work all the rest of the
  year, and come back in the summer to Castlerayne. I shall build a house here,
  and I know that Brooke is going to do the same. Brooke told me last night
  that May&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I know,' Angela laughed. 'They are going to be married in June. And as I
  am the elder sister, I am not at all disposed to let my junior assume
  matronly airs before me; and that being the case, Clifford dearest, I shall
  be quite ready to&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>There was no need to say any more. May and Brooke found them presently,
  and they went back to The Towers to luncheon together. They were going to
  tell Aunt Gertrude, but there was no occasion to do anything of the kind. By
  some instinct, Aunt Gertrude seemed to know. She kissed them all in the most
  natural way in the world.</p>

  <p>'I know exactly what you are going to say,' she said. 'Don't tell me that
  I am crying, because I know that perfectly well, my dears. It is only because
  I am so very, very happy. I seem to have found a romance in my old age. I am
  living again in your happiness. And everything has happened in such a strange
  and wonderful way. I can't quite grasp it yet. Do come in and have luncheon,
  and try and keep me sensible. I hope you are not getting married before June,
  as I shall never have finished knitting those silk shirts that I had
  intended&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>They all laughed together as they trooped into the dining-room. It was a
  tradition in the family that although Aunt Gertrude was always knitting she
  never finished anything.</p>

  <p>Angela threw her arms round the elderly lady's neck and kissed her. 'We
  are very, very fortunate,' she said. 'But out of all our good fortunes, the
  greatest that ever happened to us was the kindly fate that gave us and kept
  for us our aunt Gertrude.'</p>
