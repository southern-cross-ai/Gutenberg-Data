<h2>MISS LONELYHEARTS, HELP ME, HELP ME</h2>

<p>The Miss Lonelyhearts of The New York <i>Post-Dispatch</i>
(Are-you-in-trouble?
--Do-you-need-advice?--Write-to-Miss-Lonelyhearts-and-she-will-help-you)
sat at his desk and stared at a piece of white cardboard. On it a
prayer had been printed by Shrike, the feature editor.</p>

<pre>
<i>"Soul of Miss L, glorify me.
Body of Miss L, nourish me
Blood of Miss L, intoxicate me.
Tears of Miss L, wash me.
Oh good Miss L, excuse my plea,
And hide me in your heart,
And defend me from mine enemies.
Help me, Miss L, help me, help me.
In saecula saeculorum. Amen."</i>
</pre>

<p>Although the deadline was less than a quarter of an hour away,
he was still working on his leader. He had gone as far as: "Life
<i>is</i> worth while, for it is full of dreams and peace,
gentleness and ecstasy, and faith that burns like a clear white
flame on a grim dark altar." But he found it impossible to
continue. The letters were no longer funny. He could not go on
finding the same joke funny thirty times a day for months on end.
And on most days he received more than thirty letters, all of
them alike, stamped from the dough of suffering with a
heart-shaped cookie knife.</p>

<p>On his desk were piled those he had received this morning. He
started through them again, searching for some clue to a sincere
answer.</p>

<p><i>Dear Miss Lonelyhearts--</i></p>

<p><i>I am in such pain I dont know what to do sometimes I think
I will kill myself my kidneys hurt so much. My husband thinks no
woman can be a good catholic and not have children irregardless
of the pain. I was married honorable from our church but I never
knew what married life meant as I never was told about man and
wife. My grandmother never told me and she was the only mother I
had but made a big mistake by not telling me as it dont pay to be
innocent and is only a big disappointment. I have 7 children in
12 yrs and ever since the last 2 I have been so sick. I was
operated on twice and my husband promised no more children on the
doctors advice as he said I might die but when I got back from
the hospital he broke his promise and now I am going to have a
baby and I dont think I can stand it my kidneys hurt so much. I
am so sick and scared because I cant have an abortion on account
of being a catholic and my husband so religious. I cry all the
time it hurts so much and I dont know what to do.</i></p>

<p><i>Yours respectfully,</i></p>

<p><i>Sick-of-it-all</i></p>

<p>Miss Lonelyhearts threw the letter into an open drawer and lit
a cigarette.</p>

<p><i>Dear Miss Lonelyhearts--</i></p>

<p><i>I am sixteen years old now and I dont know what to do and
would appreciate it if you could tell me what to do. When I was a
little girl it was not so bad because I got used to the kids on
the block makeing fun of me, but now I would like to have boy
friends like the other girls and go out on Saturday nites, but no
boy will take me because I was born without a nose--although I am
a good dancer and have a nice shape and my father buys me pretty
clothes.</i></p>

<p><i>I sit and look at myself all day and cry. I have a big hole
in the middle of my face that scares people even myself so I cant
blame the boys for not wanting to take me out. My mother loves
me, but she crys terrible when she looks at me.</i></p>

<p><i>What did I do to deserve such a terrible bad fate? Even if
I did do some bad things I didnt do any before I was a year old
and I was born this way. I asked Papa and he says he doesnt know,
but that maybe I did something in the other world before I was
born or that maybe I was being punished for his sins. I dont
believe that because he is a very nice man. Ought I commit
suicide?</i></p>

<p><i>Sincerely yours,</i></p>

<p><i>Desperate</i></p>

<p>The cigarette was imperfect and refused to draw. Miss
Lonelyhearts took it out of his mouth and stared at it furiously.
He fought himself quiet, then lit another one.</p>

<p><i>Dear Miss Lonelyhearts--</i></p>

<p><i>I am writing to you for my little sister Grade because
something awfull hapened to her, and I am afraid to tell mother
about it. I am 15 years old and Gracie is 13 and we live in
Brooklyn. Gracie is deaf and dumb and biger than me but not very
smart on account of being deaf and dumb. She plays on the roof of
our house and dont go to school except to deaf and dumb school
twice a week on tuesdays and thursdays. Mother makes her play on
the roof because we dont want her to get run over as she aint
very smart. Last week a man came on the roof and did something
dirty to her. She told me about it and I dont know what to do as
I am afraid to tell mother on account of her being liable to beat
Grade up. I am afraid that Gracie is going to have a baby and I
listened to her stomack last night for a long time to see if I
could hear the baby but I couldn't. If I tell mother she will
beat Gracie up awfull because I am the only one who loves her and
last time when she tore her dress they Joked her in the closet
for 2 days and if the boys on the blok hear about it they will
say dirty things like they did on Peewee Conors sister the time
she got caught in the lots. So please what would you do if the
same hapened in your family.</i></p>

<p><i>Yours truly,</i></p>

<p><i>Harold S.</i></p>

<p>He stopped reading. Christ was the answer, but, if he did not
want to get sick, he had to stay away from the Christ business.
Besides, Christ was Shrike's particular joke. "Soul of Miss L,
glorify me. Body of Miss L, save me. Blood of..." He turned to
his typewriter.</p>

<p>Although his cheap clothes had too much style, he still looked
like the son of a Baptist minister. A beard would become him,
would accent his Old-Testament look. But even without a beard no
one could fail to recognize the New England puritan. His forehead
was high and narrow. His nose was long and fleshless. His bony
chin was shaped and cleft like a hoof. On seeing him for the
first time, Shrike had smiled and said, "The Susan Chesters, the
Beatrice Fairfaxes and the Miss Lonelyhearts are the priests of
twentieth-century America."</p>

<p>A copy boy came up to tell him that Shrike wanted to know if
the stuff was ready. He bent over the typewriter and began
pounding its keys.</p>

<p>But before he had written a dozen words, Shrike leaned over
his shoulder. "The same old stuff," Shrike said. "Why don't you
give them something new and hopeful? Tell them about art. Here,
I'll dictate:</p>

<p>"<i>Art Is a Way Out.</i></p>

<p>"Do not let life overwhelm you. When the old paths are choked
with the debris of failure, look for newer and fresher paths. Art
is just such a path. Art is distilled from suffering. As Mr.
Polnikoff exclaimed through his fine Russian beard, when, at the
age of eighty-six, he gave up his business to learn Chinese, 'We
are, as yet, only at the beginning...</p>

<p>"<i>Art Is One of Life's Richest Offerings.</i></p>

<p>"For those who have not the talent to create, there is
appreciation. For those...</p>

<p>"Go on from there."</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>MISS LONELYHEARTS AND THE DEAD PAN</h2>

<p>When Miss Lonelyhearts quit work, he found that the weather
had turned warm and that the air smelt as though it had been
artificially heated. He decided to walk to Delehanty's speakeasy
for a drink. In order to get there, it was necessary to cross a
little park.</p>

<p>He entered the park at the North Gate and swallowed mouthfuls
of the heavy shade that curtained its arch. He walked into the
shadow of a lamp-post that lay on the path like a spear. It
pierced him like a spear.</p>

<p>As far as he could discover, there were no signs of spring.
The decay that covered the surface of the mottled ground was not
the kind in which life generates. Last year, he remembered, May
had failed to quicken these soiled fields. It had taken all the
brutality of July to torture a few green spikes through the
exhausted dirt.</p>

<p>What the little park needed, even more than he did, was a
drink. Neither alcohol nor rain would do. To-morrow, in his
column, he would ask Broken-hearted, Sick-of-it-all, Desperate,
Disillusioned-with-tubercular-husband and the rest of his
correspondents to come here and water the soil with their tears.
Flowers would then spring up, flowers that smelled of feet.</p>

<p>"Ah, humanity..." But he was heavy with shadow and the joke
went into a dying fall. He tried to break its fall by laughing at
himself.</p>

<p>Why laugh at himself, however, when Shrike was waiting at the
speakeasy to do a much better job? "Miss Lonelyhearts, my friend,
I advise you to give your readers stones. When they ask for bread
don't give them crackers as does the Church, and don't, like the
State, tell them to eat cake. Explain that man cannot live by
bread alone and give them stones. Teach them to pray each
morning: `Give us this day our daily stone.'"</p>

<p>He had given his readers many stones; so many, in fact, that
he had only one left--the stone that had formed in his gut.</p>

<p>Suddenly tired, he sat down on a bench. If he could only throw
the stone. He searched the sky for a target. But the gray sky
looked as if it had been rubbed with a soiled eraser. It held no
angels, flaming crosses, olive-bearing doves, wheels within
wheels. Only a newspaper struggled in the air like a kite with a
broken spine. He got up and started again for the speakeasy.</p>

<p>Delehanty's was in the cellar of a brownstone house that
differed from its more respectable neighbors by having an armored
door. He pressed a concealed button and a little round window
opened in its center. A blood-shot eye appeared, glowing like a
ruby in an antique iron ring.</p>

<p>The bar was only half full. Miss Lonelyhearts looked around
apprehensively for Shrike and was relieved at not finding him.
However, after a third drink, just as he was settling into the
warm mud of alcoholic gloom, Shrike caught his arm.</p>

<p>"Ah, my young friend!" he shouted. "How do I find you?
Brooding again, I take it."</p>

<p>"For Christ's sake, shut up."</p>

<p>Shrike ignored the interruption. "You're morbid, my friend,
morbid. Forget the crucifixion, remember the renaissance. There
were no brooders then." He raised his glass, and the whole Borgia
family was in his gesture. "I give you the renaissance. What a
period! What pageantry! Drunken popes...Beautiful
courtesans...Illegitimate children..."</p>

<p>Although his gestures were elaborate, his face was blank. He
practiced a trick used much by moving-picture comedians--the dead
pan. No matter how fantastic or excited his speech, he never
changed his expression. Under the shining white globe of his
brow, his features huddled together in a dead, gray triangle.</p>

<p>"To the renaissance!" he kept shouting. "To the renaissance!
To the brown Greek manuscripts and mistresses with the great
smooth marbly limbs...But that reminds me, I'm expecting one of
my admirers--a cow-eyed girl of great <i>intelligence</i>." He
illustrated the word intelligence by carving two enormous breasts
in the air with his hands. "She works in a book store, but wait
until you see her behind."</p>

<p>Miss Lonelyhearts made the mistake of showing his
annoyance.</p>

<p>"Oh, so you don't care for women, eh? J. C. is your only
sweetheart, eh? Jesus Christ, the King of Kings, the Miss
Lonelyhearts of Miss Lonelyhearts..."</p>

<p>At this moment, fortunately for Miss Lonelyhearts, the young
woman expected by Shrike came up to the bar. She had long legs,
thick ankles, big hands, a powerful body, a slender neck and a
childish face made tiny by a man's haircut.</p>

<p>"Miss Farkis," Shrike said, making her bow as a ventriloquist
does his doll, "Miss Farkis, I want you to meet Miss
Lonelyhearts. Show him the same respect you show me. He, too, is
a comforter of the poor in spirit and a lover of God."</p>

<p>She acknowledged the introduction with a masculine
handshake.</p>

<p>"Miss Farkis," Shrike said, "Miss Farkis works in a book store
and writes on the side." He patted her rump.</p>

<p>"What were you talking about so excitedly?" she asked.
"Religion."</p>

<p>"Get me a drink and please continue. I'm very much interested
in the new thomistic synthesis."</p>

<p>This was just the kind of remark for which Shrike was waiting.
"St. Thomas!" he shouted. "What do you take us for--stinking
intellectuals? We're not fake Europeans. We were discussing
Christ, the Miss Lonelyhearts of Miss Lonelyhearts. America has
her own religions. If you need a synthesis, here is the kind of
material to use." He took a clipping from his wallet and slapped
it on the bar.</p>

<p>"ADDING MACHINE USED IN RITUAL OF WESTERN SECT...<i>Figures
Will be Used for Prayers for Condemned Slayer of Aged
Recluse</i>...DENVER, COLO., Feb. 2 ( A. P.) Frank H. Rice,
Supreme Pontiff of the Liberal Church of America has announced he
will carry out his plan for a 'goat and adding machine' ritual
for William Moya, condemned slayer, despite objection to his
program by a Cardinal of the sect. Rice declared the goat would
be used as part of a 'sack cloth and ashes' service shortly
before and after Moya's execution, set for the week of June 20.
Prayers for the condemned man's soul will be offered on an adding
machine. Numbers, he explained, constitute the only universal
language. Moya killed Joseph Zemp, an aged recluse, in an
argument over a small amount of money."</p>

<p>Miss Farkis laughed and Shrike raised his fist as though to
strike her. His actions shocked the bartender, who hurriedly
asked them to go into the back room. Miss Lonelyhearts did not
want to go along, but Shrike insisted and he was too tired to
argue.</p>

<p>They seated themselves at a table inside one of the booths.
Shrike again raised his fist, but when Miss Farkis drew back, he
changed the gesture to a caress. The trick worked. She gave in to
his hand until he became too daring, then pushed him away.</p>

<p>Shrike again began to shout and this time Miss Lonelyhearts
understood that he was making a seduction speech.</p>

<p>"I am a great saint," Shrike cried, "I can walk on my own
water. Haven't you ever heard of Shrike's Passion in the
Luncheonette, or the Agony in the Soda Fountain? Then I compared
the wounds in Christ's body to the mouths of a miraculous purse
in which we deposit the small change of our sins. It is indeed an
excellent conceit. But now let us consider the holes in our own
bodies and into what these congenital wounds open. Under the skin
of man is a wondrous jungle where veins like lush tropical
growths hang along overripe organs and weed-like entrails writhe
in squirming tangles of red and yellow. In this jungle, flitting
from rock-gray lungs to golden intestines, from liver to lights
and back to liver again, lives a bird called the soul. The
Catholic hunts this bird with bread and wine, the Hebrew with a
golden ruler, the Protestant on leaden feet with leaden words,
the Buddhist with gestures, the Negro with blood. I spit on them
all. Phoohl And I call upon you to spit. Phoohl Do you stuff
birds? No, my dears, taxidermy is not religion. No! A thousand
times no. Better, I say unto you, better a live bird in the
jungle of the body than two stuffed birds on the library
table."</p>

<p>His caresses kept pace with the sermon. When he had reached
the end, he buried his triangular face like the blade of a
hatchet in her neck.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>MISS LONELYHEARTS AND THE LAMB</h2>

Miss Lonelyhearts went home in a taxi. He lived by himself in a
room that was as full of shadows as an old steel engraving. It
held a bed, a table and two chairs. The walls were bare except
for an ivory Christ that hung opposite the foot of the bed. He
had removed the figure from the cross to which it had been
fastened and had nailed it to the wall with large spikes. But the
desired effect had not been obtained. Instead of writhing, the
Christ remained calmly decorative. 

<p>He got undressed immediately and took a cigarette and a copy
of The <i>Brothers Kalamazov</i> to bed. The marker was in a
chapter devoted to Father Zossima.</p>

<p>"Love a man even in his sin, for that is the semblance of
Divine Love and is the highest love on earth. Love all God's
creation, the whole and every grain of sand in it. Love the
animals, love the plants, love everything. If you love
everything, you will perceive the divine mystery in things. Once
you perceive it, you will begin to comprehend it better every
day. And you will come at last to love the whole world with an
all-embracing love."</p>

<p>It was excellent advice. If he followed it, he would be a big
success. His column would be syndicated and the whole world would
learn to love. The Kingdom of Heaven would arrive. He would sit
on the right hand of the Lamb.</p>

<p>But seriously, he realized, even if Shrike had not made a sane
view of this Christ business impossible, there would be little
use in his fooling himself. His vocation was of a different sort.
As a boy in his father's church, he had discovered that something
stirred in him when he shouted the name of Christ, something
secret and enormously powerful. He had played with this thing,
but had never allowed it to come alive.</p>

<p>He knew now what this thing was--hysteria, a snake whose
scales are tiny mirrors in which the dead world takes on a
semblance of life. And how dead the world is...a world of
doorknobs. He wondered if hysteria were really too steep a price
to pay for bringing it to life.</p>

<p>For him, Christ was the most natural of excitements. Fixing
his eyes on the image that hung on the wall, he began to chant:
"Christ, Christ, Jesus Christ. Christ, Christ, Jesus Christ." But
the moment the snake started to uncoil in his brain, he became
frightened and closed his eyes.</p>

<p>With sleep, a dream came in which he found himself on the
stage of a crowded theater. He was a magician who did tricks with
doorknobs. At his command, they bled, flowered, spoke. After his
act was finished, he tried to lead his audience in prayer. But no
matter how hard he struggled, his prayer was one Shrike had
taught him and his voice was that of a conductor calling
stations.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord, we are not of those who wash in wine, water, urine,
vinegar, fire, oil, bay rum, milk, brandy, or boric acid. Oh,
Lord, we are of those who wash solely in the Blood of the
Lamb."</p>

<p>The scene of the dream changed. He found himself in his
college dormitory. With him were Steve Garvey and Jud Hume. They
had been arguing the existence of God from midnight until dawn,
and now, having run out of whisky, they decided to go to the
market for some applejack.</p>

<p>Their way led through the streets of the sleeping town into
the open fields beyond. It was spring. The sun and the smell of
vegetable birth renewed their drunkenness and they reeled between
the loaded carts. The farmers took their horseplay
good-naturedly. Boys from the college on a spree.</p>

<p>They found the bootlegger and bought a gallon jug of
applejack, then wandered to the section where livestock was sold.
They stopped to fool with some lambs. Jud suggested buying one to
roast over a fire in the woods. Miss Lonelyhearts agreed, but on
the condition that they sacrifice it to God before barbecuing
it.</p>

<p>Steve was sent to the cutlery stand for a butcher knife, while
the other two remained to bargain for a lamb. After a long,
Armenian-like argument, during which Jud exhibited his farm
training, the youngest was selected, a little, stiff-legged
thing, all head.</p>

<p>They paraded the lamb through the market. Miss Lonelyhearts
went first, carrying the knife, the others followed, Steve with
the jug and Jud with the animal. As they marched, they sang an
obscene version of "Mary Had a Little Lamb."</p>

<p>Between the market and the bill on which they intended to
perform the sacrifice was a meadow. While going through it, they,
picked daisies and buttercups. Halfway up the hill, they found a
rock and covered it with the flowers. They laid the lamb among
the flowers. Miss Lonely-hearts was elected priest, with Steve
and Jud as his attendants. While they held the lamb, Miss
Lonelyhearts crouched over it and began to chant.</p>

<p>"Christ, Christ, Jesus Christ. Christ, Christ, Jesus
Christ."</p>

<p>When they had worked themselves into a frenzy, he brought the
knife down hard. The blow was inaccurate and made a flesh wound.
He raised the knife again and this time the lamb's violent
struggles made him miss altogether. The knife broke on the altar.
Steve and Jud pulled the animal's head back for him to saw at its
throat, but only a small piece of blade remained in the handle
and he was unable to cut through the matted wool.</p>

<p>Their hands were covered with slimy blood and the lamb slipped
free. It crawled off into the underbrush.</p>

<p>As the bright sun outlined the altar rock with narrow shadows,
the scene appeared to gather itself for some new violence. They
bolted. Down the hill they fled until they reached the meadow,
where they fell exhausted in the tall grass.</p>

<p>After some time had passed, Miss Lonelyhearts begged them to
go back and put the lamb out of its misery. They refused to go.
He went back alone and found it under a bush. He crushed its head
with a stone and left the carcass to the flies that swarmed
around the bloody altar flowers.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>MISS LONELYHEARTS AND THE FAT THUMB</h2>

<p>Miss Lonelyhearts found himself developing an almost insane
sensitiveness to order. Everything had to form a pattern: the
shoes under the bed, the ties in the holder, the pencils on the
table. When he looked out of a window, he composed the skyline by
balancing one building against another. If a bird flew across
this arrangement, he closed his eyes angrily until it was
gone.</p>

<p>For a little while, he seemed to hold his own but one day he
found himself with his back to the wall. On that day all the
inanimate things over which he had tried to obtain control took
the field against him. When he touched something, it spilled or
rolled to the floor. The collar buttons disappeared under the
bed, the point of the pencil broke, the handle of the razor fell
off, the window shade refused to stay down. He fought back, but
with too much violence, and was decisively defeated by the spring
of the alarm clock.</p>

<p>He fled to the street, but there chaos was multiple. Broken
groups of people hurried past, forming neither stars nor squares.
The lamp-posts were badly spaced and the flagging was of
different sizes. Nor could he do anything with the harsh clanging
sound of street cars and the raw shouts of hucksters. No repeated
group of words would fit their rhythm and no scale could give
them meaning.</p>

<p>He stood quietly against a wall, trying not to see or hear.
Then he remembered Betty. She had often made him feel that when
she straightened his tie, she straightened much more. And he had
once thought that if her world were larger, were the world, she
might order it as finally as the objects on her dressing
table.</p>

<p>He gave Betty's address to a cab driver and told him to hurry.
But she lived on the other side of the city and by the time he
got there, his panic had turned to irritation.</p>

<p>She came to the door of her apartment in a crisp, white linen
dressing-robe that yellowed into brown at the edges. She held out
both her hands to him and her arms showed round and smooth like
wood that has been turned by the sea.</p>

<p>With the return of self-consciousness, he knew that only
violence could make him supple. It was Betty, however, that he
criticized. Her world was not the world and could never include
the readers of his column. Her sureness was based on the power to
limit experience arbitrarily. Moreover, his confusion was
significant, while her order was not.</p>

<p>He tried to reply to her greeting and discovered that his
tongue had become a fat thumb. To avoid talking, he awkwardly
forced a kiss, then found it necessary to apologize.</p>

<p>"Too much lover's return business, I know, and I..." he
stumbled purposely, so that she would take his confusion for
honest feeling. But the trick failed and she waited for him to
continue:</p>

<p>"Please eat dinner with me."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't."</p>

<p>Her smile opened into a laugh.</p>

<p>She was laughing at him. On the defense, he examined her laugh
for "bitterness," "sour-grapes," "a-broken-heart," "the
devil-may-care." But to his confusion, he found nothing at which
to laugh back. Her smile had opened naturally, not like an
umbrella, and while he watched her laugh folded and became a
smile again, a smile that was neither "wry," "ironical" nor
"mysterious."</p>

<p>As they moved into the living-room, his irritation increased.
She sat down on a studio couch with her bare legs under and her
back straight. Behind her a silver tree flowered in the lemon
wall-paper. He remained standing.</p>

<p>"Betty the Buddha," he said. "Betty the Buddha. You have the
smug smile; all you need is the pot belly."</p>

<p>His voice was so full of hatred that he himself was surprised.
He fidgeted for a while in silence and finally sat down beside
her on the couch to take her hand.</p>

<p>More than two months had passed since he had sat with her on
this same couch and had asked her to marry him. Then she had
accepted him and they had planned their life after marriage, his
job and her gingham apron, his slippers beside the fireplace and
her ability to cook. He had avoided her since. He did not feel
guilty; he was merely annoyed at having been fooled into thinking
that such a solution was possible.</p>

<p>He soon grew tired of holding hands and began to fidget again.
He remembered that towards the end of his last visit he had put
his hand inside her clothes. Unable to think of anything else to
do, he now repeated the gesture. She was naked under her robe and
he found her breast.</p>

<p>She made no sign to show that she was aware of his hand. He
would have welcomed a slap, but even when he caught at her
nipple, she remained silent.</p>

<p>"Let me pluck this rose," he said, giving a sharp tug. "I want
to wear it in my buttonhole."</p>

<p>Betty reached for his brow. "What's the matter?" she asked.
"Are you sick?"</p>

<p>He began to shout at her, accompanying his shouts with
gestures that were too appropriate, like those of an
old-fashioned actor.</p>

<p>"What a kind bitch you are. As soon as any one acts viciously,
you say he's sick. Wife-torturers, rapers of small children,
according to you they're all sick. No morality, only medicine.
Well, I'm not sick. I don't need any of your damned aspirin. I've
got a Christ complex. Humanity...I'm a humanity lover. All the
broken bastards..." He finished with a short laugh that was like
a bark.</p>

<p>She had left the couch for a red chair that was swollen with
padding and tense with live springs. In the lap of this leather
monster, all trace of the serene Buddha disappeared.</p>

<p>But his anger was not appeased. "What's the matter,
sweetheart?" he asked, patting her shoulder threateningly.
"Didn't you like the performance?"</p>

<p>Instead of answering, she raised her arm as though to ward off
a blow. She was like a kitten whose soft helplessness makes one
ache to hurt it.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he demanded over and over again. "What's
the matter? What's the matter?"</p>

<p>Her face took on the expression of an inexperienced gambler
about to venture all on a last throw. He was turning for his hat,
when she spoke.</p>

<p>"I love you."</p>

<p>"You what?"</p>

<p>The need for repeating flustered her, yet she managed to keep
her manner undramatic.</p>

<p>"I love you."</p>

<p>"And I love you," he said. "You and your damned smiling
through tears."</p>

<p>"Why don't you let me alone?" She had begun to cry. "I felt
swell before you came, and now I feel lousy. Go away. Please go
away."</p>

<h2>MISS LONELYHEARTS AND THE CLEAN OLD MAN</h2>

<p>In the street again, Miss Lonelyhearts wondered what to do
next. He was too excited to eat and afraid to go home. He felt as
though his heart were a bomb, a complicated bomb that would
result in a simple explosion, wrecking the world without rocking
it.</p>

<p>He decided to go to Delehanty's for a drink. In the speakeasy,
he discovered a group of his friends at the bar. They greeted him
and went on talking. One of them was complaining about the number
of female writers.</p>

<p>"And they've all got three names," he said. "Mary Roberts
Wilcox, Ella Wheeler Catheter, Ford Mary Rinehart..."</p>

<p>Then some one started a train of stories by suggesting that
what they all needed was a good rape.</p>

<p>"I knew a gal who was regular until she fell in with a group
and went literary. She began writing for the little magazines
about how much Beauty hurt her and ditched the boy friend who set
up pins in a bowling alley. The guys on the block got sore and
took her into the lots one night. About eight of them. They
ganged her proper..."</p>

<p>"That's like the one they tell about another female writer.
When this hard-boiled stuff first came in, she dropped the trick
English accent and went in for scram and lam. She got to hanging
around with a lot of mugs in a speak, gathering material for a
novel. Well, the mugs didn't know they were picturesque and
thought she was regular until the barkeep put them wise. They got
her into the back room to teach her a new word and put the boots
to her. They didn't let her out for three days. On the last day
they sold tickets to niggers..."</p>

<p>Miss Lonelyhearts stopped listening. His friends would go on
telling these stories until they were too drunk to talk. They
were aware of their childishness, but did not know how else to
revenge themselves. At college, and perhaps for a year
afterwards, they had believed in literature, had believed in
Beauty and in personal expression as an absolute end. When they
lost this belief, they lost everything. Money and fame meant
nothing to them. They were not worldly men.</p>

<p>Miss Lonelyhearts drank steadily. He was smiling an innocent,
amused smile, the smile of an anarchist sitting in the movies
with a bomb in his pocket. If the people around him only knew
what was in his pocket. In a little while he would leave to kill
the President.</p>

<p>Not until he heard his own name mentioned did he stop smiling
and again begin to listen.</p>

<p>"He's a leper licker. Shrike says he wants to lick lepers.
Barkeep, a leper for the gent."</p>

<p>"If you haven't got a leper, give him a Hungarian."</p>

<p>"Well, that's the trouble with his approach to God. It's too
damn literary--plain song, Latin poetry, medieval painting,
Huysmans, stained-glass windows and crap like that."</p>

<p>"Even if he were to have a genuine religious experience, it
would be personal and so meaningless, except to a
psychologist."</p>

<p>"The trouble with him, the trouble with all of us, is that we
have no outer life, only an inner one, and that by
necessity."</p>

<p>"He's an escapist. He wants to cultivate his interior garden.
But you can't escape, and where is he going to find a market for
the fruits of his personality? The Farm Board is a failure."</p>

<p>"What I say is, after all one has to earn a living. We can't
all believe in Christ, and what does the farmer care about art?
He takes his shoes off to get the warm feel of the rich earth
between his toes. You can't take your shoes off in church."</p>

<p>Miss Lonelyhearts had again begun to smile. Like Shrike, the
man they imitated, they were machines for making jokes. A button
machine makes buttons, no matter what the power used, foot, steam
or electricity. They, no matter what the motivating force, death,
love or God, made jokes.</p>

<p>"Was their nonsense the only barrier?" he asked himself. "Had
he been thwarted by such a low hurdle?"</p>

<p>The whisky was good and he felt warm and sure. Through the
light-blue tobacco smoke, the mahogany bar shone like wet gold.
The glasses and bottles, their high lights exploding, rang like a
battery of little bells when the bartender touched them together.
He forgot that his heart was a bomb to remember an incident of
his childhood. One winter evening, he had been waiting with his
little sister for their father to come home from church. She was
eight years old then, and he was twelve. Made sad by the pause
between playing and eating, he had gone to the piano and had
begun a piece by Mozart. It was the first time he had ever
voluntarily gone to the piano. His sister left her picture book
to dance to his music. She had never danced before. She danced
gravely and carefully, a simple dance yet formal...As Miss
Lonelyhearts stood at the bar, swaying slightly to the remembered
music, he thought of children dancing. Square replacing oblong
and being replaced by circle. Every child, everywhere; in the
whole world there was not one child who was not gravely, sweetly
dancing.</p>

<p>He stepped away from the bar and accidentally collided with a
man holding a glass of beer. When he turned to beg the man's
pardon, he received a punch in the mouth. Later he found himself
at a table in the back room, playing with a loose tooth. He
wondered why his hat did not fit and discovered a lump on the
back of his head. He must have fallen. The hurdle was higher than
he had thought.</p>

<p>His anger swung in large drunken circles. What in Christ's
name was this Christ business? And children gravely dancing? He
would ask Shrike to be transferred to the sports department.</p>

<p>Ned Gates came in to see how he was getting along and
suggested the fresh air: Gates was also very drunk. When they
left the speakeasy together, they found that it was snowing.</p>

<p>Miss Lonelyhearts' anger grew cold and sodden like the snow.
He and his companion staggered along with their heads down,
turning corners at random, until they found themselves in front
of the little park. A light was burning in the comfort station
and they went in to warm up.</p>

<p>An old man was sitting on one of the toilets. The door of his
booth was propped open and he was sitting on the turned-down
toilet cover.</p>

<p>Gates hailed him. "Well, well, smug as a bug in a rug,
eh?"</p>

<p>The old man jumped with fright, but finally managed to speak.
"What do you want? Please let me alone." His voice was like a
flute; it did not vibrate.</p>

<p>"If you can't get a woman, get a clean old man," Gates
sang.</p>

<p>The old man looked as if he were going to cry, but suddenly
laughed instead. A terrible cough started under his laugh, and
catching at the bottom of his lungs, it ripped into his throat.
He turned away to wipe his mouth.</p>

<p>Miss Lonelyhearts tried to get Gates to leave, but he refused
to go without the old man. They both grabbed him and pulled him
out of the stall and through the door of the comfort station. He
went soft in their arms and started to giggle. Miss Lonelyhearts
fought off a desire to hit him.</p>

<p>The snow had stopped falling and it had grown very cold. The
old man did not have an overcoat, but said that he found the cold
exhilarating. He carried a cane and wore gloves because, as he
said, he detested red hands.</p>

<p>Instead of going back to Delehanty's they went to an Italian
cellar close by the park. The old man tried to get them to drink
coffee, but they told him to mind his own business and drank rye.
The whisky burned Miss Lonely-hearts' cut lip.</p>

<p>Gates was annoyed by the old man's elaborate manners. "Listen,
you," he said, "cut out the gentlemanly stuff and tell us the
story of your life."</p>

<p>The old man drew himself up like a little girl making a
muscle.</p>

<p>"Aw, come off," Gates said. "We're scientists. He's Havelock
Ellis and I'm Krafft-Ebing. When did you first discover
homosexualistic tendencies in yourself?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean, sir? I..."</p>

<p>"Yeh, I know, but how about your difference from other
men?"</p>

<p>"How dare you..." He gave a little scream of indignation.</p>

<p>"Now, now," Miss Lonelyhearts said, "he didn't mean to insult
you. Scientists have terribly bad manners...But you are a
pervert, aren't you?"</p>

<p>The old man raised his cane to strike him. Gates grabbed it
from behind and wrenched it out of his hand. He began to cough
violently and held his black satin tie to his mouth. Still
coughing he dragged himself to a chair in the back of the
room.</p>

<p>Miss Lonelyhearts felt as he had felt years before, when he
had accidentally stepped on a small frog. Its spilled guts had
filled him with pity, but when its suffering had become real to
his senses, his pity had turned to rage and he had beaten it
frantically until it was dead.</p>

<p>"I'll get the bastard's life story," he shouted, and started
after him. Gates followed laughing.</p>

<p>At their approach, the old man jumped to his feet. Miss
Lonelyhearts caught him and forced him back into his chair.</p>

<p>"We're psychologists," he said. "We want to help you. What's
your name?"</p>

<p>"George B. Simpson."</p>

<p>"What does the B stand for?"</p>

<p>"Bramhall."</p>

<p>"Your age, please, and the nature of your quest?" "By what
right do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Science gives me the right."</p>

<p>"Let's drop it," Gates said. "The old fag is going to cry."
"No, Krafft-Ebing, sentiment must never be permitted to interfere
with the probings of science."</p>

<p>Miss Lonelyhearts put his arm around the old man. "Tell us the
story of your life," he said, loading his voice with
sympathy.</p>

<p>"I have no story."</p>

<p>"You must have. Every one has a life story."</p>

<p>The old man began to sob.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, your tale is a sad one. Tell it, damn you, tell
it."</p>

<p>When the old man still remained silent, he took his arm and
twisted it. Gates tried to tear him away, but he refused to let
go. He was twisting the arm of all the sick and miserable, broken
and betrayed, inarticulate and impotent. He was twisting the arm
of Desperate, Brokenhearted, Sick-of-it-all,
Disillusioned-with-tubercular-husband.</p>

<p>The old man began to scream. Somebody hit Miss Lonelyhearts
from behind with a chair.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>MISS LONELYHEARTS AND MRS. SHRIKE</h2>

<p>Miss Lonelyhearts lay on his bed fully dressed, just as he had
been dumped the night before. His head ached and his thoughts
revolved inside the pain like a wheel within a wheel. When he
opened his eyes, the room, like a third wheel, revolved around
the pain in his head.</p>

<p>From where he lay he could see the alarm clock. It was half
past three. When the telephone rang, he crawled out of the sour
pile of bed clothes. Shrike wanted to know if he intended to show
up at the office. He answered that he was drunk but would try to
get there.</p>

<p>He undressed slowly and took a bath. The hot water made his
body feel good, but his heart remained a congealed lump of icy
fat. After drying himself, he found a little whisky in the
medicine chest and drank it. The alcohol warmed only the lining
of his stomach.</p>

<p>He shaved, put on a clean shirt and a freshly pressed suit and
went out to get something to eat. When he had finished his second
cup of scalding coffee, it was too late for him to go to work.
But he had nothing to worry about, for Shrike would never fire
him. He made too perfect a butt for Shrike's jokes. Once he had
tried to get fired by recommending suicide in his column. All
that Shrike had said was: "Remember, please, that your job is to
increase the circulation of our paper. Suicide, it is only
reasonable to think, must defeat this purpose."</p>

<p>He paid for his breakfast and left the cafeteria. Some
exercise might warm him. He decided to take a brisk walk, but he
soon grew tired and when he reached the little park, he slumped
down on a bench opposite the Mexican War obelisk.</p>

<p>The stone shaft cast a long, rigid shadow on the walk in front
of him. He sat staring at it without knowing why until he noticed
that it was lengthening in rapid jerks, not as shadows usually
lengthen. He grew frightened and looked up quickly at the
monument. It seemed red and swollen in the dying sun, as though
it were about to spout a load of granite seed.</p>

<p>He hurried away. When he had regained the street, he started
to laugh. Although he had tried hot water, whisky, coffee,
exercise, he had completely forgotten sex. What he really needed
was a woman. He laughed again, remembering that at college all
his friends had believed intercourse capable of steadying the
nerves, relaxing the muscles and clearing the blood.</p>

<p>But he knew only two women who would tolerate him. He had
spoiled his chances with Betty, so it would have to be Mary
Shrike.</p>

<p>When he kissed Shrike's wife, he felt less like a joke. She
returned his kisses because she hated Shrike. But even there
Shrike had beaten him. No matter how hard he begged her to give
Shrike horns, she refused to sleep with him.</p>

<p>Although Mary always grunted and upset her eyes, she would not
associate what she felt with the sexual act. When he forced this
association, she became very angry. He had been convinced that
her grunts were genuine by the change that took place in her when
he kissed her heavily. Then her body gave off an odour that
enriched the synthetic flower scent she used behind her ears and
in the hollows of her neck. No similar change ever took place in
his own body, however. Like a dead man, only friction could make
him warm or violence make him mobile.</p>

<p>He decided to get a few drinks and then call Mary from
Delehanty's. It was quite early and the speakeasy was empty. The
bartender served him and went back to his newspaper.</p>

<p>On the mirror, behind the bar hung a poster advertising a
mineral water. It showed a naked girl made modest by the mist
that rose from the spring at her feet. The artist had taken a
great deal of care in drawing her breasts and their nipples stuck
out like tiny red hats.</p>

<p>He tried to excite himself into eagerness by thinking of the
play Mary made with her breasts. She used them as the coquettes
of long ago had used their fans. One of her tricks was to wear a
medal low down on her chest. Whenever he asked to see it, instead
of drawing it out she leaned over for him to look. Although he
had often asked to see the medal, he had not yet found out what
it represented.</p>

<p>But the excitement refused to come. If anything, he felt
colder than before he had started to think of women. It was not
his line. Nevertheless, he persisted in it, out of desperation,
and went to the telephone to call Mary.</p>

<p>"Is that you?" she asked, then added before he could reply, "I
must see you at once. I've quarreled with him. This time I'm
through."</p>

<p>She always talked in headlines and her excitement forced him
to be casual. "O.K.," he said. "When? Where?"</p>

<p>"Anywhere, I'm through with that skunk, I tell you, I'm
through."</p>

<p>She had quarreled with Shrike before and he knew that in
return for an ordinary number of kisses, he would have to listen
to an extraordinary amount of complaining.</p>

<p>"Do you want to meet me here, in Delehanty's?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, you come here. We'll be alone and anyway I have to bathe
and get dressed."</p>

<p>When he arrived at her place, he would probably find Shrike
there with her on his lap. They would both be glad to see him and
all three of them would go to the movies where Mary would hold
his hand under the seat.</p>

<p>He went back to the bar for another drink, then bought a quart
of Scotch and took a cab. Shrike opened the door. Although he had
expected to see him, he was embarrassed and tried to cover his
confusion by making believe that he was extremely drunk.</p>

<p>"Come in, come in, homebreaker," Shrike said with a laugh.
"The Mrs. will be out in a few minutes. She's in the tub."</p>

<p>Shrike took the bottle he was carrying and pulled its cork.
Then he got some charged water and made two highballs.</p>

<p>"Well," Shrike said, lifting his drink, "so you're going in
for this kind of stuff, eh? Whisky and the boss's wife."</p>

<p>Miss Lonelyhearts always found it impossible to reply to him.
The answers he wanted to make were too general and began too far
back in the history of their relationship.</p>

<p>"You're doing field work, I take it," Shrike said. "Well,
don't put this whisky on your expense account. However, we like
to see a young man with his heart in his work. You've been going
around with yours in your mouth."</p>

<p>Miss Lonelyhearts made a desperate attempt to kid back. "And
you," he said, "you're an old meanie who beats his wife,"</p>

<p>Shrike laughed, but too long and too loudly, then broke off
with an elaborate sigh. "Ah, my lad," he said, "you're wrong.
It's Mary who does the beating."</p>

<p>He took a long pull at his highball and sighed again, still
more elaborately. "My good friend, I want to have a
heart-to-heart talk with you. I adore heart-to-heart talks and
nowadays there are so few people with whom one can really talk.
Everybody is so hard-boiled. I want to make a clean breast of
matters, a nice clean breast. It's better to make a clean breast
of matters than to let them fester in the depths of one's
soul."</p>

<p>While talking, he kept his face alive with little nods and
winks that were evidently supposed to inspire confidence and to
prove him a very simple fellow.</p>

<p>"My good friend, your accusation hurts me to 'the quick. You
spiritual lovers think that you alone suffer. But you are
mistaken. Although my love is of the flesh flashy, I too suffer.
It's suffering that drives me into the arms of the Miss Farkises
of this world. Yes, I suffer."</p>

<p>Here the dead pan broke and pain actually crept into his
voice. "She's selfish. She's a damned selfish bitch. She was a
virgin when I married her and has been fighting ever since to
remain one. Sleeping with her is like sleeping with a knife in
one's groin."</p>

<p>It was Miss Lonelyhearts' turn to laugh. He put his face close
to Shrike's and laughed as hard as he could.</p>

<p>Shrike tried to ignore him by finishing as though the whole
thing were a joke.</p>

<p>"She claims that I raped her. Can you imagine Willie Shrike,
wee Willie Shrike, raping any one? I'm like you, one of those
grateful lovers."</p>

<p>Mary came into the room in her bathrobe. She leaned over Miss
Lonelyhearts and said: "Don't talk to that pig. Come with me and
bring the whisky."</p>

<p>As he followed her into the bedroom, he heard Shrike slam the
front door. She went into a large closet to dress. He sat on the
bed.</p>

<p>"What did that swine say to your</p>

<p>"He said you were selfish, Mary--sexually selfish."</p>

<p>"Of all the god-damned nerve. Do you know why he lets me go
out with other men? To save money. He knows that I let them neck
me and when I get home all hot and bothered, why he climbs into
my bed and begs for it. The cheap bastard!"</p>

<p>She came out of the closet wearing a black lace slip and began
to fix her hair in front of the dressing table. Miss Lonelyhearts
bent down to kiss the back of her neck.</p>

<p>"Now, now," she said, acting kittenish, "you'll muss me."</p>

<p>He took a drink from the whisky bottle, then made her a
highball. When he brought it to her, she gave him a kiss, a
little peck of reward.</p>

<p>"Where'll we eat?" she asked. "Let's go where we can dance. I
want to be gay."</p>

<p>They took a cab to a place called El Gaucho. When they
entered, the orchestra was playing a Cuban rhumba. A waiter
dressed as a South-American cowboy led them to a table. Mary
immediately went Spanish and her movements became languorous and
full of abandon.</p>

<p>But the romantic atmosphere only heightened his feeling of icy
fatness. He tried to fight it by telling himself that it was
childish. What had happened to his great understanding heart?
Guitars, bright shawls, exotic foods, outlandish costumes--all
these things were part of the business of dreams. He had learned
not to laugh at the advertisements offering to teach writing,
cartooning, engineering, to add inches to the biceps and to
develop the bust. He should therefore realize that the people who
came to El Gaucho were the same as those who wanted to write and
live the life of an artist, wanted to be an engineer and wear
leather puttees, wanted to develop a grip that would impress the
boss, wanted to cushion Raoul's head on their swollen breasts.
They were the same people as those who wrote to Miss Lonelyhearts
for help.</p>

<p>But his irritation was too profound for him to soothe it in
this way. For the time being, dreams left him cold, no matter how
humble they were.</p>

<p>"I like this place," Mary said. "It's a little fakey, I know,
but it's gay and I so want to be gay."</p>

<p>She thanked him by offering herself in a series of formal,
impersonal gestures. She was wearing a tight, shiny dress that
was like glass-covered steel and there was something cleanly
mechanical in her pantomime.</p>

<p>"Why do you want to be gay?"</p>

<p>"Every one wants to be gay--unless they're sick."</p>

<p>Was he sick? In a great cold wave, the readers of his column
crashed over the music, over the bright shawls and picturesque
waiters, over her shining body. To save himself, he asked to see
the medal. Like a little girl helping an old man to cross the
street, she leaned over for him to look into the neck of her
dress. But before he had a chance to see anything, a waiter came
up to the table.</p>

<p>"The way to be gay is to make other people gay," Miss
Lonelyhearts said. "Sleep with me and I'll be one gay dog."</p>

<p>The defeat in his voice made it easy for her to ignore his
request and her mind sagged with his. "I've had a tough time,"
she said. "From the beginning, I've had a tough time. When I was
a child, I saw my mother die. She had cancer of the breast and
the pain was terrible. She died leaning over a table."</p>

<p>"Sleep with me," he said.</p>

<p>"No, let's dance."</p>

<p>"I don't want to. Tell me about your mother."</p>

<p>"She died leaning over a table. The pain was so terrible that
she climbed out of bed to die."</p>

<p>Mary leaned over to show how her mother had died and he made
another attempt to see the medal. He saw that there was a runner
on it, but was unable to read the inscription.</p>

<p>"My father was very cruel to her," she continued. "He was a
portrait painter, a man of genius, but..."</p>

<p>He stopped listening and tried to bring his great
understanding heart into action again. Parents are also part of
the business of dreams. My. father was a Russian prince, my
father was a Piute Indian chief, my father was an Australian
sheep baron, my father lost all his money in Wall Street, my
father was a portrait painter. People like Mary were unable to do
without such tales. They told them because they wanted to talk
about something besides clothing or business or the movies,
because they wanted to talk about something poetic.</p>

<p>When she had finished her story, he said, "You poor kid," and
leaned over for another look at the medal. She bent to help him
and pulled out the neck of her dress with her fingers. This time
he was able to read the inscription: "Awarded by the Boston Latin
School for first place in the 100 yd. dash."</p>

<p>It was a small victory, yet it greatly increased his fatigue
and he was glad when she suggested leaving. In the cab, he again
begged her to sleep with him. She refused. He kneaded her body
like a sculptor grown angry with his clay, but there was too much
method in his caresses and they both remained cold.</p>

<p>At the door of her apartment, she turned for a kiss and
pressed against him. A spark flared up in his groin. He refused
to let go and tried to work this spark into a flame. She pushed
his mouth away from a long wet kiss.</p>

<p>"Listen to me," she said. "We can't stop talking. We must
talk. Willie probably heard the elevator and is listening behind
the door. You don't know him. If he doesn't hear us talk, he'll
know you're kissing me and open the door. It's an old trick of
his."</p>

<p>He held her close and tried desperately to keep the spark
alive.</p>

<p>"Don't kiss my lips," she begged. "I must talk."</p>

<p>He kissed her throat, then opened her dress and kissed her
breasts. She was afraid to resist or to stop talking.</p>

<p>"My mother died of cancer of the breast," she said in a brave
voice, like a little girl reciting at a party. "She died leaning
over a table. My father was a portrait painter. He led a very gay
life. He mistreated my mother. She had cancer of the breast.
She..." He tore at her clothes and she began to mumble and repeat
herself. Her dress fell to her feet and he tore away her
underwear until she was naked under her fur coat. He tried to
drag her to the floor.</p>

<p>"Please, please," she begged, "he'll come out and find
us."</p>

<p>He stopped her mouth with a long kiss.</p>

<p>"Let me go, honey," she pleaded, "maybe he's not home. If he
isn't, I'll let you in."</p>

<p>He released her. She opened the door and tiptoed in, carrying
her rolled up clothes under her coat. He heard her switch on the
light in the foyer and knew that Shrike had not been behind the
door. Then he heard footsteps and limped behind a projection of
the elevator shaft. The door opened and Shrike looked into the
corridor. He had on only the top of his pajamas.</p>

<h2>MISS LONELYHEARTS ON A FIELD TRIP</h2>

<p>It was cold and damp in the city room the next day, and Miss
Lonelyhearts sat at his desk with his hands in his pockets and
his legs pressed together. A desert, he was thinking, not of
sand, but of rust and body dirt, surrounded by a back-yard fence
on which are posters describing the events of the day. Mother
slays five with ax, slays seven, slays nine...Babe slams two,
slams three...Inside the fence Desperate, Broken-hearted,
Disillusioned-with-tubercular-husband and the rest were gravely
forming the letters MISS LONELYHEARTS out of white-washed clam
shells, as if decorating the lawn of a rural depot.</p>

<p>He failed to notice Goldsmith's waddling approach until a
heavy arm dropped on his neck like the arm of a deadfall. He
freed himself with a grunt. His anger amused Goldsmith, who
smiled, bunching his fat cheeks like twin rolls of smooth pink
toilet paper.</p>

<p>"Well, how's the drunkard?" Goldsmith asked, imitating
Shrike.</p>

<p>Miss Lonelyhearts knew that Goldsmith had written the column
for him yesterday, so he hid his annoyance to be grateful.</p>

<p>"No trouble at all," Goldsmith said. "It was a pleasure to
read your mail." He took a pink envelope out of his pocket and
threw it on the desk "From an admirer." He winked, letting a
thick gray lid down slowly and luxuriously over a moist, rolling
eye.</p>

<p>Miss Lonelyhearts picked up the letter.</p>

<p><i>Dear Miss Lonelyhearts--</i></p>

<p><i>I am not very good at writing so I wonder if I could have a
talk with you. I am only 32 years old but have had a lot of
trouble in my life and am unhappily married to a cripple. I need
some good advice bad but cant state my case in a letter as I am
not good at letters and it would take an expert to state my case.
I know your a man and am glad as I dont trust women. You were
pointed out to me in Delehantys as a man who does the advice in
the paper and the minute I saw you I said you can help me. You
had on a blue suit and a gray hat when I came in with my husband
who is a cripple. I don't feel so bad about asking to see you
personal because I feel almost like I knew you. So please call me
up at Bugess 7-7323 which is my number as I need your advice bad
about my married life.</i></p>

<p><i>An admirer,</i></p>

<p><i>Fay Doyle</i></p>

<p>He threw the letter into the waste-paper basket with a great
show of distaste.</p>

<p>Goldsmith laughed at him. "How now, Dostoievski?" he said.
"That's no way to act. Instead of pulling the Russian by
recommending suicide, you ought to get the lady with child and
increase the potential circulation of the paper."</p>

<p>To drive him away, Miss Lonelyhearts made believe that he was
busy. He went over to his typewriter and started pounding out his
column.</p>

<p>"Life, for most of us, seems a terrible struggle of pain and
heartbreak, without hope or joy. Oh, my dear readers, it only
seems so. Every man, no matter how poor or humble, can teach
himself to use his senses. See the cloud-flecked sky, the
foam-decked sea...Smell the sweet pine and heady privet...Feel of
velvet and of satin...As the popular song goes, 'The best things
in life are free.' Life is..."</p>

<p>He could not go on with it and turned again to the imagined
desert where Desperate, Broken-hearted and the others were still
building his name. They had run out of sea shells and were using
faded photographs, soiled fans, time-tables, playing cards,
broken toys, imitation jewelry--junk that memory had made
precious, far more precious than anything the sea might
yield.</p>

<p>He killed his great understanding heart by laughing, then
reached into the waste-paper basket for Mrs. Doyle's letter. Like
a pink tent, he set it over the desert. Against the dark mahogany
desk top, the cheap paper took on rich flesh tones. He thought of
Mrs. Doyle as a tent, hair-covered and veined, and of himself as
the skeleton in a water closet, the skull and cross-bones on a
scholar's bookplate. When he made the skeleton enter the flesh
tent, it flowered at every joint.</p>

<p>But despite these thoughts, he remained as dry and cold as a
polished bone and sat trying to discover a moral reason for not
calling Mrs. Doyle. If he could only believe in Christ, then
adultery would be a sin, then everything would be simple and the
letters extremely easy to answer.</p>

<p>The completeness of his failure drove him to the telephone. He
left the city room and went into the hall to use the pay station
from which all private calls had to be made. The walls of the
booth were covered with obscene drawings. He fastened his eyes on
two disembodied genitals and gave the operator Burgess
7-7323.</p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Doyle in?"</p>

<p>"Hello, who is it?"</p>

<p>"I want to speak to Mrs. Doyle," he said. "Is this Mrs.
Doyle?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's me." Her voice was hard with fright</p>

<p>"This is Miss Lonelyhearts."</p>

<p>"Miss who?"</p>

<p>"Miss Lonelyhearts, Miss Lonelyhearts, the man who does the
column."</p>

<p>He was about to hang up, when she cooed, "Oh, hello..."</p>

<p>"You said I should call."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes...what?"</p>

<p>He guessed that she wanted him to do the talking. "When can
you see me?"</p>

<p>"Now." She was still cooing and he could almost feel her warm,
moisture-laden breath through the earpiece. "Where?"</p>

<p>"You say."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what," he said. "Meet me in the park, near the
obelisk, in about an hour."</p>

<p>He went back to his desk and finished his column, then started
for the park. He sat down on a bench near the obelisk to wait for
Mrs. Doyle. Still thinking of tents, he examined the sky and saw
that it was canvas-colored and ill-stretched. He examined it like
a stupid detective who is searching for a clue to his own
exhaustion. When he found nothing, he turned his trained eye on
the skyscrapers that menaced the little park from all sides. In
their tons of forced rock and tortured steel, he discovered what
he thought was a clue.</p>

<p>Americans have dissipated their radical energy in an orgy of
stone breaking. In their few years they have broken more stones
than did centuries of Egyptians. And they have done their work
hysterically, desperately, almost as if they knew that the stones
would some day break them.</p>

<p>The detective saw a big woman enter the park and start in his
direction. He made a quick catalogue: legs like Indian clubs,
breasts like balloons and a brow like a pigeon. Despite her short
plaid skirt, red sweater, rabbit-skin jacket and knitted
tam-o'-shanter, she looked like a police captain.</p>

<p>He waited for her to speak first.</p>

<p>"Miss Lonelyhearts? Oh, hello..."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Doyle?" He stood up and took her arm. It felt like a
thigh.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" she asked, as he began to lead her
off.</p>

<p>"For a drink."</p>

<p>"I can't go to Delehanty's. They know me."</p>

<p>"We'll go to my place."</p>

<p>"Ought I?"</p>

<p>He did not have to answer, for she was already on her way. As
he followed her up the stairs to his apartment, he watched the
action of her massive hams; they were like two enormous
grindstones.</p>

<p>He made some highballs and sat down beside her on the bed.</p>

<p>"You must know an awful lot about women from your job," she
said with a sigh, putting her hand on his knee.</p>

<p>He had always been the pursuer, but now found a strange
pleasure in having the roles reversed. He drew back when she
reached for a kiss. She caught his head and kissed him on his
mouth. At first it ticked like a watch, then the tick softened
and thickened into a heart throb. It beat louder and more rapidly
each second, until he thought that it was going to explode and
pulled away with a rude jerk.</p>

<p>"Don't," she begged.</p>

<p>"Don't what?"</p>

<p>"Oh, darling, turn out the light."</p>

<p>He smoked a cigarette, standing in the dark and listening to
her undress. She made sea sounds; something flapped like a sail;
there was the creak of ropes; then he heard the
wave-against-a-wharf smack of rubber on flesh. I Her call for him
to hurry was a sea-moan, and when he lay beside her, she heaved,
tidal, moon-driven.</p>

<p>Some fifteen minutes later, he crawled out of bed like an
exhausted swimmer leaving the surf, and dropped down into a large
armchair near the window. She went into the bathroom, then came
back and sat in his lap.</p>

<p>"I'm ashamed of myself," she said. "You must think I'm u bad
woman."</p>

<p>He shook his head no.</p>

<p>"My husband isn't much. He's a cripple like I wrote you, and
much older than me." She laughed. "He's all dried up. He hasn't
been a husband to me for years. You know, Lucy, my kid; isn't
his."</p>

<p>He saw that she expected him to be astonished and did his best
to lift his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"It's a long story," she said. "It was on account of Lucy that
I had to marry him. I'll bet you must have wondered how it was I
came to marry a cripple. It's a long story."</p>

<p>Her voice was as hypnotic as a tom-tom, and as monotonous.
Already his mind and body were half asleep.</p>

<p>"It's a long, long story, and that's why I couldn't write it
in a letter. I got into trouble when the Doyles lived above us on
Center Street. I used to be kind to him and go to the movies with
him because he was a cripple, although I was one of the most
popular girls on the block. So when I got into trouble, I didn't
know what to do and asked him for the money for an abortion. But
he didn't have the money, so we got married instead. It all came
through my trusting a dirty dago. I thought he was a gent, but
when I asked him to marry me, why he spurned me from the door and
wouldn't even give me money for an abortion. He said if he gave
me the money that would mean it was his fault and I would have
something on him. Did you ever hear of such a skunk?"</p>

<p>"No," he said. The life out of which she spoke was even
heavier than her body. It was as if a gigantic, living Miss
Lonelyhearts letter in the shape of a paper weight had been
placed on his brain.</p>

<p>"After the baby was born, I wrote the skunk, but he never
wrote back, and about two years ago, I got to thinking how unfair
it was for Lucy to have to depend on a cripple and not come into
her rights. So I looked his name up in the telephone book and
took Lucy to see him. As I told him then, not that I wanted
anything for myself, but just that I wanted Lucy to get what was
coming to her. Well, after keeping us waiting in the hall over an
hour--I was boiling mad, I can tell you, thinking of the wrong he
had done me and my child--we were taken into the parlor by the
butler. Very quiet and lady-like, because money ain't everything
and he's no more a gent than I'm a lady, the dirty wop--I told
him he ought to do something for Lucy see'n' he's her father.
Well, he had the nerve to say that he had never seen me before
and that if I didn't stop bothering him, he'd have me run in.
That got me riled and I lit into the bastard and gave him a piece
of my mind. A woman came in while we were arguing that I figured
was his wife, so I hollered, 'He's the father of my child, he's
the father of my child.' When they went to the 'phone to call a
cop, I picked up the kid and beat it.</p>

<p>"And now comes the funniest part of the whole thing. My
husband is a queer guy and he always makes believe that he is the
father of the kid and even talks to me about our child. Well,
when we got home, Lucy kept asking me why I said a strange man
was her papa. She wanted to know if Doyle wasn't really her papa.
I must of been crazy because I told her that she should remember
that her real papa was a man named Tony Benelli and that he had
wronged me. I told her a lot of other crap like that--too much
movies I guess. Well, when Doyle got home the first thing Lucy
says to him is that he ain't her papa. That got him sore and he
wanted to know what I had told her. I didn't like his high
falutin' ways and said, The truth.' I guess too that I was kinds
sick of see'n him moon over her. He went for me and hit me one on
the cheek. I wouldn't let no man get away with that so I socked
back and he swung at me with his stick but missed and fell on the
floor and started to cry. The kid was on the floor crying too and
that set me off because the next thing I know I'm on the floor
bawling too."</p>

<p>She waited for him to comment, but he remained silent until
she nudged him into speech with her elbow. "Your husband probably
loves you and the kid," he said.</p>

<p>"Maybe so, but I was a pretty girl and could of had my pick.
What girl wants to spend her life with a shrimp of a
cripple?"</p>

<p>"You're still pretty," he said without knowing why, except
that he was frightened.</p>

<p>She rewarded him with a kiss, then dragged him to the bed.</p>

<h2>MISS LONELYHEARTS IN THE DISMAL SWAMP</h2>

<p>Soon after Mrs. Doyle left, Miss Lonelyhearts became
physically sick and was unable to leave his room. The first two
days of his illness were blotted out by sleep, but on the third
day, his imagination began again to work.</p>

<p>He found himself in the window of a pawnshop full of fur
coats, diamond rings, watches, shotguns, fishing tackle,
mandolins. All these things were the paraphernalia of suffering.
A tortured high light twisted on the blade of a gift knife, a
battered horn grunted with pain.</p>

<p>He sat in the window thinking. Man has a tropism for order.
Keys in one pocket, change in another. Mandolins are tuned G D A
E. The physical world has a tropism for disorder, entropy. Man
against Nature...the battle of the centuries. Keys yearn to mix
with change. Mandolins strive to get out of tune. Every order has
within it the germ of destruction. All order is doomed, yet the
battle is worth while.</p>

<p>A trumpet, marked to sell for $2.49, gave the call to battle
and Miss Lonelyhearts plunged into the fray. First he formed a
phallus of old watches and rubber boots, then a heart of
umbrellas and trout flies, then a diamond of musical instruments
and derby hats, after these a circle, triangle, square, swastika.
But nothing proved definitive and he began to make a gigantic
cross. When the cross became too large for the pawnshop, he moved
it to the shore of the ocean. There every wave added to his stock
faster than he could lengthen its arms. His labors were enormous.
He staggered from the last wave line to his work, loaded down
with marine refuse--bottles, shells, chunks of cork, fish heads,
pieces of net.</p>

<p>Drunk with exhaustion, he finally fell asleep. When he awoke,
he felt very weak, yet calm.</p>

<p>There was a timid knock on the door. It was open and Betty
tiptoed into the room with her arms full of bundles. He made
believe that he was asleep.</p>

<p>"Hello," he said suddenly.</p>

<p>Startled, she turned to explain. "I heard you were sick, so I
brought some hot soup and other stuff."</p>

<p>He was too tired to be annoyed by her wide-eyed little mother
act and let her feed him with a spoon. When he had finished
eating, she opened the window and freshened the bed. As soon as
the room was in order, she started to leave, but he called her
back.</p>

<p>"Don't go, Betty."</p>

<p>She pulled a chair to the side of his bed and sat there
without speaking.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry about what happened the other day," he said. "I
guess I was sick."</p>

<p>She showed that she accepted his apology by helping him to
excuse himself. "It's the Miss Lonelyhearts job. Why don't you
give it up?"</p>

<p>"And do what?"</p>

<p>"Work in an advertising agency, or something."</p>

<p>"You don't understand, Betty, I can't quit. And even if I were
to quit, it wouldn't make any difference. I wouldn't be able to
forget the letters, no matter what I did."</p>

<p>"Maybe I don't understand," she said, "but I think you're
making a fool of yourself."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can make you understand. Let's start from the
beginning. A man is hired to give advice to the readers of a
newspaper. The job is a circulation stunt and the whole staff
considers it a joke. He welcomes the job, for it might lead to a
gossip column, and anyway he's tired of being a leg man. He too
considers the job a joke, but after several months at it, the
joke begins to escape him. He sees that the majority of the
letters are profoundly humble pleas for moral and spiritual
advice, that they are inarticulate expressions of genuine
suffering. He also discovers that his correspondents take him
seriously. For the first time in his life, he is forced to
examine the values by which he lives. This examination shows him
that he is the victim of the joke and not its perpetrator."</p>

<p>Although he had spoken soberly, he saw that Betty still
thought him a fool. He closed his eyes.</p>

<p>"You're tired," she said. "I'll go."</p>

<p>"No, I'm not tired. I'm just tired of talking, you talk a
while."</p>

<p>She told him about her childhood' on a farm and of her love
for animals, about country sounds and country smells and of how
fresh and clean everything in the country is. She said that he
ought to live there and that if he did, he would find that all
his troubles were city troubles.</p>

<p>While she was talking, Shrike burst into the room. He was
drunk and immediately set up a great shout, as though he believed
that Miss Lonelyhearts was too near death to hear distinctly.
Betty left without saying good-by.</p>

<p>Shrike had evidently caught some of her farm talk, for he
said: "My friend, I agree with Betty, you're an escapist. But I
do not agree that the soil is the proper method for you to
use."</p>

<p>Miss Lonelyhearts turned his face to the wall and pulled up
the covers. But Shrike was unescapable. He raised his voice and
talked through the blankets into the back of Miss Lonelyhearts'
head.</p>

<p>"There are other methods, and for your edification I shall
describe them. But first let us do the escape to the soil, as
recommended by Betty:</p>

<p>"You are fed up with the city and its teeming millions. The
ways and means of men, as getting and lending and spending, you
lay waste your inner world, are too much with you. The bus takes
too long, while the subway is always crowded. So what do you do?
So you buy a farm and walk behind your horse's moist behind, no
collar or tie, plowing your broad swift acres. As you turn up the
rich black soil, the wind carries the smell of pine and dung
across the fields and the rhythm of an old, old work enters your
soul. To this rhythm, you sow and weep and chivy your kine, not
kin or kind, between the pregnant rows of corn and taters. Your
step becomes the heavy sexual step of a dance-drunk Indian and
you tread the seed down into the female earth. You plant, not
dragon's teeth, but beans and greens...</p>

<p>"Well, what do you say, my friend, shall it be the soil?"</p>

<p>Miss Lonelyhearts did not answer. He was thinking of how
Shrike had accelerated his sickness by teaching him to handle his
one escape, Christ, with a thick glove of words.</p>

<p>"I take your silence to mean that you have decided against the
soil. I agree with you. Such a life is too dull and laborious.
Let us now consider the South Seas:</p>

<p>"You live in a thatch hut with the daughter of the king, u
slim young maiden in whose eyes is an ancient wisdom. I Her
breasts are golden speckled pears, her belly a melon, and her
odor is like nothing so much as a jungle fern. In the evening, on
the blue lagoon, under the silvery moon, to your love you croon
in the soft sylabelew and vocabelew of her langorour tongorour.
Your body is golden brown like hers, and tourists have need of
the indignant finger of the missionary to point you out. They
envy you your breech clout and carefree laugh and little brown
bride and fingers instead of forks. But you don't return their
envy, and when a beautiful society girl comes to your hut in the
night, seeking to learn the secret of your happiness, you send
her back to her yacht that hangs on the horizon like a nervous
racehorse. And so you dream away the days, fishing, hunting,
dancing, swimming, kissing, and picking flowers to twine in your
hair...</p>

<p>"Well, my friend, what do you think of the South Seas?" Miss
Lonelyhearts tried to stop him by making believe that he was
asleep. But Shrike was not fooled.</p>

<p>"Again silence," he said, "and again you are right. The South
Seas are played out and there's little use in imitating Gauguin.
But don't be discouraged, we have only scratched the surface of
our subject. Let us now examine Hedonism, or take the cash and
let the credit go...</p>

<p>"You dedicate your life to the pursuit of pleasure. No
over-indulgence, mind you, but knowing that your body is a
pleasure machine, you treat it carefully in order to get the most
out of it. Golf as well as booze, Philadelphia Jack O'Brien and
his chest-weights as well as Spanish dancers. Nor do you neglect
the pleasures of the mind. You fornicate under pictures by
Matisse and Picasso, you drink from Renaissance glassware, and
often you spend an evening beside the fireplace with Proust and
an apple. Alas, after much good fun the day comes when you
realize that soon you must die. You keep a stiff upper lip and
decide to give a last party. You invite all your old mistresses,
trainers, artists and boon companions. The guests are dressed in
black, the waiters are coons, the table is a coffin carved for
you by Eric Gill. You serve caviar and blackberries and licorice
candy and coffee without cream. After the dancing girls have
finished, you get to your feet and call for silence in order to
explain your philosophy of life. 'Life,' you say, 'is a club
where they won't stand for squawks, where they deal you only one
hand and you must sit in. So even if the cards are cold and
marked by the hand of fate, play up, play up like a gentleman and
a sport. Get tanked, grab what's on the buffet, use the girls
upstairs, but remember, when you throw box cars, take the curtain
like a dead game sport, don't squawk.'...</p>

<p>"I won't even ask you what you think of such an escape. You
haven't the money, nor are you stupid enough to manage it. But we
come now to one that should suit you much better...</p>

<p>"Art! Be an artist or a writer. When you are cold, warm
yourself before the flaming tints of Titian, when you are hungry,
nourish yourself with great spiritual foods by listening to the
noble periods of Bach, the harmonies of Brahms and the thunder of
Beethoven. Do you think there is anything in the fact that their
names all begin with B? But don't take a chance, smoke a 3 B
pipe, and remember these immortal lines: <i>When to the
suddenness of melody the echo parting falls the failing day</i>.
What a rhythm! Tell them to keep their society whores and pressed
duck with oranges. For you <i>l'art vivant</i>, the living art,
as you call it. Tell them that you know that your shoes are
broken and that there are pimples on your face, yes, and that you
have buck teeth and a club foot, but that you don't care, for
to-morrow they are playing Beethoven's last quartets in Carnegie
Hall and at home you have Shakespeare's plays in one volume."</p>

<p>After art, Shrike described suicide and drugs. When he had
finished with them, he came to what he said was the goal of his
lecture.</p>

<p>"My friend, I know of course that neither the soil, nor the
South Seas, nor Hedonism, nor art, nor suicide, nor drugs, can
mean anything to us. We are not men who swallow camels only to
strain at stools. God alone is our escape. The church is our only
hope, the First Church of Christ Dentist, where He is worshiped
as Preventer of Decay. The church whose symbol is the trinity
new-style: Father, Son and Wirehaired Fox Terrier...And so, my
good friend, let me dictate a letter to Christ for you:</p>

<p><i>Dear Miss Lonelyhearts of Miss Lonelyhearts--</i></p>

<p><i>I am twenty-six years old and in the newspaper game. Life
for me is a desert empty of comfort. I cannot find pleasure in
food, drink, or women--nor do the arts give me joy any longer.
The Leopard of Discontent walks the streets of my city; the Lion
of Discouragement crouches outside the walls of my citadel. All
is desolation and a vexation of the spirit. I feel like hell. How
can. I believe, how can I have faith in this day and age? Is it
true that the greatest scientists believe again in you?</i></p>

<p><i>I read your column and like it very much. There you once
wrote: 'When the salt has lost its savour, who shall savour it
again?' Is the answer: 'None but the Saviour?'</i></p>

<p><i>Thanking you very much for a quick reply, I remain yours
truly,</i></p>

<p><i>A Regular Subscriber"</i></p>

<h2>MISS LONELYHEARTS IN THE COUNTRY</h2>

<p>Betty came to see Miss Lonelyhearts the next day and every day
thereafter. With her she brought soup and boiled chicken for him
to eat.</p>

<p>Hie knew that she believed he did not want to get well, yet he
followed her instructions because he realized that his present
sickness was unimportant. It was merely a trick by his body to
relieve one more profound.</p>

<p>Whenever he mentioned the letters or Christ, she changed the
subject to tell long stories about life on a farm. She seemed to
think that if he never talked about these things, his body would
get well, that if his body got well everything would be well. He
began to realize that there was a definite plan behind her farm
talk, but could not guess what it was.</p>

<p>When the first day of spring arrived, he felt better. He had
already spent more than a week in bed and was anxious to get out.
Betty took him for a walk in the zoo and he was amused by her
evident belief in the curative power of animals. She seemed to
think that it must steady him to look at a buffalo.</p>

<p>He wanted to go back to work, but she made him get Shrike to
extend his sick leave a few days. He was grateful to her and did
as she asked. She then told him her plan. Her aunt still owned
the farm in Connecticut on which she had been born and they could
go there and camp in the house.</p>

<p>She borrowed an old Ford touring car from a friend. They
loaded it with food and equipment and started out early one
morning. As soon as they reached the outskirts of the city, Betty
began to act like an excited child, greeting the trees and grass
with delight.</p>

<p>After they had passed through New Haven, they came to Bramford
and turned off the State highway on a dirt road that led to
Monkstown. The road went through a wild-looking stretch of woods
and they saw some red squirrels and a partridge. He had to admit,
even to himself, that the pale new leaves, shaped and colored
like candle flames, were beautiful and that the air smelt clean
and alive.</p>

<p>There was a pond on the farm and they caught sight of it
through the trees just before coming to the house. She did not
have the key so they had to force the door open. The heavy, musty
smell of old furniture and wood rot made them cough. He
complained. Betty said that she did not mind because it was not a
human smell. She put so much meaning into the word "human" that
he laughed and kissed her.</p>

<p>They decided to camp in the kitchen because it was the largest
room and the least crowded with old furniture. There were four
windows and a door and they opened them all to air the place
out.</p>

<p>While he unloaded the car, she swept up and made a fire in the
stove out of a broken chair. The stove looked like a locomotive
and was almost as large, but the chimney drew all right and she
soon had a fire going. He got some water from the well and put it
on the stove to boil. When the water was scalding hot, they used
it to clean an old mattress that they had found in one of the
bedrooms. Then they put the mattress out in the sun to dry.</p>

<p>It was almost sundown before Betty would let him stop working.
He sat smoking a cigarette, while she prepared supper. They had
beans, eggs, bread, fruit and drank two cups of coffee
apiece.</p>

<p>After they had finished eating, there was still some light
left and they went down to look at the pond. They sat close
together with their backs against a big oak and watched a heron
hunt frogs. Just as they were about to start back, two deer and a
fawn came down to the water on the opposite side of the pond. The
flies were bothering them and they went into the water and began
to feed on the lily pads. Betty accidentally made a noise and the
deer floundered back into the woods.</p>

<p>When they returned to the house, it was quite dark. They lit
the kerosene lamp that they had brought with them, then dragged
the mattress into the kitchen and made their bed on the floor
next to the stove.</p>

<p>Before going to bed, they went out on the kitchen porch to
smoke a last cigarette. It was very cold and he had to go back
for a blanket. They sat close together with the blanket wrapped
around them.</p>

<p>There were plenty of stars. A screech owl made a horrible
racket somewhere in the woods and when it quit, a loon began down
on the pond. The crickets made almost as much noise as the
loon.</p>

<p>Even with the blanket around them it was cold. They went
inside and made a big fire in the stove, using pieces of a
hardwood table to make the fire last. They each ate an apple,
then put on their pajamas and went to bed. He fondled her, but
when she said that she was a virgin, he let her alone and went to
sleep.</p>

<p>He woke up with the sun in his eyes. Betty was already busy at
the stove. She sent him down to the pond to wash and when he got
back, breakfast was ready. It consisted of eggs, ham, potatoes,
fried apples, bread and coffee.</p>

<p>After breakfast, she worked at making the place more
comfortable and he drove to Monkstown for some fresh fruit and
the newspapers. He stopped for gas at the Aw-Kum-On Garage and
told the attendant about the deer. The man said that there was
still plenty of deer at the pond because no yids ever went there.
He said it wasn't the hunters who drove out the deer, but the
yids.</p>

<p>He got back to the house in time for lunch and, after eating,
they went for a walk in the woods. It was very sad under the
trees. Although spring was well advanced, in the deep shade there
was nothing but death--rotten leaves, gray and white fungi, and
over everything a funereal hush.</p>

<p>Later it grew very hot and they decided to go for a swim. They
went in naked. The water was so cold that they could only stay in
for a short time. They ran back to the house and took a quick
drink of gin, then sat in a sunny spot on the kitchen porch.</p>

<p>Betty was unable to sit still for long. There was nothing to
do in the house, so she began to wash the underwear she had worn
on the trip up. After she had finished, she rigged a line between
two trees.</p>

<p>He sat on the porch and watched her work. She had her hair
tied up in a checked handkerchief, otherwise she was completely
naked. She looked a little fat, but when she lifted something to
the line, all the fat disappeared. Her raised arms pulled her
breasts up until they were like pink-tipped thumbs.</p>

<p>There was no wind to disturb the pull of the earth. The new
green leaves hung straight down and shone in the hot sun like an
army of little metal shields. Somewhere in the woods a thrush was
singing. Its sound was like that of a flute choked with
saliva.</p>

<p>Betty stopped with her arms high to listen to the bird. When
it was quiet, she turned towards him with a guilty laugh. He blew
her a kiss. She caught it with a gesture that was childishly
sexual. He vaulted the porch rail and ran to kiss her. As they
went down, he smelled a mixture of sweat, soap and crushed
grass.</p>

<h2>MISS LONELYHEARTS RETURNS</h2>

<p>Several days later, they started to drive back to the city.
When they reached the Bronx slums, Miss Lonelyhearts knew that
Betty had failed to cure him and that he had been right when he
had said that he could never forget the letters. He felt better,
knowing this, because he had begun to think himself a faker and a
fool.</p>

<p>Crowds of people moved through the street with a dream-like
violence. As he looked at their broken hands and torn mouths he
was overwhelmed by the desire to help them, and because this
desire was sincere, he was happy despite the feeling of guilt
which accompanied it.</p>

<p>He saw a man who appeared to be on the verge of death stagger
into a movie theater that was showing a picture called <i>Blonde
Beauty</i>. He saw a ragged woman with an enormous goiter pick a
love story magazine out of a garbage can and seem very excited by
her find.</p>

<p>Prodded by his conscience, he began to generalize. Men have
always fought their misery with dreams. Although dreams were once
powerful, they have been made puerile by the movies, radio and
newspapers. Among many betrayals, this one is the worst.</p>

<p>The thing that made his share in it particularly bad was that
he was capable of dreaming the Christ dream. He felt that he had
failed at it, not so much because of Shrike's jokes or his own
self-doubt, but because of his lack of humility.</p>

<p>He finally got to bed. Before falling asleep, he vowed to make
a sincere attempt to be humble. In the morning, when he started
for his office, he renewed his vow. Fortunately for him, Shrike
was not in the city room and his humility was spared an immediate
trial. He went straight to his desk and began to open letters.
When he had opened about a dozen, he felt sick and decided to do
his column for that day without reading any of them. He did not
want to test himself too severely.</p>

<p>The typewriter was uncovered and he put a sheet of paper into
the roller.</p>

<p>"Christ died for you.</p>

<p>"He died nailed to a tree for you. His gift to you is
suffering and it is only through suffering that you can know Him.
Cherish this gift, for..."</p>

<p>He snatched the paper out of the machine. With him, even the
word Christ was a vanity. After staring at the pile of letters on
his desk for a long time, he looked out the window. A slow spring
rain was changing the dusty tar roofs below him to shiny patent
leather. The water made everything slippery and he could find no
support for either his eyes or his feelings.</p>

<p>Turning back to his desk, he picked up a bulky letter in a
dirty envelope. He read it for the same reason that an animal
tears at a wounded foot: to hurt the pain.</p>

<p><i>Dear Miss Lonelyhearts:--</i></p>

<p><i>Being an admirer of your column because you give such good
advice to people in trouble as that is what I am in also I would
appreciate very much your advising me what to do after I tell you
my troubles.</i></p>

<p><i>During the war I was told if I wanted to do my bit I should
marry the man I was engaged to as he was going away to help Uncle
Sam and to make a long story short I was married to him. After
the war was over he still had to remain in the army for one more
year as he signed for it and naturally I went to work as while
doing this patriotic stunt he had only $i8 dollars to his name. I
worked for three years steady and then had to stay home because I
became a mother and in the meantime of those years my husband
would get a job and then would tire of it or want to roam. It was
all right before the baby came because then I could work steady
and then bills were paid but when I stopped everything went
sliding backward. Then two years went by and a baby boy was added
to our union. My girl will be eight and my boy six years of
age.</i></p>

<p><i>I made up my mind after I had the second child that in
spite of my health as I was hit by an auto while carrying the
first I would get some work to do but debts collected so rapidly
it almost took a derick to lift them let alone a sick woman. I
went to work evenings when my husband would be home so as
somebody could watch the baby and I did this until the baby was
three years old when I thought of taking in a man who had been
boarding with his sister as she moved to Rochester and he had to
look for a new place. Well my husband agreed as he figured the
$15 dollars per he paid us would make it easier for him as this
man was a widower with two children and as my husband knew him
for twelve years being real pals then going out together etc.
After the boarder was with us for about a year my husband didn't
come home one night and then two nights etc. I listed him in the
missing persons and after two and a half months I was told to go
to Grove St. which I did and he was arrested because he refused
to support me and my kids. When he served three months of the six
the judge asked me to give lion another chance which like a fool
I did and when he got home he beat me up so I had to spend over
$30 dollars in the dentist afterwards.</i></p>

<p><i>He got a pension from the army and naturally I was the one
to take it to the store and cash it as he was so lazy I always
had to sign his name and of course put per my name and through
wanting to pay the landlord because he wanted to put us out I
signed his check as usual but forgot to put per my name and for
this to get even with me because he did three months time he sent
to Washington for the copy of the check so I could be arrested
for forgery but as the butcher knew about me signing the checks
etc nothing was done to me.</i></p>

<p><i>He threatened my life many times saying no one solved the
Mrs. Mills murder and the same will happen to you and many times
when making beds I would find under his pillow a hammer,
scissors, knife, stone lifter etc and when I asked him what the
idea was he would make believe he knew nothing about it or say
the children put them there and then a few months went buy and I
was going to my work as usual as the boarder had to stay home
that day due to the fact the material for his boss did not arrive
and he could not go to work as he is a piece worker. I always
made a habit of setting the breakfast and cooking the food the
night before so I could stay in bed until seven as at that time
my son was in the Kings County hospital with a disease which my
husband gave me that he got while fighting for Uncle Sam and I
had to be at the clinic for the needle to. So while I was in bed
unbeknown to me my husband sent the boarder out for a paper and
when he came back my husband was gone. So later when I came from
my room I was told that my husband had gone out. I fixed the
childs breakfast and ate my own then went to the washtub to do
the weeks wash and while the boarder was reading the paper at
twelve o'clock noon my mother came over to mind the baby as I had
a chance to go out and make a little money doing house work.
Things were a little out of order beds not dressed and things out
of place and a little sweeping had to be done as I was washing
all morning and I didn't have a chance to do it so I thought to
do it then while my mother was in the house with her to help me
so that I could finish quickly. Hurrying at break neck speed to
get finished I swept through the rooms to make sure everything
was spick and span so when my husband came home he couldn't have
anything to say. We had three beds and I was on the last which
was a double bed when stooping to put the broom under the bed to
get at the lint and the dust when lo and behold I saw a face like
the mask of a devil with only the whites of the eyes showing and
hands clenched to choke anyone and then I saw it move and I was
so frighted that almost till night I was hystirical and I was
paralised from my waist down. I thought I would never be able to
walk again. A doctor was called for me by my mother and he said
the man ought to be put in an asylum to do a thing like that. It
was my husband lieing under the bed from seven in the morning
until almost half past one o'clock lieing in his own dirt instead
of going to the bath room when he had to be dirtied himself
waiting to fright me.</i></p>

<p><i>So as I could not trust him I would not sleep with him and
as I told the boarder to find a new place because I thought maybe
he was jealous of something I slept in the boarders bed in an
other room. Some nights I would wake up and find him standing by
my bed laughing like a crazy man or walking around stripped
etc.</i></p>

<p><i>I bought a new sowing machine as I do some sowing for other
people to make both ends meet and one night while I was out
delivering my work I got back to find the house cleaned out and
he had pawned my sowing machine and also all the other pawnables
in the house. Ever since he frighted me I have been so nervous
during the night when I get up for the children that he would be
standing behind a curtain and either jump out at me or put his
hand on me before I could light the light. Well as I had to see
that I could not make him work steady and that I had to be mother
and housekeeper and wage earner etc and I could not let my nerves
get the best of me as I lost a good fob once on account of having
bad nerves I simply moved away from him and anyway there was
nothing much left in the house. But he pleaded with me for
another chance so I thought seeing he is the father of my
children I will and then he did more crazy things to many to
write and I left him again. Four times we got together and four
times I left. Please Miss Lonelyhearts believe me just for the
childrens sake is the bunk and pardon me because I dont know how
you are fixed but all I know is that in over three years I got
$200 dollars from him altogether.</i></p>

<p><i>About four months ago I handed him a warrant for his arrest
for non support and he tore it up and left the house and I havent
seen him since and as I had pneumonia and my little girl had the
flu I was put in financial embarasment with the doctor and we had
to go to the ward and when we came out of the hospital I had to
ask the boarder to come to live with us again as he was a sure
$15 dollars a week and if anything happened to me he would be
there to take care of the children. But he tries to make me be
bad and as there is nobody in the house when he comes home drunk
on Saturday night I dont know what to do but so far I didnt let
him. Where my husband is I dont know but I received a vile letter
from him where he even accused his inocent children of things and
sarcasticaly asked about the star boarder.</i></p>

<p><i>Dear Miss Lonelyhearts please don't be angry at me for
writing such a long letter and taking up so much of your time in
reading it but if I ever write all the things which happened to
me living with him it would fill a book and please forgive me for
saying some nasty things as I had to give you an idea of what is
going on in my home. Every woman is intitiled to a home isnt she?
So Miss Lonelyhearts please put a few lines in your column when
you refer to this letter so I will know you are helping me. Shall
I take my husband back? How can I support my children?</i></p>

<p><i>Thanking you for anything you can advise me in I
remain</i></p>

<p><i>yours truly--</i></p>

<p><i>Broad Shoulders</i></p>

<p><i>P.S. Dear Miss Lonelyhearts dont think I am broad
shouldered but that is the way I feel about life and me I
mean.</i></p>

<h2>MISS LONELYHEARTS AND THE CRIPPLE</h2>

<p>Miss Lonelyhearts dodged Betty because she made him feel
ridiculous. He was still trying to cling to his humility, and the
farther he got below self-laughter, the easier it was for him to
practice it. When Betty telephoned, he refused to answer and
after he had twice failed to call her back, she left him
alone.</p>

<p>One day, about a week after he had returned from the country,
Goldsmith asked him out for a drink. When he accepted, he made
himself so humble that Goldsmith was frightened and almost
suggested a doctor.</p>

<p>They found Shrike in Delehanty's and joined him at the bar.
Goldsmith tried to whisper something to him about Miss
Lonelyhearts' condition, but he was drunk and refused to listen.
He caught only part of what Goldsmith was trying to say.</p>

<p>"I must differ with you, my good Goldsmith," Shrike said.
"Don't call sick those who have faith. They are the well. It is
you who are sick."</p>

<p>Goldsmith did not reply and Shrike turned to Miss
Lonelyhearts. "Come, tell us, brother, how it was that you first
came to believe. Was it music in a church, or the death of a
loved one, or mayhap, some wise old priest?"</p>

<p>The familiar jokes no longer had any effect on Miss
Lonelyhearts. He smiled at Shrike as the saints are supposed to
have smiled at those about to martyr them.</p>

<p>"Ah, but how stupid of me," Shrike continued. "It was the
letters, of course. Did I myself not say that the Miss
Lonelyhearts are the priests of twentieth-century America?"</p>

<p>Goldsmith laughed, and Shrike, in order to keep him laughing,
used an old trick; he appeared to be offended. "Goldsmith, you
are the nasty product of this unbelieving age. You cannot
believe, you can only laugh. You take everything with a bag of
salt and forget that salt is the enemy of fire as well as of ice.
Be warned, the salt you use is not Attic salt, it is coarse
butcher's salt. It doesn't preserve; it kills."</p>

<p>The bartender who was standing close by, broke in to address
Miss Lonelyhearts. "Pardon me, sir, but there's a gent here named
Doyle who wants to meet you. He says you know his wife."</p>

<p>Before Miss Lonelyhearts could reply, he beckoned to someone
standing at the other end of the bar. The signal was answered by
a little cripple, who immediately started in their direction. He
used a cane and dragged one of his feet behind him in a
box-shaped shoe with a four-inch sole. As he hobbled along, he
made many waste motions, like those of a partially destroyed
insect.</p>

<p>The bartender introduced the cripple as Mr.-Peter Doyle. Doyle
was very excited and shook hands twice all around, then with a
wave that was meant to be sporting, called for a round of
drinks.</p>

<p>Before lifting his glass, Shrike carefully inspected the
cripple. When he had finished, he winked at Miss Lonely-hearts
and said, "Here's to humanity." He patted Doyle on the back.
"Mankind, mankind..." he sighed, wagging his head sadly. "What is
man that..."</p>

<p>The bartender broke in again on behalf of his friend and tried
to change the conversation to familiar ground. "Mr. Doyle
inspects meters for the gas company."</p>

<p>"And an excellent job it must be," Shrike said. "He should be
able to give us the benefit of a different viewpoint. We
newspapermen are limited in many ways and I like to hear both
sides of a case."</p>

<p>Doyle had been staring at Miss Lonelyhearts as though
searching for something, but he now turned to Shrike and tried to
be agreeable. "You know what people say, Mr. Shrike?"</p>

<p>"No, my good man, what is it that people say?"</p>

<p>"Everybody's got a frigidaire nowadays, and they say that we
meter inspectors take the place of the iceman in the stories." He
tried, rather diffidently, to leer.</p>

<p>"What!" Shrike roared at him. "I can see, sir, that you are
not the man for us. You can know nothing about humanity; you are
humanity. I leave you to Miss Lonely-hearts." He called to
Goldsmith and stalked away.</p>

<p>The cripple was confused and angry. "Your friend is a nut," he
said. Miss Lonelyhearts was still smiling, but the character of
his smile had changed. It had become full of sympathy and a
little sad.</p>

<p>The new smile was for Doyle and he knew it. He smiled back
gratefully.</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot," Doyle said, "the wife asked me, if I humped
into you, to ask you to our house to eat. That's why I made Jake
introduce us."</p>

<p>Miss Lonelyhearts was busy with his smile and accepted without
thinking of the evening he had spent with Mrs. Doyle. The cripple
felt honored and shook hands for a third time. It was evidently
his only social gesture. After a few more drinks, when Doyle said
that he was tired, Miss Lonelyhearts suggested that they go into
the back room. They found a table and sat opposite each
other.</p>

<p>The cripple had a very strange face. His eyes failed to
balance; his mouth was not under his nose; his forehead was
square and bony; and his round chin was like a forehead in
miniature. He looked like one of those composite photographs used
by screen magazines in guessing contests.</p>

<p>They sat staring at each other until the strain of wordless
communication began to excite them both. Doyle made vague,
needless adjustments to his clothing. Miss Lonelyhearts found it
very difficult to keep his smile steady.</p>

<p>When the cripple finally labored into speech, Miss
Lonelyhearts was unable to understand him. He listened hard for a
few minutes and realized that Doyle was making no attempt to be
understood. He was giving birth to groups of words that lived
inside of him as things, a jumble of the retorts he had meant to
make when insulted and the private curses against fate that
experience had taught him to swallow.</p>

<p>Like a priest, Miss Lonelyhearts turned his face slightly
away. He watched the play of the cripple's hands. At first they
conveyed nothing but excitement, then gradually they became
pictorial. They lagged behind to illustrate a matter with which
he was already finished, or ran ahead to illustrate something he
had not yet begun to talk about. As he grew more articulate, his
hands stopped trying to aid his speech and began to dart in and
out of his clothing. One of them suddenly emerged from a pocket
of his coat, dragging some sheets of letter paper. He forced
these on Miss Lonelyhearts.</p>

<p><i>Dear Miss Lonelyhearts--</i></p>

<p><i>I am kind of ashamed to write you because a man like me
dont take stock in things like that but my wife told me you were
a man and not some dopey woman so I thought I would write to you
after reading your answer to Disillusioned. I am a cripple 41 yrs
of age which I have been all my life and I have never let myself
get blue until lately when I have been feeling lousy all the time
on account of not getting anywhere and asking myself what is it
all for. You have a education so I figured may be you no. What I
want to no is why I go around pulling my leg up and down stairs
reading meters for the gas company for a stinking $22.50 per
while the bosses ride around in swell cars living off the fat of
the land. Dont think I am a greasy red. I read where they shoot
cripples in Russia because they cant work but I can work better
than any park bum and support a wife and child to. But thats not
what I am writing you about. What I want to no is what is it all
for my pulling my god darned leg along the streets and down in
stinking cellars with it all the time hurting fit to burst so
that near quitting time I am crazy with pain and when I get home
all I hear is money money which aint no home for a man like me.
What I want to no is what in hell is the use day after day with a
foot like mine when you have to go around pulling and scrambling
for a lousy three squares with a toothache in it that comes from
useing the foot so much. The doctor told me I ought to rest it
for six months but who will pay me when I am resting it. But that
aint what I mean either because you might tell me to change my
fob and where could I get another one I am lucky to have one at
all. It aint the fob that I am complaining about but what I want
to no is what is the whole stinking business for.</i></p>

<p><i>Please write me an answer not in the paper because my wife
reads your stuff and I dont want her to no I wrote to you because
I always said the papers is crap but I figured maybe you no
something about it because you have read a lot of books and I
never even finished high.</i></p>

<p><i>Yours truly,</i></p>

<p><i>Peter Doyle</i></p>

<p>While Miss Lonelyhearts was puzzling out the crabbed writing,
Doyle's damp hand accidentally touched his under the table. He
jerked away, but then drove his hand back and forced it to clasp
the cripple's. After finishing the letter, he did not let go, but
pressed it firmly with all the love he could manage. At first the
cripple covered his embarrassment by disguising the meaning of
the clasp with a handshake, but he soon gave in to it and they
sat silently, hand in hand.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>MISS LONELYHEARTS PAYS A VISIT</h2>

<p>They left the speakeasy together, both very drunk and very
busy: Doyle with the wrongs he had suffered and Miss Lonelyhearts
with the triumphant thing that his humility had become.</p>

<p>They took a cab. As they entered the street in which Doyle
lived, he began to curse his wife and his crippled foot. He
called on Christ to blast them both.</p>

<p>Miss Lonelyhearts was very happy and inside of his head he was
also calling on Christ. But his call was not a curse, it was the
shape of his joy.</p>

<p>When the cab drew up to the curb, Miss Lonelyhearts helped his
companion out and led him into the house. They made a great deal
of noise with the front door and Mrs. Doyle came into the hall.
At the sight of her the cripple started to curse again.</p>

<p>She greeted Miss Lonelyhearts, then took hold of her husband
and shook the breath out of him. When he was quiet, she dragged
him into their apartment. Miss Lonely-hearts followed and as he
passed her in the dark foyer, she goosed him and laughed.</p>

<p>After washing their hands, they sat down to eat. Mrs. Doyle
had had her supper earlier in the evening and she waited on them.
The first thing she put on the table was a quart bottle of guinea
red.</p>

<p>When they had reached their coffee, she sat down next to Miss
Lonelyhearts. He could feel her knee pressing his under the
table, but he paid no attention to her and only broke his
beatific smile to drink. The heavy food had dulled him and he was
trying desperately to feel again what he had felt while holding
hands with the cripple in the speakeasy.</p>

<p>She put her thigh under his, but when he still failed to
respond, she got up abruptly and went into the parlor. They
followed a few minutes later and found her mixing ginger-ale
highballs.</p>

<p>They all drank silently. Doyle looked sleepy and his wife was
just beginning to get drunk. Miss Lonelyhearts made no attempt to
be sociable. He was busy trying to find a message. When he did
speak it would have to be in the form of a message.</p>

<p>After the third highball, Mrs. Doyle began to wink quite
openly at Miss Lonelyhearts, but he still refused to pay any
attention to her. The cripple, however, was greatly disturbed by
her signals. He began to fidget and mumble under his breath.</p>

<p>The vague noises he was making annoyed Mrs. Doyle. "What in
hell are you talking about?" she demanded.</p>

<p>The cripple started a sigh that ended in a groan and then, as
though ashamed of himself, said, "Ain't I the pimp, to bring home
a guy for my wife?" He darted a quick look at Miss Lonelyhearts
and laughed apologetically.</p>

<p>Mrs. Doyle was furious. She rolled a newspaper into a club and
struck her husband on the mouth with it. He surprised her by
playing the fool. He growled like a dog and caught the paper in
his teeth. When she let go of her end, he dropped to his hands
and knees and continued the imitation on the floor.</p>

<p>Miss Lonelyhearts tried to get the cripple to stand up and
bent to lift him; but, as he did so, Doyle tore open Miss
Lonelyhearts' fly, then rolled over on his back, laughing
wildly.</p>

<p>His wife kicked him and turned away with a snort of
contempt.</p>

<p>The cripple soon laughed himself out, and they all returned to
their seats. Doyle and his wife sat staring at each other, while
Miss Lonelyhearts again began to search for a message.</p>

<p>The silence bothered Mrs. Doyle. When she could stand it no
longer, she went to the sideboard to make another round of
drinks. But the bottle was empty. She asked her husband to go to
the corner drug store for some gin. He refused with a single,
curt nod of his head.</p>

<p>She tried to argue with him. He ignored her and she lost her
temper. "Get some gin!" she yelled. "Get some gin, you
bastard!"</p>

<p>Miss Lonelyhearts stood up. He had not yet found his message,
but he had to say something. "Please don't fight," he pleaded.
"He loves you, Mrs. Doyle; that's why he acts like that. Be kind
to him."</p>

<p>She grunted with annoyance and left the room. They could hear
her slamming things around in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Miss Lonelyhearts went over to the cripple and smiled at him
with the same smile he had used in the speakeasy. The cripple
returned the smile and stuck out his hand. Miss Lonelyhearts
clasped it, and they stood this way, smiling and holding hands,
until Mrs. Doyle reentered the room.</p>

<p>"What a sweet pair of fairies you guys are," she said.</p>

<p>The cripple pulled his hand away and made as though to strike
his wife. Miss Lonelyhearts realized that now was the time to
give his message. It was now or never.</p>

<p>"You have a big, strong body, Mrs. Doyle. Holding your husband
in your arms, you can warm him and give him life. You can take
the chill out of his bones. He drags his days out in areaways and
cellars, carrying a heavy load of weariness and pain. You can
substitute a dream of yourself for this load. A buoyant dream
that will be like a dynamo in him. You can do this by letting him
conquer you in your bed. He will repay you by flowering and
becoming ardent over you..."</p>

<p>She was too astonished to laugh, and the cripple turned his
face away as though embarrassed.</p>

<p>With the first few words Miss Lonelyhearts had known that he
would be ridiculous. By avoiding God, he had failed to tap the
force in his heart and had merely written a column for his
paper.</p>

<p>He tried again by becoming hysterical. "Christ is love," he
screamed at them. It was a stage scream, but he kept on. "Christ
is the black fruit that hangs on the cross-tree. Man was lost by
eating of the forbidden fruit. He shall be saved by eating of the
bidden fruit. The black Christ-fruit, the love fruit..."</p>

<p>This time he had failed still more miserably. He had
substituted the rhetoric of Shrike for that of Miss
Lonely-hearts. He felt like an empty bottle, shiny and
sterile.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes. When he heard the cripple say, "I love
you, I love you," he opened them and saw him kissing his wife. He
knew that the cripple was doing this, not because of the things
he had said, but out of loyalty. "All right, you nut," she said,
queening it over her husband. "I forgive you, but go to the drug
store for some gin."</p>

<p>Without looking at Miss Lonelyhearts, the cripple took his hat
and left. When he had gone Mrs. Doyle smiled. "You were a scream
with your fly open," she said. "I thought I'd die laughing."</p>

<p>He did not answer.</p>

<p>"Boy, is he jealous," she went on. "All I have to do is point
to some big guy and say, 'Gee, I'd love to have him love me up.'
It drives him nuts."</p>

<p>Her voice was low and thick and it was plain that she was
trying to excite him. When she went to the radio to tune in on a
jazz orchestra, she waved her behind at him like a flag.</p>

<p>He said that he was too tired to dance. After doing a few
obscene steps in front of him, she sat down in his lap. He tried
to fend her off, but she kept pressing her open mouth against his
and when he turned away, she nuzzled his cheek. He felt like an
empty bottle that is being slowly filled with warm, dirty
water.</p>

<p>When she opened the neck of her dress and tried to force his
head between her breasts, he parted his knees with a quick jerk
that spilled her to the floor. She tried to pull him down on top
of her. He struck out blindly and hit her in the face. She
screamed and he hit her again and again. He kept hitting her
until she stopped trying to hold him, then he ran out of the
house.</p>

<h2>MISS LONELYHEARTS ATTENDS A PARTY</h2>

<p>Miss Lonelyhearts had gone to bed again. This time his bed was
surely taking him somewhere, and with great speed. He had only to
ride it quietly. He had already been riding for three days.</p>

<p>Before climbing aboard, he had prepared for the journey by
jamming the telephone bell and purchasing several enormous cans
of crackers. He now lay on the bed, eating crackers, drinking
water and smoking cigarettes.</p>

<p>He thought of how calm he was. His calm was so perfect that he
could not destroy it even by being conscious of it. In three days
he had gone very far. It grew dark in the room. He got out of
bed, washed his teeth, urinated, then turned out the light and
went to sleep. He fell asleep without even a sigh and slept the
sleep of the wise and the innocent. Without dreaming, he was
aware of fireflies and the slop of oceans.</p>

<p>Later a train rolled into a station where he was a reclining
statue holding a stopped clock, a coach rumbled into the yard of
an inn where he was sitting over a guitar, cap in hand, shedding
the rain with his hump.</p>

<p>He awoke. The noise of both arrivals had combined to become a
knocking on the door. He climbed out of bed. Although he was
completely naked, he went to the door without covering himself.
Five people rushed in, two of whom were women. The women shrieked
when they saw him and jumped back into the hall.</p>

<p>The three men held their ground. Miss Lonelyhearts recognized
Shrike among them and saw that he, as well as the others, was
very drunk. Shrike said that one of the women was his wife and
wanted to fight Miss Lonely-hearts for insulting her.</p>

<p>Miss Lonelyhearts stood quietly in the center of the room.
Shrike dashed against him, but fell back, as a wave that dashes
against an ancient rock, smooth with experience, falls back.
There was no second wave.</p>

<p>Instead Shrike became jovial. He slapped Miss Lonely-hearts on
the back. "Put on a pair of pants, my friend," he said, "we're
going to a party."</p>

<p>Miss Lonelyhearts picked up a can of crackers.</p>

<p>"Come on, my son," Shrike urged. "It's solitary drinking that
makes drunkards."</p>

<p>Miss Lonelyhearts carefully examined each cracker before
popping it into his mouth.</p>

<p>"Don't be a spoil-sport," Shrike said with a great deal of
irritation. He was a gull trying to lay an egg in the smooth
flank of a rock, a screaming, clumsy gull. "There's a game we
want to play and we need you to play it.--Everyman his own Miss
Lonelyhearts.' I invented it, and we can't play without you."</p>

<p>Shrike pulled a large batch of letters out of his pockets and
waved them in front of Miss Lonelyhearts. He recognized them;
they were from his office file.</p>

<p>The rock remained calm and solid. Although Miss Lonelyhearts
did not doubt that it could withstand any test, he was willing to
have it tried. He began to dress.</p>

<p>They went downstairs, and all six of them piled into one cab.
Mary Shrike sat on his lap, but despite her drunken wriggling the
rock remained perfect.</p>

<p>The party was in Shrike's apartment. A roar went up when Miss
Lonelyhearts entered and the crowd surged forward. He stood firm
and they slipped back in a futile curl. He smiled. He had turned
more than a dozen drunkards. He had turned them without effort or
thought. As he stood smiling, a little wave crept up out of the
general welter and splashed at his feet for attention. It was
Betty.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you?" she asked. "Are you sick
again?"</p>

<p>He did not answer.</p>

<p>When every one was seated, Shrike prepared to start the game.
He distributed paper and pencils, then led Miss Lonelyhearts to
the center of the room and began his spiel.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, imitating the voice and
gestures of a circus barker. "We have with us to-night a man whom
you all know and admire. Miss Lonelyhearts, he of the singing
heart--a still more swollen Mussolini of the soul.</p>

<p>"He has come here to-night to help you with your moral and
spiritual problems, to provide you with a slogan, a cause, an
absolute value and a <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>.</p>

<p>"Some of you, perhaps, consider yourself too far gone for
help. You are afraid that even Miss Lonelyhearts, no matter how
fierce his torch, will be unable to set you on fire. You are
afraid that even when exposed to his bright flame, you will only
smolder and give off a bad smell. Be of good heart, for I know
that you will burst into flame. Miss Lonelyhearts is sure to
prevail."</p>

<p>Shrike pulled out the batch of letters and waved them above
his head.</p>

<p>"We will proceed systematically," he said. "First, each of you
will do his best to answer one of these letters, then, from your
answers, Miss Lonelyhearts will diagnose your moral ills.
Afterwards he will lead you in the way of attainment."</p>

<p>Shrike went among his guests and distributed the letters as a
magician does cards. He talked continuously and read a part of
each letter before giving it away.</p>

<p>"Here's one from an old woman whose son died last week. She is
seventy years old and sells pencils for a living. She has no
stockings and wears heavy boots on her torn and bleeding feet.
She has rheum in her eyes. Have you room in your heart for
her?</p>

<p>"This one is a jim-dandy. A young boy wants a violin. It looks
simple; all you have to do is get the kid one. But then you
discover that he has dictated the letter to his little sister. He
is paralyzed and can't even feed himself. He has a toy violin and
hugs it to his chest, imitating the sound of playing with his
mouth. How pathetic! However, one can learn much from this
parable. Label the boy Labor, the violin Capital, and so
on..."</p>

<p>Miss Lonelyhearts stood it with the utmost serenity; he was
not even interested. What goes on in the sea is of no interest to
the rock.</p>

<p>When all the letters had been distributed, Shrike gave one to
Miss Lonelyhearts. He took it, but after holding it for a while,
he dropped it to the floor without reading it.</p>

<p>Shrike was not quiet for a second.</p>

<p>"You are plunging into a world of misery and suffering,
peopled by creatures who are strangers to everything but disease
and policemen. Harried by one, they are hurried by the
other...</p>

<p>"Pain, pain, pain, the dull, sordid, gnawing, chronic pain of
heart and brain. The pain that only a great spiritual liniment
can relieve..."</p>

<p>When Miss Lonelyhearts saw Betty get up to go, he followed her
out of the apartment. She too should see the rock he had
become.</p>

<p>Shrike did not miss him until he discovered the letter on the
floor. He picked it up, tried to find Miss Lonelyhearts, then
addressed the gathering again.</p>

<p>"The master has disappeared," he announced, "but do not
despair. I am still with you. I am his disciple and I shall lead
you in the way of attainment. First let me read you this letter
which is addressed directly to the master."</p>

<p>He took the letter out of its envelope, as though he had not
read it previously, and began: "'What kind of a dirty skunk are
you? When I got home with the gin, I found my wife crying on the
floor and the house full of neighbors. She said that you tried to
rape her you dirty skunk and they wanted to get the police but I
said that I'd do the job myself you...'</p>

<p>"My, oh my, I really can't bring myself to utter such vile
language. I'll skip the swearing and go on. 'So that's what all
your fine speeches come to, you bastard, you ought to have your
brains blown out.' It's signed, 'Doyle.'</p>

<p>"Well, well, so the master is another Rasputin. How this
shakes one's faith! But I can't believe it. I won't believe it.
The master can do no wrong. My faith is unshaken. This is only
one more attempt against him by the devil. He has spent his life
struggling with the arch fiend for our sakes, and he shall
triumph. I mean Miss Lonelyhearts, not the devil.</p>

<p>"The gospel according to Shrike. Let me tell you about his
life. It unrolls before me like a scroll. First, in the dawn of
childhood, radiant with pure innocence, like a rain-washed star,
he wends his weary way to the University of Hard Knocks. Next, a
youth, he dashes into the night from the bed of his first whore.
And then, the man, the man Miss Lonelyhearts--struggling
valiantly to realize a high ideal, his course shaped by a proud
aim. But, alas! cold and scornful, the world heaps obstacle after
obstacle in his path; deems he the goal at hand, a voice of
thunder bids him 'Halt!' 'Let each hindrance be thy ladder,'
thinks he. 'Higher, even higher, mount!' And so he climbs, rung
by weary rung, and so he urges himself on, breathless with
hallowed fire. And so..."</p>

<h2>MISS LONELYHEARTS AND THE PARTY DRESS</h2>

<p>When Miss Lonelyhearts left Shrike's apartment, he found Betty
in the hall waiting for the elevator. She had on a light-blue
dress that was very much a party dress. She dressed for things,
he realized.</p>

<p>Even the rock was touched by this realization. No; it was not
the rock that was touched. The rock was still perfect. It was his
mind that was touched, the instrument with which he knew the
rock.</p>

<p>He approached Betty with a smile, for his mind was free and
clear. The things that muddied it had precipitated out into the
rock.</p>

<p>But she did not smile back "What are you grinning at?" she
snapped.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry," he said. "I didn't mean anything."</p>

<p>They entered the elevator together. When they reached the
street, he took her arm although she tried to jerk away.</p>

<p>"Won't you have a soda, please?" he begged. The party dress
had given his simplified mind its cue and he delighted in the
boy-and-girl argument that followed.</p>

<p>"No; I'm going home."</p>

<p>"Oh, come on," he said, pulling her towards a soda fountain.
As she went, she unconsciously exaggerated her
little-girl-in-a-party-dress air.</p>

<p>They both had strawberry sodas. They sucked the pink drops up
through straws, she pouting at his smile, neither one of them
conscious of being cute.</p>

<p>"Why are you mad at me, Betty? I didn't do anything. It was
Shrike's idea and he did all the talking."</p>

<p>"Because you are a fool."</p>

<p>"I've quit the Miss Lonelyhearts job. I haven't been in the
office for almost a week."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to look for a job in an advertising agency."</p>

<p>He was not deliberately lying. He was only trying to say what
she wanted to hear. The party dress was so gay and charming,
light blue with a frothy lace collar flecked with pink, like the
collar of her soda.</p>

<p>"You ought to see Bill Wheelright about a job. He owns an
agency--he's a swell guy...He's in love with me." "I couldn't
work for a rival."</p>

<p>She screwed up her nose and they both laughed.</p>

<p>He was still laughing when he noticed that something had gone
wrong with her laugh. She was crying.</p>

<p>He felt for the rock. It was still there; neither laughter nor
tears could affect the rock. It was oblivious to wind or
rain.</p>

<p>"Oh..." she sobbed. "I'm a fool." She ran out of the
store.</p>

<p>He followed and caught her. But her sobs grew worse and he
hailed a taxi and forced her to get in.</p>

<p>She began to talk under her sobs. She was pregnant. She was
going to have a baby.</p>

<p>He put the rock forward and waited with complete poise for her
to stop crying. When she was quiet, he asked her to marry
him.</p>

<p>"No," she said. "I'm going to have an abortion."</p>

<p>"Please marry me." He pleaded just as he had pleaded with her
to have a soda.</p>

<p>He begged the party dress to marry him, saying all the things
it expected to hear, all the things that went with strawberry
sodas and farms in Connecticut. He was just what the party dress
wanted him to be: simple and sweet, whimsical and poetic, a
trifle collegiate yet very masculine.</p>

<p>By the time they arrived at her house, they were discussing
their life after marriage. Where they would live and in how many
rooms. Whether they could afford to have the child. How they
would rehabilitate the farm in Connecticut. What kind of
furniture they both liked.</p>

<p>She agreed to have the child. He won that point. In return, he
agreed to see Bill Wheelright about a job. With a great deal of
laughter, they decided to have three beds in their bedroom. Twin
beds for sleep, very prim and puritanical, and between them a
love bed, an ornate double bed with cupids, nymphs and Pans.</p>

<p>He did not feel guilty. He did not feel. The rock was a
solidification of his feeling, his conscience, his sense of
reality, his self-knowledge. He could have planned anything. A
castle in Spain and love on a balcony or a pirate trip and love
on a tropical island.</p>

<p>When her door closed behind him, he smiled. The rock had been
thoroughly tested and had been found perfect. He had only to
climb aboard the bed again.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>MISS LONELYHEARTS HAS A RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE</h2>

<p>After a long night and morning, towards noon, Miss
Lonelyhearts welcomed the arrival of fever. It promised heat and
mentally unmotivated violence. The promise was soon fulfilled;
the rock became a furnace.</p>

<p>He fastened his eyes on the Christ that hung on the wall
opposite his bed. As he stared at it, it became a bright fly,
spinning with quick grace on a background of blood velvet
sprinkled with tiny nerve stars.139</p>

<p>Everything else in the room was dead--chairs, table, pencils,
clothes, books. He thought of this black world of things as a
fish. And he was right, for it suddenly rose to the bright bait
on the wall. It rose with a splash of music and he saw its
shining silver belly.</p>

<p>Christ is life and light.</p>

<p>"Christ! Christ!" This shout echoed through the innermost
cells of his body.</p>

<p>He moved his head to a cooler spot on the pillow and the vein
in his forehead became less swollen. He felt clean and fresh. His
heart was a rose and in his skull another rose bloomed.</p>

<p>The room was full of grace. A sweet, clean grace, not washed
clean, but clean as the inner sides of the inner petals of a
newly forced rosebud.</p>

<p>Delight was also in the room. It was like a gentle wind, and
his nerves rippled under it like small blue flowers in a
pasture.</p>

<p>He was conscious of two rhythms that were slowly becoming one.
When they became one, his identification with God was complete.
His heart was the one heart, the heart of God. And his brain was
likewise God's.</p>

<p>God said, "Will you accept it, now?"</p>

<p>And he replied, "I accept, I accept."</p>

<p>He immediately began to plan a new life and his future conduct
as Miss Lonelyhearts. He submitted drafts of his column to God
and God approved them. God approved his every thought.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door bell rang. He climbed out of bed and went
into the hall to see who was coming. It was Doyle, the cripple,
and he was slowly working his way up the stairs.</p>

<p>God had sent him so that Miss Lonelyhearts could perform a
miracle and be certain of his conversion. It was a sign. He would
embrace the cripple and the cripple would be made whole again,
even as he, a spiritual cripple, had been made whole.</p>

<p>He rushed down the stairs to meet Doyle with his arms spread
for the miracle.</p>

<p>Doyle was carrying something wrapped in a newspaper. When he
saw Miss Lonelyhearts, he put his hand inside the package and
stopped. He shouted some kind of a warning, but Miss Lonelyhearts
continued his charge. He did not understand the cripple's shout
and heard it as a cry for help from Desperate, Harold S.,
Catholic-mother, Brokenhearted, Broad-shoulders, Sick-of-it-all,
Disillusioned-with-tubercular-husband. He was running to succor
them with love.</p>

<p>The cripple turned to escape, but he was too slow and Miss
Lonelyhearts caught him.</p>

<p>While they were struggling, Betty came in through the street
door. She called to them to stop and started up the stairs. The
cripple saw her cutting off his escape and tried to get rid of
the package. He pulled his hand out. The gun inside the package
exploded and Miss Lonelyhearts fell, dragging the cripple with
him. They both rolled part of the way down the stairs.</p>
