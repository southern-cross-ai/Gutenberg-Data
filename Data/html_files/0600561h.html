      BEAL INTERVIEWS VARIOUS STRETTONS
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Bartholomew Stretton, Esq., was shown into Beal's
      dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Beal won't keep you a minute, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so, quite so. He expects me--I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stretton put his hat and gloves on the table, and
      picking up a month-old copy of <i>Punch,</i> looked at one
      or two of the pictures and then discarded the paper with an
      air of impatience. He was in no mood to appreciate humour.
      He glanced round Beal's dining-room as though he disliked
      it. His restlessness would not permit him to sit down; it
      carried him to one of the windows and exhibited to him a
      section of Wimpole Street: iron railings, pavement, road,
      more pavement, more railings, a series of windows and three
      green front doors decorated with a number of very clean
      brass plates. It was raining. People passed with open
      umbrellas. To Mr. Stretton the rain, the pavements, the
      houses, and the people all looked the same colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beastly place!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to him that he had never seen Wimpole Street
      till six months ago, that it had not existed so far as he
      was concerned, and that it would have had no present
      existence had he not needed help. And yet he hated the
      street as a comfort-loving man hates anything which
      associates itself with some very unpleasant and importunate
      reality. Wimpole Street was an ugly smudge across the
      suburban serenity of Mr. Stretton's vision of life. He had
      been a successful man, a genially self-satisfied man, and
      that Fate should have administered a kick to him just when
      he was entering the last lap seemed monstrous and an
      outrage. It was the kind of scandal that impels a man to
      write angry letters to the papers--but this affair was too
      personal and too serious for such splutterings in
      self-relief. The problem--for it was a problem--stuck in
      poor old Stretton's throat, made his lower lip lax and
      querulous, and gave a slightly bewildered irritability to
      his blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The street depressed him so thoroughly that he turned about
      and began to wander round the room, looking at Rollin
      Beal's exquisite Georgian furniture and pictures with an
      air of perfunctory attention. He really did not see them,
      the beauty and the distinction of them; they were just so
      many chairs and cabinets and pieces of coloured porcelain
      and canvas. He had to look at something; the mental
      attitude of the man who reads every page of the morning and
      the evening paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      An oval mirror in a mahogany frame hanging slightly tilted
      above the Adam mantelpiece showed Bartholomew Stretton a
      reflection of himself. Instantly interested, he paused,
      like a very young child. He put up a hand and smoothed his
      hair, and gave a little touch to his tie. An observant
      person could have told him that he belonged to a previous
      generation, and that he should have worn a white top-hat, a
      white waistcoat and spats, and black-and-white check
      trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, he did wear spats, but they were
      biscuit-brown in colour. Mr. Stretton was very punctilious
      about being up to date. He was very punctilious in all the
      externals. When golf knickers were baggy, he wore them
      baggy. He was the most careful of formalists. That was why
      his son's disaster had hurt him so badly. He was sorry for
      his son; he was sorry for his wife--but he was bitterly
      sorry for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Beal is ready for you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bartholomew Stretton was shown into Rollin Beal's
      consulting-room. A tall man with kind eyes and an ironical
      mouth rose from his desk and extended a hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, how are things?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Stretton's face betrayed annoyance. Always, he had
      found Rollin Beal sympathetic, and when a man has a
      grievance he cannot resist airing it in the sunshine of
      some other man's sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's perfectly damnable!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down. Is your son back?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has been back a week. And my wife, sir, has been unable
      to sleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down. His blue eyes seemed to grow more prominent.
      In the most impressive and sentimental moments of his life
      he had always contrived to express his prejudices or his
      emotions by putting them into the mouth of his wife. It
      saved personal odium and suggested a considerate
      unselfishness. "Mrs. Stretton, sir, always says--" "My wife
      may be a little old-fashioned, but she does not approve,"
      etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal looked at him with observant eyes. They were kind,
      like the eyes of most men who do big things, or live big,
      active lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing fresh, I hope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, not in that way. But he is so utterly unreasonable. I
      don't think that we could have done more to soften the
      affair for him. My wife has been a perfect angel, and John
      has done nothing but sulk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He feels it a good deal?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear sir, I can understand that, but what I cannot
      understand is his way of showing it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or perhaps--of not showing it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stretton sat forward in his chair. His irritation
      changed suddenly and became an impulse of compassion; we
      are all of us egotists, and even our affections are tinted
      with various shades of egotism, and in Bartholomew
      Stretton's case his vexation was largely a matter of balked
      affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it, doctor. While John was in prison his mother and
      I talked everything over. We have been very happy in our
      children, you know, Beal, and rather proud of them; there's
      Reginald making his three thousand a year at the Bar, and
      Carlyon a managing director of Medmenhams at
      three-and-thirty. Well, we decided that when John came out
      we would have him home and go on as if nothing had
      happened."
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal's eyes were faintly smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did not even mention this affair?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And John did not mention it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has never said a word. That is what has hurt his
      mother--wounded her. My wife is a very affectionate woman,
      Beal, and I can tell you she has felt his silence--his
      almost hostile silence, I might call it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal nodded his big head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if you and Mrs. Stretton had agreed to bury the
      misfortune why should you be annoyed when your son did the
      same thing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Stretton looked at him reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my dear sir, perhaps you don't understand. I don't
      think you are married--please excuse me--I have no wish to
      be personal; I am merely trying to explain why John's
      silence wounded us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," said Beal, and turned to his desk and the open
      case-book which was lying on it. Rollin Beal was
      forty-five, young enough to sympathize with the younger
      man, and old enough to understand the prejudices of the
      father, yet the vital part of his sympathy was with the
      son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bartholomew Stretton had lived his life; Beal doubted
      whether sorrow had ever touched him; a man with that pink
      and comfortable face had never suffered very acutely. The
      very way in which he wished to claim a sort of ownership
      over the sufferings of a younger man who happened to be his
      son showed how little he fathomed the rebellious deeps of
      this other and more sensitive nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal's compassion went out to the son. Here was a man who
      had spent three years in the trenches, who had enlisted as
      a private and been twice wounded before he had won his
      company, and that other and far more disastrous wound which
      carried no visible scar and had brought him no honour.
      Beal, alienist and man of the world, had a warm heart and a
      deep compassion for all that generous youth which had
      laughed and died and suffered. He had seen the wreckage,
      the driftwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      No case had appealed to him more personally than John
      Stretton's. There was a likeness between them. As he looked
      at his case-book he had a very vivid picture of John
      Stretton, fine strung, sensitive, intensely intelligent,
      going tight lipped and brittle-eyed through all those
      years, to be brought down to a sort of ignominy, the victim
      of a spiritual wound of which no one could see the scar. It
      was a queer case, not a little pathetic, of a fine life
      balked and twisted, brought not only to apparent impotence,
      but to the very edge of disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bartholomew Stretton was fidgeting in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The thing is--what are we to do with him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal turned on the older man with curious swiftness. It was
      as though his impulse was to strike not a physical blow,
      but a spiritual one, and the austerity of his fine face
      seemed sharpened. He could be severe, and his severity was
      all the more potent because his eyes remained kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know the danger? I think that is the one thing we
      should keep in mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Stretton's face showed a slight increase of colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean that his career has gone? Of course, he had to
      resign from Rome and Mellabys; in six months he would have
      been a partner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean nothing of the sort. Don't you realize that some
      day--under certain circumstances--your son might commit
      murder--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Stretton bounced in his chair. He believed in plain
      speaking, or said he did, but when a very conventional man
      has become crystallized and rigid he is apt to resent
      sudden and violent vibrations. And Mr. Stretton looked
      inexpressibly shocked. Beal had meant to shock him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It can't be as bad as that. I know you doctors always
      exaggerate a little."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am stating a plain fact. It might be as bad as that.
      Morally your son would be innocent, because when these
      brain storms arise he is not responsible for what he does.
      Remember, it has happened three times, and on the last
      occasion--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Stretton put up an appealing hand as though to ward off
      a blow. "Don't, man, don't! The idea is too horrible. It
      would kill my poor wife." And then he added with a
      plaintive wail, "but why should this have happened to us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear sir, it might have happened to anybody."
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal's face softened. There was pathos and humour in the
      picture of this chubby, genial old Christian who had come
      through life with the idea that he and his were sacrosanct.
      Job-like he was almost ready to curse the Deity, the war,
      the doctors, his own incredible and undeserved affliction,
      but Beal did not want curses; he required the father's
      logical and kindly help in the healing of the son.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, there's the danger. Now, what are we going to do
      about it? I know quite well how this is worrying you for
      John's sake. There is something very lovable about John."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton's face twitched in response.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course there is. He was the gentlest child of the whole
      lot. You know, Beal, when we are hurt we get rather touchy.
      I'm ready to make any sacrifice, and so is his mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we must all work together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you suggest? A nursing-home, or something of that
      sort?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, nothing like that. But for this one leak in his brain
      your son is a healthy and a normal man. We have got to try
      to close that leak, give him the chance of leading a
      healthy life under circumstances which are the least likely
      to produce one of these storms."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Stretton nodded; he had become an audience, a docile
      and eager audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Money need be no consideration."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a great help, a very great help; but I don't think
      your son wants to be an idler."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The trouble is, Beal, that I don't know what the devil he
      does want! If he'd only talk--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal smiled. There were moments when his face became
      luminous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have got to find out. It is possible that he does not
      know himself. When a sensitive and proud man has had a
      knock-down blow like that--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then old Stretton saw light; it may have dawned on him in
      Rollin Beal's smile, in the patient and subtle wisdom of
      this healer of broken souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, doctor, I know that you are a very busy man, but
      could you come down to Esher and spend the week-end with
      us? I have an idea that John might talk to you. He likes
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal turned to his desk and glanced at his book of
      appointments.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I might manage it. I am free after one o'clock on
      Saturday. I should have to be back in town on the Sunday
      evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton breathed gratitude and relief. The problem of his
      youngest son's future had scared him into a sense of
      helplessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's awfully good of you, Beal. Look here, I will send
      the car up for you on Saturday. I was booked to play golf,
      but of course--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal, rising, stood over him protectingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Play golf. I shall want to be alone with John. And will
      you ask Mrs. Stretton to look on me as a friend and not as
      a doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will give her the hint, Beal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right. I'll expect the car at two o'clock on
      Saturday."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rollin Beal was busy for the rest of the morning; all his
      days were busy and he loved them, for Beal's life was good.
      There are some men who inspire gratitude and devotion, men
      of whom women speak with tenderness and not a little awe,
      the man whose work is as a fire to which the sick and the
      unfortunate come to warm their hands. Our little cynicisms
      and meannesses, our scoffings and clevernesses leave such
      men untouched.
    </p>
    <p>
      To them--the Pasteurs and the Listers of this world--the
      children whom they have saved run to be kissed, and we--who
      believe and strive--turn from the little dirtinesses of
      some cad's novel, or the treacheries in an egoist's
      memoirs, to the patient and unsensational greatness of such
      men's lives, and take heart and breathe more deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if Rollin Beal thought that he had finished with the
      Stretton menfolk for the day, they had not finished with
      him. He lunched at one, and at half-past two he had his
      out-patients and his clinic at Great Ormond Street, where a
      hundred or more students, packed in the big room, waited to
      see Rollin Beal's thin hands disentangle with sure
      brilliance some complex knot. At a quarter to two Rollin
      Beal's bell rang, and his maid brought him a card. "Mr.
      Reginald Stretton." The three thousand a year man was close
      on the heels of his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The gentleman particularly wishes to see you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can give him five minutes, Parker."
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal found Reginald Stretton planted well and square on the
      consulting-room hearthrug, and in this tacit assumption of
      his right to all hearthrugs lay the inwardness of his
      success. He was tall, deadly pale, with a slight stoop, and
      a bald superciliousness that was disturbing to smaller
      people. His great rolling forehead, cold eyes, and
      dominating nose made him impressive. He was laconic and
      deliberate. He gave shy people the feeling that he was
      prodding them as he might have prodded a hostile witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal did not like Reginald Stretton. You may respect a
      man's ability and hate him all the more for it, and Beal
      had very human moments. To be able to heal people you must
      have the understanding of all frailties, and Reginald
      Stretton had no frailties. Beal had hardly closed the door
      before the barrister had him in the witness-box, and was
      cross-examining him in his flat and inexorable voice.
      Bartholomew's eldest son would have been a failure in
      criminal cases, but then crime in its physical aspects had
      not appealed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I take it that this sort of thing may occur again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It might occur to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, may I ask what your experts are going to do about
      it? Here is this unfortunate youngster knocking about loose
      at Esher. Isn't that a temptation to providence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal saw in a flash what was at the back of this other
      man's mind, and he was nettled, not on his own account but
      on John's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Providence may be kinder than we are."
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave Reginald Stretton a blind eye. He wanted the other
      man to commit himself to the more or less brutal suggestion
      that it was annoying for him to have a young brother
      appearing at the police courts and getting sent to prison,
      and that this inconvenient ex-soldier should be caged up
      somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going down to Esher for the week-end. I think I may
      be able to do something."
    </p>
    <p>
      The rolling forehead and the emphatic chin became more
      aggressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't like this delay. Now, can you assure me--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal glanced at the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry; I am due at my hospital at half-past two. But,
      tell me, what do you mean--exactly--by delay?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing is being done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is better that nothing should be done. I presume you
      are suggesting some form of restraint?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly; in my brother's interest."
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal showed him eyes that were not blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The interest lies all the other way. You'll excuse me; can
      my maid ring you up a taxi? Before I go, I may as well
      remind you I don't want your brother fussed or frightened."
    </p>
    <p>
      Reginald Stretton remained on the hearthrug looking at the
      opposite wall for something he had meant to say and had
      forgotten, and Beal left him there still groping for the
      thing that he should have said. He discovered it and got it
      out as the doctor reached the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you assume the whole responsibility--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal turned in the doorway and saw the other man's big
      white face at the end of the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, but without interference, in the interests of
      my patient."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an evening of blue, autumnal dusk, with the lights
      shining big and yellow when Rollin Beal walked back to
      Wimpole Street. He had been an athlete in his day, but
      walking was the only exercise left to him, so exacting had
      life become. He had swung the door open and was removing
      his latchkey when Parker met him in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A gentleman waiting to see you, sir. Another Mr.
      Stretton."
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well, Parker, all good things come to an end! What is
      the other name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Carlyon, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker took his coat. This elderly woman with the watchful
      eyes and the pale and restrained face contradicted the old
      tag that no man is a hero to his servant. Or rather, they
      both shared in the contradiction of it, and the little
      leisure which Beal had lay in the lap of this devoted
      woman's shrewd loyalty. She was a sure buttress against
      fools and bores. She had the manners of a great lady, and
      an eye that never forgot a face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the dining-room, Parker?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir. In a quarter of an hour I shall come in to lay
      the table."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Carlyon Stretton, "Car" as he had been called at
      Cambridge, was a very different proposition from his elder
      brother. He was the younger brother, without John's
      sensitiveness and his reticencies, a rather frail man, but
      sanguine and full of vitality. He was energetic, generous,
      a hater of all humbug, one of those direct, spontaneous
      people who carry the world along.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive me waiting for you like a tout, Dr. Beal, but I'm
      worried about Jack. Can you give me five minutes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked at each other as men do when they like each
      other instinctively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down, my dear man. Parker is allowing you a quarter of
      an hour. We are all worried about Jack."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What I want you to tell me is, can I help, back you up in
      any way? I'm not here to fuss or to fiddle."
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal took the chair at the end of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fancy you understand," he said. "Your father and Mr.
      Reginald Stretton have both been here to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And they are both as blind as bats! No. Stretton Primus
      sees certain things clearly enough--but they are his
      things. I ought not to blackguard my brother."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat there with his alert easiness, smiling at Beal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I help? What I mean is, doctor, that a man in Jack's
      position needs help of a certain sort, the sort of
      unconscious help we gave each other during the war."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly," said Beal; "you could not have put it better."
    </p>
    <p>
      He picked up a magazine from the table, crumpled up a page,
      and then made a movement as of smoothing it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That sort of thing. Certain surroundings, certain people,
      some particular occupation. I am going to find out."
    </p>
    <p>
      The younger man nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Smoothing out the creases! Of course. But if I can help--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll tell you. I am spending the week-end at Esher. I want
      Jack to talk to me. I think he will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Car" rose, glancing at his wrist-watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have beaten Parker by exactly seven minutes. Good night,
      Beal. And thanks--ever so much."
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal lit a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much more work one could do," he thought, "if more
      people were like that."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    <h1>
      THE CASE OF JOHN STRETTON
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Rollin Beal spent his evenings in his library on the first
      floor, a room of cream and of old gold, calm, gracious and
      very still. The shelves were of oak, and Beal's visitors
      had often noticed the fact that there were no purely
      medical books upon these shelves. Everything worth reading
      in psychology was here, and beside the psychologists the
      novelists had a place. Or you could take down Mosso on
      Crete, or one of Stephen Graham's vividly personal
      pilgrimages, or the Life of Burton, or a volume of Keats,
      or a book on tapestry or English water-colour art. The
      humorists had a shelf to themselves in this varied and very
      human family of books, such masters of sly joy as Neil
      Lyons. If there was one thing Beal hated it was pedantry,
      especially the pedantry of superior people who will deign
      to write essays on the dead but lift a pompous leg over the
      living.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker cherished this room. When Beal came up from his
      dinner he found the big, amber-coloured corded velvet chair
      turned to the fire, with book-table and electric
      reading-lamp beside it, and always a bowl of flowers.
      To-night they were tawny-headed chrysanthemums. He had his
      coffee and his pipe. He read, or sometimes he wrote, unless
      the world could convince Parker that it had a human right
      to disturb him. After this very Stretton day he took up
      with him to the library one of his casebooks, and in it he
      renewed his friendship with John Stretton.
    </p>
    <p>
      For here, set down in Beal's rather psychic hand was a
      human picture of the man and his history. No detail was
      missing. As an alienist and a biographer Beal was most
      amazingly thorough, which is another way of saying that as
      a workman he was a lover. He had gathered his information
      from wherever it was to be found; he had gone in search of
      it, hunted for it with the patience of a zoologist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The record began with a short family history of the
      Strettons, good middle-class stock, with no trace of any
      mental taint. There was peasant blood on the mother's side
      in the person of Mrs. Stretton's mother, who had been the
      daughter of a yeoman farmer in Dorsetshire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bartholomew's children had all been healthy, normal
      youngsters, though the mother admitted that John had been a
      very sensitive boy and rather difficult, but at his public
      school he had played for the rugger team and held the
      school record for the hundred yards. Bartholomew, who was a
      shipping merchant, had retired from business about that
      time, and on leaving school John had been placed with a
      firm of underwriters.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had remained with them till August, 1914, when he had
      enlisted in a London Territorial regiment and begun his
      career as a soldier. This earlier picture showed him as a
      clean-living and slightly reserved young man, rather fonder
      of books and of long week-end rambles in Sussex and Surrey
      than he was of games, but quite without priggishness and
      never lacking a healthy sense of fun. He had had but one
      love affair, and that had come to grief in the war, nor had
      it left any serious scar behind it. Carlyon had handed over
      to Beal some of his younger brother's letters, and one or
      two casual references in them spoke of this broken romance
      without any bitterness or pique.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Beal's case-book the actual history of the affair opened
      with a letter--a characteristically breezy and vivid letter
      from a youngster--a Lieutenant Rendall, who had served
      under Stretton in B Company of the 5th Blanks. It was dated
      February, 1918.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "DEAR DR. BEAL,--Your letter was forwarded to me through
      Cox's. You have asked me to be quite frank, and I will try
      to tell you everything. I remember the day quite well, when
      Stretton was knocked out. I think you ought to know that we
      had been in the line for eight days and that we had had a
      most damnable time, for when you were holding captured
      ground the Germans gave you no rest, and you gave them the
      same. Bursts of savage shelling, counter-attacks to repel,
      the ground like chaos, everything
      difficult--water--rations--getting the wounded away!
      Stretton had been fine, but he was feeling the strain. We
      had a nasty angle to hold, and as a company officer he
      never spared himself.<br>
      <br>
      "It was about seven in the morning when the brigadier and
      the brigade-major turned up. I won't give you the
      brigadier's name. We called him 'Slaughterhouse.' I think
      he was about the stupidest man I have ever met; his neck
      was as thick as his head, and he had eyes like blue
      marbles. He hardly ever gave you a word of praise, and he
      was a bully.<br>
      <br>
      "We had had a particularly nasty night, the C.S.M. killed
      and a lot of men buried. Stretton and a corporal had
      crawled out just before dawn--Stretton shouldn't have gone
      by rights--and they had managed to get a good idea of where
      the Germans were. Stretton had just got back to company
      headquarters--two tin sheets over a hole--when
      'Slaughterhouse' blew in. Stretton had had no breakfast; he
      was worn to an edge, and you could see the red in his eye.
      And then 'Slaughterhouse' started scolding. Did Stretton
      know where the Boche front line was? Stretton told him. The
      brigadier said he was wrong; they couldn't be there.<br>
      <br>
      "I saw Stretton's face grow as thin as a knife; there was a
      blaze in his eyes, a sort of red rage--you know, at being
      hectored and hustled by this chap after we had had a hell
      of a time. Stretton knew; he'd been there, and he knew this
      other man didn't know. Well, I saw that row coming, and so,
      I think, did the brigade-major, who was an awful little
      sport. He tried to stop it, but Stretton blew up, and in
      twenty seconds he had said things to 'Slaughterhouse' which
      half the brigade would like to have said. And then that
      shell came. It covered us all with dirt. The brigade-major
      was killed, and Stretton knocked unconscious, but if he
      hadn't been knocked out that morning he would have been up
      for a court-martial, sure as fate--"
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Beal had added a note here.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The point to be remembered is that at the moment when
      Captain Stretton was 'shocked' he had been under very
      severe strain, and his self-restraint had given way. He was
      in a blind, red rage; there was a complete loss of
      self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Also, it is of significance that he had been attacked by
      what was probably to him a repulsive personality. It is
      probable that the two men were intensely antipathetic. It
      was a case of hate, the impulsive hatred of the finer
      nature for the coarser one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Follow up this point; it is interesting."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then followed a history of John Stretton's sojourn in
      various hospitals. There were extracts from case-sheets,
      quotations from letters written to Rollin Beal by one or
      two keen R.A.M.C. officers, the findings of various medical
      boards. Observations on Stretton's progress were jotted in
      since. "Slight tremor of the hands. Some sleeplessness. No
      mental clouding but a faint hesitancy in speech. Appetite
      and physical condition fairly good." Rollin Beal had
      included an incident which had occurred in a general
      hospital. Stretton had made a curiously unprovoked attack
      upon one of the orderlies, breaking his bed-table over the
      man's head. Beal had been unable to obtain more detail,
      either as to any possible provocation or as to the
      orderly's "physical type."
    </p>
    <p>
      The records became more and more encouraging. "No tremor.
      Sleep good, and without terrifying dreams. The hesitation
      in speech had disappeared. Physical condition excellent."
    </p>
    <p>
      This part of the history closed with Stretton's discharge
      from the service in December, 1918. His mental condition
      was given as normal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhere in April, 1919, Stretton had returned to his
      pre-war post with Messrs. Rome and Mallaby, living for a
      while with his people at Stow House, Esher, but this
      arrangement lasted less than two months. Beal had more than
      a suspicion that Stretton was bored by his people; at all
      events he broke free and took rooms in town. He appears to
      have pulled through the restless post-war period fairly
      well; he danced a good deal, spent his weekends on the
      river or in the country, and went to the theatre or a
      concert twice a week. He saw a good many women--but did not
      develop a very vivid passion for any particular woman. His
      attitude to life was rather negative. The war, like a
      severe spring frost, had nipped his youth, and the sap of
      his complete manhood had not yet risen with full force to
      his brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then that second outbreak had occurred. Beal had no
      doubt but that the breaking of a bed-table over some stupid
      orderly's head had been the first of the series pointing to
      that curious leak in Stretton's self-control. The affair
      occurred when he was trying to enter a crowded tube train;
      the train was just in motion, the gates were closed against
      him, and a rather officious platform attendant caught
      Stretton by the arm and pulled him back. Stretton turned on
      the man and knocked him down. He was summoned and fined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later Rollin Beal had taken the trouble to hunt out the
      attendant and to interview him. The man was florid, thick
      set, with glaring blue eyes and a brusque manner, a heavy
      and aggressive type. He bore no malice, and his account of
      the affair interested Beal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He came at me blind. When I got up I was going to give him
      one, but he stood there looking queer, his hands hanging
      down, just as though he had hit me in his sleep. I couldn't
      touch him, sir. It would have been like hitting a dead
      body."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rollin Beal's picture of the third and far more serious
      outburst was vividly personal. It was here that he had been
      brought into the affair to advise, to heal and to defend.
      He had seen it all so clearly, that foolish crowd pushing
      and elbowing to board a bus in Oxford Circus, and in it
      that square, red-faced man of five-and-fifty in a stubborn
      hurry to get home and quite determined to board that bus.
      Beal could visualize the stupid selfish shoulders of the
      man, the stare in his eyes, his complete insensitiveness
      increased during the war. Life had become more difficult,
      the routine of the day more of an animal struggle; the
      finer edge seemed blunted, and the women were as much
      affected as the men. Courtesy had disappeared. The herd
      does not feel; it stampedes and jostles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal could see it all: that heavy man, round-headed and
      bovine, heaving his elbow against a girl's breast. He must
      have touched Stretton, pushed against him in the obtuse
      selfishness of the scramble. And Stretton flared. Witnesses
      described his violence, his taking the other man by the
      throat and throwing him down into the gutter. When the
      police came he still struggled, and then suddenly stood
      still, trembling a little, obviously bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately for Stretton the man whom he had thrown
      against the kerb had a fractured skull. He was pushed into
      a taxi, and taken to the Middlesex Hospital. That he
      recovered was the one sop Fate threw to Stretton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal remembered the police court proceedings very well. He
      was there to give expert evidence and to explain to laymen
      how a man who had suffered as John Stretton had suffered
      could not be held wholly responsible for such an outburst.
      He could still see Stretton standing in the dock, a figure
      apart, brittle with the tension of it, but very still. His
      eyes had seemed to see everything and nothing. But the man
      in charge had remained unconvinced. These acts of "wanton
      violence," as he called them, had become too common. One
      might wish to make allowances for an ex-officer who had
      been wounded, but, after all--There was the previous
      conviction. The police and the public had to be protected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton was sent to prison for two months. An appeal was
      lodged and failed. Old Bartholomew and Reginald had had to
      negotiate with the man of the thick head and the thrustful
      elbows and fob him off with two hundred pounds in cash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rollin Beal put his case-book aside on the table and sat
      and stared at the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no need to ask himself the question: "Might it occur
      again?" Of course it might occur again. John Stretton had
      missed manslaughter by the narrowest of margins.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the explanation? Rollin Beal had translated his theory
      into simple and untechnical language for the benefit of
      Stretton's father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What I want to emphasize is that at the moment your son
      was 'shocked' his self-control had given way. Supposing we
      regard this self-control as a membrane--a piece of
      skin--stretched across a channel through which the vital
      force, or whatever you like to call it, flows. Imagine this
      membrane, this trap-door weakened, imagine a sort of leak
      in the brain, imagine our most primitive and savage
      impulses able to rush through this leak and produce sudden
      acts of uncontrollable violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, let us suppose this little trap-door weakened. It
      may be able to hold up against ordinary strains, but
      imagine some particular forcible impulse pushing against
      it, a particular impulse resembling the original thrust
      which broke it down. It gives way; something violent
      happens. That is how I read your son's case. As you know,
      he has a very vague recollection of what he does during
      these rare outbreaks. In every other way he is absolutely
      normal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some people might diagnose epilepsy. I do not. I prefer to
      regard the case as a weakening of self-control, a mental
      lesion, a thinking of the resistance to certain strains.
      Association is a great word with us, but I think I am
      growing too technical--"
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for the explanation to the father, but what of the
      salvation of the son?
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal lay deep in his chair, looking over his crossed legs
      at the red heat of the fire. Being a vitalist he had a
      reverence for instinct, that massive force at the back of
      consciousness. He believed that a man could be healed
      through instinct, by giving play to the healthy promptings
      of it. A wrong instinct, or rather an old and savage
      instinct, incompatible with modern life had pushed John
      Stretton to the edge of a precipice. The sudden lust to
      kill! The problem was to find its opposite, a creative,
      happy gentle spirit, and the atmosphere in which it could
      function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal the man was touched as deeply as Beal the doctor was
      interested. John Stretton was so very likeable, such a fine
      weapon twisted and blunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      What to suggest? Yes, there came the rub!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he had a feeling that John Stretton's intuition might
      help him, the instinct of the wounded thing towards the
      herb that would heal it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intuition! That which is greater and more subtle than
      reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have got to find out," he thought, "what his inclination
      is."
    </p>

    <p>
      Stow House, Esher, was very much what Rollin Beal might
      have expected it to be, save that it was white instead of
      red. Its chimneys and slate roofs were visible from the
      road, but you won no complete view of the house until you
      had passed through the blue gates hung on white pillars,
      and rounded a bank of rhododendrons and conifers. Then the
      house burst upon you suddenly, smiling its broad white
      smile at the end of a lawn which had the colour and the
      flatness of a billiard table. It was an obvious house and
      it said the obvious thing. "Here I am! Yes, I am feeling
      very well, thank you." It had the appearance of being
      polished, for it had been repainted that spring. The polish
      extended to the drive and the garden, where everything was
      patted and raked and rolled into superlative neatness, and
      no errant autumn leaf was suffered to skip and whirl to the
      music of the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal had one glimpse of old Stretton's house standing there
      in its white waistcoat before the slowly rolling car
      carried him up the long drive and showed him the figure of
      a young man moving slowly along the front of the herbaceous
      border on the far side of the lawn. The attitude of the
      figure was curious. The man carried a stick. He kept
      pausing and hitting at something with the stick just as
      though he were knocking off the heads of flowers. He did
      not appear to hear the car, or if he did he took no notice
      of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal was dropped into the porch, a classic thing with two
      solid white pillars. A maid stood at the door, ready to
      receive him and his suit-case from the chauffeur. The large
      hall had a Turkey carpet, a soft and very comfortable
      carpet like everything else in the house of Bartholomew
      Stretton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid, setting down the suit-case, took Beal's hat,
      scarf and coat. She said nothing. She was all detachment,
      thoroughly impersonal. She opened the door of the
      drawing-room and for the first time Beal heard her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Rollin Beal."
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman rose to meet him, giving him the impression that
      she had been sitting on the edge of a chair for the last
      half-hour, waiting to get up and make a speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am so very glad to see you, Dr. Beal; I am so grateful
      to you for coming."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Stretton's wife had blue eyes and grey hair, a weak
      mouth, the lips rather pouched out over prominent teeth.
      She was thin, tallish, long in the waist, with a back which
      seemed to bend easily, too easily. Her attitude was one of
      amiability, an amiability that was without insight or
      discretion, and smiled the same smile at coalheavers or
      kings. She was a woman who made a mystery of things without
      having any grasp of the essential mystery of everything.
      She had a pathetic little trick of trying to appear very
      shy and sweetly knowing, just as though she were trying to
      mystify and hoodwink some eternal child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must apologise for my husband. He has gone to golf, but
      he went on purpose. Of course, you understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down, uneasily, looking at him with a conspirator's
      smile. Beal sat down opposite her in this pink room of
      hers, pink in its cretonnes, its carpet, its light shades,
      its roses on the wall, like the artificial pinkness of her
      pleasant and unmysterious life. She was a good woman, a
      very limited woman, but Beal had a feeling that she would
      be saved by her good nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      "John is in the garden. It is such a relief to feel that
      you are here, Dr. Beal. It has been a terrible time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal very gently assured her that it must have been, and
      then he tried to find out whether the mother had any
      intuitive knowledge of what was passing in the mind of her
      son. She was ready to talk, eager to talk; unlike her
      husband, she had not been irritated by having so painful a
      problem forced upon her affections at a time of life when
      people expect to be able to relax. She was an affectionate
      woman; John had always been her favourite, but the affair
      had bewildered her. She could make nothing of it save that
      it seemed part of "that terrible and wicked war."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was obvious to Beal that she had been hurt by her son's
      fierce reticence. She did not understand it; she said so.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's so funny, doctor. We have done all that we can think
      of to make him feel that we are just the same as ever, that
      we know that he couldn't help what happened, and that the
      old home is home. He won't talk to us."
    </p>
    <p>
      She shed a few tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had his old room ready for him--just as it used to be. I
      did everything. There were all the old books he used to
      love, and the picture of Dante and Beatrice. He never said
      a word! He hardly speaks to us at all. Oh, it has hurt me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal's kind eyes glanced towards one of the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must not think too much of this silence. Some men,
      Mrs. Stretton, hate showing any emotion. They hide it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why from me? Isn't a mother a man's best friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not answer, "Sometimes, but not often," and so he
      turned the conversation towards the object of his visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to see as much of John as I can. Men sometimes talk
      to doctors. That mustn't make you jealous. We are fellow
      conspirators, Mrs. Stretton."
    </p>
    <p>
      She rallied to that, and getting up with her air of sweet
      knowingness, tiptoed to the window and peeped out. She made
      a mystery of it, as she made a mystery of everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he is still there. Now what on earth is he doing with
      that stick?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The stoop showed in her figure. She drooped over the
      eternal child idea, blindly sentimental even when a grown
      man raged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you would like to go out to John?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal welcomed the suggestion, and he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Autumn has a way of coming into a garden with a broad sweep
      of the hand, a gesture of liberation, of a queen claiming
      her own. A wild beauty returns, and with it a touch of
      sadness; the last flowers hang heavy with dew; the leaves
      are yellowing on the stems; man's ordered neatness becomes
      a tangle, a mystery. But in this garden of the Strettons
      man still held his own, defying autumn with a forest of
      green stakes and a spider-work of bass, with scissors and
      hoe, lawn-sweeper and broom. In it Beal heard the voice of
      the conventional soul, the soul which has a horror of
      mystery and of the uncomfortable and changeful, things it
      cannot understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Security--security! Let us have chrysanthemums in pots.
      Let us stake the dahlias, and parade the begonias like bits
      of coloured tin in rows. Let us have our bacon and eggs at
      nine o'clock each morning, and our bridge at nine each
      night. Security--comfortable security. Great goddess, we
      love thee."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rounding a bank of Michaelmas daisies, sheaves of green
      starred white and rose and purple, Beal came upon a living
      protest against the Stretton worship of security. Old
      Bartholomew loved labels; if he could read the name of a
      thing he felt that he knew all about it, and there were
      times in the year when the Stretton garden grew labels and
      no flowers. Neat white pegs stuck in everywhere, or little
      zinc lockets dangling from the throats of the bushes and
      the trees. And here was Jack Stretton with his stick
      swiping deliberately at every label within reach, sending
      them flying out of the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal felt relieved. It was as though a black panther had
      got into a suburban back garden and was making things
      interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, doctor!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal saw the other man's eyes light up. Often it had been
      Beal's experience to be met with suspicion, for those who
      are sick in mind may see in the physician the judge and
      arbiter, the man who can deny to them the precious
      privilege of sanity. Beal knew that look, the animal's fear
      of the cage, but Stretton's eyes met his without distrust.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad you've come."
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a last swipe at a label.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at these fool things!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he faced Beal, smiling slightly, the lovable
      rebel, a man whose eyes had a deadly sincerity. He was not
      asking anybody to perpetuate illusions. He knew his own
      danger, and it was probable that he realized his own
      immediate helplessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The pater's at golf."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know," said Beal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have seen my mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She suggested I should come out here."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at John Stretton. He felt that he had never seen
      him so vividly, so much himself, the slim, tallish,
      whipcord figure, the brittle blue-grey eyes, the head held
      rather high with its intelligent and slightly sloping
      forehead and pointed chin suggesting movement and the
      forward urge and uplift of the prow of a ship. The figure
      was a little defiant. It confronted things that were
      calculable and incalculable. There was something about it
      too that suggested helplessness, appeal, a look that
      touched Beal very deeply. It was like youth, wounded,
      suffering, proud, crying with its dumb eyes: "Doctor, get
      me out of this!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton glanced at the house with its flat, white smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everything is dead here, you know, dead as--"
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he swung round again and faced Beal. "Look here, I
      have got to talk. If I don't--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," said Beal, "that's what I have come for. I'm
      glad."
    </p>
    <p>
      They began to wander up and down together, and Beal noticed
      that Stretton kept as far away from the house as possible,
      favouring the stretch of grass beyond the cedar. He was
      restless, extremely restless. He kept prodding the ground
      with his stick. Now that he could talk and had the very man
      to whom he could talk unconstrainedly, he found himself
      inarticulate. He just blurted things with a half brutal
      boyish sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I feel I want to get out of the whole damned show. But I'm
      tied up in it. Just like this garden with all those
      infernal labels."
    </p>
    <p>
      He swung about and looked almost fiercely at Beal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't try and gloze things over, doctor. I'm sick of this
      'hush camp.' I'm a case. I'm not afraid of facing it; one
      got used to that out there."
    </p>
    <p>
      He smacked with his stick at a branch of the decorous
      cedar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, after all those years, to come back as a potential
      murderer, a sort of live shell which everybody is afraid
      of! It sounds absurd, doesn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal said quietly that nothing is absurd except ignorance
      and conceit, and the vulgarity which does not know that it
      is vulgar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are going to get well, Jack."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Stretton blazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But not here. Don't think me a beast, but look at that
      damned house! Just look at it, like a fat, respectable
      stomach! I tell you what it is, Beal, I see things too
      clearly. The pater is the kindest-hearted old soul, but
      there are times when he hates me. I'm a thing which every
      decent middle-class person hates, a problem, like the
      unemployed, you know, or the ex-soldier. We are always in
      such a hurry to forget uncomfortable things, and I'm an
      uncomfortable thing. Poor old dad; he gets me at breakfast;
      he gets me in the morning paper. He has reached the age
      when he wants to potter, and he can't forget that he has a
      live shell in the house."
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed, a laugh which made Beal wince.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then there's the mater! Poor old mater! She goes about
      on tiptoe; she's always watching me and pretending she's
      not watching me; I believe she would like to have
      everything padded with feather beds. All the while she has
      been wanting me to do the goody book thing, get down on my
      knees and put my head in her lap and blub. And I can't,
      Beal. And I know it hurts her. She doesn't understand. I
      don't want to be sentimental about myself; I want to fight,
      man, fight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you shall, my dear chap."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton calmed down a little after that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After all, it's not their fault. They are only part of the
      scheme of things. They are kind; most people are kind, but
      the bother is they don't know how to be kind in the right
      way. And there is no getting away from the fact that I'm a
      nuisance, an infernal problem. There is only one person who
      has made me really mad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who's that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That blessed brother of mine, Reginald. He's a selfish
      swine, Beal. Excuse my language; I'm not quite nice and
      civilized again yet. I call a spade a spade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't worry about Reginald. Carlyon understands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Car's a sport," and he gave a flourish of the stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice lost its note of resentment. He had exploded; he
      had said things which he had been spoiling to say, and he
      felt better for it; he had said them to a man who
      understood the psychological virtue of a good curse or a
      grumble. "Blessed are those who curse, for they shall be
      eased with words." A gentler mood descended upon him. He
      was still the rebel who retained his sense of honour. He
      paused by the cedar, his hands stuffed into the pockets of
      his old brown Norfolk jacket, his stick cocked under one
      arm and protruding behind his shoulder, an old war attitude
      unconsciously assumed. His face and eyes softened. He
      looked at the white house almost with a glimmer of
      tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's got rid of the daily hate. What surprises me
      most, doctor, is how we change. Five years ago I was quite
      fond of this place. I accepted it then; I hadn't begun the
      clash with people. But now--I feel I can't think here or
      get a grip on anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at his wrist-watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, would you care for a walk? Or, what's better, I
      might get Smith to run us out to Wisley in the car. He can
      drop us and go back to fetch the pater, and we can idle
      about in the woods and walk home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellent idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It won't bore you? We shall miss tea, and we shall not be
      back till after dark."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not often bored," said Beal, "if that is any comfort
      to you. Go and fix up with Smith for the car."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

      STRETTON FEELS HIS HANDS
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The car dropped them on Ockham Common, and Stretton turned
      straight from the black road to the heather.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's get off the track," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They made for a great knoll covered with Scots firs. A soft
      autumnal sunset was very near, and the level rays of the
      sun lay gently on these splendid trees, lighting up the
      rust-red and orange of their throats and powdering their
      green tops with gold. There was no wind moving. The slopes
      of the hillock were slippery with fallen fir needles. The
      place had an intense stillness, and Beal--very sensitive to
      all impressions--felt that when they passed in among the
      tree trunks a curtain of mystery fell behind them. The road
      was less than a hundred yards away, and full of the haste
      and hootings of many cars heading Londonwards after the
      Saturday rush somewhere out and somewhere home. And yet the
      road and its machine-made life did not seem to matter. On
      the knoll with its soaring trees life was on a different
      plane, and these hooting hurrying things belonged to a
      cruder and a more material world.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat down among the firs. Stretton, with his arms about
      his knees, seemed interested for the moment in watching the
      stampede upon the road. Cars of every type and colour went
      by, like shuttles attached to a black thread, and shot
      mechanically from one point to another. Motor-bicycles
      detonated and buzzed among and between the larger beasts of
      the herd. The whole road seemed to flow from nowhere to
      nowhere. And yet this stream of restlessness had a
      fascination, an ironical suggestiveness, the haste of
      people escaping from something. And what was that
      something? Themselves, boredom, the thoughts that might
      come to them in a solitary place? Did they drive, or were
      they driven?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you notice anything, doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton's face was tilted, and there were faint lines
      about his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is all profile," said Beal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the very word. I have been watching those people,
      and I have seen only one face turned this way. They look
      straight up the road. Do you think they see anything else?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps not. Most people are in such a hurry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speeding up the Deity, what, till he becomes an Ike in a
      forty horse-power car! I wonder what pleasure they get out
      of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, something," said Beal; "tree philosophy isn't
      fashionable. That's the crowd's idea of progress."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton stood up. He leant against the trunk of a fir, and
      his eyes went to the tree tops, while one hand moved to and
      fro with a caressing motion, the figures rubbing against
      the bark. His face was very much softer; it had lost its
      expression of strain and of fierce bafflement, and to Beal
      his slim, tallish figure became one with the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I feel that I want to get away from that sort of crowd,
      Beal, from the whole machine-made show. And yet I am tied
      up in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes left the tree tops and met Beal's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you see, I haven't a shilling. Even my tobacco comes
      out of the governor's pocket. Pretty humiliating after four
      years of war, and I am still rather proud. We were proud
      out there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you say 'still'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doesn't pride wear rather thin when the world rubs you to
      the bone? I've been told so. And I have seen it pretty
      threadbare--men turned spongers for the sake of someone
      else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it depends," said Beal; "I remember a poor devil
      telling me he couldn't afford to be proud; but he had pride
      of a sort; he shot himself. You are not going to do that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton looked at him, and his eyes held a challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. There are two sorts of suicide, the reasoned
      considered suicide, and the suicide of impulse. But--bosh,
      my dear chap, life's too good; fill up your pipe."
    </p>
    <p>
      He brought out his own pipe, and standing up stood looking
      towards the further woods with the glow of the sunset upon
      them. His face seemed to grow luminous in sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just that," he said, pointing with the stem of his pipe,
      "and dozens of things like that. We talk such a lot of
      drivel at times, but get down to bedrock. There are things
      that matter, and matter so deucedly, that they won't let us
      alone. We simply can't chuck in our hands. Don't you
      believe that there is something behind it all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know, Beal. Do you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal was filling his pipe. He lit a match, and holding the
      flame to the tobacco, sucked steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just as much as I believe my tobacco will burn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought no scientific people would allow--Of course,
      there are exceptions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pretty good exceptions. What about Pasteur, for instance?
      Was ever a man more thorough as a scientist? Was there ever
      a man who helped humanity as he did? Look here, Jack, about
      fifty years ago the scientific school got swelled head; it
      was bumptious and aggressive, and it had excuses, but that
      swelled headedness has been coming down. Now we are allowed
      to mention a thing called intuition. I believe in
      intuition. I believe some of the older people used to call
      it faith."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith in what?" said Stretton with a slightly defiant lift
      of the chin; "that we are the best sort of people in the
      best sort of world!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal stood a moment with the bowl of his pipe gripped in
      one hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; that we are here to learn, that we have been here
      before, and that we shall be here again. But come on,
      reincarnation or no reincarnation, I want a walk."
    </p>
    <p>
      He plunged down the hill, carrying his hat in his hand, and
      Stretton went after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, doctor, one moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal paused on the low bank surrounding the mound. His face
      still had its luminous distant look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you really believe that we are here to be taught?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do. It is the only belief which explains things, pain,
      and disease, and poverty, and wars, and love, and that
      something in us which is always reaching out to that which
      is felt but not seen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean, that if we go on being vulgar and beastly and
      selfish, and refuse to learn, we are bunged back into life
      until we do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that's mysticism!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of your father's labels! What's behind, beyond? Come
      along."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had one glimpse of Stretton's face as they turned
      together towards the further woods where the yellow bracken
      foamed at the feet of the trees. It was a face which seemed
      to flash out at life like a suddenly uncovered lamp. The
      man had a look of swiftness, of the runner suddenly leaping
      forward towards a new horizon which a lifting fog had
      uncovered. He seemed to hold his breath for a moment, and
      then to breath more deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beal, I was going to ask you a question, but now I am
      wondering whether I ought to ask it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should ask it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think it is ever going to happen again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not look at his companion, but walked straight
      forward with his eyes on the woods, nor did he see the
      contraction of Beal's forehead, or realize the other man's
      struggle with a sudden temptation. Beal believed in
      suggestion, but there were occasions when suggestion might
      be a dangerous lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may."
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke quietly, but quickly, a deft surgeon doing what he
      had to do and knowing that he was inflicting pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may, and it may not. I don't want to use a lot of
      technical language. Supposing I say that you came out of
      the war with a mental wound, and that the wound has not
      quite healed, but that there is no reason why it should not
      be healed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," said Stretton, still looking into the distance and
      brushing the bracken with his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were moving slowly up the slope of a hill with their
      backs to the sunset, and at the top of the hill they turned
      and looked back. The knoll across the valley stood outlined
      against the sky, its black trees rising in a sheaf with the
      red sun in their midst. The stretches of faded heather were
      full of reds and purples.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it does matter," said Stretton very softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked on under the autumnal trees, and for a while
      Stretton had a silent fit upon him; he was feeling things,
      not thinking about them; the mood was intuitive, much as
      Rollin Beal had wished it to be. There are some problems
      that cannot be reasoned out, others that can be argued
      about till they become dead and formal. Life is otherwise;
      it strikes a sudden blow on the hot iron, it comes with a
      rush of spring sunlight from behind a cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton began to talk. At first he seemed to be groping
      his way, but in a little while he saw life clearly, and his
      voice grew stronger and more assured.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems to me that I have got to break away on my own.
      You have to sail your own ship on your own sea. I feel that
      I want to get right away--in among a lot of trees. I don't
      need people; people irritate me, but if I have to have
      people I should like them to be people who do things,
      simple things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I see all that," said Beal.
    </p>
    <p>
      They emerged upon a sandy lane, and Stretton turned to the
      right.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know a quiet way back, away from those cars."
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked with his head up, and with a new air of
      elasticity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Machines seem to pick up the personalities of the people
      who use them. They cease to be things. Do you know what I
      mean? Yes, of course you do. People get on my nerves, Beal,
      the modern people who rush about and who can't sit still.
      Things don't, things like trees and plants and tools. I
      like to look at them, handle them. They seem to give you
      something which a lot of chattering, newspaper humans never
      do."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he stretched out his hands, arms stiff, fingers
      extended. His spread fingers closed upon his palms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I feel that I want to use my hands, hold things, you know,
      work with them. It's as though I had a crave in me for that
      sort of life. Do you understand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly. It's somewhere in your blood and marrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dusk fell upon them in the lane as it went from woodland to
      meadow and from meadow to woodland, the autumn colouring of
      the hedgerows growing dim like the colours in an old and
      faded picture. The sky, streaked with red under a shelf of
      purple cloud, changed to pale gold. Stretton's face seemed
      to stand out from it with a glowing meditative seriousness.
      Even when the darkness came his face retained a suggestion
      of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that is the idea, that is the feeling I have. It is
      not that I am funking my fellow men. I had plenty of
      solitude in jail, and I am not afraid of solitude; in fact,
      I think I want it. I'm strong, physically, and pretty hard.
      I don't get worried about the weather."
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a good sign, isn't it? Now where does all this lead
      to, doctor? There must be a particular sort of life which
      would help me to make good. Do you agree?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly. Put your inclination into words."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I feel that I would like to own a bit of land, a bit of
      rather wild land, with some wood and heather. There might
      be a cottage, or I would put up a shack of my own. I would
      teach myself to grow things and to make things. In time I
      would learn to farm in a small way. Do you see the sort of
      life I mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal walked for fifty yards before answering him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, why not?" And then he added: "But it is not going to
      be an easy life."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton understood him at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think that a man who has been used to knocking about
      town would be bored, that he could not tackle a quiet life
      like that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It depends on the man. I would back nine men out of ten to
      fail."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doesn't it depend on what is inside the man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has got to be extraordinarily interested in things, and
      not very interested in people."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that's true. But I am extraordinarily interested in
      things, Beal. I have found that out. It is part of my
      temperament."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And it is an extraordinarily happy one, and a rather rare
      one. Well, why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton was silent for some seconds. Even in the darkness
      Beal felt a recrudescence of his spirit of defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is one big obstruction."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, money."
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow Beal had expected this, and was not unprepared for
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Supposing your father financed you, bought you a little
      place and settled so much capital on you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't that sponging? I don't think that I could swallow
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your medicine, my dear chap, your medicine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But isn't it a rotten sort of thing to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you can include me among the rotters. Do you know
      that my dear old dad gave me a hard-earned five thousand
      and gave it me when he was alive. 'Look here, Roll,' he
      said to me, 'here's a stepping-stone. I am pretty sure you
      will know how to use it.' I did use it. And it saved me ten
      years of useless drudgery and waiting. What I have managed
      to do in the years I have had would have been halved, Jack,
      without that precious freedom, the power to work, to think,
      to investigate, to follow one's own inspiration. It was a
      gift of the gods. And do you think I forget it? That, and
      the memory of the man who gave it are solid facts under
      one's feet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton had a quick answer to this, a generous answer with
      the edge of it against himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but look at the difference. You had a career; I'm a
      cracked pot to be put carefully in a corner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stretton," said Beal, swinging round on him and catching
      him by the arm, "get away from self-pity; it's the very
      devil. It's the beginning of a man's decadence. Now I'll
      give you a straight choice."
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood in the dark lane, looking at each other in one
      of those swift silences.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your father is a rich man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I take it that you expected to inherit something? Well, if
      he offers to give it you now--why be over-squeamish and
      difficult about it? Money is not dirty. We--the users of
      it--are either clean or dirty."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton's head dropped slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks, Beal," he said; "but do you mind if I make one
      stipulation? I should like someone in the family to say yes
      or no to it. Do you understand me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Supposing we put it to Car?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I will take Car's verdict. He's straight and he
      understands."
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked on into the darkness, while some five miles
      away John Stretton's father, the happy conqueror of some
      old bunny like himself, came out into the soft autumn night
      and found Smith ready with his motoring coat. The light
      from the doorway fell on Bartholomew's chubby face, his
      grey sports coat, yellow cardigan and baggy breeches. In
      one pocket bulged the three-shilling ball he had won; he
      always took such trophies home and showed them to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice came out of the vestibule:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about to-morrow, Stretton? My revenge, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bartholomew's face crumpled a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry; I've got a visitor; I'm afraid I can't desert him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all right. What about next Saturday at two-thirty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right you are. It's a fixture."
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith helped him on with his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Beal arrive all right, Smith?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir. He's out for a walk with Mr. John."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ran them to Ockham, sir, and they are walking home."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bartholomew Stretton got into the car, and Smith wrapped a
      rug round his legs. Old Stretton's right hand felt the golf
      ball in his coat pocket. The car was swinging round across
      the drive, the light from its headlights flashing on the
      leaves of the laurels and the rhododendrons. Stretton
      stared straight ahead. His mind flickered with a patchwork
      of very human reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If only we can settle the boy's future! So disturbing!
      Anyhow, I beat Lambrick--three and two. That's the fifth
      ball I've won off him. He thought he had me cold at the
      thirteenth! Yes, I had John on my mind there. I wonder if
      Beal has any idea? Very sound man, Beal. Three and two! Not
      so bad when I was down at the thirteenth! I must show Lavie
      the ball; she'll be pleased. She has been so upset about
      John. Now, what the devil are we to do? We must do
      something."

    </p>
    <p>
      The Stretton <i>mnage</i> interested Beal. He came down to
      Lavinia Stretton's pink drawing-room, and found two women
      by the fire. Mrs. Stretton had introduced Beal to her
      daughter, a ruddy young woman with very white teeth who got
      up from a pink tuffet with the briskness of a boy and gave
      Beal a hard and vigorous hand. He was alone with them for
      five minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      John's mother would have made a mystery of those five
      minutes, but the daughter with her ruddy and unmysterious
      face stood with two solid feet on such flimsies, and looked
      Beal straight in the eyes. He could see her in brogues,
      despising shin-pads, leading her forwards and smiting hard
      and true.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Stretton asked Beal if he had enjoyed his walk. She
      conspired with him in asking the question, giving him a
      little sly upward flicker of the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The autumn tints were beautiful, I'm sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      The daughter's impulse was to blow such sentimentalities to
      tatters. She looked at her mother with her stalwart and
      rather swashbuckling sureness, and her air of "Mater, don't
      talk such tosh."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expect it bucked John up."
    </p>
    <p>
      She bounced down again on the tuffet, and let it be known
      quite frankly that John needed bucking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's a jolly sight too introspective."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother threw a deprecating, reassuring glance at Beal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Bartholomew came in, cuddling something in his left
      hand. He was pink from a hot bath, genial, ready for his
      dinner, and in a mood to hope that Beal would be able to
      prove this the best of all possible worlds. He sidled to
      the mantelpiece and deposited something round and white on
      the bottom of an upturned Chelsea cup. He had an air of
      expectancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife knew what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Bart, you've won again! Another ball!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Stretton glanced casually at the trophy as though he
      had been thinking of Einstein's theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that! Took it off poor old Lambrick."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They will have to lower your handicap," said his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the way, Dad," asked the daughter, "what is your
      handicap? Old Lambrick used to be a rotten twenty-two."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such are our children, and Beal made a mental note of the
      young woman's temperamental flatness. He preferred the
      mother, at any rate, so far as cooperation was concerned,
      for even if she did not understand her son she wanted to
      understand him, and she was eager to help.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Stretton had taken the hearthrug and was snubbing his
      daughter by talking exclusively to Beal. Now and again he
      glanced at the door. He still looked expectant, but like a
      man who was waiting for an unpleasant telegram.
    </p>
    <p>
      John came in. He looked at no one in particular. His mouth
      was curved in a smile, an absent, impersonal smile, elusive
      and slightly mischievous, and reminding Beal very vividly
      of a picture he once had seen of a gentle and satirical
      faun looking out of a mass of dusky foliage at a naked girl
      combing her hair. He brought something elusive and eternal
      into the room, something that was before time, a suggestion
      of moonlight among old sacred trees, of naiads dancing, of
      the grail shining in the deeps of a wild wood. There was a
      spirit in him which listened to a sound of stirring in a
      forest at dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father glanced at him nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, John, well! Had a good walk?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Splendid."
    </p>
    <p>
      He replied with an empty voice, and he went and stood
      beside his mother. Beal saw them smile at each other; Mrs.
      Stretton went as pink as her cushions. Her son's eyes had
      some message for her; there was a sudden kinship of feeling
      between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madge Stretton looked at her brother as she might have
      looked at a man who had lost a race through being out of
      training. She had the hard, bright colour of to-day. She
      measured a man's success.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Buck up, John!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not utter her favourite cry, but it was there in
      her hard, frank, sexless eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gong rang, and they went in to dinner. Beal was on Mrs.
      Stretton's right, John on her left, and Beal was aware of
      something passing between these two, a quick and
      half-puzzled glance of the son's, a smile in the mother's
      eyes, and then an answering smile in the son's.
      Bartholomew, with white shirt-front and rosy face, sat like
      a chairman at a board meeting, slightly self-conscious and
      judicial. Madge did not utter a word throughout the meal.
      She had been put off her game--as she might have expressed
      it--by seeing a really impressive looking man showing an
      interest in her mother. She wondered why.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal made the dinner table a field of manoeuvre. He wanted
      the party to split into two pairs, and for that self-sure
      young woman to be eliminated. He was so quick a gatherer of
      impressions that by the end of the meal he knew what he
      wanted, and when John went to open the door for his mother,
      Beal, with an almost excessive politeness, followed as
      though to share in the act. John had half-closed the door
      when he caught Beal's eye and that slight movement of the
      big, shapely head.
    </p>
    <p>
      John's glance at his father put a question. "You want me to
      clear out?" it said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal answered it in a half-whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go and tell her everything--what your idea is. Your
      mother, I mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      John looked at him searchingly. Then he nodded and went
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rollin Beal returned to the table and helped himself to
      port. Bartholomew had risen, and Beal saw his broad,
      comfortable back in the corner where his cigar cabinet
      stood on a walnut side table. He came back with two boxes
      of cigars and a tin of cigarettes, his knowledge of their
      choiceness swelling in him happily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have a cigar, Beal. Try one of these."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks. I will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! John has gone? Oh, perhaps it's as well."
    </p>
    <p>
      His blue eyes looked at Beal with a clouded and almost
      furtive expectancy. After dinner and with a cigar between
      his lips a man hopes for comfortable news.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very grateful to you for coming, and so is my wife.
      It's unusual, I know, for you big men to take so much
      trouble. A match? Here you are. I hear you and John had a
      walk?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal knew so very well what was to be conjectured in
      Bartholomew Stretton's mind. There is not a man who does
      not wish to have his anxiety relieved, to hear comfortable
      news, to find the expert, the magician who will lift the
      bugbear of an unexpected responsibility from his shoulders.
      But would Bartholomew Stretton pay the price? Beal had no
      intention of being too comfortable in his attempt to
      persuade an old man to sympathize with the unconventional
      tendencies of a young one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to speak to you about John. We had a long talk this
      afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he did talk, did he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very seriously. I think all this silence of his has been a
      sort of preparation. He realizes his own danger."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bartholomew began to fidget at the word "danger." Here was
      this mass of high explosive still very much of a reality in
      the house!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he realizes that, does he? Have you any idea, Beal--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "John has his own idea. I think I agree with it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Stretton said "Ha!" and blinked his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean that he understands why he flies into these
      rages?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; but he has a very strong inclination towards a certain
      life which he feels may cure him. What I mean is, he thinks
      he can make his own medicine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What sort of life?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And Beal told him. He put the case very simply and very
      strongly, and yet Bartholomew Stretton seemed unable or
      unwilling to understand it. He met the suggestion with an
      air of puzzled hostility. As a practical man he had
      expected to be given some nice scientific formula, a plan
      all prettily drawn out like a scheme for the
      electrification of a railway or the building of a house. He
      had the pill-box mind. This whim of his son's seemed
      preposterous, futile, utterly unconvincing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean to tell me that he wants to bury himself in a
      ditch? My dear sir, I should have thought that it was the
      very worst thing possible, messing about with nothing to
      do, all by himself. Besides, there's no career in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal's face had a look of patient austerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It depends on what you call a career. There is that other
      career to be remembered. I have warned you where it may
      end."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my dear sir--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bartholomew had the appearance of enlarging himself like a
      frog refusing to be swallowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you say you approved of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe in the instincts of the impulse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--instinct. I thought that only dogs and animals--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A dog knows when to eat grass."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bartholomew was touched by that. He could not follow Beal's
      psychology, but he could appreciate something which he
      himself had seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like Nebuchadnezzar," he said with vague sententiousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he surrendered. The part of him which had
      clamoured to have something done prevailed over the part of
      him which loathed what he called a pig in a poke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It sounds absurd. What do you want me to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Buy him a little place in the country, and settle a small
      income on him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bartholomew jibbed once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What--lay out a lot of capital!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't call it unproductive capital," said Beal. "After
      all, the boy gave his youth, and we--we still have our
      capital."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had him. It was not that old Stretton was ungenerous,
      but he had the conventional man's hatred of the
      impractical, the unusual, the obscure. Yet, even in full
      retreat, he hoisted his usual flag, the female petticoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before anything is settled I should like to consult my
      wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal had been waiting for this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I agree with you. Supposing we ask Mrs. Stretton to join
      us, and John too."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bartholomew gave him a suspicious glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think--my wife--alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you go to her, and I shall make John play me at
      billiards? By the way, it was a suggestion of John's that
      Carlyon should be consulted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Reginald! Why not Reginald?" asked old Stretton with a
      lift of the eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ask your wife about it," said Beal. "Women sometimes have
      a knack of understanding these things."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bartholomew found his wife and son in the library sitting
      on the big leather sofa before the fire. Someone had
      switched off the lights--a woman's hand, no doubt, and old
      Stretton turned them on again. He saw that his wife had
      been crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      "John, Dr. Beal would like a game of billiards."
    </p>
    <p>
      With John out of the room, and sent thence with a little
      mysterious nod from his mother, Bartholomew stood on the
      hearthrug and confronted his wife. He hated tears; they
      made him uncomfortable, and Lavinia had always been a very
      comfortable woman. She had not inflicted too much emotion
      upon him. They were very fond of each other, and their
      comradeship was a plant of quiet and sure growth. They had
      never had a serious quarrel; both of them loved peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to have a talk about John. Beal has been suggesting
      what seems to me a most unpractical idea--a little place in
      the country, miles from anywhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, why not, dear?" asked the wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Stretton stared at her, and swayed from foot to foot,
      assuring himself that the solid floor was under his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know about it," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "John has been telling me. I think it is a beautiful idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Stretton had nothing to say about the beauty of the
      idea. He was not a connoisseur of beauty, but he did feel
      like a practical man who is being persuaded into some
      mad-cat scheme against his business sense. He began to
      argue, quite gently, with his wife, but he found her
      amazingly obstinate--eloquently obstinate. She was feeling
      the affair very deeply, and she involved her husband in her
      feeling of it. She soon had him slipping and floundering,
      and blurting out fragments of affectionate nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, there, Lavie, I only want to do what is best for
      the boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He must have his chance, Bart," she said. "I don't say I
      understand it all, but I--feel--that he is right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beal seems to think as you do."
    </p>
    <p>
      She digressed to utter a panegyric on Beal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has a beautiful nature, Bart. Haven't you noticed his
      eyes--how they seem to look right down into everything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband pulled his nose judicially, but could not say
      that he had.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A remarkable man, no doubt. So we are to let John have his
      bit of woodland and his cottage. We'll do the thing
      thoroughly when we do do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Stretton got up and kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have always been very kind and generous to me, Bart--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense; I've liked it," he said, and began to cough and
      blink a little. "Bother this smoke. I think these cigars
      are a bit on the strong side."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned about and threw the stump into the fire, and
      while he was doing it his wife made an excursion to the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll fetch John," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal was leaning over the table, making a stroke, when the
      door opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "John, dear--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal made his cannon and walked along the table with his
      back to the door. He appeared to take a long time
      considering the next shot, and when he played it he muffed
      it. His face lit up with that peculiarly luminous smile of
      his. He turned a cautious head and glanced over his
      shoulder. He was alone in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that's that," he said.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h1>
      BURNT HEATH
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It was a still and misty day in December when John Stretton
      first saw Burnt Heath and the Scots firs of the Hadworth
      Woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Ford car carried them out of Kingsbury and along the
      valley of the Weybourne, and, climbing steadily till the
      willows and the meadow country sank into the silver of the
      winter haze, lifted them nearer to the veiled sun. The
      landscape enlarged itself. The down country in the south
      was banked grey-blue against a dove-grey sky. Wild heaths
      seemed to smoke, struggling mistily with the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Willowmaston the road dropped again into beech-woods and
      deep meadows, a brick and timber place with one or two old
      red houses looking out from gardens and park lands, English
      country, very green in the spring of the year. Beyond it
      the road grew sandier, trailing a pale yellow between thorn
      hedges and little farmsteads with their fields and
      orchards, pleasant and secret places where people might
      live pleasant and secret lives. They came to Ottways, with
      its limes and its one great cedar tree, and here the car
      pulled up for a moment, and Carlyon glanced at the little
      pink and green map he had upon his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It begins here," he said, "if that is Ottways."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy who drove them said that it was Ottways.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Copredy's place."
    </p>
    <p>
      John looked at Ottways with bright eyes. It pleased him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like a red bird in a green nest."
    </p>
    <p>
      They drove on past the Rising Sun Inn with its two big yew
      trees where the main road bent eastwards to Hadworth. Here
      the lane began, with Lydiards on its left and a great ilex
      hanging like a thundercloud over the red and white
      farmhouse. A gradual mystery crept over the landscape, a
      wildness both in detail and outline. The hedges and the
      grass beside the lane began to fill with the bronze of the
      wet fern. The ghosts of ragwort and golden rod glimmered in
      the pale light.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wildness showed itself in outbreakings of furze and
      heather, and self-sown birches like fans of lace on sticks
      of silver. The Hadworth Woods rose in black mystery against
      the northern sky. And suddenly the lane ended; it seemed to
      dry up like a stream, or rather to well out of the ground
      where short turf, heather and furze marked the fringe of
      Burnt Heath. On the right a white gate in a thorn hedge
      opened upon a grass-grown track. On the top bar was painted
      in black letters, "Romans Farm."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, where even the lane ended, John took the map from his
      brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Up there; that's where I want to go. That cottage on the
      edge of the wood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mascall's Wood."
    </p>
    <p>
      They left the car and followed a path, a ribbon of turf
      which went on towards the woods. Burnt Heath stretched like
      a broken sea to the west, and on their right lay wild banks
      of gorse and the upland fields of Romans Farm. The farm
      itself cocked a red ear among the black tangle of its
      orchard and sheltering trees, but John did not look at the
      farm. His eyes, bright with a boyish expectancy, watched
      the woods and the northern sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Car glanced at him once or twice with curiosity and doubt.
      Carlyon was a townsman, a Londoner who took his month in
      Switzerland or Italy, with an occasional week-end in the
      country, but his love was never happy unless her shoes were
      tripping somewhere near Pall Mall or Berkeley Square. The
      country bored him. He was perfectly frank about it. He was
      the man of affairs, healthily ambitious, and Burnt Heath
      struck him as being only a little less dismal and much
      quieter than the Ypres salient. And here was this brother
      of his with his stag-like eyes and head, alert, excited,
      sniffing the air!
    </p>
    <p>
      Car felt his very modern brain in revolt under its bowler
      hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A bit lonely, Jack?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it is what I want."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no doubt about his enthusiasm. When they tumbled
      upon the cottage, an old red-brick and timber thing
      standing in its wild garden under the very surge of the
      firs, John stood stock still and looked at it steadily.
      There was the shine of some settled purpose in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place was empty. It looked shaggy, derelict, overgrown,
      its heather thatch slipping down over its eyes. A green and
      rotting gate hung awry. A big pear tree seemed to fill the
      little front garden with a blackish mass of unpruned wood.
      A yew tree brushed one gable with the ends of its green
      fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then John walked straight to the crooked gate in the hedge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Got the key, Car?"
    </p>
    <p>
      To his brother it seemed incredible that such a place
      should have a key.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carlyon let John explore the place, remaining like a
      restless dog at the gate, and estimating the probable
      distances between a dweller in Mascall's Wood and a drink,
      the sight of a decently dressed woman or a dinner at the
      Carlton. He gauged Romans Farm to be a quarter of a mile
      away; its chimney and the outline of its roof were vaguely
      visible among its trees. Carlyon visualized nothing
      interesting there. Lydiards was another mile along the
      lane, and the Rising Sun Inn was a very tarnished luminary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ottways?
    </p>
    <p>
      There might be petticoats at Ottways, but would petticoats
      be good for John? In fact, could he live without
      petticoats? But, confound it, this unfortunate brother of
      his would have to live without petticoats. A man who was
      not quite responsible ought not to marry.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then his brother came out of the cottage, lighting a
      pipe and looking as though he had been talking to a pretty
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's just the thing; full of old beams and queer corners.
      That pear tree must be a picture."
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw the match into one of the weedy beds with its
      tattered box edging. Carlyon was looking at the pear tree;
      he thought it looked wet and clammy and dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about water?"
    </p>
    <p>
      John gave a quick turn of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a well, I expect."
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked round the cottage and discovered the well close
      to the yew tree, a mossy oak trapdoor under a sort of
      penthouse roofed with old tiles. The well delighted him. He
      came back with an air of triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Windlass and bucket."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It ought to be tested, old man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tested? What is there to foul it up here? Better than
      chlorine water out of a petrol tin."
    </p>
    <p>
      Carlyon, the man of the city, felt the dreariness of such a
      prospect stick in the gorge of his conscience. He was very
      fond of this brother of his; his love of the warm complex
      life of cities made him shrink from this peasant's shack
      under the drip of the trees. What a life! To him it seemed
      impossible, pathetically impossible. Did this brother of
      his realize it, the loneliness of it, the sordid boredom of
      it, the dish washing, the lighting of fires?
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt that John ought to be made to realize it, be
      compelled to look into its face of clay.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood with his back to the rotting gate, resting his
      elbows on it, and holding the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, old man, I know you are in earnest about this, but
      do you think you can stick it--the loneliness, I mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      John's face lost none of its quiet purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want people."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I know; you may feel like that now, but we are
      changeful beggars, and made of flesh and blood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, there are people to know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A few farmers and the folk who live at Ottways, a doctor
      and a parson, and the man who keeps the pub. Think of the
      boredom of it. It isn't as though you had been born to the
      life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course--sometimes--I shall be bored."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he laughed, the serious laughter of a man facing
      realities.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But can you show me any place, old chap, where a man is
      not liable to be bored?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well, if you look at it in that way!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't. What I mean is, it is the inside of us that
      matters. If we are all wrong inside, artificial, mere
      materialists, boredom is a dead certainty anywhere. I had
      several alternatives, and I had a good look at them all.
      For instance, I might have taken up some machine
      job--flying, car racing, a be-reckless-and-jolly-to-day
      life, for to-morrow you may die. Or I might have slipped
      into some other post in town and lived a rackety, fatuous
      life. But do you think I could get any lasting satisfaction
      out of dance clubs or having affairs with poor little
      devils of girls, or meeting somebody in a cinema and then
      sneaking off to a seedy bedroom in some seedy hotel in a
      back street? A man has to choose, Car, hasn't he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But hang it, man, life in London isn't like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course it isn't; not for the ordinary man who has a
      settled job and a wife and all that in prospect. But you
      see, it's obvious, the war has not left me ordinary. I had
      to face that fact, and Beal helped me to face it."
    </p>
    <p>
      His pipe had gone out and he relit it, while his brother
      hung doubtfully upon the gate and looked at the tumbledown
      cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that's true," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at John, and he was struck by the contrast
      between the man's almost luminous face and the darkness of
      the fir woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll tell you my secret, Car."
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled, showing his white teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most of us won't face realities. How many of us liked
      facing a barrage? We prefer the easy, the make-believe; it
      is much safer to sit in a trench. But for the last six
      months I have made myself face realities, and I am finding
      out all sorts of things. I am not afraid of facing the life
      here. There is such a force as discipline, isn't there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Car looked at him, and the soul of him drew a deep and
      astonished breath, for suddenly he seemed to see not a
      younger brother, a boy under a cloud, but a man who somehow
      had got a grip on some unusual philosophy, a man whose eyes
      had the shine of a settled purpose. He saw what Rollin Beal
      had seen, and felt what Rollin Beal had felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon, old chap," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found himself under the gaze of eyes of affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all right. You want me to face the facts, and I
      have tried to show you that I am facing them. I'll tell you
      another secret, Car."
    </p>
    <p>
      His mouth betrayed a twist of humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have found out that things are much less boring than
      people--live things, things that grow and live and do their
      job without a lot of eternal patter. And I have an idea
      that I am only going to like those people who live and work
      with things that grow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Car smiled at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That rules me out, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be an ass," said his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      They filed out of the gateway, and John Stretton loitered a
      moment as though absorbing a picture of the place with its
      shaggy thatch dark under the shadows of the trees, its wild
      garden, and its rough meadow ending in a waste of furze.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall like to plant myself here," he said, as they
      turned away; "plant myself and grow. Do you see the idea,
      Car?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Carlyon saw it well enough, but his fear was that the
      growth might be stunted and eccentric. Still, all life is a
      question of taking risks, and the war had left John with a
      future that was problematical.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked back to the car, and found the lad talking to
      an oldish man who was leaning over the white gate at the
      end of the lane leading to Romans Farm. John had a glimpse
      of a pair of shrewd blue eyes, a brown face deep with
      wrinkles, a grey moustache still tawny in the centre. The
      man's face pleased him, attracted him. It was as restful as
      looking at a landscape or a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lad jerked a thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is Mr. Viner of Romans, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked with Mr. Viner, or rather, Car talked and the
      farmer said "Ay, ay," at intervals, and looked at the sky,
      the heath, the top of his own gate, Car's boots and John's
      face, with the wondering yet quite unrestless look of a man
      who lives his life in the open, and whose observation is
      acute yet almost unconscious. Sometimes his eyes lit up.
      They were kind eyes, humorous, quietly wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      John was fascinated by the wrinkles on his forehead. There
      were four of them running horizontally and four others
      crossing them, and joining grizzled hair to grizzled
      eyebrows. The farmer's nose was broad, like a good human,
      humorous life, neither too fastidious nor too fleshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Car was always frank and the farmer appeared to understand
      his frankness. Did Mr. Viner know that the Burnt Heath
      estate was for sale by private treaty? Yes, Mr. Viner knew
      it very well. No; he had no intention of trying to buy his
      farm. His lease had several years to run, and he was
      content to let it stay at that. The estate was a very sound
      proposition, as sound as anything could be in these
      restless days. There was going to be a slump in land? Oh,
      probably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Car asked if they might take a cursory look at the house
      and buildings, and Mr. Viner opened the gate. His eyes
      smiled at John. The younger man's eyes liked him, and the
      impression was mutual.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you gentlemen acting for a purchaser?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a sense, yes," said Car.
    </p>
    <p>
      John, walking close to old Viner and looking at him, hid
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to live here, up there in that cottage. You see, I
      got rather messed up in the war."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever Mr. Viner may have thought, he was not a man who
      pushed pins into bladders. He gave John one very direct and
      observant stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man might do worse." But all the same he wondered what
      the devil the man meant to do there.
    </p>
    <p>
      So John had his first look at Romans Farm. It lay in a
      slight hollow, an indentation in the green cushion of the
      gently sloping hillside. He saw old thorn hedges, a white
      fence, a stretch of grass with a file of white ducks
      trooping across it, a pond, a group of farm buildings in
      old brick and roofed with thatch or heavy red tiles, the
      bow and shafts of an old blue wagon protruding from a wagon
      shed, a carter leading a horse to be watered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house itself, long and low, its red brick mellowed to a
      rich rust colour, stood back in the arms of its orchard.
      Its northern hedge was full of sheltering trees. Two stout
      chimney stacks rose above the roof. The deep porch was
      thatched with heather. In one warm corner of the garden
      John saw beehives ranged in a row.
    </p>
    <p>
      Viner nodded at the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Solid," he said; "they made good bricks in those days. A
      little worm in the roof, but nothing to speak of."
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes met John's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you gentlemen would take a glass of ale."
    </p>
    <p>
      They went in with him, following the direct and friendly
      breadth of his figure. The living-room was long and low,
      full of old furniture, and its windows looked out over the
      garden to the blue-grey haziness of the distant chalk
      hills. A woman with grey hair and a placid face who was
      sewing by the fire looked up and smiled at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Viner, gentlemen."
    </p>
    <p>
      Car was nearest to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please don't get up. Mr. Viner was so kind as to ask us
      in."
    </p>
    <p>
      No one explained why they were there, and Mary Viner seemed
      to expect no explanations. She was one of those comfortable
      women who accept things. Car had spoken to her, but it was
      at his brother that she looked; her eyes were drawn to him,
      for John Stretton attracted women. And he, for some reason
      or other, crossed over and sat near her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have just been telling Mr. Viner that I want to live
      down here."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was aware of a slight hardening of her placid eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I have no designs on your farm. The fact is, we think
      of buying the estate, and I may take on that cottage up by
      the wood."
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman in the chair was absorbing her impression of him,
      his clothes, his atmosphere of frank reality, his firmly
      set mouth and the slight sadness in his eyes. He was
      unusual. His suggestion that he might live in that
      tumbledown place up yonder was unusual.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then three glasses of ale arrived, called for by old
      Viner and brought in by a little woman with a snub nose and
      eyes that were both bold and apologetic. There was some
      casual conversation before Car glanced at his wrist-watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      John rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have got to see Lydiards."
    </p>
    <p>
      He held out a hand to the woman in the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you. Perhaps--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are very quiet up here, Mr.--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stretton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very quiet; but then, you see--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to be quiet," he said to her; "not like France.
      Good-bye."
    </p>
    <p>
      She watched him steadily as he went out of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmer walked with them to the white gate, and stood
      there while the lad cranked up the engine and the Strettons
      climbed into the car. He was still standing there, gazing
      out over the heath, when the car turned the corner lower
      down the lane, for John looked back and saw him. It seemed
      to him that old Viner's figure had grown strangely
      familiar, part of a well-known landscape, and this in the
      short passing of half an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nice old boy that," said his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      John hardly troubled to agree. It was not a question of old
      Viner being likeable; he was more than that, though John
      could not have explained the significance this country
      figure had for him. Perhaps it was a human symbol, for men
      persist in setting up symbols.
    </p>
    <p>
      In five minutes they were at Lydiards, but the folk who
      dwelt in this other farm were not of the Viner calibre. A
      lean, peevish, earthy-faced man in a hard felt hat listened
      to them with evident interest. To get a glimpse of
      Lydiards, Car had to produce the agents' order, and the
      earthy-faced man went with them everywhere, watching with
      the cold eyes of an unenlightened selfishness.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Willowmaston road they pulled up outside the red
      wall of Ottways and took a peep through the iron gates. The
      place looked well kept, and most solidly English. A
      gardener was sweeping up the dead leaves on the drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No problems there," thought Car; "Ottways people refuse to
      recognize problems."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then a flash of colour contradicted him, the eternal
      torch carried forcefully against the wind. His eyes cried
      "Hallo!" The eyes of the girl said, "Men! Young men! What
      in the name of mischief are you doing here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had steered her bicycle round the tail of the car and
      had dismounted within a yard of the younger Stretton's
      elbow. She wore a grass-green jumper and scarf and a little
      black straw Quaker bonnet. Her hair was red. It was her
      colouring which struck Carlyon Stretton; it blazed at you
      vividly from cheeks and lips, beautifully hard and healthy.
      Her blue eyes had a tinge of green.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at both men with a casual quick stare, a look
      that both questioned and ignored. Next moment she had
      pushed open one of the iron gates and was remounted and
      riding up the drive. They saw the flick of her neat black
      ankles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right; drive on."
    </p>
    <p>
      The lad drove on, but neither men made any reference to the
      girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      John and his brother were putting up at The Moon at
      Kingsbury, and they dined in the coffee-room on the first
      floor with its Georgian windows and iron-railed balconies
      overlooking the street. Kingsbury was very quiet, and The
      Moon was at the quiet end of the town. To Carlyon the only
      audible sounds were the shuffling feet and the stertorous
      breathing of a very fat and ancient waiter whose thumbnail
      showed a black half-moon when he held a plate or a dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were alone until a couple of commercial travellers
      came in and drank tea with their meat. This and the
      waiter's black thumbnail seemed to depress Car.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't stand these places. They make me think that every
      fly in England has left his signature somewhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards they sat and smoked in the smoking-room until
      the commercial travellers followed them there, and Car
      began a series of fastidious yawns. He did not mind people
      being plain, but he could not stand them greasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about bed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      As they climbed the stairs John could not resist a dig at
      his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't there something in my theory that things are less
      boring than people?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, those bagmen? Poor devils! But I can't say that I was
      fascinated by the hotel spoons."
    </p>
    <p>
      They arrived at a landing, and here a table and a platoon
      of brass candlesticks reminded them that there was neither
      gas nor electric light in The Moon's bedrooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good lord!" said Car. "I suppose they used to supply
      slippers."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was feeling for his matches when a chambermaid appeared
      from somewhere and proceeded to light the candles. She was
      young and pretty, and though she kept her lashes lowered
      she radiated playfulness, the delight of being slyly
      irresponsible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A candle, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at Car, and Car in looking back at her thought
      better of The Moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks. I rather like this idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl gave John a candle and the same mischievous look
      which she had given his brother, but John's eyes were full
      of something else. He simply did not see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night, Jack."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's your number?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seven. Next door. There ought to be luck in that. Good
      night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Car was standing in front of his dressing-table mirror and
      untying his tie when he heard his brother put his boots
      outside in the passage and close and lock his door. The
      incident set Car's thoughts moving in a certain direction,
      and traversing such questions as self-suppression,
      celibacy, loneliness and locked doors. It occurred to him
      that Miss Isobel Copredy of Ottways was not a young woman
      who believed in locked doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes; Car had taken the trouble to ask their driver who she
      was, but not while his brother was about. Car had a nice
      appreciation of women. He appreciated Miss Copredy's
      colour, even the very brilliant and provoking hardness of
      her, and so suggestible are a man's moods that Carlyon
      thought better of the country for having seen her. Burnt
      Heath had become sacred.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a flamboyant wench!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His thoughts digressed to John and John's passion for the
      wilderness, but to Car it was a wilderness no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hasn't Jack left women out of the scheme? Now if I tried
      playing John the Baptist within a mile of that complexion
      and that mouth--oh, get along to bed, you silly ass!
      Doesn't a man ever grow up?"

    <h1>
      THE FAMILY DEBATES
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Carlyon's impression of the Burnt Heath country retained so
      much of Miss Isobel Copredy's colour that his report on it
      to Bartholomew was not wholly that of a business man. Car
      had been acting as confidential friend to the whole family,
      with Rollin Beal in the background, and Messrs. Groob and
      Giddy, of Pride Street, as purveyors of possible properties
      anywhere within a hundred miles of St. Paul's. There had
      been expeditions into Sussex, Hampshire and Bucks, but
      John's eyes had brightened to none of them as they had
      brightened to the cottage on the edge of Mascall's Wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is the place I want."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very definite about it, and so well able to persuade
      his mother that there was some mysterious and healing life
      to be lived on Burnt Heath, that Bartholomew--buttressed
      between his wife and his two sons--prepared to draw a
      cheque on the future and to hope that he would be left in
      peace to win golf balls off old Lambrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll do the thing well."
    </p>
    <p>
      Messrs. Groob and Giddy were asking twelve thousand pounds
      for the property. This "rock-bottom price" included
      Ottways, let on a repairing lease to Colonel Copredy at
      150 a year, the two farms, Lydiards and Romans, the Rising
      Sun Inn, several cottages, Mascall's Wood and about fifty
      acres of heath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bartholomew sent a surveyor down to go over the buildings,
      and his report was very favourable, but he took exception
      to the cottage by Mascall's Wood. This came near wrecking
      the scheme, until John won over his mother by telling her
      that he meant to camp out for most of the year, and that he
      would have the cottage repaired.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before a final decision was taken Rollin Beal held a
      very unusual consultation at his house in Wimpole Street.
      John was not present; in fact, he knew nothing about this
      family council, and he might have felt restive and
      uncomfortable had he been there. Bartholomew and his wife,
      Carlyon and Reginald sat round Beal's table and discussed
      the scheme in all its details. Car and his mother did most
      of the talking; Lavinia had made a secret excursion to
      Kingsbury; she had not seen Miss Copredy, but she had
      discovered a glamour of her own, the glamour of the
      mysterious and the sentimental.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is such sweet country, even in winter, and of course,
      in time, John will have Ottways."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had mapped it all out. She saw her favourite son living
      the life of a country gentleman, with that mind-scar wiped
      out, and a wife and children completing the picture.
      Lavinia hankered after grandchildren; she felt that she
      would be able to enjoy them without feeling in any way
      responsible; and Car was not married and Reginald's wife
      did not want children. The fact was she did not want
      Reginald's children, and Reginald's brothers did not blame
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this family conference the three thousand a year man sat
      bald and bored, ostentatiously sceptical. He had had a
      passage of arms with Car and with his mother. This
      mad-hatter scheme! Did Bartholomew intend to settle the
      capital on John? Yes, Bartholomew did intend. Reginald
      looked contemptuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does not anyone realize that John cannot be credited with
      stability? In six months he will be clamouring for some
      other toy."
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother flared with startling unexpectedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't try to do him justice, you with all your success
      and your career. John is utterly in earnest. Why, he is
      even learning to cook."
    </p>
    <p>
      Reginald laughed. His laughter was rare and it did not suit
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose he wears an apron! Am I to take this as evidence
      of his sanity?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Car, who was saying something to Beal, turned on Reginald
      with one of his quick flashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are not here to break eggs in a hat."
    </p>
    <p>
      This fierceness put Reginald upon his dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish to dissociate myself--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank God," said Car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal took the tangled threads into his hands and gently
      pulled them straight. He had certain questions to ask
      Carlyon Stretton. Who would be John's nearest neighbours;
      what sort of people were they?
    </p>
    <p>
      Car described old Viner, painting a pleasant picture of
      him, but he said nothing of the girl at Ottways, though
      some of her colour crept into portraiture of Thomas Viner
      and into his impression of the landscape. Mrs. Stretton
      nodded and smiled at Car. Bartholomew, sitting judicially
      with his hands on his stomach, felt that that family would
      persuade him to sign that cheque.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was quite ready to sign it. He could go to the club and
      say with casual impressiveness: "I have bought that poor
      lad of mine a little place in the country. A few hundred
      acres, you know. Rollin Beal's advice. Wonderful
      man--Rollin Beal." And even old Lambrick would be
      sympathetic. They would say that Bartholomew Stretton was a
      warm man, a generous man. He could put down his thousands
      to give a broken boy his chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, a very sad case young Stretton's; of course, the law
      was an ass, but what could you do with a man who was liable
      to beat out the brains of some respectable citizen? Cage
      him or put him somewhere where he was likely to come to no
      harm? A very excellent arrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party broke up, Bartholomew and his wife driving off to
      Esher, and Reginald returning to his Kensington flat where
      he could relieve himself by being portentously unpleasant
      to his wife. Car remained behind with Rollin Beal; they had
      need of each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doctor, what do you think the chances are? I mean, is that
      life down there going to cure him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker had brought in tea, and Beal was filling Carlyon's
      cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. No one knows. But we are giving him his most
      likely chance. Help yourself, will you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      When Car looked serious he grew more like his younger
      brother, and he was very serious now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you sure that it is his best chance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you suggest any alternative?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I can't. All I know is that Jack is passionately keen
      on the life, and that it would drive me to drink or an
      intrigue in ten days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Men differ. There's a platitude for you. And I think I can
      tell you how you differ from John."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am listening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You want to impress yourself on people; he prefers to make
      his impression on things."
    </p>
    <p>
      Car's eyes lit up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That means that I have more vanity?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, more ambition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite true. And you are saying what Jack said in much the
      same words. By the way, has it occurred to you to wonder
      whether he is interested in women?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes," said Beal; "but I don't think he is. Is that
      your impression?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think he cares a tinker's cuss about them just at
      present," said Car, munching buttered toast; "but I suppose
      it will happen. What then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may depend on the woman," said Beal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean that it ought to be a particular sort of woman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Say one with a happy, comely temperament."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's rather a one in a hundred chance, Beal. You see, I
      have no more illusions about women than I have about men.
      We are patchwork."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, until something happens," said Beal, smiling his
      luminous smile, "and then the gold threads show."
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had other work for John's brother. He told Car that
      he wished him to go down to Kingsbury and interview one of
      the local doctors, a man named Mellor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew Mellor well at the hospital. I have had cases from
      him. He is a sound man, mainly because he has not yet got
      bored with his work. I shall write to him and explain your
      brother's case."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then what am I to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go into it with Mellor. I want him to hold what we might
      call a 'watching brief.' Of course, your brother must not
      know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I could manage it this week-end. Your idea is to
      have someone more or less on the spot who understands the
      situation?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly. He knows the neighbourhood. He might be able to
      help Jack to know the people he ought to know, and to avoid
      those--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Car gave Beal a shrewd look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you really think that personality is of such
      importance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may seem strange to you, but I do. I believe it to be
      the most important factor in this case. How much illness or
      wellness is there in other people's souls!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I suppose that's true," said Car. "Reginald always
      gives me a liver; and Jack is sensitive. I rather liked the
      people at the farm, the Viners: homely folk, you know,
      looked as though they had grown there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Simple without being stupid, and kindly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, much like that. Of course, I only saw them for a few
      minutes, but that is the impression I had."
    </p>
    <p>
      Car went off to his club, pondering this subtle subject and
      wondering whether Beal's psychology was not a little too
      clever and esoterical. It seemed to him to suggest the
      labelling of people like medicine bottles. "Two
      tablespoonfuls of Mr. Viner to be taken three times a day
      after meals," or, "one dose of Miss Isobel Copredy an hour
      before bedtime!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, and he had not even mentioned Miss Copredy of Ottways.
      The idea was absurd. What harm could it do John to have an
      occasional glimpse of a red head and an apple-green jumper?
      Beal's theory postulated too great a complexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Bartholomew and his wife, posting back to Esher,
      discussed another aspect of John's future, an aspect that
      was definitely feminine. It was old Stretton who raised the
      point. He did not like the idea of John living all alone in
      that cottage; his own sociability recoiled from such a
      prospect and foresaw incipient melancholia. Moreover, who
      was going to cook and clean and wash and make beds? Men are
      such helpless mortals.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think Madge ought to live with him for the first six
      months. I suppose they could get a woman to come in and do
      the work."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was astonished to find that his wife did not agree with
      him, and when he pressed her for her reasons she gave them
      with what was for her unusual bluntness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madge would not go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it is her duty to go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think John would want her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he must have somebody there. Why not an ex-service
      man? Anyhow, I shall put it to Madge."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did so, and was met with the bluntest of blunt refusals.
      She, too, had her reasons and very good reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      "John and I don't agree. We should quarrel in a week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fact is you don't want to go," said her father rather
      testily; "you modern young women--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We say what we think, pater. It saves such a lot of
      trouble. Ask John; if he is honest as I am he will tell you
      that he would not have me at any price."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In my young days--" said her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You expected women to be genteel housemaids. Ask John."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bartholomew took her at her word, and going in search of
      John, found him in the library reading a book on the
      keeping of bees. His father took the hearthrug, and
      assuming the "my dear boy" attitude, asked his son to
      explain how he proposed to live in that hypothetical
      cottage. John, plucked away from the hiving of imaginary
      bees, looked straight at his father, keeping his forefinger
      in the book to mark his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can look after myself all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, cook and wash up the dishes and make your own bed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Men do it in the colonies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes, I know, and do you think they like it? I have
      suggested to Madge that she should come and keep house for
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      John was less abrupt than his sister, but he made it
      perfectly plain that he did not want Madge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry, pater, but we should bore each other to death.
      I would much rather be alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bartholomew gave a shrug of the shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well; you young people are different from what we
      were. But what on earth are you going to do down there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      John accepted the question in all seriousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall have to run the cottage. I mean to develop the
      place, enlarge the garden, take in another field and plant
      fruit trees. I want to expand it gradually into a small
      intensive farm. I shall have a lot to learn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes," said his father, "I see all that, but what
      about live things--friends? A man can't live with
      vegetables and--and dish-cloths."
    </p>
    <p>
      John laughed, but there was no mockery in his laughter. His
      father's point was thoroughly sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, there are the people at the farms. Besides, I shall
      have dogs, and bees, and a cat, and some live stock later
      on. Plenty to keep me busy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bartholomew gave it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm thinking of you--your happiness, John," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      His son got up and stood very close to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear old pater, you have been very generous to me.
      Don't--don't worry. I shall make good."
    </p>
    <p>

      THOMAS VINER AND MISS ISOBEL COPREDY
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Of Carlyon Stretton's second visit to Kingsbury something
      must be recorded. He arrived on the Saturday afternoon and
      put up at The Moon, balancing the stertorous waiter with
      his black thumbnail and the tarnished spoons against the
      pretty chambermaid who handed out the candles. Car had tea
      and then went in search of Dr. Mellor. The doctor's red
      brick house stood back from the cobbles of King Street
      behind a low wall and a laurel hedge, and Car found Mellor
      just returned from a long afternoon round.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a big man, blond, blue-eyed and quiet. He took Car
      into his den. He said at once that he had heard from Rollin
      Beal, and that Beal had sent him a complete history of John
      Stretton's case, and that it had interested him intensely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The war has given us plenty of problems. Your brother is
      not down here with you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. This visit of mine is unofficial. Beal wanted me to
      have a talk with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mellor passed him his cigarette-case, and asked Car if he
      would mind him having his tea brought in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm more than busy. You say that you have had tea?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, thanks; but have yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      Car liked the man. He reminded him of a big, blue-eyed dog
      who would ward off little quarrelsome people with an
      imperturbable and good-natured shoulder, and who was so
      happy a friend with himself that he made sick folk feel
      better for seeing him. He was full of robust vitality. He
      gave the impression that he was never in a hurry, and never
      petulant, never sour or cynical. "Just like a nice yellow
      plum," thought Car, "full of healthy, human juice."
    </p>
    <p>
      The talk between them grew very intimate and frank. It
      centred at last upon Beal's theory of the interactions of
      differing personalities, the people who are good for us and
      the people who are bad. Mellor was ready to agree with
      Beal, partly because he had such faith in the great
      alienist, but also because he realized that a large part of
      life's emotion is a matter of personal suggestion. He took
      up the thread of the idea and followed it to Burnt Heath.
      He knew the neighbourhood well, and the people. There were
      the Viners.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beal would call them beneficent, I suppose," said Car.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think your brother could have better neighbours.
      The girl is away at present, helping a married sister."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, so there is a daughter! You know, it is my idea,
      doctor, that if this experiment breaks down it will be
      because of a woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or the lack of one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly. I take it that my brother ought not to marry, at
      least not until there has been no recurrence. By the way,
      what about the people at Ottways?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old Copredy? I don't think there is any harm in old
      Copredy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mellor's eyes smiled. He had once had a most volcanic row
      with Colonel Copredy, and it had produced mutual tolerance
      and respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the daughter? There is a daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, there is a daughter," and it was obvious to Car
      that Mellor regarded her more seriously than he did her
      father; "a very modern young woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Car, being a busy man, understood the ways of a busy man,
      and when Mellor rose and glanced at the clock, Car thanked
      him and prepared to go. Mellor went with him to the door,
      and they stood there chatting for half a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I may take it as a certainty--I mean, your brother
      settling up there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have agreed to buy. Jack may be down here any day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mellor made a suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not go and see old Viner and take him into your
      confidence? You need not tell him everything. For instance,
      you can explain that your brother was shell-shocked, and
      that he is still a bit nervy and has to live a quiet,
      open-air life. Old Viner is a very decent old fellow, and
      no fool."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's an idea. I think I shall act on it, doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should. I can't see that it can do any harm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, nor can I. Thanks ever so much. Good night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Carlyon thought so well of the suggestion that he chartered
      the Ford car next day and was driven over to Burnt Heath.
      It was a clear, frosty morning, with crackle ice in the
      ruts and puddles, the grass silvered with hoar frost, and
      the hedges all rime. Willowmaston, red among the blackness
      of its winter trees, throbbed to its church bell, and sent
      smoke straight from its chimneys into the pale sunlight.
      When passing Ottways, Mellor's suggestion suddenly enlarged
      itself in Car's mind. What was to prevent him calling on
      Colonel Copredy and challenging that gallant gentleman's
      sympathy? It could be done. Car had very good manners, and
      a quick way of winning people. Also, he might get a second
      glimpse of Colonel Copredy's daughter!
    </p>
    <p>
      Car caught Mr. Viner sitting in front of the fire, his
      slippers on his feet, and a pair of highly polished black
      boots warming by the fender. Mrs. Mary had gone to Hadworth
      church, and her man had promised to walk down and meet her;
      meanwhile he smoked his pipe and read one of the most
      unexpected of books, Gibbon's "Decline and Fall of the
      Roman Empire." He made room for his visitor by the fire and
      offered him his tobacco-jar. There was no fluster about
      him, for Thomas Viner was a very great gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a shame to trouble you on a Sunday morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      Viner waited quietly to hear what the trouble was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it is nothing about your farm, Mr. Viner. We are
      buying the property for my brother. The fact is, I want to
      talk to you about my brother; I think you can help us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Car explained the position. He put it to Thomas Viner that
      John Stretton had been shell-shocked, that he was not quite
      fit for the strenuous life of the day, hence Burnt Heath
      and the cottage by Mascall's Wood. He described his
      brother's enthusiasm for a solitary, country life, for the
      game of camping out and tending his own hearth fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The trouble is," said Car, "that I don't think he knows
      the difference between a potato and a turnip. There is
      plenty of enthusiasm. It occurred to me that you might
      father him a bit. He is one of the very best, and as
      straight as you make them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Car watched the farmer's face. He was an expert at dealing
      with men, men who were secretive or suspicious or out to
      drive a politely brutal bargain. He watched a man's eyes,
      and old Viner's eyes remained exactly what they always
      were.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be rather lonely for the lad," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Car blessed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is what we feel. He has got to plough his own furrow,
      but if there is a friendly soul on the other side of the
      hedge--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay," said the farmer, "that's so. He can drop in here just
      when he likes. We are quiet folk."
    </p>
    <p>
      His blue eyes gave a twinkle of kindness, and he reached
      for his boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Supposing we take a walk up and have a look at the place?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a man after Car's own heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you? Why, that's excellent. I am as green as grass
      in the country."
    </p>
    <p>
      They went up together to Mascall's Wood. Car had the key of
      the cottage, but old Viner had the key of far more
      important things. He plodded about in his quiet, dreamy
      way, yet his dreaminess was thoroughly practical. It was
      the mood of the man who knew Nature from root to crown. The
      land was part of his consciousness; he felt it, divined it.
      He went at once to the pith of things. If it were Mr.
      Stretton's idea to grow fruit and to keep live stock, he
      would need more land and more buildings, and the right sort
      of land.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are we to get it?" asked Car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Viner stroked his moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see that field of mine down there? I might manage to
      let him have two or three acres of it, just under the wood
      where there is shelter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think you could?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay," said the man of few words. "I have enough for my
      beasts."
    </p>
    <p>
      Car's face showed one of its quick, vital flushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Viner, you are a man after my own heart. I can assure
      you we shall be generous."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Viner's eyes lit up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I lost a lad in the war. I don't think we forget quite so
      quickly as they do in the towns."
    </p>
    <p>
      Car took his midday dinner at Romans Farm, and divining the
      fact that Mr. Viner indulged in an afternoon nap on the
      Sabbath--he looked like it--Car, after a short talk with
      Mrs. Mary, went upon his way. Realizing that it would be a
      most unseemly and unpropitious hour at which to call upon
      the Copredys, for it was more than probable that Colonel
      Copredy fell asleep after reading the <i>Observer,</i> he
      made a circuit of Burnt Heath and explored some of the
      surrounding villages. It was nearly four o'clock when the
      Ford pulled up outside the gate of Ottways and Car walked
      up the avenue of limes to make trial of the Copredy temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pictured the colonel as a peppery man, a conventional
      figure, perhaps because he was thinking of the high colour
      of the daughter, and it was the daughter whom he met. Old
      Copredy had gone to bed with lumbago. The white front door
      opened when Car was half-way up the drive, and Car found
      the girl walking towards him. She was wearing a moleskin
      coat and a fur toque, and the cold weather seemed to have
      brightened her colour. Car, the enthusiastic appreciator of
      smart women and as good a judge of dress as any man to be
      met in a Pall Mall club, saw that she was no country
      cousin. She had style, or "devil," as he preferred to call
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Car had a very charming "attack." He smiled. He had a
      pleasant voice, a manner that was as right and as
      unostentatious as his clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon; are you Miss Copredy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked him full in the face, and that glance of hers
      was something of a shock to Car. He had seen that look
      before, had had it thrust at him in the half light of
      London streets, but it was unexpected under the lime trees
      of Ottways. It reminded him, too, of the war, and of the
      effect the war had had upon certain women.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was vibrant and rather hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was coming to call on your father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Colonel Copredy is in bed. I am going down to send our
      gardener to Kingsbury for the doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry," said Car, "but I am driving back to Kingsbury.
      Can I take a message? I hope it is nothing serious?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He noticed that her face never seemed to change. It
      remained like a bright and rather hard day in summer,
      without the subtler softnesses and the evanescent shadows.
      Her eyes grew a little more attentive or mischievous, that
      was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks. It's good of you. If you could leave a message
      with Dr. Mellor; he lives in King Street. Say Colonel
      Copredy has lumbago."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a slight laugh, as though lumbago was a ridiculous
      complaint, and particularly ridiculous when it showed
      itself in her father. Car could imagine him walking about
      with extreme care, stiff as a poker, and ready to snap at
      anybody and everything--if it could be done without hurting
      his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will leave a message with pleasure. By the way, my name
      is Stretton. My brother will be your landlord."
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," she said, "I see. But if you had any idea of seeing
      my father on business, I should advise you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, not business," he said. "Nothing of that kind. I
      should not think of bothering Colonel Copredy."
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered his smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, he is not very terrible. What I mean is, he is so
      useless, so sorry for himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then she encountered a sudden and vague hostility in
      Car's eyes, the hostility of the clannish male. She was
      piqued by it, for like many of the moderns she had adopted
      the Bernard Shaw idea of turning any accepted convention
      upside down and asserting that that was its proper and
      honest position. It was conventional to be kissed by a man,
      but if he disliked you the provocation was doubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Car made a polite movement towards the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will deliver your message. Charming man, Mellor. I know
      him slightly."
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked with him towards the gate. "Didn't I see you and
      your brother in a car outside here one day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe you did."
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not ask him any more direct questions, but she did
      say that the shooting was quite good and that there was a
      trout stream within twenty miles, but Car was not to be
      drawn. He knew that she was wondering why he had wished to
      see her father, but Car had readjusted his attitude towards
      Ottways and Miss Isobel Copredy. He smiled as he closed the
      gate and raised his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good afternoon. I will leave that message with Dr.
      Mellor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Awfully good of you," she said, giving him the full stare
      of what the halfpenny Press would have called her
      "compelling eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Car looked as though he were feeling the cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No bon for the troops," he thought. "I should like to put
      Ottways out of bounds."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    <h1>
      JOHN STRETTON MAKES HIS BED
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      When Stretton woke on that February morning his bedroom
      window was still full of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was conscious of a feeling of excitement, of a sense of
      adventure, and reaching out for the candlestick on the
      chair beside the bed he struck a match, lit the candle, and
      glanced at his wrist-watch. Ten minutes past five! He put
      the watch back, blew out the candle, and lay and waited for
      the window frame to change from black to grey, for The Moon
      at Kingsbury afforded no scope for the spirit of adventure
      at five o'clock on a February morning. He was content to
      lie there for a while in the little narrow room in the
      midst of a great silence, for on this day he was beginning
      the life of his own choosing, and the bedroom had some of
      the atmosphere of a monk's cell. Car had wondered whether
      this younger brother of his had not forgotten to stress the
      problem of his own manhood. Suffering brings reticence,
      especially suffering which is suppressed, and an
      Englishman's attitude towards the sex in himself may be
      full of an essential modesty which had been miscalled
      hypocrisy by people who think with the French. Stretton had
      a very good grasp of his own case. He had not shirked the
      facing of his own future, even in its relation to sex. He
      took the view that he had a moral skeleton in his cupboard,
      and that until he had buried that skeleton somewhere on
      Burnt Heath he had no right to marry. His appreciation of
      sex ended in the idea of marriage. The conventionalist may
      regard marriage as a refuge; the idealist regards it as
      something mysterious and right and beautiful, and John
      Stretton was an idealist.
    </p>
    <p>
      This attitude of restraint was behind all his actions,
      though he was not actively conscious of it during the
      earlier phases of the adventure. For the moment he was
      intensely interested in things and not in people. He lay in
      bed till the dawn came and showed him the spire of
      Kingsbury Church as a black obelisk against the pale gold
      of a winter sky. The day promised well, and he got up and
      dressed, and so keen was he to begin the day that he did
      not wait for hot water but washed and shaved in cold. Going
      downstairs he passed Car's pretty chambermaid, and seemed
      hardly aware of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was bringing your hot water, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton gave a vague glance at the can in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that's all right. You need not bother."
    </p>
    <p>
      Half a minute later he was out in The Moon's yard, looking
      at the black and yellow motor-van that had arrived the
      night before with all the gear and furniture of his
      cottage, a present from his mother. A man was bending over
      one of the wings, pouring oil into the oil-sump.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will be ready to start soon after breakfast?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any time you like, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a momentary glance at Stretton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't be able to get your van up to the cottage. I am
      hiring a cart from the nearest farm, and we shall have to
      transfer the stuff. How many of you are there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me and two mates."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The four of us should manage. I am driving up in a hired
      car, and I can show you the way. I have some shopping to do
      first. Supposing we say half-past nine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton strolled out into the town. He was in a very happy
      mood, and Kingsbury humoured it on this clear February
      morning. He felt the town; he was aware of its quiet
      breathing that had gone on for centuries; it smelt of the
      country even in this machine-made age; it was a town in
      which cattle were bought and sold, and to which country
      folk came with their carts and wagons. Stretton may have
      been guilty of conscious selection, and of seeing the
      things he wished to see. To him the country spoke of
      romance, and romance that spilled itself even into certain
      shops where you bought seeds or flour or tools or harness
      and farming tackle. A garage with a new tractor exhibited
      in the window interested Stretton not at all, for he had
      not the machine mind. He loitered outside a wheelwright's
      yard, or looked at the cattle-pens in the market-place, and
      spent two minutes outside an ironmonger's window.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past nine the convoy started for Burnt Heath, and
      at the gate of Romans Farm old Viner met them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, you are a bit early. My carter will be here in five
      minutes."
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook hands with Stretton, and then remembered to tell
      him that he had had a couple of sacks of coal sent up to
      the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You forgot it, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton laughed and thanked him. He had made an
      arrangement with the Viners for the supply of milk, eggs
      and butter, and Mary Viner had promised to take in his
      meat, bread and groceries from the Hadworth shops and send
      them up daily by the farm boy. Mrs. Mary had been troubled
      about his cooking, refusing to believe that a lone man--and
      a townsman at that--could produce anything that was
      eatable. She foresaw a diet of boiled eggs, bacon, tinned
      meat and cake, and a great and healthy loathing at the end
      of it, and it was here that she imagined the advent of the
      inevitable woman. She was right and she was wrong. History
      does not tell us how St. Anthony dealt with his
      frying-pans--if he had such articles--but Mrs. Viner did
      not know John Stretton or realize that he would be as
      obstinate as the saint.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sent out a message by Sam Rugglesworth, the carter's
      boy:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dinner's at 'alf-past twelve, mister."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton, busy at the tail of the motor-van, helping the
      men out with an oak chest that was full of books, turned a
      flushed face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that for me, boy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank Mrs. Viner and tell her I shall be glad to come."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile he was happy and absorbed in the great game of
      making a home. The Cottage--he had given it that, the name
      of simplicity--had been in the hands of Mr. Rumble of
      Willowmaston, who had torn out the rusty and toothless old
      grates, fitted a compact little "kitchener," a bath and a
      new sink, splashed distemper everywhere, rose or buff,
      painted all the woodwork white, renewed the thatch, and
      fitted a new gate and a new well flap. Regretfully Stretton
      had seen the winch and bucket go, and a wheel pump under a
      pent-house had taken its place, whence he could pump his
      water to a tank in the roof. The garden gate had ceased to
      hang awry and to plough a groove in the path. It stood up
      straight and true, its blue slats blinking at the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton and his merry men were at work till three o'clock,
      and at that hour he was rid of them with sundry tips and a
      feeling of relief. They had broken one of the legs of his
      gate-legged table, got themselves jammed in the narrow
      staircase with the top of a "tallboy," and worried
      themselves free with some damage to the plaster. They went,
      hauling up at the Rising Sun for various drinks, while
      Stretton lit his fire for the first time and put the kettle
      on to boil for tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place was full of packing cases, but he postponed the
      unpacking of them till after dusk, being lured forth by the
      westering sun, and the first consciousness of the landscape
      as his. Neither the kitchen window nor the bedroom window
      above, sunk deep in its saddle of thatch, showed him all
      that he desired to see, and he went and stood at the blue
      gate and looked at the vista which was to be his from day
      to day. From the very first he had realized its beauty,
      though why its beauty pleased him so much he could not say.
      The ground stretched level for a little distance, brown
      with dead bracken or green with grass and furze. Spaced
      here and there were old yews, thorns and birches, shutting
      out the too-large horizon and giving a feeling of shelter
      and of secrecy; but at one point there was a gap, a
      grey-blue glimpse of infinity, full of the atmosphere of
      far hills. The ground fell away gently, and in the middle
      distance the trees and red roofs of Romans Farm showed in
      the soft light.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I don't mind that farm."
    </p>
    <p>
      He realized that he would be able to see a blink of light
      from the homestead when darkness fell, and the idea pleased
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like a friendly ship," he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned about and looked at his cottage and its
      woodlands. There was no one line in his cottage that could
      be called straight; the thatched roof undulated; the timber
      and brick walls showed vague bulgings; the chimney-stack
      leant slightly away from the south-west wind. Its queer,
      tumbledown beauty, for beauty it had, lay in its
      irregularity, its kinship with its setting. It was not a
      question of sentimentality, of a once new and ugly thing
      mellowed by the passing of time. It seemed to Stretton that
      the old folk had known how to build to their surroundings,
      unconsciously, perhaps, or because they had more
      individuality and also more simplicity. The educated
      utilitarian sets up his cube of red bricks, or if he is
      pretentious his spotted and smirking little villa.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Queer," thought Stretton as he stood at the gate; "most
      people are ugly and live in ugly houses. And yet we are not
      blind."
    </p>
    <p>
      From the cottage he turned his eyes to the wood. The
      cottage stood at the end of a cleft which had the
      appearance of an old road or ride, and the woodland
      differed on either side of this line. On the west it was
      composed of Scots fir, spruce, larch and Douglas fir; on
      the east it was chiefly deciduous, oak, beech, birch, with
      a scattering of old yews and hollies, and a few tall
      cypresses towering between the branches. These cypresses
      had no right to a place in an English wood, and yet the man
      who had planted them there had planted better than he knew.
      None of the trees was of very great age, and in more than
      one spot the oaks and beeches had never been cut over, and
      had run up in crowded pillars to meet in the canopy above.
      This crowding of the ash-grey and grey-green trunks had a
      very definite charm. It reminded Stretton of some of the
      woods which he had seen in France. He could picture it all
      in the spring, with all its many shades of glimmering
      green, while the cuckoo called, and the bluebells flowered
      among the dead leaves and the rusty bracken. He imagined it
      as a sanctuary for many birds, even that gaillard and
      raucous thief the jay. He would see the flicker of the
      sunlight and the shadows, the gold-dappled trunks and the
      patterning of light upon the brown-green carpet. It was
      mysterious, complete and good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he remembered his kettle. He had turned away from
      the gate, and was looking at the red ball of the sun
      hanging in the thick of an old thorn tree when he heard a
      scuffling in the hedge and the quick and excited breathing
      of a dog. The sound was unexpected, and he opened the gate
      and stepped out beyond the line of the hedge, but there was
      no dog there. He returned to the garden in time to see the
      black head of a spaniel pushing through the long grass. The
      dog caught sight of him and stood at gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, old fellow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton's voice was "Hail fellow, well met" to the
      intruder, The dog came trotting up with all the
      affectionate enthusiasm and the tail and body waggings of a
      spaniel, ready to be caressed and to answer the caresses
      with an active tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, where do you come from? Not a bad hint to me either,
      old chap."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that he heard the voice of the dog's companion,
      and realized the nearness of someone else.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prince, Prince!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog showed no desire to leave Stretton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prince!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go along, old thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked to the gate and opened it suggestively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now then."
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost instantly he was conscious of another presence. It
      came to him over the heath and along the silver-grey line
      of the old oak palings of the fence around the wood. He saw
      the figure as a blur of colour, something more vividly
      green than the furze and the grass, and then it moved
      between him and the red circle of the setting sun, becoming
      a black silhouette, the figure of a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared. The presence of the woman was far more
      unexpected than that of the dog, and perhaps less welcome.
      She came on. She passed out of the sun's circle, and the
      colour of her returned. She dropped her mystery, and became
      a girl with red hair, swinging a stick, sleek in her apple
      green.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid my dog has been trespassing."
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused by the gate, and Stretton was aware of her
      modernity. She had the flat, breastless figure and the
      rather stooping carriage and the narrow hips of the
      particularly modern type, but if the feminine outline
      changes the sex may appear the same. Her skin was radiant,
      the colouring rich yet hard. Her nostrils were too deeply
      cut, and cruel in contrast to her sensuous mouth. Her blue
      eyes looked at Stretton with an expression that might have
      been described as boldly frank. That there was much behind
      this frankness was more a matter of intuition, for John
      Stretton divined more things than he knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anyhow, your dog has given me a suggestion," he said,
      drawing back behind the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The act may have seemed to her defensive. The man in him
      did not like her. She realized that with the quickness of
      an egotistical child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You want a dog up here."
    </p>
    <p>
      She prodded the ground with her stick, and having looked at
      her face he kept his eyes on her brown brogues and her dark
      green stockings. He felt that she wanted him to explain
      himself, and he had not the slightest intention of
      explaining himself to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, the company, you know. A dog does not ask questions."
    </p>
    <p>
      It slipped out before he realized what the words implied.
      Her eyelids gave a little flicker. She was provoked by
      opposites more than by sympathies.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The cheapest form of conversation! Well, I should suggest
      an Airedale--something not too sentimental."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, nodded, but still loitered, looking at the
      cottage. There was interest in her eyes and some malice.
      She thought of telling him what had happened to the last
      dweller in the cottage, but she refrained, yet not out of
      kindness. That is what youth lacks--kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton closed the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, I have forgotten my kettle. It must have boiled
      itself to death."
    </p>
    <p>
      She went off laughing, but he had a feeling that her
      laughter mocked everything that was his, both in this world
      and the hypothetical next. She was destructive; he might
      have said that she had been born of the war. As for the
      kettle, he found it boiling its heart out, with chattering
      lid, and a label of steam bulging from its spout.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What an unpleasant young woman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      That was his impression; but he had forgotten all about her
      by the time that he had lit a pipe and washed up the tea
      things. He had too much to do, too much that was urgent and
      interesting. He had to unpack his cases and make his bed
      with those carefully aired sheets and blankets sent down
      from Stow House in a steamer trunk. He smiled, but very
      kindly, over his mother's forethought.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As though I had never seen the inside of a dugout," he
      reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      By nine o'clock he had got things fairly shipshape, and was
      sitting by the fire listening to the wind in the trees. His
      trees! Life and his tobacco tasted good.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Isobel Copredy's mood was one of laughter all the way
      home to Ottways. She was amused as only a very
      sophisticated young woman can be amused. That Stretton
      belonged to a type that appealed to her was neither here
      nor there. She knew very little about him save that he was
      a man of some property and an ex-officer, and that he had
      an elder brother who was very much a man of the world. Her
      ignorance did not prevent her from inferring that a man who
      had been pushed down here to lead so eccentric a life must
      have some eccentricity to justify it. It was possible that
      he had been crocked in the war, or had got into trouble
      after it, and she thought the latter explanation more
      probable and more interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun had set when she reached Ottways. She left the
      spaniel in the stable, and entered the house by the side
      door opening into the passage where the deck-chairs, golf
      clubs and croquet mallets were kept. Croquet was Colonel
      Copredy's game; his daughter left it at that. The passage
      led her to the staircase end of the big square hall with
      oak chests and an old oak cupboard into which it was
      possible to throw gloves, paper, string and books, and so
      rid oneself of further responsibility. Her first movement
      was to the walnut table where letters were left. There were
      no letters. Her thrusting of the stick into the stand
      suggested annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rose!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A maid was crossing the hall with a silver teapot and a
      dish of hot toast on a tray.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, miss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why haven't you lit the lamp?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was just going to light it. The colonel is waiting,
      miss."
    </p>
    <p>
      Isobel went in to her father. He was a fussy little man
      with a sharp, beaked nose, very red about the cheekbones; a
      man whose neck always looked too small for his collar. He
      wore grey slippers, which was an offence, and as he sat in
      his big chair he had poised his feet on a footstool so that
      they somewhat resembled a couple of harmless, furry animals
      happily perched in front of the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha, tea!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He found relief in hailing the obvious, but he withdrew his
      feet from their perch by the fire and tucked them very
      close to his chair. It was to be inferred that Colonel
      Copredy was afraid of his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had a good walk?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down on the other chair with an air of boredom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly splendid!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid brought in the lamp, and Isobel began to pour out
      tea. She had filled one cup when she saw something white
      tucked away between her father's Norfolk jacket and the
      padded arm of his chair. Her hand remained poised over the
      sugar bowl, and Colonel Copredy looked uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Letters?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He suddenly remembered that there were letters, and he
      handed over two to her. She accepted them without a word,
      glanced at the envelopes, laid them in her lap, and took
      the lid off the toast dish. A moment later she had opened
      one of the letters and sat reading it. Her blue eyes grew
      harder, and a little angry crease showed between her
      eyebrows. When she had finished the letter she tore it up,
      and, leaning forward, threw the pieces into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Copredy looked at her a little anxiously, but she took
      no notice of him, finishing her tea in silence and with an
      air of fierce detachment. Her father picked up the magazine
      that he had been reading and tried to forget the young
      woman on the other side of the table. "I wish to heaven she
      would marry" was old Copredy's sincere and almost daily
      prayer, but his daughter's estimate of the blessed state of
      matrimony was not that of the Victorians.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was angry, unpleasantly angry, and when she left him
      her father gave a little heave of relief and allowed his
      slippers to creep out and warm themselves at the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something in that letter, I suppose," he reflected. "I
      can't make the girl out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Isobel had gone to her room, and it was very much her own
      room in colour and in temper. She had had it refurnished a
      year ago in electrical zigzags and jagged spasms of colour.
      The carpet was a grass-green pile, the walls old gold, the
      upholstery and curtains purple, the furniture modern red
      lacquer. There were huge wadded cushions in front of the
      fireplace. On the mantelpiece and the table were trophies,
      such as the fragment of a German bomb which had embedded
      itself in the body of the ambulance which Isobel Copredy
      had driven in France. The room was full of photos, mostly
      of men in uniform. One particular portrait in a red lacquer
      frame stood in the centre of the mantelpiece. An egg-shaped
      face with stupid and self-assertive eyes and a little black
      moustache looked out of the frame. The thing was signed in
      a heavy, ornate scrawl "Tabbs."
    </p>
    <p>
      Isobel Copredy went straight to this portrait. She took it
      in both hands and doubled the frame upon itself, for she
      was very strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear," she said, "I always knew you were a cad, but I
      did not think you were a silly cad. Good-byee!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And she threw the thing into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h1>
      LIFE
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton's mood was one of quiet enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was old enough to know that there would be times when he
      might expect to feel restless and lonely, but when neither
      loneliness nor disquietude attacked him he was conscious of
      interested surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place this simple life which he had chosen was
      full of hard work. Also he had a philosophy of his own, and
      a right view of things. He got up at daylight, and, going
      down into the old kitchen with its brown beams and brick
      floor, he lit his fire and made himself an early cup of
      tea. The cottage was cold on these February and March
      mornings, but young blood should not feel the cold, and
      Stretton did not feel it. His boiler gave him a hot bath at
      eight. He breakfasted anywhere between half-past eight and
      nine, lit a pipe, washed up and was ready for the day's
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had come to regard work as the true worker's inward food
      and the mob's discipline. Most men are indolent; he had
      learnt that in the army, and the curse of Adam lay heavy on
      their souls; yet he had seen the most inveterate slinker
      change into a creature of crude and bounding energy when a
      piece of leather was to be kicked about a field. "All work
      and no play makes Jack a dull boy." Yes, certainly, but the
      modern inclination to reverse the text makes for a still
      more fatuous dullness. But following the question of work,
      and work that might be made so interesting that it becomes
      play, led him full face against modern civilization and its
      industrial god, and there, like most men, he felt helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I suppose it won't last for ever. We shall regain
      control of the machine."
    </p>
    <p>
      But his view of work was a sound one. He discussed it one
      Sunday with Thomas Viner in a tramp round old Viner's
      fields. The farmer was kind to his beasts and just to his
      men; he had matured before the modern sentimental cult of
      the child and the worker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Stretton," said he, "when I was a younker my old
      father said to me: 'Now, my lad, what are you going to do
      for a living?' Just that. Now it seems to me it's the other
      way round."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How am I going to have a good time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, just that. What people seem to forget is that we
      weren't brought into this world to have a good time.
      There's a darned sight too much of the idea of having a
      good time. It's the butter to the bread, no doubt, but the
      bread comes first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The indignity of labour," laughed Stretton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a fact. Young wenches refusing to cook a meal and
      scrub floors because it's dull, because they can't get out
      to a picture-house or walk the streets every evening. Good
      lord, what sort of life do they have when they get married?
      And the lads too bright to handle a plough. It's the dull
      worker that makes dull work, Mr. Stretton."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point, just as they were climbing the stile into
      the "fourteen acre," John asked him a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you think it is all part of one thing, the revolt
      against the modern workshop idea, industrialism?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Viner paused astride the stile, his blue eyes looking
      into the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know anything about industrialism, but I do know
      the land. If a man can't be contented on the land--well,
      all I can say is there is something wrong with us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, if the men had the land."
    </p>
    <p>
      Viner got off the stile and prodded the bottom of a post
      with his stick to see if it was rotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've known farm labourers all my life, Mr. Stretton, and
      there's not one in ten who would be fit to run a farm.
      Talking's different from doing. Besides--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave Stretton one of his quiet smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most chaps want so much sure a week, their beer, and no
      bother. That's their limit. You don't see much of that in
      the papers. No, but it's the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      That he should talk to Thomas Viner on such a subject was
      but one of the many proofs of Stretton's seriousness in
      digging himself in. He looked beyond his cottage and his
      bit of woodland, and his philosophy sought to plant itself
      on the soil where it was to grow. He felt that a man should
      have right views, views that could boast a certain
      universality. He stood for the country as against the town,
      for the peasant idea as against the mechanical. He believed
      that life could be fuller, healthier, happier in the fields
      than in the streets, even though most modern men wilted to
      boredom away from trams and shops. He realized his own
      great advantages, the pride of ownership, his practical
      freedom from common cares, but in realizing this he felt an
      additional challenge, a more sensitive stimulus.
      Circumstances had pushed him into this particular life, and
      it was his business to re-act to them. If a man could not
      make money, at least he could grow things. Sweat of brain
      and body was a just and an elemental sweat. Self-discipline
      too was at the back of it as it had been at the back of the
      Cistercian idea. He was out to make good to himself, to
      block that leak in his brain, to let charity begin at home.
      "Dig in and get fit," that was how he expressed it, "and
      keep the devil of discontent on the other side of the
      wire."
    </p>
    <p>
      Work he had and plenty, but he added to it a love of
      beauty, the one sure love in life, that and the love of one
      particular woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      For company he took unto himself a black spaniel and a
      black cat, christening them Paul and Virginia. After one
      tentative quarrel in which Paul had his nose scratched,
      they settled down into their respective places before
      John's fire, Virginia on an old footstool just clear of the
      draught, Paul on the rug close to his master's chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      His housekeeping made him more sympathetic towards women,
      and appreciative of any labour-saving device or method. The
      one thing he loathed and always continued to loathe was
      washing up. He compromised with this hatred by buying a big
      tin bath and additional plates, cutlery and cups, and
      depositing the dirty ones in this bath with a dose of soda,
      and leaving them there until he had come to the end of his
      clean ware. Then he had an orgy of washing. This occurred
      every four days. As for his cooking, it was of the
      simplest, and Mary Viner helped him to solve that problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came up to call and caught this man-thing in his
      shirtsleeves prodding a half-roasted leg of mutton with a
      fork, utterly puzzled to know whether it was done or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Viner, you are an absolute God-send."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was more than that. She had liked this man from her
      very first glimpse of him; he appealed to her mother
      spirit; she had lost her one boy and the loss had left in
      her a deep, secret yearning. She did not trouble herself to
      wonder why Stretton was here living this very unusual life,
      knowing as she did that the cause of it was something
      connected with the war. Being a practical and warm-hearted
      woman she put her hand out to do what was obvious and
      necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Done? Bless me, no."
    </p>
    <p>
      She took off her coat and hat with a glance at him that
      said: "You dear innocent." She addressed herself to the
      cottage range and the leg of mutton, while Stretton sat on
      the table and watched her with a humorous smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was going to try fried potatoes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ought not to have to do this. Where are the potatoes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, in that frying-pan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see. Now I'm thinking that you can have your joint
      cooked in our kitchen. The boy can bring it up."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Stretton, looking at her kind, broad back and ruff of
      white hair, consented. Mrs. Mary was not a woman with whom
      it was necessary to parley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It wastes such a lot of my time," he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless you," she smiled, "you are the first man--Well, the
      war was an earthquake."
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw her mouth and eyes sadden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was," he agreed, and then he added, "it shook me out of
      a groove. I was told that I had to live a quiet sort of
      life or go under."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were you wounded?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shell-shocked. Oh, I shall get over it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you will," she said, "one can get over
      anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew that this was not quite true, but sympathy should
      not shy at a high hedge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes noticed other things, for he insisted on showing
      her over the cottage, and she was struck by its neatness
      and order; the number of books surprised her, but she saw
      pathos in that bath full of crockery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why don't you have a lad up to do that for you? Sam is the
      stupidest thing on earth, but he could wash plates."
    </p>
    <p>
      His answer surprised her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Viner, I mean to be thorough."
    </p>
    <p>
      She went home pondering that remark of his, understanding
      it and yet not understanding it. Her feeling was that it
      was a question of character, of a very lovable and quaint
      character. He would be thorough in all that he did, in
      sewing on a button or in loving a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the work within was necessitous and irksome, the work in
      the open air had much sheer physical joy in it. Here again
      the Viner spirit was useful in providing this new
      countryman with the necessary facts. The farmer came up and
      smoked a pipe, heard what Stretton's ideas were, and going
      over the ground with him, said nothing for quite a long
      while, but touched things with his eyes and poked the
      ground with his stick. He was in no hurry. His sunburnt and
      sagacious head had matured its knowledge slowly, and he
      knew that Nature goes her own pace and that man had best
      keep time with her. The four-barred gate on his forehead
      grew slightly more marked, and his eyes seemed bluer. He
      told John not to hurry. "Go steady. Tackle one job at a
      time, and master it. Books, yes, you can learn from books,
      but you'll learn more by doing things for yourself and
      making mistakes. Get your ground dug first for your garden
      crops." Stretton's plan necessitated the building of a
      small cart-lodge and stable, a cow house and byre, a
      piggery, and one or two odd sheds for feeding-stuffs and
      tools. He told Thomas Viner that he wanted to do everything
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get section buildings. You could find a man to give you a
      hand with bolting them together. What about the roofing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton wanted thatch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not going to spoil this place. If the buildings were
      stained brown and worked in among the trees and thatched
      they would melt into the woodland."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay; I can put you on to a good thatcher, but it's not
      cheap, and it means renewing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mind that. Look here, Mr. Viner, if I draw out a
      plan will you put it right for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My first job seems to be the garden, and fencing off the
      ground you are letting me have in that upper field. Isn't
      that so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that's so. Dig the ground first, and get your crops
      in. You can put up the fence later. I shan't be turning any
      beasts into the field; it's down for hay."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Stretton drew his plan, and took it down to Romans Farm
      one March evening. He and old Viner went over it before the
      fire, with Mrs. Viner apportioning her interest between it
      and her work-basket. It was quite a good plan, and well
      thought out, and Tom Viner said so. Stretton had a
      headpiece and the gift of foreseeing things and spacing
      them out. He had followed the French idea of a central yard
      with the various buildings grouped round it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan was approved. It was a farmyard in miniature; it
      would not expand well, but where was the land to justify
      expansion?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anyhow," said Stretton, "it will keep me busy for a good
      long time."
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrote to Car asking him to recommend a firm who could
      supply the buildings, and then fell to with his spade.
      Having dealt with the cottage garden, and met the first
      green of the spring in the old elder tree by the back door,
      he attacked his new ground at the top of the field under
      the south-east brim of the wood. Viner had warned him that
      he would have to wire against rabbits, but that the wiring
      could be left for another month. Stretton set himself to
      bastard-trench a quarter of an acre, and never having done
      any serious digging in his life before, he went to work
      with such fierceness and wasted so much energy that he had
      no back left, or, rather, he was all back and blisters by
      three in the afternoon. The trenching of that ground taught
      him much, how to handle his tool and save himself, and the
      secret of going steady. He began to understand the rhythmic
      and seemingly otiose movements of the countryman in
      ploughing, digging, scything, or pitching hay. Nature sets
      her pace. The greater wisdom lies in discovering and
      following a rhythm.
    </p>
    <p>
      He learnt to give himself ten minutes in every hour, when
      he would stand and lift his eyes to other things and all
      the beauty of them and their ever familiar strangeness. He
      saw the woodlands growing purple with swelling buds, a
      richer greenness in the grass, a deeper blue in the sky. He
      learnt to know the distant hills in all their varying
      moods. He began to study the sky and to feel the weather.
      He found his consciousness opening to all manner of new
      impressions. He saw things which he would never have seen
      six months ago, subtle shades of colour, changeful
      atmospheres, weeds, the varying texture of the trees,
      birds, clouds. He became aware of life, the world around
      him, as motion, a flowing, an expanding; even the hills
      seemed to breathe. Never had he realized how blind was the
      life of the streets. It was like consciousness being
      bottled and sealed up in a glass tube, cut off from all
      that mysterious sense of growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very happy those first two months, if to be
      interested is to be happy. Car and Lavinia, who paid him
      two surprise visits during that period, were struck by his
      air of cheerful and wholesome tranquillity. And he looked
      most extraordinarily fit and strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother was delighted with him and with everything she
      saw. She had arrived with a large hamper, as though
      visiting a boy at school, but what delighted her most was
      the frank and easy way in which he talked to her. He seemed
      to have lost the too sharp edge of his self-consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is just the life for me," he told her. "Beal is a
      very wise man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you not like to have a box of books sent down every
      month, John?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear old mater, I am working about twelve hours a day and
      sleeping nine. I go to bed and sleep like the dead. When I
      do read I read about growing cabbages, or how to prune
      fruit trees, and the effect of basic slag on clover."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, you will soon be quite a farmer. I think that
      Ottways looks such a sweet old house."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had her eye on Ottways, and she saw John in it with a
      gentle and docile wife, a wife who did not obtrude too much
      upon the picture, but who would give him three or four dear
      children.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This old place suits me very well, mater."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, now, dear; but I always think of you as a
      country gentleman and a man of property."
    </p>
    <p>
      John, smiling his tranquil smile, left it at that.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Car he was a little less communicative, perhaps because
      there was something in Car's eyes that puzzled him. Car
      looked at him as Rollin Beal had looked at him in the days
      when he had been more the physician than the friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Got to know any of the people, Jack?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Viners. They have been jolly good to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about Ottways? The colonel man ought to be knowable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have never seen him," said Stretton with perfect
      innocence. "I don't think Ottways interests me."
    </p>
    <p>
      It never occurred to him that he might interest Ottways,
      and when Colonel Copredy walked up one April afternoon and
      called on him, he caught Stretton weeding the brick path
      which led from the blue gate to the front door of the
      cottage. Both men were surprised. Stretton was without a
      collar, and wearing an old pair of army "slacks" and a
      blue-and-white cotton shirt. Hereward Copredy had been a
      dandy in his day; he was a meticulous little man in spite
      of his grey slippers, and he stood at the gate like a sleek
      and conventional robin. That this collarless young man
      should be his landlord seemed slightly improper. On social
      occasions old Copredy wore an eyeglass, and he wore it
      to-day; his daughter had suggested this social occasion,
      and even an eyeglass may focus peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, Mr. Stretton, I presume?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very jerky and stiff. John pushed his basket of
      weeds aside with a brown boot and walked to the gate. His
      eyes awaited an explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am Colonel Copredy, of Ottways. Landlord and tenant, you
      know, and fellow officers."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was an immense concession, and Copredy would never
      have made it had he not felt very uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton asked him in. He was quite at his ease, and when a
      man of Copredy's years took the trouble to walk a couple of
      miles to call on him the response was instinctive. He was
      very polite to Hereward Copredy, nor did he take any active
      dislike to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were incompatible, and there the matter might have
      ended, but old Copredy had been made the vehicle of a
      suggestion, and his acquiescence in the carrying out of the
      suggestion was less unselfish than it seemed. He wanted to
      get his daughter married, and he did not mind whom she
      married provided the man had a little money, and was not an
      absolute outsider. Isobel had inherited her mother's money,
      a safe three hundred a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must find life very quiet up here," said the colonel,
      looking round John's sitting-room for the inspiration of a
      golf club, a tennis racket or a gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm kept busy, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Play any games?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't time for games."
    </p>
    <p>
      Copredy looked uncomfortable, and as though he wondered
      what the devil the chap did with himself, and Virginia,
      stealing in at that moment, sprang upon his knees. He gave
      a little shout, and dropped his eyeglass, for he had a
      horror of cats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton deposited Virginia out of the window and closed
      the door. Copredy was readjusting his eyeglass and trying
      to think of something to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the war, weren't you, Mr. Stretton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The --th East Surreys."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha! Territorial battalion. You must come down and dine
      with us some evening; no formalities, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Stretton told Colonel Copredy the truth, though
      why he should have told it to this man of all men was a
      problem in the disentanglement of impulses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is very good of you to ask me, but, you see, I'm not
      going anywhere. I got rather messed up in the war, and I
      had to side-track myself down here. I am not in a position
      to know anybody."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so frank and matter of fact about it that his
      visitor was reduced to helplessness. You could not pretend
      to sympathize with a man under such conditions, or ask him
      what the particular mess had been, and whether it had
      included a court martial. Old Copredy was a gentleman, and
      he dried up into a very stiff and inarticulate form of
      courtesy. After all, the man had been honest about it,
      extraordinarily frank, and without any suggestion of
      bitterness or defiance. He looked at Stretton's boots, made
      a few remarks about the country and the weather, and then
      got up to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton accompanied him to the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was good of you to walk up all this way. I hope you
      understand, sir, why I prefer to keep out of social
      affairs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, quite, Mr. Stretton, quite," said old Copredy, looking
      thoroughly ill at ease; "afraid I've--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not in the least."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton held the gate open for him, and Copredy walked
      back over the heath, feeling that Stretton was somehow a
      gentleman, prejudice or no prejudice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Funked something, I suppose," he thought, "or got in a
      mess over money. Of course, these 'temporaries,' one has to
      make allowances--"
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he remembered a scandal of the kind happening in a
      regular battalion to a real soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, young Sullivan. Young fool! A pity, a great pity.
      Well, that ought to satisfy Isobel."
    </p>
    <p>
      Which showed how little he knew about women, for it is
      sufficient to tell certain women that a particular man is a
      bad hat for that man to become thoroughly interesting. Of
      course, the interest varies with the nature of the badness
      and the style of the hat.

      SUGGESTION
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Once a fortnight Stretton rode into Kingsbury on a
      second-hand bicycle which he had bought in Willowmaston
      village, and he was returning from one of these expeditions
      when he had his second meeting with Isobel Copredy. He had
      passed Willowmaston park and was riding slowly up the long
      avenue of beeches beyond it when he overtook a girl
      wheeling a bicycle, the back tyre of which was flat.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her head as he came up, recognized him, and made
      a display of pausing. The invitation was natural and
      obvious, as obvious and as excusable as that flat tyre.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Stretton, could you lend me a hand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He dismounted, never suspecting that he was making his
      first and imperceptible descent from the tranquillity of
      his simple life up yonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Punctured?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I think it is only the valve, and I haven't a spare
      piece of tubing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I have that."
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned his bicycle against the trunk of a beech tree,
      and opened the leather tool-bag. It was very still here
      under the beeches whose leaves were unfolding in their
      first soft brilliance. The air was full of the drifting
      brown scales from the expanding buds, and already the
      avenue had that wonderful greenish light and that sense of
      innocent and fresh coolness. The banks beyond the trees
      were covered with bluebells, and the faint smell of them
      was unforgettable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton bent down and removed the valve while Isobel
      Copredy held the machine and watched him. As a man he was
      pleasing to her. She liked the set of his head, his brown
      leanness, his freckles, the crispness of his hair over the
      temples, the alert aloofness of his eyes. She noticed his
      brown hands with their long well-formed fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it's the valve."
    </p>
    <p>
      He showed her the perished tubing, and their eyes met as
      she bent over the machine. It is possible that the light
      under the green foliage softened the girl's over-rich
      colouring and the hardness of her eyes, for Stretton was
      not repelled as he had been repelled on that previous
      occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you a spare piece?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      She watched him fit the new piece of tubing, and noticed
      that he was very deft with his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid I have grown rather casual about this old
      machine. I expect a car next week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you are getting a car?" but his voice lacked interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A two-seater. So useful for golf and tennis. I stay away
      with people a good deal, and if there is one thing I loathe
      it's a train."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, so anonymous."
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that a dig at me? I can take chaff. I drove an
      ambulance in France during the war."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was screwing the nozzle of the pump to the valve, and he
      did not raise his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, the war," he said; "don't you want to forget about
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw his neck redden, and he began to work the pump with
      some fierceness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, yes and no."
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew that she had penetrated his guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the business of inflating the tyre was over, Stretton
      raised his hat to her and mounted his machine as though he
      meant to ride on alone, but she was an adept at ignoring
      anything that she wished to ignore, and they went up the
      hill side by side. There were one or two stiffish
      gradients, but she rode up them more easily than he did.
      She drew her breath a little more rapidly, and her colour
      deepened, and there was a subtle, sexual provocation in her
      more hurried breathing and in her deepening colour.
      Stretton felt it and was vaguely distressed by it. At the
      top of the last rise she let her machine swerve momentarily
      nearer to him, and her eyes smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing in it," she said, "but I think I could have beaten
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her frankness reassured him, for he thought it more like
      the frankness of a boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I dare say!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Male complacency! Do you know that once during the war our
      tug-of-war team challenged a scratch lot of officers, and
      we beat them? Their faces!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather a shock!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were nearing Ottways, and she rode along with her
      defiant head in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you find it very lonely up in that wood?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She put the question so suddenly that he was tricked into
      answering it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. Why should I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well, if you like it that is your affair, isn't it?
      But after the war--and all the jolly, sporting pals one
      had!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He imagined that Colonel Copredy had told her nothing of
      his visit to Mascall's Wood and of the surprise he had
      received there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I keep a cat and dog," he said with a little ironical
      twist of the mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him a quick, almost intimate look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor man! Well, I get off here. Au revoir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton noticed something about her as she got off her
      machine and pushed open one of the iron gates, the
      something that a man notices without being able to help
      himself. The sex in her mocked him, making him aware of her
      as a woman, a woman who had a little swagger in her
      movements, a conscious provocation. "See here, my lad, I'm
      worth hunting." He found himself looking at her ankles, the
      set of her skirt, her slim legs, her plump brown neck, her
      radiant skin. He remembered the smell of the scent she
      used, for he had smelled it when she was bending over him
      while he was tinkering with her bicycle. He would have
      called it a decadent scent, a night-club perfume, and yet
      it seemed to come as a natural odour from the sleek
      smartness of her that was the smile of a sly and ironical
      sexual self-consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a jerk to his hat and rode on. He felt that he
      disliked this young woman, and that he disliked her because
      a part of him was afraid. He admired red hair, and yet this
      hair of hers was burnished, audacious and hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn!" he said, and tried to pull his thoughts clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was aware now of what she suggested, just as Car had
      been caught by the same suggestion. It is not usual to
      credit women with the lust of adventure, but adventure was
      in Isobel Copredy's blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not help it, and she did not want to help it, but
      it sometimes spelt tragedy and bitterness for some man, and
      perhaps for some other woman, "Provocative yet
      unsatisfying"--that was how a particular man had once
      described her, and he had clinched the description with a
      word which men use only when they are alone together. It is
      doubtful whether John Stretton had ever used it, for he had
      never had anything to do with that sort of woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he wheeled his bicycle over Burnt Heath he was conscious
      of a twinge of loneliness, just as though a girl's casual
      suggestion could produce the actual feeling. He realized
      that he did not matter to anybody, save perhaps to his
      mother. But he was on his guard. The devil of discontent
      has the face of a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What use is your philosophy, my lad?" he reflected, "if it
      crumples up on the first hot day."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he neared the cottage he heard Paul howling, another
      victim of loneliness, tied up in the wood-shed. Stretton
      smiled a smile that was half grim, half gentle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall a man howl like a dog? Poor old Paul!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was glad of the dog's welcome, a boisterous,
      warm-hearted welcome, and he fondled the spaniel as he had
      never fondled him before. Virginia minced in, yellow-eyed
      and rather supercilious, and ready to remind the man that
      there are such things as saucers and milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, you hussy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And then it occurred to him that it must be rather pleasant
      to be met by a woman, his happy, deep-eyed, ideal woman,
      not a brazen goddess with flaming hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no doubt," he said with a shrug, and preparing to wait
      upon Virginia; "but that's not in the scheme. It seems to
      me that it never can be."
    </p>
    <p>
      By way of discipline he went out and hoed weeds till the
      dusk fell.
    </p>

      LA BELLE DAME SANS MERCI

    <p>
      Isobel Copredy's attitude to life and to men can be
      explained by extracts from a diary which she had kept for
      the last five years. It was a rather extraordinary piece of
      human self-analysis, supremely sincere in its egotism, and
      quite fearless in its facing of certain facts. On the
      opening page she had written a number of concise and
      pointed sayings, adding to them from time to time in her
      bold, hard, confident hand:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "The great thing in life is to be the player and not the
      instrument.<br>
      <br>
      "A woman remains interesting only so long as she continues
      to interest men.<br>
      <br>
      "It is a great mistake to imagine that men begin things.
      The provocation always comes from the woman.<br>
      <br>
      "There are two ways of regarding marriage: as an opening or
      a closing door--the French way and the English. Personally
      I prefer to do without a door.<br>
      <br>
      "Most men are very dull fish when once you have got them
      hooked.<br>
      <br>
      "A woman who neglects her complexion is immoral.<br>
      <br>
      "After all, with all our talk about beauty and spirituality
      and ideals, what does it all come to? Trying to make the
      best of the inside of an ugly house.<br>
      <br>
      "Take care of your teeth, and see that the heels of your
      shoes do not turn over.<br>
      <br>
      "Have a good time now. If you are worth it you will get it.
      If you are not worth it, be religious.<br>
      <br>
      "Sentiments are like clothes. Their effectiveness depends
      upon how they are worn. In supreme moments of honest
      naturalness you do without them.<br>
      <br>
      "All the same, the petticoat was the greatest of all
      feminine inventions.<br>
      <br>
      "The war was a great adventure; the most wonderful mixture
      of tosh and reality. Like champagne, it made a lot of us
      behave just as we wanted to behave. We insisted on getting
      our bite at life. Now we are returning to our trick of
      nibbling at the sugar icing, or sneaking an occasional
      cherry.<br>
      <br>
      "I refuse to humbug myself. But you must humbug other
      people. That's civilization."
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It was a supreme misfortune for John Stretton that he
      should have begun to interest this merciless young woman.
      She was piqued by his unusualness; she said so quite
      frankly in her diary.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "This Adam is afraid of me. It talks with God in its garden
      and covers everything with fig leaves; and I believe that
      it is perfectly sincere. It has always made me laugh to
      think of meeting a Galahad. I never have, outside a
      book.<br>
      <br>
      "Adam interests me. He looks as brown as a berry. He has a
      past, and is trying to bury it in his garden. It would be
      so much easier to wash it and hang it up to dry on the
      line. He keeps a dog and a cat, wears no collar, and is
      very much out of Eden.<br>
      <br>
      "I suppose I ought to pity him. I do. Someone once told
      me--I think it was 'Tabbs'--that I must have been a beastly
      kid who never played with a doll. Quite right; I didn't. It
      was not my fault. I am not made that way.<br>
      <br>
      "If Adam insists on remaining in the garden I shall have to
      introduce the serpent!"
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      That was her trouble, this daughter of disillusionment; she
      lacked the mother spirit and all that it implied. Not that
      the rearing of children necessarily makes people more
      pleasant; it makes them more patient and more resigned or
      autocratic; they become sentimentalists or Puritans. The
      point is, children spell discomfort, hard work, a great
      deal of giving up, especially on the woman's side. She
      cannot be a mother and insist on herself all the time. Even
      her breasts suggest that. But Isobel Copredy did insist on
      being herself, always and everywhere. She would not give
      up; she would not suffer; and without giving up and without
      suffering there are certain things which we humans do not
      learn. We remain nasty, self-assertive children with a
      little more cynical cleverness added to our nastiness.
      Feeling is understanding. Unless we feel we do not
      sympathize or understand. A man may be a senior wrangler
      and at the same time the most pathetic and pestilent fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Isobel Copredy poor Stretton was a new and rather
      unusual toy. She was quite ready to take his struggling
      ideal and to play with it, and to break it in the game. She
      did not feel the necessity for ideals. She was just a
      strong, self-assertive, greedy child, with an unpleasant
      knack of seeing life naked. She had a passion for
      adventure, any sort of adventure, and she would have
      enjoyed nothing more than plaguing St. Anthony in the
      desert.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is doubtful whether she realized that a life such as
      Stretton's spelt struggle and spiritual sweat. The thing
      was ridiculous. Why cry over spilt milk? Go and buy another
      jug of it. She saw no dignity, no pathos in this man's
      self-isolation, his hard labour, his passion to prove
      himself, to plant himself among simple things and to grow.
      Had she known the whole truth it is doubtful whether she
      would have pitied him. Most probably she would have
      despised him as a man who had surrendered, and who had
      failed in the cut-throat game of making money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway, the country was dull; she had broken with her
      latest playmate; she was rather short of money and had no
      very exciting social distractions on hand. Moreover,
      Stretton piqued her; she liked his freckles and his
      leanness, his stag-like head and quick eyes. She knew that
      he was afraid of her, and she knew why. One thing she did
      not and could not know--that she was the female counterpart
      of the male type that had provoked in him those strange
      outbursts of blind, physical fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one end of the Ottways' tennis court there happened to
      be a lime tree that was a little in the way. The previous
      landlord had refused to allow the Copredys to fell it, and
      this lime tree now took part in another game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton received a letter:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "DEAR MR. STRETTON,--I am writing for my father to ask you
      whether you have any objection to our felling a tree--not a
      big one--which spoils our tennis court. It is too close to
      the back line and cramps that side of the court.--Yours
      truly, ISOBEL COPREDY."
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton frowned over this letter. The part of him which
      she antagonized was in the ascendant. He wrote to her quite
      politely to say that he did not approve of felling trees.
      Could not the court be shifted?
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, he was felling some of his own trees
      in one of the plantations where they needed thinning, and
      there were also quite a number of dead larches which had to
      be cut out. He wanted fence posts, and they were here for
      the labour of getting. He did not know his lady, or the
      laugh she would have of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drove her new two-seater right up over the heath to the
      Cottage, picking her way along the turf track, and, leaving
      the car by the gate, went in search of her victim. Stretton
      was in the wood, felling a fir. He had not heard the car,
      and Isobel Copredy, strolling up the ride between the two
      stretches of woodland, heard his felling axe at work. She
      stood still and smiled. The humour of the surprise was
      self-evident.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton did not see her till she was quite close upon him.
      It was a hot day in May, with air full of hover flies and
      the scent of the pines. Bracken was springing up
      everywhere, and in the tops of the trees a pigeon was
      calling. The trunk of a felled fir lay along the ground,
      its branches raising one end of it so that it suggested a
      great hobby-horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was smiling, mischievous, a little ironical.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please don't stop. I will wait till you have finished
      throwing that tree."
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat herself down on the trunk of the fir, her legs
      crossed, the burnished swathes of her red hair showing
      under the brim of her black hat. Stretton was leaning on
      the handle of the felling axe, trying to think of something
      to say to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you do fell trees sometimes!" And she laughed. "Please
      finish that one, and then I'll talk to you about mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her, and was more aware of the May morning and
      the smell of the pines. She had rolled up the sleeves of
      her green jumper and her forearms showed white.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it's about that tree?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I want you to come down and look at it. I have got my
      new car outside your gate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Outside my gate?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did a cross-country stunt to test the springs."
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at the tree that he was felling, and it was
      easy to see that he was very raw at the job. Instead of
      cutting out a neat wedge and then sawing towards it through
      the trunk, he had been mangling the fir with his axe, and
      the bole showed a white collar of hacked wood. Isobel
      Copredy had seen lumbermen at work during the war, and she
      knew how a tree should be felled. She knew, too, that the
      conventional attitude for the woman is to appear to know
      less than the man, but her theory was to cut across the
      conventions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you got a saw?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      His glance was veiled yet inquiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll show you how the Canadians do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She jumped up, and picking up the saw started to make a cut
      across the trunk some three inches above the mangled
      collar. She knelt on one knee, while Stretton stood by with
      an air of sulky surprise and resentful helplessness,
      wishing her at Jericho. And then his eyes fixed themselves
      on the nape of her neck. She had a very comely neck; white
      and sensuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How you are hating me for showing you this!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, you are. But why should a woman always be
      expected to be a fool? I'm not a fool."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him a glimmer of the eyes, and something shot
      through him. He stiffened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope I am always ready to learn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      She resumed her sawing, her chin thrust forward, her face
      aglow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, you might give me your coat to kneel on."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did so, folding it up and placing it for her while she
      drew aside and smiled at him. A strand of hair had slipped
      down across her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bother!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She whipped off her hat, and, sticking the pins back into
      it, gave it him to hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no. I'm only starting the job for you. You shall use
      your arms in a minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the cut was about three inches deep she withdrew the
      saw and got up, flushed and out of breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, do you think you can cut a neat wedge? Wait, I'll
      have a shot myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      She took the axe and left him holding her hat much as a shy
      boy holds a cup and saucer at a tea party, and she used the
      axe cleanly and with more precision than Stretton had
      shown, striking slanting blows that brought the
      wedge-shaped chips scattering to the ground. Presently she
      paused, out of breath and roguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now do you see the idea? You take the saw and cut across
      towards the notch, and the tree comes over this way."
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded, and handing her back her hat set to work, while
      she stood and watched him. It took Stretton nearly twenty
      minutes to saw through the trunk towards the notch she had
      cut, and all that time neither of them uttered a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look out. She's quivering."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood back, but though the top swayed slightly, the tree
      still held.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You haven't a steel wedge?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They knock in a wedge on the far side, and that sends the
      tree over. Come on, let's try pushing."
    </p>
    <p>
      She put both hands to the trunk, but though the line of the
      saw-cut gaped, she was not strong enough to start the fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on, both together," she said with a quick turn of the
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      He joined her; he was taller than she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put your arms over my shoulders and be ready to jump
      clear."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a cracking of wood, and the trunk swung away from
      them more quickly than either of them had expected.
      Stretton had to save himself and the girl; he caught her
      and pulled her back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry, but I had to."
    </p>
    <p>
      The tree had crashed, and he dropped his arms; but she
      remained touching him and looking up over one shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will know how to do it another time."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood back from her, looking stiff and shy, and a little
      confused. His shyness amused her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope so. I say, I have trodden on your hat!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was delighted. She began to laugh, and Stretton had to
      laugh with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that's splendid!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She picked it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have made a new shape. Heavens, and my hair is coming
      down!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head, and the red swathes tumbled on her
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, rescue the pins, will you? This comes of lumbering
      with a man! Do you mind if I go into your place and put
      myself straight? I suppose I shall find a mirror?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was pulling the pins out of her hair while Stretton
      groped for the ones that had fallen. He had a feeling of
      bewilderment, of passionate embarrassment. He hated her,
      but he hated her with desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry. Please make any use of my place."
    </p>
    <p>
      He became very punctilious and polite, shy of her and still
      more shy of himself. At that time he had no reason to think
      her anything but a mischievous tomboy, but all the glow and
      movement and breathlessness of her had gone to his head. He
      had lived alone and suppressed himself for months, and her
      body had touched his, and he was ashamed. It was quite
      absurd, this queer sense of humiliation. He was angry with
      himself and he was angry with her. What the devil did she
      want to come playing about here for? It was all wrong. For
      there was a part of him that was wiser than he knew, a
      voice that cried fiercely, "Hold off, hold off!" And he
      held off with that chivalry which is ready to smite itself
      in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him an intimate, observant look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now I am going to drive you down to look at my tree. I
      have helped you with yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      He wanted to refuse, and he couldn't. He felt that he owed
      her something after having felt about her as he had.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about these clothes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mind them," she said. "Now, if you will let me go
      and tidy my hair."
    </p>
    <p>
      He picked up his coat and took her through the woodlands to
      the cottage. She had grown demure, sleek and silent, amused
      by his air of courteous aloofness, and understanding it
      better than he guessed. In her housemaid language, he was a
      nice boy, and had been taught to behave nicely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I have a mirror?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will find one in the sitting-room," he said rather
      curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained outside the gate, and she weighed his motives
      in leaving the cottage to herself. He was pretending to
      look at the new car, and as she put her hair up in his
      sitting-room she watched him through the window. Also she
      gathered a quick impression of the room itself, a room in
      which there was not a single photo, and where pipes and
      books lay about. It was a completely male room, cleanly and
      healthily so.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You innocent!" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was quietly yet pleasantly formal as she drove him down
      over the heath past the gate of Romans Farm to Ottways. He
      admired her handling of the car. They did not meet a soul
      in the lanes, and at Ottways he condemned the lime tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      She offered to drive him back, but he refused, and there
      was an air of finality about his refusal. He had condemned
      the tree and escaped meeting Colonel Copredy, who had gone
      fishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the end of it," he thought as he walked back to
      Mascall's Wood to resume his tree felling, whereas Isobel
      Copredy assumed it to be the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the lane by Romans Farm Stretton fell in with Thomas
      Viner. Old Viner was wearing his white linen coat and a
      sun-stained Panama hat with the brim turned up at the back.
      His shrewd eyes looked out kindly from under this shelf of
      shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, it's good weather. I was coming up to see how your
      land's looking. Come in and have a cup of tea with us, Mr.
      Stretton."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton was glad of old Viner; he was one of those
      reassuringly stolid and comfortable people who are good for
      us when the soul is vexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll come in if you'll walk up afterwards."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      From his cottage windows Stretton had watched the spring
      touch Romans Farm; he had seen a whiteness gathered about
      it, the blossom on its orchard trees. A little later the
      red-brown roofs and walls had sunk deeper and deeper into a
      mist of green. The growth of the year flowed round it,
      secretly and with a mysterious stealth. The grass
      lengthened, and in wild corners sheep's parsley and pink
      campion rioted together. The windows looked out through
      greenness at the soft distances of an English landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton had glanced often towards the farm. He saw it in
      the early sunlight, at full noon, in the evening, and
      always it spoke to him of peace. The peace of the place
      cooled his thoughts and effaced the glow of Isobel
      Copredy's provocative colouring. It was a house that
      accepted you, put you in a comfortable chair, and soothed
      you with simple sounds such as the crackling of the wood
      fire or the humming of the bees in the honeysuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton liked its funny chintzes, its Victorian furniture,
      its faded carpets, its broad simplicity. You did not get
      too much light in the room. The ceilings were low, the
      walls full of cupboards. He liked Mrs. Viner's teacups, big
      white cups with narrow bands of gold on them, her red
      velvet tea-cosy, her bread and butter, her home-made cake.
      And he liked her. She seemed to him to be just what an
      elderly woman should be, proof against all weathers,
      mellow, homely.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was putting wallflowers in the vases, and she went on
      arranging the flowers while her husband wandered off to
      give his carter some orders. Stretton took the chair by one
      of his open windows where a curtain breathed gently to and
      fro.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I like the smell of them," she told him. "Jess always will
      have flowers in the house when she is at home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Jess your daughter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The youngest. I suppose we shall have her back some day."
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at Stretton and, crossing to the mantelpiece,
      took down a photograph and brought it for him to see.
      Stretton got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's Jess. She had her hair down then, you see."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton looked at her photograph with inward
      inattentiveness. He just held it in his hand and stared. He
      saw a rather thin girl of sixteen with her hair upon her
      shoulders, frank eyes and a sensitive mouth. She still
      looked rather childish and undeveloped. There seemed
      nothing vivid about her, nothing to arrest his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How old is she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Jess is twenty-six now," said Mary Viner, resuming
      possession of the photograph. "That's a poor thing. She has
      filled out a lot; you would not know Jess by that."
    </p>
    <p>
      She replaced the portrait on the mantelpiece, and the
      tea-tray and Tom Viner arrived together. After tea he and
      Stretton walked up to Mascall's Wood. Stretton had
      forgotten all about Jessie Viner's picture; it had made no
      impression on him; in fact, he had thought her rather a
      plain child. He took Thomas Viner to look at his potatoes.

      THE THUNDERSTORM
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The soul of man when vexed and hard pressed makes its
      escape into mysticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton had dug his ground, put in his crops, and built
      his fence. Two section buildings had arrived and were
      waiting to be erected, but he was too busy to deal with
      them at present. He had his hands full of the growth of the
      year, the first growth of the kind that he had ever known.
      He was filled with excitements and exultations. When his
      potatoes came pushing through the soil he looked on the
      phenomenon as though it were a miracle. His strings of
      young lettuce, all gold and green, his trenches of peas,
      his beans, were equally fascinating and wonderful. He sowed
      his marrow and cucumber seeds like an incredulous child,
      and was conscious of a moment of astonishment when he saw
      the green seed-leaves showing in the pots. He hoed, he
      weeded, he thinned out, he hung over his garden-frames like
      a mother over a cradle. In the cool of the evening he would
      stroll about his little estate with the black spaniel at
      his heels, sharing in the meditation of his trees, looking
      at the flowers--old cottage flowers--in his two borders, at
      the red may tree, the white thorns on the heath, the yellow
      gorge, the blue distances beyond the Willowmaston valley.
      He was obsessed by the wonder of it all, the beauty. The
      vein of mysticism in him deepened and grew enriched; he was
      not very actively conscious of it as yet, but he was to be
      very conscious of it later.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so absorbed in life, active, growing life during
      those months of May and June that La Belle Dame sans Merci
      had no power over him at all. He met her fairly frequently;
      it surprised him how often they happened to meet; he still
      thought her innocent, a little irresponsible and impulsive,
      for like many sensitive men he thought most women innocent.
      Sometimes, in the heat of the day or at night, he had vague
      and troublesome thoughts of her, but they were not so vivid
      and compelling as to vex either his spirit or his flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rollin Beal, who paid him a flying visit about that time,
      found him brown and bright-eyed and happy. He put Beal up
      for the night, himself sleeping in his old camp bed. They
      sat up late on the edge of the heath, talking of many
      things, and it was when they were carrying their chairs in
      from the heath that Stretton asked Beal a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want you to tell me something. It doesn't affect me now,
      but it might do some day. Ought I to marry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal let some seconds pass before answering him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a while," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had reached the gate and they paused there in the
      moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ought to qualify that answer, Jack. I want to see you go
      for a year without anything happening. It is not a question
      of the thing being transmissible to your children."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The point is: you ought not to take a woman into
      partnership until you are sure of your liabilities."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton stood very still.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly," he said. "I don't mind telling you that I am one
      of those people who has a high idea of marriage. I don't
      believe in all the modern makeshift stuff. That's why I
      feel it my duty to keep clear of women."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That should depend on the woman. Sex is both complex and
      very simple."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know what my test will be, Beal?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall not be conscious of the sex in her when I meet
      her. What I mean is--it will all be subtilized,
      transfigured. I often wonder whether people really love in
      these days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, they do, a few of them. As a doctor I have seen
      what death means. Go on being a practical mystic."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that is your diagnosis?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Trust your intuition."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet life fluctuates like the seasons; it is full of periods
      of growth, flowering, decay, and youth may be more
      sensitive to these changes and less master of them and
      their meaning. Relaxation comes after effort, a relaxation
      that is fretted with moments of restlessness, vague
      discontents, a passionate desire for some other form of
      self-expression. Youth has to learn to ride on the great
      adventure and how to use its weapons. Often it fights when
      it should laugh, and it laughs too little. It has moods of
      immense seriousness; it goes on its knees, is violent
      inspired, overwhelmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And through it all runs the red blood which will not turn
      to milk, however much we pray. Here instinct may be wiser
      than we know. Youth divines this, the youth which dreams
      and refuses to be brow-beaten by the cynics. Was there wine
      or red blood in the grail, or wine and blood together? Why
      will scoffers confuse the love match with the lust match?
      Stretton divined all this as many a young man and woman
      have divined it. "Only by love can I be saved." Yes, and by
      such and such a love in which the sex in us is glorified
      and transfigured into a sacrament of tenderness and
      compassion. So youth leaps through the gate of marriage,
      holding his mate by the hand, expecting a garden, and
      finding thickets and crooked paths. But let that first love
      last; let the hands hold fast. Love learns; it grows wise,
      if it be patient. Always in the man's mind the thought, "I
      have taken her life in my hands; shall I break it?" In the
      woman's, "I have taken his life into my bosom. Shall I let
      it grow cold?" Courage, a courage that is never petulant
      and mean, a compassion that reaches understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      For nothing that is worth having is won too easily in this
      life, and the great comradeship is the worthiest of them
      all. We work for success in business. How many of us work
      for success in that other and much more blessed venture?
      How many men have failed or made but a half success for
      lack of this great comradeship? How many women have grieved
      and shrivelled because they could not give all that a woman
      longs to give? It is easy to say that Nature dresses up sex
      to fool us. Yes, and many are fooled. But is not the sense
      of our foolishness the beginning of all wisdom? Life is a
      maze. It may be that only the few are fated to find the
      inner sanctuary, the few who have courage, the few who
      refuse to sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the prime growth of the year was over came a period of
      relaxation. July was fickle and wet, and though full of
      greenness, sad as only England can be sad. Stretton had his
      first twinge of restlessness. Looking back it seemed to him
      that all the world had mated and that he was out of time
      with the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as though he smelt the salt sea and longed for it.
      He bethought him of old corners in France, old billets,
      some laughing French girl, his seasons of leave. He
      remembered Leicester Square on a hot August night, the
      river about Marlow, punts, the flickering shadows of great
      trees, the still water, a white dress, the voices of girls,
      boys bathing. Rude life surged in him, and he fought it
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      And why?
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked himself that question as he sat in the bracken one
      close night and watched the moon rise over the hills. Nor
      had he any very definite answer to give. Vaguely he felt
      the insurgent restlessness in him to be an enemy only
      because it attacked him when he had sworn to stand on
      guard. He had the stubbornness that will not surrender even
      to things that are pleasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why?
    </p>
    <p>
      What would he gain? What was the ideal? Was it an ideal or
      mere sentimental foolishness?
    </p>
    <p>
      He had known men who had never troubled to resist, men who
      took their pleasures and laughed, men whom he had liked.
      Most men were made that way. Why did he stiffen up and
      fight?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not religion; he had no religion as it was
      understood by his parents. It was not raw nature: nor was
      it reason, for a reasonable carefulness made the thing
      easy. It was something inside himself, a vague pride, his
      mysticism, a feeling that he had a religion of his own,
      faith in certain intuitions, and above all what may be
      described as a sense of knightliness. If a man were not his
      own master, was he fit to be the master of anything?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have only got to go on working," he thought, "and dig in
      here. What do I want? The moon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he laughed, remembering one of Bairnsfather's
      cartoons.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That ruddy moon will be the death of me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There followed a few days of great heat which ended in a
      thunderstorm. Stretton always remembered that storm, for he
      had good cause to remember it. He had ridden down to
      Kingsbury for tobacco and a sun-hat, and as he rode out of
      the town he saw the black canopy in the north. It spread
      with surprising rapidity, sending out little wisps of
      blackness ahead of it like aerial cavalry in an advance.
      There was no thunder as yet, only a great stillness, and a
      close heat. Stretton took off his coat and laid it over the
      handlebars as he climbed the long hill out of Willowmaston,
      and here the avenue of beeches failed for once to be cool.
      The trees were a breathless heavy green with a most strange
      light beneath them. One end of the avenue was in sunshine,
      but half-way up the hill the sunshine was blotted out, and
      the arch of the sky was one great blackness. The first
      flash came as Stretton was passing Ottways, but it was far
      ahead among the high woods. He did not notice Ottways, and
      afterwards this struck him as strange.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached Romans Farm the storm was in full flare
      above the woods beyond Burnt Heath. For the moment he
      thought of taking refuge with the Viners, but he decided to
      push on, thinking that he could reach the cottage before
      the rain began, but he was less than half-way across the
      heath when he saw it coming like a grey wall. A sudden wind
      shook the furze bushes and made the birches bend and
      rustle. He saw trees almost disappear in the rain like
      figures in a smoke screen. The lightning was uncomfortably
      near, and the thunder seemed to crack the sky above him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rode for it, realizing that it was both useless and
      dangerous to take cover. And then the rain enveloped him.
      It came down with a wet roar and a suggestion of menace. He
      was wet through long before he reached the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton pushed his bicycle into the wood-shed. Everything
      green was dashed and weighed down by the rain, and the
      branches of a lilac lay across the path. He had not
      troubled to lock his door, Burnt Heath being no sponging
      ground for tramps, but he was surprised to find the door
      wide open. He remembered shutting it. The door opened
      directly into the kitchen, and as he swung his drenched
      hat, he became aware of something, a little thrill of
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went in and stood dripping on the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor man!" said the girl's voice, "you are wetter than I
      am."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sitting on his sofa with Virginia purring in her
      lap. A white hat, pulped, and with the colour running from
      its ribbon, hung on the back of one of his rush-bottomed
      chairs, and a semi-transparent green waterproof lay across
      the seat. She had taken down her hair; it was drenched and
      heavy and the colour of copper. He noticed too that her
      shoes were off, and that her feet and ankles were wet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood and stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now you are not going to scold me," she said, "for not
      getting wet through! I made a dash for your cottage."
    </p>
    <p>
      Virginia looked at him with her yellow eyes. He laughed.
      There seemed nothing for it but laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you got caught?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Somewhat. But I was a wiser virgin than you. I did take a
      rainproof with me. Why, you are soaked."
    </p>
    <p>
      She put the cat aside and stood up, giving a toss to her
      wet hair. Her face was mischievous, aglow. When she moved
      he saw that her wet stockings left their impress on the
      carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hadn't you better take those off?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what about you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She touched the sleeve of his coat, and a strange thrill
      went through him. He stiffened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you will excuse me I will go and change."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then she dropped him a curtsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please, sir, may I stay here till it is over? Virginia
      will act as chaperon."
    </p>
    <p>
      He relented. After all, what was she but a laughing girl
      caught in a storm? Had he ever resented anyone taking
      refuge in his dug-out?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please do. I'm afraid I have nothing but socks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, never mind the socks," she laughed; "I'll get over
      that difficulty."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went upstairs with a queer, burning feeling within him.
      He pulled off his wet things, towelled himself, and
      realized that the rain was still coming down. He felt
      guiltily glad of that; she would not be able to go yet. And
      then a cross-current struck across his mood of provocation.
      "You cad!" he said. He dawdled; he wasted as much time as
      he could over redressing, watching the grey rain rushing
      upon the green world. How fresh it was! He wondered what
      she was doing, whether it would not be more chivalrous of
      him to stay upstairs until she could go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he heard a clinking sound and started. He listened
      attentively while he buttoned his collar. His wrist-watch
      told him that it was half-past four. He thought he heard
      her moving about downstairs. Perhaps she was going.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took three minutes over tying his tie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he heard her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Man thing," she called, "don't you want any tea?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was conscious of terror, exultation. Very slowly he went
      to the head of the steep stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo! Miss Copredy? Did you call?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I asked you whether you wanted any tea. I do, Virgie and I
      have made it. I had an awful business finding the tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," he said helplessly, "did you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who ever would have thought of looking inside a tobacco
      tin! But I did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," he said. "I'll come down."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not in the sitting-room when he descended the
      stairs, but he saw that she had drawn the round oak table
      close to the sofa and had set out the tea-things. Stretton
      found her in the kitchen, waiting for the kettle to boil;
      she had taken off her stockings, and her naked feet showed
      white on the red bricks. She shook back her hair and
      smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We ought to be filmed, you know, doing this. Tess makes
      tea for Angel Clare!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was quite voiceless for a moment. He had a sudden and
      most damnably clear vision of her as what she was or as
      what he thought she was. Her audacity shocked him, and
      inflamed him even while it shocked. He knew that he would
      not want to marry a woman who made him feel as this woman
      made him feel. He had ceased to think her irresponsible. He
      could have taken a stick to her, or twisted a hand into her
      hair, and yet if he touched her he knew that something else
      might happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      All he said was: "Hadn't I better get you some socks?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was watching the kettle, and she turned and looked at
      him over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, please do."
    </p>
    <p>
      He blundered off, and she allowed herself a spasm of
      smothered laughter. She had shocked him, and she had
      expected him to be shocked, but there was more behind his
      tense shyness; of that she was sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is rather refreshing," she reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came down with the socks, a pair of black ones, and she
      sat down and put them on. She could not resist an ironical
      and wicked look at him from under her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now we are quite respectable."
    </p>
    <p>
      He said nothing, and since the kettle was boiling she made
      the tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had to take charge of him in his own cottage, for he
      was as rigid and inarticulate as the most awkward of
      schoolboys. She sat down on the sofa behind the table and
      made him give her a cushion. He remained standing and she
      had to look at him before he made a move to sit down, and
      she saw him take one of the straight-backed rush-bottoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      This amused her. His discomfort was piquant, and she let
      him sit on that hard chair like a Simon Stylites on his
      pillar. Rather ostentatiously she allowed herself to take
      up most of the sofa, sitting slantwise, one black-socked
      foot thrust out half mockingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sugar?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And milk, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      She handed him his cup, and she noticed that his hand
      shook, and that he did not seem able to look at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really," she said, "do you like that chair?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am quite all right, thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed her the bread and butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid I'm out of cake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One can't have cake every day. I say, isn't this really
      rather funny?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave her a fierce look and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "About as funny as the war."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, wasn't that humorous at times? And weren't you
      thankful for a pair of dry socks?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Often."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Queer things--men. So afraid of appearing self-conscious."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Copredy," he said, "I happen to be a man who has made
      rather a mess of things."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him queerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's interesting. But why be self-conscious about it? It
      ought not to prevent you being--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He gulped the last of his tea and thrust the cup at her
      almost in protest. His eyes had an appeal in them, but she
      had no pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another cup, please."
    </p>
    <p>
      She refilled his cup, while he sat and trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I told your father," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes gave him a full stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did! But what has my poor parent to do with it--with
      us? Don't be silly."
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain held for half an hour, and then the sun broke
      through upon a wet and glistening world. The cool, green
      freshness of it became part of a memory. Stretton, standing
      awkwardly by the sofa, turned away while she put on her wet
      shoes and stockings. She had coiled up her hair, and the
      fire of it glowed against the green foliage outside the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she picked up her hat and raincoat she gave him the
      intimate look of a fellow conspirator.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you won't come and have tea with me--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't," he said, half savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, very well. It seems that I have more pluck than you
      have. Say, isn't that light on the wet trees gorgeous! The
      world's a woman, you know, and she's been weeping. <i>A
      rivederci.</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched her go down the path into the sun-splashed
      wetness of the world after a storm.
    </p>
    <p>

      STRETTON DEALS WITH A WOMAN
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      For two days Stretton could not work. He loafed about the
      place, went for long rambles in the woods, or got on his
      bicycle and rode anywhere, it did not seem to matter where.
      He felt restless and irritable, unable to fix his thoughts
      on anything, and for the moment he seemed to have lost all
      interest in his garden. His sense of security had gone, his
      faith in the beneficence of the quiet world about him. He
      was conscious of a curious feeling of suspense, as though
      some catastrophe menaced him, and he had no means of
      escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greater part of the third day he spent in Kingsbury,
      riding down to the old town by a roundabout way. He sat
      through two performances at the local cinema, had dinner at
      the George, and rode home under the stars. He had locked up
      the cottage, and when he opened the door and struck a light
      he found something white lying on the floor, a note that
      had been pushed under the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      It roused in him a quite extraordinary agitation, a burst
      of anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn the woman! Why can't she let me alone!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He decided not to read the letter, and he took it into the
      kitchen to burn it; but he did not burn it, for an inward
      voice suggested cowardice. He read her note, with the
      candle set upon the kitchen table. There was a mirror on
      the shelf, and he happened to catch sight of the reflection
      of his own face in it, and its expression shocked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tore up Isobel Copredy's letter and threw the pieces in
      the grate, and, going out, walked up and down the garden
      path. Presently he came in, carried the light into the
      sitting-room, got out his writing-pad and pen and ink, and
      sat down at the oak table. He wrote a letter to his mother.
      He asked her if his sister Madge could come down for a few
      days, as he had overworked himself and needed cheering up.
      He had completed the letter and was folding it up when
      Virginia appeared, and, jumping on the sofa, looked at him
      with her yellow eyes. He saw more than Virginia on the
      sofa--a black cushion under a glowing head--and almost
      before he knew what he had done he had torn up the letter
      to his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was conscious of a feeling of exasperation. He picked up
      the cat, dropped her out of the window and closed the
      lattice. Then he went to the little outhouse where Paul the
      dog slept in an old hamper filled with straw. The dog
      welcomed him affectionately, and Stretton, taking the
      spaniel in his arms, carried him upstairs and let him sleep
      at the foot of his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day he made a determined attempt to resume the routine
      of his ordinary working day. The boy--Sam
      Rugglesworth--arrived at half-past seven with milk, eggs,
      half a pound of fresh butter, and Stretton sent a message
      by him to Romans Farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sam, will you tell Mrs. Viner that I'll come down after
      supper? If I am in the way she can turn me out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam was about the stupidest thing on earth, with a gaping
      mouth and vacant blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll coom down after supper, and if she don't want you
      she'll turn yer out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll tell 'er," said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton got to work. He lifted the rest of his early
      potatoes, hoed his turnips, and having completed his
      routine work, went on to measuring out and staking the
      sites for his new buildings. His plan was to place them
      well back among the trees so that they should not be too
      obvious and not too near the cottage, yet near enough to be
      easily got at at night or in wet weather. He intended
      fencing off a rough track from his yard to the corner of
      the grass land which he had hired from Thomas Viner. He
      would need more posts for this, and he knew that they were
      to be had in one of the plantations on the other side of
      the wood, where there were a number of half-dead larches
      and useless young oaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      He measured and staked out the sites while he smoked his
      after-dinner pipe, a lazy half-hour before more strenuous
      work, and then he locked up the cottage, called Paul, and
      shouldering his felling axe and taking his saw and
      bill-hook, he marched off to the farther end of the wood.
      There was more in this man&oelig;uvre than he would allow,
      nor did he christen it a retreat into the wilderness to
      escape from the world, the flesh and the devil. If anyone
      came to the cottage they would find it locked and no one
      about. What more could a mere man do?
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton took off his coat, laid it among the bracken and
      persuaded the spaniel to curl himself up beside it. Then he
      chose a useless larch and set to work on it, using the saw
      as much as possible so as to make less noise. He became
      absorbed in the work. He felled three trees in succession,
      and so successfully that he decided to knock off for ten
      minutes and smoke half a pipe. When he went to where his
      coat was lying he found that the dog had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The disappearance of the spaniel both hurt and annoyed him.
      The dog had sneaked off to hunt, but his flight left
      Stretton with a queer sense of desertion. "Couldest not
      thou watch one hour?" He filled and lit his pipe, and stood
      looking about him into the deeps of the wood, with its
      mystery of crowded tree trunks, its flickering lights and
      shadows. He found himself listening. Gradually a feeling of
      restlessness stole over him. It was as though he knew that
      he was alone and yet not alone, surrounded by invisible
      things, strange woodland creatures, mystery, the spirits of
      life's impulses. He was afraid. He was conscious of a
      strange excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even when he resumed work he could not shake off this
      feeling of suspense. He kept stopping to listen. Once, when
      he had thrown a tree, he thought that he heard the sound of
      laughter, some woodland voice mocking its fall. He was so
      strung up that he made a dash through the bracken in the
      direction of the fancied sound, shouting, "Hallo, who's
      there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course there was no one there, and he went back to his
      tree-felling with a mingling of disappointment, anger and
      relief. He had left his watch in his coat pocket, and he
      found that it was four o'clock, but he made up his mind
      that he would not go back to the cottage for tea. He was
      afraid of the cottage. He would go on working till dusk
      came, and he began to look about him for the next tree. He
      had chosen it, and was about to kneel down and use the saw
      when he heard a little gust of laughter, low but distinct,
      like the mocking note of some bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      He straightened, head up, nostrils quivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who's that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No one answered him. He looked about him with a kind of
      fierce tearfulness and then went on with his work. An
      obstinate rage glowed in him. He set his teeth and
      laboured, and tried to close the gates of his senses
      against everything save the work in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn her!" he kept saying to himself. "Damn her! Two can
      play at this game."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he heard that little thrill of laughter. He bent low
      and took no notice, but he was conscious of a tragic
      excitement, a traitorous curiosity. He tried to smother it.
      He tried to make himself think of all sorts of other
      things: his mother, Rollin Beal, the eyes of the dream
      woman who lived in his inner consciousness, the war, how he
      had had to lie flat under heavy shell-fire. And all the
      while he went on sawing, and when the tree fell he was
      taken by surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to jump clear, and following on the crash made by
      the falling tree he heard a voice calling him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jonathan, Jonathan, I have come to make tea for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton's face seemed to darken. He moved slowly in the
      direction of the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come and find me; come and find me."
    </p>
    <p>
      He leapt into the tall bracken and tore through it, moving
      his arms like a swimmer, and beating about through the
      flicker of light and shadow. He had no very definite idea
      of what he meant to do, though he was conscious of anger,
      and of more than anger. There was something in his head
      about putting the fear of God in her, though in the wild
      chase that followed his head mattered less and less, and
      the blood of him more and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You jade," he shouted; "get out of my wood!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed and showed herself for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Man thing--what manners!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw her white face and the gleam of her hair half hidden
      behind a tree trunk some fifty yards away. He gave chase,
      and she dived like a bird to cover. There was much fern
      here, and it was very tall, and he could see a swaying of
      the fronds as she moved through it. He was breathing deeply
      through pinched nostrils, and his eyes had a steady glare
      in them. He felt himself growing cunning. She was less than
      thirty yards from him now, but he tracked her relentlessly,
      with fierce leisureliness, watching the green tops of the
      fern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he saw all movement cease. He was quite near to
      the place where she lay hidden, and he stood still and
      waited. Presently he noticed a slight trembling of the
      patch of bracken. The coronet of her red hair appeared, and
      then her face, as though rising out of green water. Their
      eyes met. They were less than five yards from each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, Mr. Pan!" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a straight dash at her through the fern as though
      he knew that what he had to do must be done quickly. She
      rose to him, half defiant, half laughing. There was a
      little scuffle, and then Stretton had her by the hair. If
      she must challenge the brute in him, the retort should be
      unexpected.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keep still," he said in a fierce, thick voice, "or I shall
      hurt you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He made her turn about and he marched her through the
      bracken and down through the woodland towards the ride
      which led to the cottage and the heath. At first she
      struggled a little, but gave it up when she realized the
      strength and passion of his grip. He could not see her
      face; he did not wish to see it. He imagined her fury, and
      he was glad.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You beast!" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no reply. In fact, he did not utter a word until he
      had her out on the heath a good fifty yards from the
      cottage. He had astonished her, and he had astonished
      himself. He thought that he had settled it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry," he said, "but if you come up here again I'll
      thrash you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He released her. She stood back looking at him with some of
      her colour gone and her eyes blazing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, will you! You are a pretty average cad!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think so?" he retorted, holding himself in.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Idiot! I'm not a person to be threatened. Really, I think
      this is the most nave affair."
    </p>
    <p>
      He pointed down the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please oblige me by going. You are a most infernal
      nuisance."
    </p>
    <p>
      She tossed her head, gave him a queer, veiled look and
      prepared to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I rather like being a nuisance, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, do you!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned his back on her and walked to the cottage,
      trembling as he had sometimes trembled in France in moments
      of great excitement and of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That should settle it," he thought, and the thought was
      half a prayer.
    </p>

      THE GREATER PROVOCATION
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      "What children, what savages we are," he reflected as he
      held a match to the wood fire in the kitchen and put the
      kettle on to boil. He had calmed down. What was more, he
      was conscious of a deep sense of relief, of having thrown
      something from his shoulders, and he felt the lighter and
      the happier for it. Resting his forehead against the old
      oak mantelshelf he watched the flames playing through the
      brittle wood, and wondered why he had been so rough.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It had to be," he reflected, "otherwise--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sorry for his roughness, but when his thoughts went
      deeper he began to understand that his roughness had not
      hurt her, and that it had hurt him more than it had hurt
      her. He remembered that queer veiled look of hers as she
      had turned to go. She was extraordinarily hard and bold.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not know that women were like that." A moment later
      he qualified the thought. "But not all women. I suppose it
      is dull down at Ottways, and she thought she would have a
      game with me. Well, that's settled."
    </p>
    <p>
      But directly that he had assured himself that it was
      settled he began to doubt the finality of what had
      happened. He had handled her so roughly that she might bear
      malice and try some other trick. He did not believe that
      she would attempt to provoke the man in him again, but this
      was his first experience of women in the raw, and it had
      shocked him. He felt vaguely uneasy, and he went to the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the blue gap between the old thorns and yews he saw
      Romans Farm as a chequer of red and green in the afternoon
      sunlight. He remembered that he had arranged to go and have
      supper with the Viners, and he was glad. What wholesome
      people they were! He stood looking at the farm, and it had
      a soothing and cooling effect upon him; all the
      associations connected with it were good. It was a little
      centre of growth to which the hay and the corn were
      gathered in, and to which the cows came home at milking
      time. It was full of nameless, pleasant perfumes, of
      flowers growing in odd corners, of fruit trees, and of
      urgent, happy life. He had heard that farming folk were
      suspicious, narrow and mean, but he had not found the
      Viners so.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the rest he was aware that the heath was empty, as much
      of it as he could see, and he did not doubt but that my
      lady had footed it back to Ottways in a fine Georgian rage.
      The kettle was boiling, and he turned to and made the tea,
      sitting down to it in the kitchen, and not in that other
      room where Isobel Copredy had lounged upon his sofa.
      Half-way through the meal Paul arrived, an apologetic,
      dusty, plausible creature slinking in at the front door. He
      wagged a stumpy tail and looked at Stretton with eyes which
      said: "A fellow must have a bit of a lark, you know,
      sometimes." And Stretton forgave him. To suffer and to be
      tried makes a man more human, even to his dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not till after tea, when the call came for his
      tobacco pouch, that Stretton remembered that he had left
      his coat and tools in the wood, but as he had a number of
      jobs to do about the house and garden he filled a pipe from
      the tobacco tin on the shelf and left his coat to be
      salvaged later. He was busy for a couple of hours, and the
      Viners supped at eight. About seven he went for his coat
      and tools, walking up through the woodlands in the cool of
      the evening. A bank of clouds had formed in the west,
      shutting out the sun and filling the wood with a sense of
      premature dusk. There was no wind moving, and it was very
      tranquil and still, and Stretton paused for a while to
      watch a squirrel playing in a Scots fir. The oaks and
      beeches on the other side of the ride raised a dark green
      canopy, and the light was so subdued that the more distant
      trunks lost themselves in a background of soft gloom.
      Stretton did not hurry. He knew that he had time to wash
      and change and walk down to Romans Farm by eight o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the peace of the woodlands had fallen upon him, the
      tranquillity of the trees. He was not a moralist. He had
      the sensitive and clean man's instinct for things which
      were good and which were not good, and he knew that their
      goodness depended on the woman. That was why he was
      passionately prejudiced in his desire to believe in women.
      It is probable that he did not realize how near he had been
      to disaster, and how near he still was to disaster, and
      that a man's soul is a cauldron which some wild witch may
      stir up with a stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton had left his coat lying close to a clump of
      bracken. It was still there, and he picked it up and turned
      away to collect his woodman's tools, but as he turned away
      a figure rose out of the fern--the red witch with a stick.
      She had cut a hazel wand with his bill-hook, trimmed it,
      hidden herself near his coat and waited for him to come for
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lashed at him with all her strength, and the whip end
      of the hazel rod caught him along the cheek. The blow hurt;
      it left a red mark which did not fade for days; but it did
      more than that: it stung Stretton's temper. He swung round
      and faced her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Confound you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw her red lips drawn back over her teeth, her mocking,
      laughing eyes. She struck at him again, but he put up his
      coat and smothered the blow, and next moment he had hold of
      the stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let go."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a struggle for that stick. She was very strong
      and quite reckless, and she fought for it like a fierce
      young girl who knows that she has the boy at a
      disadvantage. She mocked him with insolent bravado.
      Stretton had to drop his coat and use both hands, but she
      was nearly as strong as he was, and much more confident.
      The young blood in both of them began to flame. They were
      at close quarters now, wrestling together, breathing fast
      and hard, their faces almost touching, their bodies
      straining against each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Stretton got the stick, twisting it so that she had to
      let go. He saw something more than rage come into her eyes.
      She threw her arms round his neck and pulled him down into
      the fern. He felt her strong young teeth in his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It was dark when she came out of the wood on to the stretch
      of heath below the cottage. She was weeping with rage and
      pain and the disillusionment of a balked desire; her hair
      was down; her stockings hung about her ankles. A little
      behind her walked the man, a figure of humiliation and
      self-horror; one sleeve of his shirt had been torn off, and
      there was blood on his face and the marks left by her
      fingernails.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry," he kept saying. "I'm sorry; I ought to have
      told you before."
    </p>
    <p>
      She subsided into the heather, for she was very near
      exhaustion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You tried to kill me," she said in a hoarse voice. "My
      throat; you got me by the throat."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood there with his head hanging down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ought to have told you, but I never thought. It only
      happened before with men."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Men! What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up sharply, the fingers of her right hand
      feeling her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was the war," he said. "I was shell-shocked, and after
      that--things happened sometimes."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had an impression of her shrinking from him as she lay
      half in the heather.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean--you attack people?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice was toneless and miserable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't help it. The last time they sent me to prison.
      That is why I came down here; I wanted to be alone and to
      try to heal myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not pity him. She was filled with a kind of fury at
      the thought that she had been attracted by him, for he had
      become as repellent to her as a sick animal. Moreover, his
      misery and his humiliation were so obvious and so acute
      that she felt herself his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, you are just a homicidal maniac."
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained quite motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, I am not that. Don't say that. If you had left me
      alone--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She sprang up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My God! What have I been doing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry," he said. "I'm sorry."
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood looking at him. She became aware of more light
      spreading in the darkness; it was the moon rising, and she
      could see the man's white face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I hadn't fought like a wild cat you would have killed
      me," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank God you were strong," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he asked her:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What am I to do? What do you want me to do? I must have
      hurt you most damnably."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will do anything. Do you wish me to go and give myself
      up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, and her laughter was unpleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I! Pull yourself together and don't be a fool. I'll
      hush it up."
    </p>
    <p>
      He hated her. How he hated her! He felt that she had
      destroyed everything, more than she knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what will you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say! Nothing. Unless it is necessary. I haven't looked in
      my glass yet. We women are sensitive creatures. Some beast
      of a tramp attacked me, and I beat him off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I see," he said, sinking deeper into his sea of
      helplessness and shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a movement; she was going.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me walk down with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No thank you," she said curtly, and it was the last lash
      that she gave him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton stood there in the moonlight and watched her walk
      away. He noticed that she limped slightly, and he saw her
      pause and bend down to do something to her stockings. Every
      act of hers, every movement, was a thing of horror. He was
      glad when she had disappeared, and he had nothing before
      his eyes but the moon and the moonlit landscape, the
      scattered thorns and yews black against the sky. He became
      conscious of the beauty of the night, but it was a beauty
      that stung him and filled his throat with unbearable
      emotion. Beauty, yes, a beauty which she had poisoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly he felt himself alone. And what a loneliness!
      Never before had he felt himself so alone, so cut off, so
      hopeless an outcast. Even a woman was not safe when one of
      these rages came upon him. In a flash he realized all that
      this calamitous and tragic night implied, all that it
      denied to him, all the hope and the striving it had
      nullified.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was overwhelmed. Not only was it a question of
      loneliness and of humiliation, but it seemed to him that
      the work of months had been wiped out in an hour. How happy
      he had been a week ago, three hours ago, happy in his
      confidence, in his knowledge of things well done. And now!
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered suddenly that he should have been at Romans
      Farm. He had completely forgotten it, but now he felt that
      he could not face the Viners, that he would never be able
      to face them, and that he would never believe in himself
      again. He was where he had been a year ago, only it seemed
      to him that his state was far worse, in that he had tried
      his inspired experiment and failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would it have failed but for that girl?
    </p>
    <p>
      He wandered blindly about the heath, cursing her. Almost he
      wished that he had killed her; the disaster would have been
      final, and the escape from it obvious, but now he had to go
      on living. But why should he go on living? Who wanted him
      to live?
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he returned towards the cottage, the place he
      called home. He saw the quaint and familiar outlines of the
      little house, and something seemed dead in it. He broke
      down and leant sobbing on the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mother, Mother!" was his child's cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he straightened and raised his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot tell her," was his thought; "I can't tell
      anybody. I have got to bear it alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      He grew calmer after that. It was as though his loneliness
      challenged him and he turned to face it as a man faces
      death, or something from which he cannot escape. His
      courage revived a little, even if it was the obstinate
      courage of despair. He looked full at the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Other men have had to face it," he thought, "and why not
      I? A man has to satisfy himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      He swore to himself that he would face it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, damn it, and alone!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that he heard a rustling in the hedge, and a
      dog's whimper. He was startled; he bent down; something
      rubbed against his legs and began to lick his caressing
      hand. He went down on his knees, with his head close to the
      ground, and let the dog lick his ears and wounded face, for
      this little beast's kisses soothed other and deeper wounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not alone, not quite alone," he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Ottways a shocked and excited little man was preparing
      to go down to Willowmaston, and his daughter was trying to
      pacify him. She had attempted to slip up to her room
      unnoticed and had met her father on the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my dear, the scoundrel must be caught. The police
      ought to be put on the track at once. Are you sure, quite
      sure, that you are all right?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite," she assured him. "I think the blackguard caught a
      tartar. An undersized tramp. He ran away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you describe him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was rather dark, but he had a beard and was wearing a
      battered old hat. A man of about forty. But look here, Dad,
      I would rather no fuss were made. It is not a particularly
      pleasant adventure."
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Copredy agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll say the man threatened you. Such blackguards are a
      public danger."
    </p>
    <p>
      She let him go on those terms, but no tramp or filibuster
      was ever caught by the country police, and though there was
      some gossiping among the servants, the affair melted into
      the limbo of things forgotten. A week or so later Miss
      Isobel Copredy went to stay with friends in Scotland. She
      was not seen again in Ottways for close upon two months.
    </p>

    <h1>
      JINKS'S PHILOSOPHY
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The only people who troubled to wonder why Stretton became
      a man who was almost invisible were Thomas Viner and his
      wife. He had sent them a note by the milk boy, apologizing
      for not coming down to supper and making some more or less
      plausible excuse, and there the matter might have ended had
      the Viners been less warm-hearted and less sensible folk.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Thomas Viner, too, who overheard young Rugglesworth
      telling his father that Stretton had been fighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Scratched all over it be, 'is face, just as though the cat
      had clawed 'im."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Viner did not meddle in the conversation, nor did he
      mention this piece of gossip even to his wife, but when a
      week had passed and they had not seen John Stretton, Viner
      went up one evening to the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was about a hundred yards from the place the farmer
      heard the sound of hammering. The sound came from the edge
      of the wood where Stretton was putting up his new
      outbuildings, and Viner could see him at work above the
      line of the old oak palings. He was on the roof of one of
      these buildings, nailing down the shingles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now work varies in temper, in speed, in precision of
      movement, and Viner--a great part of whose life had been
      spent in watching men work--knew the average man's rhythm,
      and whether spade, bill-hook or fork were moving as they
      should. Stretton was working as no ordinary man works.
      Viner saw that at once. Nor did Stretton's speed strike him
      as the haste of the amateur and the enthusiast, for the man
      on the roof of the shed was wielding the hammer as though
      he were fighting something. Nor were his blows too
      accurate. Old Viner saw him mishit sundry nails and bend
      them, so that they had to be wrenched out with the claw end
      of the hammer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton's back was towards him and he remained unaware of
      Tom Viner's presence until the farmer, who had come within
      a few yards of the shed, hailed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Press of work, Mr. Stretton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton turned sharply. He half lay on the roof, resting
      on his right side and propped on his right elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, it's you, Mr. Viner."
    </p>
    <p>
      His face cleared, but Tom Viner's first impression of it
      remained very vividly in his mind, for Stretton's face had
      looked drawn and sombre and fierce. A man's temper is
      judged by his eyes, the evil or the good that is in him,
      the peace of soul or the bitterness of spirit, and
      Stretton's eyes were unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you are at those sheds," said Viner; "we thought you
      must be busy with something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been working pretty hard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And late. It's seven o'clock."
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice was easy and kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you work too hard. It's bad business."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton appeared to hesitate; he remained poised on the
      white timber against the dark foliage of the trees; then he
      made a movement towards the ladder and came down. Tom Viner
      noticed sundry red lines upon his face but without
      appearing to notice them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are making quite a good job of that shed," he
      observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do. Why not knock off and come down and have some supper
      with us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw Stretton colour up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd like to, but I can't manage it to-night. I am working
      to time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I come another night, say Saturday?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      Viner pulled out his pipe. He was acutely aware of the
      other man's uneasiness, of the driven look at the back of
      Stretton's eyes, and he wondered what had caused it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are working too hard," he thought. "And why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton had picked up his coat and was feeling in a pocket
      for pouch and matches.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come and look at my crops," he said; "my tomatoes are
      ripening up well. I have been having a devil of a time with
      the weeds."
    </p>
    <p>
      His face grew vaguely irritable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charlock, you know, and docks. I often wonder where the
      devil they all come from."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said old Viner soothingly, "don't you let weeds
      worry you. It gives a man something to grumble at. Weeds
      have taught us a lot."
    </p>
    <p>
      But he went back home to Romans Farm, and over the supper
      table he talked to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That lad's not happy," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Viner did not appear surprised, but she asked her man
      what made him think that John Stretton was unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's his eyes and the way I saw him working, working too
      hard and too fast."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, he would work like that, wouldn't he?" said Mrs.
      Viner, "if he is unhappy. I know the feeling myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      She remembered how when the news of her son's death in
      France had come to her she had found refuge in work, heavy
      and continuous work which had helped to dull the pain at
      her heart. She had set herself to clean down the whole
      house, and one night her man had found her sitting on the
      stairs in tears, over-weary in body and soul. "Come to bed,
      Mother." Tom Viner remembered that too. Would he ever
      forget it?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, maybe it's that," he said. "But why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mary gave him a second helping of steak pie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Tom, if you were a young man, living all alone,
      keeping your own house, how would you like it? And not a
      soul to speak to but that boob of a boy once in the day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shouldn't like it at all," said her man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, there you are! He got along all right for six months
      when everything was new. But now--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes met across the table, kind, wise, mutually
      trustful eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, that's it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's lonely, and he's working like that to spite himself.
      He's got character, you see."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Viner saw all that, but he thought that there was
      something more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fact is," he said slowly, "he wants a partner up
      there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say wife," observed Mrs. Mary, "and have done with it. Not
      any ordinary sort of girl, either, I should say. He's fine
      bred. Well, I don't know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again their eyes met across the table. The same thought was
      in the mind of each, but neither confessed it to the other.
      Perhaps they understood each other so well that there was
      no need for it to be confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, John Stretton was far more unhappy
      than the Viners suspected. We all have our descents into
      Hades, and never is hell so deep as when we have lost hope.
      Stretton had lost hope; that was what made life so damnable
      and so difficult, an eternal driving of himself along the
      road which he had chosen. He was afraid to stop, for
      stopping meant thinking, and he was afraid to think. Work
      had become a drug, the least dangerous of drugs with which
      unhappy men dull those cries of disillusionment and of
      pain. He slaved and sweated, but without any joy in it,
      sometimes hating it, doing things savagely and with set
      teeth. He overtired himself, and that meant irritability.
      Yet he told no one; his letters never breathed a word of
      it; they were rigorously censored by some obstinate spirit
      inside himself, the thing we call pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kill or cure!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The saying had been a favourite one with one of his
      sergeants in France. "Kill or cure, boys. A 'blighty' or a
      number nine-sized halo--what!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother and Car visited him about that time, but he was
      so sensitively secretive and had such a horror of
      whimpering that he deceived them both by putting on a
      temporary cheerfulness. His mother thought him a little
      thin and drawn, and said so.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Work, mater, that's all, and plenty of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      This finely drawn look suited him. There was an air of
      maturity about him, the mysterious something which
      suffering gives, and his mother's sentimental eyes found
      him suggestive of romantic asceticism. He was like none of
      her other children. She had been unable to create a mystery
      about them, but John had always been a little mysterious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must not work too hard, dear," she said. "There must
      be so many beautiful thoughts coming to you in this sweet
      country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he agreed, "yes," and smiled above and beyond her.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Car he said very little. He showed him his new ground,
      his buildings and fences, and let these material things
      suggest that all was well.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have put in a lot of work here. I suppose I am fitter
      than I ever was in my life."
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was a little crease of pain and effort between
      his eyebrows which showed when he himself was not aware of
      it, and Car was observant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here, I am taking my holiday next month; Switzerland
      and Northern Italy. Why not join up with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks, old man, but I have too much to do here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let it rip for a month."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't," said his brother; "it may seem to you like
      looking after a few cabbages and a dozen chickens, but it
      is my job."
    </p>
    <p>
      He clung instinctively to the life in and about Mascall's
      Wood, and though there were many moments when he felt its
      futility, he blundered on with the stubborn silence of a
      peasant. There was more of the peasant in him than he knew,
      the blood that remains when all the froth of cities spills
      itself in the gutters. The gardener, the shepherd and the
      farmer cannot shrug off their responsibilities and
      surrender to silly moods of pique. They deal with life, not
      with mere machinery. They cannot go on strike against
      Nature because there is no rain or too much rain, or
      because their potatoes are blighted or the wheat has the
      rust. They may grumble but they carry on. They learn what
      the poor, crude mechanic with a little cheap information
      stuffed into his noddle takes so long to learn, even if he
      ever learns it, that life moves whether we wish it or not,
      and that we cannot stop it by touching a button or pulling
      a lever. We never get the results we dream of. Any gardener
      can tell you that. Life to us is approximate. Strike at
      Nature and she strikes back, or ignores you in such a way
      that you and your silly machine are left to rust.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is what his patch of soil taught John Stretton. It was
      not a question of his wanting to work; he had to work or
      confess himself a traitor to life and to growth. Young
      plants had to be watered, seeds sown, weeds kept under.
      Also he had to look ahead. He was at school in the fields
      and he was learning that essential and deep wisdom which
      man must learn in the sweat of his brain and his body.
    </p>
    <p>
      About that time too Rollin Beale sent him a couple of books
      which were peculiarly applicable to his case and full of
      suggestive courage. They were the lives of Henri Fabre and
      Pasteur. They fascinated Stretton. Here were these two men
      of peasant stock carrying life up hill on their shoulders,
      toiling on with stubborn and passionate enthusiasm, facing
      injustice, prejudice and ridicule, becoming great with a
      quiet and unsensational greatness. Yet what could be more
      dramatic than some of Pasteur's triumphs? Stretton sat up
      at night reading the drama of those long experiments. He
      would go out on the heath, walk about and think. Never had
      men suggested more to him than these two most lovable
      Frenchmen. Their lives had been full to the brim, full and
      overflowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was struck, thrilled by their faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not believe in God," says Fabre, "I see him."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Pasteur's death-bed! Was not the faith of such a man a
      deep intimation, part of the vast soul of life, beyond
      words, beyond refutation? They believed so deeply because
      for them life had been so deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If we tread the shallows," he thought, "surely we remain
      shallow. Plunge out into the deeps."
    </p>
    <p>
      These books suggested to him many things, things which
      concerned himself. There was the beyondness of growing
      cabbages, the secret life of a cabbage patch, of a field,
      of a wood. The trend of certain insect lives in their
      antagonism to man! The beneficent and malignant infinitely
      small! How many riddles were there for man to read! By
      patiently studying one small thing a man might be of more
      use to his fellows than whole cohorts of politicians and
      soldiers. Life was not sterile. It might seem sterile when
      your soul shrivelled and died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet this was not all. He read in these men's lives of
      something that he lacked; those other tendernesses and
      devotions, comradeship, sympathy, and his lack of these
      things saddened him. Would they ever come to him; would he
      be in a position to claim them? He doubted it. That was why
      he continued to be unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want the big thing," he thought, "and that is the
      tragedy of it, because as life is with me at present I seem
      to have no right to the big thing. Little cheap adventures
      with any sort of girl are no use to me. I want something
      which lasts."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sex, yes; but sex which had sanctity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the irony of it. I might go up to town any day and
      pick up a 'friend.' But the smell of the other men! No
      thanks! I think I should have to be a little drunk or very
      desperate for that."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was to be both, but neither was to take him
      street-walking.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he carried on. He worked very hard, but after a while he
      ceased to feel the hardness of it. His interest began to
      return, but he did not grow any happier, and there were
      times when he asked himself what claim a man had on
      happiness. And what was happiness?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the ironical part of it all was that the more he
      disciplined himself the more fierce became the occasional
      craving for vivid self-expression, and as his interest in
      the green life about him revived his own insistent self
      seemed to revive with it. He wanted to break out joyously,
      to love, laugh, and be tender, to do all those pleasant
      things which youth desires to do. It was natural, and he
      knew that it was natural. The suppressing of this
      naturalness was like strangling a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I had gone abroad with Car," he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      As though a sojourning in Swiss and Italian hotels would
      have helped him! He realized the futility of the wish and
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this craving for vivid self-expression grew stronger,
      and being unsatisfied, it left him vulnerable. Every man
      has his heel of Achilles; we cannot mock at each other
      unless we practise the usual forms of social dishonesty,
      nor did Stretton realize how vulnerable he was until the
      thing had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down in Kingsbury one August afternoon he fell in with an
      old acquaintance, a fellow officer whom he had known early
      in the war, one Hubert Jinks, who had taken to farming.
      Jinks's land lay south of Withyhurst, in the valley country
      at the foot of the chalk hills. He shepherded Stretton into
      the Mitre.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have a drink."
    </p>
    <p>
      That was his genial and unsubtle response to every question
      life asked him. If you were depressed, if you were merry,
      if you were to be married, if you had come back from
      burying your father, Jinks would be ready with his formula:
      "Have a drink." It was so easily applied, so universally
      English, so democratic. It saved internal friction, and
      prevented the uncomfortable functionings of that other and
      more mysterious spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the good nature of the man was insidious. He was
      five-and-forty, with the pink face of a genial infant, and
      blue eyes which seemed to see nothing and everything. Yet
      he had a very definite attitude towards life; he was
      bibulous; he absorbed all impressions and reduced them to
      soft pulpiness. Nothing mattered very seriously. "What!
      Feeling a bit so-so? Have a drink."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton happened to be in a very deep pit of loneliness
      when this easy creature reached down a hand and pulled him
      out. They began to gossip, as men will, about old memories
      and old friends. "Remember Devil's Dyke? That was a nice
      drain--what! Pea soup in your gum-boots all day! Those were
      times." When they left the Mitre Jinks would have it that
      Stretton should come over at once, instantly, and see his
      little mud-patch. He ran a motor-bike and side-car and the
      side-car was available. Afterwards he would drive Stretton
      back to Mascall's and return the call. "A little drink in
      my place and a little drink in yours. Sounds like musical
      comedy--what! Come along."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton remembered that he had not any whisky in the
      cottage. It seemed courteously necessary to play Echo to
      this good-natured soul, so he made a laugh of the matter
      and bought a bottle of Jinks's philosophy. It was stowed
      away in the side-car, and they set off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jinks's farm was known as "Chalkpits." It was a comfortable
      and untidy place, full of dogs and faded cushions and empty
      bottles. Here Stretton was made known to Mrs. Jinks, a very
      big, yellow-headed, good-natured woman who wore a purple
      dress and white stockings, and who had no quarrel with her
      husband's philosophy. She made Stretton very welcome, put
      him in the most comfortable chair, handed him the
      cigarette-box, and set a whisky-and-soda at his elbow
      without asking him whether he wanted it. It was a perpetual
      and unquestioned want at Chalkpits. Mrs. Jinks's great art
      was the concocting of cocktails; she was supposed to know a
      hundred variations, and the sideboard made Stretton think
      of an American bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a little quiet here," she told him, "but Mr. Jinks
      is a whole chorus."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was. And he was one of the most sociable and
      kind-hearted of men, and he had no enemy, as we put it, but
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give his last drink away, he would."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jinks sat and chuckled and perspired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And she would wheedle a donkey's head off," he retorted;
      "but I like them that way--what!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton enjoyed himself; in fact he was astonished at his
      sudden light-heartedness in this world of alcohol and never
      mind. He found himself talking and laughing a great deal,
      and accepting a second drink. Meanwhile a thin young man
      with a facetious tongue who ran a stud farm somewhere over
      the hill dropped in and added to the joy of life. He lay in
      a chair with his beautifully gaitered legs spread out, and
      drawled anecdotes and stories. He was supremely funny; Mrs.
      Jinks laughed till she wept, and kept making excursions to
      the sideboard. Jinks's blue eyes grew bluer and more
      opaque, and his face was the face of an elderly cherub.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Stretton remembered that he had to return home.
      He did not want to go, and he said so.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Things to water, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ever tried watering a vegetable marrow with old Scotch?"
      asked the breeder of horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did once. I found the thing growing in through the
      window at night and making for the water jug. Frightful
      head that plant had on it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The motor-pram was brought out; the Jinkses called it the
      "pram" because they had no children.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So long," said the lady, "drop in at any time and have a
      drink."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jinks whisked Stretton over to Burnt Heath in thirty-five
      minutes. He seemed surprised at the smallness of the place,
      and all the more so because Stretton had told him that he
      owned most of the land and the houses near.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nice little dug-out," he said in his genial way; "but you
      won't get a wife in there, my boy! Well, what about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the recognized challenge, and Stretton produced
      his bottle of whisky.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Help yourself, old man."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jinks helped them both, and generously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's luck."
    </p>
    <p>
      He bumped off over the heath about half an hour later,
      leaving John Stretton with a feeling of absurd
      light-heartedness and that bottle of whisky. Which is one's
      quarrel with these genial people, they do not discriminate;
      every man is just a jug and a bottle.

      STRETTON MEETS JESSIE VINER
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      In the "Arabian Nights" we read of the evil genius
      imprisoned in a bottle, of how he terrified and threatened
      his liberator, and of how the wise mortal persuaded him
      back into the bottle, closed it and threw the bottle back
      into the sea. In John Stretton's case the action lasted a
      little more than a week, from the time that the Jinks's
      philosophy made its first insidious advances to the evening
      when Stretton performed that symbolical act and threw
      bottle and genius into his rubbish pit.
    </p>
    <p>
      That a man should be afraid of a bottle or should fight a
      bottle seems absurd, yet the thing stood on Stretton's oak
      dresser and whispered to him, argued with him, tempted him
      until he began to pay it certain courtesies. Yet all
      through the week a sense of resistance was there, a healthy
      and insurgent pride which refused to surrender. "What is
      the harm?" said the thing on the dresser. "If you are
      feeling a little depressed, come to me just once or twice a
      day. Moderation, you know. We shall soon get to understand
      each other." It was the voice of Jinks and all that Jinks
      stood for. "Have a drink, old man. Why bother? What does
      anything matter so long as you feel warm and happy inside?"
    </p>
    <p>
      For two days Stretton did not touch the thing. On the third
      day he had one small drink, on the next day two. On the
      fourth day he stood out and refused to be persuaded. On the
      fifth day he talked with the thing three times. On the
      sixth day, being down at Kingsbury, he bought more of
      Jinks's nepenthe, and, returning home to his loneliness,
      listened so attentively to the spirit's voice that it grew
      bold and spoke the naked truth to him, and the evil face of
      it was uncovered. That night he slept hardly at all. He was
      aware of an inward and spiritual shuddering, a fastidious
      disgust, a horror of what might be. He realized that it was
      impossible for a man who was lonely and unhappy to argue
      with such an inclination. Like the proverbial woman, it
      would always have the last word, and that word would be
      sweet and alluring. In rough and ready parlance, his
      manhood gave him the order: "Bundle the baggage out of the
      house and shut the door on her." And that was what he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      By some mischievous coincidence Hubert Jinks and his wife
      drove over on that day, and Stretton, hearing the machine
      panting up over the heath, ran into the cottage and hid the
      whisky bottles. He realized that the rejection of Jinks's
      philosophy implied the rejection of Jinks and all that
      Jinks represented. Blotting paper has but one function; it
      absorbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to ask them into the cottage and, as it was about
      four o'clock, he suggested that they should stay to tea.
      Norah Jinks, in yellow, and overflowing like a golden rose,
      was playful and coy, though she was far too stout for such
      whimsies. She offered to help Stretton in the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But don't you bother about tea for us. A little drink
      won't do us any harm."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton, standing very stiffly in the doorway, explained
      that he had no whisky in the house. He was sorry, but it
      would have to be tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right-ho," said the philosopher; "but make it weak, old
      man."
    </p>
    <p>
      While Stretton was busy in the kitchen Mrs. Norah,
      exploring Stretton's sitting-room as women of certain
      mental coarseness will, opened the doors of the oak dresser
      and saw what Stretton had hidden. She lifted out one of the
      bottles, and showing it to her husband replaced it and
      reclosed the doors. Her round, red face altered its
      expression. She had discovered a liar and a mean liar, and
      meanness was not included in the Jinks's philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton was aware of a suggestive chilliness when he
      brought in the tea. They drank each one cup, and talked
      very formally about nothing in particular, and after tea
      they deserted him with awkward abruptness. He was puzzled.
      He could only conclude that they resented the absence of
      more generous liquor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's a mean sort of skunk," said the lady, as her
      man man&oelig;uvred the machine along the grass track; "I
      would not have minded so much if he hadn't lied about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jinks looked grieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps he can't afford the stuff."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all very fine, but he can afford to mop it himself.
      And he had three at our place. I've no use for that kind of
      man."
    </p>
    <p>
      For which blessing Stretton may have had cause to be
      thankful. Anyway, the coming of the Jinkses sealed his
      decision, for he took those bottles, threw them into his
      rubbish pit and smashed them with the heel end of his axe.
    </p>
    <p>
      His victory in that somewhat sinister struggle filled him
      with a sense of relief and a consciousness of new spiritual
      independence. For strengthening the heart physicians have
      ordered hill climbing, and man can discover an infinite
      number of hills to climb, but Stretton could not help
      reflecting that there are an infinite number of people who
      are ready to tug at a man's coat-tails. "Don't worry. Don't
      be one of those uncomfortable people with a jack-in-the-box
      saint inside you. Have a drink." He was not a prig, and he
      certainly was no saint. He mistrusted saintliness, but he
      did believe in being clean and wholesome.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he wandered through his woods late on that September
      afternoon he guessed that he would not see the Jinkses
      again; he had buried them and their motive force in that
      pit. He was not sorry. They had stormed his reserve by
      taking advantage of his loneliness; quite innocently, no
      doubt, but how dangerous to other people innocence can be.
      He sat down in the fern and looked at the sky beyond the
      tops of his trees. Here and there he noticed a fern frond
      which showed autumn's incipient gold, and the thought of
      autumn opened the door to winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found himself vaguely afraid of the winter. Growth would
      have ceased, the days would be short and stagnant. It would
      rain, perhaps day after day; there would be the wind in the
      trees, a perilous melancholy. And the long evenings, with
      the daylight fading at four o'clock! Five hours of darkness
      or lamplight before a man could think of going to bed! What
      was he going to do with himself on those winter evenings,
      night after night? Read and smoke and stir the fire? How
      was he to keep the moth of boredom out of the grey tissue
      of his brain?
    </p>
    <p>
      He would go down and see the Viners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, but he could not thrust himself on them night after
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then it seemed to Stretton that he might shut up his
      cottage during the winter and live at Romans Farm. The
      Viners might be willing to take him in as a paying guest;
      he would be away all day working at his new buildings and
      on his land. His loneliness leapt at the idea, for it was
      afraid of itself as a child may be afraid of the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered that he had not visited Romans Farm for
      several days, and he decided to go down and see the Viners.
      He would broach the question to them cautiously. He had
      more than a suspicion that they would agree.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, on that September evening, he wandered down over the
      heath with the black spaniel at his heels, not suspecting
      that this was to be the most vivid night of the year, and
      that he was walking through light towards the greatest of
      mysteries. The sunset was behind him. He remembered
      afterwards, as he remembered everything connected with that
      evening, the soft brilliance of the landscape, its colour,
      its almost supernatural beauty. It lived in one of its
      golden moments, even as he was to live through one of his.
      The far hills smoked. There was a smell of dew, a
      suggestion of white mist rising in the valleys; the rusty
      heather shone like bronze; the green of the woods had
      ceased to be the heavy, languid green of summer. He saw
      masses of ragwort in bloom, and scabious purpling the
      grass. The birches were tremulous with gold. He remembered,
      too, that the old thorns were red with a multitude of
      berries.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pushed upon the white gate and walked down the farm
      lane. He met no one, but heard a robin singing. The old
      house was still warmed by the sunlight, and he saw the long
      shadows streaking the orchard grass. Pausing by the
      white-slatted fence he fastened the lead to Paul's collar
      and tied the dog to the fence, as was his custom. He
      noticed an open lattice, and that one of the curtains
      moved, although there was no wind to move it. A moment
      later he was standing in the porch and pulling the chain of
      the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton had turned and was looking out across the broad
      valley towards hills which were turning purple when he
      heard footsteps crossing the stone-paved hall. He had stood
      so often in the Viners' porch waiting for Mrs. Rugglesworth
      to open the door to him that he expected her swarthy,
      broad-nosed face with its moles and its flat brown eyes,
      and to hear her silly sing-song voice say: "Won't you step
      inside, sir?" But it did not happen that way. The door
      opened and he saw a girl, and the girl was Jessie Viner.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood looking at each other in silence, each
      registering some swift and vivid impression. Then Stretton
      pulled off his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon. Is it Miss Viner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she said. "It is."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled. From their very first glimpse of him her eyes
      were friendly, and she liked him even better when she saw
      him without his hat. Life is like that, sudden yet deep,
      when two people who are fated to meet look for the first
      time into each other's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have come down to see your father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is Mr. Stretton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      One of his earliest impressions was of surprise at finding
      her so unlike the photograph which Mrs. Viner kept upon the
      mantelpiece, and he was conscious of pleasure in this
      feeling of surprise. The girl of the photograph was thin
      and immature; the girl in the doorway showed all the
      comeliness of her youth's maturity. She had dark brown
      hair. Her face was round and rather pale, but with a
      beautiful and healthy cream-like pallor. Her eyes made him
      think of black velvet. She smiled easily, but not too
      easily, for the real smile of her eyes was a very wonderful
      thing, and went out only to the few.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother and father have driven down to Kingsbury. Won't you
      come in and wait?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. They will be back for supper."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her invitation struck him as being gently impersonal. She
      was easy and natural and smooth as silk. She gave him the
      impression of soft curves, of a body and temperament
      happily rounded, without flatness and without edges. And
      yet he was conscious of feeling strangely and inexplicably
      shy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not know that you had come back to Romans Farm."
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at him over her shoulder as she led the way to
      the sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I came back yesterday. I have been with my sister, helping
      her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you are home for good?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, for good."
    </p>
    <p>
      He gathered yet another impression of her--that she was
      glad to be back in this old place, and that she found it
      neither dull nor lonely. Her voice was low and soft,
      without any of the silliness which spoils so many country
      voices. She spoke slowly, which is a pleasant and restful
      thing in a woman. But chiefly Stretton was aware of the
      difference her presence here would make to him; he began to
      realize it as he entered the familiar room and felt it
      strangely full of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took a chair by the window, while he remained standing
      on the hearthrug. He understood now why the curtain had
      moved; she had been sitting there when he had tied the dog
      to the fence. He saw a work-basket on another chair, and
      something white hidden under the half-closed lid. He
      guessed what that thing was, and the lace edge of that
      frock gave him a new presentation of her as the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Won't you smoke?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He said that he did not want to smoke, and a moment later
      she caught him in the act of looking at that photograph of
      herself that had been taken ten years ago. She felt that
      his eyes were comparing her with the past, and that the
      comparison was in favour of the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I really was like that!" And she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He coloured up. His shyness touched her, for it was
      something more than shyness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should not have known you," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt so sure of him now in her intuitive grasp of what
      he was that she opened the lid of her work-basket and
      resumed her work. She was like her mother in that she was
      not always questioning life or finding creases in the
      garment of herself and trying to straighten them out; and
      from her father she had inherited her slow and pleasant
      leisureliness of speech. She radiated tranquillity, but her
      tranquillity had depths and character.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad to be back here," she told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took old Viner's chair and talked to her while she sat
      and sewed at the window. The light began to fade and she
      bent her head nearer to her work, and while they talked he
      began to see her completely and with little spasms of
      wonder and mysterious delight. She was so much at ease that
      it was easy for him to paint himself a picture of her on
      the canvas of his mind. His most vivid impression was one
      of shapeliness, a certain gracious richness and depth in
      bosom, throat and shoulders. Her nose was short, rounded at
      the tip--a mischievous yet sensitive nose. Her mouth was
      rather long, with firm full lips closing without effort
      over strong white teeth. Her shapely and rounded head was
      set on a short, full neck, her hair gathering low over the
      nape of it and almost touching the loose collar of her
      white blouse. Her hands delighted him; they were such
      leisurely, capable hands, neither too plump nor too thin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you and father are quite old friends. I heard about you
      in mother's letters."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton wondered how much she knew. He found himself
      wishing that there was nothing for her to know. Her eyes
      met his from time to time; deep, frank eyes which looked at
      him kindly and made him glad that there were certain things
      in life which he had not done. He told her that Thomas and
      Mary Viner had been very kind to him--extraordinarily kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked across at him with one of her quick smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that sounds as though I were agreeably surprised by
      their kindness! But I have never found anybody quite so
      kind in the way that really matters. So much kindness is
      just for show."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of the business virtues!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, just that."
    </p>
    <p>
      The light was fading so fast that she had to put her work
      away, but she seemed to have no wish to light the lamp.
      They sat in the dusk and talked, and sometimes she would
      sit and listen for a moment for the sound of wheels in the
      lane; yet these silences were mere pauses in the flow of
      their words, utterly without constraint or with any
      suggestion of self-consciousness on her part.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are late," she would say. "Mother must have been
      buying a new rug!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should it be your mother? I have seen men absorbed in
      shop windows!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it is not favouritism! I know what father's shopping
      is like. He walks into the shop and says: 'I want a collar,
      size sixteen,' and takes the first they give him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't that rather lovable?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps. But he is lovable. You know, Mr. Stretton, it is
      always the woman who has to sew on the buttons."
    </p>
    <p>
      They laughed, but in that laughter and in the words which
      had provoked it he glimpsed another aspect of her, and in
      it a vein of humorous wisdom, like a blue vein seen in the
      white skin of a comely shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised a hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They heard the pony cart in the lane, and going out
      together they met Thomas and Mary Viner by the white gate.
      Viner held the reins, and the bottom of the governess cart
      was full of parcels and ironmongery, the handles of two new
      brooms protruding against the dashboard. Mrs. Viner's
      purchases had included a new zinc bath, and to save space
      she had sat with her feet in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, here you are! Mr. Stretton came down and we
      introduced ourselves to each other. I made him stay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite right," said her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Viner looked tired. She did not join in the laughter,
      and Stretton thought her unusually reserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you are cluttered up!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Help us out, Jess, will you? We are like a travelling
      tinker's van."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton turned to and gave a hand, extracting the
      galvanized bath from under Mrs. Viner's feet and carrying
      off the brooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not know that your daughter was here," he said to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Viner gave him one quick and baffling look. "No? You
      will stay and have some supper, Mr, Stretton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was more formal than usual, and even her kindness
      had taken a note of reserve, and for the moment Stretton
      was puzzled by it; but then he remembered how Jessie
      Viner's presence had changed his own attitude towards the
      life of Romans Farm, and he understood that a mother's eyes
      might look at him differently now that the house held more
      than two elderly people.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt an inward shrinking, a quick and sensitive
      withdrawal of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, but I must be getting back."
    </p>
    <p>
      She would not hear of it, and she had her reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense! Come in, Mr. Stretton. It is all cold stuff, but
      you won't mind that."
    </p>
    <p>
      He surrendered to her, but all through the meal he was
      reserved and ill at ease. He would not let himself look at
      Jessie Viner, for he had a feeling that Mary Viner's eyes
      were watching him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She knows," he thought; "it is different here now."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the meal was over he made some unconvincing excuse and
      said good night to them, almost ignoring old Viner's
      suggestion that he should stay and smoke a pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I really must get back."
    </p>
    <p>
      They let him go, and half an hour later Jess heard a dog
      whimpering outside the house. Stretton had gone off,
      completely forgetting the spaniel that he had left fastened
      to the fence. Jess brought the dog in, and he spent the
      night at Romans Farm, but no one in the house made any
      comment on Stretton's forgetfulness, though the inference
      had been obvious to them all.
    </p>

    <h1>
      NEXT DAY
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached his own gate John Stretton turned back on
      to the heath and stood looking down towards Romans Farm. He
      could see a solitary light shining among the trees, and he
      sat down in a clump of heather and watched that light as
      though he were some watcher of the heavens and had
      discovered a new star.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered why he had gone to Romans Farm, and in
      remembering it realized that his plan to take refuge there
      during the winter had become impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has changed all that," he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rested his elbows on his knees and pressed his hands
      over his eyes, yet when he shut out the very semblance of
      things visible his inward vision became more vivid and
      distracting. He felt that he was full of tremulous and
      exultant light. Why had it happened? How had it happened?
      The suddenness of it! Yet was not the very suddenness of it
      passionately convincing; and so natural that his whole
      consciousness accepted it as a man's eyes accept the light?
      Three hours ago she had been no more than a name to him,
      without glamour, without meaning. He had wandered down
      there to where the light shone and she had stepped forward
      into his life, and now nothing else seemed to matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jess," he said to himself, "Jessie Viner."
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, what was she? A country girl, pleasant, well
      grown, comely, a creature of beautiful curves, with dark
      eyes and a happy smile? No; she was more than that, and he
      knew it, realized it with passionate exultation and with
      pain. He wanted her; he feared her; he marvelled at her. No
      other woman had ever come to him like this, quietly walking
      into his life and filling it with sudden wonder, a sense of
      inexplicable tenderness and mystery. She was the woman for
      whom the soul of him had waited. She was the woman who
      would say the things which no other woman could say.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was conscious of a sense of fatality.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear God!" he thought; "and I am what I am!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He covered his eyes again; he felt a trembling, a
      breathlessness within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can I go there again? I must go there again."
    </p>
    <p>
      A drowning man's vision is said to be retrospective, but
      Stretton's vision in that moment of the great plunge into
      the deep waters of emotion looked forward as well as back.
      He saw himself as a thing that was not normal, an
      undependable creature caged off from a possible mate. He
      was obsessed by a sense of his own abnormality; it had
      grown very strong in him since that affair of Isobel
      Copredy's, and now in this moment of emotion it stood
      before him like an angel with a flaming sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Turn back!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He became aware of the conflicting cries within himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how can it matter? It is nothing to her. But to me,
      just the sight of her! Yes, you fool, and you will drink to
      forget what cannot be forgotten. No, don't use words or
      think thoughts like that. She is different; she is not to
      be thought of in that way. Why did she come back? I wish to
      God she had stayed away. No, I wish nothing of the kind. It
      is nobody's fault; it has just happened."
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered that he had to go to bed, but he had no
      appetite for sleep. He felt that he wanted to be out all
      night here in the heather which was wet with the September
      dew, and think of her and the sudden wonder of her. In
      fact, he did remain there till midnight, long after that
      solitary light among the trees had been quenched. The night
      breathed quietly and smelt sweet, and he loitered awhile in
      the garden before entering the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had left a candle on the sitting-room table, and as he
      struck a light he called the dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Paul, old man, Paul!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The lapse was suddenly remembered; he had left the dog
      fastened to Viner's fence! It was too late now to go back,
      and it was more than probable that Paul had been rescued
      and taken into the house. But what would they think of a
      man who went away and forgot his dog?
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not help breaking into a short and half-ironical
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, it is the most subtle compliment I could have paid
      her!"
    </p>
    <p>
      After that he went to bed, leaving his blind up so that he
      could see the stars. He may have spoken her name, for the
      sound of it was oracular, and presently he fell asleep and
      dreamed of nothing that mattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He woke soon after the sunrise. It was a clear September
      morning, and he returned to the sense of familiar things,
      the outline of the window, the furniture, the rose-coloured
      walls cut by the slope of the roof. The sun was painting a
      blur of gold on the wall, just above the fireplace, and
      that patch of light was there each morning to tell him
      whether the sky was clear or overcast.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay and looked at the window, conscious of the familiar
      room, and yet knowing that everything seemed different. It
      was full of another presence, an imagined presence, the
      reality of Jessie Viner. It came to him with a little spasm
      of wonder and of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left his bed and, going to the window, looked towards
      Romans Farm, and he saw it through a shimmer of sunlight
      and in the dew of a perfect morning. The landscape had an
      indescribable softness, and so wonderful was it that he
      wondered whether the magic was in the landscape or in
      himself, and yet the longer he looked the sadder grew his
      thoughts. Not only was he alone, but his loneliness was to
      be mocked by a new desire, by moments of exultation,
      yearning and fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely," he thought, "life can be hard and ironical. And
      yet, even now, there are things for which I am glad. I am
      glad that I threw that stuff away yesterday. I am glad that
      I did not fall to that other woman. And, after all, this
      may be nothing more than a midsummer madness."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went and had his cold bath, and in the midst of it,
      while he was sluicing water over his head, he found himself
      quaintly and humanly involved in self-analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder what the real I in me is like? I wonder what she
      thought of me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrung out the sponge and tossed it into the rack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't suppose she thought about me at all. Why should
      she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, at Romans Farm, the woman of his thoughts was
      sitting up in bed with her elbows on her knees, and her two
      hands laid along her cheeks. Her brown hair was tucked away
      under a little lace cap, one of those fastidious and modern
      flimsies which Mary Viner scoffed at and yet admired. It
      suited Jess, and as the mother said to herself: "Why
      shouldn't my girl wear one? She looks so pretty in it."
      Which was the soundest of arguments that a mother could
      use. The dawn was not very old, and Jess was allowing
      herself a ten minutes' reverie, with the sun setting a mark
      of gold upon her bedroom wall even as it marked John
      Stretton's. And if the thoughts of the man were reaching
      out to her, hers were a fainter echo of them with interest
      and a vague pity for their inspiration. Love had not come
      suddenly to the woman as it had come to the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the rest she felt good, and happy to be at home. She
      loved the farm, the house, this little room of hers which
      was so much her own. In a moment of enthusiasm two years
      ago she had tied a duster over her head, wrapped herself in
      an old overall and distempered the walls a soft blush pink.
      The curtains of white cretonne, flowered with tiny red
      roses, she had made herself. The carpet was a plain green
      cord, with the old boards stained round it. As for the
      furniture, she had picked it up piece by piece in
      Kingsbury, an early nineteenth-century mahogany chest of
      drawers, a mahogany wig table for a dressing-table with a
      Georgian swing-glass upon it, a mahogany washstand with
      blue and white Spode jug and basin. An eighteenth-century
      labourer's oak clothes-chest stood under the window, and a
      cushion on it improvised a window-seat. For her dresses she
      had a hanging cupboard with a green curtain, and this she
      had made for herself. The bed was Early Victorian, but she
      slept in it none the worse for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jess had no pictures in the room, but a few books, and they
      were nave books, not at all modern, and suggesting the
      romantic and the practical. She possessed a healthy
      appetite for romance, though she had grown beyond believing
      in it too easily. She had a quite Victorian passion for the
      many and various things which a woman does in the house,
      the kitchen, and the garden. It was no virtue. She happened
      to be made that way, and if she thought about it at all she
      was glad that she had been made that way. She had a right
      view of things, and a very sensitive intuition. According
      to the mystics she had lived before and often. She seemed
      to know all that the cruder, younger souls have yet to
      learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jessie's reverie was interrupted by the barking of a dog,
      Stretton's black spaniel shut up amid unfamiliar
      surroundings, and uttering a sentimental protest. She
      pushed back the clothes and slipped out of bed, took off
      her lace cap, shook her hair free, and looked at herself in
      the mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I have changed in ten years," she thought; "he
      noticed that--but he forgot his dog!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, and her reflection smiled back at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What made him so shy, not to begin with, but afterwards?
      After they came back. I don't think he looked at me again.
      Most men are not like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog continued to bark, so she put on a dressing-gown,
      slipped her feet into a pair of slippers and went
      downstairs. Paul accepted her and his release at her hands
      with affectionate enthusiasm. She took him upstairs with
      her to her room, and he lay down in a patch of sunlight and
      watched her dress and do her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, he was taken in to breakfast, and provoked a series
      of comments as he sat on the hearth-rug and wagged a stumpy
      tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, Mr. Stretton's dog!" said Thomas Viner, coming in
      from the fields with the dew on his boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife had made a similar remark, but it had been less
      exclamatory and more subtle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, doggie, you here! It's a queer world, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul attached himself to Thomas Viner and sat by his chair
      and begged. He behaved as he behaved at home, not realizing
      that he was provoking curiosity and various suggestive
      thoughts in the mind of the three people sitting round the
      breakfast table. Thomas Viner gave him two or three small
      pieces of cold bacon, looking down at him the while with
      that tolerant and out-of-door smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ought to have gone up with the milk, my lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will send Sam up with him later," said his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jess remained silent. She knew that her mother had some
      serious reason for making this suggestion. Women are quick
      to feel such things.
    </p>
    <p>
      When breakfast was over, Tom Viner lit his pipe and went
      down to the farmyard, and mother and daughter were left
      alone together. Each knew that Stretton's dog had raised a
      point of issue between them, and Jess, going for a tray,
      busied herself with clearing the breakfast table. Her
      mother had opened the cupboard where she kept her work and
      had taken out a couple of pillow slips which needed
      mending. She spread them over her knees and examined them,
      as though life held nothing more serious than the darning
      of linen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There ought to be a letter from Rachel to-day. She must be
      missing you, Jess."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jess carried out the tray, returned and closed the door.
      She went and stood by the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's good to be back. Rachel will miss me less than you
      think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said Mrs. Viner, raising her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you have a man, two children and a home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose she is happy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is why she won't miss me much, mother. It is the
      lonely people who miss us."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a short silence while Mrs. Viner selected a
      needle and thread. Paul was pretending to be asleep, but he
      kept one eye open.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Mr. Stretton did not miss his dog."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jess leant her hands on the window-sill.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So--he is lonely. There are other sorts of loneliness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so," said her mother, with the air of a woman who
      did not mean to say too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose there are reasons," she added a moment later,
      since Jess remained silent and absorbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course there were reasons. A young man did not bury
      himself in the country and live the life of a squatter
      without having some very good reason for doing it, and Jess
      was interested, but she had no intention of making her
      interest too obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was badly wounded in the war, was he not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand so," said her mother; "but I don't ask
      questions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know. In one of your letters you said something about
      him being a mystery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did I? I have forgotten it. I haven't found any mystery in
      him. I have left my scissor-case in the cupboard, dear; you
      might get it for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jess brought the case of scissors, and understanding that
      her mother had some reason for not wishing to discuss John
      Stretton with her, she dropped the subject, knowing that
      when Mrs. Mary was obstinate she would continue so just as
      long as the motive which justified her obstinacy remained.
      For Mary Viner was no fool. She knew that by making a
      mystery of a man you might make him interesting, and she
      was not quite sure that she wanted Jess to be interested in
      John Stretton. She liked the man very well, for he was
      peculiarly lovable, but after all there was a mystery,
      though what it was she did not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul was returned by Sam Rugglesworth about the middle of
      the morning. He had found Stretton at work upon his new
      buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've brought your dog," was all he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam might be stupid and completely lacking in manners, but
      he came from Romans Farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks. I'm sorry you have had the trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw Sam half a crown, and at the sight of the silver
      the lad discovered some elements of courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It wasn't no trouble, sir. Miss Jessie told me to say how
      he'd had his breakfast."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please thank Miss Viner for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will," said Sam, adding the unvoiced reflection, "If I
      were you I'd go and do it myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was Mr. Stretton deaf to the persuasiveness of so
      obvious an excuse. It cajoled him all day, while he was
      working, while he was eating, and the voice was the voice
      of his own heart. He discovered a dozen reasons why he
      should go down to Romans Farm, but he was faced by the one
      great reason why he should not go. Yet, man learned to feel
      before he learned to reason, and no amount of logic can
      stifle the most human of all desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      At six o'clock, when Stretton had finished his work for the
      day, he changed his clothes, for there is an element of
      self-discipline in the changing of clothes when they will
      not be seen by any particular person. He had decided not to
      go to Romans Farm, but he allowed himself to ramble over
      the heath. In changing his clothes he had put himself in
      the way of changing his mind, for even when a man makes a
      decision he may have prepared the alternative, and the very
      making of a decision postulates a possible change of mind.
      So it was with Stretton. His "I'll not go" became "I'll
      go."
    </p>
    <p>
      But his vacillation did not end here. He walked down
      through the cool sunlight of a September evening as far as
      the white gate at the end of the lane, and here he
      hesitated and temporized, leaning his elbows on the top
      bar. He looked along the grassy track furrowed with its
      wheel tracks and its central path kept worn by the feet of
      horses and of men. Two shaggy thorn hedges shut it in like
      two impending green waves. It seemed so absurd and easy an
      adventure to walk down that farm lane, but Stretton found
      that he could not face it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, indeed, he did open the gate, and held it open for a
      moment with a tentative, uncertain hand. Presently he
      closed it again with a guilty carefulness, as though
      someone might hear the click of the catch, and walked
      hurriedly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet someone had seen him, even Jessie Viner herself
      wandering round the farm in the freshness of the evening.
      She had been standing less than twenty yards away in the
      angle of one of the old hedges. There was a thin place here
      through which she had been able to see the gate, and
      Stretton had not discovered her, for she had remained quite
      still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both his purpose and his hesitation had been obvious to
      Jess, but his ultimate decision had left her surprised and
      wondering. Men can be shy creatures at times, and if she
      set his panic flight down to shyness, she had to account
      for his shyness. She did account for it, or rather, her
      intuition leaped to the inevitable and most natural
      interpretation of this shadow show.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he frightened of me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not egotism that prompted the suspicion, for she
      returned to the farm and said nothing of what she had seen.
      She was sensitive, which meant that her reticence respected
      the man and in respecting him drew subtly nearer.
    </p>

    <h1>
      THE ROAD FROM KINGSBURY
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Some time later Stretton's second-hand bicycle grew
      suddenly tired of life within a mile of Kingsbury town. Its
      pedals revolved, but the sprocket wheel had come adrift on
      the back axle and Stretton completed the last mile on foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man at the cycle shop to which he took the machine told
      Stretton that he could not repair the machine for two or
      three days, and suggested that he should hire a substitute.
      It was the most natural and sensible of suggestions, but it
      ran counter to one of those sudden whims which enter the
      head of a man who is out of tune with life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, don't bother; I'll walk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just as you like, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll call for the machine next week."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had shopping to do in Kingsbury, and he proposed having
      tea in the old walled garden of The Mitre, where he could
      sit under one of the lime trees on the edge of what had
      been the bowling green and watch the pigeons on the brown
      roof of The Mitre stables. These expeditions to the old
      Georgian town took him out of himself. He went back a
      hundred years. He imagined men in smocks and great teams of
      horses musical with bells. Even in The Mitre garden he
      could fancy the smooth turf pressed by the buckled shoes of
      men in wigs and coloured coats, bluff, noisy men whose
      faces were red and whose mouths were full of strange oaths.
      Their voices rang loud; they quarrelled easily and with
      sheer animal zest; yet Stretton did not mind their imagined
      quarrelling. Up on Burnt Heath life was lonely and
      difficult and introspective, and the sturdy ghosts who
      haunted The Mitre were rough, and fluent, and direct.
      Sometimes he had more sentimental visions of an arch face
      under a mob cap looking out of a window under one of the
      gables, or of someone in a flowered gown and cross-laced
      shoes walking in the shade of the lime trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bought his tobacco, a new brier pipe, a few books, two
      pairs of bootlaces, a spirit-level and a new chisel, and
      with his purchases stowed away in his brown haversack he
      walked to The Mitre.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I have some tea, please, in the garden?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he could have tea in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two ways into The Mitre garden, one by a passage
      leading past the bar, the other through a door opening
      through the wall of the coaching yard, and as Stretton
      thought that he had noticed Jinks's check riding breeches
      and canvas gaiters in the bar, he chose the way through the
      yard. A motor bicycle and side-car stood in the yard, and a
      woman was bending over the side-car, stowing away a variety
      of parcels. Her gaily voluminous figure and brazen head
      were familiar to Stretton, but it was too late for him to
      turn back.
    </p>
    <p>
      She happened to raise her head, and he put up his hand to
      his hat. The gesture was superfluous, and awkwardly so. Her
      blue eyes simply did not recognize him; never had he
      blundered against such unembarrassed and intentional
      blindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What on earth have I done?" he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the sensitive vase always suffers the more in a clash
      with the common pot. That Jinks's wife should have cut him
      was in the nature of things a matter of no consequence, and
      yet it annoyed him and rubbed the raw of his
      self-consciousness. He was growing far too self-conscious
      and he was well aware of the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some people are too sensitive to live," he reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the incident bothered him all through his tea, and
      drove away the Georgian peace of the inn garden, though had
      he troubled to visualize the Georgian life of The Mitre in
      its relation to the present, he would have seen it to be
      full of Jinkses, loud, insensitive men and their loud and
      insensitive women. The type persists, or rather, it
      reincarnates. In the old days it used strange oaths,
      guzzled, drank, built solid and often beautiful houses, had
      no false reverence for women, was good-natured,
      quarrelsome, hoggish. The Jinkses with their
      drink-philosophy, their blatant motor-bike, their stout
      insensitiveness, were Neo-Georgians. They pushed in a crowd
      and were hardly aware of being pushed. They loved a musical
      comedy with plenty of leg and innuendo. They were part of
      the great lapse, the backwash which perhaps is inevitable
      after some great national effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how have I offended the woman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Absurd though it was he could not throw the thing off, and
      he sat there bothering his sensitive head with the
      off-handedness of a fat, flavicomous woman. The right
      explanation never occurred to him. One does not credit a
      woman with poking into one's private cupboard and
      discovering imaginary stinginesses. To the finer mind the
      cult of the petty and the meanly obvious is never quite
      understandable.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for Stretton the day was to be one of confusing
      coincidences, and when he set out from Kingsbury on his
      long tramp to Burnt Heath he was not in the happiest of
      tempers. He did not want to meet people; he resented the
      idea of meeting people, and if he could have made himself
      invisible he would have used that power and used it with a
      sense of relief. He went up out of Kingsbury with long,
      restless strides, and with that stag-like poise of the head
      which had so struck Rollin Beal. He had the sun behind him,
      and as he swung along the sandy road all the pomp and the
      magnificence of a golden autumn came down to meet him, and
      it left him cold. He was in a mood which refused to respond
      to the mystic symbolism of Nature. Chemical changes in the
      pigment of the leaves! Autumnal glories! A few long
      scientific words! He was unpleasantly wide awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      He avoided Willowmaston by taking a field path which
      brought him out into the long avenue of beeches above
      Willowmaston village, and he slogged along up the hill
      under canopies of green and amber. He felt impenetrable and
      rather hot, for it was a warm and moist autumnal day. His
      eyes did not lift to the beauty of the foliage above him,
      the avenue might have been a tunnel of brass, and its
      wonderful lights glanced off his consciousness without
      effect. If it made him think of anything at all it made him
      think of Mrs. Jinks's yellow head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-way up the avenue Stretton began to be overtaken by
      the sound of a briskly trotting pony. He did not look
      round, but shortened his stride to let the driver pass him
      more quickly, and when the sound was close on his heels he
      drew to the edge of the road. A black pony, scenting stable
      and supper, was taking the long slope as though there were
      no slope at all, but when he came abreast of Stretton, a
      hand tightened on the reins and pulled him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I give you a lift?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton's eyes were on the same level as Jessie Viner's
      eyes as she sat in the governess cart. His hand went to his
      hat. He looked embarrassed, almost sulkily so.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks very much."
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not tell her that he would prefer to walk, for
      though one part of him might have chosen the hard road,
      there was another part of him that wanted to drive with
      her. The two impulses quarrelled within him, and made this
      difficult young man still more difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you sure you have room?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled aside the absurd suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Plenty. My shopping has not been very serious."
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved round to the back of the trap, and she leant over
      and turned the handle of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can save you three miles."
    </p>
    <p>
      He got in and sat down opposite her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My bicycle broke down."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was obvious to her that he had never sat in such a
      conveyance before, and that he was fiercely shy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mind sitting a little more forward. We shall
      balance better."
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved, and one of his knees touched hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry. How's that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much better."
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw that his face had flushed up, and that he looked
      annoyed with himself on account of his awkwardness. A few
      moments ago she had been watching his figure swinging along
      ahead of her, and there had been no awkwardness about him
      then, in fact she had been pleasantly aware of his long
      litheness, his hollow loins, his compact shoulders and
      well-set head. He moved well. But now he was all
      self-consciousness, or rather, he was supremely conscious
      of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Market day for you?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared past and beyond her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tobacco and a book or two. I go down about once a
      fortnight. Rather a pleasant old place, Kingsbury."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is," she agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then there was a silence, quite a lengthy and
      embarrassing silence. The pony, either because he was
      discouraged by Stretton's additional weight or because the
      silence lay heavy on him also, showed a disinclination to
      trot, and Jessie Viner did not interfere with him. The trap
      went slowly up the road under the beech trees, and Stretton
      found nothing to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was too much aware of her, painfully aware of her, of
      how she looked and of what she wore. It was probable that
      he had passed a dozen young women in the streets of
      Kingsbury and he could not have sworn to the colour of the
      skirt worn by any one of them. With Jessie Viner it was
      different. Every detail of her, her big black hat, her
      white woollen coat striped with blue at the hips and
      wrists, her dark brown skirt, her plump and pleasant hands,
      impressed themselves upon the sensitive surface of his
      consciousness. He knew the exact colour of her eyes. He was
      trying to think of something with which to compare the
      white and fragrant bloom of her skin. In the old days men
      would have called her a sonsy lass, but she was more than
      that, and Stretton felt it. He was in love with her mouth,
      her nose, her throat, her bosom and shoulders and her
      hands, but he was in love too with the sensuous, happy soul
      of her. She suggested fragrance, a wholesome firmness of
      flesh and of spirit, supreme health, humour, tenderness,
      gusts of wise laughter. She was beneficent; she had the
      happy vitality which heals. He could imagine her bathing a
      dog, or sitting very still and serious in church, or
      teasing her father, or giving a fractious pony a shrewd cut
      with the whip. There was nothing flabby about her, nothing
      which struck him as being artificial.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what to say to her he could not think. She seemed so
      very vivid and real that he could not talk to her about
      unreal things. He had no patter in her presence; and
      absorbed in the reality of her, he sat mute.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Jess, she watched the pony's ears and the road, and
      her profile was neither expectant nor slyly self-conscious.
      There was a certain delightful obviousness about the
      silence of the man who sat opposite her. His shyness was
      unusual, fiercely unusual; she was intrigued by it; it
      appealed to her. It was the sort of shyness which makes a
      man peculiarly interesting to a woman, especially when she
      is very sure that he is not a fool. She had her own
      instinctive prejudices. She disliked round-headed men with
      flat blue eyes, men with throaty voices, men who oozed with
      male complacency.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flicked the pony with the whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get up, lazybones! You seem to have depressed Jolly, Mr.
      Stretton."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes met his, and the smile in them was a challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps my weight has," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get up, Jolly! Can't you smell your hay? And how is that
      dear dog of yours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was a disgraceful lapse on my part, Miss Viner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was it?" she said. "But we all have lapses. I have known
      father start off for church without his tie. Aren't these
      beeches grand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He agreed with her as to the grandeur of the beeches.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, but you should see them in the spring," she added,
      "and the ground all blue in there with bluebells. But
      perhaps you have?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I have."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was reminded suddenly of that day when another girl had
      overtaken him in this same avenue, and his recollections of
      Isobel Copredy did not help him in his struggle to feel at
      ease with Jessie Viner. How was it possible for him to feel
      at ease with her when he was hurt and tantalized by the
      clear sky of her in which his unhappy self-consciousness
      was like a drifting cloud?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember in France--" he began, and hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited, encouragingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trees--like this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not quite. They let their beeches run very high in France.
      I remember villages all hidden in trees; you walked into
      them through avenues that were like the nave of a
      cathedral. And then--the great avenues of poplars."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lombardy poplars?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some of them. Towering up with a strip of road below and a
      strip of sky above. Immense!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught the far-away look in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In France," she said, "you had to do such a lot of things
      which you loathed doing."
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes came back from the distance to her. "How do you
      know that?" they asked her; "and what a queer remark for a
      young woman to make!" Aloud he said: "Of course, one had
      to."
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered that she had had a brother killed in France,
      and he asked her about her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He used to write to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Often. We got on well together. I think he used to tell me
      things, things which he told nobody else, about being
      afraid--you know, and the home sickness, and all that! I
      used to try to help him. It taught me a lot, Mr. Stretton."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her girlish and gracious profile and
      discovered the woman in her. He had felt that her physical
      comeliness was a soft veil covering another and more subtle
      comeliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course it helped him," he said; and then he added, "We
      needed it--at times. I had not anybody to write to me like
      that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was rather hard," she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I used to write imaginary letters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To someone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Someone who was supposed to understand, someone I had
      never met."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he blushed fiercely and sat in silence, realizing
      that they had touched each other with a touch which was not
      physical. He had seen her eyes change to him, warm to him,
      and he felt a sudden awkwardness of fear and of delight.
      There were so many things which he could not tell her, and
      yet she was the one woman to whom he longed to tell them.
      His face grew blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      She avoided looking at him too directly. She too had been
      touched by something which evoked compassion. She felt that
      he had suffered greatly, and that his difficult shyness was
      somehow the result of all that suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, one forgets," she said; "it must be hard to believe
      sometimes that all that happened."
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded and said nothing, but she had more than a
      suspicion that in his case it had left a scar.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had reached the top of the hill and the pony broke
      into a trot. The quickened movement and the more rapid
      rhythm of the little beast's hoofs seemed to bring a
      reverie to both of them, a reverie which neither of them
      desired to break. They had come unexpectedly close to each
      other, and exchanged words of unexpected significance, and
      they wished to reflect upon those words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ottways came into view, red among its autumn trees, and
      here their double reverie was broken by a coincidence which
      Stretton did not welcome. A car came out from between the
      pillars and turned across the road in front of them, a grey
      car with a young woman driving it. Jess had to check her
      pony. The two vehicles passed each other very slowly and
      the eyes of the two drivers met.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton remained motionless. She had stared straight at
      him for a moment with a hard, unflinching stare, but now
      his back was towards her and he was glad. He did not know
      that Isobel Copredy had returned; he had tried to forget
      all about her and that disastrous night in Mascall's Wood;
      he hoped that she was as ready to ignore him as he was to
      forget her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grey car disappeared down the road, and the pony
      resumed his trotting. Jessie Viner was looking straight
      ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Copredy was in France."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was she?" he said tonelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Driving an ambulance. It's queer how you know you don't
      like certain people and that they don't like you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could not imagine you liking her," he said; "a hard
      young woman like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      She observed him for a moment, and saw something which
      puzzled her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hard, yes, I should think she is. She always reminds me of
      the sort of man I hate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What sort of man?" he asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, there are quite a number of types. Are you like that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather badly so."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he lapsed into a moody and self-questioning silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      They hardly spoke again during the rest of the drive, nor
      did Jessie Viner seem embarrassed by his silence. By the
      white gate at the end of the Romans Farm lane they found
      Thomas Viner standing with a thistle-spud under his arm and
      his eyes on the horizon. He smiled when he saw John
      Stretton in the trap.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So Jess gave you a lift," he said, swinging open the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton was leaning over to open the door and get out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My bicycle broke down and I had to leave it at Kingsbury."
    </p>
    <p>
      He got out and stood there rather awkwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in and have some supper with us," said old Viner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton looked at Jess and then at the door of the cart
      which was still hanging open.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks. I must get back to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his head and his eyes met hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another night, if I may?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Saturday?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Saturday."
    </p>
    <p>
      She drove down the lane, smiling back at him for a moment.
      Old Viner was watching Stretton, and Stretton felt that he
      was being watched.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I must be moving," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right. Eight o'clock on Saturday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll be glad to come. Good night, Mr. Viner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night, lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Stretton walked away over Burnt Heath, wondering
      whether he had made a fool of himself, and why old Viner
      had called him "lad."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

      STRETTON POCKETS A REEL OF COTTON
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton worked hard during the next three days, and the
      colour and the smell of the autumn woods were very much
      with him. He was strangely conscious of the world which
      surrounded both him and her, or as his brother would have
      put it, "Burnt Heath had become sexed." In his sensitive
      way Stretton had gone back to dreams; he marvelled at the
      clear reality, and withdrawing himself a little from it,
      was able to dwell on it as on the beauty of some landscape
      which was his and yet not his. He had been very lonely, and
      the thought of her dispelled his loneliness. His love was
      at its spring, full of wonder at her and at life and at its
      own burgeoning emotions, able to stand apart in quiet
      exultation, seeing the flower but not the fruit implied
      behind the flower. He was in his first stage of wonder at
      her. He had not come to the fierce anguish of a man who
      still wonders but who yearns to possess. He was ready to
      stand and stare like a sensitive boy, without thinking of
      drawing nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      For as he had said to himself after that drive from
      Kingsbury: "Why all this clenching of hands? Can my love do
      her any harm? If it helps me to think of her in that way,
      why should I not think of her, see her? She need not know."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so for a little while he ceased to struggle. He went
      out into the green world of his fancy and let himself
      wonder. He refused to realize that the sweet pain of it
      might become a fierce anguish which could not easily be
      borne. He painted a picture and stood before it, as though
      the figure in the picture had not arms and shoulders and
      breasts of flesh and blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was carrying in his winter wood, shouldering faggots and
      logs, wading knee-deep through the wetness of the yellowing
      fern, and stacking his fuel behind the cottage. Never had
      his body felt so strong or so full of exultant health.
      Often, between his journeyings, he would walk down to the
      blue gate and look through the gap at Romans Farm, her
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is there," he would say to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would wonder what she was doing. He could picture her
      gathering the late apples in the orchard or making pastry
      in the beamed kitchen with her round forearms all white
      with flour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall see her on Saturday."
    </p>
    <p>
      Always that was the last line of the song.
    </p>
    <p>
      During one of these pauses of his at the garden gate he saw
      the unexpected figure of Isobel Copredy crossing the heath.
      She had a dog at her heels, a big wolf-hound, and they
      passed within fifty yards of the cottage, moving in and out
      among the yews and thorns. Stretton saw her face turned
      towards him. He stood quite still, watching her and her dog
      like two figures in a tapestry. They passed and
      disappeared, and he thought no more of it, though the
      evanescent presence of her left a little soreness within
      him, for she reminded him too vividly of the thing which he
      had learned to fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he attached no significance to her presence on the
      heath. They had finished with each other. Nor did he see
      anything suggestive in the figure of the dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saturday came, clear and fresh and sunny. He worked hard
      all day carrying and stacking his winter wood, and after
      tea he went up to his bedroom to change. His dream might be
      very much a dream, but it did not prevent him from being
      navely careful about his clothes; he had a bath and a
      second shave; he chose his dark blue suit with the faint
      white lines in it, a dark blue bow tie, and a blue silk
      handkerchief. He took a good deal of trouble with his hair
      and his hands, and ended by looking at himself in his
      mirror. It was not a question of mere crude male vanity. If
      his vision of her made life seem so much more wonderful,
      was he not justified in being fastidious about all life's
      details? He wanted her to like him, to find himself
      pleasant in her eyes. He had never troubled to change his
      clothes for the sake of Isobel Copredy.
    </p>
    <p>
      At six o'clock Stretton lit his lamp and sat down with a
      book, but at the end of an hour it is very doubtful whether
      he had any recollection at all of what he had been reading.
      At seven he damped down the fire, put Paul to bed, lit the
      storm-lantern he used at night, and extinguished the lamp.
      It was a fine, clear night, without any wind. He locked the
      door and started over the heath, following the faint track
      by the light of his lantern.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was conscious of a feeling of excitement, of the dark
      immensity of the night beyond the circle of light thrown by
      his lantern. He was conscious, too, of an effort to
      suppress something. It reminded him of his first parade, a
      feeling of excitement and the knowledge that it had to be
      suppressed; a sense of responsibility, an inward repeating
      of the orders he might have to give, a determination not to
      give the wrong order, not to make a fool of himself before
      the men. He remembered that he had not made a fool of
      himself. But then--Jessie Viner and a platoon of infantry!
      There was a difference!
    </p>
    <p>
      At Romans Farm they had not expected him quite so early,
      and he was met at the door by Jess. She was wearing a white
      blouse, and he saw her hair ashine in the light of the lamp
      which hung from the beam in the centre of the hall. He
      heard someone bustling up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope I am not too early?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit."
    </p>
    <p>
      She closed the door, and he extinguished his lantern and
      stood it against the wall. He had looked at her as though
      he wanted very much to look at her and yet was half afraid
      to look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father will be in in a minute. He is down in one of the
      buildings with a sick beast."
    </p>
    <p>
      She led the way into the sitting-room, and Stretton noticed
      that the table was not laid for supper and that her
      work-basket had not been cleared away. The lid was open,
      and he saw its reels and scissors and a pair of Thomas
      Viner's socks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do sit down."
    </p>
    <p>
      She knelt and stirred the fire, and he took the extreme
      edge of old Viner's chair, and pretended to warm his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother is trying on a new dress. Do you mind if I go and
      help Mrs. Rugglesworth for a minute?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please don't worry about me. I shall be all right here."
    </p>
    <p>
      She went, and he watched her go; she left the door open and
      he heard her cross to the kitchen. She was speaking to Mrs.
      Rugglesworth, and so long as he could listen to her voice
      he was content to sit quite still, but directly she ceased
      to speak his eyes began to wander round the room. He felt
      that the room had changed. It had always had a peculiar
      charm for him with its mahogany table and its round-backed
      chairs, its sofa with the round bolsters at each end, the
      Kidderminster carpet, the engravings of pictures by
      Landseer and Frith. It struck him as a room which belonged
      to a quieter and more restful age. There was nothing showy
      or ostentatious about it, and he realized that at one time
      in his life he would have called it Victorian and thought
      it ugly. He could hear the grandfather clock ticking in the
      hall, and Mrs. Viner moving about in the room above. Old
      Viner's leather slippers waited beside the fender. The
      photo of Jessie Viner at the age of sixteen stood on the
      mantelpiece beside a vase of paper spills. Stretton stood
      up and looked at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How she has changed!" he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He faced about and found his eyes fixed on her work-basket.
      It fascinated him with the spell of her. Even old Viner's
      grey socks were hallowed!
    </p>
    <p>
      "It suits her so well," he reflected; "she seems so
      contented."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he was tempted. He wanted something out of that
      work-basket, something which belonged to her. He took two
      steps across the hearthrug and stood listening, and
      glancing towards the door. He could hear noises in the
      kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next moment he perpetrated a theft, picking a reel of black
      cotton out of the basket and slipping it into his pocket,
      and returning guiltily but exultantly to the chair by the
      fire. No one had seen him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But someone had. Jessie Viner had come to the kitchen
      doorway just when his hand was poised intently over the
      basket, and from the kitchen doorway it was possible to see
      across the hall into the sitting-room. She was the witness
      of her lover's theft. She saw him slip something into his
      pocket and step quickly back towards the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes remained shadowy, thoughtful. She did not smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My basket," she reflected. "Did he know that it was mine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was pretty sure that he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half a minute later she came in to lay the table, and
      Stretton got up and helped her with the cloth. She had
      closed the lid of her work-basket and placed it on the
      "pie-crust" table by the window. A glimpse of her father's
      grey socks had persuaded her to wonder who darned
      Stretton's socks for him, if they were darned, and as they
      were spreading the tablecloth she asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who darns your socks, Mr. Stretton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      They smiled at each other across the white cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They don't get darned," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then what happens to them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When they get too bad I throw them away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what waste! Why don't you send them to your sister?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His smile broadened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should a sister darn her brother's socks?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does your sister take that view?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; and why shouldn't she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's under no obligation, of course. Some of us make
      obligations, but that's sentimental and old-fashioned.
      Woman the house-slave!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it must be dull."
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to lay the silver and the knives, and he stood
      with his back to the fire and watched her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It all depends," she said. "If you start life thinking you
      want a new thrill every other day--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't get it. But you can think of a lot of pleasant
      things even while you are darning socks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you can," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She placed the bread trencher on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had better send yours down to us; mother and I can
      mend them. Or why not to your own mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think she would like to mend them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that all you know about mothers?" her eyes asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here this debate upon socks and the significance of the
      mending of socks was interrupted by the coming of Mrs.
      Viner. She appeared full of smiles in a new dress, and she
      was kind to Stretton, partly because she had a very real
      liking for him, but partly because she was a wise woman.
      Thomas Viner and his wife had no secrets between them, and
      if they had discussed John Stretton as the potential lover
      of their daughter they had agreed that an affectionate
      neutrality was the safest attitude to adopt. They had great
      faith in Jess. She had plenty of character and no
      flabbiness, and their liking for Stretton implied an
      instinctive trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The lad's a clean lad," old Viner had said of him. "I've
      watched his eyes when he has looked at our girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      There were times when Mrs. Viner allowed herself a mellow,
      autumnal humour; she became a motherly and kindly quiz, and
      her humour had always been a very effective one in its
      persuading of young people and children. Mrs. Viner had no
      use for the modern child. "Spoilt little savages," she
      called them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you have brought your dog?" she said to her guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton smiled at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not to-night. I put him to bed before I left. He sent
      you his best respects."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he, indeed! I'm glad. Jessie, where's father? It is
      close on eight o'clock."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas Viner came in that moment, shook hands with
      Stretton, and picking up his slippers went to change his
      boots in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jenny is better," he said through the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Viner explained to Stretton that Jenny was a cow, and
      Jess, crossing to the kitchen, returned with a pile of hot
      plates, Mrs. Rugglesworth following with two vegetable
      dishes and a beef-steak pie. Thomas Viner came in and stood
      by Stretton by the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you are as hungry as I am," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, father."
    </p>
    <p>
      They gathered round the table, and Thomas Viner said grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton enjoyed that meal. His too sensitive
      self-consciousness was soothed by the pleasant homeliness
      of the room and by the simplicity and the kindliness of the
      people who sat with him at the table. He faced Jess, Jess
      with her frank face and her sensitive eyes. He saw her
      against the firelight, deep-throated, comely, with fresh
      lips and shining hair. She did not talk much; it was her
      mother who talked. Old Viner too was rather silent, but his
      silence was always a comfortable silence, like the repose
      of harvest fields on a quiet evening in summer. Stretton
      had a feeling that these people were good for him, that
      they were as warming and as wholesome as the food and the
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced often at Jess, shyly, restrainedly. Sometimes
      her eyes met his and they gave him a sense of depth and of
      mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think the only life worth living," he heard himself
      saying, "is the life of growing things. You are nearest to
      all that matters."
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw Jess nod her head. Her father had something to say
      on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any man on the land knows that you don't get something for
      nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, there you are," said his wife; "if those poor fools in
      the factories were told the truth. But, after all, it is
      the inside that matters, and most of them have got nothing
      but stomachs. What's all the socialism but appealing to a
      man's stomach? The laziest are always the greediest."
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to Stretton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I brought up my children, Mr. Stretton, to say: 'What have
      I got to do to-day?' not, 'What would I like to do to-day?'
      There is a lot of difference."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There must be," he said, glancing at Jess.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper he sat opposite Mr. Viner in one of the
      leather arm-chairs and smoked his pipe. The table was
      cleared, and the two women joined them in front of the
      fire, with a work-basket on a stool between them, and their
      bowed yet attentive heads added to Stretton's sense of
      repose. The whole group seemed so natural, and he so
      natural a part of it that he was persuaded to dream of some
      fireside of his own. His thoughts went to the cottage under
      Mascall's Wood, and suddenly the emptiness of it chilled
      him. Was it always going to be empty like that, a lonely
      place dwelt in by a man with a dog, a cat, and a pipe?
    </p>
    <p>
      He grew silent, with his eyes on the fire. His face
      betrayed an unconscious sadness, and there were two eyes in
      the room which observed his sadness and pondered it. Nor
      was he conscious of being observed. He did not realize that
      he might matter sufficiently or that his sadness might
      appeal to a girl who was strong and happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock in the hall struck ten, and he rose to go. He did
      not want to go, for he felt that some virtue would leave
      him when he passed out into the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said good-bye to Jess and her mother, and Thomas Viner
      went with him to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't want your lantern," he said; "the moon's
      shining."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night, Mr. Viner. I have enjoyed this evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night. You must come down again soon."
    </p>
    <p>
      The door had closed, and as he stood at the gate he heard
      old Viner shooting the bolts. The moon looked down at him
      over the high black roof of a barn and out of a sky that
      was a sheet of steel. The grass glimmered with dew. The
      shooting of those bolts had seemed to Stretton to be
      symbolical, and he stood by the white fence looking at the
      farmhouse with all its quiet life hidden behind the
      curtained windows. His heart uttered a cry of pain. He felt
      himself out in the night, a homeless man, and very lonely,
      and he wished himself back in the firelit room, watching a
      girl's hands at work.
    </p>
    <p>
      A passionate impulse stirred in him. He remembered noticing
      that the curtains had not been closely drawn, and he
      realized that it would be possible for him to see into the
      room. A grass path and a narrow flower border ran along the
      front of the house, and Stretton walked softly along the
      path towards the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Viner was by the fire, knocking out his pipe, and his
      wife sat tidying her work-basket. Jess was standing in the
      middle of the room in an attitude of contemplation, her
      right hand laid along her cheek. She seemed to be listening
      to something within herself, and not for any sound from the
      outer world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she turned and walked to the window and drew back
      one of the curtains. She remained very still for a moment,
      her eyes looking out into the night. Then she smiled and
      gently drew the curtains together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton, with that smile of hers in his heart, went
      blundering homewards over the heath.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

      STRETTON TRIES TO TELL
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The weather broke suddenly and the autumn storms swept over
      Burnt Heath and made wild music in Mascall's Wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      For three days it rained and blew, and the tall firs rolled
      like the masts of ships, and from the oaks and beeches the
      yellow leaves whirled in showers. The same swarthy and
      tumultuous sky raced over the hills with never a break in
      it, and there were no moments of sunlight or of wet azure
      at sunset or with the coming of the dawn. As he sat at his
      meals Stretton could see the yews on the heath tossing
      their arms in tragic protest, and the shivering thorns
      huddling and shrinking from the rain. Romans Farm was
      blotted out. His own roof had developed a leak, and he had
      had to climb up among the rafters and rescue his ceiling by
      placing a zinc bath to catch the drip.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did not stay indoors. The storm was apposite, and he
      put on his old trench coat and field boots, and talked with
      the wind and the rain, adventuring in among his sailing
      trees where the bracken lay like sea-wrack of tangled gold.
      There was a litter of dead wood everywhere, and he
      discovered more than one less stout-hearted tree lying in a
      comrade's arms with a fringe of torn roots lifting a shelf
      of soil. He cut away these trees as though he were clearing
      wreckage from the deck of the ship. He liked the sense of
      struggle, the storm note, the roar of the wind, the flick
      of the rain into his eyes and hair, for he was fighting
      other things, cutting his way to some sort of personal
      decision. He was through with his spring-time; he was a man
      with an axe in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      At night he sat by his fire and listened to the wind in the
      trees, with the dog at his feet, and the old cottage giving
      an occasional shudder. The green meadow mood had passed,
      the drifting purposeless dream, the boy's exultation in
      love for love's sake. That was all nonsense, moonlight and
      metaphysics. He was a man; he felt like a man; he yearned
      like a man. "I want her," he said; "to hold and to possess.
      She is what I lack, what I have always lacked. Man is not
      made to live alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      But how?
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not even begin to think of her as his unless he
      faced himself and his limitations, unless she knew, and
      that meant that he would have to tell her. There were times
      when he thought that it would be easy to tell her, times
      when he shrank from the thought of it with a fastidious and
      quite extraordinary fierceness. But he was not a man of
      compromises. He did not want the easy kiss, the easy
      embrace, and some disillusioning reaction afterwards. He
      wanted a mate, a mate with deep trustful eyes who would
      stand with her arm about him, looking out at the world
      bravely, and with eyes which knew and understood. He wanted
      the sense of goodness, of tender security, of comradeship,
      of an intimate and sensuous joy which has nothing to
      regret. He knew that all this was impossible unless he told
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took John Stretton a week to make his decision, and by
      that time the gales had gone, to be followed by the
      stillness of an anti-cyclone and the first autumnal frosts.
      Stretton felt himself braced by this first breath of
      winter. The sun rose all gold and set all red. There was a
      zest in the lighting of the fire, with the windows grizzled
      with frost. His early tea and his first pipe tasted good.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall tell her," he said to himself; "otherwise--it can
      be nothing but dreams. I want her, not a dream."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had begun to think that it might be easy to tell her. He
      felt valiant, and full of faith in her sympathy. If she had
      understood her brother so well that he had been able to
      write to her of his fear and his home-sickness, surely she
      would be able to understand his own tragedy. For it was a
      tragedy. But he wanted her to see him as he was, to clear
      away any unfair illusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unless she knows," he thought, "I can have no right to
      think of her as a man thinks of a woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt full of confidence on that Saturday evening when he
      lit his lantern and prepared to go down to Romans Farm,
      though his confidence was a lonely man's faith in a
      strength which had been built up in solitude. He was not
      sufficiently alive to the human stress of the adventure. He
      did not realize that her nearness might throw his imagined
      calmness into fatal confusion. Personalities interact. The
      sound of a voice may melt the iron of a man's resolve and
      leave him hesitating and afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not quite know how or where or when he would tell
      her. He hoped for some happy opportunity. He did not think
      that he would shirk the crisis if it came.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a still night and rather dark, and Stretton went
      down over the heath with his lantern swinging beside him
      and throwing shafts of light into the gorse and the
      heather. There were stars, brittle, blinking stars. He
      could hear a dog barking in the distance and the murmur of
      a train in the Kingsbury valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had reached the white gate at the end of the lane, and
      his lantern, held low, showed him no more than the four
      lower bars, when a voice came out of the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that you, Mr. Stretton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was startled, and raising his lantern saw her standing
      on the other side of the gate and resting her arms on the
      top bar. She was wearing a cloak but no hat. The shine from
      his lantern made her face look white yet shadowy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was coming to see you all. Is anything--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm worried," she said; "father and mother drove down to
      Kingsbury this afternoon, and they should have been back
      two hours ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton lowered his lantern, and her face melted into the
      darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry. They may have stayed late."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps. You know how one begins to imagine things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I do anything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I have sent Rugglesworth off on his bicycle and I came
      here to listen."
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his lantern down on the ground, and its circle of
      light ceased half-way up the gate and left their faces in
      the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I wait and see?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do," she said; "but it's rather cold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't worry about me. I should like to stay, if you will
      let me."
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that his opportunity had come, but now that it was
      here, so near to him, he was afraid, for her voice, coming
      suddenly out of the darkness, had filled him with so vivid
      a consciousness of her that the man in him was overwhelmed
      by it. There had been a note of appeal in her voice. She
      was worried. How could he begin to blurt about his own
      affairs when she was absorbed in her own anxiety?
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood there in silence for some moments, listening.
      Had she not said that she had come here to listen? And yet
      his silence seemed awkward and unsympathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Probably the pony has cast a shoe," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Probably. It is foolish to worry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is natural."
    </p>
    <p>
      A second silence followed, and he was aware of nothing but
      his nearness and the confusion of his own thoughts, nor
      could he help wondering what her thoughts were as she
      leaned upon the gate. Her face was obscure. His sensitive
      spirit, jealous of its own cloak of reserve, shrank a
      little from the unknown reticences in her. If only they
      could have met here under other circumstances!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen!" she said suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had heard nothing, but he could hear the sound of her
      breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only my fancy."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was yet another silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is good of you to wait," she said presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, not at all. There is nothing up there for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke off in the middle of the sentence, and it seemed
      to him that the shadowy eyes in her shadowy face were
      looking at him intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must be rather lonely for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a start, a very obvious start, but before he could
      think of anything to say to her a sudden light came
      wavering into view between the dark hedges of the lane. It
      was the light of a bicycle which was being ridden slowly
      and a little unsteadily up the sandy road.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rugglesworth," she said, and opened the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood back and let her go alone, for she had the warm
      heart which will not wait upon the shadowy edge of an
      emotion, but must rush to the centre of it, and Stretton
      felt that she wished to go alone. He heard her call to the
      man, and saw the light sway and remain still. The carter's
      voice came to him on the still night air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; naught but a broken trace, Miss Jessie. They stopped
      at Willowmaston, and Honeyset the saddler is putting it
      right. They'll be home in half an hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks, Bob; it was good of you to come back at once. I
      was worrying."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't ye worry no more, miss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go in and get some supper, Bob."
    </p>
    <p>
      They came back to the gate, and Rugglesworth looked a
      little curiously at the man with the lantern.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is all right, Mr. Stretton. A broken trace. They will
      be home in half an hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad," he said, and felt his opportunity standing
      beside him like a ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carter pushed the gate open and held it, but since
      neither of the other figures moved he exercised a plain
      man's discretion, and wheeling his bicycle through, let the
      gate swing back. It closed with a clash of the catch, a
      broad hint to them both that Robert Rugglesworth was a man
      of tact.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm very glad," said Stretton.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was standing quite still in the middle of the lane, and
      suddenly she moved to the gate and leaned against it with
      her spread arms resting on the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall wait here for them. I used always to wait here
      when I was small, ready to open the gate."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at the sky, at the shadowy head and shoulders of
      her, at his lantern and at the light playing upon her feet
      and her skirt. His opportunity was here, but now that he
      could seize it he hesitated with a sudden exaggeration of
      his sensitiveness, telling himself that he was little more
      than a stranger to her and that he had no claim upon her
      sympathy. And what a tale to have to tell a woman, the
      woman whom he had begun to love! Would she pity him, or
      would she be repelled, shrinking from that vague and
      irresponsible taint of violence in him? He did not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent down and picked up the lantern.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ought to be getting back," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She remained very still.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why? You will come in and have some supper with us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he said; "your people will be tired."
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to feel his hesitation, his difficult
      self-consciousness, that inward worrying of the spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They will be glad to see you. Besides, it must be so
      lonely up there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm used to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      His tone might be stubborn but it was not convincing, and
      she was growing more and more aware of some great secret
      disharmony which made it impossible for him to be what he
      wished to be. She had seen what she had seen; she was no
      child but very much the woman, and a woman with very
      sensitive intuitions. He was fighting himself, repressing
      himself, trying to hide what could not be hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one gets used to loneliness," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her contradiction was a challenge, and for one brief moment
      he was very near the edge of a confession, obeying an
      impulse which that voice of hers had provoked. A single
      word, a flash of light in the darkness, two personalities
      realizing each other in the sudden blaze of it, and the
      thing would be done, but Stretton could not bring himself
      to utter that word. He shrank from the nakedness of it. He
      felt a sort of clinging to the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I don't know," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent for a moment, as though she felt his
      hesitation and respected it. He stood there holding the
      lantern, and the light from it seemed to emit tremulous
      vibrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should be lonely."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice had a sudden quality of softness, but it affected
      him in a way that he himself would never have forecast. It
      hardened him against himself. It made him see in her an
      exaggerated purity and innocence which made all that he
      wished to tell her seem impossibly crude and ugly. How
      could he blurt out those harsh facts? "I'm not normal, not
      quite like other men. The savage in me breaks loose. I have
      been very near to murder. I have been in prison." It was
      impossible. At least, he felt it to be impossible. His very
      love for her, his sense of her sweet and pleasant
      wholesomeness made him revolt from such a self-revelation.
      He was conscious of a dull and a fatal helplessness, an
      inevitable something dragging him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well," he said, "one can get used to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was aware of the ridiculous inadequacy of his words, and
      of a fierce desire to escape. He felt foolish, ineffectual.
      And then, in the clearness of the frosty night they heard
      the clatter of hoofs upon the road, and Stretton accepted
      his reprieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, they are coming."
    </p>
    <p>
      He recovered his initiative, and he noticed that this time
      she did not ask him to stay, and he was disappointed, even
      while he recognized the unreasonableness of his
      disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expect they are tired. Will you tell them how glad I am
      that it was nothing serious?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I will tell them," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he moved away she was still leaning against the gate,
      and he wondered whether he had offended her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night, Miss Jess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night. Thank you for waiting with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I could have done more. Good night."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned towards the heath, hoping that he might hear her
      voice again, for he felt the slackness of this ending, its
      rather futile hopelessness, when he had hoped for so much,
      but she did not break the silence. He walked about twenty
      yards and hesitated, only to realize that his lantern would
      betray his hesitation. In fact she did notice that the
      light had ceased to move, and it flashed a message to her
      as she leaned against the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wanted to stay," she thought, "but something would not
      let you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton had moved on. She saw the light disappear behind a
      group of old thorn trees, and she imagined him trudging
      back over the heath to his cottage and his loneliness. He
      had refused to admit that he was lonely, even when she had
      felt every fibre of him quivering with loneliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why are you so difficult?" she thought. "There is a
      reason."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton had paused again and had turned towards the south.
      He knew that his lantern was screened from her, and he
      dallied, accusing himself of faintheartedness and of fatal
      indecision. He had had his chance and he had thrown it
      away; he was too sensitive to be convincing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned slowly towards the north, and as he did so he
      became aware of a most surprising and arrestive phenomenon.
      He was looking towards the group of trees where they tailed
      out over the heath, and in the midst of the blackness he
      saw two red dots glowing like liquid fire. He stopped,
      astonished. The two red circles were set very close
      together, and about thirty yards distant from him, so far
      as he could judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later he realized that he was looking at two eyes,
      the eyes of an animal lit up by the light of his lantern.
      He made an instinctive movement in the direction of the
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo! Who's that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost instantly he was answered by the growl of a dog, and
      of a big dog. The two red dots moved and then disappeared
      as though the beast had been jerked back by a lead, and his
      head drawn to one side so that his eyes no longer caught
      the light. Stretton heard a rustling in the heather as of
      someone stealing away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained standing there, listening, and he did not press
      the pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who the devil--?" he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      His memory prompted him. He remembered Isobel Copredy and
      her wolf-hound moving over the heath like two figures in an
      old tapestry. But surely--It seemed absurd to postulate her
      wandering up here at eight o'clock at night, and a November
      night at that! But he felt uneasy, strangely uneasy as he
      resumed his journey home.

    </p>
    <p>
      There was surprise at Romans Farm when Rugglesworth's lad
      returned with an untouched jug of milk and set it down upon
      the kitchen table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'E don't want it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not to-day, Sam?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, nor to-morrer. Mr. Stretton's gone to London."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, with a flat bag. I met 'im on the heath."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Walking?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'E was walking when I met 'im."
    </p>
    <p>
      So the news reached Mrs. Viner, no very sensational piece
      of news either, that a young man should go up to London for
      a night, a young man who was fresh to the country. Mrs.
      Viner thought very little of it, and she passed the news on
      to Jess, who thought more of it than did her mother. Mrs.
      Viner knew nothing of hesitations outside five-barred
      gates, of abstracted reels of cotton, of a forlorn face
      seen at a lamplit window. To Jess it suggested the idea of
      running away, though she had no arguments to advance in
      support of the suggestion. It was just her feeling about
      the incident, that, and no more, but she did trouble to
      intercept Sam and ask him a very natural question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is looking after Mr. Stretton's dog?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I be, till 'e comes back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all right," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she did wonder whether he would come back. Her
      intuition followed him farther than he might have imagined,
      and with sympathetic precision, for he himself had wondered
      whether he would come back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhere about noon a telegram reached Stow House, and
      Mrs. Stretton opened it.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "Expect me to dinner. Staying night.--JOHN."
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lavinia was greatly excited. Bartholomew was playing golf
      and she dispatched a message to him by the car, and then
      went to interview the cook. For no other member of the
      family would she have exercised so much forethought in the
      ordering of dinner, and Jane the cook, who was an old
      retainer, knew as much as his mother did about Mr. John's
      likes and dislikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trifle, m'am; he always did love a good trifle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But isn't it a little cold for trifle, Jane?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless you, m'am, Mr. John would have asked for trifle at
      the North Pole."
    </p>
    <p>
      So trifle it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rollin Beal was at lunch when a taxi stopped outside his
      house, and Stretton and his suitcase emerged from it. A
      moment later Stretton was appealing to the imperturbable
      Parker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't keep him five minutes. It is really rather
      important."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Beal is at lunch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can wait until he has finished."
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker was a woman and she had the prejudices of a woman,
      and most women found it hard to refuse anything to John
      Stretton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in, please. I will tell Dr. Beal."
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Beal heard who his visitor was he came out and
      brought Stretton in by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you had lunch?" was his first question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you will have it with me. Parker, can you manage
      lunch for Mr. Stretton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      With Stretton seated at his dining-table, and Parker
      dismissed to her own dinner, Beal asked his second
      question:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what's the matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very direct question, and Stretton was not
      frightened by its directness; he had come to consult the
      oracle and an oracle which did not lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Women," he said; "women and loneliness."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Beal remembered Carlyon's prophecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose and poured out a glass of white wine for Stretton,
      sensing the man's overwroughtness, and noticing the tense
      mouth and the troubled eyes. Such a man as Stretton would
      not come easily to a father confessor to speak of such
      intimate distractions and to uncover his own nakedness of
      soul. Stretton must have been feeling rather desperate,
      brittle with self-repression, strung to a very high pitch
      of emotion, to rush to him and blurt out such elemental
      truths.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me about it. Can you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have got to tell you. I want to ask you again whether I
      ought to marry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear man," said Beal, "I think that depends on the
      woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had listened to many confessions from all sorts of men
      and women, confessions which were so Freudian in their
      complexion that even an idealist might have doubted whether
      sex and the subconscious soul were not identical; but Beal
      was not a Freudian, and he saw more in Stretton than a
      lonely man obsessed by his own sex. He glanced at his
      watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can give you an hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Finish your lunch, and we will go upstairs to my den.
      Do you mind if I go and scribble a letter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please do."
    </p>
    <p>
      He left Stretton to his meal, and returning for him in ten
      minutes took him up to the library, and Parker brought them
      coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now light your pipe, man, and tell me just as much or just
      as little as you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like to tell you everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So much the better."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had put Stretton in a chair with his back to the light,
      and he drew his own chair into line with Stretton's, so
      that they sat and talked like two men looking at a
      landscape, though the landscape was Beal's cases of books.
      There are certain rooms which are intimate and soothing,
      and Stretton was soothed by this room. His
      self-consciousness lost its jumpiness; he felt himself
      surrounded by an atmosphere of understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm in love," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      A month ago the words would have sounded crude to him, but
      there is no crudity in deep and genuine emotion, nor was
      there any crudity in his confession to Rollin Beal. He told
      him of his affair with Isobel Copredy, and how its rather
      disastrous climax had thrown him into an anguish of doubt
      and discouragement, but when he began to speak of Jessie
      Viner Beal was aware of a change in his voice. It sounded
      more soft and a little awed. His eyes looked into
      mysterious distances; he spoke of her lovingly and with a
      simple and natural delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then his mood reverted to doubt and discouragement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see what it means to me, Beal. She's good, she's
      wholesome and lovable; she is the first woman who has
      lifted me right out of myself. But then comes the tragedy.
      I can't hope for anything unless I feel sure that if I
      married her--But then, of course, I don't know whether she
      would ever care. I'm not the sort of pup who takes a
      woman's 'Yes' for granted."
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes glanced anxiously at Beal's calm profile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ought I to marry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It depends on the woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If she is good for you, if she is what I call a healer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would say yes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think so."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton sat forward in his chair and stared at the carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I feel, somehow, that if she loved me, if she were my
      comrade, that I should have nothing more to fear. But then
      I am faced with the responsibility of telling her what I
      am. That's the most damnable part of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat there in tense silence, but in Beal's eyes there was
      the beginning of that wise and beneficent smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But is it damnable? Let us look a little more deeply. You
      feel, at present, that you cannot tell her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that's it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One moment, man. Now isn't this need of telling her the
      truth the real test?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will not be able to tell her until you feel convinced
      within yourself that you can tell her."
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at Stretton, and he saw a new light in
      Stretton's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on, Beal, go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you grasp the significance of that? It will mean
      that if you can tell her everything, she is the woman to
      whom a man can tell anything, because she understands, it
      will mean that she is the woman. Do you grasp my meaning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton rested his head in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By God, I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent awhile as though absorbing the suggestiveness
      of Beal's words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I see," he said presently; "there is a sort of
      ripeness in one's choice, a ripeness that has to be waited
      for. That is what you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do. Never pluck raw fruit. Wait for it to ripen, and if
      it ripens--well, you will find it good."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton raised his head and his face had regained a shine
      of tranquillity. He rose and went and stood by the window
      and looked down into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I ought to wait till my chance ripens, till my
      confession falls off the bough. Is that fair to her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is the unfairness? She will ripen it--if she wishes
      it to ripen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear man, yes. Hasn't love intuition? If she is going
      to care--the time will come--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes, but won't it shock her, won't it make her
      afraid? Won't she think me a treacherous devil to have kept
      all this back?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stretton," said Beal, rising and walking to the window,
      "someone once said that perfect love casts out all fear. It
      is true. And it is the only love worth having."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton turned quickly and laid his hands on Beal's
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You great friend," he said, "you healer."
    </p>
    <p>
      So it came about that Stretton carried to Stow House an
      impression of happiness and dignity. His mother thought
      that she had never seen him looking so well, or so
      interesting, for always she had believed him to be the most
      interesting of her children. Life had not changed at Stow
      House. Bartholomew bustled in, sly and triumphant, to
      produce the perennial golf ball won from old Lambrick or
      some other codger at the club. Madge, robust and red, and
      fresh from a hockey match, took hardly more notice of her
      brother than if they had met at lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, John, how's life?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, much as usual"--which it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not resent Stow House and its obviousness, for he
      was mellower, and he no longer belonged to it. It had no
      voice in his destiny, and he was ready to appreciate its
      comfort and its kindliness just as a man can appreciate a
      parent who has ceased to be parental. Bartholomew and his
      mother found him cheerful and confident, and they did not
      detect the more sombre reticence behind his cheerfulness.
      He looked strong and brown and well, with clear eyes and
      firm lips. He was more mature, and his mother felt this
      maturity. The instinctive pride was able to seat itself in
      her eyes and beam over him. "John is a strong character."
      Like all women she asked to be shown strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night he slept in his own little room, and as he lay
      awake in that half-hour of pleasant dreaming before falling
      asleep, he felt that an infinite number of things had
      happened in one day. He had lived through a phase, a
      crisis. He was ready to go back again, eager to go back,
      and lie under the thatched roof where the wind moved in the
      tall trees. His sense of loneliness had passed. He had
      listened to human words, to a wisdom which he knew to be
      greater than his own. He had been given a deep draught of
      sympathy. He saw in Jess the wonder of something which
      might yet be born, something for which he was ready to wait
      with a greater and more manly patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfect love casteth out fear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Was such wisdom obsolete? Had the machine reduced all
      beauty to mere pulp?
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell asleep, reconvinced that what a man thought and
      felt and strove did matter. It mattered supremely, for it
      was the breath of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother drove up to town with him next day, and in the
      car she asked him a question:
    </p>
    <p>
      "John, dear, don't you find it very lonely?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A year ago he would have resented such a question, but he
      did not resent it now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sometimes."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was aware of his faint smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I may get married some day. You won't grudge me that,
      mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear," she said and blushed rather guiltily, "I want
      you to be happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was wondering whether he had seen the woman whom he
      wished to marry, but he did not tell her about Jessie
      Viner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, it may never happen," he said. "I'm not the
      sort of man whom the ordinary woman would want to marry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You deserve more than an ordinary woman," said his mother
      with admirable and motherly conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was raining when Stretton reached Kingsbury late on a
      November afternoon, but he was not depressed by the rain.
      He hired a car to drive him up to Burnt Heath, and he
      enjoyed every moment of that drive, for even this short
      absence had made him realize that this wild country had
      become the background of his life. It was necessary to him,
      necessary in its breadth and permanence, even though it
      might have its season of sadness. The sadness of woods and
      fields is not the sadness of a city, for it is never
      without hope, the promise of new growth or of a changing
      sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      In passing Ottways he looked steadily at the red house
      beyond the yellowing lime trees and the sombre cedars. He
      thought that he had finished with Ottways and all that it
      represented. Rollin Beal had confirmed him in his idealism,
      and the idealist and the climber have their moments of
      innocence and of abstraction when they are apt to forget or
      to ignore the perversities and the petulances of human
      nature. Some motives may seem incomprehensible and
      incredibly inadequate to a man who has his head among the
      stars. They may lie in his path, and he will stumble
      blindly upon them, even as John Stretton was to stumble
      over the malicious perversities of sex in a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the lane he stood up for a moment to get a glimpse of
      Romans Farm. He was like a boy nearing home, the boy who
      was also a lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop at the white gate," he said to the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not realize that his face was flushed and his eyes
      bright with an uncommon brightness. He had forgotten the
      rain. He was in a little world of romance and mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      He climbed out and paid the man, tipping him generously.
      His suitcase lay on the wet grass, and as the car
      disappeared down the lane he stood and looked at the white
      gate as though in the whole world there had never been such
      a gate!
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a good excuse," he thought; "I can fetch my own
      milk for tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one of the happiest excuses he could have invented,
      for as he came down to the farm he met Jess crossing the
      piece of grass between the house and the farm buildings.
      She was wearing an old white mackintosh of her father's,
      and her hair was wet with the rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I have some milk and a few eggs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been collecting eggs and was carrying a basket that
      was half full of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. So you have not run away from us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he said, looking at her. "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes did not avoid his. She was glad to see him, and
      she let him feel that she was glad to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not come in and have tea with us? You will find no
      fire lit up there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a movement towards the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. Father has just come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed her, thinking how beautiful her hair was all
      wet with the rain.
    </p>
    <p>

      ISOBEL'S DROP OF POISON
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      At Ottways Colonel Copredy was being made to wonder why a
      young woman should have so pestilent a temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      If seemed to him unreasonable and unnecessary, yet his
      daughter's temper drove him to London for a fortnight,
      where he put up at his club, and meeting an old friend, one
      of those abrupt and volcanic persons whose answer to
      everything is an eruption of the "Shoot the lot" order, old
      Copredy spoke of his troubles. He said that he did not
      understand his daughter. He lay back in his club chair and
      enumerated the various advantages with which Isobel had
      been favoured. She had a good home, looks, three hundred a
      year of her own, a car, clothes. She went away when she
      pleased and returned when she pleased. She had imported a
      gratuitously large dog into the house, and he, her father,
      had had nothing to say when the dog had been allowed to
      play king of the castle on every sofa in the house. Leaning
      forward in the brown leather chair he swayed to and fro as
      he talked, like a cuckoo bobbing in the open door of a
      cuckoo clock. "She makes the house unbearable, quite
      unbearable! I don't know what to do with her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Digby Praed, who shot everybody and damned
      everything, had a very obvious solution of the difficulty,
      a solution not of the head but of the liver. His
      cerebration was a question of getting rid of things. It is
      so much easier to bayonet a problem than to solve it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Copredy, get her married."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a large man who had been sandy-headed in his day, a
      man who had lived well and who had spent his life in giving
      orders. Life was merely a question of a loud voice and a
      certain amount of stupid self-assurance. If you issued an
      order and nothing happened, you raised your voice until
      something did happen. "Waiter, a whisky-and-soda." "Waiter,
      a husband for Miss Copredy." It was much the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      But poor little Copredy was bewildered. The extreme
      discomfort of the autumn storms at Ottways had upset his
      digestion. He had taken bicarbonate of soda at night, but
      then, you know, if a man could not eat his breakfast in
      comfort, but had to gobble it, his interior was apt to
      suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why get up for breakfast?" said his friend; "breakfast is
      a beastly meal. I never see a soul before eleven. Get the
      girl married."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I could. The trouble is, Praed, I believe she
      frightens the men."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense. No women ever frighten me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Digby Praed had shot tigers, which was a comparatively easy
      sport, far less subtle than satisfying or explaining the
      soul of a young tigress whose cub was her own vanity. It is
      possible that old Copredy's daughter had had some
      disappointment in Scotland; at any rate, she came back to
      Ottways and turned the house into a jungle. The cook and
      the housemaid fled and were replaced with difficulty. The
      gardener and the groom would have fled if they had not had
      families and a certain prospect of a winter's unemployment.
      Even my lady's car suffered. She bullied it as she might
      have bullied a horse. It eluded her for a while by refusing
      to function, and it was towed into a Kingsbury garage with
      one big end adrift in a cracked crank-case. Someone in the
      garage remarked that "Miss Copredy was hot stuff." The
      mechanic who was doctoring the car made it plain that he
      preferred more oil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the round of quarrels that she had indulged in no one
      knew, but these quarrels might have been inferred from the
      disappearance of certain photographs from her sitting-room
      at Ottways. Also she had received letters, angry letters
      from two other women, and the letters of angry women are
      not pleasant to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God pity the unfortunate man who marries you. I am glad
      that Leonard recovered his reason and saw you just as you
      are before it was too late. You selfish beast--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isobel," wrote another more calmly, "I think I made it
      clear to you that I cannot have you in my house again. I am
      sorry, but I am quite sure that you understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence these tantrums and disharmonies which put poor old
      Copredy to flight. Isobel, tossed like a piece of hot metal
      into the autumn dampness of an English countryside, sent up
      a sound of hissing and of steam until her incandescence was
      subdued by her surroundings. Ottways bored her exceedingly.
      She had drained it of adventure, and yet not quite. She was
      one of those disastrous young women who cannot keep their
      hands off other people's adventures, or allow another woman
      to have a lover without attempting to filch him from her.
      She might not want the man, but it piqued her to despoil
      the other woman. She was full of vicious mischief, of
      sardonic energy; and she could hate, for hatred is one of
      those elemental passions which are bred out of gentler
      people as the world grows older and more kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until the coming of John Stretton Jessie Viner and Isobel
      Copredy had been hardly aware of each other's existence. It
      happened that on the day when Isobel's car broke down on
      the road from Kingsbury and Willowmaston Stretton came by
      from Kingsbury on one of Tom Viner's wagons. The autumn
      gales had passed, and the wet splendour of the Willowmaston
      beech woods shone in the autumn sunlight. Stretton had
      hired Viner's wagon and his carter to fetch one of his new
      section buildings from Kingsbury station. The wagoner was
      walking beside his horses, while Stretton lay up aloft on a
      platform of white timber. He could see over the hedges
      where the wild maple was turning scarlet. Green fields fell
      away to the Weybourne valley, and here rows of poplars and
      willows made a mist of flickering gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the blue wagon came upon Isobel Copredy's car it was
      standing diagonally across the road with one front wheel
      caught in one of the grass gulleys which drained into the
      ditch. She was trying to extricate it by pushing against
      the dumb-irons, but though she could move the car she was
      not strong enough to force the front wheels up the steep
      camber of the road. She was hot and angry. A strand of red
      hair lay along one cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wagoner stopped his team. As a matter of fact, there
      was hardly room for him to pass. "Had an accident, miss?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I do this for pleasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then her eyes lifted and she saw John Stretton up above
      on his platform of timber.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came down at once. He was happy with the happiness that
      had grown out of his new faith in the ultimate
      wholesomeness of the life which he was living. He had taken
      Rollin Beal's advice and had found it good. He was going
      twice a week to Romans Farm to spend a full evening there,
      and he had come to feel the growth of his friendship with
      the Viners, especially with Jess. In love he had become a
      Quietist. He wanted to love himself into her life and her
      into his, to make sure of the understanding which matters
      most in the comradeship of a man and a woman. If he could
      convince her that his idea of life was sound and that he
      could live to it, then surely his love would be on the
      surest foundations. In this spirit he had resumed his
      loving of Jess, quietly, without restlessness, and with a
      smile in his eyes, and somehow he had come to feel that
      they were on more intimate terms with each other. He could
      talk to her now without self-consciousness, and he was
      discovering a new world in talking to her. He was
      astonished to find how much she knew. He had come by a
      number of new plans, and he found himself talking to her
      about them. He had been reading about home-grown tobacco,
      sugar beet and bee farms. He wanted to experiment. Jess
      knew not a little about bees, for she was a bee-mistress of
      no mean experience. At Romans they kept half a dozen hives
      in the orchard. She explained to John the contriving of the
      two harvests, first the gathering of the apple and May
      nectar, and later the juices of the heather. He brought his
      book on bees down to the farm and they conned it together
      with their heads very close. Old Viner and his wife looked
      across at each other with eyes of understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jess can teach you more than any book."
    </p>
    <p>
      Which was true, and not merely in the matter of bees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence this new happiness of his, and his sense of growing
      security. And it was this happiness which looked from his
      eyes at Isabel Copredy. He was quite unafraid of her. It
      was as though he had forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anything wrong?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was aware of a growing pool of oil in the road under the
      car.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something's broken," she said, looking at him with a hard
      and interested stare, "and broken pretty badly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll want help?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that's coming. I asked a lad on a motorbike who was
      going to Kingsbury to get Jollond to send out a car with a
      tow rope. Meanwhile--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can get her to the side of the road."
    </p>
    <p>
      He put the wagoner on to the back springs, and getting hold
      of the spokes of the off front wheel, he soon had the car
      straightened out at the side of the road. She stood and
      watched. She was aware of him as capable and strong and
      comely, and quite absorbed in the work of the moment. She
      might have been a man. He was not playing up to the woman
      in her; she realized that, and it annoyed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also his air of happiness annoyed her. She felt that he had
      some reason to be pleased with life and with his handling
      of life. She guessed why.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can we do anything else--leave a message?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He faced her frankly. When a man is happy and contented he
      bears no grudges and suspects no malice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, perhaps."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled. The game had opened. She was going to take him
      at his word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We may want some help here. Jollond may be here any
      minute. Could you stay?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a little surprised, but she was in difficulties, and
      his frankness was penetrated with a feeling that he was
      still her debtor for the thing which had happened that
      night. He was wholly innocent in his good will. He thought,
      if he thought about it at all, that all that was dead and
      done with.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to the wagoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had better get on, Jervis. I'll follow you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't unload this single-handed, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right. Wait till I come."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile she had raised the bonnet flap and was looking at
      the engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know anything about cars?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      She bent an intense and lustrous head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't that oil leaking out there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "From the crank-case, under the magneto."
    </p>
    <p>
      His head joined hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. There's something dripping."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oil," she said, and reached in under the casing, to
      withdraw a hand blackened at the finger-tips, with a little
      pool of oil in its palm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn," she said; "it is worse than I thought."
    </p>
    <p>
      The tool locker provided her with a clean rag, half a leg
      from a pair of discarded pyjamas belonging to her father,
      and she stood wiping her hands on this piece of blue and
      white flannel. She did not look at Stretton, but she had
      him in the corner of her eye. He was with her, and yet not
      with her. He was fingering a pipe and staring down the road
      in the direction of Kingsbury. She understood at once that
      he wanted to follow the wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll keep him here," she thought, "as long as I jolly well
      can."
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not to be for long. A couple of men swung up in
      an American touring-car and took control of the situation.
      One of them was Jollond himself, a self-assured and
      loquacious person with a square jaw and a hard blue eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear a noise, did you, Miss Copredy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No small noise, like a big piece of metal banging about in
      the engine. I'm afraid the casing is cracked."
    </p>
    <p>
      The mechanic was investigating. He turned his face sideways
      towards them with a smeary smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's cracked all right. Loose connecting rod, I guess."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jollond got out the tow rope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall we drive you home, miss, first? The car will have to
      come with us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, thanks," she said. "I'll walk."
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably she was moved by a complex of many motives, sheer
      mischief, the desire of the huntress for something to hunt,
      malice, curiosity, an elemental liking for the man as a
      man. They set off together up the Willowmaston road,
      Stretton intent on overtaking the wagon, she persuaded that
      it would be amusing to take that look of absurd happiness
      out of his eyes. A game may begin as a game and end in play
      that is all too serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still farming?" she asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked in the middle of the road and her eyes were on
      the same level as his. They were alone now, without that
      derelict car to act as a mechanical companion, and Stretton
      became acutely conscious of their loneliness. It was as
      though she meant him to feel it, and that she was making a
      wilful effort to embarrass him, to recall the adventure of
      three months ago. Whenever he looked at her her eyes held
      his. It was like the grasp of a hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was one of my new buildings going up," he told her,
      with his thoughts following the wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I had been you," she said, "I should have turned us out
      and taken Ottways."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The lease has a year to run."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well, next year. The pater has gone to London; I think
      he is rather fed up with the place. Turn us out."
    </p>
    <p>
      He managed to laugh, but he had the feeling that she was
      playing a game of blind man's buff with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That wouldn't be very chivalrous."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the very word she wanted and she pounced on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, chivalry! Is there such a thing? Surely not!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think there is."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a queer little high-pitched laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I have not struck it yet, but you say you have. I'm
      waiting."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were passing through a grove of elms whose leaves were
      beginning tofall in yellow flakes. The trees threw a gloom
      on the road, and Stretton had a sense of inward clouding.
      He felt that this young woman was exerting some vague yet
      menacing pressure upon him. He wanted to get away from her,
      and at the end of the avenue he fancied he saw the blue
      tail-board and red wheels of the wagon under its capping of
      white wood. Instinctively and perhaps without realizing it,
      he quickened his pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, there's your wagon," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was raillery in her voice. He tried to ignore it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The man can't unload it single-handed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. It is a two-handed job. Exactly. I have always found
      men rather good at unloading wagons, throwing chivalry
      overboard, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      His blank face showed that he did not understand her. They
      were within a furlong of Willowmaston village, and she
      slackened her pace and compelled him to hold back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't hurry. You will be able to catch your beloved wagon
      somewhere between here and the cottage. I'm rather curious
      about certain things."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with the same blank face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What things?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She repeated that little high-pitched laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't you guess, Mr. Galahad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I can't," he said, with the sudden doggedness of a man
      who is both puzzled and frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      They covered the next fifty yards in silence, and were
      close upon the red walls of Willowmaston before she gave
      him her stroke of the knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been expecting you to come and see me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was aware of a sudden tenseness in his figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean--to apologize--for that--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you did apologize," she said, "and then I went
      away. Wasn't that rather dignified of me? But when I came
      back--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned on her suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here, what the devil do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," she said. "Please don't get excited. When are
      you coming to see me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see the necessity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think it over," she retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was alarmed, a little bewildered, for she was suggesting
      with a certain sinister audacity that she meant far more
      than she had said. What was she hinting at? He felt a
      sudden chilliness in the pith of his spine, a quite violent
      desire to escape from her. She frightened him. He was not
      sufficiently brutal to deal with this sort of woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't understand you," he said, his stag's eyes
      searching for some possible escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really? I should have thought--"
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, on the other side of Willowmaston green where the
      pollarded limes met the church wall, he saw the familiar
      governess-cart standing outside Mr. Honeyset, the
      saddler's. A boy was holding the pony. Stretton had a
      conviction that Jessie Viner was in Mr. Honeyset's shop
      with its Georgian bow window full of leather work, brushes,
      curry combs, whips, belts and tins of metal polish. He was
      ready to run to her like a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me. There is somebody over there I want to see."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not look at Isobel Copredy. He broke away with
      awkward brusqueness, diverging across the green, and
      walking with a speed that sought to put a space between him
      and any possible resumption of their argument. And she let
      him go. She had emptied her little phial of poison into his
      happiness, and she suspected that the effect would be
      cumulative. He was the sort of man who would worry himself
      to death over ambiguities that suggested everything and
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked on, but at the upper end of the green she looked
      back. A girl was coming out of Mr. Honeyset's shop. It was
      Jessie Viner.

      MALICE
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      To a man come occasions when the woman he loves becomes
      more vividly alive and appealing. These moments are sacred
      and unforgettable, and for some of them he can find a
      reason, but for others he can find no reason at all. It may
      be the particular colour of a particular dress, or the
      smell of wet woodlands after rain, or some vague thrill of
      pathos or of tenderness. The greater moments speak for
      themselves. What man has not some memory of a white and
      tragic face on a pillow, or two hurt eyes forgiving him for
      some fool adventure, or a hand touching his in the hour of
      disaster? And that was the feeling that Stretton had about
      Jess Viner when he saw her coming out of the doorway of the
      saddler's shop. It was as though he had never seen her
      before as she was and as he knew her to be. Everything
      about her was peculiarly soft and brilliant and convincing.
      He knew that to him she was like no other woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he had fled to her. He had obeyed some natural impulse,
      and now he stood very still, looking at her as though she
      were beginning to fade from him. She had in her hands a
      piece of harness which old Honeyset had been mending. Her
      eyes smiled at him. A moment later he was aware of
      something questioning at the back of her smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw the cart," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew at once that something had hurt him. He was out of
      rhythm, awkward, self-conscious, and she wondered why. He
      had referred to the cart as though he were making an
      excuse, and making it rather lamely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you wait a minute?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The wagon is on ahead--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have to go into Gentry's. I shan't be a minute. I can
      give you a lift."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," he said, almost with the formality of a
      nervous man who is afraid that if he relaxes he will betray
      his nervousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She placed the harness in the cart, and Stretton went to
      the pony's head, sending the boy away with sixpence in his
      pocket. He saw Jess cross the green and disappear into
      Gentry's shop--with its ancient white front jutting out
      from the red body of the house. She remained there less
      than half a minute, and yet when she reappeared she seemed
      to have changed, or rather, his consciousness of her had
      taken on a fuller significance. For fear had entered into
      him, fear and a great yearning. There was a sinister shadow
      on the sunlit grass, the shadow of that other woman. He
      watched Jess with a quick and passionate tenderness and a
      little catch of despair that was born of a sharp, spiritual
      pain. The love in him uttered a cry of yearning. He wanted
      her. My God, how he wanted her! Not basely, not with brute
      selfishness, but as a lonely man stretches out unhappy
      hands to beauty and goodness and warmth and joy. And
      suddenly he had begun to fear that all this was impossible,
      that some shadow was falling between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I have not kept you long?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was smiling. Her face seemed aglow with all that he
      desired in her. He felt himself full of immeasurable and
      poignant tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him quickly, with an air of inquiry, and his
      eyes fell away from hers. He rubbed the pony's nose,
      fondled it. She had heard a sound of grief in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I drive or will you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you," he said, still without looking at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She climbed in and took the reins, and coming round from
      the pony's head he got in and sat opposite her. The pony
      broke into a trot, and the old red houses and the autumn
      trees of Willowmaston swam past them against the thin blue
      of the sky. Now and again Stretton stole a glance at her.
      She was sitting sideways, one hand holding the reins, the
      other resting on the side of the cart, her eyes looking
      ahead up the leaf-strewn road. For the moment she seemed
      unaware of him. She was deep in thought; she had removed
      herself to a distance. That was the sudden, tragic
      impression he had of her; of something infinitely precious
      and desirable and remote, something which he could never
      possess, something for which he yearned with an aching
      helplessness. Less than two hours ago he had been full of a
      happy sense of confidence. His quiet approach to her since
      his talk with Rollin Beal had seemed very real and
      satisfying, but now he was aware of this sense of distance.
      It was self-created, and her very physical nearness to him
      made the feeling more vivid.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was aware of his constraint and of his veiled and
      troubled glances. He was so poor a dissembler. There were
      reasons; she granted that: he might be sensitive and
      difficult, but her heart was a partisan. She remained
      herself in spite of his lost speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leaves, falling leaves! I never mind the autumn."
    </p>
    <p>
      He said that he preferred it to the spring. It had no
      illusions, and you felt that you could begin again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, come," she said, and spread a smile over him, "we are
      not so old as all that."
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes lit up for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Someone said to me not long ago, 'Never be sorry for
      yourself.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wise man. If you feel sorry for yourself you will be
      sorry. No, I'm not a prig."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The very last thing you could be. I wonder what has become
      of Jervis and the wagon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They came through Willowmaston as I drove in. But for that
      you would have found them down there still. The Green Man,
      you know. More suggestion!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed; he was relaxing a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can always suggest a thirst to most Britishers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In spite of the damp climate!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps that is suggestive."
    </p>
    <p>
      They had reached the end of the beech avenue above the
      village, a great arcade of bronze and of gold soaring from
      pillars of a delicate, greyish blackness. The road was
      flaked with fallen leaves, and here and there a stretch of
      grass was made more vivid by the yellow scales that covered
      it. The solemn light of the avenue seemed to descend upon
      both their faces. And then ahead of them they saw a little
      figure in a green knitted coat, with a brown "Burberry"
      over its arm--Isobel Copredy on foot for Ottways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton had forgotten her, or rather he had forgotten that
      she was on the road ahead of them, a figure of discord and
      accusation. His face stiffened. His impulse was to slip out
      of the cart and disappear, anyhow and anywhere. His love
      made him a coward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo," he heard Jessie's voice saying, "Miss Copredy! She
      passed me in her car. Quarrelled with it, perhaps?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard his own voice answering mechanically. "I passed it
      broken down below Willowmaston. Someone was going to tow it
      into Kingsbury."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad it wasn't a horse."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was dislike in her voice--antagonism.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I might offer her a lift, but I shan't."
    </p>
    <p>
      The pony had dropped to a walk, and they gained slowly on
      the figure ahead of them. Once Stretton saw Isobel Copredy
      look round, and he realized that she had seen him. He was
      in a hurry to pass her and to escape, as a nervous horse
      swerves and dashes past some object in the road. She walked
      steadily on. He saw the swing of her skirt, the rather
      graceful movement of her feet, for she had the feet and the
      ankles of a dancer. She shifted the "Burberry" and flung it
      over her shoulder. Almost the action made him think of a
      bravo swinging his cloak aside before using his sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly the cart drew level. Stretton saw her chin come
      round, and he was conscious of compelling himself to meet
      her eyes. But she did not look at him. The hard blue of her
      glance was for Jessie Viner, and there was a touch of
      insolence in it--insolence mingled with hostile curiosity.
      "So you are after him," it seemed to say, "you nice,
      brown-eyed cow! But I can tell you something, young woman!"
      As for Jess, she looked down steadily and appraisingly at
      this other girl, as though her own dislike of her felt
      justified. And while these two young women were looking at
      each other Stretton sat as stiff as some waxwork figure in
      a show, unacknowledging and unacknowledged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon they were past her, with their backs to her blue eyes
      and full-blooded face, but they had left behind them a
      doubled motive, a reinforced malice. Antipathy flashes
      quick as light, and perhaps it is quicker in its action and
      reaction between women than between men. So strong and
      instant was it in this case that neither woman would have
      asked for any reason or accepted any compromise. It is
      probable that Queen Eleanor would have felt moved to poison
      fair Rosamund even though her husband was not poor
      Rosamund's lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, as is often the way with humans, both Stretton and
      Jessie Viner glozed the thing over, and said nothing to
      each other of the girl whom they had passed. With Jess,
      perhaps, the feeling was too elemental to be voiced to a
      man. Isobel Copredy made her feel evil. Nor had John
      Stretton any desire to interfere with her silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get up, Bob," she said, touching the pony with the whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was rare for her to use the whip, and Bob broke into a
      surprised and spanking trot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Silly old thing," she observed; "you are as sensitive
      as--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had almost said "as a man." But not all men were
      sensitive, and her own man was sitting there as though he
      would never utter another word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, there's the wagon," she exclaimed a moment later;
      "but I may as well take you as far as our gate."
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unless the Rising Sun will get in Jervis's eyes!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell him it mustn't. That sort of man has to be told such
      things, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      For in dealing with the plain facts of life she was
      stronger than he was, which makes for a man's salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes of Bob's brisk trotting brought them to the end
      of the lane and the white gate, and Stretton got down here
      and opened the gate for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks for the lift. I think I will wait here for the
      wagon."
    </p>
    <p>
      She drove through, and then held the pony in while she
      spoke to Stretton over the back of the cart. "You are
      coming down to-morrow night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. About six o'clock. Will that be too early?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I'll show you my new hive. You ought to be able to
      copy it. It should be quite easy to make."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him a smile, and let the hungry and restive Bob
      trot on down the lane, while Stretton closed the gate and
      waited there for Jervis and the wagon. But he found himself
      possessed by a restlessness which would not let him remain
      still, and in the end he walked down towards the main road
      and met Jervis and his horses turning into the lane. They
      went up together over the heath, and unloaded the timber in
      the ride between the two pieces of woodland. Jervis struck
      Stretton as being rather sulky; dryness did not agree with
      him; he did not like working for a dry man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't want me no more?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. That's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jervis turned his team, drew the back of a hand across his
      mouth, and journeyed back over the heath. Stretton saw the
      blue tail of the wagon disappear through the gap between
      the old thorn trees and dip down towards Romans Farm. He
      had escaped from his own too urgent thoughts during the
      unloading of the wagon, but now they assailed him again
      like noisy children who cannot be ignored. In fact, his
      thoughts had the quality of noise, irritating, distracting
      noise, and he rebelled against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What rot! One imagines too much."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went in to make tea, but even the welcoming bark of his
      dog had in it a note of discord.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quiet, old chap."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to insist on silence with a rather irritable "Lie
      down," and poor Paul slunk away and found a philosopher's
      corner in the wood shed. Men were moody creatures. There
      were times when you did not know how to take them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet when the dog's depressed tail had disappeared round the
      edge of the door Stretton seemed to discover a sudden
      loneliness in the cottage. Its utter silence made itself
      felt. Never before had he quite realized this silence, its
      immobility, its peculiar individuality, its evenness. He
      stood by the grate, waiting for the kettle to boil, and
      looking about him with a vague sense of strangeness, of
      insecurity. He was assailed by queer, whimsical
      suggestions. There was nothing but "I" in the cottage.
      Nothing moved in it unless he moved it. The place was dead
      save for what his own hands vitalized. He came by the
      rather fantastic thought that but for him the furniture
      would remain exactly where it was, to be covered with dust
      and cobwebs, until it fell into dust. No one would wind the
      clock. He gave a protesting shake of the shoulders, and
      turned to the kettle, which had begun to boil. He decided
      that he would have tea in the sitting-room, and he carried
      the tray in there, to be struck by the seeming darkness of
      the room. The very furniture looked dim and unfamiliar,
      ghost furniture. He went and pulled back the curtains, to
      find that the sun had passed behind a bank of clouds, and
      that the heath itself looked suddenly grey and old.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had seated himself on the sofa where he was reminded,
      and reminded most vividly, of that evening when Isobel
      Copredy had sat there with the rain and the sunlight in her
      hair. He became acutely and sensitively aware of the past.
      It was reborn in him and with a new significance. He got up
      hastily and took one of the arm-chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely she couldn't mean--" he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face grew gloomy. He was half afraid to follow out the
      possible inferences her attitude implied. Why had she
      expected him to go and see her? It seemed to him
      unthinkable that she should wish to see him. He could not
      understand it, unless--And here he paused, more and more
      conscious of a feeling of insecurity, of being in the dark
      and on the edge of some dangerous cliff. What motive could
      she have in wishing to see him, in demanding it almost as a
      right?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should have thought," he reflected, "that she would
      never want to come near me again. Why can't she let it be?
      These damnable memories!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt that she lacked pride and that he had every right
      to ignore her. He swore that he would ignore her, and in
      making the resolution he inspired himself with a sense of
      decision. She was just a Pandora's Box, a thoroughly
      irresponsible piece of mischief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he was able to shrug metaphorical shoulders at
      her. He wandered out on the heath and watched the sun
      emerge below the clouds with a magnificent redness. He
      found himself comparing Isobel Copredy with Jess, and
      thinking how wonderful it was that two creatures born of
      man and woman should be so different. His sense of distance
      from Jess began to melt away. He would see her tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day his quietism had almost recovered itself. He
      worked hard, getting the ground ready for the new building.
      The sun shone; there had been a heavy dew, and the yellow
      bracken glistened with it. The freshness of the morning was
      the freshness of a new hope. The landscape had enlarged
      itself, and the sky seemed higher.
    </p>
    <p>
      He worked hard till tea-time, and after tea he had a bath
      and put on his best suit. He had hardly thought at all of
      Isobel Copredy, but much of Jess. For in thinking of her he
      found a feeling of security, an atmosphere of pleasant and
      wholesome charm. She was like the things which a healthy
      and a sensitive man loves best, the freshness of an autumn
      morning, an orchard in flower, the blue of the hills before
      rain, fresh milk, fruit with the bloom upon it, a bird's
      note at dawn, a day full of the zest of work waiting for
      clean hands. She seemed compounded of all these things. He
      loved her, and his love was good.
    </p>
    <p>
      When dusk was falling he locked the cottage door and walked
      down the path to the gate. A moment ago he had seen this
      gate with its bars outlined black against the fading
      colours of heath and sky, but now someone was standing
      there, a blurred figure in the dusk. His first thought was
      that it was Jessie Viner, and he was within five yards of
      the gate before he discovered his mistake. He was aware of
      another shape beside the girl's, that of a big dog sitting
      pressed close against her skirt, his muzzle thrust between
      the bars of the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton knew that there was nothing for him to do but to
      walk on. Probably she had been crossing the heath and had
      paused at the gate. That is what he suggested to himself,
      but somehow he did not believe it. She was leaning her
      crossed arms on the top of the gate and looking straight up
      the path towards him. He thought that there was irony,
      menace in this attitude of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were you coming to see me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He could distinguish her face clearly now, and gauge its
      expression as she asked him that question. He saw the shine
      of her eyes and teeth. The dog gave a low growl, and she
      administered a flick with her foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quiet! Well, were you coming to see me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he said. "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      He fancied that she smiled, but it did not seem to him that
      there was any mirth in that smile. She had the appearance
      of barring the way. Her white teeth were like the white
      teeth of her dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I just wondered. I thought that I would give you till
      to-night. And wearing your nice Bond Street suit and the
      front door key in your pocket!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with level, merciless eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Romans Farm, is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the farmer's pretty daughter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This time he made no sign. His face had gone white and
      stiff.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her head back, and he saw the shadows in her
      nostrils, and her narrowed lids mocking and full of menace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought so. But, really, you can't go there."
    </p>
    <p>
      He blurted the obvious retort.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is my affair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, pardon me, I share it. You can't go down there. If
      you ask me I will tell you why."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a moment of fear mingled with exasperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't it a question of decency? Besides, there is
      something else."
    </p>
    <p>
      He became more and more conscious of the menace in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you remember part of that evening when you
      behaved like a wild beast?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why drag in that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why? Because you don't seem to realize the sort of man you
      are. You don't seem to realize that something else
      happened. I suppose you would plead lapse of memory."
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a step towards the gate, but she put out a warning
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. There is going to be no repetition of that sort of
      thing. My dog is rather savage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean? Tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She remained silent for a moment, as though to tantalize
      him, or to emphasize her own seriousness, but when she
      began to speak again her voice was casual yet hard. It was
      like pouring poison drop by drop into a cup. She saw
      Stretton stiff and motionless in the middle of the path. He
      looked bewildered, stupefied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe it," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a passionate protest in his voice, and yet his
      own heart misgave him. Could he be sure that what she said
      was not true, and that he had a complete recollection of
      all and of everything?
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will have to believe it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She removed her arms from the gate and stood back a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not asking you to consider me. I have a pride of my
      own. My luck is that I don't need your consideration. But,
      of course, if you have any sentiment--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained voiceless, and with a side-glance at him in the
      dusk she went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I might forgive you that, but I am not going to forgive
      your lack of conscience in playing around that other girl.
      Don't you see that you can't do it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He made some sort of sound, and she chose to find in it a
      note of defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you refuse to see it I shall have to make you see it.
      Women should hang together. You will give up going to that
      farm."
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes stared at her blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you go I shall tell her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will tell her," he repeated dully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. Have no doubt about that."
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to hesitate for a moment, with his head bowed
      down and his hands hanging limply. Then he turned about,
      walked to the door of the cottage, unlocked it, and going
      in, closed the door.
    </p>

      THE SOUND OF A GUN
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      At Romans Farm Jess Viner waited, sitting by the window
      with her work in her lap. It was too dark for her to work
      now, and as the red glow faded in the west, the lane itself
      became dim and obscure, but she still remained there,
      waiting for this shy lover. With a whirring of wheels the
      old clock in the hall struck seven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jess stood up. She leaned with her hands upon the
      window-sill and looked out into the vagueness of the night.
      The sky was clear and the stars shining, and little
      splinters of dim light broke upon the window-panes or
      touched the white slats of the fence. She could see the
      hedges, trees and farm buildings as mere solid masses of
      darkness against the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder?" she thought, and then the opening of a door
      broke in upon her reflections and let an oblong patch of
      light into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was her mother who had entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, all in the dark?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jess remained at the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I get the lamp?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother bent down to put a match to the fire; the day
      had been warm and the fire had not been needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Stretton not come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe he has been working late."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think he works too hard."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother made no comment upon this, yet there was a quiet
      sympathy between these two women, and each knew what the
      other might have said. The dry wood was crackling in the
      grate, and the young flames springing up, and Mary Viner
      remained on her knees watching the flames as though they
      had an undying fascination for her. She heard Jess moving
      in the room behind her. A moment later she heard her
      daughter go out into the hall. There was the opening of a
      door, and a draught of cold air touched the spreading
      flames close to Mary Viner's knees. Their light played upon
      her face. It was attentive, thoughtful, faintly sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has gone out to meet him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She continued on her knees, and there was something of
      resignation and of appeal in her attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, it's natural. A girl must choose. But he's
      difficult, a little queer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jess was in the lane. She had not troubled to put on a hat
      and coat, for she had told herself that she would go no
      farther than the white gate, but when she reached the gate
      and stood resting her arms upon it, something was added to
      her impulse. Before her spread the swarthy void of the
      heath. The dark thorn hedges rose on either side of her.
      She could smell the autumn smell of them and it had a
      suggestion of sadness. The stars blinked overhead. She was
      aware of the silence, a silence that was unbroken.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he had not come. She wondered why, feeling that he
      would not come and that that strange and difficult shyness
      of his had returned. For a long while now she had been
      puzzled by it, but lately it had ceased to puzzle her,
      rather, there was something in him which had to be guessed
      at and understood, and she was trying to understand it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder?" she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she did not remain content with wondering. She had
      strength and that warm courage which dares rather than
      reflects, nor was she self-consciously shy of her own
      motives. Instead of brooding she opened the gate and began
      to make her way over the heath. After the first hundred
      yards of following the uncertain trackway through the furze
      and heather she had a point of light to guide her, a light
      in one of Stretton's windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, up yonder, another woman had been sitting in the
      heather outside John Stretton's gate, her dog curled up
      beside her, with his muzzle on her knee. Isobel Copredy
      could see the vague space of the cottage doorway, but she
      trusted more to the alertness of her dog to warn her of any
      movement beyond the hedge. Moreover, Stretton had lit a
      lamp and that suggested the stay at home, unless he was
      trying to be cunning. She waited there for an hour, until
      she saw a second light moving in the upper part of the
      cottage, and that seemed to her final. She had remained
      there with the idea of discovering the potency of her
      poison. She had driven the man-thing back into his burrow
      and he had not dared to emerge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It works," she thought, and getting up silently took a
      turn of the dog's leash round her wrist and made off
      southwards over the heath. And so it happened that these
      two women passed each other, but at such a distance that
      Isobel's dog did not prick up his ears and warn her. They
      went by like two shadows in the night, neither suspecting
      the presence of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Jess reached the cottage she paused there with her
      eyes on the lighted window. The blind was up and the
      curtains undrawn, and almost she was persuaded that any
      moment that light might be quenched, and she would hear the
      opening and closing of the door and Stretton's footsteps
      coming down the path. He had been working late; that was
      the explanation. He intended coming to the farm for supper.
      But as the minutes went by and the light continued to burn
      steadily in his sitting-room, she began to doubt and to
      wonder. It was something more than curiosity that moved her
      silently to open the gate and make her way to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lamp was burning on the round oak table in a far corner
      of the room, nor did it give a very bright light, for it
      was turned low and covered with a shade. Stretton was in
      the arm-chair by the fireplace, but the fire was unlit. He
      was sitting there perfectly still, leaning forward
      slightly, his elbows on his knees, his head between his
      hands. She could not see his face, but somehow she could
      imagine it. And she was shocked, for this was not an
      attitude of meditation, but sheer, motionless misery, of
      soul-searching helplessness. She was sure of it. To her it
      was a picture without words, and her heart divined the
      meaning of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She breathed softly, held back in the outer darkness and
      waited. She was waiting for some movement, some sign of
      purpose and of will force, but it did not come. He remained
      sitting there just as she had first seen him, and it seemed
      to her that never had she seen a human figure remain so
      still. She sensed a stricken pathos in his stillness, the
      rigid outlines of a tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She faced her own problem. What was she to do? Tap at the
      window and challenge him, break the spell of his stillness
      and then ignore what she had seen?
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow she felt that she could not do it, that she had no
      right to do it. She was in the position of a spy, an
      innocent spy whose impulse was to lay soft hands upon the
      man's unhappiness. But in her there was some deeper wisdom,
      a sensitive restraint, a feeling that a confession that was
      provoked was not what either she or the man in yonder would
      desire. If he had a secret was she to surprise it like some
      raw schoolgirl jumping out and crying "Bo" from behind a
      door? That he had a secret, some tragic disharmony in this
      lonely life of his, she was sure, but she felt as a man
      might have felt, that the choice should be his, natural and
      inevitable, not angled for with a feminine pin.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went back a step or two, and as she did so she saw
      Stretton move. For a moment she stood rigid, holding her
      breath. The dog Paul was asleep beside his chair, and she
      saw Stretton bend down, pick up the dog and take him on his
      knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something poignant and infinitely distressful in
      that act of his. She gave him a last compassionate glance,
      and made her silent way back to the gate. In a little while
      she was standing in the porch of Romans Farm, and she
      loitered there a moment before going in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Viner was reading the paper before the fire, and his
      wife sat sewing by the lamp. The table was laid for supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither pretended to notice Jess's absence or blundered
      into asking her where she had been. The clock struck eight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Viner put his paper aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what about supper, Mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you please, Tom."
    </p>
    <p>
      The three of them sat down round the table, and no one
      ventured to refer to the fourth place which Stretton had
      left empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week went by and Stretton did not come to the farm, nor
      did he send any message by the boy. Less comfortable people
      than the Viners might well have taken offence at his casual
      whimsies, but comfortable people are in no hurry to judge.
      Moreover, both Tom and his wife understood that Jess was
      involved in Stretton's eccentric shyness, and Jess showed
      no signs of petulance.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been some talk between her and her mother. Any
      possible element of discord had vanished after that talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is very unhappy, and unhappy people are difficult."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother was moved to question his unhappiness and its
      cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't know, I suppose? He's not ill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. Some men don't talk easily. I respect him for that.
      But I should like him to tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said her mother with an intent look, "some secret or
      other. And you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her daughter nodded, and then kept her head bent over her
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It keeps him away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It shouldn't, unless--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jess raised her eyes, and the appeal that was within them
      touched the woman in Mrs. Mary. They were good friends,
      these two. And the daughter's eyes said as plainly as could
      be: "Please don't meddle. Trust me. I think I know that it
      is not easy either for him or for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother left it at that, though she discussed the affair
      with her man before blowing out the bedroom candle. Their
      attitude towards John Stretton and his queerness was
      inspired largely by their faith in Jess. She had been
      always a girl with character, and as far as they knew she
      had never been interested in any man. And yet there was a
      danger in the newness of the experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think Stretton would want to hurt her," said her
      man. "I've watched them together. He looks at her as though
      she were too good to be touched."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's shy of her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For some reason of his own. That's my feeling. Let them
      try to settle it between them. I don't believe in
      meddling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor do I," said his wife; "but I want my girl to be
      happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was known at Romans that Stretton was not ill, for he
      was working and working hard, but Jess was the only one who
      suspected that he took his work as a man takes a drug.
      Sometimes, when she went out on the heath and the wind was
      in the right direction, she could hear the sound of
      hammering, and on other days she saw him as a little figure
      in the field below the wood, digging and digging with
      steady obstinacy. Then the weather changed and heavy rains
      set in, and so far as the farm was concerned Stretton was
      neither seen nor heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed lost in the rain up yonder, in the grey of the
      low scudding clouds, in the falling of the dead leaves. It
      was as though the wilderness had engulfed him. Yet he
      continued to work out of doors; if he got wet through, what
      did it matter? If he lived on tea and tinned meat and jam
      and cheese, what did it matter? He was too unhappy to
      trouble himself with the so-called minor details of life.
      When a man's mind is sick he is apt to forget his body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet things happened to him. He was like a man trying to
      swim in a rough sea and making no headway. He was without
      purpose or decision; he could not see the land for which he
      was making; he even doubted whether there was such land.
      His too fine sensitiveness was all against him, and he did
      not know quite enough about life and about women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Rugglesworth, who brought his milk and his letters,
      was the only male creature whom he saw for ten whole days,
      and he even avoided seeing this boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet things happened; they happened within him, and with
      such passion and fierceness that he was approaching that
      state when a man is not quite sane.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each evening she came across the heath, wet or fine,
      and just when darkness was falling, with that infernal dog
      of hers loping at her heels. She would stop at his gate and
      lean her arms upon it. She never spoke to him. She behaved
      like a ghost which had set out to haunt him, an evil spirit
      which itwas impossible to exorcise. It was incredible and
      yet it was true. He had a feeling of being surrounded by
      her, penetrated by her, tempted by her. She was reducing
      him to subjection. She was playing a very advanced and
      original game of cat and mouse, partly because it amused
      her, partly out of devilry, partly because the man in him
      piqued her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had moments of utter gloom and moments of exasperation.
      And one evening his exasperation had its way. He was
      haunted by the thought that some evening one of the Viners
      would come up and find her hanging over his gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went down and spoke to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why the devil do you come here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because it amuses me," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt himself rather helpless in the presence of her
      cynicism.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not keep away?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because you might go trespassing."
    </p>
    <p>
      He understood her and he flared. He had an instant answer
      to that, the angry answer of a generous man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think that I would go there now? Do you think I
      would mix her up with you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be careful," she said. "I think I hold the whip."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was shaking in the dusk, but suddenly a certain thought
      came to him, and he felt himself stiffen. It was one of
      those madly sane thoughts which possess a man because they
      are final and convincing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I warn you," he said, "I'm not going to stand this."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a gun in the cottage and a few cartridges which he
      kept for shooting rabbits, and next day he loaded the gun
      and laid it ready on the window-sill.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening the sky was clear, with a touch of frost in
      the air, and the stars very bright. She was later than
      usual, and as she came over the heath she sang snatches of
      some song, and her voice suggested mockery and defiance.
      Stretton was sitting on the sofa with the window half open,
      but when he heard her voice he got into a kneeling position
      and picked up the gun. He saw her come to the gate. The
      upper part of her figure was clear and distinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fired above and to the right of her. The flash stabbed
      the darkness, and the crash of the report reverberated in
      the woods. He saw that she had disappeared from the gate,
      for some of the pellets had whipped into the hedge less
      than two yards from where she had been standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton pushed the window wide open, and leaning out,
      called to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was in the air. Next time it will be your dog."
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer him at once for she was rather badly
      scared, but she had a passion for the last word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's bluff," she shouted; "look out, or I'll call it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had better not," he said, closing the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was strung up, all nerves, coiled like a spring, just as
      he had been on bad nights in the trenches. He was opposing
      something, fighting it, waiting to be attacked or to
      attack. She did not appear again at the gate, but he
      re-opened the window and knelt there listening. His chin,
      lips and nostrils were sharp and cruel. He was determined
      to shoot that dog of hers if she had the audacity to
      return. In fact the impulse to shoot her was very near the
      surface of his consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll see," he thought, kneeling there and gripping the
      gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a feeling that she might still be lurking there and
      that she would return, and he was almost savagely
      determined to prove to her that he was not bluffing. He
      waited. He could hear nothing. He was ready to wait there
      all night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet a man's vision is limited. Stretton had fired that shot
      to scare the devil, and it did not occur to him at the
      moment that the sound of it might light on the ears of his
      good angel. Jess, coming back from Willowmaston, heard it
      as she reached the Romans Farm gate. It was no rare sound,
      but it was rare at such an hour, and from the direction of
      Mascall's Wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      She met her father coming across from the buildings. He too
      had heard the shot and been puzzled by it, and as they
      stood together, listening, the same thought occurred to
      both.
    </p>
    <p>
      "From Mr. Stretton's?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is he doing out with a gun at this hour?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Viner was not a wordy man, and when something called him he
      took the direct path. He felt what Jess felt, and it was
      sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go in, child."
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked away up the lane, and she knew whither he was
      bound. Half-way up the heath he was passed by someone in
      the darkness, but his blunt "Who's that?" brought nothing
      but the growl of a dog. The two shapes disappeared, and
      being a sensible man he did not chase shadows but went on
      towards Mascall's Wood. Reaching the gate, and leaning over
      it to lift the latch that was on the inside, he had what
      would have been to any man a rather astonishing experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you I'll shoot."
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice came from the cottage, the voice of a man under
      the influence of some great excitement. Old Viner sang out
      at once:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, there, Mr. Stretton."
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited, holding the gate open with one hand, thoroughly
      astonished and trying to grasp the situation. A moment
      later he heard the cottage door open, and Stretton came
      out, but he did not advance down the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that you, Mr. Viner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure. We heard the sound of a gun up here, and--well, you
      know, I just wondered--"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a short silence. Then Stretton spoke, and his
      voice sounded strangely weak and tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that's all right. I've seen someone hanging about here
      and I just fired to scare the bird."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, a tramp or a gipsy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something of that breed. I'm sorry to have dragged you all
      the way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No trouble at all. Come back with me and have supper?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the man by the cottage blurted out some foolish
      and involved excuse, and turning towards the door, wished
      Thomas Viner good night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmer echoed it and closed the gate, and that was all
      that these two men said to each other, but if Thomas Viner
      had not used his voice he had used his wits, and his
      conjectures troubled him. He felt responsible, soberly
      responsible.
    </p>
    <p>
      At home, where the supper table was laid, and the lamplight
      showed him Jess looking at the fire, he made light of the
      incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, nothing. Mr. Stretton thought he had a sneak thief
      around the place, and that it would be a joke to give him a
      broad hint."
    </p>
    <p>
      But later, when he and his wife were alone together, he had
      more to say, and his face was serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is something very wrong with that lad. He ought to
      be looked to. I shall go down and see Mellor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean he's--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, not quite that," said her man; "but his brother gave
      me a hint or two. I think Mellor ought to know."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      <a name="c26" id="c26">XXVI</a>
    </h1>
    <h1>
      MIST
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Jessie Viner knew that Mellor of Kingsbury had been to see
      John Stretton, for the doctor left his car outside the
      white gate at the end of the lane and walked over the heath
      to Mascall's Wood. Jess saw the car, and she also saw
      Mellor come back and go down towards the buildings to speak
      to her father. Tom Viner was in the big barn, and Jess saw
      them standing in the doorway talking. Mellor remained there
      for about ten minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the moment she felt herself a spectator, a listener,
      and yet when her father came in to his tea he seemed to
      have some unspoken message for her. He looked at her with
      his kind, calm eyes. He even teased her a little, and she
      knew that when this mood was upon him he had no trouble on
      his mind. Whatever Mellor had said to him she divined that
      it had been reassuring.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, Mellor had observed very little in Stretton that
      could cause the doctor in him to stand on the alert. He had
      not gone as the doctor, but as a friend of Rollin Beal's
      paying a friend's call, a call, as he expressed it, that
      should have been made months ago. He sat in Stretton's
      living-room, smoked a couple of cigarettes, and gossiped.
      He was a big, blond, easy creature with an abundance of
      human tact, a man whom other men loved instantly, a man who
      sat deeply and comfortable in a chair and never on the edge
      of it. Stretton was at ease with him, yet he did not talk
      much. They spoke rather of impersonal things: Mellor in his
      deep, confident, gentle voice, Stretton a little shyly.
      Mellor admired the cottage and its setting. He never hinted
      at its loneliness. He thought Stretton a little thin and
      fine drawn, but with a thinness that might be accounted for
      by overwork. Hard physical labour has that effect upon
      those who are not born and bred to it. There was a touch of
      asceticism on Stretton's face, a little frown on the
      forehead, a suggestion of self-suppression in the eyes. He
      was living a hard, clean life, and for a sensitive and
      lonely man such a life is not easy. But Mellor found
      nothing abnormal in him, nothing sinister. The surface
      might be a little tense and brittle, but it seemed sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come down and look me up some day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton said that he would. He was drawn to this big,
      blue-eyed man who gave one no sense of hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Choose a Sunday. I'm always in to tea on Sundays."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mellor told Thomas Viner that if there was any trouble at
      all it was due probably to overwork and loneliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does he drop in and see you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sometimes. But he is queer about it. Says he will come,
      and then stays away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shyness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get him down. It will do him good."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mellor was so disinclined to take a gloomy view of
      Stretton's mentality that he did not write to Rollin Beal.
      Much might have been prevented and explained had letters
      passed between these two men, but then a woman might have
      been cheated of her handiwork, and a woman's hands may be
      wiser than men's brains.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Jess had begun to understand. Love may see more, or it
      may see less than the coldly normal eye, and John Stretton
      was being starved. He was starving himself as fine
      sensitive men have starved themselves in all ages for some
      shred of honour, some spiritual ideal, or some piece of
      loyalty. He was against himself. He simply could not do
      what the majority of less fine-tempered men would have
      found the doing of absurdly easy. And so he suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      For it might have been so easy. He was the prisoner of his
      own ideals, of his fastidious sense of what was right and
      desirable and honest. Even if he realized that life and its
      work-a-day street corner honour was very different from his
      own way of feeling and reacting to things, he could not
      step down to that lower level. It was not religion or
      wisdom which held him back; it was simply what was in him,
      the way he was built.
    </p>
    <p>
      For he made the mistake which so many sensitive men make,
      he misjudged woman. He did not realize the strength of the
      sex in them, the power of the elemental appeal. He thought
      them colder, far more fastidious and tranquil than they
      are. He was still obsessed by many crude notions, by an
      idea of exaggerated purity, by a dread of shocking some
      imaginary snow goddess. He felt that it was impossible for
      him to tell any woman of the net of falsity and innuendo
      and suggestion which Isobel Copredy had thrown over him. He
      thought that any ordinary woman would be shocked by such a
      confession. He did not realize that if she had the heart
      and the courage to care she would tear the other woman's
      net to tatters, fiercely yet compassionately, and with
      infinite exultation. For when the deeps call, your true
      woman will always rush to rescue her man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile those excursions to his gate had ceased. He did
      not quite know what to make of the relief, whether that
      half-mad act of his had been so convincing that my lady
      kept away. It had seemed to him that nothing could frighten
      her. The truth was that he had frightened her, and that she
      was casting about for a safer and more subtle weapon with
      which to wound him. Some natures derive pleasure from
      inflicting pain, and the weapon was very ready to Isobel
      Copredy's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      To leave a person in suspense, to hold him in doubt, to
      threaten with a threat! To pretend to be morally indignant,
      proud, careful of other people's happiness! All this was
      easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so she wrote him a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a clever letter. It put him down in the ditch; it
      dared him to emerge from it and carry mud into some other
      woman's life. It showed an extreme ingenuity in putting him
      in the wrong, everywhere and in every way. It played upon
      his sensitiveness, his poignant consciousness of his own
      inward blemish. It pretended to that modern honesty and
      frankness which can be so cruel. It aimed a blow at all his
      illusions while assuming many fine illusions of its own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remember," it said, "I am a woman and I stand by my sex. I
      am not going to have another woman's life made a problem. I
      take your promise for granted. Otherwise I shall chip in."
    </p>
    <p>
      He read that letter one November afternoon when the world
      was very grey and the leaves were falling. There was a
      white mist abroad, a queer, fickle mist which ran into
      strange cliffs and promontories, and spread itself in
      mysterious pools. Half the heath would be shrouded in it,
      the other half clear and free, and the line of parting
      would be sudden and surprising. Romans Farm was hidden. At
      one time the mist came up to Stretton's hedge and stopped
      there as though some great hand had made a gesture of "no
      farther." In the woods the trees dripped steadily, and the
      bracken was the colour of rusted iron and of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Stretton had read that letter he burnt it, and went
      out on to the heath. He became involved in the mist, but he
      was hardly aware of it, for he was trying to grope his way
      through an emotional fog. He wandered over heather, brushed
      against wet gorse bushes, and skirted round spectral thorns
      and birch trees which emerged suddenly out of the mist. He
      had no sense of physical direction, but his spiritual sense
      of direction seemed to become more and more clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      He realized that he would have to give up the thought of
      Jessie Viner; that he would have to keep away from her. He
      could not tell her what Isobel Copredy swore to be true,
      and if he could not tell Jess that what right had he to go
      near her? He did not know whether to believe Isobel Copredy
      or to disbelieve her. He could not understand a girl in her
      position inventing such a thing. She could have no motive--
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down in the wet heather and faced the choice of
      surrendering all that of which he had dreamed. He was
      acutely miserable, humiliated, very lonely. He wanted Jess
      as he had never wanted her before; he wanted the healing
      spirit in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet his decision was that a man has no right to cast a
      shadow. It is better that he should keep out of the
      sunlight, and so avoid the casting of shadows on other
      people's happiness. If he had had some beastly physical
      disease would he have dared to think of approaching her?
    </p>
    <p>
      But the decision was cumulative. It provoked the thought
      that he could not go on living up here. The health and the
      healing and the hope had gone out of his life in the
      wilderness. He felt that he could not bear the new and
      fatal loneliness that would descend on him. To be shut out
      of Romans Farm, to have no single human being of
      intelligence to whom he could speak! Besides, the
      provocation, the tantalizing hunger of it, with her so
      near! And what would they think?
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to see that he would have to give up and go away.
      Or struggle on, growing so desperate that he might fall to
      Isobel Copredy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the sudden thought struck him, had she had that in
      her mind, was it possible that she foresaw the leap of a
      desperate and burning man into any water that might cool
      him? Did she count on him being so much a man that some day
      he would come savagely craving for that which she, and the
      woman, could give?
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought shocked him, suggesting as it did a glimpse of
      some unlovely future, a life touching the edge of
      degeneration and depravity. He was essentially clean, with
      a natural hatred of all that was sodden and smeary, and as
      he sat there he seemed to see himself dragged down by some
      sex disharmony, coarsened, blunted, driven from woman to
      woman. But he broke the thread of this morbid brooding, and
      jumping up, began to wander on over the heath. The mist was
      thicker than ever, and though he set his face in what he
      imagined to be the right direction, he soon realized that
      he was lost. Every furze bush looked the same, and there
      were no paths to guide him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I walk long enough," he reflected, "I shall come to
      something."
    </p>
    <p>
      The ground ran fairly level, and he knew that to reach
      Mascall's Wood he ought to be walking uphill, but he held
      on, knowing that in time he would strike a hedge, or some
      familiar landmark, or reach the edge of the heath. He had
      been walking for ten minutes when he came quite suddenly
      upon a few scattered thorn trees and a stretch of grass,
      and he seemed to remember the outlines of the thorns. He
      walked on. Faint lines showed in the grass, and a moment
      later he realized that they were wheel tracks. He had come
      out at the very place where the Romans Farm lane died away
      at the edge of the heath.
    </p>
    <p>
      The white gate was a little to his left, and he would have
      to pass it in picking up the path to Mascall's Wood. The
      mist lay heavy and silent, but as he walked quickly over
      the grass he heard the click of the gate. He was right upon
      it, and he saw its whiteness swing towards him through the
      film of vapour.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had come upon each other so suddenly in the mist that
      Jess saw John Stretton's face in all the nakedness of its
      emotion. There was no premeditation here, no conscious
      posing, no setting of the stage. They had met like two
      ships in a sea fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jess!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart had been so full of Jessie Viner that the sudden
      presence of her was like the materialization of his own
      vision. He was taken utterly unawares. He stretched out a
      hand to touch her, but he did not touch her. She was
      conscious of his great, hungry eyes and stammering mouth.
      His love was a lamp which could not be hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I got lost," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes seemed covered with a film of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the heath?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I--I did not know I was here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you are not lost now."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had a hand on the gate. She was overpowered by the
      sense of the nearness and the urgency of his need to her.
      She vibrated to it. She was aware of him as something blind
      and helpless and inarticulate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Won't you come back with me, John?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her, and he did not speak. She saw his lips
      move. It was as though some hand were dragging him back
      from a doorway, closing the door and shutting out the
      light. A kind of deadness seemed to fall upon his face. His
      eyes made her think of a man dying, a man whose heart cried
      out against death while his lips remained mute.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't," he blurted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She remained quite still. The silence was like a wave
      poised before breaking. Suddenly he caught at the gate with
      both hands as though he needed a grip upon something hard
      and tangible. His arms and body stiffened. Then he seemed
      to thrust himself off. His eyes swept her face. She knew
      that he was going back into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't," he said, and fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      She let him go. She might have called him back, yet the
      thing which restrained her was stronger and more wise than
      either of them knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      But from that moment she understood. He wanted her, as no
      other man had wanted her, as no other man would ever want
      her. She vibrated to his dear necessity. She was not afraid
      of it. Nothing but his silence stood between them.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h1>

    <h1>
      SILENCE
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, but what a silence! She knew now that there must be
      some almost tragic reason for it, and in her heart of
      hearts she did not care perhaps what that reason was. He
      was hungry, he was thirsty, and she was food and drink. His
      need of her--the woman in her understood that need--filled
      her with a quite indescribable tenderness, a desire to open
      her arms, to give him all that he lacked, all that he
      hungered for. His love was no gross thing, no mere
      appetite, but it was passionate as a great and wholesome
      love is passionate. He wanted her, soul and body, bosom and
      heart, thoughts and hands, laughter and lips. He wanted
      every bit of her, in the rising and setting of the sun, in
      the heat of the day, in eating and sleeping, in those
      moments of silence when nothing is said and everything
      understood. She felt all this, and was thrilled by it,
      penetrated by it. A woman conceives love as she conceives a
      child. It becomes her, spirit and flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she considered this silence of his and the meaning of
      it, and here her intuition touched hands with the sensitive
      and half feminine wisdom of Rollin Beal. It was not she who
      should break that silence. It was the man's right, his
      duty. She might work for it, wisely, tenderly, removing a
      little of the barrier piece by piece, but the last blow of
      the pick must come from him. Much of her was involved in
      this, her pride and her feeling for his pride, her sense of
      rightness, her subtle appreciation of what was positive and
      courageous in the male. The man advances, the woman
      retreats or waits to parley. There is such a thing as
      snatching away a man's privileges and so making him in some
      subtle way a little less than a man. A sensitive and a
      proud man would feel that. It might leave a little streak
      of shame in him, a sense of disharmony. He had got to
      convince her in order to convince himself. He had to open
      the door and not have it opened for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      That cry of "I can't" must change to "I must, I will," else
      she would have failed with his failure. That was what she
      felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile she was full of conjectures, tender curiosity.
      She did not meet him for a week; he remained invisible, a
      thing of perplexing uncertainties. Sometimes she saw him
      working in the field on the edge of the wood, a little
      distant figure, problematical and solitary. It seemed to
      her that he worked less fiercely than of old, that he moved
      more slowly. His heart was not in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, Stretton continued working much as
      modern man goes to meals, not because he is hungry, but
      because meals have become a habit. He felt that if he
      stopped working the whole machinery of his life would fall
      to pieces. He had nothing left him but this habit of work.
      He dug, he hammered at his new sheds, he cut firewood, he
      cooked and washed and cleaned, but all the while he had the
      feeling that all this activity was as futile as the
      whirling of a squirrel in a cage. It led to nothing, at
      least to nothing that mattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      For man cannot live by work alone. He must have his work
      crowned by comradeship. He must play, think, dream, make
      love. The perfume of life comes from within. No mere
      socialization of labour on material lines is going to make
      men happy. One might as well expect to make a machine happy
      by oiling it. And Stretton was more than unhappy; he was
      very near to breaking point. He told himself continually
      that the only thing for him to do was to give up and clear
      out, and try some other sort of adventure elsewhere. He
      found the evenings and the nights intolerable. He was sick
      with loneliness and desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      But having made the decision he could not bring himself to
      the point of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrote to Rollin Beal, and then tore up the letter. He
      wrote to Carlyon, and this letter shared a like fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one dim November afternoon he came very near to flight.
      In fact he packed a suit-case, turned Virginia adrift,
      locked up the cottage, and taking Paul with him, started
      off over the heath. His idea was to catch a night train
      from Kingsbury to London, though how London would help him
      he did not know. He was both excited and afraid. Yet as he
      trudged over the heath in the dusk he saw a light shine out
      suddenly below him, a light in one of the windows of Romans
      Farm. He hesitated. He set his suitcase down in the heather
      and watched the light. The dog lay down beside the
      suit-case and waited upon the whims of the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently they turned back. They retraced their steps to
      the cottage; the door was unlocked, the lamp lit, and Paul
      as though completely puzzled, stood and sniffed at the
      suit-case which his master had placed on a chair. What an
      absurd adventure, absurdly begun and absurdly ended!
      Stretton came back from lighting the kitchen fire and found
      Paul's nose questioning the suit-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton saw the humour of the thing, its ridiculous
      pathos.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must seem pretty silly to you, old chap."
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog's eyes looked up at the man's. He wagged a tail. He
      might have answered, "Oh, well, you know, unless we fellows
      were a bit foolish at times we should be awful prigs."
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyhow, Stretton picked the dog up and fondled him. He felt
      that if he did not let loose some of the human yearning
      that was in him he would go mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      More days passed, dim, mist-laden days, melancholy and very
      still. It was as though the sun had taken off his golden
      sandals, muffled himself in a cloak, and now crept across
      the sky on bare and silent feet. For a while Jessie Viner
      did not see the man, and then the strangeness and the
      unexpectedness of her way of seeing him came as a shock to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather had changed. A steady frost had set in, and the
      nights were brilliant and very still. The trembling of the
      stars seemed part of the trembling of her troubled self.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moon came and made a vigil that had been vague and
      impossibly patient, certain and vivid.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not know what to do; she was greatly moved, shaken
      with compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      About that time Mary Viner fell sick with influenza. The
      Rugglesworths had started it, or rather, the carter had
      collected it from the Rising Sun and brought it to the
      cottages. Sam was sent down to Kingsbury for Dr. Mellor.
      Now Mellor was very busy, for influenza had spread through
      the scattered farms and cottages, and his day's work was
      never done. He voyaged up muddy lanes, trudged across
      fields, and ended his pilgrimage by moonlight. He was
      elusive and difficult to catch. On that particular day he
      did not reach Romans Farm till seven o'clock, and by that
      time Tom Viner had sickened and joined his wife in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jess waited for the doctor at the foot of the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have some hot supper ready for you, Dr. Mellor."
    </p>
    <p>
      His blue eyes looked tired in his grizzled blond head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, that's kind of you. As a matter of fact, I need it.
      If one goes too long without food, you know, when you are
      in and out of sick rooms, you are apt to go down yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know. Come in to the fire. What do you think of my two
      patients?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think there is any need for you to worry."
    </p>
    <p>
      As a country doctor who was much loved Mellor was always on
      the edge of being overworked, and even his fine physique
      and healthy good temper could not stave off a tiredness
      which was irritable. Jess let him alone. She sat him down
      to a good hot meal, and went upstairs with some milk for
      her two patients, but she was back again before Mellor had
      touched the biscuits and cheese. He smiled at her. He felt
      better. He did not suspect her of any ulterior motive.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took her needlework and sat down by the fire, yet,
      though in her wisdom she had no desire to vex with
      questions a tired and hungry man, she had her web spun for
      him, the most innocent of webs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose I was right in lighting a fire in their room?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Absolutely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is very cold to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is. Several degrees, I should think. I have had a day
      of it. My man went sick this morning, and I have been my
      own chauffeur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Double work! Did you know that you left the lights burning
      on your car?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I switched them off."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mellor helped himself to biscuits and cheese. If he thought
      of Jess at all, he was aware of her as a comfortable and
      comely young woman with a great deal of common sense, a
      pleasant voice, and rather beautiful hair. An admirable
      comrade for some lucky man! He was quite unprepared against
      being ambushed by her at eight o'clock on a winter evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      "About medicine," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is rather late to-night. I could send the boy down
      first thing in the morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all right. I carry a few drugs with me. I have left
      some tablets upstairs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Milk diet, I suppose? And you will want their temperatures
      taken. I have a thermometer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellent," he said, with a smiling and indulgent glance
      at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her work aside and rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will be ready for your coffee in a minute?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I to have coffee?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      She prepared to use the web of ministrations she had spun
      about him. She went out to the kitchen and brought in the
      coffee. He was still busy with the biscuits and cheese. She
      picked up her work, sat down by the fire, and resumed her
      sewing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Mellor, may I ask you a question?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her head remained bent over her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A dozen if you like, now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the trouble with Mr. Stretton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mellor let a cube of cheese fall off the piece of biscuit
      on which it was balanced. He looked at Jessie Viner and
      found her calmly intent upon her sewing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't quite understand you, Miss Viner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced up, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is something, isn't there? I'm not asking this out
      of curiosity or I should expect to be snubbed."
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes met hers. In fact he had been quickly considering
      the kindest snub he could administer, but there was
      something in her expression, in her attitude, in her
      pleasant self-possession which gave him pause. He replaced
      the cube of cheese on the piece of biscuit and ate it, and
      his silence was reflective.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's rather a poser," he said presently; "are you asking
      me as a doctor or a man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Both."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, you know, that as a doctor--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You cannot answer my question? But do you think I should
      have the cheek to ask you such a question unless--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He half turned his chair from the table; his manner had
      become professional, defensive, but if he was strong on the
      point of etiquette, he was not so sure of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unless?" he echoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had a very good reason for asking it. I have."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned his chair again so that he faced her. Her attack
      had astonished him, but he was still more surprised by the
      calmly passionate way in which she pressed it. Looking at
      her he had the feeling that there was nothing frivolous or
      guileful about her challenge. He had the impression that
      she was very much in earnest, deeply concerned, moved to
      attack all reticences and to put them aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Miss Viner," he said, "you may have a very good
      reason, but it is quite impossible for me to discuss
      anything of this sort--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were steady and slightly smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it quite impossible? There is something?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyebrows bristled over his blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha, young lady, you are pumping me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am. And supposing something very serious depends on it,
      something that even the doctor does not know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And which you do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded, and he looked nettled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you want me to tell you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why Mr. Stretton came down here to live this lonely life?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached for his coffee and drank it with an air of
      discomfort and disapproval.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't tell you that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean you won't?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly."
    </p>
    <p>
      She bent her head over her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it would be better for him, for us both, if you
      told me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mellor stood up. He liked neither inquisitive people nor
      spoilt children, but as he looked down at Jessie Viner's
      bent head and her hands calmly sewing he felt that she was
      neither a busybody nor a spoilt child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should require a very good reason."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps I can give it you," she said. "I'll see."
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose, put her work on the table, crossed the room to
      the window, and lifting the edge of the curtain ever so
      little, looked out into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you mind turning down the lamp, Dr. Mellor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He did so. He was growing interested, curious, and then she
      beckoned him to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be careful. Just hold aside the edge of the curtain and
      tell me what you see."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mellor took her place. The moon was up, and he could see
      the strip of garden, the palings of the fence, and on the
      other side of the lane an old and overgrown thorn hedge
      black and almost leafless in the moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He told her what he saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing else?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing against the hedge?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something which looks like an old tree stump."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think it is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew back from the window and looked at her with a very
      different expression on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. "John Stretton. Every night now; sometimes for
      an hour or more."
    </p>
    <p>
      His lips puckered themselves as though he were about to
      whistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are afraid of him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She assured him in a very gentle voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, I am not in the least afraid of him, but for him.
      Do you understand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned up the lamp, and Mellor pulled out his pipe and
      pouch. He went and stood by the fire and crammed tobacco
      into the bowl of his pipe. A vase of spills stood on the
      mantelpiece; he took one, lit it at the fire, and held the
      flame to the tobacco.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite sure you are not afraid of him?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had gone back to her chair and her sewing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite sure, but for him. Perhaps you can guess what brings
      him there on a cold night like this, just to look at that
      window. He has never said anything to me, but I know. He
      has some reason for not saying anything. Of course, I could
      ask him, but don't you think--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyes to Mellor's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But don't you think that it ought to come from him, and
      yet, that if I knew, I might help him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was leaning against the mantelpiece and staring at the
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because--oh, well, if you know what it is, don't you think
      you can tell me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do know," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he glanced at her quickly and with great kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is nothing shameful. But if I tell you I am putting a
      very grave responsibility upon you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I accept it," she said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Mellor told her all that he knew, sitting by the fire
      and smoking his pipe while she went on with her sewing. He
      was not a man of any eloquence, hard workers usually are
      not, but his plain and human telling of Stretton's tale
      made its details more vivid to her. She could see it all as
      Rollin Beal had seen it, appreciated the pity of it, the
      fate of a brave man whose scar carried not honour but a
      curse. Mellor was very emphatic on the question of
      cowardice and courage; he quoted Rollin Beal; there had
      never been any suggestion of cowardice; Stretton had been
      brave, brave to the edge of disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After all," he said, "it requires some courage for a man
      to get on his feet again after a knock-down blow like that,
      and it takes some character to live alone on the edge of
      Mascall's Wood. It seems to have been his wish, a sort of
      inspiration--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think he was right," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      A smile followed the sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how men suffer! He did not foresee--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mellor glanced at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You! No. But then, how could he? And, after all, there was
      luck in it. Now you know as much as I do, and I think it
      explains--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyes to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Dr. Mellor. I shall be always very grateful to
      you. It explains everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat in silence for half a minute, biting hard at the
      stem of his pipe. He felt that there was something more to
      be said, something which was not easy, but he knew that he
      ought not to shirk it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Probably what worries him is not only what has happened,
      but the thought that he ought not to marry."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jess went on with her sewing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. What do you think, Dr. Mellor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He took some time to answer her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Viner," he said, "we are learning a good deal more
      about ourselves in these days. There is a thing we call
      disharmony. It simply means that a man or a woman has not
      got in life what he or she has a natural need of.
      Repression. No human outlet, no chance of being yourself,
      or, rather, better than yourself, no chance of spending all
      the fine stuff that is in you. None of us are quite sane
      while we are suffering from some great disharmony."
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a movement of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So someone might take away that disharmony. You are in
      favour of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the right person," he said, and his blue eyes smiled at
      her over the bowl of his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>

    </h1>
    <h1>
      THE LURE OF THE LAMP
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mellor was too big-hearted a man to picture John Stretton
      as a sentimental and unvirile thing hesitating for hours
      outside a lighted window. He had known what it was to be
      lonely and hot-blooded in his London days when a man was
      too poor or too young to marry. In Stretton's case the
      repression was self-imposed, but none the less real for
      that. It is the sensitive man who suffers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither Mellor nor Jessie Viner knew that poor Stretton's
      fight had been made more difficult by a young woman out for
      adventure. To Mellor the solution of the affair seemed so
      simple that he was tempted to go up to Mascall's Wood and
      deal bluntly and beneficially with Stretton's dumbness. He
      reproached himself a little for not having pushed in
      earlier and made it his affair to help this other man, for
      as he put it to himself, "How much we miss by being too
      busy, or thinking ourselves too busy." But on further
      reflection he chose not to interfere, thinking it best to
      leave it to the woman, and in this he was fortunately wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Stretton had gone back to work; he was making another
      fight of it, doggedly, and with his eyes once more on the
      horizon and some ultimate patch of light in the sky. Two
      months ago he had ordered a number of fruit trees, and when
      a wagon brought them up from Kingsbury Station he could not
      let the trees die. He had to dig planting pits, plant and
      stake them, and the work kept him busy for days. It was
      visible to Jess from the window at the end of the long
      landing on the stairs of Romans Farm, and as she went to
      and fro from the old people's room she would pause there
      and watch him. His figure was very distant and yet she felt
      him more near.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her most vivid and intimate thought of him was of a man who
      could work all day and then come down at night just to look
      at a lighted window. It seemed to kindle a little flame in
      her heart. She loved him more not less because of his
      shipwreck and his sufferings.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that Mellor had told her had deepened her compassion
      and given her a boldness in pitying him. She felt that
      Stretton would get no farther than the outside of that
      lighted window unless she opened the lattice.
    </p>
    <p>
      In doing the thing she did Jessie Viner was laying no trap
      for him, but trying to open a window into his silence. She
      had considered it all with heart and head, and when she
      turned out the lamp next evening and left the curtains
      undrawn, she knew that if he came he would see the play of
      the firelight, no more and no less. He would think the room
      empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was her lure. She placed a chair at the side of the
      window; the curtain screened her, yet the catch of the
      lattice was within reach of her hand. The firelight filled
      the room with varying lights and shadows, but the outer
      world beyond the window was a great blackness. There was
      much cloud in the sky, and the moon had not yet risen.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat and waited. She had no qualms of conscience in
      laying this ambush for him. She was giving him his
      opportunity, choosing the place and time for him as a lover
      might have chosen them. The seemingly unexpected may be a
      key in the hand of impulse. There was nothing but a little
      silence between them, and a few words from him would break
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she had imagined it might happen, so it happened. He was
      lured by the play of the firelight in that seemingly empty
      room. He saw the lighted window above, the almost darkened
      casements below, the window of the room where he had sat
      watching her at her work. It was full of her imagined
      presence. He had begun to love her in that room, and all
      its associations were sacred.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slipped over the fence and along the grass path till he
      reached the window. He put his face close to the glass. He
      could see the fire burning, the dim outlines of the
      furniture, something which looked very like her work-basket
      on the table. He was lost in the realization of his love
      for her, its yearning, its depth, its seeming hopelessness.
      He did not see a hand steal out towards the catch of the
      lattice, for his gaze went beyond it into the mystical
      distances of the lights and shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the lattice opened he was so astonished, so
      self-betrayed, that he remained quite still.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who's that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood there, leaning slightly out into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You!" she said. And then: "I thought it was a tramp or a
      gipsy. I was sitting here, thinking, and I saw a face."
    </p>
    <p>
      He managed to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry. I'd heard your father and mother were ill. The
      boy told me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt that he was trying to smuggle in some explanation
      of his coming to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, they are better, but still upstairs. I expect you
      thought--I mean, you did not want to disturb anybody--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained inarticulate. Presently he said: "I am glad
      they are better."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gently she tightened her hold on the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in. Dr. Mellor will be here now at any minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still so confused and so eager to give some sort of
      natural complexion to the affair that he could not refuse
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be in the way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ought not to be such a stranger," she said, "that I
      can't leave you alone for five minutes with your pipe. Go
      round to the front door. I'll unbolt it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went, and she closed the lattice. She found him standing
      in the porch holding his hat in his hands and looking
      dejected and rigid. She smiled at him, a smile that was
      like the touch of a hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had him seated by the fire, and she did not light the
      lamp, for those fitful and subdued flames were more in
      sympathy with her conspiring thoughts. He had got to tell
      her all that Mellor had told her. She could create the
      atmosphere for such a telling, win him towards it and make
      the confession mysteriously easy, but her love had its
      pride and its respect for his silence, and the initiative
      lay with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you finished the new buildings yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No, he had not finished them. He sat on the edge of his
      chair and stared at the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We thought that you must be so busy on them that you had
      forgotten us."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a man's opening here, and he shirked it. He felt in
      his pocket for his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, do smoke," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat, filling his pipe, and she rose and took a spill
      from the vase and lit it at the fire. She held it out to
      him, and in taking it his fingers touched hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad you smoke."
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave her a quick, restive glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it soothes the beast."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does it need soothing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, sometimes."
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a knocking on the floor above, and Jess rose
      from her footstool.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They want me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please go."
    </p>
    <p>
      She went, and he watched her from the fireside to the door,
      and his eyes filled with a great yearning directly her back
      was turned. He listened to her footsteps on the stairs and
      in the room above. Happy people to be nursed by her! He got
      up and walked softly about the room; he touched her chair,
      her workbasket, as though he touched her in touching them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He picked up the half-burned spill which she had held for a
      moment, a flake of black ash fell from it upon the
      hearthstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If only I could," he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fancied that he heard her returning, and he hid the
      twist of paper in his pocket. No; she was still up there;
      he heard the sound of voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down and stared at the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't," he thought; "it isn't fair to her. What would
      she think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He suffered. He felt, somehow, that he was in a false
      position, that he was a bungling and a disastrous fool even
      to have come to the window. Did she suspect? Did she know
      that he came, night after night, to look at that window? He
      fell into one of those absurd and self-accusing panics to
      which sensitive men are liable. He got up with the idea of
      going before she returned. Then he thought that he heard
      her on the stairs and saw himself caught in an act of
      cowardice. He sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One has only to be natural," he reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was coming down, leaving her mother sitting up and
      knitting, and her father with his spectacles on his nose
      and a book under his chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who's that downstairs," Mrs. Mary had asked, "the doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Mr. Stretton. He came to inquire for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mr. Stretton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Make him stay to supper," her father had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she returned she found Stretton sitting well back in
      his chair with his feet on the fender. She was struck by
      his appearance of ease, of relaxation, and yet she detected
      something wilful in it, an attitude painfully assumed. He
      looked up at her with an assumption of casual candour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, how are they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's good. It's a beastly thing, 'flu."
    </p>
    <p>
      She resumed her place on the footstool, her hands clasped
      about her knees. She had an immediate feeling that he was
      slipping away from her, that the real man had fled out of
      the house in a panic, leaving behind a conventional shell.
      His awkwardness had disappeared, but she would have felt
      very much happier with it than with this stultifying
      composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      His cult of the "natural" led him to talk to her about the
      things which were supposed to interest him, fruit-growing
      and bee farming, and she accepted the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She realized that his self-control and his reticence were
      stronger than she had thought. He was not the sort of man
      who dissolved easily into a stew of self-pity, and she
      liked him the better for it. Meanwhile she had to suffer
      his hiding behind beehives and fruit punnets, and eluding
      her round pyramids and standards. He described to her a
      pamphlet he had been reading on the curing of English-grown
      tobacco.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the Revenue people who make it impossible," he
      asserted; "if there is one thing I hate it is the official
      mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      She agreed, but she thought it was better than the
      contemporary State-school mind and the modern cheap-jack
      attitude towards life.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the while she was thinking: "He will never tell me.
      But he must tell me some day and somehow. It must come from
      him, not from me."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mellor arrived, tired yet indulgent, he found Stretton
      knocking out his pipe and preparing to walk back to
      Mascall's Wood. He met the doctor with the impartial
      friendliness of a man who had nothing at the back of his
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid you are being overworked, doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear sir, my job can't be compressed into the trade
      union can."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is only the fool's work or the machine work that can be
      treated in that way. I hope I shan't add to your labours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope not. That cottage of yours is too far off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True. I just walked down to ask after Mr. and Mrs. Viner.
      I must be getting back or my dog will be howling the house
      down."
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled at Jess, a quick, errant smile, and picked up his
      hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night, Miss Viner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mellor nodded at Stretton, a "don't mind me" sort of nod,
      and went with most human discretion to warm his hands at
      the fire. His big back seemed to fill the fireplace, and
      behind it he had hopes that this romance was moving with
      happy inevitableness towards good nights spoken at
      half-darkened doorways. But it was not. He heard Stretton's
      voice, cheerful and casual:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please don't bother, Miss Viner; I'll let myself out."
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned from the hall, and for a moment she avoided
      Mellor's eyes. Then she looked up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How hard some men are on themselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only the best men," he said.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h1>
      SNOW
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Three days later snow came to Burnt Heath. It began to fall
      in the night, silently and secretly, with no wind to drive
      it against the windows, and in the morning the whole world
      was white. It lay on the hedges and ribbing the boughs of
      the apple trees, and all the hillsides were a-dazzle with
      it as the sun rose. For the clouds which had spread it were
      passing, hull down, like great galleons sailing into the
      west. Blue sky came out of the north, a clear, still,
      windless sky with the silence of the snow below it. Robins
      twittered and came boldly to the doors and windows. In the
      byres and yards the beasts sent up a white steam. Every
      roof and stack was white, and even the gates had a capping
      of snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      About nine o'clock that highly intelligent youth Sam
      Rugglesworth opened the back door of Romans Farm and
      appeared in the kitchen carrying a jug. He had failed to
      kick the snow off his boots, and cakes of it came off on
      the red-tiled floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'E don't want it this morning--Stretton, I mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jess had cleared the breakfast things away and was making
      pastry, her flour-dusted forearms deep in a brown basin.
      The sleeves of her pink linen blouse were turned up above
      her elbows. She looked at Sam, at the snow on the floor,
      and at the jug which he set down on the table. The jug was
      full.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have forgotten two things--to brush your boots and to
      shut the door."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's more than likely," said the lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Stretton does not want his milk?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'E's in bed. 'E looked a bit silly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean he is ill?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you have brought the milk back!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, 'e was in bed, 'e didn't seem to 'ave no use for
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You idiot!" she said, and then growing rather pink for no
      reason that Sam could see, she told him to go home and
      fetch his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rugglesworth was always glad of an excuse to come up
      to the farm, seeing that usually she brought away more than
      she took to it. She was typical of her class: she
      chattered, she flattered, she pilfered if she had an
      opportunity, she was a sycophant, and wholesomely afraid of
      Mrs. Mary. She was full of valiant boastings behind the
      backs of the Viner women: "I says to her, I says, I ain't
      going to be put upon. We are all ladies these days, I
      says." But in Romans Farm she was always servile and
      unctuous, just for what she could get out of it, and she
      always got less than she wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rugglesworth found Jess cloaked but bareheaded, and
      ready to take to the snow with a basket and a jug.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look after the house for an hour, please, Mrs.
      Rugglesworth; I have to go out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lor', miss, in the snow! Shall I be going on with the
      cooking for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She bustled about, putting on the clean apron she had
      brought with her. In Mrs. Rugglesworth's mind a white apron
      and plenty of soft soap covered every deficiency and eased
      every problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a joint to cook. You can leave the pastry. I
      shall be back in an hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jess went out, and a moment later Mrs. Rugglesworth made an
      expedition up to the stairs to the landing window which
      overlooked the heath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's going up to Mascall's! To play the ministerin'
      angel! Well, I wouldn't let a girl of mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      With characteristic niceness she went and knocked at the
      Viners' bedroom door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I get you anything, ma'm? Miss Jess has gone up to Mr.
      Stretton's."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mary's voice answered her:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I couldn't go myself, so I asked Miss Jess to go. Look
      after the kitchen, please, Mrs. Rugglesworth."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rugglesworth went, conscious, as usual, of a nasty
      feeling of inferiority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jess found the snow crisp and frozen under a clear blue
      sky; the furze bushes, the thorns and the old yews crusted
      with whiteness, nor was there any break in the white sheet
      until the red trunks and the dark tops of the Scots firs
      and the spruces caught the sunlight. She followed the lad's
      footprints, her breath making a little silver cloud in the
      keen air. What more could youth and love desire on such a
      winter morning? Never for a moment did her impulse look
      back. It was as though God had given it to her and she knew
      that it was good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam Rugglesworth's footprints led up to the blue gate in
      the snow-covered hedge. She noticed that there was no smoke
      coming from the chimney. At the door she set down her jug
      and basket, her face faintly flushed with the inward glow
      of her thoughts and of her hastening over the snow. The
      door was unlocked, and as Jess opened it she felt that it
      was more than the door of the cottage, rather the gate of a
      man's reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      "John?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an interval of silence, and then a voice answered
      from the sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who's that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jess," she said. "Sam says you are ill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I don't know what it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm coming in," she warned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited a few seconds for that challenge of hers to be
      taken up, but when he remained silent she became the woman
      in possession. He had rigged up his camp bed in the
      sitting-room with the idea of being nearer to his supplies
      and to the kitchen fire, but he had felt too ill to leave
      his bed that morning. Picking up her basket and jug, Jess
      made her way into the kitchen. She could see the foot of
      Stretton's camp bed, with Paul curled up on the foot of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jess was conscious of a moment's hesitation, as though her
      heart had dropped a beat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I come in, John?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he said, "come in, if you will."
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice suggested helplessness, a kind of wondering
      resignation. He was lying with the clothes pulled up to his
      chin, and he was shivering, and he had a patch of redness
      on either cheek. The raw cold of the room struck her, and
      she noticed half a glass of milk and a plate of dry
      biscuits on the chair beside the bed. His eyes looked at
      her without a question, without a protest, helplessly yet
      attentively, like the eyes of a very young child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, you have no fire!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved his head on the pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I felt--too--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank God I came," she said. "You ought to have sent us
      word."
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw off her cloak and got to work. And he lay there,
      looking at her with eyes of wonder yet of acceptance. She
      laid a hand on his forehead, felt his pulse, and taking the
      little silvered case of a thermometer from her pocket, she
      slipped the glass bulb under his tongue. Paul, suddenly
      interested, descended from the bed and followed her into
      the kitchen, and realizing that the dog was hungry she
      found him a bone. The kitchen fire needed lighting, and she
      began to look about her for coal and wood. A digression
      into the sitting-room and a glance at the thermometer
      brought her intent and ministering eyes back to Stretton's
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought so," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got a temperature?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think you have!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He accepted her verdict, and when she began to move about
      the room his eyes followed her with a fascinated
      brightness. The inward struggle had ceased in him, he
      surrendered himself into her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jess, my head aches."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was back at once and bending over him with a strange
      glamour upon her face. The man in him had called to her; he
      had uttered his first cry of human acceptance and appeal,
      and the woman in her was thrilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does it, John? We'll see to that."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had brought some aspirin tablets with her, and she gave
      him two with some milk to drink, supporting his head and
      holding the glass for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now keep warm. Leave everything to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She arranged the bedclothes and turned to other labours.
      There were two fires to be laid and lit and coal to be
      brought in from one of the outhouses, and Stretton could
      watch her as she knelt in front of the grate, the winter
      sunlight shining in upon her russet head, her pink blouse,
      white throat and forearms. His aching, feverish head was
      full of this beneficent impression of her, and his mood was
      one of feeling and not of thought. He was conscious of her
      as a dear, rescuing presence, something vaguely wonderful
      which had no need to crystallize into words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jess went to wash her hands and to warm up some milk, and
      she brought it him in a cup. He looked at it before
      drinking, with a sort of dreamy astonishment as though this
      bit of white china was as amazing as her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's good."
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had drunk a little she placed the cup on the chair
      beside the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't stay near me," he said; "you'll catch it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ought to have caught it long ago if I were going to. Now
      you will be all right for a while. I must run down to the
      farm and send for Dr. Mellor. I shall be back or I will
      send someone up before the fires need seeing to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are coming back?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am giving you a lot of trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not noticed it yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, nodded at him, and turned to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jess?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I have the blind down?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She lowered it and came back to the bed as though she had
      forgotten something.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't worry about anything. Do you want me to send a
      message to anyone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he said with an air of drowsy contentment, "no, Jess,
      thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was to and fro again during the morning, and going in
      softly found him asleep. His fire needed mending, and she
      knelt down and put coal on lump by lump, using her fingers
      so that she should make no noise. But the perfume of her
      presence must have penetrated into his brain, for he woke
      up and lay watching her. He did not move or speak, and it
      was not till she rose from her knees and turned to the bed
      that she realized that he was awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      "John, I thought you were asleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with that helpless attentiveness and the
      eyes of a very young child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was. What time is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About half-past eleven."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been back to the farm?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It has been snowing, hasn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the night, yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ought not to have come up again. You ought to have
      sent a woman, or someone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I sent myself. There is no one else fit to send."
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A nurse should be self-confident. Now what about a little
      more milk?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just what you think right, Jess."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at him with indulgent tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are going to be a good patient. Now go to sleep
      again."
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed his eyes as though he found it easy to obey.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that Jess went out into the sunlight and the snow.
      She took Paul with her, Paul who had never before seen such
      strange white stuff, and between them they went mad
      together, for Jess was very happy. They romped together
      down towards Romans Farm, Jess making balls of snow and
      throwing them at Paul, while the dog raced round and round,
      sending up a flurry of snow. For a great happiness finds
      its first expression in the joy of movement; the deeper
      inward glow follows after, and the limbs relax and the eyes
      fill with thought. Jess had come to this other mood before
      they reached the farm, and the dog grew sober in sympathy.
      "How vile of us," she said to him, "when he is ill up
      there!" But she could not regret it, nor John's aching
      head, nor the sudden rift in his stoicism, nor her own
      secret exultation. And a sudden cautiousness took
      possession of her in the midst of that white landscape,
      even though she laughed at it and at herself. "Snow may be
      dangerous, doggie. Supposing I put my foot in a rabbit hole
      and sprained my ankle! What a disaster!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not happen, and she went in and up to her people's
      room where Thomas Viner and Mary Viner did not look at her
      too closely, but felt the stir and the quick breathing life
      that were in her. She stood by the window in the full
      winter sunlight looking out over the white hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there anything I can do for you dear people?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice had a rich gentleness. And what could one say to
      a young woman whose voice came down out of heaven?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I'll get up after tea," said her mother; "you'll
      want help. I have been letting myself be lazy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll be here to help you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense. That tonic of Mellor's has made me feel like a
      young woman. And I want to keep my eyes on Sally
      Rugglesworth. She's a cheap creature."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas Viner was pretending to read his book.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The doctor ought to be here soon," he observed; "it seems
      to me that if we could get Mr. Stretton moved--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so," said his wife; "but it might be dangerous."
    </p>
    <p>
      They knew that youth has its perils, anyway, but that youth
      has the heart to meet them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mellor arrived late in the afternoon. He left his car in
      the lane and walked straight up over the heath after a few
      words with the Viners, and he went alone. But Jess had told
      him that she would be following him, and Mellor had glanced
      at her with an air of understanding. He had been struck by
      her serenity and by a kind of determined and active
      happiness which was in possession of some great thing and
      had no thought of surrendering it. Her self-consciousness
      was full and complete and without doubts and disharmonies.
      She was alone with her one vivid inspiration, and she would
      walk past other people as though they had no existence for
      her. Life was hers, and she was right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mellor found Stretton awake and flushed with high fever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a shame to drag you all the way up here, doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's nothing of the kind; it's my job. Now, my friend, let
      us have a look at you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went very carefully over Stretton, and at the end of his
      examination he pulled a chair up beside the fire. It needed
      more coal, and he picked up the tongs and extracted several
      lumps from the coal-box. Stretton lay and watched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's 'flu, I suppose, doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is. You will have to have a nurse, my lad. The Viners
      suggested having you taken down to the farm, but I don't
      think it is quite safe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I don't want a nurse," said Stretton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear chap, it is not a question of what you want; it is
      a matter of necessity. I may have to keep you in bed for a
      week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't the boy look after me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That living proof of the silly theory of equality! I don't
      think so. You must have a nurse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want a nurse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must see if I can find one. Perhaps--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doctor, I'd rather--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be quiet, my dear chap. Hallo, here's Miss Viner; she may
      be able to suggest something."
    </p>
    <p>
      He met Jess at the door and made a sign to her to turn into
      the kitchen. He closed the door and pretended to warm his
      hands at the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's influenza. He must have a nurse, or at least someone
      to look in frequently."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He refuses to have a nurse, but I told him that he will
      have to have one. I suggest--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned and looked at her. His eyes were kind and full of
      shrewdness. "It seems to me," they said, "that this rests
      between you and him. In a sense it is your right, and I
      recognize it. Will you take it on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked out of the window, smiling faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm quite capable. I had some training during the war. I
      could come to and fro."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So far as I am concerned that settles it," he said. "But I
      am thinking--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Mellor, I think this chance was sent to me, to us
      both. God knows I'm not gloating over his helplessness, but
      I do thank God for it. It is more than nursing that he
      needs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I like your honesty," he said, "and your courage. That man
      is lucky."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a short silence between them. Then he asked her a
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I tell him, or will you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will," she said, going towards the door with something
      sacrificial in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      So John Stretton ceased to fight and yet he had not
      surrendered. A man who is ill accepts all that happens in
      the immediate world about him as an infant accepts his
      food. He is a little insensitive, a little drowsy, more of
      a body and less of a soul. And he is in a mood to have some
      soft presence near him, especially if his life has been
      lonely and the cry of his heart has been for comradeship
      and sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow it seemed so supremely natural. At least Jess made
      it seem natural. She just came into the room and did
      things, without explaining why she did them, or why there
      was no one else to do them, and in a day the whole of him
      accepted her and made no quarrel of it. It was as though
      the subconscious part of him was dominant, and knowing by
      instinct what was good and pleasant and natural, stretched
      itself in the sunlight and asked no questions. While the
      fever was on him he asked no questions, either of himself
      or of her. He lay in the lap of life and looked up at her
      as a child looks at its mother. He was conscious sometimes
      of great wonder, and always of gratitude, but the immediate
      future was vague and misty. He did not want to worry about
      anything, but just to be there and feel that he had some
      reason for being extraordinarily happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      These footsteps in the snow linked up the cottage and
      Romans Farm, making a chain across the whiteness of the
      heath. Jess followed that path several times each day,
      though young Rugglesworth went up early each morning and
      tackled some of the rougher work. It was Jess who kept the
      fires alight, who fed him, and lit the lamp at dusk, and
      made up the fire for the night, and no one questioned the
      inevitableness of what she did. There was one moment in the
      sitting-room at Romans Farm when old Viner and his wife
      looked at each other across the table with eyes which
      sought faith and understanding. Old Viner had been up to
      Mascall's and had seen Stretton, a Stretton who was
      beginning to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose she's up there," said Jess's father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shell be back any minute. I'm not worrying, Tom."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas Viner stirred his tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's a good girl. Besides, the lad had a talk with me.
      He's straight. He has been straighter than either you or I
      guessed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Viner looked at her husband's face as she might have
      looked at the face of a solid and reliable clock. He had
      ticked out the years faithfully, and she had complete
      confidence in his sense of rhythm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Provided there is no gossip, Tom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gossip!" said he. "If Adam and Eve had listened to gossip
      where would you and I be, old girl?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Jess came in with a little powdering of snow in
      her hair, and a shine in her eyes that made her parents
      look at their plates.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's normal," she said, and sat down with her back to the
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's good. Seems it is snowing again," her father
      observed with a glance at her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Poor Dr. Mellor! 'Damn the snow,' he said, 'how am I
      to get round!' He is busier than ever. People wait for him
      and waylay him in the lanes. He was going back to see
      Colonel Copredy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So they have got it at Ottways?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      While Jess drank her tea Mellor was walking up the drive to
      Ottways and wishing the red house in some other county.
      There were houses which he disliked entering, and Ottways
      was one of them, for it was querulous and exacting whenever
      sickness entered it. Mellor was pulling off his gloves in
      the hall when Isobel Copredy came down the stairs with an
      ill-tempered look on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have been expecting you all day, doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a reproof and Mellor was in no mood to be reproved
      by a young woman who was less than half his age.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very busy, Miss Copredy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We saw your car pass the house quite two hours ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw his gloves on the table and moved towards the
      stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so. I have to see someone on Burnt Heath, and I make
      sure of doing that by daylight."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him a queer look and became suddenly suave and
      soothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. We are all of us exacting. One gets worried,
      you know. Is it our landlord who is ill?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      She preceded him up the stairs, and Mellor had ceased
      almost to be aware of her. He had so many other things to
      think of.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Influenza, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he said mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a nuisance for you, having an isolated patient like
      that."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was roused by this personal touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it is worse for the patient. How long has Colonel
      Copredy been ill?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since yesterday," she said, opening the door of her
      father's room, but remaining on the landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mellor entered, and she closed the door after him and went
      slowly down the stairs. The news had piqued her and there
      was anger in her eyes. Many things occurred to her,
      thoughts prompted by malice, curiosity, the irrepressible
      spirit of adventure and interference that was in her. She
      smiled, but her smile had a sharp edge to it. "Who is
      looking after him?" she thought. "Is there anyone looking
      after him?" A suggestive possibility occurred to her, and
      she frowned. She visualized a situation, a rather provoking
      and complex situation. She was intrigued by it. She saw the
      same human chances in the picture which Jessie Viner had
      seen, but she saw them with different eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll go up there--to-morrow," she decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the danger when Stretton began to think. The soul
      of him was no longer half asleep in a sick body, and he
      came back to the waking world of doubt and of desire. Yet
      it was a different world, for Jess had made it different,
      and in realizing its newness he had moments of generous
      panic. Why had she come to him like this, and what did her
      coming mean to her and to himself? What would other people
      think of it? What did Thomas and Mary Viner think of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      For he could not be sure that she cared, for the more
      deeply a man loves the less selfishly is he absorbed in the
      assurance of his own vanity. Had she done this out of
      kindness, out of sheer goodness of heart? Had he been a
      cynic or less involved in the passionate solution of the
      problem he would have found little difficulty in
      discovering an answer. But what he did know was that he
      wanted her more than ever, not only for her gracious and
      shapely youth, for her arms, and lips, and throat and eyes,
      but for the dear spirit of her, her courage, her
      cleverness, her wholesome common sense. She was the very
      heart of the green world. And so he lay there, thinking and
      thinking, while the inevitable decision formed in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supposing he had allowed her to compromise herself?
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought frightened him, but his fear was generous and
      chivalrous, the gesture of a man who rushes to arms in
      passionate defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He became dominated by this fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      He realized that he would have to tell her, and tell her
      everything, and he was astonished to find that he was much
      less afraid of telling her than he had been ten days ago.
      What had seemed impossible then had become inevitable now.
      He still feared it not a little, but not with the same kind
      of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beal's words kept recurring to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The woman to whom you can tell anything is the woman who
      will understand, because she loves."
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it true? He lay and looked out of the window, and it
      seemed to him that the sky had broadened, that the winter
      was passing and that the spring was near. He had moments of
      exultation, wonder, and happy incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If she was not repelled by my sick body," he thought,
      "would that other thing repel her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It never occurred to him to suspect that she knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      But chiefly he feared that sinisterly innocent affair with
      Isobel Copredy. Would Jess understand it? Would she take
      his word against that of another woman? Sex is such a thing
      of suspicions and of passionate prejudices, of intimate
      tendernesses and disgusts. Would she understand that he had
      been tortured, tempted, and yet won such a victory as few
      men win? If she could not understand that then the issue
      would be hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had got to tell her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew now that it was inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he did not know was that Jess herself had made it
      deliberately inevitable, that she had planted the seed and
      had watched the plant's growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had more than a feeling that Stretton's reserve was
      wearing very thin, that he was on the edge of the great
      surrender. He looked at her differently, and without
      realizing that as his attitude of mind to her had changed,
      his face had changed with it. He had ceased to be reserved
      and difficult. Before he had seemed always in the shadow;
      now he was in the sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      But down at Ottways on that winter afternoon Isobel Copredy
      was pinning on a green hat that cocked itself audaciously
      on her red head like the hat of a bravo. There were moments
      when she suggested some young "ruffler" in a cloak and mask
      out for sword and dagger work. Old Copredy was ill, rather
      desperately ill, breathing fast and hard, with pinched nose
      and blue cheek bones, and when his daughter drifted in and
      stood beside his bed he could not tell her that he was
      afraid of dying. He was a lonely old devil, so lonely that
      he welcomed the coming of a trained nurse whom Mellor had
      wired for from London.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going out for some fresh air."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it will do you good. I think I'm a little better."
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw nothing pathetic in his poor lean old head and
      straining eyes, the head of an old man panting in his race
      from death, the pursuer. She went down the stairs and out
      into the avenue where the snow had turned into mud and
      slush. She was interested in another man, a young man whom
      she meant to worry and provoke and torture until he fell to
      playing with her as she pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      She left Ottways about half-past three, for it was in her
      mind to break in upon Stretton about dusk, and if she found
      him alone to take possession of the cottage as she had done
      on that day of rain and sunlight in June. She would lock
      the door, make tea, and amuse herself with pretending to be
      a pardoning angel. From Ottways to Mascall's Wood was an
      hour's walk, and about the time that Isobel left Ottways,
      Jessie Viner was crossing the heath on her way to
      Stretton's cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      There may have been something significant in the fact that
      Stretton had got up and shaved himself, but he was back in
      bed when Jess entered the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Getting up, even for half an hour, had tired him, but if
      the body of him was tired the other part of him was not.
      She was struck by the change in him. She was aware of his
      eyes fixed on her with a wide and steady brightness. They
      made her think of open windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ready for your tea?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I'm beginning to be hungry. Will you have tea with
      me, Jess?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. I'll go and get it ready. What about some
      buttered toast?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you will be responsible to Mellor!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that's moral cowardice!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His face seemed to grow intensely pale, but with the pallor
      of white light.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I'm not a moral coward."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never meant that," she said quickly, making a movement
      towards the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He called after her, and she knew by his voice that the
      moment had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jess, please leave the door open."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to talk to you. Can you hear me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't stop getting the tea ready. I like to hear you
      moving about in there."
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood very still a moment, looking towards the door,
      and her face had the shine of love upon it. Then she turned
      to the fire, threw some dry wood on it, and put the kettle
      on to boil.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jess," said his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, John."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I tell you something? I mean, I must tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may tell me anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is why I came here. I have been wanting to tell you for
      months, but I couldn't. And there are other things."
    </p>
    <p>
      She took down the tray and began to collect the tea-things.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want you to tell me, John. I have been wanting you to
      tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you guessed there was--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me," she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to cut the bread for making toast, but she saw
      that there was not enough fire for it, yet she set herself
      to the pretence of making it, for what did such a trifle
      matter! His voice was in her ears, urgent and deep and
      inspired. She could picture him sitting up in bed, leaning
      forward a little, his face set towards this act of courage,
      his eyes bright and anxious. His words did not come easily,
      for a lover's words are like drops of blood pressed out of
      the heart of desire. She felt the sincerity in him, the
      straining, passionate sincerity. It seemed to reach out and
      touch her like an invisible spirit hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what I was," he said, "a sort of outcast. I had to
      begin all over again. I had a feeling that I should get
      healed here, but there was one thing I did not foresee."
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought she knew what that thing was, but she kept her
      eyes on the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The loneliness of it, John?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but more than that, someone else and you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a quick turn of the head. The unexpected had
      surprised her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
      His silence was the silence of struggle. She felt it and
      was gripped by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he told her. His words came faster now, as though
      he were in fierce haste to have done with it. She listened;
      she had gone pale, her eyes seemed to be turned inward; the
      bread on the fork was smoking and she did not notice it.
      His words kept beating and beating like the beats of a
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's true; I swear to you it's true. I never thought that
      a woman could be like that. I went mad; I nearly killed
      her, but even then she wouldn't leave me alone. She tried
      to murder my love for you. I got a gun one night and fired
      to frighten her, you remember the night when your father
      came up. I have not seen her since, but she wrote me a
      letter, a devil's letter. Then I thought that I would go
      away, that there was nothing left for me but to go away.
      But I found I couldn't, Jess, I couldn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      She bowed her head. She let the blackened bread fall off
      the fork on to the hearth-stone. There was silence. She
      remained quite still. Then, suddenly, she turned to the
      table and began to make a clatter with the tea-things.
      Movement and the homely wholesomeness of the noise steadied
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she heard his voice. It was like the voice of a man
      in anguish, imprisoned underground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jess, what are you thinking? Don't leave me, don't leave
      me--to her."
    </p>
    <p>
      She stifled a great sob of emotion, picked up the tray and
      carried it into the other room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm having tea with you, John. I'll--I'll never leave you,
      dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was aware of his white face in the dusk, a face of
      wonder, anguish and supreme joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jess! Oh, God bless you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She put down the tray. His arms were out. She knelt down
      and let him lean on her, his head upon her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      <a name="c31" id="c31">XXXI</a>
    </h1>
    <h1>
      TWO WOMEN
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It was Jess who heard that sound, the click of the latch of
      a gate, and it was followed by an interval of silence, a
      silence which should have been broken by another sound
      which never came.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Someone's there."
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to the window. She was still kneeling beside the
      bed, and Stretton's arm lay across her shoulders, his cheek
      almost touching hers. He too was looking at the window, and
      they saw the same thing, and saw it together, a face
      looking in at them, the face of Isobel Copredy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dusk was dimming the colours and turning the world to a
      level greyness, but her red hair and the hard blueness of
      her eyes were very vivid to both of them. She showed no
      shame and no embarrassment. She seemed to stand there like
      some fleshly, vigorous, common child staring in at a shop
      window, greedy, insolent and unshamable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jess felt Stretton's arm contract about her shoulders. Her
      own heart was beating hard and fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad," she said suddenly; but she did not tell him why
      she was glad.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose from her knees, and very deliberately she arranged
      his pillows and with an air of happy tenderness, an
      intimacy which she did not mean to be misread. She bent
      over him and smiled at that something in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you leave it to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Send her away," he said; "she's horrible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going to ask her in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jess."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was flushed now, shining, brilliant. She laid a supreme
      and triumphant hand upon his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She shall see. She shall have me as your answer, I am a
      woman and so is she."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you don't know her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "John, I think I do. I should know her without ever hearing
      her speak a word. Trust me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went out. There was buoyancy in her very movement, a
      triumphant and implacable confidence. She opened the
      cottage door and stood holding it open. She smiled at the
      other woman who was staring at her from the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please come in, Miss Copredy, I am making tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      Even then she did not know what that other woman would do
      or say, but she was ready for everything, and all the while
      she smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "John is much better. He has just been telling me--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was aware of the other's nipped nostrils and narrowing
      eyes. And then the flash came.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know, I suppose, that--"
    </p>
    <p>
      But something stopped her, rendered her inarticulate, a
      look of Jess's, quiet, calmly observant, travelling first
      downwards and then returning, to rest upon her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a look which any woman would have understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, I know. But it really does not matter now. I feel
      I ought to be rather sorry for you, Miss Copredy. You see,
      there are such different sorts of men. Won't you come in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She could feel the vibration of the other woman's body.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shut that door. I want to tell you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, there is no need to shut the door. Every door is
      open between John and me. I'm asking you to come in,
      because it simply does not matter whether you come in--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled. She was inspired; victorious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "John," she called, "Miss Copredy won't come in. Ask her to
      come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard, and the blind lover in him obeyed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Copredy, we are going to have tea. Let Jess bring you
      in."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not hear the other woman's answer, nor did Jess tell
      him what it was, for some vile things are best buried.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when she closed the door and came back to him she hid a
      wound, a little secret flow of blood, and yet the smart of
      it heightened her sense of his redemption.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was giving him sanctuary; she had put her own body
      between him and that other woman, and she wondered whether
      the man in him understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's gone! Oh, my dear, even the horrible things of life
      can be funny."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was overwrought, and sitting down beside his bed she
      broke into sudden laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did she say to you, Jess?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, nothing, nothing! Women need few words--when they deal
      with each other; but oh, my dear!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He did understand her. Sickness subtilizes a man, and
      Stretton's love was an inspiration. He seemed to see all
      round life and into the deeps of it; he felt things as he
      had never felt them before; he understood her laughter,
      that there was pain behind it, exquisite tears, perhaps a
      little tender doubting of his knowledge of her as a woman.
      It was she who had fought and protected, but now the very
      love in her needed protection, comforting, and somehow--he
      understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took one of her hands, held it very hard between the two
      of his, and then raised it to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall never make this up to you, but I will try."
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat with bowed head, strangely smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something has gone out of me, John."
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained very still, holding her hand, and looking out
      of the darkening window. His eyes had a steady fierceness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That something is in me," he said, "the most sacred thing
      in all the world. I have a great heart in me now, and such
      courage. Nothing can take it away, nothing shall ever take
      it away. You have killed my loneliness."
    </p>
    <p>
      She stole a look at him, and his face was transfigured.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm making love to you, Jess, and oh, my God, I can't help
      making love to you. I used to ask myself: 'Is it right?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Make love to me, John," she said softly; "have no fear."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned his head and sat looking at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no fear. It is not what is wrong or right, but what
      is. This is. It is the only real and great thing in the
      world. Do you know how much I love you, how much I want
      you, how wonderful I think you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not at all wonderful, John. I'm just--a woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised that hand of hers again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't that what a man asks for? Just a woman, you, the one
      woman? Why, life's all different. I know what I am and
      where I am, where I am going, where we are going. It's so
      simple. It's like turning on a light in a darkened room."
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat in silence for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      "John," she said presently, "we were going to have tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      They kissed suddenly, and she slipped away. She lit the
      lamp and drew the curtains, and rescued the kettle which
      was boiling itself empty. She seemed to linger out yonder
      just for the very joy of coming back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jess," he said, "I've been thinking."
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew up the table and sat down by the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you marry me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll marry you, John."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you wait for six months? Listen. I want to talk to
      Mellor and your father; they are straight men, good men. I
      want to prove myself; I want to be able to say to my own
      soul: 'That thing is never going to happen again. It can't
      happen.' Do you understand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I want to have the right to love you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who can take it away from you, John?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>

      SECURITY

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The winter passed and the spring came, and when John
      Stretton looked towards Romans Farm he saw a whiteness
      gathering about it, the blossom of its orchard trees. A
      little later the red-brown walls and roof of the old house
      sunk deeper and deeper into a mist of green. The growth of
      the year flowed round it secretly, joyously, with a
      mysterious stealth. Its windows looked through greenness at
      the soft distances of an English landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton's eyes were turned often to Romans Farm. He saw it
      in the early sunlight, at full noon, in the evening, and
      always it spoke to him of peace. Jessie Viner lived there,
      and Jessie Viner understood. She was his and yet not his,
      and this sense of waiting had for them both the mystery and
      the strangeness of the spring. Her presence there spoke to
      him of growth and hope, sunshine and soft rains, the
      singing of birds in the woodlands, the sense of summer
      waiting for to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Security, a most sweet feeling of security, that was what
      John Stretton discovered as the days grew longer. It was as
      though this country girl, so human and so wholesome, gave
      him that which he had lacked, self-completeness,
      self-expression, spiritual repose. He had a feeling that
      nothing evil could happen to him, that the understanding of
      the love made him invulnerable. To him she was so vivid, so
      convincing, so complete that she became a figure of
      healing, a proof of the essential goodness of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      He worked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had work seemed so good or so full of meaning. The
      zest of life had come back to him, the human wholesomeness
      of doing things and doing them with his own hands, not for
      himself, but for her. He had a comrade, a partner. The
      insurgent, restless "I" had become "we." He saw life
      growing and growing, and he understood that this growth
      could be natural and yet most shrewdly managed. It was a
      partnership, and in a partnership there are two voices, two
      hearts, two minds, and one purpose. He realized that he did
      not want her to be just like himself, but something
      delightfully different and yet his. Much suffering had
      driven the exacting, arrogant youth out of him. If she was
      to be his, he was to be hers. Their hands were never to
      fall apart, even when they differed. For differ they would.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was she who insisted on that, and he found something
      infinitely fresh and wholesome in her common sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even when I contradict you, John, remember I'll be loving
      you while I do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall not forget it," he said; "but the trouble will be
      that I shall feel that you are right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, you won't," she answered. "I should hate you if
      you were like that. I want a man. You want a woman.
      Contrasts make life interesting."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were very honest with each other. Their love was an
      out-of-door love which did not sit about on sofas,
      suffering provocation, the sniggering, giggling prurience
      of the vulgar. In many ways they were very modern; they
      discussed things with the idea of being fair to each other
      and of avoiding illusions and misunderstandings. They found
      that they differed about children. Stretton did not like
      children; he was quite frank about it, and being a
      sensitive man he had very good reasons for disliking them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you would like your own, mine?" she suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      He agreed that that was probable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," she told him, "one's own children are the only
      children that one does like. That's the real truth, but
      society is not honest enough to allow it. Children are a
      lot of trouble; they are not beautiful unless they are well
      washed and well loved and well smacked--when necessary. I
      know quite well why you don't like children."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" he asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because most of them come out of ugly, stupid homes, and
      because all that is bad in the home seems exaggerated in
      the child. You hate all that is cheap and ugly and loud and
      savage, and most children are that. But if we have children
      I shall take good care that ours are not. It is up to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yours couldn't be," he said gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor yours, John. But aren't we being rather bumptious?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he insisted; "we are looking at things squarely,
      honestly. When things go wrong nowadays people put it down
      to the system, or to capitalism, or to Bolshevism, anything
      but the real cause. It's because the world is so full of
      rotten, cheap materialism. Even the children get it. How
      can you expect them not to get it? It's what is inside us
      that matters. And it is so simple."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but it does not make any show, dear man. It doesn't
      give you silk stockings, and motor-cars, and all that."
    </p>
    <p>
      And they laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But most of their talk was of the life they would lead and
      the home they would live in. It was to be the cottage, even
      if the coming years saw it as a transfigured cottage; they
      were agreed upon that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if you get bored?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall never get bored."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be careful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jess," he said very seriously, "I don't think I shall. I'm
      too full of plans; I don't see the end of them. But what
      about you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at invisible distances.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm very strong. I'm most wickedly healthy. I don't think
      I have ever been bored or that I ever shall be. It's as
      though my body insisted on being happy, yet without
      thinking about it, because it finds things so good. It's
      nothing to boast about. I got it when I was born."
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew her to him and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wholesome, happy thing," he said; "I love you."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were full of plans for the future, and being happy
      people they had no schemes for reforming the world; they
      were content with their own affairs and so were not
      sociological busybodies. They were going to grow fruit, run
      a bee farm, and experiment with English-grown tobacco. They
      had a plan for taking over Romans Farm or working it in
      conjunction with Thomas Viner, and old Viner smiled at them
      and thought it might be managed. He was growing old, but
      not so old that he was deaf to new ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton had many talks with Thomas Viner, for in old Viner
      there was much of Jess. The daughter seemed to have
      inherited his warm heart and her supreme common sense from
      him. He had the faith of a mystic, but no illusions. He was
      the kindest of men, but like most workers who have had
      other workers under them, he was out of love with sloppy
      humanitarianism.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never be soft with your men," was one of his sayings; "you
      can't afford to trifle with ignorant people."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Stretton wondered whether there was any reason for any
      man being ignorant, old Viner gave him one of his shrewd
      looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the nature of the beast. Take men and study them.
      I've had to. Three will work hard, because it's in them;
      another three will do just as little as they damned well
      can; the other three will be bad or good, and it depends on
      whether they get with the bad three or the good three. It's
      a fact."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the socialists would say--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Socialism!" said old Viner with a kind of smiling scorn.
      "That's all paper stuff. I go by human nature."
    </p>
    <p>
      One day in April a part of Stow House appeared upon the
      heath, Car and his mother, both a little curious as to
      John's romance and viewing it from different angles. John
      had met them at Kingsbury station, and when in the car with
      him his mother wept a little. Carlyon was in the seat
      beside the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do hope you will be happy, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is going to make all the difference in the world to
      me," he told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her good nature saved her from being selfish, that and her
      passion for making a mystery of things. John's future wife
      was a mystery, a sentimental mystery, and Lavinia Stretton
      was dying to explore her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure Miss Viner is a lucky woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait till you see her," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      His calmness impressed Lavinia. It had the serenity of a
      supreme faith; it neither broke into raptures nor betrayed
      a shy complacency. He said that he was happy, and his
      mother felt that he was happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have had such trouble," she confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where? How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With your father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "About this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded mysteriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He would not play golf for a week. Men are ridiculous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I don't know," she said; "only that men do take things
      so strangely."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled. Sentimentalist that she was yet she had
      discovered, what most women discover, the absurd,
      incalculable, exasperating, lovable boy in man. He sulked,
      and he grew excited, he became rhetorical over the grocer's
      bill and solaced his penitence with some other piece of
      generosity. He saved odds and ends of string and
      sealing-wax, scolded because an electric light was left
      burning all night, and then bought his wife a new fur coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry," said the son.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it's nothing," she said; "he won two golf balls last
      Saturday. He sent you his love."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear old pater," said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he heard more of the affair from Car, and it appeared
      that Bartholomew Stretton's "old man" mood had been
      attacked and dispersed by the most unexpected of persons,
      Madge their sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Car laughed over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madge may have no mystery. She just shouts 'fore' and
      drives into you if you are a foozler and holding up the
      game. She drove slap into the gov'nor. 'Who's getting
      married, pater, you or John?' 'Well, if he likes her, it's
      all right, isn't it? It's his business.' 'Farmer's
      daughter! Well, if John is going to live a farmer's life,
      isn't that about the most sensible thing he could do? Now
      if he had wanted to marry a dying duck with fifty pairs of
      shoes and no shove in her, you might have groused! Besides,
      wasn't one of our grandmothers a farmer's daughter?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Car twinkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madge is like a fire-engine. She pumps cold water on you,
      but, after all, it is clean water."
    </p>
    <p>
      The pilgrimage was a success. Jess came to lunch at the
      cottage; in fact she had helped to prepare the lunch, and
      the whole party went down to Romans Farm for tea. Lavinia
      fell to Jess in the first quarter of an hour, sensing in
      the girl who was to be John's wife a happy yet wise
      warm-heartedness which is the most precious of dowries. She
      thought Jess a little old-fashioned, which was the highest
      praise she could bestow. Romans delighted her. She went
      about calling everything "sweet," and declaring that it had
      always been her dream to live in the country. With Mary
      Viner she did not walk so smoothly, but they treated each
      other with careful politeness. Thomas Viner she accepted
      with ease and pleasure. "Such a fine head," as she told
      John, "so rugged, you know, and wise. One of Nature's
      gentlemen."
    </p>
    <p>
      Car, the connoisseur, was amused. Jess was not his
      particular type; he liked something a little higher in the
      heel, "more of a powder-puff," as he would have expressed
      it, but he realized the woman in her. "She's rich and
      pleasant, a good fire to warm the hands of life at. John's
      no fool, though I don't believe he knows a brass bean about
      women."
    </p>
    <p>
      They returned to Esher, leaving an atmosphere of indulgent
      approval behind them, and able to reassure old Bartholomew
      as to John's sanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just the woman for him," said Car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bartholomew had a very great respect for Car's opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reginald has been down here. He's rather upset about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doesn't approve! Well, if you were to ask Reginald's wife
      what her views of marriage are, marriage with Reginald--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's their affair," said his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anyhow, I don't want to listen to the opinions of a
      bald-headed prig who couldn't help making any decent or
      indecent woman miserable. I should like to shut Reg up with
      a negress--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Car!" said his father, shocked, "your brother!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My brother," said Carlyon, "with a hard-boiled egg for a
      head."
    </p>
    <p>
      So the spring day went by, and the six months of John
      Stretton's self-imposed trial were falling rapidly like the
      last grains of sand in an hour-glass. The life of six
      months ago had a sense of distance; all the old
      disharmonies, the doubts, the horror of loneliness seemed
      more and more things of the past, memories that were
      growing dim, so dim that they appeared unreal. His feeling
      of security was complete. He wrote to Rollin Beal, and
      Beal's letter was a healer's blessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You say that it has happened as I said it would happen. My
      dear man, there is no vanity in my pleasure. When one loves
      one's work very dearly it is above vanity. There is
      something of awe, something of sacred pride in it. In our
      puppy stage we are tempted to yap, and I hope the wise
      smile at us indulgently. Bring her to see me some day. I
      suppose such a woman is the best proof of the fact that
      ideals do matter, and that they matter supremely."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretton began to feel that the sky was clear, that he was
      healed, that the leak in his brain was closed. He became
      more and more convinced that never again would he be swept
      by one of those savage storms. As the occultists would have
      put it: "His 'elemental' was chained. It no longer had any
      power to possess him." Jess had cast out his devil.

      Meanwhile his life became more and more intricately woven
      into the life of Romans Farm. He spent quite half his time
      there, and he sat with them at the table in the pleasant,
      shabby dining-room. He was one of them; he began to know
      almost every corner of the old house, the cool, dim dairy
      with its brown pans, the cellar which smelt of herbs and
      pastry and ale, the attics where apples were stored, the
      kitchen full of brass, copper and old oak. He was learning
      to milk, to look after the beasts, to manage a team of
      horses, how to sharpen the knives of a reaper, the hundred
      and one things that a man can learn on a farm. He saw the
      grass growing deep and full of shadows, the leaves
      spreading and turning the orchards into canopies of green.
      Jess taught him all that she knew about bees and fruit. In
      the spring evenings they would wander about the farm, over
      the heath, or in Stretton's wood, making plans, lovers who
      loved all things that grew. When dusk came they would
      return and light the lamp, and put their plans on paper.
      They delighted in making lists of things, trees, furniture,
      linen, books.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were very happy months, and at the end of June Jessie
      Viner and John Stretton were to be married.

    <h1>
      THE IRRESPONSIBLE MALE
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Yet there was one danger which John Stretton did not
      foresee, nor could he have been wise as to the event until
      the disastrous thing had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love can make a man vulnerable, even when he thinks himself
      most secure. Death may walk in at the door and dreams fly
      out of the window. Or the urgent egotisms of a material
      world may break in upon a man's happiness and make it no
      better than a deserted garden into which the little savage
      hands and voices of common children storm. John Stretton
      felt secure in Jess. He did not foresee the chance that
      some quite paltry circumstance might lay in wait for him,
      and use this very love of his as a provocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      For there was an element of danger in the very fineness of
      his love for her. She was so much the one woman in the
      world to him that he was tempted to hedge her round with a
      tender yet human idealism. She was sacred. His egotism, if
      egotism it was, had a deep and devotional passion. He had
      the temper of a man who can love flowers, and love them
      with such gentleness that trampling feet and clutching
      hands can commit an outrage upon his love for them. His
      very gentleness might change to furious resentment and
      anger if some fool brute came blundering into his garden.
      For there are many of us whom a broken flower or a torn
      tree or a hurt dog can evoke more pity than the blubberings
      of a child. Stretton was made that way. His pity was
      challenged by the things which were most helpless, things
      with the least selfishness and cunning, and he included
      among them, not children, but the naturally sensitive
      child. He had been a sensitive child; at school, for his
      first two terms, the other sort of child had given him hell
      and gloried in it. He had not forgotten. And later the same
      sort of male child, grown up into a creature of swollen
      organs, had disgusted him with the cheap grossness of its
      attitude towards women. It was not that Stretton had no
      passion, but it was because his passion had a feeling for
      what was sacred and human and beautiful in the answering
      passion of the woman. It was sacred, an emotion that when
      once sealed became more sacred. He could not conceive it
      being pawed or leered at by any other man. All this was
      inherent in him, part of his most individual self, and
      sometimes a man does not realize his "self" until some
      rough and casual body jostles it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he was the lover and the man, Jessie Viner was the loved
      one and the mother, watchful, a little austere in her
      attitude towards other people, remembering all that Mellor
      had told her, and her man's own confession. Her eyes
      scanned the horizon, but she could see no storm cloud. Her
      man was happy. She heard it in his voice, and saw in his
      eyes, and in the work of his hands. Life was good; it was
      going to go on being good. Their eyes were set towards the
      marriage like the eyes of two comrades wandering into a new
      and dangerous country. They knew that there were pitfalls
      in marriage, perils, the peril of taking things for
      granted, the peril of sameness, the peril of restlessness
      and of the desire for adventure. They had read and they had
      been told that that first ecstasy which is almost anguish
      does not and cannot last, but that it is the fire in which
      the greater and more enduring love is tempered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jess knew it, but she was not afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The days will come, John, when you will kiss me
      differently."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while he would not have it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But they will mean more," he insisted, when her sincerity
      stood out for the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I think they will," she said; "and it will be my
      fault, partly, if they don't. Oh, my dear, I don't want our
      marriage to be a compromise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It never will be," he swore, holding her in the hollow of
      his arm, "because we know what matters. I have learnt a
      lot, Jess, by being made to suffer, I know the prize I have
      drawn in you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      She held close to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But always love me, John, because love makes love between
      two people who understand each other. And sometimes you'll
      tell me you love me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could I help it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But men don't, you know. They get absorbed in other
      things, they take so much for granted. I've seen it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my two sisters. One of them is going old and faded,
      just as though she were drying up. Her husband is quite a
      good sort, as regular and as solemn as a clock, but I
      always wish he would suddenly grow foolish and playful and
      burst out with a 'cuckoo.' I believe he gives her a sort of
      peck once a day. He always calls her 'Rachel,' or 'My
      dear,' in the same voice he uses when he takes a bus ticket
      or asks for the mustard. Now that sort of thing drives a
      woman of spirit mad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think so," said the man, and they went out
      through the orchard, laughing and loving each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was because they understood each other so well and
      looked at life with such clear and human eyes that they
      began to feel so sure of the future. For them the sea of
      marriage was not uncharted. They had courage and a good
      ship to sail in. There would be storms, but not the kind of
      storm which in the past had brought Stretton so near to
      shipwreck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It won't happen again," he said; "I feel that it can't
      happen."
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet it was to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day late in May Thomas Viner came in and sat down to
      his midday meal with an air of preoccupation. His womenfolk
      were quick to feel that he had something on his mind. He
      had a way of drawing his right hand down his cheek when he
      was bothered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some more meat, Tom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, no, mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not ask him what was worrying him, nor did he tell
      them until he had pushed his chair back and filled his
      pipe. He went and stood by the window, and lighting a
      match, sucked steadily at his pipe stem. Jess saw a little
      cloud of blue smoke drift across the sunlit window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm bothered about Jenny," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jenny was a half-bred Hereford and Shorthorn cow, a famous
      milker, from whom Thomas Viner had bred several fine
      heifers, and his herd had come to have a local reputation.
      He valued Jenny, for the mother of the herd was in her
      prime, and he hoped to perpetuate the good strain in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have sent the lad down for Redhead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's as bad as that!" said Mrs. Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't like the look of her. She's been off her feed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jess was clearing the table. She was going out with the
      tray when her father called to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jess?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll be about? Your mother's going down to Hadworth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I shall be about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going down to the 'ten acre.' If Redhead comes while I
      am out, ask him to look at Jenny and wait for me. I shall
      be back before three."
    </p>
    <p>
      Redhead came while Thomas Viner was away down the farm. He
      left his American two-seater in the lane, and Jess, who was
      sitting at the window, saw a head with a hard black hat
      crammed well down on the ears bobbing along above the top
      of the hedge. Mr. Redhead was short, and he had a very
      springing walk, as though the lifting of his heels made him
      look taller. He was no unfamiliar figure in the life of the
      farm. He was a capable little man, with many a capable
      man's one failing, an inability to keep his eyes and his
      hands off women. It was common knowledge that you could
      trust him with a horse, a dog, or a bet, but he ceased to
      be responsible when he was caught by the flick of a
      petticoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jess met him at the porch door. To her he was no more than
      a thick-set little man with a weather-beaten face, hard
      blue eyes and an ugly mouth. He was a great dandy, and his
      waistcoats and riding-breeches were highly decorative. As a
      veterinary surgeon he was fearless and capable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good afternoon, Miss Viner."
    </p>
    <p>
      Redhead always greeted a woman as though he had discovered
      suddenly that she was extraordinarily good-looking. He had
      an eye that gleamed and apprised and coveted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Viner in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jess took Mr. Redhead with frank seriousness as Jenny's
      doctor and as nothing more. He was a common little man but
      he knew his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father is down on the farm, but he will be back before
      three. The cowman is about the buildings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll have a look at the lady. Whereabouts is she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll show you," said Jess; "Father had her put in a lodge
      by herself. He thought it better. He is very fond of
      Jenny."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't wonder!" he said, giving her a droll look. "We men
      can't help it, can we?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a wit, a horse wit, but Jess's sense of humour was
      not his. He was just a thing in breeches who came to do
      certain work for which he was paid. She went down with
      Redhead to the buildings, and across one of the great yards
      strewn with its clean straw towards a cowshed in the far
      corner. She was thinking of other things. She had put out
      her hand to the wooden latch of the shed door when a man's
      hand shot out to do it for her, and in doing it purposely
      touched hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Allow me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was hardly aware of the contact; it had no
      significance, and she did not so much ignore it as fail to
      notice it. Redhead smiled. He thought her complacent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Miss Viner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you have enough light here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Plenty. Where's your cowman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is coming. Marsdell, here's Mr. Redhead."
    </p>
    <p>
      The cowman came across the straw with the action of a man
      wading through water. He joined Redhead in the shed, and
      Jess remained at the door while Jenny's case was gone into.
      Redhead questioned the cowman. The vet. was thorough and
      keen; he was gentle with animals, and his voice softened
      when he spoke to them. He touched them with hands that were
      careful not to frighten or to hurt. Human animal that he
      was he was at his best with beasts, being in rough sympathy
      with them, and this was a part of him which the world
      respected.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came out, cheerful and brisk, polishing the heavy gold
      ring he wore with a green silk handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you think of her, Mr. Redhead?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has got a bit of a temperature."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it serious?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Redhead was cautious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall have to watch her for a few days."
    </p>
    <p>
      The job was done, and he forgot the cow and remembered the
      woman. The gate leading from the main yard was at the end
      of a passage between the great barn and the stable, and it
      opened upon the triangular piece of grass between the farm
      buildings and the house. Redhead was behind Jess, his eyes
      fixed on her neck where the hair swept up from it. She had
      a very beautiful neck, and his glance fondled it. Reaching
      the gate, he pushed forward to open it, and here the
      proclivities of the man showed in a characteristic gesture,
      a crooking of the arm behind her at the level of the waist,
      a mere shadow gesture, for his arm hardly touched her body.
      But she felt it, and instantly resented it, yet for the
      moment neither of them had seen Stretton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Mr. Redhead. I don't like being touched."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry," he said. "I thought the gate might swing back on
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew aside, and then they saw Stretton. He was standing
      by the garden fence, and his figure had a curious rigidity.
      He did not move, but let them approach, and it was the
      expression of his eyes which gave Jess her first warning.
      He was not looking at her but at Redhead, and his eyes had
      a kind of brilliant glare in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant she understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "John, this is Mr. Redhead. He has been to see Jenny. Mr.
      Redhead--Mr. Stretton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pleased to meet you," said the vet.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of her voice Stretton had given a start like a
      man touched in the dark when he had suspected no one near
      him. His eyes left Redhead's face and turned to Jess, and
      as he looked at her the brittle glare went out of them. He
      seemed to draw a deep breath; his arms and shoulders lost
      their rigidity; his hands betrayed an almost imperceptible
      trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Redhead was staring at him with hard-bitten curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I have heard of you, Mr. Stretton."
    </p>
    <p>
      He put out a hand and it was ignored. Stretton gave him one
      swift look, a look that was so scornful, so dangerous, so
      damning that even Redhead's thick skin was penetrated. He
      glanced at Jess. She was smiling, but her smile was so grey
      and transient that it was unlike a smile. She was watching
      Stretton, who had turned aside and was leaning against the
      fence and looking into the distance as though the other man
      was not there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation was awkward. Redhead's turgid face had lost
      its expression of staring and almost truculent good nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of those jealous devils!" he thought. "And pretty
      swollen about the head, too, by God!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked nasty. He pulled out his green handkerchief and
      began to polish his ring. He threw little, vicious glances
      at Stretton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose Mr. Viner won't be long?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm here, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas Viner's square figure pushed through a field gate in
      the young green of a thorn hedge, and he came like a
      welcome human wedge splitting up this awkward and
      inarticulate group into its natural components. Redhead
      turned aside to speak to Mr. Viner, and Jess made a little
      movement of the head, her eyes fixed on Stretton's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "John, come and look."
    </p>
    <p>
      She took him away into the orchard, but he paused under the
      first apple tree. He had something to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry. I thought the cad touched you. I can't stand
      that sort of man near you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear," she said, with her hand on his shoulder, "what does
      a little fool like that matter to you or to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She took him and showed him her bees and a new hive which
      she had installed. She talked, and in a little while in the
      sunlight and the green shadows he seemed to have forgotten
      the angry disgust of a moment ago. Almost, it seemed to
      her, that he was unaware of it, that it had belonged to
      some sinister underworld in him, a world that was once more
      asleep.
    </p>

    <h1>
      MR. REDHEAD'S SENSE OF HUMOUR
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Jessie Viner had had her warning, and she was so wise in
      her acceptance of it that when Redhead came again to Romans
      Farm she made it her affair to be out of the way. She told
      nobody. Self-effacement seemed so simple a solution of a
      transient problem, like the taking away of a box of matches
      from two children, that it is more than probable that her
      common sense would have kept these men apart had it not
      been for the male cussedness of one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Redhead drove home in a bad temper, calling someone "a
      damned, jealous, stuck-up snob." But between the calling of
      names and more serious and considered mischief there is a
      broad distinction, and where one man may curse and forget,
      another will laugh and remember. And Redhead laughed. He
      went into the Castle Inn at Kingsbury and had his usual
      drink and gossip in the private bar. It so happened that
      when he went in someone else went out of it, a young
      professional man in Kingsbury who was built on thin and
      supercilious lines and whose eyes said plainly to Redhead,
      "You vulgar beast."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, another of your superior people, Mrs. Kennedy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Redhead laughed, but there was anger behind his laughter,
      for to have such a sword-glance thrust into one's face
      twice in an afternoon was rather much for a bumptious
      little man's temper. All of us have our moments of
      illumination when we realize the amazing possibility that
      other people's dislike of us may be instinctive and
      reasonable. Redhead sat down and talked to Mrs. Kennedy.
      Men of Redhead's persuasion found it easy to talk to her.
      She had a wicked eye, a kind heart, and no illusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told her about Stretton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now what would you have said to such a chap? Just because
      I happened to be there alone with the girl he's sweet on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jealous," said Mrs. Kennedy. "It might be a buttonhole for
      you, Mr. Redhead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I'm not taking it that way. A man can give you a look
      such as you wouldn't give a dog. Like that lawyer friend of
      yours, thin and shiny like a saint in a stained-glass
      window. What would you have done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Kennedy laughed. "I think I would have put my arm
      round the girl's waist."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove," said Redhead, "that's an idea!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The provocative suggestion stuck in his round head. He went
      home grinning over it, for if bull-baiting is dead there
      are other sports left to us, such as pulling a man's leg
      and pulling it viciously. "All right, young fellah my lad!
      I'll have a bit of a game with you!"
    </p>

      He paid two more visits to Romans Farm, but on neither
      occasion did he see Jessie Viner or John Stretton. It was
      not until his third visit that he was made to realize that
      Jess was avoiding him. Happening to arrive later than usual
      he saw Thomas Viner's daughter picking flowers for the
      house; she pretended not to notice him; she disappeared,
      and though she did it well he realized that her
      disappearance was deliberate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that's it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Most men would have shrugged and have left it at that, but
      not so with Bob Redhead. Some of us remain pestilent and
      mischievous boys. The element of maleness in Redhead had
      been challenged. The girl had dared him to a game of hide
      and seek, because my Lord Stretton was a jealous lord and
      Miss Slyboots had to humour him. Oh, very well, two people
      could play at this game of hide and seek.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was cunning. He had surprised Jess only to lose her, but
      in walking back up the lane after his visit to Jenny,
      Redhead saw what Jess had not meant him to see. Or perhaps
      not knowing the man and his spitefulness she did not
      consider it likely that she would have any further trouble
      with him. After all, why should she? He was just an
      irresponsible fool. The type is common, but it can be kept
      at a distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through a thin place in the hedge where a tree had once
      stood Redhead saw Jessie Viner crossing the "fourteen
      acre," a meadow which lay between the farm land and the
      heath. It was down for hay and still yellow with
      buttercups, but the grass was growing long and shadowy and
      all hazy with flower spikes. On the orchard side of this
      meadow the old thorn hedge had been suffered to grow as it
      pleased, and it hung like green cornice over the edge of
      the field. At the moment it was a mass of white blossom, a
      line of foam against the darker tints of the heath and the
      woods beyond. Jessie Viner was making her way back towards
      this hedge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Redhead paused. He saw her reach the shadow of the hedge
      and move slowly along it. At the far end she turned and
      came back, loitering as though she were waiting for
      someone. He noticed that she glanced towards the heath, and
      in following up her glance he saw that other figure, the
      figure of a man moving down over the heath to the field
      gate in the far corner. There were two gates to the
      "fourteen-acre," the one towards which Stretton was
      walking, the other opening into the lane not twenty yards
      from where Redhead was standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that's it!" he reflected. "The Lovers' Walk, what! Now
      supposing another fellow were to butt in one afternoon,
      just for a joke, you know!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled and glanced at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Six o'clock. What about six o'clock to-morrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus did this Puck in riding-breeches and a billycock hat
      set the stage for John Stretton's undoing, much as a
      mischievous boy puts a match to dry grass without troubling
      to think where or how far the fire may spread. And Jess,
      wandering up and down under the thorn hedge on a still May
      evening, had no more thought than a bird of the snare set
      for her happiness. The lush grass was deepening at her
      feet, and the air was full of the scent of the May blossom.
      The heath rose to the blue of a clear sky, and in a little
      while the blue of it would change to pale gold. She was
      waiting for her lover. How was she to know that a little
      meddlesome fool of a man had left his car at the Rising Sun
      and walked up to the ambush with a chuckle of mischievous
      malice in his heart?

    <h1>
      SANCTUARY
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      This is what John Stretton saw as he came down over the
      heath:
    </p>
    <p>
      The sunlight shone full upon the "fourteen-acre" and the
      old hedge with its whiteness and its band of shadow.
      Everything was very brilliant with the brilliance of a soft
      evening on the edge of June. A man might wander in the
      woods and fields on such an evening and feel that there is
      no guile in the world, no ugliness, no violence. Stretton
      was happy. He had the consciousness in him that within a
      month he and Jessie Viner would be married.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he saw the shadow-show down yonder, first one
      figure, then a second figure appearing suddenly from the
      green shadowiness of the hedge, something jaunty and
      aggressive in the male figure, something surprised and
      fugitive in the girl's. He saw her caught and held for a
      moment, her breaking away, her swift gliding bird-like
      flight along the hedge with the other figure pretending to
      pursue. He heard Redhead laugh. It was enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jess never realized the nearness of a possible tragedy
      until she was in the lane, alone, and with the thorn hedge
      between her and the field. Her anger had sobered Redhead's
      sense of humour, and he had not followed her over the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, Miss Jess, a man's joke, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was trembling; she was hidden from him and he from her.
      It was very silent, but for the singing of a blackbird in
      one of the orchard trees. And then, in the silence of that
      great green field she heard a queer, indescribable sound,
      or rather, a medley of sounds, and her face went as white
      as the May blossom.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran back to the gate, unfastened the catch, and pushed
      the gate open. She saw. The two men were struggling by the
      hedge, but as she ran towards them it ceased to be a
      struggle. Redhead was held by the throat; he was shaken to
      and fro; his legs seemed to buckle under him, while his
      futile hands clutched at Stretton's wrists.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that moment of fear and of anguish she had a woman's
      inspiration, her faith in her own voice. But if he did not
      hear it, did not understand it!
    </p>
    <p>
      "John," she called. "Dear John."
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt life standing still in her during that moment of
      suspense. Then the miraculous thing happened, for to her it
      was nothing less than a miracle. Stretton's hands relaxed.
      She saw that half-strangled figure jerk itself away, and
      slip to its knees. It crawled; it got up on silly, shaking
      legs and broke into a swaying trot; it came towards her
      with its turgid, terrified face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Run," she said, "for God's sake! run, you fool."
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed her. That other figure, still hesitant, storm
      baffled, turned as though to pursue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "John."
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran towards him, arms spread, her face the face of the
      Eternal Mother, divine yet human.
    </p>
    <p>
      "John, dear John, beloved."
    </p>
    <p>
      She met him, body to body, her arms still outspread,
      restraining arms, yet ready to enfold him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She touched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "John, dear man--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook. He looked at her. His eyes came back out of the
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jess! It's you! Oh, my God, what have I done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to clutch at her as though clinging to love and
      life, to her who could save him. His head went down on her
      bosom, and she held it there with both her arms encircling
      it. He shook. He broke into a man's tears, deep and
      passionate and terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my God, it's all over. I can't--I can't--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She held him and let him weep.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, there, I'm here, John; I'm always here. Nothing can
      hurt you now."
    </p>
    <p>
      He held to her, and her strength supported him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jess, you can't marry me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, there," she said, "nothing can keep me from
      marrying you. Beloved, don't you understand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised half-blind eyes to hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I--I don't--I--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew his head down again into the circle of her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm yours; I must be yours, every bit of me. You will
      always think of me as yours, utterly and only yours. John,
      I'm your sanctuary. I'm between you--and that. It's dead."
    </p>
    <p>
