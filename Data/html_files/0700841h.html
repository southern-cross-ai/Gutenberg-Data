  <h2>PREFACE</h2>

  <p class="note">By one of those coincidences which are quite inadmissible in
  fiction, but of frequent occurrence in real life, an incident in the story of
  The Cat's Eye has found an almost exact duplicate in an actual case which has
  been reported in the Press.</p>

  <p class="note">The real case was concerned with a most alarming misadventure
  which befell a distinguished police official of high rank. The fictitious
  incident occurs in Chapter Ten of this book; and the reading of that chapter
  will inevitably convey the impression that I have appropriated the real case
  and incorporated it in my story; a proceeding that the reader might properly
  consider to be in questionable taste.</p>

  <p class="note">It seems, therefore, desirable to explain that Chapter Ten
  was written some months before the real tragedy occurred. Indeed, by that
  time, the book was so nearly completed that it was impracticable to eliminate
  the incident, which was an integral part of the plot.</p>

  <p class="note">The coincidence is to be regretted; but worse things might
  easily have happened. But for the circumstance that I had to lay this book
  aside to complete some other work, The Cat's Eye would have been in print
  when the crime was committed; and it might then have been difficult for any
  one&mdash;even for the author&mdash;to believe that the fictitious crime had
  not furnished the suggestion for the real one.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch1"
     id="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; IN THE MIDST OF LIFE</h2>

  <p class="first">I am not a superstitious man. Indeed superstition, which is
  inseparably bound up with ignorance or disregard of evidence, would ill
  accord with the silken gown of a King's Counsel. And still less am I tainted
  with that particular form of superstition in which the fetishism of barbarous
  and primitive man is incongruously revived in a population of, at least
  nominally, educated persons, by the use of charms, amulets, mascots and the
  like.</p>

  <p>Had it been otherwise; had I been the subject of this curious atavistic
  tendency, I should surely have been led to believe that from the simple gem
  whose name I have used to give a title to this chronicle, some subtle
  influence exhaled whereby the whole course of my life was directed into new
  channels. But I do not believe anything of the kind; and therefore, though it
  did actually happen that the appearance of the Cat's Eye was coincident with
  a radical change in the course and manner of my life, and even, as it seemed,
  with my very personality; and though with the Cat's Eye the unfolding of the
  new life seemed constantly associated; still I would have it understood that
  I use the name merely as a label to docket together a succession of events
  that form a consistent and natural group.</p>

  <p>The particular train of events with which this history deals began on a
  certain evening near the end of the long vacation. It was a cloudy evening, I
  remember, and very dark, for it was past eight o'clock and the days were
  drawing in rapidly. I was returning across Hampstead Heath towards my
  lodgings in the village, and was crossing the broken, gorse-covered and
  wooded hollow to the west of the Spaniards Road, when I heard the footsteps
  of someone running, and running swiftly, as I could judge by the rapid rhythm
  of the footfalls and the sound of scattering gravel. I halted to listen,
  noting that the rhythm of the footsteps was slightly irregular, like the
  ticking of an ill-adjusted clock; and even as I halted, I saw the runner. But
  only for a moment, and then but dimly. The vague shape of a man came out of
  the gloom, passed swiftly across my field of vision, and was gone. I could
  not see what he was like. The dim shape appeared and vanished into the
  darkness, leaving me standing motionless, listening with vague suspicion to
  the now faint footfalls and wondering what I ought to do.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the silence was rent by a piercing cry, the cry of a woman
  calling for help. And, strangely enough, it came from the opposite direction
  to that towards which the fugitive was running. In an instant I turned and
  raced across the rugged hollow towards the spot from whence the sound seemed
  to come, and as I scrambled up a gravelly hillock I saw, faintly silhouetted
  on the murky skyline of some rising ground ahead, the figures of a man and a
  woman struggling together; and I had just noted that the man seemed to be
  trying to escape when I saw him deal the woman a blow, on which she uttered a
  shriek and fell, while the man, having wrenched himself free, darted down the
  farther slope and vanished into the encompassing darkness.</p>

  <p>When I reached the woman she was sitting up with her right hand pressed to
  her side, and as I approached she called out sharply:</p>

  <p>'Follow him! Follow that man! Never mind me!'</p>

  <p>I stood for a moment irresolute, for on the hand that was pressed to her
  side I had noticed a smear of blood. But as I hesitated, she repeated:
  'Follow him! Don't let him escape! He has just committed a dreadful
  murder!'</p>

  <p>On this I ran down the slope in the direction that the man had taken and
  stumbled on over the rugged, gravelly hillocks and hollows, among the furze
  bushes and the birches and other small trees. But it was a hopeless pursuit.
  The man had vanished utterly, and from the dark heath not a sound came to
  give a hint as to the direction in which he had gone. There was no definite
  path, nor was it likely that he would have followed one; and as I ran
  forward, tripping over roots and sandy hummocks, the futility of the pursuit
  became every moment more obvious, while I felt a growing uneasiness as to the
  condition of the woman I had left sitting on the ground and apparently
  bleeding from a wound. At length I gave up the chase and began to retrace my
  steps, now full of anxiety lest I should be unable to find the spot where I
  had left her, and speculating on the possibility that the victim of the
  murder of which she had spoken might yet be alive and in urgent need of
  help.</p>

  <p>I returned as quickly as I could, watching the direction anxiously and
  trying vainly to pick up landmarks. But the uneven, gorse-covered ground was
  a mere formless expanse intersected in all directions by indistinct tracks,
  confused by the numbers of birch-trees and stunted oaks, and shut in on all
  sides by a wall of darkness. Presently I halted with a despairing conviction
  that I had lost my way hopelessly, and at that moment I discerned dimly
  through the gloom the shape of a piece of rising ground lying away to the
  right. Instantly I hurried towards it, and as I climbed the slope, I thought
  I recognised it as the place from which I had started. A moment later, the
  identity of the place was confirmed beyond all doubt, for I perceived lying
  on the ground a shawl or scarf which I now remembered to have seen lying near
  the woman as she sat with her hand pressed to her side, urging me to follow
  her assailant.</p>

  <p>But the woman herself had disappeared. I picked up the shawl, and throwing
  it over my arm, stood for a few moments, peering about me and listening
  intently. Not a sound could I distinguish, however, nor could I perceive any
  trace of the vanished woman. Then I noticed, a few yards away, a defined path
  leading towards a patch of deeper darkness that looked like a copse or
  plantation, and following this, I presently came upon her, standing by a
  fence and clinging to it for support.</p>

  <p>'The man has got away,' said I. 'There is no sign of him. But what about
  you? Are you hurt much?'</p>

  <p>'I don't think so,' she answered faintly. 'The wretch tried to stab me,
  but I don't think&mdash;' Here her voice faded away, as she fell forward
  against the fence and seemed about to collapse. I caught her, and lifting her
  bodily, carried her along the path, which appeared to lead to a house.
  Presently I came to an open gate, and entering the enclosed grounds, saw
  before me an old-fashioned house, the door of which stood ajar, showing a
  faint light from within. As I approached the door, a telephone bell rang and
  a woman's voice, harsh and terrified, smote my ear:</p>

  <p>'Are you there? This is Rowan Lodge. Send to the police immediately! Mr
  Drayton has been robbed and murdered! Yes, Mr Drayton. He is lying dead in
  his room. I am his housekeeper. Send the police and a doctor!'</p>

  <p>At this moment I pushed open the door and entered; and at my appearance,
  with the insensible woman in my arms, the housekeeper shrieked aloud, and
  dropping the receiver, started back with a gesture of wild terror.</p>

  <p>'My God!' she exclaimed, 'What is this? Not another!'</p>

  <p>'I hope not,' I replied, not, however, without misgivings. 'This lady
  tried to hold the man as he was escaping and the villain stabbed her. Where
  can I lay her down?'</p>

  <p>The whimpering housekeeper flung open a door, and snatching a match-box
  from the hall table, struck a match and preceded me into a room where, by the
  light of the match that flickered in her shaking hand, I made out a sofa and
  laid my burden on it, rolling up the shawl and placing it under her head.
  Then the housekeeper lit the gas and came and stood by the sofa, wringing her
  hands and gazing down with horrified pity at the corpse-like figure.</p>

  <p>'Poor dear!' she sobbed. 'Such a pretty creature, too, and quite a lady!
  God help us! What can we do for her? She may be bleeding to death!'</p>

  <p>The same thought was in my mind, and the same question, but as I answered
  that we could do nothing until the doctor arrived, the woman&mdash;or rather
  girl, for she was not more than twenty-six&mdash;opened her eyes and asked in
  a faint voice: 'Is Mr Drayton dead?'</p>

  <p>The housekeeper sobbed an indistinct affirmative and then added:</p>

  <p>'But try not to think about it, my dear. Just keep yourself quite quiet
  until the doctor comes.'</p>

  <p>'Are you sure he is dead?' I asked in a low voice.</p>

  <p>'I wish I were not,' she sobbed. Then, with an earnest look at the young
  lady&mdash;who seemed now to be reviving somewhat&mdash;she added:</p>

  <p>'Come with me and see; and do you lie quite still until I come back, my
  dear.'</p>

  <p>With this she led me out of the room, and turning from the hall into a
  short corridor, passed quickly along it and stopped at a door. 'He is in
  there,' she said in a shaky voice that was half a sob. She opened the door
  softly, peered in, and then, with a shuddering cry, turned and ran back to
  the room that we had just left.</p>

  <p>When she had gone I entered the room half-reluctantly, for the atmosphere
  of tragedy and horror was affecting me most profoundly. It was a smallish
  room, almost unfurnished save for a range of cabinets such as insect
  collectors use; and opposite one of these a man lay motionless on the floor,
  looking, with his set, marble-white face and fixed, staring eyes, like some
  horrible waxwork figure. I stooped over him to see if there were any sign of
  life. But even to a layman's eye the fixity, the utter immobility was
  unmistakable. The man was dead beyond all doubt. I listened with my ear at
  his mouth and laid my finger on the chilly wrist. But the first glance had
  told me all. The man was dead.</p>

  <p>As I stood up, still with my eyes riveted on the face, set in that ghastly
  stare, I became conscious of a certain dim sense of recognition. It was a
  strong, resolute face, and even in death, the fixed expression spoke rather
  of anger than of fear. Where had I seen that face? And then in a flash I
  recalled the name that the housekeeper had called through the
  telephone&mdash;Mr Drayton. Of course. This was the brother of my neighbour
  in the Temple, Sir Lawrence Drayton, the famous Chancery lawyer. He had
  spoken to me of a brother who lived at Hampstead, and there could be no doubt
  that this was he. The likeness was unmistakable.</p>

  <p>But, as I realised this, I realised also the certainty that this crime
  would become my professional concern. Sir Lawrence would undoubtedly put the
  case in the hands of my friend John Thorndyke&mdash;the highest medico-legal
  authority and the greatest criminal lawyer of our time&mdash;and my
  association with Thorndyke would make me a party to the investigation. And
  that being so, it behoved me to gather what data I could before the police
  arrived and took possession.</p>

  <p>The mechanism of the crime was obvious enough, though there were one or
  two mysterious features. Of the cabinet opposite which the body lay, one
  drawer was pulled out, and its loose glass cover had been removed and lay
  shattered on the floor beside the corpse. The contents of this drawer
  explained the motive of the crime, for they consisted of specimens of
  jewellery, all more or less antique, and many of them quite simple and rustic
  in character, but still jewels. A number had evidently been taken, to judge
  by the empty trays, but the greater part of the contents of the drawer
  remained intact.</p>

  <p>The rifled drawer was the second from the top. Having turned up the gas
  and lit a second burner, I drew out the top drawer. The contents of this were
  untouched, though the drawer appeared to have been opened, for the
  cover-glass was marked by a number of rather conspicuous fingerprints. Of
  course these were not necessarily the prints of the robber's fingers, but
  they probably were, for their extreme distinctness suggested a dirty and
  sweaty hand such as would naturally appertain to a professional thief in a
  state of some bodily fear. Moreover the reason why this drawer should have
  been passed over was quite obvious. Its contents were of no intrinsic value,
  consisting chiefly of Buckinghamshire lace bobbins with carved inscriptions
  and similar simple objects.</p>

  <p>I next drew out the third drawer, which I found quite untouched, and the
  absence of any fingerprints on the cover-glass confirmed the probable
  identity of those on the glass of the top drawer. By way of further settling
  this question, I picked up the fragments of the broken glass and looked them
  over carefully; and when I found several of them marked with similar distinct
  fingerprints, the probability that they were those of the murderer became so
  great as nearly to amount to certainty.</p>

  <p>I did not suppose that these fingerprints would be of much interest to
  Thorndyke. They were rather the concern of the police and the Habitual
  Criminals Registry. But still I knew that if he had been in my place he would
  have secured specimens, on the chance of their being of use hereafter, and I
  could do no less than take the opportunity that offered. Looking over the
  broken fragments again, I selected two pieces, each about four inches square,
  both of which bore several fingerprints. I placed them carefully face to face
  in a large envelope from my pocket, having first wrapped their corners in
  paper to prevent the surfaces from touching.</p>

  <p>I had just bestowed the envelope in my letter-case and slipped the latter
  into my pocket when I heard a man's voice in the hall. I opened the door, and
  walking along the corridor, found a police inspector and a sergeant in
  earnest conversation with the housekeeper, while an elderly man, whom I
  judged to be the doctor, stood behind, listening attentively.</p>

  <p>'Well,' said the inspector 'we'd better see to the lady. Will you have a
  look at her, doctor, and when you've attended to her, perhaps you will let us
  know whether she is in a fit state to answer questions. But you might just
  take a look at the body first.' Here he observed me and inquired: 'Let me
  see, who is this gentleman?'</p>

  <p>I explained briefly my connection with the case as we walked down the
  corridor, and the inspector made no comment at the moment. We all entered the
  room, and the doctor stooped over the body and made a rapid inspection.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' he said, rising and shaking his head, 'there's no doubt that he is
  dead, poor fellow. A shocking affair. But I had better go and see to this
  poor lady before I make any detailed examination.'</p>

  <p>With this he bustled away, and the inspector and the sergeant knelt down
  beside the corpse but refrained from touching it.</p>

  <p>'Knife wound, apparently,' said the inspector, nodding gloomily at a small
  pool of blood that appeared between the outstretched right arm and the side.
  'Seems to have been a left-handed man, too, unless he struck from behind,
  which he pretty evidently did not.' He stood up, and once more looking at me,
  somewhat inquisitively, said: 'I had better have your name and address,
  sir.'</p>

  <p>'My name is Anstey&mdash;Robert Anstey, KC, and my address is 8A Kings
  Bench Walk, Inner Temple.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, I know you, sir,' said the inspector with a sudden change of manner.
  'You are Dr. Thorndyke's leading counsel. Well, well. What an odd thing that
  you should happen to come upon this affair by mere chance. It's quite in your
  own line.'</p>

  <p>'I don't know about that,' said I. 'It looks to me rather more in yours.
  If they have got these fingerprints in the files at Scotland Yard you won't
  have much trouble in finding your man or getting a conviction.'</p>

  <p>As I spoke, I drew his attention to the fingerprints on the broken glass,
  saying nothing, however, about those on the upper drawer.</p>

  <p>The two officers examined the incriminating marks with deep interest, and
  the inspector proceeded carefully and skilfully to pack several of the
  fragments for subsequent examination, remarking, as he laid them tenderly on
  the top of a cabinet: 'This looks like a regular windfall, but it's almost
  too good to be true. The professional crook, nowadays, knows too much to go
  dabbing his trade-marks about in this fashion. These prints and the knife
  rather suggest a casual or amateur of some kind. The fellow not only didn't
  wear gloves, he didn't even trouble to wipe his hands. And they wanted wiping
  pretty badly. Are all these cabinets full of jewellery?'</p>

  <p>'I really don't know what they contain, but they are pretty insecure if
  their contents are valuable.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' he agreed. 'A single locked batten to each cabinet. One wrench of a
  jemmy and the whole cabinet is open. Well, we'd better have a few words with
  the housekeeper before we go over the room in detail. And she won't want to
  talk to us in here.'</p>

  <p>With this he led the way back to the hall, and I could not but admire the
  diplomatic way in which he managed to get me away from the scene of his
  intended investigation.</p>

  <p>As we entered the hall, we met the doctor, who was repacking his emergency
  bag at the door of the room.</p>

  <p>'I think,' said he, 'my patient is well enough to give you a few necessary
  particulars. But don't tire her with needless questions.'</p>

  <p>'She is not seriously hurt, then?' said I, with considerable relief.</p>

  <p>'No. But she has had a mighty narrow escape. The brute must have aimed
  badly, for he struck viciously enough, but the point of the knife glanced off
  a rib and came out farther back, just transfixing a fold of skin and muscle.
  It is a nasty wound, but quite superficial and not at all dangerous.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I'm glad it's no worse than that,' said the inspector, and with
  this he pushed open the door of the room and we all entered, though I noticed
  that the sergeant regarded me with a somewhat dubious eye. And now, for the
  first time, I observed the injured lady with some attention, which I was able
  to do at my leisure while the examination was proceeding. And a very
  remarkable-looking girl she was. Whether she would have been considered
  beautiful by the majority of persons I cannot say; she certainly appeared so
  to me. But I have always felt a great admiration of the pictures of
  Burne-Jones and of the peculiar type of womanhood that he loved to paint; and
  this girl, with her soft aureole of reddish-gold hair, her earnest grey eyes,
  her clear, blonde skin&mdash;now pale as marble&mdash;the characteristic
  mouth and cast of features, might have been the model whose presentment gave
  those pictures, to me, their peculiar charm. She seemed not of the common,
  everyday world, but like some visitor from the regions of legend and romance.
  And the distinction of her appearance was supported by her speech&mdash;by a
  singularly sweet voice, an accent of notable refinement, and a manner at once
  gentle, grave, and dignified.</p>

  <p>'Do you feel able to tell us what you know of this terrible affair,
  Madam?' the inspector asked.</p>

  <p>'Oh yes,' she replied. 'I am quite recovered now.'</p>

  <p>'Was Mr Drayton a friend of yours?'</p>

  <p>'No. I never met him until this evening. But perhaps I had better tell you
  how I came to be here and exactly what happened.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' the inspector agreed, 'that will be the shortest way.'</p>

  <p>'Mr Drayton,' she began, 'was, as you probably know, the owner of a
  collection of what he called "inscribed objects"&mdash;jewels, ornaments, and
  small personal effects bearing inscriptions connecting them with some person
  or event or period. I saw a description of the collection in the Connoisseur
  a short time ago, and as I am greatly interested in inscribed jewels, I wrote
  to Mr Drayton asking if I could be allowed to see the collection; and I
  asked, since I am occupied all day, if he could make it convenient to show me
  the collection one evening. I also asked him some questions about the
  specimens of jewellery. In reply he wrote me a most kind letter&mdash;I have
  it in my pocket if you would like to see it&mdash;answering my questions and
  not only inviting me most cordially to come and look at his treasures, but
  offering to meet me at the station and show me the way to the house. Of
  course I accepted his very kind offer and gave him a few particulars of my
  appearance so that he should be able to identify me, and this evening he met
  me at the station and we walked up here together. There was no one in the
  house when we arrived&mdash;at least he thought there was not, for he
  mentioned to me that his housekeeper had gone out for an hour or so. He let
  himself in with a key and showed me into this room. Then he went away,
  leaving the door ajar. I heard him walk down the corridor and I heard a door
  open. Almost at the same moment, he called out loudly and angrily. Then I
  heard the report of a pistol, followed immediately by a heavy fall.'</p>

  <p>'A pistol!' exclaimed the inspector 'I thought it was a knife wound. But I
  mustn't interrupt you.'</p>

  <p>'When I heard the report I ran out into the hall and down the corridor. As
  I went, I heard a sound as of a scuffle, and when I reached the door of the
  museum, which was wide open, I saw Mr Drayton lying on the floor, quite
  still, and a man climbing out of the window. I ran to the window to try to
  stop him, but before I could get there he was gone. I waited an instant to
  look at Mr Drayton, and noticed that he seemed to be already dead and that
  the room was full of the reek from the pistol, then I ran back to the hall
  and out through the garden and along the fence to where I supposed the window
  to be. But for a few moments I could not see any one. Then, suddenly, a man
  sprang over the fence and dropped quite near me, and before he could recover
  his balance, I had run to him and seized him by both wrists. He struggled
  violently, though he did not seem very strong, but he dragged me quite a long
  way before he got free.'</p>

  <p>'Did he say anything to you?' the inspector asked.</p>

  <p>'Yes. He used most horrible language, and more than once he said:</p>

  <p>"Let go, you fool. The man who did it has got away."</p>

  <p>'That might possibly be true,' I interposed, 'for, just before I heard
  this lady call for help, a man passed me at a little distance, running so
  hard that I was half inclined to follow him.'</p>

  <p>'Did you see what he was like?' the inspector demanded eagerly.</p>

  <p>'No. I hardly saw him at all. He passed me at a distance of about thirty
  yards and was gone in an instant. Then I heard this lady call out and, of
  course, ran towards her.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said the inspector,' naturally. But it's a pity you didn't see what
  the man was like. 'Then, once more addressing the lady, he asked:</p>

  <p>'Did this man stab you without warning, Miss&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Blake is my name,' she replied. 'No. He threatened several times to
  "knife" me if I didn't let go. At last he managed to get his left hand free.
  I think he was holding something in it, but he must have dropped it, whatever
  it was, for the next moment I saw him draw a knife from under his coat. Then
  I got hold of his arm again, and that is probably the reason that he wounded
  me so slightly. But when he stabbed me I suddenly went quite faint and fell
  down, and then he escaped.'</p>

  <p>'He held the knife in his left hand, then?' the inspector asked. 'You are
  sure of that?'</p>

  <p>'Quite sure. Of course it happened to be the free hand, but-'</p>

  <p>'But if he had been a right-handed man he would probably have got his
  right hand free. Did you see which side he carried his knife?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. He drew it from under his coat on the left side.'</p>

  <p>'Can you give us any description of the man?'</p>

  <p>'I am afraid I can't. I am sure I should recognise him if I were to see
  him again, but I can't describe him. It was all very confused, and, of
  course, it was very dark. I should say that he was a smallish man, rather
  slightly built. He wore a cloth cap and his hair seemed rather short but
  bushy. He had a thin face, with a very peculiar expression&mdash;but, of
  course, he was extremely excited and furious&mdash;and large, staring eyes,
  and a rather pronounced, curved nose.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, come,' said the inspector approvingly, 'that isn't such a bad
  description. Can you say whether he was dark or fair, clean shaved or
  bearded?'</p>

  <p>'He was clean shaved, and I should say decidedly dark.'</p>

  <p>'And how was he dressed?'</p>

  <p>'He wore a cloth cap, and, I think, a tweed suit. Oh, and he wore
  gloves&mdash;thin, smooth gloves&mdash;very thin kid, I should
  say&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Gloves!' exclaimed the inspector. 'Then the fingerprints must be the
  other man's. Are you sure he had gloves on both hands?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, perfectly sure. I saw them and felt them.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' said the inspector,' this is a facer. It looks as if the other man
  had really done the job while this fellow kept watch outside. It's a
  mysterious affair altogether. There's the extraordinary time they chose to
  break into the house. Eight o'clock in the evening. It would almost seem as
  if they had known about Mr Drayton's movements.'</p>

  <p>'They must have done,' said the housekeeper. 'Mr Drayton went out
  regularly every evening a little after seven. He went down to the village to
  play chess at the club, and he usually came back between half-past nine and
  ten. And I generally sat and worked in the kitchen on the other side of the
  house from the museum.'</p>

  <p>'And did he take no sort of precautions against robbery?'</p>

  <p>'He used to lock the museum when he went out. That was all. He was not at
  all a nervous man, and he used to say that there was no danger of robbery
  because the things in the museum were not the kind of things that burglars go
  for. They wouldn't be of any value to melt or sell.'</p>

  <p>'We must just look over the museum presently and see what the collection
  consists of,' said the inspector. 'And we must see how they got in and what
  they have taken. I suppose there is a catalogue?'</p>

  <p>'No, there isn't,' replied the housekeeper. 'I did suggest to Mr Drayton
  that he ought to draw up a list of the things, but he said it was not a
  public collection, and as he knew all the specimens himself, there was no
  need to number them or keep a catalogue.'</p>

  <p>That is unfortunate,' said the inspector. 'We shan't be able to find out
  what is missing or circulate any descriptions unless you can remember what
  was in the cabinets. By the way, did Mr Drayton ever show his collection to
  visitors other than his personal friends?'</p>

  <p>'Occasionally. After the Connoisseur article that Miss Blake was speaking
  of, two or three strangers wrote to Mr Drayton asking to be allowed to see
  the jewellery, and he invited them to come and showed them everything.'</p>

  <p>'Did Mr Drayton keep a visitors' book, or record of any kind?'</p>

  <p>'No. I don't remember any of the visitors, excepting a Mr Halliburton, who
  wrote from the Baltic Hotel in the Marylebone Road. I remember him because Mr
  Drayton was so annoyed about him. He put himself to great inconvenience to
  meet Mr Halliburton and show him the jewellery that he had asked to see, and
  then, he told me, when he came, it was quite obvious that he didn't know
  anything at all about jewellery, either ancient or modern. He must have come
  just from idle curiosity.'</p>

  <p>'I'm not so sure of that,' said the inspector. 'Looks a bit suspicious. We
  shall have to make some inquiries at the Baltic. And now we had better go and
  have a look at the museum, and perhaps, doctor, you would like to make a
  preliminary examination of the body before it is moved.'</p>

  <p>On this we all rose, and the inspector was just moving towards the hall
  when there came a sharp sound of knocking at the outer door, followed by a
  loud peal of the bell.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2"
     id="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; SIR LAWRENCE DECLARES A VENDETTA</h2>

  <p class="first">At the first stroke of the knocker we all stood stock still,
  and so remained until the harsh jangling of the bell gradually died away.
  There was nothing abnormal in either sound, but I suppose we were all
  somewhat overstrung, for there seemed in the clamorous summons, which
  shattered the silence so abruptly, something ominous and threatening.
  Especially did this appear in the case of the housekeeper, who threw up her
  hands and whimpered audibly.</p>

  <p>'Dear Lord!' she ejaculated. 'It is Sir Lawrence&mdash;his brother! I know
  his knock. Who is to tell him?'</p>

  <p>As no one answered, she crept reluctantly across the room, murmuring and
  shaking her head, and went out into the hall. I heard the door open and
  caught the sound of voices, though not very distinctly. Then the housekeeper
  re-entered the room quickly, and a man who was following her said in a brisk,
  somewhat bantering tone:</p>

  <p>'You are very mysterious, Mrs Benham.' The next moment the speaker came
  into view; and instantly he stopped dead and stood staring into the room with
  a frown of stern surprise.</p>

  <p>'What the devil is this?' he demanded, glaring first at the two officers
  and then at me. 'What is going on, Anstey?'</p>

  <p>For a few moments I was tongue-tied. But an appealing glance from the
  housekeeper seemed to put the duty on me.</p>

  <p>'A dreadful thing has happened, Drayton,' I replied. 'The house has been
  broken into and your brother has been killed.'</p>

  <p>Sir Lawrence turned deathly pale and his face set hard and rigid, until it
  seemed the very counterpart of that white, set face that I had looked on but
  a few minutes age. For a while he stared at me frowningly, neither moving nor
  uttering a word. Then he asked gruffly: 'Where is he?'</p>

  <p>'He is lying where he fell, in the museum,' I replied.</p>

  <p>On this he turned abruptly and walked out of the room. I heard him pass
  quickly down the corridor and then I heard the museum door shut. We all
  looked at one another uncomfortably, but no one spoke. The housekeeper sobbed
  almost inaudibly and now and again uttered a low moan. Miss Blake wept
  silently, and the two officers and the doctor stood looking gloomily at the
  floor.</p>

  <p>Presently Sir Lawrence came back. He was still very pale. But though his
  eyes were red, and indeed were still humid, there was no softness of grief in
  his face. With its clenched jaw and frowning brows, it was grim and stern and
  inexorable as Fate.</p>

  <p>'Tell me,' he said, in a quiet voice, looking from me to the inspector,
  'exactly how this happened.'</p>

  <p>'I don't think any one knows yet,' I replied. 'This lady, Miss Blake, is
  the only person who saw the murderer. She tried to detain him and held on to
  him until he stabbed her.'</p>

  <p>'Stabbed her!' he exclaimed, casting a glance of intense apprehension at
  the recumbent figure on the sofa and stepping softly across the room.</p>

  <p>'I am not really hurt,' Miss Blake hastened to assure him. 'It is only
  quite a trifling wound.'</p>

  <p>He bent over her with a strange softening of the grim face, touching her
  hand with his and tenderly adjusting the rug that the housekeeper had spread
  over her.</p>

  <p>'I pray to God that it is as you say,' he replied. Then, turning to me, he
  asked: 'Has this brave young lady been properly attended to?'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' I answered. 'The doctor here&mdash;Dr&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Nichols,' said the medicus. 'I have examined the wound thoroughly and
  dressed it, and I think I can assure you that no danger is to be apprehended
  from it. But, having regard to the shock she has sustained, I think she ought
  to be got home as soon as possible.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' Sir Lawrence agreed, 'and if she is fit to be moved, I will convey
  her to her home. My car is waiting in the road. And I will ask you. Anstey,
  to come with me, if you can.'</p>

  <p>Of course I assented, and he continued, addressing the inspector:</p>

  <p>'When I have taken this lady home I shall go straight to Dr Thorndyke and
  ask him to assist the police in investigating this crime. Probably he will
  return here with me at once, and I will ask you to see that nothing&mdash;not
  even the body&mdash;is disturbed until he has made his inspection.'</p>

  <p>At this the officer looked a little dubious, but he answered courteously
  enough: 'So far as I am concerned. Sir Lawrence, your wishes shall certainly
  be attended to. But I notified Scotland Yard before I came on here, and this
  case will probably be dealt with by the Criminal Investigation Department,
  and, of course, I can enter into no undertakings on their behalf.'</p>

  <p>'No,' Sir Lawrence rejoined, 'of course you can't. I will deal with the
  Scotland Yard people myself. And now we had better start. Is Miss Blake able
  to walk to the car, Doctor? It is only a few yards to the road.'</p>

  <p>'I am quite able to walk,' said Miss Blake; and as Dr Nichols assented, we
  assisted her to rise, and Sir Lawrence carefully wrapped her in the rug that
  Mrs Benham had thrown over her. Then I picked up the shawl, and tucking it
  under my arm, followed her as she walked slowly out supported by Sir
  Lawrence.</p>

  <p>At the garden gate we turned to the left, and passing along the path, came
  very shortly to a road on which two cars were standing, a large closed car,
  which I recognised as Sir Lawrence's, and a smaller one, presumably Dr
  Nichols'. Into the former Miss Blake was assisted, and when the carriage rug
  had been wrapped around her, I entered and took the opposite seat.</p>

  <p>'What address shall I tell the driver, Miss Blake?' Sir Lawrence
  asked.</p>

  <p>'Sixty-three Jacob Street, Hampstead Road,' she replied; and then, as
  neither the driver nor either of us could locate the street, she added:</p>

  <p>'It is two or three turnings past Mornington Crescent on the same side of
  the road.'</p>

  <p>Having given this direction to the driver, Sir Lawrence entered and took
  the vacant seat and the car moved off smoothly, silently, and with
  unperceived swiftness.</p>

  <p>During the journey hardly a word was spoken. The darkness of the heath
  gave place to the passing lights of the streets, the rural quiet to the
  clamour of traffic. In a few minutes, as it seemed, we were at the wide
  crossing by the Mother Red-Cap, and in a few more were turning into a narrow,
  dingy, and rather sordid by-street. Up this the car travelled slowly as the
  driver threw the light of a powerful lamp on the shabby doors, and at length
  drew up opposite a wide, wooden gate on which the number sixty-three was
  exhibited in large brass figures. I got out of the car and approached the
  gate in no little surprise, for its appearance and the paved truckway that
  led through it suggested the entrance to a factory or builders yard. However,
  there was no doubt that it was the right house, for the evidence of the
  number was confirmed by a small brass plate at the side, legibly inscribed
  'Miss Blake' and surmounted by a bell-pull. At the latter I gave a vigorous
  tug and was immediately aware of the far-away jangling of a large bell, which
  sounded as if it were ringing in an open yard.</p>

  <p>In a few moments I detected quick footsteps which seemed to be approaching
  along a paved passage; then a wicket in the gate opened and a boy of about
  twelve looked out.</p>

  <p>'Whom did you want, please?' he asked in a pleasant, refined voice and
  with a courteous, self-possessed manner which 'placed' him instantly in a
  social sense. Before I had time to reply, he had looked past me and observed
  Miss Blake, who, having been helped out of the car, was now approaching the
  gate; on which he sprang through the wicket and ran to meet her.</p>

  <p>'You needn't be alarmed, Percy,' she said in a cheerful voice. 'I have had
  a little accident and these gentlemen have very kindly brought me home. But
  it is nothing to worry about.'</p>

  <p>'You look awfully white and tired, Winnie,' he replied; and then,
  addressing me, he asked: 'Is my sister hurt much, sir?'</p>

  <p>'No,' I answered. 'The doctor who attended to her thought that she would
  soon be quite well again, and I hope she will. Is there anything that we can
  do for you, Miss Blake?'</p>

  <p>'Thank you, no,' she replied. 'My brother and a friend will look after me
  now, but I can't thank you enough for all your kindness.'</p>

  <p>'It is I,' said Sir Lawrence, 'who am in your debt&mdash;deeply in your
  debt. And I do pray that you may suffer no ill consequences from your
  heroism. But we mustn't keep you standing here. Goodbye, dear Miss Blake, and
  God bless you.'</p>

  <p>He shook her hand warmly and her brother's with old-fashioned courtesy. I
  handed the boy the folded shawl, and having shaken hands with both, followed
  my friend to the car.</p>

  <p>'Do you think Thorndyke will be at home?' he asked as the car turned round
  and returned to the Hampstead Road.</p>

  <p>'I expect so,' I replied. 'But I don't suppose there will be very much for
  him to do. There were plenty of fingerprints in evidence. I should think the
  police will be able to trace the man without difficulty.'</p>

  <p>'Police be damned!' he retorted gruffly. 'I want Thorndyke. And as to
  fingerprints, weren't you the leading counsel in that Hornby case?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, but that was exceptional. You can't assume&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'That case,' he interrupted, 'knocked the bottom out of fingerprint
  evidence. And these fingerprints may not be on the files at the registry, and
  if they are not, the police have no clue to this man's identity, and are not
  likely to get any.'</p>

  <p>It seemed to me that he was hardly doing the police justice, but there was
  no use in discussing the matter, as we were, in fact, going to put the case
  in Thorndyke's hands. I accordingly gave a colourless assent, and for the
  rest of the short journey we sat in silence, each busy with his own
  reflections.</p>

  <p>At length the car drew up at the Inner Temple gate. Drayton sprang out,
  and signing to the driver to wait, passed through the wicket and strode
  swiftly down the narrow lane. As we came out at the end of Crown Office Row,
  he looked eagerly across at King's Bench Walk.</p>

  <p>'There's a light in Thorndyke's chambers,' he said, and quickening his
  pace almost to a run, he crossed the wide space, and plunging into the entry
  of number 5A, ascended the stairs two at a time. I followed, not without
  effort, and as I reached the landing the door opened in response to his
  peremptory knock and Thorndyke appeared in the opening.</p>

  <p>'My dear Drayton!' he exclaimed, 'you really ought not, at your
  age&mdash;' he stopped short, and looking anxiously at our friend, asked: 'Is
  anything amiss?'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' Drayton replied quietly, though breathlessly. 'My brother
  Andrew&mdash;you remember him, I expect&mdash;has been murdered by some
  accursed housebreaker. He is lying on the floor of his room now. I told them
  to leave him there until you had seen him. Can you come?'</p>

  <p>'I will come with you immediately,' was the reply; and as with grave face
  and quick but unhurried movements, he made the necessary preparations, I
  noticed that&mdash;characteristically&mdash;he asked no questions, but
  concentrated his attention on providing for all contingencies. He had laid a
  small, green, canvas-covered case upon the table, and opening it, was making
  a rapid inspection of the apparatus that it contained, when suddenly I
  bethought me of the pieces of glass in my pocket.</p>

  <p>'Before we start,' said I, 'I had better give you these. The fingerprints
  on them are almost certainly those of the murderer. 'As I spoke, I carefully
  unwrapped the two pieces of glass and handed them to Thorndyke, who took them
  from me, holding them daintily by their edges, and scrutinising them
  closely.</p>

  <p>'I am glad you brought these, Anstey,' he said. 'They make us to some
  extent independent of the police. Do they know you have them?'</p>

  <p>'No,' I replied. 'I took possession of them before the police
  arrived.'</p>

  <p>'Then, in that case,' said he 'it will be as well to say nothing about
  them.' He held the pieces of glass up against the light, examining them
  closely and comparing them, first with the naked eye and then with the aid of
  a lens. Finally he lifted the microscope from its shelf, and placing it on
  the table, laid one of the pieces of glass on the stage and examined it
  through the instrument. His inspection occupied only a few seconds, then he
  rose, and turning to Drayton, who had been watching him eagerly, said: 'It
  may be highly important for us to have these fingerprints with us. But we
  can't produce the originals before the police, and besides, they are too
  valuable to carry about at the risk of spoiling them. But I could make rough,
  temporary photographs of them in five minutes if you will consent to the
  delay.'</p>

  <p>'I am in your hands, Thorndyke,' replied Drayton. 'Do whatever you think
  is necessary.'</p>

  <p>'Then let us go to the laboratory at once,' said Thorndyke; and taking the
  two pieces of glass, he led the way across the landing and up the stairs to
  the upper floor on which the laboratory and workshop were situated. And as we
  went, I could not but appreciate Thorndyke's tact and sympathy in taking
  Drayton up with him, so that the tedium of delay might be relieved by the
  sense of purposeful action.</p>

  <p>The laboratory and its methods were characteristic of Thorndyke.
  Everything was ready and all procedure was prearranged. As we entered, the
  assistant, Polton, put down the work on which he was engaged, and at a word,
  took up the present task without either hesitation or hurry. While Thorndyke
  fixed the pieces of glass in the copying frame of the great standing camera,
  Polton arranged the light and the condensers and produced a dark-slide loaded
  with bromide paper. In less than a minute the exposure was made; in another
  three minutes the print had been developed, roughly fixed, rinsed, squeegeed,
  soaked in spirit, cut in two, and trimmed with scissors, and the damp but
  rapidly drying halves attached with drawing pins to a small hinged board
  specially designed for carrying wet prints in the pocket.</p>

  <p>'Now,' said Thorndyke, slipping the folded board into his pocket and
  taking from a shelf a powerful electric inspection lamp, 'I think we are
  ready to start. These few minutes have not been wasted.'</p>

  <p>We returned to the lower room, where Thorndyke, having bestowed the lamp
  in the canvas-covered 'research-case,' put on his hat and overcoat and took
  up the case, and we all set forth, walking quickly and in silence up Inner
  Temple Lane to the gate, and taking our seats in the waiting car when Drayton
  had given a few laconic instructions to the driver.</p>

  <p>Up to this point Thorndyke had asked not a single question about the
  crime. Now, as the car started, he said to Drayton: 'We had better be ready
  to begin the investigation as soon as we arrive. Could you give me a short
  account of what has happened?'</p>

  <p>'Anstey knows more about it than I do,' was the reply. 'He was there
  within a few minutes of the murder.'</p>

  <p>The question being thus referred to me, I gave an account of all that I
  had seen and heard, to which Thorndyke listened with deep attention,
  interrupting me only once or twice to elucidate some point that was not quite
  clear.</p>

  <p>'I understand,' said he when I had finished, 'that there is no catalogue
  or record of the collection and no written description of the specimens?'</p>

  <p>'No,' replied Drayton. 'But I have looked over the cabinets a good many
  times, and taken the pieces out to examine them, so I think I shall be able
  to tell roughly what is missing, and give a working description of the
  pieces. And I could certainly identify most of them if they should be
  produced.'</p>

  <p>'They are not very likely to be traced,' said Thorndyke. 'It is highly
  improbable that the murderer will attempt to dispose of things stolen in such
  circumstances. Still, the possibility of identifying them may be of the
  greatest importance, for the folly of criminals is often beyond belief.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3"
     id="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; THORNDYKE TAKES UP THE INQUIRY</h2>

  <p class="first">The outer door of the house was shut, although the lower
  rooms were all lighted up, but at the first sound of the bell it was opened
  by a uniformed constable who regarded us stolidly and inquired as to our
  business. Before there was time to answer, however, a man whom I at once
  recognised as Inspector Badger of the Criminal Investigation Department came
  out into the hall and asked sharply: 'Who is that, Martin?'</p>

  <p>'It is Sir Lawrence Drayton, Dr Thorndyke, and Mr Anstey,' I replied; and
  as the constable backed out of the way we all entered.</p>

  <p>'This is a terrible catastrophe, Sir Lawrence,' said Badger 'Dreadful,
  dreadful. If sincere sympathy would be any consolation&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'It wouldn't,' interrupted Drayton, 'though I thank you all the same. The
  only thing that would console me&mdash;and that little enough&mdash;would be
  the sight of the ruffian who did it dangling at the end of a rope. The local
  officer told you, I suppose, that I was asking Dr Thorndyke to lend his
  valuable aid in investigating the crime?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, Sir Lawrence,' replied Badger, 'but I don't know that I am in a
  position to authorise any unofficial&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Tut, tut, man!' Drayton broke in impatiently, 'I am not asking you to
  authorise anything. I am the murdered man's sole executor and his only
  brother. In the one capacity his entire estate is vested in me until it has
  been disposed of in accordance with the will; in the other capacity, the duty
  devolves on me of seeing that his murderer is brought to account. I give you
  every liberty and facility to examine these premises, but I am not going to
  surrender possession of them. Has any discovery been made?'</p>

  <p>'No, sir.' Badger replied a little sulkily. 'We have only been here a few
  minutes. I was taking some particulars from the housekeeper.'</p>

  <p>'Possibly I can give you some information while Dr Thorndyke is making his
  inspection of my poor brother's body,' said Drayton. 'When he has finished
  and the body has been laid decently in his bedroom, I will come with you to
  the museum and we will see if anything is missing.'</p>

  <p>Badger assented, with evident unwillingness, to this arrangement. He and
  Drayton entered the drawing-room, from which the inspector had just come,
  while I conducted Thorndyke to the museum.</p>

  <p>The room was just as I had seen it last, excepting that the open drawer
  had been closed. The stark, rigid figure still lay on the floor, the set,
  white face still stared with stern fixity at the ceiling. As I looked, the
  events of the interval faded from my mind and all the horror of the sudden
  tragedy came back.</p>

  <p>Just inside the door Thorndyke halted and slowly ran his eye round the
  room, taking in its arrangement, and no doubt fixing it in his memory.
  Presently he stepped over to where the body lay, and stood a while looking
  down on the dead man. Then he stopped and closely examined a spot on the
  right breast.</p>

  <p>'Isn't there more bleeding than is usual in the case of a bullet-wound?' I
  asked.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' he replied, 'but that blood hasn't come from the wound in front.
  There must be another at the back, possibly a wound of exit. 'As he spoke, he
  stood up and again looked searchingly round the room, more especially at the
  side in which the door opened. Suddenly his glance became fixed and he strode
  quickly across to a cabinet that stood beside the door; and as I followed
  him, I perceived a ragged hole in the front of one of the drawers.</p>

  <p>'Do you mean, Thorndyke,' I exclaimed, 'that the bullet passed right
  through him?'</p>

  <p>That is what it looks like,' he replied. 'But we shall be able to judge
  better when we get the drawer open&mdash;which we can't do until Badger
  comes. But there is one thing that we had better do at once.' Stepping over
  to the table on which he had placed the research-case, he opened the latter,
  and taking from it a stick of blackboard chalk, went back to the body. 'We
  must assume,' said he, 'that he fell where he was standing when he was
  struck, and if that is so he would have been standing here.' He marked on the
  carpet two-rough outlines to indicate the position of the feet when the
  murdered man fell, and having put the chalk back in the case, continued: 'The
  next thing is to verify the existence of the wound at the back. Will you help
  me to turn him over?'</p>

  <p>We turned the body gently on to its right side, and immediately there came
  into view a large, blood-stained patch under the left shoulder, and at the
  centre of it a ragged burst in the fabric of the coat.</p>

  <p>'That will do,' said Thorndyke. 'It is an unmistakable exit wound. The
  bullet probably missed the ribs both in entering and emerging, and passed
  through the heart or the great vessels. The appearances suggest almost
  instantaneous death. The face is set, the eyes wide open, and both the hands
  tightly clenched in a cadaveric spasm. And the right hand seems to be
  grasping something, but we had better leave that until Badger has seen
  it.'</p>

  <p>At this moment footsteps became audible coming along the corridor, and
  Badger entered the room accompanied by the local inspector. The two officers
  looked inquiringly at Thorndyke, who proceeded at once to give them a brief
  statement of the facts that he had observed.</p>

  <p>'There can't be much doubt,' said Badger when he had examined the hole in
  the drawer front, 'that this was made by a spent bullet. But we may as well
  settle the question now. We shall want the keys in any case.'</p>

  <p>He passed his hand over the dead man's clothes, and having located the
  pocket which contained the keys, drew out a good-sized bunch, with which he
  went over to the cabinet. A few trials with likely-looking keys resulted in
  the discovery of the right one, and when this had been turned and the hinged
  batten swung back, all the drawers of the cabinet were released. The
  inspector pulled out the one with the damaged front and looked in
  inquisitively. Its contents consisted principally of latten and pewter
  spoons, now evidently disarranged and mingled with a litter of splinters of
  wood; and in the bowl of a spoon near the back of the drawer lay a distorted
  bullet, which Badger picked up and examined critically.</p>

  <p>'Browning automatic, I should say,' was his comment, 'and if so we ought
  to find the cartridge case somewhere on the floor. We must look for it
  presently, but we'd better get the body moved first, if you have finished
  your inspection, Doctor.'</p>

  <p>'There is something grasped in the right hand,' said Thorndyke. 'It looks
  like a wisp of hair. Perhaps we had better look at that before the body is
  moved, in case it should fall out.'</p>

  <p>We returned to the body, and the two officers stooped and watched eagerly
  as Thorndyke, with some difficulty, opened the rigid hand sufficiently to
  draw from it a small tuft of hair.</p>

  <p>'The spasm is very marked,' he observed as he scrutinised the hair and
  felt in his pocket for a lens; and when, with the aid of the latter, he had
  made a further examination, he continued: 'The state of the root-bulbs shows
  that the hair was actually plucked out&mdash;which, of course, is what we
  should expect.'</p>

  <p>'Can you form any opinion as to what sort of man he was?' Badger
  asked.</p>

  <p>'No,' replied Thorndyke, 'excepting that he was not a recently released
  convict. But the appearance of the hair agrees with Miss Blake's description
  of the man who stabbed her. I understand that she described him as a having
  rather short but bushy hair. This hair is rather short, though we can't say
  whether it was bushy or not. Perhaps more complete examination of it may tell
  us something further.'</p>

  <p>'Possibly,' Badger agreed. 'I will have it thoroughly examined, and get a
  report on it. Shall I take charge of it?' he added, holding out his hand.</p>

  <p>'Yes, you had better,' replied Thorndyke, 'but I will take a small sample
  for further examination, if you don't mind.'</p>

  <p>'There is no need for that,' protested Badger. 'You can always have access
  to what we've got if you want to refer to it.'</p>

  <p>'I know,' said Thorndyke, 'and it is very good of you to offer. Still this
  will save time and trouble.' And without more ado he separated a third of the
  tuft and handed the remainder to the inspector, who wrapped it in a sheet of
  note-paper that he had taken from his pocket and sourly watched Thorndyke
  bestow his portion in a seed-envelope from his pocket-book, and after writing
  on it a brief description, return it to the latter receptacle.</p>

  <p>'You were saying,' said Badger, 'that this hair agrees with Miss Blake's
  description. But it was suggested that it was the other man who really
  committed the murder. Isn't that rather a contradiction?'</p>

  <p>'I don't think so,' replied Thorndyke. 'The probabilities seem to me to
  point to the other man as the murderer.'</p>

  <p>'But how can that be?' objected Badger. 'You say that this hair agrees
  with Miss Blake's description of the man. But this hair is obviously the hair
  of the murderer. And that man was left-handed and the wound is on the right
  breast, suggesting that the murderer held his pistol in his left hand.'</p>

  <p>'Not at all,' said Thorndyke. 'I submit that this hair is obviously not
  the hair of the murderer. Look at those chalk marks that I have made on the
  floor. They mark the spot on which the deceased was standing when the bullet
  struck him. Now go back to the cabinet and look at the chalk marks and see
  what is in a direct line with them.'</p>

  <p>The inspector did so. 'I see,' said he. 'You mean the window.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, it was open, since the robber evidently came in by it, and the sill
  is barely five feet from the ground. I suggest&mdash;but merely as a
  probability, since the bullet may have been deflected&mdash;that the other
  man was keeping guard outside, and that when he heard a noise from this room
  he looked in through the window and saw his confederate on the point of being
  captured by the deceased, that he then fired, and when he saw deceased fall,
  he made his escape. That would account for the man who was seen by Miss Blake
  making his appearance after the other man had gone. He may have had to
  extricate himself from the dead man's grasp, and then he had to climb out of
  the window. But the position of the empty cartridge-case&mdash;if we find
  it&mdash;will settle the question. If the pistol was fired into the room
  through the window, the cartridge-case will be on the ground outside.'</p>

  <p>He opened his research-case, and taking from it the electric lamp, walked
  slowly to the window, throwing the bright light on the floor as he went. The
  two officers followed, and all scrutinised the floor closely, but in vain.
  Then Thorndyke leaned out of the window and threw the light of his lamp on
  the ground outside, moving the bright beam slowly to and fro while the
  inspector craned forward eagerly. Suddenly Badger uttered an exclamation.</p>

  <p>'There it is, Doctor! Don't move the light. Keep it there while I go out
  and pick the case up.'</p>

  <p>'One moment, Badger,' said Thorndyke. 'We mustn't be impetuous. There are
  some other things out there more important than the cartridge-case. I can see
  two distinct sets of footprints, and it is above all things necessary that
  they should not be confused by being trodden into. Let us get the body moved
  first. Then we can take some mats out and examine the footprints
  systematically and recover the cartridge-case at the same time. If we are
  careful we can leave the ground in such a condition that it will be possible
  to go over it again by daylight.'</p>

  <p>The wisdom of this suggestion was obvious, and the inspector proceeded at
  once to act on it. The sergeant and the constable were sent for, and by them
  the body of the murdered man was carried, under the inspector's supervision,
  to the bedroom above. Then a couple of large mats were procured from Mrs
  Benham and we all issued from the front door into the garden. Here, however,
  a halt was called, and at Thorndyke's suggestion, the party was separated
  into two, he and Badger to explore the grounds inside the fence, while the
  local inspector and the others endeavoured to follow the tracks outside.</p>

  <p>I did not join either party, nor did Sir Lawrence. We both realised the
  futility of any attempt to trace the fugitives, and recognised that the
  suggestion was made by Thorndyke merely to get rid of the unwanted
  supernumeraries. Accordingly we took up a position outside the fence, which
  we could just look over, and watched the proceedings of Thorndyke and
  Inspector Badger, as they passed slowly along the side of the house, each
  with the light of his lantern thrown full on the ground.</p>

  <p>They had gone but a few paces when they picked up on the soft, loamy path
  the fairly clear impressions of two pairs of feet going towards the back of
  the house. Both the investigators paused and stooped to examine them, and
  Badger remarked: 'So they came in at the front gate-naturally, as it was the
  easiest way. But they must have been pretty sure that there was no one in the
  house to see them. And that suggests that they knew the ways of the household
  and that they had lurked about to watch Mr Drayton and Mrs Benham off the
  premises.'</p>

  <p>'Is it possible to distinguish one man from the other?' Drayton asked.</p>

  <p>'Yes, quite easily,' Badger replied. 'One of them is a biggish
  man&mdash;close on six feet, I should say&mdash;while the other is quite a
  small man. That will be the one that Miss Blake saw.'</p>

  <p>They followed the tracks to the back of the house, and as we followed on
  our side of the fence Thorndyke called out: 'Be careful, Anstey, not to tread
  in the tracks where they came over the fence. We ought to get specially clear
  prints of their feet where they jumped down. Could you get a light?'</p>

  <p>'I'll go and get one of the acetylene lamps from the car,' said Drayton.
  'You stay where you are until I come back.'</p>

  <p>He was but a short time absent, and when he returned he was provided with
  a powerful lamp and a couple of small mats. 'I have brought these,' he
  explained 'to lay on any particularly clear footprints to protect them from
  chance injury. We mustn't lose the faintest shadow of a clue.'</p>

  <p>With the aid of the brilliant light Drayton and I explored the ground at
  the foot of the fence. Suddenly Sir Lawrence exclaimed:</p>

  <p>'Why, these look like a woman's footprints!' and he pointed to a set of
  rather indistinct impressions running parallel to the fence.</p>

  <p>They will be Miss Blake's,' said I. 'She ran round this way. Yes, here is
  the place where the man came over. What extraordinarily clear impressions
  this ground takes. It shows the very brads in the heels.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' he agreed; 'this is the Hampstead sand, you know; one of the finest
  foundry-sands in the country.'</p>

  <p>He laid one of the mats carefully on the pair of footprints, and we
  continued our explorations towards the back of the house. Here we saw
  Thorndyke and the inspector, each kneeling on a mat, examining a confused
  mass of footprints on the ground between the museum window and the fence.</p>

  <p>'Have you found the cartridge-case?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' replied Thorndyke. 'Badger has it. It is a "Baby Browning." And I
  think we have seen all there is to see here by this light. Can you see where
  the big man came down from the fence? He went over where I am throwing the
  light.'</p>

  <p>We approached the spot cautiously, and at the place indicated perceived
  the very clear and deep impression of a large right foot with a much less
  distinct print of a left foot, both having the heels towards the fence; and a
  short distance in front of them the soft, loamy earth bore a clear impression
  of a left hand with the fingers spread out, and a fainter print of a right
  hand.</p>

  <p>I reported these facts to Thorndyke, who at once decided to come over and
  examine the prints. Handing his lamp over a few paces farther along the
  fence, he climbed up and dropped lightly by my side, followed almost
  immediately by Inspector Badger.</p>

  <p>'This,' said the inspector, gazing down at the foot and hand-prints,
  'bears out what we saw from the inside. He wasn't any too active, this
  chappie. Probably fat&mdash;a big, heavy, awkward man. Had to pull the garden
  seat up to the fence to enable him to get over, though it was an easy fence
  to climb with those big cross-rails; and here, you see, he comes down all of
  a heap on his hands and knees. However, that doesn't help us a great deal. He
  isn't the only fat man in the world. We had better go indoors now and have a
  look at the room and see if we can find out what has been taken.'</p>

  <p>We turned to retrace our steps towards the gate, pausing on our way to
  lift the mats and inspect the footprints of the smaller man; and as we went
  Drayton asked if anything of interest had been discovered.</p>

  <p>'No,' replied Badger. 'They got in without any difficulty by forcing back
  the catch of the window&mdash;unless the window was open already. It isn't
  quite clear whether they both got in. The big man walked part of the way
  round the house and along the fence in both directions, and he pulled a
  garden seat up to the fence to help himself up. The small man came out of the
  window last, if they were both inside, and I expect it was he who dropped
  this&mdash;must have had it in his hand when he climbed out'&mdash;and here
  the inspector produced from his pocket a ring, set with a single round stone,
  which he handed to Sir Lawrence.</p>

  <p>'Ah,' said the latter, 'a posy-ring, one of the cat's eye series. There
  were several of these and a set of moonstone rings in the same drawer.'</p>

  <p>'You know the collection pretty well, then. Sir Lawrence?'</p>

  <p>'Fairly well. I often used to look over the things with my poor brother.
  But, of course, I can't remember all the specimens, though I think I can show
  you the drawer that this came from.'</p>

  <p>By this time we had entered the house and were making our way to the
  museum. On entering the room, Drayton walked straight to the cabinet which I
  remembered to have seen open, and pulled out the second drawer from the
  top.</p>

  <p>'This is the one,' said he. 'They have taken out the glass top&mdash;I
  suppose those are the pieces of it on the floor.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Badger. 'We found it open, and it seems to be the only drawer
  that has been tampered with.'</p>

  <p>Drayton pulled out the top drawer, and having looked closely at the glass
  cover, remarked: 'They have had this one open, too. There are distinct
  fingerprints on the glass; and they have had the cover off for there are
  finger-marks on the inside of the glass. I wonder why they did that.'</p>

  <p>'I can't imagine.' said Badger. 'They don't seem to have taken
  anything&mdash;there wasn't anything worth taking, for that matter. But they
  could see that without lifting off the glass. However, it is all for the
  best. We'll hand this glass cover to the Fingerprint Department and hope they
  will be able to spot the man that the fingers belong to.'</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he made as if he would lift off the cover, but he was
  anticipated by Thorndyke, who carefully raised the glass by its leather tab,
  and taking it up by the edges, held it against the light and examined the
  fingerprints minutely both on the upper and under surfaces.</p>

  <p>'The thumbs are on the upper surface,' he remarked, 'and the fingers
  underneath; so the glass was lifted right out and held with both hands.'</p>

  <p>He handed the glass to the inspector, who had been watching him uneasily,
  and now took the cover from him with evident relief; and as Badger proceeded
  to deposit it in a safe place, he pushed in the top drawer and returned to
  the consideration of the second.</p>

  <p>'There are evidently several pieces missing from this drawer,' said he,
  'and it may be important to know what they are, though it is rather unlikely
  that the thieves will try to dispose of them. Can you tell us what they are,
  Drayton?'</p>

  <p>'I can tell you roughly,' was the reply. 'This drawer contained the
  collection of posy-rings, and most of them are there still, as you can see.
  The front row were rings set with moonstone and cat's eye, and most of those
  are gone. Then there was a group of moonstone and cat's eye ornaments, mostly
  brooches and earrings, and one pendant. Those have all disappeared. And there
  is another thing that was in this drawer that has apparently been taken; a
  locket. It was shaped like a book and had a Greek inscription on the
  front.'</p>

  <p>'So far as you can see, Sir Lawrence,' said Badger, 'has anything of value
  been taken&mdash;of real value, I mean?'</p>

  <p>'Of negotiable value, you mean,' Drayton corrected. 'No. Most of the
  things were of gold, though not all, but the stones were probably worth no
  more than a few shillings each. The value was principally in the associations
  and individual character of the pieces. All of them had inscriptions, and
  several of them had recorded histories. But that would be of no use to a
  thief.'</p>

  <p>'Exactly,' said Badger. 'That was what was in my mind. There is something
  rather amateurish about this robbery. It isn't quite like the work of a
  regular hand. The time was foolish, and then all this shooting and stabbing
  is more like the work of some stray foreign crooks than of a regular
  tradesman; and as you say, the stuff wasn't worth the risk&mdash;unless
  there's something else of more value. Perhaps we had better go through the
  other cabinets.'</p>

  <p>He produced the bunch of keys from his pocket and had just inserted one
  into the lock of the next cabinet when Drayton interposed.</p>

  <p>'There is no need for that, Inspector. If the cabinets are locked and have
  not been broken open, their contents are intact; and I can tell you that
  those contents are of no considerable intrinsic value.'</p>

  <p>With this he drew the key from the lock and dropped the bunch in his
  pocket, a proceeding whereat the inspector smiled sourly and remarked: 'Then
  in that case, I think I have finished for the present. I'll just pack up this
  glass cover and see if those others were able to follow the tracks of either
  of these men. And I'll wish you gentlemen goodnight.'</p>

  <p>Sir Lawrence accompanied him to the drawing-room, and as I learned later,
  provided the official party with refreshment, and when we were alone I turned
  to Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>'I suppose we have finished, too?'</p>

  <p>'Not quite,' he replied. 'There are one or two little matters to be
  attended to, but we will wait until the police are clear of the premises.
  They will keep their own counsel and I propose to keep mine, unless I can
  give them a straight lead.' He opened his research-case and was thoughtfully
  looking over its contents when Drayton returned and announced that the police
  had departed.</p>

  <p>'Is there anything more that you want to do, Thorndyke?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' was the reply. 'For one thing, I should like to see if there are
  any more fingerprints.' As he spoke, he pulled out the drawers of the cabinet
  one after the other, and examined the glass covers. But apparently they had
  not been touched. At any rate, there were no marks on any of the glasses.</p>

  <p>'They must have been disturbed soon after they got to work,' said Drayton
  'as they opened only two drawers.'</p>

  <p>'Probably,' Thorndyke agreed, taking from his case a little glass-jar
  filled with a yellowish powder and fitted with two glass tubes and a rubber
  bulb. With this apparatus he blew a cloud of the fine powder over the
  woodwork of the rifled cabinet, and when a thin coating had settled on the
  polished surface, he tapped the wood gently with the handle of his
  pocket-knife. At each tap a portion of the coating of powder was jarred on
  the surface, and then there appeared several oval spots to which it still
  adhered. Then he gently blew away the rest of the powder, when the oval spots
  were revealed as fingerprints, standing out white and distinct against the
  dark wood. Thorndyke now produced from his pocket the hinged board, and
  opening it, compared the photographs with these new fingerprints, while
  Drayton and I looked over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>'They are undoubtedly the same,' said I, a little surprised at the ease
  with which I identified these curious markings. 'Absolutely the
  same&mdash;which is rather odd, seeing that there are the marks of only two
  digits of the left hand and four of the right. It almost looks as if those
  particular fingers had got soiled with some greasy material and that the
  other fingers were clean and had left no mark.'</p>

  <p>'An admirable suggestion, Anstey,' said Thorndyke. 'The same idea had
  occurred to me, for the prints of these particular fingers are certainly
  abnormally distinct. Let us see if we can get any confirmation.' He blew upon
  each of the fingerprints in turn until most of the powder was dislodged and
  the markings had become almost invisible. Then, taking my handkerchief, which
  was of soft silk, and rolling it into a ball, he began to wipe the woodwork
  with a circular motion, at first very lightly but gradually increasing the
  pressure until he was rubbing quite vigorously. The result seemed to justify
  my suggestion, for as the rubbing proceeded, I could see, by the light of
  Drayton's lamp, thrown on at various angles, that the fingerprints seemed to
  have spread out into oval, glistening patches, having a lustre somewhat
  different from that of the polished wood.</p>

  <p>Sir Lawrence looked on with keen interest, and as Thorndyke paused to
  examine the woodwork, he asked: 'What is the exact purpose of this
  experiment?'</p>

  <p>'The point is,' replied Thorndyke, 'that whereas the fingerprint of the
  mathematical theorists is a mere abstraction of form devoid of any other
  properties, the actual or real fingerprint is a material thing which has
  physical and chemical properties, and these properties may have considerable
  evidential significance. These fingerprints, for instance, contain some
  substance other than the natural secretions of the skin. The questions then
  arise, What is that substance? How came it here? And is it usually associated
  with any particular kind of person or activity? The specimens that Anstey so
  judiciously captured may help us to answer the first question, and our native
  wits may enable us to answer the others. So we have some data for
  consideration. And that reminds me that there are some other data that we
  must secure.'</p>

  <p>'What are they?' Drayton asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>'There are those impressions in the sand outside the fence. I must have
  permanent records of them. Shall we go and do them now? I shall want a jug of
  water and a light.'</p>

  <p>While Drayton went to fetch the water Thorndyke and I took our way out
  through the garden to the outside of the fence, he carrying his
  research-case, and I bearing Drayton's lamp. At the spot where we had laid
  down the mat we halted, and Thorndyke, having set down his case, once more
  lifted the mat.</p>

  <p>'They are small feet,' he remarked, glancing at the footprints before
  stooping to open the case. 'A striking contrast to the other man's.'</p>

  <p>He took from his case a tin of plaster of Paris, and dipping up a small
  quantity in a spoon, proceeded very carefully to dust the footprints with the
  fine, white powder until they were covered with a thin, even coating. Then he
  produced a bottle of water fitted with a rubber ball-spray diffuser, and with
  this blew a copious spray of water over the footprints. As a result, the
  white powder gradually shrank until the footprints looked as if they had
  received a thin coat of whitewash.</p>

  <p>'Why not fill the footprints up with liquid plaster?' asked Drayton, who
  came up at this moment carrying a large jug.</p>

  <p>'It would probably disturb the sand,' was the reply, 'and moreover, the
  water would soak in at once and leave the plaster a crumbling mass. But when
  this thin layer has set it will be possible to fill up and get a solid
  cast.'</p>

  <p>He repeated the application of the spray once or twice, and then we went
  on to the place where the other man had come over. Here the same process was
  carried out, not only with the footprints but also with those of the hands.
  Then we went back to the first place, and when Thorndyke had gently touched
  the edge of the footprints and ascertained that the thin coating of plaster
  had set into a solid shell, he produced a small rubber basin, and having half
  filled it with water, added a quantity of plaster and stirred it until it
  assumed the consistency of cream; when he carefully poured it into the
  white-coated footprints until they were full and slightly overflowing.</p>

  <p>'You see the advantage of this?' said Thorndyke as he cleaned out the
  basin and started to walk slowly back to the site of the second set of
  prints.</p>

  <p>'I do, indeed,' replied Drayton, 'and I am astonished that Badger did not
  take a permanent record. These casts will enable you to put the actual feet
  of the accused in evidence if need be.'</p>

  <p>'Precisely; besides giving us the opportunity to study them at our
  leisure, and refer to them if any fresh evidence should become
  available.'</p>

  <p>The second set of footprints and the impressions of the hands received
  similar treatment, and when they had been filled, Thorndyke proceeded to pack
  up his appliances.</p>

  <p>'We ought to give the casts a good twenty minutes to set hard,' he said,
  'though it is the best plaster and quite fresh and has a little powdered alum
  mixed with it to accelerate setting and make the cast harder. But we mustn't
  be impatient.'</p>

  <p>'I am in no hurry,' said Drayton. 'I shall stay here tonight&mdash;one
  couldn't leave Mrs Benham in the house all alone. The car can take you back
  to your chambers and drop Anstey at his lodgings.</p>

  <p>'Tomorrow we must make some arrangements of a more permanent kind. But the
  great thing is to get on the track of these two villains. Nothing else seems
  to matter. There is my poor brother's corpse, crying aloud to Heaven for
  justice, and I shall never rest until his murderers have paid their
  debt.'</p>

  <p>'I sympathise with you most cordially, Drayton,' said Thorndyke, 'and it
  is no mere verbal sympathy. I promise you that every resource at my disposal
  shall be called in to aid, that no stone shall be left unturned. It is not
  only the office of friendship; it is a public duty to ensure that an
  inexcusable crime of this kind shall be visited with the most complete
  retribution.'</p>

  <p>'Thank you. Thorndyke,' Sir Lawrence said with gruff earnestness. And then
  after a short pause, he continued: 'I suppose it is premature to ask you, but
  do you see any glimmer of hope? Is there anything to lay hold of? I can see
  for myself that it is a very difficult and obscure case.'</p>

  <p>'It is,' Thorndyke agreed. 'Of course the fingerprints may dispose of the
  whole difficulty, if they happen to be on the files at the Habitual Criminals
  Registry. Otherwise there is very little evidence. Still, there is some, and
  we may build up more by inference. I have seen more unpromising cases come to
  a successful issue.'</p>

  <p>By this time the stipulated twenty minutes had expired, and we proceeded
  to the first set of footprints. The plaster, on being tested, was found to be
  quite firm and hard, and Thorndyke was able, with great care, to lift the two
  chalky-looking plates from their bed in the ground. And even in the rather
  unfavourable light of the lamp their appearance was somewhat startling, for,
  as Thorndyke turned them over, each cast presented the semblance of a white
  foot, surprisingly complete in detail so far as the sole was concerned.</p>

  <p>But if the appearance of these casts was striking, much more so was that
  of the second set; for the latter included casts of the handprints, the
  aspect of which was positively uncanny, especially in the case of the deeper
  impression, the effect of which was that of a snowy hand with outspread,
  crooked, clutching fingers. And here again the fine loam had yielded an
  unexpected amount of detail. The creases and markings of the palm were all
  perfectly clear and distinct, and I even thought that I could perceive a
  trace of the ridges of the fingertips.</p>

  <p>Before leaving the spot we carefully removed all traces of plaster, for it
  was certain that the footprints would be examined by daylight, and Thorndyke
  considered it better that the existence of these casts should be known only
  to ourselves. The footprints were left practically intact, and it was open to
  the police to make casts if they saw fit.</p>

  <p>'I think,' said Thorndyke when we had re-entered the house and were
  inspecting the casts afresh as they lay on the table, 'it would be a wise
  precaution to attach our signatures to each of them, in case it should be
  necessary at any time to put them in evidence. Their genuineness would then
  be attested beyond any possibility of dispute.'</p>

  <p>To this Drayton and I agreed most emphatically, and accordingly each of us
  wrote his name, with the date, on the smooth back of each cast. Then the
  'records' were carefully packed and bestowed in the research-case, and
  Thorndyke and I shook our host's hand and went forth to the car.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch4"
     id="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; THE LADY OF SHALOTT</h2>

  <p class="first">The modern London suburb seems to have an inherent
  incapacity for attaining a decent old age. City streets and those of country
  towns contrive to gather from the passing years some quality of mellowness
  that does but add to their charm. But with suburbs it is otherwise. Whatever
  charm they have appertains to their garish youth and shares its ephemeral
  character. Cities and towns grow venerable with age, the suburb merely grows
  shabby.</p>

  <p>The above profound reflections were occasioned by my approach to the
  vicinity of Jacob Street, Hampstead Road, and by a growing sense of the
  drab&mdash;not to say sordid&mdash;atmosphere that enveloped it, and its
  incongruity with the appearance and manner of the lady whose residence I was
  approaching. However, I consoled myself with the consideration that if
  'Honesty lives in a poor house, like your fair pearl in your foul oyster,'
  perhaps Beauty might make shift with no better lodging; and these cogitations
  having brought me to the factory-like gateway, I gave a brisk tug at the bell
  above the brass plate.</p>

  <p>After a short interval the wicket was opened by my young acquaintance of
  the previous night, who greeted me with a sedate smile of recognition.</p>

  <p>'Good afternoon,' I said, holding out my hand. 'I have just called to
  learn how your sister is. I hope she is not much the worse for her rather
  terrifying experiences last night.'</p>

  <p>'Thank you,' he replied with quaint politeness, 'she seems to be all right
  today. But the doctor won't let her do any work. He's fixed her arm in a
  sling. But won't you come in and see her, sir?'</p>

  <p>I hesitated, dubious as to whether she would care to receive a stranger of
  her own class in these rather mean surroundings, but when he added: 'She
  would like to see you, I am sure, sir,' my scruples gave way to my very
  definite inclination and I stepped through the wicket.</p>

  <p>My young friend&mdash;who wore a blue linen smock&mdash;conducted me down
  a paved passage, the walls of which bore each a long shelf on which was a row
  of plaster busts and statuettes, into an open yard in which a small, elderly
  man was working with chisel and mallet on a somewhat ornate marble tombstone,
  amidst a sort of miniature Avebury of blocks and slabs of stone and marble.
  Across the yard rose a great barn-like building with one enormous window high
  up the wall, a great double door, and a small side door. Into the latter my
  conductor entered and held it open for me, and as I passed in, I found myself
  in total darkness. Only for a moment, however, for my young host, having shut
  the door, drew aside a heavy curtain and gave me a view of huge, bare hall
  with lofty, whitewashed walls, an open timber roof, and a plank floor
  relieved from absolute nakedness by one or two rugs. A couple of studio
  easels stood opposite the window, and in a corner I observed a spectral
  lay-figure shrouded in what looked like a sheet. At the farther end, by a
  large, open fireplace, Miss Blake sat in an easy-chair with a book in her
  hand. She looked up as I entered, and then rose and advanced to meet me,
  holding out her left hand.</p>

  <p>'How kind of you, Mr Anstey, to come and see me!' she exclaimed. 'And how
  good it was of you to take such care of me last night!'</p>

  <p>'Not at all,' I replied. 'But I hope you are not very much the worse for
  your adventures. Are you suffering much pain?'</p>

  <p>'I have no pain at all,' she replied with a smile, 'and I don't believe
  this sling is in the least necessary. But one must obey the doctor's
  orders.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' interposed her brother, 'and that is what the sling is for. To
  prevent you from getting into mischief, Winnie.'</p>

  <p>'It prevents me from doing any work, if that is what you mean, Percy,'
  said she, 'and I suppose the doctor is right in that.'</p>

  <p>'I am sure he is,' said I. 'Rest is most essential to enable the wound to
  heal quickly. What sort of night did you have?'</p>

  <p>'I didn't sleep much,' she replied. 'It kept coming back to me, you
  know&mdash;that awful moment when I went into the museum and saw that poor
  man lying on the floor. It was a dreadful experience. So horribly sudden,
  too. One moment I saw him go away, full of life and energy, and the next I
  was looking on his corpse. Do you think those wretches will really
  escape?'</p>

  <p>'It is difficult to say. The police have the fingerprints of one of them,
  and if that person is a regular criminal, they will be able to identify
  him.'</p>

  <p>'Will they really?' she exclaimed. 'It sounds very wonderful. How are they
  able to do it?'</p>

  <p>'It is really quite simple. When a man is convicted of a crime, a complete
  set of his fingerprints is taken at the prison by pressing his fingers on an
  inked slab and putting them down on a sheet of paper&mdash;there is a special
  form for the purpose with a space for each finger. This form is deposited,
  with photographs of the prisoner, in one of the files of the Habitual
  Criminals Registry at Scotland Yard. Then, when a strange fingerprint turns
  up, it is compared with those in the files, and if one is found that is an
  exact facsimile, the name attached to it is the name of the man who is
  wanted.'</p>

  <p>'But how are they ever able to find the facsimile in such a huge
  collection, for the numbers in the files must be enormous?'</p>

  <p>'That also is more simple than it looks. The lines on fingertips form very
  definite patterns-spirals, or whorls, closed loops like the end grain of
  wood, open curves, or arches, and so on. Now each fingerprint is filed under
  its particular heading&mdash;whorl, loop, arch, etc.&mdash;and also in
  accordance with the particular finger that bears the pattern, so the inquiry
  is narrowed down to a comparatively small number from the start. Let us take
  an instance. Suppose we have found some fingerprints of which the left little
  finger has a spiral pattern and the ring finger adjoining has a closed loop.
  Then we look in the file which contains the spiral left little fingers and in
  the file of looped left ring fingers, and we glance through the lists of
  names. There will be certain names that will appear in both lists, and one of
  those will be the name of the man that we want. All that remains is to
  compare our prints with each of them in turn until we come to the one that is
  an exact facsimile. The name attached to that one is the name of our man. Of
  course, in practice, the process is more elaborate, but that is the
  principle.'</p>

  <p>'It is wonderfully ingenious,' said Miss Blake, 'and really simple, as you
  say, and it sounds as if it were perfectly infallible.'</p>

  <p>'That is the claim that the police make. But, as you see, the utility of
  the system for the detection of crime is limited to the cases of those
  criminals whose fingerprints have been registered. That is what our chance
  depends on now. The man who murdered Mr Drayton left prints of his fingers on
  the glass of the cabinet, and the police have taken the glass away to
  examine. If they find facsimiles of those fingerprints in the register, then
  they will know who murdered Mr Drayton. But if those fingerprints are not in
  the register, they won't help us at all. And as far as I know, there is no
  other clue to the identity of the murderer.'</p>

  <p>Miss Blake appeared to reflect earnestly on what I had said, and in the
  ensuing silence I continued my somewhat furtive observation of the great
  studio and its occupants. Particularly did I notice a number of paintings,
  apparently executed in tempera on huge sheets of brown paper, pinned on the
  walls somewhat above the level of the eye; figure subjects of an allegorical
  character, strongly recalling the manner of Burne-Jones, and painted with
  something considerably beyond ordinary competence. And from the paintings my
  eye strayed to the painter&mdash;as I assumed and hoped her to be&mdash;and a
  very striking and picturesque figure she appeared, with her waxen complexion,
  delicately tinged with pink, her earnest grey eyes, a short, slightly
  retrousse nose, the soft mass of red-gold hair and the lissom form, actually
  full and plump though with the deceptive appearance of slimness that one
  notes in the figures of the artist whose style she followed. I noted with
  pleasure&mdash;not wholly aesthetic, I suspect&mdash;the graceful pose into
  which she seemed naturally to fall, and when my roving eye took in a
  'planchette' hanging on the wall and a crystal ball reposing on a black
  velvet cushion on a little altar-like table in a corner, I forbore to scoff
  inwardly as I should have done in other circumstances, for somehow the hint
  of occultism, even of superstition, seemed not out of character. She reminded
  me of the Lady of Shalott, and the whispered suggestion of Merlinesque magic
  gave a note of harmony that sounded pleasantly.</p>

  <p>While we had been talking, her brother had been pursuing his own affairs
  with silent concentration, though I had noticed that he had paused to listen
  to my exposition on the subject of fingerprints. In the middle of the studio
  floor was a massive stone slab&mdash;a relic of some former sculptor
  tenant&mdash;and on this the boy was erecting, very methodically, a model of
  some sort of building with toy bricks of a kind that I had not seen before. I
  was watching him and noting the marked difference between him and his
  sister&mdash;for he was a somewhat dark lad with a strong, aquiline
  face&mdash;when Miss Blake spoke again.</p>

  <p>'Did you find out what had been stolen?'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' I answered, 'approximately. There was nothing missing of any
  considerable value. Only a few pieces had been taken, and those were mostly
  simple jewels set with moonstones or cat's eyes.'</p>

  <p>'Cat's eyes!' she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>'Yes, a few posy-rings, some earrings, and I think, one pendant.'</p>

  <p>'Was the pendant stolen?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, apparently. Sir Lawrence mentioned a cat's-eye pendant as one of the
  things that he missed from the drawer. Does the pendant interest you
  specially?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.' she answered thoughtfully, 'it was this pendant that I went there
  to see. It was illustrated in the Connoisseur article, and I wrote to poor Mr
  Drayton because I wanted to examine it. And so,' she added in a lower tone
  and with an expression of deep sadness, 'the pendant became, through me, the
  cause of his death. But for it and me, he would not have gone to the house at
  that time.'</p>

  <p>'It is impossible to say whether he would or not,' said I, and then, to
  change the subject, as this seemed to distress her, I continued: 'there was
  another thing missing that was figured in the Connoisseur&mdash;a
  locket&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Of course!' she exclaimed. 'How silly of me to forget it.' She rose
  hastily, and stepping over to an old walnut bureau that stood under the
  window, pulled out one of the little drawers and picked some small object out
  of it.</p>

  <p>'There,' she said, holding out her hand, in which lay a small gold locket,
  'this is the one. I recognised it instantly. And now see if you can guess how
  it came into my possession.'</p>

  <p>I was completely mystified, and said so, though I hazarded a guess that it
  had in some way caught in her clothing.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said she, 'it was in my shawl. You remember I said that the man
  whom I was trying to hold had something in his hand and that he must have
  dropped it when he drew his knife. Now it happened that my shawl had just
  then slipped off in the struggle and that he was standing on it. The locket
  must have dropped on the shawl, and this little brass hook, which some one
  has fastened to the ring of the locket, must have hooked itself into the
  meshes of the shawl&mdash;which is of crocheted silk, you will remember. Then
  you picked the shawl up and rolled it into a bundle, and it was never
  unrolled until this morning. When I shook it out to hang it up, the locket
  fell out, and most unfortunately, as it fell it opened and the glass inside
  got broken. I am most vexed about it, for it is such an extremely charming
  little thing. Don't you think so?'</p>

  <p>I took the little bauble in my hand, and, to speak the literal truth, was
  not deeply smitten with its appearance. But policy, and the desire to make
  myself agreeable, bade me dissemble. 'It is a quaint and curious little
  object,' I admitted.</p>

  <p>'It is a perfectly fascinating little thing,' she exclaimed
  enthusiastically. 'And so secret and mysterious, too. I am sure there is some
  hidden meaning in those references inside, and then there is something
  delightfully cabalistic and magical about that weird-looking inscription on
  the front.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' I agreed, 'Greek capitals make picturesque inscriptions, especially
  this uncial form of lettering, but there is nothing very recondite in the
  matter; in fact it is rather hackneyed. "Life is short but Art is long.
  "'</p>

  <p>'So that is what it means. Percy couldn't quite make it out, and I don't
  know any Greek at all. But it is a beautiful motto, though I am not sure that
  I don't prefer the more usual form, "Art is long but Life is short."'</p>

  <p>'That is the Latin version, "Ars longa, Vita brevis". Yes, I think I agree
  with you. The Latin form is rather more epigrammatic. But what other
  inscription were you referring to?'</p>

  <p>'There are some references to passages of Scripture inside. I have looked
  them out, all but one. Shall I get my notes and let you see what the
  references are?' She looked at me so expectantly and with such charming
  animation that I assented eagerly. Not that I cared particularly what the
  references were, but the occupation of looking them out promised to put us on
  a delightfully companionable footing. And if I was not profoundly interested
  in the locket, I found myself very deeply interested in the Lady of
  Shalott.</p>

  <p>While she was searching for her notes, I examined the little bauble more
  closely. It was a simple trinket, well made and neatly finished. The
  workmanship was plain, though very solid, and I judged it to be of some
  considerable age, though not what one would call antique. It was fashioned in
  the form of a tiny book with a hinge at the back and a strong loop of gold on
  each half, the two loops forming a double suspension ring. To one of the
  loops a small brass hook had been attached, probably to hang it in a
  show-case. On the front was engraved in bold Greek uncials 'O BIOC BPAXYO H
  AE TEXNH MAKPH' without any other ornament, and on turning the locket over I
  found the back&mdash;or under-side as a bookbinder would say&mdash;quite
  plain save for the hallmark near the top. Then I opened the little volume. In
  the back half was a circular cell, framed with a border of small pearls and
  containing a tiny plait of black hair coiled into a close spiral. It had been
  enclosed by a glass cover, but this was broken and only a few fragments
  remained. The interior of the front half was covered with extremely minute
  engraved lettering which, on close inspection, appeared to be references to
  certain passages of Holy Scripture, the titles of the books being given in
  Latin.</p>

  <p>I had just concluded these observations when Miss Blake returned with a
  manuscript book, a Bible, and a small reading-glass.</p>

  <p>'This,' she said, handing me the latter, 'will help you to make out the
  tiny lettering. If you will read out the references one at a time, I will
  read out the passages that they refer to. And if any of them suggest to you
  any meaning beyond what is apparent, do, please, tell me, for I can make
  nothing of them.'</p>

  <p>I promised to do so, and focusing the glass on the microscopic writing,
  read out the first reference: "Leviticus 25. 41."</p>

  <p>'That verse,' she said, 'reads: "And then shall he depart from thee, both
  he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto
  the possession of his fathers shall he return."'</p>

  <p>'The next reference,' said I, 'is "Psalms 121. 1."'</p>

  <p>'The reading is: "I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence
  cometh my help." What do you make of that?'</p>

  <p>'Nothing,' I replied, 'unless one can regard it as a pious exhortation,
  and it is extraordinarily indefinite at that.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, it does seem vague, but I feel convinced that it means more than it
  seems to, if we could only fathom its significance.'</p>

  <p>'It might easily do that,' said I, and as I spoke I caught the eye of her
  brother, who had paused in his work and was watching us with an indulgent
  smile, and I wondered egotistically if he was writing me down a consummate
  ass.</p>

  <p>'The next,' said I, 'is "Acts 10. 5."'</p>

  <p>'The reading is: "And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose
  surname is Peter."'</p>

  <p>'I begin to think you must be right,' said I, 'for that passage is sheer
  nonsense unless it covers something in the nature of a code. Taken by itself,
  it has not the faintest bearing on either doctrine or morals. Let us try the
  next one, "Nehemiah 8. 4."'</p>

  <p>'That one is just as cryptic as the others,' said she. 'It reads: "And
  Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the
  purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijali,
  and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah,
  and Mishad, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, and
  Meshullam."'</p>

  <p>At this point an audible snigger proceeding from the direction of the
  builder revived my misgivings. There is something slightly alarming about a
  schoolboy with an acute perception of the ridiculous.</p>

  <p>'What is the joke, Percy?' his sister asked.</p>

  <p>'Those fellows' names, Winnie. Do you suppose there really was a chap
  called Hashed Banana?'</p>

  <p>'Hashbadana, Percy,' she corrected.</p>

  <p>'Very well. Hashed Badada then. But that only makes it worse. Sounds as if
  you'd got a cold.'</p>

  <p>'What an absurd boy you are, Percy,' exclaimed Miss Blake, regarding her
  brother with a fond smile. Then, reverting to her notes, she said: 'The next
  reference appears to be a mistake, at least I don't understand it. It says "3
  Kings 7. 41." Isn't that so?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. "3 Lib. Regum 7. 41." But what is wrong with it?'</p>

  <p>'Why, there are only two Books of Kings.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, I see. But it isn't a mistake. In the Authorised Version the two
  books of Samuel have the alternative title of the First and Second Books of
  Kings, and the First Book of Kings has the subtitle "Commonly called the
  Third Book of the Kings." But at the present day the books are invariably
  referred to as the First and Second Books of Samuel and the First and Second
  Books of Kings. Shall we look it up?'</p>

  <p>She opened the Bible and turned over the leaves to the First Book of
  Kings.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' she said, 'it is as you say. How odd that I should never have
  noticed it, or at any rate, not have remembered it. Then this reference is
  really "1 Kings 7. 41." And yet it can't be. What sense can you possibly make
  of this: "The two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on
  the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of
  the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars." It seems quite
  meaningless, separated from its context.'</p>

  <p>'It certainly is rather enigmatical,' I agreed. 'This is an excerpt from
  what was virtually an inventory of Solomon's Temple. If the purpose of this
  collection of Scripture texts was to inculcate some religious or moral
  truths, I don't see the bearing of this quotation at all. But we may take it
  that these passages had some meaning to the original owner of the
  locket.'</p>

  <p>'They must have had,' she replied earnestly. 'Perhaps we may be able to
  find the key to the riddle if we consider the whole series together.'</p>

  <p>'Possibly,' I agreed, not very enthusiastically. 'The next reference is
  "Psalms 31. 7."'</p>

  <p>'The verse is: "I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast
  considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities."'</p>

  <p>'That doesn't throw much light on the subject,' said I. 'The last
  reference is "2 Timothy 4. 13."'</p>

  <p>'It reads: "The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest,
  bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments."' She laid
  down her notes, and looking at me with the most intense gravity, exclaimed:
  'Isn't that extraordinary? It is the most astonishing of them all. You see,
  it is perfectly trivial, just a message from St Paul to Timothy on a purely
  personal matter of no importance to anybody but himself. But the whole
  collection of texts is very odd. They seem utterly unconnected with one
  another, and, as you say, without any significance in respect of either faith
  or morals. What is your opinion of them?'</p>

  <p>'I don't know what to think,' I replied. 'They may have had some
  significance to the original owner of the locket only, something personal and
  reminiscent. Or they may have been addressed to some other person in terms
  previously agreed on. That is to say, they may have formed something in the
  nature of a code.'</p>

  <p>'Exactly,' she agreed eagerly. 'That is what I think. And I am just
  devoured by curiosity as to what the message was that they were meant to
  convey. I shan't rest until I have solved the mystery.'</p>

  <p>I smiled, and again my glance wandered to the planchette on the wall and
  the crystal ball on the table. Evidently my new and charming friend was an
  inveterate mystic, an enthusiastic explorer of the dubious regions of the
  occult and the supernormal. And though my own matter-of-fact temperament
  engendered little sympathy with such matters, I found in this very mysticism
  an additional charm. It seemed entirely congruous with her eminently
  picturesque personality.</p>

  <p>But at this moment I became suddenly aware that I had made a most
  outrageously long visit and rose with profuse apologies for my disregard of
  time.</p>

  <p>'There is no need to apologise,' she assured me cordially. 'It is most
  kind of you to have given so much time to a mere counterfeit invalid. But
  won't you stay and have tea with us? Can't you really? Well, I hope you will
  come and see us again when you can spare an hour. Oh, and hadn't I better
  give you this locket to hand to Sir Lawrence Drayton?'</p>

  <p>'Certainly not,' I replied. 'You had better keep it until you see him, and
  perhaps in the interval you may be able to extract its secret. But I will
  tell him that it is in safe hands.' I shook her hand warmly, and when I had
  made a brief inspection of Master Percy's building, that promising architect
  piloted me across the yard and finally launched me, with a hearty farewell
  and a cordial invitation to 'come again soon,' into the desert expanse of
  Jacob Street.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch5"
     id="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; MR HALLIBURTON'S MASCOT</h2>

  <p class="first">Emerging into the grey and cheerless street I sauntered
  towards the Hampstead Road, and having reached that thoroughfare, halted at
  the corner and looked at my watch. It was barely four o'clock, and as I had
  arranged to meet Thorndyke at the Euston Road corner at half-past four, I had
  half an hour in which to cover something less than half a mile. I began to be
  regretful that I had refused the proffered tea, and when my leisurely
  progress brought me to the door of an establishment in which that beverage
  was dispensed, I entered and called for refreshment.</p>

  <p>And as I sat by the shabby little marble-topped table, my thoughts strayed
  back to the great bare studio in Jacob Street and the strange, enigmatical
  but decidedly alluring personality of its tenant. To say that I had been
  favourably impressed by her would be to understate the case. I found myself
  considering her with a degree of interest and admiration that no other woman
  had ever aroused in me. She was&mdash;or, at least, she appeared to
  me&mdash;a strikingly beautiful girl, but that was not the whole, or even the
  main, attraction. Her courage and strength of character, as shown in the
  tragic circumstances of the previous night; her refinement of manner and
  easy, well-bred courtesy, her intelligence and evident amiability, and her
  frank friendliness, without any sacrifice of dignity, had all combined to
  make her personality gracious and pleasant. Then there were the paintings. If
  they were her work, she was an artist of some talent. I had meant cautiously
  to inquire into that, but the investigation of the locket had excluded
  everything else. And the thought of the locket and the almost childish
  eagerness that she had shown to extract its (assumed) secret, led naturally
  to the planchette and the crystal globe. In general I was disposed to scoff
  at such things, but on her the mysticism and occultism&mdash;I would not call
  it superstition&mdash;seemed to settle naturally and to add a certain
  piquancy to her mediaeval grace. And so reflecting, I suddenly bethought me
  of the cat's eye pendant. What was the nature of her interest in that? At
  first I had assumed that she was a connoisseur in jewels, and possibly I was
  right. But her curious interest in the locket suggested other possibilities,
  and into these I determined to inquire on my next visit&mdash;for I had
  already decided that the friendly invitations should not find me
  unresponsive. In short, the Lady of Shalott had awakened in me a very lively
  curiosity.</p>

  <p>My speculations and reflections very effectively filled out the spare
  half-hour and brought me on the stroke of half-past four to the corner of the
  Euston Road; and I had barely arrived when I perceived the tall, upright
  figure of my colleague swinging easily up Tottenham Court Road. In a few
  moments he joined me, and we both turned our faces westward.</p>

  <p>'We needn't hurry,' said he. 'I said I would be there at five.'</p>

  <p>'I don't quite understand what you are going for,' said I. 'This man,
  Halliburton, seems to have been no more than a chance stranger. What do you
  expect to get out of him?'</p>

  <p>'I have nothing definite in my mind,' he replied. 'The whole case is in
  the air at present. The position is this: a murder has been committed and the
  murderers have got away almost without leaving a trace. If the fingerprint
  people cannot identify the one man, we may say that we have no clue to the
  identity of either. But that murder had certain antecedents. Halliburton's
  visit was one of them, though there was probably no causal relation.'</p>

  <p>'You don't suspect Halliburton?'</p>

  <p>'My dear fellow, I suspect nobody. We haven't got as far as that. But we
  have to investigate every thing, person, or circumstance that makes the
  smallest contact with the crime. But here is our destination, and I need not
  remark, Anstey, that our purpose is to acquire information, not to give
  it.'</p>

  <p>The 'Baltic' Hotel was a large private house not far from the Great
  Central Station, distinguished from other private houses only by an open
  street door and by the name inconspicuously inscribed on the fanlight. As we
  ascended the steps and entered the hall, a short, pleasant-faced man emerged
  from an office and looked inquiringly from one of us to the other. 'Dr
  Thorndyke?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' replied my colleague, 'and I assume that you are the manager, Mr
  Simpson. I must thank you for making the appointment and hope I am not
  inconveniencing you.'</p>

  <p>'Not at all,' rejoined the other. 'I know your name very well, sir, and
  shall be delighted to give you any assistance that I can. I understand that
  you want Mr Halliburton's address.'</p>

  <p>'If you have no objection, I should like to have it. I want to write to
  him.'</p>

  <p>'I can give it to you off-hand,' said the manager. 'It is "Oscar
  Halliburton, Esquire, Wimbledon."'</p>

  <p>'That doesn't seem a very sufficient address,' remarked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>'It is not,' said the manager. 'I had occasion to write to him myself and
  my letter was returned, marked "insufficiently addressed."'</p>

  <p>'Then, in effect, you have not got his address?'</p>

  <p>'That is what it amounts to. Would you like to see the visitors' book? If
  you will step into my private office I will bring it to you.'</p>

  <p>He showed us into his office, and in a few moments entered with the book,
  which he laid on the table and opened at the page on which the signature
  appeared.</p>

  <p>'This does not appear to have been written with the hotel pen,' Thorndyke
  remarked when he had glanced at the adjoining signatures.</p>

  <p>'No,' the manager agreed. 'Apparently he used his own fountain pen.'</p>

  <p>'I see that this entry is dated the 13th of September. How long did he
  stay?'</p>

  <p>'He left on the 16th of September&mdash;five days ago.'</p>

  <p>'And he received at least one letter while he was here?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, one only, I believe. It came on the morning of the 16th, I remember,
  and he left in the evening.'</p>

  <p>'Do you know if he went out much while he was here?'</p>

  <p>'No, he stayed indoors nearly all day, and he spent most of his time in
  the billiard-room practising fancy strokes.'</p>

  <p>'What sort of man was he&mdash;in appearance, for instance?'</p>

  <p>'Well,' said Simpson rather hesitatingly, 'I didn't see much of him, and I
  see a good many people. I should say he was a biggish man, medium colour and
  rather sunburnt.'</p>

  <p>'Any beard or moustache?'</p>

  <p>'No, clean shaved and a good deal of hair&mdash;rather long, wanted a
  crop.'</p>

  <p>'Any distinctive accent or peculiarity of voice?'</p>

  <p>'I didn't have much talk with him&mdash;nor did anybody else, I think. He
  was a gruffish, taciturn man. Nothing peculiar about his voice, and as to his
  accent, well, it was just ordinary, very ordinary, with perhaps just a trace
  of the cockney, but only a trace. It wasn't exactly the accent of an English
  gentleman.'</p>

  <p>'And that is all that you remember about him?'</p>

  <p>'That is all.'</p>

  <p>'Would you have any objection to my taking a photograph of this
  signature?'</p>

  <p>The manager looked rather dubious. 'It would hardly do for it to be
  known&mdash;' he began, when Thorndyke interrupted:</p>

  <p>'I suggest, Mr Simpson, that whatever passes between us shall be regarded
  as strictly confidential on both sides. The least said, the soonest mended,
  you know.'</p>

  <p>'There's a good deal of truth in that; said the manager with a smile,
  'especially in the hotel business. Well, if that is understood, I don't know
  that I have any objection to your taking a photograph. But how are you going
  to manage it?'</p>

  <p>'I have a camera; replied Thorndyke, 'and I see that your table lamp is a
  sixty Watt. It won't take an unreasonably long exposure.'</p>

  <p>He propped the book up in a suitable position, and having arranged the
  lamp so as to illuminate the page obliquely, produced from his pocket a small
  folding camera and a leather case of dark slides, at which Mr Simpson gazed
  in astonishment. 'You'll never get a useful photograph with a toy like that,'
  said he.</p>

  <p>'Not such a toy as you think,' replied Thorndyke as he opened the little
  instrument. 'This lens is specially constructed for close range work, and
  will give me the signature the full size of the original.' He laid a
  measuring tape on the table, and having adjusted the camera by its engraved
  scale, inserted the dark slide, looked at his watch, and opened the
  shutter.</p>

  <p>'You were saying just now, Mr Simpson,' he resumed as we sat round the
  table watching the camera, 'that you had occasion to write to Mr Halliburton.
  Should I be indiscreet if I were to ask what the occasion was?'</p>

  <p>'Not at all,' replied the manager. 'It was a ridiculous affair. It seems
  that Mr Halliburton had a sort of charm or mascot which he wore suspended by
  a gold ring from a cord under his waistcoat; a silly little bone thing, of no
  value whatever, though he appears to have set great store by it. Well, after
  he had left the hotel he missed it. The ring had broken and the thing had
  dropped off the cord&mdash;presumably, he supposed, when he was undressing.
  So a couple of days later&mdash;on the eighteenth&mdash;back he came in a
  rare twitter to know if it had been picked up. I asked the chambermaids if
  any of them had found the mascot in his room or elsewhere, but none of them
  had. Then he was frightfully upset and begged me to ask them again and to say
  that he would give ten pounds to any one who should have found it and would
  hand it to him. Ten pounds!' Mr Simpson repeated with contemptuous emphasis.
  'Just think of it! The price of a gold watch for a thing that looked like a
  common rabbit bone! Why, a man like that oughtn't to be at large.'</p>

  <p>I could see that my colleague was deeply interested, though his impassive
  face suggested nothing but close attention. He put away his watch, closed the
  lens-shutter and the dark slide, and finally bestowed the little apparatus in
  his pocket. Then he asked the manager: 'Can you give us anything like a
  detailed description of this mascot?'</p>

  <p>'I can show you the thing itself,' replied Simpson. 'That is the irony of
  the affair. Mr Halliburton hadn't been out of the house half an hour when the
  boy who looks after the billiard-room came bursting into my office in the
  devil's own excitement. He had heard of the ten pounds reward and had
  proceeded at once to take up all the rugs and mats in the billiard-room, and
  there, under the edge of a strip of cocoa-nut matting, he had found the
  precious thing. No doubt the ring had broken when Halliburton was leaning
  over the table to make a long shot. So I took it from the boy and put it in
  the safe, and I wrote forthwith to the address given in the book to say that
  the mascot had come to light, but, as I told you just now, the letter was
  returned marked "insufficiently addressed." So there it is, and unless he
  calls again, or writes, he won't get his mascot, and the boy won't get his
  ten pounds. Would you like to see the treasure?'</p>

  <p>'I should, very much,' replied Thorndyke; whereupon the manager stepped
  over to a safe in the corner of the room, and having unlocked it, came back
  to the table holding a small object in the palm of his hand.</p>

  <p>'There it is,' said he, dropping it on the table before Thorndyke, 'and I
  think you will agree with me that it is a mighty dear ten pounds' worth.'</p>

  <p>I looked curiously at the little object as my colleague turned it about in
  his hand. It was evidently a bone of some kind, roughly triangular in shape
  and perforated by three holes, one large and two smaller. In addition to
  these, a fourth hole had been drilled through near the apex to take a gold
  suspension ring, and this was still in position, though it was broken, having
  chafed quite thin with wear in one part and apparently given way under some
  sudden strain. The surface of the bone was covered with minute incised
  carving of a simple and rather barbaric type, and the whole bone had been
  stained a deep, yellowish brown, which had worn lighter in the parts most
  exposed to friction; and the entire surface had that unmistakable polish and
  patina that comes with years of handling and wear.</p>

  <p>'What do you make of it, sir?' asked Mr Simpson.</p>

  <p>'It is the neck bone of some small animal,' Thorndyke replied. 'But not a
  rabbit. And, of course, the markings on it give it an individual
  character.'</p>

  <p>'Would you give ten pounds for it?' the manager asked with a grin.</p>

  <p>'I am not sure that I wouldn't,' Thorndyke replied 'though not for its
  intrinsic value. But yours is not a "firm offer." You are not a vendor. But I
  should like very much to borrow it for a few hours.'</p>

  <p>'I don't quite see how I could agree to that,' said Simpson. 'You see, the
  thing isn't mine. I'm just a trustee. And Mr Halliburton might call and ask
  for it at any moment.'</p>

  <p>'I would give you a receipt for it and undertake to let you have it back
  by ten o'clock tomorrow morning,' said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>'M'yes,' said Simpson reflectively and with evident signs of weakening.
  'Of course, I could say I had deposited it at my bank. But is it of any
  importance? Would you mind telling me why you want to borrow the thing?'</p>

  <p>'I want to compare it carefully with some similar objects, the existence
  of which is known to me. I could do that tonight, and, if necessary, send the
  specimen back forthwith. As to the importance of the comparison, who can say?
  If Halliburton should turn up and give a practicable address there would be
  nothing in it. But if he should never reappear and it should become necessary
  to trace him, the information gathered from an exhaustive examination of this
  object might be of great value.'</p>

  <p>'I see,' said Simpson. 'In a sense it is a matter of public policy. Of
  course that puts a different complexion on the affair. And having regard to
  your position and character, I don't see why I shouldn't agree to your having
  a short loan of the thing. But I should like to have it back by nine o'clock
  tomorrow morning, if you could manage it.'</p>

  <p>'I promise you that it shall be delivered into your hand by a responsible
  person not later than nine o'clock,' said Thorndyke. 'I will now give you a
  receipt, which I will ask you to hand to my messenger in exchange for your
  property; and again, Mr Simpson, I would suggest that we make no confidences
  to anyone concerning this transaction.'</p>

  <p>To this the manager assented with decided emphasis, and our business being
  now concluded, we thanked Mr Simpson warmly for his courtesy and his very
  helpful attitude and took our departure.</p>

  <p>'You seem extraordinarily keen about that precious bone, Thorndyke,' I
  remarked as we walked back along the Marylebone Road, 'but I'm hanged if I
  see why. It won't tell you much about Halliburton. And if it would, I don't
  quite see what you want to know. He is obviously a fool. You don't need much
  investigation to ascertain that, and like most fools, he seems easily parted
  from his money. What more do you want to know?'</p>

  <p>'My learned friend,' replied Thorndyke, 'is not profiting sufficiently by
  his legal experience. One of the most vital principles that years of practice
  have impressed on me is that in the early stages of an inquiry, no fact,
  relevant or irrelevant, that is in any way connected with the subject of the
  inquiry should be neglected or ignored. Indeed, no such fact can be regarded
  as irrelevant, since, until all the data are assembled and collated, it is
  impossible to judge the bearing or value of any one of them.</p>

  <p>'Take the present case. Who is Mr Halliburton? We don't know. Why did he
  want to examine Mr Drayton's collection? We don't know. What passed between
  him and Mr Drayton when he made his visit? Again we don't know. Perhaps there
  is nothing of any significance to know. The probability is that Halliburton
  has no connection with this case at all. But there is no denying that he is
  in the picture.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, as a background figure. His name has been mentioned as one of the
  visitors who had come to see the collection. There were other visitors, you
  remember.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, and if we knew who they were we should want to know something about
  them, too. But Halliburton is the only one known to us. And your presentation
  of his position in relation to what has happened does not state the case
  fairly at all. The position is really this: Halliburton&mdash;a complete
  stranger to Drayton&mdash;took considerable trouble to obtain an opportunity
  to examine the collection. Why did he do this? You have quoted Mrs Benham as
  saying that he apparently knew nothing about jewellery, either ancient or
  modern. He was not a connoisseur. Then, why did he want to see the
  collection? Again, he wrote for the appointment, not from his own residence
  but from an hotel; and when we come to that hotel we find that he has left no
  verifiable address, and the vague locality that he gave may quite possibly be
  a false address. And further, that this apparent concealment of his place of
  abode coincides with a very excellent reason for giving a correct address,
  the fact that he has lost&mdash;and lost in the hotel, as he
  believes&mdash;certain property on which he sets a high value. And if you add
  to this the facts that within four days of his visit to Drayton the
  collection was robbed; that the robbers clearly knew exactly where it was
  kept and had some knowledge of the inmates of the house and their habits, you
  must admit that Halliburton is something more than a background figure in the
  picture.'</p>

  <p>I was secretly impressed by the way in which Thorndyke had 'placed' Mr
  Halliburton in respect of the inquiry, but, of course, it wouldn't do to say
  so. It was necessary to assert my position.</p>

  <p>'That,' I replied, 'is the case for the prosecution, and very persuasively
  stated. On the other hand it might be said for the defence: "Here is a
  gentleman who lives in the country and who comes up to spend a few days in
  town&mdash;"'</p>

  <p>'For the apparent purpose,' Thorndyke interrupted, 'of practising the art
  of billiards, a sport peculiar to London.'</p>

  <p>'Exactly. And while he is in London he takes the opportunity of inspecting
  a collection which has been described in the Press. A few days after his
  visit the collection is robbed by some persons who have probably also seen
  the published description. There is no positive fact of any kind that
  connects him with those persons, and I assert that the assumption that any
  such connection exists is entirely gratuitous.'</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled indulgently. 'It seems a pity,' he remarked, 'that my
  learned friend should waste the sweetness of his jury flourishes on the
  desert air of Marylebone Road. But we needn't fash ourselves, as I believe
  they say in the North. There was a lady named Mrs Glasse whose advice to
  cooks seems to be applicable to the present case. We had better catch our
  hare before we proceed to jug him&mdash;the word "jug" being used without any
  malicious intent to perpetrate a pun.'</p>

  <p>'And do I understand that the capture is to be accomplished by the agency
  of the rabbit-bone that my learned senior carries in his reverend
  pocket?'</p>

  <p>'If you do,' replied Thorndyke, 'your understanding is a good deal in
  advance of mine. I am taking this little object to examine merely on the
  remote chance that it may yield some information as to this man's
  antecedents, habits, and perhaps even his identity. The chance is not so
  remote as it looks. There are very few things which have been habitually
  carried on a man's person which will not tell you something about the person
  who has carried them. And this object, as you probably noticed, is in many
  respects highly characteristic.'</p>

  <p>'I can't say that I found the thing itself particularly characteristic.
  The fact that the man should have carried it and have set such a ridiculous
  value on it is illuminating. That writes him down a superstitious ass. But
  superstitious asses form a fairly large class. In what respects do you find
  this thing so highly characteristic, and what kind of information do you
  expect to extract from it?'</p>

  <p>'As to the latter question,' he replied, 'an investigator doesn't form
  expectations in advance; and as to the former, you will have an opportunity
  of examining the object for yourself and of forming your own
  conclusions.'</p>

  <p>I determined to make a minute and exhaustive inspection of our treasure
  trove as soon as we arrived home. For obviously I had missed something. It
  was clear to me that Thorndyke attached more importance to this object than
  would have been warranted by anything that I had observed. There was some
  point that I had overlooked and I meant to find out what it was.</p>

  <p>But the opportunity did not offer immediately, for, on our arrival at his
  chambers, Thorndyke proceeded straight up to the laboratory, where we found
  his assistant, Polton, seated at a jeweller's bench, making some structural
  alterations in a somewhat elaborate form of pedometer.</p>

  <p>'I've got a job for you, Polton,' said Thorndyke, laying the mascot on the
  bench. 'Quite a nice, delicate little job, after your own heart. I want a
  replica of this thing&mdash;as perfect as you can make it. And I have to
  return the original before nine o'clock tomorrow morning. And,' he added,
  taking the camera and dark slides from his pocket, 'there is a photograph to
  be developed, but there is no particular hurry for that.'</p>

  <p>Polton picked the mascot up daintily, and laying it in the palm of his
  hand, stuck a watchmaker's glass in his eye and inspected it minutely.</p>

  <p>'It's a queer little thing, sir,' he remarked. 'Seems to have been made
  out of a small cervical vertebra. I suppose you want the copy of the same
  colour as this and as hard as possible?'</p>

  <p>'I want as faithful a copy as you can make, similar in all respects,
  excepting that the reproduction can scarcely be as hard as the original. Will
  there be time to make a gelatine mould?'</p>

  <p>'There'll have to be, sir. It couldn't be done any other way, with these
  undercuttings. But I shan't lose any time on that. If I have to match the
  colour I shall have to make some experiments, and I can do those while the
  gelatine is setting.'</p>

  <p>'Very well, Polton,' said Thorndyke. 'Then I'll leave the thing in your
  hands and consider it as good as done. Of course the original must not be
  damaged in any way.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, certainly not, sir'; and forthwith the little man, having carefully
  deposited the mascot in a small, glass-topped box on the bench, fell to work
  on his preparations beaming with happiness. I have never seen a man who
  enjoyed his work so thoroughly as Polton did.</p>

  <p>'I am going round to the College of Surgeons now,' said Thorndyke. 'No
  callers are expected, I think, but if any one should come and want to see me,
  I shall be back in about an hour. Are you coming with me, Anstey?'</p>

  <p>'Why not? I've nothing to do, and if I keep an eye on you I may pick up a
  crumb or two of information.'</p>

  <p>Here I caught Polton's eye, and a queer, crinkly smile overspread that
  artificer's countenance. 'A good many people try to do that, sir,' he
  remarked. 'I hope you will have better luck than most of them have.'</p>

  <p>'It occurs to me' Thorndyke observed as we descended the stairs, 'that if
  the scribe who wrote the Book of Genesis had happened to look in on Polton he
  would have come to the conclusion that he had grossly overestimated the curse
  of labour.'</p>

  <p>'He was not much different from most other scribes,' said I. 'A bookish
  man&mdash;like myself, for instance&mdash;constantly fails to appreciate the
  joy of manual work. I find Polton an invaluable object lesson.'</p>

  <p>'So do I,' said Thorndyke. 'He is a shining example of the social
  virtues&mdash;industry, loyalty, integrity, and contentment&mdash;and as an
  artificer he is a positive genius.' With this warm appreciation of his
  faithful follower he swung round into Fleet Street and crossed towards the
  Law Courts.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch6"
     id="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; INTRODUCES AN ANT-EATER AND A DETECTIVE</h2>

  <p class="first">As we entered the hall of the College of Surgeons Thorndyke
  glanced at the board on which the names of the staff were painted and gave a
  little grunt of satisfaction.</p>

  <p>'I see,' he said, addressing the porter, 'that Mr Saltwood hasn't gone
  yet.'</p>

  <p>'No, sir,' was the reply. 'He is working up at the top tonight. Shall I
  take you up to him?'</p>

  <p>'If you please,' answered Thorndyke, and the porter accordingly took us in
  charge and led the way to the lift. From the latter we emerged into a region
  tenanted by great earthenware pans and jars and pervaded by a curious aroma,
  half spirituous, half cadaveric, on which I commented unfavourably.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Thorndyke, sniffing appreciatively, 'the good old museum
  bouquet. You smell it in all curators' rooms, and though, I suppose, it is
  not physically agreeable, I find it by no means unpleasant. The effects of
  odours are largely a matter of association.'</p>

  <p>'The present odour,' said I, 'seems to suggest the association of a very
  overripe Duke of Clarence and a butt of shockingly bad malmsey.'</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled tolerantly as we ascended a flight of stairs that led to
  a yet higher storey, and abandoned the discussion. At the top, we passed
  through several long galleries, past ranges of tables piled up with
  incredible numbers of bones, apparently awaiting disposal, until we were
  finally led by our conductor to a room in which two men were working at a
  long bench, on which were several partially articulated skeletons of animals.
  They both looked up as we entered, and one of them, a keen-faced, middle-aged
  man, exclaimed: 'Well, this is an unexpected pleasure. I haven't seen you for
  donkey's years, Thorndyke. Thought you had deserted the old shop. And I
  wonder what brings you here now.'</p>

  <p>'The usual thing, Saltwood. Self-interest. I have come to negotiate a
  loan. Have you got any loose bones of the Echidna?'</p>

  <p>Saltwood stroked his chin and turned interrogatively to his assistant. 'Do
  you know if there are any, Robson?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'There is a set waiting to be articulated, sir. Shall I fetch them?'</p>

  <p>'If you would, please, Robson,' replied Saltwood. Then turning to my
  colleague, he asked: 'What bones do you want, Thorndyke?'</p>

  <p>'The middle cervical vertebrae&mdash;about the third or fourth,' was the
  reply, at which I pricked up my ears.</p>

  <p>In a few minutes Robson returned carrying a cardboard box on which was a
  label inscribed 'Echidna hystrix.'</p>

  <p>Saltwood lifted the lid, disclosing a collection of small bones, including
  a queer little elongated skull.</p>

  <p>'Here you are,' said he, picking out a sort of necklace formed of the
  joints of the backbone; 'here is the whole vertebral column, minus the tail,
  strung together. Will you take it as it is?'</p>

  <p>'No,' replied Thorndyke, 'I will just take the three vertebrae that I
  want&mdash;the third, fourth, and fifth cervical, and if I let you have them
  back in the course of the week, will that do?'</p>

  <p>'Perfectly. I wouldn't bother you to return them at all if it were not for
  spoiling the set.' He separated the three little bones from the string, and
  having wrapped them in tissue paper and handed them to Thorndyke, asked; 'How
  is Jervis? I haven't seen him very lately, either.'</p>

  <p>'Jervis,' replied Thorndyke, 'is at present enjoying a sort of
  professional holiday in New York. He is retained, in an advisory capacity, in
  the Rosenbaum case, of which you may have read in the papers. My friend
  Anstey here is very kindly filling his place during his absence.'</p>

  <p>'I'm glad to hear that I'm filling it,' said I, as Saltwood bowed and
  shook hands. 'I was afraid I was only half filling it, being but a mere
  lawyer destitute of medical knowledge.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' said Saltwood, 'medical knowledge is important, of course, but
  you've always got Thorndyke to help you out. Oh&mdash;and that reminds me,
  Thorndyke, that I've got some new preparations that I should like you to see,
  a series of tumours from wild animals. Will you come and have a look at them?
  They are in the next room.'</p>

  <p>Thorndyke assented with enthusiasm, and the two men went out of the room,
  leaving me to the society of Robson and the box of bones. Into the latter I
  peered curiously, again noting the odd shape of the skull; then I proceeded
  to improve the occasion by a discreet question or two.</p>

  <p>'What sort of beast is an Echidna?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'Echidna hystrix,' replied Robson in a somewhat pompously didactic tone,
  'is the zoological name of the porcupine ant-eater.'</p>

  <p>'Indeed,' said I, and then tempted by his owlish solemnity to ask foolish
  questions, I inquired: 'Does that mean that he is an eater of porcupine
  ants?'</p>

  <p>'No, sir,' he replied gravely (he was evidently a little slow in the
  uptake). 'It is not the ants which are porcupines. It is the ant-eater.'</p>

  <p>'But,' I objected, 'how can an ant-eater be a porcupine? It is a
  contradiction in terms.'</p>

  <p>This seemed to floor him for a moment, but he pulled himself together and
  explained: 'The name signifies a porcupine which resembles an ant-eater, or
  perhaps one should say, an ant-eater, which resembles a porcupine. It is a
  very peculiar animal.'</p>

  <p>'It must be,' I agreed. 'And what is there peculiar about its cervical
  vertebrae?'</p>

  <p>He pondered profoundly, and I judged that he did not know but was not
  going to give himself away, a suspicion that his rather ambiguous explanation
  tended to confirm.</p>

  <p>'The cervical vertebrae,' he expounded, 'are very much alike in most
  animals. There are exceptions, of course, as in the case of the porpoise,
  which has no neck, and the giraffe, which has a good deal of neck. But in
  general, cervical vertebrae seem to be turned out pretty much to one pattern,
  whereas the tail vertebrae present great differences. Now, if you look at
  this animal's tail&mdash;' here he fished a second necklace out of the box
  and proceeded to expound the peculiarities of its constituent bones, to which
  exposition I am afraid I turned an inattentive ear. The Echidna's tail had no
  bearing on the identity of Mr Halliburton.</p>

  <p>The rather windy discourse had just come to an end when my two friends
  reappeared and Saltwood conducted us down to the hall. As we stepped out of
  the lift he shook our hands heartily, and with a cheery adieu, pressed the
  button and soared aloft like a stage fairy.</p>

  <p>From the great portico of the College we turned eastward and walked
  homewards across Lincoln's Inn, each of us wrapped in his own reflections.
  Presently I asked:</p>

  <p>'Supposing this mascot of Halliburton's to be the neck bone of an Echidna,
  what is the significance of the fact?'</p>

  <p>'Ah!' he replied. 'There you have me, Anstey. At present I am concerning
  myself only with the fact, hoping that its significance may appear later. To
  us it may have no significance at all. Of course there is some reason why
  this particular bone should have been used rather than some other kind of
  bone, but that set of circumstances may have&mdash;probably has&mdash;no
  connection with our inquiry. It is quite probable that Halliburton himself
  has no such connection. On the other hand, the circumstances which determined
  the use of an Echidna's vertebra as a mascot may have an important bearing on
  the case. So we can only secure the fact and wait for time and further
  knowledge to show whether it is or is not a relevant fact.'</p>

  <p>'And do you mean to say that you are taking all this trouble on the mere
  chance that this apparently trivial and meaningless circumstance may possibly
  have some bearing?'</p>

  <p>'That is so. But your question, Anstey, exhibits the difference between
  the legal and the scientific outlook. The lawyer's investigations tend to
  proceed along the line of information wanted: the scientists tend to proceed
  along the line of information available. The business of the man of science
  is impartially to acquire all the knowledge that is obtainable; the lawyer
  tends to concern himself only with that which is material to the issue.'</p>

  <p>'Then the scientist must accumulate a vast number of irrelevant
  facts.'</p>

  <p>'Every fact,' replied Thorndyke, 'is relevant to something, and if you
  accumulate a great mass of facts, inspection of the mass shows that the facts
  can be sorted out into related groups from which certain general truths can
  be inferred. The difference between the lawyer and the scientist is that one
  is seeking to establish some particular truth while the other seeks to
  establish any truth that emerges from the available facts.'</p>

  <p>'But,' I objected 'surely even a scientist must select his facts to some
  extent. Every science has its own province. The chemist, for instance, is not
  concerned with the metamorphoses of insects.'</p>

  <p>'That is true; he admitted. 'But then, are we not keeping within our own
  province? We are not collecting facts indiscriminately, but are selecting
  those facts which make some sort of contact with the circumstances of this
  crime and which may therefore conceivably be relevant to our inquiry. But
  methinks I perceive another collector. Isn't that our friend Superintendent
  Miller crossing to King's Bench Walk and apparently bearing down on our
  chambers?'</p>

  <p>I looked at the tall figure, indistinctly seen by the light of a lamp, and
  even as I looked, it ascended the steps and vanished into our entry; and
  when, a couple of minutes later, we arrived on our landing, we found Polton
  in the act of admitting the Superintendent.</p>

  <p>'Well, gentlemen,' the officer said genially, as he subsided into an
  armchair and selected a cigar from the box which Thorndyke handed to him
  'I've just dropped in to give you the news&mdash;about this Drayton case, you
  know. I thought you'd be interested to hear what our people are doing. Well,
  I don't think you need trouble yourselves about it any more. We've got one of
  the men, at any rate.'</p>

  <p>'In custody?' asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>'No, we haven't actually made the arrest, but there will be no difficulty
  about that. We know who he is. I just passed those fingerprints in to Mr
  Singleton and he gave me the name straight away. And who do you think it is?
  It is our old friend, Moakey&mdash;Joe Hedges, you know.'</p>

  <p>'Is it really!' said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>'Yes, Moakey it is. You're surprised. So was I. I really did think he had
  learned a little sense at last, especially as he seemed to be taking some
  reasonable precautions last time. But he always was a fool. Do you remember
  the asinine thing that he did on that last job?'</p>

  <p>'No,' replied Thorndyke, 'I don't remember that case.'</p>

  <p>'It was a small country house job, and Moakey did it all on his own. And
  it did look as if he had learned his lesson, for he undoubtedly wore gloves.
  We found them in his bag and there was not a trace at the house. But would
  you believe it, when he'd finished up, all neat and ship-shape, he must stop
  somewhere in the grounds to repack the swag&mdash;after he had taken his
  gloves off. Just then the alarm was raised and a dog let loose, and away went
  Moakey, like a hare, for the place in the fence where he had hidden his
  bicycle. He nipped over the fence, mounted his bike, and got clear away, and
  all trace of him seemed to be lost. But in the morning, when the local police
  came to search the grounds, they found a silver tray that Moakey had
  evidently had to drop when he heard the dog, with a most beautiful set of
  fingerprints on it. The police got a pair of photographs at once&mdash;there
  happened to be a dark room and a set of apparatus in the house&mdash;and sent
  a special messenger with them to Scotland Yard. And then the murder was out.
  They were Moakey's prints, and Moakey was arrested the same day with all the
  stuff in his possession. He hadn't had time to go to a fence with it. So the
  fingerprints didn't have to be put in evidence.'</p>

  <p>'Did Moakey ever hear about the fingerprints?' Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>'Yes. Some fool of a warder told him. And that's what makes this case so
  odd; to think that after coming a cropper twice he should have gone dabbing
  his trademarks over the furniture as he has, is perfectly incredible. And
  that isn't the only queer feature in the case. There's the stuff. I got Sir
  Lawrence to show it to me this morning, and I assure you that when I saw what
  it was, you could have knocked me down with a feather. To say nothing of the
  crockery and wineglasses and rubbish of that sort and the pewter spoons and
  brass spoons and bone bobbins, the jewellery was a fair knockout. There was
  only one cabinet of it, and you'll hardly believe me. Doctor, when I tell you
  that the greater part of it was silver, and even pinchbeck and brass&mdash;or
  latten, as Sir Lawrence calls it&mdash;set with the sort of stones that you
  can buy in Poland Street for ten bob a dozen. You never saw such trash!'</p>

  <p>'Oh come. Miller,' Thorndyke protested, 'don't call it trash. It is one of
  the most interesting and reasonable collections that I have ever seen.'</p>

  <p>'So it may be,' said the Superintendent, 'but I am looking at it from the
  trade point of view. Why, there isn't a fence outside Bedlam who'd give a
  fiver for the whole boiling. It's perfectly astonishing to me that an
  experienced tradesman like Moakey should have wasted his time on it. He might
  just as well have cracked an ironmonger's.'</p>

  <p>'I expect,' said I, 'he embarked on the job under a mistake. Probably he
  saw, or heard of, that article in the Connoisseur and thought that this was a
  great collection of jewels.'</p>

  <p>'That seems likely,' Miller agreed. 'And that may account for his having
  worked with a chum this time instead of doing the job single-handed as he
  usually does. But it doesn't account for his having used a pistol. That
  wasn't his way at all. There has never been a charge of violence against him
  before. I always took him for the good old-fashioned, sporting crook who
  played the game with us and expected us to play the game with him.'</p>

  <p>'Is it clear that it was Moakey who fired the shot?' asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>'Well, no, I don't know that it is. But he'll have to stand the racket
  unless he can prove that somebody else did it. And that won't be so very
  easy, for even if he gives us the name of the other man&mdash;the small
  man&mdash;and Miss Blake can identify him, still it will be difficult for
  Moakey to prove that the other man fired the shot, and the other chap isn't
  likely to be boastful about it.'</p>

  <p>'No,' said Thorndyke, 'he will pretty certainly put it on to Moakey, But
  between the two we may get at the truth as to what happened.'</p>

  <p>'We will hope so,' said Miller, rising and picking up his hat. 'At any
  rate, that is how the matter stands. I understand that Sir Lawrence wants you
  to keep an eye on the case, but there's really no need. It isn't in your line
  at all. We shall arrest Moakey and he will be committed for trial. If he
  likes to make a statement we may get the other man, but in any case there is
  nothing for you to do.'</p>

  <p>For some minutes after the Superintendent's departure, Thorndyke sat
  looking into the fire with an air of deep reflection. Presently he looked up
  as if he had disposed of some question that he had been propounding to
  himself and remarked: 'It's a curious affair, isn't it?'</p>

  <p>'Very,' I agreed. 'It seems as if this man, Moakey, had thrown all
  precaution to the winds. By the way, do you suppose those fingerprint people
  ever make mistakes? They seem pretty cocksure.'</p>

  <p>'They would be more than human if they never made a mistake,' Thorndyke
  replied. 'But, on the other hand, the identification of a whole set of
  fingerprints doesn't leave much room for error. You might get two prints that
  were similar enough to admit of a mistake, but you would hardly get two sets
  that could be mistaken for one another.'</p>

  <p>'No, I suppose not. So the mystery remains unexplained.'</p>

  <p>'It remains unexplained in any case,' said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>'How do you mean?' I asked. 'If they had made a mistake and these were
  really the fingerprints of some unknown person, that person might be a novice
  and there would be no mystery about his having taken no precautions.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, but that is not the mystery. The real mystery is the presence of a
  third man who has left no other traces.'</p>

  <p>'A third man!' I exclaimed. 'What evidence is there of the presence of a
  third man?'</p>

  <p>'It is very obvious,' replied Thorndyke. These fingerprints are not those
  of the small man, because he wore gloves. And they are not the fingerprints
  of the tall man.'</p>

  <p>'How do you know that?' I asked.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke rose, and opening a cabinet, took out the plaster cast of the
  tall man's left hand, which he had made on the previous night, and the pair
  of photographs.</p>

  <p>'Now,' said he, 'look at the print of the left forefinger in the
  photograph. You see that the pattern is quite clear and unbroken. Now look at
  the cast of the forefinger. Do you see what I mean?'</p>

  <p>'You mean that pit or dent in the bulb of the finger. But isn't that due
  to an irregularity of the ground on which the finger was pressed?'</p>

  <p>'No, it is the puckered scar of an old whitlow or deep wound of some kind.
  It is quite characteristic. And the print of this finger would show a blank
  white space in the middle of the pattern. So it is certain that those
  fingerprints did not belong to either of these two men.'</p>

  <p>'Then, really,' said I, 'the fact that these are Moakey's fingerprints
  serves to explain this other mystery.'</p>

  <p>'To some extent. But you see, Anstey, that it introduces a further
  mystery. If there were three men in that room, or on the premises, how comes
  it that there were only two sets of footprints?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, that is rather extraordinary. Can you suggest any explanation?'</p>

  <p>'The only explanation that occurs to me is that one of these men may have
  let Moakey into the house by the front door, that he may have been in the
  room when Miss Blake entered&mdash;he might, for instance, have been behind
  the door&mdash;and have slipped out when she ran to the window. He could then
  have to run into the drawing-room and waited until she rushed out of the
  house, when it would be easy for him to slip out at the front door and
  escape.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' I said dubiously, 'I suppose that is possible, but it doesn't sound
  very probable.'</p>

  <p>'It doesn't,' he agreed. 'But it is the only solution that I can think of
  at the moment. Of course there must be some explanation, for there are the
  facts. Inside the house are traces of three men. Outside are traces of only
  two. Have you any suggestion to offer?'</p>

  <p>I shook my head. 'It is beyond me, Thorndyke. Why didn't you ask
  Miller?'</p>

  <p>'Because I am not proposing to take the police into my confidence until I
  have evidence that they are prepared to do the same by me. They will probably
  assume that the tall man was Moakey&mdash;he is about the same height. The
  information that we obtain from the cast of that man's hand is not, you must
  remember, in their possession.'</p>

  <p>'No, I had forgotten that. And now I begin to appreciate my learned
  senior's foresight in taking a permanent record of that handprint.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Thorndyke. 'A permanent record is invaluable. It allows of
  reference at one's leisure and in connection with fresh evidence, as in the
  present case. And, moreover, it allows of study under the most favourable
  conditions. That scar on the finger was not noticeable in the impression in
  the sand, especially by the imperfect light of the lamp. But on the cast,
  which we can examine at our ease, by daylight if necessary, it is plainly
  visible. And we have it here to compare with the finger, if ever that finger
  should be forthcoming. I now make a rule of securing a plaster cast of any
  object that I cannot retain in my possession.'</p>

  <p>Here, as if in illustration of this last statement, Polton entered the
  room bearing a small tray lined with blotting paper, on which lay three
  objects&mdash;a diminutive glass negative and two mascots. He laid the tray
  on the table and invited us to inspect his works, tendering a watchmakers
  eyeglass to assist the inspection.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke picked up the two mascots and examined them separately through
  the glass, then with a faint smile, but without remark, he passed the tray to
  me. I stuck the glass in my eye and scrutinised first one and then the other
  of the mascots, and finally looked up at Polton, who was watching me with a
  smile that covered his face with wrinkles of satisfaction.</p>

  <p>'I suppose, Polton,' I said, 'You have some means of telling which is
  which, but I'm hanged if I can see a particle of difference.'</p>

  <p>'I can tell 'em by the feel, sir,' he replied 'but I took the precaution
  to weigh the original in the chemical balance before I made the copy. I think
  the colour matches pretty well.'</p>

  <p>'It is a perfect reproduction, Polton,' said Thorndyke. 'If we were to
  show it to Superintendent Miller he would want to take your fingerprints
  right away. He would say that you were not a safe person to be at large.'</p>

  <p>At this commendation Polton's countenance crinkled until he looked like a
  species of human walnut, and when the photograph of the signature had been
  examined and pronounced fit for the making of an enlargement, he departed,
  chuckling audibly.</p>

  <p>When he had gone, I picked up one of the mascots and again examined it
  closely while Thorndyke made a similar inspection of its twin.</p>

  <p>'Had you any definite purpose in your mind,' I asked 'when you instructed
  Polton to make this indistinguishable copy?'</p>

  <p>'No,' he replied. 'I thought it wise to preserve a record of the thing,
  but, for my own information, a plain plaster cast would have answered quite
  well. Still, as it would not take much more trouble to imitate the colour and
  texture, I decided that there might be some advantage in having a perfect
  replica. There are certain imaginable circumstances in which it might be
  useful. I shall get Polton to make a cast of the Echidna's vertebra, so that
  we may have the means of demonstrating the nature of the object to others, if
  necessary; and by the way, we may as well make the comparison now and confirm
  my opinion that the animal really was an Echidna.'</p>

  <p>He produced the little packet that Saltwood had given him, and laying the
  little bones on the table, compared them carefully with the mascot.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' he said at length, 'I was right. Mr Halliburton's treasure is the
  third cervical vertebra of a young but full-grown Echidna.'</p>

  <p>'How did you recognise this as an Echidna's vertebra?' I asked, recalling
  Mr Robson's rather obscure exposition on the subject. 'Aren't neck vertebrae
  a good deal alike in most animals?'</p>

  <p>'In animals of the same class they are usually very much alike. But the
  Echidna is a transitional form. Although it is a mammal, it has many
  well-marked reptilian characters. This vertebra shows one of them. If you
  look at those corner-pieces&mdash;the transverse processes&mdash;you will see
  that they are separate from the rest of the bone, that they are joined to it
  by a seam or suture. But in all other mammals, with a single exception, the
  transverse processes are fused with the rest of the bone. There is no
  separating line. That suture was the distinguishing feature which attracted
  my attention.'</p>

  <p>'And does the fact of its being an Echidna's bone suggest any particular
  significance to your mind?'</p>

  <p>'Well,' he replied, 'the Echidna is far from a common animal. And this
  particular bone seems to have been worked on by some barbarian artist, which
  suggests that it may have been originally a barbaric ornament or charm or
  fetish, which again suggests personal connections and a traceable history.
  You will notice that the two letters seem to have been impressed on the
  ornament and have no connection with it, which suggests that the bone was
  already covered with these decorations when it came into the late owner's
  possession.'</p>

  <p>I took up the glass and once more examined the mascot. The whole surface
  of the little bone, on both sides, was covered with an intricate mass of
  ornament consisting principally of scrolls or spirals, crude and barbaric in
  design but very minutely and delicately executed. In the centre of the solid
  part of the bone an extremely small 'o' had been indented on one side and on
  the same spot on the reverse side an equally minute 'h'. And through the
  glass I could see that the letters cut into the pattern, whereas the hole for
  the suspension ring was part of the original work and was incorporated into
  the design.</p>

  <p>'I wonder why he used small letters for his initials instead of capitals,'
  said I.</p>

  <p>'For the reason, I imagine, that they were small letters. He wanted them
  merely for identification, and no doubt wished them to be as inconspicuous as
  possible. Any letters are a disfigurement when they are not part of the
  design, and capitals would have been much worse than small letters.'</p>

  <p>'These seem to have been punched, on with printer's types.' I
  remarked.</p>

  <p>'They have been punched, not cut, but not, I should say, with printer's
  types. Type metal&mdash;even the hard variety which would be used for casting
  these little "Pearl" or "Diamond" types&mdash;is comparatively soft, and the
  harder varieties are brittle. It would scarcely be strong enough to bear
  hammering into bone. I should say these letters were indented with steel
  punches.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' I said 'we have got a vast amount of entertainment out of Mr
  Halliburton and his mascot. But it looks rather as if that were going to be
  the end of it, for if Moakey is one of the robbers, we may take it that the
  others are just professional crooks. And thereupon Mr Halliburton recedes
  once more into the background. Isn't that the position?'</p>

  <p>'Apparently it is,' replied Thorndyke. 'But we shall see what happens at
  the inquest. Possibly some further evidence may be forthcoming when the
  witnesses give their accounts in detail. And possibly Moakey himself may be
  able to throw some further light on the matter. They will probably have him
  in custody within a day or two.'</p>

  <p>'By the way,' I said, 'have you examined the hair that poor Drayton had
  grasped in his hand?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. There is nothing very characteristic about it. It is dark in colour
  and the hairs are rather small in diameter. But there was one slightly odd
  circumstance. Among the tuft of dark hairs there was one light one&mdash;not
  white&mdash;a blonde hair. It had no root and no tip. It was just a broken
  fragment. What do you make of that?'</p>

  <p>'I don't know that I make anything of it. I understand that a man may
  sometimes find a woman's hair sticking to his coat in the neighbourhood of
  the shoulder or chest, though I have no personal experience of such things.
  But if on the coat, why not on the head? My learned senior's powerful
  constructive imagination might conceive circumstances in which such a
  transfer of hair might occur. Or has he some more recondite explanation?'</p>

  <p>'There are other possible explanations,' Thorndyke replied. 'And as the
  hour seems to preclude a return to Hampstead tonight, and seems to suggest a
  temporary tenancy of Jervis's bedroom, I would recommend the problem for my
  learned friend's consideration while awaiting the approach of Morpheus or
  Hypnos, whichever deity he elects to patronize.'</p>

  <p>This gentle hint, enforced by a glance at my watch, brought our discussion
  to an end, and very shortly afterwards we betook ourselves to our respective
  sleeping apartments.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch7"
     id="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; THE VANISHED HEIRLOOM</h2>

  <p class="first">The tragic events at 'The Rowans' had excited a considerable
  amount of public interest, and naturally that interest was manifested in a
  specially intense form by the residents in the locality. I realised this
  when, in obedience to the summons which had been left at my lodgings, I made
  my way to the premises adjoining the High Street in which the inquest was to
  be held. As I approached the building I observed that quite a considerable
  crowd had gathered round the doors awaiting their opening, and noticed with
  some surprise the proportion of well-dressed women composing it.</p>

  <p>Observing that the crowd contained no one whom I knew, I began to suspect
  that there was some other entrance reserved for authorised visitors, and was
  just looking round in search of it when the doors were opened and the crowd
  began to surge in; and at that moment I saw Miss Blake approaching. I waited
  for her to arrive, and when we had exchanged greetings I proceeded to pilot
  her through the crowd, which passed in with increasing slowness, suggesting
  that the accommodation was already being somewhat taxed.</p>

  <p>I was not the only person who observed the symptoms of a 'full house.' A
  woman whom I had already noticed making her way through the throng with more
  skill and energy than politeness, came abreast of me just as I had struggled
  to the door and made a determined effort to squeeze past. Perhaps if she had
  been a different type of woman I might have accepted the customary masculine
  defeat, but her bad manners, combined with her unprepossessing appearance,
  banished any scruples of chivalry. She was a kind of woman that I dislike
  most cordially; loudly dressed, flashy, scented like a civet cat; with
  glaring golden hair&mdash;manifestly peroxided, as was evident by her dark
  eyebrows&mdash;pencilled eyelids, and a coat of powder that stared even
  through her spotted veil. My gorge rose at her, and as she stuck her elbow in
  my ribs and made a final burst to get in before me, I maintained a stolid
  resistance.</p>

  <p>'You must excuse me,' I said, 'but I am a witness, and so is this
  lady.'</p>

  <p>She cast a quick glance at me, and from me to Miss Blake; then&mdash;with
  a bad enough grace and without replying&mdash;she withdrew to let us pass,
  and ostentatiously turned her back on us.</p>

  <p>The room was already crowded, but that was no concern of ours. We were
  present, and when our names should be called, the coroner's officer would do
  all that was necessary.</p>

  <p>'I suppose,' said Miss Blake, 'we ought to have come in by another door. I
  see Sir Lawrence and Mrs Benham are sitting by the table; and isn't that Dr
  Thorndyke next to Sir Lawrence?'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' I replied. 'I don't think he has been summoned, but, of course, he
  would be here to watch the case. I see Inspector Badger, too. I wonder if he
  is going to give evidence. Ah! You were right. There is another door. Here
  come the coroner and the jury. They will probably call you first as you are
  the principal witness, unless they begin with the medical evidence or Sir
  Lawrence. I see Dr Nichols has just come in.'</p>

  <p>As the coroner and the jury took their seats at the table, the loud hum of
  conversation died away and an air of silent expectancy settled on the
  closely-packed audience. The coroner looked over a sheaf of type-written
  papers, and then opened the proceedings with a short address to the jury in
  which he recited the general facts of the case.</p>

  <p>'And now, gentlemen,' he said in conclusion, 'we will proceed to take the
  evidence, and we had better begin with that of the medical witness.'</p>

  <p>Hereupon Dr Nichols was called, and having been sworn, described the
  circumstances under which he was summoned to 'The Rowans' on the night of the
  20th of September, and the result of his subsequent examination of the body
  of the deceased. 'The cause of death,' he stated, 'was a bullet-wound of the
  chest. The bullet entered on the right side between the third and fourth
  ribs, and passed completely through the chest, emerging on the left side of
  the back between the fourth and fifth ribs. In its passage it perforated the
  aorta&mdash;the greater central artery&mdash;and this injury might have
  produced almost instantaneous death.'</p>

  <p>'Could the wound have been self-inflicted?' the coroner asked.</p>

  <p>'Under the circumstances, it could not, for although death was practically
  instantaneous, no weapon was discovered. If the injury had been
  self-inflicted, the weapon would have been found either grasped in the hand
  or lying by the body.'</p>

  <p>'Was the weapon fired at close quarters?'</p>

  <p>'Apparently not. At any rate there was no singeing of the clothes or any
  other sign indicating a very close range.'</p>

  <p>That was the sum of Dr Nichols' evidence, and on its conclusion the local
  inspector was called. His evidence, however, was of merely formal character,
  setting forth the time at which he received the alarm call from Mrs Benham
  and the conditions existing when he arrived. When it was finished there was a
  short pause. Then the next witness was called. This was Sir Lawrence Drayton,
  who, after giving evidence as to the identity of the deceased, answered a few
  questions respecting the collection and his brother's manner of life, and the
  articles which had been stolen.</p>

  <p>'The report, then,' said the coroner, 'that this was a collection of
  valuable jewellery was erroneous?'</p>

  <p>'Quite erroneous. Deceased never desired, nor could he afford, to
  accumulate things of great intrinsic value.'</p>

  <p>'Do you know if many strangers came to see the collection?'</p>

  <p>'Very few. In fact I never heard of any excepting those who came after an
  article on the collection had appeared in the Connoisseur.'</p>

  <p>'Do you know how many came then?'</p>

  <p>'There was a small party of Americans who came by appointment and were
  introduced by one of the staff of the South Kensington Museum. And there was
  a Mr Halliburton who wrote from some hotel for an appointment. All I know
  about him is that he was apparently not specially interested in anything in
  the collection excepting the pieces that were illustrated in the magazine. I
  believe he wanted to buy one of those, but I don't remember which it
  was.'</p>

  <p>That was the substance of Drayton's evidence, and when he had returned to
  his seat, the next witness was called.</p>

  <p>'Winifred Blake.'</p>

  <p>Miss Blake rose, and having made her way to the table, took the oath and
  proceeded to give her evidence. After one or two preliminary questions, the
  coroner allowed her to make her statement without interruption, while the
  jury and the audience listened with absorbed interest to her clear and vivid
  account of the events connected with the crime. When she had finished her
  narration&mdash;which was substantially the same as that which I had heard
  from her on the night of the tragedy&mdash;the coroner thanked her for the
  very lucid manner in which she had given her evidence and then proceeded to
  enlarge upon one or two points relating to the possible antecedents of the
  tragedy.</p>

  <p>'You have mentioned, Miss Blake, that you were led to communicate with
  deceased by a certain article which appeared in the Connoisseur. Did that
  article give you the impression that the collection described was an
  important collection of valuable jewellery?'</p>

  <p>'No. The article explicitly stated that the chief value of the pieces was
  in their history and associations.'</p>

  <p>'Are you an expert or connoisseur in jewellery?'</p>

  <p>'No. As an artist I am, of course, interested in goldsmith's and jewellers
  work, but I have no special knowledge of it. My interest in this collection
  was purely personal. I wished to examine one of the pieces that was
  illustrated.'</p>

  <p>'Would you tell us exactly what you mean by a personal interest?'</p>

  <p>'The Connoisseur article was illustrated with two photographs, one of a
  locket and the other of a pendant. The pendant appeared to me to resemble one
  which was an heirloom in my own family and which disappeared about a hundred
  and fifty years ago and has never been seen since. I wanted to examine that
  pendant and see if it really was the missing jewel.'</p>

  <p>'Was the missing pendant of any considerable value?'</p>

  <p>'No. It was a small, plain gold pendant set with a single cat's eye, and
  the pendant shown in the photograph appeared to answer the description
  exactly so far as I could judge. Its actual value would be quite small.'</p>

  <p>'You say that the actual, or intrinsic, value of this jewel would be
  trifling. Had it, so far as you know, any special value?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. It appears to have been greatly prized in the family, and I believe
  a good many efforts have been made to trace it. There was a tradition, or
  superstition, connected with it which gave it its value to members of the
  family.'</p>

  <p>'Can you tell us what was the nature of that tradition?'</p>

  <p>'It connected the possession of the jewel with the succession to the
  estates. The custom had been for the head of the family to wear the jewel,
  usually under the clothing, and the belief was that so long as he wore the
  jewel, or at any rate had it in his possession, the estates would remain in
  the possession of the branch of the family to which he belonged; but if the
  jewel passed into the possession of a member of some other branch of the
  family, then the estates would also pass into the possession of that
  branch.'</p>

  <p>The coroner smiled. 'Your ancestors,' he remarked, 'appear to have taken
  small account of property law. But you say that efforts have been made to
  trace this jewel and that a good deal of value was set on it. Now, do you
  suppose that this tradition was taken at all seriously by any of the members
  of your family?'</p>

  <p>'I cannot say very positively, but I should suppose that any one who might
  have a claim in the event of the failure of the existing line, would be glad
  to have the jewel in his possession.'</p>

  <p>'Is there, so far as you know, any probability of a change in the
  succession to this property?'</p>

  <p>'I believe that the present tenant is unmarried and that if he should die
  there would be several claimants from other branches of the family.'</p>

  <p>'And then,' said the coroner with a smile, 'the one who possessed the
  cat's eye pendant would be the successful claimant. Is that the
  position?'</p>

  <p>'It is possible that some of them entertain that belief.'</p>

  <p>'Have you any expectations yourself?'</p>

  <p>'Personally I have not. But my brother Percival is, properly speaking, the
  direct heir to this estate.'</p>

  <p>'Then why is he not in possession? And what do you mean exactly by the
  "direct heir"?'</p>

  <p>'I mean that he is the direct descendant of the head of the senior branch
  of the family. Our ancestor disappeared at the same time as the
  jewel&mdash;he took it with him, in fact. The reason that my brother is not
  in possession is that we cannot prove the legality of our ancestor's
  marriage. But it is always possible that the documents may be
  discovered&mdash;they are known to exist; and then, if a change in the
  succession should occur, my brother's claim would certainly take precedence
  of the others.'</p>

  <p>'This is very interesting,' said the coroner, 'and not without importance
  to this inquiry. Now tell us, Miss Blake, would you yourself attach any
  significance to the possession of this jewel?'</p>

  <p>Miss Blake coloured slightly as she replied: 'I don't suppose it would
  affect the succession to the property, but I should like to know that the
  jewel was in my brother's possession.'</p>

  <p>'In case there might be some truth in the belief, h'm? Well, it's not
  unnatural. And now, to return for a moment to the man whom you tried so
  pluckily to detain. You have given us a very clear description of him. Do you
  think you would be able to recognise him?'</p>

  <p>'I feel no doubt that I could. As an artist with some experience as a
  portrait painter I have been accustomed to study faces closely and quickly
  and to remember them. I can form quite a clear mental picture of this man's
  face.'</p>

  <p>'Do you think you could make. I drawing of it from memory?'</p>

  <p>'I don't think my drawing would be reliable for identification. It is
  principally the man's expression that I remember so clearly. I might be wrong
  as to the details of the features, but if I were to see the man again I am
  sure I should know him.'</p>

  <p>'I hope you will have an opportunity,' said the coroner. Then, turning to
  the jury, he asked: 'Do you wish to ask this witness any questions,
  gentlemen?' and on receiving a negative reply, he thanked Miss Blake and
  dismissed her with a bow.</p>

  <p>My own evidence was taken next, but I need not repeat it since it was
  concerned only with those experiences which I have already related in detail.
  I was followed by Mrs Benham, who, like the preceding witnesses, was allowed
  to begin with a statement describing her experiences.</p>

  <p>'How did it happen,' the coroner asked when she had finished her
  statement, 'that there was no one in the house when the thieves broke
  in?'</p>

  <p>'I had to take a message for Mr Drayton to a gentleman who lives at North
  End. It is quite a short distance, but I was detained there more than a
  quarter of an hour.'</p>

  <p>'Was the house often left?'</p>

  <p>'No, very seldom. During the day I had a maid to help me. She went home at
  six, and after that I hardly ever went out.'</p>

  <p>'Were you alone in the house in the evenings when Mr Drayton was at the
  club?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. From about seven to between half-past nine and ten. Mr Drayton used
  to lock the museum and take the key with him.'</p>

  <p>'Did many persons know that deceased was away from the house every
  evening?'</p>

  <p>'A good many must have known, as he was a regular chess-player. And
  anybody who cared to know could have seen him go out and come back.'</p>

  <p>'On the night of the murder did he go out at his usual time?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, a little after seven. But, unfortunately, he came back nearly two
  hours earlier than usual. That was the cause of the disaster.'</p>

  <p>'Exactly. And now, Mrs Benham, I want you to tell us all you know about
  the visitors who came to see the collection after the article had appeared in
  the Connoisseur. There were some Americans, I believe?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. A small party&mdash;four or five&mdash;who came together in a large
  car. They sent a letter of introduction, and I think Mr Drayton knew pretty
  well who they were. Then about a week later Mr Halliburton wrote from the
  Baltic Hotel to ask if he might look over the collection, and naming a
  particular day&mdash;the sixteenth of this month&mdash;and Mr Drayton made
  the appointment, although it was very inconvenient.'</p>

  <p>'Was Mr Halliburton known to deceased?'</p>

  <p>'No, he was a complete stranger.'</p>

  <p>'And did he come and inspect the collection?'</p>

  <p>'Yes; he came, and Mr Drayton spent a long time with him showing him all
  the things and telling him all about them. I remember it very well because Mr
  Drayton was so very vexed that he should have put himself to so much
  inconvenience for nothing.'</p>

  <p>'Why "for nothing"?' asked the coroner.</p>

  <p>'He said that Mr Halliburton didn't seem to know anything about jewellery
  nor to care about any of the things but the two that had been shown in the
  photographs. He seemed to have come from mere idle curiosity. And then he
  rather offended Mr Drayton by offering to buy one of the pieces. He said that
  he wanted to give it for a wedding present.'</p>

  <p>'Do you know which piece it was that he wanted to buy?'</p>

  <p>'The pendant. The other piece&mdash;the locket&mdash;didn't seem to
  interest him at all.'</p>

  <p>'Did you see Mr Halliburton?'</p>

  <p>'I only saw his back as he went out. Mr Drayton let him in and took him to
  the museum. I could see that he was rather a big man, but I couldn't see what
  he was like.'</p>

  <p>'And are these the only strangers that have been to the house lately?'</p>

  <p>'Yes; the only ones for quite a long time.'</p>

  <p>The coroner reflected for a few moments, then, as the jury had no
  questions to ask, he thanked the witness and dismissed her.</p>

  <p>The next witness was Inspector Badger, and a very cautious witness he was,
  and like his namesake, very unwilling to be drawn. To me, who knew pretty
  well what information he held, his evasive manoeuvres and his portentous
  secrecy were decidedly amusing, and the foxy glances that he occasionally
  cast in Thorndyke's direction made me suspect that he was unaware of
  Superintendent Miller's visit to our chambers. He began by setting forth
  that, in consequence of a telephone message from the local police, he
  proceeded on the evening of the twentieth instant to 'The Rowans' to examine
  the premises and obtain particulars of the crime. He had obtained a rough
  list of the stolen property from Sir Lawrence Drayton. It included the
  pendant and the locket which had been illustrated in the article referred
  to.</p>

  <p>'Should you say there was any evidence of selection as to the articles
  stolen?' the coroner asked.</p>

  <p>'No. Only two drawers had been opened, and they were the two upper ones.
  The top drawer contained nothing of any value, and I infer that the thieves
  had only just got the second drawer open when they were disturbed.'</p>

  <p>'Did you ascertain how many men were on the premises?'</p>

  <p>'There were two men. We found their footprints in the grounds, and
  moreover, both of them were seen. And certain other traces were found.'</p>

  <p>'Dr Nichols has mentioned that some hair was found grasped in the hand of
  deceased. Has that been examined?'</p>

  <p>'I believe it has, but hair isn't much use until you have got the man to
  compare it with.'</p>

  <p>'I suppose not. And with regard to the other traces. What were they?'</p>

  <p>The inspector pursed up his lips and assumed a portentous expression.</p>

  <p>'I hope, sir,' said he, 'that you will not press that question. It is not
  desirable in the interests of justice that the information that is in our
  possession should become public property.'</p>

  <p>'I quite agree with you,' said the coroner. 'But may we take it that you
  have some clue to the identity of these two men?'</p>

  <p>'We have several very promising clues,' the inspector replied with some
  disregard, I suspected, for the exact wording of the oath that he had just
  taken.</p>

  <p>'Well,' said the coroner, 'that is all that really concerns us'; and I
  could not but reflect that it was all that really concerned Mr Joseph Hedges,
  alias Moakey, and that the inspector's secrecy was somewhat pointless when
  the cat had been let out of the bag to this extent. 'I suppose,' he
  continued, 'it would be indiscreet to ask if any information is available
  about the Mr Halliburton whose name has been mentioned.'</p>

  <p>'I should rather not make any detailed statement on the subject,' replied
  Badger, 'but I may say that our information is of a very definite kind and
  points very clearly in a particular direction.'</p>

  <p>'That is very satisfactory,' said the coroner. 'This is a peculiarly
  atrocious crime, and I am sure that all law-abiding persons will be glad to
  hear that there is a good prospect of the wrongdoers being brought to
  justice. And I think if you have nothing more to tell us, Inspector, that we
  need not trouble you any further.' He paused, and as Badger resumed his seat,
  he took a final glance over his notes; then, turning to the jury, he said:
  'You have now, gentlemen, heard all the evidence, excepting those details
  which the police have very properly reserved and which really do not concern
  us. For I may remind you that this is not a criminal court. It is not our
  object to fix the guilt on any particular persons but to ascertain how this
  poor gentlemen met with his most deplorable death; and I am sure that the
  evidence which you have heard will be sufficient to enable you, without
  difficulty, to arrive at a verdict.'</p>

  <p>On the conclusion of the coroner's address, the jury rapidly conferred for
  a few moments; then the foreman rose and announced that they had agreed
  unanimously on a verdict of wilful murder committed by some person or persons
  unknown, and they desired to express their deep sympathy with the brother of
  the deceased, Sir Lawrence Drayton; and when the latter had briefly thanked
  the jury, through the coroner, the proceedings terminated and the court
  rose.</p>

  <p>As the audience were slowly filing out, Sir Lawrence approached Miss
  Blake, and having shaken hands cordially and inquired as to her
  convalescence, said: 'That was a very remarkable story that you told in your
  evidence; I mean the simultaneous disappearance of your ancestor and this
  curious heirloom. As a Chancery barrister, unusual circumstances affecting
  the devolution of landed property naturally interest me. In the court in
  which I practise one sees, from time to time, some very odd turns of the
  wheel of Fortune. May I ask if any claim has ever been advanced by your
  branch of the family?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. My father began some proceedings soon after my brother was born, but
  his counsel advised him not to go on with the case. He considered that
  without documentary evidence of my ancestor's marriage, it was useless to
  take the case into court.'</p>

  <p>'Probably he was right,' said Drayton. 'Still, as a matter of professional
  interest&mdash;to say nothing of the interest that one naturally feels in the
  welfare of one's friends&mdash;I should like to know more about this quaint
  piece of family history. What do you think, Anstey?'</p>

  <p>'I think it would be interesting to know just at what point the evidence
  of the relationship breaks off, and how large the gap is.'</p>

  <p>'Precisely,' said Drayton. 'And one would like to know how the other
  parties are placed. What, for instance, would be the position if the present
  tenant were to die without issue, who are the heirs, and so on.'</p>

  <p>'If it would interest you,' said Miss Blake, 'I could give you fairly full
  particulars of all that is known. My grandfather, who was a lawyer, wrote out
  an abstract for the guidance of his descendants; quite a full and very clear
  narrative. I could let you have that or a copy of it, if I didn't feel
  ashamed to take up your time with it.'</p>

  <p>'Let me have the copy,' said Drayton. 'I don't suppose anything will come
  of it from your point of view, but it strikes me as an interesting case which
  is at least worth elucidating. Do you know Dr Thorndyke?'</p>

  <p>'We know one another by repute,' said Thorndyke. 'Miss Blake used to board
  with Polton's sister. You were speaking of the curious circumstances that
  Miss Blake mentioned in reference to the cat's eye pendant.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Drayton. 'I was saying that it would be worth while to get the
  facts of the case sorted out.'</p>

  <p>'I quite agree with you,' said Thorndyke. 'The same idea had occurred to
  me when Miss Blake was giving her evidence. Do I understand that there are
  documents available?'</p>

  <p>'I have a full resume of the facts relating to the change in the
  succession,' said Miss Blake, 'and a copy which I am going to hand to Sir
  Lawrence.'</p>

  <p>'Then,' said Thorndyke, 'I shall crave your kind permission to look
  through that copy. I am not much of an authority on property law,
  but&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Nihil quod tetigit non ornavit,' I murmured, quoting Johnson's famous
  epitaph on the versatile 'Goldie.'</p>

  <p>'Quite right, Anstey,' Drayton agreed warmly. 'All knowledge is
  Thorndyke's province. Then you will let me have that copy at your
  convenience, Miss Blake?'</p>

  <p>'Thank you, yes, Sir Lawrence,' she replied. 'You shall have it by
  tomorrow. Oh, and there is something else that I have to give you, and I may
  as well give it to you now. Did Mr Anstey tell you that I had found the
  missing locket? I have brought it tied round my neck for safety. Has any one
  got a knife?' As she spoke she unfastened the top button of her dress and
  drew out the little gold volume which was attached to a silken cord.</p>

  <p>'Don't cut the cord,' said Drayton. 'I want you to keep the locket as a
  souvenir of my poor brother. Now don't raise objections. Anstey has told me
  that the little bauble has found favour in your eyes, and I very much wish
  you to have it. It was a great favourite of my brother's. He used to call it
  "the little Sphinx" because it always seemed to be propounding a riddle; and
  it will be a great satisfaction to me to feel that it has passed into
  friendly and sympathetic hands instead of going to a museum with the other
  things.'</p>

  <p>'It is exceedingly kind of you, Sir Lawrence,' she began, but he
  interrupted: 'It is nothing of the kind. I am doing myself a kindness in
  finding a good home for poor Andrew's little favourite. Are you going by
  train or tram?'</p>

  <p>'I shall wait for the tram,' she replied.</p>

  <p>'Then we part here. Dr Thorndyke and I are taking the train to Broad
  Street. Goodbye! Don't forget to send me that copy of the documents.'</p>

  <p>The two men swung off down the road to the station, and as a tram appeared
  in the offing, a resolution which had been forming in my mind took definite
  shape.</p>

  <p>'I don't see,' said I, 'why I should be left out in the cold in regard to
  this family romance of yours. Why shouldn't I come and collect the copy to
  deliver to Sir Lawrence and have a surreptitious read at it myself?'</p>

  <p>'It would be very nice of you if you could spare the time,' she replied.
  'I will even offer special inducements. I will give you some tea, which you
  must be wanting by this time, I should think, and I will show you not only
  the copy but the original documents. One of them is quite curious.'</p>

  <p>'That settles it then,' said I. 'Tea and documents, combined with your
  society and that of your ingenious brother, form what the theatrical people
  would call a galaxy of attractions. Here is our tram. Do we go inside or
  outside?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, outside, please. There is quite a crowd waiting.'</p>

  <p>I was relieved at this decision, for I was hankering for a smoke; and as
  soon as we had taken our places in a front seat on the roof, I began secretly
  to feel in the pocket where the friendly pipe reposed and to debate within
  myself whether I might crave permission to bring it forth. At length the
  tobacco-hunger conquered my scruples and I ventured to make the request.</p>

  <p>'Oh, of course,' she replied. 'Do smoke. I love the smell of tobacco,
  especially from a pipe.'</p>

  <p>Thus encouraged, I joyfully produced the calumet and felt in my pocket for
  my pouch. And then came a dreadful disappointment. The pouch was there, sure
  enough, but its lean sides announced the hideous fact that it was empty.
  There were not even a few grains wherewith to stave off imminent
  starvation.</p>

  <p>'How provoking!' my companion exclaimed tragically. 'I am sorry. But you
  shan't be deprived for long. You must get down at a tobacconist's and restock
  your pouch, and then after tea you shall smoke your pipe while I show you the
  documents, as you call them.'</p>

  <p>'Then I am comforted,' said I. 'The galaxy of attractions has received a
  further addition.' Resignedly I put away the pipe and pouch, and reverting to
  a question that had occurred to me while she was giving her evidence, I said:
  'There was one statement of yours that I did not quite follow. It was with
  regard to the man whom you were trying to hold. You said that you were quite
  confident that you would recognise him and that you could call up quite a
  clear and vivid mental picture of his face, but yet you thought that, if you
  were to draw a memory portrait of him, that portrait might be misleading. How
  could that be? You would know whether your portrait was like your
  recollection of the man, and if it was, surely it would be like the man
  himself?'</p>

  <p>'I suppose it would,' she replied thoughtfully. 'But there might be some
  false details which wouldn't matter to me but which might mislead others who
  might take those details for the essential characters.'</p>

  <p>'But if the details were wrong, wouldn't that destroy the likeness?'</p>

  <p>'Not necessarily, I think. Of course, a likeness is ultimately dependent
  on the features, particularly on their proportion and the spaces between
  them. But you must have noticed that when children and beginners draw
  portraits, although they produce the most frightful caricatures&mdash;all
  wrong and all out of drawing&mdash;yet those portraits are often unmistakable
  likenesses.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I have noticed that. But don't you think the likeness is probably
  due to the caricature? To the exaggeration of some one or two characteristic
  peculiarities?'</p>

  <p>'Very likely But that rather bears out what I said. For those caricatures,
  though easily recognisable, are mostly false; and if one of them got into the
  hands of a stranger who had never seen the subject of the portrait, for
  purposes of identification, he would as probably as not look for some one
  having those characteristics which had been quite falsely represented.'</p>

  <p>'Yes; and then he would be looking for the wrong kind of person
  altogether.'</p>

  <p>'Exactly. And then my drawing would probably be far from a correct
  representation of my recollection of the face. It isn't as if one could take
  a photograph of a mental image. So I am afraid that the idea of a memory
  drawing for the purpose of identification must be abandoned. Besides, it
  would be of no use unless we could get hold of the man.'</p>

  <p>'No. But that is not impossible. The police have apparently identified one
  of the men and expect to have him in custody at any moment. He may give
  information as to the other, but even if he does not, the police may be able
  to find out who his associates were, and in that case a memory drawing which
  was far from accurate might help them to pick out the particular man.'</p>

  <p>'That is possible,' she agreed. 'But then if the police could get hold of
  this man's associates and let me see them, I could pick out the particular
  man with certainty and without any drawing at all. Isn't that a tobacconist's
  shop that we are approaching?'</p>

  <p>'It is. I think I will get off and make my purchase and then come along to
  the studio.'</p>

  <p>'Do,' she said, 'and I will run on ahead and see that the preparations for
  tea are started.'</p>

  <p>I ran down the steps and dropped off the tram without stopping it, but by
  this time we had passed the shop by some little distance and I had to walk
  back. I secured the new supply, and having stuffed it into my pouch, came out
  of the shop just in time to see the tram stop nearly a quarter of a mile
  ahead and Miss Blake get off, followed by a couple of other passengers, and
  walk quickly into Jacob Street. I strode forward at a brisk pace in the same
  direction, but when I reached the corner of the street she had already
  disappeared. I was just about to cross to the side on which the studio was
  situated when my attention was attracted by a woman who was walking slowly up
  the street on my side. At the first glance I was struck by something familiar
  in her appearance and a second glance confirmed the impression. She was
  smartly&mdash;and something more than smartly&mdash;dressed, and in
  particular I noted a rather large, elaborate, and gaudy hat. In short, she
  was very singularly like the woman who had jostled me in the doorway of the
  hall in which the inquest was held.</p>

  <p>I slowed down to avoid overtaking her, and as I did so she crossed the
  road and walked straight up to the gate of the studio. For an instant I
  thought she was going to ring the bell, for after a glance at the number on
  the gate she turned to the side and read the little nameplate, leaning
  forward and putting her face close to it as if she were near-sighted. At that
  moment the wicket opened and Master Percy stepped out on to the threshold;
  whereupon the woman, after one swift, intense glance at the boy, turned away
  and walked quickly up the street. I was half disposed to follow her and
  confirm my suspicion as to her identity; but Master Percy had already
  observed me, and it seemed, perhaps, more expedient to get out of sight
  myself than to reveal my presence in attempting to verify a suspicion of
  which I had practically no doubt, and which, even if confirmed, had no
  obvious significance. Accordingly I crossed the road, and having greeted my
  host, was by him conducted down the passage to the studio.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch8"
     id="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; A JACOBITE ROMANCE</h2>

  <p class="first">In the minds of many of us, including myself, there appears
  to be a natural association between the ideas of tea and tobacco. Whether it
  is that both substances are exotic products, adopted from alien races, or
  that each is connected with a confirmed and accepted drug habit, I am not
  quite clear. But there seems to be no doubt that the association exists and
  that the realisation of the one idea begets an imperative impulse to realise
  the other. In conformity with which natural law, when the tea-things had
  been, by the joint efforts of Miss Blake and her brother, removed to the
  curtained repository&mdash;where also dwelt a gas ring and a kettle&mdash;I
  proceeded complacently to bring forth my pipe and the bulging tobacco-pouch
  and to transfer some of the contents of the latter to the former.</p>

  <p>'I am glad to see you smoking,' said Miss Blake as the first cloud of
  incense ascended. 'It gives me the feeling that you are provided with an
  antidote to the documents. I shall have less compunction about the
  reading.'</p>

  <p>'You think that the "tuneless pipe" is similar to the tuneful one in its
  effects on the "savage breast." But I don't want any antidote. I am all agog
  to hear your romance of a cat's eye, that is, if you are going to read out
  the documents.'</p>

  <p>'I thought I would read the copy aloud and get you to check it by the
  originals. Then you can assure Sir Lawrence that it is a true copy.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. I think that is quite a good plan. It is always well to have a copy
  checked and certified correct.'</p>

  <p>'Then I will get the books and we will begin at once. Do you want to hear
  the reading, Percy, or are you going on with your building?'</p>

  <p>'I should like to come and listen, if you don't mind, Winnie,' he replied;
  and as his sister unlocked the cabinet under the window, he seated himself on
  a chair by the now vacant table. Miss Blake took from the cabinet three
  books, one of which&mdash;an ordinary school exercise-book&mdash;she placed
  on the table by her chair.</p>

  <p>'That,' she said, 'is the copy of both originals. This'&mdash;handing to
  me a little leather-covered book, the pages of which were filled with small,
  clearly-written, though faded, handwriting&mdash;'is the abstract of which I
  spoke. This other little book is the fragmentary original which is referred
  to in the abstract. If you are ready I will begin. We will take the abstract
  first.'</p>

  <p>I provided myself with a pencil with which to mark any errors, and having
  opened the little book announced that I was ready.</p>

  <p>'The abstract,' said she, 'was written in 1821, and reads as follows:</p>

  <p>'"A SHORT HISTORY OF THE BLAKES OF BEAUCHAMP BLAKE NEAR WENDOVER IN THE
  COUNTY OF BUCKINGHAMSHIRE, FROM THE YEAR OF OUR LORD 1708."</p>

  <p>'"This history has been written by me for the purpose of preserving a
  record of certain events for the information of my descendants, to whom a
  knowledge of those events may prove of great importance; and its writing has
  become necessary by the circumstance that, whereas the only existing written
  record has been reduced by Time and ill-usage to a collection of disconnected
  fragments, the traditions passed on orally from generation to generation
  become year by year more indistinct and unreliable.</p>

  <p>'"I shall begin with the year 1708, at which time the estate of Beauchamp
  Blake was held by Harold Blake. In this year was born Percival Blake, the
  only son of Harold aforesaid. Seven years later occurred a rising in favour
  of the Royal House of the Stuarts, in which act of rebellion the said Harold
  Blake was suspected (but never accused) of having taken part. In the year
  1743, Harold Blake died and his only son, Percival, succeeded to the
  property.</p>

  <p>'"In or about the year 1742, Percival Blake married a lady named Judith
  Weston (or Western). For some unknown reason this marriage took place
  secretly, and was, for a time at least, kept secret. Possibly the marriage
  would not have been acceptable to Percival's father, or the lady may have
  been a Papist. This latter seems the more probable, inasmuch as the marriage
  was solemnised, not at the church of St Margaret at Beauchamp Blake, but at a
  little church in London near to Aldgate, called St Peter by the Shambles, the
  rector of which, the Reverend Stephen Rumbold, an intimate friend of
  Percival's, became subsequently not only a Papist but a Jesuit. In the next
  year, 1743, a son was born and was christened James. No entry of this birth
  appears in the registers of St Margaret's, so it is probable that it was
  registered at the London church. Unfortunately, this register is incomplete.
  Several pages have been torn out, and as these missing pages belong to the
  years 1742 and 1743, it is to be presumed that they contained the records of
  the marriage and the birth.</p>

  <p>'"About the year 1725 Percival came to London to study medicine; and about
  1729 or 1730 he completed his studies and took his degree at Cambridge, of
  which University he was already a Bachelor of Arts. From this time onwards he
  appears to have practised in London as a physician, and it was probably at
  this period that he made the acquaintance of Judith Western and Stephen
  Rumbold. Even after the death of his father and his own succession to the
  property, he continued to practise his profession, making only occasional
  visits to his estate in Buckinghamshire.</p>

  <p>'"Like his father, Percival Blake was an ardent supporter of the Stuarts,
  and it is believed that he took an active part in the various Jacobite plots
  that were heard of about this time; and when, in 1745, the great rising took
  place, Percival was one of those who hastened to join the forces of the young
  Pretender, a disastrous act, to which all the subsequent misfortunes of the
  family are due.</p>

  <p>'"On the collapse of the Jacobite cause, Percival took immediate measures
  to avert the consequences of his ill-judged action from his own family; and
  in these he displayed a degree of foresight that might well have been
  exhibited earlier. From Scotland he made his way to Beauchamp Blake and
  there, in one of the numerous hiding-places of the old mansion, concealed
  certain important documents connected with the property. It is not quite
  clear what these documents were. Among them appear to have been some of the
  title-deeds, and there is no doubt that they included documents proving the
  validity of his marriage with Judith and the legitimacy of his son James.
  Meanwhile, he had sent his wife and child, with a servant named Jenifer Gray,
  to Hamburg, where they were to wait until he joined them. He himself made his
  way to a port on the East Coast, believed to have been King's Lynn, where he
  embarked, under a false name, on a small vessel bound for Hamburg; but while
  he was waiting for the vessel to sail, he circulated a very circumstantial
  account of his own death by drowning while attempting to escape in an open
  boat.</p>

  <p>'"This was at once a fortunate and unfortunate act; fortunate inasmuch as
  it completely achieved his purpose of preventing the confiscation of the
  property; unfortunate inasmuch as it effectually shut out his own descendants
  from the succession. On the report of his death (unmarried, as was believed,
  and so without issue) a distant cousin, of unquestionable loyalty to the
  reigning house, took possession of the estate without opposition and without
  any suggestion of confiscation.</p>

  <p>'"One thing only, appertaining to the inheritance, Percival took with him.
  Among the family heirlooms was a jewel consisting of a small pendant set with
  a single cymophane (vulgarly known as a cat's eye) and bearing an
  inscription, of which the actual words are unknown, but of which the purport
  was that whosoever should possess the jewel should also possess the Blake
  estate; a foolish statement that seems to have been generally believed in the
  family and to which Percival evidently attached incredible weight. For not
  only did he take the jewel with him but, as will presently appear, he made
  careful provision for its disposal.</p>

  <p>'"From this time onward the history becomes more and more vague. It seems
  that Percival joined his wife and child at Hamburg, and thereafter travelled
  about Germany, plying his profession as a physician. But soon he was
  overtaken by a terrible misfortune. It appears that a robbery had been
  committed by a woman who was said to be a foreigner, and suspicion fell upon
  Judith. She was arrested, and on false evidence, convicted and sent, as a
  punishment, to labour in the mines somewhere in the Harz Mountains. Percival
  made unceasing efforts to obtain her release, but it was three years before
  his efforts were crowned with success. But then, alas, it was too late. The
  poor lady came back to him aged by privation and broken by long-standing
  sickness, only to linger on a few months and then to die in his arms. On her
  release he carried her away to France, and there, at Paris, about the year
  1751, she passed away and is believed to have been buried in the cemetery of
  Pere Lachaise.</p>

  <p>'"The death of his wife, to whom he seems to have been devotedly attached,
  left Percival a broken man; and about eighteen months later, he himself died,
  and is believed to have been buried beside Judith. But in these sad months he
  occupied himself in making provision for the recovery of the family
  inheritance by his posterity when circumstances should have become more
  favourable. To this end he wrote a summary of the events connected with and
  following the Jacobite rising and had it sewn into a little illustrated Book
  of Hours, which, together with the cymophane jewel, he gave into the keeping
  of Jenifer Gray, to be by her given to the child James when he should be old
  enough to be trusted with them. The exact contents of the little book we can
  only surmise from the fragments that remain, but they seem to have been a
  short account of his own actions and vicissitudes, and no doubt gave at least
  a clue to the place in which the documents were hidden. Nor can we tell what
  the exact form of the jewel was or the nature of the inscription, for
  Percival's references to the latter as 'a guide' to his descendants are not
  clearly understandable. At any rate, the jewel has disappeared and the
  written record is reduced to a few fragments. Jenifer Gray (who seems to have
  been an illiterate and foolish woman) apparently gave the little book to the
  child to play with, for the few leaves that remain are covered with childish
  scrawls; and she may have sold the jewel to buy the necessaries of life, for
  she and the boy were evidently but poorly provided for.</p>

  <p>'"On reaching the age of fourteen, James was apprenticed to a cabinetmaker
  in Paris and apparently became very skilful workman. When he was out of his
  time (Jenifer Gray having died in the meantime) he came to England and
  settled in London, where, in time, he established an excellent business.</p>

  <p>'"Into this his son William (my father), was taken, first as an
  apprentice, then as partner and finally as principal. By my father the
  prosperity of the house was so well maintained that he was able to article me
  to an attorney, to whom I am chief clerk at this time of writing.</p>

  <p>'"This record, together with what remains of Percival Blake's manuscript,
  will, I trust, be preserved by my descendants in the hope that it may be the
  instrument by which Providence may hereafter reinstate them in the
  inheritance of their forefathers.</p>

  <p>'"JOHN BLAKE.</p>

  <p>'"16 SYMOND'S INN, LONDON,</p>

  <p>'"20th June 1821."'</p>

  <p>As she finished reading, Miss Blake let the book fall into her lap and
  looked at me as if inviting criticism. I closed the little original, and
  laying it on the table, remarked: 'A very singular and romantic history, and
  a very valuable record. The detailed narrative presents a much more
  convincing case than one would have expected from the bare statement that you
  gave in your evidence. Your great-grandfather was a wise man to commit the
  facts to writing while the memory of the events was comparatively recent. How
  much is there left of Percival's manuscript?'</p>

  <p>'Very little, I am sorry to say,' she replied, picking up the remaining
  volume and handing it to me; 'but I have made a copy of these fragments, too.
  It follows the copy of John Blake's abstract, and I will read it out to you
  if you will check it by the original.'</p>

  <p>I turned the little book over in my hand and examined it curiously. It was
  a tiny volume, bound in gold-tooled calf, now rusty and worn and badly broken
  at the joints. The title-page showed it to be a Book of Hours&mdash;Horae
  Beatae Mariae Virginis&mdash;printed at Antwerp by Bakhasar Moretus and dated
  1634, and on turning over the leaves I perceived that it was illustrated with
  a number of quaint but decorative woodcuts. The inside of the cover seemed to
  have been used as a sort of unofficial birth register. At the top, in very
  faded writing, was inscribed 'Judith Weston,' and underneath a succession of
  names beginning with 'James, son of Percival and Judith Blake, born 3 April
  1743,' and ending with Winifred and Percival, the daughter and son of Peter
  and Agnes Blake. Between the cover and the title-page a number of fly-leaves
  of very thin paper had been stitched in, and those that remained were covered
  with minute writing of a pale, ghostly brown, largely defaced by spots,
  smears, scribblings and childish drawings. But most of them had disappeared,
  and the few that were left hung insecurely to the loosened stitches.</p>

  <p>When I had completed my inspection, I opened the book at the first
  fly-leaf, and adjusting the reading-glass which Miss Blake had placed on the
  table, announced that I was ready; whereupon she resumed her reading.</p>

  <p>'The first page reads: "...to my cousin Leonard, who, as the heir-at-law,
  would, I knew, be watching the course of events. Indeed, I doubt not that if
  he had known of my marriage, he would have used his influence at the Court to
  oust me. But the news of my death I felt sure would bring him forward at
  once, and his loyalty to the German King would make him secure to the
  succession. So he and his brood should keep the nest warm until the clouds
  had passed and the present troubles should be forgotten. Only to my own
  posterity, the true heirs, must be provided a key wherewith to re-enter on
  their inheritance, and to this end I searched the muniment chest and took
  therefrom all the&mdash;"'</p>

  <p>This was the end of the page, and as she broke off. Miss Blake looked
  up.</p>

  <p>'Isn't it exasperating?' said she. 'There seems to be only one page
  missing in this place, but it is the one that contains the vital
  information.'</p>

  <p>'It is not very difficult to guess what he took,' said I. 'Evidently he
  abstracted the title-deeds. But the question is, what did he do with
  them?'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Miss Blake, 'that is the important question, and unfortunately
  we cannot answer it. That he hid them in a secure hiding-place is evident
  from the next two pages. The first reads: "Will Bateman, the plumber, made me
  a tall leaden jar like a black-jack to hold the documents, with a
  close-fitting lid, which we luted on with wax when we had put the documents
  into it. And this jar I set in the hiding-place, and on top of it the great
  two-handled posset-pot that old Martin, the potter, made for my mother when I
  was born; which I prize dearly and would not have it fall into the hands of
  strangers. When all was ready, we sent for the carpenter, who is a safe man
  and loyal to the Prince, and bade him close the chamber, which he did so that
  no eye could detect the opening. So the writings shall be safe until such
  time&mdash;"</p>

  <p>'The next page reads: "...and the other documents which I obtained from Mr
  Halford, the attorney. I had feared that their absence might be a bar to the
  succession, but he assured me it was not so, but only that it would hinder
  the sale of the property. So I am satisfied; and I am confident that Leonard
  will never guess the hiding-place in which they are bestowed, nor will he
  ever dream what that hiding-place conceals."</p>

  <p>'"When I had done this I began forthwith to spread the report of my death
  among strangers, both in the coffee-houses and at the inn whereat I lodged
  while I was waiting for the ship to sail from&mdash;" There the page ends,
  and there seems to be quite a lot missing, for the next one speaks of the
  disaster as having already occurred.</p>

  <p>'"Nor, indeed, would they listen to her protestations (spoken, as they
  were, in a strange tongue), and still less to my entreaties. And so she was
  borne away from my sight, brave, cheerful, and dignified to the last, as
  befitted an English gentlewoman, though it seemed then as if we should never
  look on one another again. So I left with the child and Jenifer and must
  needs continue to live at Eisenach (that I might be near my darling, though I
  could never see her) and must minister for my daily bread to the wretches who
  people that accursed land&mdash;"</p>

  <p>'There seems to be only one or two pages missing here, for the next page
  runs: "...this joyful day (as I had hoped it would be) and set forth from
  Eisenach with the child and Jenifer to meet my poor darling on the road. A
  few miles out we saw the cart approaching, filled with the prisoners released
  from the mines. I looked among them, but at first saw her not. Then a haggard
  old woman held out her arms to me and I looked again. The old woman was
  Judith, my wife! But, O God, what a wreck! She was wasted to a very skeleton,
  her skin was like old parchment, her hair, that had been like spun gold, was
  turned to a strange black and her whole aspect&mdash;"' Miss Blake paused and
  said in a low voice: 'It is a dreadful picture. Poor Judith! And poor
  Percival! And the rest of the story is just as sad. The next page takes up
  the thread just after Judith's death.</p>

  <p>'"And when it was over and I saw them shovel in the earth, I felt moved to
  beg them not to fill the grave but to leave room for me. I went away through
  the snow with Jenifer and the boy. But I was alone. Judith had been all to
  me, and my heart was under the new-turned sods. Yet I bethought me, if it
  should please God to take me, I must not go without leaving some chart to
  guide my son back to our home, should such return be possible in his
  lifetime, or to guide his children or his children's children. Therefore,
  that same sad day I began to write this history on the fly-leaves that my
  dear wife had had sewn into her little book of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>'There seems to be only one page missing before the next, but it was an
  important one, so far as we can judge. Indeed, it almost appears as if all
  the most significant pages were lost. The next page reads:</p>

  <p>"...gave me a string from his bass viol, which he says will be the best of
  all. So that matter is as secure as care and judgement can make it. This book
  and the precious bauble I purpose to hold until I feel the hand of death upon
  me, and then I shall give both into the keeping of Jenifer, bidding her guard
  them jealously as treasures beyond price, until my son attains the age of
  fourteen. Then she shall give them to him, adjuring him to preserve the book
  in a safe place and never to lend or show it to any person whatsoever, and to
  wear the trinket hung around his neck under his clothing so that none shall
  know-"</p>

  <p>'That is the last complete page. There remains a half-page, which seems to
  have been the concluding one. It reads: "...and that is all that I can do,
  since one cannot look into the future. When the time is ripe, my son, or his
  descendants, can go forward with open eyes. This history and the trinket
  shall guide them. Wherefore I pray that both may be treasured by them to whom
  I thus pass on the inheritance. "'</p>

  <p>As Miss Blake finished her reading she closed the book and sat looking
  thoughtfully at her brother, who had listened with rapt attention to the
  pathetic story. Half-reluctantly I shut the little Book of Hours and laid it
  on the table.</p>

  <p>'It is a tragic little history,' I said, 'and these soiled and tattered
  leaves and the faded writing and the old-fashioned phraseology make it
  somehow very real and vivid. I wonder what became of the cat's eye pendant.
  Is nothing at all known of the way in which it was lost?'</p>

  <p>'Nothing,' she replied. 'The boy James was only seven years old when his
  father died, so he would hardly have remembered, even if he knew of the
  existence of the jewel. It may have been lost or stolen, or, more probably,
  Jenifer sold it to buy the necessaries of life. She must have been pretty
  hard pressed at times.'</p>

  <p>'She must have been a duffer,' said Percy, 'if she sold it after what she
  had been told. Couldn't she have popped it and kept up the interest?'</p>

  <p>'You seem to know a good deal about these matters, Percy,' his sister
  remarked with a smile.</p>

  <p>'Well,' said he, 'I should think everybody knows how to raise the wind if
  they are hard up. There's no need to sell things when you've got an
  uncle.'</p>

  <p>'We don't know that she did sell it,' said Miss Blake. 'She may even have
  "popped" it, to use your elegant expression. All that we know is that it
  disappeared. And now it has disappeared again, if this pendant that was
  stolen was really the Blake pendant.'</p>

  <p>'Is there any reason to suppose that it was?' I asked.</p>

  <p>Only that it agreed with what little we know of the missing jewel, and
  cat's eye pendants must be very rare. Unfortunately, the Connoisseur article
  doesn't help us much. It gives a photograph, from which we could identify the
  pendant if we knew exactly what it was like, but the description fails just
  at the vital point. It doesn't say anything about the inscription on the
  back. It was in order to find out what that inscription was that I asked poor
  Mr Drayton to let me see the jewel. Would you like to see the
  photograph?'</p>

  <p>'I should, very much, if you have a copy.'</p>

  <p>She fetched from the cabinet a copy of the Connoisseur, and having found
  the article, handed the open magazine to me. There were two photographs on
  the page, one of the little book-locket and the other of a simple,
  lozenge-shaped pendant of somewhat plain design, set with a single, rather
  large stone, smooth-cut and nearly circular. The letterpress gave no
  particulars and did not even mention the inscription.</p>

  <p>'I suppose,' said I, 'there is no doubt that this pendant did bear an
  inscription of some kind. There is no reference to it here.'</p>

  <p>'No particular reference, unfortunately. But this was a collection of
  inscribed objects. Every specimen bore an inscription if it was only a name
  and a date. The article, you will see, says so, and Mr Drayton told me so
  himself.'</p>

  <p>'You didn't ask him what was written on this pendant?'</p>

  <p>'No; I didn't want to tell him about our family tradition unless I found
  that it really was the Blake pendant. Perhaps I might not have told him even
  then, for the inscription might have told us all we wanted to know; though I
  must confess to a certain superstitious hankering to possess the jewel, or,
  at least, to see it in Percy's possession.'</p>

  <p>'You were telling Sir Lawrence that proceedings to establish a claim were
  actually begun by your father.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, but our solicitor was not at all hopeful, and the counsel whom he
  retained very strongly advised my father not to go on. He thought that, with
  the apparently well-founded belief in Percival's death and the absence of any
  real evidence of his marriage and survival, we had no case. So the action was
  settled out of court and the tenant at the time agreed to pay most of the
  costs.'</p>

  <p>'Do you remember who was the solicitor for the tenant?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. His name was Brodribb, and my father thought he treated us very
  fairly.'</p>

  <p>'He probably did. I know Mr Brodribb very well, and I have the highest
  opinion of him as a lawyer and as a man. I have often been retained by him,
  and I have usually been very well satisfied to be associated with him. Do you
  know what the position was when your father began his action? I mean as to
  the possible heirs. Was the present tenant then in possession?'</p>

  <p>'No; he was a Mr Arnold Blake, a widower with no surviving children. But
  he knew the present tenant, Arthur Blake, although they were not very near
  relatives, and was prepared to contest the claim on his behalf. Arthur Blake
  was then, I think, in Australia.'</p>

  <p>'And I gather that you don't know much about him?'</p>

  <p>'No, excepting that I understand that he is unmarried, which is all that
  really matters to us.'</p>

  <p>'And did Brodribb know about this little book and John Blake's
  abstract?'</p>

  <p>'I think my father must have told him that we had some authentic details
  of the family history, but I don't know whether he actually showed him the
  originals.'</p>

  <p>'And with regard to the pedigree since Percival. Have the marriages and
  births all been proved?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. My father had them investigated, and obtained certificates of all of
  them, and I have those certificates, though I am afraid they are never likely
  to be called for.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' I said, 'as a lawyer, I shouldn't like to hold out any hopes even
  if the death of the present tenant without issue should seem to create a
  favourable situation. But, of course, if it should ever become possible to
  prove the marriage of Percival and Judith and the birth of James, that would
  alter the position very materially. And now I must tear myself away. I have
  been most keenly interested in hearing your romance, and I have no doubt that
  Sir Lawrence will be equally so. If you will give me the copy, I will leave
  it at his chambers tonight or tomorrow morning.'</p>

  <p>She gave me the manuscript book, which I slipped into my pocket, and then
  she and Percy escorted me across the yard and let me out at the wicket.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch9"
     id="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; EXIT MOAKEY</h2>

  <p class="first">From Jacob Street I made my way to the Temple with the
  intention of letting Thorndyke look through Miss Blake's
  manuscript&mdash;since he had expressed a wish to see it&mdash;before
  delivering it to Drayton. And as I sat on the omnibus roof I reflected on the
  events of the afternoon. In spite of my legal training and experience the
  romance of the lost inheritance had taken a strong hold on me. The two
  narratives, and especially the older one, diffused an atmosphere of reality
  that was very convincing. It was practically certain that the two manuscripts
  were genuine, and if they were, there could be no doubt that my young friend
  Percy was the direct descendant of the Jacobite fugitive, Percival Blake. Nor
  could there be much reasonable doubt that the descent was legitimate.
  Percival plainly referred to Judith as his wife and there seemed to be no
  reason for supposing that the marriage had not taken place at the time stated
  in John Blake's abstract. In short, I found myself wondering whether Mr Peter
  Blake's counsel had not been a little over-cautious, or whether he might not
  have been influenced by a possible financial straitness on the part of the
  said Peter unfavourable to a warmly-contested action at law.</p>

  <p>If he had been over-cautious, it was unfortunate, for he had missed an
  opportunity. The death of Arnold Blake without a direct successor would have
  made things comparatively easy for a new claimant with a good case, whereas
  now, with Arthur Blake in possession, the difficulties would be much greater.
  It is one thing to maintain a claim against other claimants, but quite
  another to oust a tenant who has established a title by actual possession.
  And, to judge by their surroundings and mode of life, my friends were but
  poorly equipped for any action at all.</p>

  <p>From the manuscripts and their story my thoughts strayed to the woman whom
  I had seen examining Miss Blake's nameplate. I did not like that incident at
  all. It might mean nothing. The woman might happen to live in the
  neighbourhood and have made her inspection from mere idle curiosity. But that
  was not what the appearances suggested. The woman had been at the inquest,
  and from Hampstead she must have travelled in the same tramcar that had
  conveyed Miss Blake and me. Then she had seemed to have followed Miss Blake,
  at some distance, on the opposite side of the road. There was a suggestion of
  purpose in the whole proceeding that I found disquieting and rather sinister,
  and it was not made less so by the very unprepossessing appearance of the
  woman herself.</p>

  <p>When I let myself into our chambers with my key&mdash;or rather
  Jervis'&mdash;I found the sitting-room vacant; but as an inspection of the
  hat-rack in the lobby suggested that Thorndyke was somewhere on the premises,
  I went up to the laboratory, and there I found him in company with Polton and
  an uncanny-looking apparatus consisting of a microscope with an attachment of
  miniature hot-water pipes.</p>

  <p>'This is a new form of magic,' said I, 'at least it is new to me. What is
  going on?'</p>

  <p>'This is just a microscope with a warm stage,' Thorndyke explained. 'We
  are making it a hot stage for the purposes of the present experiment.'</p>

  <p>'And what is the experiment?' I asked with sudden curiosity, for I had
  just observed that the object on the microscope stage was an irregular-shaped
  piece of glass on which I could distinguish a very clear fingerprint.</p>

  <p>'The experiment is connected with the fingerprints on the piece of glass
  that you so very fortunately secured at "The Rowans." This is a portion of it
  which I have cut off with a glazier's diamond and which bears a duplicate
  print. You remember my pointing out to you that a real fingerprint&mdash;as
  distinguished from a statistical or mathematical fingerprint&mdash;has
  chemical and physical properties. Well, we are endeavouring to determine the
  chemical nature of the substance of which this fingerprint is composed by
  inference from its physical properties. We are now ascertaining its
  melting-point; in fact I may say that we have ascertained it. It is
  fifty-three degrees centigrade. And this fact, in conjunction with its other
  observed physical properties, tells us that it is Japanese wax.'</p>

  <p>'Indeed,' said I. 'Then that goes to show that the man who made these
  fingerprints had been handling Japanese wax.'</p>

  <p>'That is the obvious inference.'</p>

  <p>'Does that throw any light on the man's personality or occupation? What is
  Japanese wax used for?'</p>

  <p>'For a variety of purposes. Very largely for the manufacture of wax
  polishes for boots and furniture, for the preparation of foundry wax and the
  various waxes used by jewellers, engravers, and lapidaries. It is also used
  in pharmacy in the making of certain plasters and cerates.'</p>

  <p>'Do you think,' I asked, 'that this man could have got it on his fingers
  by touching the furniture?'</p>

  <p>'No,' replied Thorndyke. 'The cabinets were French-polished, and I saw no
  trace of wax polish on them. Besides, there is more wax than would have been
  taken up in that way.'</p>

  <p>'Does the presence of this wax suggest anything to you?'</p>

  <p>'Well,' replied Thorndyke, 'of course there are possibilities. But one
  mustn't expect to apply a fact as soon as it is discovered. We have
  ascertained what this substance is. Let us put this item of knowledge in its
  proper mental pigeon-hole and hope that we shall find a use for it
  presently.'</p>

  <p>'I have a strong suspicion, Thorndyke,' said I, 'that you have found a use
  for it already. However, I won't press you. I know my place. The mantle of
  Jervis is on me&mdash;and trailing a few yards along the ground. I am not
  permitted to cross-examine my reverend senior.'</p>

  <p>'There really isn't any need for you to do so,' said he. 'I have no
  exclusive information. You are in possession of all the facts that are known
  to me.'</p>

  <p>That is not strictly true, you know, Thorndyke,' I objected. 'We share the
  mere observed facts of this case, I admit; but you have a body of general
  knowledge which I have not, and which gives many of these observed facts a
  significance that is hidden from me. However, we will let that pass. You are
  the investigating wizard, I am only a sort of familiar demon. Which reminds
  me that I have been devilling for you this afternoon. I think you said that
  you would like to look over the documents relating to Miss Blake's
  claim.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I should be interested to see them.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I've got a copy, which I have compared with the originals, and
  which I am to hand over Drayton. Would you like to have it now?'</p>

  <p>'Yes; I have finished up here. Let us go downstairs and look over the
  documents together.'</p>

  <p>'You had better take the copy down with you and run through it while I am
  having a wash. Then I will come down and hear your reverend pronouncements on
  the case.' I produced the manuscript book from my pocket and having handed it
  to him, retired to the bedroom of which I was tenant ex officio, while he
  descended to the sitting-room with the manuscript in his hand.</p>

  <p>When I came down after a leisurely wash and brush up, I found Thorndyke
  sitting with the open book before him and a slip of paper and a pencil in his
  hand. Apparently he had finished the reading and was jotting down a few dates
  and other particulars.</p>

  <p>'This is a singularly interesting story, Anstey,' said he, 'and
  extraordinarily picturesque in its setting. It enables us to understand Miss
  Blake's view as to her brother's claim, which sounded a little extravagant
  when baldly stated in her evidence. And, in fact, it looks as if that claim
  were a perfectly sound one. If it were only possible to produce satisfactory
  evidence of the marriage of Percival and Judith Blake and of the legitimacy
  of James, I should take the case into Court with perfect
  confidence&mdash;under suitable conditions, of course.'</p>

  <p>'You mean, if there were any question as to the succession.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. And such a question may arise at any moment if the present tenant is
  unmarried. It seems to me a matter of vital importance to find out as much as
  possible about this present tenant, Arthur Blake; I mean as to his heir, his
  relatives and connections generally, and the chances of his marrying. Miss
  Blake's brother is but a child, and many things may happen before he is a
  middle-aged man.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' I agreed. 'It would be a good deal more to the point than fussing
  about this ridiculous cat's eye. Miss Blake's keenness about that is a
  mystery to me.'</p>

  <p>'Don't forget,' said Thorndyke, 'that the pendant is believed to bear an
  inscription that might be helpful to the possessor, though it is difficult to
  imagine in what way it could be.'</p>

  <p>'Very difficult,' said I. 'But it isn't the inscription that she is so
  keen on, it is the thing itself. She has a sort of half-belief in some occult
  quality inherent in this jewel, in fact she is infected by the family
  superstition. It is incomprehensible to me.'</p>

  <p>'It is always difficult for one temperament to understand another,' said
  he. 'But this state of mind is quite a common one. That absurd little bone of
  Halliburton's is a case in point, and quite a representative instance. It was
  obviously a mascot&mdash;that is to say, an object credited with occult
  properties and the power to influence events; and how many people are there
  who, openly or secretly, cherish similar charms or fetishes. The Stock
  Exchange, the Stage, and the Sporting Clubs are full of them.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' that is true,' I agreed; and then, suddenly remembering the
  mysterious woman, I said: 'By the way, a rather queer thing happened this
  afternoon. I accompanied Miss Blake home from Hampstead, but I got off the
  tram to get some tobacco and let her go on ahead. She had gone indoors before
  I arrived at the studio, and as I was approaching her house, I saw a woman
  cross the road and go deliberately up to the door and read the name on the
  plate.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Thorndyke, looking at me interrogatively.</p>

  <p>'Well, the point is that that woman had followed us from Hampstead.'</p>

  <p>'Indeed!' he exclaimed with sudden gravity. 'You are sure of that?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. I recognised her before she crossed. You may have noticed her at the
  inquest, a brassy-haired baggage with a spotted veil and a face powdered like
  a clown's.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I noticed her. She was sitting near to you, by the door. I took
  particular note of her because she stood up while Miss Blake was giving her
  evidence, and seemed deeply interested in her and in you.'</p>

  <p>'Well, that is the woman.'</p>

  <p>'But this is very serious, Anstey. What a pity you didn't follow her and
  find out where she went to!'</p>

  <p>'I had half a mind to, but Master Percy&mdash;Miss Blake's
  brother&mdash;came to the door at that moment and saw me, so it was hardly
  possible.'</p>

  <p>'It is very unfortunate,' said Thorndyke. 'You see the importance of the
  matter? Miss Blake stood up in open Court and swore that she was confident
  she could identify the man who stabbed her. Now that man is not only a
  robber. He is, at least, an accessory to the murder of Andrew Drayton, and
  his apprehension would probably reveal the identity of the actual
  murderer&mdash;if he is not the murderer himself&mdash;to say nothing of the
  charge against him of wounding with intent. Of course, if the police are
  right about those fingerprints, there is not so much in it. They will arrest
  Moakey and probably get the other man as well. But if the police clue should
  fail&mdash;and I should not be surprised if it does&mdash;Miss Blake
  represents the whole of the evidence against these two men. Apart from her, a
  conviction would be impossible unless the men were taken with the stolen
  property in their possession, which they are not likely to be. Even if the
  men were arrested they could not be identified, excepting by her, and would
  have to be released. I consider that her position is one of extreme danger.
  Did you tell her of this incident?'</p>

  <p>'No; I thought there was no use in making her uneasy.'</p>

  <p>'She ought to be warned, Anstey. And she ought to be most cautious about
  exposing herself to the possibility of an attack of any kind. I am expecting
  a visit from Superintendent Miller&mdash;he sent me a note asking for an
  interview at seven o'clock, so he will be here in a few minutes. When we have
  seen him, we shall know how the case stands, but the fact of his wanting an
  interview suggests that the police bark has got into shoal water.'</p>

  <p>Punctually at seven o'clock the Superintendent's characteristic official
  rat-tat announced his arrival, and as I let him in, a subtle something in his
  manner seemed to confirm Thorndyke's surmises.</p>

  <p>'I suppose,' said he as he took the armchair and lighted the customary
  cigar, 'you've guessed what I wanted to talk to you about? It's this Drayton
  case, you know.'</p>

  <p>Thorndyke nodded. 'Any new developments?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'Well, yes, there are. We've got a bit of a setback. It seems that the
  fingerprint people made a mistake. Never known them to do such a thing
  before, but I suppose nobody is infallible. It turns out that those
  fingerprints are not Moakey's after all.'</p>

  <p>As the Superintendent made this statement, he fixed a stony gaze on the
  opposite wall. Glancing at Thorndyke, I noted that my colleague's countenance
  had taken on that peculiar woodenness that I had learned to associate with
  intense attention not unmingled with suspicion.</p>

  <p>'I can't think how they came to make such a stupid mistake,' the
  Superintendent continued, still staring fixedly at the wall. 'Might have got
  us into a horrid mess.'</p>

  <p>'I should have thought,' said Thorndyke, 'that mistakes might easily be
  made with such multitudes of records. Whose fingerprints are they?'</p>

  <p>'Ah!' said Miller, 'there you are. We don't know. They don't seem to have
  'em at the registry. So our only clue is gone.'</p>

  <p>'Haven't you opened up in any other direction?' Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>'We've notified all the likely fences, of course, but that's no good.
  These coveys are not likely to try to plant the stuff with a murder charge
  hanging over them. Then we made some inquiries about that man Halliburton.
  But they turned out a frost. The chap has disappeared and left no address.
  We've got his signature, and we've got a dam silly rabbit bone that some fool
  has taken the trouble to cut a pattern on, that he left behind at the hotel;
  and as he seemed to value the thing, we put an advertisement in the papers
  saying that it had been found. But there are no answers up to the present,
  and not likely to be. And then Halliburton probably had nothing to do with
  the affair. So we're rather up a tree. And it's annoying, after thinking it
  was all plain sailing, and letting the papers give out that we were in full
  cry. Of course, they are all agog for the next act&mdash;and, by the way, one
  of them has got a portrait of you&mdash;I think I've got it. Yes, here it
  is.'</p>

  <p>He produced from his pocket a copy of the Evening Courier and opened it
  out. On the front page was an excellent portrait of my colleague, with the
  descriptive title: 'Dr John Thorndyke, the famous criminal expert, whose
  services are being retained in the case.'</p>

  <p>'That ought to help you, sir,' said the Superintendent with a grin. 'You
  won't be a stranger to our friends if you should happen to meet them. It is a
  pity their photographs can't be given, too.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, it would be more to the point. But now, Miller, what is it that you
  want me to do? I assume that you have come to suggest some sort of
  co-operation?'</p>

  <p>'Well,' said Miller, 'you are retained in the case, and I rather suspect
  that Sir Lawrence would like you to carry on independently. But there is no
  sense in our getting at cross-purposes.'</p>

  <p>'Not the least,' Thorndyke agreed. 'It is a criminal case, and our objects
  are identical&mdash;to secure the offenders and recover the property. Do I
  understand that you are prepared to offer me facilities?'</p>

  <p>'What facilities do you want?'</p>

  <p>'At this moment I am not wanting any, excepting that I should like to look
  at the fingerprints. There would be no objection to that. I suppose?'</p>

  <p>The Superintendent looked uncomfortable. 'I don't know why there should
  be,' said he, 'but you know what Singleton and his crowd are. They don't like
  unofficial investigators in their department. And,' Miller added with a grin,
  'they aren't very fond of you, and no wonder; they haven't forgotten that
  Hornby case. But it wouldn't help you a bit if you did look at the prints.
  You can take it from me that Moakey is not the man. There's no mistake this
  time. They have checked the fingerprints quite carefully, and you can rely on
  what they say. So it would be no use your examining them&mdash;unless,' he
  added with a shrewd look at Thorndyke, 'you've got a fingerprint registry of
  your own.'</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact it was known to me that Thorndyke had a collection in
  a card-index file, but it was a mere appendix to the reports of cases dealt
  with, which had no bearing on the present case.</p>

  <p>'I daresay you are right,' Thorndyke agreed 'One doesn't learn much from
  stray fingerprints. And you've nothing more to tell us?'</p>

  <p>'Nothing,' was the reply. 'And you, sir? I suppose you haven't struck
  anything that would give us a lead?'</p>

  <p>'I have not begun to work at the case,' said Thorndyke. 'I have been
  waiting for your report, to see if the case was as simple as it
  appeared.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Miller, 'it did look simple. Seemed as if there was nothing to
  do but make the arrest. And now we have nothing to go on at all. Well,' here
  he rose and began to move towards the door, 'if we can help you in anyway I
  hope you will let us know, and, of course, if you can put us on to anything
  we shall thank you kindly.'</p>

  <p>As our visitor's footsteps died away on the stairs, Thorndyke softly
  closed the door and moved to the window, where he stood meditatively
  regarding the retreating officer as the latter crossed to Crown Office
  Row.</p>

  <p>'That was a queer interview,' said he.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' I agreed 'I don't see why he made the appointment. He hadn't much
  to tell us.'</p>

  <p>'I am not quite sure of that,' said Thorndyke. 'I have a sort of feeling
  that he came here to tell us something and didn't tell it&mdash;at least he
  thinks he didn't.'</p>

  <p>'It seemed to me that he told us nothing,' said I.</p>

  <p>'It probably seemed so to him,' replied Thorndyke. 'Whereas, if I am not
  mistaken, he has made us a free gift of a really valuable piece of
  information.'</p>

  <p>'Well, it may be so,' said I, 'but for my part, I can't see that he gave
  us a particle of information excepting that the case against Moakey has
  fallen through. Perhaps it is a technical point that is outside my
  range.'</p>

  <p>'Not at all,' he replied. 'It is just a matter of observation and
  comparison. You were present when Miller called last time and you have been
  present today. You have heard all that passed and have had the privilege of
  observing the Superintendent's by no means unexpressive countenance. Just
  recall the conversation and consider it by the light of all the known
  circumstances and see if it does not yield a very interesting
  suggestion.'</p>

  <p>I recalled without difficulty the brief conversation and reflected on it
  in connection with the Superintendent's rather aggressively nonchalant air.
  But from that reflection nothing emerged but wonder at my colleague's amazing
  power of rapid inference. Finally I resolved to write down the conversation
  and think it over at my leisure.</p>

  <p>'I take it,' said I, 'that you don't believe Miller is in such a fog as he
  professes to be?'</p>

  <p>'On the contrary,' Thorndyke replied, 'I think that he is not only in a
  fog but hard aground. The fact that he meant to conceal and in effect
  disclosed (as I believe) is a leading fact. But I don't think he realises
  whither it leads. And, of course, it may not be a fact, after all. I may have
  drawn an erroneous inference. Obviously, the first thing to do is to test my
  hypothesis rigorously. In twenty-four hours I shall know whether it is true
  or false, since the means of verification are quite simple.'</p>

  <p>'I am glad of that,' I said sourly, 'for the fog in which you assume that
  Miller is enveloped is clear daylight compared to that which surrounds
  me.'</p>

  <p>'I think you will find that the fog will clear up under the influence of a
  little reflection,' said Thorndyke. 'But we are forgetting Miss Blake. You
  see the bearing of Miller's tidings on her position. Moakey is out of the
  case. The fingerprints are unknown, and therefore practically valueless. The
  police evidently have no clue at all. Miss Blake represents the only danger
  that threatens these men, and we may be pretty sure that they know it. If she
  could be eliminated their position would be absolutely secure. And, remember,
  these are desperate men to whom a human life is of no account when set
  against their own safety. It is an unseemly hour at which to call on a lady,
  but I think she ought to be warned without delay.'</p>

  <p>'I entirely agree with you,' said I. 'We can't stand on ceremony; and
  after all, it is barely eight o'clock. A taxi will take us there in quarter
  of an hour.'</p>

  <p>'Then let us start at once,' said he, stepping into the lobby for his hat
  and stick. Leaving a slip of paper on the table for Polton's information, we
  set forth together and walked rapidly up Inner Temple Lane to the gate. As we
  emerged, a taxi-cab drew up to deposit a passenger and we hurried forward to
  secure the reversion when the present tenant should give up possession. A few
  moments later we had taken our seats and were bowling up Chancery Lane to the
  soft hum of the taxi's engine.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; A TIMELY WARNING</h2>

  <p class="first">As the cab rolled swiftly through the quietening streets I
  turned over once more the two statements that had been made by Superintendent
  Miller and compared them. Together they had yielded to the amazingly quick
  intelligence of my friend Thorndyke something that the speaker had not
  intended to convey. What was the something? The first statement had set forth
  that the fingerprints were those of Joseph Hedges&mdash;or Moakey, as his
  associates had nicknamed him; the second had set forth that the fingerprints
  were not his but those of some person who had yet to be identified. The two
  statements contradicted one another, of course, but the first was admittedly
  based upon a mistake. What was the fact that emerged from the
  contradiction?</p>

  <p>I revolved the question again and again without seeing any glimmer of
  light. And then, suddenly, the simple explanation burst upon me. Of course!
  The prints were those of fingers smeared with Japanese wax. But Japanese wax
  is used for making furniture polish. There was the solution of this profound
  mystery. They were Mrs Benham's fingerprints&mdash;or perhaps those of the
  murdered man&mdash;made in the process of applying furniture polish to the
  cabinet. This, the only clue, evaporated into a myth and left Miss Blake's
  identification the only link with the vanished murderer.</p>

  <p>'I think I have found the solution to the fingerprint problem, Thorndyke,'
  said I.</p>

  <p>'Ah!' said he, 'I thought you would if you reflected on it. What is
  it?'</p>

  <p>'They are Mrs Benham's fingerprints, or else Drayton's. They were made in
  the course of polishing the furniture.'</p>

  <p>'An excellent suggestion, Anstey,' he replied, 'which doesn't seem to have
  occurred to the police. I suspected it as soon as I saw the waxy material of
  the fingerprints. It doesn't happen to be the correct explanation, I am glad
  to say, for it would be a singularly unilluminating one. I took the
  fingerprints both of Mrs. Benham and the deceased this morning before the
  inquest, but I didn't think it necessary to mention the matter to the police.
  It is quite clear to me that they are not laying their cards on the table. In
  point of fact, they have only one card, and my impression is that they are
  mistaking the back of that for the face. But here we are at our
  destination.'</p>

  <p>We sprang out of the cab, and having dismissed it, gave a pull at the
  studio bell. The wicket was opened by Miss Blake herself, and I hastened to
  make the necessary apologies.</p>

  <p>'I have come back again, you see, Miss Blake, and with reinforcements. It
  is an unholy time for making a call, but we have come on a matter of
  business. Dr. Thorndyke thought it advisable that you should be told
  something and given certain advice without delay.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' she said graciously, 'you are both very welcome, business or no
  business. Won't you come in?'</p>

  <p>'Is Percy in the studio?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. He has finished his home lessons and is doing a little building
  before going to bed.'</p>

  <p>'Then we had better say what we have to say here, or perhaps in the
  passage.'</p>

  <p>We stepped through the wicket and closed it, and as we stood in the dark
  entry, Miss Blake remarked: This is very secret and portentous. You are
  filling me with curiosity.'</p>

  <p>'Then we will proceed to satisfy it. To begin with, do you remember a
  woman who jostled us rather rudely at the door when we were going in to the
  inquest?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I remember the incident, but I didn't notice the woman particularly,
  except that she gave me a rather impertinent stare and that she was a
  horrid-looking woman.'</p>

  <p>'Well, she either lives about here or she followed us deliberately from
  Hampstead. She must have come on the same car as we did; for when I turned
  into Jacob Street I saw her prowling up the opposite side of the road, and
  when she came opposite this house, she crossed and looked at the number on
  the door&mdash;and the name on your plate.'</p>

  <p>'That was very inquisitive of her,' said Miss Blake. 'But does it
  matter?'</p>

  <p>'It may be of no significance at all,' said Thorndyke. 'But under the
  special circumstances it would be unwise to ignore the warning that it may
  convey.'</p>

  <p>'What are the special circumstances?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'They are these,' he replied. 'You heard Inspector Badger say in his
  evidence this morning that the police have a very promising clue? Well, that
  clue has broken off short. I believe the police have now no clue at all, and
  the murderers pretty certainly know it. But you stated publicly that you are
  confident that you could identify the man whom you saw. That statement is
  certain to be known, or to become known, to these men; and they will
  consequently know that you are a serious menace to their safety, and the only
  one; that your ability to recognise one of them is the only circumstance that
  stands between them and absolute, perfect security. But for this one fact
  they could walk abroad, safe from any possible recognition. They could stand
  outside Scotland Yard and snap their fingers at the police. Now, I don't want
  to be an alarmist. But it is necessary to recognise a danger and take the
  necessary means to guard against it. You see what I mean?'</p>

  <p>'I think so. You mean that if I were out of the way these men would be
  safe from any possibility of discovery, and that it is consequently to their
  interest to put me out of the way.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, stated bluntly, that is the position. And you know what the
  characters of these men are.'</p>

  <p>'They are certainly not persons who would stick at trifles. Yes, I must
  admit that your view of the position seems a reasonable one, though I hope
  things are not as bad as you fear. But what precautions could I take?'</p>

  <p>'I suggest that, for the present, you don't go out after dark&mdash;at any
  rate, not alone; that you avoid going about alone as far as is possible, that
  you especially shun all unfrequented places where you might be suddenly
  attacked, and that, on all occasions, you bear this danger in mind in
  considering any unusual circumstances.'</p>

  <p>'All this sounds rather alarming,' she said uneasily.</p>

  <p>'It is alarming,' Thorndyke agreed, 'and I am extremely sorry to have to
  impress it on you. But I would further impress on you that you have
  friends&mdash;two of them are now present&mdash;who are deeply concerned as
  to your safety and who would consider it a privilege to be called upon at any
  time for help or advice. I am always at your service, and I am sure Mr.
  Anstey is too, as well as Sir Lawrence Drayton.'</p>

  <p>'Then,' said Miss Blake, 'the compensations are greater than the evil for
  which they compensate. I welcome the danger if it brings me such kind
  friends. And now you really must come in for a little while, or Percy will
  accuse me of gossiping with "followers" at the gate.'</p>

  <p>She led the way down the paved passage and I steered Thorndyke with an
  expert hand past the scattered monoliths and the unfinished tombstone until
  we reached the door, where Miss Blake stopped to hold aside the curtain. As
  we entered Percy looked up from his work and then, in his quaint,
  self-possessed way came forward to welcome us.</p>

  <p>'How do you like my tower now it's finished, Mr. Anstey?' he asked,
  regarding his work complacently, with his head on one side.</p>

  <p>We stood by him looking at the building&mdash;a model of a church tower
  some three feet in height-and I observed with a sort of proprietary pride
  that Thorndyke was deeply impressed.</p>

  <p>'This is really a remarkable piece of work,' said he. 'Where do you get
  your bricks?'</p>

  <p>'I make them of clay,' replied Percy, 'and let them dry hard. I make one
  as a model and make a plaster mould of it. Then all the rest are just
  squeezes from the mould. So I can get any shaped bricks that I like, and as
  many of them as I want. It's much cheaper than buying them, and besides, the
  bought bricks are no use for serious work.'</p>

  <p>'No,' Thorndyke agreed, 'you couldn't build a tower like that with
  ready-made bricks, at least with none that I have ever seen. Are you going to
  be an architect?'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' the boy replied gravely, 'if we can afford it. If not I shall be a
  mason. Mr Wingrave&mdash;out in the yard, you know&mdash;lets me do a bit of
  stone-cutting sometimes. I shouldn't mind being a mason, but I should like to
  work on buildings, not on tombstones. I love buildings.'</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked at the boy with keen and sympathetic interest. 'It is a
  good thing,' said he, 'to know what you want and to have a definite bent and
  purpose in life. I should think you ought to be a happy man and a useful one
  if you keep up your enthusiasm. Don't you think so, Miss Blake?'</p>

  <p>'I do indeed,' she replied. 'Percy has a real passion for buildings and he
  knows quite a lot about them. His copy of Parker is nearly worn out. And I
  don't see why he shouldn't be an architect and make his hobby his
  living.'</p>

  <p>As she was speaking, I looked at her and noticed that she was wearing the
  locket suspended from a bead necklace.</p>

  <p>'I see you have taken your new acquisition into wear,' I remarked.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' she replied. 'I have just hooked it to this necklace, but I must
  get some more secure attachment. Have you seen this locket, Dr
  Thorndyke?'</p>

  <p>'No,' he answered, and as she unhooked it and gave it to him to inspect,
  he continued: 'This is what poor Mr Drayton used to call his "little Sphinx,"
  isn't it?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, because it seemed always to be propounding riddles. But the riddles
  are inside.'</p>

  <p>'One of them is outside,' said Thorndyke, 'though it is not a very
  difficult one. I mean the peculiar construction and workmanship.'</p>

  <p>'What is there unusual about that?' she asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>'Well,' he replied, 'it is not ordinary jeweller's construction. The
  normal way to make a locket is to build it up of sheet metal. The sides would
  be made first by bending a stout strip into a hoop of the proper
  shape&mdash;nearly square, in this case&mdash;and joining the ends with
  solder. Then the back and front would be soldered on to the hoop and the
  latter cut through vertically with a fine saw, dividing the locket into two
  exactly similar halves. Then the hinge and the suspension ring would be
  soldered on, and the flange fastened in with solder. But in this case the
  method has been quite different. Each half of the locket was a single
  casting, which included half a hinge and one suspension ring. Probably both
  halves were cast from a single half-model and the superfluous part of the
  hinge filed off. Then each half was worked on the stake and pitch-block to
  harden the metal and the final finishing and fitting done with the file and
  stone. The engraving must have been done after everything but the hinge was
  finished.'</p>

  <p>'It must have been very awkward to engrave that small writing inside, with
  the edges projecting,' said Miss Blake.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke opened the locket, and taking his Coddington lens from his
  pocket, examined the writing closely. 'If you look at it through the lens,'
  said he, 'you will see that it is not engraved. It is etched, which would
  have disposed of the difficulty to a great extent.'</p>

  <p>Miss Blake and I examined the minute writing, and through the lens it was
  easy to see that the delicate lines were bitten, not engraved.</p>

  <p>'You were saying,' said Miss Blake, as the locket and lens were passed to
  Percy (who, having examined the inscription, extended his investigations to
  his fingertips and various other objects before reluctantly surrendering the
  lens) 'that the riddle of the construction is not a difficult one. What is
  the answer to it?'</p>

  <p>'I think,' he replied, 'the inscription inside supplies the answer. That
  inscription was clearly put there for some purpose to which the original
  owner attached some importance. It apparently conveyed some kind of
  admonition or instruction which was hardly likely to be addressed to himself.
  But if the message was of importance it was worth while to take measures to
  ensure its permanence. And that is what has been done. There are no loose or
  separable parts, no soldered joints to break away. Each half of the locket is
  a single piece of solid metal, including the hinge and suspension ring. And
  you notice that the hinge is unusually massive, and that each half of the
  locket has its own suspension ring, so that if the hinge should break, both
  halves would still be securely suspended. And there was no loose ring to
  chafe through and break.'</p>

  <p>'Don't you think,' she asked, 'that there was originally a loose ring
  passing through both of the eyes?'</p>

  <p>'No,' he answered. 'If you look carefully at the two eyes you will see
  that the holes through them have been most carefully smoothed and rounded.
  Evidently the locket was meant to be suspended by a cord or thong, and the
  position of the eyes with a hole through from back to front shows that the
  cord was intended to be tied in a single knot where it passed through&mdash;a
  much more secure arrangement than a chain, any one link of which may,
  unnoticed, wear thin and break at any unusual strain.'</p>

  <p>'And you think that the message or whatever it was that the inscription
  conveyed was really something of importance?' As she asked the question, Miss
  Blake looked at Thorndyke with a suppressed eagerness at which I inwardly
  smiled. The Lady of Shallot evidently had hopes of Merlin.</p>

  <p>'That is what the precautions suggest,' was his reply. 'It appeared
  important to the person who took the precautions.'</p>

  <p>'And do you suppose that it would be possible to guess what the nature of
  the message was?'</p>

  <p>'One could judge better,' he replied 'if one knew what passages the reader
  is referred to.'</p>

  <p>'I can show you the passages,' she said. 'I have looked them up, and Mr
  Anstey and I went over them together and could make nothing of them.'</p>

  <p>'That doesn't sound very encouraging,' said Thorndyke as she ran to the
  cabinet and brought out her book of notes. 'However, we shall see if a
  further opinion is of any help.' He took the note-book from her and read
  through the entries slowly and with close attention. Then he handed the book
  back to her.</p>

  <p>'One thing is fairly evident,' said he. 'The purpose of the writer was not
  pious instruction. Whatever was intended to be conveyed did not lie on the
  surface, for the individual passages are singularly barren of meaning, while
  the collection as a whole is a mere jumble of quotations without any apparent
  sequence or connection. The passages must have had some meaning previously
  agreed on, or, more probably, they formed the key of a code or cipher used
  for secret correspondence.'</p>

  <p>'If they form the key of a cipher,' said Miss Blake, 'do you think it
  would be possible to work out the cipher by studying them?'</p>

  <p>'I suppose it would be possible,' he replied, 'since a cipher must work by
  some sort of rule. But people who make ciphers do not take great pains to
  make them easily decipherable to the uninitiated. And then we are only
  guessing that they are the key to a cipher. They may be something quite
  different; some form of cryptogram that would be utterly unintelligible
  without some key or counterpart that we haven't got. Do you think of trying
  to decipher them or extract the hidden meaning?'</p>

  <p>'I am rather curious about them,' she admitted, 'and rather interested in
  ciphers and cryptograms.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' said Thorndyke, 'you may succeed. More probably you will draw a
  blank&mdash;but in any case I think you will get a run for your money.'</p>

  <p>Once more with his lens he examined the locket inside and out, not
  omitting the hallmark on the back, on which he dwelt for some time. Then,
  still holding the locket in his hand, he said: 'You ought to have this
  cover-glass replaced. The hair is part of the relic and ought not to be
  exposed to loss or injury.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said she, 'I ought to get it done, but I don't much like trusting
  it to an unknown jeweller.'</p>

  <p>'Would you like Polton to do it for you?' Thorndyke asked. 'He is not a
  stranger, and you know he is a first-class workman.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, if Mr Polton would do it I should be delighted and most grateful. Do
  you think he would?'</p>

  <p>'I think he would be highly flattered at being asked,' said Thorndyke. 'I
  will take it back with me if you like, and get him to put in the fresh glass
  at once.'</p>

  <p>Miss Blake accepted this offer joyfully, and taking the locket from
  Thorndyke, she proceeded, with great care and a quantity of tissue paper, to
  make it into a little packet. While she was thus engaged, the bell in the
  yard rang loudly and Percy ran out to open the gate. In less than a minute he
  re-entered the studio carrying a brown-paper parcel.</p>

  <p>'Miss Winifred Blake,' he announced. 'Shall I see what's in it,
  Winnie?'</p>

  <p>'I suppose you won't be happy till you do,' she replied, whereupon he
  gleefully cut the string and removed the paper, exposing a cardboard box, of
  which he lifted the lid.</p>

  <p>'My eye, Winnie!' he exclaimed. 'It's tuck. I wonder who it's from. And
  it's for us both. "To Winifred and Percival Blake, with love." Whose love, I
  wonder. Can you spot the handwriting?' He passed a slip of paper to his
  sister and exhibited a shallow box filled with large chocolate sweets on
  which he gazed gloatingly.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke, who had just received the little packet from Miss Blake and was
  putting it into his pocket, watched the boy attentively, interested, as I
  supposed, by the sudden descent from the heights of architectural design to
  frank, boyish gluttony.</p>

  <p>'I don't recognise the writing at all,' said Miss Blake, 'and I can't
  imagine who can have sent this.'</p>

  <p>'Well, it doesn't matter,' said Percy. 'Let's sample them.' He passed the
  box to his sister&mdash;still closely watched by Thorndyke, I
  noticed&mdash;and as she put out her hand to pick up one of the sweets, my
  colleague asked in a significant tone: 'Are you sure that you don't know the
  handwriting?'</p>

  <p>The tone in which the question was asked was so emphatic that she looked
  at him in surprise. 'No,' she answered, 'the writing is quite strange to
  me.'</p>

  <p>'Then,' said he, 'the writer is possibly a stranger.'</p>

  <p>She looked at him with a puzzled expression, and I noticed that he was
  gazing at her with a strange fixity. After a pause he continued:</p>

  <p>'We were speaking just now of unusual circumstances. Would not a gift of
  food from a stranger be an unusual circumstance?'</p>

  <p>In an instant his meaning flashed upon me, and upon her too, for she took
  the box quickly from her brother and her face became deathly pale.</p>

  <p>'I think, Percy dear,' she said, 'if you don't mind very much, we won't
  touch these tonight. Do you mind?'</p>

  <p>'Of course I don't,' he replied, 'if you would rather keep 'em till
  tomorrow.'</p>

  <p>Nevertheless the boy looked curiously at his sister, and it was clear to
  me that he saw that there was 'something in the wind'. But he asked no
  questions and made no comment, sauntering back to his tower and looking it
  over critically.</p>

  <p>'It's really time you went to bed, Percy,' Miss Blake said after a
  pause.</p>

  <p>'Is it?' he asked. 'What's the time?'</p>

  <p>'It is getting on for ten, and you have to be up at half-past six.'</p>

  <p>'It's always "getting on" for ten, you know,' said he. 'The question is,
  how far has it got? But there! It's no good arguing. I suppose I shall get
  chucked out if I don't go peaceably.' He offered a friendly hand to me and
  Thorndyke in succession, and having given his sister a hug and a kiss, took
  his departure. And again I thought I detected in his manner a perception of
  something below the surface that accounted for his sudden dismissal.</p>

  <p>'I suspect Master Percy smells a fox,' said I, 'but is too polite to
  mention it.'</p>

  <p>'It is very likely,' said Miss Blake. 'He is wonderfully quick and
  observant, and he is extraordinarily discreet. In most respects he is quite a
  normal boy, but in others he is more like a man.'</p>

  <p>'And a very well-bred man, too,' said I.</p>

  <p>'Yes, he is nice boy and the best of brothers. But now, Dr Thorndyke,
  about these sweets. Do you really think there is anything wrong with
  them?'</p>

  <p>'I don't say that,' replied Thorndyke, 'but, of course, when you have
  swallowed one, it is too late to inquire. May I look at that paper?'</p>

  <p>Miss Blake took the slip of paper from the box and handed it to him, and
  once more the lens came into requisition.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' he said, after somewhat prolonged examination of the writing, 'this
  is not reassuring. It is quite clear that this writing was traced over a
  previous writing in lead pencil. A hard rubber has been used to take out the
  pencil marks, but the ink has fixed them in several places. If you look at
  the writing carefully through the lens you can see the fine, dark pencil line
  forming a sort of core to the broader ink line. And you can also distinguish
  several minute crumbs of blackened rubber&mdash;little black rolls with
  pointed ends.'</p>

  <p>'But why should it have been written first in pencil?' Miss Blake
  asked.</p>

  <p>'For the purpose of disguising the handwriting,' replied Thorndyke. 'It is
  a common practice. Of course, in the case of a forger copying a signature,
  its purpose is obvious. He takes a pencil tracing of the original signature,
  goes over it in ink and rubs out the pencil&mdash;if he can. But it is used
  in producing feigned handwriting as well. It is difficult to write direct
  with a pen in a hand which is quite different from one's own. But if a
  preliminary trial sketch is done in pencil, and touched up if necessary, and
  then traced over deliberately with the pen, the result may be quite unlike
  one's own handwriting. But, in any case, this underlying pencil writing is
  manifestly abnormal and therefore suspicious. Shall we see if there is
  anything unusual in the appearance of the sweets?'</p>

  <p>She passed him the box, which he placed on the table under the gaslight
  and looked over systematically. Then he turned the sweets, one after the
  other, on their sides, and when they were all in this position, he again
  looked them over.</p>

  <p>'It seems hardly possible,' said I, 'that the woman&mdash;if it is she
  whom you suspect&mdash;could have prepared a set of poisoned sweets in such a
  short time. It was past four o'clock when she came and looked at the plate,
  and it is not ten yet. There doesn't seem to have been time.'</p>

  <p>'There has been about five hours,' said Thorndyke, 'and I see by the
  postmark on the wrapper that the parcel was posted in this neighbourhood
  barely two hours ago. That leaves three hours, which would have been
  sufficient. But she might have had the things prepared in advance, and merely
  waited for the inquest to get the name and particulars. And the sender may
  not be this woman at all. And again, there may be no poison in the sweets. We
  are only taking precautions against a possibility. But looking at these
  things all together, there seems to me to be a suggestion of their having
  been patched with liquid chocolate round the sides. If that is so, they will
  have been cut open horizontally and the halves fitted together again, and the
  purpose of the patching will have been to hide the join. Here is a very
  well-marked specimen. I think we will take it as a test case.'</p>

  <p>He picked out the sweet, and with his pocket-knife, began very delicately
  to scrape away the outer coat of chocolate all round the sides, while we drew
  up our chairs and watched him anxiously. Presently he paused and silently
  held the sweet towards us, indicating a spot with the point of his knife; and
  looking at that spot where the outer coating had been scraped away, I could
  clearly make out an indented line. He then resumed his scraping, following
  the line, until he had worked round the whole circumference. And now it was
  quite obvious that the sweet had been divided into an upper and a lower half
  and the two parts rejoined.</p>

  <p>'I am afraid it is a true bill, Thorndyke,' said I.</p>

  <p>'I think so,' he agreed, 'but we shall soon see.' He inserted his knife
  into the encircling crevice, and giving it a gentle turn, raised the top
  half, which he then lifted off. At once I could see that the exposed surfaces
  of the white interior of the sweet were coated with a glistening white
  powder, worked into the soft material of the filling. Thorndyke produced his
  lens, and through it examined the cut surface for a few moments. Then he
  passed the half sweet and the lens to me.</p>

  <p>'What do you suppose this stuff is, Thorndyke?' I asked, when I had
  inspected the sweet, and then passed it and the lens to Miss Blake. 'It looks
  like finely powdered china or white enamel.'</p>

  <p>'It looks like&mdash;and I have no doubt is&mdash;arsenious acid, or white
  arsenic, as it is commonly called; and I should say there is rather more than
  two grains in this sweet. It is a heavy substance.'</p>

  <p>'Is that a fatal dose?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'Yes. And it is extremely unlikely that only one sweet would have been
  eaten. Two or three would contain a dose that would produce death very
  rapidly.'</p>

  <p>We were silent for a few moments. Suddenly Miss Blake burst into tears and
  buried her face in her hands, sobbing almost hysterically. Thorndyke looked
  at her with a curious expression, stern and even wrathful, and yet with a
  certain softness of compassion, but he said nothing. As to me, I was filled
  with fury against the wretch who had done this unspeakable thing, but, like
  Thorndyke, I could find no words that were adequate.</p>

  <p>Presently Miss Blake recovered her self-possession somewhat, and as she
  wiped her eyes, she apologised for her outburst.</p>

  <p>'Pray forgive me!' she exclaimed. 'But it is horrible&mdash;horrible! Just
  think! But for the infinitely unlikely chance of your coming in tonight Percy
  would have eaten at least two or three of those sweets. By now he would have
  been dead, or dying in agony, and I unable to help him! It is a frightful
  thought. Nobody would have known anything until Mrs Wingrave came in the
  morning and found our bodies! And the wretch may try again.'</p>

  <p>'That won't matter much,' said Thorndyke. 'You are now on your guard. It
  will be best to think as little of this episode as you can. It has been a
  narrow escape, but it is past. You must fix your attention on the
  future.'</p>

  <p>'But what can we do?' she asked despairingly.</p>

  <p>'You must walk warily and never for one moment forget this implacable,
  ruthless enemy. No opportunity must be given. Do not go out after dark
  without efficient protection, and avoid going abroad alone at any time. You
  had better not to go to the gate after nightfall, neither you nor Percy. Can
  you not arrange for some one to answer the bell for you?'</p>

  <p>'I could ask Mrs Wingrave, the sculptor's wife. Their rooms open on the
  yard. But what could I tell her?'</p>

  <p>'You will have to tell her as much as is necessary. And, of course, Percy
  must be told. It is very unfortunate, but we can take no risks. You must
  impress upon him that under no circumstances whatever must he eat or drink
  anything that is given or sent to him by strangers or of which he does not
  know the antecedents. Does he go to school?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. He goes to the Elizabeth Woodville Grammar School, near Regents
  Park. He usually gets home about five o'clock. Sometimes I go and meet him,
  but he has some school-fellows who live near here and who generally walk home
  with him.'</p>

  <p>'Then let him come home with them. There is no reason to suppose that he
  is in any danger apart from you. And let me impress upon you again that Mr
  Anstey and I are always at your service. While this danger lasts&mdash;I hope
  it will soon pass&mdash;don't scruple to make any use of us that
  circumstances may require. If you have to go anywhere at night, we can always
  arrange for you to have an escort. At a pinch, we could secure the help of
  the police, but we don't want to do that unless we are compelled.
  And&mdash;it seems contradictory advice to give you&mdash;but having taken
  all precautions, try not to think about this incident of tonight, or to dwell
  on the danger more than is necessary to keep your attention on the alert. And
  now we must wish you good night, Miss Blake. I will take these sweets with me
  for more complete examination.'</p>

  <p>'I can never thank you enough for all your kindness,' she said, as he
  wrapped the box in its original paper, 'and I shall have no hesitation in
  treating you as the good and generous friends that you have proved tonight. I
  feel that Percy and I are in your hands, and we shouldn't wish to be in
  better.' She walked out with us to the gate, and at the wicket shook our
  hands warmly, and indeed with no little emotion. And when we had seen the
  wicket safely closed on her, and taken a look up and down the street, we
  turned westward and started on our way home.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; THE BLUE HAIR</h2>

  <p class="first">'What are you going to do, Anstey?' Thorndyke asked as we
  reached the corner of Jacob Street. 'Are you going to Hampstead or are you
  coming home with me?'</p>

  <p>'What are you going to do tonight?' I asked in return.</p>

  <p>'I shall make a rough qualitative test of the substance in that sweet,' he
  replied, 'just to settle definitely whether it is or is not arsenic.'</p>

  <p>'Have you any doubt on the subject?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'No,' he answered. 'But still it is not a matter of fact until it has been
  verified by analysis. My own conviction on the subject is only a state of
  mind, which is not transferable as evidence. A chemical demonstration is a
  fact which can be deposed to in sworn testimony.'</p>

  <p>'Then,' said I, 'I shall come home with you and hear the result of your
  analysis, although your certainty would be good enough for me.'</p>

  <p>We walked down to the bottom of Hampstead Road where we boarded an omnibus
  bound for Charing Cross. For some time nothing more was said, each of us
  being immersed in reflection on the events of the evening.</p>

  <p>'It is a horrible affair,' I said at length, assuming that we were still
  thinking on the same subject, 'and a terrible thing to reflect that the world
  we live in should contain such wretches.'</p>

  <p>'It is,' he agreed. 'But the mitigating circumstance is that these
  wretches are nearly always fools. That is the reassuring element in the
  present case.'</p>

  <p>'In what way reassuring?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'I mean,' said he, 'the palpable folly of the whole proceeding. We have
  here no subtle, wary criminal who works with considered strategy under secure
  cover, but just the common arsenic fool who delivers himself into your hands
  by his own stupidity.'</p>

  <p>'But what is the evidence of the stupidity?'</p>

  <p>'My dear Anstey!' he exclaimed. 'Look at the crudity of method. The
  discharge, broadcast, of a boxful of poisoned food under manifestly
  suspicious circumstances, with the poison barely concealed; the faked
  writing, which a common policeman would have detected, the absence of any
  plausible origin of the gift, and the nature of the poison itself. That alone
  is diagnostic. Arsenic is typically a fool's poison. No competent poisoner
  would dream of using such a material.'</p>

  <p>Why not?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'Because its properties are exactly the reverse of those which would make
  a poison safe to use. The fatal dose is relatively large&mdash;not less than
  two grains and for security, considerably more. The effects are extremely
  variable and uncertain, making necessary the use of really large doses. The
  material is rather conspicuous, it is only slightly soluble in water and
  still less so in tea or coffee; it is easily recognised by simple chemical
  tests, even in the minutest quantities. It is practically indestructible, and
  its strong preservative effects on the dead body make it easy to demonstrate
  its presence years after death. A man who poisons a person with arsenic
  creates a record of the fact which will last, at least, for the term of his
  own lifetime.'</p>

  <p>'That isn't much benefit to the person who has been poisoned,' I
  remarked.</p>

  <p>'No,' he admitted. 'But we are considering the poisoner's point of view.
  It is not enough for him to succeed in killing his victim. He has to avoid
  killing himself at the same time. A poisoner sets out to commit a secret
  murder, and the secrecy is the test of his efficiency. If his methods are
  easily detectable, and if he leaves a record which stands against him in
  perpetuity, he is an inefficient poisoner. And that is the case of the
  arsenic practitioner. He runs a great present risk, since the symptoms of
  arsenic poisoning are conspicuous and fairly characteristic; and he leaves
  traces of his crime which nothing but cremation will destroy.'</p>

  <p>Our discussion had brought us to our chambers, where Thorndyke proceeded
  straight up to the laboratory, breaking in upon Polton, who was seated at his
  bench, putting the finishing touches to the large and elaborate
  pedometer.</p>

  <p>'We need not disturb you, Polton,' said Thorndyke. 'I am just going to
  make a rough qualitative test for arsenic.'</p>

  <p>Polton instantly laid down his watchmaker's glass and unlocked a cupboard
  on the chemical side of the laboratory. 'You will want a Marsh's apparatus
  and the materials for Reinsch's test, I suppose, sir?' said he.</p>

  <p>'Yes. But we will begin with the liquid tests. I shall want a glass mortar
  and some hydrochloric acid.'</p>

  <p>Polton put the necessary appliances on the bench and added a large bottle
  labelled 'Distilled Water,' while I seated myself on a stool and watched the
  analysis with a slightly vague though highly interested recognition of the
  processes that I had so often expounded to juries. I saw Thorndyke open the
  box, take from it the two halves of the divided sweet, and drop them into the
  little glass mortar, and having poured on them some distilled water and a
  little acid, rub them with the glass pestle until they were reduced to a
  muddy-looking liquid. This liquid he carefully filtered into a beaker, when
  it became clear and practically colourless, like water, and this
  watery-looking fluid formed the material for the succeeding tests.</p>

  <p>Of these the first three were performed in test-tubes into each of which a
  small quantity of the clear solution was poured, and then to each was added a
  few drops of certain other clear liquids. The result was very striking. In
  two of the tubes the clear liquid instantly turned to a dense, opaque yellow,
  somewhat like yolk of egg, while in the third it changed to a bright, opaque
  emerald green.</p>

  <p>'What are those precipitates?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'The two yellow ones,' he replied, 'are arsenite of silver and arsenic
  sulphide. The green one is arsenite of copper. As there is sugar and some
  other organic matter in this solution, I shall not carry these tests any
  farther, but they are pretty conclusive. How are you getting on, Polton?'</p>

  <p>'I think we are ready, sir,' was the reply; on which I crossed to the
  bench on which he had been at work. Here on a tripod over a Bunsen
  gas-burner, was a beaker containing a number of little pieces of copper foil
  and a clear, watery liquid which was boiling briskly.</p>

  <p>'This is Reinsch's test,' Thorndyke explained. 'You see that this
  copper-foil remains bright in the dilute acid, showing that both the metal
  and the acid are free from arsenic. I shall now introduce a few drops of the
  suspected liquid, and if it contains arsenic the copper-foil will become grey
  or black according to the amount of arsenic present.' As he spoke, he took
  the beaker containing the filtered liquid from the mortar and poured about a
  tablespoonful into that containing the copper-foil. I watched eagerly for the
  result, and very soon a change began to appear. The ruddy lustre of the
  copper gradually turned to a steely grey and from that to a glistening
  black.</p>

  <p>'You see,' said Thorndyke, 'that the reaction is very distinct. The
  quantity of arsenic present is, in an analytical sense, quite large. And now
  we will try the most definite and conclusive test of all&mdash;Marsh's.' He
  turned to the other apparatus which Polton had made ready, which consisted of
  a squat bottle with two short necks, through one of which passed a tall glass
  funnel, and through the other a glass tube fitted with a tap and terminating
  in a fine jet. The contents of the bottle&mdash;lumps of zinc immersed in
  sulphuric acid&mdash;were effervescing briskly, and the tap was turned on to
  allow the gas to escape through the jet. To the latter Polton now applied a
  lighted match, and immediately there appeared a little pale violet flame.
  Picking up a white tile which had been placed in readiness, Thorndyke held it
  for a moment in the flame and then looked at it.</p>

  <p>'You see,' said he, 'that the tile is quite unsoiled. If there had been
  the smallest trace of arsenic in the bottle, a dark spot would have appeared
  on the tile. So we may take it that our chemicals are free from arsenic. Now
  let us try the solution of the sweet.'</p>

  <p>He took up the beaker containing the solution of the disintegrated
  chocolate, and poured very slowly, drop by drop, about a teaspoonful into the
  funnel of the bottle. Then, after having given it time to mix thoroughly with
  the other contents, he once more picked up the tile and held it for an
  instant in the flame. The result was, to me, most striking. In the very
  moment when the tile touched the flame, there appeared on the white surface a
  circular spot, black, lustrous, and metallic.</p>

  <p>'That,' said Thorndyke, 'might be either antimony or arsenic. By its
  appearance it is obviously metallic arsenic, but still we will make the
  differential test. If it is arsenic it will dissolve in a solution of
  chlorinated lime; if it is antimony it will not.' He removed the stopper from
  a bottle labelled 'Chlorinated Lime,' and poured a little pool of the
  solution on the tile. Almost immediately the black spot began to fade at the
  edges, and to grow smaller and fainter until at length it disappeared
  altogether.</p>

  <p>'That completes our inquiry,' said Thorndyke as he laid down the tile.
  'For the purposes of evidence in a court of law, a more searching and
  detailed analysis would be necessary. To produce conviction in the minds of a
  jury we should have to be able to say exactly how much arsenic was in each of
  the sweets. That, however, is no concern of ours. The criminal intention is
  all that matters to us. And now, Anstey, I must leave you for a while to
  entertain yourself with a book. I have to do some work in the office on
  another case. But we will take this ill-omened box down and put it in a safe
  place.'</p>

  <p>He took the box of sweets, with its original wrapper, and when we
  descended to the sitting-room, he closed it up, sealed it, and signed and
  dated it; and having made a note of the particulars of the postmark,
  deposited it in the safe. Then he retired to the office, where I assumed that
  he had in hand some work of compilation or reference, for the 'office' was in
  fact rather a miniature law library, in which was stored a singularly
  complete collection of works bearing upon our special branch of legal
  practice.</p>

  <p>When he had gone, I ran my eye vaguely along the book-shelves in search of
  a likely volume with which to pass the time. But the box of poisoned sweets
  haunted me and refused to be ejected from my thoughts. Eventually I brought
  out Miss Blake's manuscript from the drawer in which I had put it when Miller
  had arrived, and drawing an easy-chair up to the fire, sat listlessly
  glancing over the well-remembered pages, but actually thinking of the writer;
  of the brave, sweet-faced girl and the fine, manly boy to whom she was at
  once sister and mother. What, I wondered uncomfortably, was to be the end of
  this? Only by the merest hairbreadth had she and the boy, this very night,
  escaped a dreadful death. Soon the wretches who had contrived this diabolical
  crime would discover that their plot had miscarried in some way. What would
  they do next? It was hardly likely that they would try poison again, but
  there are plenty of other ways of committing murder. It was all very well to
  say that they were fools. So they might be. But they were unknown fools. That
  was the trouble. They could make their preparations unwatched, and approach
  unsuspected within striking distance. If your enemy is unknown it is almost
  impossible to be on your guard against him. In one direction only safety
  lay&mdash;in detection. In the moment when the identity of the criminals
  should become known, the danger would be at an end.</p>

  <p>But when would that moment arrive? So far as the position was known to me,
  it was not even in sight. The police admitted that their clue had broken off
  short and apparently they had no other; at least that was Thorndyke's
  opinion. But what of Thorndyke himself? Had he any clue? My feeling was that
  he had not. It seemed impossible that he could have, for these two men had,
  as it were, dropped down out of the sky and then vanished into space. No one
  knew who they were, whence they had come, or whither they had gone. And they
  seemed to have left not a trace for the imagination to work on.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Thorndyke was Thorndyke; an inscrutable man; silent,
  self-contained, and even secretive, in spite of his genial exterior. I
  thought of him, at this very moment, sitting calmly in the office with all
  his faculties quietly transferred to a fresh case, unmoved by the thrilling
  events of the evening, though it was he who had instantly seen the danger, he
  who had immediately suspected the 'Greek Gift.' And as I thought of him
  poring over his reports, and marvelled at his detachment, I recalled the many
  instances of his wonderful power of inference from almost invisible data, and
  found myself hoping that even now, when to me all seemed dark, some glimmer
  of light was visible to him.</p>

  <p>It had turned half-past eleven when I heard a light but deliberate step
  ascending the stair. Instantly I stole on tiptoe to the office, and had just
  opened the door when a tapping-apparently with the handle of a stick or
  umbrella&mdash;on our 'oak' announced the arrival of a visitor.</p>

  <p>'Shall I open the door, Thorndyke?' I whispered.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' he answered. 'It is Brodribb. I know his knock. Tell him I shall
  have finished in a few minutes. And you might run up and tell Polton that he
  is here. He will know what to do.'</p>

  <p>I accordingly went out and threw open the 'oak,' and there, sure enough,
  was Mr Brodribb, looking with his fine, rich complexion, his silky white
  hair, and his sumptuous, old-fashioned raiment, as if he had stepped out of
  the frame of some Georgian portrait.</p>

  <p>'Good evening, Anstey,' said he, 'might even say "good night." It's a
  devil of a time to come stirring you up, but I saw a light in your windows,
  and I rather particularly wanted to have a word or two with Thorndyke. Is he
  in?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. He is in the office surrounded by a sort of landslide of
  reports&mdash;assizes, Central Criminal, and various assorted. He will have
  finished in a few minutes. Meanwhile I will run up and let Polton know you
  are here.'</p>

  <p>At the mention of Polton's name methought his bright blue eye grew
  brighter, and by the way in which he murmured 'Ha!' and smiled as he subsided
  into an armchair, I judged that&mdash;as our American cousins would
  say&mdash;he 'had been there before;' and this impression was confirmed when
  I made my announcement in the laboratory, where I found Polton dancing his
  pedometer up and down and listening ecstatically to its measured tick.</p>

  <p>'Mr Brodribb,' said he. 'Let me see, it is the sixty-three that he likes.
  Yes; and Lord, he does like it! It's a pleasure to see him drink it!'</p>

  <p>'Well, Polton,' said I, 'it is an altruistic pleasure, and if it would add
  to your enjoyment to see me drink some, too, I am prepared to make an
  effort.'</p>

  <p>'You couldn't do it as Mr Brodribb does,' said Polton, 'and you haven't
  got the complexion. Still&mdash;I'll bring it down in a minute or two, when
  I've got it filtered into the decanter.'</p>

  <p>On this I descended and rejoined Mr Brodribb, and having offered him a
  cigar, which he declined&mdash;no doubt with a view to preserving his
  gustatory sense unimpaired&mdash;sat down and filled my pipe.</p>

  <p>'I looked in,' said Mr Brodribb, 'on my way home to ask Thorndyke a
  question. I met Drayton today&mdash;only saw him for a few moments&mdash;and
  he said something about wanting some information respecting Arthur Blake of
  Beauchamp Blake. I understood him to say that the matter arose out of the
  inquest on his brother; can't see how the devil it could, but that is what I
  gathered. Now, before I tell him anything, I should like to know what's in
  the wind. What's he after? Do you happen to know?'</p>

  <p>'I think I do, to some extent,' said I, and I gave him a brief account of
  the circumstances and a summary of Miss Blake's evidence.</p>

  <p>'I see,' said he. 'Then this young lady will be Peter Blake's daughter.
  But what does Drayton want to know? And why does he want to know it? He said
  something about Thorndyke, too. Now, where does Thorndyke come in?'</p>

  <p>As if in answer to the question, my colleague emerged at this moment from
  the office, slipping a large note-book into his pocket. As he greeted our
  visitor, I found myself speculating on the contents of that note-book and
  wondering what kind of information he had been disinterring from those piles
  of arid-looking reports of assizes, quarter-sessions, and the Central
  Criminal Court. The greetings were hardly finished when Polton entered with a
  tray on which were a decanter, three glasses, and a biscuit jar; and having
  placed a small table adjacent to Mr Brodribb's chair, deposited the tray
  thereon with a crinkly smile of satisfaction, and departed after an
  instantaneous glance of profound significance in my direction.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke filled the three glasses, and drawing a chair nearer to the
  fire, sat down and began to fill his pipe; while Brodribb lifted his glass,
  looked at it reflectively, took an experimental sip, savoured it with grave
  attention, and again looked at the glass.</p>

  <p>'A noble wine, Thorndyke,' he pronounced solemnly. 'I don't deserve this
  after coming and routing you out at close upon midnight. But I haven't come
  for mere gossip. I've just been putting my case to Anstey,' and here he
  repeated what he had told me of his interview with Sir Lawrence. 'Now, what I
  want to know,' he concluded, 'is, what is Drayton after? He seems disposed to
  interest himself in Peter Blake's daughter&mdash;and his son, too, I
  suppose.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Thorndyke, 'and for that matter, I may say that I feel a
  benevolent interest in the young people myself, and so, I think, does
  Anstey.'</p>

  <p>'Then,' said Brodribb, 'I'm going to ask you a plain question. Is there
  any idea of contesting the title of the present tenant of the Blake
  property&mdash;Arthur Blake?'</p>

  <p>'I should say certainly not,' replied Thorndyke. 'Drayton's object is, I
  think, to ascertain whether there is any prospect of circumstances becoming
  favourable in the future for the revival of Peter Blake's claim&mdash;or
  rather Percival Blake's, as it would now be. He wants to know who the present
  heir is, what is his relation to the present tenant, and he would like to
  know as much as possible about Arthur Blake himself, particularly in regard
  to the probability of his marrying. And, as I said, Anstey and I are not
  uninterested in the matter.'</p>

  <p>'Well, if that is all,' said Brodribb, 'I can answer you without any
  breach of confidence to my client. As to the heir, his name is Charles
  Templeton, but what his relationship to Arthur Blake is, I can't say at the
  moment. He is a pretty distant relative, I know. With regard to Arthur Blake,
  I can tell you all about him, for I have made some inquiries on my own
  account. And I can tell you something that will interest you more than the
  probability of his marrying&mdash;he is trying to sell the property.'</p>

  <p>'The deuce he is!' exclaimed Thorndyke. 'I suppose I mustn't ask why he
  wants to sell?'</p>

  <p>'I don't know that there is any secret about it. His own explanation is
  that he doesn't care for England and would like to get back to Australia,
  where he has lived nearly all his life; and I daresay there is some truth in
  that, for he is like a fish out of water&mdash;doesn't understand the ways of
  an English landowner at all. But I don't think that's the whole of it. He
  knows about this claim of Peter Blake's, and he knows that Peter Blake's son
  is living; and then&mdash;you know about the title-deeds, I suppose?'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Thorndyke. 'Miss Blake has told us the whole story.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I suspect that, with this claim in the air and the mystery of the
  whereabouts of the title-deeds, he feels that his tenure of the property is a
  little insecure. So he would like to sell it and clear off with the money.
  And, mind you, he is not entirely wrong. Peter Blake's claim was a bona fide
  claim. It broke down from the lack of documentary evidence. But it is always
  possible for documents to reappear, and if these documents ever should, the
  position would be very different. And, to tell the honest truth, I shouldn't
  be particularly afflicted if they did reappear.'</p>

  <p>'Why wouldn't you?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'Well,' Brodribb replied, 'you know, one gets a sort of sentimental
  interest in a historic estate which one has known all one's life. I am Arthur
  Blake's solicitor, it is true. But I feel that I have responsibilities
  towards the whole family and the estate itself. I have much more sentiment
  about the old house and its lands than Blake himself has. I hate the idea of
  selling an old place like that, which has been in one family since the time
  of Henry the Eighth, as if it were a mere speculative builder's estate.
  Besides, it isn't playing the game. An inherited estate belongs to the
  family, and a man who has received it from his ancestors has no right to
  dispossess his posterity. I told him so, and he didn't like it a bit.'</p>

  <p>'What sort of man is he?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'He's a colonial, and not a good type of colonial. Gruff and short and
  none too well-mannered, and, of course, he doesn't know anybody in the
  county. And I should think he is a confirmed bachelor, for he
  lives&mdash;when he is at home&mdash;in the new part of the house, with three
  servants and his man, as if he were in a bachelor flat.'</p>

  <p>'How did you manage to dig him up?' Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>'I began to make inquiries as soon as it was certain that he would be
  Arnold Blake's successor. That was years ago. I ascertained his whereabouts
  and got into touch with him pretty easily, but I really never knew much about
  him until a few weeks back, when I came across a man who had just retired
  from the Australian Police. He knew all about Blake, so I took the
  opportunity to get a pretty full history of him and make out a little dossier
  to keep by me. You never know when a trifle of information may come in
  useful.'</p>

  <p>'No,' Thorndyke agreed as he refilled our visitor's glass. 'Knowledge is
  power.'</p>

  <p>'Quite so,' said Brodribb, 'and it is well to know whom you are dealing
  with. But, in fact, this fellow Blake is quite an interesting character.'</p>

  <p>'So the police seem to have thought,' I remarked.</p>

  <p>'Oh, I don't think there was anything against Blake,' said he, 'excepting
  that he kept rather queer company at times. My friend first heard of him at a
  mining camp, where the society was not exactly select, and where he ran a
  saloon or liquor bar. But he gave that up and took to digging, and he seems
  to have had quite good luck for a time. Then his claim petered out and he
  moved off to a new district and started a sawmill with some of his mining
  pals. There, I think, some of his partners had trouble with the
  police&mdash;I don't know exactly what it was, but he moved off again and
  rambled about doing all sorts of odd jobs&mdash;boat-building, farming,
  working as deck hand on a coaster, carpentering&mdash;he seems to have been
  able to turn his hand to anything&mdash;and finally he came across his last
  partner, a man named Owen, a fellow of his own type, who seemed to be able to
  do anything but stick to one kind of job. Owen was a colonial&mdash;he was
  born at Hobart&mdash;and by trade he was a photo-engraver, but he had worked
  a small type-foundry, run a local newspaper, and done some other jobs that
  weren't quite so respectable. Blake ran across him at a new town in a mining
  district, and the circumstances were characteristic of the two men. Owen had
  started a pottery, but he had just met with an accident and broken his
  knee-cap. Thereupon Blake took him in hand and fixed his knee-cap up in
  splints, and as it happened to be the left knee, so that Owen would not be
  able to work the potter's wheel for a long time, Blake took over the job,
  worked the wheel, and turned out the pots and pans, while a woman who was
  associated with Owen&mdash;I don't know what their relations
  were&mdash;helped with the kiln and sold the stuff in the town.'</p>

  <p>'Why can't you work a potter's wheel with your right foot?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'I don't know,' replied Brodribb, 'but I understand that you can't.'</p>

  <p>'In an ordinary "kick-wheel,"' said Thorndyke, 'the "kick-bar," or
  treadle, is on the left side, and has to be if the potter is right-handed, to
  enable him to steady himself with the right foot.'</p>

  <p>'I see,' said I. 'And how long did the pottery last?'</p>

  <p>'Not long,' replied Brodribb. 'When Owen got about again, as he couldn't
  work the wheel, it seems that he got restless and began to hanker for
  something fresh. Then Blake got a tip from some prospector about some traces
  of gold in the hills in an outlying district, so they sold the pottery and
  the three of them went off prospecting; and I think they were engaged in some
  tentative digging when Blake got my letter telling him that Arnold Blake was
  dead and that he had come into the property. A deuce of a time he was, too,
  in getting that letter, for, of course, there was no post out there and they
  only rode into the town at long intervals.'</p>

  <p>'And now,' said Thorndyke, 'he wants to sell the property and get back to
  his cronies. I should think they would be very glad to see him.'</p>

  <p>'I don't know that he wants to join his pals again,' said Brodribb. 'As a
  man of property, I should think he would keep clear of people of that sort.
  But in any case, he couldn't. Owen is dead. He must have died soon after
  Blake left; must have met with an accident when he was alone, for his body
  was found only a few months ago at the foot of a cliff-just a heap of more or
  less damaged bones that must have been lying there for several years. The
  skeleton was found by the merest chance by another prospector.'</p>

  <p>'How did he know it was Owen's body?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'Well, he knew that Owen had been there and had not been seen for a long
  time, and he found a signet-ring&mdash;a rough affair that Owen had made
  himself and engraved with a representation of a yew-tree. That was recognised
  as his.'</p>

  <p>'Why a yew-tree?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'That was his private mark, a sort of rebus or pun on his Christian name,
  Hugh.'</p>

  <p>'But how was it,' Thorndyke asked, 'that the woman hadn't reported his
  death?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, she had left him quite soon after Blake's departure. The police had
  an idea that she had gone off with Owen to the South Sea Islands on one of
  the schooners. At any rate, she disappeared, and they weren't sorry to see
  the last of her. She was a shady character&mdash;and so, apparently, was
  Owen, for that matter.'</p>

  <p>'What was there against her?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'Well, I don't know that there was anything very definite, though there
  may have been. But she turned up rather mysteriously at Melbourne on a
  Russian tramp steamer, and the police surmised that she had left her country
  for her country's good and her own. So they entered her name&mdash;Laura
  Levinsky&mdash;on their books and kept an eye on her until she went. But, God
  bless me, what a damned old chatterbox I am! Here am I babbling away at past
  midnight, and giving you a lot of gossip that is no more your business than
  it is mine.'</p>

  <p>'I think,' said Thorndyke, 'we have all enjoyed the gossip, and as to its
  irrelevancy, who can tell? At any rate, we gather that there is no immediate
  prospect of Blake's marrying, which really does concern us.'</p>

  <p>'No,' said Brodribb, 'nor of his selling the property, though he has put
  it into the hands of Lee and Robey, the estate agents. But he won't sell it.
  Of course there's no magic in title-deeds, and his title is good enough, but
  no one would buy an important property like that with the title-deeds missing
  and liable to turn up in the wrong hands. And now I must really be off.
  You've squeezed me dry if you were out for information, and I've squeezed you
  dry,' he added with a complacent glance at the decanter, 'and a devilish good
  bottle of port it was. You can pass on what I've told you to Drayton, and
  I'll see if I can let you know what relation the heir, Charles Templeton, is
  to Arthur Blake. So goodnight and good luck, and my best respects to your
  wine merchant.'</p>

  <p>When Brodribb had gone, I stretched myself and yawned slightly.</p>

  <p>'Well,' I said, 'I don't feel sleepy, but I think I will turn in. One must
  go to bed some time.'</p>

  <p>'I don't feel sleepy either,' said Thorndyke, 'and I shall not turn in. I
  think I will just jot down a few notes of what Brodribb has told us and then
  have another look at Miss Blake's manuscript before handing it over to
  Drayton.'</p>

  <p>'Old Brodribb enjoyed the wine, didn't he?' I remarked. 'And, by Jove, it
  did set his old chin wagging. But he didn't tell us much, after all.
  Excepting the proposed sale, it was just mere personal gossip.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. But the sale question is really important. We shall have to think
  over that. He mustn't be allowed to sell the property.'</p>

  <p>'Can we prevent him?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'I think,' replied Thorndyke, 'from what Brodribb said, that a threat to
  apply for an injunction pending an investigation of the title would make him
  draw in his horns. But we shall see. Goodnight, if you are off.'</p>

  <p>By the time I had undressed, washed, and turned into bed, I began to
  suspect that Thorndyke had taken the wiser course. And as I lay in the dark,
  at first quietly but then with increasing restlessness, the suspicion
  deepened. The disturbing&mdash;indeed, alarming&mdash;events of the evening
  came crowding back into my mind and grew, minute by minute, more vivid. The
  scene in the studio arose before me with fearful reality, and worse still,
  the horrible catastrophe, barely averted by Thorndyke's watchfulness and
  wonderful prevision, actually seemed to befall before my eyes. The dreadful
  picture that Miss Blake had drawn in a few words, painted itself in my
  consciousness with the most frightful realism. I saw the sculptor's wife
  peering into the dim and silent studio in the early morning, and heard her
  shriek of horror as her glance fell on the brother and sister, lying there
  stark and dead, and Thorndyke's analysis in the laboratory took on a new and
  fearful significance. At last, after tossing in bed for over an hour, I could
  bear it no longer, and rose to go down to the sitting-room for a book.</p>

  <p>As I entered the room, Thorndyke looked up from the note-book in which he
  was writing. 'You had better have stayed up a little longer,' he remarked.
  'Now you are going to read yourself to sleep, I suppose.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I hope so,' I replied, and turned to the book-shelves to search for
  a work of a calm and cheerful tendency. The Compleat Angler appearing to
  fulfil these requirements most perfectly, I picked it out and was just about
  to move away when my glance lighted on the rather curious collection of
  objects on the table. They had made their appearance since I retired, and
  were presumably connected with some kind of investigation which my colleague
  had been pursuing while I was wooing Hypnos in vain. I looked at them
  curiously, and speculated on the nature of the inquiry. There was a
  microscope, and beside it lay the locket, opened and showing the broken
  glass, and a little, fat, greasy volume which examination showed to be a
  Latin Vulgate Bible.</p>

  <p>I laid down the volume and glanced at Thorndyke, whom I found watching me
  with a faint smile. Then I peered through the microscope and perceived what
  looked like a thread of blue glass.</p>

  <p>'Is this a thread of silk, Thorndyke?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'No,' he replied, 'it is a hair. Apparently a woman's hair.'</p>

  <p>'But,' I expostulated, 'it is blue&mdash;bright blue! Where on earth did
  you get it?'</p>

  <p>'Out of the locket,' he replied.</p>

  <p>I stared at him in amazement. 'What an extraordinary thing!' I exclaimed.
  'A blue hair! I never heard of blue hair before.'</p>

  <p>'Then,' said Thorndyke, 'my learned friend has made an addition to his
  already vast store of knowledge.'</p>

  <p>'I suppose it was dyed?' said I.</p>

  <p>'I think,' he replied, 'we may assume that the blue colour is
  adventitious.'</p>

  <p>'But why, in the name of Fortune, should a woman dye her hair blue?' I
  demanded.</p>

  <p>He shook his head. 'A curious question that, Anstey, a very curious
  question. I suggest that when my learned friend has satisfied himself as to
  the correct method of "daping or doping with a grasshopper for the chavender
  or chub," he might with advantage bring his colossal intellect to bear on
  it.'</p>

  <p>'You are an aggravating old devil, Thorndyke,' I said with conviction.
  'You know perfectly well what this thing means, and yet, when you are asked a
  civil question, you sit there wagging your exasperating old head like some
  confounded secretive effigy. I'd like to paint your cranium with Stephen's
  blue-black ink and then put it under the microscope.'</p>

  <p>He shook the threatened head conclusively. 'It would be futile, Anstey,'
  he replied 'As a method of producing blue hair it would be a complete
  failure. The effect of the tannate of iron&mdash;on exposure to
  oxygen&mdash;would entirely mask that of the indigo-carmine. No, my friend.
  Physical experiment is outside the range of a King's Counsel. Reflection is
  your proper province. And now take your book and go to bed. Consider the
  chavender or chub and also the possible connection between a blue hair and a
  gold locket; shun needless and inky strenuosities, and "be quiet and go
  a-angling."'</p>

  <p>With this he returned to his note-book, and there being evidently nothing
  more to be got out of him, I picked up my book, and having shaken my fist at
  the impassive figure by the table, once more betook myself to bed, there to
  meditate fruitlessly upon this new and curious problem.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; FROM THE JAWS OF DEATH</h2>

  <p class="first">On the following morning it seemed natural that my steps
  should stray in the direction of Jacob Street, not only that I might relieve
  my anxiety as to my friend whom I had left overnight in so distressed a
  state, but also to ascertain whether any services that I could render were at
  the moment in request. As to the former, my mind was completely set at rest
  as soon as I entered the studio (to which I was conducted by Mrs Wingrave,
  who opened the wicket), for I found Miss Blake hard at work and looking as
  cheerful and interested as if poisoned sweets and brazen-haired Jezebels were
  things unheard of.</p>

  <p>I explained, half-apologetically, the purpose of my visit, and was
  preparing a strategic retreat when she interrupted me.</p>

  <p>'Now, Mr Anstey, I will not have these formalities. We aren't strangers.
  You have been, and are, the best and kindest of friends to me and Percy, and
  we are not only grateful but we value your friendship very much indeed. As to
  Percy, he loves you.'</p>

  <p>'Does he?' said I, with an inward glow of satisfaction. 'I am proud to
  know that. And Percy's sister&mdash;?'</p>

  <p>She coloured very prettily and smilingly avoided the pitfall. 'Percy's
  sister,' she replied, 'takes an indulgent view of her brother's infatuation.
  But I am going to treat you as a friend. I am going on with my work, because
  it has to be done, even if I didn't like doing it; but it would be very nice
  and companionable if you would sit down and smoke a pipe and talk to me, that
  is, of course, if you can spare the time.'</p>

  <p>'If I could spare the time!' Why, the whole Appeal Court, with the House
  of Lords thrown in, might have sat and twiddled their thumbs for all I cared.
  But, in fact, I had nothing to do at all.</p>

  <p>'You are sure I shan't hinder you?' I said, feeling for my pipe.</p>

  <p>'Perfectly,' she answered. 'I have done all the troublesome part, you
  see&mdash;posing and draping the model,' and she pointed with her pencil to a
  lay figure (it was an elaborate, 'stuffed' figure with real hair and a wax
  face and hands), dressed in the very height of fashion, which stood, posed in
  what Lewis Carroll would have called an 'Anglo-Saxon attitude,' simpering at
  us idiotically.</p>

  <p>'That is a very magnificent costume,' I remarked. 'I suppose it is one of
  your own? Or do you keep a wardrobe for the models?'</p>

  <p>'It isn't costume at all,' she replied with a laugh. 'It is just dress
  material draped on and tacked or pinned in position. You will see if you go
  round to the other side.'</p>

  <p>I went round to the 'off-side,' and having thus discovered the fraud,
  asked: 'Is this a figure for a subject picture?'</p>

  <p>She laughed softly. 'Bless your innocent heart, Mr Anstey, I don't paint
  pictures. I draw fashion-plates. I have to earn a living, you know, and give
  Percy a start.'</p>

  <p>'What a horrid waste of talent!' I exclaimed. 'But I had no idea that
  fashion-plate artists took all this trouble'; and I pointed to the smooth
  card on her easel which bore a masterly, though rather attenuated, nude
  figure&mdash;in the Anglo-Saxon attitude&mdash;lightly drawn in pencil, and
  looking almost like a silver point.</p>

  <p>'Most of them don't,' she replied, 'and perhaps it isn't really necessary.
  But I like to make a finished pencil drawing, though it has all to be rubbed
  out when the pen work has been done over it.'</p>

  <p>'And the preliminary nude figure,' said I; 'you do that from a model, I
  suppose?'</p>

  <p>'No,' she answered. 'I can draw a nude figure well enough for this purpose
  out of my head. You see, I worked from the model for a long time at the Slade
  School, and I never threw away a drawing. I have them all bound in books, and
  I have copied them and drawn them from memory over and over again. In
  practice, one must be able to rough out a figure out of one's head.'</p>

  <p>As she talked, her pencil travelled easily and lightly over the smooth
  fashion-plate board, gradually clothing the nude figure in transparent
  habiliments, and I sat smoking with infinite contentment and watching her.
  And a very dainty, picturesque figure she made in her long blue pinafore,
  with her red-gold hair and waxen skin, as she stood gracefully poised before
  her easel, hand on hip and the drawing arm flung out straight and swinging
  easily from the shoulder. I contrasted her lithe form, in which every curve
  was full of life and grace, with the absurd rigidity of the lay-figure, her
  simple, dignified garments with the fussy exuberance of the fashionable
  costume (though, to be sure, that costume was her own creation), and was
  moved to comments on the effigy that might have lacerated its feelings if it
  had had any.</p>

  <p>'How long will this drawing take you?' I asked presently.</p>

  <p>'I shall have it done by this evening,' she replied, 'and tomorrow morning
  I shall take it to the office and deliver it to the Art editor.'</p>

  <p>'Couldn't I take it for you?' said I.</p>

  <p>'I am afraid not,' she answered. 'I must go myself to see that it is all
  right and to get instructions for the next drawings. Besides, why should
  you?'</p>

  <p>'Didn't we agree that you were to keep indoors out of harm's way? Or at
  least not to go abroad without an escort? If you must take the drawing
  yourself, you had better let me come with you to see you safely there and
  back. Do you mind?'</p>

  <p>'Of course I should like your company, Mr Anstey,' she replied, 'but it
  seems such a tax on you.'</p>

  <p>'I wish all taxes were as acceptable,' said I. 'But I understand that you
  agree; so, if you will fix a time, the escort will assemble at the gate and
  the bugles will sound "fall in" with military punctuality.'</p>

  <p>After a few more half-hearted protests she fixed the hour of half-past ten
  for the following morning, and I then took my leave, very well satisfied with
  the progress of this friendship that was becoming so dear to me, and even
  sensible of a dawning hope that a yet closer intimacy might some day become
  possible.</p>

  <p>Punctually at the appointed time the Hampstead tram set me down at the end
  of Jacob Street, when I proceeded to collect the convoy and make sail for
  Bedford Street, Covent Garden, which was the abiding-place of the Art editor
  to whom the drawing was consigned. But if the outward voyage was
  characterised by business-like directness, it was quite otherwise with the
  homeward; which was marked by so many circumnavigations and interrupted by so
  many ports of call&mdash;including the National Gallery&mdash;that it was
  well on in the afternoon when the convoy shortened sail at sixty-three Jacob
  Street, and it became necessary for the escort to put into port and take in
  stores in the form of tea and biscuits. And even then, so satisfactory had
  the voyage turned out that (to pursue the metaphor to a finish) the
  charter-party was renewed and further voyages projected.</p>

  <p>Expeditions abroad, however, could only be occasional, and even then on a
  plausible business pretext, for my fair friend was a steady worker and spent
  long days at her easel and drawing-desk; nor was I entirely without
  occupation, though Thorndyke made but the smallest demands upon my vacation
  leisure. In effect, not a day passed without a visit to Jacob Street, and
  whether my time was spent placidly watching the growth of a new drawing, in
  executing shopping commissions, or in escort duties, it was all equally
  pleasant to me, and day by day more firmly established my position as the
  indispensable friend of the little household.</p>

  <p>Affairs had been on this footing for about a week when early on a certain
  afternoon I set forth from the Temple for my daily call, but with a more
  definite purpose than usual, for I bore with me the locket, in which Polton
  had fixed a new glass. I rang the studio bell with the customary pleasurable
  anticipation of the warm and evidently sincere welcome, and listened
  complacently to Mrs Wingrave's footsteps as she came along the paved passage,
  and as the wicket opened I prepared to step jauntily through. But the first
  words that the worthy lady spoke scattered in an instant all my pleasant
  thoughts and filled me with alarm.</p>

  <p>'Miss Blake has just gone out,' she said. 'A most sad thing has happened.
  Poor Master Percy has had an accident. He has broken his leg.'</p>

  <p>'Where did this happen, and when?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'It must have happened about an hour ago,' she replied. 'I don't know
  where, but they have taken him into a house near Chalk Farm.'</p>

  <p>'Who brought the news?' I demanded breathlessly; for, seeing that Percy
  would be at school at the time mentioned, the story was, on the face of it,
  highly suspicious.</p>

  <p>'It was a lady who brought the message,' said Mrs Wingrave. 'She wouldn't
  come in, but she handed me a note, written in pencil and marked "urgent".
  Miss Blake showed it to me. It didn't give any particulars beyond what I have
  told you, and the address of the house.'</p>

  <p>'What was the lady like?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'Well,' Mrs Wingrave replied, 'I call her a lady, but she was really
  rather a common-looking woman; painted and powdered and very vulgarly
  dressed.'</p>

  <p>'Did you notice her hair?'</p>

  <p>'Yes; you couldn't help noticing it. Brassy-looking, golden stuff, frizzed
  out like a mop&mdash;and her eyebrows were as black as mine are.'</p>

  <p>'Do you know where the note is?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'I expect Miss Blake took it with her, but she may have left it in the
  studio. Shall we go and see?'</p>

  <p>We hurried together across the yard and into the studio, where for a
  minute or so we searched the tables and the unfastened bureau. But there was
  no sign of the note.</p>

  <p>'She must have taken it with her,' said Mrs Wingrave. 'But I think I can
  give you the address, if that is what you want. You don't think there's
  anything wrong, do you?'</p>

  <p>'I am extremely uneasy, Mrs Wingrave,' said I, producing my notebook and a
  pencil, 'and I shall go straight to the house, if I can find it. What is the
  address? For Heaven's sake don't give me a wrong one!'</p>

  <p>'I remember it quite clearly,' she replied, 'and I think I know the place.
  It is number twenty-nine Scoresby Terrace, a corner house; and the terrace
  turns out of Sackett's Road on the left side going up from here.'</p>

  <p>I wrote this down in my note-book and then asked: 'How long has Miss Blake
  been gone?'</p>

  <p>'She started less than ten minutes before you came,' was the reply. 'If
  you hurry you may possibly over-take her.'</p>

  <p>We came out of the studio, and as we crossed the yard she gave me very
  full and clear directions as to how to find the place, some of which I jotted
  down. Passing a marble tombstone on which her husband had been working, I
  noticed a number of his tools lying on a sack, and among them a long chisel,
  almost like a small crowbar. 'May I borrow this, Mrs Wingrave?' I said,
  picking it up. 'Certainly, if you want to,' she replied with a look of
  surprise.</p>

  <p>'Thank you,' I said, slipping it up my sleeve. 'I may have to force a
  door, you know,' and with this I let myself out at the wicket and strode away
  swiftly up the street.</p>

  <p>I am habitually a rapid walker, and now I covered the ground at a pace
  that made other pedestrians stare. For Winifred, I felt sure, would have
  flown to her brother on the wings of terror, and hurry as I might, I should
  be hard put to it to overtake her. But her terror could have been nothing
  compared with mine. As I raced along the shabby streets, swinging the chisel
  openly in my hand&mdash;for its presence in my sleeve was a sensible
  hindrance&mdash;the sinister possibilities&mdash;nay,
  probabilities&mdash;that, unsought, suggested themselves one after another,
  kept me in a state of sickening dread. Supposing I failed to find the place
  after all! It was quite possible, for the neighbourhood was strange and
  rather intricate. Or suppose I should lose time in searching for the house
  and arrive at last, only to find&mdash;Here I set my teeth and fairly broke
  into a run, regardless of the inquisitive stares of idlers at doors and
  street corners. But, for all my terror and horrible forebodings, I kept my
  wits and held my attention firmly to Mrs Wingrave's directions, and I derived
  a faint encouragement from the fact that I had never lost touch of the
  landmarks and that every hurried step was bringing me nearer to my goal. At
  length, want of breath compelled me to drop into a walk, but a couple of
  minutes later, with a gasp of relief, I reached the corner of Sackett's Road;
  and even as I swung round into the long, straight, dreary street, I caught a
  glimpse of a woman, at the far end, hurrying forward in the same direction.
  It was only a momentary glimpse, for in the instant when I saw her she turned
  swiftly into a by-street to the left. But brief as was the vision, and far
  away as she was, no doubt was possible to me. It was Winifred.</p>

  <p>I drew a deep breath. Surely I should be in time. And perhaps my fears
  might be groundless after all. The plot might be but the creation of my own
  uneasy suspicion. At any rate, I was nearly there, and it was hardly possible
  that in a few short minutes anything could happen&mdash;but here all my
  terrors came crowding on me again, and, breathless as I was, I again broke
  into a run.</p>

  <p>As I reached the corner of Scoresby Terrace and looked at the corner
  house, my heart seemed to stand still. A single glance showed that it was an
  empty house, and the horrible desolation of its aspect was made more dreadful
  by the silence and the total absence of any sign of life. I flew across the
  road, and barely glancing at the number-twenty-nine-raced up the garden path
  and tugged furiously at the bell.</p>

  <p>Instantly the hollow shell reverberated with a hideous jangling that
  sounded more ominous and dreadful from the vacancy that the discordant echoes
  bespoke. But it slowly died away and was succeeded by no answering sound. A
  deadly silence enveloped the ill-omened place. Not a creak upon the stair,
  not a sign of life or movement could I detect, though I held my breath to
  listen. Yet this was the house, and she was in it&mdash;and that other! Again
  I wrenched at the bell, and again the horrible jangling filled the place with
  echoes, like some infernal peal rung by a company of ghouls. And still there
  was no answer.</p>

  <p>In a frenzy of terror I rushed down the side passage, and bursting open
  the flimsy gate, ran into the back garden and tried the back door. But it was
  locked and bolted. Then I darted to the back parlour window, and springing on
  the sill, shattered, with a stroke of the chisel, the pane above the catch.
  Passing my hand in through the hole, I drew back the catch and slid up the
  lower sash. I had noticed that the wooden shutters were not quite closed, but
  at the moment that I slid up the window-sash, the shutters closed and I heard
  the cross-bar snap into its socket.</p>

  <p>For a moment I had a thought of running round to the front and breaking in
  the street door. But only for a moment. Rescue, not capture, was my purpose.
  A glance at the flimsy, decrepit shutters showed me the way in. Thrusting the
  edge of the long, powerful chisel into the crack close to the lower hinge, I
  gave a violent wrench, and forthwith the hinge came away from the jamb, the
  screws drawing easily from the rotten woodwork. Another thrust and another
  wrench at the upper hinge brought that away too; at a push the whole shutter
  swung inward and I sprang down into the room. And at that moment I heard the
  street door shut.</p>

  <p>I ran across the room to the door. Of course it was locked and the key was
  outside. But I was not a criminal lawyer for nothing. In a moment I had the
  chisel driven in beside the lock, and pressing on the long handle, drove the
  door back on its hinges, when the lock-bolt and latch disengaged from the
  striking-plate and the door came open at once.</p>

  <p>I ran out into the hall, unlocked the front room, and looked in, but it
  was empty. Then I flew up the stairs and was about to unlock the door of the
  first room that I came to, when I became aware of a soft, shuffling sound
  proceeding apparently from the next room. Instantly I ran to that door, and
  turning the key, flung it open.</p>

  <p>The sight that met my eyes as I darted into the room was but the vision of
  a moment, but in that moment it imprinted itself upon my memory for ever.
  Even now, as I write, it rises before me, vivid and horrible, with such
  dreadful remembrance that my hand falters as it guides the pen. In a corner
  near the wall she lay&mdash;my sweet, gracious Winifred-lay huddled, writhing
  feebly and fumbling with her hands at her throat. Her face was of the colour
  of slate, her lips black, her eyes wide and protruding.</p>

  <p>It was, I say, but the vision of a moment, a frightful, unforgettable
  moment. The next, I was on my knees beside her, my open knife was in my hand,
  its keen edge eating through the knot at the back of her neck that secured
  the band that was strangling her. A moment of agonised impatience and then
  the knot was divided and the band hastily unwound&mdash;it was a narrow
  silken scarf&mdash;revealing a livid groove in the plump neck.</p>

  <p>As I took away the scarf she drew a deep, gasping breath with a hoarse,
  distressful sound like the breathing of a croup-stricken child. Again and
  again it was repeated, growing quicker and more irregular, and with each
  succeeding gasp the horrible purple of face and lips faded away, leaving a
  pallor as of marble; the dreadfully protruding eyes sank back until they
  looked almost normal, though wild and frightened.</p>

  <p>I watched these changes with a sense of utter helplessness, though not
  without relief&mdash;for they were clearly changes for the better. But I
  longed to help her, to do something active to advance her recovery. If only I
  had had Thorndyke's knowledge I might have been of some use. He would have
  known what to do. But perhaps there was nothing to be done but wait for her
  natural recovery. At any rate, that was all that I could do. And so I
  remained kneeling by her side with her head resting on my arm, holding her
  hand, and looking with infinite pity and affection into the frightened,
  trustful eyes that sought my own with such pathetic appeal.</p>

  <p>Presently, as her breathing grew easier, the gasps began to be mingled
  with sobs; and then, suddenly, she burst into tears and wept passionately,
  almost hysterically, with her face buried against my shoulder. I was
  profoundly moved, indeed I was almost ready to weep myself, so intense was
  the revulsion now that the danger was past. In the tumult of my emotions I
  forgot everything but that she was saved, and that I loved her. As I sought
  to comfort her, to coax away her terrors, to soothe and reassure her, I
  cannot tell what words of tenderness I murmured into her ear, by what
  endearing names I addressed her. Stirred as I was to the very depths of my
  soul, I was aware of nothing but the great realities. In the stress of terror
  but now barely past and the joy and relief of the hardly hoped for recovery,
  the world of everyday was forgotten. All I knew was that she was here, safe
  in my arms, and that she was all in all to me.</p>

  <p>By degrees her emotion expended its force and she grew calmer. Presently
  she sat up, and having wiped her eyes, looked nervously about the empty
  room.</p>

  <p>'Let us go away from this dreadful place,' she said in a low, frightened
  voice, laying her hand entreatingly on my arm.</p>

  <p>'We will,' said I, 'if you are well enough yet to walk. Let us see.'</p>

  <p>I stood up and lifted her to her feet, but she was very unsteady and weak.
  I doubt if she could have stood without support, for I could feel her
  trembling as she leaned on me heavily. Still, with my help, she tottered to
  the door and crossed the landing, and then, very slowly, we descended the
  stairs. At the open door of the room which I had entered, we paused to adjust
  her hat and remove any traces of the struggle before we should emerge into
  the street. I was still holding the silken scarf, and now put it into my
  pocket to free my hands that I might assist her in settling her hat and the
  crumpled collar of her dress. As I looked her over to see that all was in
  order, I noticed three or four conspicuous golden hairs sticking to her right
  sleeve. I picked them off and was in the act of dropping them when it
  occurred to me that Thorndyke might be able to extract some information from
  them, whereupon I brought out my pocket-book and slipped them between the
  leaves.</p>

  <p>'That is how I got into the house,' I said, pointing to the shattered
  window and the hanging shutter.</p>

  <p>She peered fearfully into the empty room and said: 'I heard the crash of
  the glass. It was that which saved me, I think, for that brute heard it too,
  and rushed away downstairs instantly. How did you break open the
  shutter?'</p>

  <p>'I did it with a chisel of Mr Wingrave's-and that reminds me that I have
  left the chisel upstairs. I must take it back to him.'</p>

  <p>I bounded up the stairs, and running into the room, snatched up the chisel
  from the floor and ran out again. As I turned the corner of the staircase, I
  met her beginning to ascend the stair, clinging to the handrail and sobbing
  hysterically. I cursed myself for having left her, even for a few moments,
  and putting my arm around her, led her back into the hall.</p>

  <p>'Oh, pray forgive me!' she sobbed. 'I am all unstrung. I couldn't bear to
  be alone.'</p>

  <p>'Of course you couldn't,' said I, drawing her head to my shoulder and
  stroking her pale cheek. 'I oughtn't to have left you. But try, Winnie dear,
  to realise that it is now over and gone. And let us get out of this
  house.'</p>

  <p>She wiped her eyes again, and as her sobs died away into an occasional
  moan, I opened the street door. The sight of the open street and the sunlight
  seemed to calm her at once. She put away her handkerchief, and clinging to my
  arm, walked slowly and a little unsteadily by my side down the garden path
  and out at the gate.</p>

  <p>'I wonder where we can get a cab,' said I.</p>

  <p>'There is a station not very far away, I believe,' said she. 'Perhaps some
  one can direct us.'</p>

  <p>We walked slowly down Sackett's Road, looking about that curiously
  deserted thoroughfare for some likely person from whom to make inquiries,
  when I saw a taxi-cab draw up at a house and discharge its passengers. I
  managed to attract the notice of the driver, and a minute later we were
  seated in the vehicle travelling swiftly homeward.</p>

  <p>During the short journey hardly a word was exchanged. She was quite
  composed now, but she was still deathly pale and lay back in her seat with an
  air of intense fatigue and exhaustion. When we reached the studio I helped
  her out of the cab, and having dismissed it, led her to the gate and rang the
  bell.</p>

  <p>Instantly I heard hurried steps in the passage, the wicket was flung open,
  and Mrs Wingrave looked out eagerly. When she saw us, she burst into
  tears.</p>

  <p>'Thank God!' she exclaimed. 'I've been in an agony of suspense. Directly
  Percy came home, I knew that Mr Anstey must be right&mdash;that the message
  about him was a trap of some sort. What has happened?'</p>

  <p>'I'll tell you later, Mrs Wingrave,' Winifred replied. 'I don't want to
  talk about it now. Is Percy at home?'</p>

  <p>'No. The two Wallingford boys were with him. He has gone home to tea with
  them. I thought it best to say nothing, and let him go. They live quite near
  here.'</p>

  <p>'I am glad you did,' said Winifred, as we crossed the yard-where I
  replaced the invaluable chisel. 'Perhaps we needn't tell him anything about
  this.'</p>

  <p>'It might be better not to,' said Mrs Wingrave. 'And now go and sit down
  quietly in the studio and I will bring you some tea. You both look as if you
  wanted some rest and refreshment.' She bustled away towards her own residence
  and Winifred and I entered the studio.</p>

  <p>As I held the curtain aside to let her pass, my companion halted and
  looked round the great, bare hall with an air of deep reflection&mdash;almost
  of curiosity. 'I never thought to look upon this place again,' she said
  gravely; 'and I never should but for you. My life is your gift, Mr
  Anstey.'</p>

  <p>'It is a very precious life to me, Winifred,' said I. And then I added: 'I
  can't call you Miss Blake.'</p>

  <p>'I am glad of that,' she said, looking at me with a smile. 'It would sound
  very cool and formal now when you have held my life in your hands, and my
  heart is bursting with gratitude to you.' She laid her hand on my arm for a
  moment, and then, as if afraid of saying too much, returned abruptly to the
  subject of her brother. 'It is fortunate Percy was not at home. I don't think
  we need tell him, at least not just now. Do you think so?'</p>

  <p>'I don't see any necessity,' I replied. 'He knows the general position and
  the precautions that have to be taken. Perhaps he can be told later. And now
  you must just sit on the settee and rest quietly, for you are as pale as a
  ghost still. I wonder you have not collapsed altogether.'</p>

  <p>In a few minutes Mrs Wingrave brought in the tea and placed it on a table
  by Winifred's settee. I drew up a chair and performed the presidential
  functions in respect of the teapot, and under the influence of the homely
  ceremony and the reviving stimulant my patient began to recover something
  like her normal appearance and manner. I kept up a flow of more or less
  commonplace talk, avoiding, for the present, any reference to the terrible
  events of the afternoon, the details of which I decided to elucidate later
  when the effect of the shock had passed off.</p>

  <p>The postponement, however, was shorter than I had intended, for when we
  had finished tea and I had carried the tray across the yard and restored it
  to Mrs Wingrave, Winifred opened the subject herself.</p>

  <p>'You haven't asked me how this thing happened,' she said, as I re-entered
  the studio and sat down beside her in the vacant place on the settee.</p>

  <p>'No. I thought you wouldn't want to talk about it just now.'</p>

  <p>'I don't want to talk about it to Mrs Wingrave,' said she. 'But you are my
  deliverer. I don't mind telling you&mdash;besides you ought to know. And I
  want to know, too, by what extraordinary chance you came to be in that place
  at that critical moment. When I saw you come into the room, it seemed as if a
  miracle had happened.'</p>

  <p>'There was nothing very miraculous about it,' said I, 'except that I
  happened to arrive at the studio a little earlier than usual.' And here I
  gave her an account of my arrival and my interview with Mrs Wingrave and my
  efforts to overtake her.</p>

  <p>'It was very clever of Mrs Wingrave to remember the address so clearly,'
  said Winifred.</p>

  <p>'It is a mercy that she did,' said I. 'If she had not&mdash;but there, we
  won't think of that. What happened when you got to the house?'</p>

  <p>'I rang the bell and a woman opened the door. I hardly saw her until I had
  entered the hall and she had shut the door, and then&mdash;you know how dark
  the hall was&mdash;I couldn't see her very distinctly. But I noticed that she
  was a good deal powdered and that she had bright, unreal-looking golden hair,
  though that didn't show much as she had a handkerchief tied over her head and
  under her chin. And I also noticed that her face seemed in some way familiar
  to me.</p>

  <p>'As soon as she had shut the door the woman said in a rather peculiar
  voice: "You must excuse the state of the house, we haven't properly moved in
  yet. The little man is with the nurse on the first floor, the second room you
  come to. Will you go up?"</p>

  <p>'I ran up the stairs and she followed close behind me. When I came to the
  second room, I asked: "Is this the one?" and when she answered "Yes," I
  opened the door and stepped in. Then, of course, I saw it was an empty room,
  and instantly I suspected that it was a trap. But at that moment the woman
  threw the scarf over my head and pulled it tight. I turned round quickly, but
  she dodged behind me and pulled me into the room, and there we struggled and
  kept turning round and round for hours, as it seemed to me, she trying to get
  behind me to tie the scarf, and I struggling to keep her in front of me. She
  still held both ends of the scarf, and though she was not able to pull it
  quite tight, it was tight enough to make my breathing difficult and to
  prevent me from calling out. At last I managed to turn quickly and seize her
  by the hair and the handkerchief that was tied over her head. But the
  handkerchief came away in my hand and the hair with it. It was a wig. And
  then, to my horror, I saw that this was not a woman at all. It was a man! The
  man who stabbed me that night at Hampstead! I recognised him instantly, and
  the shock was so awful that I nearly fainted. For a moment I felt perfectly
  helpless, and in that moment he got behind me and tied the scarf and pulled
  it tight.</p>

  <p>'Then there came a tremendous pealing of the bell. The man started
  violently, and I could feel his hands trembling as he tried to finish tying
  the knot while I struggled to get hold of his wrists. But, of course, I could
  not struggle long, for the scarf was so tight that it almost completely
  stopped my breathing, and the horror of the thing took away all my strength.
  When the bell rang the second time, he broke into a torrent of curses mixed
  with a curious sort of whimpering, and flung me violently on the floor. He
  was just finishing the knot when I heard a crash of glass down below, and at
  that he sprang to his feet, snatched up the wig and handkerchief, and flew
  down the stairs.</p>

  <p>'After this there seemed a long, long interval. Of course it was only a
  matter of seconds, I suppose, but it was agonising&mdash;that horrible
  feeling of suffocation. At last I heard a bursting sound down below. Then the
  street door shut, and then&mdash;just as I seemed to be losing
  consciousness&mdash;you came into the room, and I knew that I was saved.' She
  paused, and then, laying her hand on mine, she continued: 'I haven't thanked
  you for saving me from that horrible death. I can't. No words are enough. Any
  talk of gratitude would be mere anticlimax.'</p>

  <p>There is no question of gratitude, Winnie,' said I. 'Your life is more to
  me than my own, so there is no virtue in my cherishing it. But I needn't tell
  you that, for I suspect that my secret has slipped out unawares already.'</p>

  <p>'Your secret?' she repeated.</p>

  <p>'That I love you, Winnie dearest. You must know it by now. I suppose I
  ought not to speak of it just at this time. And yet&mdash;well, perhaps I
  might ask you if you would take time to consider whether we might not, some
  day, be more to one another than we are now.'</p>

  <p>She looked down gravely though a little shyly, but she answered without
  hesitation: 'I don't need to take time to consider. I can tell you at once
  that I am proud to be loved by such a man as you. And it is not a case of
  gratitude. I should have said the same if you had asked me yesterday&mdash;or
  even longer ago than that.'</p>

  <p>'Thank you for telling me that, Winnie,' said I. 'It would have been an
  unworthy thing if I had seemed to presume on any small service&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'It would have been an absurd thing to have any such idea, Mr Anstey.'</p>

  <p>'Mr Anstey?' I repeated. 'May I humbly mention that I also have a
  Christian name?'</p>

  <p>'I always suspected that you had,' she retorted with a smile, 'and I must
  confess to having speculated as to what it might be.'</p>

  <p>'It takes the prosaic form of Robert, commonly perverted by my own family
  to Robin.'</p>

  <p>'And a very pretty name, too,' said she. 'But you are a foolish Robin to
  speak in that way about yourself. The mistake you are making,' she continued,
  holding up an admonitory forefinger, 'is that you don't realise what an
  exceedingly nice person you are. But we realise it. Mrs Wingrave is quite
  fond of you; Percy loves you; and as for Percy's sister, well, she lost her
  heart longer ago than she is prepared to admit. So let us hear no more
  ridiculous self-deprecations.'</p>

  <p>'There shall be no more, sweetheart,' said I. 'You have taken away the
  occasion and the excuse. A man who has won the heart of the sweetest and
  loveliest girl in the whole world would be a fool to undervalue himself. But
  it is a wonderful thing, Winnie. I can hardly believe in my good fortune.
  When I saw you that night at Hampstead, I thought you were the most beautiful
  girl I had ever seen. And now I know I was right. But how little did I dream
  that that lovely girl would one day be my own!'</p>

  <p>'I say again that you are a foolish Robin,' said she, resting her cheek
  against my shoulder. 'You think your goose is a swan. But go on thinking it,
  and she will be as near a swan as she can manage, or failing that, a very
  faithful, affectionate goose.'</p>

  <p>She looked up at me with a smile, half-shy but wholly endearing, and
  noting how her marble-white cheeks had grown pink and rosy, I kissed her;
  whereupon they grew pinker still.</p>

  <p>It was all for our good that Percy lingered with his friends and left us
  to the undisturbed possession of our new happiness. For me the golden minutes
  supped away unnumbered&mdash;sullenly and relentlessly checked, however, by
  my unconsulted watch&mdash;as we sat, side by side and hand clasped in hand.
  We talked little; not that we were, as Rosalind would say, 'Gravelled for
  lack of matter' (and even if we had been, Rosalind's admirable expedient was
  always available). But perfect companionship is independent of mere verbal
  converse. There is no need for speech when two hearts are singing in
  unison.</p>

  <p>At last there came the expected peal of the bell. I might, I suppose, have
  gone out to open the wicket, but, in fact, I left that office to Mrs
  Wingrave.</p>

  <p>'I don't think Percy will notice anything unusual,' said I. 'You look
  perfectly recovered now.'</p>

  <p>'I suppose I do,' she answered with a smile. 'There have been
  restoratives, you see.'</p>

  <p>'So there have,' I agreed, and ex abundantia cautelae, as we lawyers say,
  I added a sort of restorative codicil even as the quick footsteps pattered
  across the yard.</p>

  <p>Whether Percy observed anything unusual I cannot say with certainty. He
  was a born diplomatist and a very model of discretion. But I have a strong
  suspicion that he detected some new note in the harmony of our little
  society. Particularly when I addressed his sister as Winnie did he seem to
  cock an attentive ear; and when she addressed me as Robin he cocked both
  ears. But he made no sign. He was a jewel of a boy. No lover could have asked
  for anything more perfect in the way of a prospective brother-in-law.</p>

  <p>But my suspicion of that juvenile diplomat was confirmed&mdash;and my
  admiration of his judgment reached a climax&mdash;when the time arrived for
  me to go, and Winifred rose to accompany me to the gate. This had always been
  Percy's office. But now he shook hands with me without turning a hair and
  without even a glance at the studio door. It was a marvellous instance of
  precocious intelligence.</p>

  <p>We had left the studio and were just crossing the yard when suddenly I
  bethought me of the locket which Thorndyke had entrusted to me for delivery,
  and which I had, up to this moment, completely forgotten.</p>

  <p>'Here is another narrow escape,' said I. 'The special errand which, to the
  uninitiated, appeared to be the occasion of my visit here today, has never
  been discharged. I was to give you your locket, which the ingenious Polton
  has made as good as new, and had forgotten all about it. However, it is not
  too late,' and here I took the little bauble from my pocket and handed it to
  her.</p>

  <p>'I am glad it came today, of all days,' she said as she took it from me.
  'Now I can wear it as a sort of memento. If we had only known, Robin, we
  could have got Mr Polton to engrave the date on the back.'</p>

  <p>'He can do that later,' said I. 'It is engraved on my heart already. I can
  never forget a single moment of this day. And what a wonderful day it has
  been! What a day of wild extremes! Within a few hours I have suffered the
  most intense misery and dread that I have ever experienced, and been blessed
  with the greatest happiness that I have ever known. And as to you, my poor
  darling&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Not a poor darling at all,' she interrupted, 'but a very rich and proud
  and happy one. A day of storm and sunshine it has indeed been, but the storm
  came first, and "in the evening there was light." And after all, Robin dear,
  you can't have a rainbow without rain.'</p>

  <p>By this tune we had reached the gate; and when I had taken her in my arms
  and kissed her, I opened the wicket and passed out. As it closed behind me I
  looked up and down the dreary street, but it was dreary to me no longer. I
  don't know who Jacob was&mdash;I mean this particular Jacob&mdash;but as I
  stopped to look back fondly at the factory-like gate, I felt that I was in
  some sort under an obligation to him as the (presumptive) creator of the
  sacred thoroughfare.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; THORNDYKE STATES HIS POSITION</h2>

  <p class="first">Recalling the events of the evening after leaving the
  studio, I am sensible of a somewhat hazy interval between the moment when I
  turned the corner of Jacob Street and my arrival at the familiar precincts of
  the Temple. After the fashion of the aboriginal Londoner, I had simply set my
  face in the desired direction and walked, unconscious of particular streets,
  instinctively or subconsciously heading for my destination by the shortest
  route. And meanwhile my mind was busy with the stirring incidents of this
  most eventful day, with its swift alternations of storm and sunshine, its
  terror, its despair, and its golden reward. So my thoughts now alternated
  between joy at the attainment of a happiness scarcely hoped for and
  apprehension of the dangers that lurked unseen, ready to spring forth and
  wreck the life that was more to me than my own.</p>

  <p>Thus meditating, I sped through by-streets innumerable and unnoted,
  crossing quiet squares and traversing narrow courts and obscure passages, but
  always shunning the main thoroughfares with their disturbing glare and noise,
  until I came, as it were, to the surface at the end of Chichester Rents, and
  turned into Chancery Lane. There the familiar surroundings brought me back to
  my everyday world, and my thoughts took a new direction. What would Thorndyke
  have to say to my news? Had he any resources unknown to me for staving off
  this very imminent danger? And would the terrible episode of the empty house
  convey any enlightenment to him that I had missed?</p>

  <p>Still revolving these questions, I dived down Middle Temple Lane and
  presently became aware of a tall figure some little distance ahead, walking
  in the same direction as my own. I had nearly overtaken him when he turned at
  the entrance to Pump Court and looked back, whereupon a mutual recognition
  brought us both to a halt.</p>

  <p>'I expect we are bound for the same port, Anstey,' said he as we shook
  hands. 'I am going to call on Thorndyke. You are still helping him, aren't
  you?'</p>

  <p>'He says I am, and I hope it is true. At any rate, Jervis has not come
  back yet, if that is what you mean. I suppose, Drayton, you haven't any fresh
  information for us?'</p>

  <p>Sir Lawrence shook his head gloomily. 'No,' he answered, 'I have learned
  nothing new, nor, I fear, are any of us likely to. Those brutes seem to have
  got away without leaving a trace that it is possible to make anything of. We
  can't expect impossibilities even of Thorndyke. But I am not calling on him
  with reference to the murder case. I want him to come down with me to
  Aylesbury to help me with an interview. A question of survivorship has
  arisen, and he knows more about that subject than I do, so I should like him
  to elicit the facts, if possible.'</p>

  <p>As we walked through Pump Court and the Cloisters, I debated with myself
  whether I should tell Drayton of the horror that this day had witnessed. He
  was an interested party in more than one sense, for he had the warmest regard
  for Winifred. But I knew that he would be profoundly shocked, and as he
  continued to talk of the case on which he wanted Thorndyke's advice, I said
  nothing for the present.</p>

  <p>When I let myself and Drayton in with my latch-key, we found Thorndyke
  seated at the table with a microscope and a tray of reagents and mounting
  materials, preparing slides of animal hairs to add to his already extensive
  collection.</p>

  <p>'I am ashamed to disturb you at this hour,' Drayton began.</p>

  <p>But Thorndyke interrupted him. 'You are not disturbing me at all. This
  kind of work can be taken up and put down at any moment.'</p>

  <p>'It is very good of you to say so,' said Drayton, 'and I will take you at
  your word.' And thereupon he opened the matter of which he had spoken to
  me.</p>

  <p>'When do you want me to come down to Aylesbury?' Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>'The day after tomorrow, if you can manage it.'</p>

  <p>Thorndyke reflected for a few moments as he picked up with his forceps a
  newly-cleaned cover-glass, and delicately dropped it on the specimen that
  floated in its little pool of balsam.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' he said at length, 'I think we can arrange that. There isn't very
  much doing just now.'</p>

  <p>'Very well,' said Sir Lawrence. 'Then I will call for you at ten o'clock,
  and I needn't trouble you with any details now. We can talk the case over on
  the way down.' He rose as if to depart, but as he turned towards the door, he
  stopped and looked back at Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>'I am afraid,' said he, 'that I have rather neglected our friend Miss
  Blake. Has either of you seen her lately?'</p>

  <p>Thorndyke gave me a quick look, and in the short interval before replying,
  I could see that he was rapidly debating how much he should tell Sir
  Lawrence. Apparently he reached the same conclusion as I had, that we could
  hardly conceal material facts from him, for he replied:</p>

  <p>'Yes, we have both seen her quite lately; in fact, I think Anstey has just
  come from her studio. And I am sorry to say, we are both rather anxious about
  her.'</p>

  <p>'Indeed,' said Drayton, laying down his hat and seating himself. 'What is
  amiss with her?'</p>

  <p>'The trouble is,' replied Thorndyke, 'that she is the sole witness to the
  identity of the murderers, and they realise it, and they have determined,
  accordingly, to get rid of her.' And here he gave Sir Lawrence an account of
  the incident of the poisoned chocolates and the circumstances that had led up
  to it.</p>

  <p>Drayton was thunderstruck. As he listened to Thorndyke's vivid and precise
  narration, he sat motionless, with parted lips and his hands on his knees,
  the very picture of amazement and horror.</p>

  <p>'But, good God!' he exclaimed, when Thorndyke had finished 'this is
  perfectly frightful! It is a horrible state of things. Something must be
  done, you know. It is practically certain that they will make some further
  attempt.'</p>

  <p>'They have already,' said I. And as the two men turned to me with looks of
  startled inquiry, I recounted&mdash;not without discomfort in recalling
  them&mdash;the terrible events of that afternoon.</p>

  <p>My two friends listened with rapt attention as I told the hideous story,
  and on each it produced characteristic effects. Sir Lawrence glared at me
  with a scowl of suppressed fury, while Thorndyke's face settled into a rigid
  immobility like that of a stone mask.</p>

  <p>When I had concluded, Drayton sprang to his feet and began to pace the
  room in uncontrollable agitation, muttering and cursing under his breath.
  Suddenly he halted opposite Thorndyke, and gazing frowningly into his set
  face, demanded: 'Is it not possible to do something? Something radical and
  effective, I mean? I don't know what cards you hold, Thorndyke, and I am not
  going to embarrass you by asking for details, but are you in a position to
  make any kind of move?'</p>

  <p>Thorndyke, who had also risen, and now stood with his back to the fire,
  looked down reflectively for a few moments. At length he replied:</p>

  <p>'The difficulty is, Drayton, that if we move prematurely, we run a serious
  risk of failing, and we can't afford to fail.'</p>

  <p>'Do I understand, then, that you are in a position to take action?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. But it would be extremely unsafe, for if we fail once we fail
  finally. It would be a gamble, and we should quite probably lose. Whereas, if
  we can wait, we shall have these men to a certainty. We have taken their
  measure and we know now exactly what kind of persons we are dealing with. You
  see, Drayton,' he continued after a brief pause, 'secret crime most commonly
  comes to light through the efforts of the criminal to cover his tracks. That
  is so in the present case. All that I know as to the identity of these men I
  have learned from their struggles to conceal it. But for their multitudinous
  precautions I should have known nothing about them. And you see for yourself
  that they are criminals of the usual kind who will not let well alone. They
  keep making fresh efforts to secure their safety, and each time they make a
  move we learn something more about them. If only we can wait, they will
  surely deliver themselves into our hands.'</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence. Then Sir Lawrence gave utterance to the thought
  that was in my own mind.</p>

  <p>'That is all very well, Thorndyke, and as a lawyer I fully understand your
  desire to get a conclusive case before making a move. But can we afford to
  wait? Are we justified in using this poor young lady as a bait to enable us
  to catch these villains?'</p>

  <p>'If that were the position,' replied Thorndyke, 'there could be but one
  answer. But we must remember that the capture of these men is the condition
  on which her safety depends. If we fail, we fail for her as well as for
  ourselves.'</p>

  <p>'Then,' asked Drayton, 'what do you suggest? You don't propose to stand by
  passively until they make some fresh attempt to murder her?'</p>

  <p>'No. I suggest that more complete precautions be taken to secure Miss
  Blake's safety, and meanwhile I hope to fill in one or two blanks in my
  collection of evidential facts and perhaps induce these men to make a move in
  a new direction. I think I can promise to bring the affair to a climax in one
  way or another, and that pretty soon.'</p>

  <p>'Very well,' said Drayton, once more taking up his hat. 'But who is going
  to look after Miss Blake?'</p>

  <p>'Anstey has taken that duty on himself,' replied Thorndyke, 'and I don't
  think any one could do it better. If he wants assistance or advice, he has
  only to call upon us.'</p>

  <p>With this arrangement Drayton appeared to be satisfied, though he still
  appeared uneasy&mdash;as, indeed, we all were. But he made no further
  suggestion, and very shortly took his leave.</p>

  <p>For some time after his departure not a word was spoken. The conversation
  that had just taken place had given me abundant food for reflection, while
  Thorndyke, who still stood with his back to the fire, maintained a grim
  silence. Evidently he was thinking hard, and a glance at his
  face&mdash;stern, rigid, inexorable&mdash;assured me that his cogitations
  boded ill for those who had aroused his righteous anger. At length he looked
  up and asked:</p>

  <p>'What measures can you suggest for Miss Blake's protection?'</p>

  <p>'I have told her that, for the present, she must not go out of doors on
  any occasion whatever unless accompanied by me&mdash;or, of course, by you or
  Drayton. She has promised to abide absolutely by that rule and to make no
  exception to it. She has also promised to keep the studio door locked and to
  inspect any visitors from the window of the bedroom adjoining before
  unlocking it.'</p>

  <p>'If she keeps to those rules she should be quite safe,' said Thorndyke.
  'They are not likely to try to break in. There is a man living on the
  premises, I think?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Mr Wingrave is about the place at his work most of the day, and, of
  course, he is always there at night.'</p>

  <p>'Then, I think we may feel reasonably secure for the present; and I am
  glad you have made such complete arrangements, for I was going to suggest
  that you come down with us to Aylesbury.'</p>

  <p>'With what object?' I asked. 'Drayton won't want me at the
  conference.'</p>

  <p>'No. But it just occurred to me that, as we shall be within a mile or two
  of Beauchamp Blake and can easily take it on our way back, we might go and
  have a look at the place and see if we can pick up any information on the
  spot. I believe the question of the sale of the property is more or less in
  abeyance, but it would be just as well to make a few inquiries locally.'</p>

  <p>I received the suggestion with some surprise but no enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>'Doesn't it seem rather inopportune,' I said, 'with these imminent dangers
  impending, to be occupying ourselves in prosecuting this shadowy claim?
  Surely this is no time for building castles in the air. The chance of young
  Percival's ever coming into this property is infinitely remote, and we can
  attend to it when we have done with more urgent matters.'</p>

  <p>'If we attend to it at all,' he replied 'we must do so when we have the
  opportunity. Should the property be sold, Percy's chance will be gone for
  good. And the conflict between our two purposes is only in your mind. The
  fact of our keeping an eye on Percy's interests will not hinder our pursuit
  of the wretches who murdered poor Drayton and would now murder Percy's
  sister. You can trust me for that.'</p>

  <p>'No, I suppose it won't,' I admitted. 'And you seem to take Percy's claim
  to this estate quite seriously.'</p>

  <p>'It is impossible to do otherwise,' said he. 'It may be impossible to
  prove it, even if an opportunity should arise. But it is a real claim, and
  what little chance he has ought to be preserved. It mustn't be lost by our
  negligence.'</p>

  <p>I was not keen on the expedition, but I knew what Winifred's sentiments
  would have been, and loyalty to her bade me assent, though in my own mind, I
  felt it to be a fruitless and somewhat foolish errand. Accordingly I agreed
  to form one of the party on the day after the morrow, a decision which
  Thorndyke received with more satisfaction than the occasion seemed to
  warrant.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; BEAUCHAMP BLAKE</h2>

  <p class="first">'Can there be any more pleasant place of human habitation
  than an English country town?' I asked myself the question as I strolled
  round the market square of the little town of Aylesbury, gazing about me with
  a Londoner's pleasure in the restful, old-world aspect of the place I had
  still more than half an hour to wait, but I had no feeling of impatience. I
  could spend that time agreeably enough, sauntering around, wrapped in
  pleasurable idleness provocative of reflection, looking at the handsome
  market-place with its clock-tower and its statues immortalising in bronze the
  worthies of more stirring times, or at the carriers' carts that rested
  unhorsed in the square and told of villages and hamlets nestling amidst their
  trees but a few miles away down the leafy lanes.</p>

  <p>Presently my leisurely perambulations brought me opposite a shop of more
  than common smartness, and here&mdash;perhaps because the crowd of market
  folk was a little more dense&mdash;I paused and gazed somewhat absently into
  the window. I have no idea why I looked into that particular shop window. The
  wares exposed in it&mdash;ladies' hats&mdash;have no special attraction to
  the masculine eye&mdash;at least in the state in which they are presented by
  the milliner, bereft of the principal ornament which should be found
  underneath them. Nevertheless, I was not the only male observer. Another man
  had stopped and stood, nearer to the window than I, inspecting the
  gaily-flowered and feathered headgear with undeniable interest.</p>

  <p>The incongruity of this eager scrutiny of things so characteristically
  feminine struck me with amused curiosity, and I watched the man with a
  half-suppressed smile. He was a small, slight man, neatly dressed in a suit
  of tweeds and a tweed hat, and the trouser-clips at his ankles suggested that
  he had cycled in from the country. I could not see his face, as I was
  standing nearly behind him, but apparently he became aware, after a time, of
  my presence&mdash;perhaps he saw my reflection in the window&mdash;and of the
  fact that I was observing him somewhat curiously, for he turned away with
  some suddenness, glancing up at me as he passed and then half pausing to look
  at me again before he bustled away and disappeared up an alley.</p>

  <p>There was something very odd in that second look. The first had been a
  mere casual glance, but the second&mdash;quick, searching, even
  startled&mdash;suggested recognition, and something more than recognition.
  What could it have been? And who could he be? The face&mdash;a clean-shaved,
  thin, sallow face, not very young, seen only for a moment, left a clear
  mental image that still remained. And as I visualised it afresh I was
  conscious of a faint sense of familiarity. I had seen this man before. Where
  had I seen him; and who was he? And why did he look at me with that singular
  expression?</p>

  <p>I stood where he had left me, cudgelling my brains for an answer to these
  questions. And even as I stood there, a cyclist passed swiftly across the end
  of the square and disappeared in the direction of the London Road. He was too
  far off for his face to be clearly recognisable: but he was a small man, he
  wore a tweed suit and hat, and trouser-clips, and I had no doubt that he was
  the same man.</p>

  <p>Now who was he? The more I recalled the face, the more convinced I was
  that I had seen it before. But the identity of its owner eluded me
  completely. I couldn't place the fellow at all. Probably it didn't matter in
  the least who he was. But still it was exasperating to be baffled in this
  way. Unconsciously, I turned and stared into the milliner's window. And then,
  in a flash it came. The middle of the window was occupied by an enormous
  hat&mdash;a huge, bloated, fungous structure overrun with counterfeit
  vegetation and bristling with feathers; such a hat as might have adorned the
  cranium of a Hottentot queen. A glance at that grisly head-dress supplied the
  missing link in the chain of association. The face that had looked into mine
  was the face of the woman who had shadowed Winifred and me from Hampstead;
  who had lured her to the empty house, and had there revealed herself as a man
  in disguise. In short, this was the murderer of poor Drayton, and the
  would-be murderer of Winifred!</p>

  <p>And I had held this wretch in the hollow of my hand and I had let him go!
  It was an infuriating thought. If my quickness of observation had only been
  equal to his, I should have had him by now safely under lock and key. No
  wonder he had looked startled. But he must have a remarkably good memory for
  faces to have recognised me in that instantaneous glance. For he had seen me
  only once&mdash;at the inquest at Hampstead&mdash;and then but for a moment.
  Unless he had got a glimpse of me at the empty house, or&mdash;which seemed
  more probable&mdash;had shadowed and watched me when I had been acting as
  Winifred's escort. At any rate he knew me, better than I knew him, and had
  managed very adroitly to slip through my fingers.</p>

  <p>But what on earth was he doing at Aylesbury? Was it possible that he lived
  in this neighbourhood? If so, a description given to the police might even
  yet secure his arrest. I was turning over this possibility when the chiming
  of a clock recalled my appointment. I glanced up at the dial on the
  clock-tower and had just noted that the appointed hour had struck when I
  observed Thorndyke ascending the steps to the platform at the base. This was
  our rendezvous, and I forthwith hurried across the cobbled square and
  presented myself, bursting with my news and discharging them in a volley as
  soon as I arrived.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke was deeply interested, but yet I found in his manner something
  slightly disappointing. He was an impassive man, difficult to surprise or
  move to any outward manifestation of emotion. Still, knowing this, I was a
  little chilled by the almost academic view that he took of the incident, and
  especially by his firm rejection of my plan for invoking the aid of the
  police.</p>

  <p>'It sounds tempting,' he admitted, 'to swoop down on this man and put an
  end forthwith to all our dangers and complications, but it would be a bad
  move. Quite probably the police would decline to take any action. And then
  what sort of description could you give them? For the purposes of a search it
  is far too general, and a change of clothing would make it entirely
  inapplicable. And we must admit the possibility of your being mistaken. And
  finally, if we gave this information, we should almost certainly lose one
  man&mdash;whom none of us has ever seen, but who is probably the principal.
  We should have let the cat out of the bag, and all our carefully-laid plans
  would come to nought.'</p>

  <p>'I didn't know that we had any carefully-laid plans,' said I.</p>

  <p>'You know that we are engaged in investigating a murder; that our aim is
  to secure the two or more murderers and to elucidate the causes and
  circumstances of the crime, and that we have accumulated a certain number of
  data to that end.'</p>

  <p>'You have,' I objected. 'I have practically no data at all. May I ask if
  you know who this sallow-faced little devil is?'</p>

  <p>'I have a strong suspicion,' he replied. 'But suspicion isn't quite what
  one wants to take into a court of law. I want to verify my suspicions and
  turn them into conclusive evidence. So that when I play my card it shall be a
  trump card.'</p>

  <p>To this I had no reply to make. I knew Thorndyke's methods. For years I
  had acted as his leading counsel, and always when I had gone into court I had
  taken with me a case complete to the last detail. Now, for the first time, I
  was realising the amount of patience and self-restraint that went to the
  making of a case of unassailable conclusiveness, and I found myself with
  difficulty overcoming the temptation to make a premature move.</p>

  <p>While we had been talking, we had been making our way at an easy pace out
  of the town on to the London Road, and now Thorndyke, with the one-inch
  ordnance map in his hand, indicated our route.</p>

  <p>'Beauchamp Blake,' said he, 'lies just off the Lower Icknield Way, on the
  left of the London Road. But there is no need for us to take the shortest
  way. The by-road through Stoke Mandeville looks more entertaining than the
  main road, and we can pick up the Lower Icknield Way at the crossroads below
  the village.'</p>

  <p>Our route being thus settled, we set forth, turning off presently into the
  quiet, shady by-road. And as we swung along between the thinning hedgerows,
  with the majestic elms&mdash;now sprinkled with yellow&mdash;towering above
  us and casting athwart the road streaks of cool shadow, we chatted
  sporadically with long intervals of silence, for we were Londoners on holiday
  to whom the beauty of this fair countryside was reinforced by a certain
  pleasant strangeness.</p>

  <p>'I have wondered from time to time,' I said, after one of the long pauses,
  'what can be the significance&mdash;if it has any&mdash;of that blue-dyed
  hair that you extracted from Winifred's locket' (I had confided to Thorndyke
  the new relations that had grown up between our fair client and me).</p>

  <p>'Ah,' he replied. 'A very interesting problem, Anstey.'</p>

  <p>'I have also wondered what made you take the hair out of the locket to
  examine it under the microscope.'</p>

  <p>'The answer to that question is perfectly simple,' said he. 'I took it out
  to see if it was blue. In the mass the hair looked black.'</p>

  <p>'But do I understand that you thought it might be blue?'</p>

  <p>'I expected to find it blue. The examination was a measure of
  verification.'</p>

  <p>'But why, in the name of Fortune, should you expect to find blue hair in a
  locket? I had no idea that hair ever was dyed blue&mdash;except,' I added
  with a sudden flash of recollection, 'in the case of ancient Egyptian wigs,
  and I had an idea that they were not hair at all.'</p>

  <p>'Some of them, I believe, were not. However, this was not ancient Egyptian
  hair. It was modern.'</p>

  <p>'Then, will you tell me what it was that made you expect to find the hair
  in the locket dyed blue?'</p>

  <p>'The expectation,' he replied, 'arose out of an inspection of the locket
  itself.'</p>

  <p>'Do you mean those mysterious and obscure Biblical references engraved
  inside?'</p>

  <p>'No; I mean the external characters, the peculiar construction, the motto
  engraved on the front, and the hallmark on the back.'</p>

  <p>'But what,' I asked, 'was the connection between those external characters
  and this most extraordinary peculiarity of the hair inside?'</p>

  <p>He looked at me with the exasperating smile that I knew so well (and was,
  in fact, expecting).</p>

  <p>'Now, you know, Anstey,' said he, 'you are trying to pump me; to suck my
  brains instead of using your own. I am not going to encourage you in any such
  mental indolence. The proper satisfaction of a discovery is in having made it
  yourself. You have seen and handled the locket, you have heard my comments on
  it, and you have access to it for further examination. Try to recall what it
  is like, and if necessary, examine it afresh. Consider its peculiarities one
  by one and then in relation to one another. If you do this attentively and
  thoughtfully you will find that those peculiarities will yield some most
  curious and interesting suggestions, including the suggestion that the hair
  inside is probably blue.'</p>

  <p>'I shan't find anything of the kind, you old devil,' I exclaimed
  wrathfully, 'and you know perfectly well that I shan't. Still, I will take an
  early opportunity to put the "little Sphinx" under cross-examination.'</p>

  <p>While we had been talking we had passed through the village of Stoke
  Mandeville, and we now arrived at the crossroads, where we turned to the left
  into the ancient Icknield Way.</p>

  <p>'A mile and a half farther on,' said Thorndyke, again consulting the map,
  'we cross the London Road. Then we turn out of the Icknield Way into this
  lane, leaving Weston Turville on our left. I note there is an inn opposite
  the gates of Beauchamp Blake. Does that topographical feature interest
  you?'</p>

  <p>'I think,' said I, 'that after another couple of miles, we shall be ready
  for what the British workman calls a "breaver." But it is probably only a
  wayside beerhouse.'</p>

  <p>Another half-hour's walking brought us to the London Road, crossing which
  we followed a side road&mdash;apparently part of the Icknield Way&mdash;which
  skirted the lake-like reservoir and presently gave off as a branch a
  pleasant, elm-bordered lane on the right-hand side of which was a tall oak
  paling.</p>

  <p>'This,' said Thorndyke, whose stature enabled him easily to look over the
  fence, 'is the little park of Beauchamp Blake. I don't see the house, but I
  see the roof of a gatekeeper's lodge. And here is the inn.'</p>

  <p>A turn of the lane had brought into view a gatekeeper's lodge by the main
  gates of the park, and nearly opposite, the looked-for hostelry. And a very
  remarkable-looking hostelry it was, considering its secluded position; an
  antique, half-timbered house with a high, crinkly roof in which was a row of
  dormer windows, and a larger, overhanging gabled bay supported below by an
  immense carved corner-post. But the most singular feature of the house was
  the sign, which swung at the top of a tall post by a horse-trough in the
  little forecourt, on which was the head of a gentleman wearing a crown and a
  full-bottomed wig, apparently suspended in mid-air over a brown stone
  pitcher.</p>

  <p>'It seems to me,' said I, as we approached the inn, 'that the sign needs
  an explanatory inscription. The association of a king and a brown jug may be
  natural enough, but it is unusual as an inn-sign.'</p>

  <p>'Now, Anstey,' Thorndyke exclaimed protestingly, 'don't tell me that that
  ancient joke has missed its mark on your superlative intellect. The
  inscription on the parlour window tells us that the sign is the King's Head,
  and the pitcher under that portrait explains that the king is James the
  Second or Third&mdash;His Majesty over the water. This is evidently a
  Jacobite house. Does the sedition shock you? Or shall we enter and refresh?
  If the landlord's ale is as old as his politics we ought to find quite
  exceptional entertainment within, and perhaps pick up a trifle of local
  gossip that may interest us.'</p>

  <p>I assented readily, secretly denouncing my slowness in the 'uptake'.
  Thorndyke's explanations were always so ridiculously simple&mdash;when you
  had heard them.</p>

  <p>The landlord, who looked like a retired butler, received us with
  old-fashioned deference and inducted us into the parlour, drawing a couple of
  Wycombe armchairs up to the table.</p>

  <p>'What can I do for you, gentlemen?' he inquired.</p>

  <p>'Well, what can you do for us?' asked Thorndyke. 'Is it to be bread and
  cheese and beer?'</p>

  <p>'I can let you have a cold fowl and a cut of boiled bacon,' said the
  landlord with the air of one who lays down the ace of trumps.</p>

  <p>'Can you really!' exclaimed Thorndyke. 'That is a repast fit for a
  king&mdash;even for the king over the water.'</p>

  <p>The landlord smiled slyly. 'Ah, you're alluding to my old sign, sir,' said
  he. 'T'wouldn't have done to have had him swingin' up there time back. Some
  others would have been swingin' too. In those days he used to hang in this
  room over the fireplace, only there was a portrait of King George fixed over
  him with concealed hinges. When strangers came to the house there was King
  George&mdash;God bless him!&mdash;the same as the sign that used to hang
  outside; but when the villagers or the people from the Hall opposite sat in
  the room, then George was swung back on his hinges to bring James into view
  and a pitcher of water was put on the table to drink the toasts over. This
  was a thriving house in those days. They say that Percival Blake&mdash;he was
  the last of the old family and a rare plotter by all accounts&mdash;used to
  meet some of his political cronies in this very room, and I've no doubt a lot
  of business was plotted here that never came to anything.'</p>

  <p>'Who has the place now?' asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>'The present squire is Mr Arthur Blake, and a queerish sort of squire he
  is.'</p>

  <p>'In what way queer?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'Well, you see, sir, he's a Colonial&mdash;lived in Australia all his
  life, I understand. And he looks it&mdash;a big, roughish-looking man, and
  very short spoken. But he can ride, I'll say that for him. There isn't a
  better horseman in the county. Mounts from the off-side, too. I suppose
  that's their way out there, though it don't suit our rule of the road.'</p>

  <p>As the landlord gave these particulars, he proceeded, with swift
  dexterity, to lay the table and furnish it with the materials for the feast,
  aided and abetted by an unseen female who lurked in the background. When he
  had put the final touch with a 'foam-crowned jug of nut-brown,' he showed a
  tendency to withdraw and leave us to our meal; but Thorndyke was in a
  conversational mood and induced him, without difficulty, to fetch another
  tumbler and proceed with his output of local lore.</p>

  <p>'Is it true that the place is going to be sold?' Thorndyke inquired.</p>

  <p>'So they say,' replied the landlord. 'And the best thing the squire could
  do if the lawyers will let him. The place is no good to him.'</p>

  <p>'Why not?'</p>

  <p>'Well, sir, he's a bachelor, and like to remain one it seems. Then he's a
  stranger to the place and don't appear to take to English ways. He keeps no
  company and he makes no visits; he don't know any of his neighbours and
  doesn't seem to want to. He has only kept on one or two of the servants, and
  he lives with his man&mdash;foreign-looking chap named Meyer&mdash;in a
  corner of the house and never uses the rest. He'd be more comfortable in a
  little farm house.'</p>

  <p>'And how does he spend his time?' asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>'I don't know, sir,' was the answer. 'Mostly loafing about, I should say.
  He takes photographs, I hear; quite clever at it, too, it seems. And he goes
  out for a ride every afternoon&mdash;you'll see him come out of the gate at
  three o'clock almost to the minute&mdash;and sometimes he goes out in the
  morning, too.'</p>

  <p>'And as to visitors? Are strangers allowed to look over the house?'</p>

  <p>'No, sir. The squire won't have any strangers about the place at all. I
  fancy what made him so particular was a burglary that occurred there about a
  couple of years ago. Not that there was much in it, for they got all the
  things back and they caught the burglar the very next day.'</p>

  <p>'That was smart work,' I remarked.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' our friend agreed, 'they did the thief very neatly. It was a
  one-man job and the burglar seems to have been a downy bird, for he worked in
  gloves so that he shouldn't leave any marks behind. But he took those gloves
  off a bit too soon, for, when they heard him making off and let the dogs
  loose, he had to do a bolt, and he dropped one of the things in the
  park&mdash;a silver salver it was, I think&mdash;and the police found it the
  next morning and found some finger-marks on it. They wanted to take the
  salver up to Scotland Yard to have it examined, but the squire wouldn't have
  that. He took a photograph of the fingermarks and gave it to the police, and
  they took it up to Scotland Yard, and the people there were able to tell them
  at once whose fingermarks they were, and they got the burglar that very
  evening with all the stolen goods in his possession. Wonderful smart, I call
  it.'</p>

  <p>'Do you think,' Thorndyke asked, 'that we should be able to get a look at
  the house? Just the outside, I mean?'</p>

  <p>'I'll see what can be done, sir,' the landlord replied 'I'll have a few
  words with the lodge-keeper. I was butler to the last squire but one, so they
  know me pretty well. I'll just run across while you are finishing your lunch.
  But you'd better wait until the squire has gone out, because, if he sees you
  on the drive, like as not he'll order you out, and that wouldn't be pleasant
  for gentlemen like you.'</p>

  <p>'I think we'll take the risk,' said Thorndyke. 'If he tells us to go, we
  can go, but I don't like sneaking in behind his back.'</p>

  <p>'No, sir, perhaps you are right,' the landlord agreed, a little dubiously,
  and departed on his errand, leaving us to finish our lunch&mdash;which, in
  fact, we had practically done already.</p>

  <p>In this long conversation I had taken no part. But I had been an
  interested listener. Not that I cared two straws for the small beer that our
  host had been retailing. What had interested, and a good deal puzzled me was
  Thorndyke's amazing inquisitiveness respecting the private and domestic
  affairs of a man whom neither of us knew and with whom we really had no
  concern. For the question of the succession to the property was a purely
  legal one&mdash;and pretty shadowy at that&mdash;on which the personal
  qualities and habits of the present tenant had no bearing whatever. And yet
  my experience of Thorndyke told me that he certainly had not been asking
  these trivial and impertinent questions without some reasonable motive. No
  man was less inquisitive about things that did not concern him.</p>

  <p>But the discrepancy between his character and his conduct did not end
  here. As soon as the landlord had gone and we had filled and lit our pipes,
  he began to explore his waistcoat pockets and presently produced therefrom
  Polton's reproduction of Mr Halliburton's ridiculous mascot, which he laid on
  the table and regarded fondly.</p>

  <p>'Do you usually carry that thing in your pocket, Thorndyke?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'Not usually,' he replied, 'but this is a special occasion. We are on
  holiday, and moreover, we are seeking our fortune, or at least, hoping that
  something may turn up.'</p>

  <p>'Are we?' I said. 'I am not conscious of any such hope, and I don't know
  what you expect.'</p>

  <p>'Neither do I,' he replied. 'But I feel in an optimistic mood. Perhaps it
  is the beer,' and with this he picked up the mascot, and opening the split
  gold ring with a knife-blade, attached it to his watch-chain, closing the
  ring with a squeeze of his finger and thumb.</p>

  <p>It was a singular proceeding. What made it especially so was Thorndyke's
  openly-expressed contempt of the superstition which finds expression in the
  use of charms, mascots and other fetishistic objects and practices. However,
  we were on holiday, as he had said, and perhaps it was admissible to mark the
  occasion by playing the fool a little.</p>

  <p>In a few minutes the landlord returned and announced that he had secured
  the consent of the lodge-keeper to our making an inspection of the house,
  with the proviso that we were not to go more than a couple of hundred yards
  down the drive. 'I'll just step across with you,' he added, 'so that he can
  see that you are the right parties.'</p>

  <p>Accordingly, when we had paid the modest reckoning, we picked up our hats
  and sticks and as our host held open the parlour door, we passed out into the
  courtyard, glancing up with renewed interest at the historic sign which
  creaked in the breeze. Crossing the road, we passed through the wicket of the
  closed gate, under the detached observation of the lodge-keeper; and here our
  host wished us adieu and returned to the inn.</p>

  <p>A short walk down the drive brought us to a turn of the road where we came
  in sight of the house across a stretch of meadows in which a small herd of
  cows made spots of vivid colour. It was not a large mansion, but what it
  lacked in size it made up for in character and interest. The two parts were
  clearly distinct, the newer portion being a Jacobean brick building with
  stone dressings and quaint corbie-step gables, while the older part&mdash;not
  later than the sixteenth century&mdash;was a comparatively low structure
  showing massive timbers with pargetted plaster fillings, a high roof with
  wide-spreading eaves and a long row of picturesque dormer windows and large,
  clustered chimneys.</p>

  <p>'It is a grand old house,' I said. 'What a pity it is that Blake is such a
  curmudgeon. The inside ought to be even more interesting than the
  outside.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' Thorndyke agreed, 'it is a splendid specimen of domestic
  architecture, and absolutely thrown away, if our host was not exaggerating.
  One could wish for a more appreciative tenant&mdash;such as our young friend
  Percy, for instance.'</p>

  <p>I glanced at Thorndyke, surprised, not for the first time, at the way in
  which he tended to harp on this very unresonant string. To me, Percy's claim
  to this estate was simply a romantic instance of the might-have-been, and
  none too clear at that. His chance of ever inheriting Beauchamp Blake was a
  wild dream that I found myself unable to take seriously. But this was
  apparently not Thorndyke's view, for it was evident that he had considered
  the matter worth inquiring into, and his last words showed that it still
  hovered in his mind. I was on the point of reopening the discussion when two
  men appeared round the corner of the house, each leading a saddled horse.
  Opposite the main doorway they halted and one of them proceeded to
  mount&mdash;from the off-side, as I noticed. Then they apparently became
  aware of our presence, for they both looked in our direction; indeed they
  continued to stare at us with extraordinary attention, and by their movements
  appeared to be discussing us anxiously.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke chuckled softly. 'There must be something uncommonly suspicious
  in your appearance, Anstey,' he remarked. 'They seem to be in a deuce of a
  twitter about you.'</p>

  <p>'Why my appearance?' I demanded. 'They are looking at us both. In fact I
  think it is you who are the real object of suspicion. I expect they think you
  have come back for that silver plate.'</p>

  <p>As we spoke, the discussion came to an end. The one man remained, holding
  his horse and still looking at us, while the other turned and advanced up the
  drive at a brisk trot, sitting his mount with that unconscious ease that
  distinguishes the lifelong, habitual equestrian. As he approached, he looked
  at us inquisitively and with undissembled disapproval, but seemed as if he
  were going to pass without further notice. Suddenly, however, his attention
  became more intense. He slowed down to a walk, and as he drew near to us he
  pulled up and dismounted. And again I noticed that he dismounted from the
  off-side.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; THE SQUIRE AND THE SLEUTH-HOUND</h2>

  <p class="first">As Mr Blake approached with the evident intention of
  addressing us, it was not unnatural that I should look at him with some
  interest. Not that such interest was in any way justified by his appearance,
  which was quite commonplace. He was a tall man, strongly built, and
  apparently active and muscular. His features were somewhat coarse, but his
  expression was resolute and energetic, though not suggestive of more than
  average intelligence. But at the moment, as he bore down on us, leading his
  horse by the bridle-rein, with his eyes fixed on Thorndyke's face, suspicion
  and a certain dim suggestion of surprise were what I principally gathered
  from his countenance.</p>

  <p>'May I ask what your business is?' he demanded somewhat brusquely, but not
  rudely, addressing Thorndyke and looking at him with something more than
  common attention.</p>

  <p>'We really haven't any business at all,' my colleague replied. 'We were
  walking through the district and thought we should like to have a glance at
  your very picturesque and interesting house. That is all.'</p>

  <p>'Is there anything in particular that you want to know about the house?'
  Mr Blake asked, still addressing Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>'No,' the latter replied. 'Our interest in the place is merely
  antiquarian, and not very profound at that.'</p>

  <p>'I see,' said Mr Blake. He appeared to reflect for a few moments and
  seemed to be on the point of moving away when he stopped suddenly and a quick
  change passed over his face. At the same moment I noticed that his eyes were
  fixed intently on Thorndyke's ridiculous mascot.</p>

  <p>'I take it,' said he,' that you had the lodge-keeper's permission to come
  inside the gates?'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' Thorndyke replied. 'He gave us permission&mdash;through the
  inn-keeper, who asked him&mdash;to come in far enough to see the house. As
  far as we have come, in fact.'</p>

  <p>Mr Blake nodded, and again his eyes wandered to the object attached to
  Thorndyke's watch-chain.</p>

  <p>'You are looking at my mascot,' the latter said genially. 'It is a curious
  thing, isn't it?'</p>

  <p>'Very,' Blake agreed gruffly. 'What is it?'</p>

  <p>Thorndyke pulled the soft wire ring open, and detaching it from his chain,
  handed the little object to the other, who examined it curiously and
  remarked:</p>

  <p>'It seems to be made out of a bone.'</p>

  <p>'Yes; the bone of a porcupine ant-eater.'</p>

  <p>'Ha. You got it somewhere abroad. I suppose?'</p>

  <p>'No; replied Thorndyke. 'I found it in London, and, of course, it isn't
  really mine. It belongs to a man named Halliburton. But I don't happen to
  have his address at the moment, so I can't return it.'</p>

  <p>Mr Blake listened to this explanation with a sort of puzzled frown,
  wondering, perhaps, at my colleague's uncalled-for expansiveness to an utter
  stranger. But his wonder was nothing to mine, as I heard the usually
  secretive Thorndyke babbling in this garrulously confidential fashion.</p>

  <p>When he had examined the mascot, Mr Blake handed it back to Thorndyke with
  an inarticulate grunt, and as my colleague hooked the ring on his
  watch-chain, he turned away, walked round his horse to the off-side, mounted
  lightly to the saddle and started the horse forward at a trot. As he
  disappeared round a bend of the tree-bordered road, I glanced at Thorndyke,
  who was once more gazing calmly at the house.</p>

  <p>'Mine host was right; I observed. 'Squire Blake is a pretty considerable
  boor.'</p>

  <p>'His manners are certainly not engaging,' Thorndyke agreed.</p>

  <p>'I didn't notice that he had any manners,' said I, 'and it seemed to me
  that you were most unnecessarily civil, not to say confidential.'</p>

  <p>'Well, you know,' he replied, 'we are on his premises, and not only
  uninvited, but contrary to his expressed wishes. We could hardly be otherwise
  than civil. And after all, he didn't eject us. But I suppose we may as well
  retire now.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' I agreed, 'he is probably waiting to see us off his confounded
  land, and possibly speaking his mind to the lodge-keeper.'</p>

  <p>Both these surmises appeared to be correct, for when we came round the
  clump of trees at the turn of the road, I saw the squire in earnest
  conversation with the keeper, who was standing at attention, holding the gate
  open, and, I thought, looking somewhat abashed. We passed out through the
  wicket, which was still unfastened, but though the lodge-keeper looked at us
  attentively, and even a little curiously, Blake gave no sign of being aware
  of our existence.</p>

  <p>'Well,' said I, 'he is an unmannerly hog. But he has one redeeming
  feature. He is a man of taste. He did admire you, Thorndyke. While you were
  talking he couldn't keep his eyes off you.'</p>

  <p>'Possibly he was trying to memorise my features in case I should turn out
  to be a swell cracksman.'</p>

  <p>I laughed at the idea of even such a barbarian as this mistaking my
  distinguished-looking colleague for a member of the swell mob. But it was not
  impossible. And certainly the squire had scrutinised my friend's features
  with an intensity that nothing but suspicion could justify.</p>

  <p>'Perhaps,' said I, 'he suffers from an obsession on the subject of
  burglars. Our host's remarks seemed to suggest something of the kind. I
  wonder what he was saying to the lodge-keeper. It looked to me as if the
  custodian was receiving a slight dressing-down on our account.'</p>

  <p>'Probably he was,' replied Thorndyke. 'But I think that, if my learned
  friend had happened to be furnished with eyes in the back of his
  head&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'As my learned senior appears to be,' I interjected.</p>

  <p>'&mdash;he would already have formed a more definite opinion as to what
  took place. In the absence of the retrocephalic arrangement, I suggest that
  we slip through this opening in the hedge and sit down under the bank.'</p>

  <p>Stooping to avoid the thick upper foliage, he dived through the opening
  and I followed, with no small curiosity as to what it was that my
  extraordinarily observant colleague had seen. Presumably some one was
  following us, and if so, as the opening occurred at a sharp bend of the road,
  our disappearance would have been unobserved.</p>

  <p>'It is my belief, Thorndyke,' I said, as we sat down under the bank, 'that
  your optical arrangements are like those of the giraffe. I believe you can
  see all round the horizon at once.'</p>

  <p>Thorndyke laughed softly. 'The human field of vision, Anstey,' said he,
  'as measured by the perimeter, is well over a hundred and eighty degrees. It
  doesn't take much lateral movement of the head to convert it into three
  hundred and sixty. The really important factor is not optical but mental.
  That earnest conversation with the gatekeeper suggested a possibility, though
  a rather remote one. Ordinary human eyesight, used with the necessary
  attention, was quite sufficient to show that the improbable had happened, as
  it often does. Hush! Look through that chink in the hedge.'</p>

  <p>As he concluded in a whisper, rapid footfalls became audible. Nearer and
  nearer they approached, and then, through my spy-hole, I saw a man in cord
  breeches and leggings and a velveteen coat walk swiftly past. The gatekeeper
  had been dressed thus, and presumably the man was he, though I had not
  observed him closely enough to be able to recognise him with certainty.</p>

  <p>'Now, why is he following us?' I asked, taking the identity for
  granted.</p>

  <p>'We mustn't assume that he is following us at all with a definite intent,
  though I suspect he is. But he may be merely going the same way. He may have
  business in Wendover.'</p>

  <p>'It would be rather amusing to dodge him once or twice and see what his
  game is,' I said with the schoolboy instinct that lingers on, if
  atavistically, in the adult male.</p>

  <p>'It would be highly amusing,' Thorndyke agreed, 'but it wouldn't serve our
  purpose, which is to ascertain his purpose and keep our knowledge to
  ourselves. We had better move on now if he is out of sight.'</p>

  <p>He was out of sight, having reached and turned down the Tring Road. We
  followed at a sharp walk, and as we came out into the Tring Road, behold him
  standing in the footway a couple of hundred yards towards Wendover, looking
  about him with a rather foolish air of bewilderment. As soon as he saw us, he
  lifted his foot to the bank and proceeded to attend to his bootlace.</p>

  <p>'We won't notice him,' said Thorndyke. 'He is evidently an artless soul
  and probably believes that he has not been recognised. Let us encourage that
  eminently desirable belief.'</p>

  <p>We passed him with an almost aggressive appearance of unconsciousness on
  both sides, and pursued our way along the undulating road.</p>

  <p>'I don't think there is much doubt now that he is following us,' said I,
  'and the question is, why is he doing it?'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Thorndyke, 'that is the question. He may have had instructions
  to see us safely out of the district, or he may have had further
  instructions. We shall see when we get to the station. Meanwhile I am tempted
  to try a new invention of Polton's. It is slightly fantastic, but he made me
  promise to carry it in my pocket and try it when I had a chance. Now, here is
  the chance, and here is the instrument.'</p>

  <p>He took from his pocket a leather case from which he extracted a rather
  solidly-made pair of spectacles. 'You see,' he said, 'Polton has long had the
  idea that I ought to be provided with some means of observing what is going
  on behind me, and he has devised this apparatus for the purpose. Like all
  Polton's inventions, it is quite simple and practicable. As you see, it
  consists of a rigid spectacle-frame fitted with dummy glasses&mdash;clear,
  plain glass&mdash;at the outer edge of which is fixed a little disc of
  speculum-metal worked to an optically true plane surface and set at a minute
  angle to the glass. As the disc is quite close to the eye, it enables the
  wearer, by the very slightest turn of the head, to get a clear view directly
  behind him. Would you like to try it?'</p>

  <p>I took the spectacles from him and put them on, and was amazed at their
  efficiency. Although the discs were hardly bigger than split peas, they gave
  me a perfectly clear view along the road behind us&mdash;as if I had been
  looking through a small, round hole&mdash;and this with a scarcely
  appreciable turn of the head. Viewed from behind, I must have appeared to be
  looking straight before me.</p>

  <p>'But,' I exclaimed, 'it seems a most practical device, and I shall insist
  on Polton making me a pair.'</p>

  <p>'That will please him,' said Thorndyke, and he added, reflectively 'if
  only there were a few thousand more Poltons&mdash;men who found their
  satisfaction in being useful and giving pleasure to their fellows&mdash;what
  a delightful place this world would be!'</p>

  <p>I continued to wear the magic spectacles all the way to Wendover, finding
  a childish pleasure in watching the unconscious gatekeeper who was dogging
  our footsteps and taking ludicrous precautions to keep&mdash;as he
  thought&mdash;out of sight. Only as we descended the long hill into the
  beautiful little town did I take them off, the better to enjoy the charm of
  the picturesque approach with its row of thatched cottages and the modest
  clock-turret, standing up against the background of the wooded heights that
  soared above Ellesborough. At the station we had the good fortune to find a
  train due and already signalled, but we delayed taking our tickets until our
  follower arrived, which he did, in evident haste, a couple of minutes later,
  being, no doubt, acquainted with the times of the trains. As soon as he
  appeared, Thorndyke sauntered to the booking-office wicket and gave him time
  to approach before demanding in clear, audible tones, two firsts to
  Marylebone. The gatekeeper followed, and thrusting his head and shoulders
  deep into the opening, as if he were about to crawl through, made his demand
  in a muffled undertone.</p>

  <p>'We need not trouble ourselves about him any more,' said Thorndyke, 'until
  we get to London. Then we shall know whether he is or is not trying to shadow
  us.'</p>

  <p>When we had settled ourselves in an empty compartment and began to charge
  our pipes as the train moved off, I returned to the question of our
  tactics.</p>

  <p>'What do you propose to do, Thorndyke, if this fellow tries to follow us
  home? Shall we let him run us to earth, or shall we lose him?'</p>

  <p>'I see no reason why we should make a secret of who we are and where we
  live. That is apparently what Blake wants to know&mdash;that is, if this man
  is really shadowing us.'</p>

  <p>'But,' I urged, 'isn't it generally wiser to withhold information until
  you know what use is going to be made of it?'</p>

  <p>'As a rule, it is,' he admitted. 'But it may happen that the use made of
  information by one party may be highly illuminating to the other. We may
  assume that Blake wants to know who we are simply because he suffers from an
  obsession of suspicion and thinks that we were in his grounds for some
  unlawful purpose. But he may have some other object, and if he has, I should
  like to know what it is; and the best way to find out is to let him have our
  names and address.'</p>

  <p>To this I assented, though I was a little mystified. The man Blake was no
  concern of ours, and it did not seem to matter in the least what suspicions
  of us had got into his thick head. However Thorndyke probably knew his own
  business&mdash;and meanwhile the presence of this sleuth-hound provided an
  element of comedy of which I was far from unappreciative, and which my sedate
  colleague enjoyed without disguise.</p>

  <p>When we alighted at Marylebone, we walked quickly to the barrier, but
  having passed through, we sauntered slowly to the main exit.</p>

  <p>'Do you think Polton's spectacles would be very conspicuous?' I asked.</p>

  <p>My colleague smiled indulgently. 'The new toy has caught on,' said he,
  'and it would be undeniably useful at the present moment. No, put the
  spectacles on. The discs are hardly noticeable to a casual observer.'</p>

  <p>Accordingly I slipped the appliance on as we strolled out into the
  Marylebone Road and was able, almost immediately, to report progress.</p>

  <p>'He is watching us from the exit. Which way are we going?'</p>

  <p>'I think,' replied Thorndyke, 'as he is a country cousin, we will make
  things easy for him and give him a little exercise after the confinement of
  the train. The Euston Road route is less crowded than Oxford Street.'</p>

  <p>We turned eastward and started at an easy pace along the Marylebone Road
  and Euston Road, keeping on the less-frequented side of the street. I was a
  little self-conscious in regard to the spectacles, but apparently no one
  noticed them; and by their aid I was able to watch with astonishing ease our
  artless follower and to amuse myself by noting his conflicting anxieties to
  keep us in view and himself out of sight. We turned down Woburn Place,
  crossed Queen Square to Great Ormond Street and proceeding by Lamb's-Conduit
  Street, Red Lion Street, Great Turnstile, Lincoln's Inn, and Chancery Lane,
  crossed Fleet Street to Middle Temple Lane. Here we slowed down, lest the
  sleuth-hound should lose us, and as we were now in our own neighbourhood, I
  removed the spectacles and restored them to their owner.</p>

  <p>At the entrance to Pump Court we separated, Thorndyke proceeding at a
  leisurely pace towards Crown Office Row while I hurried through the court;
  and having halted in the Cloisters to make sure that the sleuth was not
  pursuing me, I darted through Fig-Tree Court and across King's Bench Walk to
  our chambers, where I found Polton laying a sort of hybrid tea and
  supper.</p>

  <p>To our trusty assistant I rapidly communicated the state of affairs
  (including the triumphant success of the magic spectacles, at which his face
  became a positive labyrinth of ecstatic wrinkles); and having provided
  ourselves with field-glasses, we stationed ourselves at the laboratory
  window, from whence we had the gratification of watching Thorndyke emerge
  majestically from Crown Office Row, followed shortly by the man in the
  velveteen coat, whose efforts to make himself invisible brought Polton to the
  verge of apoplexy.</p>

  <p>'Hadn't I better follow him and see where he goes to, sir?' the latter
  suggested.</p>

  <p>The suggestion was put to Thorndyke when he entered, but was rejected.</p>

  <p>'I don't think we want to know where he goes from here,' said he. 'But
  still, seeing that he has come so far, it might be kind of you, Polton, to go
  down and give him a chance of obtaining any information that he wants.'</p>

  <p>Polton needed no second bidding. Clapping on his hat, he set forth
  gleefully down the stairs. But in a minute or two he was back again, somewhat
  crestfallen.</p>

  <p>'It's no go, sir,' he reported. 'I found him copying the names on the
  door-post in the entry, and I think he must have got them all down, for when
  he saw me, he was off like a lamplighter.'</p>

  <p>Thorndyke chuckled. 'And to think,' said he, 'that our friend, the squire,
  could have got all the information he wanted by the simple expedient of
  asking for our cards. Verily, suspicious folk give themselves a deal of
  unnecessary trouble.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; MR BRODRIBB'S EMBASSY</h2>

  <p class="first">There is a certain psychological phenomenon known to those
  financial navigators who have business on the deep and perilous waters of the
  Stock Exchange as 'jobbing backwards.' It is not their monopoly, however. To
  ordinary mortals&mdash;who describe it as 'prophesying after the
  event'&mdash;it has been familiar from time immemorial, and has always been
  associated with a degree of wisdom and certainty strangely lacking in
  prophecy of a more hasty and premature kind.</p>

  <p>Reviewing the curious case of which this narrative is the record, I am
  tempted to embark on this eminently satisfying form of mental exercise. But
  when I do so, I am disposed to look with some surprise at the very
  conspicuous deficiency in the power of 'jobbing forward' which I displayed
  while the events which I am chronicling were in progress. Now, I can see that
  all the striking and significant facts (only they then appeared neither
  striking nor significant) which enabled Thorndyke, from the very first, to
  pursue a steady advance along a visible trail, were in my possession as much
  as they were in his. But, whereas in his hands they became connected so as to
  form a continuous clue, in mine they remained separate, and apparently
  unrelated fragments. At the time, I thought that Thorndyke was hiding from me
  what material evidence he had. Now it is obvious to me (as also to the acute
  reader, who has, no doubt, already pieced the evidence together) that he not
  only concealed nothing, but actually gave me several of the very broadest
  hints.</p>

  <p>So, despite the knowledge that I really possessed, if I had only realised
  it, I remained utterly in the dark. All that I knew for certain was that
  Winifred was encompassed by dangers; that human wolves prowled about her
  habitation and dogged her footsteps when she went abroad.</p>

  <p>But even these perils had their compensations, for they gave an appearance
  of necessity to the constant companionship that my inclinations prompted. It
  was not a mere pilgrim of love that wended his way daily to Jacob Street, but
  an appointed guardian with duties to discharge. In the personally-conducted
  tours through the town, on business connected with the drawings that Winifred
  continued to produce with unabated industry, I was carrying out an
  indispensable function, since she was not permitted to go abroad without an
  efficient escort; and thus duty marched with pleasure.</p>

  <p>Intimate, however, as my relations with Winifred had become, and
  recognised now even by Percy, I abstained from any confidences on the subject
  of our investigation of the murder. That was Thorndyke's affair, and although
  he had made no stipulation on the subject, I had the feeling that he expected
  me to keep my own counsel, as he certainly did himself. Accordingly, in
  describing our visit to Beauchamp Blake&mdash;in which both she and Percy
  were intensely interested&mdash;I said nothing about the man whom I had seen
  in Aylesbury.</p>

  <p>One exception I had nearly made, but thought better of it. The occasion
  arose one afternoon when we were examining and criticising her latest
  drawing. As we stood before the easel, a shaft of sunlight, coming in through
  the great window, struck a part of the drawing and totally altered the
  character of the colouring. I remarked on the change of colour produced by
  the more intense illumination.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said she, 'and that reminds me of a very odd discovery that I made
  the other day and that I meant to tell you about.' She unfastened the silken
  cord by which she wore the mysterious locket suspended from her neck, and
  opening the little gold volume, held it in the sunbeam so that the light fell
  upon the coil of hair that it enclosed.</p>

  <p>'Do you see?' she asked, looking at me expectantly.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' I answered. 'In the sunlight the hair seems to have quite a
  distinct blue tint.'</p>

  <p>'Exactly!' she exclaimed. 'Now isn't that very remarkable? I have often
  heard of blue-black hair, but I thought it was just a phrase expressing
  intense blackness without any tinge of brown. But this is really blue, quite
  a clear, rich blue, like the colour of deeply-toned stained glass. Do you
  suppose it is natural? It can hardly be a dye.'</p>

  <p>It was then that I had nearly told her of Thorndyke's discovery and his
  strange and cryptic utterances on the subject. But a principle is a
  principle. The fact had been communicated to me by him, and I did not feel at
  liberty to disclose it without his sanction, though, to be sure, there was
  nothing confidential about it. His examination of the locket had been,
  apparently, a matter of mere curiosity. For Thorndyke was so constituted that
  he could not bring himself willingly to leave a problem unsolved, even though
  its solution promised no useful result. To him the solution was an end in
  itself, undertaken for the pleasure of the mental exercise. And this locket
  evidently held a secret. To what extent he had mastered that secret, I could
  not guess. Nor did I particularly care. It was not my secret, and I had no
  taste for working out irrelevant puzzles.</p>

  <p>'I should hardly think the blue colour can be natural,' said I, and then,
  by way of compromise, I added: 'but I expect Thorndyke could tell you. When
  you come to see us again you had better show it to him and hear what he says
  about it.'</p>

  <p>I took the locket from her hand and looked it over with half-impatient
  curiosity, remembering Thorndyke's exasperating advice, and recalling his
  reference to the hallmark on the back, I turned it over and scrutinised the
  minute device.</p>

  <p>'You are looking at the hallmark, or the goldsmith's "touch," or whatever
  it is,' said Winifred. 'It is rather curious. I have never seen one like it
  before. It certainly is not an ordinary English hallmark. Let me get you a
  magnifying-glass.'</p>

  <p>She fetched a strong reading-glass, and through this I examined the mark
  more minutely. But I could make nothing of it. It consisted of four
  punch-marks, of which the first was a capital A surmounted by a small crown
  and bearing two palm-leaves, the second a kind of escutcheon bearing the
  initials AH surmounted by a crown, and over that a fleur-de-lis; the third
  bore simply a capital L, and the fourth the head of some animal which looked
  like a horse.</p>

  <p>'It is a curious and unusual mark,' said I, handing back to her the locket
  and the glass, 'but it conveys no information to me beyond the suggestion
  that the locket is apparently of foreign workmanship, probably French or
  Italian, But,' I added, with a malicious hope of seeing my reverend senior
  cornered, 'you had better ask Thorndyke about it when you come. He is sure to
  be able to tell you all about it.'</p>

  <p>'He seems to be a sort of human encyclopaedia,' Winifred remarked as she
  refastened the locket. 'I shall adopt your advice and consult him about that
  hair, but I shan't be able to come this week. There is quite a big batch of
  drawings to be done, and that means some long working days. Perhaps you can
  arrange an afternoon in the latter part of next week for the oracular
  tea-party.'</p>

  <p>I promised to ascertain my colleague's arrangements and to fix a day, but
  the promise was left unredeemed and the 'oracular tea-party' was thrust into
  the background by new and more stirring events, which began to cast their
  shadows before them that very evening. For, when I entered our chambers,
  behold Mr Brodribb and Sir Lawrence Drayton settled in armchairs by the fire,
  in company with the small table and the inevitable decanter. Evidently some
  kind of conference was in progress.</p>

  <p>'Ha!' said Brodribb. 'Here is the fourth conspirator. Now we are complete.
  I have been devilling for your respected senior, Anstey, and I have called to
  report progress. Also, as you see, I have captured Sir Lawrence and brought
  him along as he seemed to be an interested party.'</p>

  <p>'He is a somewhat mystified party at present,' said Drayton, 'but probably
  some explanations are contemplated.'</p>

  <p>'They are going to begin as soon as Anstey has filled his glass,' said
  Brodribb, bearing in mind, no doubt, the laws of conviviality as expounded by
  Mrs Gamp; and as the stipulated condition was complied with, he proceeded:
  'It was suggested to me by Thorndyke a short time ago that the tenure of the
  Beauchamp Blake property would be put on a more satisfactory footing if the
  missing title-deeds could be recovered.'</p>

  <p>'More satisfactory to the present tenant, you mean,' said Drayton.</p>

  <p>'More satisfactory to everybody,' said Brodribb.</p>

  <p>'That would depend on the nature of the documents recovered,' Sir Lawrence
  remarked. 'But let us hear the rest of the suggestion.'</p>

  <p>'The suggestion of our learned and Machiavellian friend was that, since
  the documents are believed to be hidden somewhere in the house, it would be a
  good plan to have a systematic survey of the premises carried out by some
  person who has an expert knowledge of secret chambers and hiding-places.'</p>

  <p>'Do you know of any such person?' Drayton asked.</p>

  <p>Brodribb smiled a fat smile and replenished his glass. 'I do,' he replied
  'and so do you. Thorndyke himself is quite an authority on the subject; and,
  of course, the suggestion was that the survey should be made and the search
  conducted by him. Naturally. You can guess why, I suppose?'</p>

  <p>'I can't,' said Drayton, 'if you are suggesting any reason other than the
  one you have given.'</p>

  <p>'My dear Drayton,' chuckled Brodribb, 'can you imagine Thorndyke embarking
  on a search of this kind without some definite leading facts? No, no. Our
  friend has got something up his sleeve. I've no doubt that he knows exactly
  where to put his hand on those documents before he begins.'</p>

  <p>'Do you, Thorndyke?' Sir Lawrence asked, with an inquisitive glance at my
  colleague.</p>

  <p>'Now,' the latter replied, 'I put it to you, Drayton, whether it is likely
  that I, who have never been in this house in my life, have never seen a plan
  of it, and have no knowledge whatever of its internal construction or
  arrangement, can possibly know where these documents are hidden.'</p>

  <p>'It certainly doesn't seem very probable,' Drayton admitted, and it
  certainly did not. But still I noted that Thorndyke's answer contained no
  specific denial, a circumstance that apparently did not escape Brodribb's
  observation, for that astute practitioner received the reply with an
  unabashed wink and wagged his head knowingly as he savoured his wine.</p>

  <p>'You can think what you like,' said he, 'and so can I. However, to
  proceed: the suggestion was that I should put the proposal to the present
  tenant, Arthur Blake, and expound its advantages, but, of course, say nothing
  as to the source of the inspiration. Well, I did so. I wrote to him, pointing
  out the desirability of getting possession of the deeds, and suggesting that
  he should call at my office and talk the matter over.'</p>

  <p>'And how did he take it?' asked Drayton.</p>

  <p>'Very calmly&mdash;at first. He called at my office yesterday and opened
  the subject. But he didn't seem at all keen on it; thought it sounded rather
  like a wild-goose chase&mdash;until I mentioned Thorndyke. Then his interest
  woke up at once. The mention of a real, tangible expert put the matter on a
  different plane; gave it an air of reality. And he had heard of
  Thorndyke&mdash;read about him in the papers, I suppose&mdash;and, of course,
  I cracked him up. So in the end he became as keen as mustard and anxious to
  get a start made as soon as possible. And not only keen on his own account.
  To my surprise, he raised the question of the other claimant, Peter Blake's
  son. Of course he knew about Peter Blake's claim, although it was before his
  time, and it seems that he read the newspaper report of the curious statement
  that Miss Blake&mdash;Peter's daughter&mdash;made at the inquest on Sir
  Lawrence's brother. Well, in effect, he suggested&mdash;very properly, as I
  thought&mdash;that Miss Blake might like to be present when the search was
  made.'</p>

  <p>'I certainly think,' said Drayton, 'she should be, if not actually
  present, at least represented. There might be some documents affecting her
  brother directly.'</p>

  <p>'That was his point, and he authorised me to invite her to be present and
  to make all necessary arrangements. So the question is, Thorndyke, when can
  you go down and find the documents?'</p>

  <p>'I am prepared to begin the search the day after tomorrow.'</p>

  <p>'And with regard to Miss Blake? You are acquainted with her, I think?'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' replied Thorndyke. 'We can communicate with her. But my feeling is
  that it would hardly be desirable for her to be present while the actual
  survey is being made. It may be a tedious affair, and we shall get on with it
  better without spectators. Of course I shall know if anything is found and
  shall probably ascertain its nature; and in that case she can be
  informed.'</p>

  <p>Drayton nodded, but he did not seem quite satisfied. 'I suppose that will
  do,' said he, 'though I would rather that she were directly represented. You
  see, Thorndyke, you are acting for Blake, and if Anstey goes with you, he is
  your coadjutor. I wonder if Blake would object to my looking in later in the
  day. I could, as I have to go down to Aylesbury the day after tomorrow. What
  do you say, Brodribb?'</p>

  <p>'I see no objection,' was the reply, 'in fact, I will take the
  responsibility of inviting you to call and see what progress has been
  made.'</p>

  <p>'Very well, then,' said Drayton, 'I will come about four. I shall go down
  by car, and when I have finished with my client, I can easily take Beauchamp
  Blake on my way home. And for that matter,' he added, 'I don't see why Miss
  Blake shouldn't come with me. My client's wife could entertain her while I am
  transacting the business, and then she could come on with me to the house.
  How does that strike you, Thorndyke?'</p>

  <p>'It seems quite an admirable arrangement,' my colleague replied. 'She will
  be saved the tedium of waiting about and she will have the advantage of your
  advice if any delicate inquiries have to be made.'</p>

  <p>Drayton's suggestion was accordingly adopted, subject to Winifred's
  consent&mdash;which I did not doubt she would give readily, notwithstanding
  the pressure of her work&mdash;and shortly afterwards our two friends took
  their departure, leaving me a little puzzled as to the origin and purpose of
  the conference and the projected expedition.</p>

  <p>It had been a rather curious transaction. There were several points that I
  failed to understand. In the first place, what interest had Thorndyke in
  these title-deeds? Assuming him to take Percy's rather indefinite claim
  seriously&mdash;which he apparently did&mdash;was the establishment of the
  title desirable from his point of view? I should have thought not. It had
  appeared that Blake was anxious to sell the property and had been restrained
  only by the insecurity of the title. But if the title were made secure, he
  would almost certainly sell the estate, which was the last thing that Percy's
  advisers could wish. Then could it be that our shrewd old friend Brodribb was
  right? That Thorndyke had actually ascertained or inferred the whereabouts of
  the missing deeds? In the case of any other person the supposition would have
  seemed ridiculous. But Thorndyke's power of reasoning from apparently
  unilluminating facts was so extraordinary that the possibility had to be
  admitted, and his evasive reply to Drayton's direct question seemed to make
  it even probable.</p>

  <p>'I don't see,' said I, with a faint hope of extracting some trifle of
  information from Thorndyke, 'why you are so keen on these title-deeds.'</p>

  <p>'That,' he replied, 'is because you persist in thinking in sections. If
  you would take a larger view of the subject this proposed search would appear
  to you in a rather different light.'</p>

  <p>'I wonder if there is really going to be a search,' I said craftily, 'or
  whether old Brodribb was right. I am inclined to suspect that he was.'</p>

  <p>'I commend your respect for Brodribb's opinions,' he replied. 'Our friend
  is an uncommonly wide-awake old gentleman. But he was only guessing. Whatever
  we find at Beauchamp Blake&mdash;if we find anything&mdash;will be discovered
  by bonafide research and experiment. And that raises another question. Are
  you going down with Drayton or did you propose to come with me?'</p>

  <p>'I don't want to be in your way,' I replied, a little piqued at the
  question. 'Otherwise I should, of course, have liked to come with you.</p>

  <p>'Your help would be very valuable,' said he, 'if you are willing to
  sacrifice the other attractions. But if you are going to help me, we had
  better take a little preliminary practice together. There is a set of empty
  chambers next door. Tomorrow I will get the keys from the treasurer's office,
  and we can put in some spare time making careful measured plans. The whole
  art of discovering secret chambers is in the making of plans so exact as to
  account for every inch of space, and showing accurately the precise thickness
  of every wall and floor. And a little practice in the art of opening locked
  doors without the aid of keys will not be amiss.'</p>

  <p>This programme was duly carried out. On the morrow we conveyed into the
  empty chambers a plane table covered with drawing-paper, a surveyor's tape,
  and a measuring-rod; and with these appliances, I proceeded, under
  Thorndyke's direction, to make a scaled plan of the set of rooms, showing the
  exact thickness of all the walls and the spaces occupied by chimneys,
  cupboards, and all kinds of projections and irregularities. It was a longer
  business than I had expected; indeed I did not get it completed until the
  evening was closing in, and when at last I had filled in the final details
  and took the completed plan to our chambers for Thorndyke's inspection, I
  found my colleague busily engaged in preparations for the morrow's
  adventure.</p>

  <p>'Well!' I exclaimed, when my plan had been examined and replaced by a
  fresh sheet of paper, 'this is an extraordinary outfit! I hope we shan't have
  to carry this case home after dark.'</p>

  <p>It was certainly a most sinister collection of appliances that Thorndyke
  had assembled in the suitcase. There was a brace and bits, and auger, a bunch
  of skeleton keys, an electric lantern, a pair of telescopic jemmies, and two
  automatic pistols.</p>

  <p>'What on earth are the pistols for?' I demanded.</p>

  <p>'Those,' he replied, 'are just an extra precaution. Many of these
  hiding-holes are fitted with snap locks, and it is quite possible to find
  oneself caught in a trap. Then, if there should be no room to use a jemmy, it
  might be necessary to blow the lock to pieces.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' I remarked, 'it is as well to take all necessary precautions, but
  if Blake sees those pistols they will need a good deal of explaining,
  especially as he will certainly recognise us as the two suspicious
  visitors.'</p>

  <p>'We need not exhibit them ostentatiously,' said Thorndyke. 'We can carry
  them in our pockets, and the jemmies as well. Then if the necessity to use
  them arises, they will explain themselves.'</p>

  <p>The rest of the evening we spent in a course of instruction in the
  arrangement and design of the various kinds of secret chambers, hiding-holes,
  aumbries, and receptacles for documents, sacred vessels, and other objects
  that, in times of political upheaval, might need to be concealed. On this
  subject Thorndyke was a mine of information, and he produced a note-book
  filled with descriptions, plans, sections, and photographs of most of the
  examples that had been examined, which we went over together and studied in
  the minutest detail. By the end of the evening, I had not only acquired an
  immense amount of knowledge on an obscure out-of-the-way subject, but I had
  become in so far infected with Thorndyke's enthusiasm that I found myself
  looking forward almost eagerly to the romantic quest on which the following
  day was to see us launched.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17"></a>XVII. &mdash; THE SECRET CHAMBER</h2>

  <p class="first">It was close on half-past eleven when our train drew up in
  Wendover Station. We had just finished our rather premature lunch and had
  packed up the luncheon baskets and placed them on the seats; and now, lifting
  down the suitcase and the plane table with its folding tripod, stepped out on
  to the platform.</p>

  <p>'I wonder,' said I, 'if Blake has sent any kind of conveyance for us. I
  don't suppose he has.'</p>

  <p>My surmise turned out to be correct. When we went out into the station
  approach, the only vehicle in sight was a closed fly, which we decided to
  charter; and having stowed our impedimenta on the front seat and given the
  driver the necessary directions, we entered and took possession of the back
  seat. The coachman climbed to the box and started the horse at a quiet
  jog-trot, turning into the Aylesbury, or London Road to avoid the steep hill
  down which we had come to the station on the last occasion. As we passed the
  fine, brick-towered windmill and came out on the country road, Thorndyke
  leaned forward and opened the suitcase.</p>

  <p>'We had better put the more suspicious-looking objects in our pockets,'
  said he. 'We may not want them at all, and then they won't have been seen,
  whereas if they are wanted, the necessity will explain our having provided
  ourselves with them.'</p>

  <p>He took out the bunch of skeleton keys and slipped them into his coat
  pocket, and then picked out the two telescopic jemmies, one of which he
  handed to me while he bestowed the other in some kind of interior
  pocket&mdash;into which, I noticed, it disappeared with singular
  completeness, suggesting a suspicious suitability of the receptacle. Finally
  he took out the two automatic pistols, and having pocketed one, handed me the
  other after a careful and detailed explanation of its mechanism and the
  proper way to hold and fire it. I took the weapon from him and stowed it in
  my hip-pocket, very gingerly and with some reluctance, for I detest firearms;
  and as I placed it carefully with the muzzle pointed as far as possible away
  from my own person, I reflected once more with dim surprise on the
  circumstance that Thorndyke, whose dislike of these weapons was as great as
  my own, should have adopted this clumsy and dangerous means of dealing with a
  somewhat remote contingency. It seemed an excessive precaution, and I found
  creeping into my mind a faint suspicion that my colleague might possibly have
  had something more in his mind than he had disclosed, though that was even
  more incomprehensible, considering the very peaceful nature of our quest.</p>

  <p>I was still turning these matters over in my mind when the fly reached the
  crossroads and entered the lane. Here the appearance of the inn just ahead
  recalled me to our immediate business, and old Brodribb's observation
  recurred to me.</p>

  <p>'How are you going to start, Thorndyke?' I asked. 'I presume you have got
  some definite programme?'</p>

  <p>'I shall be guided by what Blake has to tell us,' he replied. 'He may have
  a good plan of the house, and it is possible that he has made some
  explorations of his own which will give us a start. There is our old friend,
  the lodge-keeper, mightily surprised to see us.'</p>

  <p>I caught a passing glimpse of the sleuth, staring at us in undisguised
  astonishment; then we swung round into the drive, and the old house came into
  view. We were evidently expected, for as we approached the house a man came
  out of the main entrance and stood on the wide threshold awaiting our
  arrival. Just as the fly was about to draw up opposite the portico, Thorndyke
  said in a low voice:</p>

  <p>'If we are offered any refreshments, Anstey, we had better decline them.
  We have had lunch, you know.'</p>

  <p>I glanced at him in amazement. It was a most astonishing remark. But there
  was no time to ask for any explanation, for at that moment the fly drew up,
  the driver jumped down from his seat, and the squire came forward to receive
  us.</p>

  <p>'We have met before, I think,' said the latter as we shook hands. 'If I
  had known who you were I should have invited you to look at the house then.
  However, it isn't too late. I see you have brought your traps with you,' he
  added, with a glance at the plane table and its tripod.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Thorndyke, 'we are prepared to make a regular survey, if
  necessary. But perhaps you have a plan of the house?'</p>

  <p>'There is a plan,' replied Blake, 'though I fancy it is not very exact. I
  will show it to you. Probably it will give you a hint where to begin.'</p>

  <p>As I had now settled with the fly-man, we entered the house, and Blake
  conducted us into a large room, furnished as a library and containing a
  considerable collection of books. On a table by one of the windows was a plan
  spread out and held open by paperweights.</p>

  <p>'You see,' said Blake, 'this is an architect's plan, made, I think, when
  some repairs were contemplated. It is little more than a sketch, and doesn't
  give much detail. But it will help you to take a preliminary look round
  before lunch.'</p>

  <p>'We have had lunch,' said Thorndyke. 'We got that over in the train so
  that we should have a clear day before us. Time is precious, and we ought to
  get to work at once. I suppose you have not made any sort of investigation on
  your own account?'</p>

  <p>As Thorndyke mentioned our premature meal, the squire gave him a quick
  glance and seemed to look a little resentful. But he made no comment beyond
  answering the question.</p>

  <p>'I have not made any regular examination of the house, but I have poked
  about a little in the old part and I have found one secret chamber, which I
  have utilised as a photographic dark-room. Perhaps you would like to see that
  first. There may be some other hiding-places connected with it which I have
  overlooked. There is a tall cupboard in it which I have used to store my
  chemicals.'</p>

  <p>'We may have to empty that cupboard to see if there is anything behind
  it,' said Thorndyke. 'At any rate, we had better begin by overhauling
  it.'</p>

  <p>He opened the suitcase and took from it the surveyor's tape, which he put
  in his pocket.</p>

  <p>'Hadn't we better take the lamp?' said I.</p>

  <p>'You won't want that,' said Blake. 'There is a portable lamp in the
  room.'</p>

  <p>I was half-inclined to take it, nevertheless, but as Thorndyke shut the
  suitcase and prepared to follow our host, I let the matter rest.</p>

  <p>From the library we passed out into a long gallery, one side of which was
  hung with portraits, presumably of members of the family, and some of them of
  considerable antiquity, to judge by the style of the painting and the ancient
  costumes. Then we crossed several rooms&mdash;fine, stately apartments with
  florid, moulded ceilings and walls of oaken panelling, on which I noticed a
  very respectable display of pictures. The rooms were fully
  furnished&mdash;very largely, I noticed, with the oak and walnut furniture
  that must have been put in when the new wing was built. But they were all
  pervaded by a sense of desolation and neglect; they were dusty and looked
  faded, unused, and forgotten. Nowhere was there a sign of human occupation,
  nor, I noticed, did we meet, in the whole course of our journey across this
  part of the house, a single servant or retainer, or, indeed, any living
  creature whatever.</p>

  <p>A door at the end of a short passage, on being unlocked and opened,
  revealed a short flight of wooden stairs, and when we had descended these we
  found ourselves in a totally different atmosphere. This was the old timber
  house, and as we crossed its deserted rooms and trod its uncarpeted oaken
  floors, our footsteps resounded with dismal echoes among the empty chambers
  and corridors, conveying a singular sense of remoteness and desolation. The
  gloomy old rooms with their dirt-encrusted casements, the massive beams in
  their ceilings, the blackened wainscoting, rich with carved ornament but
  shrouded with the dust and grime of years of neglect, the gouty-legged
  Elizabethan tables and ponderous oaken chairs and settles; all these dusty
  and forgotten appurtenances of a vanished generation of men seemed to have
  died with their long-departed human associates and to be silently awaiting
  their final decay and dissolution. It was an eerie place, dead and desolate
  as an Egyptian tomb.</p>

  <p>And yet, strangely enough, it was here that I saw the one solitary sign of
  human life. We were passing along a narrow gallery or corridor when I
  noticed, high up in the panelled wall, one of those small interior windows
  which one sees in old houses, placed opposite an exterior window to light an
  inner chamber. Looking up at this little window, I saw the face of some
  person looking down on us. It was the merest glimpse that I caught, for the
  window was coated with dust and the room behind it in darkness. But there was
  the face of some human creature, man, woman, or child, and its appearance in
  this remote, sepulchral place, so far from the domain of the living
  household, smote upon me strangely and seemed to make even more intense the
  uncanny solitude of the empty mansion.</p>

  <p>I was still speculating curiously on who this watcher might be, when our
  host halted by the wall of a smallish room.</p>

  <p>'This is the place,' said he, pointing to the wall. 'I wonder if you can
  find the door.'</p>

  <p>The wainscoting in this room was nearly plain, the only ornament being a
  range of very flat pilasters and a dado moulding, enriched by a row of
  hemispherical bosses. Thorndyke ran his eye over the wainscoting, noting more
  particularly the way in which the pilasters were joined to the intervening
  panels.</p>

  <p>'I suppose,' said he, 'we had better try the most obvious probabilities
  first. The natural thing would be to use one of these bosses to cover the
  release of the lock.'</p>

  <p>Blake assented (or dissented) with an inarticulate grunt, and Thorndyke
  then proceeded to pass along the row of bosses, pressing each one firmly in
  turn. After about a dozen trials, he came to one in the middle of a pilaster
  which yielded to the pressure of his thumb, sinking in some two inches, in
  the fashion of a large electric-bell push. Holding the 'push' in with his
  thumb, he pressed vigorously against the adjoining panel, first on one side
  of the pilaster and then on the other, but in neither case was there any sign
  of the panel moving, though I added my weight to his.</p>

  <p>'You haven't quite hit it off yet,' Blake informed us.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke reflected for a few seconds. Then, keeping the boss pressed in,
  he put his other thumb on the next one of the series, which was at the edge
  of the panel, and gave a sharp push, whereupon this boss also sank in with an
  audible click and then the whole panel swung inward, disclosing a narrow and
  wonderfully well-concealed doorway.</p>

  <p>'Good,' said Blake. 'You've solved the problem more quickly than I did.
  Just hold the door open a moment. It has rather a strong spring, and I
  generally prop it open with this block.' As he spoke he fetched a small block
  of wood from under an adjacent table and set it against the foot of the
  door.</p>

  <p>'I had better go first,' said he, 'as I know where to find the lamp.' With
  this he entered before us, striking a wax match and shading it with his hand.
  The dim illumination showed a narrow, passage-like room, apparently a good
  deal more lofty than the low-ceiled room from which we had entered it, and
  dimly revealed a very high cupboard near the farther end. We had groped our
  way after him a few paces when he turned suddenly. 'How stupid of me!' he
  exclaimed. 'I had forgotten that I had left the lamp in the next room. Excuse
  me one moment.'</p>

  <p>He slipped past us, and kicking the block away, ran out, pulling the door
  sharply after him, when it slammed to with a loud click of the latch.</p>

  <p>'What the deuce did he kick that block away for,' I exclaimed, 'and leave
  us all in the dark?'</p>

  <p>'We shall probably find out presently,' replied Thorndyke. 'Meanwhile,
  stand perfectly still. Don't move hand or foot.'</p>

  <p>'Why do you say that?' I demanded with something like a thrill of alarm,
  for there was something rather disturbing in the tone of Thorndyke's
  sharply-spoken command. And standing there in the pitchy darkness, locked in
  a secret chamber in the very heart of this great, empty mansion, there came
  to me a flash of sudden suspicion. I recalled Thorndyke's mysterious warning
  to take no food in this house; I remembered the loaded pistol that he had put
  into my hand, and I saw again that unaccountable face at the window, watching
  us as Blake led us&mdash;whither? 'You don't think Blake is up to any
  mischief, do you?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'I can't say,' he replied. 'Perhaps he will come with the lamp presently.
  But we may as well see where we are while we are waiting.'</p>

  <p>I heard a rustling as if he were searching his pockets. Then, suddenly,
  there broke out a bright light that flooded the little room and rendered all
  the objects in it plainly visible.</p>

  <p>It was a queer-looking room, almost more like a rather irregularly-shaped
  passage, for none of the walls were straight, and the ceiling sloped up from
  a height of about eight feet at one end to nearly twelve at the other. Near
  the farther end was a very high wall-cupboard, and at the extreme end, facing
  us, was a small door, about three feet above the floor level and approached
  by a flight of five wooden stairs.</p>

  <p>The appearance of the light was reassuring, and still more so was the
  evidence that it afforded of Thorndyke's foresight in having provided himself
  with this supplementary lamp. But much less reassuring was his next
  observation after having flashed his light all over the room.</p>

  <p>'I suspect we have seen the last of our host&mdash;for the present, at any
  rate. Look at the top of the cupboard, Anstey.'</p>

  <p>I looked at the cupboard. It was between eight and nine feet high, and was
  fitted with folding doors, of which the leaf nearest to us was half open; and
  on the top of the half-open door, near the free corner, a little board had
  been placed with one end resting on the door and the other insecurely
  supported by the moulding at the top of the cupboard; and on the board,
  delicately balanced over the door, was a large chemical flask, filled with
  what looked like water and fitted with a cork.</p>

  <p>'What do you make of it?' Thorndyke asked, keeping his powerful
  inspection-lamp focused on the flask as I gazed at it.</p>

  <p>'It looks like some sort of booby-trap,' said I. 'It is a wonder that
  flask wasn't shaken down when Blake slammed the door.'</p>

  <p>'He probably expected that it would be, and it very nearly was, for you
  can see that it has jarred to the extreme edge. But failing the slam of the
  door, he no doubt assumes that we, being as he imagines in total darkness,
  shall grope our way along the wall until we come to the cupboard. Then, the
  instant we touch the door, down will come the flask. It is quite an ingenious
  plan.'</p>

  <p>'But what is the purpose of it?' I demanded. 'It can't be a practical
  joke.'</p>

  <p>'It isn't,' said he. 'Far from it. I should say it is very deadly earnest.
  Unless I am mistaken, that flask is filled with some volatile poison. The
  instant that it falls and breaks, this room will become a lethal
  chamber.'</p>

  <p>At these words, uttered by Thorndyke in tones as calm and emotionless as
  if he were giving a demonstration to his students, a chill of horror crept
  over me. My very hair seemed to stir. It was an appalling situation. I stared
  in dismay and terror at the flask, poised aloft and ready, as it seemed, at
  the slightest movement, or even a loudly-spoken word, to come crashing down
  and stifle us with its deadly fumes.</p>

  <p>'Great God!' I gasped. 'Then we are in a trap! But is there nothing that
  we can do? The flask is too high up for us to reach it.'</p>

  <p>'It would be sheer insanity to go near it; said Thorndyke. 'But I don't
  think we need be very disturbed. There must be some way of getting out of
  this chamber. Let us go and reconnoitre the door, though I daresay our friend
  has attended to that.'</p>

  <p>We tiptoed cautiously back to the door and examined its construction. The
  mechanism was very simple, but like most old locksmith's work, extremely
  massive. The two bosses outside evidently were the ends of two sliding bars
  and bolts of wood. The one which Thorndyke had pressed first apparently had a
  slot which, when it was brought opposite the massive latch, allowed the
  latter to rise. That at least was what Thorndyke inferred, for, as the latch
  was in the thickness of the great oaken doorpost (which had a slot to let it
  escape, when raised) the actual mechanism could not be seen. The second
  sliding bar, when pushed in, raised the latch itself by means of an inclined
  plane. Both the sliding bars had been provided with knobs on their inner
  ends, so that they could be pulled in from inside as well as pushed in from
  without; but whereas the knob still remained on the bar which raised the
  latch, that of the bar which released the latch and allowed it to rise had
  been removed. The end of the bar could be seen, nearly flush with the surface
  of the doorpost, and in it a small hole in which the knob had evidently been
  screwed.</p>

  <p>'Would it be possible to hook anything, such as a skeleton key, into that
  hole?' I asked when we had examined it thoroughly.</p>

  <p>'I think we can do better than that,' said he, hooking the bulls-eye of
  his inspection-lamp in a button-hole of his coat and feeling in his pocket.
  'This is a more workmanlike appliance.'</p>

  <p>He exhibited an appliance that looked like a kind of clasp-knife, but was
  actually a pocket set of screw-taps, such as are carried by engineers and
  plumbers. Drawing out the smallest tap, he tried it in the hole, but the
  latter was too small to admit it. Then, from the same appliance, he drew out
  a taper reamer, and on trying this in the hole he found that the point
  entered easily. He accordingly drove it in lightly, rotating it as he
  pressed, and continued to turn it until the sharp-cutting tool had broached
  out the hole to a size that would admit the nose of the tap, when he withdrew
  the reamer, and inserting the tap, gave it a few vigorous turns. Now, on
  pulling gently at the handle of the tap, it was seen to be fast in the hole,
  and the sliding bar began to move forward.</p>

  <p>'I wonder if our host is hanging about outside,' said he.</p>

  <p>'What does it matter whether he is or not?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'Because I want to try whether we can open the door, and I don't want him
  to hear.'</p>

  <p>'But, confound it,' said I, 'he will see us when we come out.'</p>

  <p>'We are not going to come out that way if we can find any other.'</p>

  <p>'Why not?' I demanded. 'We want to get clear of that infernal flask, and
  the sooner we are out the better.'</p>

  <p>'Not at all,' said Thorndyke. 'If we come out and show ourselves, the game
  is up, and there will probably be trouble. Whereas if we can get out another
  way, we shall put him in a very pretty dilemma. Hearing no sound from us, he
  will probably assume that his plan has succeeded. And if Drayton should
  arrive before he has taken the risk of verifying our decease, his
  explanations should be rather interesting. At any rate, I should like to see
  what his next move will be, but we must make our retreat secure in case of
  accidents. I think we can raise the latch without making any noticeable
  sound. You observe that the pivot has been oiled&mdash;and also that the
  door-spring is new and has apparently been fixed on quite recently.'</p>

  <p>In my heart I cursed his inquiring spirit, for I wanted to get out of this
  horrible trap. But I offered no objection, standing by sullenly while he
  proceeded with calm interest to complete his experiment. Grasping the
  tap-handle with one hand and the knob with the other, he pulled steadily at
  the former until the sliding bar was drawn inwards to its full extent, and
  then at the knob, which came in with similar ease and silence. But when I saw
  the latch rise and the door begin to swing inwards, I could hardly restrain
  myself from dragging it open and making a burst for freedom.</p>

  <p>The next moment the opportunity was gone. With the same silent care
  Thorndyke reclosed the door, let the latch down, and slid back the release
  bar.</p>

  <p>'Now,' said he, turning away but leaving the tap jammed in the hole, 'we
  can pursue our investigations at our ease. If there is no other exit, we can
  come out this way, and we have got a clear retreat in case of accidents. What
  does the appearance of this place suggest to you? I mean as to an exit.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' I answered, 'there is a door at the top of those steps. Presumably
  its function is the ordinary function of a door.'</p>

  <p>'I doubt it,' said he. 'It is too blatantly innocent. More probably its
  function was to occupy pursuers while the fugitive was gaining a start.
  Still, we will have a thorough look at it, as I expect our host has already
  done. We had better go one at time, and for Heaven's sake step lightly, and
  remember that if that flask should come down, you make a bee-line for the
  door and get outside instantly.'</p>

  <p>Lighted by Thorndyke's lamp, I crept cautiously along the room with my
  eyes riveted on the flask and my heart in my mouth. Then Thorndyke followed,
  and together we ascended the steps to the door, and proceeded to examine it
  minutely. It was provided with plainly visible hinges but had no ostensible
  latch or lock. Around it were a number of projecting ends of tree-nails, but
  pressure on them, one after the other, produced no result, nor did the door
  itself show any sign of yielding; indeed, the form of the hinges suggested
  that it opened inwards&mdash;towards the room&mdash;if it would open at
  all.</p>

  <p>'We are wasting time, Anstey,' Thorndyke said at length. 'The thing is a
  dummy, as we might have expected. Let us try something more likely. Now, from
  what I know of these secret chambers, I should say that the most probable
  exits are the cupboard and the stairs. Both, you notice, seem to be
  functionless. There is no reason for that great cupboard having been built in
  here, and these stairs simply lead to a dummy door. And cupboards with
  sliding shelves and concealed doors in the back, and stairs with movable
  treads were very favourite devices. The cupboard is unfortunately not
  practicable while that flask is balanced overhead, so we had better give our
  attention to the stairs. I suspect that there are two exits, in different
  directions, but either will do for us.'</p>

  <p>We stole softly down the stairs, and stooping on hands and knees, brought
  the light to bear on the joints of the treads and risers; but the dirt of
  ages had settled on them and filled up any tell-tale cracks that might have
  been visible. To my eye, the steps looked all alike, and all seemed to be
  solid oak planks immovably fixed in their positions.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Thorndyke dived into his inner pocket and brought forth the
  telescopic jemmy, which he pulled out to its full length. Then, laying the
  chisel end on the tread of the bottom stair, he drove its edge forcibly
  against the angle where the tread and the riser met. To my surprise, the edge
  entered fully half an inch into the joint, which the dirt had filled and
  concealed.</p>

  <p>'Get your jemmy, Anstey, and push it in by the side of mine,' said he.</p>

  <p>I produced the tool from my breast pocket, where it had been reposing to
  my great discomfort, and opening it out, I inserted its edge close to that of
  Thorndyke's.</p>

  <p>'Now,' said he, 'both together. Push!'</p>

  <p>We both bore heavily on the ends of the jemmies, and the sharp chisel ends
  entered fully an inch; and simultaneously a visible crack appeared along the
  foot of the riser. We now withdrew the jemmies and reinserted them at the two
  ends of the tread. Again we drove in together, and the crack widened
  perceptibly. On this, Thorndyke rose and closely examined the angle of the
  step above and then that of the third, and here, as he brought the bulls-eye
  close to the surface of the step, I could see that a narrow crack had opened
  between the step and the riser.</p>

  <p>'It looks,' said I, 'as if the two steps had shifted.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' he agreed, 'and apparently the pivot, if there is one, is above.
  Let us get to work again.'</p>

  <p>We reinserted the jemmies several times in different places, thrusting
  together and as forcibly as we dared with that horrible flask insecurely
  balanced above our heads; and at each thrust there was an appreciable
  widening of the crack, which had now opened fully a quarter of an inch,
  making it evident that the stairs were really movable.</p>

  <p>'Now,' said Thorndyke, 'I think we might venture to prise.'</p>

  <p>He reversed his jemmy and inserted the 'crow' end into the crack near one
  extremity, while I inserted mine near the opposite end. Then, at a word from
  him, we bore on the ends of the levers, and with a protesting groan, the step
  rose another inch. Thorndyke now laid aside his jemmy, and standing on the
  bottom step, thrust his fingers into the gaping crack; I did the same, and
  when we had got a fair grasp, he gave the word.</p>

  <p>'Now, both together. Up she comes!'</p>

  <p>We both heaved steadily but not too violently. There was a grinding creak
  as the long-disused joint moved; then suddenly the two steps swung up and
  stood nearly upright on their pivot, disclosing a yawning hole in which the
  light showed a narrow flight of brick steps.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke immediately stepped in through the opening, and descending a few
  steps, turned and held the light for me, when I followed.</p>

  <p>The steps fell away steeply down a kind of well with walls of brickwork,
  which was thickly encrusted with slimy growths of algae and fungi, and the
  steps themselves were slippery with a similar coating and were almost hidden,
  in places, by great fungous masses which sprouted from the joints of the
  brickwork. After descending about eight feet, we reached a level floor and
  proceeded along a narrow brick tunnel, stooping to clear the slime-covered
  roof. This extended some fifteen yards and ended in what at first looked like
  a blank wall. On coming close, however, and throwing on it the light of the
  lantern, I perceived an oblong space of planking about five feet long by
  three high and three feet above the floor, forming a rude door, very massive
  and clumsy and furnished with a simple, roughly-fashioned iron latch.</p>

  <p>'I don't see any hinges,' observed Thorndyke, 'so there is probably an
  internal pivot. Let us prise up the latch first and then see how the door
  moves.'</p>

  <p>He slipped the end of his jemmy under the latch, taking a bearing on the
  brickwork, and levered the great latch up without much difficulty in spite of
  the rust that had locked it in position. Then, inserting the chisel end into
  the crack between the door and the jamb, he gave a tentative wrench, when the
  door moved perceptibly, inwards at one end and outwards at the other.</p>

  <p>'It is evidently pivoted in the middle,' said he. 'If you will prise the
  other end while I work at this, we shall get it open easily.'</p>

  <p>We accordingly inserted our jemmies at the respective ends and gave a
  steady thrust; on which the door, with a deep groan and a loud screech from
  the rusty pivots, swung round on its centre, letting in a flood of cheerful
  daylight and fresh air, which I inhaled with profound relief. A vigorous pull
  on the edge brought the door fully open and disclosed a mass of foliage which
  blocked the view from within and no doubt concealed the door from outside.
  But in any case it would have been very inconspicuous, for we could now see
  that the solid planking was covered externally with counterfeit brickwork,
  very convincingly executed with slices of brick.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke reached out and pulled aside a branch of the tree that obscured
  the view 'This door,' said he, 'seems to open on the edge of the moat, so it
  was probably made at a time when the moat was full of water. However, we have
  found our way out, and it is a better one than the cupboard would have given
  us, for, if that has an exit in the back, it probably leads up to the garrets
  or the chimneys. Now all we have to do is to remove our traces from the
  chamber above and make our way out. But there is no need for you to come
  up.'</p>

  <p>'I am coming up all the same,' said I, and as he turned to re-enter the
  tunnel, I followed, though I admit, with infinite reluctance. But I did not
  actually re-enter the chamber. I stood with my head out of the opening and a
  terrified eye on the accursed flask, while Thorndyke tiptoed across the room
  to the door. Here he withdrew the tap from the hole, and folding it, dropped
  it into his pocket. Then he stooped and blew away the wood-dust that had
  fallen from the reamer on to the floor, and having thus removed every trace
  (excepting the broached-out hole in the sliding bar), he stepped lightly back
  and re-entered the opening.</p>

  <p>'The problem now,' said he, 'is to get these stairs back in their place
  without shaking down the flask.'</p>

  <p>'Does it matter,' I asked, 'now that we have a means of escape?'</p>

  <p>'Not very much,' he answered, 'but I would rather leave it there in
  evidence.'</p>

  <p>The movable stairs were furnished with a rough wooden handle on the
  underside to enable a fugitive to replace them from below. This Thorndyke
  grasped, and with a steady pull, drew the stairs down into their original
  position, giving a final tug to bring the joints close together. Then once
  more we began to descend the slippery steps.</p>

  <p>We were about half-way down when Thorndyke stopped.</p>

  <p>'Listen, Anstey,' said he, switching off the light. And as he spoke, I
  caught the sound of footsteps somewhere overhead. Then I heard the door of
  the secret chamber open slowly&mdash;I could recognise it by the sound of the
  door-spring&mdash;and after a little interval, Blake's voice called out:</p>

  <p>'Dr Thorndyke! Mr Anstey! Where are you?'</p>

  <p>Again there was a short pause. The door slowly opened a little farther,
  the floor above creaked under a stealthy tread, and then I seemed to catch
  faintly another voice, apparently more distant.</p>

  <p>'They are not here,' said Blake. 'They seem to have got out somehow. Here,
  catch hold of the lamp. Mind the door! Mind the&mdash;'</p>

  <p>The door-spring creaked. There was a heavy thud, and an instant later the
  sound of shattering glass, followed by a startled shout and a hurried
  trampling of feet.</p>

  <p>'The knob! The knob! Quick!' a high-pitched voice shrieked; and at that
  the very marrow in my bones seemed to creep. For the knob was useless now.
  Thorndyke's reamer had destroyed the screw-hole.</p>

  <p>With the sweat streaming down my face and my heart thumping with sickening
  violence, I listened to the torrent of curses, rising to yells of terror and
  anguish and mingled with strange, whimpering cries. I could see it all with
  horrible distinctness: the two trapped wretches above, frantically turning
  the knob in the broached-out hole while the poisonous fumes rose
  remorselessly and encompassed them.</p>

  <p>The cries grew thicker and more muffled, and mingled with dreadful coughs
  and gasps. Then there was a sound of a heavy body falling on the floor and a
  horrible husky screech broke out, whereat I felt the hair of my scalp stir
  like the fur of a frightened cat. Three times that appalling screech came
  through the floor to our pitch-dark lurking-place, the last time dying away
  into a hideous, quavering wail. Then, once more, there was the thud of a
  heavy body falling on the floor, and after that an awful silence.</p>

  <p>'God Almighty!' I gasped. 'Can't we do anything, Thorndyke?'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' he replied, 'we can get out of this. It is time we did.'</p>

  <p>Even as he spoke I became aware of a faint odour of bitter almonds which
  seemed every moment to grow more distinct. It was undoubtedly time for us to
  be gone; and when, once more, the light of his lamp flashed down the
  stairway, I responded readily to a gentle push and began to descend the steps
  as rapidly as my trembling knees would let me.</p>

  <p>The faint, sinister odour pursued us even to the tunnel and it was with a
  sigh of relief that I reached the open doorway and looked again on the
  sky-lit foliage and breathed the wholesome air. We crept out together through
  the long, low doorway, and grasping the branches of the trees and bushes
  outside, scrambled down the sloping bank to the dry floor of the moat.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; THE CAT'S EYE</h2>

  <p class="first">When we stood up at the bottom of the bank, I turned to
  Thorndyke and asked:</p>

  <p>'What are we going to do now? We must make some effort to let those poor
  devils out.'</p>

  <p>That,' he replied, 'is an impossibility. In the first place they are
  certainly dead by now, and in the second it would be certain death to attempt
  to open that door. The chamber is full of the vapour of hydrocyanic
  acid.'</p>

  <p>'But,' I expostulated, 'we ought to do something. Humanity demands that we
  should, at least, make a show of trying to save them.'</p>

  <p>'I don't see why,' he replied coldly. 'They are certainly dead, and if
  they were not, I would not risk a single hair of my head to save their lives.
  Still, if you have any feeling on the matter, we can go and reconnoitre. But
  we must look to our own safety.'</p>

  <p>He struck out along the floor of the moat at a brisk pace, and I kept up
  with him as well as my trembling knees would let me, for I was horribly
  shaken by the shocking experiences of the last few minutes, and still felt
  sick and faint. Thorndyke, on the other hand, was perfectly unmoved, and as
  he strode along at my side, I glanced at his calm face and found in his
  quiet, unconcerned manner something inhuman and repelling. It is true that
  those two wretches who now lay stark and dead on the floor of that dreadful
  chamber deserved no sympathy. They had digged a pit for us and fallen into it
  themselves. But still, they were human beings, and their lives were human
  lives, but Thorndyke seemed to value them no more than if they had been a
  couple of rats.</p>

  <p>About a hundred yards farther along the moat, we came to a cross path, at
  each end of which was a flight of rough steps up the bank. We ascended the
  steps on the house side, and these brought us to a small door with a Tudor
  arch in the head. A modern night-latch had been added to the ancient lock,
  but it was a simple affair which Thorndyke's picklock opened in a few
  moments, and the door then yielded to a push. It opened into a corridor which
  I recognised as the one which we had passed through and where I had seen the
  face at the window&mdash;a dead face it was now, I suspected. We turned and
  walked along it in the direction in which Blake had led us, and as we neared
  the end I began to be sensible of a faint odour in the musty air; an
  attenuated scent of bitter almonds.</p>

  <p>'We must go warily,' said Thorndyke. 'The next room, I think, is the one
  out of which the secret chamber opens.'</p>

  <p>He paused and stood looking dubiously at the door; and as he stood
  hesitating, I pushed past him, and seizing the handle, flung the door open
  and looked into the room. But it was only an instantaneous glance, showing me
  the uninterrupted wall, the wooden block lying where Blake had kicked it, and
  close by, a dead rat. The sight of that little corpse and the sickening smell
  of bitter almonds that suddenly grew strong in the air as the door opened,
  produced an instant revulsion. My concern for our would-be murderers was
  extinguished by a thrill of alarm for my own safety. I drew the door to
  hurriedly and followed Thorndyke, who was walking quickly away.</p>

  <p>'It is no use, Anstey,' he said, a little impatiently. 'It is mere
  sentiment, and a silly one at that. All we can do is to open these windows
  and clear off until the gas has diffused out. It won't take so very long with
  all the gaping joints in this old woodwork.'</p>

  <p>'And what are we going to do meanwhile?'</p>

  <p>'We must find the housekeeper, if there is one, and let her know the state
  of affairs. Then we must send information to the police at Aylesbury, and
  before they arrive, I think it would be well to prepare a written statement,
  which we can sign in their presence and which should contain all that we are
  prepared to say about the matter before the inquest.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' I agreed 'that seems to be the best course'; and with this we
  proceeded to open the rusty casements of the corridor and then made our way
  back to the new wing of the house.</p>

  <p>The inn-keeper had certainly been right. Squire Blake had been very far
  from lavish in the matter of retainers. One after another of the great, dusty
  rooms we crossed or peered into without encountering a single serving-man or
  maid. The house seemed to be utterly deserted. At last we came to the
  entrance hall, and here, as we stood commenting on this extraordinary
  solitude, a door opened and a faded and shabby elderly woman, looking like a
  rather superior charwoman, emerged. She looked at us curiously and then
  asked:</p>

  <p>'Can you tell me, sir, if Mr Blake is ready for lunch?'</p>

  <p>'I am sorry to say,' replied Thorndyke, 'that Mr Blake has met with a
  mishap. He has locked himself in his dark room and has poisoned himself
  accidentally with some chemicals.'</p>

  <p>'Oh dear!' exclaimed the woman, looking at Thorndyke with a sort of
  stupefied dismay. 'Hadn't some one better go and fetch him out?'</p>

  <p>'That is not possible at present,' said Thorndyke. 'The room is full of
  poison gas.'</p>

  <p>'But,' the woman protested, 'he may die if no one goes to his
  assistance.'</p>

  <p>'He is dead already,' said Thorndyke, 'and there is another person in the
  room with him, who is also dead'.</p>

  <p>'That will be Mr Meyer, his valet,' said the woman, staring at Thorndyke
  with a sort of bewildered horror, puzzled, no doubt, by the incongruity
  between his tragic tidings and his calm, matter-of-fact demeanour. 'And you
  say they have both killed themselves! Lord! Lord! What a dreadful thing!' She
  clasped her hands, and gazing helplessly from one of us to the other, asked:
  'What are we to do? Oh! what are we to do?'</p>

  <p>'Is there any one whom we could send into Aylesbury?' asked Thorndyke, 'We
  ought to let the police know of the accident, and we ought to get a
  doctor.'</p>

  <p>There is only the lodge-keeper,' she whimpered shakily 'He could go on Mr
  Meyer's bicycle. Dear, dear! what an awful thing it is!'</p>

  <p>'If you will have the bicycle brought to the door,' said Thorndyke, 'I
  will write a note and take it up to the lodge-keeper myself. There are
  writing materials in the library I suppose?'</p>

  <p>She supposed there were, and showed us into the room, where we found some
  notepaper and envelopes. Then she departed, wringing her hands and muttering,
  to fetch the bicycle.</p>

  <p>'I shall not give any details in this note,' Thorndyke said as he sat down
  at the table and uncapped his fountain pen, 'I shall just tell them that Mr
  Blake and his valet have met their deaths&mdash;presumably&mdash;by
  poisoning, that it is a police case, and that the Divisional Surgeon had
  better accompany the police officer.'</p>

  <p>With this he wrote the note, addressing it to the Superintendent or Chief
  Constable, and he had just closed and sealed it when the woman reappeared to
  announce the arrival of the bicycle, which had been brought to the door by a
  young woman, apparently a housemaid. Thorndyke mounted the machine and rode
  away swiftly up the drive, and I turned back into the house, followed by the
  two women, who, now that the first shock had spent itself, were devoured by
  curiosity and eager to extract information.</p>

  <p>Their efforts in this direction, however, were not very successful, for,
  although the facts must very soon become public property, it seemed desirable
  at present to say as little as possible, while, as for any explanation of
  this extraordinary affair, I was as much in the dark as they were. So I
  maintained a discreet, though difficult, reticence until Thorndyke
  reappeared, when the two women retired and left us in possession of the
  room.</p>

  <p>'I sent our friend off with the note,' said my colleague 'and I told him
  enough to make sure that he will put on the pace. It is only about four
  miles, and as the police probably have a car, we may expect them pretty soon.
  I will just draft out a statement of the actual occurrences, and you had
  better write, on the same paper, a confirmatory declaration. We can read them
  to the officer and sign them in his presence.'</p>

  <p>He proceeded to write out a concise, but fairly full, narrative of what
  had befallen us in this house, with a brief statement of the nature of our
  business here, and when I had read it through, I wrote at the foot a
  paragraph confirming the statement and accepting it as my own. This occupied
  some considerable time, and we had not long finished when there was a
  somewhat peremptory ring at the bell, and a minute later, the elderly
  woman&mdash;whom I assumed to be the housekeeper&mdash;entered, accompanied
  by a police officer and a gentleman in civilian clothes. The former
  introduced himself briefly and got to business without preamble.</p>

  <p>'Concerning this note, sir,' said he, 'you have given no particulars. I
  suppose there is no doubt that Mr Blake and his valet are really dead?'</p>

  <p>'I should say there is no doubt at all,' replied Thorndyke. 'But I have
  written out a statement of the particulars, from which you will be able to
  judge. Shall I read it to you?'</p>

  <p>'I think the doctor had better see the bodies first,' was the reply.</p>

  <p>'Certainly,' agreed the doctor. 'We don't want to waste precious time on
  statements. Where are they?'</p>

  <p>'I will take you to them,' said Thorndyke, 'but I must tell you that they
  are shut in a room which is filled with the vapour of hydrocyanic acid.'</p>

  <p>The two men gave a startled look at Thorndyke, and as he led the way out
  into the hall and across the new wing, they followed, talking together
  earnestly but in low tones. Presently they overtook us, and the officer
  remarked:</p>

  <p>'This is a very extraordinary affair, sir. Has no attempt been made to get
  these men out of that room?'</p>

  <p>'No,' replied Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>'But why not?'</p>

  <p>'I think you will see when you get there.'</p>

  <p>'But,' exclaimed the doctor, 'surely some effort ought to have been made
  to save them! You don't mean to say that you have left them in that poisoned
  air and made no attempt even to open the doors and windows?'</p>

  <p>'We have opened some of the neighbouring windows,' said Thorndyke; and he
  proceeded to give a description of the secret chamber and its surroundings,
  to which the doctor listened with pursed-up lips.</p>

  <p>'Well,' he remarked dryly, 'you seem to have been very careful. Is it much
  farther?'</p>

  <p>'It opens out of the next room but one,' replied Thorndyke, and as he
  spoke I detected in the air a very faint odour of bitter almonds. I fancy the
  doctor noticed it, too, but he made no remark, and when we reached the end of
  the corridor and Thorndyke indicated the door that gave access to the room,
  both men hurried forward. The doctor turned the handle and flung the door
  open, and he and the officer stepped briskly across the threshold. And then
  they both stopped short, and I guessed that they had seen the dead rat. The
  next moment they both backed out hastily and the doctor slammed the door
  behind him and followed us to the discreet distance at which we had
  halted.</p>

  <p>'The vapour is as you say,' said the latter, visibly crestfallen, 'in an
  extreme state of concentration.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' agreed Thorndyke, 'but it is much less than it was. If you will go
  a little farther away, I will throw the door open and we can then retire and
  let the vapour diffuse out.'</p>

  <p>'Do you think it safe, sir?' queried the officer. 'There's a fearful reek
  in there'; then, as Thorndyke approached the door, he and the doctor (and I)
  walked away quickly up the corridor; and looking back, I saw my colleague,
  pinching his nostrils together, fling the door wide open and hurry after
  us.</p>

  <p>When we had retired to a safe distance, the officer halted and said:</p>

  <p>'You were saying something about a statement, sir. Shall we have it now? I
  don't understand this affair in the least.'</p>

  <p>Thorndyke produced the statement from his pocket and proceeded to read it
  aloud; and as he read, the two men listened with growing astonishment and not
  very completely concealed incredulity. When he had finished, I read out my
  statement, and then we both signed the document, the officer adding his
  signature as the witness.</p>

  <p>'Well.' he said, as he put the paper in his pocket-book, 'this is a most
  extraordinary story. Can you give any kind of explanation?'</p>

  <p>'At the moment,' replied Thorndyke, 'I am not proposing to go beyond the
  actual occurrence&mdash;certainly not until I have seen the bodies.'</p>

  <p>The officer looked dissatisfied, and naturally enough. On the facts
  presented, he would have been quite justified in arresting us both on a
  suspicion of murder; and indeed, but for Thorndyke's eminent position and my
  own status as a King's Counsel, he would probably have done so. As it was, he
  contented himself with the expression of a hope that we should presently be
  able to throw some light on the mystery, on which remark my colleague offered
  no comment.</p>

  <p>When about half an hour had passed, Thorndyke suggested that the vapour
  had probably cleared off from the room out of which the secret chamber opened
  and that it might now be possible to open the door of the chamber itself. Our
  friends were somewhat dubious, however. The sight of the dead rat had
  effectually dissipated the doctor's enthusiasm and engendered a very
  wholesome caution.</p>

  <p>'Perhaps,' said Thorndyke, 'as my friend and I know where to find the
  concealed fastenings of the door, we could open it more safely. What do you
  say, Anstey?'</p>

  <p>I was not much more eager than the doctor, but as Thorndyke would
  certainly have gone alone if I had refused, I assented with assumed
  readiness, and we started down the corridor, followed at a little distance by
  the other two. On entering the room, in which the odour of the poison had now
  become quite faint, Thorndyke opened both the casements wide and then slid
  the block of wood close up to the foot of the door.</p>

  <p>'Now,' said he, 'when I say "ready," take a deep breath, close your mouth,
  pinch your nostrils, and then push in the right-hand boss. I will press the
  other one and open and fix the door. Ready!'</p>

  <p>I pushed in the boss, and immediately afterwards Thorndyke pressed in the
  other one. The door yielded, and as we pushed it wide open, he thrust the
  block in after it. Glancing in, I had a momentary glimpse of the dark chamber
  with the two dead men lying huddled on the floor and an extinguished lantern
  by the side of the nearer one. It was but the vision of an instant, for
  almost as the door opened, I turned with Thorndyke and ran out of the room;
  but in that instant it was imprinted on my memory for ever. Even as I write,
  I can see with horrible vividness that dark, gloomy hold and the two
  sprawling corpses stretched towards the door that had cut them off in the
  moment of their crime from the land of the living.</p>

  <p>The first breath that I took, as I came out of the room, made me aware
  that the poisonous vapour was pouring out of the chamber of death. Our two
  friends had also noticed it and were already in full retreat, and we all made
  our way out of the old wing back to the library, there to wait until the
  poison should have become dissipated. The officer made one or two ineffectual
  efforts to extract from Thorndyke some explanation of the amazing events set
  forth in his statement, and then we settled down to a somewhat desultory
  conversation on subjects criminal and medical.</p>

  <p>We had been in the library rather more than half an hour and were
  beginning to discuss the possibility of removing the bodies, when the
  doorbell rang, and a few moments later the housekeeper entered, followed by
  Sir Lawrence Drayton, Winifred, and Mr Brodribb, The latter came in with a
  genial and knowing smile, which faded with remarkable suddenness as his eye
  lighted on the police officer.</p>

  <p>'Why, what the deuce is the matter?' exclaimed Sir Lawrence as he also
  observed the officer.</p>

  <p>'The matter is,' replied Thorndyke, 'that there has been a tragedy. Mr
  Blake is dead.'</p>

  <p>'Dead!' exclaimed Drayton and Brodribb in unison.</p>

  <p>'And what.' asked the former, 'do you mean by a tragedy?'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps,' said Thorndyke, 'the officer would allow me to read you the
  written statement that I have given him. I may say,' he added, addressing the
  officer 'that this lady and these gentlemen are interested parties and that
  they will all be called as witnesses at the inquest.'</p>

  <p>This latter statement, utterly incomprehensible to me, seemed to be
  equally so to every one else present. Sir Lawrence and Brodribb stared in
  astonishment at Thorndyke, while the officer, with a frown of perplexity,
  slowly took the statement from his pocket-book and handed it to my colleague
  without a word. Thereupon the latter, having waited for the housekeeper to
  withdraw, read the statement aloud, and I watched the amazement growing on
  the faces of the listeners as he read.</p>

  <p>'But, my dear Thorndyke!' Sir Lawrence exclaimed, when he had finished,
  'this is a most astounding affair. It looks as if this search had been a mere
  pretext to get you here and murder you!'</p>

  <p>'That, I have no doubt, is the case,' said Thorndyke, 'and that I
  suspected to be the object when Brodribb conveyed the invitation to me.'</p>

  <p>'The devil you did!' said Brodribb. 'But why should you suspect that Blake
  wanted to murder you?'</p>

  <p>'I think,' replied Thorndyke, 'that when we have seen the bodies you will
  be able to answer that question yourself. And I should say,' he added,
  turning to the doctor, 'that it would now be possible to get the bodies out.
  Most of the fumes will have blown away by this time.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' the doctor agreed, evidently all agog to see and hear the
  explanation of this mystery. 'We had better get a sheet from the housekeeper
  and then go and see if we can get those poor wretches out.'</p>

  <p>He set forth in company with the officer, and as soon as the two strangers
  had left the room, Brodribb attacked my colleague.</p>

  <p>'You are a most inscrutable fellow, Thorndyke. Do you mean to tell me that
  when you proposed this search, you were just planning to give this man,
  Blake, an opportunity to murder you?'</p>

  <p>'To try to murder me,' Thorndyke corrected.</p>

  <p>'And me,' I added. 'It begins to dawn on me that the post of junior to
  Thorndyke is no sinecure.'</p>

  <p>Brodribb smiled appreciatively, and Sir Lawrence remarked:</p>

  <p>'We seem to be navigating in deep waters. I must confess that I am
  completely out of my depth, but I suppose it is useless to make any
  appeal.'</p>

  <p>'I should rather say nothing more at present,' Thorndyke replied. 'In a
  few minutes I shall be able to make the crucial test which I expect will
  render explanations unnecessary.'</p>

  <p>I speculated on the meaning of this statement, but could make nothing of
  it, and I gathered from the perplexed expressions of the two lawyers that
  they were in a similar condition. But there was not much time to turn the
  matter over, for, very shortly, the police officer reappeared to announce
  that the bodies had been removed from the chamber and were ready for
  inspection and identification.</p>

  <p>'It will not be necessary, I suppose,' said Drayton, as we rose to
  accompany the officer, 'for Miss Blake to come with us?'</p>

  <p>'I think,' answered Thorndyke, 'that it is desirable and, in fact,
  necessary, that Miss Blake should see the bodies. I am sorry,' he added,
  'that she should be subjected to the unpleasantness, but the matter is really
  important.'</p>

  <p>'I can't imagine in what respect,' said Drayton, 'but if you say that it
  is, that settles the matter.'</p>

  <p>On this we set forth, Thorndyke and the officer leading the way, and as we
  crossed the great, desolate rooms I talked to Winifred about the old house
  and the secret chamber to divert her attention from our rather gruesome
  errand. At the end of the long corridor, as we entered the large room, we saw
  the doctor standing by two shrouded figures that lay on the floor near a
  window, with their feet towards us. We halted beside them in solemn silence,
  and the doctor stooped, and taking the two corners of the sheet, drew it
  away, with his eyes fixed on Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>For a moment we all stood looking down on the two still and ghastly
  figures without speaking a word; but suddenly Winifred uttered a cry of
  horror and started back, clutching my arm.</p>

  <p>'What is it?' demanded Drayton.</p>

  <p>The man!' she exclaimed breathlessly, pointing to the body of the valet,
  which I had already recognised. 'The man who tried to murder me in the empty
  house!'</p>

  <p>'And who stabbed you that night at Hampstead?' said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>'Yes, yes,' she gasped. 'It is he, I am certain of it.'</p>

  <p>Sir Lawrence turned a look of eager inquiry on my colleague.</p>

  <p>'This is an amazing thing,' he exclaimed. 'How on earth did this fellow
  come to be associated with Mr Blake?'</p>

  <p>Thorndyke stooped over the dead squire, and unfastening the collar and
  neckband, drew the shirt open at the throat. There came into sight a stout,
  silken cord encircling the neck, which Thorndyke gently pulled up, when I saw
  that there was suspended from it a small gold pendant with a single large
  stone. As the little jewel was drawn out from its hiding-place, Winifred
  stooped forward eagerly.</p>

  <p>'It is the Cat's Eye!' she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>'Impossible!' Sir Lawrence ejaculated. 'Let me look at it.'</p>

  <p>Thorndyke cut the cord and handed the pendant to Drayton, who turned it
  over in his hand, gazing at it with an expression of amazement and
  incredulity.</p>

  <p>'It is,' he said at length. 'This is certainly the pendant that was stolen
  from my poor brother's house. I recognise it without doubt by the shape and
  colour of the stone, and there is the inscription on the back, "Dulce Domum,"
  which I remember now. It is unquestionably the stolen pendant. But what does
  it mean, Thorndyke? You seemed to know that this man was wearing it.'</p>

  <p>'The meaning of it is, Sir Lawrence,' replied Thorndyke, 'that this
  man'&mdash;he pointed down at the dead squire&mdash;'is the man who murdered
  your brother. It was he who fired the pistol.'</p>

  <p>Sir Lawrence looked down at the dead man with a frown of disgust.</p>

  <p>'Do you mean to tell me, Thorndyke,' said he, 'that this man murdered poor
  Andrew just to get possession of this trumpery toy?'</p>

  <p>'I do,' replied Thorndyke, 'though, of course, the murder was not a part
  of the original plan. But he carried the pistol with him to use if
  necessary.'</p>

  <p>'He has got a pistol in his pocket now,' said the officer. 'I felt it as I
  was dragging him out of the secret room.'</p>

  <p>He plunged his hand into the dead man's coat pocket and drew out a small
  automatic pistol, which he handed to Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>This seems to be the very weapon,' said the latter; 'a Baby Browning. You
  remember that we identified the pattern from the empty cartridge-case.'</p>

  <p>I had noticed a peculiar expression of perplexity gathering on Mr
  Brodribb's face. Now the old solicitor turned to Thorndyke and said:</p>

  <p>'This is a very unaccountable affair, Thorndyke. We didn't know a great
  deal about Arthur Blake, but it always appeared that he was quite a decent
  sort of man, whereas this robbery and murder that he actually did commit, and
  the murder that he was attempting when he met his death, are cases of sheer
  ruffianism. I don't understand it.'</p>

  <p>Thorndyke turned to the doctor. 'Would you mind telling us,' said he, 'if
  there is anything abnormal in the condition of this man's left knee-cap?'</p>

  <p>The doctor stared at Thorndyke in astonishment. 'Have you any reason to
  suppose that there is?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'I have an impression,' was the reply, 'that there is an old fracture with
  imperfect ligamentous union.'</p>

  <p>The doctor stooped, and drawing up the trouser on the left side, placed
  his hand on the knee.</p>

  <p>'You are quite right,' he said, looking up at Thorndyke with an expression
  of surprise. There is a transverse fracture with a gap of fully two inches
  between the fragments.'</p>

  <p>Suddenly Mr Brodribb broke out eagerly with a look of intense curiosity at
  my colleague: 'It can't be! What is it that you are suggesting,
  Thorndyke?'</p>

  <p>'I am suggesting that this man was not Arthur Blake. I suggest that he was
  an Australian adventurer named Hugh Owen.'</p>

  <p>'But,' objected Brodribb, 'Owen was reported to have died some years ago.
  His body was found and identified.'</p>

  <p>'A mutilated skeleton was found,' retorted Thorndyke, 'and was identified
  as that of Hugh Owen by means of a ring which was known to have belonged to
  Owen. I suggest that the remains were those of Arthur Blake; that he had been
  murdered by Owen, and that the ring had been put on the body for the purpose
  of ensuring a false identification.'</p>

  <p>That is perfectly possible,' Brodribb admitted. Then who do you suggest
  that this other man is?'</p>

  <p>'I suggest that this other person is a woman named Laura Levinsky.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' said Brodribb, 'that need not be left a matter of guesswork. I
  don't think I mentioned it to you, but that Australian police official told
  me that Levinsky had a tattoo-mark on the right forearm&mdash;the letters H
  and L with a heart between. Let us see if this person has such a mark.'</p>

  <p>The police officer bent down over the dead valet, and unfastening the
  right wristband, drew the sleeve up above the elbow.</p>

  <p>'Ha!' exclaimed Brodribb as there were revealed, standing out on the
  greenish-white skin as if painted in blue ink, the letters H and L with a
  small, misshapen heart between them, 'you are right, Thorndyke, as you always
  are. And I suppose she was a party to the murder?'</p>

  <p>'I take it,' said Thorndyke, 'that these two wretches murdered Arthur
  Blake, removed all identifiable objects from the corpse, put Owen's ring on
  its finger, and tumbled it over the cliff, shooting down a mass of rocks and
  stones on top of it. Then they took possession of all Blake's papers and
  money and separated, coming to England on different ships. I assume that no
  measures were ever taken to verify Blake's identity?'</p>

  <p>'No,' replied Brodribb. There was no one who could identify him. He sent a
  letter, in answer to mine, saying when he would arrive. He arrived about the
  date mentioned, and presented all the necessary credentials. The question of
  identity was never raised.'</p>

  <p>For some moments we all stood looking down on the bodies of the two
  adventures in silence. Presently Drayton asked, holding out the pendant:</p>

  <p>'What is to be done with this? It was stolen from my brother, but it seems
  that, as it is an heirloom, it should be handed to Miss Blake.'</p>

  <p>'For the present,' said Thorndyke 'it must remain in the custody of the
  police, as it will have to be put in evidence at the inquest. We will take a
  receipt for it. But as to its being the missing heirloom, I doubt that very
  much. It does not agree with the description, and I should suppose that the
  original jewel will have been hidden with the title-deeds.'</p>

  <p>'That could hardly be,' said Winifred, 'though I agree with you that the
  inscription "Dulce domum" doesn't seem to be the right one. But you will
  remember that Percival's manuscript distinctly says that the jewel was taken
  away and given to Jenifer to keep for the child James.'</p>

  <p>'That is not my reading of the manuscript,' said Thorndyke. 'But we can
  discuss that on another occasion. If we give our respective names and
  addresses to the officer, we shall have concluded our business here.'</p>

  <p>At this hint, the officer produced a large, official notebook in which he
  entered the names and addresses of all the witnesses in the case, and when
  the doctor had once more covered the corpses with the sheet, we turned to
  retrace our steps to the library. As I walked along the corridor at
  Winifred's side, I glanced at her a little anxiously, for it had been a
  rather terrible experience. She met my glance, and resting her hand on my arm
  for a moment, she said in a low voice:</p>

  <p>'It was a gruesome sight, Robin, that poor little wretch lying there with
  that awful, fixed stare of horror on her face. But I couldn't feel sorry for
  her, nor even for the man, though there was something very
  dreadful&mdash;almost pitiful&mdash;in the way in which his dead hand
  clutched that little brass knob. It must have been a frightful moment when he
  found that the knob was useless and that he and his companion were caught in
  their own hideous trap. But I can't be sorry for them. I can only think of
  the relief to know that you are safe and that I am free.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said I, 'it is an unspeakable relief to feel that you can now go
  abroad in safety&mdash;that that continual menace is a thing of the past,
  thanks to Thorndyke's uncanny power of seeing through a stone wall.'</p>

  <p>'I am not sure 'said she 'that I am not disposed to quarrel with Dr
  Thorndyke for calmly walking you into this murderer's den.'</p>

  <p>'I don't think there was ever any real danger,' I replied. 'They couldn't
  have murdered us by overt methods, and as to the other methods, I have no
  doubt that Thorndyke had got them all calculated out in advance and provided
  for. He seems to foresee everything.'</p>

  <p>When we reached the library, and Thorndyke and I had replaced our pistols
  and jemmies in the suitcase (a proceeding which the police officer watched
  with bulging eyes and open mouth), Drayton asked:</p>

  <p>'Have you two got any sort of conveyance? Because, if you haven't, and you
  don't mind a pretty tight squeeze, I can give you a lift to the station.'</p>

  <p>We accepted the offer gladly; and having made our adieux to the officer
  and the doctor, we went out and packed ourselves and our impedimenta into the
  car as soon as the lawful occupants had taken their seats. As we moved off, I
  observed the housekeeper and two other women watching us with concentrated
  interest; and at the gate, as we swept past the lodge, I had an instantaneous
  glimpse of the keeper's face at the window, with another countenance that
  seemed reminiscent of the 'King's Head.'</p>

  <p>The swiftly-gliding car devoured the mile or two of road to the station in
  a few minutes. We drew up in the station yard, and while the chauffeur was
  handing out our luggage, Drayton stood up, and laying his hand on Thorndyke's
  shoulder, said earnestly:</p>

  <p>'I have spoken no word of thanks to you, Thorndyke, for what you have
  done, but I hope you understand that I am your debtor for life. Your
  management of this case is beyond my wildest expectations, and how you did
  it, I cannot imagine. Some day you must give me the intellectual satisfaction
  of hearing how the investigation was carried out. Now I can only congratulate
  you on your brilliant success.'</p>

  <p>'I should like to second that,' said Brodribb; 'and talking of success, I
  suppose you didn't find those deeds after all?'</p>

  <p>'No,' replied Thorndyke. 'They are not there.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, aren't they?' Brodribb. 'Then, if you are so certain where they are
  not, you probably know where they are?'</p>

  <p>'That seems a sound inference,' replied Thorndyke. 'But we can't discuss
  the matter here. If you care to come to my chambers tomorrow, at two o'clock,
  we might go into it further, and, in fact, conduct an exploration.'</p>

  <p>'Does that invitation include me?' Winifred asked.</p>

  <p>'Most undoubtedly,' he replied. 'You are the principal party to the
  transaction. And perhaps you might bring the Book of Hours with you.'</p>

  <p>'I believe he has got the deeds stowed away in his chambers,' said
  Brodribb; and although my colleague shook his head, I felt no certainty that
  the old lawyer was not right.</p>

  <p>When the car had moved off, we carried our cases into the station and were
  relieved to find that we had but a few minutes to wait for a train. I
  postponed my attack on my secretive colleague until we were snugly
  established in a compartment by ourselves. Not that I had any expectations.
  Thorndyke's reticence had conveyed to me the impression that the time for
  explanations had not yet come; and so it turned out when I proceeded to put
  my questions.</p>

  <p>'Wait till we have finished the case, Anstey,' said he. 'Then, if you have
  not worked out the scheme of the investigation in the interval, we can review
  and discuss it.'</p>

  <p>'But surely,' said I, 'we have finished with the case of the murder of
  Andrew Drayton?'</p>

  <p>'Not entirely,' he replied. 'What you have never realised, I think, is the
  connection between the problem of the murder and the problem of the missing
  documents. This is a very curious and interesting case, and those two
  problems have a very strange connection. But for Owen's determination to
  possess the cat's eye pendant at all costs, those documents might have lain
  in their hiding-place, unsuspected, for centuries.'</p>

  <p>This statement, while it explained Thorndyke's hitherto unaccountable
  interest in Percy Blake's claim, only plunged the other problem into deeper
  obscurity. During the remainder of the journey I tried to reconstitute the
  train of events to see if I could trace the alleged connection between the
  two problems. But not a glimmer of light could I see in any direction; and in
  the end I gave it up, consoling myself with the reflection that the morrow
  would probably see the last act played out and that then I might hope for a
  final elucidation.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19"></a>XIX. &mdash; A RELIC OF THE '45</h2>

  <p class="first">At two o'clock punctually, on the following afternoon, our
  visitors made their appearance; and at the very moment when the last of
  them&mdash;Mr Brodribb&mdash;emerged from Crown Office Row, I observed from
  the window two taxi-cabs, which had entered successively by the Tudor Street
  gate, draw up before our door. I hailed their arrival with deep satisfaction,
  for the strange events of the previous day, together with Thorndyke's rather
  mysterious observations thereon, had made me impatient to see the end of this
  intricate case and intensely curious to hear how my inscrutable colleague had
  managed to fit together the apparently unrelated fragments of this
  extraordinarily complex puzzle. Throughout the morning&mdash;while Thorndyke
  was absent, and, as I suspected, arranging details of the afternoon's
  adventure&mdash;I had turned over the facts again and again, but always with
  the same result. There were the pieces of the puzzle, and no doubt a complete
  set; but separate pieces they remained, and obstinately refused to join up
  into anything resembling an intelligible whole.</p>

  <p>'I see, Thorndyke,' said Mr Brodribb as he entered, smiling, rosy, and
  looking as if he had just come out of a bandbox, 'that I did you an
  injustice. You have not been sitting on the deeds. The chariots are at the
  door waiting, I suppose, for the band or the stavebearers. We shall be quite
  an imposing procession.'</p>

  <p>'We won't wait for the band.' said Thorndyke. 'As we are all here, we may
  as well start. Will you conduct Miss Blake down, Anstey?'</p>

  <p>'Do I give any directions to the driver?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'Yes. You can tell him to put you down at the north-east corner of the
  Minories.'</p>

  <p>Accordingly I led the way with Winifred, and having given the destination
  to the driver, bestowed my charge and myself in the cab. The driver started
  the engine, and as the cab made a sweep round to the Tudor Street gate, I
  heard the door of the other cab slam.</p>

  <p>'Have you any idea where we are going, Robin?' Winifred asked as the cab
  whirled round into New Bridge Street.</p>

  <p>'None beyond what I have communicated to the driver,' I replied.
  'Apparently we are going to explore the Minories or Aldgate or Whitechapel.
  It is an ancient neighbourhood, and in the days of Percival Blake it was
  somewhat more aristocratic than it is now. There are good many old houses
  still standing about there. You may have seen that picturesque group of
  timber houses looking on Whitechapel High Street. They are nearly all
  butchers' shops, and have been, at least, since the days of Charles the
  Second; in fact, the group is known as Butcher Row, though I think there is
  an old tavern among them.'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps we are going to the tavern,' said Winifred. 'It is quite likely.
  Many of the old inns had secret hiding-places and must have been the
  favourite rendezvous of the conspirators of those times.'</p>

  <p>She continued to speculate on the possibilities of the ancient tavern,
  which had evidently captured her romantic fancy, and as I looked at
  her-pink-cheeked, bright-eyed, and full of pleasurable excitement over our
  adventurous quest&mdash;I once more breathed a sigh of thankfulness that the
  dark days of ever-impending peril were over.</p>

  <p>It seemed but a few minutes before the cab drew up at the corner of the
  Minories; and we had hardly alighted when the other vehicle arrived and
  disgorged its occupants at our side. The drivers having been paid (and having
  thereafter compared notes and settled themselves to watch our further
  proceedings), Thorndyke turned his face eastward and we started together
  along Whitechapel High Street. I noticed that, now, no one asked any
  questions. Probably each of us was busy with his own speculations; and in any
  case, Thorndyke maintained a sphinx-like reticence.</p>

  <p>'Are those delightful old houses the ones you were speaking of?' Winifred
  asked as the ancient, plaster-fronted buildings came in sight.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' I answered. 'That is Butcher Row.</p>

  <p>'Or,' said Thorndyke, 'to give it what is, I believe, its official title,
  "The Shambles", though the shambles proper are at the back.'</p>

  <p>'The Shambles!' exclaimed Winifred, looking at Thorndyke with a startled
  expression. She appeared to be about to ask him some question, but at this
  moment he turned sharply into a narrow alley, into which we followed him. I
  glanced up at the name as we entered and read it aloud&mdash;'Harrow
  Alley.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Thorndyke, 'quite a historic little thoroughfare. Defoe gives
  a very vivid description of its appearance during the Plague, with the
  dead-cart waiting at the entrance and the procession of bearers carrying the
  corpses down the narrow court. Here is the old "Star and Still" tavern, and
  round the corner there are the shambles, very little changed since the
  seventeenth century.'</p>

  <p>He turned the corner towards the shambles, and then, crossing the narrow
  road, dived through an archway into a narrow paved court, along which we had
  to go in single file. This court presently opened into a squalid-looking
  little square, surrounded on three sides by tall, ancient, timber and plaster
  houses, the fourth side being occupied by a rather mean, but quaint little
  church with a low brick tower. Thorndyke made his way directly to the west
  door of the church, and taking from his pocket a key of portentous size,
  inserted it into the lock. As he did so I glanced at the board that was fixed
  beside the doorway, from which I learned that this was the church of St Peter
  by the Minories.</p>

  <p>As the door swung open Thorndyke motioned to us to enter. We filed in, and
  then he drew the door to after us and locked it from the inside. We stood for
  a few moments in the dim porch under the tower, looking in through the
  half-opened inner door; and as we stood there, Winifred grasped my arm
  nervously, and I could feel that her hand was trembling. But there was no
  time for speech, for as Thorndyke locked the door and withdrew the key, the
  inner door opened wide and two men&mdash;one tall and one
  short&mdash;appeared silhouetted against the east window.</p>

  <p>These are my friends, of whom I spoke to you,' said Thorndyke. 'Miss
  Blake, Sir Lawrence Drayton, Mr Brodribb, Mr Anstey&mdash;the Reverend James
  Yersbury. I think you have met this other gentleman.'</p>

  <p>We came out into the body of the church, and having made my bow to the
  clergyman, I turned to the smaller man.</p>

  <p>'Why, it's Mr Polton!' exclaimed Winifred, shaking hands heartily with my
  colleague's familiar; who greeted us with a smile of such ecstatic
  crinkliness, that I instantly suspected him of preparing some necromantic
  surprise for us.</p>

  <p>'This is quite a remarkable building,' said Sir Lawrence, looking about
  him with lively interest, 'and it appears the more striking by contrast with
  the shabby, commonplace exterior.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' agreed the clergyman, 'that is rather characteristic of old London
  churches. But this is rather an ancient structure; it was only partially
  destroyed by the Great Fire and was almost immediately rebuilt, at the
  personal cost, it is said, of the Duke of York, afterwards James the Second.
  Perhaps that accounts for the strong Jacobite leanings of some of the later
  clergy, such as this good gentleman, for instance.'</p>

  <p>He led us to a space between two of the windows where a good-sized tablet
  of alabaster had been let into the wall.</p>

  <p>'That tablet,' said he, 'encloses a cavity which is filled with bones
  piously collected from the field of Culloden, and the inscription leaves one
  in no doubt as to the sentiments of the collector. But I believe it was
  covered with plaster soon after it was put up, to preserve it from
  destruction, by the authorities, and it was only discovered about fifty years
  ago.'</p>

  <p>I read the brief inscription with growing curiosity:</p>

  <p>PRO PATRIA&mdash;PRO REGE 1745</p>

  <p>'This Tablet was raised to the Memory of the Faithful by Stephen Rumbold,
  sometime Rector of this Church.'</p>

  <p>'But,' said Winifred, 'I thought Stephen Rumbold was rector of St Peter by
  the Shambles.'</p>

  <p>'This is St Peter by the Shambles,' replied Mr Yersbury. 'The name has
  only been changed within the last forty years.'</p>

  <p>Winifred faced me and looked with eager delight into my eyes, and I knew
  that the same thought was in both our minds. Here, during all the
  slowly-passing years, the missing deeds had rested, securely hidden with the
  bones of those patriots at whose side Percival Blake had fought on the fatal
  field of Culloden. I looked round at Thorndyke, expecting to see some
  preparations to open this curious little burial-place. But he had already
  turned away and was moving towards the east end of the church. We followed
  him slowly until he halted before the pulpit, where he stood for a few
  moments looking at it reflectively. It was a very remarkable pulpit. I have
  never seen another at all resembling it. In shape it was an elongated
  octagon, the panels and mouldings of deep brown oak enriched with magnificent
  carving. But the most singular feature was the manner in which it was
  supported. The oblong super-structure rested on twin pillars of oak, each
  pillar being furnished with a handsome, floridly-ornamented bronze capital
  and a bronze base of somewhat similar character. But fine as the workmanship
  was, the design was more unusual than pleasing. The oblong body and the twin
  pillars had, in fact, a rather ungainly appearance.</p>

  <p>'Here,' said Thorndyke, pointing to the pulpit, 'is another relic of the
  Reverend Stephen Rumbold, and one of more personal interest to us than the
  other. You notice these twin pillars. Aesthetically, they are not all that
  might be desired, but they serve a useful purpose besides supporting the
  upper structure, for each of them forms an aumbry, originally designed, no
  doubt, to conceal the sacred vessels and other objects used in celebrating
  Mass or Vespers or in administering Communion in accordance with the rites of
  the Church of Rome. One of them is still discharging this function. This
  pillar'&mdash;here he tapped the northern one of the pair&mdash;'contains a
  chalice and paten, a thurible and a small pyx. This other pillar
  contains&mdash;well, Polton will show us what it contains, so I need not go
  into particulars.'</p>

  <p>'Do I understand,' Drayton asked, 'that you have opened the aumbries
  already and verified the existence and nature of the contents?'</p>

  <p>'We have not yet opened the aumbries,' Thorndyke replied, 'but we have
  ascertained that the things are there untouched. Polton and I made an
  examination some days ago with an X-ray apparatus and a fluorescent screen.
  It was then that we discovered the plate in the second pillar. I wished Miss
  Blake to be present at the actual opening.'</p>

  <p>At these words, like an actor taking up a cue, Polton appeared from
  somewhere behind the pulpit bearing a good-sized leather handbag. This he
  deposited on the floor, and as we gathered round, he took from it a small,
  rounded mallet, apparently of lead, covered with leather, and a tool of hard
  wood, somewhat, in shape, like a caulking chisel.</p>

  <p>'Which pillar shall I begin on, sir?' he inquired, looking round with a
  sly smile. 'The one with church plate or&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Oh, hang the church plate!' interposed Brodribb, adding hastily: 'I beg
  your pardon, Mr Yersbury, but you know&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Exactly,' interrupted the clergyman, 'I quite agree with you. The church
  plate will keep for another half hour.'</p>

  <p>Thereupon Polton fell to work, and we crowded up close to watch. The
  capitals of the pillars presented each two parts, a lower member, covered
  with ornament, and above this a plain, cylindrical space extending up to the
  abacus. It was to the lower part that Polton directed his attention. Having
  mounted on a chair, he placed the edge of the hardwood chisel against the
  lower edge of the ornamented member and struck it gently with the leaden
  mallet. Then he shifted the chisel half an inch to the right and struck
  another blow, and in this way he continued, moving the chisel half an inch
  after each stroke, until he had travelled a third of the way round the
  pillar, when Thorndyke placed another chair for him to step on.</p>

  <p>'Have you oiled the surface?' my colleague asked.</p>

  <p>'Yes, sir,' replied Polton, tapping away like Old Mortality; 'I flooded it
  with a mixture of paraffin and clock oil, and it is moving all right.'</p>

  <p>We were soon able to verify this statement, for when Polton had made a
  complete circuit of the pillar, the plain space above had grown perceptibly
  narrower and a ring of lighter-coloured wood began to appear below. Still,
  the leaden mallet continued to deliver its dull sounding taps, and still
  Polton continued to creep round the pillar.</p>

  <p>By the time the second circuit was completed, the sliding part of the
  capital had risen half-way to the top of the plain space, as was shown by the
  width of paler, newly-uncovered wood below. And now the sliding member was
  evidently moving more freely, for there was a perceptible upward movement at
  each stroke, so that, by the end of the third circuit, the upper, plain space
  had disappeared altogether and a narrow ring of metal appeared below; and in
  this ring I perceived a notch about half an inch wide.</p>

  <p>'I think she's all clear now, sir,' said Polton.</p>

  <p>'Very well,' said Thorndyke. 'We are all ready.'</p>

  <p>He relieved Polton of the mallet and chisel and handed him a tool which
  looked somewhat like a rather slender jemmy with a long, narrow beak. This
  beak Polton inserted carefully into the notch, when it evidently entered a
  cavity in the top of the woodwork. Then he began cautiously to prise at the
  end of the lever.</p>

  <p>For a moment or two nothing happened. Suddenly there was a grating sound;
  the end of the lever rose, and at the same instant about a quarter of the
  pillar began to separate from the rest and come forward, showing a joint
  which had been cunningly hidden by the deep fluting. Polton grasped the top
  of the loose panel, and with a sharp pull, drew it right out and lifted it
  clear, but as he was in front of the opening, none of us could see what was
  within. Then he stepped down from the chair, and Winifred uttered a little
  cry and clasped her hands.</p>

  <p>It was certainly a dramatic moment, especially to those of us who had read
  the manuscript in the little Book of Hours. The pillar was a great shell
  enclosing a considerable cavity, and in this cavity, standing on the floor,
  was a tall leaden jar with a close-fitting, flat lid; and on the lid stood a
  great, two-handled posset-pot. It was all exactly as Percival Blake had
  described it, and to us, who had formed a mental picture from that
  description, there was something very moving in being thus confronted with
  those strangely familiar objects, which had been waiting in their
  hiding-place for more than a century and a half-waiting for the visit of
  Percival's dispossessed posterity.</p>

  <p>For some time we stood looking at them in silence. At length Thorndyke
  said: 'You notice, Miss Blake, that there is an inscription on the jar.'</p>

  <p>I had not observed it, nor had Winifred; but we now advanced, and looking
  closely at the jar, made out with some difficulty on the whitened surface an
  inscription which had apparently been punched into the metal letter by
  letter, and which read:</p>

  <p>'The Contents hereof are the Property of Percival Blake, MD of Beauchamp
  Blake in Buckinghamshire, or the Heirs of his Body AD 1746.'</p>

  <p>'That,' said Sir Lawrence, as Winifred read the inscription aloud,
  'settles the ownership of the documents. You can take possession of the jar
  and its contents with perfect confidence. And now perhaps it would be as well
  to see what is inside the jar.'</p>

  <p>Polton, who had apparently been waiting for this cue, now lit a small
  spirit blow-pipe. The posset-pot was tenderly lifted out by Winifred and
  deposited on a pew-bench, and Polton, having hoisted out the jar and placed
  it on a chair, began cautiously to let the flame of the blow-pipe play on the
  joint of the lid, which had been thickly coated with wax. When the wax began
  to liquefy, he introduced the edge of the jemmy into the joint, and with a
  deft turn of the wrist, raised the lid, which he then took off.</p>

  <p>Winifred peered into the jar and announced: 'It seems to be full of
  rolled-up parchments; a statement which we all verified in turn.</p>

  <p>'I would suggest; said Mr Yersbury, 'that we carry the jar into the
  vestry. There is a good-sized table there, which will be a convenience if you
  are going to examine the documents.'</p>

  <p>This suggestion was instantly agreed to. Polton took up the rather
  ponderous jar and made his way to the vestry under the guidance of the
  clergyman, and the rest of us followed, Winifred carrying-the precious
  posset-pot. Arrived at the vestry, Polton set down the jar on the table, and
  Sir Lawrence proceeded at once to extract the roll of stiff and yellow
  parchment and vellum documents. Unrolling them carefully&mdash;for they were
  set into a rigid cylinder&mdash;he glanced over them quickly with the air of
  one looking for some particular thing.</p>

  <p>'These are undoubtedly the title-deeds,' he said, still turning over the
  pages quickly with but a cursory glance at their contents, 'but&mdash;ha!
  Yes. These are what we really wanted. I had hoped that we should find them
  here.'</p>

  <p>He drew out from between the leaves of the deeds two small squares of
  parchment which he exhibited triumphantly and then read aloud:</p>

  <p>'I hereby certify and declare that on the thirteenth day of June in the
  Year of Our Lord seventeen hundred and forty-two, at the church of St Peter
  by the Shambles, near by Aldgate, the following persons were by me joined
  together in Holy Matrimony to wit PERCIVAL BLAKE of Beauchamp Blake in the
  County of Buckinghamshire, Bachelor and JUDITH WESTERN of Cricklewood in the
  County of Middlesex, Spinster.</p>

  <p>'STEPHEN RUMBOLD, MA, Rector of the said Church of St Peter by the
  Shambles. 20th May 1746.'</p>

  <p>'That,' said Sir Lawrence, 'is what principally matters, but this second
  certificate clenches the proof. I will read it out:</p>

  <p>'I hereby certify and declare that James the Son of Percival and Judith
  Blake of Beauchamp Blake in the County of Buckinghamshire was baptized by me
  according to the rites of Holy Church on the thirtieth of May in the Year of
  Our Lord seventeen hundred and forty-three at the Church of St Peter by the
  Shambles near by Aldgate.</p>

  <p>STEPHEN RUMBOLD, MA, Rector of the said Church of St Peter by the
  Shambles. 20th May 1746.'</p>

  <p>'That,' continued Drayton, 'with the other certificates, which I
  understand you have, establishes a direct descent. And seeing that the estate
  is at present without an owner, this is a peculiarly opportune moment for
  putting forward a claim. What do you say, Brodribb?'</p>

  <p>'I should like,' said Brodribb, 'to have fuller particulars before giving
  a definite opinion.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, come, Brodribb,' Sir Lawrence protested, 'you needn't be so
  infernally cautious. We're all friends, you know. Would you be prepared to
  act for Miss Blake?'</p>

  <p>'I don't see why not,' replied Brodribb. 'I am not committed to any other
  claimant. Yes, I should be very happy to act for her.'</p>

  <p>'Then,' said Drayton, 'we must arrange a consultation and find out exactly
  how we stand. I will call at your office for a preliminary talk tomorrow, if
  that will suit you.'</p>

  <p>'Very well,' agreed Brodribb, 'come in at one o'clock, and we can lunch
  together and talk over the preliminaries.'</p>

  <p>While this conversation was proceeding, I had observed Thorndyke peering
  inquisitively into the now empty jar. From this he transferred his attention
  to the posset-pot which Winifred was guarding jealously. It was a fine
  specimen of its kind, a comparatively large vessel of many-coloured
  slip-ware. On the front was a sort of escutcheon, on which was a heart
  surmounted by a B with the letters H and M on either side and the date 1708
  below. Just under the rim was a broad band bearing the following quaint
  inscription:</p>

  <p>'Here is the Gest of the Barly Korne, Glad Ham I the child is
  Borne.&mdash;JM'</p>

  <p>'Isn't it a lovely old thing?' murmured Winifred. 'So human and personal
  and so charming too.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' Thorndyke agreed 'it is a fine piece of work. Old Martin was
  something more than a common village potter. Have you looked inside it?'</p>

  <p>'No,' replied Winifred. She took the knob in her fingers and delicately
  lifted off the cover; and then she uttered a cry of surprise.</p>

  <p>'Why,' she exclaimed, 'it is the Cat's Eye-the real cat's eye this time.
  And what a beauty!'</p>

  <p>She lifted out of the pot a small pendant, curiously like the other
  one&mdash;so much so, in fact, as to suggest that the latter had been a copy.
  But, whereas the stone in the counterfeit had been a rather dull grey, this
  one was of a beautiful deep yellow with a brilliant streak of golden light.
  Attached to the pendant was a slender gold chain and a clasp, which, like the
  pendant itself, was smooth and rounded with years of wear. After gazing for a
  while at the flashing stone, Winifred turned the pendant over and looked at
  the back. The inscription was half-obliterated by wear, but we read without
  difficulty:</p>

  <p>'God's Providence is Mine Inheritance.'</p>

  <p>'It is extremely appropriate,' she commented when she had read it aloud,
  'though it isn't quite what one expected. But what I don't understand is how
  it comes to be here. Percival distinctly says that he had the jewel and that
  he intended to give it to Jenifer to keep for the child.'</p>

  <p>'Not the jewel,' Thorndyke corrected. 'He speaks of "the bauble" and "the
  trinket," never of "the jewel."'</p>

  <p>'You think he was referring to some other trinket?'</p>

  <p>'Obviously,' replied Thorndyke. And then, looking at Winifred with a
  smile, he exclaimed: 'O blind generation! Don't you see. Miss Blake, that
  events have shaped themselves precisely as Percival designed? Here is his
  descendant, the child of his children's children, coming to the hiding-place
  wearing the precious bauble around her neck and guided by it to the
  possessions of her fathers. Could anything be more complete?'</p>

  <p>Winifred was thunderstruck. For a while she sat, motionless as a statue,
  gazing at Thorndyke in speechless amazement. At length she exclaimed: 'But
  this is astounding, Dr Thorndyke! Do you mean that this little locket is the
  trinket that was given to Jenifer and which she lost?'</p>

  <p>'Undoubtedly,' he replied, 'and the really strange and romantic
  circumstance is that it was given into your hand by the very impostor who was
  seeking to rob you for ever of your inheritance.'</p>

  <p>'Then,' exclaimed Sir Lawrence, who was almost as overcome as Winifred
  herself, 'it was actually poor Andrew's "little Sphinx" that gave you the
  clue to this hiding-place?'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' replied Thorndyke, 'only the sphinx was really an oracle, just
  waiting for the question to be asked.'</p>

  <p>Winifred's eyes filled. Impulsively she grasped my colleague's hand,
  murmuring shakily: 'What can I say to you, Dr Thorndyke? How can I ever thank
  you for all that you have done for my brother and me?'</p>

  <p>'You need say nothing,' he replied 'but that which is written on the back
  of the cat's eye.'</p>

  <p>Our business being now concluded, Sir Lawrence carefully returned the
  precious documents to the jar and replaced the cover. From without, a dull
  tapping that had been audible for some time past, had told us that Polton was
  at work on the second pillar. But that was no concern of ours.</p>

  <p>'What are we going to do now?' asked Sir Lawrence. 'It seems as if we
  should mark the occasion in some way.'</p>

  <p>'I agree with you, Drayton,' said Thorndyke, 'and I have, in fact,
  arranged a little festival at my chambers; just a simple tavern dinner, since
  Polton was otherwise engaged. Will that satisfy the requirements?'</p>

  <p>'It will satisfy mine,' replied Drayton, 'and I think I can answer for
  Brodribb.'</p>

  <p>'Then,' said Thorndyke, 'if Miss Blake will consent to combine the
  function of hostess with that of principal guest, we will capture Polton and
  betake ourselves to the Temple.'</p>

  <p>We strolled out into the church, where Polton and the rector were
  gloatingly examining the newly-recovered sacred vessels, and having thanked
  the friendly clergyman and bidden him a warm farewell, we went forth in
  search of conveyances. Polton heading the procession with the heavy jar under
  his arm, and Winifred tenderly carrying the posset-pot swathed in her silken
  shawl.</p>

  <p>In Whitechapel High Street we had the unexpected good fortune to encounter
  an unoccupied taxi-cab, which was by universal consent assigned to Winifred,
  Polton, and me. In this we bestowed ourselves and were forthwith spirited
  away, leaving our companions to follow as best they could. But they were not
  far behind, for we had barely arrived in the chambers and disposed of our
  treasure-trove, when a second cab drew up in King's Bench Walk and our three
  friends made their appearance at the rendezvous.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch20"
     id="ch20"></a>XX. &mdash; QED</h2>

  <p class="first">To an enthusiastic and truly efficient gourmet it might be
  difficult to assess the respective merits of the different stages of a really
  good dinner; to compare the satisfactions yielded, for instance, by the first
  tentative approaches&mdash;the little affairs of outposts&mdash;with the
  voracious joy of the grand onslaught on tangible and manducable solids; or
  again with the placid diminuendo, the half-hearted rear-guard actions,
  concerned with the unsubstantial trifles on which defeated appetite delivers
  its expiring kick. For my own part, I can offer no opinion&mdash;at any rate,
  without refreshing my memory as to the successive sensations; but I recall
  that as our dinner drew to a close, signs of expectancy began to manifest
  themselves (in Mr Brodribb's case they seemed to be associated with the
  advent of the port decanter), and when Polton had evacuated the casualties to
  an aid-post established in the adjacent office, Sir Lawrence gave expression
  to the prevailing state of mind.</p>

  <p>'I suppose, Thorndyke, you know what is expected of you?'</p>

  <p>Thorndyke turned an impassive face towards his guest. 'On these triumphal
  occasions,' said he, 'I usually smoke a Trichinopoly cigar. On this occasion,
  I presume, I am expected to refrain.'</p>

  <p>'Not at all,' replied Drayton. 'I think we can endure the Trichy with
  reasonable fortitude; what we can't endure is the agony of curiosity. We
  demand enlightenment.'</p>

  <p>'You want to know how the "little Sphinx" answered its own riddle. Is that
  your demand?'</p>

  <p>'I understood you to say,' said I, 'that the problem of the crime and that
  of the missing deeds were one and the same.'</p>

  <p>'I said that they were closely connected. But if you want an exposition of
  the unravelment, it will be more convenient to take them separately and in
  the order in which they were presented. In which case we begin with the
  crime.'</p>

  <p>He paused, and I saw him glance with an indulgent smile towards the office
  door which was incompletely closed, and from which issued faint sounds of
  furtive movement which informed us that Polton had elected to take his dinner
  within earshot of the exposition.</p>

  <p>'We had better begin,' he proceeded, 'with the facts presented to us on
  the night of the tragedy. First as to the criminals. There were traces of two
  men, and only two. One of these was a tall man, as shown by the size of his
  feet. He appeared to suffer from some weakness of the left leg. The sound of
  his footsteps, as heard by Anstey, suggested a slightly lame man, but as he
  ran away rapidly he could not have been very lame. Yet there was some
  distinct disability, since he had to draw up a garden seat to enable him to
  get over a fence which we climbed easily; and the faint impression of the
  left foot under the fence showed that, when he jumped down, the weight was
  taken principally by the right. Examination of the cast of his left hand
  showed a depressed scar on the tip of the forefinger. We also gathered that
  he carried a Baby Browning pistol and appeared to be a skilful pistol
  shot.</p>

  <p>'Of the other man we learned less. He was noticeably small and slight; he
  was left-handed; he had dark hair, and at the time of the robbery he was
  wearing gloves, apparently of kid or thin leather. But later, when examining
  the tuft of his hair that was found grasped by the deceased, we made an
  important discovery. Among those dark hairs was a single blonde
  hair&mdash;not white, but golden&mdash;which could not have come from his own
  head. Of its presence there seemed to be only two possible explanations:
  either it had been rubbed off, or had fallen from the head of some other
  person, or it had become detached from the inside of a wig. But the first
  explanation was ruled out&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'How?' demanded Brodribb.</p>

  <p>'By its appearance under the microscope. When you find an alien hair, on
  your coat-sleeve, for instance&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I don't,' said Brodribb, 'at my time of life.'</p>

  <p>'&mdash;If you examine it under the microscope, or even with a strong
  lens, you will invariably find it to be a dead hair&mdash;a hair which has
  completed its growth and dropped out of its sheath. You can identify it by
  the presence of the complete bulb and the absence of the inner root-sheath
  (which would be adherent to it if it had been pulled out while growing).
  Well, this blonde hair had no bulb. It had both ends broken, which suggested
  unusual brittleness, as if it had been treated with some bleach, such as
  chlorine or hydrogen peroxide. But the hair of wigs shows absence of bulbs
  and is commonly so treated and is usually somewhat brittle. Thus the
  probability was that this man had recently worn a wig of artificially
  bleached hair.</p>

  <p>'These were our initial data concerning these two men. There were also
  some fingerprints, but we will consider those separately. The initial data
  included the character of the things stolen. These were of insignificant
  intrinsic value and were very easily identifiable. They were thus quite
  unacceptable to the ordinary professional thief, yet the evidence (of the
  suspicious visitor) suggested that they knew what they were stealing. One of
  the things stolen&mdash;the cat's eye pendant&mdash;was known to have an
  extrinsic value and to have been eagerly sought by other persons, and there
  was thus the bare suggestion that this pendant might have been the object of
  the robbery.</p>

  <p>'We now come to the fingerprints. These presented some very remarkable
  anomalies. In the first place, they were not the fingerprints of either of
  the robbers. That was certain. The small man wore gloves, so they could not
  have been his; and the tall man had a depressed scar on the tip of his left
  forefinger, whereas there was no trace of any such scar on the corresponding
  fingerprint. But if they were not the fingerprints of either of the robbers,
  whose fingerprints were they? There was no trace of any third person, and it
  was practically certain that no third person was present.</p>

  <p>'But there was another striking anomaly. Although there were numerous
  impressions, only six digits were represented&mdash;the forefinger and thumb
  of the left hand and the thumb and the first three fingers of the right.
  Every impression of the right hand showed the same four digits, every
  impression of the left showed the same two.</p>

  <p>'Now what could be the explanation of this curious repetition? Anstey's
  very reasonable suggestion was that the man had soiled these particular
  digits with some foreign substance and that, consequently, the soiled digits
  alone had made prints. This suggestion received a certain amount of support
  from the fact that a foreign substance actually was present&mdash;it proved,
  on examination, to be Japanese wax. But though the presence of the wax
  accounted for the distinctness of the fingerprints that were there, it did
  not explain why the other fingers had made no mark at all. I examined the
  glass which bore the fingerprints with the utmost minuteness, but in no case
  was there the faintest trace of the other fingers. Yet those fingers, if they
  had existed, must have touched the glass, and if they had touched it they
  would have made marks. The only explanation seemed to be that there were no
  other fingers; that the prints were not real fingerprints at all, but
  counterfeits made by means of facsimile stamps of rubber, roller-composition,
  or&mdash;more probably&mdash;chrome gelatine.</p>

  <p>'It seemed a far-fetched hypothesis. But it fitted all the facts, and
  there seemed to be no other explanation. Thus the use of a set of stamps
  would explain the existence of a set of fingerprints which were not those of
  either of the parties present; it would explain the repetition of the same
  group of digits (on the assumption that only six stamps were available which
  might easily be the case if these stamps were copies of a particular group of
  fingerprints); and lastly, it would explain the presence of the Japanese
  wax.'</p>

  <p>'How would it?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'Well, some foreign substance would be necessary. In a real
  fingerprint&mdash;on glass, for instance&mdash;the mark is produced by the
  natural grease of the fingers. But a rubber or gelatine stamp has no natural
  grease. It is quite dry, and would make no mark at all unless it were charged
  with some sticky or greasy material. Now Japanese wax is an ideal material
  for the purpose. It is markedly sticky and would consequently develop up
  splendidly with dusting powder; it has no tendency to spread or run, so that
  it gives very clear impressions; and it might easily be mistaken for natural
  skin-grease.</p>

  <p>'The counterfeit fingerprints hypothesis was, therefore, the only one that
  explained the facts, and I adopted it provisionally, assuming that the stamps
  were probably thin plates of rubber or gelatine cemented on the finger tips
  of the gloves worn by the short man.</p>

  <p>'A few days later I received a visit from Detective-Superintendent Miller
  who informed me that the fingerprints had been identified at the registry as
  those of a well-known "habitual" named Hedges, more commonly known as Moakey.
  Of course this did not alter the position since there was no evidence that
  Moakey had ever been on the premises. However, I decided to wait until he was
  arrested and hear what he had to say. But he never was arrested. A day or two
  later, the Superintendent called on me again, and this time he settled the
  matter finally. My impression was, and is, that he came intending to make a
  clean breast of the matter, but that at the last moment he shied at the
  responsibility of giving away official secrets. What he actually said was
  that there had been a mistake; that the fingerprints were not Moakey's after
  all.</p>

  <p>'Of course this was absurd. A mistake might occur with a single
  fingerprint, but with a set of six it was incredible. What had happened
  appeared to me quite obvious. The fingerprints had been submitted to the
  experts, who had at once identified them as Moakey's. Then the executive had
  set out to arrest Moakey&mdash;and had discovered that he was in prison. If
  that was really what had happened, it furnished conclusive proof that the
  fingerprints were forgeries.</p>

  <p>'At once I set to work to ascertain if it were so. I searched the lists of
  convictions at assizes, quarter-sessions, and so forth, and eventually ran
  Moakey to earth. He had been convicted six months previously and sentenced to
  two years' imprisonment with hard labour. So, at the date of the murder, he
  had been in prison about six months.</p>

  <p>'We were now on solid ground. We knew that the fingerprints were
  forgeries. But we knew more than this. The forgery of a fingerprint, unlike
  that of a signature, is a purely mechanical operation, carried out either by
  photography or by some other reproductive process. The forged print is
  necessarily a mechanical copy of an existing real print. Whence it follows
  that the existence of a forgery is evidence of the existence of an original.
  And more than that, it is evidence that the forger had access to that
  original. Now these forgeries were copies of Moakey's fingerprints. It
  followed that we had to look for somebody who had had access to Moakey's
  fingerprints.</p>

  <p>'Fortunately we had not far to look. At the first interview the
  Superintendent had referred to a previous exploit of Moakey's; a burglary at
  a country house, when that artist was apprehended and convicted on the
  evidence of his fingerprints, which were found on a silver salver. A
  photograph of these fingerprints was immediately taken by the owner of the
  house and given to the police, who took them straight to Scotland Yard. I
  looked up the report of that case and had the good fortune to find that the
  fingerprints were described. There were six of them, the thumb and first
  three fingers of the right hand, and the forefinger and thumb of the left
  hand.</p>

  <p>'This was extremely interesting. But still more so was the fact that the
  house which was broken into was Beauchamp Blake, and the further fact that
  the owner who photographed the fingerprints was Mr Arthur Blake.</p>

  <p>'I need not point out the importance of the discovery. It told us that
  Arthur Blake had had, and presumably still had, in his possession, a set of
  negatives with which it was possible to make the stamps of these very
  fingerprints. It did not, however, follow that he had made the stamps, for
  that would demand an amount of technical knowledge and skill far beyond that
  of an ordinary photographer; knowledge ordinarily possessed only by
  professional photo-engravers. He might have such knowledge or he might have
  employed some one else. At any rate, he had the negatives and had made them
  himself.</p>

  <p>'But Blake was not only associated with the fingerprints. He was also
  associated with the stolen property. Of all the persons known to us, he was
  the most likely to wish to acquire the cat's eye pendant. So, you see, the
  investigation, which started with a certain connection with Beauchamp Blake,
  led us straight to Beauchamp Blake again. And there we will leave it for the
  moment and approach the problem from one or two different directions.</p>

  <p>'First we will consider the mysterious woman who came into view on the day
  of the inquest and who presumably sent the poisoned chocolates. Who was she?
  And what was her connection with the case? Now, the first thing that struck
  me in the description of her was her hair. It was of that brassy, golden tint
  that one associates with bleaches such as hydrogen peroxide. I recalled the
  stray hair from the small man's head which had suggested that he had worn a
  wig of precisely this character. The obvious suggestion was that this woman
  and that small man were one and the same person. They appeared to be similar
  in stature, there were good reasons why they should be the same, and no
  reasons why they should not. But, assuming them to be the same (it was
  afterwards proved that they were) the question arose, is this woman a
  disguised man or was that man a disguised woman? The latter view was clearly
  the more probable, for whereas a woman, if she cuts her hair short, will pass
  easily for a clean-shaved man, a clean-shaved man does not pass so easily for
  a woman, especially if he is dark, as this person was. It seemed probable,
  therefore, that this was really a woman&mdash;a dark woman wearing a fair
  wig. But who she was, and what&mdash;if any&mdash;was her relation to Blake,
  remained for the present a mystery.</p>

  <p>'We now come to the man Halliburton. Obviously he was an object of deep
  suspicion. His only known address was an hotel. He visited Andrew Drayton
  without any reasonable purpose. He tried unsuccessfully to purchase the cat's
  eye pendant, and within four days of his failure the jewel was stolen. Then
  he disappeared, leaving no trace.</p>

  <p>'Anstey and I called at his hotel to make enquiries about him. There we
  obtained a photograph of his signature, which we have not used, but which
  will be produced at the inquest, and we acquired some information which has
  been invaluable. He had lost, and left behind, a mascot which he valued so
  highly that he offered ten pounds reward for its recovery. We got the loan of
  it, and Polton made this indistinguishable facsimile.' Here Thorndyke passed
  round Polton's masterpiece for inspection. 'Now,' he continued, 'in
  connection with this mascot, two very important facts emerged. One was that,
  as Anstey expressed it, this man was a superstitious ass, a man who believed
  in the occult properties of mascots and charms. The importance of that
  becomes evident when we remember that the cat's eye was, in effect, a
  mascot&mdash;an object credited with occult powers affecting the fortunes of
  its owner. It enables us to understand his anxiety to possess the cat's
  eye.</p>

  <p>'The other important fact emerges from the nature of the thing itself. It
  is a neck vertebra of an Echidna, or porcupine ant-eater, decorated with
  aboriginal ornament. The Echidna is an animal peculiar to Tasmania and
  Australia, and the ornament is distinctive of the locality. This mascot,
  therefore, established some connection between Halliburton and Australasia.
  But Blake had lived most of his adult life in Australia. There was, however,
  a difficulty. Punched on the mascot&mdash;apparently with typefounder's steel
  punches&mdash;were the letters o and h. The name signed in the hotel register
  was Oscar Halliburton, and these letters seemed to be his initials. But if
  that was so, Oscar Halliburton would appear to be a real person and
  consequently could not be Arthur Blake.</p>

  <p>'Thus, at this stage of the inquiry, on the hypothesis that the robbery
  had been committed by Blake, we had two persons whom we could not account
  for&mdash;the unknown woman (possibly a man) and Mr Oscar Halliburton.</p>

  <p>'But just as we appeared to have reached an impasse, Mr Brodribb threw a
  flood of light on the problem. For different reasons, Sir Lawrence and I were
  anxious to obtain some particulars of Arthur Blake and his affairs, and these
  particulars Mr Brodribb was fortunately in a position to supply. The
  information that he furnished amounted to this:</p>

  <p>'Arthur Blake appeared to be a decent, industrious man with nothing
  against him but the rather queer company that he had kept. He had been
  associated in Australia with a man named Hugh Owen, who was a person of shady
  antecedents, and who, on his side, was associated with a woman named Laura
  Levinsky who appeared to be definitely a bad character, and who, like Owen,
  was under police observation. These two persons seem to have separated
  immediately after Blake's departure for England, and both disappeared.
  Levinsky was lost sight of for good, but Owen's body&mdash;or rather
  unrecognisable remains&mdash;came to light some years later and was
  identified by a ring which was known to have belonged to Owen.</p>

  <p>'Certain particulars that Mr Brodribb gave concerning Owen made a
  considerable impression on me. For instance, it appeared that Owen was
  originally a photo-engraver by trade and that he had later owned a small
  type-foundry. Also that he had fractured his left kneecap and that this
  injury was certainly never completely repaired. But the first thing that
  struck me on looking at this party of three was that whereas Blake appears to
  have been a respectable man and most unlikely to have committed an atrocious
  crime such as the one we were investigating, the same could not be said of
  his two companions, and inevitably I found the question creeping into my
  mind: Is it certain that those remains were really the remains of Owen? Or
  may it have been that they were those of Arthur Blake? That these two
  criminals had murdered Blake when Brodribb's letter arrived: that Owen had
  taken the papers and credentials and come to England personating Blake, and
  that Levinsky had come by another route?</p>

  <p>'It seemed, perhaps, a rather violent supposition; but it was quite
  possible; and the instant it was adopted as a working hypothesis, all the
  difficulties of the case vanished as if by magic. We could now account for
  the mysterious woman. We could also account for Halliburton, for the letters
  on the mascot could be read either way-o h for Oscar Halliburton or h o for
  Hugh Owen; and Owen had possessed and used in his type-foundry steel punches
  exactly like those with which the letters had been made; and further, Owen
  was a native of Tasmania and had lived many years in Australia. He fitted the
  mascot perfectly.</p>

  <p>'Then Owen had been a photo-engraver; that is to say, he possessed the
  very kind of knowledge and skill that was necessary to make the stamps for
  the fingerprints; and he agreed with the taller of the two criminals in that
  he had a marked weakness of the left leg. In short, the agreements were so
  striking as to leave little doubt in my mind that our two criminals were Owen
  and Levinsky, and that the former was in possession of Beauchamp Blake,
  personating the murdered owner.</p>

  <p>'One point only remained to be verified in order to complete this aspect
  of the case. We had to ascertain whether the man who was posing as Arthur
  Blake had, in fact, fractured a knee-cap. I was casting about for some means
  of getting this information when the third attempt was made on Miss Blake's
  life, and it became evident that the danger to her was too great to admit of
  further delay. Just then Sir Lawrence asked me to go down with him to
  Aylesbury, and that proposal suggested to me the plan of visiting Beauchamp
  Blake and making an unmistakable demonstration. I had learned from Mr
  Brodribb something of the squire's habits, and I got further details from the
  landlord of the "King's Head." With the help of the latter I obtained access
  to the park at the time when the squire would be coming out, and I planted
  myself, with Anstey, where we were bound to be noticed.</p>

  <p>'My object was twofold. First, I wanted to ascertain, if possible, whether
  the squire had any abnormal condition of the left leg, and if so, whether
  that condition was probably due to a fractured knee-cap, and secondly, I
  proposed to make such a demonstration as would convince him (if he were
  really Owen) that it was useless to murder Miss Blake until he had settled
  with me, and that it would be highly unsafe to make any further attempts. To
  this latter end I attached Polton's facsimile of the mascot to my
  watch-guard, where it could hardly fail to be seen, and then, as I have said,
  I planted myself on the road leading to the gate.</p>

  <p>'Both purposes were achieved. I was able to verify with my own eyes the
  landlord's statement that the squire habitually mounted his horse from the
  off-side, a most inconvenient method of mounting, but one that would be
  rendered absolutely necessary by a fractured left knee-cap. Then, as I had
  expected, he recognised me instantly&mdash;no doubt from the portrait
  published in the newspapers&mdash;and dismounted to examine me more closely;
  and when he came near, he saw the mascot and it was obvious that he
  recognised it. I detached it and handed it to him, giving him such details as
  must have made clear to him that I knew its history and knew of his
  connection with it. His manner left me in no doubt that he fully understood
  the hint and that he accepted my challenge, and further proof was furnished
  by the fact that he sent a man to shadow us home and ascertain for certain
  who we were. So that matters were now on a perfectly definite footing, and I
  may add that further verification, if it had been needed, was supplied by the
  circumstance that, on this very day, Anstey caught a glimpse of Levinsky,
  disguised as a man, in the market square at Aylesbury. The rest of the story
  I think you all know.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Drayton, 'we gathered that from your written statement. But
  what is not clear to me is why you considered it necessary to thrust your
  head into the lion's jaws. You seem to have had a complete case against these
  two wretches. Why couldn't you have lodged an information and had them
  arrested?'</p>

  <p>'I was afraid to take the risk,' replied Thorndyke. 'To us the case looks
  complete. But how would it have looked to the police? or to a possibly
  unimaginative magistrate? or, especially to a jury of ordinary, and perhaps
  thick-headed, tradesmen and artisans? Juries like direct evidence, and that
  was what I was trying to produce. I had no doubt that these two persons would
  try to murder me and Anstey, and that we should prevent them from succeeding.
  Then we could charge them with the attempt and prove it by direct evidence,
  after which we could have proceeded confidently with the second charge of the
  murder of Andrew Drayton.'</p>

  <p>'I think Thorndyke was right,' said I, seeing that Sir Lawrence still
  looked doubtful. 'From my large experience of juries in criminal cases, I
  feel that this intricate train of inferential evidence would have been rather
  unconvincing by itself, but that it would have been quite effective if it had
  come after a charge supported by the testimony of eye-witnesses, such as we
  should have been.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' said Drayton, 'we will agree that the circumstances justified the
  risk, and certainly the unravelment of this case by means of such almost
  invisible data is a most remarkable achievement. This exposition has whetted
  my appetite for the explanation of the other mystery.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Winifred. 'I am on tenterhooks to hear how you made the
  "little Sphinx" answer its own riddle. Shall I hand you the locket?'</p>

  <p>'If you please; and the Book of Hours. And if we can get Polton to put the
  microscope on the table with the slide that is on the stage, we shall have
  all that we want for the demonstration.'</p>

  <p>At this Polton emerged unblushingly from the office, and having put the
  microscope on the table, carefully adjusted the mirror and then, with brazen
  effrontery, took a long and intent look through the instrument, under the
  pretence of seeing that the specimen was properly lighted.</p>

  <p>'There is no need for you to go back to the office, Polton,' my colleague
  said with a smile at his familiar. 'We shall want your help with the
  microscope presently. Draw up a chair for yourself.'</p>

  <p>Polton seated himself opposite the instrument with a smile of intense
  gratification, and Thorndyke then resumed:</p>

  <p>'This investigation was a much simpler affair than the other. You may
  remember, Miss Blake, showing me the locket that night when I called with
  Anstey at your studio, and you will remember that we noted the very unusual
  construction; the evident purpose of the maker to render it as strong and
  durable as workmanship could make it. This curious construction&mdash;which I
  pointed out at the time&mdash;caused me to examine it rather closely. And
  then I made a rather strange discovery.'</p>

  <p>Winifred leaned forward and gazed at him with breathless expectancy.</p>

  <p>'It was concerned with the hallmark,' he continued. 'There are, as you
  see, four punch-marks. The first is a capital A with two palm-leaves
  surmounted by a crown. The second is an escutcheon or shape with the initials
  AH surmounted by a crown and over that a fleur-de-lis. The third is a capital
  L, and the fourth is the head of an animal which looks like a horse. This
  grouping shows that the piece is French. The first mark is the town mark, the
  second the maker's mark, the third is the date letter, and the fourth is the
  mark of the Farmer of the Duty. Now, I happened to have had occasion to give
  some attention to the marks on old French plate, and I happened to have read,
  only an hour or two previously, the fragmentary narrative of Percival Blake.
  Accordingly, when I examined the hallmark and learned from it that this
  locket had been made in Paris in the year 1751, that fact at once arrested my
  attention.'</p>

  <p>'How did you learn that from the hallmark?' Winifred asked.</p>

  <p>'It is the function of the hallmark to give that information,' he replied.
  'The town-mark of Paris is a capital A surmounted by a crown, but it varies
  in style from year to year. This one is a Roman capital with two palm-leaves
  and a very small crown. That is the form used in the middle of the eighteenth
  century, but the date is definitely fixed by the date-letter&mdash;in this
  case a capital L, which indicates the year 1751.</p>

  <p>'It was, of course, a very remarkable coincidence that this locket should
  have been made at the place and in the year of Judith Blake's death, and it
  naturally caused me to look at the little trinket more narrowly. Hitherto I
  had assumed, as you did, that the object that Percival referred to was the
  cat's eye pendant. But I now recalled that he had not specifically mentioned
  the pendant, and that he had spoken of it as "the bauble" or "the trinket,"
  never as "the jewel." It was thus just barely conceivable that this
  mysterious little object might be the one to which he was referring; and the
  instant the question was raised, the evidence supporting it began to run
  together like drops of water.</p>

  <p>'First, there was the inscription, "O BIOC BPAXYO H AE TEXNH MAKPH," "Life
  is short but Art is long." It was the motto of the practitioner of some art
  or craft. But artists and craftsmen almost invariably use the Latin form,
  "Ars longa, Vita brevis&mdash;Art is long. Life is short." But there is one
  body of craftsmen who use the Greek form. It is the motto of the London
  College of Physicians, and moreover it is written by them in the same uncial
  characters, with the round, C-shaped sigma. Now Percival was a physician and
  a fellow of this very college, and he was an enthusiast who originally
  practised his profession for love and not from necessity or for a livelihood.
  What more natural than that he should use the motto of his own college?</p>

  <p>'Then there was the construction of the locket&mdash;everything sacrificed
  to permanence and durability. It fitted the circumstances perfectly. And
  there were the unusual suspension rings, specially adapted to take a cord or
  thong. I recalled the enigmatic words "gave me a string fr0m his bass viol,
  which he says will be the best of all." Remembering that the bass viol would
  be a viol da gamba or violoncello, not a double-bass, we see that this was
  true; the stout gut string would last for a century or more.</p>

  <p>'Then again there were the scripture references which you showed me. The
  first was "And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children with
  him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his
  fathers shall he return." That was a most striking passage. It was an exact
  statement of Percival's aim&mdash;incidentally illustrating the way in which
  the other passages were to be treated; and when I noted that the principal
  word in the last reference was "parchments," I felt that a prima facie case
  had been made out. I had little doubt that this locket was the "precious
  bauble" that was handed to&mdash;and presumably lost by&mdash;Jenifer.</p>

  <p>'But after all this was only guesswork. We had to get down to certainties.
  And, fortunately, there was available an excellent and conclusive test. If
  the locket was Percival's, the hair in it was almost certainly Judith's. Now
  there was something very unusual about Judith's hair. During her imprisonment
  it had undergone a most extraordinary change. Percival tells us that when she
  was released, "her hair, that had been like spun gold, was turned to a
  strange black." This was very remarkable. Judith was evidently a true blonde,
  and when she was arrested, she must have been getting on for thirty years of
  age. But the hair of a blonde adult does not turn black from ill-health and
  grief. It tends rather to turn white. What could be the explanation of the
  change?</p>

  <p>'It is a very curious one. Judith had been labouring in the mines in the
  Harz Mountains. These mines yield a number of different metals, and some of
  them are extremely poisonous. They are ancient mines, and in the Middle Ages,
  when the properties of metals were less understood, the terrible condition to
  which persons who worked in them were reduced by chronic poisoning was put
  down to the influence of a race of malignant gnomes who were believed to
  inhabit the mines and who were known as kobolds. In particular, the influence
  of the kobolds came to be associated with a particular, uncanny ore from
  which no metal could be&mdash;in those days&mdash;extracted, and in the end
  this ore came to be known by the name of these mine-gnomes or kobolds, and
  that name it bears this day, in the slightly altered form of cobalt.</p>

  <p>'Now, the metal, cobalt, has one or two very distinctive properties. One
  is that of imparting a powerful and beautiful blue colour to substances with
  which it combines. This was the value of the ore, and for this it has been
  prized from quite ancient times. We find it in use everywhere. The blue of
  all the Chinese porcelain is cobalt. The blue of the old Delft pottery is
  cobalt. The blue in all the old stained-glass windows&mdash;and modern ones
  too&mdash;is cobalt.</p>

  <p>'Then this metal has another curious property which it shares with arsenic
  and one or two other metals. It is capable of being absorbed into the body
  and producing poisonous effects, and when so absorbed, it becomes deposited
  in the skin, or, more correctly speaking, in the epidermis and its
  appendages&mdash;the fingernails and the hair. But whereas the outer skin and
  the nails wear away and are cast off, the hair&mdash;especially a woman's
  hair&mdash;remains attached for long periods. Consequently, in chronic cobalt
  poisoning, the hair becomes charged with a cobalt compound&mdash;probably an
  oxide&mdash;and is stained blue.</p>

  <p>'Bearing these facts in mind, we can now understand what had happened to
  Judith. She had been sent to labour in a mine which yielded cobalt, and
  probably nickel. Her hair had not turned black, it had turned blue, though,
  in the mass, it would appear black&mdash;a strange, unnatural black, as
  Percival tells us. Thus, if the hair in this locket was the hair of Judith
  Blake, it would appear blue when properly examined. I took an opportunity to
  get possession of the locket, and that very night I removed the remains of
  the cover-glass and picked out a single hair, which I mounted in Canada
  balsam and examined under the microscope. That hair is on the stage of the
  microscope now. Polton will bring it round and let you see it.'</p>

  <p>Our assistant tenderly carried the microscope round and set it before
  Winifred, and having adjusted the light and the focus, stepped back to watch
  the effect.</p>

  <p>'But how extraordinary!' she exclaimed as she looked into the eyepiece.
  'It looks like a thread of blue glass! And how strange and romantic!'</p>

  <p>Brodribb and Drayton rose from their chairs and came round, all agog to
  see this prodigy. In succession they gazed at it with murmurs of astonishment
  and then went back to their seats, still muttering.</p>

  <p>'The appearance of that hair,' Thorndyke resumed, 'settled the question
  conclusively. This was Percival's trinket beyond a doubt, and all that
  remained was to read the message inside. As we now knew what to look for,
  this presented no difficulty at all. It was no cipher or cryptogram. It was
  simply a collection of texts, from each of which, as the first one showed,
  the instructed reader would have no difficulty in picking out the significant
  word or phrase. We may as well just run through them and see what they tell
  us.</p>

  <p>'Number one, Leviticus 25. 41, we have already considered. It is the
  preamble which indicates the purport of the remainder. I see you have your
  notebook. Will you read us out the next?'</p>

  <p>'Number two,' said Winifred, 'is Psalms 121, 1: "I will lift up mine eyes
  unto the hills, from whence cometh my help!" That is the passage, but it
  doesn't convey any intelligible meaning to me.'</p>

  <p>'No,' said Thorndyke, 'it doesn't, because you have got the wrong Psalm.
  You looked up your reference in the English Authorised Version, overlooking
  the fact that Percival was probably a Catholic and certainly a resident in
  France, and also that the references were given with Latin titles, suggesting
  that he used the Latin Vulgate. This happens to be matter of vital importance
  in this case, as the Psalms are not numbered quite alike in the two Bibles.
  Psalm 121 in the Vulgate is 122 in the Authorised Version. Here is the Douay
  Bible, which is the official translation of the Vulgate, and if we refer to
  Psalm 121.1 in it, we find "I rejoiced at the things that were said to me; We
  shall go into the house of the Lord." That is quite illuminating. It tells us
  that we are concerned with a church, and the next reference tells us what
  church. It is Actus Apostolorum 10.5'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Winifred,' "And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon,
  whose surname is Peter."'</p>

  <p>'That,' said Thorndyke, 'gives us the church of St Peter. The next,' he
  continued, glancing at the notebook which Winifred had handed to him, 'is
  Nehemias 8. 4. "And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood"&mdash;we
  need not complete the passage. The pulpit of wood is obviously the
  significant part. Then we come to 3 Lib. Regum 7. 41&mdash;by the way, that
  third book of Kings might have given you a hint that you were not dealing
  with the Authorised Version. It reads: "The two pillars, and the two bowls of
  the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars," etc. The meaning of
  this passage was not very clear. It had some connection with the pulpit of St
  Peters Church, but what the connection was, it was not easy to guess. Of
  course, directly one saw the pulpit, the meaning was obvious.</p>

  <p>'The next reference is to Psalm 31. 7, and again you have taken the
  Authorised Version and got the wrong Psalm. Psalm 31 in the Vulgate is Psalm
  32 in the Authorised Version. Your reading is "I will be glad and rejoice in
  thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in
  adversities." This, as you say, seems quite irrelevant, but if you had turned
  forward to Psalm 32. 7, you would have read: "Thou art my hiding-place" or
  "refuge," as the Vulgate has it, which is very relevant indeed. The last
  reference is 2 Epist. ad Tim. "The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus,
  when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, but especially the
  parchments."</p>

  <p>'Thus, taking the references together, they suggest to us the ideas of
  parchments, a hiding-place, and the two pillars (and their capitals) of the
  wooden pulpit of the church of St Peter. It was perfectly plain and simple to
  a reader who knew the kind of information that was being given and who knew
  of the existence of this particular church. To a stranger, on the other hand,
  it was perfectly meaningless and undecipherable.'</p>

  <p>'It certainly looks very simple now that we have heard the explanation,'
  said Winifred, 'but it didn't seem so when I was trying to work it out
  myself. There didn't seem to be anything to go on.'</p>

  <p>'No,' agreed Sir Lawrence, 'there didn't seem to be anything to go on in
  either case. The clues were perfectly invisible, and I don't believe any one
  but our friend would have discovered a particle of evidence.'</p>

  <p>Brodribb chuckled and reached out for the decanter. 'I agree with you,
  Drayton,' said he. 'Thorndyke reminds me of that, probably fabulous, kind of
  Indian juggler who throws a rope into the air and proceeds to climb up it and
  pull it up after him. He can work without any visible means of support.
  However, he has conducted our various affairs to a highly satisfactory
  conclusion, and I propose that we charge our glasses in his honour and invite
  him to light the Trichinopoly, which, I believe, is his disgusting habit on
  occasions of this kind.'</p>

  <p>Accordingly the glasses were filled, the toast pledged, and the virulent
  little cheroot duly lighted; with which mystical rite the case of the Cat's
  Eye was formally closed and dismissed into the domain of memory.</p>

  <p>There is little more to tell. I am finishing this narrative in a pleasant,
  panelled room in the old mansion of Beauchamp Blake, one of a suite assigned
  by Percy to Winifred and me, in which we commonly spend our
  weekends&mdash;for our normal abiding-place is still the Temple. Percy is
  growing apace, and like his ancestor and namesake, refuses to abandon his
  professional ambitions. At present he is engaged, under the direction of a
  famous architect, in restoring the old house to its former comeliness, and
  only this morning I saw them together superintending the replacement of a
  perished fascia with a sturdy oaken plank, enriched with fine carving and
  bearing in raised letters the legend: 'God's Providence is Mine
  Inheritance.'</p>
