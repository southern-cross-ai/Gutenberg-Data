<p>"Oh, there IS one, of course, but you'll never know it."</p>
<p>The assertion, laughingly flung out six months earlier in a bright June
garden, came back to Mary Boyne with a sharp perception of its latent
significance as she stood, in the December dusk, waiting for the lamps to be
brought into the library.</p>
<p>The words had been spoken by their friend Alida Stair, as they sat at tea on
her lawn at Pangbourne, in reference to the very house of which the library in
question was the central, the pivotal "feature." Mary Boyne and her husband, in
quest of a country place in one of the southern or southwestern counties, had,
on their arrival in England, carried their problem straight to Alida Stair, who
had successfully solved it in her own case; but it was not until they had
rejected, almost capriciously, several practical and judicious suggestions that
she threw it out: "Well, there's Lyng, in Dorsetshire. It belongs to Hugo's
cousins, and you can get it for a song."</p>
<p>The reasons she gave for its being obtainable on these terms&#8212;its
remoteness from a station, its lack of electric light, hot-water pipes, and
other vulgar necessities&#8212;were exactly those pleading in its favor with
two romantic Americans perversely in search of the economic drawbacks which
were associated, in their tradition, with unusual architectural felicities.</p>
<p>"I should never believe I was living in an old house unless I was thoroughly
uncomfortable," Ned Boyne, the more extravagant of the two, had jocosely
insisted; "the least hint of 'convenience' would make me think it had been
bought out of an exhibition, with the pieces numbered, and set up again." And
they had proceeded to enumerate, with humorous precision, their various
suspicions and exactions, refusing to believe that the house their cousin
recommended was REALLY Tudor till they learned it had no heating system, or
that the village church was literally in the grounds till she assured them of
the deplorable uncertainty of the water- supply.</p>
<p>"It's too uncomfortable to be true!" Edward Boyne had continued to exult as
the avowal of each disadvantage was successively wrung from her; but he had cut
short his rhapsody to ask, with a sudden relapse to distrust: "And the ghost?
You've been concealing from us the fact that there is no ghost!"</p>
<p>Mary, at the moment, had laughed with him, yet almost with her laugh, being
possessed of several sets of independent perceptions, had noted a sudden
flatness of tone in Alida's answering hilarity.</p>
<p>"Oh, Dorsetshire's full of ghosts, you know."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes; but that won't do. I don't want to have to drive ten miles to see
somebody else's ghost. I want one of my own on the premises. IS there a ghost
at Lyng?"</p>
<p>His rejoinder had made Alida laugh again, and it was then that she had flung
back tantalizingly: "Oh, there IS one, of course, but you'll never know
it."</p>
<p>"Never know it?" Boyne pulled her up. "But what in the world constitutes a
ghost except the fact of its being known for one?"</p>
<p>"I can't say. But that's the story."</p>
<p>"That there's a ghost, but that nobody knows it's a ghost?"</p>
<p>"Well&#8212;not till afterward, at any rate."</p>
<p>"Till afterward?"</p>
<p>"Not till long, long afterward."</p>
<p>"But if it's once been identified as an unearthly visitant, why hasn't its
signalement been handed down in the family? How has it managed to preserve its
incognito?"</p>
<p>Alida could only shake her head. "Don't ask me. But it has."</p>
<p>"And then suddenly&#8212;" Mary spoke up as if from some cavernous depth of
divination&#8212;"suddenly, long afterward, one says to one's self, 'THAT WAS
it?'"</p>
<p>She was oddly startled at the sepulchral sound with which her question fell
on the banter of the other two, and she saw the shadow of the same surprise
flit across Alida's clear pupils. "I suppose so. One just has to wait."</p>
<p>"Oh, hang waiting!" Ned broke in. "Life's too short for a ghost who can only
be enjoyed in retrospect. Can't we do better than that, Mary?"</p>
<p>But it turned out that in the event they were not destined to, for within
three months of their conversation with Mrs. Stair they were established at
Lyng, and the life they had yearned for to the point of planning it out in all
its daily details had actually begun for them.</p>
<p>It was to sit, in the thick December dusk, by just such a wide- hooded
fireplace, under just such black oak rafters, with the sense that beyond the
mullioned panes the downs were darkening to a deeper solitude: it was for the
ultimate indulgence in such sensations that Mary Boyne had endured for nearly
fourteen years the soul-deadening ugliness of the Middle West, and that Boyne
had ground on doggedly at his engineering till, with a suddenness that still
made her blink, the prodigious windfall of the Blue Star Mine had put them at a
stroke in possession of life and the leisure to taste it. They had never for a
moment meant their new state to be one of idleness; but they meant to give
themselves only to harmonious activities. She had her vision of painting and
gardening (against a background of gray walls), he dreamed of the production of
his long-planned book on the "Economic Basis of Culture"; and with such
absorbing work ahead no existence could be too sequestered; they could not get
far enough from the world, or plunge deep enough into the past.</p>
<p>Dorsetshire had attracted them from the first by a semblance of remoteness
out of all proportion to its geographical position. But to the Boynes it was
one of the ever-recurring wonders of the whole incredibly compressed
island&#8212;a nest of counties, as they put it&#8212;that for the production
of its effects so little of a given quality went so far: that so few miles made
a distance, and so short a distance a difference.</p>
<p>"It's that," Ned had once enthusiastically explained, "that gives such depth
to their effects, such relief to their least contrasts. They've been able to
lay the butter so thick on every exquisite mouthful."</p>
<p>The butter had certainly been laid on thick at Lyng: the old gray house,
hidden under a shoulder of the downs, had almost all the finer marks of
commerce with a protracted past. The mere fact that it was neither large nor
exceptional made it, to the Boynes, abound the more richly in its special
sense&#8212;the sense of having been for centuries a deep, dim reservoir of
life. The life had probably not been of the most vivid order: for long periods,
no doubt, it had fallen as noiselessly into the past as the quiet drizzle of
autumn fell, hour after hour, into the green fish-pond between the yews; but
these back-waters of existence sometimes breed, in their sluggish depths,
strange acuities of emotion, and Mary Boyne had felt from the first the
occasional brush of an intenser memory.</p>
<p>The feeling had never been stronger than on the December afternoon when,
waiting in the library for the belated lamps, she rose from her seat and stood
among the shadows of the hearth. Her husband had gone off, after luncheon, for
one of his long tramps on the downs. She had noticed of late that he preferred
to be unaccompanied on these occasions; and, in the tried security of their
personal relations, had been driven to conclude that his book was bothering
him, and that he needed the afternoons to turn over in solitude the problems
left from the morning's work. Certainly the book was not going as smoothly as
she had imagined it would, and the lines of perplexity between his eyes had
never been there in his engineering days. Then he had often looked fagged to
the verge of illness, but the native demon of "worry" had never branded his
brow. Yet the few pages he had so far read to her&#8212;the introduction, and a
synopsis of the opening chapter&#8212;gave evidences of a firm possession of
his subject, and a deepening confidence in his powers.</p>
<p>The fact threw her into deeper perplexity, since, now that he had done with
"business" and its disturbing contingencies, the one other possible element of
anxiety was eliminated. Unless it were his health, then? But physically he had
gained since they had come to Dorsetshire, grown robuster, ruddier, and
fresher-eyed. It was only within a week that she had felt in him the
undefinable change that made her restless in his absence, and as tongue-tied in
his presence as though it were SHE who had a secret to keep from him!</p>
<p>The thought that there WAS a secret somewhere between them struck her with a
sudden smart rap of wonder, and she looked about her down the dim, long
room.</p>
<p>"Can it be the house?" she mused.</p>
<p>The room itself might have been full of secrets. They seemed to be piling
themselves up, as evening fell, like the layers and layers of velvet shadow
dropping from the low ceiling, the dusky walls of books, the smoke-blurred
sculpture of the hooded hearth.</p>
<p>"Why, of course&#8212;the house is haunted!" she reflected.</p>
<p>The ghost&#8212;Alida's imperceptible ghost&#8212;after figuring largely in
the banter of their first month or two at Lyng, had been gradually discarded as
too ineffectual for imaginative use. Mary had, indeed, as became the tenant of
a haunted house, made the customary inquiries among her few rural neighbors,
but, beyond a vague, "They du say so, Ma'am," the villagers had nothing to
impart. The elusive specter had apparently never had sufficient identity for a
legend to crystallize about it, and after a time the Boynes had laughingly set
the matter down to their profit- and-loss account, agreeing that Lyng was one
of the few houses good enough in itself to dispense with supernatural
enhancements.</p>
<p>"And I suppose, poor, ineffectual demon, that's why it beats its beautiful
wings in vain in the void," Mary had laughingly concluded.</p>
<p>"Or, rather," Ned answered, in the same strain, "why, amid so much that's
ghostly, it can never affirm its separate existence as THE ghost." And
thereupon their invisible housemate had finally dropped out of their
references, which were numerous enough to make them promptly unaware of the
loss.</p>
<p>Now, as she stood on the hearth, the subject of their earlier curiosity
revived in her with a new sense of its meaning&#8212;a sense gradually acquired
through close daily contact with the scene of the lurking mystery. It was the
house itself, of course, that possessed the ghost-seeing faculty, that communed
visually but secretly with its own past; and if one could only get into close
enough communion with the house, one might surprise its secret, and acquire the
ghost-sight on one's own account. Perhaps, in his long solitary hours in this
very room, where she never trespassed till the afternoon, her husband HAD
acquired it already, and was silently carrying the dread weight of whatever it
had revealed to him. Mary was too well-versed in the code of the spectral world
not to know that one could not talk about the ghosts one saw: to do so was
almost as great a breach of good- breeding as to name a lady in a club. But
this explanation did not really satisfy her. "What, after all, except for the
fun of the frisson," she reflected, "would he really care for any of their old
ghosts?" And thence she was thrown back once more on the fundamental dilemma:
the fact that one's greater or less susceptibility to spectral influences had
no particular bearing on the case, since, when one DID see a ghost at Lyng, one
did not know it.</p>
<p>"Not till long afterward," Alida Stair had said. Well, supposing Ned HAD
seen one when they first came, and had known only within the last week what had
happened to him? More and more under the spell of the hour, she threw back her
searching thoughts to the early days of their tenancy, but at first only to
recall a gay confusion of unpacking, settling, arranging of books, and calling
to each other from remote corners of the house as treasure after treasure of
their habitation revealed itself to them. It was in this particular connection
that she presently recalled a certain soft afternoon of the previous October,
when, passing from the first rapturous flurry of exploration to a detailed
inspection of the old house, she had pressed (like a novel heroine) a panel
that opened at her touch, on a narrow flight of stairs leading to an
unsuspected flat ledge of the roof&#8212;the roof which, from below, seemed to
slope away on all sides too abruptly for any but practised feet to scale.</p>
<p>The view from this hidden coign was enchanting, and she had flown down to
snatch Ned from his papers and give him the freedom of her discovery. She
remembered still how, standing on the narrow ledge, he had passed his arm about
her while their gaze flew to the long, tossed horizon-line of the downs, and
then dropped contentedly back to trace the arabesque of yew hedges about the
fish-pond, and the shadow of the cedar on the lawn.</p>
<p>"And now the other way," he had said, gently turning her about within his
arm; and closely pressed to him, she had absorbed, like some long, satisfying
draft, the picture of the gray-walled court, the squat lions on the gates, and
the lime-avenue reaching up to the highroad under the downs.</p>
<p>It was just then, while they gazed and held each other, that she had felt
his arm relax, and heard a sharp "Hullo!" that made her turn to glance at
him.</p>
<p>Distinctly, yes, she now recalled she had seen, as she glanced, a shadow of
anxiety, of perplexity, rather, fall across his face; and, following his eyes,
had beheld the figure of a man&#8212;a man in loose, grayish clothes, as it
appeared to her&#8212;who was sauntering down the lime-avenue to the court with
the tentative gait of a stranger seeking his way. Her short-sighted eyes had
given her but a blurred impression of slightness and grayness, with something
foreign, or at least unlocal, in the cut of the figure or its garb; but her
husband had apparently seen more&#8212;seen enough to make him push past her
with a sharp "Wait!" and dash down the twisting stairs without pausing to give
her a hand for the descent.</p>
<p>A slight tendency to dizziness obliged her, after a provisional clutch at
the chimney against which they had been leaning, to follow him down more
cautiously; and when she had reached the attic landing she paused again for a
less definite reason, leaning over the oak banister to strain her eyes through
the silence of the brown, sun-flecked depths below. She lingered there till,
somewhere in those depths, she heard the closing of a door; then, mechanically
impelled, she went down the shallow flights of steps till she reached the lower
hall.</p>
<p>The front door stood open on the mild sunlight of the court, and hall and
court were empty. The library door was open, too, and after listening in vain
for any sound of voices within, she quickly crossed the threshold, and found
her husband alone, vaguely fingering the papers on his desk.</p>
<p>He looked up, as if surprised at her precipitate entrance, but the shadow of
anxiety had passed from his face, leaving it even, as she fancied, a little
brighter and clearer than usual.</p>
<p>"What was it? Who was it?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Who?" he repeated, with the surprise still all on his side.</p>
<p>"The man we saw coming toward the house."</p>
<p>He seemed honestly to reflect. "The man? Why, I thought I saw Peters; I
dashed after him to say a word about the stable-drains, but he had disappeared
before I could get down."</p>
<p>"Disappeared? Why, he seemed to be walking so slowly when we saw him."</p>
<p>Boyne shrugged his shoulders. "So I thought; but he must have got up steam
in the interval. What do you say to our trying a scramble up Meldon Steep
before sunset?"</p>
<p>That was all. At the time the occurrence had been less than nothing, had,
indeed, been immediately obliterated by the magic of their first vision from
Meldon Steep, a height which they had dreamed of climbing ever since they had
first seen its bare spine heaving itself above the low roof of Lyng. Doubtless
it was the mere fact of the other incident's having occurred on the very day of
their ascent to Meldon that had kept it stored away in the unconscious fold of
association from which it now emerged; for in itself it had no mark of the
portentous. At the moment there could have been nothing more natural than that
Ned should dash himself from the roof in the pursuit of dilatory tradesmen. It
was the period when they were always on the watch for one or the other of the
specialists employed about the place; always lying in wait for them, and
dashing out at them with questions, reproaches, or reminders. And certainly in
the distance the gray figure had looked like Peters.</p>
<p>Yet now, as she reviewed the rapid scene, she felt her husband's explanation
of it to have been invalidated by the look of anxiety on his face. Why had the
familiar appearance of Peters made him anxious? Why, above all, if it was of
such prime necessity to confer with that authority on the subject of the
stable-drains, had the failure to find him produced such a look of relief? Mary
could not say that any one of these considerations had occurred to her at the
time, yet, from the promptness with which they now marshaled themselves at her
summons, she had a sudden sense that they must all along have been there,
waiting their hour.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_3" id="1_0_3">II</a></h3>
<p>Weary with her thoughts, she moved toward the window. The library was now
completely dark, and she was surprised to see how much faint light the outer
world still held.</p>
<p>As she peered out into it across the court, a figure shaped itself in the
tapering perspective of bare lines: it looked a mere blot of deeper gray in the
grayness, and for an instant, as it moved toward her, her heart thumped to the
thought, "It's the ghost!"</p>
<p>She had time, in that long instant, to feel suddenly that the man of whom,
two months earlier, she had a brief distant vision from the roof was now, at
his predestined hour, about to reveal himself as NOT having been Peters; and
her spirit sank under the impending fear of the disclosure. But almost with the
next tick of the clock the ambiguous figure, gaining substance and character,
showed itself even to her weak sight as her husband's; and she turned away to
meet him, as he entered, with the confession of her folly.</p>
<p>"It's really too absurd," she laughed out from the threshold, "but I never
CAN remember!"</p>
<p>"Remember what?" Boyne questioned as they drew together.</p>
<p>"That when one sees the Lyng ghost one never knows it."</p>
<p>Her hand was on his sleeve, and he kept it there, but with no response in
his gesture or in the lines of his fagged, preoccupied face.</p>
<p>"Did you think you'd seen it?" he asked, after an appreciable interval.</p>
<p>"Why, I actually took YOU for it, my dear, in my mad determination to spot
it!"</p>
<p>"Me&#8212;just now?" His arm dropped away, and he turned from her with a
faint echo of her laugh. "Really, dearest, you'd better give it up, if that's
the best you can do."</p>
<p>"Yes, I give it up&#8212;I give it up. Have YOU?" she asked, turning round
on him abruptly.</p>
<p>The parlor-maid had entered with letters and a lamp, and the light struck up
into Boyne's face as he bent above the tray she presented.</p>
<p>"Have YOU?" Mary perversely insisted, when the servant had disappeared on
her errand of illumination.</p>
<p>"Have I what?" he rejoined absently, the light bringing out the sharp stamp
of worry between his brows as he turned over the letters.</p>
<p>"Given up trying to see the ghost." Her heart beat a little at the
experiment she was making.</p>
<p>Her husband, laying his letters aside, moved away into the shadow of the
hearth.</p>
<p>"I never tried," he said, tearing open the wrapper of a newspaper.</p>
<p>"Well, of course," Mary persisted, "the exasperating thing is that there's
no use trying, since one can't be sure till so long afterward."</p>
<p>He was unfolding the paper as if he had hardly heard her; but after a pause,
during which the sheets rustled spasmodically between his hands, he lifted his
head to say abruptly, "Have you any idea HOW LONG?"</p>
<p>Mary had sunk into a low chair beside the fireplace. From her seat she
looked up, startled, at her husband's profile, which was darkly projected
against the circle of lamplight.</p>
<p>"No; none. Have YOU?" she retorted, repeating her former phrase with an
added keenness of intention.</p>
<p>Boyne crumpled the paper into a bunch, and then inconsequently turned back
with it toward the lamp.</p>
<p>"Lord, no! I only meant," he explained, with a faint tinge of impatience,
"is there any legend, any tradition, as to that?"</p>
<p>"Not that I know of," she answered; but the impulse to add, "What makes you
ask?" was checked by the reappearance of the parlor- maid with tea and a second
lamp.</p>
<p>With the dispersal of shadows, and the repetition of the daily domestic
office, Mary Boyne felt herself less oppressed by that sense of something
mutely imminent which had darkened her solitary afternoon. For a few moments
she gave herself silently to the details of her task, and when she looked up
from it she was struck to the point of bewilderment by the change in her
husband's face. He had seated himself near the farther lamp, and was absorbed
in the perusal of his letters; but was it something he had found in them, or
merely the shifting of her own point of view, that had restored his features to
their normal aspect? The longer she looked, the more definitely the change
affirmed itself. The lines of painful tension had vanished, and such traces of
fatigue as lingered were of the kind easily attributable to steady mental
effort. He glanced up, as if drawn by her gaze, and met her eyes with a
smile.</p>
<p>"I'm dying for my tea, you know; and here's a letter for you," he said.</p>
<p>She took the letter he held out in exchange for the cup she proffered him,
and, returning to her seat, broke the seal with the languid gesture of the
reader whose interests are all inclosed in the circle of one cherished
presence.</p>
<p>Her next conscious motion was that of starting to her feet, the letter
falling to them as she rose, while she held out to her husband a long newspaper
clipping.</p>
<p>"Ned! What's this? What does it mean?"</p>
<p>He had risen at the same instant, almost as if hearing her cry before she
uttered it; and for a perceptible space of time he and she studied each other,
like adversaries watching for an advantage, across the space between her chair
and his desk.</p>
<p>"What's what? You fairly made me jump!" Boyne said at length, moving toward
her with a sudden, half-exasperated laugh. The shadow of apprehension was on
his face again, not now a look of fixed foreboding, but a shifting vigilance of
lips and eyes that gave her the sense of his feeling himself invisibly
surrounded.</p>
<p>Her hand shook so that she could hardly give him the clipping.</p>
<p>"This article&#8212;from the 'Waukesha Sentinel'&#8212;that a man named
Elwell has brought suit against you&#8212;that there was something wrong about
the Blue Star Mine. I can't understand more than half."</p>
<p>They continued to face each other as she spoke, and to her astonishment, she
saw that her words had the almost immediate effect of dissipating the strained
watchfulness of his look.</p>
<p>"Oh, THAT!" He glanced down the printed slip, and then folded it with the
gesture of one who handles something harmless and familiar. "What's the matter
with you this afternoon, Mary? I thought you'd got bad news."</p>
<p>She stood before him with her undefinable terror subsiding slowly under the
reassuring touch of his composure.</p>
<p>"You knew about this, then&#8212;it's all right?"</p>
<p>"Certainly I knew about it; and it's all right."</p>
<p>"But what IS it? I don't understand. What does this man accuse you of?"</p>
<p>"Oh, pretty nearly every crime in the calendar." Boyne had tossed the
clipping down, and thrown himself comfortably into an arm-chair near the fire.
"Do you want to hear the story? It's not particularly interesting&#8212;just a
squabble over interests in the Blue Star."</p>
<p>"But who is this Elwell? I don't know the name."</p>
<p>"Oh, he's a fellow I put into it&#8212;gave him a hand up. I told you all
about him at the time."</p>
<p>"I daresay. I must have forgotten." Vainly she strained back among her
memories. "But if you helped him, why does he make this return?"</p>
<p>"Oh, probably some shyster lawyer got hold of him and talked him over. It's
all rather technical and complicated. I thought that kind of thing bored
you."</p>
<p>His wife felt a sting of compunction. Theoretically, she deprecated the
American wife's detachment from her husband's professional interests, but in
practice she had always found it difficult to fix her attention on Boyne's
report of the transactions in which his varied interests involved him. Besides,
she had felt from the first that, in a community where the amenities of living
could be obtained only at the cost of efforts as arduous as her husband's
professional labors, such brief leisure as they could command should be used as
an escape from immediate preoccupations, a flight to the life they always
dreamed of living. Once or twice, now that this new life had actually drawn its
magic circle about them, she had asked herself if she had done right; but
hitherto such conjectures had been no more than the retrospective excursions of
an active fancy. Now, for the first time, it startled her a little to find how
little she knew of the material foundation on which her happiness was
built.</p>
<p>She glanced again at her husband, and was reassured by the composure of his
face; yet she felt the need of more definite grounds for her reassurance.</p>
<p>"But doesn't this suit worry you? Why have you never spoken to me about
it?"</p>
<p>He answered both questions at once: "I didn't speak of it at first because
it DID worry me&#8212;annoyed me, rather. But it's all ancient history now.
Your correspondent must have got hold of a back number of the 'Sentinel.'"</p>
<p>She felt a quick thrill of relief. "You mean it's over? He's lost his
case?"</p>
<p>There was a just perceptible delay in Boyne's reply. "The suit's been
withdrawn&#8212;that's all."</p>
<p>But she persisted, as if to exonerate herself from the inward charge of
being too easily put off. "Withdrawn because he saw he had no chance?"</p>
<p>"Oh, he had no chance," Boyne answered.</p>
<p>She was still struggling with a dimly felt perplexity at the back of her
thoughts.</p>
<p>"How long ago was it withdrawn?"</p>
<p>He paused, as if with a slight return of his former uncertainty. "I've just
had the news now; but I've been expecting it."</p>
<p>"Just now&#8212;in one of your letters?"</p>
<p>"Yes; in one of my letters."</p>
<p>She made no answer, and was aware only, after a short interval of waiting,
that he had risen, and strolling across the room, had placed himself on the
sofa at her side. She felt him, as he did so, pass an arm about her, she felt
his hand seek hers and clasp it, and turning slowly, drawn by the warmth of his
cheek, she met the smiling clearness of his eyes.</p>
<p>"It's all right&#8212;it's all right?" she questioned, through the flood of
her dissolving doubts; and "I give you my word it never was righter!" he
laughed back at her, holding her close.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_4" id="1_0_4">III</a></h3>
<p>One of the strangest things she was afterward to recall out of all the next
day's incredible strangeness was the sudden and complete recovery of her sense
of security.</p>
<p>It was in the air when she woke in her low-ceilinged, dusky room; it
accompanied her down-stairs to the breakfast-table, flashed out at her from the
fire, and re-duplicated itself brightly from the flanks of the urn and the
sturdy flutings of the Georgian teapot. It was as if, in some roundabout way,
all her diffused apprehensions of the previous day, with their moment of sharp
concentration about the newspaper article,&#8212;as if this dim questioning of
the future, and startled return upon the past,&#8212; had between them
liquidated the arrears of some haunting moral obligation. If she had indeed
been careless of her husband's affairs, it was, her new state seemed to prove,
because her faith in him instinctively justified such carelessness; and his
right to her faith had overwhelmingly affirmed itself in the very face of
menace and suspicion. She had never seen him more untroubled, more naturally
and unconsciously in possession of himself, than after the cross-examination to
which she had subjected him: it was almost as if he had been aware of her
lurking doubts, and had wanted the air cleared as much as she did.</p>
<p>It was as clear, thank Heaven! as the bright outer light that surprised her
almost with a touch of summer when she issued from the house for her daily
round of the gardens. She had left Boyne at his desk, indulging herself, as she
passed the library door, by a last peep at his quiet face, where he bent, pipe
in his mouth, above his papers, and now she had her own morning's task to
perform. The task involved on such charmed winter days almost as much delighted
loitering about the different quarters of her demesne as if spring were already
at work on shrubs and borders. There were such inexhaustible possibilities
still before her, such opportunities to bring out the latent graces of the old
place, without a single irreverent touch of alteration, that the winter months
were all too short to plan what spring and autumn executed. And her recovered
sense of safety gave, on this particular morning, a peculiar zest to her
progress through the sweet, still place. She went first to the kitchen-garden,
where the espaliered pear-trees drew complicated patterns on the walls, and
pigeons were fluttering and preening about the silvery-slated roof of their
cot. There was something wrong about the piping of the hothouse, and she was
expecting an authority from Dorchester, who was to drive out between trains and
make a diagnosis of the boiler. But when she dipped into the damp heat of the
greenhouses, among the spiced scents and waxy pinks and reds of old-fashioned
exotics,&#8212;even the flora of Lyng was in the note!&#8212; she learned that
the great man had not arrived, and the day being too rare to waste in an
artificial atmosphere, she came out again and paced slowly along the springy
turf of the bowling-green to the gardens behind the house. At their farther end
rose a grass terrace, commanding, over the fish-pond and the yew hedges, a view
of the long house-front, with its twisted chimney-stacks and the blue shadows
of its roof angles, all drenched in the pale gold moisture of the air.</p>
<p>Seen thus, across the level tracery of the yews, under the suffused, mild
light, it sent her, from its open windows and hospitably smoking chimneys, the
look of some warm human presence, of a mind slowly ripened on a sunny wall of
experience. She had never before had so deep a sense of her intimacy with it,
such a conviction that its secrets were all beneficent, kept, as they said to
children, "for one's good," so complete a trust in its power to gather up her
life and Ned's into the harmonious pattern of the long, long story it sat there
weaving in the sun.</p>
<p>She heard steps behind her, and turned, expecting to see the gardener,
accompanied by the engineer from Dorchester. But only one figure was in sight,
that of a youngish, slightly built man, who, for reasons she could not on the
spot have specified, did not remotely resemble her preconceived notion of an
authority on hot-house boilers. The new-comer, on seeing her, lifted his hat,
and paused with the air of a gentleman&#8212;perhaps a traveler&#8212; desirous
of having it immediately known that his intrusion is involuntary. The local
fame of Lyng occasionally attracted the more intelligent sight-seer, and Mary
half-expected to see the stranger dissemble a camera, or justify his presence
by producing it. But he made no gesture of any sort, and after a moment she
asked, in a tone responding to the courteous deprecation of his attitude: "Is
there any one you wish to see?"</p>
<p>"I came to see Mr. Boyne," he replied. His intonation, rather than his
accent, was faintly American, and Mary, at the familiar note, looked at him
more closely. The brim of his soft felt hat cast a shade on his face, which,
thus obscured, wore to her short-sighted gaze a look of seriousness, as of a
person arriving "on business," and civilly but firmly aware of his rights.</p>
<p>Past experience had made Mary equally sensible to such claims; but she was
jealous of her husband's morning hours, and doubtful of his having given any
one the right to intrude on them.</p>
<p>"Have you an appointment with Mr. Boyne?" she asked.</p>
<p>He hesitated, as if unprepared for the question.</p>
<p>"Not exactly an appointment," he replied.</p>
<p>"Then I'm afraid, this being his working-time, that he can't receive you
now. Will you give me a message, or come back later?"</p>
<p>The visitor, again lifting his hat, briefly replied that he would come back
later, and walked away, as if to regain the front of the house. As his figure
receded down the walk between the yew hedges, Mary saw him pause and look up an
instant at the peaceful house-front bathed in faint winter sunshine; and it
struck her, with a tardy touch of compunction, that it would have been more
humane to ask if he had come from a distance, and to offer, in that case, to
inquire if her husband could receive him. But as the thought occurred to her he
passed out of sight behind a pyramidal yew, and at the same moment her
attention was distracted by the approach of the gardener, attended by the
bearded pepper-and-salt figure of the boiler-maker from Dorchester.</p>
<p>The encounter with this authority led to such far-reaching issues that they
resulted in his finding it expedient to ignore his train, and beguiled Mary
into spending the remainder of the morning in absorbed confabulation among the
greenhouses. She was startled to find, when the colloquy ended, that it was
nearly luncheon-time, and she half expected, as she hurried back to the house,
to see her husband coming out to meet her. But she found no one in the court
but an under-gardener raking the gravel, and the hall, when she entered it, was
so silent that she guessed Boyne to be still at work behind the closed door of
the library.</p>
<p>Not wishing to disturb him, she turned into the drawing-room, and there, at
her writing-table, lost herself in renewed calculations of the outlay to which
the morning's conference had committed her. The knowledge that she could permit
herself such follies had not yet lost its novelty; and somehow, in contrast to
the vague apprehensions of the previous days, it now seemed an element of her
recovered security, of the sense that, as Ned had said, things in general had
never been "righter."</p>
<p>She was still luxuriating in a lavish play of figures when the parlor-maid,
from the threshold, roused her with a dubiously worded inquiry as to the
expediency of serving luncheon. It was one of their jokes that Trimmle
announced luncheon as if she were divulging a state secret, and Mary, intent
upon her papers, merely murmured an absent-minded assent.</p>
<p>She felt Trimmle wavering expressively on the threshold as if in rebuke of
such offhand acquiescence; then her retreating steps sounded down the passage,
and Mary, pushing away her papers, crossed the hall, and went to the library
door. It was still closed, and she wavered in her turn, disliking to disturb
her husband, yet anxious that he should not exceed his normal measure of work.
As she stood there, balancing her impulses, the esoteric Trimmle returned with
the announcement of luncheon, and Mary, thus impelled, opened the door and went
into the library.</p>
<p>Boyne was not at his desk, and she peered about her, expecting to discover
him at the book-shelves, somewhere down the length of the room; but her call
brought no response, and gradually it became clear to her that he was not in
the library.</p>
<p>She turned back to the parlor-maid.</p>
<p>"Mr. Boyne must be up-stairs. Please tell him that luncheon is ready."</p>
<p>The parlor-maid appeared to hesitate between the obvious duty of obeying
orders and an equally obvious conviction of the foolishness of the injunction
laid upon her. The struggle resulted in her saying doubtfully, "If you please,
Madam, Mr. Boyne's not up-stairs."</p>
<p>"Not in his room? Are you sure?"</p>
<p>"I'm sure, Madam."</p>
<p>Mary consulted the clock. "Where is he, then?"</p>
<p>"He's gone out," Trimmle announced, with the superior air of one who has
respectfully waited for the question that a well-ordered mind would have first
propounded.</p>
<p>Mary's previous conjecture had been right, then. Boyne must have gone to the
gardens to meet her, and since she had missed him, it was clear that he had
taken the shorter way by the south door, instead of going round to the court.
She crossed the hall to the glass portal opening directly on the yew garden,
but the parlor- maid, after another moment of inner conflict, decided to bring
out recklessly, "Please, Madam, Mr. Boyne didn't go that way."</p>
<p>Mary turned back. "Where DID he go? And when?"</p>
<p>"He went out of the front door, up the drive, Madam." It was a matter of
principle with Trimmle never to answer more than one question at a time.</p>
<p>"Up the drive? At this hour?" Mary went to the door herself, and glanced
across the court through the long tunnel of bare limes. But its perspective was
as empty as when she had scanned it on entering the house.</p>
<p>"Did Mr. Boyne leave no message?" she asked.</p>
<p>Trimmle seemed to surrender herself to a last struggle with the forces of
chaos.</p>
<p>"No, Madam. He just went out with the gentleman."</p>
<p>"The gentleman? What gentleman?" Mary wheeled about, as if to front this new
factor.</p>
<p>"The gentleman who called, Madam," said Trimmle, resignedly.</p>
<p>"When did a gentleman call? Do explain yourself, Trimmle!"</p>
<p>Only the fact that Mary was very hungry, and that she wanted to consult her
husband about the greenhouses, would have caused her to lay so unusual an
injunction on her attendant; and even now she was detached enough to note in
Trimmle's eye the dawning defiance of the respectful subordinate who has been
pressed too hard.</p>
<p>"I couldn't exactly say the hour, Madam, because I didn't let the gentleman
in," she replied, with the air of magnanimously ignoring the irregularity of
her mistress's course.</p>
<p>"You didn't let him in?"</p>
<p>"No, Madam. When the bell rang I was dressing, and Agnes&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Go and ask Agnes, then," Mary interjected. Trimmle still wore her look of
patient magnanimity. "Agnes would not know, Madam, for she had unfortunately
burnt her hand in trying the wick of the new lamp from town&#8212;" Trimmle, as
Mary was aware, had always been opposed to the new lamp&#8212;"and so Mrs.
Dockett sent the kitchen-maid instead."</p>
<p>Mary looked again at the clock. "It's after two! Go and ask the kitchen-maid
if Mr. Boyne left any word."</p>
<p>She went into luncheon without waiting, and Trimmle presently brought her
there the kitchen-maid's statement that the gentleman had called about one
o'clock, that Mr. Boyne had gone out with him without leaving any message. The
kitchen-maid did not even know the caller's name, for he had written it on a
slip of paper, which he had folded and handed to her, with the injunction to
deliver it at once to Mr. Boyne.</p>
<p>Mary finished her luncheon, still wondering, and when it was over, and
Trimmle had brought the coffee to the drawing-room, her wonder had deepened to
a first faint tinge of disquietude. It was unlike Boyne to absent himself
without explanation at so unwonted an hour, and the difficulty of identifying
the visitor whose summons he had apparently obeyed made his disappearance the
more unaccountable. Mary Boyne's experience as the wife of a busy engineer,
subject to sudden calls and compelled to keep irregular hours, had trained her
to the philosophic acceptance of surprises; but since Boyne's withdrawal from
business he had adopted a Benedictine regularity of life. As if to make up for
the dispersed and agitated years, with their "stand-up" lunches and dinners
rattled down to the joltings of the dining-car, he cultivated the last
refinements of punctuality and monotony, discouraging his wife's fancy for the
unexpected; and declaring that to a delicate taste there were infinite
gradations of pleasure in the fixed recurrences of habit.</p>
<p>Still, since no life can completely defend itself from the unforeseen, it
was evident that all Boyne's precautions would sooner or later prove
unavailable, and Mary concluded that he had cut short a tiresome visit by
walking with his caller to the station, or at least accompanying him for part
of the way.</p>
<p>This conclusion relieved her from farther preoccupation, and she went out
herself to take up her conference with the gardener. Thence she walked to the
village post-office, a mile or so away; and when she turned toward home, the
early twilight was setting in.</p>
<p>She had taken a foot-path across the downs, and as Boyne, meanwhile, had
probably returned from the station by the highroad, there was little likelihood
of their meeting on the way. She felt sure, however, of his having reached the
house before her; so sure that, when she entered it herself, without even
pausing to inquire of Trimmle, she made directly for the library. But the
library was still empty, and with an unwonted precision of visual memory she
immediately observed that the papers on her husband's desk lay precisely as
they had lain when she had gone in to call him to luncheon.</p>
<p>Then of a sudden she was seized by a vague dread of the unknown. She had
closed the door behind her on entering, and as she stood alone in the long,
silent, shadowy room, her dread seemed to take shape and sound, to be there
audibly breathing and lurking among the shadows. Her short-sighted eyes
strained through them, half- discerning an actual presence, something aloof,
that watched and knew; and in the recoil from that intangible propinquity she
threw herself suddenly on the bell-rope and gave it a desperate pull.</p>
<p>The long, quavering summons brought Trimmle in precipitately with a lamp,
and Mary breathed again at this sobering reappearance of the usual.</p>
<p>"You may bring tea if Mr. Boyne is in," she said, to justify her ring.</p>
<p>"Very well, Madam. But Mr. Boyne is not in," said Trimmle, putting down the
lamp.</p>
<p>"Not in? You mean he's come back and gone out again?"</p>
<p>"No, Madam. He's never been back."</p>
<p>The dread stirred again, and Mary knew that now it had her fast.</p>
<p>"Not since he went out with&#8212;the gentleman?"</p>
<p>"Not since he went out with the gentleman."</p>
<p>"But who WAS the gentleman?" Mary gasped out, with the sharp note of some
one trying to be heard through a confusion of meaningless noises.</p>
<p>"That I couldn't say, Madam." Trimmle, standing there by the lamp, seemed
suddenly to grow less round and rosy, as though eclipsed by the same creeping
shade of apprehension.</p>
<p>"But the kitchen-maid knows&#8212;wasn't it the kitchen-maid who let him
in?"</p>
<p>"She doesn't know either, Madam, for he wrote his name on a folded
paper."</p>
<p>Mary, through her agitation, was aware that they were both designating the
unknown visitor by a vague pronoun, instead of the conventional formula which,
till then, had kept their allusions within the bounds of custom. And at the
same moment her mind caught at the suggestion of the folded paper.</p>
<p>"But he must have a name! Where is the paper?"</p>
<p>She moved to the desk, and began to turn over the scattered documents that
littered it. The first that caught her eye was an unfinished letter in her
husband's hand, with his pen lying across it, as though dropped there at a
sudden summons.</p>
<p>"My dear Parvis,"&#8212;who was Parvis?&#8212;"I have just received your
letter announcing Elwell's death, and while I suppose there is now no farther
risk of trouble, it might be safer&#8212;"</p>
<p>She tossed the sheet aside, and continued her search; but no folded paper
was discoverable among the letters and pages of manuscript which had been swept
together in a promiscuous heap, as if by a hurried or a startled gesture.</p>
<p>"But the kitchen-maid SAW him. Send her here," she commanded, wondering at
her dullness in not thinking sooner of so simple a solution.</p>
<p>Trimmle, at the behest, vanished in a flash, as if thankful to be out of the
room, and when she reappeared, conducting the agitated underling, Mary had
regained her self-possession, and had her questions pat.</p>
<p>The gentleman was a stranger, yes&#8212;that she understood. But what had he
said? And, above all, what had he looked like? The first question was easily
enough answered, for the disconcerting reason that he had said so
little&#8212;had merely asked for Mr. Boyne, and, scribbling something on a bit
of paper, had requested that it should at once be carried in to him.</p>
<p>"Then you don't know what he wrote? You're not sure it WAS his name?"</p>
<p>The kitchen-maid was not sure, but supposed it was, since he had written it
in answer to her inquiry as to whom she should announce.</p>
<p>"And when you carried the paper in to Mr. Boyne, what did he say?"</p>
<p>The kitchen-maid did not think that Mr. Boyne had said anything, but she
could not be sure, for just as she had handed him the paper and he was opening
it, she had become aware that the visitor had followed her into the library,
and she had slipped out, leaving the two gentlemen together.</p>
<p>"But then, if you left them in the library, how do you know that they went
out of the house?"</p>
<p>This question plunged the witness into momentary inarticulateness, from
which she was rescued by Trimmle, who, by means of ingenious circumlocutions,
elicited the statement that before she could cross the hall to the back passage
she had heard the gentlemen behind her, and had seen them go out of the front
door together.</p>
<p>"Then, if you saw the gentleman twice, you must be able to tell me what he
looked like."</p>
<p>But with this final challenge to her powers of expression it became clear
that the limit of the kitchen-maid's endurance had been reached. The obligation
of going to the front door to "show in" a visitor was in itself so subversive
of the fundamental order of things that it had thrown her faculties into
hopeless disarray, and she could only stammer out, after various panting
efforts at evocation, "His hat, mum, was different-like, as you might
say&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Different? How different?" Mary flashed out at her, her own mind, in the
same instant, leaping back to an image left on it that morning, but temporarily
lost under layers of subsequent impressions.</p>
<p>"His hat had a wide brim, you mean? and his face was pale&#8212;a youngish
face?" Mary pressed her, with a white-lipped intensity of interrogation. But if
the kitchen-maid found any adequate answer to this challenge, it was swept away
for her listener down the rushing current of her own convictions. The
stranger&#8212;the stranger in the garden! Why had Mary not thought of him
before? She needed no one now to tell her that it was he who had called for her
husband and gone away with him. But who was he, and why had Boyne obeyed his
call?</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_5" id="1_0_5">IV</a></h3>
<p>It leaped out at her suddenly, like a grin out of the dark, that they had
often called England so little&#8212;"such a confoundedly hard place to get
lost in."</p>
<p>A CONFOUNDEDLY HARD PLACE TO GET LOST IN! That had been her husband's
phrase. And now, with the whole machinery of official investigation sweeping
its flash-lights from shore to shore, and across the dividing straits; now,
with Boyne's name blazing from the walls of every town and village, his
portrait (how that wrung her!) hawked up and down the country like the image of
a hunted criminal; now the little compact, populous island, so policed,
surveyed, and administered, revealed itself as a Sphinx-like guardian of
abysmal mysteries, staring back into his wife's anguished eyes as if with the
malicious joy of knowing something they would never know!</p>
<p>In the fortnight since Boyne's disappearance there had been no word of him,
no trace of his movements. Even the usual misleading reports that raise
expectancy in tortured bosoms had been few and fleeting. No one but the
bewildered kitchen-maid had seen him leave the house, and no one else had seen
"the gentleman" who accompanied him. All inquiries in the neighborhood failed
to elicit the memory of a stranger's presence that day in the neighborhood of
Lyng. And no one had met Edward Boyne, either alone or in company, in any of
the neighboring villages, or on the road across the downs, or at either of the
local railway-stations. The sunny English noon had swallowed him as completely
as if he had gone out into Cimmerian night.</p>
<p>Mary, while every external means of investigation was working at its highest
pressure, had ransacked her husband's papers for any trace of antecedent
complications, of entanglements or obligations unknown to her, that might throw
a faint ray into the darkness. But if any such had existed in the background of
Boyne's life, they had disappeared as completely as the slip of paper on which
the visitor had written his name. There remained no possible thread of guidance
except&#8212;if it were indeed an exception&#8212;the letter which Boyne had
apparently been in the act of writing when he received his mysterious summons.
That letter, read and reread by his wife, and submitted by her to the police,
yielded little enough for conjecture to feed on.</p>
<p>"I have just heard of Elwell's death, and while I suppose there is now no
farther risk of trouble, it might be safer&#8212;" That was all. The "risk of
trouble" was easily explained by the newspaper clipping which had apprised Mary
of the suit brought against her husband by one of his associates in the Blue
Star enterprise. The only new information conveyed in the letter was the fact
of its showing Boyne, when he wrote it, to be still apprehensive of the results
of the suit, though he had assured his wife that it had been withdrawn, and
though the letter itself declared that the plaintiff was dead. It took several
weeks of exhaustive cabling to fix the identity of the "Parvis" to whom the
fragmentary communication was addressed, but even after these inquiries had
shown him to be a Waukesha lawyer, no new facts concerning the Elwell suit were
elicited. He appeared to have had no direct concern in it, but to have been
conversant with the facts merely as an acquaintance, and possible intermediary;
and he declared himself unable to divine with what object Boyne intended to
seek his assistance.</p>
<p>This negative information, sole fruit of the first fortnight's feverish
search, was not increased by a jot during the slow weeks that followed. Mary
knew that the investigations were still being carried on, but she had a vague
sense of their gradually slackening, as the actual march of time seemed to
slacken. It was as though the days, flying horror-struck from the shrouded
image of the one inscrutable day, gained assurance as the distance lengthened,
till at last they fell back into their normal gait. And so with the human
imaginations at work on the dark event. No doubt it occupied them still, but
week by week and hour by hour it grew less absorbing, took up less space, was
slowly but inevitably crowded out of the foreground of consciousness by the new
problems perpetually bubbling up from the vaporous caldron of human
experience.</p>
<p>Even Mary Boyne's consciousness gradually felt the same lowering of
velocity. It still swayed with the incessant oscillations of conjecture; but
they were slower, more rhythmical in their beat. There were moments of
overwhelming lassitude when, like the victim of some poison which leaves the
brain clear, but holds the body motionless, she saw herself domesticated with
the Horror, accepting its perpetual presence as one of the fixed conditions of
life.</p>
<p>These moments lengthened into hours and days, till she passed into a phase
of stolid acquiescence. She watched the familiar routine of life with the
incurious eye of a savage on whom the meaningless processes of civilization
make but the faintest impression. She had come to regard herself as part of the
routine, a spoke of the wheel, revolving with its motion; she felt almost like
the furniture of the room in which she sat, an insensate object to be dusted
and pushed about with the chairs and tables. And this deepening apathy held her
fast at Lyng, in spite of the urgent entreaties of friends and the usual
medical recommendation of "change." Her friends supposed that her refusal to
move was inspired by the belief that her husband would one day return to the
spot from which he had vanished, and a beautiful legend grew up about this
imaginary state of waiting. But in reality she had no such belief: the depths
of anguish inclosing her were no longer lighted by flashes of hope. She was
sure that Boyne would never come back, that he had gone out of her sight as
completely as if Death itself had waited that day on the threshold. She had
even renounced, one by one, the various theories as to his disappearance which
had been advanced by the press, the police, and her own agonized imagination.
In sheer lassitude her mind turned from these alternatives of horror, and sank
back into the blank fact that he was gone.</p>
<p>No, she would never know what had become of him&#8212;no one would ever
know. But the house KNEW; the library in which she spent her long, lonely
evenings knew. For it was here that the last scene had been enacted, here that
the stranger had come, and spoken the word which had caused Boyne to rise and
follow him. The floor she trod had felt his tread; the books on the shelves had
seen his face; and there were moments when the intense consciousness of the
old, dusky walls seemed about to break out into some audible revelation of
their secret. But the revelation never came, and she knew it would never come.
Lyng was not one of the garrulous old houses that betray the secrets intrusted
to them. Its very legend proved that it had always been the mute accomplice,
the incorruptible custodian of the mysteries it had surprised. And Mary Boyne,
sitting face to face with its portentous silence, felt the futility of seeking
to break it by any human means.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_6" id="1_0_6">V</a></h3>
<p>"I don't say it WASN'T straight, yet don't say it WAS straight. It was
business."</p>
<p>Mary, at the words, lifted her head with a start, and looked intently at the
speaker.</p>
<p>When, half an hour before, a card with "Mr. Parvis" on it had been brought
up to her, she had been immediately aware that the name had been a part of her
consciousness ever since she had read it at the head of Boyne's unfinished
letter. In the library she had found awaiting her a small neutral-tinted man
with a bald head and gold eye-glasses, and it sent a strange tremor through her
to know that this was the person to whom her husband's last known thought had
been directed.</p>
<p>Parvis, civilly, but without vain preamble,&#8212;in the manner of a man who
has his watch in his hand,&#8212;had set forth the object of his visit. He had
"run over" to England on business, and finding himself in the neighborhood of
Dorchester, had not wished to leave it without paying his respects to Mrs.
Boyne; without asking her, if the occasion offered, what she meant to do about
Bob Elwell's family.</p>
<p>The words touched the spring of some obscure dread in Mary's bosom. Did her
visitor, after all, know what Boyne had meant by his unfinished phrase? She
asked for an elucidation of his question, and noticed at once that he seemed
surprised at her continued ignorance of the subject. Was it possible that she
really knew as little as she said?</p>
<p>"I know nothing&#8212;you must tell me," she faltered out; and her visitor
thereupon proceeded to unfold his story. It threw, even to her confused
perceptions, and imperfectly initiated vision, a lurid glare on the whole hazy
episode of the Blue Star Mine. Her husband had made his money in that brilliant
speculation at the cost of "getting ahead" of some one less alert to seize the
chance; the victim of his ingenuity was young Robert Elwell, who had "put him
on" to the Blue Star scheme.</p>
<p>Parvis, at Mary's first startled cry, had thrown her a sobering glance
through his impartial glasses.</p>
<p>"Bob Elwell wasn't smart enough, that's all; if he had been, he might have
turned round and served Boyne the same way. It's the kind of thing that happens
every day in business. I guess it's what the scientists call the survival of
the fittest," said Mr. Parvis, evidently pleased with the aptness of his
analogy.</p>
<p>Mary felt a physical shrinking from the next question she tried to frame; it
was as though the words on her lips had a taste that nauseated her.</p>
<p>"But then&#8212;you accuse my husband of doing something dishonorable?"</p>
<p>Mr. Parvis surveyed the question dispassionately. "Oh, no, I don't. I don't
even say it wasn't straight." He glanced up and down the long lines of books,
as if one of them might have supplied him with the definition he sought. "I
don't say it WASN'T straight, and yet I don't say it WAS straight. It was
business." After all, no definition in his category could be more comprehensive
than that.</p>
<p>Mary sat staring at him with a look of terror. He seemed to her like the
indifferent, implacable emissary of some dark, formless power.</p>
<p>"But Mr. Elwell's lawyers apparently did not take your view, since I suppose
the suit was withdrawn by their advice."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, they knew he hadn't a leg to stand on, technically. It was when
they advised him to withdraw the suit that he got desperate. You see, he'd
borrowed most of the money he lost in the Blue Star, and he was up a tree.
That's why he shot himself when they told him he had no show."</p>
<p>The horror was sweeping over Mary in great, deafening waves.</p>
<p>"He shot himself? He killed himself because of THAT? "</p>
<p>"Well, he didn't kill himself, exactly. He dragged on two months before he
died." Parvis emitted the statement as unemotionally as a gramophone grinding
out its "record."</p>
<p>"You mean that he tried to kill himself, and failed? And tried again?"</p>
<p>"Oh, he didn't have to try again," said Parvis, grimly.</p>
<p>They sat opposite each other in silence, he swinging his eye- glass
thoughtfully about his finger, she, motionless, her arms stretched along her
knees in an attitude of rigid tension.</p>
<p>"But if you knew all this," she began at length, hardly able to force her
voice above a whisper, "how is it that when I wrote you at the time of my
husband's disappearance you said you didn't understand his letter?"</p>
<p>Parvis received this without perceptible discomfiture. "Why, I didn't
understand it&#8212;strictly speaking. And it wasn't the time to talk about it,
if I had. The Elwell business was settled when the suit was withdrawn. Nothing
I could have told you would have helped you to find your husband."</p>
<p>Mary continued to scrutinize him. "Then why are you telling me now?"</p>
<p>Still Parvis did not hesitate. "Well, to begin with, I supposed you knew
more than you appear to&#8212;I mean about the circumstances of Elwell's death.
And then people are talking of it now; the whole matter's been raked up again.
And I thought, if you didn't know, you ought to."</p>
<p>She remained silent, and he continued: "You see, it's only come out lately
what a bad state Elwell's affairs were in. His wife's a proud woman, and she
fought on as long as she could, going out to work, and taking sewing at home,
when she got too sick&#8212; something with the heart, I believe. But she had
his bedridden mother to look after, and the children, and she broke down under
it, and finally had to ask for help. That attracted attention to the case, and
the papers took it up, and a subscription was started. Everybody out there
liked Bob Elwell, and most of the prominent names in the place are down on the
list, and people began to wonder why&#8212;"</p>
<p>Parvis broke off to fumble in an inner pocket. "Here," he continued, "here's
an account of the whole thing from the 'Sentinel'&#8212;a little sensational,
of course. But I guess you'd better look it over."</p>
<p>He held out a newspaper to Mary, who unfolded it slowly, remembering, as she
did so, the evening when, in that same room, the perusal of a clipping from the
"Sentinel" had first shaken the depths of her security.</p>
<p>As she opened the paper, her eyes, shrinking from the glaring head-lines,
"Widow of Boyne's Victim Forced to Appeal for Aid," ran down the column of text
to two portraits inserted in it. The first was her husband's, taken from a
photograph made the year they had come to England. It was the picture of him
that she liked best, the one that stood on the writing-table up-stairs in her
bedroom. As the eyes in the photograph met hers, she felt it would be
impossible to read what was said of him, and closed her lids with the sharpness
of the pain.</p>
<p>"I thought if you felt disposed to put your name down&#8212;" she heard
Parvis continue.</p>
<p>She opened her eyes with an effort, and they fell on the other portrait. It
was that of a youngish man, slightly built, in rough clothes, with features
somewhat blurred by the shadow of a projecting hat-brim. Where had she seen
that outline before? She stared at it confusedly, her heart hammering in her
throat and ears. Then she gave a cry.</p>
<p>"This is the man&#8212;the man who came for my husband!"</p>
<p>She heard Parvis start to his feet, and was dimly aware that she had slipped
backward into the corner of the sofa, and that he was bending above her in
alarm. With an intense effort she straightened herself, and reached out for the
paper, which she had dropped.</p>
<p>"It's the man! I should know him anywhere!" she cried in a voice that
sounded in her own ears like a scream.</p>
<p>Parvis's voice seemed to come to her from far off, down endless, fog-muffled
windings.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Boyne, you're not very well. Shall I call somebody? Shall I get a
glass of water?"</p>
<p>"No, no, no!" She threw herself toward him, her hand frantically clenching
the newspaper. "I tell you, it's the man! I KNOW him! He spoke to me in the
garden!"</p>
<p>Parvis took the journal from her, directing his glasses to the portrait. "It
can't be, Mrs. Boyne. It's Robert Elwell."</p>
<p>"Robert Elwell?" Her white stare seemed to travel into space. "Then it was
Robert Elwell who came for him."</p>
<p>"Came for Boyne? The day he went away?" Parvis's voice dropped as hers rose.
He bent over, laying a fraternal hand on her, as if to coax her gently back
into her seat. "Why, Elwell was dead! Don't you remember?"</p>
<p>Mary sat with her eyes fixed on the picture, unconscious of what he was
saying.</p>
<p>"Don't you remember Boyne's unfinished letter to me&#8212;the one you found
on his desk that day? It was written just after he'd heard of Elwell's death."
She noticed an odd shake in Parvis's unemotional voice. "Surely you remember
that!" he urged her.</p>
<p>Yes, she remembered: that was the profoundest horror of it. Elwell had died
the day before her husband's disappearance; and this was Elwell's portrait; and
it was the portrait of the man who had spoken to her in the garden. She lifted
her head and looked slowly about the library. The library could have borne
witness that it was also the portrait of the man who had come in that day to
call Boyne from his unfinished letter. Through the misty surgings of her brain
she heard the faint boom of half- forgotten words&#8212;words spoken by Alida
Stair on the lawn at Pangbourne before Boyne and his wife had ever seen the
house at Lyng, or had imagined that they might one day live there.</p>
<p>"This was the man who spoke to me," she repeated.</p>
<p>She looked again at Parvis. He was trying to conceal his disturbance under
what he imagined to be an expression of indulgent commiseration; but the edges
of his lips were blue. "He thinks me mad; but I'm not mad," she reflected; and
suddenly there flashed upon her a way of justifying her strange
affirmation.</p>
<p>She sat quiet, controlling the quiver of her lips, and waiting till she
could trust her voice to keep its habitual level; then she said, looking
straight at Parvis: "Will you answer me one question, please? When was it that
Robert Elwell tried to kill himself?"</p>
<p>"When&#8212;when?" Parvis stammered.</p>
<p>"Yes; the date. Please try to remember."</p>
<p>She saw that he was growing still more afraid of her. "I have a reason," she
insisted gently.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes. Only I can't remember. About two months before, I should
say."</p>
<p>"I want the date," she repeated.</p>
<p>Parvis picked up the newspaper. "We might see here," he said, still humoring
her. He ran his eyes down the page. "Here it is. Last
October&#8212;the&#8212;"</p>
<p>She caught the words from him. "The 20th, wasn't it?" With a sharp look at
her, he verified. "Yes, the 20th. Then you DID know?"</p>
<p>"I know now." Her white stare continued to travel past him. "Sunday, the
20th&#8212;that was the day he came first."</p>
<p>Parvis's voice was almost inaudible. "Came HERE first?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"You saw him twice, then?"</p>
<p>"Yes, twice." She breathed it at him with dilated eyes. "He came first on
the 20th of October. I remember the date because it was the day we went up
Meldon Steep for the first time." She felt a faint gasp of inward laughter at
the thought that but for that she might have forgotten.</p>
<p>Parvis continued to scrutinize her, as if trying to intercept her gaze.</p>
<p>"We saw him from the roof," she went on. "He came down the lime- avenue
toward the house. He was dressed just as he is in that picture. My husband saw
him first. He was frightened, and ran down ahead of me; but there was no one
there. He had vanished."</p>
<p>"Elwell had vanished?" Parvis faltered.</p>
<p>"Yes." Their two whispers seemed to grope for each other. "I couldn't think
what had happened. I see now. He TRIED to come then; but he wasn't dead
enough&#8212;he couldn't reach us. He had to wait for two months; and then he
came back again&#8212;and Ned went with him."</p>
<p>She nodded at Parvis with the look of triumph of a child who has
successfully worked out a difficult puzzle. But suddenly she lifted her hands
with a desperate gesture, pressing them to her bursting temples.</p>
<p>"Oh, my God! I sent him to Ned&#8212;I told him where to go! I sent him to
this room!" she screamed out.</p>
<p>She felt the walls of the room rush toward her, like inward falling ruins;
and she heard Parvis, a long way off, as if through the ruins, crying to her,
and struggling to get at her. But she was numb to his touch, she did not know
what he was saying. Through the tumult she heard but one clear note, the voice
of Alida Stair, speaking on the lawn at Pangbourne.</p>
<p>"You won't know till afterward," it said. "You won't know till long, long
afterward."</p>
