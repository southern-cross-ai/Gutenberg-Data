<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>THE RELUCTANT VOYAGERS</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Chapter I</h3>

<p>Two men sat by the sea waves.</p>

<p>"Well, I know I'm not handsome," said one gloomily. He was
poking holes in the sand with a discontented cane.</p>

<p>The companion was watching the waves play. He seemed overcome
with perspiring discomfort as a man who is resolved to set another
man right.</p>

<p>Suddenly his mouth turned into a straight line. "To be sure you
are not," he cried vehemently. "You look like thunder. I do not
desire to be unpleasant, but I must assure you that your freckled
skin continually reminds spectators of white wall paper with gilt
roses on it. The top of your head looks like a little wooden plate.
And your figure&mdash;heavens!"</p>

<p>For a time they were silent. They stared at the waves that
purred near their feet like sleepy sea-kittens.</p>

<p>Finally the first man spoke.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, defiantly, "what of it?"</p>

<p>"What of it," exploded the other. "Why, it means that you'd look
like blazes in a bathing-suit."</p>

<p>They were again silent. The freckled man seemed ashamed. His
tall companion glowered at the scenery.</p>

<p>"I am decided," said the freckled man suddenly. He got boldly up
from the sand and strode away. The tall man followed, walking
sarcastically and glaring down at the round, resolute figure before
him.</p>

<p>A bath-clerk was looking at the world with superior eyes through
a hole in a board. To him the freckled man made application, waving
his hands over his person in illustration of a snug fit. The
bath-clerk thought profoundly. Eventually, he handed out a blue
bundle with an air of having phenomenally solved the freckled man's
dimensions.</p>

<p>The latter resumed his resolute stride.</p>

<p>"See here," said the tall man, following him, "I bet you've got
a regular toga, you know. That fellow couldn't tell&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, he could," interrupted the freckled man, "I saw correct
mathematics in his eyes."</p>

<p>"Well, supposin' he has missed your size. Supposin'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tom," again interrupted the other, "produce your proud clothes
and we'll go in."</p>

<p>The tall man swore bitterly. He went to one of a row of little
wooden boxes and shut himself in it. His companion repaired to a
similar box.</p>

<p>At first he felt like an opulent monk in a too-small cell, and
he turned round two or three times to see if he could. He arrived
finally into his bathing-dress. Immediately he dropped gasping upon
a three-cornered bench. The suit fell in folds about his reclining
form. There was silence, save for the caressing calls of the waves
without.</p>

<p>Then he heard two shoes drop on the floor in one of the little
coops. He began to clamour at the boards like a penitent at an
unforgiving door.</p>

<p>"Tom," called he, "Tom&mdash;"</p>

<p>A voice of wrath, muffled by cloth, came through the walls. "You
go t' blazes!"</p>

<p>The freckled man began to groan, taking the occupants of the
entire row of coops into his confidence.</p>

<p>"Stop your noise," angrily cried the tall man from his hidden
den. "You rented the bathing-suit, didn't you? Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It ain't a bathing-suit," shouted the freckled man at the
boards. "It's an auditorium, a ballroom, or something. It ain't a
bathing-suit."</p>

<p>The tall man came out of his box. His suit looked like blue
skin. He walked with grandeur down the alley between the rows of
coops. Stopping in front of his friend's door, he rapped on it with
passionate knuckles.</p>

<p>"Come out of there, y' ol' fool," said he, in an enraged
whisper. "It's only your accursed vanity. Wear it anyhow. What
difference does it make? I never saw such a vain ol' idiot!"</p>

<p>As he was storming the door opened, and his friend confronted
him. The tall man's legs gave way, and he fell against the opposite
door.</p>

<p>The freckled man regarded him sternly.</p>

<p>"You're an ass," he said.</p>

<p>His back curved in scorn. He walked majestically down the alley.
There was pride in the way his chubby feet patted the boards. The
tall man followed, weakly, his eyes riveted upon the figure
ahead.</p>

<p>As a disguise the freckled man had adopted the stomach of
importance. He moved with an air of some sort of procession, across
a board walk, down some steps, and out upon the sand.</p>

<p>There was a pug dog and three old women on a bench, a man and a
maid with a book and a parasol, a seagull drifting high in the
wind, and a distant, tremendous meeting of sea and sky. Down on the
wet sand stood a girl being wooed by the breakers.</p>

<p>The freckled man moved with stately tread along the beach. The
tall man, numb with amazement, came in the rear. They neared the
girl.</p>

<p>Suddenly the tall man was seized with convulsions. He laughed,
and the girl turned her head.</p>

<p>She perceived the freckled man in the bathing-suit. An
expression of wonderment overspread her charming face. It changed
in a moment to a pearly smile.</p>

<p>This smile seemed to smite the freckled man. He obviously tried
to swell and fit his suit. Then he turned a shrivelling glance upon
his companion, and fled up the beach. The tall man ran after him,
pursuing with mocking cries that tingled his flesh like stings of
insects. He seemed to be trying to lead the way out of the world.
But at last he stopped and faced about.</p>

<p>"Tom Sharp," said he, between his clenched teeth, "you are an
unutterable wretch! I could grind your bones under my heel."</p>

<p>The tall man was in a trance, with glazed eyes fixed on the
bathing-dress. He seemed to be murmuring: "Oh, good Lord! Oh, good
Lord! I never saw such a suit!"</p>

<p>The freckled man made the gesture of an assassin.</p>

<p>"Tom Sharp, you&mdash;"</p>

<p>The other was still murmuring: "Oh, good Lord! I never saw such
a suit! I never&mdash;"</p>

<p>The freckled man ran down into the sea.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Chapter II</h3>

<p>The cool, swirling waters took his temper from him, and it
became a thing that is lost in the ocean. The tall man floundered
in, and the two forgot and rollicked in the waves.</p>

<p>The freckled man, in endeavouring to escape from mankind, had
left all save a solitary fisherman under a large hat, and three
boys in bathing-dress, laughing and splashing upon a raft made of
old spars.</p>

<p>The two men swam softly over the ground swells.</p>

<p>The three boys dived from their raft, and turned their jolly
faces shorewards. It twisted slowly around and around, and began to
move seaward on some unknown voyage. The freckled man laid his face
to the water and swam toward the raft with a practised stroke. The
tall man followed, his bended arm appearing and disappearing with
the precision of machinery.</p>

<p>The craft crept away, slowly and wearily, as if luring. The
little wooden plate on the freckled man's head looked at the shore
like a round, brown eye, but his gaze was fixed on the raft that
slyly appeared to be waiting. The tall man used the little wooden
plate as a beacon.</p>

<p>At length the freckled man reached the raft and climbed aboard.
He lay down on his back and puffed. His bathing-dress spread about
him like a dead balloon. The tall man came, snorted, shook his
tangled locks and lay down by the side of his companion.</p>

<p>They were overcome with a delicious drowsiness. The planks of
the raft seemed to fit their tired limbs. They gazed dreamily up
into the vast sky of summer.</p>

<p>"This is great," said the tall man. His companion grunted
blissfully.</p>

<p>Gentle hands from the sea rocked their craft and lulled them to
peace. Lapping waves sang little rippling sea-songs about them. The
two men issued contented groans.</p>

<p>"Tom," said the freckled man.</p>

<p>"What?" said the other.</p>

<p>"This is great."</p>

<p>They lay and thought.</p>

<p>A fish-hawk, soaring, suddenly turned and darted at the waves.
The tall man indolently twisted his head and watched the bird
plunge its claws into the water. It heavily arose with a silver
gleaming fish.</p>

<p>"That bird has got his feet wet again. It's a shame," murmured
the tall man sleepily. "He must suffer from an endless cold in the
head. He should wear rubber boots. They'd look great, too. If I was
him, I'd&mdash;Great Scott!"</p>

<p>He has partly arisen, and was looking at the shore.</p>

<p>He began to scream. "Ted! Ted! Ted! Look!"</p>

<p>"What's matter?" dreamily spoke the freckled man. "You remind me
of when I put the bird-shot in your leg." He giggled softly.</p>

<p>The agitated tall man made a gesture of supreme eloquence. His
companion up-reared and turned a startled gaze shoreward.</p>

<p>"Lord," he roared, as if stabbed.</p>

<p>The land was a long, brown streak with a rim of green, in which
sparkled the tin roofs of huge hotels. The hands from the sea had
pushed them away. The two men sprang erect, and did a little dance
of perturbation.</p>

<p>"What shall we do? What shall we do?" moaned the freckled man,
wriggling fantastically in his dead balloon.</p>

<p>The changing shore seemed to fascinate the tall man, and for a
time he did not speak.</p>

<p>Suddenly he concluded his minuet of horror. He wheeled about and
faced the freckled man. He elaborately folded his arms.</p>

<p>"So," he said, in slow, formidable tones. "So! This all comes
from your accursed vanity, your bathing-suit, your idiocy; you have
murdered your best friend."</p>

<p>He turned away. His companion reeled as if stricken by an
unexpected arm.</p>

<p>He stretched out his hands. "Tom, Tom," wailed he, beseechingly,
"don't be such a fool."</p>

<p>The broad back of his friend was occupied by a contemptuous
sneer.</p>

<p>Three ships fell off the horizon. Landward, the hues were
blending. The whistle of a locomotive sounded from an infinite
distance as if tooting in heaven.</p>

<p>"Tom! Tom! My dear boy," quavered the freckled man, "don't speak
that way to me."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, of course not," said the other, still facing away and
throwing the words over his shoulder. "You suppose I am going to
accept all this calmly, don't you? Not make the slightest
objection? Make no protest at all, hey?"</p>

<p>"Well, I&mdash;I&mdash;" began the freckled man.</p>

<p>The tall man's wrath suddenly exploded. "You've abducted me!
That's the whole amount of it! You've abducted me!"</p>

<p>"I ain't," protested the freckled man. "You must think I'm a
fool."</p>

<p>The tall man swore, and sitting down, dangled his legs angrily
in the water. Natural law compelled his companion to occupy the
other end of the raft.</p>

<p>Over the waters little shoals of fish spluttered, raising tiny
tempests. Languid jelly-fish floated near, tremulously waving a
thousand legs. A row of porpoises trundled along like a procession
of cog-wheels. The sky became greyed save where over the land
sunset colours were assembling.</p>

<p>The two voyagers, back to back and at either end of the raft,
quarrelled at length.</p>

<p>"What did you want to follow me for?" demanded the freckled man
in a voice of indignation.</p>

<p>"If your figure hadn't been so like a bottle, we wouldn't be
here," replied the tall man.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Chapter III</h3>

<p>The fires in the west blazed away, and solemnity spread over the
sea. Electric lights began to blink like eyes. Night menaced the
voyagers with a dangerous darkness, and fear came to bind their
souls together. They huddled fraternally in the middle of the
raft.</p>

<p>"I feel like a molecule," said the freckled man in subdued
tones.</p>

<p>"I'd give two dollars for a cigar," muttered the tall man.</p>

<p>A V-shaped flock of ducks flew towards Barnegat, between the
voyagers and a remnant of yellow sky. Shadows and winds came from
the vanished eastern horizon.</p>

<p>"I think I hear voices," said the freckled man.</p>

<p>"That Dollie Ramsdell was an awfully nice girl," said the tall
man.</p>

<p>When the coldness of the sea night came to them, the freckled
man found he could by a peculiar movement of his legs and arms
encase himself in his bathing-dress. The tall man was compelled to
whistle and shiver. As night settled finally over the sea, red and
green lights began to dot the blackness. There were mysterious
shadows between the waves.</p>

<p>"I see things comin'," murmured the freckled man.</p>

<p>"I wish I hadn't ordered that new dress-suit for the hop
to-morrow night," said the tall man reflectively.</p>

<p>The sea became uneasy and heaved painfully, like a lost bosom,
when little forgotten heart-bells try to chime with a pure sound.
The voyagers cringed at magnified foam on distant wave crests. A
moon came and looked at them.</p>

<p>"Somebody's here," whispered the freckled man.</p>

<p>"I wish I had an almanac," remarked the tall man, regarding the
moon.</p>

<p>Presently they fell to staring at the red and green lights that
twinkled about them.</p>

<p>"Providence will not leave us," asserted the freckled man.</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll be picked up shortly. I owe money," said the tall
man.</p>

<p>He began to thrum on an imaginary banjo.</p>

<p>"I have heard," said he, suddenly, "that captains with healthy
ships beneath their feet will never turn back after having once
started on a voyage. In that case we will be rescued by some ship
bound for the golden seas of the south. Then, you'll be up to some
of your confounded devilment, and we'll get put off. They'll maroon
us! That's what they'll do! They'll maroon us! On an island with
palm trees and sun-kissed maidens and all that. Sun-kissed maidens,
eh? Great! They'd&mdash;"</p>

<p>He suddenly ceased and turned to stone. At a distance a great,
green eye was contemplating the sea wanderers.</p>

<p>They stood up and did another dance. As they watched the eye
grew larger.</p>

<p>Directly the form of a phantom-like ship came into view. About
the great, green eye there bobbed small yellow dots. The wanderers
could hear a far-away creaking of unseen tackle and flapping of
shadowy sails. There came the melody of the waters as the ship's
prow thrusted its way.</p>

<p>The tall man delivered an oration.</p>

<p>"Ha!" he exclaimed, "here comes our rescuers. The brave fellows!
How I long to take the manly captain by the hand! You will soon see
a white boat with a star on its bow drop from the side of yon ship.
Kind sailors in blue and white will help us into the boat and
conduct our wasted frames to the quarter-deck, where the handsome,
bearded captain, with gold bands all around, will welcome us. Then
in the hard-oak cabin, while the wine gurgles and the Havana's
glow, we'll tell our tale of peril and privation."</p>

<p>The ship came on like a black hurrying animal with froth-filled
maw. The two wanderers stood up and clasped hands. Then they howled
out a wild duet that rang over the wastes of sea.</p>

<p>The cries seemed to strike the ship.</p>

<p>Men with boots on yelled and ran about the deck. They picked up
heavy articles and threw them down. They yelled more. After hideous
creakings and flappings, the vessel stood still.</p>

<p>In the meantime the wanderers had been chanting their song for
help. Out in the blackness they beckoned to the ship and
coaxed.</p>

<p>A voice came to them.</p>

<p>"Hello," it said.</p>

<p>They puffed out their cheeks and began to shout. "Hello! Hello!
Hello!"</p>

<p>"Wot do yeh want?" said the voice.</p>

<p>The two wanderers gazed at each other, and sat suddenly down on
the raft. Some pall came sweeping over the sky and quenched their
stars.</p>

<p>But almost the tall man got up and brawled miscellaneous
information. He stamped his foot, and frowning into the night,
swore threateningly.</p>

<p>The vessel seemed fearful of these moaning voices that called
from a hidden cavern of the water. And now one voice was filled
with a menace. A number of men with enormous limbs that threw vast
shadows over the sea as the lanterns flickered, held a debate and
made gestures.</p>

<p>Off in the darkness, the tall man began to clamour like a mob.
The freckled man sat in astounded silence, with his legs weak.</p>

<p>After a time one of the men of enormous limbs seized a rope that
was tugging at the stern and drew a small boat from the shadows.
Three giants clambered in and rowed cautiously toward the raft.
Silver water flashed in the gloom as the oars dipped.</p>

<p>About fifty feet from the raft the boat stopped. "Who er you?"
asked a voice.</p>

<p>The tall man braced himself and explained. He drew vivid
pictures, his twirling fingers illustrating like live brushes.</p>

<p>"Oh," said the three giants.</p>

<p>The voyagers deserted the raft. They looked back, feeling in
their hearts a mite of tenderness for the wet planks. Later, they
wriggled up the side of the vessel and climbed over the
railing.</p>

<p>On deck they met a man.</p>

<p>He held a lantern to their faces. "Got any chewin' tewbacca?" he
inquired.</p>

<p>"No," said the tall man, "we ain't."</p>

<p>The man had a bronze face and solitary whiskers. Peculiar lines
about his mouth were shaped into an eternal smile of derision. His
feet were bare, and clung handily to crevices.</p>

<p>Fearful trousers were supported by a piece of suspender that
went up the wrong side of his chest and came down the right side of
his back, dividing him into triangles.</p>

<p>"Ezekiel P. Sanford, capt'in, schooner 'Mary Jones,' of N'yack,
N.Y., genelmen," he said.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the tall man, "delighted, I'm sure."</p>

<p>There were a few moments of silence. The giants were hovering in
the gloom and staring.</p>

<p>Suddenly astonishment exploded the captain.</p>

<p>"Wot th' devil&mdash;" he shouted, "wot th' devil yeh got
on?"</p>

<p>"Bathing-suits," said the tall man.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Chapter IV</h3>

<p>The schooner went on. The two voyagers sat down and watched.
After a time they began to shiver. The soft blackness of the summer
night passed away, and grey mists writhed over the sea. Soon lights
of early dawn went changing across the sky, and the twin beacons on
the highlands grew dim and sparkling faintly, as if a monster were
dying. The dawn penetrated the marrow of the two men in
bathing-dress.</p>

<p>The captain used to pause opposite them, hitch one hand in his
suspender, and laugh.</p>

<p>"Well, I be dog-hanged," he frequently said.</p>

<p>The tall man grew furious. He snarled in a mad undertone to his
companion. "This rescue ain't right. If I had known&mdash;"</p>

<p>He suddenly paused, transfixed by the captain's suspender. "It's
goin' to break," cried he, in an ecstatic whisper. His eyes grew
large with excitement as he watched the captain laugh. "It'll break
in a minute, sure."</p>

<p>But the commander of the schooner recovered, and invited them to
drink and eat. They followed him along the deck, and fell down a
square black hole into the cabin.</p>

<p>It was a little den, with walls of a vanished whiteness. A lamp
shed an orange light. In a sort of recess two little beds were
hiding. A wooden table, immovable, as if the craft had been builded
around it, sat in the middle of the floor. Overhead the square hole
was studded with a dozen stars. A foot-worn ladder led to the
heavens.</p>

<p>The captain produced ponderous crackers and some cold broiled
ham. Then he vanished in the firmament like a fantastic comet.</p>

<p>The freckled man sat quite contentedly like a stout squaw in a
blanket. The tall man walked about the cabin and sniffed. He was
angered at the crudeness of the rescue, and his shrinking clothes
made him feel too large. He contemplated his unhappy state.</p>

<p>Suddenly, he broke out. "I won't stand this, I tell you! Heavens
and earth, look at the&mdash;say, what in the blazes did you want
to get me in this thing for, anyhow? You're a fine old duffer, you
are! Look at that ham!"</p>

<p>The freckled man grunted. He seemed somewhat blissful. He was
seated upon a bench, comfortably enwrapped in his
bathing-dress.</p>

<p>The tall man stormed about the cabin.</p>

<p>"This is an outrage! I'll see the captain! I'll tell him what I
think of&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a pair of legs that appeared among the
stars. The captain came down the ladder. He brought a coffee pot
from the sky.</p>

<p>The tall man bristled forward. He was going to denounce
everything.</p>

<p>The captain was intent upon the coffee pot, balancing it
carefully, and leaving his unguided feet to find the steps of the
ladder.</p>

<p>But the wrath of the tall man faded. He twirled his fingers in
excitement, and renewed his ecstatic whisperings to the freckled
man.</p>

<p>"It's going to break! Look, quick, look! It'll break in a
minute!"</p>

<p>He was transfixed with interest, forgetting his wrongs in
staring at the perilous passage.</p>

<p>But the captain arrived on the floor with triumphant
suspenders.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "after yeh have eat, maybe ye'd like t'sleep
some! If so, yeh can sleep on them beds."</p>

<p>The tall man made no reply, save in a strained undertone. "It'll
break in about a minute! Look, Ted, look quick!"</p>

<p>The freckled man glanced in a little bed on which were heaped
boots and oilskins. He made a courteous gesture.</p>

<p>"My dear sir, we could not think of depriving you of your beds.
No, indeed. Just a couple of blankets if you have them, and we'll
sleep very comfortable on these benches."</p>

<p>The captain protested, politely twisting his back and bobbing
his head. The suspenders tugged and creaked. The tall man partially
suppressed a cry, and took a step forward.</p>

<p>The freckled man was sleepily insistent, and shortly the captain
gave over his deprecatory contortions. He fetched a pink quilt with
yellow dots on it to the freckled man, and a black one with red
roses on it to the tall man.</p>

<p>Again he vanished in the firmament. The tall man gazed until the
last remnant of trousers disappeared from the sky. Then he wrapped
himself up in his quilt and lay down. The freckled man was puffing
contentedly, swathed like an infant. The yellow polka-dots rose and
fell on the vast pink of his chest.</p>

<p>The wanderers slept. In the quiet could be heard the groanings
of timbers as the sea seemed to crunch them together. The lapping
of water along the vessel's side sounded like gaspings. An hundred
spirits of the wind had got their wings entangled in the rigging,
and, in soft voices, were pleading to be loosened.</p>

<p>The freckled man was awakened by a foreign noise. He opened his
eyes and saw his companion standing by his couch.</p>

<p>His comrade's face was wane with suffering. His eyes glowed in
the darkness. He raised his arms, spreading them out like a
clergyman at a grave. He groaned deep in his chest.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" yelled the freckled man, starting up. "Tom, Tom,
what's th' matter?"</p>

<p>The tall man spoke in a fearful voice. "To New York," he said,
"to New York in our bathing-suits."</p>

<p>The freckled man sank back. The shadows of the cabin threw
mysteries about the figure of the tall man, arrayed like some
ancient and potent astrologer in the black quilt with the red roses
on it.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Chapter V</h3>

<p>Directly the tall man went and lay down and began to groan.</p>

<p>The freckled man felt the miseries of the world upon him. He
grew angry at the tall man awakening him. They quarrelled.</p>

<p>"Well," said the tall man, finally, "we're in a fix."</p>

<p>"I know that," said the other, sharply.</p>

<p>They regarded the ceiling in silence.</p>

<p>"What in the thunder are we going to do?" demanded the tall man,
after a time. His companion was still silent. "Say," repeated he,
angrily, "what in the thunder are we going to do?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know," said the freckled man in a dismal
voice.</p>

<p>"Well, think of something," roared the other. "Think of
something, you old fool. You don't want to make any more idiots of
yourself, do you?"</p>

<p>"I ain't made an idiot of myself."</p>

<p>"Well, think. Know anybody in the city?"</p>

<p>"I know a fellow up in Harlem," said the freckled man.</p>

<p>"You know a fellow up in Harlem," howled the tall man. "Up in
Harlem! How the dickens are we to&mdash;say, you're crazy!"</p>

<p>"We can take a cab," cried the other, waxing indignant.</p>

<p>The tall man grew suddenly calm. "Do you know any one else?" he
asked, measuredly.</p>

<p>"I know another fellow somewhere on Park Place."</p>

<p>"Somewhere on Park Place," repeated the tall man in an unnatural
manner. "Somewhere on Park Place." With an air of sublime
resignation he turned his face to the wall.</p>

<p>The freckled man sat erect and frowned in the direction of his
companion. "Well, now, I suppose you are going to sulk. You make me
ill! It's the best we can do, ain't it? Hire a cab and go look that
fellow up on Park&mdash;What's that? You can't afford it? What
nonsense! You are getting&mdash;Oh! Well, maybe we can beg some
clothes of the captain. Eh? Did I see 'im. Certainly, I saw 'im.
Yes, it is improbable that a man who wears trousers like that can
have clothes to lend. No, I won't wear oilskins and a sou'-wester.
To Athens? Of course not! I don't know where it is. Do you? I
thought not. With all your grumbling about other people, you never
know anything important yourself. What? Broadway? I'll be hanged
first. We can get off at Harlem, man alive. There are no cabs in
Harlem. I don't think we can bribe a sailor to take us ashore and
bring a cab to the dock, for the very simple reason that we have
nothing to bribe him with. What? No, of course not. See here, Tom
Sharp, don't you swear at me like that. I won't have it. What's
that? I ain't, either. I ain't. What? I am not. It's no such thing.
I ain't. I've got more than you have, anyway. Well, you ain't doing
anything so very brilliant yourself&mdash;just lying there and
cussin'." At length the tall man feigned to prodigiously snore. The
freckled man thought with such vigour that he fell asleep.</p>

<p>After a time he dreamed that he was in a forest where bass drums
grew on trees. There came a strong wind that banged the fruit about
like empty pods. A frightful din was in his ears.</p>

<p>He awoke to find the captain of the schooner standing over
him.</p>

<p>"We're at New York now," said the captain, raising his voice
above the thumping and banging that was being done on deck, "an' I
s'pose you fellers wanta go ashore." He chuckled in an exasperating
manner. "Jes' sing out when yeh wanta go," he added, leering at the
freckled man.</p>

<p>The tall man awoke, came over and grasped the captain by the
throat.</p>

<p>"If you laugh again I'll kill you," he said.</p>

<p>The captain gurgled and waved his legs and arms.</p>

<p>"In the first place," the tall man continued, "you rescued us in
a deucedly shabby manner. It makes me ill to think of it. I've a
mind to mop you 'round just for that. In the second place, your
vessel is bound for Athens, N.Y., and there's no sense in it. Now,
will you or will you not turn this ship about and take us back
where our clothes are, or to Philadelphia, where we belong?"</p>

<p>He furiously shook the captain. Then he eased his grip and
awaited a reply.</p>

<p>"I can't," yelled the captain, "I can't. This vessel don't
belong to me. I've got to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, then," interrupted the tall man, "can you lend us some
clothes?"</p>

<p>"Hain't got none," replied the captain, promptly. His face was
red, and his eyes were glaring.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said the tall man, "can you lend us some
money?"</p>

<p>"Hain't got none," replied the captain, promptly. Something
overcame him and he laughed.</p>

<p>"Thunderation," roared the tall man. He seized the captain, who
began to have wriggling contortions. The tall man kneaded him as if
he were biscuits. "You infernal scoundrel," he bellowed, "this
whole affair is some wretched plot, and you are in it. I am about
to kill you."</p>

<p>The solitary whisker of the captain did acrobatic feats like a
strange demon upon his chin. His eyes stood perilously from his
head. The suspender wheezed and tugged like the tackle of a
sail.</p>

<p>Suddenly the tall man released his hold. Great expectancy sat
upon his features. "It's going to break," he cried, rubbing his
hands.</p>

<p>But the captain howled and vanished in the sky.</p>

<p>The freckled man then came forward. He appeared filled with
sarcasm.</p>

<p>"So!" said he. "So, you've settled the matter. The captain is
the only man in the world who can help us, and I daresay he'll do
anything he can now."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said the tall man. "If you don't like the
way I run things you shouldn't have come on this trip at all."</p>

<p>They had another quarrel.</p>

<p>At the end of it they went on deck. The captain stood at the
stern addressing the bow with opprobrious language. When he
perceived the voyagers he began to fling his fists about in the
air.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to put yeh off," he yelled. The wanderers stared at
each other.</p>

<p>"Hum," said the tall man.</p>

<p>The freckled man looked at his companion. "He's going to put us
off, you see," he said, complacently.</p>

<p>The tall man began to walk about and move his shoulders. "I'd
like to see you do it," he said, defiantly.</p>

<p>The captain tugged at a rope. A boat came at his bidding.</p>

<p>"I'd like to see you do it," the tall man repeated, continually.
An imperturbable man in rubber boots climbed down in the boat and
seized the oars. The captain motioned downward. His whisker had a
triumphant appearance.</p>

<p>The two wanderers looked at the boat. "I guess we'll have to get
in," murmured the freckled man.</p>

<p>The tall man was standing like a granite column. "I won't," said
he. "I won't! I don't care what you do, but I won't!"</p>

<p>"Well, but&mdash;" expostulated the other. They held a furious
debate.</p>

<p>In the meantime the captain was darting about making sinister
gestures, but the back of the tall man held him at bay. The crew,
much depleted by the departure of the imperturbable man into the
boat, looked on from the bow.</p>

<p>"You're a fool," the freckled man concluded his argument.</p>

<p>"So?" inquired the tall man, highly exasperated.</p>

<p>"So? Well, if you think you're so bright, we'll go in the boat,
and then you'll see."</p>

<p>He climbed down into the craft and seated himself in an ominous
manner at the stern.</p>

<p>"You'll see," he said to his companion, as the latter floundered
heavily down. "You'll see!"</p>

<p>The man in rubber boots calmly rowed the boat toward the shore.
As they went, the captain leaned over the railing and laughed. The
freckled man was seated very victoriously.</p>

<p>"Well, wasn't this the right thing after all?" he inquired in a
pleasant voice. The tall man made no reply.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Chapter VI</h3>

<p>As they neared the dock something seemed suddenly to occur to
the freckled man.</p>

<p>"Great heavens," he murmured. He stared at the approaching
shore.</p>

<p>"My, what a plight, Tommy," he quavered.</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" spoke up the tall man, "Why, I really thought
you liked it." He laughed in a hard voice. "Lord, what a figure
you'll cut."</p>

<p>This laugh jarred the freckled man's soul. He became mad.</p>

<p>"Thunderation, turn the boat around," he roared. "Turn 'er
round, quick. Man alive, we can't&mdash;turn 'er round, d'ye
hear."</p>

<p>The tall man in the stern gazed at his companion with glowing
eyes.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," he said. "We're going on. You insisted upon
it." He began to prod his companion with words.</p>

<p>The freckled man stood up and waved his arms.</p>

<p>"Sit down," said the tall man. "You'll tip the boat over."</p>

<p>The other man began to shout.</p>

<p>"Sit down," said the tall man again.</p>

<p>Words bubbled from the freckled man's mouth. There was a little
torrent of sentences that almost choked him. And he protested
passionately with his hands.</p>

<p>But the boat went on to the shadow of the docks. The tall man
was intent upon balancing it as it rocked dangerously during his
comrade's oration.</p>

<p>"Sit down," he continually repeated.</p>

<p>"I won't," raged the freckled man. "I won't do anything." The
boat wobbled with these words.</p>

<p>"Say," he continued, addressing the oarsman, "just turn this
boat round, will you. Where in the thunder are you taking us to,
anyhow?"</p>

<p>The oarsman looked at the sky and thought. Finally he spoke.
"I'm doin' what the cap'n sed."</p>

<p>"Well, what in th' blazes do I care what the cap'n sed?"
demanded the freckled man. He took a violent step. "You just turn
this round or&mdash;"</p>

<p>The small craft reeled. Over one side water came flashing in.
The freckled man cried out in fear, and gave a jump to the other
side. The tall man roared orders, and the oarsman made efforts. The
boat acted for a moment like an animal on a slackened wire. Then it
upset.</p>

<p>"Sit down," said the tall man, in a final roar as he was plunged
into the water. The oarsman dropped his oars to grapple with the
gunwale. He went down saying unknown words. The freckled man's
explanation or apology was strangled by the water.</p>

<p>Two or three tugs let off whistles of astonishment, and
continued on their paths. A man dosing on a dock aroused and began
to caper. The passengers of a ferry-boat all ran to the near
railing.</p>

<p>A miraculous person in a small boat was bobbing on the waves
near the piers. He sculled hastily toward the scene. It was a swirl
of waters in the midst of which the dark bottom of the boat
appeared, whale-like.</p>

<p>Two heads suddenly came up. "839," said the freckled man,
chokingly. "That's it! 839!"</p>

<p>"What is?" said the tall man.</p>

<p>"That's the number of that feller on Park Place. I just
remembered."</p>

<p>"You're the bloomingest&mdash;" the tall man said.</p>

<p>"It wasn't my fault," interrupted his companion. "If you
hadn't&mdash;" He tried to gesticulate, but one hand held to the
keel of the boat, and the other was supporting the form of the
oarsman. The latter had fought a battle with his immense rubber
boots and had been conquered.</p>

<p>The rescuer in the other small boat came fiercely. As his craft
glided up, he reached out and grasped the tall man by the collar
and dragged him into the boat, interrupting what was, under the
circumstances, a very brilliant flow of rhetoric directed at the
freckled man. The oarsman of the wrecked craft was taken tenderly
over the gunwale and laid in the bottom of the boat. Puffing and
blowing, the freckled man climbed in.</p>

<p>"You'll upset this one before we can get ashore," the other
voyager remarked.</p>

<p>As they turned toward the land they saw that the nearest dock
was lined with people. The freckled man gave a little moan.</p>

<p>But the staring eyes of the crowd were fixed on the limp form of
the man in rubber boots. A hundred hands reached down to help lift
the body up. On the dock some men grabbed it and began to beat it
and roll it. A policeman tossed the spectators about. Each
individual in the heaving crowd sought to fasten his eyes on the
blue-tinted face of the man in the rubber boots. They surged to and
fro, while the policeman beat them indiscriminately.</p>

<p>The wanderers came modestly up the dock and gazed shrinkingly at
the throng. They stood for a moment, holding their breath to see
the first finger of amazement levelled at them.</p>

<p>But the crowd bended and surged in absorbing anxiety to view the
man in rubber boots, whose face fascinated them. The sea-wanderers
were as though they were not there.</p>

<p>They stood without the jam and whispered hurriedly.</p>

<p>"839," said the freckled man.</p>

<p>"All right," said the tall man.</p>

<p>Under the pommeling hands the oarsman showed signs of life. The
voyagers watched him make a protesting kick at the leg of the
crowd, the while uttering angry groans.</p>

<p>"He's better," said the tall man, softly; "let's make off."</p>

<p>Together they stole noiselessly up the dock. Directly in front
of it they found a row of six cabs.</p>

<p>The drivers on top were filled with a mighty curiosity. They had
driven hurriedly from the adjacent ferry-house when they had seen
the first running sign of an accident. They were straining on their
toes and gazing at the tossing backs of the men in the crowd.</p>

<p>The wanderers made a little detour, and then went rapidly
towards a cab. They stopped in front of it and looked up.</p>

<p>"Driver," called the tall man, softly.</p>

<p>The man was intent.</p>

<p>"Driver," breathed the freckled man. They stood for a moment and
gazed imploringly.</p>

<p>The cabman suddenly moved his feet. "By Jimmy, I bet he's a
gonner," he said, in an ecstacy, and he again relapsed into a
statue.</p>

<p>The freckled man groaned and wrung his hands. The tall man
climbed into the cab.</p>

<p>"Come in here," he said to his companion. The freckled man
climbed in, and the tall man reached over and pulled the door shut.
Then he put his head out the window.</p>

<p>"Driver," he roared, sternly, "839 Park Place&mdash;and
quick."</p>

<p>The driver looked down and met the eye of the tall man.
"Eh?&mdash;Oh&mdash;839? Park Place? Yessir." He reluctantly gave
his horse a clump on the back. As the conveyance rattled off the
wanderers huddled back among the dingy cushions and heaved great
breaths of relief.</p>

<p>"Well, it's all over," said the freckled man, finally. "We're
about out of it. And quicker than I expected. Much quicker. It
looked to me sometimes that we were doomed. I am thankful to find
it not so. I am rejoiced. And I hope and trust that you&mdash;well,
I don't wish, to&mdash;perhaps it is not the proper time
to&mdash;that is, I don't wish to intrude a moral at an inopportune
moment, but, my dear, dear fellow, I think the time is ripe to
point out to you that your obstinacy, your selfishness, your
villainous temper, and your various other faults can make it just
as unpleasant for your ownself, my dear boy, as they frequently do
for other people. You can see what you brought us to, and I most
sincerely hope, my dear, dear fellow, that I shall soon see those
signs in you which shall lead me to believe that you have become a
wiser man."</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>SPITZBERGEN TALES</h2>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch2-1" id="ch2-1"></a>The Kicking Twelfth</h3>

<p>The Spitzbergen army was backed by tradition of centuries of
victory. In its chronicles, occasional defeats were not printed in
italics, but were likely to appear as glorious stands against
overwhelming odds. A favourite way to dispose of them was frankly
to attribute them to the blunders of the civilian heads of
government. This was very good for the army, and probably no army
had more self-confidence. When it was announced that an
expeditionary force was to be sent to Rostina to chastise an
impudent people, a hundred barrack squares filled with excited men,
and a hundred sergeant-majors hurried silently through the groups,
and succeeded in looking as if they were the repositories of the
secrets of empire. Officers on leave sped joyfully back to their
harness, and recruits were abused with unflagging devotion by every
man, from colonels to privates of experience.</p>

<p>The Twelfth Regiment of the Line&mdash;the Kicking
Twelfth&mdash;was consumed with a dread that it was not to be
included in the expedition, and the regiment formed itself into an
informal indignation meeting. Just as they had proved that a great
outrage was about to be perpetrated, warning orders arrived to hold
themselves in readiness for active service abroad&mdash;in Rostina.
The barrack yard was in a flash transferred into a blue-and-buff
pandemonium, and the official bugle itself hardly had power to
quell the glad disturbance.</p>

<p>Thus it was that early in the spring the Kicking
Twelfth&mdash;sixteen hundred men in service equipment&mdash;found
itself crawling along a road in Rostina. They did not form part of
the main force, but belonged to a column of four regiments of foot,
two batteries of field guns, a battery of mountain howitzers, a
regiment of horse, and a company of engineers. Nothing had
happened. The long column had crawled without amusement of any kind
through a broad green valley. Big white farm-houses dotted the
slopes; but there was no sign of man or beast, and no smoke from
the chimneys. The column was operating from its own base, and its
general was expected to form a junction with the main body at a
given point.</p>

<p>A squadron of the cavalry was fanned out ahead, scouting, and
day by day the trudging infantry watched the blue uniforms of the
horsemen as they came and went. Sometimes there would sound the
faint thuds of a few shots, but the cavalry was unable to find
anything to engage.</p>

<p>The Twelfth had no record of foreign service, and it could
hardly be said that it had served as a unit in the great civil war,
when His Majesty the King had whipped the Pretender. At that time
the regiment had suffered from two opinions, so that it was
impossible for either side to depend upon it. Many men had deserted
to the standard of the Pretender, and a number of officers had
drawn their swords for him. When the King, a thorough soldier,
looked at the remnant, he saw that they lacked the spirit to be of
great help to him in the tremendous battles which he was waging for
his throne. And so this emaciated Twelfth was sent off to a corner
of the kingdom to guard a dockyard, where some of the officers so
plainly expressed their disapproval of this policy that the
regiment received its steadfast name, the Kicking Twelfth.</p>

<p>At the time of which I am writing the Twelfth had a few veteran
officers and well-bitten sergeants; but the body of the regiment
was composed of men who had never heard a shot fired excepting on
the rifle-range. But it was an experience for which they longed,
and when the moment came for the corps' cry&mdash;"Kim up, the
Kickers"&mdash;there was not likely to be a man who would not go
tumbling after his leaders.</p>

<p>Young Timothy Lean was a second lieutenant in the first company
of the third battalion, and just at this time he was pattering
along at the flank of the men, keeping a fatherly lookout for boots
that hurt and packs that sagged. He was extremely bored. The mere
far-away sound of desultory shooting was not war as he had been led
to believe it.</p>

<p>It did not appear that behind that freckled face and under that
red hair there was a mind which dreamed of blood. He was not
extremely anxious to kill somebody, but he was very fond of
soldiering&mdash;it had been the career of his father and of his
grandfather&mdash;and he understood that the profession of arms
lost much of its point unless a man shot at people and had people
shoot at him. Strolling in the sun through a practically deserted
country might be a proper occupation for a divinity student on a
vacation, but the soul of Timothy Lean was in revolt at it. Some
times at night he would go morosely to the camp of the cavalry and
hear the infant subalterns laughingly exaggerate the comedy side of
the adventures which they had had out with small patrols far ahead.
Lean would sit and listen in glum silence to these tales, and
dislike the young officers&mdash;many of them old military school
friends&mdash;for having had experience in modern warfare.</p>

<p>"Anyhow," he said savagely, "presently you'll be getting into a
lot of trouble, and then the Foot will have to come along and pull
you out. We always do. That's history."</p>

<p>"Oh, we can take care of ourselves," said the Cavalry, with
good-natured understanding of his mood.</p>

<p>But the next day even Lean blessed the cavalry, for excited
troopers came whirling back from the front, bending over their
speeding horses, and shouting wildly and hoarsely for the infantry
to clear the way. Men yelled at them from the roadside as courier
followed courier, and from the distance ahead sounded in quick
succession six booms from field guns. The information possessed by
the couriers was no longer precious. Everybody knew what a battery
meant when it spoke. The bugles cried out, and the long column
jolted into a halt. Old Colonel Sponge went bouncing in his saddle
back to see the general, and the regiment sat down in the grass by
the roadside, and waited in silence. Presently the second squadron
of the cavalry trotted off along the road in a cloud of dust, and
in due time old Colonel Sponge came bouncing back, and palavered
his three majors and his adjutant. Then there was more talk by the
majors, and gradually through the correct channels spread
information which in due time reached Timothy Lean.</p>

<p>The enemy, 5000 strong, occupied a pass at the head of the
valley some four miles beyond. They had three batteries well
posted. Their infantry was entrenched. The ground in their front
was crossed and lined with many ditches and hedges; but the enemy's
batteries were so posted that it was doubtful if a ditch would ever
prove convenient as shelter for the Spitzbergen infantry.</p>

<p>There was a fair position for the Spitzbergen artillery 2300
yards from the enemy. The cavalry had succeeded in driving the
enemy's skirmishers back upon the main body; but, of course, had
only tried to worry them a little. The position was almost
inaccessible on the enemy's right, owing to steep hills, which had
been crowned by small parties of infantry. The enemy's left,
although guarded by a much larger force, was approachable, and
might be flanked. This was what the cavalry had to say, and it
added briefly a report of two troopers killed and five wounded.</p>

<p>Whereupon Major-General Richie, commanding a force of 7500 men
of His Majesty of Spitzbergen, set in motion, with a few simple
words, the machinery which would launch his army at the enemy. The
Twelfth understood the orders when they saw the smart young aide
approaching old Colonel Sponge, and they rose as one man,
apparently afraid that they would be late. There was a clank of
accoutrements. Men shrugged their shoulders tighter against their
packs, and thrusting their thumbs between their belts and their
tunics, they wriggled into a closer fit with regard to the heavy
ammunition equipment. It is curious to note that almost every man
took off his cap, and looked contemplatively into it as if to read
a maker's name. Then they replaced their caps with great care.
There was little talking, and it was not observable that a single
soldier handed a token or left a comrade with a message to be
delivered in case he should be killed. They did not seem to think
of being killed; they seemed absorbed in a desire to know what
would happen, and how it would look when it was happening. Men
glanced continually at their officers in a plain desire to be quick
to understand the very first order that would be given; and
officers looked gravely at their men, measuring them, feeling their
temper, worrying about them.</p>

<p>A bugle called; there were sharp cries, and the Kicking Twelfth
was off to battle.</p>

<p>The regiment had the right of line in the infantry brigade, and
the men tramped noisily along the white road, every eye was
strained ahead; but, after all, there was nothing to be seen but a
dozen farms&mdash;in short, a country-side. It resembled the
scenery in Spitzbergen; every man in the Kicking Twelfth had often
confronted a dozen such farms with a composure which amounted to
indifference. But still down the road came galloping troopers, who
delivered information to Colonel Sponge and then galloped on. In
time the Twelfth came to the top of a rise, and below them on the
plain was the heavy black streak of a Spitzbergen squadron, and
behind the squadron loomed the grey bare hill of the Rostina
position.</p>

<p>There was a little of skirmish firing. The Twelfth reached a
knoll, which the officers easily recognised as the place described
by the cavalry as suitable for the Spitzbergen guns. The men
swarmed up it in a peculiar formation. They resembled a crowd
coming off a race track; but, nevertheless, there was no stray
sheep. It was simply that the ground on which actual battles are
fought is not like a chess board. And after them came swinging a
six-gun battery, the guns wagging from side to side as the long
line turned out of the road, and the drivers using their whips as
the leading horses scrambled at the hill. The halted Twelfth lifted
its voice and spoke amiably, but with point, to the battery.</p>

<p>"Go on, Guns! We'll take care of you. Don't be afraid. Give it
to them!" The teams&mdash;lead, swing and wheel&mdash;struggled and
slipped over the steep and uneven ground; and the gunners, as they
clung to their springless positions, wore their usual and natural
airs of unhappiness. They made no reply to the infantry. Once upon
the top of the hill, however, these guns were unlimbered in a
flash, and directly the infantry could hear the loud voice of an
officer drawling out the time for fuses. A moment later the first
32 bellowed out, and there could be heard the swish and the snarl
of a fleeting shell.</p>

<p>Colonel Sponge and a number of officers climbed to the battery's
position; but the men of the regiment sat in the shelter of the
hill, like so many blindfolded people, and wondered what they would
have been able to see if they had been officers. Sometimes the
shells of the enemy came sweeping over the top of the hill, and
burst in great brown explosions in the fields to the rear. The men
looked after them and laughed. To the rear could be seen also the
mountain battery coming at a comic trot, with every man obviously
in a deep rage with every mule. If a man can put in long service
with a mule battery and come out of it with an amiable disposition,
he should be presented with a medal weighing many ounces. After the
mule battery came a long black winding thing, which was three
regiments of Spitzbergen infantry; and at the backs of them and to
the right was an inky square, which was the remaining Spitzbergen
guns. General Richie and his staff clattered up the hill. The
blindfolded Twelfth sat still. The inky square suddenly became a
long racing line. The howitzers joined their little bark to the
thunder of the guns on the hill, and the three regiments of
infantry came on. The Twelfth sat still.</p>

<p>Of a sudden a bugle rang its warning, and the officers shouted.
Some used the old cry, "Attention! Kim up, the Kickers!"&mdash;and
the Twelfth knew that it had been told to go on. The majority of
the men expected to see great things as soon as they rounded the
shoulder of the hill; but there was nothing to be seen save a
complicated plain and the grey knolls occupied by the enemy. Many
company commanders in low voices worked at their men, and said
things which do not appear in the written reports. They talked
soothingly; they talked indignantly; and they talked always like
fathers. And the men heard no sentences completely; they heard no
specific direction, these wide-eyed men. They understood that there
was being delivered some kind of exhortation to do as they had been
taught, and they also understood that a superior intelligence was
anxious over their behaviour and welfare.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of floundering through hedges, climbing
of walls and jumping of ditches. Curiously original privates tried
to find new and easier ways for themselves, instead of following
the men in front of them. Officers had short fits of fury over
these people. The more originality they possessed, the more likely
they were to become separated from their companies. Colonel Sponge
was making an exciting progress on a big charger. When the first
song of the bullets came from above, the men wondered why he sat so
high; the charger seemed as tall as the Eiffel Tower. But if he was
high in the air, he had a fine view, and that supposedly is why
people ascend the Eiffel Tower. Very often he had been a joke to
them, but when they saw this fat, old gentleman so coolly treating
the strange new missiles which hummed in the air, it struck them
suddenly that they had wronged him seriously; and a man who could
attain the command of a Spitzbergen regiment was entitled to
general respect. And they gave him a sudden, quick
affection&mdash;an affection that would make them follow him
heartily, trustfully, grandly&mdash;this fat, old gentleman, seated
on a too-big horse. In a flash his tousled grey head, his short,
thick legs, even his paunch, had become specially and humorously
endeared to them. And this is the way of soldiers.</p>

<p>But still the Twelfth had not yet come to the place where
tumbling bodies begin their test of the very heart of a regiment.
They backed through more hedges, jumped more ditches, slid over
more walls. The Rostina artillery had seemed to be asleep; but
suddenly the guns aroused like dogs from their kennels, and around
the Twelfth there began a wild, swift screeching. There arose cries
to hurry, to come on; and, as the rifle bullets began to plunge
into them, the men saw the high, formidable hills of the enemy's
right, and perfectly understood that they were doomed to storm
them. The cheering thing was the sudden beginning of a tremendous
uproar on the enemy's left.</p>

<p>Every man ran, hard, tense, breathless. When they reached the
foot of the hills, they thought they had won the charge already,
but they were electrified to see officers above them waving their
swords and yelling with anger, surprise, and shame. With a long
murmurous outcry the Twelfth began to climb the hill; and as they
went and fell, they could hear frenzied shouts&mdash;"Kim up, the
Kickers!" The pace was slow. It was like the rising of a tide; it
was determined, almost relentless in its appearance, but it was
slow. If a man fell there was a chance that he would land twenty
yards below the point where he was hit. The Kickers crawled, their
rifles in their left hands as they pulled and tugged themselves up
with their right hands. Ever arose the shout, "Kim up, the
Kickers!" Timothy Lean, his face flaming, his eyes wild, yelled it
back as if he were delivering the gospel.</p>

<p>The Kickers came up. The enemy&mdash;they had been in small
force, thinking the hills safe enough from attack&mdash;retreated
quickly from this preposterous advance, and not a bayonet in the
Twelfth saw blood; bayonets very seldom do.</p>

<p>The homing of this successful charge wore an unromantic aspect.
About twenty windless men suddenly arrived, and threw themselves
upon the crest of the hill, and breathed. And these twenty were
joined by others, and still others, until almost 1100 men of the
Twelfth lay upon the hilltop, while the regiment's track was marked
by body after body, in groups and singly. The first
officer&mdash;perchance the first man, one never can be
certain&mdash;the first officer to gain the top of the hill was
Timothy Lean, and such was the situation that he had the honour to
receive his colonel with a bashful salute.</p>

<p>The regiment knew exactly what it had done; it did not have to
wait to be told by the Spitzbergen newspapers. It had taken a
formidable position with the loss of about five hundred men, and it
knew it. It knew, too, that it was great glory for the Kicking
Twelfth; and as the men lay rolling on their bellies, they
expressed their joy in a wild cry&mdash;"Kim up, the Kickers!" For
a moment there was nothing but joy, and then suddenly company
commanders were besieged by men who wished to go down the path of
the charge and look for their mates. The answers were without the
quality of mercy; they were short, snapped, quick words, "No; you
can't."</p>

<p>The attack on the enemy's left was sounding in great rolling
crashes. The shells in their flight through the air made a noise as
of red-hot iron plunged into water, and stray bullets nipped near
the ears of the Kickers.</p>

<p>The Kickers looked and saw. The battle was below them. The enemy
were indicated by a long, noisy line of gossamer smoke, although
there could be seen a toy battery with tiny men employed at the
guns. All over the field the shrapnel was bursting, making quick
bulbs of white smoke. Far away, two regiments of Spitzbergen
infantry were charging, and at the distance this charge looked like
a casual stroll. It appeared that small black groups of men were
walking meditatively toward the Rostina entrenchments.</p>

<p>There would have been orders given sooner to the Twelfth, but
unfortunately Colonel Sponge arrived on top of the hill without a
breath of wind in his body. He could not have given an order to
save the regiment from being wiped off the earth. Finally he was
able to gasp out something and point at the enemy. Timothy Lean ran
along the line yelling to the men to sight at 800 yards; and like a
slow and ponderous machine the regiment again went to work. The
fire flanked a great part of the enemy's trenches.</p>

<p>It could be said that there were only two prominent points of
view expressed by the men after their victorious arrival on the
crest. One was defined in the exulting use of the corps' cry. The
other was a grief-stricken murmur which is invariably heard after a
fight&mdash;"My God, we're all cut to pieces!"</p>

<p>Colonel Sponge sat on the ground and impatiently waited for his
wind to return. As soon as it did, he arose and cried out, "Form
up, and we'll charge again! We will win this battle as soon as we
can hit them!" The shouts of the officers sounded wild, like men
yelling on ship-board in a gale. And the obedient Kickers arose for
their task. It was running down hill this time. The mob of panting
men poured over the stones.</p>

<p>But the enemy had not been blind to the great advantage gained
by the Twelfth, and they now turned upon them a desperate fire of
small arms. Men fell in every imaginable way, and their
accoutrements rattled on the rocky ground. Some landed with a
crash, floored by some tremendous blows; others dropped gently down
like sacks of meal; with others, it would positively appear that
some spirit had suddenly seized them by their ankles and jerked
their legs from under them. Many officers were down, but Colonel
Sponge, stuttering and blowing, was still upright. He was almost
the last man in the charge, but not to his shame, rather to his
stumpy legs. At one time it seemed that the assault would be lost.
The effect of the fire was somewhat as if a terrible cyclone were
blowing in the men's faces. They wavered, lowering their heads and
shouldering weakly, as if it were impossible to make headway
against the wind of battle. It was the moment of despair, the
moment of the heroism which comes to the chosen of the war-god.</p>

<p>The colonel's cry broke and screeched absolute hatred; other
officers simply howled; and the men, silent, debased, seemed to
tighten their muscles for one last effort. Again they pushed
against this mysterious power of the air, and once more the
regiment was charging. Timothy Lean, agile and strong, was well in
advance; and afterwards he reflected that the men who had been
nearest to him were an old grizzled sergeant who would have gone to
hell for the honour of the regiment, and a pie-faced lad who had
been obliged to lie about his age in order to get into the
army.</p>

<p>There was no shock of meeting. The Twelfth came down on a corner
of the trenches, and as soon as the enemy had ascertained that the
Twelfth was certain to arrive, they scuttled out, running close to
the earth and spending no time in glances backward. In these days
it is not discreet to wait for a charge to come home. You observe
the charge, you attempt to stop it, and if you find that you can't,
it is better to retire immediately to some other place. The Rostina
soldiers were not heroes, perhaps, but they were men of sense. A
maddened and badly-frightened mob of Kickers came tumbling into the
trench, and shot at the backs of fleeing men. And at that very
moment the action was won, and won by the Kickers. The enemy's
flank was entirely crippled, and, knowing this, he did not await
further and more disastrous information. The Twelfth looked at
themselves and knew that they had a record. They sat down and
grinned patronisingly as they saw the batteries galloping to
advance position to shell the retreat, and they really laughed as
the cavalry swept tumultuously forward.</p>

<p>The Twelfth had no more concern with the battle. They had won
it, and the subsequent proceedings were only amusing.</p>

<p>There was a call from the flank, and the men wearily adjusted
themselves as General Richie, stern and grim as a Roman, looked
with his straight glance at a hammered and thin and dirty line of
figures, which was His Majesty's Twelfth Regiment of the Line. When
opposite old Colonel Sponge, a podgy figure standing at attention,
the general's face set in still more grim and stern lines. He took
off his helmet. "Kim up, the Kickers!" said he. He replaced his
helmet and rode off. Down the cheeks of the little fat colonel
rolled tears. He stood like a stone for a long moment, and wheeled
in supreme wrath upon his surprised adjutant. "Delahaye, you
d&mdash;d fool, don't stand there staring like a monkey! Go, tell
young Lean I want to see him." The adjutant jumped as if he were on
springs, and went after Lean. That young officer presented himself
directly, his face covered with disgraceful smudges, and he had
also torn his breeches. He had never seen the colonel in such a
rage. "Lean, you young whelp! you&mdash;you're a good boy." And
even as the general had turned away from the colonel, the colonel
turned away from the lieutenant.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch2-2" id="ch2-2"></a>The Upturned Face</h3>

<p>"What will we do now?" said the adjutant, troubled and
excited.</p>

<p>"Bury him," said Timothy Lean.</p>

<p>The two officers looked down close to their toes where lay the
body of their comrade. The face was chalk-blue; gleaming eyes
stared at the sky. Over the two upright figures was a windy sound
of bullets, and on the top of the hill Lean's prostrate company of
Spitzbergen infantry was firing measured volleys.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it would be better&mdash;" began the adjutant,
"we might leave him until to-morrow."</p>

<p>"No," said Lean. "I can't hold that post an hour longer. I've
got to fall back, and we've got to bury old Bill."</p>

<p>"Of course," said the adjutant, at once. "Your men got
intrenching tools?"</p>

<p>Lean shouted back to his little line, and two men came slowly,
one with a pick, one with a shovel. They started in the direction
of the Rostina sharpshooters. Bullets cracked near their ears. "Dig
here," said Lean gruffly. The men, thus caused to lower their
glances to the turf, became hurried and frightened merely because
they could not look to see whence the bullets came. The dull beat
of the pick striking the earth sounded amid the swift snap of close
bullets. Presently the other private began to shovel.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said the adjutant, slowly, "we'd better search his
clothes for&mdash;things."</p>

<p>Lean nodded. Together in curious abstraction they looked at the
body. Then Lean stirred his shoulders suddenly, arousing
himself.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "we'd better see what he's got." He dropped to
his knees, and his hands approached the body of the dead officer.
But his hands wavered over the buttons of the tunic. The first
button was brick-red with drying blood, and he did not seem to dare
touch it.</p>

<p>"Go on," said the adjutant, hoarsely.</p>

<p>Lean stretched his wooden hand, and his fingers fumbled the
blood-stained buttons. At last he rose with ghastly face. He had
gathered a watch, a whistle, a pipe, a tobacco pouch, a
handkerchief, a little case of cards and papers. He looked at the
adjutant. There was a silence. The adjutant was feeling that he had
been a coward to make Lean do all the grizzly business.</p>

<p>"Well," said Lean, "that's all, I think. You have his sword and
revolver?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the adjutant, his face working, and then he burst
out in a sudden strange fury at the two privates. "Why don't you
hurry up with that grave? What are you doing, anyhow? Hurry, do you
hear? I never saw such stupid&mdash;"</p>

<p>Even as he cried out in his passion the two men were labouring
for their lives. Ever overhead the bullets were spitting.</p>

<p>The grave was finished. It was not a masterpiece&mdash;a poor
little shallow thing. Lean and the adjutant again looked at each
other in a curious silent communication.</p>

<p>Suddenly the adjutant croaked out a weird laugh. It was a
terrible laugh, which had its origin in that part of the mind which
is first moved by the singing of the nerves. "Well," he said,
humorously to Lean, "I suppose we had best tumble him in."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lean. The two privates stood waiting, bent over
their implements. "I suppose," said Lean, "it would be better if we
laid him in ourselves."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the adjutant. Then apparently remembering that he
had made Lean search the body, he stooped with great fortitude and
took hold of the dead officer's clothing. Lean joined him. Both
were particular that their fingers should not feel the corpse. They
tugged away; the corpse lifted, heaved, toppled, flopped into the
grave, and the two officers, straightening, looked again at each
other&mdash;they were always looking at each other. They sighed
with relief.</p>

<p>The adjutant said, "I suppose we should&mdash;we should say
something. Do you know the service, Tim?"</p>

<p>"They don't read the service until the grave is filled in," said
Lean, pressing his lips to an academic expression.</p>

<p>"Don't they?" said the adjutant, shocked that he had made the
mistake.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," he cried, suddenly, "let us&mdash;let us say
something&mdash;while he can hear us."</p>

<p>"All right," said Lean. "Do you know the service?"</p>

<p>"I can't remember a line of it," said the adjutant.</p>

<p>Lean was extremely dubious. "I can repeat two lines,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, do it," said the adjutant. "Go as far as you can. That's
better than nothing. And the beasts have got our range
exactly."</p>

<p>Lean looked at his two men. "Attention," he barked. The privates
came to attention with a click, looking much aggrieved. The
adjutant lowered his helmet to his knee. Lean, bareheaded, stood
over the grave. The Rostina sharpshooters fired briskly.</p>

<p>"Oh Father, our friend has sunk in the deep waters of death, but
his spirit has leaped toward Thee as the bubble arises from the
lips of the drowning. Perceive, we beseech, Oh Father, the little
flying bubble, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lean, although husky and ashamed, had suffered no hesitation up
to this point, but he stopped with a hopeless feeling and looked at
the corpse.</p>

<p>The adjutant moved uneasily. "And from Thy superb
heights&mdash;" he began, and then he too came to an end.</p>

<p>"And from Thy superb heights," said Lean.</p>

<p>The adjutant suddenly remembered a phrase in the back part of
the Spitzbergen burial service, and he exploited it with the
triumphant manner of a man who has recalled everything, and can go
on.</p>

<p>"Oh God, have mercy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh God, have mercy&mdash;" said Lean.</p>

<p>"Mercy," repeated the adjutant, in quick failure.</p>

<p>"Mercy," said Lean. And then he was moved by some violence of
feeling, for he turned suddenly upon his two men and tigerishly
said, "Throw the dirt in."</p>

<p>The fire of the Rostina sharpshooters was accurate and
continuous.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>* * *</b>
</p>

<p>One of the aggrieved privates came forward with his shovel. He
lifted his first shovel-load of earth, and for a moment of
inexplicable hesitation it was held poised above this corpse, which
from its chalk-blue face looked keenly out from the grave. Then the
soldier emptied his shovel on&mdash;on the feet.</p>

<p>Timothy Lean felt as if tons had been swiftly lifted from off
his forehead. He had felt that perhaps the private might empty the
shovel on&mdash;on the face. It had been emptied on the feet. There
was a great point gained there&mdash;ha, ha!&mdash;the first
shovelful had been emptied on the feet. How satisfactory!</p>

<p>The adjutant began to babble. "Well, of course&mdash;a man we've
messed with all these years&mdash;impossible&mdash;you can't, you
know, leave your intimate friends rotting on the field. Go on, for
God's sake, and shovel, you."</p>

<p>The man with the shovel suddenly ducked, grabbed his left arm
with his right hand, and looked at his officer for orders. Lean
picked the shovel from the ground. "Go to the rear," he said to the
wounded man. He also addressed the other private. "You get under
cover, too; I'll finish this business."</p>

<p>The wounded man scrambled hard still for the top of the ridge
without devoting any glances to the direction from whence the
bullets came, and the other man followed at an equal pace; but he
was different, in that he looked back anxiously three times.</p>

<p>This is merely the way&mdash;often&mdash;of the hit and
unhit.</p>

<p>Timothy Lean filled the shovel, hesitated, and then in a
movement which was like a gesture of abhorrence he flung the dirt
into the grave, and as it landed it made a sound&mdash;plop. Lean
suddenly stopped and mopped his brow&mdash;a tired labourer.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we have been wrong," said the adjutant. His glance
wavered stupidly. "It might have been better if we hadn't buried
him just at this time. Of course, if we advance to-morrow the body
would have been&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Damn you," said Lean, "shut your mouth." He was not the senior
officer.</p>

<p>He again filled the shovel and flung the earth. Always the earth
made that sound&mdash;plop. For a space Lean worked frantically,
like a man digging himself out of danger.</p>

<p>Soon there was nothing to be seen but the chalk-blue face. Lean
filled the shovel. "Good God," he cried to the adjutant. "Why
didn't you turn him somehow when you put him in? This&mdash;" Then
Lean began to stutter.</p>

<p>The adjutant understood. He was pale to the lips. "Go on, man,"
he cried, beseechingly, almost in a shout. Lean swung back the
shovel. It went forward in a pendulum curve. When the earth landed
it made a sound&mdash;plop.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch2-3" id="ch2-3"></a>The Shrapnel of Their
Friends</h3>

<p>From over the knolls came the tiny sound of a cavalry bugle
singing out the recall, and later, detached parties of His
Majesty's 2nd Hussars came trotting back to where the Spitzbergen
infantry sat complacently on the captured Rostina position. The
horsemen were well pleased, and they told how they had ridden
thrice through the helterskelter of the fleeing enemy. They had
ultimately been checked by the great truth, and when a good enemy
runs away in daylight he sooner or later finds a place where he
fetches up with a jolt, and turns face the pursuit&mdash;notably if
it is a cavalry pursuit. The Hussars had discreetly withdrawn,
displaying no foolish pride of corps at that time.</p>

<p>There was a general admission that the Kicking Twelfth had taken
the chief honours of the day, but the artillery added that if the
guns had not shelled so accurately the Twelfth's charge could not
have been made so successfully, and the three other regiments of
infantry, of course, did not conceal their feelings, that their
attack on the enemy's left had withdrawn many rifles that would
have been pelting at the Twelfth. The cavalry simply said that but
for them the victory would not have been complete.</p>

<p>Corps' prides met each other face to face at every step, but the
Kickers smiled easily and indulgently. A few recruits bragged, but
they bragged because they were recruits. The older men did not wish
it to appear that they were surprised and rejoicing at the
performance of the regiment. If they were congratulated they simply
smirked, suggesting that the ability of the Twelfth had been long
known to them, and that the charge had been a little thing, you
know, just turned off in the way of an afternoon's work.</p>

<p>Major-General Richie encamped his troops on the position which
they had from the enemy. Old Colonel Sponge of the Twelfth
redistributed his officers, and the losses had been so great that
Timothy Lean got command of a company. It was not much of a
company. Fifty-three smudged and sweating men faced their new
commander. The company had gone into action with a strength of
eighty-six. The heart of Timothy Lean beat high with pride. He
intended to be some day a general, and if he ever became a general,
that moment of promotion was not equal in joy to the moment when he
looked at his new possession of fifty-three vagabonds. He scanned
the faces, and recognised with satisfaction one old sergeant and
two bright young corporals. "Now," said he to himself, "I have here
a snug little body of men with which I can do something." In him
burned the usual fierce fire to make them the best company in the
regiment. He had adopted them; they were his men. "I will do what I
can for you," he said. "Do you the same for me."</p>

<p>The Twelfth bivouacked on the ridge. Little fires were built,
and there appeared among the men innumerable blackened tin cups,
which were so treasured that a faint suspicion in connection with
the loss of one could bring on the grimmest of fights. Meantime
certain of the privates silently readjusted their kits as their
names were called out by the sergeants. These were the men
condemned to picket duty after a hard day of marching and fighting.
The dusk came slowly, and the colour of the countless fires,
spotting the ridge and the plain, grew in the falling darkness.
Far-away pickets fired at something.</p>

<p>One by one the men's heads were lowered to the earth until the
ridge was marked by two long shadowy rows of men. Here and there an
officer sat musing in his dark cloak with a ray of a weakening fire
gleaming on his sword-hilt. From the plain there came at times the
sound of battery horses moving restlessly at their tethers, and one
could imagine he heard the throaty, grumbling curse of the drivers.
The moon died swiftly through flying light clouds. Far-away pickets
fired at something.</p>

<p>In the morning the infantry and guns breakfasted to the music of
a racket between the cavalry and the enemy, which was taking place
some miles up the valley.</p>

<p>The ambitious Hussars had apparently stirred some kind of a
hornet's nest, and they were having a good fight with no officious
friends near enough to interfere. The remainder of the army looked
toward the fight musingly over the tops of tin cups. In time the
column crawled lazily forward to see.</p>

<p>The Twelfth, as it crawled, saw a regiment deploy to the right,
and saw a battery dash to take position. The cavalry jingled back
grinning with pride and expecting to be greatly admired. Presently
the Twelfth was bidden to take seat by the roadside and await its
turn. Instantly the wise men&mdash;and there were more than
three&mdash;came out of the east and announced that they had
divined the whole plan. The Kicking Twelfth was to be held in
reserve until the critical moment of the fight, and then they were
to be sent forward to win a victory. In corroboration, they pointed
to the fact that the general in command was sticking close to them,
in order, they said, to give the word quickly at the proper moment.
And in truth, on a small hill to the right, Major-General Richie
sat on his horse and used his glasses, while back of him his staff
and the orderlies bestrode their champing, dancing mounts.</p>

<p>It is always good to look hard at a general, and the Kickers
were transfixed with interest. The wise men again came out of the
east and told what was inside the Richie head, but even the wise
men wondered what was inside the Richie head.</p>

<p>Suddenly an exciting thing happened. To the left and ahead was a
pounding Spitzbergen battery, and a toy suddenly appeared on the
slope behind the guns. The toy was a man with a flag&mdash;the flag
was white save for a square of red in the centre. And this toy
began to wig-wag wag-wig, and it spoke to General Richie under the
authority of the captain of the battery. It said: "The 88th are
being driven on my centre and right."</p>

<p>Now, when the Kicking Twelfth had left Spitzbergen there was an
average of six signalmen in each company. A proportion of these
signallers had been destroyed in the first engagement, but enough
remained so that the Kicking Twelfth read, as a unit, the news of
the 88th. The word ran quickly. "The 88th are being driven on my
centre and right."</p>

<p>Richie rode to where Colonel Sponge sat aloft on his big horse,
and a moment later a cry ran along the column: "Kim up, the
Kickers." A large number of the men were already in the road,
hitching and twisting at their belts and packs. The Kickers moved
forward.</p>

<p>They deployed and passed in a straggling line through the
battery, and to the left and right of it. The gunners called out to
them carefully, telling them not to be afraid.</p>

<p>The scene before them was startling. They were facing a country
cut up by many steep-sided ravines, and over the resultant hills
were retreating little squads of the 88th. The Twelfth laughed in
its exultation. The men could now tell by the volume of fire that
the 88th were retreating for reasons which were not sufficiently
expressed in the noise of the Rostina shooting. Held together by
the bugle, the Kickers swarmed up the first hill and laid on the
crest. Parties of the 88th went through their lines, and the
Twelfth told them coarsely its several opinions. The sights were
clicked up to 600 yards, and, with a crashing volley, the regiment
entered its second battle.</p>

<p>A thousand yards away on the right the cavalry and a regiment of
infantry were creeping onward. Sponge decided not to be backward,
and the bugle told the Twelfth to go ahead once more. The Twelfth
charged, followed by a rabble of rallied men of the 88th, who were
crying aloud that it had been all a mistake.</p>

<p>A charge in these days is not a running match. Those splendid
pictures of levelled bayonets, dashing at headlong pace towards the
closed ranks of the enemy are absurd as soon as they are mistaken
for the actuality of the present. In these days charges are likely
to cover at least the half of a mile, and to go at the pace
exhibited in the pictures a man would be obliged to have a little
steam engine inside of him.</p>

<p>The charge of the Kicking Twelfth somewhat resembled the advance
of a great crowd of beaters who, for some reason, passionately
desired to start the game. Men stumbled; men fell; men swore; there
were cries: "This way!" "Come this way!" "Don't go that way!" "You
can't get up that way!" Over the rocks the Twelfth scrambled, red
in the face, sweating and angry. Soldiers fell because they were
struck by bullets, and because they had not an ounce of strength
left in them. Colonel Sponge, with a face like a red cushion, was
being dragged windless up the steeps by devoted and athletic men.
Three of the older captains lay afar back, and swearing with their
eyes because their tongues were temporarily out of service.</p>

<p>And yet-and-yet, the speed of the charge was slow. From the
position of the battery, it looked as if the Kickers were taking a
walk over some extremely difficult country.</p>

<p>The regiment ascended a superior height, and found trenches and
dead men. They took seat with the dead, satisfied with this company
until they could get their wind. For thirty minutes purple-faced
stragglers rejoined from the rear. Colonel Sponge looked behind
him, and saw that Richie, with his staff, had approached by another
route, and had evidently been near enough to see the full extent of
the Kickers' exertions. Presently Richie began to pick a way for
his horse towards the captured position. He disappeared in a gully
between two hills.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass that a Spitzbergen battery on the far right
took occasion to mistake the identity of the Kicking Twelfth, and
the captain of these guns, not having anything to occupy him in
front, directed his six 32's upon the ridge where the tired
Kickers lay side by side with the Rostina dead. A shrapnel came
swinging over the Kickers, seething and fuming. It burst directly
over the trenches, and the shrapnel, of course, scattered forward,
hurting nobody. But a man screamed out to his officer: "By God,
sir, that is one of our own batteries!" The whole line quivered
with fright. Five more shells streaked overhead, and one flung its
hail into the middle of the 3rd battalion's line, and the Kicking
Twelfth shuddered to the very centre of its heart, and arose, like
one man, and fled.</p>

<p>Colonel Sponge, fighting, frothing at the month, dealing blows
with his fist right and left, found himself confronting a fury on
horseback. Richie was as pale as death, and his eyes sent out
sparks. "What does this conduct mean?" he flashed out between his
fastened teeth.</p>

<p>Sponge could only gurgle: "The battery&mdash;the
battery&mdash;the battery!"</p>

<p>"The battery?" cried Richie, in a voice which sounded like
pistol shots. "Are you afraid of the guns you almost took
yesterday? Go back there, you white-livered cowards! You swine! You
dogs! Curs! Curs! Curs! Go back there!"</p>

<p>Most of the men halted and crouched under the lashing tongue of
their maddened general. But one man found desperate speech, and
yelled: "General, it is our own battery that is firing on us!"</p>

<p>Many say that the General's face tightened until it looked like
a mask. The Kicking Twelfth retired to a comfortable place, where
they were only under the fire of the Rostina artillery. The men saw
a staff officer riding over the obstructions in a manner calculated
to break his neck directly.</p>

<p>The Kickers were aggrieved, but the heart of the colonel was cut
in twain. He even babbled to his major, talking like a man who is
about to die of simple rage. "Did you hear what he said to me? Did
you hear what he called us? <i>Did you hear what he called
us?</i>"</p>

<p>The majors searched their minds for words to heal a deep
wound.</p>

<p>The Twelfth received orders to go into camp upon the hill where
they had been insulted. Old Sponge looked as if he were about to
knock the aide out of the saddle, but he saluted, and took the
regiment back to the temporary companionship of the Rostina
dead.</p>

<p>Major-General Richie never apologised to Colonel Sponge. When
you are a commanding officer you do not adopt the custom of
apologising for the wrong done to your subordinates. You ride away;
and they understand, and are confident of the restitution to
honour. Richie never opened his stern, young lips to Sponge in
reference to the scene near the hill of the Rostina dead, but in
time there was a general order No. 20, which spoke definitely of
the gallantry of His Majesty's 12th regiment of the line and its
colonel. In the end Sponge was given a high decoration, because he
had been badly used by Richie on that day. Richie knew that it is
hard for men to withstand the shrapnel of their friends.</p>

<p>A few days later the Kickers, marching in column on the road,
came upon their friend the battery, halted in a field; and they
addressed the battery, and the captain of the battery blanched to
the tips of his ears. But the men of the battery told the Kickers
to go to the devil&mdash;frankly, freely, placidly, told the
Kickers to go to the devil.</p>

<p>And this story proves that it is sometimes better to be a
private.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch2-4" id="ch2-4"></a>"And If He Wills, We Must
Die"</h3>

<p>A sergeant, a corporal, and fourteen men of the Twelfth Regiment
of the Line had been sent out to occupy a house on the main
highway. They would be at least a half of a mile in advance of any
other picket of their own people. Sergeant Morton was deeply angry
at being sent on this duty. He said that he was over-worked. There
were at least two sergeants, he claimed furiously, whose turn it
should have been to go on this arduous mission. He was treated
unfairly; he was abused by his superiors; why did any damned fool
ever join the army? As for him he would get out of it as soon as
possible; he was sick of it; the life of a dog. All this he said to
the corporal, who listened attentively, giving grunts of respectful
assent. On the way to this post two privates took occasion to drop
to the rear and pilfer in the orchard of a deserted plantation.
When the sergeant discovered this absence, he grew black with a
rage which was an accumulation of all his irritations. "Run, you!"
he howled. "Bring them here! I'll show them&mdash;" A private ran
swiftly to the rear. The remainder of the squad began to shout
nervously at the two delinquents, whose figures they could see in
the deep shade of the orchard, hurriedly picking fruit from the
ground and cramming it within their shirts, next to their skins.
The beseeching cries of their comrades stirred the criminals more
than did the barking of the sergeant. They ran to rejoin the squad,
while holding their loaded bosoms and with their mouths open with
aggrieved explanations.</p>

<p>Jones faced the sergeant with a horrible cancer marked in bumps
on his left side. The disease of Patterson showed quite around the
front of his waist in many protuberances. "A nice pair!" said the
sergeant, with sudden frigidity. "You're the kind of soldiers a man
wants to choose for a dangerous outpost duty, ain't you?"</p>

<p>The two privates stood at attention, still looking much
aggrieved. "We only&mdash;" began Jones huskily.</p>

<p>"Oh, you 'only!'" cried the sergeant. "Yes, you 'only.' I know
all about that. But if you think you are going to trifle with
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>A moment later the squad moved on towards its station. Behind
the sergeant's back Jones and Patterson were slyly passing apples
and pears to their friends while the sergeant expounded eloquently
to the corporal "You see what kind of men are in the army now. Why,
when I joined the regiment it was a very different thing, I can
tell you. Then a sergeant had some authority, and if a man
disobeyed orders, he had a very small chance of escaping something
extremely serious. But now! Good God! If I report these men, the
captain will look over a lot of beastly orderly sheets and
say&mdash;'Haw, eh, well, Sergeant Morton, these men seem to have
very good records; very good records, indeed. I can't be too hard
on them; no, not too hard.'" Continued the sergeant: "I tell you,
Flagler, the army is no place for a decent man."</p>

<p>Flagler, the corporal, answered with a sincerity of appreciation
which with him had become a science. "I think you are right,
sergeant," he answered.</p>

<p>Behind them the privates mumbled discreetly. "Damn this sergeant
of ours. He thinks we are made of wood. I don't see any reason for
all this strictness when we are on active service. It isn't like
being at home in barracks! There is no great harm in a couple of
men dropping out to raid an orchard of the enemy when all the world
knows that we haven't had a decent meal in twenty days."</p>

<p>The reddened face of Sergeant Morton suddenly showed to the
rear. "A little more marching and less talking," he said.</p>

<p>When he came to the house he had been ordered to occupy the
sergeant sniffed with disdain. "These people must have lived like
cattle," he said angrily. To be sure, the place was not alluring.
The ground floor had been used for the housing of cattle, and it
was dark and terrible. A flight of steps led to the lofty first
floor, which was denuded but respectable. The sergeant's visage
lightened when he saw the strong walls of stone and cement. "Unless
they turn guns on us, they will never get us out of here," he said
cheerfully to the squad. The men, anxious to keep him in an amiable
mood, all hurriedly grinned and seemed very appreciative and
pleased. "I'll make this into a fortress," he announced. He sent
Jones and Patterson, the two orchard thiefs, out on sentry-duty. He
worked the others, then, until he could think of no more things to
tell them to do. Afterwards he went forth, with a major-general's
serious scowl, and examined the ground in front of his position. In
returning he came upon a sentry, Jones, munching an apple. He
sternly commanded him to throw it away.</p>

<p>The men spread their blankets on the floors of the bare rooms,
and putting their packs under their heads and lighting their pipes,
they lived in easy peace. Bees hummed in the garden, and a scent of
flowers came through the open window. A great fan-shaped bit of
sunshine smote the face of one man, and he indolently cursed as he
moved his primitive bed to a shadier place.</p>

<p>Another private explained to a comrade: "This is all nonsense
anyhow. No sense in occupying this post. They&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, of course," said the corporal, "when she told me herself
that she cared more for me than she did for him, I wasn't going to
stand any of his talk&mdash;" The corporal's listener was so sleepy
that he could only grunt his sympathy.</p>

<p>There was a sudden little spatter of shooting. A cry from Jones
rang out. With no intermediate scrambling, the sergeant leaped
straight to his feet. "Now," he cried, "let us see what you are
made of! If," he added bitterly, "you are made of anything!"</p>

<p>A man yelled: "Good God, can't you see you're all tangled up in
my cartridge belt?"</p>

<p>Another man yelled: "Keep off my legs! Can't you walk on the
floor?"</p>

<p>To the windows there was a blind rush of slumberous men, who
brushed hair from their eyes even as they made ready their rifles.
Jones and Patterson came stumbling up the steps, crying dreadful
information. Already the enemy's bullets were spitting and singing
over the house.</p>

<p>The sergeant suddenly was stiff and cold with a sense of the
importance of the thing. "Wait until you see one," he drawled
loudly and calmly, "then shoot."</p>

<p>For some moments the enemy's bullets swung swifter than
lightning over the house without anybody being able to discover a
target. In this interval a man was shot in the throat. He gurgled,
and then lay down on the floor. The blood slowly waved down the
brown skin of his neck while he looked meekly at his comrades.</p>

<p>There was a howl. "There they are! There they come!" The rifles
crackled. A light smoke drifted idly through the rooms. There was a
strong odour as if from burnt paper and the powder of
fire-crackers. The men were silent. Through the windows and about
the house the bullets of an entirely invisible enemy moaned,
hummed, spat, burst, and sang.</p>

<p>The men began to curse. "Why can't we see them?" they muttered
through their teeth. The sergeant was still frigid. He answered
soothingly as if he were directly reprehensible for this behaviour
of the enemy. "Wait a moment. You will soon be able to see them.
There! Give it to them." A little skirt of black figures had
appeared in a field. It was really like shooting at an upright
needle from the full length of a ball-room. But the men's spirits
improved as soon as the enemy&mdash;this mysterious
enemy&mdash;became a tangible thing, and far off. They had believed
the foe to be shooting at them from the adjacent garden.</p>

<p>"Now," said the sergeant ambitiously, "we can beat them off
easily if you men are good enough."</p>

<p>A man called out in a tone of quick, great interest. "See that
fellow on horseback, Bill? Isn't he on horseback? I thought he was
on horseback."</p>

<p>There was a fusilade against another side of the house. The
sergeant dashed into the room which commanded that situation. He
found a dead soldier on the floor. He rushed out howling: "When was
Knowles killed? When was Knowles killed? Damn it, when was Knowles
killed?" It was absolutely essential to find out the exact moment
this man died. A blackened private turned upon his sergeant and
demanded: "How in hell do I know?" Sergeant Morton had a sense of
anger so brief that in the next second he cried: "Patterson!" He
had even forgotten his vital interest in the time of Knowles'
death.</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Patterson, his face set with some deep-rooted
quality of determination. Still, he was a mere farm boy.</p>

<p>"Go in to Knowles' window and shoot at those people," said the
sergeant hoarsely. Afterwards he coughed. Some of the fumes of the
fight had made way to his lungs.</p>

<p>Patterson looked at the door into this other room. He looked at
it as if he suspected it was to be his death-chamber. Then he
entered and stood across the body of Knowles and fired vigorously
into a group of plum trees.</p>

<p>"They can't take this house," declared the sergeant in a
contemptuous and argumentative tone. He was apparently replying to
somebody. The man who had been shot in the throat looked up at him.
Eight men were firing from the windows. The sergeant detected in a
corner three wounded men talking together feebly. "Don't you think
there is anything to do?" he bawled. "Go and get Knowles'
cartridges and give them to somebody who can use them! Take
Simpson's too." The man who had been shot in the throat looked at
him. Of the three wounded men who had been talking, one said: "My
leg is all doubled up under me, sergeant." He spoke
apologetically.</p>

<p>Meantime the sergeant was re-loading his rifle. His foot slipped
in the blood of the man who had been shot in the throat, and the
military boot made a greasy red streak on the floor.</p>

<p>"Why, we can hold this place," shouted the sergeant jubilantly.
"Who says we can't?"</p>

<p>Corporal Flagler suddenly spun away from his window and fell in
a heap.</p>

<p>"Sergeant," murmured a man as he dropped to a seat on the floor
out of danger, "I can't stand this. I swear I can't. I think we
should run away."</p>

<p>Morton, with the kindly eyes of a good shepherd, looked at the
man. "You are afraid, Johnston, you are afraid," he said softly.
The man struggled to his feet, cast upon the sergeant a gaze full
of admiration, reproach, and despair, and returned to his post. A
moment later he pitched forward, and thereafter his body hung out
of the window, his arms straight and the fists clenched.
Incidentally this corpse was pierced afterwards by chance three
times by bullets of the enemy.</p>

<p>The sergeant laid his rifle against the stone-work of the
window-frame and shot with care until his magazine was empty.
Behind him a man, simply grazed on the elbow, was wildly sobbing
like a girl. "Damn it, shut up," said Morton, without turning his
head. Before him was a vista of a garden, fields, clumps of trees,
woods, populated at the time with little fleeting figures.</p>

<p>He grew furious. "Why didn't he send me orders?" he cried aloud.
The emphasis on the word "he" was impressive. A mile back on the
road a galloper of the Hussars lay dead beside his dead horse.</p>

<p>The man who had been grazed on the elbow still set up his bleat.
Morton's fury veered to this soldier. "Can't you shut up? Can't you
shut up? Can't you shut up? Fight! That's the thing to do.
Fight!"</p>

<p>A bullet struck Morton, and he fell upon the man who had been
shot in the throat. There was a sickening moment. Then the sergeant
rolled off to a position upon the blood floor. He turned himself
with a last effort until he could look at the wounded who were able
to look at him.</p>

<p>"Kim up, the Kickers," he said thickly. His arms weakened and he
dropped on his face.</p>

<p>After an interval a young subaltern of the enemy's infantry,
followed by his eager men, burst into this reeking interior. But
just over the threshold he halted before the scene of blood and
death. He turned with a shrug to his sergeant. "God, I should have
estimated them at least one hundred strong."</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>WYOMING VALLEY TALES</h2>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch3-1" id="ch3-1"></a>I.&mdash;The Surrender of Forty
Fort</h3>

<p>Immediately after the battle of 3rd July, my mother said, "We
had best take the children and go into the Fort."</p>

<p>But my father replied, "I will not go. I will not leave my
property. All that I have in the world is here, and if the savages
destroy it they may as well destroy me also."</p>

<p>My mother said no other word. Our household was ever given to
stern silence, and such was my training that it did not occur to me
to reflect that if my father cared for his property it was not my
property, and I was entitled to care somewhat for my life.</p>

<p>Colonel Denison was true to the word which he had passed to me
at the Fort before the battle. He sent a messenger to my father,
and this messenger stood in the middle of our living-room and spake
with a clear, indifferent voice. "Colonel Denison bids me come here
and say that John Bennet is a wicked man, and the blood of his own
children will be upon his head." As usual, my father said nothing.
After the messenger had gone, he remained silent for hours in his
chair by the fire, and this stillness was so impressive to his
family that even my mother walked on tip-toe as she went about her
work. After this long time my father said, "Mary!"</p>

<p>Mother halted and looked at him. Father spoke slowly, and as if
every word was wrested from him with violent pangs. "Mary, you take
the girls and go to the Fort. I and Solomon and Andrew will go over
the mountain to Stroudsberg."</p>

<p>Immediately my mother called us all to set about packing such
things as could be taken to the Fort. And by nightfall we had seen
them within its pallisade, and my father, myself, and my little
brother Andrew, who was only eleven years old, were off over the
hills on a long march to the Delaware settlements. Father and I had
our rifles, but we seldom dared to fire them, because of the roving
bands of Indians. We lived as well as we could on blackberries and
raspberries. For the most part, poor little Andrew rode first on
the back of my father and then on my back. He was a good little
man, and only cried when he would wake in the dead of night very
cold and very hungry. Then my father would wrap him in an old grey
coat that was so famous in the Wyoming country that there was not
even an Indian who did not know of it. But this act he did without
any direct display of tenderness, for the fear, I suppose, that he
would weaken little Andrew's growing manhood. Now, in these days of
safety, and even luxury, I often marvel at the iron spirit of the
people of my young days. My father, without his coat and no doubt
very cold, would then sometimes begin to pray to his God in the
wilderness, but in low voice, because of the Indians. It was July,
but even July nights are cold in the pine mountains, breathing a
chill which goes straight to the bones.</p>

<p>But it is not my intention to give in this section the ordinary
adventures of the masculine part of my family. As a matter of fact,
my mother and the girls were undergoing in Forty Fort trials which
made as nothing the happenings on our journey, which ended in
safety.</p>

<p>My mother and her small flock were no sooner established in the
crude quarters within the pallisade than negotiations were opened
between Colonel Denison and Colonel Zebulon Butler on the American
side, and "Indian Butler" on the British side, for the capitulation
of the Fort with such arms and military stores as it contained, the
lives of the settlers to be strictly preserved. But "Indian Butler"
did not seem to feel free to promise safety for the lives of the
Continental Butler and the pathetic little fragment of the regular
troops. These men always fought so well against the Indians that
whenever the Indians could get them at their mercy there was small
chances of anything but a massacre. So every regular left before
the surrender; and I fancy that Colonel Zebulon Butler considered
himself a much-abused man, for if we had left ourselves entirely
under his direction there is no doubt but what we could have saved
the valley. He had taken us out on 3rd July because our militia
officers had almost threatened him. In the end he had said, "Very
well, I can go as far as any of you." I was always on Butler's side
of the argument, but owing to the singular arrangement of
circumstances, my opinion at the age of sixteen counted upon
neither the one side nor the other.</p>

<p>The Fort was left in charge of Colonel Denison. He had
stipulated before the surrender that no Indians should be allowed
to enter the stockade and molest these poor families of women whose
fathers and brothers were either dead or fled over the mountains,
unless their physical debility had been such that they were able
neither to get killed in the battle nor to take the long trail to
the Delaware. Of course, this excepts those men who were with
Washington.</p>

<p>For several days the Indians, obedient to the British officers,
kept out of the Fort, but soon they began to enter in small bands
and went sniffing and poking in every corner to find plunder. Our
people had hidden everything as well as they were able, and for a
period little was stolen. My mother told me that the first thing of
importance to go was Colonel Denison's hunting shirt, made of "fine
forty" linen. It had a double cape, and was fringed about the cape
and about the wristbands. Colonel Denison at the time was in my
mother's cabin. An Indian entered, and, rolling a thieving eye
about the place, sighted first of all the remarkable shirt which
Colonel Denison was wearing. He seized the shirt and began to tug,
while the Colonel backed away, tugging and protesting at the same
time. The women folk saw at once that the Colonel would be
tomahawked if he did not give up his shirt, and they begged him to
do it. He finally elected not to be tomahawked, and came out of his
shirt. While my mother unbuttoned the wristbands, the Colonel
cleverly dropped into the lap of a certain Polly Thornton a large
packet of Continental bills, and his money was thus saved for the
settlers.</p>

<p>Colonel Denison had several stormy interviews with "Indian
Butler," and the British commander finally ended in frankly
declaring that he could do nothing with the Indians at all. They
were beyond control, and the defenceless people in the Fort would
have to take the consequence. I do not mean that Colonel Denison
was trying to recover his shirt; I mean that he was objecting to a
situation which was now almost unendurable. I wish to record also
that the Colonel lost a large beaver hat. In both cases he willed
to be tomahawked and killed rather than suffer the indignity, but
mother prevailed over him. I must confess to this discreet age that
my mother engaged in fisticuffs with a squaw. This squaw came into
the cabin, and, without preliminary discussion, attempted to drag
from my mother the petticoat she was wearing. My mother forgot the
fine advice she had given to Colonel Denison. She proceeded to beat
the squaw out of the cabin, and although the squaw appealed to some
warriors who were standing without the warriors only laughed, and
my mother kept her petticoat.</p>

<p>The Indians took the feather beds of the people, and, ripping
them open, flung the feathers broadcast. Then they stuffed these
sacks full of plunder, and flung them across the backs of such of
the settlers' horses as they had been able to find. In the old days
my mother had had a side saddle, of which she was very proud when
she rode to meeting on it. She had also a brilliant scarlet cloak,
which every lady had in those days, and which I can remember as one
of the admirations of my childhood. One day my mother had the
satisfaction of seeing a squaw ride off from the Fort with this
prize saddle reversed on a small nag, and with the proud squaw thus
mounted wearing the scarlet cloak, also reversed. My sister Martha
told me afterwards that they laughed, even in their misfortunes. A
little later they had the satisfaction of seeing the smoke from our
house and barn arising over the tops of the trees.</p>

<p>When the Indians first began their pillaging, an old Mr. Sutton,
who occupied a cabin near my mother's cabin, anticipated them by
donning all his best clothes. He had had a theory that the
Americans would be free to retain the clothes that they wore. And
his best happened to be a suit of Quaker grey, from beaver to
boots, in which he had been married. Not long afterwards my mother
and my sisters saw passing the door an Indian arrayed in Quaker
grey, from beaver to boots. The only odd thing which impressed them
was that the Indian had appended to the dress a long string of
Yankee scalps. Sutton was a good Quaker, and if he had been wearing
the suit there would have been no string of scalps.</p>

<p>They were, in fact, badgered, insulted, robbed by the Indians so
openly that the British officers would not come into the Fort at
all. They stayed in their camp, affecting to be ignorant of what
was happening. It was about all they could do. The Indians had only
one idea of war, and it was impossible to reason with them when
they were flushed with victory and stolen rum.</p>

<p>The hand of fate fell heavily upon one rogue whose ambition it
was to drink everything that the Fort contained. One day he
inadvertently came upon a bottle of spirits of camphor, and in a
few hours he was dead.</p>

<p>But it was known that General Washington contemplated sending a
strong expedition into the valley, to clear it of the invaders and
thrash them. Soon there were no enemies in the country save small
roving parties of Indians, who prevented work in the fields and
burned whatever cabins that earlier torches had missed.</p>

<p>The first large party to come into the valley was composed
mainly of Captain Spaulding's company of regulars, and at its head
rode Colonel Zebulon Butler. My father, myself, and little Andrew
returned with this party to set to work immediately to build out of
nothing a prosperity similar to that which had vanished in the
smoke.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch3-2" id="ch3-2"></a>II.&mdash;"Ol' Bennet" and the
Indians</h3>

<p>My father was so well known of the Indians that, as I was
saying, his old grey coat was a sign through the northern country.
I know of no reason for this save that he was honest and
obstreperously minded his own affairs, and could fling a tomahawk
better than the best Indian. I will not declare upon how hard it is
for a man to be honest and to mind his own affairs, but I fully
know that it is hard to throw a tomahawk as my father threw it,
straighter than a bullet from a duelling pistol. He had always
dealt fairly with the Indians, and I cannot tell why they paled him
so bitterly, unless it was that when an Indian went foolishly drunk
my father would deplore it with his foot, if it so happened that
the drunkenness was done in our cabin. It is true to say that when
the war came, a singular large number of kicked Indians journeyed
from the Canadas to re-visit with torch and knife the scenes of the
kicking.</p>

<p>If people had thoroughly known my father he would have had no
enemies. He was the best of men. He had a code of behaviour for
himself, and for the whole world as well. If people wished his good
opinion they only had to do exactly as he did, and to have his
views. I remember that once my sister Martha made me a waistcoat of
rabbits' skins, and generally it was considered a great ornament.
But one day my father espied me in it, and commanded me to remove
it for ever. Its appearance was indecent, he said, and such a
garment tainted the soul of him who wore it. In the ensuing
fortnight a poor pedlar arrived from the Delaware, who had suffered
great misfortunes in the snows. My father fed him and warmed him,
and when he gratefully departed, gave him the rabbits' skin
waistcoat, and the poor man went off clothed indecently in a
garment that would taint his soul. Afterwards, in a daring mood, I
asked my father why he had so cursed this pedlar, and he
recommended that I should study my Bible more closely, and there
read that my own devious ways should be mended before I sought to
judge the enlightened acts of my elders. He set me to ploughing the
upper twelve acres, and I was hardly allowed to loose my grip of
the plough handles until every furrow was drawn.</p>

<p>The Indians called my father "Ol' Bennet," and he was known
broadcast as a man whose doom was sealed when the redskins caught
him. As I have said, the feeling is inexplicable to me. But Indians
who had been ill-used and maltreated by downright ruffians, against
whom revenge could with a kind of propriety be directed&mdash;many
of these Indians avowedly gave up a genuine wrong in order to
direct a fuller attention to the getting of my father's scalp. This
most unfair disposition of the Indians was a great, deep anxiety to
all of us up to the time when General Sullivan and his avenging
army marched through the valley and swept our tormentors afar.</p>

<p>And yet great calamities could happen in our valley even after
the coming and passing of General Sullivan. We were partly mistaken
in our gladness. The British force of Loyalists and Indians met
Sullivan in one battle, and finding themselves over-matched and
beaten, they scattered in all directions. The Loyalists, for the
most part, went home, but the Indians cleverly broke up into small
bands, and General Sullivan's army had no sooner marched beyond the
Wyoming Valley than some of these small bands were back into the
valley plundering outlying cabins and shooting people from the
thickets and woods that bordered the fields.</p>

<p>General Sullivan had left a garrison at Wilkesbarre, and at this
time we lived in its strong shadow. It was too formidable for the
Indians to attack, and it could protect all who valued protection
enough to remain under its wings, but it could do little against
the flying small bands. My father chafed in the shelter of the
garrison. His best lands lay beyond Forty Fort, and he wanted to be
at his ploughing. He made several brief references to his ploughing
that led us to believe that his ploughing was the fundamental
principle of life. None of us saw any means of contending him. My
sister Martha began to weep, but it no more mattered than if she
had began to laugh. My mother said nothing. Aye, my wonderful
mother said nothing. My father said he would go plough some of the
land above Forty Fort. Immediately this was with us some sort of a
law. It was like a rain, or a wind, or a drought.</p>

<p>He went, of course. My young brother Andrew went with him, and
he took the new span of oxen and a horse. They began to plough a
meadow which lay in a bend of the river above Forty Fort. Andrew
rode the horse hitched ahead of the oxen. At a certain thicket the
horse shied so that little Andrew was almost thrown down. My father
seemed to have begun a period of apprehension at this time, but it
was of no service. Four Indians suddenly appeared out of the
thicket. Swiftly, and in silence, they pounced with tomahawk,
rifle, and knife upon my father and my brother, and in a moment
they were captives of the redskins&mdash;that fate whose very
phrasing was a thrill to the heart of every colonist. It spelled
death, or that horrible simple absence, vacancy, mystery, which is
harder than death.</p>

<p>As for us, he had told my mother that if he and Andrew were not
returned at sundown she might construe a calamity. So at sundown we
gave the news to the Fort, and directly we heard the alarm gun
booming out across the dusk like a salute to the death of my
father, a solemn, final declaration. At the sound of this gun my
sisters all began newly to weep. It simply defined our misfortune.
In the morning a party was sent out, which came upon the deserted
plough, the oxen calmly munching, and the horse still excited and
affrighted. The soldiers found the trail of four Indians. They
followed the trail some distance over the mountains, but the
redskins with their captives had a long start, and pursuit was but
useless. The result of this expedition was that we knew at least
that father and Andrew had not been massacred immediately. But in
those days this was a most meagre consolation. It was better to
wish them well dead.</p>

<p>My father and Andrew were hurried over the hills at a terrible
pace by the four Indians. Andrew told me afterwards that he could
think sometimes that he was dreaming of being carried off by
goblins. The redskins said no word, and their mocassined feet made
no sound. They were like evil spirits. But it was as he caught
glimpses of father's pale face, every wrinkle in it deepened and
hardened, that Andrew saw everything in its light. And Andrew was
but thirteen years old. It is a tender age at which to be burned at
the stake.</p>

<p>In time the party came upon two more Indians, who had as a
prisoner a man named Lebbeus Hammond. He had left Wilkesbarre in
search of a strayed horse. He was riding the animal back to the
Fort when the Indians caught him. He and my father knew each other
well, and their greeting was like them.</p>

<p>"What! Hammond! You here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm here."</p>

<p>As the march was resumed, the principal Indian bestrode
Hammond's horse, but the horse was very high-nerved and scared, and
the bridle was only a temporary one made from hickory withes. There
was no saddle. And so finally the principal Indian came off with a
crash, alighting with exceeding severity upon his head. When he got
upon his feet he was in such a rage that the three captives thought
to see him dash his tomahawk into the skull of the trembling horse,
and, indeed, his arm was raised for the blow, but suddenly he
thought better of it. He had been touched by a real point of Indian
inspiration. The party was passing a swamp at the time, so he mired
the horse almost up to its eyes, and left it to the long death.</p>

<p>I had said that my father was well known of the Indians, and yet
I have to announce that none of his six captors knew him. To them
he was a complete stranger, for upon camping the first night they
left my father unbound. If they had had any idea that he was "Ol'
Bennet" they would never have left him unbound. He suggested to
Hammond that they try to escape that night, but Hammond seemed not
to care to try it yet.</p>

<p>In time they met a party of over forty Indians, commanded by a
Loyalist. In that band there were many who knew my father. They
cried out with rejoicing when they perceived him. "Ha!" they
shouted, "Ol' Bennet!" They danced about him, making gestures
expressive of the torture. Later in the day my father accidentally
pulled a button from his coat, and an Indian took it from him.</p>

<p>My father asked to be allowed to have it again, for he was a
very careful man, and in those days all good husbands were trained
to bring home the loose buttons. The Indians laughed, and explained
that a man who was to die at Wyallusing&mdash;one day's
march&mdash;need not be particular about a button.</p>

<p>The three prisoners were now sent off in care of seven Indians,
while the Loyalist took the remainder of his men down the valley to
further harass the settlers. The seven Indians were now very
careful of my father, allowing him scarce a wink. Their tomahawks
came up at the slightest sign. At the camp that night they bade the
prisoners lie down, and then placed poles across them. An Indian
lay upon either end of these poles. My father managed, however, to
let Hammond know that he was determined to make an attempt to
escape. There was only one night between him and the stake, and he
was resolved to make what use he could of it. Hammond seems to have
been dubious from the start, but the men of that time were not
daunted by broad risks. In his opinion the rising would be a
failure, but this did not prevent him from agreeing to rise with
his friend. My brother Andrew was not considered at all. No one
asked him if he wanted to rise against the Indians. He was only a
boy, and supposed to obey his elders. So, as none asked his views,
he kept them to himself; but I wager you he listened, all ears, to
the furtive consultations, consultations which were mere casual
phrases at times, and at other times swift, brief sentences shot
out in a whisper.</p>

<p>The band of seven Indians relaxed in vigilance as they
approached their own country, and on the last night from Wyallusing
the Indian part of the camp seemed much inclined to take deep
slumber after the long and rapid journey. The prisoners were held
to the ground by poles as on the previous night, and then the
Indians pulled their blankets over their heads and passed into
heavy sleep. One old warrior sat by the fire as guard, but he seems
to have been a singularly inefficient man, for he was continuously
drowsing, and if the captives could have got rid of the poles
across their chests and legs they would have made their flight
sooner.</p>

<p>The camp was on a mountain side amid a forest of lofty pines.
The night was very cold, and the blasts of wind swept down upon the
crackling, resinous fire. A few stars peeped through the feathery
pine branches. Deep in some gulch could be heard the roar of a
mountain stream. At one o'clock in the morning three of the Indians
arose, and, releasing the prisoners, commanded them to mend the
fire. The prisoners brought dead pine branches; the ancient warrior
on watch sleepily picked away with his knife at the deer's head
which he had roasted; the other Indians retired again to their
blankets, perhaps each depending upon the other for the exercise of
precautions. It was a tremendously slack business; the Indians were
feeling security because they knew that the prisoners were too wise
to try to run away.</p>

<p>The warrior on watch mumbled placidly to himself as he picked at
the deer's head. Then he drowsed again, just the short nap of a man
who had been up too long. My father stepped quickly to a spear, and
backed away from the Indian; then he drove it straight through his
chest. The Indian raised himself spasmodically, and then collapsed
into that camp fire which the captives had made burn so
brilliantly, and as he fell he screamed. Instantly his blanket, his
hair, he himself began to burn, and over him was my father tugging
frantically to get the spear out again.</p>

<p>My father did not recover the spear. It had so gone through the
old warrior that it could not readily be withdrawn, and my father
left it.</p>

<p>The scream of the watchman instantly aroused the other warriors,
who, as they scrambled in their blankets, found over them a
terrible white-lipped creature with an axe&mdash;an axe, the most
appallingly brutal of weapons. Hammond buried his weapon in the
head of the leader of the Indians even as the man gave out his
first great cry. The second blow missed an agile warrior's head,
but caught him in the nape of the neck, and he swung, to bury his
face in the red-hot ashes at the edge of the fire.</p>

<p>Meanwhile my brother Andrew had been gallantly snapping empty
guns. In fact he snapped three empty guns at the Indians, who were
in the purest panic. He did not snap the fourth gun, but took it by
the barrel, and, seeing a warrior rush past him, he cracked his
skull with the clubbed weapon. He told me, however, that his
snapping of the empty guns was very effective, because it made the
Indians jump and dodge.</p>

<p>Well, this slaughter continued in the red glare of the fire on
the lonely mountain side until two shrieking creatures ran off
through the trees, but even then my father hurled a tomahawk with
all his strength. It struck one of the fleeing Indians on the
shoulder. His blanket dropped from him, and he ran on practically
naked.</p>

<p>The three whites looked at each other, breathing deeply. Their
work was plain to them in the five dead and dying Indians
underfoot. They hastily gathered weapons and mocassins, and in six
minutes from the time when my father had hurled the spear through
the Indian sentinel they had started to make their way back to the
settlements, leaving the camp fire to burn out its short career
alone amid the dead.</p>

<h3><a name="ch3-3" id="ch3-3"></a>III.&mdash;The Battle of Forty
Fort</h3>

<p>The Congress, sitting at Philadelphia, had voted our Wyoming
country two companies of infantry for its protection against the
Indians, with the single provision that we raise the men and arm
them ourselves. This was not too brave a gift, but no one could
blame the poor Congress, and indeed one could wonder that they
found occasion to think of us at all, since at the time every
gentleman of them had his coat-tails gathered high in his hands in
readiness for flight to Baltimore. But our two companies of foot
were no sooner drilled, equipped, and in readiness to defend the
colony when they were ordered off down to the Jerseys to join
General Washington. So it can be seen what service Congress did us
in the way of protection. Thus the Wyoming Valley, sixty miles deep
in the wilderness, held its log-houses full of little besides
mothers, maids, and children. To the clamour against this situation
the badgered Congress could only reply by the issue of another
generous order, directing that one full company of foot be raised
in the town of Westmoreland for the defence of said town, and that
the said company find their own arms, ammunition, and blankets.
Even people with our sense of humour could not laugh at this
joke.</p>

<p>When the first two companies were forming, I had thought to join
one, but my father forbade me, saying that I was too young,
although I was full sixteen, tall, and very strong. So it turned
out that I was not off fighting with Washington's army when Butler
with his rangers and Indians raided Wyoming. Perhaps I was in the
better place to do my duty, if I could.</p>

<p>When wandering Indians visited the settlements, their
drunkenness and insolence were extreme, but the few white men
remained calm, and often enough pretended oblivion to insults
which, because of their wives and families, they dared not attempt
to avenge. In my own family, my father's imperturbability was
scarce superior to my mother's coolness, and such was our faith in
them that we twelve children also seemed to be fearless. Neighbour
after neighbour came to my father in despair of the defenceless
condition of the valley, declaring that they were about to leave
everything and flee over the mountains to Stroudsberg. My father
always wished them God-speed and said no more. If they urged him to
fly also, he usually walked away from them.</p>

<p>Finally there came a time when all the Indians vanished. We
rather would have had them tipsy and impudent in the settlements;
we knew what their disappearance portended. It was the serious
sign. Too soon the news came that "Indian Butler" was on his
way.</p>

<p>The valley was vastly excited. People with their smaller
possessions flocked into the block-houses, and militia officers
rode everywhere to rally every man. A small force of
Continentals&mdash;regulars of the line&mdash;had joined our
people, and the little army was now under the command of a
Continental officer, Major Zebulon Butler.</p>

<p>I had thought that with all this hubbub of an impending life and
death struggle in the valley that my father would allow the work of
our farm to slacken. But in this I was notably mistaken. The
milking and the feeding and the work in the fields went on as if
there never had been an Indian south of the Canadas. My mother and
my sisters continued to cook, to wash, to churn, to spin, to dye,
to mend, to make soap, to make maple sugar. Just before the break
of each day, my younger brother Andrew and myself tumbled out for
some eighteen hours' work, and woe to us if we departed the length
of a dog's tail from the laws which our father had laid down. It
was a life with which I was familiar, but it did seem to me that
with the Indians almost upon us he might have allowed me, at least,
to go to the Fort and see our men drilling.</p>

<p>But one morning we aroused as usual at his call at the foot of
the ladder, and, dressing more quickly than Andrew, I climbed down
from the loft to find my father seated by a blazing fire reading by
its light in his Bible.</p>

<p>"Son," said he.</p>

<p>"Yes, father?"</p>

<p>"Go and fight."</p>

<p>Without a word more I made hasty preparation. It was the first
time in my life that I had a feeling that my father would change
his mind. So strong was this fear that I did not even risk a
good-bye to my mother and sisters. At the end of the clearing I
looked back. The door of the house was open, and in the blazing
light of the fire I saw my father seated as I had left him.</p>

<p>At Forty Fort I found between three and four hundred under arms,
while the stockade itself was crowded with old men, and women and
children. Many of my acquaintances welcomed me; indeed, I seemed to
know everybody save a number of the Continental officers. Colonel
Zebulon Butler was in chief command, while directly under him was
Colonel Denison, a man of the valley, and much respected. Colonel
Denison asked news of my father, whose temper he well knew. He said
to me&mdash;"If God spares Nathan Denison I shall tell that
obstinate old fool my true opinion of him. He will get himself and
all his family butchered and scalped."</p>

<p>I joined Captain Bidlack's company for the reason that a number
of my friends were in it. Every morning we were paraded and drilled
in the open ground before the Fort, and I learned to present arms
and to keep my heels together, although to this day I have never
been able to see any point to these accomplishments, and there was
very little of the presenting of arms or of the keeping together of
heels in the battle which followed these drills. I may say truly
that I would now be much more grateful to Captain Bidlack if he had
taught us to run like a wild horse.</p>

<p>There was considerable friction between the officers of our
militia and the Continental officers. I believe the Continental
officers had stated themselves as being in favour of a cautious
policy, whereas the men of the valley were almost unanimous in
their desire to meet "Indian Butler" more than half way. They knew
the country, they said, and they knew the Indians, and they deduced
that the proper plan was to march forth and attack the British
force near the head of the valley. Some of the more hot-headed ones
rather openly taunted the Continentals, but these veterans of
Washington's army remained silent and composed amid more or less
wildness of talk. My own concealed opinions were that, although our
people were brave and determined, they had much better allow the
Continental officers to manage the valley's affairs.</p>

<p>At the end of June, we heard the news that Colonel John Butler,
with some four hundred British and Colonial troops, which he called
the Rangers, and with about five hundred Indians, had entered the
valley at its head and taken Fort Wintermoot after an opposition of
a perfunctory character. I could present arms very well, but I do
not think that I could yet keep my heels together. But "Indian
Butler" was marching upon us, and even Captain Bidlack refrained
from being annoyed at my refractory heels.</p>

<p>The officers held councils of war, but in truth both fort and
camp rang with a discussion in which everybody joined with great
vigour and endurance. I may except the Continental officers, who
told us what they thought we should do, and then, declaring that
there was no more to be said, remained in a silence which I thought
was rather grim. The result was that on the 3rd of July our force
of about 300 men marched away, amid the roll of drums and the proud
career of flags, to meet "Indian Butler" and his two kinds of
savages. There yet remains with me a vivid recollection of a close
row of faces above the stockade of Forty Fort which viewed our
departure with that profound anxiety which only an imminent danger
of murder and scalping can produce. I myself was never particularly
afraid of the Indians, for to my mind the great and almost the only
military virtue of the Indians was that they were silent men in the
woods. If they were met squarely on terms approaching equality,
they could always be whipped. But it was another matter to a fort
filled with women and children and cripples, to whom the coming of
the Indians spelled pillage, arson, and massacre. The British sent
against us in those days some curious upholders of the honour of
the King, and although Indian Butler, who usually led them,
afterwards contended that everything was performed with decency and
care for the rules, we always found that such of our dead whose
bodies we recovered invariably lacked hair on the tops of their
heads, and if worse wasn't done to them we wouldn't even use the
word mutilate.</p>

<p>Colonel Zebulon Butler rode along the column when we halted once
for water. I looked at him eagerly, hoping to read in his face some
sign of his opinions. But on the soldierly mask I could read
nothing, although I am certain now that he felt that the fools
among us were going to get us well beaten. But there was no
vacillation in the direction of our march. We went straight until
we could hear through the woods the infrequent shots of our leading
party at retreating Indian scouts.</p>

<p>Our Colonel Butler then sent forward four of his best officers,
who reconnoitered the ground in the enemy's front like so many
engineers marking the place for a bastion. Then each of the six
companies were told their place in the line. We of Captain
Bidlack's company were on the extreme right. Then we formed in line
and marched into battle, with me burning with the high resolve to
kill Indian Butler and bear his sword into Forty Fort, while at the
same time I was much shaken that one of Indian Butler's Indians
might interfere with the noble plan. We moved stealthily among the
pine trees, and I could not forbear looking constantly to right and
left to make certain that everybody was of the same mind about this
advance. With our Captain Bidlack was Captain Durkee of the
regulars. He was also a valley man, and it seemed that every time I
looked behind me I met the calm eye of this officer, and I came to
refrain from looking behind me.</p>

<p>Still, I was very anxious to shoot Indians, and if I had doubted
my ability in this direction I would have done myself a great
injustice, for I could drive a nail to the head with a rifle ball
at respectable range. I contend that I was not at all afraid of the
enemy, but I much feared that certain of my comrades would change
their minds about the expediency of battle on the 3rd July,
1778.</p>

<p>But our company was as steady and straight as a fence. I do not
know who first saw dodging figures in the shadows of the trees in
our front. The first fire we received, however, was from our flank,
where some hidden Indians were yelling and firing, firing and
yelling. We did not mind the war-whoops. We had heard too many
drunken Indians in the settlements before the war. They wounded the
lieutenant of the company next to ours, and a moment later they
killed Captain Durkee. But we were steadily advancing and firing
regular volleys into the shifting frieze of figures before us. The
Indians gave their cries as if the imps of Hades had given tongue
to their emotions. They fell back before us so rapidly and so
cleverly that one had to watch his chance as the Indians sped from
tree to tree. I had a sudden burst of rapture that they were
beaten, and this was accentuated when I stepped over the body of an
Indian whose forehead had a hole in it as squarely in the middle as
if the location had been previously surveyed. In short, we were
doing extremely well.</p>

<p>Soon we began to see the slower figures of white men through the
trees, and it is only honest to say that they were easier to shoot.
I myself caught sight of a fine officer in a uniform that seemed of
green and buff. His sword-belt was fastened by a great shining
brass plate, and, no longer feeling the elegancies of marksmanship,
I fired at the brass plate. Such was the conformation of the ground
between us that he disappeared as if he had sunk in the sea. We,
all of us, were loading behind the trees and then charging ahead
with fullest confidence.</p>

<p>But suddenly from our own left came wild cries from our men,
while at the same time the yells of Indians redoubled in that
direction. Our rush checked itself instinctively. The cries rolled
toward us. Once I heard a word that sounded like "Quarte." Then, to
be truthful, our line wavered. I heard Captain Bidlack give an
angry and despairing shout, and I think he was killed before he
finished it.</p>

<p>In a word, our left wing had gone to pieces. It was in complete
rout. I know not the truth of the matter; but it seems that Colonel
Denison had given an order which was misinterpreted for the order
to retreat. At any rate, there can be no doubt of how fast the left
wing ran away.</p>

<p>We ran away too. The company on our immediate left was the
company of regulars, and I remember some red-faced and
powder-stained men bellowing at me contemptuously. That company
stayed, and, for the most part, died. I don't know what they
mustered when we left the Fort, but from the battle eleven worn and
ragged men emerged. In my running was wisdom. The country was
suddenly full of fleet Indians, upon us with the tomahawk. Behind
me as I ran I could hear the screams of men cleaved to the earth. I
think the first things that most of us discarded were our rifles.
Afterward, upon serious reflection, I could not recall where I gave
my rifle to the grass.</p>

<p>I ran for the river. I saw some of our own men running ahead of
me and I envied them. My point of contact with the river was the
top of a high bank. But I did not hesitate to leap for the water
with all my ounces of muscle. I struck out strongly for the other
shore. I expected to be shot in the water. Up stream, and down
stream, I could hear the crack of rifles, but none of the enemy
seemed to be paying direct heed to me. I swam so well that I was
soon able to put my feet on the slippery round stones and wade.
When I reached a certain sandy beach, I lay down and puffed and
blew my exhaustion. I watched the scene on the river. Indians
appeared in groups on the opposite bank, firing at various heads of
my comrades, who, like me, had chosen the Susquehanna as their
refuge. I saw more than one hand fling up and the head turn
sideways and sink.</p>

<p>I set out for home. I set out for home in that perfect spirit of
dependence which I had always felt toward my father and my mother.
When I arrived I found nobody in the living room but my father
seated in his great chair and reading his Bible, even as I had left
him.</p>

<p>The whole shame of the business came upon me suddenly. "Father,"
I choked out, "we have been beaten."</p>

<p>"Aye," said he, "I expected it."</p>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>LONDON IMPRESSIONS</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Chapter I</h3>

<p>London at first consisted of a porter with the most charming
manners in the world, and a cabman with a supreme intelligence,
both observing my profound ignorance without contempt or humour of
any kind observable in their manners. It was in a great resounding
vault of a place where there were many people who had come home,
and I was displeased because they knew the detail of the business,
whereas I was confronting the inscrutable. This made them appear
very stony-hearted to the sufferings of one of whose existence, to
be sure, they were entirely unaware, and I remember taking great
pleasure in disliking them heartily for it. I was in an agony of
mind over my baggage, or my luggage, or my&mdash;perhaps it is well
to shy around this terrible international question; but I remember
that when I was a lad I was told that there was a whole nation that
said luggage instead of baggage, and my boyish mind was filled at
the time with incredulity and scorn. In the present case it was a
thing that I understood to involve the most hideous confessions of
imbecility on my part, because I had evidently to go out to some
obscure point and espy it and claim it, and take trouble for it;
and I would rather have had my pockets filled with bread and
cheese, and had no baggage at all.</p>

<p>Mind you, this was not at all a homage that I was paying to
London. I was paying homage to a new game. A man properly lazy does
not like new experiences until they become old ones. Moreover, I
have been taught that a man, any man, who has a thousand times more
points of information on a certain thing than I have will bully me
because of it, and pour his advantages upon my bowed head until I
am drenched with his superiority. It was in my education to concede
some licence of the kind in this case, but the holy father of a
porter and the saintly cabman occupied the middle distance
imperturbably, and did not come down from their hills to clout me
with knowledge. From this fact I experienced a criminal elation. I
lost view of the idea that if I had been brow-beaten by porters and
cabmen from one end of the United States to the other end I should
warmly like it, because in numbers they are superior to me, and
collectively they can have a great deal of fun out of a matter that
would merely afford me the glee of the latent butcher.</p>

<p>This London, composed of a porter and a cabman, stood to me
subtly as a benefactor. I had scanned the drama, and found that I
did not believe that the mood of the men emanated unduly from the
feature that there was probably more shillings to the square inch
of me than there were shillings to the square inch of them. Nor yet
was it any manner of palpable warm-heartedness or other natural
virtue. But it was a perfect artificial virtue; it was drill,
plain, simple drill. And now was I glad of their drilling, and
vividly approved of it, because I saw that it was good for me.
Whether it was good or bad for the porter and the cabman I could
not know; but that point, mark you, came within the pale, of my
respectable rumination.</p>

<p>I am sure that it would have been more correct for me to have
alighted upon St. Paul's and described no emotion until I was
overcome by the Thames Embankment and the Houses of Parliament. But
as a matter of fact I did not see them for some days, and at this
time they did not concern me at all. I was born in London at a
railroad station, and my new vision encompassed a porter and a
cabman. They deeply absorbed me in new phenomena, and I did not
then care to see the Thames Embankment nor the Houses of
Parliament. I considered the porter and the cabman to be more
important.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Chapter II</h3>

<p>The cab finally rolled out of the gas-lit vault into a vast
expanse of gloom. This changed to the shadowy lines of a street
that was like a passage in a monstrous cave. The lamps winking here
and there resembled the little gleams at the caps of the miners.
They were not very competent illuminations at best, merely being
little pale flares of gas that at their most heroic periods could
only display one fact concerning this tunnel&mdash;the fact of
general direction. But at any rate I should have liked to have
observed the dejection of a search-light if it had been called upon
to attempt to bore through this atmosphere. In it each man sat in
his own little cylinder of vision, so to speak. It was not so small
as a sentry-box nor so large as a circus tent, but the walls were
opaque, and what was passing beyond the dimensions of his cylinder
no man knew.</p>

<p>It was evident that the paving was very greasy, but all the cabs
that passed through my cylinder were going at a round trot, while
the wheels, shod in rubber, whirred merely like bicycles. The hoofs
of the animals themselves did not make that wild clatter which I
knew so well. New York, in fact, roars always like ten thousand
devils. We have ingenuous and simple ways of making a din in New
York that cause the stranger to conclude that each citizen is
obliged by statute to provide himself with a pair of cymbals and a
drum. If anything by chance can be turned into a noise it is
promptly turned. We are engaged in the development of a human
creature with very large, sturdy, and doubly-fortified ears.</p>

<p>It was not too late at night, but this London moved with the
decorum and caution of an undertaker. There was a silence, and yet
there was no silence. There was a low drone, perhaps a humming
contributed inevitably by closely-gathered thousands, and yet on
second thoughts it was to me silence. I had perched my ears for the
note of London, the sound made simply by the existence of five
million people in one place. I had imagined something deep, vastly
deep, a bass from a mythical organ, but found, as far as I was
concerned, only a silence.</p>

<p>New York in numbers is a mighty city, and all day and all night
it cries its loud, fierce, aspiring cry, a noise of men beating
upon barrels, a noise of men beating upon tin, a terrific racket
that assails the abject skies. No one of us seemed to question this
row as a certain consequence of three or four million people living
together and scuffling for coin, with more agility, perhaps, but
otherwise in the usual way. However, after this easy silence of
London, which in numbers is a mightier city, I began to feel that
there was a seduction in this idea of necessity. Our noise in New
York was not a consequence of our rapidity at all. It was a
consequence of our bad pavements.</p>

<p>Any brigade of artillery in Europe that would love to assemble
its batteries, and then go on a gallop over the land, thundering
and thundering, would give up the idea of thunder at once if it
could hear Tim Mulligan drive a beer waggon along one of the side
streets of cobbled New York.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Chapter III</h3>

<p>Finally, a great thing came to pass. The cab horse, proceeding
at a sharp trot, found himself suddenly at the top of an incline,
where through the rain the pavement shone like an expanse of ice.
It looked to me as if there was going to be a tumble. In an
accident of such a kind a hansom becomes really a cannon in which a
man finds that he has paid shillings for the privilege of serving
as a projectile. I was making a rapid calculation of the arc that I
would describe in my flight, when the horse met his crisis with a
masterly device that I could not have imagined. He tranquilly
braced his four feet like a bundle of stakes, and then, with a
gentle gaiety of demeanour, he slid swiftly and gracefully to the
bottom of the hill as if he had been a toboggan. When the incline
ended he caught his gait again with great dexterity, and went
pattering off through another tunnel.</p>

<p>I at once looked upon myself as being singularly blessed by this
sight. This horse had evidently originated this system of skating
as a diversion, or, more probably, as a precaution against the
slippery pavement; and he was, of course, the inventor and sole
proprietor&mdash;two terms that are not always in conjunction. It
surely was not to be supposed that there could be two skaters like
him in the world. He deserved to be known and publicly praised for
this accomplishment. It was worthy of many records and exhibitions.
But when the cab arrived at a place where some dipping streets met,
and the flaming front of a music-hall temporarily widened my
cylinder, behold there were many cabs, and as the moment of
necessity came the horses were all skaters. They were gliding in
all directions. It might have been a rink. A great omnibus was
hailed by a hand under an umbrella on the side walk, and the
dignified horses bidden to halt from their trot did not waste time
in wild and unseemly spasms. They, too, braced their legs and slid
gravely to the end of their momentum.</p>

<p>It was not the feat, but it was the word which had at this time
the power to conjure memories of skating parties on moonlit lakes,
with laughter ringing over the ice, and a great red bonfire on the
shore among the hemlocks.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Chapter IV</h3>

<p>A terrible thing in nature is the fall of a horse in his
harness. It is a tragedy. Despite their skill in skating there was
that about the pavement on the rainy evening which filled me with
expectations of horses going headlong. Finally it happened just in
front. There was a shout and a tangle in the darkness, and
presently a prostrate cab horse came within my cylinder. The
accident having been a complete success and altogether concluded, a
voice from the side walk said, "<i>Look</i> out, now! <i>Be</i>
more careful, can't you?"</p>

<p>I remember a constituent of a Congressman at Washington who had
tried in vain to bore this Congressman with a wild project of some
kind. The Congressman eluded him with skill, and his rage and
despair ultimately culminated in the supreme grievance that he
could not even get near enough to the Congressman to tell him to go
to Hades.</p>

<p>This cabman should have felt the same desire to strangle this
man who spoke from the side walk. He was plainly impotent; he was
deprived of the power of looking out. There was nothing now for
which to look out. The man on the side walk had dragged a corpse
from a pond and said to it, "<i>Be</i> more careful, can't you, or
you'll drown?" My cabman pulled up and addressed a few words of
reproach to the other. Three or four figures loomed into my
cylinder, and as they appeared spoke to the author or the victim of
the calamity in varied terms of displeasure. Each of these
reproaches was couched in terms that defined the situation as
impending. No blind man could have conceived that the precipitate
phrase of the incident was absolutely closed. "<i>Look</i> out now,
cawnt you?" And there was nothing in his mind which approached
these sentiments near enough to tell them to go to Hades.</p>

<p>However, it needed only an ear to know presently that these
expressions were formul. It was merely the obligatory dance which
the Indians had to perform before they went to war. These men had
come to help, but as a regular and traditional preliminary they had
first to display to this cabman their idea of his ignominy.</p>

<p>The different thing in the affair was the silence of the victim.
He retorted never a word. This, too, to me seemed to be an
obedience to a recognised form. He was the visible criminal, if
there was a criminal, and there was born of it a privilege for
them.</p>

<p>They unfastened the proper straps and hauled back the cab. They
fetched a mat from some obscure place of succour, and pushed it
carefully under the prostrate thing. From this panting, quivering
mass they suddenly and emphatically reconstructed a horse. As each
man turned to go his way he delivered some superior caution to the
cabman while the latter buckled his harness.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Chapter V</h3>

<p>There was to be noticed in this band of rescuers a young man in
evening clothes and top-hat. Now, in America a young man in evening
clothes and a top-hat may be a terrible object. He is not likely to
do violence, but he is likely to do impassivity and indifference to
the point where they become worse than violence. There are certain
of the more idle phases of civilisation to which America has not
yet awakened&mdash;and it is a matter of no moment if she remains
unaware. This matter of hats is one of them. I recall a legend
recited to me by an esteemed friend, ex-Sheriff of Tin Can, Nevada.
Jim Cortright, one of the best gun-fighters in town, went on a
journey to Chicago, and while there he procured a top-hat. He was
quite sure how Tin Can would accept this innovation, but he relied
on the celerity with which he could get a six-shooter in action.
One Sunday Jim examined his guns with his usual care, placed the
top-hat on the back of his head, and sauntered coolly out into the
streets of Tin Can.</p>

<p>Now, while Jim was in Chicago some progressive citizen had
decided that Tin Can needed a bowling alley. The carpenters went to
work the next morning, and an order for the balls and pins was
telegraphed to Denver. In three days the whole population was
concentrated at the new alley betting their outfits and their
lives.</p>

<p>It has since been accounted very unfortunate that Jim Cortright
had not learned of bowling alleys at his mother's knee nor even
later in the mines. This portion of his mind was singularly
belated. He might have been an Apache for all he knew of bowling
alleys.</p>

<p>In his careless stroll through the town, his hands not far from
his belt and his eyes going sideways in order to see who would
shoot first at the hat, he came upon this long, low shanty where
Tin Can was betting itself hoarse over a game between a team from
the ranks of Excelsior Hose Company No. 1 and a team composed from
the <i>habitues</i> of the "Red Light" saloon.</p>

<p>Jim, in blank ignorance of bowling phenomena, wandered casually
through a little door into what must always be termed the wrong end
of a bowling alley. Of course, he saw that the supreme moment had
come. They were not only shooting at the hat and at him, but the
low-down cusses were using the most extraordinary and hellish
ammunition. Still, perfectly undaunted, however, Jim retorted with
his two Colts, and killed three of the best bowlers in Tin Can.</p>

<p>The ex-Sheriff vouched for this story. He himself had gone
headlong through the door at the firing of the first shot with that
simple courtesy which leads Western men to donate the fighters
plenty of room. He said that afterwards the hat was the cause of a
number of other fights, and that finally a delegation of prominent
citizens were obliged to wait upon Cortright and ask him if he
wouldn't take that thing away somewhere and bury it. Jim pointed
out to them that it was his hat, and that he would regard it as a
cowardly concession if he submitted to their dictation in the
matter of his headgear. He added that he purposed to continue to
wear his top-hat on every occasion when he happened to feel that
the wearing of a top-hat was a joy and a solace to him.</p>

<p>The delegation sadly retired, and announced to the town that Jim
Cortright had openly defied them, and had declared his purpose of
forcing his top-hat on the pained attention of Tin Can whenever he
chose. Jim Cortright's plug hat became a phrase with considerable
meaning to it.</p>

<p>However, the whole affair ended in a great passionate outburst
of popular revolution. Spike Foster was a friend of Cortright, and
one day, when the latter was indisposed, Spike came to him and
borrowed the hat. He had been drinking heavily at the "Red Light,"
and was in a supremely reckless mood. With the terrible gear
hanging jauntily over his eye and his two guns drawn, he walked
straight out into the middle of the square in front of the Palace
Hotel, and drew the attention of all Tin Can by a blood-curdling
imitation of the yowl of a mountain lion.</p>

<p>This was when the long-suffering populace arose as one man. The
top-hat had been flaunted once too often. When Spike Foster's
friends came to carry him away they found nearly a hundred and
fifty men shooting busily at a mark&mdash;and the mark was the
hat.</p>

<p>My informant told me that he believed he owed his popularity in
Tin Can, and subsequently his election to the distinguished office
of Sheriff, to the active and prominent part he had taken in the
proceedings.</p>

<p>The enmity to the top-hat expressed by the convincing anecdote
exists in the American West at present, I think, in the perfection
of its strength; but disapproval is not now displayed by volleys
from the citizens, save in the most aggravating cases. It is at
present usually a matter of mere jibe and general contempt. The
East, however, despite a great deal of kicking and gouging, is
having the top-hat stuffed slowly and carefully down its throat,
and there now exist many young men who consider that they could not
successfully conduct their lives without this furniture.</p>

<p>To speak generally, I should say that the headgear then supplies
them with a kind of ferocity of indifference. There is fire, sword,
and pestilence in the way they heed only themselves. Philosophy
should always know that indifference is a militant thing. It
batters down the walls of cities, and murders the women and
children amid flames and the purloining of altar vessels. When it
goes away it leaves smoking ruins, where lie citizens bayoneted
through the throat. It is not a children's pastime like mere
highway robbery.</p>

<p>Consequently in America we may be much afraid of these young
men. We dive down valleys so that we may not kow-tow. It is a
fearsome thing.</p>

<p>Taught thus a deep fear of the top-hat in its effect upon youth,
I was not prepared for the move of this particular young man when
the cab-horse fell. In fact, I grovelled in my corner that I might
not see the cruel stateliness of his passing. But in the meantime
he had crossed the street, and contributed the strength of his back
and some advice, as well as the formal address, to the cabman on
the importance of looking out immediately.</p>

<p>I felt that I was making a notable collection. I had a new kind
of porter, a cylinder of vision, horses that could skate, and now I
added a young man in a top-hat who would tacitly admit that the
beings around him were alive. He was not walking a churchyard
filled with inferior headstones. He was walking the world, where
there were people, many people.</p>

<p>But later I took him out of the collection. I thought he had
rebelled against the manner of a class, but I soon discovered that
the top-hat was not the property of a class. It was the property of
rogues, clerks, theatrical agents, damned seducers, poor men,
nobles, and others. In fact, it was the universal rigging. It was
the only hat; all other forms might as well be named ham, or chops,
or oysters. I retracted my admiration of the young man because he
may have been merely a rogue.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Chapter VI</h3>

<p>There was a window whereat an enterprising man by dodging two
placards and a calendar was entitled to view a young woman. She was
dejectedly writing in a large book. She was ultimately induced to
open the window a trifle. "What nyme, please?" she said wearily. I
was surprised to hear this language from her. I had expected to be
addressed on a submarine topic. I have seen shell fishes sadly
writing in large books at the bottom of a gloomy aquarium who could
not ask me what was my "nyme."</p>

<p>At the end of the hall there was a grim portal marked "Lift." I
pressed an electric button and heard an answering tinkle in the
heavens. There was an upholstered settle near at hand, and I
discovered the reason. A deer-stalking peace drooped upon
everything, and in it a man could invoke the passing of a lazy
pageant of twenty years of his life.</p>

<p>The dignity of a coffin being lowered into a grave surrounded
the ultimate appearance of the lift. The expert we in America call
the elevator-boy stepped from the car, took three paces forward,
faced to attention, and saluted. This elevator-boy could not have
been less than sixty years of age; a great white beard streamed
towards his belt. I saw that the lift had been longer on its voyage
than I had suspected.</p>

<p>Later in our upward progress a natural event would have been an
establishment of social relations. Two enemies imprisoned together
during the still hours of a balloon journey would, I believe,
suffer a mental amalgamation. The overhang of a common fate, a
great principal fact, can make an equality and a truce between any
pair. Yet, when I disembarked, a final survey of the grey beard
made me recall that I had failed even to ask the boy whether he had
not taken probably three trips on this lift.</p>

<p>My windows overlooked simply a great sea of night, in which were
swimming little gas fishes.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Chapter VII</h3>

<p>I have of late been led to wistfully reflect that many of the
illustrators are very clever. In an impatience, which was denoted
by a certain economy of apparel, I went to a window to look upon
day-lit London. There were the 'buses parading the streets with the
miens of elephants. There were the police looking precisely as I
had been informed by the prints. There were the sandwich-men. There
was almost everything.</p>

<p>But the artists had not told me the sound of London. Now, in New
York the artists are able to pourtray sound, because in New York a
dray is not a dray at all; it is a great potent noise hauled by two
or more horses. When a magazine containing an illustration of a New
York street is sent to me, I always know it beforehand. I can hear
it coming through the mails. As I have said previously, this which
I must call sound of London was to me only a silence.</p>

<p>Later, in front of the hotel a cabman that I hailed said to
me&mdash;"Are you gowing far, sir? I've got a byby here, and want
to giv'er a bit of a blough." This impressed me as being probably a
quotation from an early Egyptian poet, but I learned soon enough
that the word "byby" was the name of some kind or condition of
horse. The cabman's next remark was addressed to a boy who took a
perilous dive between the byby's nose and a cab in front. "That's
roight. Put your head in there and get it jammed&mdash;a whackin
good place for it, I should think." Although the tone was low and
circumspect, I have never heard a better off-handed declamation.
Every word was cut clear of disreputable alliances with its
neighbours. The whole thing was as clean as a row of pewter mugs.
The influence of indignation upon the voice caused me to reflect
that we might devise a mechanical means of inflaming some in that
constellation of mummers which is the heritage of the Anglo-Saxon
race.</p>

<p>Then I saw the drilling of vehicles by two policemen. There were
four torrents converging at a point, and when four torrents
converge at one point engineering experts buy tickets for another
place.</p>

<p>But here, again, it was drill, plain, simple drill. I must not
falter in saying that I think the management of the
traffic&mdash;as the phrase goes&mdash;to be distinctly
illuminating and wonderful. The police were not ruffled and
exasperated. They were as peaceful as two cows in a pasture.</p>

<p>I remember once remarking that mankind, with all its boasted
modern progress, had not yet been able to invent a turnstile that
will commute in fractions. I have now learned that 756
rights-of-way cannot operate simultaneously at one point.
Right-of-way, like fighting women, requires space. Even two
rights-of-way can make a scene which is only suited to the tastes
of an ancient public.</p>

<p>This truth was very evidently recognised. There was only one
right-of-way at a time. The police did not look behind them to see
if their orders were to be obeyed; they knew they were to be
obeyed. These four torrents were drilling like four battalions. The
two blue-cloth men man&oelig;uvred them in solemn, abiding peace,
the silence of London.</p>

<p>I thought at first that it was the intellect of the individual,
but I looked at one constable closely and his face was as afire
with intelligence as a flannel pin-cushion. It was not the police,
and it was not the crowd. It was the police and the crowd. Again,
it was drill.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Chapter VIII</h3>

<p>I have never been in the habit of reading signs. I don't like to
read signs. I have never met a man that liked to read signs. I once
invented a creature who could play the piano with a hammer, and I
mentioned him to a professor in Harvard University whose
peculiarity was Sanscrit. He had the same interest in my invention
that I have in a certain kind of mustard. And yet this mustard has
become a part of me. Or, I have become a part of this mustard.
Further, I know more of an ink, a brand of hams, a kind of
cigarette, and a novelist than any man living. I went by train to
see a friend in the country, and after passing through a patent
mucilage, some more hams, a South African Investment Company, a
Parisian millinery firm, and a comic journal, I alighted at a new
and original kind of corset. On my return journey the road almost
continuously ran through soap.</p>

<p>I have accumulated superior information concerning these things,
because I am at their mercy. If I want to know where I am I must
find the definitive sign. This accounts for my glib use of the word
mucilage, as well as the titles of other staples.</p>

<p>I suppose even the Briton in mixing his life must sometimes
consult the labels on 'buses and streets and stations, even as the
chemist consults the labels on his bottles and boxes. A brave man
would possibly affirm that this was suggested by the existence of
the labels.</p>

<p>The reason that I did not learn more about hams and mucilage in
New York seems to me to be partly due to the fact that the British
advertiser is allowed to exercise an unbridled strategy in his
attack with his new corset or whatever upon the defensive public.
He knows that the vulnerable point is the informatory sign which
the citizen must, of course, use for his guidance, and then, with
horse, foot, guns, corsets, hams, mucilage, investment companies,
and all, he hurls himself at the point.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I have discovered a way to make the Sanscrit scholar
heed my creature who plays the piano with a hammer.</p>

<h3><a name="ch5-1" id="ch5-1"></a>Stories Told by an Artist in New
York</h3>

<p class="caption"><b>A Tale about How "Great Grief" got His
Holiday Dinner.</b>
</p>

<p>Wrinkles had been peering into the little dry-goods box that
acted as a cupboard.</p>

<p>"There are only two eggs and a half of a loaf of bread left," he
announced brutally.</p>

<p>"Heavens!" said Warwickson, from where he lay smoking on the
bed. He spoke in his usual dismal voice. By it he had earned his
popular name of Great Grief.</p>

<p>Wrinkles was a thrifty soul. A sight of an almost bare cupboard
maddened him. Even when he was not hungry, the ghosts of his
careful ancestors caused him to rebel against it. He sat down with
a virtuous air. "Well, what are we going to do?" he demanded of the
others. It is good to be the thrifty man in a crowd of unsuccessful
artists, for then you can keep the others from starving peacefully.
"What are we going to do?"</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up, Wrinkles," said Grief from the bed. "You make me
think."</p>

<p>Little Pennoyer, with head bended afar down, had been busily
scratching away at a pen and ink drawing. He looked up from his
board to utter his plaintive optimism.</p>

<p>"The <i>Monthly Amazement</i> may pay me to-morrow. They ought
to. I've waited over three months now. I'm going down there
to-morrow, and perhaps I'll get it."</p>

<p>His friends listened to him tolerantly, but at last Wrinkles
could not omit a scornful giggle. He was such an old man, almost
twenty-eight, and he had seen so many little boys be brave. "Oh, no
doubt, Penny, old man." Over on the bed Grief croaked deep down in
his throat. Nothing was said for a long time thereafter.</p>

<p>The crash of the New York streets came faintly. Occasionally one
could hear the tramp of feet in the intricate corridors of this
begrimed building that squatted, slumbering and aged, between two
exalted commercial structures that would have had to bend afar down
to perceive it. The light snow beat pattering into the window
corners, and made vague and grey the vista of chimneys and roofs.
Often the wind scurried swiftly and raised a long cry.</p>

<p>Great Grief leaned upon his elbow. "See to the fire, will you,
Wrinkles?"</p>

<p>Wrinkles pulled the coal-box out from under the bed and threw
open the stove door preparatory to shovelling some fuel. A red
glare plunged in the first faint shadow of dusk. Little Pennoyer
threw down his pen and tossed his drawing over on the wonderful
heap of stuff that hid the table. "It's too dark to work." He lit
his pipe and walked about, stretching his shoulders like a man
whose labour was valuable.</p>

<p>When dusk came it saddened these youths. The solemnity of
darkness always caused them to ponder. "Light the gas, Wrinkles,"
said Grief.</p>

<p>The flood of orange light showed clearly the dull walls lined
with scratches, the tousled bed in one corner, the mass of boxes
and trunks in another, the little fierce stove, and the wonderful
table. Moreover, there were some wine-coloured draperies flung in
some places, and on a shelf, high up, there was a plaster cast dark
with dust in the creases. A long stove-pipe wandered off in the
wrong direction, and then twined impulsively toward a hole in the
wall. There were some extensive cobwebs on the ceilings.</p>

<p>"Well, let's eat," said Grief.</p>

<p>Later, there came a sad knock at the door. Wrinkles, arranging a
tin pail on the stove, little Pennoyer busy at slicing the bread,
and Great Grief affixing the rubber tube to the gas stove, yelled:
"Come in!"</p>

<p>The door opened and Corinson entered dejectedly. His overcoat
was very new. Wrinkles flashed an envious glance at it, but almost
immediately he cried: "Hello, Corrie, old boy!"</p>

<p>Corinson sat down and felt around among the pipes until he found
a good one. Great Grief had fixed the coffee to boil on the gas
stove, but he had to watch it closely, for the rubber tube was
short, and a chair was balanced on a trunk, and then the gas stove
was balanced on the chair. Coffee making was a feat.</p>

<p>"Well," said Grief, with his back turned, "how goes it, Corrie?
How's Art, hey?" He fastened a terrible emphasis upon the word.</p>

<p>"Crayon portraits," said Corinson.</p>

<p>"What?" They turned towards him with one movement, as if from a
lever connection. Little Pennoyer dropped his knife.</p>

<p>"Crayon portraits," repeated Corinson. He smoked away in
profound cynicism. "Fifteen dollars a week or more this time of
year, you know." He smiled at them like a man of courage.</p>

<p>Little Pennoyer picked up his knife again. "Well, I'll be
blowed," said Wrinkles. Feeling it incumbent upon him to think, he
dropped into a chair and began to play serenades on his guitar and
watch to see when the water for the eggs would boil. It was a
habitual pose.</p>

<p>Great Grief, however, seemed to observe something bitter in the
affair. "When did you discover that you couldn't draw?" he said
stiffly.</p>

<p>"I haven't discovered it yet," replied Corinson, with a serene
air. "I merely discovered that I would rather eat."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Grief.</p>

<p>"Hand me the eggs, Grief," said Wrinkles. "The water's
boiling."</p>

<p>Little Pennoyer burst into the conversation. "We'd ask you to
dinner, Corrie, but there's only three of us and there's two eggs.
I dropped a piece of bread on the floor, too. I'd shy one."</p>

<p>"That's all right, Penny," said the other; "don't trouble
yourself. You artists should never be hospitable. I'm going anyway.
I've got to make a call. Well, good night, boys. I've got to make a
call. Drop in and see me."</p>

<p>When the door closed upon him, Grief said: "The coffee's done; I
hate that fellow. That overcoat cost thirty dollars, if it cost a
red. His egotism is so tranquil. It isn't like yours, Wrinkles.
He&mdash;"</p>

<p>The door opened again and Corinson thrust in his head. "Say, you
fellows, you know it's Thanksgiving to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Well, what of it?" demanded Grief.</p>

<p>Little Pennoyer said: "Yes, I know it is, Corrie, I thought of
it this morning."</p>

<p>"Well, come out and have a table d'hote with me to-morrow night.
I'll blow you off in good style."</p>

<p>While Wrinkles played an exuberant air on his guitar, little
Pennoyer did part of a ballet. They cried ecstatically: "Will we?
Well, I guess yes?"</p>

<p>When they were alone again, Grief said: "I'm not going, anyhow.
I hate that fellow."</p>

<p>"Oh, fiddle," said Wrinkles. "You're an infernal crank. And
besides, where's your dinner coming from to-morrow night if you
don't go? Tell me that."</p>

<p>Little Pennoyer said: "Yes, that's so, Grief. Where's your
dinner coming from if you don't go?"</p>

<p>Grief said: "Well, I hate him, anyhow."</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p class="cp"><b>As to Payment of the Rent</b>
</p>

<p>Little Pennoyer's four dollars could not last for ever. When he
received it he and Wrinkles and Great Grief went to a table d'hote.
Afterwards little Pennoyer discovered that only two dollars and a
half remained. A small magazine away down town had accepted one out
of the six drawings that he had taken them, and later had given him
four dollars for it. Penny was so disheartened when he saw that his
money was not going to last for ever, that even with two dollars
and a half in his pockets, he felt much worse than when he was
penniless, for at that time he anticipated twenty-four. Wrinkles
lectured upon "Finance."</p>

<p>Great Grief said nothing, for it was established that when he
received six dollar cheques from comic weeklies he dreamed of
renting studios at seventy-five dollars per month, and was likely
to go out and buy five dollars' worth of second-hand curtains and
plaster casts.</p>

<p>When he had money Penny always hated the cluttered den in the
old building. He desired to go out and breathe boastfully like a
man. But he obeyed Wrinkles, the elder and the wise, and if you had
visited that room about ten o'clock of a morning or about seven of
an evening you would have thought that rye bread, frankfurters, and
potato salad from Second Avenue were the only foods in the
world.</p>

<p>Purple Sanderson lived there too, but then he really ate. He had
learned parts of the gasfitter's trade before he came to be such a
great artist, and when his opinions disagreed with that of every
art manager in New York, he went to see a plumber, a friend of his,
for whose opinion he had a great respect. In consequence, he
frequented a very great restaurant on Twenty-third Street, and
sometimes on Saturday nights he openly scorned his companions.</p>

<p>Purple was a good fellow, Grief said, but one of his singularly
bad traits was that he always remembered everything. One night, not
long after little Pennoyer's great discovery, Purple came in, and
as he was neatly hanging up his coat, said: "Well, the rent will be
due in four days."</p>

<p>"Will it?" demanded Penny, astounded. Penny was always astounded
when the rent came due. It seemed to him the most extraordinary
occurrence.</p>

<p>"Certainly it will," said Purple, with the irritated air of a
superior financial man.</p>

<p>"My soul!" said Wrinkles.</p>

<p>Great Grief lay on the bed smoking a pipe and waiting for fame.
"Oh, go home, Purple. You resent something. It wasn't me, it was
the calendar."</p>

<p>"Try and be serious a moment, Grief."</p>

<p>"You're a fool, Purple."</p>

<p>Penny spoke from where he was at work. "Well, if those
<i>Amazement Magazine</i> people pay me when they said they would
I'll have money then."</p>

<p>"So you will, dear," said Grief, satirically. "You'll have money
to burn. Did the <i>Amazement</i> people ever pay you when they
said they would? You're wonderfully important all of a sudden, it
seems to me. You talk like an artist."</p>

<p>Wrinkles, too, smiled at little Pennoyer. "The <i>Established
Magazine</i> people wanted Penny to hire models and make a try for
them too. It will only cost him a big blue chip. By the time he has
invested all the money he hasn't got and the rent is two weeks'
overdue, he will be able to tell the landlord to wait seven months
until the Monday morning after the publication. Go ahead,
Penny."</p>

<p>It was the habit to make game of little Pennoyer. He was always
having gorgeous opportunities, with no opportunity to take
advantage of his opportunities.</p>

<p>Penny smiled at them, his tiny, tiny smile of courage.</p>

<p>"You're a confident little cuss," observed Grief,
irrelevantly.</p>

<p>"Well, the world has no objection to your being confident also,
Grief," said Purple.</p>

<p>"Hasn't it?" said Grief. "Well, I want to know."</p>

<p>Wrinkles could not be light-spirited long. He was obliged to
despair when occasion offered. At last he sank down in a chair and
seized his guitar.</p>

<p>"Well, what's to be done?" he said. He began to play
mournfully.</p>

<p>"Throw Purple out," mumbled Grief from the bed.</p>

<p>"Are you fairly certain that you will have money then, Penny?"
asked Purple.</p>

<p>Little Pennoyer looked apprehensive. "Well, I don't know," he
said.</p>

<p>And then began that memorable discussion, great in four minds.
The tobacco was of the "Long John" brand. It smelled like burning
mummies.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>A Dinner on Sunday Evening</b>
</p>

<p>Once Purple Sanderson went to his home in St. Lawrence county to
enjoy some country air, and, incidentally, to explain his life
failure to his people. Previously, Great Grief had given him odds
that he would return sooner than he had planned, and everybody said
that Grief had a good bet. It is not a glorious pastime, this
explaining of life failures.</p>

<p>Later, Great Grief and Wrinkles went to Haverstraw to visit
Grief's cousin and sketch. Little Pennoyer was disheartened, for it
is bad to be imprisoned in brick and dust and cobbles when your ear
can hear in the distance the harmony of the summer sunlight upon
leaf and blade of green. Besides, he did not hear Wrinkles and
Grief discoursing and quarrelling in the den, and Purple coming in
at six o'clock with contempt.</p>

<p>On Friday afternoon he discovered that he only had fifty cents
to last until Saturday morning, when he was to get his cheque from
the <i>Gamin</i>. He was an artful little man by this time,
however, and it is as true as the sky that when he walked toward
the <i>Gamin</i> office on Saturday he had twenty cents
remaining.</p>

<p>The cashier nodded his regrets, "Very sorry,
Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Pennoyer, but our pay-day, you know, is on
Monday. Come around any time after ten."</p>

<p>"Oh, it don't matter," said Penny. As he walked along on his
return he reflected deeply how he could invest his twenty cents in
food to last until Monday morning any time after ten. He bought two
coffee cakes in a third avenue bakery. They were very beautiful.
Each had a hole in the centre, and a handsome scallop all around
the edges.</p>

<p>Penny took great care of those cakes. At odd times he would rise
from his work and go to see that no escape had been made. On Sunday
he got up at noon and compressed breakfast and noon into one meal.
Afterwards he had almost three-quarters of a cake still left to
him. He congratulated himself that with strategy he could make it
endure until Monday morning any time after ten.</p>

<p>At three in the afternoon there came a faint-hearted knock.
"Come in," said Penny. The door opened and old Tim Connegan, who
was trying to be a model, looked in apprehensively. "I beg pardon,
sir," he said at once.</p>

<p>"Come in, Tim, you old thief," said Penny. Tim entered slowly
and bashfully. "Sit down," said Penny. Tim sat down and began to
rub his knees, for rheumatism had a mighty hold upon him.</p>

<p>Penny lit his pipe and crossed his legs. "Well, how goes
it?"</p>

<p>Tim moved his square jaw upward and flashed Penny a little
glance.</p>

<p>"Bad?" said Penny.</p>

<p>The old man raised his hand impressively. "I've been to every
studio in the hull city, and I never see such absences in my life.
What with the seashore and the mountains, and this and that resort,
I think all the models will be starved by fall. I found one man in
up on Fifty-seventh Street. He ses to me: 'Come around
Tuesday&mdash;I may want yez and I may not.' That was last week.
You know, I live down on the Bowery, Mr. Pennoyer, and when I got
up there on Tuesday, he ses: 'Confound you, are you here again?'
ses he. I went and sat down in the park, for I was too tired for
the walk back. And there you are, Mr. Pennoyer. What with trampin'
around to look for men that are thousand miles away, I'm near
dead."</p>

<p>"It's hard," said Penny.</p>

<p>"It is, sir. I hope they'll come back soon. The summer is the
death of us all, sir; it is. Sure, I never know where my next meal
is coming until I get it. That's true."</p>

<p>"Had anything to-day?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, a little."</p>

<p>"How much?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, a lady gave me a cup of coffee this morning. It was
good, too, I'm telling you."</p>

<p>Penny went to his cupboard. When he returned, he said: "Here's
some cake."</p>

<p>Tim thrust forward his hands, palms erect. "Oh, now, Mr.
Pennoyer, I couldn't. You&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go ahead. What's the odds?"</p>

<p>"Oh, now."</p>

<p>"Go ahead, you old bat."</p>

<p>Penny smoked.</p>

<p>When Tim was going out, he turned to grow eloquent again. "Well,
I can't tell you how much I'm obliged to you, Mr. Pennoyer.
You&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't mention it, old man."</p>

<p>Penny smoked.</p>

<h3><a name="ch5-2" id="ch5-2"></a>The Silver Pageant</h3>

<p>"It's rotten," said Grief.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's fair, old man. Still, I would not call it a great
contribution to American art," said Wrinkles.</p>

<p>"You've got a good thing, Gaunt, if you go at it right," said
little Pennoyer.</p>

<p>These were all volunteer orations. The boys had come in one by
one and spoken their opinions. Gaunt listened to them no more than
if they had been so many match-peddlers. He never heard anything
close at hand, and he never saw anything excepting that which
transpired across a mystic wide sea. The shadow of his thoughts was
in his eyes, a little grey mist, and, when what you said to him had
passed out of your mind, he asked: "Wha&mdash;a&mdash;at?" It was
understood that Gaunt was very good to tolerate the presence of the
universe, which was noisy and interested in itself. All the younger
men, moved by an instinct of faith, declared that he would one day
be a great artist if he would only move faster than a pyramid. In
the meantime he did not hear their voices. Occasionally when he saw
a man take vivid pleasure in life, he faintly evinced an
admiration. It seemed to strike him as a feat. As for him, he was
watching that silver pageant across a sea.</p>

<p>When he came from Paris to New York somebody told him that he
must make his living. He went to see some book publishers, and
talked to them in his manner&mdash;as if he had just been stunned.
At last one of them gave him drawings to do, and it did not
surprise him. It was merely as if rain had come down.</p>

<p>Great Grief went to see him in his studio, and returned to the
den to say: "Gaunt is working in his sleep. Somebody ought to set
fire to him."</p>

<p>It was then that the others went over and smoked, and gave their
opinions of a drawing. Wrinkles said: "Are you really looking at
it, Gaunt? I don't think you've seen it yet, Gaunt?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Why don't you look at it?"</p>

<p>When Wrinkles departed, the model, who was resting at that time,
followed him into the hall and waved his arms in rage. "That
feller's crazy. Yeh ought t' see&mdash;" and he recited lists of
all the wrongs that can come to models.</p>

<p>It was a superstitious little band over in the den. They talked
often of Gaunt. "He's got pictures in his eyes," said Wrinkles.
They had expected genius to blindly stumble at the perface and
ceremonies of the world, and each new flounder by Gaunt made a stir
in the den. It awed them, and they waited.</p>

<p>At last one morning Gaunt burst into the room. They were all as
dead men.</p>

<p>"I'm going to paint a picture." The mist in his eyes was pierced
by a Coverian gleam. His gestures were wild and extravagant. Grief
stretched out smoking on the bed, Wrinkles and little Pennoyer
working at their drawing-boards tilted against the table&mdash;were
suddenly frozen. If bronze statues had come and danced heavily
before them, they could not have been thrilled further.</p>

<p>Gaunt tried to tell them of something, but it became knotted in
his throat, and then suddenly he dashed out again.</p>

<p>Later they went earnestly over to Gaunt's studio. Perhaps he
would tell them of what he saw across the sea.</p>

<p>He lay dead upon the floor. There was a little grey mist before
his eyes.</p>

<p>When they finally arrived home that night they took a long time
to undress for bed, and then came the moment when they waited for
some one to put out the gas. Grief said at last, with the air of a
man whose brain is desperately driven: "I wonder&mdash;I&mdash;what
do you suppose he was going to paint?"</p>

<p>Wrinkles reached and turned out the gas, and from the sudden
profound darkness, he said: "There is a mistake. He couldn't have
had pictures in his eyes."</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch5-3" id="ch5-3"></a>A Street Scene in New York</h3>

<p>The man and the boy conversed in Italian, mumbling the soft
syllables and making little, quick egotistical gestures. Suddenly
the man glared and wavered on his limbs for a moment as if some
blinding light had flashed before his vision; then he swayed like a
drunken man and fell. The boy grasped his arm convulsively, and
made an attempt to support his companion so that the body slid to
the side-walk with an easy motion like a corpse sinking into the
sea. The boy screamed.</p>

<p>Instantly people from all directions turned their gaze upon that
figure prone upon the side-walk. In a moment there was a dodging,
peering, pushing crowd about the man. A volley of questions,
replies, speculations flew to and fro among all the bobbing
heads.</p>

<p>"What's th' matter? what's th' matter?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a jag, I guess!"</p>

<p>"Aw, he's got a fit!"</p>

<p>"What's th' matter? what's th' matter?"</p>

<p>Two streams of people coming from different directions met at
this point to form a great crowd. Others came from across the
street.</p>

<p>Down under their feet, almost lost under this mass of people,
lay a man, hidden in the shadows caused by their forms, which, in
fact, barely allowed a particle of light to pass between them.
Those in the foremost rank bended down eagerly, anxious to see
everything. Others behind them crowded savagely like starving men
fighting for bread. Always, the question could be heard flying in
the air. "What's th' matter." Some, near to the body, and perhaps
feeling the danger of being forced over upon it, twisted their
heads and protested violently to those unheeding ones who were
scuffling in the rear: "Say, quit yer shovin', can't yeh? What do
yeh want, anyhow? Quit!"</p>

<p>Somebody back in the throng suddenly said: "Say, young feller,
cheese that pushin'! I ain't no peach!"</p>

<p>Another voice said: "Well, dat's all right&mdash;"</p>

<p>The boy who had been with the Italian was standing helplessly, a
frightened look in his eyes, and holding the man's hand. Sometimes
he looked about him dumbly, with indefinite hope, as if he expected
sudden assistance to come from the clouds. The men about him
frequently jostled him until he was obliged to put his hand upon
the breast of the body to maintain his balance. Those nearest the
man upon the sidewalk at first saw his body go through a singular
contortion. It was as if an invisible hand had reached up from the
earth and had seized him by the hair. He seemed dragged slowly,
pitilessly backward, while his body stiffened convulsively, his
hands clenched, and his arms swung rigidly upward. Through his
pallid, half-closed lids one could see the steel-coloured,
assassin-like gleam of his eye, that shone with a mystic light as a
corpse might glare at those live ones who seemed about to trample
it under foot. As for the men near, they hung back, appearing as if
they expected it might spring erect and grab them. Their eyes,
however, were held in a spell of fascination. They scarce seemed to
breathe. They were contemplating a depth into which a human being
had sunk, and the marvel of this mystery of life or death held them
chained. Occasionally from the rear a man came thrusting his way
impetuously, satisfied that there was a horror to be seen, and
apparently insane to get a view of it. More self-contained men
swore at these persons when they tread upon their toes.</p>

<p>The street cars jingled past this scene in endless parade.
Occasionally, down where the elevated road crossed the street, one
could hear sometimes a thunder, suddenly begun and suddenly ended.
Over the heads of the crowd hung an immovable canvas sign: "Regular
Dinner twenty cents."</p>

<p>The body on the pave seemed like a bit of debris sunk in this
human ocean.</p>

<p>But after the first spasm of curiosity had passed away, there
were those in the crowd who began to bethink themselves of some way
to help. A voice called out: "Rub his wrists." The boy and a man on
the other side of the body began to rub the wrists and slap the
palms of the man. A tall German suddenly appeared, and resolutely
began to push the crowd back. "Get back there&mdash;get back," he
repeated continually while he pushed at them. He seemed to have
authority; the crowd obeyed him. He and another man knelt down by
the man in the darkness and loosened his shirt at the throat. Once
they struck a match and held it close to the man's face. This livid
visage suddenly appearing under their feet in the light of the
match's yellow glare, made the crowd shudder. Half articulate
exclamations could be heard. There were men who nearly created a
riot in the madness of their desire to see the thing.</p>

<p>Meanwhile others had been questioning the boy. "What's his name?
Where does he live?"</p>

<p>Then a policeman appeared. The first part of this little drama
had gone on without his assistance, but now he came, striding
swiftly, his helmet towering over the crowd and shading that
impenetrable police face. He charged the crowd as if he were a
squadron of Irish Lancers. The people fairly withered before this
onslaught. Occasionally he shouted: "Come, make way there. Come,
now!" He was evidently a man whose life was half-pestered out of
him by people who were sufficiently unreasonable and stupid as to
insist on walking in the streets. He felt the rage toward them that
a placid cow feels toward the flies that hover in clouds and
disturb its repose. When he arrived at the centre of the crowd he
first said, threateningly: "What's th' matter here?" And then when
he saw that human bit of wreckage at the bottom of the sea of men,
he said to it: "Come, git up out that! Git out a here!"</p>

<p>Whereupon hands were raised in the crowd and a volley of
decorated information was blazed at the officer.</p>

<p>"Ah, he's got a fit, can't yeh see?"</p>

<p>"He's got a fit!"</p>

<p>"What th'ell yeh doin'? Leave 'im be!"</p>

<p>The policeman menaced with a glance the crowd from whose safe
precincts the defiant voices had emerged.</p>

<p>A doctor had come. He and the policeman bended down at the man's
side. Occasionally the officer reared up to create room. The crowd
fell away before his admonitions, his threats, his sarcastic
questions, and before the sweep of those two huge buckskin
gloves.</p>

<p>At last the peering ones saw the man on the side-walk begin to
breathe heavily, strainedly, as if he had just come to the surface
from some deep water. He uttered a low cry in his foreign way. It
was like a baby's squeal or the side wail of a little storm-tossed
kitten. As this cry went forth to all those eager ears the
jostling, crowding recommenced again furiously, until the doctor
was obliged to yell warningly a dozen times. The policeman had gone
to send the ambulance call.</p>

<p>Then a man struck another match, and in its meagre light the
doctor felt the skull of the prostrate man carefully to discover if
any wound had been caused by his fall to the stone side-walk. The
crowd pressed and crushed again. It was as if they fully expected
to see blood by the light of the match, and the desire made them
appear almost insane. The policeman returned and fought with them.
The doctor looked up occasionally to scold and demand room.</p>

<p>At last, out of the faint haze of light far up the street, there
came the sound of a gong beating rapidly. A monstrous truck loaded
to the sky with barrels scurried to one side with marvellous
agility. And then the black waggon, with its gleam of gold
lettering and bright brass gong, clattered into view, the horse
galloping. A young man, as imperturbable almost as if he were at a
picnic, sat upon the rear seat. When they picked up the limp body,
from which came little moans and howls, the crowd almost turned
into a mob. When the ambulance started on its banging and clanging
return, they stood and gazed until it was quite out of sight. Some
resumed their way with an air of relief. Others still continued to
stare after the vanished ambulance and its burden as if they had
been cheated, as if the curtain had been rung down on a tragedy
that was but half completed; and this impenetrable blanket
intervening between a sufferer and their curiosity seemed to make
them feel an injustice.</p>

<h3><a name="ch5-4" id="ch5-4"></a>Minetta Lane, New York</h3>

<p class="cp">Its Worst Days have Now Passed Away. But its
Inhabitants Still Include Many whose Deeds are Evil.<br>
<br>
The Celebrated Resort of Mammy Ross.</p>

<p>Minetta Lane is a small and becobbled valley between hills and
dingy brick. At night the street lamps, burning dimly, cause the
shadows to be important, and in the gloom one sees groups of
quietly conversant negroes, with occasionally the gleam of a
passing growler. Everything is vaguely outlined and of uncertain
identity, unless, indeed, it be the flashing buttons and shield of
the policeman on his coast. The Sixth Avenue horse-cars jingle past
one end of the lane, and a block eastward the little thoroughfare
ends in the darkness of M'Dougall Street.</p>

<p>One wonders how such an insignificant alley could get such an
assuredly large reputation, but, as a matter of fact, Minetta Lane
and Minetta Street, which leads from it southward to Bleecker
Street, were, until a few years ago, two of the most
enthusiastically murderous thoroughfares in New York. Bleecker
Street, M'Dougall Street, and nearly all the streets thereabouts
were most unmistakably bad; the other streets went away and hid. To
gain a reputation in Minetta Lane in those days a man was obliged
to commit a number of furious crimes, and no celebrity was more
important than the man who had a good honest killing to his credit.
The inhabitants, for the most part, were negroes, and they
represented the very worst element of their race. The razor habit
clung to them with the tenacity of an epidemic, and every night the
uneven cobbles felt blood. Minetta Lane was not a public
thoroughfare at this period. It was a street set apart, a refuge
for criminals. Thieves came here preferably with their gains, and
almost any day peculiar sentences passed among the inhabitants.
"Big Jim turned a thousand last night." "No-Toe's made another
haul." And the worshipful citizens would make haste to be present
at the consequent revel.</p>

<p>As has been said, Minetta Lane was then no thoroughfare. A
peaceable citizen chose to make a circuit rather than venture
through this place, that swarmed with the most dangerous people in
the city. Indeed, the thieves of the district used to say: "Once
get in the lane and you're all right." Even a policeman in chase of
a criminal would probably shy away instead of pursuing him into the
lane. The odds were too great against a lone officer.</p>

<p>Sailors, and any men who might appear to have money about them,
were welcomed with all proper ceremony at the terrible dens of the
lane. At departure they were fortunate if they still retained their
teeth. It was the custom to leave very little else to them. There
was every facility for the capture of coin, from trap-doors to
plain ordinary knock-out drops.</p>

<p>And yet Minetta Lane is built on the grave of Minetta Brook,
where, in olden times, lovers walked under the willows on the bank,
and Minetta Lane, in later times, was the home of many of the best
families of the town.</p>

<p>A negro named Bloodthirsty was perhaps the most luminous figure
of Minetta Lane's aggregation of desperadoes. Bloodthirsty
supposedly is alive now, but he has vanished from the lane. The
police want him for murder. Bloodthirsty is a large negro, and very
hideous. He has a rolling eye that shows white at the wrong time,
and his neck, under the jaw, is dreadfully scarred and pitted.</p>

<p>Bloodthirsty was particularly eloquent when drunk, and in the
wildness of a spree he would rave so graphically about gore that
even the habitated wool of old timers would stand straight.</p>

<p>Bloodthirsty meant most of it, too. That is why his orations
were impressive. His remarks were usually followed by the wide,
lightning sweep of his razor. None cared to exchange epithets with
Bloodthirsty. A man in a boiler iron suit would walk down to City
Hall and look at the clock before he would ask the time of day from
the single-minded and ingenuous Bloodthirsty.</p>

<p>After Bloodthirsty, in combative importance, came No-Toe
Charley. Singularly enough, Charley was called No-Toe Charley
because he did not have a toe on his feet. Charley was a small
negro, and his manner of amusement befitting a smaller man. Charley
was more wise, more sly, more round-about than the other man. The
path of his crimes was like a corkscrew in architecture, and his
method led him to make many tunnels. With all his cleverness,
however, No-Toe was finally induced to pay a visit to the gentlemen
in the grim, grey building up the river&mdash;Sing Sing.</p>

<p>Black-Cat was another famous bandit who made the land his home.
Black-Cat is dead. Jube Tyler has been sent to prison, and after
mentioning the recent disappearance of Old Man Spriggs it may be
said that the lane is now destitute of the men who once crowned it
with a glory of crime. It is hardly essential to mention Guinea
Johnson.</p>

<p>Guinea is not a great figure. Guinea is just an ordinary little
crook. Sometimes Guinea pays a visit to his friends, the other
little crooks who make homes in the lane, but he himself does not
live there, and with him out of it there is now no one whose
industry's unlawfulness has yet earned him the dignity of a
nickname. Indeed, it is difficult to find people now who remember
the old gorgeous days, although it is but two years since the lane
shone with sin like a new head-light. But after a search the
reporter found three.</p>

<p>Mammy Ross is one of the last relics of the days of slaughter
still living there. Her weird history also reaches back to the
blossoming of the first members of the Whyo gang in the Old Sixth
Ward, and her mind is stored with bloody memories. She at one time
kept a sailors' boarding-house near the Tombs prison, and the
accounts of all the festive crimes of that neighbourhood in ancient
years roll easily from her tongue. They killed a sailor man every
day, and pedestrians went about the streets wearing stoves for fear
of the handy knives. At the present day the route to Mammy's home
is up a flight of grimy stairs that are pasted on the outside of an
old and tottering frame house. Then there is a hall blacker than a
wolf's throat, and this hall leads to a little kitchen where Mammy
usually sits groaning by the fire. She is, of course, very old, and
she is also very fat. She seems always to be in great pain. She
says she is suffering from "de very las' dregs of de yaller
fever."</p>

<p>During the first part of a reporter's recent visit, old Mammy
seemed most dolefully oppressed by her various diseases. Her great
body shook and her teeth clicked spasmodically during her long and
painful respirations. From time to time she reached her trembling
hand and drew a shawl closer about her shoulders. She presented as
true a picture of a person undergoing steady, unchangeable, chronic
pain as a patent medicine firm could wish to discover for
miraculous purposes. She breathed like a fish thrown out on the
bank, and her old head continually quivered in the nervous tremors
of the extremely aged and debilitated person. Meanwhile her
daughter hung over the stove and placidly cooked sausages.</p>

<p>Appeals were made to the old woman's memory. Various personages
who had been sublime figures of crime in the long-gone days were
mentioned to her, and presently her eyes began to brighten. Her
head no longer quivered. She seemed to lose for a period her sense
of pain in the gentle excitement caused by the invocation of the
spirits of her memory.</p>

<p>It appears that she had had a historic quarrel with Apple Mag.
She first recited the prowess of Apple Mag; how this emphatic lady
used to argue with paving stones, carving knives, and bricks. Then
she told of the quarrel; what Mag said; what she said. It seems
that they cited each other as spectacles of sin and corruption in
more fully explanatory terms than are commonly known to be
possible. But it was one of Mammy's most gorgeous recollections,
and, as she told it, a smile widened over her face.</p>

<p>Finally she explained her celebrated retort to one of the most
illustrious thugs that had blessed the city in bygone days. "Ah
says to 'im, ah says: 'You&mdash;you'll die in yer boots like
Gallopin' Thompson&mdash;dat's what you'll do. You des min' dat',
honey. Ah got o'ny one chile, an' he ain't nuthin' but er cripple;
but le'me tel' you, man, dat boy'll live t' pick de feathers f'm de
goose dat'll eat de grass dat grows over your grave, man.' Dat's
what I tol' 'm. But&mdash;law sake&mdash;how I know dat in less'n
three day, dat man be lying in de gutter wif a knife stickin' out'n
his back. Lawd, no, I sholy never s'pected noting like dat."</p>

<p>These reminiscences, at once maimed and reconstructed, have been
treasured by old Mammy as carefully, as tenderly, as if they were
the various little tokens of an early love. She applies the same
black-handed sentiment to them, and, as she sits groaning by the
fire, it is plainly to be seen that there is only one food for her
ancient brain, and that is the recollection of the beautiful fights
and murders of the past.</p>

<p>On the other side of the lane, but near Mammy's house, Pop
Babcock keeps a restaurant. Pop says it is a restaurant, and so it
must be one; but you could pass there ninety times each day and
never know you were passing a restaurant. There is one obscure
little window in the basement, and if you went close and peered in
you might, after a time, be able to make out a small, dusty sign,
lying amid jars on a dusty shelf. This sign reads: "Oysters in
every style." If you are of a gambling turn of mind, you will
probably stand out in the street and bet yourself black in the face
that there isn't an oyster within a hundred yards. But Pop Babcock
made that sign, and Pop Babcock could not tell an untruth. Pop is a
model of all the virtues which an inventive fate has made for us.
He says so.</p>

<p>As far as goes the management of Pop's restaurant, it differs
from Sherry's. In the first place, the door is always kept locked.
The wardmen of the Fifteenth precinct have a way of prowling
through the restaurant almost every night, and Pop keeps the door
locked in order to keep out the objectionable people that cause the
wardmen's visits. He says so. The cooking stove is located in the
main room of the restaurant, and it is placed in such a strategic
manner that it occupies about all the space that is not already
occupied by a table, a bench, and two chairs. The table will, on a
pinch, furnish room for the plates of two people if they are
willing to crowd. Pop says he is the best cook in the world.</p>

<p>When questioned concerning the present condition of the lane,
Pop said: "Quiet! Quiet! Lo'd save us, maybe it ain't. Quiet!
Quiet!" His emphasis was arranged crescendo, until the last word
was really a vocal explosion. "Why, dish er' lane ain't nohow like
what it uster be&mdash;no, indeed it ain't. No, sir. 'Deed it
ain't. Why, I kin remember when dey was a-cuttin' an' a-slashin'
long yere all night. 'Deed dey wos. My-my, dem times was different.
Dat der Kent, he kep' de place at Green Gate cou't down yer ol'
Mammy's&mdash;an' he was a hard baby&mdash;'deed he was&mdash;an'
ol' Black-Cat an' ol' Bloodthirsty, dey was a-comin' round yere
a-cuttin', an' a-slashin', an' a-cuttin', an' a-slashin'. Didn't
dar' say boo to a goose in dose days, dat you didn't, less'n you
lookin' fer a scrap. No, sir." Then he gave information concerning
his own prowess at that time. Pop is about as tall as a picket of
an undersized fence. "But dey didn't have nothin' ter say ter me.
No, sir, 'deed dey didn't. I would lay down fer none of 'em. No,
sir. Dey knew my gait, 'deed dey did. Man, man, many's de time I
buck up agin 'em."</p>

<p>At this time Pop had three customers in his place, one asleep on
the bench, one asleep on two chairs, and one asleep on the floor
behind the stove.</p>

<p>But there is one who lends dignity of the real bevel-edged type
to Minetta Lane, and that man is Hank Anderson. Hank, of course,
does not live in the lane, but the shadows of his social
perfections fall upon it as refreshingly as a morning dew.</p>

<p>Hank gave a dance twice in each week at a hall hard by in
M'Dougall Street, and the dusky aristocracy of the neighbourhood
know their guiding beacon. Moreover, Hank holds an annual ball in
Forty-fourth Street. Also, he gives a picnic each year to the
Montezuma Club, when he again appears as a guiding beacon. This
picnic is usually held on a barge, and the excursion is a very
joyous one. Some years ago it required the entire reserve squad of
an up-town police precinct to properly control the enthusiasm of
the gay picnickers, but that was an exceptional exuberance, and no
measure of Hank's ability for management.</p>

<p>He is really a great manager. He was Boss Tweed's body-servant
in the days when Tweed was a political prince, and any one who saw
Bill Tweed through a spy-glass learned the science of leading,
pulling, driving, and hauling men in a way to keep the men ignorant
of it. Hank imbibed from this fount of knowledge, and he applied
his information in Thompson Street. Thompson Street salaamed.
Presently he bore a proud title: "The Mayor of Thompson Street."
Dignities from the principal political organisations of the city
adorned his brow, and he speedily became illustrious.</p>

<p>Hank knew the lane well in its direful days. As for the
inhabitants, he kept clear of them, and yet in touch with them,
according to a method that he might have learned in the Sixth ward.
The Sixth ward was a good place in which to learn that trick.
Anderson can tell many strange tales and good of the lane, and he
tells them in the graphic way of his class. "Why, they could steal
your shirt without moving a wrinkle on it."</p>

<p>The killing of Joe Carey was the last murder that happened in
the Minettas. Carey had what might be called a mixed-ale difference
with a man named Kenny. They went out to the middle of Minetta
Street to affably fight it out and determine the justice of the
question.</p>

<p>In the scrimmage Kenny drew a knife, thrust quickly, and Carey
fell. Kenny had not gone a hundred feet before he ran into the arms
of a policeman.</p>

<p>There is probably no street in New York where the police keep
closer watch than they do in Minetta Lane. There was a time when
the inhabitants had a profound and reasonable contempt for the
public guardians, but they have it no longer apparently. Any
citizen can walk through there at any time in perfect safety,
unless, perhaps, he should happen to get too frivolous. To be
strictly accurate, the change began under the reign of police
Captain Chapman. Under Captain Groo, a commander of the Fifteenth
precinct, the lane donned a complete new garb. Its denizens brag
now of its peace, precisely as they once bragged of its war. It is
no more a bloody lane. The song of the razor is seldom heard. There
are still toughs and semi-toughs galore in it, but they can't get a
chance with the copper looking the other way. Groo got the poor
lane by the throat. If a man should insist upon becoming a victim
of the badger game, he could probably succeed, upon search in
Minetta Lane, as indeed, he could on any of the great avenues, but
then Minetta Lane is not supposed to be a pearly street of
Paradise.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Italians have begun to dispute the
possession of the lane with the negroes. Green Gate Court is filled
with them now, and a row of houses near the M'Dougall Street corner
is occupied entirely by Italian families. None of them seem to be
over fond of the old Mulberry Bend fashion of life, and there are
no cutting affrays among them worth mentioning. It is the original
negro element that makes the trouble when there is trouble.</p>

<p>But they are happy in this condition are these people. The most
extraordinary quality of the negro is his enormous capacity for
happiness under most adverse circumstances. Minetta Lane is a place
of poverty and sin, but these influences cannot destroy the broad
smile of the negro&mdash;a vain and simple child, but happy. They
all smile here, the most evil as well as the poorest. Knowing the
negro, one always expects laughter from him, be he ever so poor,
but it was a new experience to see a broad grin on the face of the
devil. Even old Pop Babcock had a laugh as fine and mellow as would
be the sound of falling glass, broken saints from high windows, in
the silence of some great cathedral's hollow.</p>

<h3><a name="ch5-5" id="ch5-5"></a>The Roof Gardens And Gardeners
Of New York</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>A Phase of New York Life as Seen by a Close
Observer</b>
</p>

<p>When the hot weather comes the roof gardens burst into full
bloom, and if an inhabitant of Chicago should take flight on his
wings over this city, he would observe six or eight flashing spots
in the darkness, spots as radiant as crowns. These are the roof
gardens, and if a giant had flung a handful of monstrous golden
coins upon the sombre-shadowed city he could not have benefited the
metropolis more, although he would not have given the same
opportunity to various commercial aspirants to charge a price and a
half for everything. There are two classes of men&mdash;reporters
and central office detectives&mdash;who do not mind these prices
because they are very prodigal of their money.</p>

<p>Now is the time of the girl with the copper voice, the Irishman
with circular whiskers, and the minstrel who had a reputation in
1833. To the street the noise of the band comes down on the wind in
fitful gusts, and at the brilliantly illuminated rail there is
suggestion of many straw hats.</p>

<p>One of the main features of the roof garden is the waiter, who
stands directly in front of you whenever anything interesting
transpires on the stage. This waiter is three hundred feet high and
seventy-two feet wide. His finger can block your view of the
golden-haired <i>soubrette</i>, and when he waves his arm the stage
disappears as if by a miracle. What particularly fascinates you is
his lack of self-appreciation. He doesn't know that his length over
all is three hundred feet, and that his beam is seventy-two feet.
He only knows that while the golden-haired <i>soubrette</i> is
singing her first verse he is depositing beer on the table before
some thirsty New Yorkers. He only knows that during the third verse
the thirsty New Yorkers object to the roof-garden prices. He does
not know that behind him are some fifty citizens who ordinarily
would not give three whoops to see the golden-haired
<i>soubrette</i>, but who, under these particular circumstances,
are kept from swift assassination by sheer force of the human will.
He gives an impressive exhibition of a man who is regardless of
consequences, oblivious to everything save his task, which is to
provide beer. Some day there may be a wholesale massacre of
roof-garden waiters, but they will die with astonished faces and
with questions on their lips. Skulls so steadfastly opaque defy
axes, or any of the other methods which the populace occasionally
use to cure colossal stupidity.</p>

<p>Between numbers on an ordinary roof-garden programme, the
orchestra sometimes plays what the more enlightened and wary
citizens of the town call a "beer overture." But, for reasons which
no civil service commission could give, the waiter does not choose
this time to serve the thirsty. No; he waits until the
golden-haired <i>soubrette</i> appears, he waits until the haggard
audience has goaded itself into some interest in the proceedings.
Then he gets under way. Then he comes forth and blots out the
stage. In case of war, all roof-garden waiters should be recruited
in a special regiment and sent out in advance of everything. There
is a peculiar quality of bullet-proofness about them which would
turn a projectile pale.</p>

<p>If you have strategy enough in your soul you may gain furtive
glimpses of the stage, despite the efforts of the waiters, and
then, with something to engage the attention when the attention
grows weary of the mystic wind, the flashing yellow lights, the
music, and the undertone of the far street's roar, you should be
happy.</p>

<p>Far up into the night there is a wildness, a temper to the air
which suggests tossing tree boughs and the swift rustle of grass.
The New Yorker, whose business will not allow him to go out to
nature, perhaps, appreciates these little opportunities to go up to
nature, although doubtless he thinks he goes to see the show.</p>

<p>One season two new roof gardens have opened. The one at the top
of Grand Central Palace is large enough for a regimental drill
room. The band is imprisoned still higher in a turreted affair, and
a person who prefers gentle and unobtrusive amusement can gain deep
pleasure and satisfaction from watching the leader of this band
gesticulating upon the heavens. His figure is silhouetted
beautifully against the sky, and every gesture in which he wrings
noise from his band is interestingly accentuated.</p>

<p>The other new roof garden was Oscar Hammerstein's Olympia, which
blazes on Broadway.</p>

<p>Oscar originally made a great reputation for getting out
injunctions. All court judges in New York worked overtime when
Oscar was in this business. He enjoined everybody in sight. He had
a special machine made&mdash;"Drop a nickel in the judge and get an
injunction." Then he sent a man to Washington for twenty-two
thousand dollars' worth of nickels. In Harlem, where he then lived,
it rained orders of the court every day at twelve o'clock. The
street-cleaning commission was obliged to enlist a special force to
deal with Oscar's injunctions. Citizens meeting on the street never
said: "Good morning, how do you feel to-day?" They always said:
"Good morning, have you been enjoined yet to-day?" When a man
perhaps wished to enter a little game of draw, the universal form
was changed when he sent a note to his wife: "Dear Louise, I have
received an order of the court restraining me from coming home to
dinner to-night. Yours, George."</p>

<p>But Oscar changed. He smashed his machine, girded himself, and
resolved to provide the public with amusement. And now we see this
great mind applying itself to a roof garden with the same
unflagging industry and boundless energy which had previously
expressed itself in injunctions. The Olympia, his new roof garden,
is a feat. It has an exuberance which reminds one of the Union
Depot train-shed of some western city. The steel arches of the roof
make a wide and splendid sweep, and over in the corner there are
real swans swimming in real water. The whole structure glares like
a conflagration with the countless electric lights. Oscar has
caused the execution of decorative paintings upon the walls. If he
had caused the execution of the decorative painters he would have
done better; but a man who has devoted the greater part of his life
to the propagation of injunctions is not supposed to understand
that wall decoration which appears to have been done with a nozzle
is worse than none. But if carpers say that Oscar failed in his
landscapes, none can say that he failed in his measurements of the
popular mind. The people come in swarms to the Olympia. Two
elevators are busy at conveying them to where the cool and steady
night-wind insults the straw hat; and the scene here during the
popular part of the evening is perhaps more gaudy and dazzling than
any other in New York.</p>

<p>The bicycle has attained an economic position of vast
importance. The roof garden ought to attain such a position, and it
doubtless will soon&mdash;as we give it the opportunity it
desires.</p>

<p>The Arab or the Moor probably invented the roof garden in some
long-gone centuries, and they are at this day inveterate roof
gardeners. The American, surprisingly belated&mdash;for him, has
but recently seized upon the idea, and its development here has
been only partial. The possibilities of the roof garden are still
unknown.</p>

<p>Here is a vast city in which thousands of people in summer half
stifle, cry out continually for air, fresher air. Just above their
heads is what might be called a county of unoccupied land. It is
not ridiculously small when compared with the area of New York
county itself. But it is as lonely as a desert, this region of
roofs. It is as untrodden as the corners of Arizona. Unless a man
be a roof gardener, he knows practically nothing of this land.</p>

<p>Down in the slums necessity forces a solution of problems. It
drives the people to the roofs. An evening upon a tenement roof
with the great golden march of the stars across the sky, and
Johnnie gone for a pail of beer, is not so bad if you have never
seen the mountains nor heard, to your heart, the slow, sad song of
the pines.</p>

<h3><a name="ch5-6" id="ch5-6"></a>In The Broadway Cars</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>Panorama of a Day from the Down-town Rush of the
Morning to the Uninterrupted Whirr of the Cable at Night&mdash;The
Man, and the Woman, and the Conductor</b>
</p>

<p>The cable cars come down Broadway as the waters come down at
Lodore. Years ago Father Knickerbocker had convulsions when it was
proposed to lay impious rails on his sacred thoroughfare. At the
present day the cars, by force of column and numbers, almost
dominate the great street, and the eye of even an old New Yorker is
held by these long yellow monsters which prowl intently up and
down, up and down, in a mystic search.</p>

<p>In the grey of the morning they come out of the up-town, bearing
janitors, porters, all that class which carries the keys to set
alive the great down-town. Later, they shower clerks. Later still,
they shower more clerks. And the thermometer which is attached to a
conductor's temper is steadily rising, rising, and the blissful
time arrives when everybody hangs to a strap and stands on his
neighbour's toes. Ten o'clock comes, and the Broadway cars, as well
as elevated cars, horse cars, and ferryboats innumerable, heave
sighs of relief. They have filled lower New York with a vast army
of men who will chase to and fro and amuse themselves until almost
nightfall.</p>

<p>The cable car's pulse drops to normal. But the conductor's pulse
begins now to beat in split seconds. He has come to the crisis in
his day's agony. He is now to be overwhelmed with feminine
shoppers. They all are going to give him two-dollar bills to
change. They all are going to threaten to report him. He passes his
hand across his brow and curses his beard from black to grey and
from grey to black.</p>

<p>Men and women have different ways of hailing a car. A
man&mdash;if he is not an old choleric gentleman, who owns not this
road but some other road&mdash;throws up a timid finger, and
appears to believe that the King of Abyssinia is careering past on
his war-chariot, and only his opinion of other people's Americanism
keeps him from deep salaams. The gripman usually jerks his thumb
over his shoulder and indicates the next car, which is three miles
away. Then the man catches the last platform, goes into the car,
climbs upon some one's toes, opens his morning paper, and is
happy.</p>

<p>When a woman hails a car there is no question of its being the
King of Abyssinia's war-chariot. She has bought the car for three
dollars and ninety-eight cents. The conductor owes his position to
her, and the gripman's mother does her laundry. No captain in the
Royal Horse Artillery ever stops his battery from going through a
stone house in a way to equal her manner of bringing that car back
on its haunches. Then she walks leisurely forward, and after
scanning the step to see if there is any mud upon it, and opening
her pocket-book to make sure of a two-dollar bill, she says: "Do
you give transfers down Twenty-eighth Street?"</p>

<p>Some time the conductor breaks the bell strap when he pulls it
under these conditions. Then, as the car goes on, he goes and
bullies some person who had nothing to do with the affair.</p>

<p>The car sweeps on its diagonal path through the Tenderloin with
its hotels, its theatres, its flower shops, its 10,000,000 actors
who played with Booth and Barret. It passes Madison Square and
enters the gorge made by the towering walls of great shops. It
sweeps around the double curve at Union Square and Fourteenth
Street, and a life insurance agent falls in a fit as the car dashes
over the crossing, narrowly missing three old ladies, two old
gentlemen, a newly-married couple, a sandwich man, a newsboy, and a
dog. At Grace Church the conductor has an altercation with a brave
and reckless passenger who beards him in his own car, and at Canal
Street he takes dire vengeance by tumbling a drunken man on to the
pavement. Meanwhile, the gripman has become involved with countless
truck drivers, and inch by inch, foot by foot, he fights his way to
City Hall Park. On past the Post Office the car goes, with the
gripman getting advice, admonition, personal comment, an invitation
to fight from the drivers, until Battery Park appears at the foot
of the slope, and as the car goes sedately around the curve the
burnished shield of the bay shines through the trees.</p>

<p>It is a great ride, full of exciting actions. Those
inexperienced persons who have been merely chased by Indians know
little of the dramatic quality which life may hold for them. These
jungle of men and vehicles, these caons of streets, these lofty
mountains of iron and cut stone&mdash;a ride through them affords
plenty of excitement. And no lone panther's howl is more serious in
intention than the howl of the truck driver when the cable car
bumps one of his rear wheels.</p>

<p>Owing to a strange humour of the gods that make our comfort,
sailor hats with wide brims come into vogue whenever we are all
engaged in hanging to cable-car straps. There is only one more
serious combination known to science, but a trial of it is at this
day impossible. If a troupe of Elizabethan courtiers in large ruffs
should board a cable car, the complication would be a very awesome
one, and the profanity would be in old English, but very inspiring.
However, the combination of wide-brimmed hats and crowded cable
cars is tremendous in its power to cause misery to the patient New
York public.</p>

<p>Suppose you are in a cable car, clutching for life and family a
creaking strap from overhead. At your shoulder is a little dude in
a very wide-brimmed straw hat with a red band. If you were in your
senses you would recognise this flaming band as an omen of blood.
But you are not in your senses; you are in a Broadway cable car.
You are not supposed to have any senses. From the forward end you
hear the gripman uttering shrill whoops and running over citizens.
Suddenly the car comes to a curve. Making a swift running start, it
turns three hand-springs, throws a cart wheel for luck, bounds into
the air, hurls six passengers over the nearest building, and comes
down a-straddle of the track. That is the way in which we turn
curves in New York.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, during the car's gamboling, the corrugated rim of the
dude's hat has swept naturally across your neck, and has left
nothing for your head to do but to quit your shoulders. As the car
roars your head falls into the waiting arms of the proper
authorities. The dude is dead; everything is dead. The interior of
the car resembles the scene of the battle of Wounded Knee, but this
gives you small satisfaction.</p>

<p>There was once a person possessing a fund of uncanny humour who
greatly desired to import from past ages a corps of knights in full
armour. He then purposed to pack the warriors into a cable car and
send them around a curve. He thought that he could gain much
pleasure by standing near and listening to the wild clash of steel
upon steel&mdash;the tumult of mailed heads striking together, the
bitter grind of armoured legs bending the wrong way. He thought
that this would teach them that war is grim.</p>

<p>Towards evening, when the tides of travel set northward, it is
curious to see how the gripman and conductor reverse their tempers.
Their dispositions flop over like patent signals. During the
down-trip they had in mind always the advantages of being at
Battery Park. A perpetual picture of the blessings of Battery Park
was before them, and every delay made them fume&mdash;made this
picture all the more alluring. Now the delights of up-town appear
to them. They have reversed the signs on the cars; they have
reversed their aspirations. Battery Park has been gained and
forgotten. There is a new goal. Here is a perpetual illustration
which the philosophers of New York may use.</p>

<p>In the Tenderloin, the place of theatres, and of the restaurant
where gayer New York does her dining, the cable cars in the evening
carry a stratum of society which looks like a new one, but it is of
the familiar strata in other clothes. It is just as good as a new
stratum, however, for in evening dress the average man feels that
he has gone up three pegs in the social scale, and there is
considerable evening dress about a Broadway car in the evening. A
car with its electric lamp resembles a brilliantly-lighted salon,
and the atmosphere grows just a trifle strained. People sit more
rigidly, and glance sidewise, perhaps, as if each was positive of
possessing social value, but was doubtful of all others. The
conductor says: "Ah, gwan. Git off th' earth." But this is to a man
at Canal Street. That shows his versatility. He stands on the
platform and beams in a modest and polite manner into the car. He
notes a lifted finger and grabs swiftly for the bell strap. He
reaches down to help a woman aboard. Perhaps his demeanour is a
reflection of the manner of the people in the car. No one is in a
mad New York hurry; no one is fretting and muttering; no one is
perched upon his neighbour's toes. Moreover, the Tenderloin is a
glory at night. Broadway of late years has fallen heir to countless
signs illuminated with red, blue, green, and gold electric lamps,
and the people certainly fly to these as the moths go to a candle.
And perhaps the gods have allowed this opportunity to observe and
study the best-dressed crowds in the world to operate upon the
conductor until his mood is to treat us with care and mildness.</p>

<p>Late at night, after the diners and theatre-goers have been lost
in Harlem, various inebriate persons may perchance emerge from the
darker regions of Sixth Avenue and swing their arms solemnly at the
gripman. If the Broadway cars run for the next 7000 years this will
be the only time when one New Yorker will address another in public
without an excuse sent direct from heaven. In these cars late at
night it is not impossible that some fearless drunkard will attempt
to inaugurate a general conversation. He is quite willing to devote
his ability to the affair. He tells of the fun he thinks he has
had; describes his feelings; recounts stories of his dim past. None
reply, although all listen with every ear. The rake probably ends
by borrowing a match, lighting a cigar, and entering into a wrangle
with the conductor with an <i>abandon</i>, a ferocity, and a
courage that do not come to us when we are sober.</p>

<p>In the meantime the figures on the street grow fewer and fewer.
Strolling policemen test the locks of the great dark-fronted
stores. Nighthawk cabs whirl by the cars on their mysterious
errands. Finally the cars themselves depart in the way of the
citizen, and for the few hours before dawn a new sound comes into
the still thoroughfare&mdash;the cable whirring in its channel
underground.</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>THE ASSASSIN IN MODERN BATTLES</h2>

<hr>

<h3>The Torpedo Boat Destroyers that "Perform in the Darkness. An
Act which is more Peculiarly Murderous than most Things in
War."</h3>

<p>In the past century the gallant aristocracy of London liked to
travel down the south bank of the Thames to Greenwich Hospital,
where venerable pensioners of the crown were ready to hire
telescopes at a penny each, and with these telescopes the lords and
ladies were able to view at a better advantage the dried and
enchained corpses of pirates hanging from the gibbets on the Isle
of Dogs. In those times the dismal marsh was inhabited solely by
the clanking figures whose feet moved in the wind like rather
poorly-constructed weather cocks.</p>

<p>But even the Isle of Dogs could not escape the appetite of an
expanding London. Thousands of souls now live on it, and it has
changed its character from that of a place of execution, with mist,
wet with fever, coiling forever from the mire and wandering among
the black gibbets, to that of an ordinary, squalid, nauseating slum
of London, whose streets bear a faint resemblance to that part of
Avenue A which lies directly above Sixtieth Street in New York.</p>

<p>Down near the water front one finds a long brick building,
three-storeyed and signless, which shuts off all view of the river.
The windows, as well as the bricks, are very dirty, and you see no
sign of life, unless some smudged workman dodges in through a
little door. The place might be a factory for the making of lamps
or stair rods, or any ordinary commercial thing. As a matter of
fact, the building fronts the shipyard of Yarrow, the builder of
torpedo boats, the maker of knives for the nations, the man who
provides everybody with a certain kind of efficient weapon. One
then remembers that if Russia fights England, Yarrow meets Yarrow;
if Germany fights France, Yarrow meets Yarrow; if Chili fights
Argentina, Yarrow meets Yarrow.</p>

<p>Besides the above-mentioned countries Yarrow has built torpedo
boats for Italy, Austria, Holland, Japan, China, Ecuador, Brazil,
Costa Rica, and Spain. There is a keeper of a great shop in London
who is known as the Universal Provider. If a general conflagration
of war should break out in the world, Yarrow would be known as one
of the Universal Warriors, for it would practically be a battle
between Yarrow, Armstrong, Krupp, and a few other firms. This is
what makes interesting the dinginess of the cantonment on the Isle
of Dogs.</p>

<p>The great Yarrow forte is to build speedy steamers of a tonnage
of not more than 240 tons. This practically includes only yachts,
launches, tugs, torpedo boat destroyers, torpedo boats, and of late
shallow-draught gunboats for service on the Nile, Congo, and Niger.
Some of the gunboats that shelled the dervishes from the banks of
the Nile below Khartoum were built by Yarrow. Yarrow is always in
action somewhere. Even if the firm's boats do not appear in every
coming sea combat, the ideas of the firm will, for many nations,
notably France and Germany, have bought specimens of the best
models of Yarrow construction in order to reduplicate and
reduplicate them in their own yards.</p>

<p>When the great fever to possess torpedo boats came upon the
Powers of Europe, England was at first left far in the rear. Either
Germany or France to-day has in her fleet more torpedo boats than
has England. The British tar is a hard man to oust out of a habit.
He had a habit of thinking that his battleships and cruisers were
the final thing in naval construction. He scoffed at the advent of
the torpedo boat. He did not scoff intelligently but because,
mainly, he hated to be forced to change his ways.</p>

<p>You will usually find an Englishman balking and kicking at
innovation up to the last moment. It takes him some years to get an
idea into his head, and when finally it is inserted, he not only
respects it, he reveres it. The Londoners have a fire brigade which
would interest the ghost of a Babylonian, as an example of how much
the method of extinguishing fires could degenerate in two thousand
years, and in 1897, when a terrible fire devastated a part of the
city, some voices were raised challenging the efficiency of the
fire brigade. But that part of the London County Council which
corresponds to fire commissioners in United States laid their hands
upon their hearts and solemnly assured the public that they had
investigated the matter, and had found the London fire brigade to
be as good as any in the world. There were some isolated cases of
dissent, but the great English public as a whole placidly accepted
these assurances concerning the activity of the honoured corps.</p>

<p>For a long time England blundered in the same way over the
matter of torpedo boats. They were authoritatively informed that
there was nothing in all the talk about torpedo boats. Then came a
great popular uproar, in which people tumbled over each other to
get to the doors of the Admiralty and howl about torpedo boats. It
was an awakening as unreasonable as had been the previous
indifference and contempt. Then England began to build. She has
never overtaken France or Germany in the number of torpedo boats,
but she now heads the world with her collection of that marvel of
marine architecture&mdash;the torpedo boat destroyer. She has about
sixty-five of these vessels now in commission, and has about as
many more in course of building.</p>

<p>People ordinarily have a false idea of the appearance of a
destroyer. The common type is longer than an ordinary
gunboat&mdash;a long, low, graceful thing, flying through the water
at fabulous speed, with a great curve of water some yards back of
the bow, and smoke flying horizontally from the three or four
stacks.</p>

<p>Bushing this way and that way, circling, dodging, turning, they
are like demons.</p>

<p>The best kind of modern destroyer has a length of 220 feet, with
a beam of 26&frac12; feet. The horse-power is about 6500, driving
the boat at a speed of thirty-one knots or more. The engines are
triple-expansion, with water tube boilers. They carry from 70 to
100 tons of coal, and at a speed of eight or nine knots can keep
the sea for a week; so they are independent of coaling in a voyage
of between 1300 and 1500 miles. They carry a crew of three or four
officers, and about forty men.</p>

<p>They are armed usually with one twelve-pounder gun, and from
three to five six-pounder guns, besides their equipment of
torpedoes. Their hulls and top hamper are painted olive, buff, or
preferably slate, in order to make them hard to find with the eye
at sea.</p>

<p>Their principal functions, theoretically, are to discover and
kill the enemy's torpedo boats, guard and scout for the main
squadron, and perform messenger service. However, they are also
torpedo boats of a most formidable kind, and in action will be
found carrying out the torpedo boat idea in an expanded form. Four
destroyers of this type building at the Yarrow yards were for Japan
(1898).</p>

<p>The modern European ideal of a torpedo boat is a craft 152 feet
long, with a beam of 15&frac14; feet. When the boat is fully loaded
a speed of 24 knots is derived from her 2000 horse-power engines.
The destroyers are twin screw, whereas the torpedo boats are
commonly propelled by a single screw. The speed of twenty knots is
for a run of three hours. These boats are not designed to keep at
sea for any great length of time, and cannot raid toward a distant
coast without the constant attendance of a cruiser to keep them in
coal and provisions. Primarily they are for defence. Even with
destroyers, England, in lately reinforcing her foreign stations,
has seen fit to send cruisers in order to provide help for them in
stormy weather.</p>

<p>Some years ago it was thought the proper thing to equip torpedo
craft with rudders, which would enable them to turn in their own
length when running at full speed. Yarrow found this to result in
too much broken steering gear, and the firm's boats now have
smaller rudders, which enable them to turn in a larger circle.</p>

<p>At one time a torpedo boat steaming at her best gait always
carried a great bone in her teeth. During man&oelig;uvres the watch
on the deck of a battleship often discovered the approach of the
little enemy by the great white wave which the boat rolled at her
bows during her headlong rush. This was mainly because the
old-fashioned boats carried two torpedo tubes set in the bows, and
the bows were consequently bluff.</p>

<p>The modern boat carries the great part of her armament amidships
and astern on swivels, and her bow is like a dagger. With no more
bow-waves, and with these phantom colours of buff, olive,
bottle-green, or slate, the principal foe to a safe attack at night
is bad firing in the stoke-room, which might cause flames to leap
out of the stacks.</p>

<p>A captain of an English battleship recently remarked: "See those
five destroyers lying there? Well, if they should attack me I would
sink four of them, but the fifth one would sink me."</p>

<p>This was repeated to Yarrow's manager, who said: "He wouldn't
sink four of them if the attack were at night and the boats were
shrewdly and courageously handled." Anyhow, the captain's remark
goes to show the wholesome respect which the great battleship has
for these little fliers.</p>

<p>The Yarrow people say there is no sense in a torpedo flotilla
attack on anything save vessels. A modern fortification is never
built near enough to the water for a torpedo explosion to injure
it, and, although some old stone flush-with-the-water castle might
be badly crumpled, it would harm nobody in particular, even if the
assault were wholly successful.</p>

<p>Of course, if a torpedo boat could get a chance at piers and
dock gates they would make a disturbance, but the chance is
extremely remote if the defenders have ordinary vigilance and some
rapid fire guns. In harbour defence the searchlight would naturally
play a most important part, whereas at sea experts are beginning to
doubt its use as an auxiliary to the rapid fire guns against
torpedo boats. About half the time it does little more than betray
the position of the ship. On the other hand, a port cannot conceal
its position anyhow, and searchlights would be invaluable for
sweeping the narrow channels.</p>

<p>There could be only one direction from which the assault could
come, and all the odds would be in favour of the guns on shore. A
torpedo boat commander knows this perfectly. What he wants is a
ship off at sea with a nervous crew staring into the encircling
darkness from any point in which the terror might be coming.</p>

<p>Hi, then, for a grand, bold, silent rush and the assassin-like
stab.</p>

<p>In stormy weather life on board a torpedo boat is not amusing.
They tumble about like bucking bronchos, especially if they are
going at anything like speed. Everything is battened down as if it
were soldered, and the watch below feel that they are living in a
football, which is being kicked every way at once.</p>

<p>And finally, while Yarrow and other great builders can make
torpedo craft which are wonders of speed and man&oelig;uvring
power, they cannot make that high spirit of daring and hardihood
which is essential to a success.</p>

<p>That must exist in the mind of some young lieutenant who,
knowing well that if he is detected, a shot or so from a rapid fire
gun will cripple him if it does not sink him absolutely,
nevertheless goes creeping off to sea to find a huge antagonist and
perform stealthily in the darkness an act which is more peculiarly
murderous than most things in war.</p>

<p>If a torpedo boat is caught within range in daylight, the
fighting is all over before it begins. Any common little gunboat
can dispose of it in a moment if the gunnery is not too
Chinese.</p>

<h3><a name="ch7-1" id="ch7-1"></a>I.&mdash;An Old Man Goes
Wooing</h3>

<p>The melancholy fisherman made his way through a street that was
mainly as dark as a tunnel. Sometimes an open door threw a
rectangle of light upon the pavement, and within the cottages were
scenes of working women and men, who comfortably smoked and talked.
From them came the sounds of laughter and the babble of children.
Each time the old man passed through one of the radiant zones the
light etched his face in profile with touches flaming and sombre
until there was a resemblance to a stern and mournful Dante
portrait.</p>

<p>Once a whistling lad came through the darkness. He peered
intently for purposes of recognition. "Good avenin', Mickey," he
cried cheerfully. The old man responded with a groan, which
intimated that the lamentable reckless optimism of the youth had
forced from him an expression of an emotion that he had been
enduring in saintly patience and silence. He continued his
pilgrimage toward the kitchen of the village inn.</p>

<p>The kitchen is a great and worthy place. The long range with its
lurid heat continually emits the fragrance of broiling fish,
roasting mutton, joints, and fowl. The high black ceiling is
ornamented with hams and flitches of bacon. There is a long, dark
bench against one wall, and it is fronted by a dark table, handy
for glasses of stout. On an old mahogany dresser rows of plates
face the distant range, and reflect the red shine of the peat.
Smoke which has in it the odour of an American forest fire eddies
through the air. The great stones of the floor are scarred by the
black mud from the inn yard. And here the gossip of a country-side
goes on amid the sizzle of broiling fish and the loud protesting
splutter of joints taken from the oven.</p>

<p>When the old man reached the door of this paradise, he stopped
for a moment with his finger on the latch. He sighed deeply;
evidently he was undergoing some lachrymose reflection. For
somewhere overhead in the inn he could hear the wild clamour of
dining pig-buyers, men who were come for the pig fair to be held on
the morrow. Evidently in the little parlour of the inn these men
were dining amid an uproar of shouted jests and laughter. The
revelry sounded like the fighting of two mobs amid a rain of
missiles and crash of shop windows. The old man raised his hand as
if, unseen there in the darkness, he was going to solemnly damn the
dinner of the pig-buyers.</p>

<p>Within the kitchen Nora, tall, strong, intrepid, approached the
fiery stove in the manner of a boxer. Her left arm was held high to
guard her face, which was already crimson from the blaze. With a
flourish of her apron she achieved a great brown humming joint from
the oven, and, emerging a glowing and triumphant figure from the
steam and smoke and rapid play of heat, she slid the pan upon the
table, even as she saw the old man standing within the room and
lugubriously cleaning the mud from his boots. "Tis you, Mickey?"
she said.</p>

<p>He made no reply until he had found his way to the long bench.
"It is," he said then. It was clear that in the girl's opinion he
had gained some kind of strategic advantage. The sanctity of her
kitchen was successfully violated, but the old man betrayed no
elation. Lifting one knee and placing it over the other, he grunted
in the blissful weariness of a venerable labourer returned to his
own fireside. He coughed dismally. "Ah, 'tis no good a man gits
from fishin' these days. I moind the toimes whin they would be
hoppin' up clear o' the wather, there was that little room fur
thim. I would be likin' a bottle o' stout."</p>

<p>"Niver fear you, Mickey," answered the girl. Swinging here and
there in the glare of the fire, Nora, with her towering figure and
bare brawny arms, was like a feminine blacksmith at a forge. The
old man, pallid, emaciated, watched her from the shadows at the
other side of the room. The lines from the sides of his nose to the
corners of his mouth sank low to an expression of despair deeper
than any moans. He should have been painted upon the door of a tomb
with wringing willows arched above him and men in grey robes slowly
booming the drums of death. Finally he spoke. "I would be likin' a
bottle o' stout, Nora, me girrl," he said.</p>

<p>"Niver fear you, Mickey," again she replied with cheerful
obstinacy. She was admiring her famous roast, which now sat in its
platter on the rack over the range. There was a lull in her
tumultuous duties. The old man coughed and moved his foot with a
scraping sound on the stones. The noise of dining pig-buyers, now
heard through doors and winding corridors of the inn, was a roll of
far-away storm.</p>

<p>A woman in a dark dress entered the kitchen and keenly examined
the roast and Nora's other feats. "Mickey here would be wantin' a
bottle o' stout," said the girl to her mistress. The woman turned
towards the spectral figure in the gloom, and regarded it quietly
with a clear eye. "Have yez the money, Mickey?" repeated the woman
of the house.</p>

<p>Profoundly embittered, he replied in short terms, "I have."</p>

<p>"There now," cried Nora, in astonishment and admiration. Poising
a large iron spoon, she was motionless, staring with open mouth at
the old man. He searched his pockets slowly during a complete
silence in the kitchen. He brought forth two coppers and laid them
sadly, reproachfully, and yet defiantly on the table.</p>

<p>"There now," cried Nora, stupefied.</p>

<p>They brought him a bottle of the black brew, and Nora poured it
out for him with her own red hand, which looked to be as broad as
his chest. A collar of brown foam curled at the top of the glass.
With measured moments the old man filled a short pipe. There came a
sudden howl from another part of the inn. One of the pig-buyers was
at the head of the stairs bawling for the mistress. The two women
hurriedly freighted themselves with the roast and the vegetables,
and sprang with them to placate the pig-buyers. Alone, the old man
studied the gleam of the fire on the floor. It faded and brightened
in the way of lightning at the horizon's edge.</p>

<p>When Nora returned, the strapping grenadier of a girl was
blushing and giggling. The pig-buyers had been humorous. "I moind
the toime&mdash;" began the man sorrowfully. "I moind the toime
whin yea was a wee bit of a girrl, Nora, an' wouldn't be havin'
words wid min loike thim buyers."</p>

<p>"I moind the toime whin yea could attind to your own affairs, ye
ould skileton," said the girl promptly. He made a gesture, which
may have expressed his stirring grief at the levity of the new
generation, and then lapsed into another stillness.</p>

<p>The girl, a giantess, carrying, lifting, pushing, an incarnation
of dauntless labour, changing the look of the whole kitchen with a
moment's manipulation of her great arms, did not heed the old man
for a long time. When she finally glanced toward him, she saw that
he was sunk forward with his grey face on his arms. A growl of
heavy breathing ascended. He was asleep.</p>

<p>She marched to him and put both hands to his collar. Despite his
feeble and dreamy protestations, she dragged him out from behind
the table and across the floor. She opened the door and thrust him
into the night.</p>

<h3><a name="ch7-2" id="ch7-2"></a>II.&mdash;Ballydehob</h3>

<p>The illimitable inventive incapacity of the excursion companies
has made many circular paths throughout Ireland, and on these
well-pounded roads the guardians of the touring public may be seen
drilling the little travellers in squads. To rise in rebellion, to
face the superior clerk in his bureau, to endure his smile of pity
and derision, and finally to wring freedom from him, is as
difficult in some parts of Ireland as it is in all parts of
Switzerland. To see the tourists chained in gangs and taken to see
the Lakes of Killarney is a sad spectacle, because these people
believe that they are learning Ireland, even as men believe that
they are studying America when they contemplate the Niagara
Falls.</p>

<p>But afterwards, if one escapes, one can go forth, unguided,
untaught and alone, and look at Ireland. The joys of the
pig-market, the delirium of a little tap-room filled with brogue,
the fierce excitement of viewing the Royal Irish Constabulary
fishing for trout, the whole quaint and primitive machinery of the
peasant life&mdash;its melancholy, its sunshine, its
humour&mdash;all this is then the property of the man who breaks
like a Texan steer out of the pens and corrals of the tourist
agencies. For what syndicate of maiden ladies&mdash;it is these who
masquerade as tourist agencies&mdash;what syndicate of maiden
ladies knows of the existence, for instance, of Ballydehob?</p>

<p>One has a sense of disclosure at writing the name of Ballydehob.
It was really a valuable secret. There is in Ballydehob not one
thing that is commonly pointed out to the stranger as a thing
worthy of a half-tone reproduction in a book. There is no cascade,
no peak, no lake, no guide with a fund of useless information, no
gamins practised in the seduction of tourists. It is not an
exhibit, an entry for a prize, like a heap of melons or cow. It is
simply an Irish village wherein live some three hundred Irish and
four constables.</p>

<p>If one or two prayer-towers spindled above Ballydehob it would
be a perfect Turkish village. The red tiles and red bricks of
England do not appear at all. The houses are low, with soiled white
walls. The doors open abruptly upon dark old rooms. Here and there
in the street is some crude cobbling done with round stones taken
from the bed of a brook. At times there is a great deal of mud.
Chickens depredate warily about the doorsteps, and intent pigs
emerge for plunder from the alleys. It is unavoidable to admit that
many people would consider Ballydehob quite too grimy.</p>

<p>Nobody lives here that has money. The average English tradesman
with his back-breaking respect for this class, his reflex contempt
for that class, his reverence for the tin gods, could here be a
commercial lord and bully the people in one or two ways, until they
were thrown back upon the defence which is always near them, the
ability to cut his skin into strips with a wit that would be a
foreign tongue to him. For amid his wrongs and his rights and his
failures&mdash;his colossal failures&mdash;the Irishman retains
this delicate blade for his enemies, for his friends, for himself,
the ancestral dagger of fast sharp speaking from fast sharp
seeing&mdash;an inheritance which could move the world. And the
Royal Irish Constabulary fished for trout in the adjacent
streams.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kearney keeps the hotel. In Ireland male innkeepers die
young. Apparently they succumb to conviviality when it is presented
to them in the guise of a business duty. Naturally honest,
temperate men, their consciences are lulled to false security by
this idea of hard drinking being necessary to the successful
keeping of a public-house. It is very terrible.</p>

<p>But they invariably leave behind them capable widows, women who
do not recognise conviviality as a business obligation. And so all
through Ireland one finds these brisk widows keeping hotels with a
precision that is almost military.</p>

<p>In Kearney's there is always a wonderful collection of old
women, bent figures shrouded in shawls who reach up scrawny fingers
to take their little purchases from Mary Agnes, who presides
sometimes at the bar, but more often at the shop that fronts it in
the same room. In the gloom of a late afternoon these old women are
as mystic as the swinging, chanting witches on a dark stage when
the thunder-drum rolls and the lightning flashes by schedule. When
a grey rain sweeps through the narrow street of Ballydehob, and
makes heavy shadows in Kearney's tap-room, these old creatures,
with their high mournful voices, and the mystery of their shawls,
their moans and aged mutterings when they are obliged to take a
step, raise the dead superstitions from the bottom of a man's
mind.</p>

<p>"My boy," remarked my London friend cheerfully, "these might
have furnished sons to be Aldermen or Congressmen in the great city
of New York."</p>

<p>"Aldermen or Congressmen of the great city of New York always
take care of their mothers," I answered meekly.</p>

<p>On a barrel, over in a corner, sat a yellow-bearded Irish farmer
in tattered clothes who wished to exchange views on the Armenian
massacres. He had much information and a number of theories in
regard to them. He also advanced the opinion that the chief
political aim of Russia at present is in the direction of China,
and that it behoved other Powers to keep an eye on her. He thought
the revolutionists in Cuba would never accept autonomy at the hands
of Spain. His pipe glowed comfortably from his corner; waving the
tuppenny glass of stout in the air, he discoursed on the business
of the remote ends of the earth with the glibness of a fourth
secretary of Legation. Here was a little farmer, digging betimes in
a forlorn patch of wet ground, a man to whom a sudden two shillings
would appear as a miracle, a ragged, unkempt peasant, whose mind
roamed the world like the soul of a lost diplomat. This unschooled
man believed that the earth was a sphere inhabited by men that are
alike in the essentials, different in the manners, the little
manners, which are accounted of such great importance by the
emaciated. He was to a degree capable of knowing that he lived on a
sphere and not on the apex of a triangle.</p>

<p>And yet, when the talk had turned another corner, he confidently
assured the assembled company that a hair from a horse's tail when
thrown in a brook would turn shortly to an eel.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch7-3" id="ch7-3"></a>III.&mdash;The Royal Irish
Constabulary</h3>

<p>The newspapers called it a Veritable Arsenal. There was a
description of how the sergeant of Constabulary had bent an ear to
receive whispered information of the concealed arms, and had then
marched his men swiftly and by night to surround a certain house.
The search elicited a double-barrelled breech-loading shot-gun,
some empty shells, powder, shot, and a loading machine. The point
of it was that some of the Irish papers called it a Veritable
Arsenal, and appeared to congratulate the Government upon having
strangled another unhappy rebellion in its nest. They floundered
and misnamed and mis-reasoned, and made a spectacle of the great
modern craft of journalism, until the affair of this poor poacher
was too absurd to be pitiable, and Englishmen over their coffee
next morning must have almost believed that the prompt action of
the Constabulary had quelled a rising. Thus it is that the Irish
fight the Irish.</p>

<p>One cannot look Ireland straight in the face without seeing a
great many constables. The country is dotted with little garrisons.
It must have been said a thousand times that there is an absolute
military occupation. The fact is too plain.</p>

<p>The constable himself becomes a figure interesting in its
isolation. He has in most cases a social position which is somewhat
analogous to that of a Turk in Thessaly. But then, in the same way,
the Turk has the Turkish army. He can have battalions as companions
and make the acquaintance of brigades. The constable has the
Constabulary, it is true; but to be cooped with three or four
others in a small white-washed iron-bound house on some bleak
country side is not an exact parallel to the Thessalian situation.
It looks to be a life that is infinitely lonely, ascetic, and
barren. Two keepers of a lighthouse at a bitter end of land in a
remote sea will, if they are properly let alone, make a murder in
time. Five constables imprisoned 'mid a folk that will not turn a
face toward them, five constables planted in a populated silence,
may develop an acute and vivid economy, dwell in scowling dislike.
A religious asylum in a snow-buried mountain pass will breed
conspiring monks. A separated people will beget an egotism that is
almost titanic. A world floating distinctly in space will call
itself the only world. The progression is perfect.</p>

<p>But the constables take the second degree. They are next to the
lighthouse keepers. The national custom of meeting stranger and
friend alike on the road with a cheery greeting like "God save you"
is too kindly and human a habit not to be missed. But all through
the South of Ireland one sees the peasant turn his eyes
pretentiously to the side of the road at the passing of the
constable. It seemed to be generally understood that to note the
presence of a constable was to make a conventional error. None
looked, nodded, or gave sign. There was a line drawn so sternly
that it reared like a fence. Of course, any police force in any
part of the world can gather at its heels a riff-raff of people,
fawning always on a hand licensed to strike that would be larger
than the army of the Potomac, but of these one ordinarily sees
little. The mass of the Irish strictly obey the stern tenet. One
hears often of the ostracism or other punishment that befell some
girl who was caught flirting with a constable.</p>

<p>Naturally the constable retreats to his pride. He is commonly a
soldierly-looking chap, straight, lean, long-strided, well set-up.
His little saucer of a forage cap sits obediently on his ear, as it
does for the British soldier. He swings a little cane. He takes his
medicine with a calm and hard face, and evidently stares full into
every eye. But it is singular to find in the situation of the Royal
Irish Constabulary the quality of pathos.</p>

<p>It is not known if these places in the South of Ireland are
called disturbed districts. Over them hangs the peace of Surrey,
but the word disturbance has an elastic arrangement by which it can
be made to cover anything. All of the villages visited garrisoned
from four to ten men. They lived comfortably in their white houses,
strolled in pairs over the country roads, picked blackberries, and
fished for trout. If at some time there came a crisis, one man was
more than enough to surround it. The remaining nine add dignity to
the scene. The crisis chiefly consisted of occasional drunken men
who were unable to understand the local geography on Saturday
nights.</p>

<p>The note continually struck was that each group of constables
lived on a little social island, and there was no boat to take them
off. There has been no such marooning since the days of the
pirates. The sequestration must be complete when a man with a dinky
little cap on his ear is not allowed to talk to the girls.</p>

<p>But they fish for trout. Isaac Walton is the father of the Royal
Irish Constabulary. They could be seen on any fine day whipping the
streams from source to mouth. There was one venerable sergeant who
made a rod less than a yard long. With a line of about the same
length attached to this rod, he hunted the gorse-hung banks of the
little streams in the hills. An eight-inch ribbon of water lined
with masses of heather and gorse will be accounted contemptible by
a fisherman with an ordinary rod. But it was the pleasure of the
sergeant to lay on his stomach at the side of such a stream and
carefully, inch by inch, scout his hook through the pools. He
probably caught more trout than any three men in county Cork. He
fished more than any twelve men in the county Cork. Some people had
never seen him in any other posture but that of crowding forward on
his stomach to peer into a pool. They did not believe the rumour
that he sometimes stood or walked like a human.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch7-4" id="ch7-4"></a>IV.&mdash;A Fishing Village</h3>

<p>The brook curved down over the rocks, innocent and white, until
it faced a little strand of smooth gravel and flat stones. It
turned then to the left, and thereafter its guilty current was
tinged with the pink of diluted blood. Boulders standing neck-deep
in the water were rimmed with red; they wore bloody collars whose
tops marked the supreme instant of some tragic movement of the
stream. In the pale green shallows of the bay's edge, the outward
flow from the criminal little brook was as eloquently marked as if
a long crimson carpet had been laid upon the waters. The scene of
the carnage was the strand of smooth gravel and flat stones, and
the fruit of the carnage was cleaned mackerel.</p>

<p>Far to the south, where the slate of the sea and the grey of the
sky wove together, could be seen Fastnet Rock, a mere button on the
moving, shimmering cloth, while a liner, no larger than a needle,
spun a thread of smoke aslant. The gulls swept screaming along the
dull line of the other shore of roaring Water Bay, and near the
mouth of the brook circled among the fishing boats that lay at
anchor, their brown, leathery sails idle and straight. The
wheeling, shrieking tumultuous birds stared with their hideous
unblinking eyes at the Capers&mdash;men from Cape Clear&mdash;who
prowled to and fro on the decks amid shouts and the creak of the
tackle. Shoreward, a little shrivelled man, overcome by a profound
melancholy, fished hopelessly from the end of the pier. Back of
him, on a hillside, sat a white village, nestled among more trees
than is common in this part of Southern Ireland.</p>

<p>A dinghy sculled by a youth in a blue jersey wobbled rapidly
past the pier-head and stopped at the foot of the moss-green, dank,
stone steps, where the waves were making slow but regular leaps to
mount higher, and then falling back gurgling, choking, and waving
the long, dark seaweeds. The melancholy fisherman walked over to
the top of the steps. The young man was fastening the painter of
his boat in an iron ring. In the dinghy were three round baskets
heaped high with mackerel. They glittered like masses of new silver
coin at times, and then other lights of faint carmine and peacock
blue would chase across the sides of the fish in a radiance that
was finer than silver.</p>

<p>The melancholy fisherman looked at this wealth. He shook his
head mournfully. "Ah, now, Denny. This would not be a very good
kill."</p>

<p>The young man snorted indignantly at his fellow-townsman. "This
will be th' bist kill th' year, Mickey. Go along now."</p>

<p>The melancholy old man became immersed in deeper gloom. "Shure I
have been in th' way of seein' miny a grand day whin th' fish was
runnin' sthrong in these wathers, but there will be no more big
kills here. No more. No more." At the last his voice was only a
dismal croak.</p>

<p>"Come along outa that now, Mickey," cried the youth impatiently.
"Come away wid you."</p>

<p>"All gone now. A-ll go-o-ne now!" The old man wagged his grey
head, and, standing over the baskets of fishes, groaned as Mordecai
groaned for his people.</p>

<p>"'Tis you would be cryin' out, Mickey, whativer," said the youth
with scorn. He was giving his basket into the hands of five
incompetent but jovial little boys to carry to a waiting donkey
cart.</p>

<p>"An' why should I not?" said the old man sternly. "Me&mdash;in
want&mdash;"</p>

<p>As the youth swung his boat swiftly out toward an anchored
smack, he made answer in a softer tone. "Shure, if yez got for th'
askin', 'tis you, Mickey, that would niver be in want." The
melancholy old man returned to his line. And the only moral in this
incident is that the young man is the type that America procures
from Ireland, and the old man is one of the home types, bent,
pallid, hungry, disheartened, with a vision that magnifies with a
microscope glance any fly-wing of misfortune, and heroically and
conscientiously invents disasters for the future. Usually the thing
that remains to one of this type is a sympathy as quick and acute
for others as is his pity for himself.</p>

<p>The donkey with his cart-load of gleaming fish, and escorted by
the whooping and laughing boys, galloped along the quay and up a
street of the village until he was turned off at the gravelly
strand, at the point where the colour of the brook was changing.
Here twenty people of both sexes and all ages were preparing the
fish for market. The mackerel, beautiful as fire-etched salvers,
first were passed to a long table, around which worked as many
women as could have elbow room. Each one could clean a fish with
two motions of the knife. Then the washers, men who stood over the
troughs filled with running water from the brook, soused the fish
until the outlet became a sinister element that in an instant
changed the brook from a happy thing of gorse and heather of the
hills to an evil stream, sullen and reddened. After being washed,
the fish were carried to a group of girls with knives, who made the
cuts that enabled each fish to flatten out in the manner known of
the breakfast table. And after the girls came the men and boys, who
rubbed each fish thoroughly with great handfuls of coarse salt,
which was whiter than snow, and shone in the daylight from a
multitude of gleaming points, diamond-like. Last came the packers,
drilled in the art of getting neither too few nor too many mackerel
into a barrel, sprinkling constantly prodigal layers of brilliant
salt. There were many intermediate corps of boys and girls carrying
fish from point to point, and sometimes building them in stacks
convenient to the hands of the more important labourers.</p>

<p>A vast tree hung its branches over the place. The leaves made a
shadow that was religious in its effect, as if the spot was a
chapel consecrated to labour. There was a hush upon the devotees.
The women at the large table worked intently, steadfastly, with
bowed heads. Their old petticoats were tucked high, showing the
coarse brogans which they wore&mdash;and the visible ankles were
proportioned to the brogans as the diameter of a straw is to that
of a half-crown. The national red under-petticoat was a fundamental
part of the scene.</p>

<p>Just over the wall, in the sloping street, could be seen the
bejerseyed Capers, brawny, and with shocks of yellow beard. They
paced slowly to and fro amid the geese and children. They, too,
spoke little, even to each other; they smoked short pipes in
saturnine dignity and silence. It was the fish. They who go with
nets upon the reeling sea grow still with the mystery and solemnity
of the trade. It was Brittany; the first respectable catch of the
year had changed this garrulous Irish hamlet into a hamlet of
Brittany.</p>

<p>The Capers were waiting for high tide. It had seemed for a long
time that, for the south of Ireland, the mackerel had fled in
company with potato; but here, at any rate, was a temporary
success, and the occasion was momentous. A strolling Caper took his
pipe and pointed with the stem out upon the bay. There was little
wind, but an ambitious skipper had raised his anchor, and the
craft, her strained brown sails idly swinging, was drifting away on
the first oily turn of the tide.</p>

<p>On the top of the pier the figure of the melancholy old man was
portrayed upon the polished water. He was still dangling his line
hopelessly. He gazed down into the misty water. Once he stirred and
murmured: "Bad luck to thim." Otherwise he seemed to remain
motionless for hours. One by one the fishing-boats floated away.
The brook changed its colour, and in the dusk showed a tumble of
pearly white among the rocks.</p>

<p>A cold night wind, sweeping transversely across the pier,
awakened perhaps the rheumatism in the old man's bones. He arose
and, mumbling and grumbling, began to wind his line. The waves were
lashing the stones. He moved off towards the intense darkness of
the village streets.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch8-1" id="ch8-1"></a>Four Men in a Cave</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>Likewise Four Queens, and a Sullivan County
Hermit</b>
</p>

<p>The moon rested for a moment on the top of a tall pine on a
hill.</p>

<p>The little man was standing in front of the campfire making
orations to his companions.</p>

<p>"We can tell a great tale when we get back to the city if we
investigate this thing," said he, in conclusion.</p>

<p>They were won.</p>

<p>The little man was determined to explore a cave, because its
black mouth had gaped at him. The four men took lighted pine-knot
and clambered over boulders down a hill. In a thicket on the
mountainside lay a little tilted hole. At its side they halted.</p>

<p>"Well?" said the little man.</p>

<p>They fought for last place and the little man was overwhelmed.
He tried to struggle from under by crying that if the fat, pudgy
man came after, he would be corked. But he finally administered a
cursing over his shoulder and crawled into the hole. His companions
gingerly followed.</p>

<p>A passage, the floor of damp clay and pebbles, the walls slimy,
green-mossed, and dripping, sloped downward. In the cave atmosphere
the torches became studies in red blaze and black smoke.</p>

<p>"Ho!" cried the little man, stifled and bedraggled, "let's go
back." His companions were not brave. They were last. The next one
to the little man pushed him on, so the little man said sulphurous
words and cautiously continued his crawl.</p>

<p>Things that hung seemed to be on the wet, uneven ceiling, ready
to drop upon the men's bare necks. Under their hands the clammy
floor seemed alive and writhing. When the little man endeavoured to
stand erect the ceiling forced him down. Knobs and points came out
and punched him. His clothes were wet and mud-covered, and his
eyes, nearly blinded by smoke, tried to pierce the darkness always
before his torch.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, you fellows, let's go back," cried he. At that
moment he caught the gleam of trembling light in the blurred
shadows before him.</p>

<p>"Ho!" he said, "here's another way out."</p>

<p>The passage turned abruptly. The little man put one hand around
the corner, but it touched nothing. He investigated and discovered
that the little corridor took a sudden dip down a hill. At the
bottom shone a yellow light.</p>

<p>The little man wriggled painfully about, and descended feet in
advance. The others followed his plan. All picked their way with
anxious care. The traitorous rocks rolled from beneath the little
man's feet and roared thunderously below him. Lesser stone,
loosened by the men above him, hit him on the back. He gained
seemingly firm foothold, and, turning half-way about, swore redly
at his companions for dolts and careless fools. The pudgy man sat,
puffing and perspiring, high in the rear of the procession. The
fumes and smoke from four pine-knots were in his blood. Cinders and
sparks lay thick in his eyes and hair. The pause of the little man
angered him.</p>

<p>"Go on, you fool," he shouted. "Poor, painted man, you are
afraid."</p>

<p>"Ho!" said the little man. "Come down here and go on yourself,
imbecile!"</p>

<p>The pudgy man vibrated with passion. He leaned downward.
"Idiot&mdash;!"</p>

<p>He was interrupted by one of his feet which flew out and crashed
into the man in front of and below. It is not well to quarrel upon
a slippery incline, when the unknown is below. The fat man, having
lost the support of one pillar-like foot, lurched forward. His body
smote the next man, who hurtled into the next man. Then they all
fell upon the cursing little man.</p>

<p>They slid in a body down over the slippery, slimy floor of the
passage. The stone avenue must have wibble-wobbled with the rush of
this ball of tangled men and strangled cries. The torches went out
with the combined assault upon the little man. The adventurers
whirled to the unknown in darkness. The little man felt that he was
pitching to death, but even in his convolutions he bit and
scratched at his companions, for he was satisfied that it was their
fault. The swirling mass went some twenty feet, and lit upon a
level, dry place in a strong, yellow light of candles. It dissolved
and became eyes.</p>

<p>The four men lay in a heap upon the floor of a grey chamber. A
small fire smouldered in the corner, the smoke disappearing in a
crack. In another corner was a bed of faded hemlock boughs and two
blankets. Cooking utensils and clothes lay about, with boxes and a
barrel.</p>

<p>Of these things the four men took small cognisance. The pudgy
man did not curse the little man, nor did the little swear, in the
abstract. Eight widened eyes were fixed upon the centre of the room
of rocks.</p>

<p>A great, grey stone, cut squarely, like an altar, sat in the
middle of the floor. Over it burned three candles, in swaying tin
cups hung from the ceiling. Before it, with what seemed to be a
small volume clasped in his yellow fingers, stood a man. He was an
infinitely sallow person in the brown-checked shirt of the ploughs
and cows. The rest of his apparel was boots. A long grey beard
dangled from his chin. He fixed glinting, fiery eyes upon the heap
of men, and remained motionless. Fascinated, their tongues
cleaving, their blood cold, they arose to their feet. The gleaming
glance of the recluse swept slowly over the group until it found
the face of the little man. There it stayed and burned.</p>

<p>The little man shrivelled and crumpled as the dried leaf under
the glass.</p>

<p>Finally, the recluse slowly, deeply spoke. It was a true voice
from a cave, cold, solemn, and damp.</p>

<p>"It's your ante," he said.</p>

<p>"What?" said the little man.</p>

<p>The hermit tilted his beard and laughed a laugh that was either
the chatter of a banshee in a storm or the rattle of pebbles in a
tin box. His visitors' flesh seemed ready to drop from their
bones.</p>

<p>They huddled together and cast fearful eyes over their
shoulders. They whispered.</p>

<p>"A vampire!" said one.</p>

<p>"A ghoul!" said another.</p>

<p>"A Druid before the sacrifice," murmured another.</p>

<p>"The shade of an Aztec witch doctor," said the little man.</p>

<p>As they looked, the inscrutable face underwent a change. It
became a livid background for his eyes, which blazed at the little
man like impassioned carbuncles. His voice arose to a howl of
ferocity. "It's your ante!" With a panther-like motion he drew a
long, thin knife and advanced, stooping. Two cadaverous hounds came
from nowhere, and, scowling and growling, made desperate feints at
the little man's legs. His quaking companions pushed him
forward.</p>

<p>Tremblingly he put his hand to his pocket.</p>

<p>"How much?" he said, with a shivering look at the knife that
glittered.</p>

<p>The carbuncles faded.</p>

<p>"Three dollars," said the hermit, in sepulchral tones which rang
against the walls and among the passages, awakening long-dead
spirits with voices. The shaking little man took a roll of bills
from a pocket and placed "three ones" upon the altar-like stone.
The recluse looked at the little volume with reverence in his eyes.
It was a pack of playing cards.</p>

<p>Under the three swinging candles, upon the altar-like stone, the
grey beard and the agonised little man played at poker. The three
other men crouched in a corner, and stared with eyes that gleamed
with terror. Before them sat the cadaverous hounds licking their
red lips. The candles burned low, and began to flicker. The fire in
the corner expired.</p>

<p>Finally, the game came to a point where the little man laid down
his hand and quavered: "I can't call you this time, sir. I'm dead
broke."</p>

<p>"What?" shrieked the recluse. "Not call me! Villain! Dastard!
Cur! I have four queens, miscreant." His voice grew so mighty that
it could not fit his throat. He choked, wrestling with his lungs
for a moment. Then the power of his body was concentrated in a
word: "Go!"</p>

<p>He pointed a quivering, yellow finger at a wide crack in the
rock. The little man threw himself at it with a howl. His erstwhile
frozen companions felt their blood throb again. With great bounds
they plunged after the little man. A minute of scrambling, falling,
and pushing brought them to open air. They climbed the distance to
their camp in furious springs.</p>

<p>The sky in the east was a lurid yellow. In the west the
footprints of departing night lay on the pine trees. In front of
their replenished camp fire sat John Willerkins, the guide.</p>

<p>"Hello!" he shouted at their approach. "Be you fellers ready to
go deer huntin'?"</p>

<p>Without replying, they stopped and debated among themselves in
whispers.</p>

<p>Finally, the pudgy man came forward.</p>

<p>"John," he inquired, "do you know anything peculiar about this
cave below here?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Willerkins at once; "Tom Gardner."</p>

<p>"What?" said the pudgy man.</p>

<p>"Tom Gardner."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see," said Willerkins slowly, as he took dignified
pulls at his pipe, "Tom Gardner was once a fambly man, who lived in
these here parts on a nice leetle farm. He uster go away to the
city orften, and one time he got a-gamblin' in one of them there
dens. He wentter the dickens right quick then. At last he kum home
one time and tol' his folks he had up and sold the farm and all he
had in the worl'. His leetle wife she died then. Tom he went crazy,
and soon after&mdash;"</p>

<p>The narrative was interrupted by the little man, who became
possessed of devils.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't give a cuss if he had left me 'nough money to get
home on the doggoned, grey-haired red pirate," he shrilled, in a
seething sentence. The pudgy man gazed at the little man calmly and
sneeringly.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," he said, "we can tell a great tale when we get back
to the city after having investigated this thing."</p>

<p>"Go to the devil," replied the little man.</p>

<h3><a name="ch8-2" id="ch8-2"></a>The Mesmeric Mountain</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>A Tale of Sullivan County</b>
</p>

<p>On the brow of a pine-plumed hillock there sat a little man with
his back against a tree. A venerable pipe hung from his mouth, and
smoke-wreaths curled slowly skyward. He was muttering to himself
with his eyes fixed on an irregular black opening in the green wall
of forest at the foot of the hill. Two vague waggon ruts led into
the shadows. The little man took his pipe in his hands and
addressed the listening pines.</p>

<p>"I wonder what the devil it leads to," said he.</p>

<p>A grey, fat rabbit came lazily from a thicket and sat in the
opening. Softly stroking his stomach with his paw, he looked at the
little man in a thoughtful manner. The little man threw a stone,
and the rabbit blinked and ran through an opening. Green, shadowy
portals seemed to close behind him.</p>

<p>The little man started. "He's gone down that roadway," he said,
with ecstatic mystery to the pines. He sat a long time and
contemplated the door to the forest. Finally, he arose, and
awakening his limbs, started away. But he stopped and looked
back.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine what it leads to," muttered he. He trudged over
the brown mats of pine needles, to where, in a fringe of laurel, a
tent was pitched, and merry flames caroused about some logs. A
pudgy man was fuming over a collection of tin dishes. He came
forward and waved a plate furiously in the little man's face.</p>

<p>"I've washed the dishes for three days. What do you think I
am&mdash;"</p>

<p>He ended a red oration with a roar: "Damned if I do it any
more."</p>

<p>The little man gazed dim-eyed away. "I've been wonderin' what it
leads to."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"That road out yonder. I've been wonderin' what it leads to.
Maybe, some discovery or something," said the little man.</p>

<p>The pudgy man laughed. "You're an idiot. It leads to ol' Jim
Boyd's over on the Lumberland Pike."</p>

<p>"Ho!" said the little man, "I don't believe that."</p>

<p>The pudgy man swore. "Fool, what does it lead to, then?"</p>

<p>"I don't know just what, but I'm sure it leads to something
great or something. It looks like it."</p>

<p>While the pudgy man was cursing, two more men came from
obscurity with fish dangling from birch twigs. The pudgy man made
an obviously herculean struggle and a meal was prepared. As he was
drinking his cup of coffee, he suddenly spilled it and swore. The
little man was wandering off.</p>

<p>"He's gone to look at that hole," cried the pudgy man.</p>

<p>The little man went to the edge of the pine-plumed hillock, and,
sitting down, began to make smoke and regard the door to the
forest. There was stillness for an hour. Compact clouds hung
unstirred in the sky. The pines stood motionless, and
pondering.</p>

<p>Suddenly the little man slapped his knee and bit his tongue. He
stood up and determinedly filled his pipe, rolling his eye over the
bowl to the doorway. Keeping his eyes fixed he slid dangerously to
the foot of the hillock and walked down the waggon ruts. A moment
later he passed from the noise of the sunshine to the gloom of the
woods.</p>

<p>The green portals closed, shutting out live things. The little
man trudged on alone.</p>

<p>Tall tangled grass grew in the roadway, and the trees bended
obstructing branches. The little man followed on over pine-clothed
ridges and down through water-soaked swales. His shoes were cut by
rocks of the mountains, and he sank ankle-deep in mud and moss of
swamps. A curve just ahead lured him miles.</p>

<p>Finally, as he wended the side of a ridge, the road disappeared
from beneath his feet. He battled with hordes of ignorant bushes on
his way to knolls and solitary trees which invited him. Once he
came to a tall, bearded pine. He climbed it, and perceived in the
distance a peak. He uttered an ejaculation and fell out.</p>

<p>He scrambled to his feet, and said: "That's Jones's Mountain, I
guess. It's about six miles from our camp as the crow flies."</p>

<p>He changed his course away from the mountain, and attacked the
bushes again. He climbed over great logs, golden-brown in decay,
and was opposed by thickets of dark-green laurel. A brook slid
through the ooze of a swamp; cedars and hemlocks hung their sprays
to the edges of pools.</p>

<p>The little man began to stagger in his walk. After a time he
stopped and mopped his brow.</p>

<p>"My legs are about to shrivel up and drop off," he said....
"Still if I keep on in this direction, I am safe to strike the
Lumberland Pike before sundown."</p>

<p>He dived at a clump of tag-alders, and emerging, confronted
Jones's Mountain.</p>

<p>The wanderer sat down in a clear place and fixed his eyes on the
summit. His mouth opened widely, and his body swayed at times. The
little man and the peak stared in silence.</p>

<p>A lazy lake lay asleep near the foot of the mountain. In its bed
of water-grass some frogs leered at the sky and crooned. The sun
sank in red silence, and the shadows of the pines grew formidable.
The expectant hush of evening, as if some thing were going to sing
a hymn, fell upon the peak and the little man.</p>

<p>A leaping pickerel off on the water created a silver circle that
was lost in black shadows. The little man shook himself and started
to his feet, crying: "For the love of Mike, there's eyes in this
mountain! I feel 'em! Eyes!"</p>

<p>He fell on his face.</p>

<p>When he looked again, he immediately sprang erect and ran.</p>

<p>"It's comin'!"</p>

<p>The mountain was approaching.</p>

<p>The little man scurried, sobbing through the thick growth. He
felt his brain turning to water. He vanquished brambles with mighty
bounds.</p>

<p>But after a time he came again to the foot of the mountain.</p>

<p>"God!" he howled, "it's been follerin' me." He grovelled.</p>

<p>Casting his eyes upward made circles swirl in his blood.</p>

<p>"I'm shackled I guess," he moaned. As he felt the heel of the
mountain about crush his head, he sprang again to his feet. He
grasped a handful of small stones and hurled them.</p>

<p>"Damn you," he shrieked loudly. The pebbles rang against the
face of the mountain.</p>

<p>The little man then made an attack. He climbed with hands and
feet wildly. Brambles forced him back and stones slid from beneath
his feet. The peak swayed and tottered, and was ever about to smite
with a granite arm. The summit was a blaze of red wrath.</p>

<p>But the little man at last reached the top. Immediately he
swaggered with valour to the edge of the cliff. His hands were
scornfully in his pockets.</p>

<p>He gazed at the western horizon, edged sharply against a yellow
sky. "Ho!" he said. "There's Boyd's house and the Lumberland
Pike."</p>

<p>The mountain under his feet was motionless.</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>MISCELLANEOUS</h2>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch9-1" id="ch9-1"></a>The Squire's Madness</h3>

<p>Linton was in his study remote from the interference of domestic
sounds. He was writing verses. He was not a poet in the strict
sense of the word, because he had eight hundred a year and a
manor-house in Sussex. But he was devoted, at any rate, and no
happiness was for him equal to the happiness of an imprisonment in
this lonely study. His place had been a semi-fortified house in the
good days when every gentleman was either abroad with a bared sword
hunting his neighbours or behind oak-and-iron doors and three-feet
walls while his neighbours hunted him. But in the life of Linton it
may be said that the only part of the house which remained true to
the idea of fortification was the study, which was free only to
Linton's wife and certain terriers. The necessary appearance from
time to time of a servant always grated upon Linton as much as if
from time to time somebody had in the most well-bred way flung a
brick through the little panes of his window.</p>

<p>This window looked forth upon a wide valley of hop-fields and
sheep-pastures, dipping and rising this way and that way, but
always a valley until it reached a high far away ridge upon which
stood the upright figure of a windmill, usually making rapid
gestures as if it were an excited sentry warning the old grey house
of coming danger. A little to the right, on a knoll, red chimneys
and parts of red-tiled roofs appeared among trees, and the
venerable square tower of the village church rose above them.</p>

<p>For ten years Linton had left vacant Oldrestham Hall, and when
at last it became known that he and his wife were to return from an
incomprehensible wandering, the village, which for four centuries
had turned a feudal eye toward the Hall, was wrung with a prospect
of change, a proper change. The great family pew in Oldrestham
church would be occupied each Sunday morning by a fat, happy-faced,
utterly squire-looking man, who would be dutifully at his post when
the parish was stirred by a subscription list. Then, for the first
time in many years, the hunters would ride in the early morning
merrily out through the park, and there would be also shooting
parties, and in the summer groups of charming ladies would be seen
walking the terrace, laughing on the lawns and in the rose gardens.
The village expected to have the perfectly legal and fascinating
privilege of discussing the performances of its own gentry.</p>

<p>The first intimation of calamity was in the news that Linton had
rented all the shooting. This prepared the people for the blow, and
it fell when they sighted the master of Oldrestham Hall. The older
villagers remembered then that there had been nothing in the
youthful Linton to promise a fat, happy-faced, dignified, hunting,
shooting over-lord, but still they could not but resent the
appearance of the new squire. There was no conceivable reason for
his looking like a gaunt ascetic, who would surprise nobody if he
borrowed a sixpence from the first yokel he met in the lanes.</p>

<p>Linton was in truth three inches more than six feet in height,
but he had bowed himself to five feet eleven inches. His hair
shocked out in front like hay, and under it were two spectacled
eyes which never seemed to regard anything with particular
attention. His face was pale and full of hollows, and the mouth
apparently had no expression save a chronic pout of the under-lip.
His hands were large and raw boned but uncannily white. His whole
bent body was thin as that of a man from a long sick-bed, and all
was finished by two feet which for size could not be matched in the
county.</p>

<p>He was very awkward, but apparently it was not so much a
physical characteristic as it was a mental inability to consider
where he was going or what he was doing. For instance, when passing
through a gate it was not uncommon for him to knock his side
viciously against one of the posts. This was because he dreamed
almost always, and if there had been forty gates in a row he would
not then have noted them more than he did the one. As far as the
villagers and farmers were concerned he never came out of this
manner save in wide-apart cases, when he had forced upon him either
some great exhibition of stupidity or some faint indication of
double-dealing, and then this smouldering man flared out
encrimsoning his immediate surrounding with a brief fire of
ancestral anger. But the lapse back to indifference was more
surprising. It was far quicker than the flare in the beginning. His
feeling was suddenly ashes at the moment when one was certain it
would lick the sky.</p>

<p>Some of the villagers asserted that he was mad. They argued it
long in the manner of their kind, repeating, repeating, and
repeating, and when an opinion confusingly rational appeared they
merely shook their heads in pig-like obstinacy. Anyhow, it was
historically clear that no such squire had before been in the line
of Lintons of Oldrestham Hall, and the present incumbent was a
shock.</p>

<p>The servants at the Hall&mdash;notably those who lived in the
country-side&mdash;came in for a lot of questioning, and none were
found too backward in explaining many things which they themselves
did not understand. The household was most irregular. They all
confessed that it was really so uncustomary that they did not know
but what they would have to give notice. The master was probably
the most extraordinary man in the whole world. The butler said that
Linton would drink beer with his meals day in and day out like any
carrier resting at a pot-house. It didn't matter even if the meal
were dinner. Then suddenly he would change his tastes to the most
valuable wines, and in ten days would make the wine-cellar look as
if it had been wrecked at sea. What was to be done with a gentleman
of that kind? The butler said for his part he wanted a master with
habits, and he protested that Linton did not have a habit to his
name, at least, none that could properly be called a habit.</p>

<p>Barring the cook, the entire establishment agreed categorically
with the butler. The cook didn't agree because she was a very good
cook indeed, which she thought entitled her to be extremely aloof
from the other servants' hall opinions.</p>

<p>As for the squire's lady, they described her as being not much
different from the master. At least she gave support to his most
unusual manner of life, and evidently believed that whatever he
chose to do was quite correct.</p>

<p>Linton had written&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">"The garlands of her hair are snakes,<br>
Black and bitter are her hating eyes,<br>
A cry the windy death-hall makes,<br>
O, love, deliver us.<br>
The flung cup rolls to her sandal's tip,<br>
His arm&mdash;"</p>

<p>Whereupon his thought fumed over the next two lines, coursing
like greyhounds, after a fugitive vision of a writhening lover with
the foam of poison on his lips dying at the feet of the woman.
Linton arose, lit a cigarette, placed it on the window ledge, took
another cigarette, looked blindly for the matches, thrust a spiral
of paper into the flame of the log fire, lit the second cigarette,
placed it toppling on a book and began a search among his pipes for
one that would draw well. He gazed at his pictures, at the books on
the shelves, out at the green spread of country-side, all without
taking mental note. At the window ledge he came upon the first
cigarette, and in a matter of fact way he returned it to his lips,
having forgotten that he had forgotten it.</p>

<p>There was a sound of steps on the stone floor of the quaint
little passage that led down to his study, and turning from the
window he saw that his wife had entered the room and was looking at
him strangely.</p>

<p>"Jack," she said in a low voice, "what is the matter?"</p>

<p>His eyes were burning out from under his shock of hair with a
fierceness that belied his feeling of simple surprise. "Nothing is
the matter," he answered. "Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>She seemed immensely concerned, but she was visibly endeavouring
to hide her concern as well as to abate it.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I thought you acted queerly."</p>

<p>He answered: "Why no. I'm not acting queerly. On the contrary,"
he added smiling, "I'm in one of my most rational moods."</p>

<p>Her look of alarm did not subside. She continued to regard him
with the same stare. She was silent for a time and did not move.
His own thoughts had quite returned to a contemplation of a
poisoned lover, and he did not note the manner of his wife.
Suddenly she came to him, and laying a hand on his arm said, "Jack,
you are ill?"</p>

<p>"Why no, dear," he said with a first impatience, "I'm not ill at
all. I never felt better in my life." And his mind beleaguered by
this pointless talk strove to break through to its old
contemplation of the poisoned lover. "Hear what I have written."
Then he read&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">"The garlands of her hair are snakes,<br>
Black and bitter are her hating eyes,<br>
A cry the windy death-hall makes,<br>
O, love, deliver us.<br>
The flung cup rolls to her sandal's tip,<br>
His arm&mdash;"</p>

<p>Linton said: "I can't seem to get the lines to describe the man
who is dying of the poison on the floor before her. Really I'm
having a time with it. What a bore. Sometimes I can write like mad
and other times I don't seem to have an intelligent idea in my
head."</p>

<p>He felt his wife's hand tighten on his arm and he looked into
her face. It was so alight with horror that it brought him sharply
out of his dreams. "Jack," she repeated tremulously, "you are
ill."</p>

<p>He opened his eyes in wonder. "Ill! ill? No; not in the
least!"</p>

<p>"Yes, you are ill. I can see it in your eyes. You&mdash;act so
strangely."</p>

<p>"Act strangely? Why, my dear, what have I done? I feel quite
well. Indeed, I was never more fit in my life."</p>

<p>As he spoke he threw himself into a large wing chair and looked
up at his wife, who stood gazing at him from the other side of the
black oak table upon which Linton wrote his verses.</p>

<p>"Jack, dear," she almost whispered, "I have noticed it for
days," and she leaned across the table to look more intently into
his face. "Yes, your eyes grow more fixed every
day&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;your head, does it ache, dear?"</p>

<p>Linton arose from his chair and came around the big table toward
his wife. As he approached her, an expression akin to terror
crossed her face and she drew back as in fear, holding out both
hands to ward him off.</p>

<p>He had been smiling in the manner of a man reassuring a
frightened child, but at her shrinking from his outstretched hand
he stopped in amazement. "Why, Grace, what is it? tell me."</p>

<p>She was glaring at him, her eyes wide with misery. Linton moved
his left hand across his face, unconsciously trying to brush from
it that which alarmed her.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack, you must see some one; I am wretched about you. You
are ill!"</p>

<p>"Why, my dear wife," he said, "I am quite, quite well; I am
anxious to finish these verses but words won't come somehow, the
man dying&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, that is it, you cannot remember, you see that you cannot
remember. You must see a doctor. We will go up to town at once,"
she answered quickly.</p>

<p>"'Tis true," he thought, "that my memory is not as good as it
used to be. I cannot remember dates, and words won't fit in
somehow. Perhaps I don't take enough exercise, dear; is that what
worries you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, dear, you do not go out enough," said his wife. "You
cling to this room as the ivy clings to the walls&mdash;but we must
go to London, you <i>must</i> see some one; promise me that you
will go, that you will go immediately."</p>

<p>Again Linton saw his wife look at him as one looks at a creature
of pity. The faint lines from her nose to the corners of her mouth
deepened as if she were in physical pain; her eyes, open to their
fullest extent, had in them the expression of a mother watching her
dying babe. What was this strange wall that had suddenly raised
itself between them? Was he ill? No; he never was in better health
in his life. He found himself vainly searching for aches in his
bones. Again he brushed away this thing which seemed to be upon his
face. There must be something on my face, he thought, else why does
she look at me with such hopeless despair in her eyes; these kindly
eyes that had hitherto been so responsive to each glance of his
own. <i>Why</i> did she think that he was ill? She who knew well
his every mood. <i>Was he mad?</i> Did this thing of the poisoned
cup that rolled to her sandal's tip&mdash;and her eyes, her hating
eyes, mean that his&mdash;no, it could not be. He fumbled among the
papers on the table for a cigarette. He could not find one. He
walked to the huge fireplace and peered near-sightedly at the ashes
on the hearth.</p>

<p>"What, what do you want, Jack? Be careful! The fire!" cried his
wife.</p>

<p>"Why, I want a cigarette," he said.</p>

<p>She started, as if he had spoken roughly to her. "I will get you
some, wait, sit quietly, I will bring you some," she replied as she
hastened through the small passage-way up the stone steps that led
from his study.</p>

<p>Linton stood with his back still bent, in the posture of a man
picking something from the ground. He did not turn from the
fireplace until the echo of his wife's foot-fall on the stone
floors had died away. Then he straightened himself and said, "Well,
I'm damned!" And Linton was not a man who swore.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>A month later the Squire and his wife were on their way to
London to consult the great brain specialist, Doctor Redmond.
Linton now believed that "something" was wrong with him. His wife's
anxiety, which she could no longer conceal, forced him to this
conclusion; "something" was wrong. Until these few last weeks
Linton's wife had managed her household with the care and wisdom of
a Chatelaine of medival times. Each day was planned for certain
duties in house or village. She had theories as to the management
and education of the village children, and this work occupied much
of her time. She was the antithesis of her husband. He, a weaver of
dream-stories, she of that type of woman who has ideas of the
emancipation of women and who believe the problem could be solved
by training the minds of the next generation of mothers. Linton was
not interested in these questions, but he would smile indulgently
at his wife as she talked of the equality of mind of the sexes and
the public part in the world's history which would be played by the
women of the future.</p>

<p>There was no talk of this kind now. The household management
fell into the hands of servants. Night and day his wife watched
Linton. He would awaken in the night to find her face close to his
own, her eyes burning with feverish anxiety.</p>

<p>"What is it, Grace?" he would cry, "have I said anything? What
is the reason you watch me in this fashion, dear?"</p>

<p>And she would sob, "Jack, you are ill, dear, you are ill; we
must go to town, we must, indeed."</p>

<p>Then he would soothe her with fond words and promise that he
would go to London.</p>

<p>This present journey was the outcome of those weeks of watching
and fear in Linton's wife's mind.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>Linton's wife was trembling violently as he helped her down from
the cab in front of Doctor Redmond's door. They had made an
appointment, so that they were sure of little delay before the
portentous interview.</p>

<p>A small page in blue livery opened the door and ushered them
into a waiting-room. Mrs. Linton dropped heavily into a chair,
looking with a frightened air from side to side and biting her
under lip nervously. She was moaning half under her breath, "Oh,
Jack, you are ill, you are ill."</p>

<p>A short stout man with clean-shaven face and scanty black hair
entered the room. His nose was huge and misshapen and his mouth was
a straight firm line. Overhanging black brows tried in vain to
shadow the piercing dark eyes, that darted questioning looks at
every one, seeming to search for hidden thoughts as a flash-light
from the conning tower of a ship searches for the enemy in time of
war.</p>

<p>He advanced toward Mrs. Linton with outstretched hand. "Mrs.
Linton?" he said. "Ah!"</p>

<p>She almost jumped from her chair as he came near her, crying,
"Oh, doctor, my husband is ill, very ill, very ill!"</p>

<p>Again Doctor Redmond with his eyes fixed upon her face
ejaculated, "Ah!" Turning to Linton he said, "Please wait here,
Squire; I will first talk to your wife. Will you step into my
study, madam?" he said to Mrs. Linton, bowing courteously.</p>

<p>Linton's wife ran into the room which the doctor pointed toward
as his study.</p>

<p>Linton waited. He moved softly about the room looking at the
photographs of Greek ruins which adorned the walls. He stopped
finally before a large picture of the Gate of Hadrian. He travelled
once more into his dream country. His fancy painted in the figures
of men and women who had passed through that gate. He had forgotten
his fear of the blotting out of his mind that could conjure these
glowing colours. He had forgotten himself.</p>

<p>From this dream he was recalled to the present by a hand being
placed gently upon his arm. He half turned and saw the doctor
regarding him with sympathetic eyes.</p>

<p>"Come, my dear sir, come into my study," said the doctor. "I
have asked your wife to await us here." Linton then turned fully
toward the centre of the room and found that his wife was seated
quietly by a table. Doctor Redmond bowed low to Mrs. Linton as he
passed her, and Linton waved his hand, smiled, and said, "Only a
moment, dear." She did not reply. The door closed behind them.</p>

<p>"Be seated, my dear sir," said the doctor, drawing forward a
chair, "be seated. I want to say something to you, but you must
drink this first." He handed Linton a small glass of brandy.</p>

<p>Linton sat down, took the glass mechanically, and gulped the
brandy in one great swallow. The doctor stood by the mantel and
said slowly, "I rejoice to say to you, sir, that I have never met a
man more sound mentally than yourself"&mdash;</p>

<p>Linton half started from his chair.</p>

<p>"Stop!" said the doctor, "I have not yet finished&mdash;but it
is my painful duty to tell you the truth&mdash;It is your WIFE WHO
IS MAD! MAD AS A HATTER!"</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch9-2" id="ch9-2"></a>A Desertion</h3>

<p>The yellow gas-light that came with an effect of difficulty
through the dust-stained windows on either side of the door, gave
strange hues to the faces and forms of the three women who stood
gabbling in the hall-way of the tenement. They made rapid gestures,
and in the background their enormous shadows mingled in terrific
conflict.</p>

<p>"Aye, she ain't so good as he thinks she is, I'll bet. He can
watch over 'er an' take care of 'er all he pleases, but when she
wants t' fool 'im, she'll fool 'im. An' how does he know she ain't
foolin' 'im now?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he thinks he's keepin' 'er from goin' t' th' bad, he does.
Oh, yes. He ses she's too purty t' let run round alone. Too purty!
Huh! My Sadie&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, he keeps a clost watch on 'er, you bet. O'ny las' week,
she met my boy Tim on th' stairs, an' Tim hadn't said two words to
'er b'fore th' ol' man begin to holler. 'Dorter, dorter, come here,
come here!'"</p>

<p>At this moment a young girl entered from the street, and it was
evident from the injured expression suddenly assumed by the three
gossipers that she had been the object of their discussion. She
passed them with a slight nod, and they swung about into a row to
stare after her.</p>

<p>On her way up the long flights the girl unfastened her veil. One
could then clearly see the beauty of her eyes, but there was in
them a certain furtiveness that came near to marring the effects.
It was a peculiar fixture of gaze, brought from the street, as of
one who there saw a succession of passing dangers with menaces
aligned at every corner.</p>

<p>On the top floor, she pushed open a door and then paused on the
threshold, confronting an interior that appeared black and flat
like a curtain. Perhaps some girlish idea of hobgoblins assailed
her then, for she called in a little breathless voice,
"Daddie!"</p>

<p>There was no reply. The fire in the cooking-stove in the room
crackled at spasmodic intervals. One lid was misplaced, and the
girl could now see that this fact created a little flushed crescent
upon the ceiling. Also, a series of tiny windows in the stove
caused patches of red upon the floor. Otherwise, the room was
heavily draped with shadows.</p>

<p>The girl called again, "Daddie!"</p>

<p>Yet there was no reply.</p>

<p>"Oh, Daddie!"</p>

<p>Presently she laughed as one familiar with the humours of an old
man. "Oh, I guess yer cussin' mad about yer supper, dad," she said,
and she almost entered the room, but suddenly faltered, overcome by
a feminine instinct to fly from this black interior, peopled with
imagined dangers.</p>

<p>Again she called, "Daddie!" Her voice had an accent of appeal.
It was as if she knew she was foolish but yet felt obliged to
insist upon being reassured. "Oh, daddie!"</p>

<p>Of a sudden a cry of relief, a feminine announcement that the
stars still hung, burst from her. For, according to some mystic
process, the smouldering coals of the fire went aflame with sudden,
fierce brilliance, splashing parts of the walls, the floor, the
crude furniture, with a hue of blood-red. And in the light of this
dramatic outburst of light, the girl saw her father seated at a
table with his back turned toward her.</p>

<p>She entered the room, then, with an aggrieved air, her logic
evidently concluding that somebody was to blame for her nervous
fright. "Oh, yer on'y sulkin' 'bout yer supper. I thought mebbe
ye'd gone somewheres."</p>

<p>Her father made no reply. She went over to a shelf in the
corner, and, taking a little lamp, she lit it and put it where it
would give her light as she took off her hat and jacket in front of
the tiny mirror. Presently, she began to bustle among the cooking
utensils that were crowded into the sink, and as she worked she
rattled talk at her father, apparently disdaining his mood.</p>

<p>"I'd 'a come home earlier t'night, dad, o'ny that fly foreman,
he kep' me in th' shop 'til half-past six. What a fool. He came t'
me, yeh know, an' he ses, 'Nell, I wanta give yeh some brotherly
advice.' Oh, I know him an' his brotherly advice. 'I wanta give yeh
some brotherly advice. Yer too purty, Nell,' he ses, 't' be workin'
in this shop an' paradin' through the streets alone, without
somebody t' give yeh good brotherly advice, an' I wanta warn yeh,
Nell. I'm a bad man, but I ain't as bad as some, an' I wanta warn
yeh.' 'Oh, g'long 'bout yer business,' I ses. I know 'im. He's like
all of 'em, o'ny he's a little slyer. I know 'im. 'You g'long 'bout
yer business,' I ses. Well, he ses after a while that he guessed
some evenin' he'd come up an' see me. 'Oh, yeh will,' I ses, 'yeh
will? Well, you jest let my ol' man ketch yeh comin' foolin' 'round
our place. Yeh'll wish yeh went t' some other girl t' give
brotherly advice.' 'What th' 'ell do I care fer yer father?' he
ses. 'What's he t' me?' 'If he throws yeh down stairs, yeh'll care
for 'im,' I ses. 'Well,' he ses, 'I'll come when 'e ain't in, b'
Gawd, I'll come when 'e ain't in.' 'Oh, he's allus in when it means
takin' care 'a me,' I ses. 'Don't yeh fergit it either. When it
comes t' takin' care 'a his dorter, he's right on deck every single
possible time.'"</p>

<p>After a time, she turned and addressed cheery words to the old
man. "Hurry up th' fire, daddie! We'll have supper pretty
soon."</p>

<p>But still her father was silent, and his form in its sullen
posture was motionless.</p>

<p>At this, the girl seemed to see the need of the inauguration of
a feminine war against a man out of temper. She approached him
breathing soft, coaxing syllables.</p>

<p>"Daddie! Oh, Daddie! O&mdash;o&mdash;oh, Daddie!"</p>

<p>It was apparent from a subtle quality of valour in her tones
that this manner of onslaught upon his moods had usually been
successful, but to-night it had no quick effect. The words, coming
from her lips, were like the refrain of an old ballad, but the man
remained stolid.</p>

<p>"Daddie! My Daddie! Oh, Daddie are yeh mad at me,
really&mdash;truly mad at me!"</p>

<p>She touched him lightly upon the arm. Should he have turned then
he would have seen the fresh, laughing face, with dew-sparkling
eyes, close to his own.</p>

<p>"Oh, Daddie! My Daddie! Pretty Daddie!"</p>

<p>She stole her arm about his neck, and then slowly bended her
face toward his. It was the action of a queen who knows that she
reigns notwithstanding irritations, trials, tempests.</p>

<p>But suddenly, from this position, she leaped backward with the
mad energy of a frightened colt. Her face was in this instant
turned to a grey, featureless thing of horror. A yell, wild and
hoarse as a brute-cry, burst from her. "Daddie!" She flung herself
to a place near the door, where she remained, crouching, her eyes
staring at the motionless figure, spattered by the quivering
flashes from the fire. Her arms extended, and her frantic fingers
at once besought and repelled. There was in them an expression of
eagerness to caress and an expression of the most intense loathing.
And the girl's hair that had been a splendour, was in these moments
changed to a disordered mass that hung and swayed in witchlike
fashion.</p>

<p>Again, a terrible cry burst from her. It was more than the
shriek of agony&mdash;it was directed, personal, addressed to him
in the chair, the first word of a tragic conversation with the
dead.</p>

<p>It seemed that when she had put her arm about its neck, she had
jostled the corpse in such a way, that now she and it were face to
face. The attitude expressed an intention of arising from the
table. The eyes, fixed upon hers, were filled with an unspeakable
hatred.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>The cries of the girl aroused thunders in the tenement. There
was a loud slamming of doors, and presently there was a roar of
feet upon the boards of the stairway. Voices rang out sharply.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"What's th' matter?"</p>

<p>"He's killin' her!"</p>

<p>"Slug 'im with anythin' yeh kin lay hold of, Jack."</p>

<p>But over all this came the shrill shrewish tones of a woman.
"Ah, th' damned ol' fool, he's drivin' 'er inteh th'
street&mdash;that's what he's doin.' He's drivin' 'er inteh th'
street."</p>

<h3><a name="ch9-3" id="ch9-3"></a>How the Donkey Lifted the
Hills</h3>

<p>Many people suppose that the donkey is lazy. This is a great
mistake. It is his pride.</p>

<p>Years ago, there was nobody quite so fine as the donkey. He was
a great swell in those times. No one could express an opinion of
anything without the donkey showing where he was in it. No one
could mention the name of an important personage without the donkey
declaring how well he knew him.</p>

<p>The donkey was, above all things, a proud and aristocratic
beast.</p>

<p>One day a party of animals were discussing one thing and
another, until finally the conversation drifted around to
mythology.</p>

<p>"I have always admired that giant, Atlas," observed the ox in
the course of the conversation. "It was amazing how he could carry
things."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Atlas," said the donkey, "I knew him very well. I once
met a man and we got talking of Atlas. I expressed my admiration
for the giant and my desire to meet him some day, if possible.
Whereupon the man said there was nothing quite so easy. He was sure
that his dear friend, Atlas, would be happy to meet so charming a
donkey. Was I at leisure next Monday? Well, then, could I dine with
him upon that date? So, you see, it was all arranged. I found Atlas
to be a very pleasant fellow."</p>

<p>"It has always been a wonder to me how he could have carried the
earth on his back," said the horse.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear sir, nothing is more simple," cried the donkey.
"One has only to make up one's mind to it, and then&mdash;do it.
That is all. I am quite sure that if I wished I could carry a range
of mountains upon my back."</p>

<p>All the others said, "Oh, my!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I could," asserted the donkey, stoutly. "It is merely a
question of making up one's mind. I will bet."</p>

<p>"I will wager also," said the horse. "I will wager my ears that
you can't carry a range of mountains upon your back."</p>

<p>"Done," cried the donkey.</p>

<p>Forthwith the party of animals set out for the mountains.
Suddenly, however, the donkey paused and said, "Oh, but look here.
Who will place this range of mountains upon my back? Surely I can
not be expected to do the loading also."</p>

<p>Here was a great question. The party consulted. At length the ox
said, "We will have to ask some men to shovel the mountain upon the
donkey's back."</p>

<p>Most of the others clapped their hoofs or their paws and cried,
"Ah, that is the thing."</p>

<p>The horse, however, shook his head doubtfully. "I don't know
about these men. They are very sly. They will introduce some
deviltry into the affair."</p>

<p>"Why, how silly," said the donkey. "Apparently you do not
understand men. They are the most gentle, guileless creatures."</p>

<p>"Well," retorted the horse, "I will doubtless be able to escape
since I am not to be encumbered with any mountains. Proceed."</p>

<p>The donkey smiled in derision at these observations by the
horse.</p>

<p>Presently they came upon some men who were labouring away like
mad, digging ditches, felling trees, gathering fruits, carrying
water, building huts.</p>

<p>"Look at these men, would you," said the horse. "Can you trust
them after this exhibition of their depravity? See how each one
selfishly&mdash;"</p>

<p>The donkey interrupted with a loud laugh.</p>

<p>"What nonsense!"</p>

<p>And then he cried out to the men, "Ho, my friends, will you
please come and shovel a range of mountains upon my back?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Will you please come and shovel a range of mountains upon my
back?"</p>

<p>The men were silent for a time. Then they went apart and
debated. They gesticulated a great deal.</p>

<p>Some apparently said one thing and some another. At last they
paused and one of their number came forward.</p>

<p>"Why do you wish a range of mountains shovelled upon your
back?"</p>

<p>"It is a wager," cried the donkey.</p>

<p>The men consulted again. And as the discussion became older,
their heads went closer and closer together, until they merely
whispered, and did not gesticulate at all. Ultimately they cried,
"Yes, certainly we will shovel a range of mountains upon your back
for you."</p>

<p>"Ah, thanks," said the donkey.</p>

<p>"Here is surely some deviltry," said the horse behind his hoof
to the ox.</p>

<p>The entire party proceeded then to the mountains. The donkey
drew a long breath and braced his legs.</p>

<p>"Are you ready?" asked the men.</p>

<p>"All ready," cried the donkey.</p>

<p>The men began to shovel.</p>

<p>The dirt and stones flew over the donkey's back in showers. It
was not long before his legs were hidden. Presently only his neck
and head remained in view. Then at last this wise donkey vanished.
There had been made no great effect upon the range of mountains.
They still towered toward the sky.</p>

<p>The watching crowd saw a heap of dirt and stones make a little
movement and then was heard a muffled cry. "Enough! Enough! It was
not two ranges of mountains! It is not fair! It is not fair!"</p>

<p>But the men only laughed as they shovelled on.</p>

<p>"Enough! Enough! Oh, woe is me&mdash;thirty snow-capped peaks
upon my little back. Ah, these false, false men! Oh, virtuous,
wise, and holy men, desist."</p>

<p>The men again laughed. They were as busy as fiends with their
shovels.</p>

<p>"Ah, brutal, cowardly, accursed men; ah, good, gentle, and holy
men, please remove some of those damnable peaks. I will adore your
beautiful shovels forever. I will be slave to the beckoning of your
little fingers. I will no longer be my own donkey&mdash;I will be
your donkey."</p>

<p>The men burst into a triumphant shout and ceased shovelling.</p>

<p>"Swear it, mountain-carrier."</p>

<p>"I swear! I swear! I swear!"</p>

<p>The other animals scampered away then, for these men in their
plots and plans were very terrible. "Poor old foolish fellow,"
cried the horse; "he may keep his ears. He will need them to hear
and count the blows that are now to fall upon him."</p>

<p>The men unearthed the donkey. They beat him with their shovels.
"Ho, come on, slave." Encrusted with earth, yellow-eyed from
fright, the donkey limped toward his prison. His ears hung down
like leaves of the plantain during the great rain.</p>

<p>So, now, when you see a donkey with a church, a palace, and
three villages upon his back, and he goes with infinite slowness,
moving but one leg at a time, do not think him lazy. It is his
pride.</p>

<h3><a name="ch9-4" id="ch9-4"></a>A Man by the Name of Mud</h3>

<p>Deep in a leather chair, the Kid sat looking out at where the
rain slanted before the dull brown houses and hammered swiftly upon
an occasional lonely cab. The happy crackle from the great and
glittering fireplace behind him had evidently no meaning of content
for him. He appeared morose and unapproachable, and when a man
appears morose and unapproachable it is a fine chance for his
intimate friends. Three or four of them discovered his mood, and so
hastened to be obnoxious.</p>

<p>"What's wrong, Kid? Lost your thirst?"</p>

<p>"He can never be happy again. He has lost his thirst."</p>

<p>"That's right, Kid. When you quarrel with a man who can whip
you, resort to sarcastic reflection and distance."</p>

<p>They cackled away persistently, but the Kid was mute and
continued to stare gloomily at the street.</p>

<p>Once a man who had been writing letters looked up and said, "I
saw your friend at the Comique the other night." He waited a moment
and then added, "In back."</p>

<p>The Kid wheeled about in his chair at this information, and all
the others saw then that it was important. One man said with deep
intelligence, "Ho, ho, a woman, hey? A woman's come between the two
Kids. A woman. Great, eh?" The Kid launched a glare of scorn across
the room, and then turned again to a contemplation of the rain. His
friends continued to do all in their power to worry him, but they
fell ultimately before his impregnable silence.</p>

<p>As it happened, he had not been brooding upon his friend's
mysterious absence at all. He had been concerned with himself. Once
in a while he seemed to perceive certain futilities and lapsed them
immediately into a state of voiceless dejection. These moods were
not frequent.</p>

<p>An unexplained thing in his mind, however, was greatly
enlightened by the words of the gossip. He turned then from his
harrowing scrutiny of the amount of pleasure he achieved from
living, and settled into a comfortable reflection upon the state of
his comrade, the other Kid.</p>

<p>Perhaps it could be indicated in this fashion: "Went to Comique,
I suppose. Saw girl. Secondary part, probably. Thought her rather
natural. Went to Comique again. Went again. One time happened to
meet omnipotent and good-natured friend. Broached subject to him
with great caution. Friend said&mdash;'Why, certainly, my boy, come
round to-night, and I'll take you in back. Remember, it's against
all rules, but I think that in your case, etc.' Kid went. Chorus
girls winked same old wink. 'Here's another dude on the prowl.' Kid
aware of this, swearing under his breath and looking very stiff.
Meets girl. Knew beforehand that the footlights might have sold
him, but finds her very charming. Does not say single thing to her
which she naturally expected to hear. Makes no reference to her
beauty nor her voice&mdash;if she has any. Perhaps takes it for
granted that she knows. Girl don't exactly love this attitude, but
then feels admiration, because after all she can't tell whether he
thinks her nice or whether he don't. New scheme this. Worked by
occasional guys in Rome and Egypt, but still, new scheme. Kid goes
away. Girl thinks. Later, nails omnipotent and good-natured friend.
'Who was that you brought back?' 'Oh, him? Why, he&mdash;'
Describes the Kid's wealth, feats, and virtues&mdash;virtues of
disposition. Girl propounds clever question&mdash;'Why did he wish
to meet me?' Omnipotent person says, 'Damned if I know.'"</p>

<p>Later, Kid asks girl to supper. Not wildly anxious, but very
evident that he asks her because he likes her. Girl accepts; goes
to supper. Kid very good comrade and kind. Girl begins to think
that here at last is a man who understands her. Details
ambitions&mdash;long, wonderful ambitions. Explains her points of
superiority over the other girls of stage. Says their lives disgust
her. She wants to work and study and make something of herself. Kid
smokes vast number of cigarettes. Displays and feels deep sympathy.
Recalls, but faintly, that he has heard it on previous occasions.
They have an awfully good time. Part at last in front of apartment
house. "Good-night, old chap." "Good-night." Squeeze hands hard.
Kid has no information at all about kissing her good-night, but
don't even try. Noble youth. Wise youth. Kid goes home and smokes.
Feels strong desire to kill people who say intolerable things of
the girl in rows. "Narrow, mean, stupid, ignorant, damnable
people." Contemplates the broad, fine liberality of his experienced
mind.</p>

<p>Kid and girl become very chumy. Kid like a brother. Listens to
her troubles. Takes her out to supper regularly and regularly.
Chorus girls now tacitly recognise him as the main guy. Sometimes,
may be, girl's mother sick. Can't go to supper. Kid always very
noble. Understands perfectly the probabilities of there being
others. Lays for 'em, but makes no discoveries. Begins to wonder
whether he is a winner or whether she is a girl of marvellous
cleverness. Can't tell. Maintains himself with dignity, however.
Only occasionally inveighs against the men who prey upon the girls
of the stage. Still noble.</p>

<p>Time goes on. Kid grows less noble. Perhaps decides not to be
noble at all, or as little as he can. Still inveighs against the
men who prey upon the girls of the stage. Thinks the girl stunning.
Wants to be dead sure there are no others. Once suspects it, and
immediately makes the colossal mistake of his life. Takes the girl
to task. Girl won't stand it for a minute. Harangues him. Kid
surrenders and pleads with her&mdash;pleads with her. Kid's name is
mud.</p>

<h3><a name="ch9-5" id="ch9-5"></a>A Poker Game</h3>

<p>Usually a poker game is a picture of peace. There is no drama so
low-voiced and serene and monotonous. If an amateur loser does not
softly curse, there is no orchestral support. Here is one of the
most exciting and absorbing occupations known to intelligent
American manhood; here a year's reflection is compressed into a
moment of thought; here the nerves may stand on end and scream to
themselves, but a tranquillity as from heaven is only interrupted
by the click of chips. The higher the stakes the more quiet the
scene; this is a law that applies everywhere save on the stage.</p>

<p>And yet sometimes in a poker game things happen. Everybody
remembers the celebrated corner on bay rum that was triumphantly
consummated by Robert F. Cinch, of Chicago, assisted by the United
States Courts and whatever other federal power he needed. Robert F.
Cinch enjoyed his victory four months. Then he died, and young
Bobbie Cinch came to New York in order to more clearly demonstrate
that there was a good deal of fun in twenty-two million
dollars.</p>

<p>Old Henry Spuytendyvil owns all the real estate in New York save
that previously appropriated by the hospitals and Central Park. He
had been a friend of Bob's father. When Bob appeared in New York,
Spuytendyvil entertained him correctly. It came to pass that they
just naturally played poker.</p>

<p>One night they were having a small game in an up-town hotel.
There were five of them, including two lawyers and a politician.
The stakes depended on the ability of the individual fortune.</p>

<p>Bobbie Cinch had won rather heavily. He was as generous as
sunshine, and when luck chases a generous man it chases him hard,
even though he cannot bet with all the skill of his opponents.</p>

<p>Old Spuytendyvil had lost a considerable amount. One of the
lawyers from time to time smiled quietly, because he knew
Spuytendyvil well, and he knew that anything with the name of loss
attached to it sliced the old man's heart into sections.</p>

<p>At midnight Archie Bracketts, the actor, came into the room.
"How you holding 'em, Bob?" said he.</p>

<p>"Pretty well," said Bob.</p>

<p>"Having any luck, Mr. Spuytendyvil?"</p>

<p>"Blooming bad," grunted the old man.</p>

<p>Bracketts laughed and put his foot on the round of
Spuytendyvil's chair. "There," said he, "I'll queer your luck for
you." Spuytendyvil sat at the end of the table. "Bobbie," said the
actor, presently, as young Cinch won another pot, "I guess I better
knock your luck." So he took his foot from the old man's chair and
placed it on Bob's chair. The lad grinned good-naturedly and said
he didn't care.</p>

<p>Bracketts was in a position to scan both of the hands. It was
Bob's ante, and old Spuytendyvil threw in a red chip. Everybody
passed out up to Bobbie. He filled in the pot and drew a card.</p>

<p>Spuytendyvil drew a card. Bracketts, looking over his shoulder,
saw him holding the ten, nine, eight, and seven of diamonds.
Theatrically speaking, straight flushes are as frequent as berries
on a juniper tree, but as a matter of truth the reason that
straight flushes are so admired is because they are not as common
as berries on a juniper tree. Bracketts stared; drew a cigar slowly
from his pocket, and placing it between his teeth forgot its
existence.</p>

<p>Bobbie was the only other stayer. Bracketts flashed an eye for
the lad's hand and saw the nine, eight, six, and five of hearts.
Now, there are but six hundred and forty-five emotions possible to
the human mind, and Bracketts immediately had them all. Under the
impression that he had finished his cigar, he took it from his
mouth and tossed it toward the grate without turning his eyes to
follow its flight.</p>

<p>There happened to be a complete silence around the green-clothed
table. Spuytendyvil was studying his hand with a kind of
contemptuous smile, but in his eyes there perhaps was to be seen a
cold, stern light expressing something sinister and relentless.</p>

<p>Young Bob sat as he had sat. As the pause grew longer, he looked
up once inquiringly at Spuytendyvil.</p>

<p>The old man reached for a white chip. "Well, mine are worth
about that much," said he, tossing it into the pot. Thereupon he
leaned back comfortably in his chair and renewed his stare at the
five straight diamond. Young Bob extended his hand leisurely toward
his stack. It occurred to Bracketts that he was smoking, but he
found no cigar in his mouth.</p>

<p>The lad fingered his chips and looked pensively at his hand. The
silence of those moments oppressed Bracketts like the smoke from a
conflagration.</p>

<p>Bobbie Cinch continued for some moments to coolly observe his
cards. At last he breathed a little sigh and said, "Well, Mr.
Spuytendyvil, I can't play a sure thing against you." He threw in a
white chip. "I'll just call you. I've got a straight flush." He
faced down his cards.</p>

<p>Old Spuytendyvil's fear, horror, and rage could only be equalled
in volume to a small explosion of gasolene. He dashed his cards
upon the table. "There!" he shouted, glaring frightfully at Bobbie.
"I've got a straight flush, too! And mine is Jack high!"</p>

<p>Bobbie was at first paralysed with amazement, but in a moment he
recovered, and apparently observing something amusing in the
situation he grinned.</p>

<p>Archie Bracketts, having burst his bond of silence, yelled for
joy and relief. He smote Bobbie on the shoulder. "Bob, my boy," he
cried exuberantly, "you're no gambler, but you're a mighty good
fellow, and if you hadn't been you would be losing a good many
dollars this minute."</p>

<p>Old Spuytendyvil glowered at Bracketts. "Stop making such an
infernal din, will you, Archie," he said morosely. His throat
seemed filled with pounded glass. "Pass the whisky."</p>

<h3><a name="ch9-6" id="ch9-6"></a>The Snake</h3>

<p>Where the path wended across the ridge, the bushes of
huckle-berry and sweet fern swarmed at it in two curling waves
until it was a mere winding line traced through a tangle. There was
no interference by clouds, and as the rays of the sun fell full
upon the ridge, they called into voice innumerable insects which
chanted the heat of the summer day in steady, throbbing, unending
chorus.</p>

<p>A man and a dog came from the laurel thickets of the valley
where the white brook brawled with the rocks. They followed the
deep line of the path across the ridge. The dog&mdash;a large lemon
and white setter&mdash;walked, tranquilly meditative, at his
master's heels.</p>

<p>Suddenly from some unknown and yet near place in advance there
came a dry, shrill whistling rattle that smote motion instantly
from the limbs of the man and the dog. Like the fingers of a sudden
death, this sound seemed to touch the man at the nape of the neck,
at the top of the spine, and change him, as swift as thought, to a
statue of listening horror, surprise, rage. The dog, too&mdash;the
same icy hand was laid upon him, and he stood crouched and
quivering, his jaw dropping, the froth of terror upon his lips, the
light of hatred in his eyes.</p>

<p>Slowly the man moved his hands toward the bushes, but his glance
did not turn from the place made sinister by the warning rattle.
His fingers, unguided, sought for a stick of weight and strength.
Presently they closed about one that seemed adequate, and holding
this weapon poised before him, the man moved slowly forward,
glaring. The dog with his nervous nostrils fairly fluttering moved
warily, one foot at a time, after his master.</p>

<p>But when the man came upon the snake, his body underwent a shock
as if from a revelation, as if after all he had been ambushed. With
a blanched face, he sprang forward, and his breath came in strained
gasps, his chest heaving as if he were in the performance of an
extraordinary muscular trial. His arm with the stick made a
spasmodic, defensive gesture.</p>

<p>The snake had apparently been crossing the path in some mystic
travel when to his sense there came the knowledge of the coming of
his foes. The dull vibration perhaps informed him, and he flung his
body to face the danger. He had no knowledge of paths; he had no
wit to tell him to slink noiselessly into the bushes. He knew that
his implacable enemies were approaching; no doubt they were seeking
him, hunting him. And so he cried his cry, an incredibly swift
jangle of tiny bells, as burdened with pathos as the hammering upon
quaint cymbals by the Chinese at war&mdash;for, indeed, it was
usually his death-music.</p>

<p>"Beware! Beware! Beware!"</p>

<p>The man and the snake confronted each other. In the man's eyes
were hatred and fear. In the snake's eyes were hatred and fear.
These enemies man&oelig;uvred, each preparing to kill. It was to be
a battle without mercy. Neither knew of mercy for such a situation.
In the man was all the wild strength of the terror of his
ancestors, of his race, of his kind. A deadly repulsion had been
handed from man to man through long dim centuries. This was another
detail of a war that had begun evidently when first there were men
and snakes. Individuals who do not participate in this strife incur
the investigations of scientists. Once there was a man and a snake
who were friends, and at the end, the man lay dead with the marks
of the snake's caress just over his East Indian heart. In the
formation of devices, hideous and horrible, Nature reached her
supreme point in the making of the snake, so that priests who
really paint hell well fill it with snakes instead of fire. These
curving forms, these scintillant colourings create at once, upon
sight, more relentless animosities than do shake barbaric tribes.
To be born a snake is to be thrust into a place a-swarm with
formidable foes. To gain an appreciation of it, view hell as
pictured by priests who are really skilful.</p>

<p>As for this snake in the pathway, there was a double curve some
inches back of its head, which, merely by the potency of its lines,
made the man feel with tenfold eloquence the touch of the
death-fingers at the nape of his neck. The reptile's head was
waving slowly from side to side and its hot eyes flashed like
little murder-lights. Always in the air was the dry, shrill
whistling of the rattles.</p>

<p>"Beware! Beware! Beware!"</p>

<p>The man made a preliminary feint with his stick. Instantly the
snake's heavy head and neck were bended back on the double curve
and instantly the snake's body shot forward in a low, straight,
hard spring. The man jumped with a convulsive chatter and swung his
stick. The blind, sweeping blow fell upon the snake's head and
hurled him so that steel-coloured plates were for a moment
uppermost. But he rallied swiftly, agilely, and again the head and
neck bended back to the double curve, and the steaming, wide-open
mouth made its desperate effort to reach its enemy. This attack, it
could be seen, was despairing, but it was nevertheless impetuous,
gallant, ferocious, of the same quality as the charge of the lone
chief when the walls of white faces close upon him in the
mountains. The stick swung unerringly again, and the snake,
mutilated, torn, whirled himself into the last coil.</p>

<p>And now the man went sheer raving mad from the emotions of his
forefathers and from his own. He came to close quarters. He gripped
the stick with his two hands and made it speed like a flail. The
snake, tumbling in the anguish of final despair, fought, bit, flung
itself upon this stick which was taking his life.</p>

<p>At the end, the man clutched his stick and stood watching in
silence. The dog came slowly and with infinite caution stretched
his nose forward, sniffing. The hair upon his neck and back moved
and ruffled as if a sharp wind was blowing. The last muscular
quivers of the snake were causing the rattles to still sound their
treble cry, the shrill, ringing war chant and hymn of the grave of
the thing that faces foes at once countless, implacable, and
superior.</p>

<p>"Well, Rover," said the man, turning to the dog with a grin of
victory, "we'll carry Mr. Snake home to show the girls."</p>

<p>His hands still trembled from the strain of the encounter, but
he pried with his stick under the body of the snake and hoisted the
limp thing upon it. He resumed his march along the path, and the
dog walked, tranquilly meditative, at his master's heels.</p>

<h3><a name="ch9-7" id="ch9-7"></a>A Self-Made Man</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>An Example of Success that Any One can Follow</b>
</p>

<p>Tom had a hole in his shoe. It was very round and very
uncomfortable, particularly when he went on wet pavements. Rainy
days made him feel that he was walking on frozen dollars, although
he had only to think for a moment to discover he was not.</p>

<p>He used up almost two packs of playing cards by means of putting
four cards at a time inside his shoe as a sort of temporary sole,
which usually lasted about half a day. Once he put in four aces for
luck. He went down town that morning and got refused work. He
thought it wasn't a very extraordinary performance for a young man
of ability, and he was not sorry that night to find his packs were
entirely out of aces.</p>

<p>One day Tom was strolling down Broadway. He was in pursuit of
work, although his pace was slow. He had found that he must take
the matter coolly. So he puffed tenderly at a cigarette and walked
as if he owned stock. He imitated success so successfully, that if
it wasn't for the constant reminder (king, queen, deuce, and tray)
in his shoe, he would have gone into a store and bought
something.</p>

<p>He had borrowed five cents that morning off his landlady, for
his mouth craved tobacco. Although he owed her much for board, she
had unlimited confidence in him, because his stock of
self-assurance was very large indeed. And as it increased in a
proper ratio with the amount of his bills, his relations with her
seemed on a firm basis. So he strolled along and smoked with his
confidence in fortune in nowise impaired by his financial
condition.</p>

<p>Of a sudden he perceived on old man seated upon a railing and
smoking a clay pipe.</p>

<p>He stopped to look, because he wasn't in a hurry, and because it
was an unusual thing on Broadway to see old men seated upon
railings and smoking clay pipes.</p>

<p>And to his surprise the old man regarded him very intently in
return. He stared, with a wistful expression, into Tom's face, and
he clasped his hands in trembling excitement.</p>

<p>Tom was filled with astonishment at the old man's strange
demeanour. He stood puffing at his cigarette, and tried to
understand matters. Failing, he threw his cigarette away, took a
fresh one from his pocket, and approached the old man.</p>

<p>"Got a match?" he inquired, pleasantly.</p>

<p>The old man, much agitated, nearly fell from the railing as he
leaned dangerously forward.</p>

<p>"Sonny, can you read?" he demanded in a quavering voice.</p>

<p>"Certainly, I can," said Tom, encouragingly. He waived the
affair of the match.</p>

<p>The old man fumbled in his pocket. "You look honest, sonny. I've
been looking for an honest feller fur a'most a week. I've set on
this railing fur six days," he cried, plaintively.</p>

<p>He drew forth a letter and handed it to Tom. "Read it fur me,
sonny, read it," he said, coaxingly.</p>

<p>Tom took the letter and leaned back against the railings. As he
opened it and prepared to read, the old man wriggled like a child
at a forbidden feast.</p>

<p>Thundering trucks made frequent interruptions, and seven men in
a hurry jogged Tom's elbow, but he succeeded in reading what
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">Office of Ketchum R. Jones, Attorney-at-Law,<br>
Tin Can, Nevada, May 19, 18&mdash;.<br>
<br>
Rufus Wilkins, Esq.<br>
<br>
Dear Sir,&mdash;I have as yet received no acknowledgment of the
draft from the sale of the north section lots, which I forwarded to
you on 25th June. I would request an immediate reply concerning
it.<br>
<br>
Since my last I have sold the three corner lots at five thousand
each. The city grew so rapidly in that direction that they were
surrounded by brick stores almost before you would know it. I have
also sold for four thousand dollars the ten acres of out-laying
sage bush, which you once foolishly tried to give away. Mr.
Simpson, of Boston, bought the tract. He is very shrewd, no doubt,
but he hasn't been in the west long. Still, I think if he holds it
for about a thousand years, he may come out all right.<br>
<br>
I worked him with the projected-horse-car-line gag.<br>
<br>
Inform me of the address of your New York attorneys, and I will
send on the papers. Pray do not neglect to write me concerning the
draft sent on 25th June.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, I might say that if you have any eastern friends who
are after good western investments inform them of the glorious
future of Tin Can. We now have three railroads, a bank, an electric
light plant, a projected horse-car line, and an art society. Also,
a saw manufactory, a patent car-wheel mill, and a Methodist Church.
Tin Can is marching forward to take her proud stand as the
metropolis of the west. The rose-hued future holds no glories to
which Tin Can does not&mdash;</p>

<p>Tom stopped abruptly. "I guess the important part of the letter
came first," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," cried the old man, "I've heard enough. It is just as I
thought. George has robbed his dad."</p>

<p>The old man's frail body quivered with grief. Two tears trickled
slowly down the furrows of his face.</p>

<p>"Come, come, now," said Tom, patting him tenderly on the back.
"Brace up, old feller. What you want to do is to get a lawyer and
go put the screws on George."</p>

<p>"Is it really?" asked the old man, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Certainly, it is," said Tom.</p>

<p>"All right," cried the old man, with enthusiasm. "Tell me where
to get one." He slid down from the railing and prepared to start
off.</p>

<p>Tom reflected. "Well," he said, finally, "I might do for one
myself."</p>

<p>"What," shouted the old man in a voice of admiration, "are you a
lawyer as well as a reader?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Tom again, "I might appear to advantage as one. All
you need is a big front," he added, slowly. He was a profane young
man.</p>

<p>The old man seized him by the arm. "Come on, then," he cried,
"and we'll go put the screws on George."</p>

<p>Tom permitted himself to be dragged by the weak arms of his
companion around a corner and along a side street. As they
proceeded, he was internally bracing himself for a struggle, and
putting large bales of self-assurance around where they would be
likely to obstruct the advance of discovery and defeat.</p>

<p>By the time they reached a brown-stone house, hidden away in a
street of shops and warehouses, his mental balance was so admirable
that he seemed to be in possession of enough information and brains
to ruin half of the city, and he was no more concerned about the
king, queen, deuce, and tray than if they had been discards that
didn't fit his draw. He infused so much confidence and courage into
his companion, that the old man went along the street, breathing
war, like a decrepit hound on the scent of new blood.</p>

<p>He ambled up the steps of the brown-stone house as if he were
charging earthworks. He unlocked the door and they passed along a
dark hallway. In a rear room they found a man seated at table
engaged with a very late breakfast. He had a diamond in his shirt
front and a bit of egg on his cuff.</p>

<p>"George," said the old man in a fierce voice that came from his
aged throat with a sound like the crackle of burning twigs, "here's
my lawyer, Mr. er&mdash;ah&mdash;Smith, and we want to know what
you did with the draft that was sent on 25th June."</p>

<p>The old man delivered the words as if each one was a musket
shot. George's coffee spilled softly upon the tablecover, and his
fingers worked convulsively upon a slice of bread. He turned a
white, astonished face toward the old man and the intrepid
Thomas.</p>

<p>The latter, straight and tall, with a highly legal air, stood at
the old man's side. His glowing eyes were fixed upon the face of
the man at the table. They seemed like two little detective cameras
taking pictures of the other man's thoughts.</p>

<p>"Father, what d&mdash;do you mean," faltered George, totally
unable to withstand the two cameras and the highly legal air.</p>

<p>"What do I mean?" said the old man with a feeble roar as from an
ancient lion. "I mean that draft&mdash;that's what I mean. Give it
up or we'll&mdash;we'll"&mdash;he paused to gain courage by a
glance at the formidable figure at his side&mdash;"we'll put the
screws on you."</p>

<p>"Well, I was&mdash;I was only borrowin' it for 'bout a month,"
said George.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Tom.</p>

<p>George started, glared at Tom, and then began to shiver like an
animal with a broken back. There were a few moments of silence. The
old man was fumbling about in his mind for more imprecations.
George was wilting and turning limp before the glittering orbs of
the valiant attorney. The latter, content with the exalted
advantage he had gained by the use of the expression "Ah," spoke no
more, but continued to stare.</p>

<p>"Well," said George, finally, in a weak voice, "I s'pose I can
give you a cheque for it, 'though I was only borrowin' it for 'bout
a month. I don't think you have treated me fairly, father, with
your lawyers and your threats, and all that. But I'll give you the
cheque."</p>

<p>The old man turned to his attorney. "Well?" he asked.</p>

<p>Tom looked at the son and held an impressive debate with
himself. "I think we may accept the cheque," he said coldly after a
time.</p>

<p>George arose and tottered across the room. He drew a cheque that
made the attorney's heart come privately into his mouth. As he and
his client passed triumphantly out, he turned a last highly legal
glare upon George that reduced that individual to a mere paste.</p>

<p>On the side-walk the old man went into a spasm of delight and
called his attorney all the admiring and endearing names there were
to be had.</p>

<p>"Lord, how you settled him," he cried ecstatically.</p>

<p>They walked slowly back toward Broadway. "The scoundrel,"
murmured the old man. "I'll never see 'im again. I'll desert 'im.
I'll find a nice quiet boarding-place and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Tom. "I know one. I'll take you right
up," which he did.</p>

<p>He came near being happy ever after. The old man lived at
advanced rates in the front room at Tom's boarding-house. And the
latter basked in the proprietress' smiles, which had a commercial
value, and were a great improvement on many we see.</p>

<p>The old man, with his quantities of sage bush, thought Thomas
owned all the virtues mentioned in high-class literature, and his
opinion, too, was of commercial value. Also, he knew a man who knew
another man who received an impetus which made him engage Thomas on
terms that were highly satisfactory. Then it was that the latter
learned he had not succeeded sooner because he did not know a man
who knew another man.</p>

<p>So it came to pass that Tom grew to be Thomas G. Somebody. He
achieved that position in life from which he could hold out for
good wines when he went to poor restaurants. His name became
entangled with the name of Wilkins in the ownership of vast and
valuable tracts of sage bush in Tin Can, Nevada.</p>

<p>At the present day he is so great that he lunches frugally at
high prices. His fame has spread through the land as a man who
carved his way to fortune with no help but his undaunted pluck, his
tireless energy, and his sterling integrity.</p>

<p>Newspapers apply to him now, and he writes long signed articles
to struggling young men, in which he gives the best possible advice
as to how to become wealthy. In these articles, he, in a burst of
glorification, cites the king, queen, deuce, and tray, the four
aces, and all that. He alludes tenderly to the nickel he borrowed
and spent for cigarettes as the foundation of his fortune.</p>

<p>"To succeed in life," he writes, "the youth of America have only
to see an old man seated upon a railing and smoking a clay pipe.
Then go up and ask him for a match."</p>

<h3><a name="ch9-8" id="ch9-8"></a>A Tale of Mere Chance</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>Being an Account of the Pursuit of the Tiles, the
Statement of the Clock, and the Grip of a Coat of Orange Spots,
together with some Criticism of a Detective said to be Carved from
an Old Table-leg.</b>
</p>

<p>Yes, my friend, I killed the man, but I would not have been
detected in it were it not for some very extraordinary
circumstances. I had long considered this deed, but I am a delicate
and sensitive person, you understand, and I hesitated over it as
the diver hesitates on the brink of a dark and icy mountain pool. A
thought of the shock of the contact holds one back.</p>

<p>As I was passing his house one morning, I said to myself, "Well,
at any rate, if she loves him, it will not be for long." And after
that decision I was not myself, but a sort of a machine.</p>

<p>I rang the bell and the servants admitted me to the
drawing-room. I waited there while the old tall clock placidly
ticked its speech of time. The rigid and austere chairs remained in
possession of their singular imperturbability, although, of course,
they were aware of my purpose, but the little white tiles of the
floor whispered one to another and looked at me. Presently he
entered the room, and I, drawing my revolver, shot him. He
screamed&mdash;you know that scream&mdash;mostly
amazement&mdash;and as he fell forward his blood was upon the
little white tiles. They huddled and covered their eyes from this
rain. It seemed to me that the old clock stopped ticking as a man
may gasp in the middle of a sentence, and a chair threw itself in
my way as I sprang toward the door.</p>

<p>A moment later, I was walking down the street, tranquil, you
understand, and I said to myself, "It is done. Long years from this
day I will say to her that it was I who killed him. After time has
eaten the conscience of the thing, she will admire my courage."</p>

<p>I was elated that the affair had gone off so smoothly, and I
felt like returning home and taking a long, full sleep, like a
tired working man. When people passed me, I contemplated their
stupidity with a sense of satisfaction.</p>

<p>But those accursed little white tiles.</p>

<p>I heard a shrill crying and chattering behind me, and, looking
back, I saw them, blood-stained and impassioned, raising their
little hands and screaming "Murder! It was he!" I have said that
they had little hands. I am not sure of it, but they had some means
of indicating me as unerringly as pointing fingers. As for their
movement, they swept along as easily as dry, light leaves are
carried by the wind. Always they were shrilly piping their song of
my guilt.</p>

<p>My friend, may it never be your fortune to be pursued by a crowd
of little blood-stained tiles. I used a thousand means to be free
from the clash-clash of these tiny feet. I ran through the world at
my best speed, but it was no better than that of an ox, while they,
my pursuers, were always fresh, eager, relentless.</p>

<p>I am an ingenious person, and I used every trick that a
desperate, fertile man can invent. Hundreds of times I had almost
evaded them when some smouldering, neglected spark would blaze up
and discover me.</p>

<p>I felt that the eye of conviction would have no terrors for me,
but the eyes of suspicion which I saw in city after city, on road
after road, drove me to the verge of going forward and saying,
"Yes, I have murdered."</p>

<p>People would see the following, clamorous troops of
blood-stained tiles, and give me piercing glances, so that these
swords played continually at my heart. But we are a decorous race,
thank God. It is very vulgar to apprehend murderers on the public
streets. We have learned correct manners from the English. Besides,
who can be sure of the meaning of clamouring tiles? It might be
merely a trick in politics.</p>

<p>Detectives? What are detectives? Oh, yes, I have read of them
and their deeds, when I come to think of it. The prehistoric races
must have been remarkable. I have never been able to understand how
the detective navigated in stone boats. Still, specimens of their
pottery excavated in Taumalipas show a remarkable knowledge of
mechanics. I remember the little hydraulic&mdash;what's that? Well,
what you say may be true, my friend, but I think you dream.</p>

<p>The little stained tiles. My friend, I stopped in an inn at the
ends of the earth, and in the morning they were there flying like
little birds and pecking at my window.</p>

<p>I should have escaped. Heavens, I should have escaped. What was
more simple? I murdered and then walked into the world, which is
wide and intricate.</p>

<p>Do you know that my own clock assisted in the hunting of me?
They asked what time I left my home that morning, and it replied at
once, "Half-after eight." The watch of a man I had chanced to pass
near the house of the crime told the people "Seven minutes after
nine." And, of course, the tall, old clock in the drawing-room went
about day after day repeating, "Eighteen minutes after nine."</p>

<p>Do you say that the man who caught me was very clever? My
friend, I have lived long, and he was the most incredible blockhead
of my experience. An enslaved, dust-eating Mexican vaquero wouldn't
hitch his pony to such a man. Do you think he deserves credit for
my capture? If he had been as pervading as the atmosphere, he would
never have caught me. If he was a detective, as you say, I could
carve a better one from an old table-leg. But the tiles. That is
another matter. At night I think they flew in long high flock, like
pigeons. In the day, little mad things, they murmured on my trail
like frothy-mouthed weasels.</p>

<p>I see that you note these great, round, vividly orange spots on
my coat. Of course, even if the detective were really carved from
an old table-leg, he could hardly fail to apprehend a man thus
badged. As sores come upon one in the plague so came these spots
upon my coat. When I discovered them, I made effort to free myself
of this coat. I tore, tugged, wrenched at it, but around my
shoulders it was like a grip of a dead man's arms. Do you know that
I have plunged into a thousand lakes? I have smeared this coat with
a thousand paints. But day and night the spots burn like lights. I
might walk from this jail to-day if I could rid myself of this
coat, but it clings&mdash;clings&mdash;clings.</p>

<p>At any rate, the person you call a detective was not so clever
to discover a man in a coat of spotted orange, followed by
shrieking, blood-stained tiles. Yes, that noise from the corridor
is most peculiar. But they are always there, muttering and
watching, clashing and jostling. It sounds as if the dishes of
Hades were being washed. Yet I have become used to it. Once,
indeed, in the night, I cried out to them, "In God's name, go away,
little blood-stained tiles." But they doggedly answered, "It is the
law."</p>

<h3><a name="ch9-9" id="ch9-9"></a>At Clancy's Wake</h3>

<p>SCENE&mdash;<i>Room in the house of the lamented Clancy. The
curtains are pulled down. A perfume of old roses and whisky hangs
in the air. A weeping woman in black it seated at a table in the
centre. A group of wide-eyed children are sobbing in a corner. Down
the side of the room is a row of mourning friends of the family.
Through an open door can be seen, half hidden in shadows, the
silver and black of a coffin.</i></p>

<h3><a name="ch9-10" id="ch9-10"></a>An Episode of War</h3>

<p>The lieutenant's rubber blanket lay on the ground, and upon it
he had poured the company's supply of coffee. Corporals and other
representatives of the grimy and hot-throated men who lined the
breastwork had come for each squad's portion.</p>

<p>The lieutenant was frowning and serious at this task of
division. His lips pursed as he drew with his sword various
crevices in the heap until brown squares of coffee, astoundingly
equal in size, appeared on the blanket. He was on the verge of a
great triumph in mathematics, and the corporals were thronging
forward, each to reap a little square, when suddenly the lieutenant
cried out and looked quickly at a man near him as if he suspected
it was a case of personal assault. The others cried out also when
they saw blood upon the lieutenant's sleeve.</p>

<p>He has winced like a man stung, swayed dangerously, and then
straightened. The sound of his hoarse breathing was plainly
audible. He looked sadly, mystically, over the breastwork at the
green face of a wood, where now were many little puffs of white
smoke. During this moment the men about him gazed statue-like and
silent, astonished and awed by this catastrophe which happened when
catastrophes were not expected&mdash;when they had leisure to
observe it.</p>

<p>As the lieutenant stared at the wood, they too swung their
heads, so that for another instant all hands, still silent,
contemplated the distant forest as if their minds were fixed upon
the mystery of a bullet's journey.</p>

<p>The officer had, of course, been compelled to take his sword
into his left hand. He did not hold it by the hilt. He gripped it
at the middle of the blade, awkwardly. Turning his eyes from the
hostile wood, he looked at the sword as he held it there, and
seemed puzzled as to what to do with it, where to put it. In short,
this weapon had of a sudden become a strange thing to him. He
looked at it in a kind of stupefaction, as if he had been endowed
with a trident, a sceptre, or a spade.</p>

<p>Finally he tried to sheath it. To sheath a sword held by the
left hand, at the middle of the blade, in a scabbard hung at the
left hip, is a feat worthy of a sawdust ring. This wounded officer
engaged in a desperate struggle with the sword and the wobbling
scabbard, and during the time of it he breathed like a
wrestler.</p>

<p>But at this instant the men, the spectators, awoke from their
stone-like poses and crowded forward sympathetically. The
orderly-sergeant took the sword and tenderly placed it in the
scabbard. At the time, he leaned nervously backward, and did not
allow even his finger to brush the body of the lieutenant. A wound
gives strange dignity to him who bears it. Well men shy from this
new and terrible majesty. It is as if the wounded man's hand is
upon the curtain which hangs before the revelations of all
existence&mdash;the meaning of ants, potentates, wars, cities,
sunshine, snow, a feather dropped from a bird's wing; and the power
of it sheds radiance upon a bloody form, and makes the other men
understand sometimes that they are little. His comrades look at him
with large eyes thoughtfully. Moreover, they fear vaguely that the
weight of a finger upon him might send him headlong, precipitate
the tragedy, hurl him at once into the dim, grey unknown. And so
the orderly-sergeant, while sheathing the sword, leaned nervously
backward.</p>

<p>There were others who proffered assistance. One timidly
presented his shoulder and asked the lieutenant if he cared to lean
upon it, but the latter waved him away mournfully. He wore the look
of one who knows he is the victim of a terrible disease and
understands his helplessness. He again stared over the breastwork
at the forest, and then turning went slowly rearward. He held his
right wrist tenderly in his left hand as if the wounded arm was
made of very brittle glass.</p>

<p>And the men in silence stared at the wood, then at the departing
lieutenant&mdash;then at the wood, then at the lieutenant.</p>

<p>As the wounded officer passed from the line of battle, he was
enabled to see many things which as a participant in the fight were
unknown to him. He saw a general on a black horse gazing over the
lines of blue infantry at the green woods which veiled his
problems. An aide galloped furiously, dragged his horse suddenly to
a halt, saluted, and presented a paper. It was, for a wonder,
precisely like an historical painting.</p>

<p>To the rear of the general and his staff a group, composed of a
bugler, two or three orderlies, and the bearer of the corps
standard, all upon maniacal horses, were working like slaves to
hold their ground, preserve their respectful interval, while the
shells boomed in the air about them, and caused their chargers to
make furious quivering leaps.</p>

<p>A battery, a tumultuous and shining mass, was swirling toward
the right. The wild thud of hoofs, the cries of the riders shouting
blame and praise, menace and encouragement, and, last, the roar of
the wheels, the slant of the glistening guns, brought the
lieutenant to an intent pause. The battery swept in curves that
stirred the heart; it made halts as dramatic as the crash of a wave
on the rocks, and when it fled onward, this aggregation of wheels,
levers, motors, had a beautiful unity, as if it were a missile. The
sound of it was a war-chorus that reached into the depths of man's
emotion.</p>

<p>The lieutenant, still holding his arm as if it were of glass,
stood watching this battery until all detail of it was lost, save
the figures of the riders, which rose and fell and waved lashes
over the black mass.</p>

<p>Later, he turned his eyes toward the battle where the shooting
sometimes crackled like bush-fires, sometimes sputtered with
exasperating irregularity, and sometimes reverberated like the
thunder. He saw the smoke rolling upward and saw crowds of men who
ran and cheered, or stood and blazed away at the inscrutable
distance.</p>

<p>He came upon some stragglers, and they told him how to find the
field hospital. They described its exact location. In fact, these
men, no longer having part in the battle, knew more of it than
others. They told the performance of every corps, every division,
the opinion of every general. The lieutenant, carrying his wounded
arm rearward, looked upon them with wonder.</p>

<p>At the roadside a brigade was making coffee and buzzing with
talk like a girls' boarding-school. Several officers came out to
him and inquired concerning things of which he knew nothing. One,
seeing his arm, began to scold. "Why, man, that's no way to do. You
want to fix that thing." He appropriated the lieutenant and the
lieutenant's wound. He cut the sleeve and laid bare the arm, every
nerve of which softly fluttered under his touch. He bound his
handkerchief over the wound, scolding away in the meantime. His
tone allowed one to think that he was in the habit of being wounded
every day. The lieutenant hung his head, feeling, in this presence,
that he did not know how to be correctly wounded.</p>

<p>The low white tents of the hospital were grouped around an old
school-house. There was here a singular commotion. In the
foreground two ambulances interlocked wheels in the deep mud. The
drivers were tossing the blame of it back and forth, gesticulating
and berating, while from the ambulances, both crammed with wounded,
there came an occasional groan. An interminable crowd of bandaged
men were coming and going. Great numbers sat under the trees
nursing heads or arms or legs. There was a dispute of some kind
raging on the steps of the school-house. Sitting with his back
against a tree a man with a face as grey as a new army blanket was
serenely smoking a corn-cob pipe. The lieutenant wished to rush
forward and inform him that he was dying.</p>

<p>A busy surgeon was passing near the lieutenant. "Good-morning,"
he said, with a friendly smile. Then he caught sight of the
lieutenant's arm and his face at once changed. "Well, let's have a
look at it." He seemed possessed suddenly of a great contempt for
the lieutenant. This wound evidently placed the latter on a very
low social plane. The doctor cried out impatiently, "What
mutton-head had tied it up that way anyhow?" The lieutenant
answered, "Oh, a man."</p>

<p>When the wound was disclosed the doctor fingered it
disdainfully. "Humph," he said. "You come along with me and I'll
'tend to you." His voice contained the same scorn as if he were
saying, "You will have to go to jail."</p>

<p>The lieutenant had been very meek, but now his face flushed, and
he looked into the doctor's eyes. "I guess I won't have it
amputated," he said.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, man! Nonsense! Nonsense!" cried the doctor. "Come
along, now. I won't amputate it. Come along. Don't be a baby."</p>

<p>"Let go of me," said the lieutenant, holding back wrathfully,
his glance fixed upon the door of the old school-house, as sinister
to him as the portals of death.</p>

<p>And this is the story of how the lieutenant lost his arm. When
he reached home, his sisters, his mother, his wife, sobbed for a
long time at the sight of the flat sleeve. "Oh, well," he said,
standing shamefaced amid these tears, "I don't suppose it matters
so much as all that."</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch9-11" id="ch9-11"></a>The Voice of the Mountain</h3>

<p>The old man Popocatepetl was seated on a high rock with his
white mantle about his shoulders. He looked at the sky, he looked
at the sea, he looked at the land&mdash;nowhere could he see any
food. And he was very hungry, too.</p>

<p>Who can understand the agony of a creature whose stomach is as
large as a thousand churches, when this same stomach is as empty as
a broken water jar?</p>

<p>He looked longingly at some island in the sea. "Ah, those flat
cakes! If I had them." He stared at storm-clouds in the sky. "Ah,
what a drink is there." But the King of Everything, you know, had
forbidden the old man Popocatepetl to move at all, because he
feared that every footprint would make a great hole in the land. So
the old fellow was obliged to sit still and wait for his food to
come within reach. Any one who has tried this plan knows what
intervals lie between meals.</p>

<p>Once his friend, the little eagle, flew near, and Popocatepetl
called to him. "Ho, tiny bird, come and consider with me as to how
I shall be fed."</p>

<p>The little eagle came and spread his legs apart and considered
manfully, but he could do nothing with the situation. "You see," he
said, "this is no ordinary hunger which one goat will
suffice&mdash;"</p>

<p>Popocatepetl groaned an assent.</p>

<p>"&mdash;but it is an enormous affair," continued the little
eagle, "which requires something like a dozen stars. I don't see
what can be done unless we get that little creature of the
earth&mdash;that little animal with two arms, two legs, one head,
and a very brave air, to invent something. He is said to be very
wise."</p>

<p>"Who claims it for him?" asked Popocatepetl.</p>

<p>"He claims it for himself," responded the eagle.</p>

<p>"Well, summon him. Let us see. He is doubtless a kind little
animal, and when he sees my distress he will invent something."</p>

<p>"Good!" The eagle flew until he discovered one of these small
creatures. "Oh, tiny animal, the great chief Popocatepetl summons
you!"</p>

<p>"Does he, indeed!"</p>

<p>"Popocatepetl, the great chief," said the eagle again, thinking
that the little animal had not heard rightly.</p>

<p>"Well, and why does he summon me?"</p>

<p>"Because he is in distress, and he needs your assistance."</p>

<p>The little animal reflected for a time, and then said, "I will
go."</p>

<p>When Popocatepetl perceived the little animal and the eagle he
stretched forth his great, solemn arms. "Oh, blessed little animal
with two arms, two legs, a head, and a very brave air, help me in
my agony. Behold I, Popocatepetl, who saw the King of Everything
fashioning the stars, I, who knew the sun in his childhood, I,
Popocatepetl, appeal to you, little animal. I am hungry."</p>

<p>After a while the little animal asked: "How much will you
pay?"</p>

<p>"Pay?" said Popocatepetl.</p>

<p>"Pay?" said the eagle.</p>

<p>"Assuredly," quoth the little animal, "pay!"</p>

<p>"But," demanded Popocatepetl, "were you never hungry? I tell you
I am hungry, and is your first word then 'pay'?"</p>

<p>The little animal turned coldly away. "Oh, Popocatepetl, how
much wisdom has flown past you since you saw the King of Everything
fashioning the stars and since you knew the sun in his childhood? I
said pay, and, moreover, your distress measures my price. It is our
law. Yet it is true that we did not see the King of Everything
fashioning the stars. Nor did we know the sun in his
childhood."</p>

<p>Then did Popocatepetl roar and shake in his rage. "Oh,
louse&mdash;louse&mdash;louse! Let us bargain then! How much for
your blood?" Over the little animal hung death.</p>

<p>But he instantly bowed himself and prayed: "Popocatepetl, the
great, you who saw the King of Everything fashioning the stars, and
who knew the sun in his childhood, forgive this poor little animal.
Your sacred hunger shall be my care. I am your servant."</p>

<p>"It is well," said Popocatepetl at once, for his spirit was ever
kindly. "And now, what will you do?"</p>

<p>The little animal put his hand upon his chin and reflected.
"Well, it seems you are hungry, and the King of Everything has
forbidden you to go for food in fear that your monstrous feet will
riddle the earth with holes. What you need is a pair of wings."</p>

<p>"A pair of wings!" cried Popocatepetl delightedly.</p>

<p>"A pair of wings!" screamed the eagle in joy.</p>

<p>"How very simple, after all."</p>

<p>"And yet how wise!"</p>

<p>"But," said Popocatepetl, after the first outburst, "who can
make me these wings?"</p>

<p>The little animal replied: "I and my kind are great, because at
times we can make one mind control a hundred thousand bodies. This
is the secret of our performance. It will be nothing for us to make
wings for even you, great Popocatepetl. I and my kind will
come"&mdash;continued the crafty, little animal&mdash;"we will come
and dwell on this beautiful plain that stretches from the sea to
the sea, and we will make wings for you."</p>

<p>Popocatepetl wished to embrace the little animal. "Oh, glorious!
Oh, best of little brutes! Run! run! run! Summon your kind, dwell
in the plain and make me wings. Ah, when once Popocatepetl can soar
on his wings from star to star, then, indeed&mdash;"</p>

<p class="cp"><i>* * * * *</i>
</p>

<p>Poor old stupid Popocatepetl! The little animal summoned his
kind, they dwelt on the plains, they made this and they made that,
but they made no wings for Popocatepetl.</p>

<p>And sometimes when the thunderous voice of the old peak rolls
and rolls, if you know that tongue, you can hear him say: "Oh,
traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Where are my wings? My wings, traitor! I
am hungry! Where are my wings?"</p>

<p>But the little animal merely places his finger beside his nose
and winks.</p>

<p>"Your wings, indeed, fool! Sit still and howl for them! Old
idiot!"</p>

<h3><a name="ch9-12" id="ch9-12"></a>Why Did the Young Clerk
Swear?<br>
or, the Unsatisfactory French</h3>

<p>All was silent in the little gent's furnishing store. A lonely
clerk with a blonde moustache and a red necktie raised a languid
hand to his brow and brushed back a dangling lock. He yawned and
gazed gloomily at the blurred panes of the windows.</p>

<p>Without, the wind and rain came swirling round the brick
buildings and went sweeping over the streets. A horse-car rumbled
stolidly by. In the mud on the pavements, a few pedestrians
struggled with excited umbrellas.</p>

<p>"The deuce!" remarked the clerk. "I'd give ten dollars if
somebody would come in and buy something, if 'twere only cotton
socks."</p>

<p>He waited amid the shadows of the grey afternoon. No customers
came. He heaved a long sigh and sat down on a high stool. From
beneath a stack of unlaundried shirts he drew a French novel with a
picture on the cover. He yawned again, glanced lazily toward the
street, and settled himself as comfortable as the gods would let
him upon the high stool.</p>

<p>He opened the book and began to read. Soon it could have been
noticed that his blonde moustache took on a curl of enthusiasm, and
the refractory locks on his brow showed symptoms of soft
agitation.</p>

<p>"Silvere did not see the young girl for some days," read the
clerk. "He was miserable. He seemed always to inhale that subtle
perfume from her hair. At night he saw her eyes in the stars.</p>

<p>"His dreams were troubled. He watched the house. Heloise did not
appear. One day he met Vibert. Vibert wore a black frock-coat.
There were wine-stains on the right breast. His collar was soiled.
He had not shaved.</p>

<p>"Silvere burst into tears. 'I love her! I love her! I shall
die!' Vibert laughed scornfully. His necktie was second-hand.
Idiotic, this boy in love. Fool! Simpleton! But at last he pitied
him. She goes to the music-teacher's every morning. Silly Silvere
embraced him.</p>

<p>"The next day Silvere waited at the street corner. A vendor was
selling chestnuts. Two gamins were fighting in an alley. A woman
was scrubbing some steps. This great Paris throbbed with life.</p>

<p>"Heloise came. She did not perceive Silvere. She passed with a
happy smile on her face. She looked fresh, fair, innocent. Silvere
felt himself swooning. 'Ah, my God!'</p>

<p>"She crossed the street. The young man received a shock that
sent the warm blood to his brain. It had been raining. There was
mud. With one slender hand Heloise lifted her skirts. Silvere
leaning forward, saw her&mdash;"</p>

<p>A young man in a wet mackintosh came into the little gent's
furnishing store.</p>

<p>"Ah, beg pardon," said he to the clerk, "but do you have an
agency for a steam laundry here? I have been patronising a Chinaman
down th' avenue for some time, but he&mdash;what? No? You have none
here? Well, why don't you start one, anyhow? It'd be a good thing
in this neighbourhood. I live just round the corner, and it'd be a
great thing for me. I know lots of people who would&mdash;what? Oh,
you don't? Oh!"</p>

<p>As the young man in the wet mackintosh retreated, the clerk with
a blonde moustache made a hungry grab at the novel. He continued to
read: "Handkerchief fall in a puddle. Silvere sprang forward. He
picked up the handkerchief. Their eyes met. As he returned the
handkerchief, their hands touched. The young girl smiled. Silvere
was in ecstacies. 'Ah, my God!'</p>

<p>"A baker opposite was quarrelling over two sous with an old
woman.</p>

<p>"A grey-haired veteran with a medal upon his breast and a
butcher's boy were watching a dog-fight. The smell of dead animals
came from adjacent slaughter-houses. The letters on the sign over
the tinsmith's shop on the corner shone redly like great clots of
blood. It was hell on roller skates."</p>

<p>Here the clerk skipped some seventeen chapters descriptive of a
number of intricate money transactions, the moles on the neck of a
Parisian dressmaker, the process of making brandy, the milk-leg of
Silvere's aunt, life in the coal-pits, and scenes in the Chamber of
Deputies. In these chapters the reputation of the architect of
Charlemagne's palace was vindicated, and it was explained why
Heloise's grandmother didn't keep her stockings pulled up.</p>

<p>Then he proceeded: "Heloise went to the country. The next day
Silvere followed. They met in the fields. The young girl had donned
the garb of the peasants. She blushed. She looked fresh, fair,
innocent. Silvere felt faint with rapture. 'Ah, my God!'</p>

<p>"She had been running. Out of breath, she sank down in the hay.
She held out her hand. 'I am so glad to see you.' Silvere was
enchanted at this vision. He bended toward her. Suddenly he burst
into tears. 'I love you! I love you! I love you!' he stammered.</p>

<p>"A row of red and white shirts hung on a line some distance
away. The third shirt from the left had a button off the neck. A
cat on the rear steps of a cottage near the shirt was drinking milk
from a platter. The north-east portion of the platter had a crack
in it.</p>

<p>"'Heloise!' Silvere was murmuring hoarsely. He leaned toward her
until his warm breath moved the curls on her neck. 'Heloise!'
murmured Jean."</p>

<p>"Young man," said an elderly gentleman with a dripping umbrella
to the clerk with a blonde moustache, "have you any night-shirts
open front and back? Eh? Night-shirts open front and back, I said.
D'you hear, eh? <i>Night-shirts open front and back.</i> Well,
then, why didn't you say so? It would pay you to be a trifle more
polite, young man. When you get as old as I am, you will find out
that it pays to&mdash;what? I didn't see you adding any column of
figures. In that case I am sorry. You have no night-shirts open
front and back, eh? Well, good-day."</p>

<p>As the elderly gentleman vanished, the clerk with a blonde
moustache grasped the novel like some famished animal. He read on:
"A peasant stood before the two children. He wrung his hands. 'Have
you seen a stray cow?' 'No,' cried the children in the same breath.
The peasant wept. He wrung his hands. It was a supreme moment.</p>

<p>"'She loves me!' cried Silvere to himself, as he changed his
clothes for dinner.</p>

<p>"It was evening. The children sat by the fire-place. Heloise
wore a gown of clinging white. She looked fresh, fair, innocent.
Silvere was in raptures. 'Ah, my God!'</p>

<p>"Old Jean, the peasant, saw nothing. He was mending harness. The
fire crackled in the fire-place. The children loved each other.
Through the open door to the kitchen came the sound of old Marie
shrilly cursing the geese who wished to enter. In front of the
window two pigs were quarrelling over a vegetable. Cattle were
lowing in a distant field. A hay-waggon creaked slowly past.
Thirty-two chickens were asleep in the branches of a tree. This
subtle atmosphere had a mighty effect upon Heloise. It was beating
down her self-control. She felt herself going. She was choking.</p>

<p>"The young girl made an effort. She stood up. 'Good-night, I
must go.' Silvere took her hand. 'Heloise,' he murmured. Outside
the two pigs were fighting.</p>

<p>"A warm blush overspread the young girl's face. She turned wet
eyes toward her lover. She looked fresh, fair, innocent. Silvere
was maddened. 'Ah, my God!'</p>

<p>"Suddenly the young girl began to tremble. She tried vainly to
withdraw her hand. But her knee&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wish to get my husband some shirts," said a shopping-woman
with six bundles. The clerk with a blonde moustache made a private
gesture of despair, and rapidly spread a score of
different-patterned shirts upon the counter. "He's very particular
about his shirts," said the shopping-woman. "Oh, I don't think any
of these will do. Don't you keep the Invincible brand? He only
wears that kind. He says they fit him better. And he's very
particular about his shirts. What? You don't keep them? No? Well,
how much do you think they would come at?" "Haven't the slightest
idea." "Well, I suppose I must go somewhere else, then. Um,
good-day."</p>

<p>The clerk with the blonde moustache was about to make further
private gestures of despair, when the shopping-woman with six
bundles turned and went out. His fingers instantly closed nervously
over the book. He drew it from its hiding-place, and opened it at
the place where he had ceased. His hungry eyes seemed to eat the
words upon the page. He continued: "&mdash;struck cruelly against a
chair. It seemed to awaken her. She started. She burst from the
young man's arms. Outside the two pigs were grunting amiably.</p>

<p>"Silvere took his candle. He went toward his room. He was in
despair. 'Ah, my God!'</p>

<p>"He met the young girl on the stairs. He took her hand. Tears
were raining down his face. 'Heloise!' he murmured.</p>

<p>"The young girl shivered. As Silvere put his arms about her, she
faintly resisted. This embrace seemed to sap her life. She wished
to die. Her thoughts flew back to the old well and the broken
hayrakes at Plassans.</p>

<p>"The young girl looked fresh, fair, innocent 'Heloise!' murmured
Silvere. The children exchanged a long, clinging kiss. It seemed to
unite their souls.</p>

<p>"The young girl was swooning. Her head sank on the young man's
shoulder. There was nothing in space except these warm kisses on
her neck. Silvere enfolded her. 'Ah, my God!'"</p>

<p>"Say, young fellow," said a youth with a tilted cigar to the
clerk with a blonde moustache, "where th'll is Billie Carcart's
joint round here? Know?"</p>

<p>"Next corner," said the clerk fiercely.</p>

<p>"Oh, th'll," said the youth, "yehs needn't git gay. See! When a
feller asts a civil question yehs needn't git gay. See! Th'll!"</p>

<p>The youth stood and looked aggressive for a moment. Then he went
away.</p>

<p>The clerk seemed almost to leap upon the book. His feverish
fingers twirled the pages. When he found his place he glued his
eyes to it. He read:</p>

<p>"Then a great flash of lightning illumined the hall-way. It
threw livid hues over a row of flowerpots in the window-seat.
Thunder shook the house to its foundation. From the kitchen arose
the voice of old Marie in prayer.</p>

<p>"Heloise screamed. She wrenched herself from the young man's
arms. She sprang inside her room. She locked the door. She flung
herself face downward on the bed. She burst into tears. She looked
fresh, fair, innocent.</p>

<p>"The rain pattering upon the thatched roof sounded in the
stillness like the footsteps of spirits. In the sky toward Paris
there shone a crimson light.</p>

<p>"The chickens had all fallen from the tree. They stood, sadly,
in a puddle. The two pigs were asleep under the porch.</p>

<p>"Upstairs, in the hall-way, Silvers was furious."</p>

<p>The clerk with a blonde moustache gave here a wild scream of
disappointment. He madly hurled the novel with the picture on the
cover from him. He stood up and said: "Damn!"</p>

<h3><a name="ch9-13" id="ch9-13"></a>The Victory of the Moon</h3>

<p>The Strong Man of the Hills lost his wife. Immediately he went
abroad, calling aloud. The people all crouched afar in the dark of
their huts, and cried to him when he was yet a long distance away:
"No, no, great chief, we have not even seen the imprint of your
wife's sandal in the sand. If we had seen it, you would have found
us bowed down in worship before the marks of her ten glorious brown
toes, for we are but poor devils of Indians, and the grandeur of
the sun rays on her hair would have turned our eyes to dust."</p>

<p>"Her toes are not brown. They are pink," said the Strong Man
from the Hills. "Therefore do I believe that you speak the truth
when you say you have not seen her, good little men of the valley.
In this matter of her great loveliness, however, you speak a little
too strongly. As she is no longer among my possessions, I have no
mind to hear her praised. Whereabouts is the best man of you?"</p>

<p>None of them had stomach for this honour at the time. They
surmised that the Strong Man of the Hills had some plan for combat,
and they knew that the best of them would have in this encounter
only the strength of the meat in the grip of the fire. "Great
King," they said, in one voice, "there is no best man here."</p>

<p>"How is this?" roared the Strong Man. "There must be one who
excels. It is a law. Let him step forward then."</p>

<p>But they solemnly shook their heads. "There is no best man
here."</p>

<p>The Strong Man turned upon them so furiously that many fell to
the ground. "There must be one. Let him step forward." Shivering,
they huddled together and tried, in their fear, to thrust each
other toward the Strong Man.</p>

<p>At this time a young philosopher approached the throng slowly.
The philosophers of that age were all young men in the full heat of
life. The old greybeards were, for the most part, very stupid, and
were so accounted.</p>

<p>"Strong Man from the Hills," said the young philosopher, "go to
yonder brook and bathe. Then come and eat of this fruit. Then gaze
for a time at the blue sky and the green earth. Afterward I have
something to say to you."</p>

<p>"You are not so wise that I am obliged to bathe before listening
to you?" demanded the Strong Man, insolently.</p>

<p>"No," said the young philosopher. All the people thought this
reply very strange.</p>

<p>"Why, then, must I bathe and eat of fruit and gaze at the earth
and the sky?"</p>

<p>"Because they are pleasant things to do."</p>

<p>"Have I, do you think, any thirst at this time for pleasant
things?"</p>

<p>"Bathe, eat, gaze," said the young philosopher with a
gesture.</p>

<p>The Strong Man did, indeed, whirl his bronzed and terrible limbs
in the silver water. Then he lay in the shadow of a tree and ate
the cool fruit and gazed at the sky and the earth. "This is a fine
comfort," he said. After a time he suddenly struck his forehead
with his finger. "By the way, did I tell you that my wife had fled
from me?"</p>

<p>"I know it," said the young philosopher.</p>

<p>Later the Strong Man slept peacefully. The young philosopher
smiled.</p>

<p>But in the night the little men of the valley came clamouring:
"Oh, Strong Man of the Hills, the moon derides you!"</p>

<p>The philosopher went to them in the darkness. "Be still, little
people. It is nothing. The derision of the moon is nothing."</p>

<p>But the little men of the valley would not cease their uproar.
"Oh, Strong Man! Strong Man, awake! Awake! The moon derides
you!"</p>

<p>Then the Strong Man aroused and shook his locks away from his
eyes. "What is it, good little men of the valley?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Strong Man, the moon derides you! Oh, Strong Man!"</p>

<p>The Strong Man looked, and there, indeed, was the moon laughing
down at him. He sprang to his feet and roared. "Ah, old, fat, lump
of moon, you laugh! Have you seen my wife?"</p>

<p>The moon said no word, but merely smiled in a way that was like
a flash of silver bars.</p>

<p>"Well, then, moon, take this home to her," thundered the Strong
Man, and he hurled his spear.</p>

<p>The moon clapped both hands to its eye, and cried: "Oh! Oh!"</p>

<p>The little people of the valley cried: "Oh, this is terrible,
Strong Man! He has smitten our sacred moon in the eye!"</p>

<p>The young philosopher cried nothing at all.</p>

<p>The Strong Man threw his coat of crimson feathers upon the
ground. He took his knife and felt its edge. "Look you,
philosopher," he said. "I have lost my wife, and the bath, the meal
of fruit in the shade, the sight of sky and earth are still good to
me, but when this false moon derides me, there must be a
killing."</p>

<p>"I understand you," said the young philosopher.</p>

<p>The Strong Man ran off into the night. The little men of the
valley clapped their hands in ecstacy and terror. "Ah! ah! what a
battle will there be!"</p>

<p>The Strong Man went into his own hills and gathered there many
great rocks and trunks of trees. It was strange to see him erect
upon a peak of the mountains and hurling these things at the moon.
He kept the air full of them.</p>

<p>"Fat moon, come closer," he shouted. "Come closer, and let it be
my knife against your knife. Oh, to think that we are obliged to
tolerate such an old, fat, stupid, lazy, good-for-nothing moon. You
are ugly as death, while I&mdash;Oh, moon, you stole my beloved,
and it was nothing, but when you stole my beloved and laughed at
me, it became another matter. And yet you are so ugly, so fat, so
stupid, so lazy, so good-for-nothing. Ah, I shall go mad! Come
closer, moon, and let me examine your round, grey skull with this
club."</p>

<p>And he always kept the air full of great missiles.</p>

<p>The moon merely laughed, and said: "Why should I come
closer?"</p>

<p>Wildly did the Strong Man pile rock upon rock. He builded him a
tower that was the father of all towers. It made the mountains to
appear to be babes. Upon the summit of it he swung his great club
and flourished his knife.</p>

<p>The little men in the valley far below beheld a great storm, and
at the end of it they said: "Look, the moon is dead." The cry went
to and fro on the earth: "The moon is dead!"</p>

<p>The Strong Man went to the home of the moon. She, the sought
one, lay upon a cloud, and her little foot dangled over the side of
it. The Strong Man took this little foot in his two hands and
kissed it. "Ah, beloved!" he moaned, "I would rather this little
foot was upon my dead neck than that moon should ever have the
privilege of seeing it."</p>

<p>She leaned over the edge of the cloud and gazed at him. "How
dusty you are. Why do you puff so? Veritably, you are an ordinary
person. Why did I ever find you interesting?"</p>

<p>The Strong Man flung his knife into the air and turned back
toward the earth. "If the young philosopher had been at my elbow,"
he reflected, bitterly, "I would doubtless have gone at the matter
in another way. What does my strength avail me in this
contest?"</p>

<p>The battered moon, limping homeward, replied to the Strong Man
from the Hills: "Aye, surely. My weakness is in this thing as
strong as your strength. I am victor with ugliness, my age, my
stoutness, my laziness, my good-for-nothingness. Woman is woman.
Men are equal in everything save good fortune. I envy you not."</p>
