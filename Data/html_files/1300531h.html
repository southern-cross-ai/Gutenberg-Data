  <h2><a name="ch01"
     id="ch01"></a>I. &mdash;WHERE ENGLAND BEGINS</h2>

  <p class="first">The miracle of yesterday! Incredible&mdash;yet proved true
  now by every sound and sight and physical sensation. Mona Lightfoot uttered a
  little crow of delight; took her hands from the tiller to clap them together,
  and the small cutter slipped up into the wind and hung, her great sail
  flapping and all the life gone out of her.</p>

  <p>The young man in the bows, who was fishing his spinnaker out of the
  sail-locker, hooted his derision and, running over the crown of the cabin
  roof, sprang down into the cockpit.</p>

  <p>"Have I done wrong?" Mona asked with a penitence which was more than half
  mockery.</p>

  <p>"So much wrong that if this ship carried a yard arm we should be making at
  once for the three-mile limit."</p>

  <p>He brought the cutter on her course again with the sails full and bye.</p>

  <p>"Keep her so with the leach of the sail just quiver ing and between the
  buoys and the beacon." The young man was very nautical in his talk on this
  first morning of his holiday, and Mona Lightfoot laughed with pleasure. He
  had the boyishness of other young men; and for every sign that he was really
  like other young men her mind was eagerly alert.</p>

  <p>The cutter slid down the long channel of Poole Harbour; the dingy little
  yellow tavern, "The Margate Hoy," was no longer distinguishable upon the
  quay, and the cluster of deserted buildings which in those far-off days of
  the early nineties was Poole, dwindled over the counter into a blur. It was
  seven o'clock on a cool, silver morning in the first week of September,
  England's month. In a gap of land on the western side Corfe Castle black upon
  its pyramid stood out from the wall of the Purbeck Hills; on the east the
  pine trees and white sand of Canford Cliffs struck a milder and more modern
  note of history. The smooth lagoon of the harbour had the soft gleam of a
  mirror and split before the stem of the cutter with the tinkle of breaking
  glass. The sky spread dappled overhead, and the earth still very silent below
  it; and the air, fresh and lively, held the sure promise of a mellow sunlit
  day.</p>

  <p>The fairway curved in the midst of a little fleet of fishing boats and
  pleasure yachts towards the narrows between the big hotel upon the point and
  Brownsea Island. It seemed to Mona Lightfoot that she was passing through a
  gateway into a new and magical world. The kick of the tiller in her
  unpractised hands was a sheer delight.</p>

  <p>"I have the loveliest feeling that I am playing truant," she cried to the
  young man, who was now polishing the shining brass of his little ship with
  the care of a good groom for his horse. He looked at her with a quick smile
  of appreciation, which lit up a face of quite commonplace looks with a
  surprising grace.</p>

  <p>"I, too," he answered, and gazed about him, smell ing the sea. The yellow
  sand cliffs of Bournemouth, and a steamer smoking alongside the pier, dropped
  away upon their left. Studland's prettiness, the chalk arches and Old Harry,
  the chalk pillar, were deployed upon their right. And, white calling to
  white, in a diagonal line with Old Harry, the towering chalk down of the Isle
  of Wight caught the first of the sun light, spilt some of it upon the jagged
  Needles at its feet and tossed the rest across the bay to warm Old Harry.</p>

  <p>"Keep her straight, Mona, now between the striped buoys and the black
  cones," he cried. "I'll have finished in a minute or two. Then I'll relieve
  you at the tiller and you can cook our breakfasts."</p>

  <p>The <i>Sea Flower</i> was at once treasure and romance to young Mark
  Thewliss. Each increase in a steadily rising salary had been set aside for
  years against her building; the enthralling library of small boats and their
  adventures and their equipment had been studied as though each one of them
  was a classic, so that the exquisite creature might have no tiny omission or
  faulty taste to reproach him with; and when she at last took the sea from a
  slip at Salcombe in Devonshire, Thewliss passed his examination as
  master-mariner rather that she might be fitly commanded than to gratify any
  aspiration of his own. <i>Sea Flower</i> was now in her second year, a cutter
  of nine tons by Thames measurement, built of oak, coppered below the water
  line, with a teak deck, a lead keel&mdash;nothing but lead would satisfy Mark
  Thewliss, though the expense of it cramped him for a whole year of his
  working life&mdash;and a set of sails dainty enough for any racer in the
  Solent. He had had her built with a spoon bow, a broad beam and a long
  counter so that she might be safe in a heavy sea with a strong following
  wind; and since she was meant for single-handed cruising, every sheet was
  brought aft to the cockpit. She was painted black with a gold line, and she
  answered to her tiller as a polo pony to a touch of the snaffle.</p>

  <p><i>Sea Flower</i> had this great merit too. Being built for single-handed
  work, she had no forecastle. She could afford an unexpectedly spacious saloon
  with a cambered roof and two little doors at the forward end of it, that on
  the left opening into a tiny kitchen and pan try, that on the right into a
  lavatory. There was even a bath under the floor. Two steps led down from the
  cockpit, giving thus six feet of headroom in the saloon; and the mahogany
  doors were edged with rubber and watertight. She had a small tank of drinking
  water at the back of one side of the cockpit, and she carried a couple of
  beakers besides in rockers on her deck. Her larder for fresh meat was
  arranged after the fashion of the North Sea fishing trawlers&mdash;a cask
  with a lid, screwed to the deck behind the main-mast and ventilated with
  holes made by a large auger. But on the <i>Sea Flower</i>, the cask was a
  super-cask&mdash;a barrel of ripe oak bound with hoops of brass.</p>

  <p>Thewliss stowed his spinnaker sail ready to his hand before he came aft to
  the cockpit. He was still, indeed, on the camber of the cabin roof when he
  stopped suddenly with a look of surprise upon his face.</p>

  <p>"Have I done wrong again?" Mona Lightfoot asked.</p>

  <p>"No," he answered, and again his smile gave life and illumination to his
  face. "I was remembering that last year I sailed to Cherbourg and Guernsey
  and the Scilly Isles. And I never realised to this moment what a lonely
  business it must have been."</p>

  <p>He sprang down into the cockpit as he spoke, and so did not see the colour
  spread over the girl's face and the sudden blossom of tenderness in her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"That's Durlstone Head," he said with the broad accent of all the
  longshoremen who had ever lived. He pointed to the great promontory beyond
  Swanage Bay where a huge stone ball hung poised upon a green shoulder. He
  told her the legend of that stone ball as it is known to all hands in
  coasting craft; how the owner of the house upon the head had spent his life
  having the map of the world and its oceans carved in an exact proportion upon
  it, and how he had blown out his brains in despair when the work was done,
  because a tiny islet in the Red Sea was half an inch out of its proper place.
  "Now cook the breakfast, Mona, or we shall find ourselves in the Race before
  it's ready. Crisp bacon and coffee hot enough to scald the mouth. You'll find
  fresh rolls and butter in the cupboard by the settee." He took the tiller
  from her and added with a laugh:</p>

  <p>"We have got the best wind we could wish for. I put it all down to your
  yachting cap. Run along!"</p>

  <p>Mona Lightfoot took a look at herself in the mirror of the saloon before
  she set about preparing breakfast. She was a tall girl with copper coloured
  hair and big dark eyes clear as the morning set wide apart under a low broad
  forehead. She had a straight delicately chiselled nose, a mouth rather large,
  a short upper lip and a rounded chin. There was too much of character in her
  face for prettiness; but there were moments when it was lovely; and always it
  had a curiously appealing look as of one destined somehow for great
  unhappiness. Even now, as her eyes danced and she set the yachting cap still
  more jauntily to the thick waves of hair, it was there for those who had eyes
  to see. A moment later and the blind could almost have seen it. For she
  caught her breath and stood with her lips parted and a hand upon her heart,
  like someone on the edge of a perilous dive into dark and unknown waters.</p>

  <p>She had planned to sit quietly down somewhere apart&mdash;forward for
  choice, above the hiss and sparkle of the water at the bows&mdash;and fix
  each instant of the miraculous yesterday, with its burnish still upon it, for
  ever in her memories. A golden pattern which must throw some glimmer of light
  ahead of her even if the thread of her life led her deep into the catacombs.
  But there was too much to do. Breakfast had to be cooked&mdash;and such a
  breakfast as would make one sorry for the angels. It had to be eaten and
  cleared away, and the plates washed and stored safely in their
  racks&mdash;all before some mysterious and hostile thing called "The Race"
  enveloped them.</p>

  <p><i>Sea Flower</i> was full of gadgets. A small folding table could be set
  into slots in the floor of the cockpit, and upon this, covered with a fine
  white cloth, break fast was laid. Coffee of a fragrance unknown within the
  four walls of a room; bacon in thin crisp slices fried in its fat with eggs,
  just tinged with brown, lolling on the top of them; hot rolls and fresh
  butter in a big wedge instead of mean little meagre pats; marmalade with
  thick cubes of brown peel; and honey in the comb, with Ribston Pippins from
  Hereford and Cape plums for dessert.</p>

  <p>Mona Lightfoot was to see in use now another contrivance of which Mark
  Thewliss was inordinately vain. From the combing of the cockpit underneath
  the tiller a long curved steel bar hung down with a hinge at each end.
  Thewliss lifted the bar until it stood out horizontally, a segment of a
  circle where springs at the hinges caught it and held it firm. On the inside
  of this segment there was a steel plate, shaped and fixed to the curve of the
  bar and notched like the parapet of a castle wall. Thewliss raised this plate
  until it stood perpendicularly on the bar and clamped it in that position
  with a couple of strong screws.</p>

  <p>"There!" he said proudly when he had finished He was contemplating an arc
  of steel with grooves like the rowlocks of a boat reaching side by side
  across the radius of the tiller's movements. He now dropped the long wooden
  arm into one of these grooves. "You see, she'll sail herself now. Unless the
  wind changes, she'll keep her course. It's handier than lashing your helm if
  you are alone and want to go to bed."</p>

  <p>He moved to a seat opposite to Mona Lightfoot, and they breakfasted in
  comfort as the little ship ran past Swanage with the wind fair on her
  quarter. Mona lifted her eyes to the curve of the parade, where already the
  visitors were astir. She snuggled her shoulders against the cushions:</p>

  <p>"Poor people! I am sorry for them."</p>

  <p>"Better than Bexhill, eh?" Thewliss asked with a laugh.</p>

  <p>"Oh! A million times!"</p>

  <p>Yet but for the wonder of yesterday, Bexhill it would have been for her.
  The parade and the band, the boarding house and its chance acquaintances, the
  pier and the cinema&mdash;she shut her eyes, as the mere thought of these
  seaside joys brought upon her a sense of listlessness and fatigue; and opened
  them with an anxious start to make sure that meanwhile the bay and Durlstone
  Point, the little ship and its captain had not vanished into space.</p>

  <p>"Dreaming?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered.</p>

  <p>"No time for that! Look!"</p>

  <p>He pointed forward; and Mona, gazing out beneath the boom of the big sail,
  saw a towering and stately promontory slide out beyond Durlstone Point and a
  jumble of dark water stream in a line from it seawards.</p>

  <p>"St. Alban's Head," he cried.</p>

  <p>Mona could clap her hands together now, and with a laugh of merriment she
  did.</p>

  <p>"Where England begins," she answered mockingly.</p>

  <p>"You'll see. Meanwhile&mdash;I hate to mention it, my dear&mdash;but if we
  get into the Race like this, there won't be much of our crockery left when we
  get out of it."</p>

  <p>Mona Lightfoot jumped up in remorse, and carried the breakfast table and
  its equipment into the cabin. By the time the plates were stowed in their
  racks, the cups hung up upon their hooks, and she herself out again in the
  cockpit, the great cliff overhung them, the waves were breaking viciously
  ahead of them and the roar of tumbling waters was in their ears.</p>

  <p>"It won't be so bad," Thewliss shouted. "We're well in shore for one
  thing. For another the wind must be off shore for the Race to be really
  up."</p>

  <p>But even as he spoke, <i>Sea Flower</i> drove in among the breakers; and
  Mona had to clutch the combing of the cockpit and set the rubber soles of her
  shoes firmly upon the floor to keep herself from being thrown across the
  boat. Thewliss, with the tiller in his hand, did his best. He guided his
  cutter so far as he could without risking a gybe to the little valleys and
  passes in the crests of those changing ridges. But from every side they
  attacked the cutter, slapping it as though it were a wayward urchin, rolling
  it as though it were a barrel. One moment Mona Lightfoot had an impression of
  a puppy fighting with a slipper; the next, as the stem dipped into the sea
  and flung back a sparkling cloud of spray which spattered on the deck, of a
  horse that drops its head and then tosses a silver mane. Every now and then
  the big main sail swung inboard and out again with a rattle of its blocks and
  a jerk upon the sheets which shook the ship; and then in a second the roar
  and jostle fell away behind them and the cutter was running over a smoothly
  rippling sea.</p>

  <p>Thewliss set the spinnaker now and resumed his seat at the tiller. Far
  away to the south-west the black mass of Portland lay brooding high over the
  sun lit passage to the oceans. To the north of it the little wooded pinnacle
  of the Nothe rose from the smooth mirror of Weymouth Bay with the curious
  effect of a mirage in the desert. And beside them flitted the Dorset Coast:
  white cliffs like a chain of pyramids, backed by high slopes of downland,
  with here and there a mustard field yellow amongst the green, and here and
  there little villages gleaming like children's toys. And in every small
  upland dell between the pyramids, thick coppices of trees clustered to the
  very edge of the cliffs like animals going down to water at a river. To Mona
  Lightfoot it seemed that she breathed a different air. There was a difference
  in the very quality of the country's beauty. She sat in an ecstasy, her hands
  clasped upon her knees, her eyes wide with delight, and a feeling of pity
  stealing over her now and then for all those poor people to whom the coast
  line of western England was no more than a succession of names upon a
  map.</p>

  <p>That marvellous yesterday was, after all, only the blossom of which to-day
  was the opening flower.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch02"
     id="ch02"></a>II. &mdash;AT THE LILY POND</h2>

  <p class="first">Mona Lightfoot had left Liverpool at eight o'clock in the
  morning of the first day of her month's holiday. She was twenty-three years
  old and her position was that of typist, secretary and sole clerk to Mr.
  Henry Perriton, an accountant of that city in a small way of business. Mr.
  Perriton, indeed, even at this early hour was on the platform to see his
  secretary off&mdash;an attention which she received with some inward
  irritation. He was a sandy, insignificant man, ten years older than Mona; and
  when he raised his hat she noticed for the hundredth time how thin the hair
  was growing upon his scalp. He raised his hat awkwardly, not really because
  he wore it in his office and was unaccustomed to take it off, but because he
  held in one hand a packet of chocolate, in the other a bunch of flowers.</p>

  <p>"For me?" cried Mona without achieving any high expression of
  enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"For you, my dear."</p>

  <p>He laid them on the seat of the third class carriage in front of her.</p>

  <p>"I shall miss you terribly," he continued. "I never thought when you came
  to me in January that&mdash;well&mdash;it would be like this. If only you
  could have chosen New Brighton for your holiday, or Morecambe, I could have
  run out week-ends and seen a little of you."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but of course it had to be Bexhill."</p>

  <p>She was gently indulgent, forgiving him for his ignorance that it must be
  Bexhill, and not explaining to him that it had to be Bexhill, because since
  Bexhill was on the south coast, it was necessary to pass through London to
  reach it.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it had," Mr. Perriton answered despondently, and the train
  moved out of the station.</p>

  <p>Mona Lightfoot tried honestly to feel remorse as she contemplated Mr.
  Perriton's offerings on the seat opposite, but she could not. She was gripped
  by an excitement of her own. She too knew despondency as the train swept
  through the Black Country, but she swung out of it into the high spheres of
  hope. She asked for half an hour, an hour at the most to pay for the last
  bleak eight months. It wasn't much. She wasn't presumptuous in praying for
  it. Surely so tiny a prayer would be granted to her.</p>

  <p>She had certainly made her plans. As soon as the train stopped at Euston
  she was out of the carriage with a suit-case in each hand. She climbed into a
  hansom cab and gave an address in Bloomsbury.</p>

  <p>"Miss Tipper wrote to me that I might use her room," she explained to the
  landlady.</p>

  <p>"Yes, miss."</p>

  <p>Mary Tipper had been Mona's friend and senior on the staff of the firm of
  Mardyke and Campion until last December, when William Mardyke, now the entire
  firm, had in a panic reduced his expenditure by twenty-five per cent.</p>

  <p>In Mary Tipper's bedroom Mona washed off the dust of her journey, arrayed
  herself in her best summer frock, a cunningly simple affair of dark blue
  silk, with a blue hat to match, put on her tan shoes and stockings, and took
  into her hand a pair of long tan gloves. She left a note for Mary Tipper
  saying that she would come back for tea and, stepping up into an omnibus,
  travelled eastwards to High Holborn.</p>

  <p>Where the vast Prudential House now glows in all its assurance over High
  Holborn, in those days stood Furnival's Inn. A red house, too, but comely and
  modest and mellowed to a sober russet on which the eyes rested with pleasure.
  It was built about a quadrangle, with a wall and iron gates upon the street.
  The traveller could put up there for the night, the resident take chambers by
  the year. Opposite Furnival's Inn Mona Lightfoot descended and, crossing the
  road through the crowded traffic of drays, omnibuses, growlers and jingling
  hansoms, she reached the point where under a long facade of projecting eaves
  a gate way opened into a court paved with stone and planted with trees.
  Staple Inn. She walked beneath a second arch and so came, one half of her
  mind eager with expectation, the other half assured of disappointment, into a
  lovely corner of Tudor London, hidden away in a wilderness of yellow brick. A
  little square of oblong windows through which one had glimpses of panelled
  walls; a pavement of stone flags; a round lily pond where the great flowers
  floated, their golden hearts like fruit upon their delicate platters which
  here were white as the breast of a swan, there took on about their edges
  tender colours of pink and mauve; a tiny garden; a fountain cooling the air;
  on one side a little hall with stained glass windows, like the hall of a
  college reduced to a toy; a cupola with a bell above the hall roof and a
  great clock in the miniature of a tower; on the other side a stone arbour
  with a couple of steps down to the lily-pond; and everywhere peace,
  everywhere quiet, as though the lilies had dreamed there in an enchanted
  sleep ever since Queen Elizabeth had ridden by with her halberdiers and her
  torch-bearers to St. Paul's Church or Gresham's Exchange. The inner court of
  Staple Inn; and it was empty as Mona Lightfoot entered it.</p>

  <p>She looked at the clock. Well it was barely one. She would wait five, ten
  minutes. She sat down upon the round stone coping of the pond; and as the
  hands of the clock crept forward, a sense of desolation crept over her.</p>

  <p>"He will have left the office...Perhaps he doesn't come here any
  more...Five more minutes...I came to London for this...an experiment may be
  detaining him..." Thus her thoughts ran, and she heard his footsteps on the
  stone flags behind her, almost before they sounded there at all. She bent
  forward towards her own reflection in the pond with the colour rosy in her
  cheeks. She heard him approach, she knew that he stood beside her, almost
  touching her, quite unaware of her. A little pang of disappointment&mdash;she
  acknowledged it to be quite un reasonable after all these
  months&mdash;mingled with her pleasure. She raised her eyes at last.</p>

  <p>"Mark!"</p>

  <p>His eyes came slowly down to meet hers.</p>

  <p>"Mona!"</p>

  <p>There was surprise, there was friendliness in his voice. Mona Lightfoot
  had been bred in a world where it was wisdom to face facts at once. There was
  no leap of the heart in Mark's pronunciation of her name.</p>

  <p>"I should have known you," he said. "But I was wondering for the
  thousandth time..."</p>

  <p>"I know. Whether you would ever reproduce those delicate colours," she
  took him up with a laugh, as she pointed to the outspread petals of the
  lilies.</p>

  <p>Mark Thewliss nodded, and laughed in unison. A sudden exhilaration lifted
  his spirits.</p>

  <p>"You are back in London, then?" he cried.</p>

  <p>There would be someone once more to whom he could relate his difficulties
  and ambitions, who by the mere act of listening with all her sympathies in
  her eyes would smooth out the one and help forward the other, and sometimes
  by some swift stroke of insight give there and then first-aid.</p>

  <p>But Mona shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I am only passing through London on my holiday."</p>

  <p>"Where to?"</p>

  <p>There was a distinct note of disappointment in his voice.</p>

  <p>"Bexhill."</p>

  <p>"Alone?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"It sounds&mdash;dullish."</p>

  <p>Mona shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"It will do as well as anywhere else."</p>

  <p>She leaned forward again, looking at her reflection in the pond, and for a
  few moments Mark Thewliss did not speak or move. The girl's heart began to
  beat with a suffocating violence, though she could give no reason for its
  action. She had a premonition that in the silence and sunlight of the court,
  beside the lovely lily-pond, something tremendous was being born into the
  world; so that Mark Thewliss' next words fairly startled her by their
  imbecility.</p>

  <p>"What a stroke of luck that you should come to see this old place again
  just at this hour!"</p>

  <p>Mona swung round and stared at him. What absolute idiots even men of
  genius could be! She turned away again hurriedly; but Mark Thewliss had some
  powers of perception in human affairs if they were sufficiently emphasised
  and under lined.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see," he murmured awkwardly.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;colours," she added resentfully. "Colours by daylight, colours
  by lamplight&mdash;" and he broke in upon her joyously:</p>

  <p>"That's where you're wrong, Mona. I'll tell you about it."</p>

  <p>Yes, he would tell her about it; and she would listen, and he would go
  away appeased and confident, and she would go away with her heart drooping
  and with a feeling that he had annexed all her strength and taken it from her
  into himself.</p>

  <p>"Very well! Tell me!"</p>

  <p>"Not here!"</p>

  <p>He looked down at her, and again she was conscious that something big had
  come into being during these few minutes.</p>

  <p>"Let's lunch together!" he added.</p>

  <p>Mona nodded her head.</p>

  <p>"Where shall we go?"</p>

  <p>"To the old place."</p>

  <p>"Frascati's?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>To both of them Frascati's Restaurant in Oxford Street, with its plush
  curtains, its gilded hall and its orchestra, was the very symbol of luxury
  and opulence. Thither the pair of them, both rather lonely people, had gone
  on rare occasions to celebrate some great public event or some small triumph
  which touched their own lives. They frankly admired it. They liked its rattle
  and clatter. They were flattered by being there, a couple out of the throng
  of Londoners, enjoying themselves in a rather lofty way selecting dishes from
  a <i>carte du jour</i> and having music played for them whilst they ate.</p>

  <p>"But you won't have time," Mona exclaimed regretfully, looking at the
  clock. "It's half-past one now."</p>

  <p>"Time means nothing to me," said Mark Thewliss. "My holiday, too, began at
  one. Will you come up to my rooms whilst I change?"</p>

  <p>Mona rose and followed him through the two courts into Holborn. The
  unceremonious dress of a later day was not looked upon with favour by the
  heads of important firms in the city of London; Mark Thewliss wore the high
  silk hat, the black tail coat and the striped trousers of his period. They
  crossed the street, entered the quadrangle of Furnival's Inn and climbed the
  uncarpeted stairway to the top floor.</p>

  <p>"You hate my quarters, I know," said Thewliss, as he opened the door into
  the sitting-room.</p>

  <p>Mona stopped upon the threshold and looked around her with
  disapproval.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she declared emphatically.</p>

  <p>It was not that the room was slovenly; nor was the furniture broken, nor
  the carpet threadbare. What offended her was that it was absolutely without
  character and embellishment. Men no less than women gather trifles about
  them, the photographs of their friends and first loves, little ornaments
  picked up in by-ways, favourite books, engravings. Here there was nothing but
  an inexpensive and drab formality. Not a picture decorated the grey wash upon
  the walls; and Mark Thewliss had a fastidious and almost feminine
  appreciation of colour. For the casual visitor there was nothing to be learnt
  from the aspect of the room about its inhabitant.</p>

  <p>But for Mona Lightfoot the mere absence of indications was the surest
  indication of all. He had used a true word to describe his chambers in
  Furnival's Inn. They were quarters&mdash;the quarters of a man on the march,
  billeted here for an unimportant night or two during the great advance. She
  tried and always had tried honestly to be glad of the unsleeping purpose
  which she divined in him. She was fond of him because of it; the very
  beginning of her love for him was to be found in it. But she made no pretence
  to consistency or logic. She wanted him none the less to remain in reach of
  her&mdash;and for young men on the march, women like herself were too heavy a
  load. The Colonel can do as he will. His baggage goes along in the wagon; but
  the young soldier carries it on his back.</p>

  <p>"I won't keep you five minutes," said Thewliss with a laugh. "You must put
  up with the place for that time," and he went by a communicating door into
  his bedroom.</p>

  <p>Mona Lightfoot crossed the room to one of the two windows and looked down
  upon the few yards of gravel which she had seen often enough hundreds of
  miles away in her little ante-room of an office in Liverpool. She was amazed
  to find how vividly the scene, dreary enough in all conscience, had been
  stamped upon her memory. On the right the narrow thoroughfare of Leather
  Lane. At her feet the scrubby oblong of dusty earth known as Brooke's Market,
  with its two rows of stunted sycamores set out as if to assure you that the
  market was a true geometrical figure. And on the other side of the market the
  long building of grey brick where she had served for two years under Mary
  Tipper; and whence from time to time she had emerged to dine at Frascati's
  with Mark Thewliss who was to be afterwards known as the first Baron Thewliss
  of Kyrle House, Grosvenor Square and Upper Theign in the county of
  Berkshire.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The house of Mardyke and Campion now covers many thousands of square feet
  along the by-pass road from London to Slough; but it has lost something of
  the national significance which it had when it straggled in obscurity at the
  back of Brooke's Market. For it was the first of all the houses in the world
  to devote itself to the composition of synthetic dyes. It was already forcing
  the indigo planters of Assam to ponder for what other industry their land was
  suitable. It was beginning to put beautiful fabrics within the reach of
  meagre purses. And since the priceless result of a new industry is often a
  quite unexpected product, like coal tar from gas, so it was with the makers
  of synthetic dyes. For by filling the bazaars of the East, from Bagdad to
  Marrakesch, with the gay colours which give a lively pleasure and enhance
  good humour, they promoted peace, more surely than treaties could amongst the
  fanatical children of the sun.</p>

  <p>This first firm owed its origin to the insight and adventurous spirit of a
  Manchester broker, Stuart Campion. Two almost simultaneous discoveries seized
  upon his imagination, one by Professor Perkins that by oxidation a dye which
  he called "mauve" could be obtained from crude aniline, the other by
  Professor Mansfield that benzine could be so separated from coal tar as to
  give the crude aniline necessary to Perkins. Stuart Campion was inspired to
  dream of a day not distant when new and as yet nameless shades of colour
  would add a delicate and joyous amenity to the world&mdash;whilst bringing in
  a handsome profit to the benefactors. He sought and obtained the co operation
  of Philip Mardyke, a wealthy cloth manufacturer of Bradford, who, by backing
  one or two unsuccessful musical comedies in the Strand, had shown that he,
  too, hankered after more colour in his life than the Yorkshire fells afforded
  him.</p>

  <p>The land was bought at the back of Brooke's Market, the laboratories
  equipped; and Mardyke and Campion set out upon their adventure in the spirit
  of Queen Elizabeth's sailors. But Queen Elizabeth left her adventurers free.
  Mardyke and Campion were en tangled at once amongst the traps which our
  modern governments set for nascent industries. Antiquated patent laws and
  restrictions on the use of alcohol hampered England, but did not hamper a
  Germany already equipped for commerce based upon chemical science. By the
  year 1884 Germany had snatched the lead; the sole owner of Mardyke and
  Campion was William Mardyke the son of Philip, middle-aged and timorous; and
  its chief chemist was Mark Thewliss, a man with a brilliant record from
  Dulwich College and the London University, who caused his employer many hours
  of agitation.</p>

  <p>"A buccaneer, sir," said Mr. William Mardyke across the dinner table to
  his cronies, banging his fist with the flighty exasperation which he dared
  not show to his chemist. "A man without reverence. A gambler too! Gad, what
  he has cost me this year!"</p>

  <p>The natural question was asked.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you get rid of him, then?"</p>

  <p>Mr. William Mardyke had no answer ready. He took refuge in
  vaguenesses.</p>

  <p>"Not so easy&mdash;no&mdash;not so easy as you think. But some
  day&mdash;yes&mdash;some day," he said darkly.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>At all events, to-day the buccaneer was going upon his holiday and not
  quite sure that he was ever going to return to Brooke's Market. He said as
  much to Mona Lightfoot when he came out from his bedroom attired in a light
  grey suit and carrying in his hand the kind of straw hat which is known as a
  gent's boater. It cannot be said that the change improved his appearance. In
  later years he acquired a curious delicacy and refinement of feature which,
  joined with the mark of authority, made of him a figure at which all men
  looked twice. Now he was not merely common place, he was common&mdash;a
  common young man with his thick brown hair growing too low upon his fore
  head, a fair moustache, and a long face. He had certainly a good strong pair
  of grey eyes, but they were too little alert to be noticeable. Indeed the
  only quality he had noticeable at all by the general run of his acquaintances
  had nothing to do with his looks. It was a curious aloofness peculiar to
  young people of vast ambitions, indefinable, yet immediately felt. It allowed
  him to be one of but never one with a group of his equals and associates. It
  was an aura which all the world could see. It made his friends consider what
  they had to say before they spoke to him. It led a few, a very few, to
  prophesy "That young man will go far."</p>

  <p>He stood by Mona's side, following the direction of her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Very likely I shall never go into that building again," he said with a
  laugh.</p>

  <p>Mona turned to him with consternation upon her face.</p>

  <p>"You? Mr. Mardyke can't be getting rid of you!"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. He's a funkstick. And I did make a bad break this spring."
  Thewliss answered with a laugh which had not one note of remorse in it.</p>

  <p>"But he couldn't do without you," cried Mona indignantly.</p>

  <p>"Well, he has got three weeks to make up his mind about that," said
  Thewliss. "Let's go to Frascati's. I'll tell you about it there."</p>

  <p>But the three weeks had passed before he told her.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch03"
     id="ch03"></a>III. &mdash;AT FRASCATI'S</h2>

  <p class="first">They walked westward along Oxford Street. It was a day of
  exotic heat. The sky overhead was quite cloudless and quite colourless, as
  though the fire of the summer had bleached it. The air was lifeless and stale
  with the breath of millions of people; no wind blew; there was a smell of
  tar; and the pavement scorched the feet. At the corner of Tottenham Court
  Road Mark Thewliss slipped his hand under his companion's arm and held her
  anxiously.</p>

  <p>"You must look to the right here."</p>

  <p>"There is a horse and cart in Liverpool," she replied.</p>

  <p>They crossed the road, and at the entrance to Frascati's he stopped and
  drew in his breath. Mona felt his hand tighten on her arm.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Thewliss awoke with a laugh.</p>

  <p>"I was anticipating the first delicious shock of cool green water closing
  over my parched, tired-out body, as I dived."</p>

  <p>"Then you, too, are going to the sea?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>He looked away from her as he answered, and led the way out of the
  blinding sunlight into the restaurant. "Our old table," she pleaded.</p>

  <p>"No other will do for us to-day."</p>

  <p>It stood ranged against the wall without an occupant, and Thewliss laughed
  with pleasure as he saw her take her old place and hitch up her chair. He
  hung his hat on a branch of the nearest stand and asked:</p>

  <p>"You are hungry?"</p>

  <p>"Ferocious. I left Liverpool at eight."</p>

  <p>"Then we'll have an ambassador's luncheon. First of all&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A blue trout," she interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Then a grouse."</p>

  <p>She looked at him with awe.</p>

  <p>"Does it run to that?"</p>

  <p>"To-day my name's money."</p>

  <p>"Then we'll have a rasher of bacon on the top and a slice of toast
  underneath, and all frightfully rich."</p>

  <p>"And new peas and potatoes, an apple flan to follow, and hock-cup to
  drink."</p>

  <p>"With lots and lots of ice. Adorable!" and Mona closed her eyes in an
  ecstasy.</p>

  <p>Through the first half of that luncheon Mark Thewliss plied her with
  questions: in the beginning as to why she had chosen Bexhill for her holiday
  though he clearly didn't want to hear about Bexhill; and then about her life
  in Liverpool, though he equally clearly did not want to hear about Liverpool.
  But he wanted the sound of her voice, which was low and full and charming,
  the play of her features, the smile of her eyes and lips, the little gift of
  mimicry she had; and he could not have enough of them.</p>

  <p>"Seven months," he cried in a low voice. "That's a long time without a
  friend to talk to!"</p>

  <p>Mona had never quite known him in this mood before. He was requiring her
  companionship as though he drew confidence, even a sense of security, from
  her neighbourhood. She put that new grace in him together with the doubt he
  had uttered in Furnival's Inn that he might never return to the laboratory of
  Mardyke and Campion. And while she answered his questions and rattled on as
  he wished her to do, her thoughts ran:</p>

  <p>"He has risked everything...I am sure of it...He is at some junction of
  his life whence the unknown roads branch out...He has staked everything on
  his choice&mdash;as all men who without birth or inherited fortune rise to
  great places must do a hundred times. But between the moment when he stakes
  and the moment when he knows whether he has won or lost, there's a time of
  waiting&mdash;anxiety that won't sleep&mdash;suspense that won't relax its
  tension...And that time's now...and he wants <i>me</i>."</p>

  <p>Her heart beat exultantly. Hopes were loosed from it and fluttered about
  her, doves from a trap, hopes winged with gold colours and burnished by the
  sun. She was inspired to gamble, too, to set all upon a single throw, to
  snatch all or to lose everything. There was her employer in Liverpool and his
  court ship of her. Should she tell him of it? She had but to lean across the
  table and say: "Henry Perriton pleads continually for me to marry him. Shall
  I?" and she put her life to the test of that moment. If he looked at her as
  he never yet had looked, if he uttered a clamorous "You can't! Mona, you
  can't!" why, then she trod light-footed, winged, harnessed against all the
  strokes of fate.</p>

  <p>But suppose he just thought the proposition over without the least little
  movement of revolt and said in the end: "Well&mdash;in a way, of course, I
  shall be sorry. I shall lose something, I recognise that. But on the
  whole&mdash;yes, it's fine! Good luck to you!"</p>

  <p>She hesitated, dreading that sort of answer worse than death. But before
  she could take the risk of the gamble, Mark Thewliss raised the
  pool&mdash;and so high that every stiver of her tiny capital would be
  garnisheed if she matched herself against him.</p>

  <p>"We are both from choice and from temper rather lonely people, Mona,
  aren't we?" he began in a low voice, looking here and there upon the
  tablecloth&mdash;anywhere but at her. "We have neither of us any one very
  near us in the way of relations. No one who cares a threepenny bit what
  becomes of us."</p>

  <p>"No one," Mona agreed.</p>

  <p>"And we are both quite unrecognised people&mdash;just two out of the
  thousands of holiday-makers scattered about England. There's not a soul, for
  instance, in this restaurant who has ever heard of either of us. We are
  free&mdash;that's the point, Mona&mdash;we are free now."</p>

  <p>He took a drink of his hock-cup, as though his throat was parched. She
  felt his foot pressing against hers under the table.</p>

  <p>"What we choose to do now no one will ever know except from ourselves, and
  we shan't talk," he continued. "But we shall have had a wonderful month to
  look back upon."</p>

  <p>The colour fled from Mona Lightfoot's cheeks. If he never looked at her,
  she on the other hand never took her eyes from his troubled face. She noticed
  the little note of shame, of remorse in his voice in that he was not offering
  all that he could offer, in that he was asking for the supreme sacrifice in
  return for just four weeks of romantic adventure. But Mona continued to
  listen, nor did she withdraw her foot from contact with his.</p>

  <p>"You," he resumed, "will, after all, have a pretty sad time alone there at
  Bexhill. The acquaintances of the beach&mdash;girls linked arm in arm having
  the time of their lives&mdash;the boys from the offices giving the girls a
  chance&mdash;the pierrot's sentiment and last year's music-hall
  songs"&mdash;he smiled as he sketched the holiday which awaited her, and went
  on with an accent of tenderness which moved her to tenderness too. "My dear,
  all that's not for you. A day of it and you'ld be ready to commit suicide.
  Whilst I&mdash;" and he suddenly raised to her a most eager face and
  desperately pleading eyes&mdash;"I have never in my life dreamed that I could
  want the companionship of anyone as I shall want yours during the next
  month."</p>

  <p>That was it! Companionship&mdash;oh, needed without a doubt! The whole
  aspect of the man clamoured for her. But there it was to end. A month's
  companionship.</p>

  <p>"Only," she asked herself, "need it end there?"</p>

  <p>At the end of that month, might he not want it prolonged to a lifetime?
  Wasn't it for her so to manage that he did want it? Wasn't that just her
  business in life? A month was an enormous time. After all, this very morning
  he had not had one thought of this great need which had sprung up hungry
  within him, as she sat at his side on the stone coping of the lily-pond. The
  queer sense of something imminent which she had felt in that inner court of
  Staple Inn was all clear to her now. Well, if a couple of hours could wake
  such hunger for her comradeship, what might not the slow waxing and waning of
  a moon beside the sea beget?</p>

  <p>"You want to go with me to Bexhill?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No"; and he poured out to her the story of his little cutter.</p>

  <p>It was at Poole, waiting, fitted out to the last rope. He fired her with
  his descriptions of it, of the new world which would open to her the land
  from the sea, instead of the sea from the land. Something of his own
  enthusiasm passed into her.</p>

  <p>"Where should we go?" she asked, kindling, half persuaded. "Cowes?"</p>

  <p>And she saw him draw back in disappointment. For a moment she had a throb
  of fear that in her excitement she had said "Keowes." There had been a time,
  no doubt, when such pronunciations had been heard from her lips; but she had
  long since schooled herself out of them. And in a moment she was reassured.
  It was her ignorance, not her enunciation, which troubled Mark Thewliss.</p>

  <p>"Cowes!" He repeated the name with a pitying disdain. He was at an age
  when smooth waters meant nothing to him whatever. "We shall go west. England
  begins west of St. Alban's Head," he cried, with a superb arrogance which
  suddenly made a boy of him.</p>

  <p>Mona clapped her hands together. She did not know St. Alban's Head from
  Margate Jetty; she had never even heard the name before. But she adored the
  boyish insolence with which he spoke. It made him one with other young men of
  spirit. It brought him down to normal. It fed the hope a mean little hope, a
  disloyal hope she frankly acknowledged it to be, but she could never quite
  drive it out of her breast&mdash;a hope that after all he was not the great
  man, made for a higher world than hers, which in her most secret thoughts she
  believed him to be.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps after all he may have aimed too high," she said to herself; and
  Thewliss swept her away upon the cruise. He carried her past Lulworth Cove
  and its entrance like some high lock when the gates are open; past Osmington
  Mills, the little creek with the long pitch-black coastguard station on a low
  shoulder of hill.</p>

  <p>"I spent a month there once."</p>

  <p>"Alone?" she interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And you didn't mind?"</p>

  <p>"You were going to spend a month alone at Bexhill."</p>

  <p>"For me, it would have been different."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>Mona had no answer to that question. She was simply putting herself out of
  her thoughts and imagining, with a maternal solicitude and pity, twenty-eight
  solitary days unlightened by any of those foolish little jokes which are the
  very salt of companionship.</p>

  <p>Thewliss brought the cutter towards sunset into Weymouth Harbour by the
  side of the wooded Nothe.</p>

  <p>"I should get you a room there and one at Poole to-night, whilst I slept
  on the boat to have it ready for an early start in the morning "&mdash;he had
  the tact thus to make consent easier to her; and he carried her over the West
  Bay to the red cliffs of Devonshire and to Penzance beyond the Lizard.
  Suddenly she laughed:</p>

  <p>"I shall wear a yachting cap."</p>

  <p>"We'll buy it this afternoon," said he. "I have an oilskin and a
  sou'-wester and rubber boots to spare. You have some woollen things, of
  course, and some rubber-soled shoes. You'll do."</p>

  <p>Mona had slid into assenting rather than had actually assented. But she
  did not take back her word. They bought the yachting cap and a couple of
  white covers for it. Then she sent Thewliss about his business and went
  secretly to a shop by herself. She returned to Mary Tipper's lodging for
  tea.</p>

  <p>"I shall give you my address," she said. "I may have a letter or two.
  Perhaps you will forward them. I'll let you know where I shall be."</p>

  <p>Mary Tipper was cast in a commoner mould than Mona Lightfoot. But they had
  been thrown much together in the office, and a friendship had grown up
  between them. Mona had not planned to tell her friend of the adventure on
  which she was entering, but she let slip enough to leave her in no doubt.</p>

  <p>"My!" said Mary Tipper when Mona had departed with her suit-cases. "I
  never did! Mr. Thewliss, too! Such a poker-back! My dear, here's fortune to
  you! You're too good to be spoilt."</p>

  <p>Thewliss and Mona Lightfoot travelled down to Poole by the evening train.
  Thewliss found her a lodging for the night, and at half-past six the next
  morning was at her door to carry her baggage to the Quay.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch04"
     id="ch04"></a>IV. &mdash;THE RACE</h2>

  <p class="first">At six o'clock of the morning the <i>Sea Flower</i> passed
  the central entrance to Portland Harbour on the last of the flow. Overhead
  stretched a cool milky sky, split here and there by bars of a tender
  unfathomable blue. She had the wind on her port quarter, and her little punt
  bobbing behind in her wash at the end of a rope. Thewliss himself held the
  tiller; and, keeping well inshore under the white mark, he sailed his cutter
  along the flank of the tremendous rock to the Bill. Low on the point stood a
  small white round lighthouse, with a broad chocolate band round its middle;
  and from the foot of it streamed out to sea a line of tumbled water, black
  and straight like a line drawn by a lead pencil.</p>

  <p>"It's going to be a bit more troublesome than St. Alban's Head," said
  Thewliss with a laugh of rather fierce enjoyment. "When the wind's on shore,
  Portland Race is up." He was more than ever nautical in his talk. "However,
  the tide's slackening off against us; and once we're through, we shall have
  it for three good hours with us to help us across the Bay."</p>

  <p>"Three?" asked Mona Lightfoot in surprise. She had always understood that,
  counting in the slack water, the tide ran for six hours in and six hours
  out.</p>

  <p>"It's in the perversity of things," Mark explained, "that along this
  coast, at this time of the year, the tide runs westward for three hours and
  eastward for nine."</p>

  <p>"Oh!"</p>

  <p>Mona Lightfoot uttered an involuntary cry, and pointed. "Look! Look!"</p>

  <p>For once, it seemed, the captain was careless of his ship. The <i>Sea
  Flower's</i> bowsprit was thrusting towards the lighthouse like a lance, and
  already Mona could have tossed her yachting-cap on shore. But Thewliss smiled
  and raised his voice above the roar of breaking water.</p>

  <p>"You can't run ashore on the Bill in a little sailing boat, you'll see;"
  and the next moment, with a great lift of her bows and a shudder of all her
  sails, the cutter took the first waves of the Race as a horse takes a fence.
  For a few moments the air about them was opaque with spray. It whipped their
  faces and left a taste of salt in their mouths, and blew landward off the
  crests of the waves, low and swift and silvery-white like snow. The bows
  dipped into the breakers and the water ran hissing along the deck to the
  combing of the cock-pit. Behind them the punt splashed and jumped and yawed
  at the end of its hawser; and then with an unexpected abruptness they were
  out of the smother of sea-spume and the welter of breaking waves.</p>

  <p>The roar and clatter was all behind them; they were no longer battered and
  cuffed; they were enclosed in the silence of a lagoon. But they were not out
  of the Race. The surf through which they had struggled was but its edge and
  rich embroidery. The sea swept at them now in flat sheets, marked out from
  each other in accidental patterns of arcs and straight lines. It gave Mona
  Lightfoot the impression of a crazy pavement moving forward under the cutter
  with an irresistible velocity. The sheets were of a pale green in colour and
  glimmered with a viscous sheen. They hissed and rustled like silk against
  silk in a lady's dress; and as they raced by, bubbles like little bright
  beads continually formed and burst upon their surface and tiny whirlpools
  span and disappeared, so that Mona no longer thought of crazy pavements in a
  vast garden, but in a more homely fashion of water on the boil in some
  fabulous cauldron.</p>

  <p>She climbed out of the cockpit, and holding on to a stay stretched herself
  out upon the deck, so that she could see far down into the depths of this
  green water at once violent and smooth. There was something curiously
  relentless in its onsweep; it ran so fast that she grew dizzy watching it. It
  seemed to her that the <i>Sea Flower</i> must be travelling with the speed of
  some magical ship like the <i>Flying Dutchman</i>. She glanced towards the
  shore to take her bearings for the first time since the <i>Sea Flower</i> had
  plunged into the Race, and cried out in her amazement. The round white
  lighthouse with the chocolate band was still ahead of them, almost as far
  ahead as when she had last looked at it. But it was a tiny thing now, a
  coloured toy set up on a distant coast; so far had the Race pushed the small
  cutter out to sea.</p>

  <p>"I told you we couldn't hit the Bill even if we tried," Thewliss shouted
  at her. "But the tide's beginning to ebb. We shall make headway in a
  minute."</p>

  <p>He was sitting crouched up by the tiller, holding the long arm with a grip
  of iron, keeping the cutter to her course against eddy and current, and
  measuring by the shore-marks each foot gained with an enjoyment which Mona
  had never seen in his face before.</p>

  <p>Gradually the lighthouse dropped behind them; the great bluff of cliff at
  the far edge of the Race moved forward into view; the roar of water became
  audible again. For a few moments the <i>Sea Flower</i> tossed again in a
  jumble of surf and then slipped out into the shining freedom of the Bay. Over
  the high yellow wall of the Chesil Beach a town came into view on their right
  hand.</p>

  <p>"What's that place?" Mona asked.</p>

  <p>"Weymouth."</p>

  <p>She could hardly believe her eyes. That was the town&mdash;just there,
  just across that high barrier of pebbles&mdash;from which they had sailed so
  long ago in the cool of the grey morning. Then she saw the lofty down open
  out far back between Portland and the cliffs of the Bay; a long straight road
  run like a chalk line to a solitary tree on the down's crest; the slender
  pillar set up to Nelson's captain; and the famous White Horseman riding away
  eternally and covering even less distance than a little cutter in the
  Race.</p>

  <p>"Breakfast," cried Thewliss.</p>

  <p>By the time when it was eaten and cleared away, there was nothing visible
  but sky and sea and the dark brow of England's Gibraltar astern of them. Mona
  took the tiller whilst Thewliss set himself to the never completed task of
  burnishing and polishing; and when she looked astern again the last of
  Portland had vanished into the September haze.</p>

  <p>"I have waited for this all the morning," she whispered, gazing about her
  with eyes shining as though she looked upon some miraculous vision. "Do you
  know that I have never been out of sight of land before?"</p>

  <p>"We should see Bury Head if we were a little higher out of the water,"
  said Mark Thewliss, still the practical sailor with a chart of the coastline
  in his head.</p>

  <p>But Mona took no notice of his words, for she did not hear them. She was
  absorbed heart and brain in this new and entrancing experience; the great
  bowl of blue sky, the wide expanse of shining sea and the little exquisite
  ship alone in this glorious immensity.</p>

  <p>"I may never see this again in all my life," she said in a low voice which
  had, even to the man who heard her, an appealing sadness. A wondrous
  holiday&mdash;yes. A holiday to be noted and stored up, so that every moment
  might at some later day be unwrapped from its overlay of time and minister as
  a solace like a jewel of soft deep fire. But ever present also was the
  recognition that in all her years to come not one moment of it, not even a
  moment to match it might once recur. Thewliss was constrained to an uneasy
  silence. In the girl's frank, ungrudging acceptance of the limitations which
  were likely to subdue the whole of her life to something little, he
  discovered a bravery quite foreign to himself, he suspected a nobility in
  which he had no share. He was conscious of discomfort. He was a little
  ashamed.</p>

  <p>Throughout that morning and the earlier hours of the afternoon the wind
  blew steadily from the south-east. They took their spells at the tiller. Now
  far out some big steamer would trail a ribbon of black smoke across the sky.
  Now close at hand for Mona's enchantment a school of porpoises would rise
  from the depths and escort the <i>Sea Flower</i> on her way, crossing and
  recrossing in the clear water beneath her keel, leaping up to shake the spray
  from a black glistening fin, then cart-wheeling with a splash of water like
  urchins let loose from a class. But towards four o'clock the wind fell
  light&mdash;at five the great boom of the mainsail swung inboard and swung
  out with a great rattle of blocks, and the little ship shivered. As far as
  the eye could reach there was not a flaw upon the water.</p>

  <p>"A&mdash;little&mdash;check," said Thewliss with a curious intonation half
  mincing, half guttural. "We shall get the wind again before nightfall.
  Meanwhile it's&mdash;a little check."</p>

  <p>He was misquoting the catch-phrase from a popular comedy of those days.
  Mona, sitting upon the roof of the cabin and swinging her legs in the
  cockpit, laughed and took up his allusion.</p>

  <p>"Digby Grant in the 'Two Roses,'" she cried. "When he pays back the sums
  he has borrowed from his humble friends;" and she too tried to imitate the
  great protagonist who had made Digby Grant his own.
  "A&mdash;little&mdash;cheque."</p>

  <p>"Do you know I once&mdash;once? twenty times&mdash;had more than half a
  mind to kick chemistry out of the door and take a header on to the
  stage?"</p>

  <p>"You? You, Mark?" and with a joyousness he did not understand, she pressed
  for a reason.</p>

  <p>"Why? Why?"</p>

  <p>But Mark Thewliss was in full flight. He had only an audience of one, it
  was true, but that one was very fit and satisfying. Her eyes so shone with so
  starry a pleasure, her laughter hit full-throated the exact moment when
  laughter should round off the phrase.</p>

  <p>Speech after speech from the "Two Roses." Then followed extracts from "The
  Corsican Brothers," noble sentiments from "Charles I" and all the ironical
  humilities of Shylock. And each delivery was uttered with the same curious
  intonation, and was accompanied with the strange gurgling growls one might
  expect to hear from a wounded panther. Nor did gestures fail to point the
  words; but they were unusual gestures, tossings of the head, pawing of feet
  upon the floor of the cockpit, sudden outreachings of the arms and hands with
  the long sensitive fingers quivering like springs. And all the time Mona,
  swinging her legs over the cockpit, applauded enraptured, and cried:</p>

  <p>"Why? Why, Mark, did you want to go on to the stage?"</p>

  <p>Mark was flattered by her eagerness, he did not bother to seek a reason
  for it. He recited. The failure of the wind, the sea, even the little
  boat&mdash;all were forgotten. "Why, Mark, why?" Oh, there was a reason for
  her question. It sprang from a heart made over subtle by a passionate and
  almost despairing love.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Those were the great days of Henry Irving. He had triumphed alike over his
  deficiencies and the swarm of his belittlers. He had made attributes of his
  weak voice and his grotesque gestures. He had decorated his plays with
  splendour and with artistry. He lit them at will to the glare of noonday or
  the tender atmosphere of night. And over all lay the dominant magic of his
  own personality. He made of the Lyceum Theatre a temple, with himself its
  arch, unquestioned priest. He held a place in the social scheme unoccupied
  since Garrick died. He was the great interpreter. The reticence of his life
  and the delicate authority of his face crowned him with an aura of romance.
  Stories ran the town of his generous heart and caustic tongue. He was of a
  Florentine magnificence. He was almost inevitably the idol of middle-class
  youth. Admiring parents gathered their friends into suburban drawing-rooms to
  hear their sons recite Shakespeare in the Irving manner. Every normal youth
  in office or factory wanted to go on the stage and dignify a theatre with a
  replica of Irving&mdash;and Mark Thewliss like the rest.</p>

  <p>That was the hidden thought which so charmed her, which drove her on, as
  she sat dangling her slim legs over the cockpit, to ask for scenes from "The
  Cup," for speeches of Cardinal Wolsey and for the arguments of tortured
  Hamlet. Mark Thewliss was on the same plane as the others of his years and
  class, none of whom would add another Irving to decorate the age, all of whom
  would in due course mate with their like, share with them their due
  assignment of joys and sorrows and ambitions and move on arm in arm with them
  to such achievement as that Santa Claus, the future, kept hidden away for
  them in his sack.</p>

  <p>"More! More!" she cried, clasping her hands together between her knees and
  leaning forward with eyes so eager. "'Richard III' now! Please! 'Now is the
  winter of our discontent'"&mdash;she remembered a Saturday evening when she
  had stood for three hours under the low roof of the pit entrance of the
  Lyceum&mdash;"Oh, Mark, you do it divinely!"</p>

  <p>Mona followed the sound old rule. If you are going in for flattery, lay it
  on with a trowel. Mona had her reward, since reward she considered it. Mark
  Thewliss expanded, glowed, hunched his shoulders, projected into his not very
  malleable features such a medley of venom and cunning as would justify his
  being hanged on sight&mdash;and recited. He gave Mona "Now is the winter of
  our discontent"&mdash;oh, and much more. He wooed Anne, plotted with Tyrrel
  the murder of the Princes in the Tower, started up from the vision of his
  assassinated victims and met his death on Bosworth Field.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the sun went down. Far away in the north-west the long bluff of
  Bury Head, now visible, ran out like a fortress wall into the Bay. Above it
  the sky had the tender colour of an amethyst. A flaw of wind crept from the
  south, ruffling and blackening the water.</p>

  <p>"Let it hold and we can anchor at Torquay tonight," said Mark, and as the
  breeze reached the cutter he paid out his mainsail sheet and bore away to the
  north.</p>

  <p>"But we shan't reach the harbour in time for dinner," he added. "And I'm
  glad, Mona. You're a cook to match my appetite, and that's no small praise, I
  can tell you."</p>

  <p>Mona jumped down from her perch and stood for a moment looking forward.
  The rose of the sunset was fading from Bury Head. It looked to her a thousand
  miles away, a rock reef somehow wedged in the sky. Her eyes swept the
  horizon. Here and there a gull floated on outstretched wings or swooped to
  the sea. The slight breeze was dying away. The cutter with its tenants was
  alone.</p>

  <p>Mona fried a couple of dabs; grilled a couple of lamb chops with tomatoes;
  baked some potatoes in their jackets; set out on the table a Cheshire cheese,
  some fruit and a bottle of Moselle; opened a tin of sardines as a <i>hors
  d'couvre</i>, and cried out:</p>

  <p>"All ready!"</p>

  <p>Mark Thewliss fixed the tiller in its appropriate clutch and stepped down
  into the cabin, whilst Mona lighted the candles in the sockets on the walls
  and enclosed them in their round glass funnels. They dined gaily; Mona still
  possessed by the enchanting notion that she had sitting next to her on the
  settee no great man in obscurity, no chrysalis soon to spread gorgeous wings,
  but just a grub like herself, an adorable grub but a permanent grub&mdash;her
  man; Mark, for his part, aware of a well-being hitherto unknown to him. It
  was produced by the whiteness of the tablecloth, the shining metal of the
  cutlery, the good cooking, all the daintiness that a woman contributes to a
  meal, and by the presence of this attentive, lively and lovely companion at
  his side.</p>

  <p>"I used to spread a napkin on the green baize last year and take a cut
  from a cold ham with a loaf of bread and some pickles. Mona, this is the most
  wonderful holiday. May it be like this to the end!"</p>

  <p>He lifted his glass and drank to her. She waited. She wanted to hear him
  add:</p>

  <p>"And next year may we repeat it!"</p>

  <p>But he did not. The wish, so easy of fulfilment, never indeed occurred to
  him. Mona set down her glass.</p>

  <p>"I'll make some coffee."</p>

  <p>Whilst she cleared the table, Mark uncovered a locker in the bows, brought
  up his port and starboard lamps, lit them and mounted them on their wooden
  stands in the rigging. When Mona came back from the kitchen into the cabin
  she saw him wrapped in a long thick rough blue overcoat.</p>

  <p>"We shan't get to any harbour to-night, Mona," he said in a serious voice.
  "The wind has fallen altogether. We have the tide with us. I have set our
  course for the Start Point. We ought to get into Dartmouth to-morrow
  morning."</p>

  <p>Mona nodded her head, whilst the blood mounted into her neck and face. Her
  eyes looked straight at him, charged with a mystery which quite baffled
  him.</p>

  <p>She did not speak.</p>

  <p>He drank his coffee in an embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"I didn't mean..." he said. "With the wind as it was this morning we
  looked like crossing the West Bay in good time."</p>

  <p>"I want you to tell me something," she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"Why did you want to go on the stage?"</p>

  <p>Mona had come back to her first urgent question. Mark Thewliss gazed at
  her in surprise. The question seemed trivial, even childish, at this hour and
  in this place.</p>

  <p>The cabin doors stood open, held back upon their hooks. Mark glanced
  through the opening. The last of the daylight had long since gone. A moon
  three days old was spreading a silver radiance across the world. Though
  Mark's eyes saw only the cockpit yellow in the streaming candlelight, the
  butt of the tiller held fast in a notch of its gleaming rack, and the sheets
  of the mainsail sloping upwards from the traveller towards the boom, he had a
  picture in his mind of the quiet floor of the sea empty from rim to rim
  except for this little ship, where a young man and a young woman stood face
  to face in a tiny lighted cabin. The question was trivial&mdash;yes. But he
  looked back to Mona. She was not trivial. She was not childish. A smile made
  her mouth tender, her big dark eyes watched him steadily; and both the smile
  and the grave eyes were a riddle to him and a mystery.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you."</p>

  <p>Mark Thewliss sat down upon the settee and filled his pipe.</p>

  <p>"It hadn't anything to do with art. Oh, no!" He spoke exculpating himself
  hastily and vigorously from any suspicion that he was concerned with any
  leaning so open to derision. "But when I noticed the extraordinary hush in a
  theatre full of people, when I saw those people of all degrees, from the man
  with the muffler round his throat in the gallery, to the fine disdainful lady
  in the stalls, leaning forward so that their eyes might not miss a movement,
  nor their ears an intonation&mdash;people lost to the world, helpless under a
  spell&mdash;I used to wonder whether anything else could give to any man such
  a sensation of sheer power as that spellbound house must give to the actor on
  the stage."</p>

  <p>He laughed a little brokenly and moistened his lips with his tongue. He
  betrayed himself at that moment. He laid naked the violence of his ambition
  and its weakness. Power, not as a lever, but as a sensation. Power not as a
  means to some greatly-planned achievement but as achievement itself,
  self-sufficient, an emperor's diadem. He savoured it now. The look of his
  face was voluptuous.</p>

  <p>Gradually, however, his mood changed. Delight was succeeded by uneasiness.
  It took him a minute or two before he realised that his uneasiness was due to
  an extraordinary stillness in the cabin. Mona stood as if turned to stone.
  Did she find something to censure in his confession of faith, he
  wondered&mdash;and wondered rather resentfully. But he did not look at her.
  If he had he would have seen that the smile had passed from her lips, but
  that her eyes still watched him with their tremendous mystery and quietude.
  But he did not; and suddenly, to his amazement and discomfort, he was
  absurdly conscious of a suspicion that of the two of them, the girl, in spite
  of&mdash;nay, perhaps because of&mdash;her clear recognition of what could be
  and could not be, and the uncomplaining submission which sprang from it, had
  the higher pride, even the nobler spirit.</p>

  <p>He could not endure so wounding an idea. He flushed red and broke out
  fretfully:</p>

  <p>"Did you ever read Disraeli, Mona?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"I'd have him taught in schools, if I had my way. A long chalk more useful
  than Xenophon. He's the guide for young men. There's a novel called
  'Endymion.' Listen to this, Mona. It's an extract from it&mdash;a text to be
  printed in big black letters on a white background and hung up in one's
  bedroom where one's eyes must see it, the moment they opened in the morning.
  Listen!"</p>

  <p>And he recited, no longer with any mimicry of Henry Irving, but in the
  voice of one weighing out slowly the final words of human wisdom:</p>

  <p class="quote">"Power and power alone should be your absorbing object, and
  all the accidents and incidents of life should only be considered with
  reference to that main result."</p>

  <p>And now he did lift his eyes to Mona's face, and lo! once more she was
  smiling. Mark's first surprising answer to her question had struck her down,
  a blow from an iron mace. It was the formulation by him of all the fears, the
  heart-sinkings, the sudden forebodings which had robbed her of her peace and
  kept her aching&mdash;more than the formulation of them. It set upon them the
  seals of truth. Even at that moment she was clear-eyed and clove to the very
  heart of his meaning with a superb instinct.</p>

  <p>"For real power," she said to herself. "For the power to do some great
  long-planned thing, a mate like me, one with him, might help&mdash;yes, in
  the end might be of service. But for the sensation of power, the luxury of
  continual evidences of power&mdash;a great house, famous men at your table,
  deference and the doffing of caps&mdash;not one man in a million would look
  to me for help there."</p>

  <p>But Mark had not left the matter so. He had gone on to quote Disraeli with
  a curiously nave and boastful petulance&mdash;just like a schoolboy captured
  by some splashy, grandiloquent sentence to be found somewhere in any notable
  book. She loved his plea that Disraeli should supersede Xenophon. She felt
  that it was absolutely right, not because she knew anything of the respective
  merits or suitabilities of those two authors, but because it revealed in him
  once more to her the adorable boy for whom every woman looks in the man she
  loves, but no woman more ardently than this lovely gambler on the <i>Sea
  Flower</i>.</p>

  <p>"If you come out," said Mark, opening a long cupboard by the door and
  taking out a second overcoat, "you'll put this on, won't you? There's a heavy
  dew falling."</p>

  <p>He was reassured by her returning gaiety, as she by his boyishness; and he
  thanked her by a tenderness in his voice which she took for the music of the
  spheres. He went up the steps into the cockpit. He had hauled the boom of the
  mainsail in amidships whilst they dined, and he now loosened the sheet and
  paid it out. But there was still no wind, and only the weight of the sail
  kept it outstretched over the sea. Between the open doors of the cabin he saw
  Mona busily clearing away the plates and the dishes, the cutlery and the
  glasses, into the little cuddy beyond; washing them; setting the crockery on
  its rims in the racks, the glasses in their stands, the knives and forks and
  spoons in their drawers; returning to the cabin; folding up the tablecloth,
  putting it away; taking sheets and blankets from lockers at the back of the
  settees and making up the beds. He noticed that though she moved without
  haste the work was very quickly done. He sat admiring the deftness of her
  movements. Viewed from where he sat with the tiller in the crook of his arm,
  even at that short distance Mona and the interior of the cabin were seen in
  miniature. Thewliss had the impression that he was looking on at some
  pleasantly homely scene in a little play.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he reflected, "I like that. I must marry one of these days." His
  eyes went to Mona Lightfoot, as she now stood tall and slim with her back
  towards him, whilst with her arm gracefully lifted she raised a glass globe
  from a candle to blow the light out. "Yes, and before it's too late..."</p>

  <p>Thus he admonished himself to make his way in the world quickly, so that
  before age put a tarnish on his dazzling qualities he might pluck from some
  helpfully great family a wife with the low, broad white forehead and
  mysterious dark eyes of Mona there&mdash;yes, rather like Mona&mdash;very
  like Mona&mdash;in fact Mona born in a castle, aired in her perambulator
  under pergolas, and pruned and trimmed in the drawing rooms of Mayfair.</p>

  <p>Mona put out the candles, slipped on the capacious overcoat and joined
  Mark Thewliss in the cockpit. The sickle of new moon had set and the stars
  had taken the sky by storm. All about the ship, infinite darkness and a hush
  which the girl thought it would have been sacrilege to break. Thewliss
  buttoned the coat close at her throat and, setting an arm about her, caught
  her against his breast. The air was warm. The red and green side-lights shone
  comfortably from the side rigging, and here and there a pathway of pale gold
  ran out across the sea to meet a planet. The magical holiday! Mona played
  with the fancy that the little ship itself was a star in space with Mark and
  herself for its only inhabitants, and two colours of light, green and red, to
  baffle and astound all the astronomers at their telescopes.</p>

  <p>Thewliss looked steadily southwards and Mona, following the direction of
  his eyes, breathed a sigh. Out there the mirrored stars were trembling in the
  water. In a few moments a faint wind stirred the curls of her hair. The sail
  towering into the night flapped like a great bird's white wing and the sea
  tinkled against the cutter's planks.</p>

  <p>Mona waited in suspense, but with the acquiescence which was the mark of
  her. Here was one of the fatalities which neither will nor effort could alter
  or direct. Either the breeze strengthened and turn by turn they sailed their
  ship to the Start, or this one enchanted night was given to her. She sat very
  still. The sound of water splashing into a glass died away; the great sail,
  its white shading upwards into black, towered spectral and shadowy against
  the sky. Darkness and silence once more embosomed the little cutter and its
  tenantry. They fell to talking in low voices, both of them with a fancy that
  a malevolent spirit might strike at them in jealousy if it discovered them
  floating upon the bespangled mirror of the sea in the perfection of the
  summer night.</p>

  <p>"I should like to be sailing in the Pacific on a night like this," said
  Mark.</p>

  <p>"Could it be more wonderful out there than it is here?" Mona Lightfoot
  asked.</p>

  <p>"So many big bright stars, they say," he whispered, "we should never find
  our way amongst them."</p>

  <p>Then his voice changed.</p>

  <p>"Look!"</p>

  <p>A golden fragment slid down the sky, curving with a lightning swiftness,
  and vanished.</p>

  <p>"There goes a world."</p>

  <p>"Not ours!" Mona cried in a low voice; and she breathed a prayer from her
  heart. "Not for a month&mdash;"</p>

  <p>All the wonders that were marching out to greet her at each hour of her
  expedition&mdash;she could not spare one of them. They were to make the
  prelude to a fine, exacting, fruitful life at the best&mdash;at the worst
  they were to be woven into a deathless memory, so that she could lie at night
  in her darkened bedroom and in an instant sail out of Poole Harbour to the
  west. She must see the sickle of new moon round to a red disc and wane again
  and be blotted out. The last lightship on the edge of England must ring its
  bell within her hearing.</p>

  <p>"Not till this month be passed!" she prayed, and her voice broke. Thewliss
  drew her close within his arm.</p>

  <p>"Mona!"</p>

  <p>She rubbed her cheek against the rough cloth of his coat, cool and damp
  with the dew.</p>

  <p>"Mark!" and the name was whispered so low that only the movement of her
  lips told him that she had spoken his name. The new yachting cap tumbled off
  on to the floor of the cockpit.</p>

  <p>"There goes more than a world," said Mark.</p>

  <p>She felt his lips upon her forehead. His arm slid up to her shoulders, his
  hand tilted her chin Her upturned face in the darkness was wan and grave and
  very tender. Mark kissed her on the lips.</p>

  <p>"It is time," he whispered.</p>

  <p>There was an orison in the clasp of his arm, an answer in the quietude of
  her body. She let a few moments pass. Then she disengaged herself, rose and
  went down into the cabin, closing the doors behind her. Mark saw the light of
  the candles stream out through the side windows above the level of the deck
  for a little while. Then the candles were put out again and the doors opened
  from within.</p>

  <p>The tide was running to the west. The green light of a ship steaming up
  Channel moved across in the distance. In that hush he could hear the
  pulsation of her screw with an extraordinary clearness. He made fast his
  tiller and, hooking back the doors, went into the cabin.</p>

  <p>"Mona!"</p>

  <p>He stooped over her bed. She was awake; her eyes shone in the darkness.
  Her arms closed about his neck. He felt her breath warm upon his cheek; and
  in the whisper of her voice he heard the loud cry of her young heart.</p>

  <p>"Mark! My Mark!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch05"
     id="ch05"></a>V. &mdash;THE RING</h2>

  <p class="first">"The buoy's straight ahead."</p>

  <p>"I see it, Mark."</p>

  <p>It was nine o'clock in the morning, the breeze from the north-east and the
  sea ripples of gold. The breeze, fresh and steady, had blown from that new
  quarter since six o'clock in the morning; and with the tide making under her
  keel, <i>Sea Flower</i> had raised Bury Head and left it behind and was now
  abreast of the Mewstone. That great rock, draped in the vivid emerald of its
  moss, shone like a jewel; and about its fin, serrated as any aiguille of Mont
  Blanc, the seabirds swooped and clustered and filled the air with their
  wailing and melancholy cries. Somewhere at hand, Mona understood, the Dart
  emptied its water into the sea, but she had to take the information on trust.
  For the <i>Sea Flower</i> was sailing past a curve of high cliffs, which to
  the eye ran in an unbroken sweep to the bold promontory of the Start.</p>

  <p>But as the Mewstone dropped away behind the little ship's quarter, the
  cliffs broke suddenly in the most unexpected and entrancing fashion. Mona had
  learnt by now not to let go the tiller and clap her hands. She contented
  herself with a gasp of delight. The door of the robbers' cavern had rolled
  aside. She was a second All Baba who achieved her miracle without an Open
  Sesame. A narrow entrance of shining water appeared by magic between high,
  steep, darkly-wooded cliffs. An old castle on the western side guarded it.
  Within she saw white villas clinging amongst the trees and, far down, ships
  at their anchors and a little town.</p>

  <p>"You must round the buoy," Thewliss cried energetically from the bows. He
  had just taken down the foresail and was stowing it in the sail locker. "The
  channel is west of the buoy," and as Mona bore away he dropped his nautical
  airs and began to laugh. "As a matter of fact, with our light draught we
  could go in on either side of the buoy, but there's nothing like being
  shipshape, is there?"</p>

  <p>And now it was his turn to gasp&mdash;and hold his tongue. Mona was
  sitting on the upper side of the helm; and since the <i>Sea Flower</i> was on
  the starboard tack, it was her left hand which held the tiller. Upon the
  third finger of her left hand there was a plain wedding-ring. For a moment
  Mark Thewliss was really moved. It was by gratitude, he asserted, by Mona's
  prevision. She had used a portion of her afternoon in London after the
  yachting cap had been bought to purchase this accessory to their expedition.
  She had thought of it, whereas he who should have thought of it had not.</p>

  <p>"After all, I know the gossip of the little harbours. There never was a
  tea-party to match them," he reflected. "Every little thing is noticed and
  passes from longshoreman to longshoreman and from yacht's crew to yacht's
  crew. The absence of a wedding-ring on Mona's finger would be a wounding
  inconvenience, not to be exaggerated, of course. It would be forgotten very
  quickly since the pair of us is unknown. But in each harbour we should feel
  it&mdash;a mosquito bite. I should have thought of it." He consoled himself
  with the sudden thought that even if he had thought of this device he would
  never have suggested it. No, it had to come from Mona herself, without
  prompting from him. And it had so come. Mark Thewliss was grateful.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's all right," he argued, meaning that he knew now why he had
  been so moved by the gleam of it on Mona's hand, and recognised that there
  was justification for this trifle of emotion. But&mdash;but&mdash;in the
  secret heart of him he was not satisfied. He was once more, and again rather
  resentfully, conscious of a discomfort&mdash;a tiny sense of shame which he
  was very careful not to follow back to its cause and origin. He had an
  excuse. For the <i>Sea Flower</i> had just rounded the buoy and was making
  for the entrance.</p>

  <p>"Keep her head on the two white beacons!" he cried, and he slipped the
  cover over the sail-locker and went aft. With the wind blowing from the
  northeast, more than one short tack had to be made before the long river
  front of Dartmouth was reached. They dropped their anchor above the ferry
  opposite to a deeply recessed bay; and it seemed to Mona that night that all
  the owls in the world were calling to her from those high, thickly wooded
  slopes.</p>

  <p>The summer favoured them. They ran the next day to Plymouth, idled through
  a long Sunday in Fowey, slept for a night under the over-arching trees of
  Helford River, beat through one long day round the Lizard to Penzance, and
  starting thence at daybreak with what is called a soldier's breeze, reached
  out past Land's End into the Atlantic and towards nightfall dropped anchor
  opposite St. Mary's in the islands of Scilly.</p>

  <p>In that enchanted archipelago, with its semitropical gardens and its touch
  of the exotic in the mere aspect of its inhabitants, they took their ease.
  They hired rooms of which the windows overlooked the Sound, and with a local
  boatman to pilot them amongst the intricacy of its rocks and shoals they
  explored the lonely waterways; bathing from beaches of dazzlingly white
  hour-glass sand crowned with thickets of yellow gorse, fishing for pollock,
  picnicking on the roofs of old ruined forts which had once been the last
  strongholds of King Charles.</p>

  <p>They ate the lotus, Mona throwing behind her even the knowledge of all
  that hung for her upon her enterprise, Mark Thewliss expanding into a boyhood
  which grew more and more nautical with every morning. Every rope was a
  hawser, every anchor a kedge, soldiers were "grabbies," landsmen did not
  count enough to have a generic name at all. Food, of course, was duff; and
  bells, not clocks, gave the time of day. The small intimate jokes which Mona
  had reckoned as the very salt of companionship were tossed back and forth
  between them. It became a creed that if Mona's yachting cap were lost they
  were doomed. There were words which Thewliss pronounced with too great a
  nicety for Mona's ears, for instance, the "p" in "psychic" and "pneumonia;"
  and elaborate conversations were invented by her leading up to a point when
  he, unaware of the trap into which he was being led, pronounced the ridiculed
  word. Mona had phrases too which led at once to a Socratic dialogue of the
  severest precision. If she could only be made to say "That just shows&mdash;"
  she was subjected at once to an examination of the most searching kind as to
  what it showed until the beach rang with their laughter. And amidst all their
  foolishness and sanity the golden wedding-ring shone upon Mona's finger.</p>

  <p>It was she who unwittingly broke the spell. They were taking their
  luncheon on the convex roof of an old fort on the outermost edge of Tresco.
  At their feet the punt was drawn up on the sand, and their pilot ate his
  sandwiches by the side of it. Out in the fairway of the creek the <i>Sea
  Flower</i> swung at its kedge with its mainsail scandalised Over all spread a
  sky without a cloud. Mona Lightfoot turned her face towards the west where on
  the quietest day the Atlantic rolled and broke with a flash of sunlit
  surf.</p>

  <p>"Here we are, actually at the end of England," she said.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>Mark Thewliss lit his pipe and turned to her with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Since you have seen where England begins, you ought to see where it ends,
  oughtn't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"To-morrow, then. If there's a wind. We oughtn't to wait. We're in
  September and half-way through the month. Some time in September the
  weather'll break. We ought to have got back to the mainland before it
  does."</p>

  <p>Mona caught her breath, and for a little while the earth was emptied of
  its joy, the day grew dark.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she agreed in a dull and reticent voice. The moon had rounded to
  the full. It hung over those islands on these warm nights, a huge disc of a
  colour golden-brown, drowning the stars, drenching the seas with light; and
  even in the morning, white as a wraith, it sought to hold the sky against the
  sun. The holiday was half over. From now on a shutter would close, hiding
  each night a little more of the night's radiance. Would it close over her
  heart, too, obliterating, not for a month, but for the rest of her life, the
  wondrous new world of joy and beauty and flowers into which a lily pond at
  the back of High Holborn had been the gateway?</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>And the next day, beyond Roseveare and Rosevean, those flat, outer islands
  where in the coarse salt grass the sea-birds make their nests, she saw over
  the bowsprit of the <i>Sea Flower</i> a tall, slim pillar standing alone
  amidst mist and spray. The Bishop Lighthouse. They anchored at the foot of
  it. But the Atlantic always thunders and frets against that rock. From the
  set-off forty feet above their heads, a cable attached to a windlass was
  flung out, caught by Thewliss and his pilot and passed through a block. A
  rough stirrup had been fashioned in the rope. Into this Mona set her foot;
  and whilst she clung to the cable with her hands at the level of her breast,
  she was swung outwards and upwards above the leap of the waves.</p>

  <p>Just for a moment the question flashed through her mind: "Shall I let go?
  Shall I end all now when life is at its best&mdash;before I know whether the
  shutter will close on me or not?" It would be easy. Nothing could save her if
  she fell into that surging mass of water between the cutter and the
  precipitous rock. It would be quick. But the temptation passed. That
  particular form of cowardice was not in her nature to commit. But when she
  stood at last on the narrow stone set-off, there was the look in her face
  which those who have survived great illnesses so long retain.</p>

  <p>Thewliss followed. They climbed to the great lantern and were told how on
  winter days green seas had smashed the glass and made the tower vibrate like
  a spring. It was two o'clock in the afternoon when, with a wind astern, they
  started back.</p>

  <p>"That's the end of England," said Mark, and both of them fell to silence.
  They were inward bound now. Mona looked backwards to the high column and
  forwards to the low mass of the islands. She must fix their aspect in her
  mind, lest never in her life again she should come this way.</p>

  <p>On Mark Thewliss, too, the influence of the eastward voyage was strong,
  but in a different way. He, the merest lodger in the fields of asphodel, was
  returning to the true activities of his life, invigorated, eager, his brain
  rich with new plans of advancement. He said:</p>

  <p>"I never told you, Mona, of the mess I made last winter at Mardyke and
  Campion's, did I?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"I promised to."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>She was standing up in the cockpit, her arms upon the cabin roof, looking
  out with a concentrated gaze over the waste of sea. A little more than a
  fortnight back she had known nothing of it. Its currents and races, the set
  of its tides, its splendours by day, its mystical refulgence by night, its
  myriad voices from the angry thunder at the Bishop's Rock to the liquid
  tinkle at a wooded anchorage, above all, its friendly solitudes&mdash;all
  these exquisite marvels of the created world had been hidden away from her.
  She had known a parade, a bathing machine, pierrots in a booth, and a beach
  cluttered with noise and people. No wonder she answered with an absent voice
  and turned away reluctantly. The sea was calling to her troubled, anxious
  heart as a mother calls to her child.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said. "Tell me!"</p>

  <p>"You had better go into the cabin and slip on an oilskin before you come
  aft. We are certain to get some of these waves hopping over the edge of the
  counter."</p>

  <p>Mona came aft a few minutes later with the oilskin buttoned about her
  throat and a sou'-wester on her head. She seated herself by the side of Mark
  Thewliss and whilst he steered the <i>Sea Flower</i> so that she presented
  her stern square to each threatening wave, he told his story.</p>

  <p>"I discovered how to produce synthetically the old Tyrrhian purple. In
  Roman days the dye was got from shell-fish&mdash;I suppose a sort of mussel.
  They called it 'Murex.' But the secret was lost, absolutely lost for two
  thousand years, until I got it a second time&mdash;oh, after hundreds of
  experiments. Look out!" He shouted as a breaking wave slapped the windward
  quarter of the ship and hopped over on to the deck with a splash, whipping
  both their faces with its spray. Mona laughed and wiped the water from cheeks
  wearing roses nowadays which they had never known before.</p>

  <p>"It's all right. I like it," she said, and Mark Thewliss resumed:</p>

  <p>"I persuaded Mardyke that I had at last got something which even the
  Germans, with their freedom from restriction and their better organisation,
  hadn't got. And that was a tough proposition, I can tell you. For he's a
  timorous soul, a great respecter of Governments&mdash;damn them!&mdash;and
  never for adventuring. A fine figure he'ld have cut in Elizabeth's time,
  wouldn't he?" and he spoke with a curious violence, as though he envisaged in
  the hesitating William Mardyke his own antagonist and obstacle. "Well,
  anyway, he was persuaded and put my fine new dye upon the market. There it
  was, the only genuine, A Imperial purple. We started off with the big drum
  beating. Even William rubbed his hands together and smiled graciously at his
  chemist. Fine! Yes, but complaints began to come in. Made in pretty frank
  language too. 'I don't like receiving rebukes of this kind,' William said to
  me, pulling a long upper lip. No, and I didn't like reading them either. But
  they were justified."</p>

  <p>"They were?" cried Mona, as much amazed that Mark Thewliss should confess
  to a failure as that he should have failed at all.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Guess what had happened?"</p>

  <p>"I can't."</p>

  <p>"My Imperial purple wouldn't stand the electric light, and of course the
  electric light has come to stay. By daylight&mdash;gorgeous, the exact
  Phoenician shade. But switch on' the light and it became a flaring, vivid
  scarlet. It wouldn't do, and I couldn't devise any way of altering it.
  William Mardyke made the only joke of his life over it, though he didn't mean
  to make any joke at all. He was furious in his timid way. He had lost some
  money and a certain amount of prestige amongst his clients. He said 'People
  won't submit to looking a Roman Emperor one moment and a Scarlet Woman the
  next. They find the transformation abrupt and offensive,'" and Mark Thewliss
  laughed. "Not so bad for William Mardyke, eh?"</p>

  <p>He was gaiety itself as he recalled the history of his expensive error.
  Mona stared at him.</p>

  <p>"And you don't mind?" she cried incredulously.</p>

  <p>But if Mark's point of view was dark to her, hers was no less dark to
  him.</p>

  <p>"The mistake?" he returned with a shrug of his shoulders. "Mistakes and
  failures are in the day's work unless you're a born genius with a fairy
  godmother, which I am not. Failures are the condition of success&mdash;that
  is, of any success worth having. You only reach the one through the
  experience you gain in committing the others. That's my belief."</p>

  <p>Yes, that was his belief; and the cost and the loss of prestige to Mardyke
  and Campion did not trouble him one whit. Set as he was upon his own personal
  advancement and ultimate triumph, he could even drag a value out of this
  rebuff. For it cost him nothing It only damaged the firm he served. Mona
  Lightfoot compared him for a moment to some glittering&mdash;perhaps
  soulless&mdash;stone which showed you now one, now another facet, and all
  equally hard, equally impenetrable. She had a sudden terror of him. She had
  hopefully entrusted to him everything that she had&mdash;and he had taken it.
  Did he value it? Was it just another one of those mistakes which were helpful
  to him but might be sheer ruin to the people he used?</p>

  <p>She drew back from him, but he did not notice her movement.</p>

  <p>"Of course I mind in a way," he continued, and a note of anxiety was
  audible in his voice. "I mind, you see, because that error might jeopardise
  my position with Mardyke&mdash;and just at this moment I want him."</p>

  <p>He suddenly reached out his hand, caught her arm and held it tight.</p>

  <p>"I want him terribly, Mona."</p>

  <p>His voice, his grasp were suddenly a prayer for her sympathy, for the
  solace of her companionship during the time of suspense and expectation. And
  as she had yielded to it in the saloon of the Frascati restaurant, so she
  weakened to it out here in the Atlantic. He was diamond-hard to the rest, for
  her he had supplications. Could there be flattery more insidious? Her heart
  leapt and the blood rushed into her face. He clasped her closer to him.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I need him terribly," he repeated nervously. It seemed that he was
  sure of her. He turned and, shaking off his anxieties, cried gaily:</p>

  <p>"Good-bye to the Bishop!"</p>

  <p>The lighthouse was a long way out of sight, for by now the <i>Sea
  Flower</i> was reaching up the Sound between Tresco and St. Mary's.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch06"
     id="ch06"></a>VI. &mdash;THE SHUTTER CLOSES</h2>

  <p class="first">The month had still six days to run when the <i>Sea
  Flower</i> on her eastward passage sailed past the red cliffs of Bigbury
  Bay.</p>

  <p>"Salcombe!" said Mark Thewliss with a little catch in his breath. For
  there letters were to be received.</p>

  <p>They crossed the bar on the flood, guided by the white splash of paint on
  the rock under the Head and the beacon on the hill behind the Moult.</p>

  <p>"That's all right now," said Mark as Mona steered the ship past the
  sub-tropical garden on the point; and though the <i>Sea Flower</i> had
  fathoms of water to spare at this moment, he spoke in a tone which Drake
  might have used when at last, after his three years' voyage, he got the
  <i>Golden Hind</i> safely moored by Deptford Quay.</p>

  <p>It was growing dark on a Saturday evening, and the lights were already
  blazing in the Marine Hotel and the houses on the water-front before they
  rounded the point at the head of the channel and anchored in the haven for
  small boats on the broad water below Kingsbridge.</p>

  <p>"The punt's leaking and the post office will be open to-morrow morning for
  an hour," said Thewliss. "There's a boat-builder I know here who might
  perhaps forget that to-morrow is Sunday. So I'll row round early and collect
  our letters."</p>

  <p>"I'll come with you," said Mona.</p>

  <p>Thewliss put her ashore at the narrow steps and rowed on to his
  boat-builder in the angle at the top of the town. He met her an hour
  afterwards outside the post office and gave her the oddest glance. She
  answered it directly.</p>

  <p>"I suppose that I had not the right to go with this lie upon my finger,"
  she said, and it was the first and last time that either of them had alluded
  to her wedding-ring. "But&mdash;but&mdash;I wanted to go."</p>

  <p>She would probably have been herself at some pains to describe exactly the
  motives which had taken her, on this last Sunday of their holiday, to the
  early service at the church. It was impious and she recognised its impiety,
  but her overcharged and anxious heart compelled her. At the back of her mind
  was the prayer that whatever news the expected letter might bring to Mark
  Thewliss, it might not mean for her what she had come to call "the end of
  everything."</p>

  <p>But besides the prayer she had been driven on by the acquiescence which
  was the very strength of her, the clear recognition of the things possible
  and the things impossible; and perhaps above all by the craving to get rid
  for a while of all the passionate hopes and aching fears which for so long
  had made their secret home with her, to kneel quietly and to receive. But
  Mark Thewliss had at his command an invaluable tact when matters awkward for
  his comfort were concerned. He was content with the one odd and puzzled
  glance&mdash;he would have avoided that if he had given thought to
  it&mdash;and handed her a couple of letters.</p>

  <p>"For you."</p>

  <p>One of the letters was written by Mary Tipper. It was full of heart and
  romantics and vulgarities.</p>

  <p class="letter">"I forward a letter from Liverpool"&mdash;Mona had given
  Mary Tipper's address at her lodging in Liverpool&mdash;"written by a
  gentleman, too, I do declare, unless my knowledge of handwriting misleads me.
  My dear girl, I am dying to hear from you. Is Poker-back on his knees to you?
  If so, keep him there. Marrow-bones for men! That's my motto." There was more
  to the same effect.</p>

  <p>The second letter was from Mr. Perriton, her employer, very woebegone and
  lachrymose and altogether composed in too supine a spirit to provoke any
  feeling except disdain. Mr. Perriton complained that he had received not a
  line from her, that he didn't even know her address at Bexhill. For himself,
  he couldn't settle to anything&mdash;he was very lonely&mdash;he had been to
  New Brighton in vain&mdash;work was accumulating in the office prospects were
  opening up&mdash;only he didn't seem to have the heart to cope with them.
  Mona read the letters as she walked up the long street, and crushed them into
  the side pocket of her coat.</p>

  <p>"And you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>He showed her an unbroken envelope.</p>

  <p>"Let us have breakfast first at the hotel. I'll read it on board the
  <i>Sea Flower</i>. Heaven knows what it says...I want privacy when I read
  it&mdash;just you and me."</p>

  <p>He, too, crammed his letter into the side pocket of his coat, but without
  any of Mona's indifference.</p>

  <p>"And the punt?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"It will be ready by midday. Meanwhile they have lent me one."</p>

  <p>An hour later in the cabin of the cutter he was still twisting the
  unopened letter over and over between his fingers.</p>

  <p>"Let me tell you about it, Mona."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered eagerly, and she sat at the cabin table opposite to
  him, her eyes fixed upon his face, her chin propped in the crutch of her
  joined hands. He wanted, then, to beat out with her the problem of his life
  and plans. How much of good augury for her hung upon his want? "Yes! Oh,
  yes."</p>

  <p>"I shall get the whole sequence clear in my own mind, shan't I, if I go
  through it step by step aloud," he explained, and he did not notice the light
  fade from her face. She was put in her place. She was to be the blackboard on
  which he chalked his sum to make sure that it was correct; and blackboards
  don't discuss.</p>

  <p>"We start with the plain fact that we have not yet by synthetic production
  competed successfully with the vegetable production of indigo. The plant is
  grown in Java and Bengal. Each leaf contains on an average 0.5 of colouring
  matter, and there is a great industry in Yorkshire living on the extraction
  of the dye. The plant is put into vats and fermented. A good deal of marsh
  gas and hydrogen are thrown off, and the liquid is run into other vats where
  the air acts as the oxidising agent and precipitates it. One of the drawbacks
  of natural production is that the plant contains so many other substances
  besides what we call indigotin that you can't depend upon getting one
  unvarying shade even from one vat. Of course the shade produced by synthetic
  indigo is always the same. It can only be carelessness if there's any
  variation. There are no other substances in the dye than what are known and
  wanted. Of course, too, synthetic indigo is cheaper. So that in two respects,
  economy and invariability of shade, we have the advantage over the
  Yorkshiremen. Do you follow?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mona.</p>

  <p>"But what we haven't synthetically got and they with their vat dyes
  naturally have is that delicate violet bloom, such as you see on fruit and on
  mountains too, which makes, say, velvet the most lovely of all the fabrics.
  The firm which can put a synthetic dye upon the market answering to that
  condition is going to sweep the field. Now look!"</p>

  <p>He turned round on the settee and took from a dispatch-case a flat parcel.
  He opened it, and from an inner wrapping of tissue-paper he spread out upon
  the table beneath Mona Lightfoot's eyes two squares of black silk-velvet,
  each measuring a foot square.</p>

  <p>"Now&mdash;you are the purchaser. Which do you choose?"</p>

  <p>Mona Lightfoot took them to the door of the cabin and compared them,
  holding them close to examine their texture and then at arm's length to judge
  their effect. Both pieces were delightful to the touch and charming to the
  eye; and both had the bloom of which Thewliss spoke, a tint of dark blue,
  softly shimmering, that came and went as the velvet was turned, evanescent,
  delicately sensuous, if such a term can be applied to a fabric. It was
  difficult for Mona to choose between them. But it seemed to her in the end
  that there was a depth, an effect of luxury and perfection in one which the
  other lacked.</p>

  <p>"This is lovely," she said, holding out the piece which she had
  selected.</p>

  <p>Mark Thewliss blew her a kiss.</p>

  <p>"Mine!" he said triumphantly.</p>

  <p>He took the piece in his hands, and his long slim fingers caressed it ever
  so daintily. Mona could never quite reconcile the slenderness of his fingers
  and his lightness of touch with the wiry strength of his lean body; just as
  she could never fit his almost feminine appreciation of delicate colours and
  exquisite fabrics into a harmony with the granite in his character and his
  practical earthbound ambitions.</p>

  <p>"Yes, this is my doing," he continued, and was silent for a moment.
  Then:</p>

  <p>"Isn't it curious? They say romance is dead. But here are you and I in a
  little cabin of a little cutter in Salcombe estuary with two little square
  pieces of black velvet between us, and one of them means the end of an
  industry in Yorkshire and of plantations in the Far East, and makes a great
  avenue out of this cabin to all that a man could desire."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Mona replied. "Mardyke and Campion's will jump at it."</p>

  <p>"They'll jump at my price for it, too," Mark Thewliss returned grimly,
  "but in quite another way."</p>

  <p>He folded up the pieces of velvet and put them back into the case.</p>

  <p>"You see, Mona, it's like this. This is my discovery, my secret. I have
  tested it in every way. Electric light can't play one trick on it. It's sure.
  I look at myself in the glass in the morning, and I say 'Your name's Brainy
  Boy.'"</p>

  <p>Mona laughed, though she had little heart for laughter at that moment.</p>

  <p>"You say that to yourself, do you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and I argue a little, too. I ask why should Mardyke and Campion get
  all the cash and the glory, while poor Pillicoddy Thewliss gets at the most a
  beggarly rise of his salary. No, missy. So I go for the big figures." He
  nodded his head with confidence and then gasped a little at his own
  audacity.</p>

  <p>"What did you do?"</p>

  <p>"I wrote a letter saying what I had succeeded in doing and enclosing a
  sample like that which I showed you; and I stated that if Mardyke and
  Campion's wished to retain my services and have the benefit of my discovery,
  they must pay me a salary&mdash;well, I get eight hundred a year now&mdash;a
  salary of&mdash;what do you think?"</p>

  <p>"I can't guess."</p>

  <p>"Ten thousand a year."</p>

  <p>"Oh!"</p>

  <p>Mona Lightfoot sat back in her chair and stared at Thewliss. She thought
  of William Mardyke and his timidities.</p>

  <p>"He'll never do that. What did you call him?"</p>

  <p>"A funkstick. Yes, I know. But look at it this way. He won't pay me more
  than one year's salary The secret will be known in a year. Very likely a
  patent will have to be taken out. I can't afford to do that. He'll have to do
  it, and he'll know the process. He won't want me any more. He'll just give me
  the sack. Right! But I shall have ten thousand pounds in my pocket, and with
  ten thousand pounds I can set up a laboratory of my own."</p>

  <p>"And if he doesn't agree?" asked Mona.</p>

  <p>"Yes. If he doesn't agree! There it is!" and Thewliss returned to his
  unopened letter. "There's the risk. I've got that little mistake about the
  Tyrrhian purple against me. I'm out of a job with a bad mark against my name.
  Yes, it's a risk," and then his face flushed and with a sudden violence he
  beat his tremors down. "But I've thought it out.' No man coming from nothing
  without a penny to back him has ever reached the great position, the high
  power, without taking such risks, not once but twenty times, as I am prepared
  to do. Let's see what Mr. Stay-as-we-are has got to say."</p>

  <p>He tore open the envelope and read the letter. All the writing was upon
  one page, but it seemed to Mona that Mark took an eternity to read it. He
  laid it down in the end, folded it with an almost finical precision and put
  it back into the torn envelope. His face had grown pale beneath its tan, but
  Mona could draw no inference from that pallor. She was indeed too deeply
  wounded to give much thought to anything.</p>

  <p>"If he had wanted me to share his joys and his disappointments, he would
  have shown me that letter. He would have tossed it across the table the
  moment he had read it, eagerly, and watched my face whilst in turn I read,"
  she argued. He looked on her as an Oriental might. She was the unconsidered
  solace.</p>

  <p>"You ask me no questions," he said at length, a little fretfully. He
  wanted the flattery of her questions.</p>

  <p>"None."</p>

  <p>"Mardyke offers me a partnership."</p>

  <p>For a moment there was complete silence in the cabin. A rowing boat
  occupied by some children went splashing past the cutter amidst cries and
  young laughter.</p>

  <p>"I never thought of that solution," Mark Thewliss resumed, speaking aloud,
  but to himself rather than to her. "Yet I might have thought of it. Yes. You
  remember Gregory, the head clerk? He was prepared for it. When I passed
  through the office on my way out the day I met you, he climbed down from his
  high stool and hurried across the room to open the door for me. Pretty
  significant that, from old Gregory. He had theories, hadn't he? Some men are
  born servants and others born masters. He managed to possess a queer sort of
  dignity from recognising that he was a born servant. When he hurried across
  the room to open the door for me, it wasn't mere servility. No! He understood
  that I belonged to the others..." He looked up to find that the cabin held no
  occupant but himself.</p>

  <p>Mona had slipped out, leaving him absorbed in his triumph. She stood now
  upon the deck with her hand about a stay, striving to rejoice too. He had
  staked high and won. She was glad&mdash;yes, she was determined to be glad.
  She herself had staked higher still and lost. Well, she had done it with her
  eyes open. She must not show any sorrow that she had lost, lest she should
  appear to reproach or to appeal. Luckily there was little time left during
  which she must keep a guard on her every word, her every look. For the sorrow
  was there welling up in her heart like blood in a wound.</p>

  <p>She looked about her. At the end of the creek, the little town of
  Kingsbridge ran up in a line into an angle of dark trees. A small boat was
  tacking across the estuary to the mark of the old lime-kiln. Opposite to her
  the tranquil creek to Southbourne narrowed between high curving fields, where
  the hay still lay, and coppices of thick trees. She wanted to engrave that
  quiet scene upon her memory, since she was never likely to look on it again.
  But there was a mist of tears before her eyes and her lips shook.</p>

  <p>"Mona! Mona!"</p>

  <p>She stooped watching with great concentration a small round tin spinning
  down on the tide.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered.</p>

  <p>Mark Thewliss was at her side before she looked up. Even then she dared
  not look as high as his face.</p>

  <p>"I was wondering...The punt will be finished this morning."</p>

  <p>Mona nodded.</p>

  <p>"You'll want to get back at once. You ought to, I think."</p>

  <p>"We lose a few days of our holiday."</p>

  <p>"What does that matter?"</p>

  <p>The magical holiday had lost all its magic. The sooner it came to an end
  now, the better.</p>

  <p>"I ought to write and post a letter to William Mardyke. Then we might pick
  up the punt and sail round the Start this afternoon, ready to take the West
  Bay in the morning."</p>

  <p>On a slope of stone at the boat-builder's yard, an old whiskered man was
  finishing his work upon the punt.</p>

  <p>"It's all ready now," he said, and he slid it down into the water and
  replaced its cushions and sculls and fitted on the rudder. "I don't think as
  she'll give you any trouble. But if any of them nails start, you'll just have
  to hammer them in again. I'll give you my mallet as a wedding-present," and
  with a friendly chuckle he put the mallet in the boat and shoved her off.
  Mona never saw the man again, never knew more of his name than the initial
  "M" burnt into the wood, and within five minutes the trifling incident had
  passed for many years from her memory.</p>

  <p>They anchored that night in the Dart, but nearer the entrance than before
  so that they might make an early start in the morning. Mark Thewliss was
  uneasy. There was very little of the moon left to see, the shutter had moved
  so far across the face of it, and that little was seen through a vapour like
  thin smoke. The wind, too, was shifting. "When it goes round against the sun
  at this time of the year," he said, "you have got to watch it."</p>

  <p>He went down into the cabin and got out his Norrie.</p>

  <p>"Dartmouth's a curious place. Going west from it you ought to start four
  hours after high tide; going east, two hours before."</p>

  <p>He looked up his tide tables.</p>

  <p>"High tide's at nine. So we'll start at seven."</p>

  <p>Mona slept restlessly through the early part of the night and heavily
  'towards morning. She was only awakened by the clatter of preparation upon
  deck. She slipped on an overcoat and ran out to find Mark taking a couple of
  reefs in his main sail.</p>

  <p>"We shall have bad weather coming up behind us," he said. "We ought,
  however, to blow across the bay before the worst of it reaches us." He paused
  in his work to look about him. "There's always the train, of course. What do
  you say? I shouldn't be surprised to see the west cone hoisted at any
  moment."</p>

  <p>"What would you do if you were alone?" Mona asked.</p>

  <p>"I should go out at seven o'clock," he replied with a laugh, which had in
  it a thrill of deep enjoyment. "The <i>Sea Flower</i> wasn't built for a
  tea-party in the Solent. If the seas get too heavy we can heave to, and
  she'll ride out the gale like a duck."</p>

  <p>"I'll get breakfast ready," said Mona.</p>

  <p>It was in her mind that she did not care what happened on the passage
  across the West Bay. For now there was not left even as much of her holiday
  moon as that slender sickle which had shone down when, ages and ages ago,
  they had first sailed from Poole. The shutter had moved across it until not
  one gilded edge was left. Even after the <i>Sea Flower</i> was reaching to
  the entrance of the river, the smooth water and the high hills holding off
  the squalls, misled her; so that she made light of the wrack of clouds
  tearing across the sky, the leaden menace of the day, and the seas which far
  away humped themselves against the horizon in ever melting mountain
  chains.</p>

  <p>It was not until they were outside the Mewstone&mdash;its emerald green
  all sobered to a livid grey and not a sea-bird's wail audible above the
  storm&mdash;that the wind smote them. The <i>Sea Flower</i> leapt like a stag
  surprised, lurched and was flung forward, her bows crashing upon the waves.
  Mona, hurled across the cockpit, sank on to its floor. There was such a roar
  of sea and wind as made her dizzy. She had thought that she hadn't cared what
  was going to happen; but in the presence of this elemental fury she crouched
  sick with fear. Mark reached down a hand and patted her shoulder. He shouted
  some words. She could not hear what they were, but the expression of his face
  told her that they were words of encouragement. It couldn't be that any ship
  could live in such a welter; it couldn't be that the planks would hold
  together against the massive blows of the succeeding waves. But the ship did
  live; rolling and creaking and groaning it fled across the open bay.</p>

  <p>Mona watched Mark Thewliss' face. It was never still. Now his head was
  turned astern watching the great waves as they rushed forwards; now he stared
  at the sail lest the wind should get behind it; and the tiller in his hand
  was never still either, as now he eased it to take the thrust of a billow,
  now he held the cutter to her course. After a while Mona climbed on to the
  seat and clung to the combing. The air was thick with spume, the wind tore
  across the sea in black squalls, the water itself was blistered and gleamed
  with points of steel. In a moment of relaxation Thewliss bent and bawled in
  her ear:</p>

  <p>"We should think nothing of this on a liner."</p>

  <p>But they were not on a liner; and for the life of her Mona could not
  understand why each big green wave, racing up with so much bluster and
  menace, slipped away under the long counter and only flung a lump or two of
  heavy water over them into the cockpit. There was no question and indeed no
  thought of meals that day. Before two o'clock Mona saw in a break of the
  storm the great bluff of Portland ahead of them in the north-east. Here was a
  new terror.</p>

  <p>"The Race!" she cried, making a trumpet of her hands.</p>

  <p>Mark reassured her with a smile.</p>

  <p>"I am keeping outside it."</p>

  <p>The wind veered round to the north after midday, and the seas diminished
  in violence, coming off the land and taking the cutter on its port side so
  that it could be steered with less danger of a gybe and a broach to. It was
  now four o'clock in the afternoon and Weymouth Bay was opening up beyond the
  Bill. All through those hours Mark Thewliss had sat at the tiller, never for
  a moment relaxing his attention, soaked to the skin and blue with cold.</p>

  <p>"The worst of it's over," he said, stretching his cramped limbs. "We'll
  make across the bay to Lulworth Cove. We can lie quiet there to-night."</p>

  <p>Wind and sea plagued the <i>Sea Flower</i> less and less as she felt the
  shelter of the downs. Mona saw again the white road running up the hill to
  the solitary tree, and the uncomplimentary horseman turning his tail to the
  town; and in an incredibly short time the steep escarpment of the Lulworth
  cliffs and the ochre-coloured coastguard station were close at hand. The
  <i>Sea Flower</i> passed through the narrow portals, her cockpit swimming
  with water and the stain of the sea darkening her sail to the peak. In that
  quiet haven she came to rest.</p>

  <p>"What I want is a whisky and soda," said Mark with a grin.</p>

  <p>The cabin was a scene of wreckage and disorder. Everything which should be
  on a shelf was on the floor, and everything that could be broken was broken.
  Thewliss replaced the cushions on the settee and Mona got the whisky and the
  soda-water bottles and the glasses from their racks.</p>

  <p>"Good, eh?" said Mark as he emptied his glass in a single draught. Mona
  took hers in a more leisurely way.</p>

  <p>Thewliss opened his oilskin coat, replenished his glass, and lit a
  pipe.</p>

  <p>"<i>A</i> ship the <i>Sea Flower</i>," and he patted the ledge of the
  settee in commendation. Mona watched him with shining eyes.</p>

  <p>"This morning&mdash;before we started out of Dartmouth&mdash;you knew what
  we were in for?"</p>

  <p>"Pretty well."</p>

  <p>"And it was dangerous&mdash;really dangerous&mdash;all the way?"</p>

  <p>"All the way to Weymouth Bay. If a following sea had broken upon us or if
  we had broached to&mdash;we were done."</p>

  <p>"Yet you took the risk?"</p>

  <p>"I offered to send you on by train, didn't I?" he urged.</p>

  <p>"I wasn't thinking of myself. You had that partnership in your
  pocket."</p>

  <p>Thewliss nodded his head.</p>

  <p>"I was mad, I suppose." Then he broke into a hearty laugh. "But I couldn't
  have borne to turn tail like the horseman in the chalk. Not for a thousand
  partnerships! I enjoyed it, too. I was frightened out of my life, but I
  enjoyed it."</p>

  <p>That day had set him high again on a throne in Mona's heart. There had
  been moments when the feet of clay had obtruded upon her vision. But here was
  the man she had dreamed of, putting gallantly everything&mdash;herself of
  course, but even life that he so clung to&mdash;in the scales. To her he was
  made of the fibre of the gods...and he was not for her.</p>

  <p>The storm blew itself out in the night, and starting early with a fair
  wind on their beam they made the Isle of Wight by midday, struggled against
  the tide for three hours opposite to Hurst Castle and towards evening beat up
  Southampton Water. Mark was forward, stowing away the foresail in the hatch,
  when they approached a buoy with its name staring in white letters from the
  black paint.</p>

  <p>"Keep clear of the Dean's Elbow," he cried.</p>

  <p>Mona put the cutter about.</p>

  <p>"We have kept clear of the Dean's Elbow, and the Bishop too, my dear," she
  answered with a little smile; and, leaning over to one side, she slipped the
  wedding-ring off her finger and let it fall into the water.</p>

  <p>Mark Thewliss left for London by the breakfast train on the next morning.
  Mona, who had two hours before her cross-country journey to the north, saw
  him off. Mark showed the grace of a great embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"You have been wonderful to me, Mona. I have never had such a splendid
  month in my life," He shifted from one foot to the other. "You'll let me hear
  from you?"</p>

  <p>Mona nodded her head. She could not trust her lips to speak. And the
  whistle blew. Mona walked out of the station when the train had disappeared,
  and stood at the rails of the sea-wall looking down Southampton Water. She
  could see quite clearly the <i>Sea Flower</i> at its anchor. There were two
  men upon her deck, who had been summoned by telegraph the night before to
  take her round to a yard on the Hamble River. Mona saw the mainsail hoisted
  and the jib broken out. She watched the cutter move down the channel until
  her tears blinded her. She had never dreamed that anyone could feel so
  desolate.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch07"
     id="ch07"></a>VII. &mdash;GETTING ON</h2>

  <p class="first">"The Honourable Member for the Amworth Division."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Speaker, Question forty-eight of the Chancellor of the
  Exchequer."</p>

  <p>"In answer to the Honourable Member..."</p>

  <p>"Arising out of that answer, Mr. Speaker, I should like to ask the
  Chancellor of the Exchequer..."</p>

  <p>Question and answer, supplementary question and supplementary answer, were
  being exchanged across the floor of the great Chamber up the stairs,
  sometimes with a genuine desire for knowledge, sometimes to gratify a
  valuable constituent, sometimes just to get one on. Mark Thewliss, walking
  the Terrace alone on a February afternoon at three o'clock, wished that the
  question time could be extended until the House rose at eleven o'clock of the
  evening. He might be a coward&mdash;he was perfectly willing to admit that he
  was&mdash;but he did wish it extremely. He walked up and down. He had on
  neither overcoat nor hat. It was cold but he did not feel cold, for his
  physical sensations were in a very complete abeyance.</p>

  <p>He had the sequence of his argument in order, so long of course as he did
  not lose one of the main links&mdash;an occurrence which was indeed very
  possible, if not unavoidable. On the whole he was inclined to consider it
  unavoidable. He was sure, however, of his facts and figures. For they had not
  been worked up from pamphlets and textbooks, they were the commonplaces of
  his daily life. Yes, he was sure of his ground there, if only his mind didn't
  suddenly go blank. Minds often did, even the best minds, much better minds
  than his. Darkness descended upon them, inextricable, swathing them in thick
  folds. He himself had never yet been reduced to an ashamed and tingling
  cipher by one of these seizures, but they always chose ruinous moments. There
  was a slang phrase which described them&mdash;horribly graphic, too, like
  most slang phrases. To go blah. Well, there it was! He, Mark Thewliss, would
  go blah this afternoon.</p>

  <p>"Let me repeat it," he reflected, shaking himself back into his wits. "The
  Right Honourable gentleman's line of thought must always&mdash;and I say it
  with sincerity and deference&mdash;command the sympathetic attention of the
  House, but in this instance..."</p>

  <p>All very good, but supposing the Right Honourable gentleman didn't deploy
  that line of thought at all&mdash;where was he, Mark Thewliss? On his
  legs&mdash;and with nothing to say.</p>

  <p>"But he must use that line of thought," Mark argued with a little more of
  his native confidence. "I have watched him, listened to him, examined the
  works&mdash;yes, he'll think like that, speak like that...Of course I'll have
  to get the best opening I can out of what he says. I couldn't prepare
  that...I must appear to be debating even if I am not."</p>

  <p>He noticed a lot of small yachts moored on the other side of the Thames
  under St. Thomas' Hospital. They had always been moored there, but he had
  never realised before what singularly sensible people their proprietors were.
  Now if he had only got the <i>Sea Flower</i> moored over there, he could nip
  across Westminster Bridge, cast off and, with this wind blowing, be abreast
  of the Savoy Hotel before the Right Honourable gentleman had begun to think
  aloud with that mixture of languid grace, halting speech and intellectual
  clarity which made him at once so attractive and so formidable a figure.</p>

  <p>But the <i>Sea Flower</i> wasn't moored there. She was in a yard on the
  Hamble river and had been for a good many years, waiting&mdash;after all what
  for? For a summer when he would have her sold. He was always quick to make
  that assertion whenever the question forced itself into his mind, as it would
  at awkward moments when he was not upon his guard. Such a moment was
  dangerously near to him now. Ambition was all folly. There were sprigs of the
  great families already in the House of Commons at the age of twenty-two. They
  had by twenty good years the advantage over their competitors. They could
  afford to sit mum for five years and then rise up in an arena no more
  alarming to them than the side walks in front of their houses. What was he
  doing here, a new member at the age of forty-four?</p>

  <p>"Mr. Speaker, it would need an audacity greater than mine to follow the
  Right Honourable gentleman, but for&mdash;-"</p>

  <p>How utterly, damnably, trivial and silly it sounded. "Thinking it out,
  eh?"</p>

  <p>A friendly hand fell upon his arm. Mark Thewliss turned with a jerk to see
  Lord Catherstone, a Junior Lord of the Treasury, smiling at him out of a
  friendly rubicund round face.</p>

  <p>"Are questions over?" he asked in alarm.</p>

  <p>"Not a bit of it. Five more minutes, then the division over the suspension
  of the eleven o'clock rule. There'll be half an hour before your man's
  up."</p>

  <p>Suddenly Mark Thewliss felt that he couldn't wait for half an hour. Rules
  or no rules, his man must get up at once. Mark took a step towards the door,
  but the friendly hand restrained him.</p>

  <p>"Take your time! Don't even hurry when R. T. sits down. The Speaker will
  call on you all right. That's been arranged." Yes, that had been arranged. He
  had always thought that he would sink through the floor with humiliation if
  he had to rise eight or nine times and never be called upon. Now he would
  adore it.</p>

  <p>"You'll make a success all right," said the Junior Whip, with the
  experience of seven years at his back.</p>

  <p>"If nerves can do it!"</p>

  <p>"Nerves do do it."</p>

  <p>"Not always."</p>

  <p>Mark Thewliss recalled to Lord Catherstone the brilliant young Marcellus
  of the Law, who had sprung out of a northern city and swept the political
  world off its feet.</p>

  <p>"I asked him if he was nervous, and he said&mdash;you know how his
  supercilious look breaks up into the friendliest human sort of grin. 'No.
  From my earliest childhood I lisped in numbers and the numbers came. They
  weren't very good numbers, but they came.'"</p>

  <p>Catherstone laughed.</p>

  <p>"I can cap that. You weren't in the House with that hardened old sinner
  Miramond. He once asked me to arrange that he should speak in a debate which
  was proceeding. It was an Imperial question and I was astonished. I said,
  'Why? It isn't your subject.' He answered: 'I know that. But I'm wearing a
  new set of teeth and I want to try 'em out.' What do you say to that?"</p>

  <p>"That I should be half inclined to give my teeth for a cynicism so
  sublime," Thewliss returned.</p>

  <p>The Junior Whip, having done his friendly office, went upon his busy way.
  Members began to stroll out upon the Terrace. Questions were at an end. The
  Division bells started ringing. It was at once a comfort, a spur, and an
  added terror to Thewliss to realise, as he could not but do, that the
  Government was nursing him He recorded his vote and took his seat behind the
  Treasury Bench; he was in for it now, and as "R. T." rose from the Opposition
  Front Bench, the turbulence of his emotions went down like a sea in a falling
  wind. He was just as nervous, but he was no longer aware of his nervousness.
  He listened for words which would give him the opportunity of a natural,
  effective, debating introduction.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>There are on an average six maiden speeches made in every new Parliament,
  each of which in turn is declared the day after its delivery to be the best
  maiden speech ever made. Mark Thewliss' was one of the six in that
  Parliament. He was helped by circumstances. For on a subject which was
  creating uneasiness throughout the country he had something genuinely
  reassuring to contribute out of his own particular knowledge and experience.
  Only an unfortunate manner could have spoilt him, but he had sat watching for
  too many weeks, with too shrewd an eye for a lapse of tact or an exhibition
  of bumptiousness, to make an error in that direction.</p>

  <p>At Grillion's, the famous dining-club of the elder statesmen, the speech
  received attention that evening. Said R.T., with that generosity of his which
  was due as much to his philosophic detachment as to a warmth of heart:</p>

  <p>"It was the speech of a man bred in the modern tradition. It wasn't
  sing-song, it wasn't a lecture, it wasn't oratory and, thank Heaven, it
  wasn't rhetoric. It was conversation on a plane above
  conversation&mdash;conversation sharpened to a point by just phrases and a
  progression of ideas."</p>

  <p>The veteran statesman had done a really generous action that afternoon.
  The subject of the debate was the Naval Estimates, which at that time, owing
  to the rapid development of the German navy and the bellicose drum-beating
  which played it in, were being watched with profound interest in England.
  "R.T.," as he was affectionately known, moved a reduction of a hundred pounds
  in the First Lord's salary in order to call attention to the dangerous
  parsimony of the Admiralty in the matter of high explosive ammunition. It was
  understood that the First Lord himself would reply at eleven o'clock to the
  whole debate, and a good many members were leaving their places when Mark
  Thewliss was called upon. But the traditional courtesy of the place prevailed
  over the attractions of the lobby and the smoking-room.</p>

  <p>"Who is this fellow?" asked Colonel Westram, a dapper, genial politician
  with the safest seat in England and a fresh carnation every day resplendent
  in his button-hole.</p>

  <p>"Thewliss. He's head of one of the big dye industries," replied the
  Colonel's neighbour, fixing a critical eyeglass in his eye. "Looks all right.
  But he doesn't give me the impression that he's going to cut much of a figure
  here."</p>

  <p>"Wait a bit," said the Colonel.</p>

  <p>Thewliss had begun his speech in a voice which sounded intolerably thin to
  his own ears, and indeed was discouragingly weak to his audience. There
  flashed into that disobedient secondary consciousness which will begin its
  aggravating functions at the most unaccommodating moments, a long procession
  of people who had failed when they first sought the attention of the House of
  Commons, from Phineas Finn in fiction to the young Disraeli in reality.</p>

  <p>Then he took a hold upon himself. He had, after all, an argument of his
  own based upon facts of his own. That the surplus of high explosives should
  be small was wisdom and not parsimony. The ingredients such as picric acid,
  of which as a chemist concerned with synthetic dyes he knew something, could
  not be mixed and stored for long periods without losing their effectiveness.
  He gave shortly and in a formula which could be understood the ratio of loss.
  To keep a huge accumulation of such ammunition would only encourage a
  confidence which in the day of trial would be disastrous...And suddenly he
  was aware that his voice had volume, and was reaching without one high forced
  note, to every corner of the Chamber. Here and there a member, fetched out of
  the smoking-room or the lobby or the reading-room, by the word that something
  real was being said, slipped quietly into a seat near to the door by which he
  had entered. And no one went away. Thewliss' secondary consciousness got to
  work again with an even subtler malevolence, determined to thwart him,
  insistent that he should fail. It began to whisper to him:</p>

  <p>"This is power. This is what you have lived for. The sensation of power.
  The hour on the Alpine peak You're a novice and all these members, experts in
  speeches, many of them sated with thirty years of speeches, are listening to
  yours. Isn't it good? ISN'T IT GOOD?"</p>

  <p>The secondary consciousness grew clamorous. Thewliss could not but
  respond. An intoxication of pleasure which was nothing less than voluptuous
  ran through his veins&mdash;and suddenly his mind went blank. There was even
  a darkness before his eyes. He babbled a word or two, he saw here and there a
  curious glance directed at him, and the sight gave back to him his wits.</p>

  <p>The remedy for the deficiency in high explosives was not to be found in an
  accumulation of old shells. It was to be sought for in the capacity for rapid
  mobilisation of all the factories which could be adapted to the manufacture
  of new ones. Pre-eminent amongst them were those which in peace-time were
  devoted to the production of dyes. His speech was marching again
  now&mdash;measured, resonant, convincing. He could promise&mdash;he had the
  authority to promise on behalf of his fellow manufacturers and
  chemists&mdash;that at the first hint of need their men, their knowledge,
  their stocks, their laboratories and machines would be ungrudgingly placed at
  the disposal of the crown, whatever government ruled the country. The pity
  was there were so few of them. If the Government could only see its way so
  far to reform the patent laws that foreigners should be prevented from taking
  out patents and then leaving them unworked, so that without fear of rivalry
  they could produce at their ease in their own country, the opportunities upon
  which the Government could in an emergency rely would be enormously
  increased.</p>

  <p>Thewliss sat down amidst a generous good-will. He had spoken for twenty
  minutes&mdash;the right length. He had made a contribution. Even the little
  plea at the end of his speech which should help his own particular interests,
  did him no harm. It had been so deftly introduced that it seemed a necessary
  part of his argument; and just for that reason it provoked an admiring
  amusement in an assembly never without its cynics. The Prime Minister turned
  round and shook him by the hand, and crowning generosity and crowning
  triumph, the great leader with whom he had contended sauntered round behind
  the Speaker's chair and sat by his side for a few minutes with words of
  praise.</p>

  <p>"I told you so," said the young Whip, sidling along the bench to him half
  an hour later. "Now you must sit through the rest of this debate. The House
  of Commons doesn't give twopence for men who shoot in, fire off their bit,
  and go galumphing away. Dine here and don't take more than three-quarters of
  an hour. I'll get three or four fellows and we'll go round to the club and
  have supper afterwards."</p>

  <p>At supper the conversation turned, as on such occasions it will, to the
  making of careers.</p>

  <p>"Hard work doesn't do it," said one of them, a shrewd and wealthy
  landowner, who hunted his own hounds, ran his own county, and carried a great
  name as great names should be carried. "Hard work leaves you a clerk. You've
  got to have luck and a guiding principle, learnt early in life and clung to.
  Now you!" he turned to Thewliss. "You are over forty. You are a rich man,
  you're in the House, you've made a success there, and you tell me you come
  out of nowhere. What's your guiding principle?"</p>

  <p>"I have two," Thewliss answered instantly. "One, to know what I know. The
  other just as simple, and I think just as rare. To want what I want."</p>

     id="ch08"></a>VIII. &mdash;ACCORDING TO PLAN</h2>

  <p class="first">"Well, what is it to be?" Catherstone asked of Mark Thewliss
  a few days afterwards. It was seven o'clock in the evening and Catherstone
  was on the door. His business was to make sure that of the members hurrying
  out of the Lobby cloister to Palace Yard and their dinners, enough would
  return to protect the Government from a snap-vote. His conversation,
  therefore, was a little disjointed. It ran: "You will be back by ten o'clock,
  won't you, Mr. Doby?...Well, what is it to be, Thewliss?...Have you got your
  pair, Freddie?...All right. What is it to be?" and he pulled Thewliss down on
  to the cushioned seat beside the door. "The rough and tumble? Or the
  occasional set speech with the red carpet down?"</p>

  <p>"The rough and tumble," Thewliss answered.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to hear it. Debate's the life-blood of the House, set speeches
  only its jewellery," Catherstone agreed cordially. But one of his duties was
  to persuade the new members that loquacity was the privilege of the Front
  Bench and silent admiration the fitting decoration of those who sat behind.
  So he added: "But not too often, of course."</p>

  <p>The warning was unnecessary. Mark Thewliss was too shrewd and too busy to
  waste the small prestige he had acquired by incursions into controversies
  where he had nothing to contribute. But he sat assiduously in the Chamber,
  speaking now and then briefly in the committee stages of a Bill to an
  argument which he could demolish or reinforce, and twice only, during the
  rest of the long session, for some twenty minutes on the broader questions of
  principles of policy. By the time when the House had risen in August, Mark
  Thewliss had risen too into the small company of the coming men.</p>

  <p>It followed that a good many houses of which he only knew the exterior
  opened their doors to him. To make room for them he closed a good many doors
  himself. He had no compunction. It was all according to plan and therefore
  satisfactory. He was on the march. Old friends meant nothing to a man who had
  no friends at all. He moved down from Highgate to Mayfair, and at the first
  turn of the road Highgate ceased to be. A small house in Grosvenor Street
  received him; furniture chosen with a fastidious care ministered to his pride
  of ownership; the best <i>chef</i> whom money could hire cooked for him; and
  during such spare time as he could snatch, he proceeded to put into practice
  a number of little schemes excogitated against just this occasion during the
  years of bivouac at Highgate.</p>

  <p>Soon after Parliament resumed he began to give a series of small dinner
  parties at which wines, food and guests were so choicely matched that in a
  very short time to receive an invitation to one of them became a tiny mark of
  distinction. And he was most careful not to advertise them.</p>

  <p>"Advertisement is necessary," he had been heard to say amongst those
  acquaintances whose reminiscences could not trouble him now, "but the best
  way to advertise is by not advertising, by declaring from every roof-top at
  the full pressure of your lungs that you stand aloof from such
  vulgarity."</p>

  <p>Thus he never granted an interview, but he would explain to the would-be
  interviewer why. His busy life amongst his beloved chemicals and his public
  duties left him leisure so scant that he was jealous of every instant of it.
  And such explanations appeared of course in print, attesting a rare modesty
  and widely resounding to his credit. But he cultivated with care the high
  dignitaries of the press; and whenever he made some small success of value to
  a man on the march, a flattering little letter would be written in his own
  hand to one of them; and the dignitaries being friendly and human, saw
  through the flattery and printed the useful occurrence amongst the items of
  public news. He had a remarkable <i>flair</i> for the men who were going to
  succeed, and the swiftest forgetfulness of the old Caspars who had served
  their turn.</p>

  <p>"Never neglect the little things," he warned himself; and so he had a blue
  door to his house. It was the only blue door in the street.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid my little blue door won't open itself to interviewers,
  however winningly they knock," he would write, and the interviewers would in
  default of their interview make up the cleverest fables about that little
  blue door, until in a very short time it became quite a famous object in
  Grosvenor Street.</p>

  <p>"There it is! That's the door. Mark Thewliss' house, isn't it? A
  remarkable character according to all accounts. And he never advertises.
  Unusual in these days, eh? But it's a fact. I read in the <i>Daily
  Telescope</i> only yesterday that he didn't and wouldn't. A type one
  respects."</p>

  <p>And even those who could never walk along Grosvenor Street, the
  inhabitants of Aberdeen and Glasgow, dwellers in far Cornwall and the great
  noisy cities of Northern England, got gradually to know of a personage of a
  most resounding reticence who was hidden behind a blue door in Mayfair.</p>

  <p>All was going according to plan. With the opening of the second session of
  Parliament the little dinner parties were resumed. One or two of the familiar
  figures were dropped out&mdash;they were disappointing people who had lost
  their hold upon the public&mdash;and one or two new ones were set up in their
  places, fine talkative fellows on the very froth of success. Certainly Mark
  Thewliss was on the march all through this year under summer skies. He looked
  up at them often enough. For though his class-room had been a laboratory, and
  he knew nothing of the Greek dramatists but their names, he had an
  instinctive fear of the insolence which brings disaster in its train. He was
  wary of the great fist with the mallet which had dashed so many of his kind
  bleeding to the earth. He felt sure that he would notice the mere shadow of
  it in time to dodge, though it struck never so swiftly. But what if the
  shadow were at first but an extra depth of blue in the summer sky, and
  recognisable only as a marvellous new decoration to the splendour of his
  world?</p>

  <p>At any rate, the month of June in the following year was memorable in
  Mark's career. He made a speech of some consequence upon English policy in
  the Near East, and walked home afterwards with Catherstone.</p>

  <p>"That should settle the question of office, I think," said the young Whip.
  The under-secretaryship for the Colonies had just become vacant. "I have
  seldom heard a better speech. How is it you know so much about the Near
  East?"</p>

  <p>Mark Thewliss waked from the consideration of what was apparently some
  heavy matter of a different kind.</p>

  <p>"My business," he replied. "The Near East is a great market for me." He
  stopped at his door. "I wish you would come in for a moment. I would like to
  ask you a question or two which you could answer off-hand. But the answers
  would be of great value to me."</p>

  <p>Catherstone was a little alarmed. He had a fear that he might be asked to
  reveal Cabinet secrets, and since he did not know any he would be put to it
  to maintain his importance.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said reluctantly.</p>

  <p>Thewliss led his companion to a small and pleasant book-lined room at the
  back of the house, sat him down in a deep arm-chair with a whisky and soda at
  his elbow and himself took his stand upon the hearthrug.</p>

  <p>"Now," he said, without the least embarrassment. "For the first time in my
  life I am going to spend a week-end at a country house."</p>

  <p>Young Lord Catherstone sat up and stared.</p>

  <p>"For the first time!" he exclaimed. "But you are joking!"</p>

  <p>"Not a bit of it. I have been asked several times, but I have always
  refused the invitation. For one thing, I got Saturday and Sunday, two clear
  days, for my business affairs and my laboratory. For another, I knew nothing
  about the routine and did not wish to make a whole heap of mistakes."</p>

  <p>"Where are you going?" asked Catherstone.</p>

  <p>"To Colonel Westram's."</p>

  <p>"Tony's? Oh, you can't make mistakes there. There isn't any routine."</p>

  <p>"I am glad to hear it," Mark observed. "Nevertheless, I should like some
  information. I want you to take me hour by hour through the normal life of a
  visitor in a country house, beginning with his arrival on Friday afternoon
  and ending with his departure on Monday morning."</p>

  <p>Week-end visits were so customary a feature of Catherstone's existence
  that he was put to it to formulate the passage of the hours and their
  occupations.</p>

  <p>"Let me think," he said. "You play golf, of course?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know an iron from a brassy, or a niblick from a putter."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!"</p>

  <p>Catherstone stared at Mark Thewliss in amazement. The man looked hard
  enough certainly.</p>

  <p>"What in the world do you do with yourself on your holidays?"</p>

  <p>"On a real holiday I sail a top-sail schooner. For other occasions I have
  a racing dinghy on the Broads."</p>

  <p>"Well, neither of them is going to help you in Berkshire, my friend. It's
  a pity you don't play golf. You can get away from the mob, and you're no
  bother to your host." He looked at Mark and pointed a threatening finger. "If
  you don't watch it, you'll find yourself seeing the neighbourhood in a
  wagonette with the ladies."</p>

  <p>"Heaven forbid!"</p>

  <p>Catherstone had a sudden hope.</p>

  <p>"Do you fish?"</p>

  <p>"I've caught some mackerel."</p>

  <p>"There aren't any mackerel in the Test," cried Catherstone in despair.
  "Well, here goes! You arrive at half-past six on Friday evening in your own
  motorcar "&mdash;and he described hour by hour, as he was bidden, the life
  that Thewliss might be expected to lead, and with a sigh of relief dispatched
  him back along the Bath Road at half-past nine on the Monday morning.</p>

  <p>"Your host will sigh with relief, too," Catherstone said grimly. "Luckily,
  it's Tony Westram." He laughed as he lifted himself out of the arm-chair. "As
  a matter of fact, you'll enjoy yourself thoroughly. Everyone does at Gissens.
  Good night."</p>

  <p>Young Catherstone, as befitted his age and the month, went off to change
  his clothes and betake himself to half a dozen parties. Mark Thewliss, now
  that the programme of his movements was clear, dismissed the visit from his
  mind. Country house visits would no doubt be rather a bore, but a few of them
  would be necessary and according to plan. That the plan, during two fateful
  days, was amazingly to expand and embrace as definite purposes mere dreams
  which had been toyed with, he would not have believed. But, as we have seen,
  his education had not taught him that Achilles had a heel. Frankenstein's
  monster astonished his creator; and when the robot comes at last there will
  be some alloy in his metal which will turn him human in the end. Love of
  woman is the usual factor. But it was a very complicated form of it which was
  to interfere with the works of Mark Thewliss.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch09"
     id="ch09"></a>IX. &mdash;ANGELA IS NOT DISAPPOINTED</h2>

  <p class="first">According to plan, then, on the Friday afternoon Mark turned
  his car to the left, off the wide thoroughfare ten miles beyond Newbury. For
  three miles more he twisted amongst lanes deep in the greenery of trees and
  hedgerows and came to a great rectangle of a house set in a park trim with
  white five-barred gates. The flat, oblong windows looked across a wide space
  of lawn to the famous river. Big elms spread their shade over rich pastures;
  in a field hay-makers were turning the swathes, and between the hayfield and
  the house a rose garden tossed its scent and colour in the air. Tony Westram
  came from the field in his shirt sleeves with his hay-fork in his hand.</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose you'll find a soul in the house," he cried. He was aglow
  like his own rose-garden, and he conducted his conversation, as was his wont,
  at the top of his voice.</p>

  <p>"We're hardly more than the family. My little girl Angela, a nephew Derek
  Crayle, a good boy who has just joined my old regiment. He's over there."
  Colonel Westram pointed across the lawn to a youth who was standing back
  behind a bush and casting a line very carefully over a pool of the river.</p>

  <p>"Then there's Julian Wilford&mdash;he has a strip of river beyond
  me&mdash;a man on the Stock Exchange." Tony Westram ran through the brief
  list of his guests with a short description of each of them.</p>

  <p>"Besides them, there's a niece who makes her home with me. Lady Olivia
  Stanton. She's coming across the lawn to us now."</p>

  <p>Mark saw a young woman, in a white dress with a big hat shading her face,
  approaching them.</p>

  <p>"I had better tell you a little about her, so don't look, or she'll
  guess," continued Westram, lowering his voice. "She has had pretty bad luck
  all round. Old Porlock was her father. He threw away every bean he had over
  the gee-gees and died a year after her mother. Then she lost the only man she
  ever cared about in the Boer War, and I am afraid nothing matters very much
  to her now&mdash;or ever will." He raised his voice. "Olivia, I want to
  introduce Mark Thewliss to you."</p>

  <p>Olivia Stanton had no claim to be considered beautiful, but she had a
  pleasant, delicate face, with fine grey eyes, and however heavy her woes had
  been, she carried no sign of them. She greeted Mark Thewliss with a friendly
  smile and a firm clasp of the hand.</p>

  <p>"I am glad that you found time to come," she said. "A little intellect is
  always badly needed at Gissens at this time of the year."</p>

  <p>"You haven't seen Angela, I suppose?" Tony Westram interposed.</p>

  <p>"I have, but she's not fit to be seen. She's with the keeper at the
  hatchery." Olivia Stanton turned to Mark with a whimsical pity. "Everybody
  here is mad about the trout for the moment, and it's my duty to warn you that
  something pretty bad is being planned for you. The outlook's gloomy. So you
  had better let me give you some tea whilst you are a free man."</p>

  <p>For that afternoon, however, he remained a free man He took his tea in a
  long, cool drawing-room and was taken for a walk by Olivia Stanton
  afterwards. He found himself, to his surprise&mdash;for he was still nave in
  many ways&mdash;talking to her about his dyes and his difficulties with the
  German patents, giving her a glimpse of his early struggles, and sketching
  with some humour William Mardyke and his associates.</p>

  <p>"All this," he cried, looking round upon the park and the house in its
  orderly and complete beauty, "all this is absolutely new to me"&mdash;he drew
  in a breath&mdash;"and wonderful. I didn't know what I had missed."</p>

  <p>It was the season of the mayfly, the dusk long lingering into darkness,
  the river softly glimmering, the air sweet with the smell of hay and flowers.
  Dinner was a go-as-you-please affair.</p>

  <p>Angela Westram came late to it, a lovely tall slip of a girl with brown
  hair and blue eyes and all the joy of her seventeen years brimming over. She
  was clothed in a frock of pale blue crepe de Chine with light-coloured
  stockings and blue shoes, and a necklace of old amber and silver encircled
  her young throat. Mark Thewliss was presented to her, and she looked at him
  very gravely and sedately, and nodded her head as though some serious doubt
  she had was set at rest.</p>

  <p>"I am pleased to meet you," she said with a rather pretty touch of
  conferring a great favour upon him.</p>

  <p>Derek Crayle appeared later and had not even changed into a dinner jacket.
  He made his apology. There would still be the last of the light after dinner
  was finished, and there was a pool of which he had great hopes. The talk was
  all of the river, of Dusty Millers and Brown Devons, of fat old pike which
  wanted a rifle taken to them, and of big trout which lay in full view under
  the banks, motionless as yoghis on an Indian hill-side and like them,
  liberated from temptation.</p>

  <p>"This must be all jargon to Thewliss," Tony Westram at last
  expostulated.</p>

  <p>"All education is jargon to the beginner," said Derek sententiously.</p>

  <p>"Alas! I am not even a beginner," Thewliss returned.</p>

  <p>"You will be to-morrow," Angela declared firmly.</p>

  <p>"I am going to spend the morning teaching Mr. Thewliss to cast a line on
  the lawn."</p>

  <p>She smiled with a charming tyranny across the table at the guest.</p>

  <p>"I warned you, Mr. Thewliss," said Olivia. "You had still time to turn
  your car round and flee to the Bath Road."</p>

  <p>"Never!" Thewliss returned, and he bowed with humility to Angela. "You
  will have an extremely willing duff er for your pupil."</p>

  <p>Angela frowned.</p>

  <p>"But you must take it very seriously, Mr. Thewliss," she said, rebuking
  him for his levity. "It is intensely important that you should catch a trout
  in this river with a dry fly by to-morrow night."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Tony in surprise.</p>

  <p>"That, my father, is for the moment your daughter's secret. When it is
  disclosed, you will all marvel at my wisdom. But the trout must be caught
  first, Mr. Thewliss."</p>

  <p>"Miss Angela, I answer you with an Eastern saying,"</p>

  <p>Mark replied. "If it can be done, it is done. If it can't be done, it
  shall be done." And upon that the little company rose from the table.</p>

  <p>Mark Thewliss kept himself awake as long as he could that night after he
  had gone to bed. He was in a world which was quite strange to him and very
  lovely; and he was hedonist enough to wish to prolong the first sweet savour
  of it. He knew the magic of a summer night at sea in the loneliness of great
  waters. But that of the country-side had a beauty of its own. The quiet
  rustle of birds in the leaves of the tree, as though they feared to invite an
  enemy, the hoot of owls, the sudden gush of clear melody from a nightingale,
  the regular tiny swish of cattle cropping the grass, and every now and then
  the gurgle of the river running by at the edge of the lawn&mdash;all these
  sounds floated in at his open window and enchanted him. The scent of hay and
  flowers made the room sweet. He had a sensation that the whole wide earth was
  consciously refreshing itself in the cool of the night against the coming
  day; and he felt very near to it, and had a sympathy with it, as though the
  earth were his brother. He lay folded in peace and clean, the dust of a long
  tramp brushed from his tired body.</p>

  <p>And it was not lonely like the sea. He realised for the first time the
  four walls of loneliness within which he, Mark Thewliss, had lived for so
  long and with so ignorant a contentment. He had missed the grace of life.
  This one evening at Gissens had already taught him that. There had been no
  straining after wit, not an attempt at an epigram, not a saying to be
  remembered. But there had been friendliness, a natural give-and-take of
  conversation, and, above all, an ease, an admirable, inimitable, unhampered
  ease. In the society which he had frequented people watched their manners;
  they were a little over-careful of their propriety, they looked upon
  stiffness as&mdash;horrible phrase, but so completely appropriate&mdash;as
  <i>comme il faut</i>.</p>

  <p>"I must certainly have a country house of my own&mdash;" he came to that
  conclusion rather drowsily as the clock upon the stables struck the hour of
  midnight. "Yes, and young people to make it, with their gaiety and high
  spirits, a house alive;" and upon this unprobed resolve he fell asleep.</p>

  <p>But it was awake with him next morning; and Mark was well aware that when
  the intentions of the night were also the intentions of the morning he must
  take them into serious account. He had no time, however, for reflection that
  forenoon. He spent it under Angela's supervision. She was indeed waiting for
  him upon the lawn, with a trout-rod in her hand.</p>

  <p>"We must get to work," she said with a touch of severity in her voice. "We
  are not so early as we might have been."</p>

  <p>"I believe the proper phrase is that I overslept myself," Thewliss
  answered meekly.</p>

  <p>She taught him first of all to get his line out by example and
  instruction, very gently but very firmly; so that he felt like a clumsy
  little boy on his first day at school. Then she marked out a circle in white
  and the more arduous course began. How to drop his fly upon that circle so
  that it should seem of its own accord to flutter down; how to make the cast
  so that the line should uncoil in the most delicate of spirals, and not so
  much fall as lay itself imperceptibly upon the grass, and only that after the
  fly at the end of it had settled&mdash;these were problems which provoked
  much disappointment in Angela, much sympathy in Olivia Stanton and much
  humility in Mark Thewliss.</p>

  <p>"I shall never do it," he cried.</p>

  <p>The intricacies of the fly-fisherman's craft were not to be mastered in
  one assiduous morning.</p>

  <p>"You are getting on very well," said Olivia.</p>

  <p>"And you'll certainly catch a fish before the day's out," declared
  Angela.</p>

  <p>They were talking thus at luncheon when a letter was brought in to Mark
  Thewliss. It was addressed to his house in London.</p>

  <p>"Your servants thought it might be important, sir," said Tony Westram's
  butler, "and sent it on by special messenger."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Mark, turning the letter over and then laying it beside
  his plate on the table.</p>

  <p>"You had better open it," said Tony. "I'd lay a thousand pounds to a penny
  I could tell you the contents."</p>

  <p>Mark opened the envelope and read the letter, and a smile crept over his
  face.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you're not going away this afternoon!" cried Angela in the greatest
  anxiety. "You really can't."</p>

  <p>"If he does, you needn't cry about it, Angela." Derek Crayle remarked
  dryly. "For I think he has caught his fish already."</p>

  <p>Thewliss looked up and laughed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but there are some kinds of fishes one puts back. This is one of
  them."</p>

  <p>There was a moment of silence, and then Tony Westram broke in
  incredulously:</p>

  <p>"Too small?"</p>

  <p>"For a younger man, no. For me, yes."</p>

  <p>"By gad!"</p>

  <p>Tony Westram hardly knew whether he was standing on his head or his
  heels.</p>

  <p>"It's the Under-Secretaryship, of course."</p>

  <p>"For the Colonies. Yes."</p>

  <p>"And you are refusing it. Office in your first Parliament! Aren't you
  taking a big risk?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Mark answered.</p>

  <p>One thing was clear to all of that company, however surprised they might
  be. Thewliss was not speaking on the spur of the moment out of a wild vanity.
  His voice was too quiet, his manner too dispassionate and tranquil. He had
  reviewed the question of refusal or acceptance of just this offer very
  carefully from all its angles.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am taking a big risk. Of course I am nowhere at all yet," he
  explained with a sudden smile, "but I shouldn't be even there if I hadn't
  breakfasted and lunched and dined on big risks for the greater part of my
  life."</p>

  <p>He suddenly saw Olivia Stanton watching him steadily with her quiet eyes.
  She was the only one of the party who had uttered no word of surprise or
  doubt. She had sat quite silent, and Mark read in her face both comprehension
  and approval. She smiled at him when their eyes met, to assure him of her
  agreement; and unexpectedly another thought, born of his night-time fancies
  and quite foreign to the discussion of the propriety of his action, sprang
  into his mind He glanced quickly from her to Angela, who was sitting at her
  side, taking them both into a single picture and making of the picture a
  pattern or image of which he yearned for a copy. Here, too, it seemed that
  Olivia Stanton understood him. For the blood rushed into her face, and she
  lowered her eyes. It was the matter of a moment, but an unforgettable moment
  for both of them; and Angela, who was so impressed by the enormity of Mark's
  conduct that she had forgotten the paramount need that he should land a
  trout, covered altogether Olivia's confusion.</p>

  <p>"Do you know that my father has been twenty years in the House of Commons,
  and no one has ever offered him anything?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"It's a scandal," cried Thewliss.</p>

  <p>"And that he would jump out of his skin for an Under-Secretaryship?"
  Angela continued.</p>

  <p>"Oh, shame, shame! Go into the corner, Angela," Derek Crayle ordered,
  amidst a splutter of laughter.</p>

  <p>"But she's right," exclaimed Tony, joining in the laugh. "I would. I have
  got the House of Commons in my bones, worse luck!"</p>

  <p>"And you're refusing one." Angela went on staring at Mark with round,
  incredulous eyes. "If I knew you better, and my manners weren't so terribly
  refined, I should ask you a very pointed question."</p>

  <p>"Ask it!" said Thewliss nobly. "I am strong."</p>

  <p>"Very well, then," said Angela. "It is a mere suggestion. I may be
  entirely wrong. But&mdash;aren't you&mdash;a little dippy?"</p>

  <p>Cries of protest broke from Tony, from Derek Crayle, from the fellow on
  the Stock Exchange, even from Olivia.</p>

  <p>"Let us have no noise!" Mark replied, holding up his hand for silence. "I
  must consider that question very carefully. No...no...Miss Angela, I may be
  rash&mdash;but dippy? No! I beg you to follow my argument closely. I am
  nominally the junior partner, but actually the bright guiding spirit, of one
  of the most eminent firms devoted to the production of synthetic dyes. I have
  all the chemistry and organisation of Germany to fight. It must have escaped
  your memory that in this very year of grace the Bayer Farbenfabrik has
  discovered that benzoylated oxyanthraquinones have all the properties of vat
  dyes? Arising out of that answer I ask you what will become of Mardyke and
  Campion, to say nothing of England, if I take my hand from the steering wheel
  and melt into a departmental underling? <i>Phut</i> is the only reply. Excuse
  me if I say to you <i>tush</i>! Also, I can't afford it."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Angela with a start. "That alters the whole position," and once
  more she wrapt herself in mysteries.</p>

  <p>Later on that afternoon, when Thewliss had written and dispatched his
  letter of refusal and the shadows were lengthening on the garden, he was
  fetched out to the real business of the day. He was given a split-cane rod, a
  Dusty Miller was carefully attached to the gut at the end of the line; he was
  brought as cautiously as any conspirator to the river bank and shown an old
  fat big trout lying so motionless in a pool of the clear brown water that
  Thewliss could hardly believe it to be anything but a shadow, too. Then he
  was led back well out of sight, and encouraged by whispered advices and
  excitements, he at last made the great anticipated cast. Alas, a thin line
  cut the still river like a seam with a little splash just over the fat
  trout's nose, and the fly, self-confessed a fly with a hook, dropped last of
  all upon the water, heavy as an obese man from a diving-board.</p>

  <p>"Draw it in across his nose," whispered Angela. "He might...One never
  knows."</p>

  <p>She was wringing her hands now. Mark wound in his line never so
  cautiously.</p>

  <p>"Bite, you fat dawdler, bite," she whispered, but the old trout was
  thinking very selfishly that this was no genuine supper which was offered to
  him and was indifferent to Angela's exhortations.</p>

  <p>"Try him once more," she said. "Oh, that's ever so much better. Now he
  must...No, he won't," and she gave voice to the last unforgivable treachery.
  "I should like to try the old beast with a nice smelly shrimp."</p>

  <p>Thewliss was moved along to another pool, and once more he failed
  lamentably. For everybody at Gissens, except Olivia Stanton, who looked on
  with a detached smile of amusement, life now became serious and intense.
  Thewliss had got to catch a fish. Tony Westram gave his advice; Derek Crayle
  put the novice through one or two extra rehearsals on the lawn; Mr. Wilford,
  who had noticed from afar a fatal jerk of the wrist, came running up with the
  useful suggestion that Thewliss mustn't think he was bowling off-breaks at
  the nets. Thewliss received exhortations enough to make his reason totter on
  its throne, and each cast was watched with an anxious holding of the breath
  and followed by a gasp of despair.</p>

  <p>No one really cared a threepenny bit whether Mark Thewliss caught a fish
  or whether he didn't, so far as his enjoyment or success was concerned. But
  Angela's heart for some mysterious reason was set upon this achievement, and
  it was not endurable that she should be disappointed. Mark Thewliss realised
  the dreadful position in which he stood as clearly as any of the party. If he
  did not catch a trout&mdash;and he was in the heretical mood to wish that the
  pike had eaten all the trout in the world&mdash;Angela would be disappointed,
  her day would be spoilt, and humiliation and well-merited disdain would be
  his lot.</p>

  <p>At half-past seven in the evening, when Mark's right arm was aching as no
  arms ache except the rheumatical, and a small gloomy procession followed him
  along the bank, the miracle happened.</p>

  <p>"I'm against trout," Thewliss cried in a rage, "I challenge them all here
  and now," and at random, with a violence and savagery which made the devotees
  shudder, he whirled the line above his head and cast. And lo I It shot out
  far and farther and still farther, so that Angela gasped and Tony cried, "By
  Gad!" And the fly settled upon the water, daintily as a fly should do, and an
  ingenuous and confiding youngster on the very edge of Westram's water
  snapped, and snapped once too often. The end of the rod bent and shook.</p>

  <p>"You've got him! Oh!" cried Angela, stamping with relief.</p>

  <p>"Hook him well," cried Tony. "Just a little jerk of the wrist. That'll
  do;" and in the air there was a flash of silver, and in the same breath, a
  gurgle of water and a tiny whirlpool as the trout leaped and plunged.</p>

  <p>"Let him run now," said Derek. "And for heaven's sake, don't lose him. We
  can't have Angela crying over the roast beef and choking herself with a
  mixture of sobs and Yorkshire pudding."</p>

  <p>No one paid any attention to his ribaldry. The fish ran upstream like an
  express train, sulked and ran down again.</p>

  <p>"Look out!" cried Tony anxiously. "He's close to a big stone. If he gets
  your line round it, you're done."</p>

  <p>"Oh, he can't be as malevolent as that." Mark was almost whimpering now
  that he really had a fish on his line.</p>

  <p>"Oh, can't he?" said Angela. "Bring in your line a little, please I
  Good!"</p>

  <p>For the fish had dashed upstream again. Then followed a minute or two of
  concentrated anxiety, of violent jerks and plunges and most deceitful
  inactivities.</p>

  <p>"I've just <i>got</i> to land him." Thewliss said, in a voice of which the
  very accent declared that life would never be the same again if he
  failed.</p>

  <p>"But you shall, you shall," Angela promised soothingly. "He's tiring.
  Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;he's coming now...No! Pay out! Pay out!" and her voice
  rose in despair.</p>

  <p>But that was the final rush. Thewliss wound in his line slowly and
  steadily. Angela knelt upon the bank with her net in her hand.</p>

  <p>"Oh, he's a whopper," she cried enthusiastically; but a much greater
  whopper was Angela's remark. He may have weighed half a pound. On the other
  hand, he may not. But no one was courageous enough to enter upon such
  dangerous ground as the detail of his weight. He was a whopper. All were
  agreed upon that. Even Thewliss, who had suffered rather a shock when he saw
  its insignificance laid out upon the grass, came to the conclusion that as a
  trout he was a very fine fellow.</p>

  <p>"Bravo!" cried Angela with shining eyes. "Now, Mr. Thewliss, what do you
  say?"</p>

  <p>And Thewliss, bethinking himself that Saturday night had come,
  answered:</p>

  <p>"I say that there's a good deal to be said for a Continental Sunday."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10"></a>X. &mdash;THE COUNTRY HOUSE</h2>

  <p class="first">"And now, Angela," said Derek Crayle that night when dinner
  was at an end and the coffee cups on the table, "I must beg you to resolve
  our anxieties. We are poor, weak men, unfitted for the stern business of
  unravelling riddles. You, too, are unfitted to be a Sphinx. For all Sphinxes
  have enormous feet. It is the only thing known about them. You could not be
  one if you would. Explain then why, oh why the heavens would fall and the
  earth crash in ruin, if Mark Thewliss had not caught a trout to-day!"</p>

  <p>Angela emitted a little gurgle of laughter. She looked at Thewliss and
  looked away. She was almost embarrassed.</p>

  <p>"I hope that I did not take too much upon myself," she said with a
  sedateness which another gurgle belied. "I should hate to be thought a
  forward girl."</p>

  <p>"Angela," said Derek severely, "you have an idea in your head of which you
  are ashamed."</p>

  <p>"I have not," she returned, stung to indignation. "I simply thought that
  if Mr. Thewliss caught one fish, he would want to catch more."</p>

  <p>Derek Crayle agreed.</p>

  <p>"And from a very regrettable allusion which he made to our wise
  Sabbatarian restrictions, I gather that you were right."</p>

  <p>"Quite right," said Mark.</p>

  <p>"Proceed, Angela," said Derek Crayle, and Angela broke out in a bubble of
  wrath.</p>

  <p>"Oh, go and put your head in a bag. I hate pedants. I shall talk to my
  father," and she turned her back on Derek Crayle. "I thought that if Mr.
  Thewliss once found out that fishing was good fun, he might buy Upper
  Theign."</p>

  <p>There was a moment of silence. Then:</p>

  <p>"By Gad!" said Tony Westram. "Well, why not?"</p>

  <p>"The idea, certainly," Crayle observed, "is more profound than one would
  associate with the immaturity of Angela's shoulders."</p>

  <p>Angela flung round towards her tormentor, battle in her eyes, storm upon
  her brow. But Mark intervened.</p>

  <p>"Might I inquire what Upper Theign is?" he asked meekly.</p>

  <p>"It's a house," Tony explained, "with five hundred acres of land. It
  marches with Gissens and&mdash;this is what Angela's after&mdash;it has half
  a mile of river next to my water.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" Angela interposed, leaning eagerly across the table. "Don't you
  see, Mr. Thewliss, we could fish your water and you could fish ours. The
  house is for sale and the estate just as it stands, furniture, livestock,
  farm, tools, everything. If you don't buy it, it'll go up for auction, and
  heaven knows whom we shall get as a neighbour."</p>

  <p>"You might get a better one than me," said Mark, and Derek Crayle tittered
  sardonically.</p>

  <p>"He didn't want any teaching to fish," he declared, and Angela, with a
  gesture of her arm, swept him out of existence.</p>

  <p>"Please pay no attention whatever to that rude little boy, Mr. Thewliss,"
  she said. "I have been considering you very carefully from every angle. We
  shall be delighted to have you as a neighbour. I am seldom wrong in my
  judgments, and I hope you will let me show you the house to-morrow
  afternoon."</p>

  <p>So, after all, Mark Thewliss did see the neighbourhood in a wagonette with
  the ladies. They came to Upper Theign at four in the afternoon, Tony Westram,
  Derek Crayle, Olivia Stanton, Angela and Mark Thewliss. It was the twin of
  Gissens, a spacious house of oblong rooms and big windows, wide lawns and old
  trees, rose gardens and fruit gardens, tennis courts and paddocks and the
  river running clear and brown between low, green banks. Mark walked from room
  to room, was shown the great kitchen and the modern bath-rooms. He was
  conscious of an odd exaltation.</p>

  <p>"All this can be mine," he said to himself. "Here it is, a house one might
  invent in a dream. I have only to put my name to a piece of paper and it's
  mine."</p>

  <p>"You do like it, don't you?" Angela asked earnestly.</p>

  <p>Thewliss was standing at one of the windows of the great drawing-room,
  looking back over his years to his small beginning. He had foreseen a big
  house in the country but he had only vaguely visualised it, and he recognised
  now with shame that so far as it had taken shape and colour in his thoughts
  it had all the appearance of an enormous red-brick villa with bay windows, a
  tower and a huddle of tiled roof.</p>

  <p>"What's wonderful to me," he said in a voice which betrayed to his friends
  that he was surprisingly moved, "is that it's all made all complete and
  settled and rich with the care and thought of half a dozen generations, and
  now for good and all made. I don't suppose that means so much to you. But I
  have spent my life with things making."</p>

  <p>Tony Westram glanced at his guest and said with an unusual shrewdness:</p>

  <p>"And yet that has been just your advantage too. You came into notice all
  made. Nobody had seen you grow. The first we heard of you&mdash;there you
  were established, with a fortune at your back, in the House of Commons,
  making a speech and a damned good speech too. People had to sit up and ask
  questions. They became curious. They asked: 'Why have I never heard of that
  fellow before?' To jump at once from the dark, already complete and made! It
  gives you romance, what?" and he laughed with friendliness, and clapped
  Thewliss on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>But it was not only the little touch of mystery which had given to Mark
  this most inappropriate aura of romance. The thirteen years of untiring
  endeavour, perhaps, too, the delicacy of the experiments he was engaged upon,
  had given to his aspect something more than authority. They seemed in some
  subtle way to have refined his features to the point of remodelling them.
  There had been a look of commonness before; now there was a look of the
  thoroughbred. The hard thirteen years had done the work of the fairy
  godmother. They had waved a wand and the herd stood forth freed from his
  clay, vibrant, sensitive, the artist as he is fondly imagined by such as have
  never seen one.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't astonishing that no one of you had ever heard of me," he
  replied to Tony. "I lived amongst a set of City people who believe that
  public affairs are for some vague governing class and should be left to that
  class. There are many more of them left over from the mid-Victorian days than
  you would imagine, families living stiffly and ceremoniously in big houses in
  select suburbs, entertaining each other from time to time with great
  preparations and formalities, occasionally visiting a theatre, occasionally
  taking stalls for the Opera, people in buckram...I think I'll have to buy
  Upper Theign."</p>

  <p>Angela clapped her hands.</p>

  <p>"That's to-day's good deed."</p>

  <p>"I said 'I think.'"</p>

  <p>"I am sure, Mr. Thewliss, you are one of those rare men with whom to think
  is to do," said Angela solemnly. "Let us now go and look at your river!"</p>

  <p>She led her father and Derek Crayle out of the room, but Mark's attention
  had been seized by the curtain at the window.</p>

  <p>"That's pretty badly gone," he said.</p>

  <p>It was a brown curtain of brocaded silk, but the brown had faded and
  unevenly.</p>

  <p>"These windows get all the afternoon sun," Olivia explained. "It's bound
  to wither and bleach the curtains. You can't help it."</p>

  <p>Thewliss frowned and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"We have got to help it," he answered stubbornly. "That's one of the
  problems. But it's a teaser. Some dyes are faster on wool than on cotton, and
  on both than on silk, so you'll want three processes. A good many of the azo
  dyes can be made sunproof with a chrome treatment, but then the shade is
  changed. The same is true of my own synthetic indigo. It's quite fast if you
  steam the stuffs after you have dyed them, but then the bloom becomes just a
  trifle too violet."</p>

  <p>Mark seemed to have lost sight of Olivia Stanton except as an audience. He
  ran his long fingers up and down the curtain, caressing the fabric with a
  curiously delicate touch.</p>

  <p>"It was a handsome curtain too. A bath of copper sulphate might have
  preserved the colour more or less. But it's always more or less, and the
  method's always different. That's what exasperates me." He dropped the
  curtain and turned swiftly to Olivia with an eager look upon his face,
  demanding her sympathy.</p>

  <p>"I have been working out the answer for years. One method for all the
  dyes, acid, basic, mordant, salt dyes, vat dyes and the rest of them, and for
  all the dyed materials from cotton to leather and wood. Just one process and
  fool-proof&mdash;perfectly sure and certain! One universal formula! It would
  be splendid, wouldn't it?"</p>

  <p>The blood mounted into Olivia's face as she looked at him, so earnestly
  his tense attitude, every fibre of him, asked for the help of her belief that
  he would succeed. Nevertheless, she was greatly puzzled. It seemed to her not
  very important in the history of the world that window-curtains should no
  longer fade in the sunlight. There was wealth, no doubt, and very likely
  enormous wealth to be plucked from the discovery of the process which would
  make them fadeless. But she could not count the ambition to make that
  discovery a great ambition, as Mark did, as undoubtedly Mark did. She could
  not understand the enthusiasm which shone from him and suddenly made a boy of
  him.</p>

  <p>Yet he was so clamorous for her approval&mdash;"After all, I mean
  nothing," she said to herself&mdash;that she felt grateful, and was in the
  mood to make, if she could, a discovery herself. A discovery that somehow, in
  some way it was a great ambition, worth, for instance, the sacrifice of an
  Under-Secretaryship of State and the possible collapse of a promising
  political career.</p>

  <p>"No doubt it would be a wonderful thing," she said, trying to mean her
  words. "I am sure, too, that you will make the discovery."</p>

  <p>"I must! I have got to," cried Mark, in much the same tense, abrupt tone
  which he had used when he was playing his half-a-pound weight trout; and for
  the life of her she could not but think that both achievements were on a par,
  and the cry of real longing as little justified in the one case as in the
  other.</p>

  <p>But Mark, though he was quite unconscious of the doubts of him which
  disquieted her, did now go far to dispel them.</p>

  <p>"You see, colours mean such a tremendous lot to the world, don't they?" he
  explained eagerly. "People never reckon up the terrific contribution they
  make to good order. They look upon them merely as decorations. But they mean
  hope and good-humour and gaiety. They bring the Spring with them. Put them
  within the reach of poor people&mdash;less drink, less crime, less brooding,
  less gloom. And not only in this country. All over the world. You see, once I
  got my universal formula, colour would be ever so much cheaper everywhere
  "&mdash;and since he could never keep far away from this one aspect of his
  case&mdash;"from the bazaars of Fez and Damascus and Delhi right across the
  East to the outer edge of Asia. And here's another thing, Lady Olivia, or
  rather, it's all that I have said gathered up into one sentence. Bright
  colours don't go with sharp swords. Colour's a peacemaker. When soldiers go
  to war, they change their scarlet for khaki! That's an allegory," he broke
  off suddenly. "But I oughtn't to have bored you with my theories. You must
  forgive me."</p>

  <p>"On the other hand, I thank you," said Olivia Stanton with a smile. She
  did not tell him that she was glad that her misgivings had been dispersed;
  nor that she was a little moved by his frank exhibition of how deeply he was
  moved himself by his as yet unfulfilled ambition. She preferred to end the
  conversation with a platitude. "A woman is always flattered when a man
  confides to her his secrets."</p>

  <p>Mark Thewliss drove away the next morning at half-past nine. Tony Westram
  waved a hand to him from the door and Angela, standing outside with the sun
  shining upon her hair, cried:</p>

  <p>"Don't forget Upper Theign!"</p>

  <p>And Mark did not forget it as he travelled through the lovely country in
  the freshness of the summer day. He thought of it as a seat of just the right
  degree of importance; as a place of peace and rest; as a delight to the eye,
  with its wide green lawns and coloured gardens; but, above all, as a house
  peopled.</p>

  <p>Peopled by young and joyous persons&mdash;a daughter, say, like Angela,
  and her friends...A wife, too, of course. But, above all, by a daughter, all
  a-bubble with the beauty of her youth, a pattern of grace, tall, slender.</p>

  <p>"I am forty-five," he reflected, and the reflection shocked him. He had
  always meant to have a home. Yes, right back in far off, almost fabulous,
  days the aspect of a little cabin with its white napery laid daintily for a
  meal under the soft light of the candles, had set that longing astir in him.
  But under the stress of the fourteen years between now and then, he had
  forgotten it. The years had brought their triumphs to be sure, but they
  seemed somehow smaller than he had thought them...there had been too little
  grace in his life. Well, he had still the time to repair that omission.</p>

  <p>What should he call that daughter of his to be?
  Phyllis?...Sylvia?...Angela?...No, that wouldn't do, since Angela was to be
  his neighbour. Besides, his wife, yes of course there would be his wife...She
  would want a word in that momentous decision. Sylvia, perhaps...</p>

  <p>The car was entering Reading. Mark stopped it at a newsagent's shop and
  bought a copy of the day's <i>Times</i>. A study of the business columns of
  that journal would be a more decorous occupation for a Member of Parliament
  and the active partner of Mardyke and Campion than blowing bubbles out of
  day-dreams, even on a morning of young June. Yet he never read a word of the
  columns.</p>

  <p>"Forty-five...Forty-five...Forty-five...If he married to-morrow he would
  still be sixty-three before the daughter-to-be reached Angela's
  age...Forty-five...Forty-five...And he couldn't marry to-morrow. There were
  preliminaries to marriage, such as selection and a certain amount of
  courtship...Forty-five...Forty-five.</p>

  <p>"There was a funny story about belated attempts to marry...What were the
  words. 'Every year you become more particular and less desirable.' Yet not
  such a very funny story after all. There was a sharper tang to it than Mark
  Thewliss cared for...And then fear smote him. Suppose that no woman wanted
  him now!...</p>

  <p>"But that's ridiculous," he declared. "Besides&mdash;-"</p>

  <p>Yes, there had been a moment on Saturday, at the luncheon table&mdash;an
  encouraging moment. He had been looking at Olivia Stanton. She had understood
  his refusal of office, was with him in that refusal, had nodded to him her
  sympathy. And he had suddenly glanced at Angela who was at her side, had
  embraced them both, the girl and the young woman in the one look. "Just such
  a wife! Just such a daughter," he had said to himself, and he had seen the
  colour rise into Olivia's face and her eyes fall from his.</p>

  <p>"She understood," he reflected, "and she wasn't angry. In the afternoon of
  the next day, at Upper Theign, she was interested, sympathetic. Perhaps...in
  a little time...why not?" he asked himself.</p>

  <p>True, there was the lover killed in the Boer War. But he was forty-five.
  Though the hot raptures of youth were for neither of them, there was much
  each could give to the other.</p>

  <p>"She is poor. She would be mistress of her own home, freed from all the
  embarrassments which attend upon a meagre income, safe. And I? I want my
  daughter."</p>

  <p>The second of the two rules which guided his life wrote itself out in
  front of him. "Want what you want." And he had never, so far as he could
  remember, wanted anything so desperately as the fulfilment of the need which
  his visit had awakened in him. A house noisy with young laughter, a house
  with a daughter&mdash;and a wife too&mdash;yes, of course, a wife too!</p>

  <p>After all, such things were the corollary of his ambition. Power, the
  sensation of power, could never be quite complete to the solitary man. He
  must see the evidences of it about him. Assuring himself thus that this
  unaccustomed yearning was all according to plan, he yielded to the luxury of
  it. He dreamed of some starry-eyed, splendid girl with delightful peremptory
  ways, a sort of protective regard for her unfortunate elders, and a joyous
  tenderness, whose name might be Phyllis or Sylvia or whatever you liked, so
  long as she was there, making a house into a home such as he had never had.
  And once again the little cabin of the <i>Sea Flower</i>, with its candles
  shining through their globes and its table spread with a fine white cloth set
  in the loneliness of the sea, passed before his eyes.</p>

  <p>The motor-car came to a halt in the traffic. Looking out of the window
  Mark realised that he was already in High Holborn. Upon an impulse he took
  the speaking-tube from its rest and spoke to his chauffeur.</p>

  <p>"I want to go to my solicitors."</p>

  <p>He added the address and the car in a little while turned into Ely
  Place.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash;MARK VISITS HIS LAWYER</h2>

  <p class="first">Two steps led from the pavement into a narrow panelled hall.
  Doors upon either side only shut to open. A staircase in front was a Jacob's
  ladder encumbered with the angels of the law. It was the rush-hour in the
  great legal factory of Messrs. Hawker, Hawker &amp; Lyndhurst.</p>

  <p>A clerk recognised Mark Thewliss.</p>

  <p>"Is Sir William expecting you, sir?"</p>

  <p>Mark shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I have hardly given myself five minutes' warning of my visit."</p>

  <p>Mark, however, was a client of value, and within a quarter of an hour
  found himself in the comfortable room occupied by the head of the firm.</p>

  <p>Sir William, a spare, middle-aged man with a pair of very sharp eyes
  twinkling behind spectacles, pulled forward an arm-chair.</p>

  <p>"What can I do for you?"</p>

  <p>"Two things. First I want to buy Upper Theign. It's a house and an estate
  in Berkshire, for sale just as it stands. Will you please negotiate for
  it?"</p>

  <p>Sir William took down upon a block such particulars as Mark could give
  him.</p>

  <p>"I'll put it in hand at once," he said. "Now for the second
  affair&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>Mark, however, found it a little difficult to approach that second affair.
  He twisted in his chair.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, and again "Yes."</p>

  <p>Sir William offered him a cigarette, which he lit absently and allowed to
  go out. Such agitations were the daily food of Hawker, Hawker &amp;
  Lyndhurst. Sir William waited patiently.</p>

  <p>"You are no doubt accustomed to make discreet inquiries," Thewliss asked
  at last.</p>

  <p>"Discretion is our long suit, Mr. Thewliss."</p>

  <p>"The information I want might be difficult to obtain. The affair is
  altogether delicate. My last data are fourteen years old."</p>

  <p>Sir William smiled cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"I thought for a moment that you were going to give me something really
  difficult to do. Tell me all about it."</p>

  <p>Sir William had the soothing manner of a fashionable physician. Nothing
  could seriously go wrong with you once you had handed yourself over to
  Hawker, Hawker &amp; Lyndhurst. Mark Thewliss was encouraged.</p>

  <p>"It's about a woman," he blurted out.</p>

  <p>"It usually is," said Sir William.</p>

  <p>"I haven't seen her for fourteen years."</p>

  <p>"That, too, I gathered."</p>

  <p>Sir William's estimate of his fellow-men was not very high. Women who
  looked like angels behaved like sluts, and hard-headed men were no better
  than fools. He looked at Mark and correctly appraised his age. When he was
  thirty-one Mark had run up his little bill at Cupid &amp; Co., and no doubt
  it was now being presented with a considerable addition for compound
  interest.</p>

  <p>"And the lady's charms being now upon the wane, she is relying for support
  upon blackmail," he said easily; and he had hardly come to the end of his
  cynicism before he realised that he had made as ugly a blunder as a shrewd
  lawyer could make.</p>

  <p>For Mark was really shocked.</p>

  <p>"Oh no!" he cried, "I am not asking you to dig up a woman's history and
  find something which will keep her mouth closed. In this case there is
  nothing you could find."</p>

  <p>The girl with the big dark eyes and the copper-coloured hair who, during
  one month of suspense and anxiety, had given him all she had to give and had
  asked for nothing in return, was vividly invoked by the lawyer's sneer.</p>

  <p>"I have never even heard from her during these years. But I want to make
  sure that the world has gone well with her, and if it hasn't, to know that it
  hasn't, so that I may do what I can to put things right."</p>

  <p>Sir William glanced at his client curiously, and Mark flushed under the
  glance.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't think that I am a sentimentalist, because I'm not," he
  exclaimed hotly.</p>

  <p>"I should require a deal more evidence before I brought you into the dock
  on that charge," Hawker answered dryly. "After all, let us not forget that I
  have already transacted business for you."</p>

  <p>Mark Thewliss was mollified. It was true, to be sure, that he had acted
  upon an impulse when he ordered his chauffeur to drive to Ely Place instead
  of to Brooke's Market. But sentimentality had nothing to do with it.
  Sentimental impulses have a way of dying the moment after they are acted
  upon. But Mark was conscious that were he driving along Oxford Street again,
  he would nevertheless be sitting again in this office in a few minutes' time.
  For he was quite clear in his mind as to whence the impulse had sprung and
  why it had mastered him.</p>

  <p>The life at Gissens was the cause&mdash;its friendliness and good-humour
  and freedom from anything common or mean. A man pushing ruthlessly through
  the world had stopped in front of a mirror, and had seen himself for the
  first time and was surprised to discover that there were points in his
  appearance which he disliked.</p>

  <p>"I did a mean and graceless thing," he confessed to himself, "when I left
  Mona Lightfoot at Southampton and never bothered my head so much as to send
  her a post card afterwards. What would those people say&mdash;Angela, Olivia
  Stanton, Tony Westram, yes, and Derek Crayle too&mdash;if they knew?
  Hairy-heeled, eh?"</p>

  <p>Mark winced in the lawyer's room as he saw the horrible words framed
  contemptuously by those four pairs of lips. Upper Theign would never have
  been mentioned to him. Much less would he have been pressed to buy it. He had
  a conviction that he could never meet any of that family again on equal terms
  until he had repaid so far as he could repay. He had even a feeling that he
  would have no ease in any marriage unless he knew that Mona Lightfoot was in
  no straits or distress.</p>

  <p>"I have imagined myself as a man of magnificence," he reflected, taking
  himself to task. "But magnificent men make sure that those who have helped
  them shall not know misery."</p>

  <p>He saw Mona Lightfoot kicking her long legs over the cockpit and plying
  him for recitations according to Henry Irving. He showed her the great stone
  ball on Durlstone Head; he swung seawards from the little lighthouse with the
  chocolate band whilst she watched the bubbles on the oily slabs of Portland
  Race; he picnicked with her again on the top of King Charles' bomb-proof fort
  at the edge of an outer island of the Scillies. But whatever picture rose
  before his mind, was painted in the colours of reproach.</p>

  <p>He gave Sir William the particulars.</p>

  <p>Mona Lightfoot&mdash;clerk and stenographer at Mardyke and Campion's just
  fifteen years ago&mdash;the staff reduced in the late autumn because Mardyke
  had no courage&mdash;Mona Lightfoot's efficiency secured her other employment
  at once.</p>

  <p>"In London?" asked Sir William.</p>

  <p>"No. In Liverpool."</p>

  <p>"Her age at that date?"</p>

  <p>"Twenty-three."</p>

  <p>"Who employed her at Liverpool?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know."</p>

  <p>Sir William lifted his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Mona Lightfoot may be dead or married, and Liverpool isn't a village. She
  may have left Liverpool. She may be in the United States or anywhere. The
  problem isn't after all so easy of solution as I thought," said Sir William
  "For such inquiries we generally go to the specialists."</p>

  <p>"Meaning&mdash;?" Mark Thewliss asked.</p>

  <p>"A good firm of inquiry agents."</p>

  <p>Mark received the suggestion with such evident distaste that Sir William
  hastened to elaborate it.</p>

  <p>"The firm I had in mind was Dickson's. They have done a good deal of work
  for us, and I think I can say always with success."</p>

  <p>"A great deal of discretion would be required," Mark Thewliss
  objected.</p>

  <p>A brave submission to inevitable things had been the fine and lovable mark
  of Mona Lightfoot&mdash;a noble humility. But there had been pride in that
  humility. He had never written once to her, and therefore she had never
  written once to him. It would be very difficult, after these long years of
  silence, to persuade her into the acceptance of the smallest quittance. He
  owed a debt. Yes! But what if the creditor refused to acknowledge that a debt
  was owed? He would have to walk very daintily.</p>

  <p>"The condition of the search is secrecy&mdash;absolute secrecy," Mark
  insisted. "If you find Mona Lightfoot, Mona Lightfoot mustn't know that she
  has been found, mustn't know that anyone has been searching for her, above
  all that I have been searching for her. Is that clear?"</p>

  <p>"Quite," said Sir William.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then! Let Dickson's put their very best man on to this
  inquiry. If he's clumsy he spoils everything. Then when he has found out the
  facts&mdash;where she is, whether life is kindly to her&mdash;then, without
  one suspicion occurring to her, let him come back to me!"</p>

  <p>He rose from his chair and picked up his hat and his stick.</p>

  <p>"I'll send for the head of Dickson's to come and see me this afternoon,"
  said Sir William, as he shook hands with his client. He was thinking: "What
  queer birds men are when you get to know them!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>During the next seven weeks Mark had little leisure for either reproaches
  or speculations upon the outcome of his search. For the second time he was
  enlarging the firm's laboratories at the back of Brooke's Market. He sat in
  his place in the House of Commons; he conducted his business; he stayed again
  with Tony Westram and strengthened his friendship with that pleasant family;
  and he completed the purchase of Upper Theign, drawing a cheque for
  forty-seven thousand pounds in the office of Sir William Hawker on an
  afternoon at the end of July.</p>

  <p>Three days later Sir William rang him up on the telephone.</p>

  <p>"Dickson's man has returned," he said. "He has the information you want.
  His name's Joseph Wyatt. When shall I send him to you?"</p>

  <p>"This evening at nine-thirty. I shall be at Grosvenor Street," replied
  Mark; and for the rest of that day he paid very little attention to his
  business.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash;MR. WYATT APPEARS</h2>

  <p class="first">Thewliss suffered a little shock when Mr. Joseph Wyatt was
  introduced into his library. He expected someone with the stamp of his
  vocation, a being saturnine and hawklike with the tread of a cat. He saw
  instead a squat, squarish man with a heavy red moustache, commonplace and
  vulgarian to the broad toes of his boots.</p>

  <p>"It is you whom Dickson's sent on this rather delicate errand!" Mark
  cried.</p>

  <p>Mr. Joseph Wyatt was at all events quick enough to recognise an accent of
  discontent.</p>

  <p>"It was I, Mr. Thewliss," he replied. "I have the advantage of looking
  like a very ordinary commercial traveller. Nobody ever turns round to wonder
  who I am."</p>

  <p>Mark was relieved by the rebuke. Mr. Wyatt, it seemed, was not such a
  dunce as he appeared to be.</p>

  <p>"Besides, you have the information, I understand," Mark continued. "Won't
  you sit down and give it to me?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Wyatt sat down, put his hat on the floor and drew from his pocket a
  paper written over in a shorthand of his own.</p>

  <p>"The investigation has occupied a long time, Mr. Thewliss," he began by
  way of a preface. "But Liverpool is a city of a million people and I had no
  starting-point provided for me. It was a matter of routine. I made inquiries
  of the police, the employment agencies, the registers of churches and
  chapels, the newspaper files, the various political lists of canvassers and
  helpers, and what I may call the social album. Everywhere I drew a blank.
  There remained the laundries."</p>

  <p>"Ingenious," said Mark Thewliss.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me," Mr. Wyatt answered. "Laundries are of the routine of my
  profession. But searching amongst them for a name which may or may not have
  been borne upon the books fourteen years ago is a slow process, especially
  for a man who has no authority behind him and must be careful to provoke as
  little curiosity as possible."</p>

  <p>Mark nodded his head.</p>

  <p>"What excuse did you use?"</p>

  <p>"A possible inheritance."</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't that be likely to reach the ears of the person concerned?"</p>

  <p>"I think not, Mr. Thewliss. I urged that hopes should not be raised
  prematurely. I understand that not a word has been breathed."</p>

  <p>"Good!" said Mark Thewliss.</p>

  <p>Mr. Wyatt cast his eyes upon his paper, and translated.</p>

  <p>"Mona Lightfoot married her employer, Henry Perriton, an accountant, on
  the 26th of November, 1895, at St. Mark's Church, New Brighton."</p>

  <p>"Eighteen ninety-five?" Thewliss exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"You are sure?"</p>

  <p>"I myself saw the entry in the parish register."</p>

  <p>A wry sort of smile twisted Mark's lips. Ninety-five was the year in which
  Mona Lightfoot had gone cruising on the <i>Sea Flower</i>. It had not taken
  her long to forget that intimate month. He had said goodbye to her at
  Southampton and she had just skipped back to Liverpool and in eight weeks she
  was married. The knowledge was a sharp little stab to his pride. No wonder
  that he winced and grimaced for a second or two. It seemed that he was not
  wanted to play the part of Father Christmas.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Perriton is in easy circumstances, I suppose?" he said.</p>

  <p>Mr. Wyatt shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"So, so. He's in a small way of business. A little pinched, I should
  think."</p>

  <p>Mark sat forward in his chair. The little throb of resentment was felt by
  him no more. Pinched was a horrible word. He remembered his beautiful toy,
  the <i>Sea Flower</i>, and how Mona Lightfoot had adored it, and how for a
  month her lovely face and young supple body had graced it. And now as she
  grew to middle-age she was pinched.</p>

  <p>"Where do the Perritons live?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"At Glebe Villa, Acacia Grove."</p>

  <p>Mark almost shuddered. Such an address! Genteel poverty was expressed in
  every syllable of it. He saw Mona Lightfoot clapping her hands together
  half-way across the West Bay and crying: "I have never been out of sight of
  land before," in an ecstasy of delight.</p>

  <p>Had she ever been out of sight of it since? She had had a sort of
  prescience, too, that the glowing wonders of that summer voyage were never to
  be repeated in her lifetime; so thoughtfully had she stored up each detail in
  the lavender of her memories. And now&mdash;Glebe Villa, Acacia Grove, with
  perhaps a week at Southport in August, if some little windfall of business
  had come in Mr. Perriton's way!</p>

  <p>"They have lived there since their marriage?" Mark asked
  discontentedly.</p>

  <p>The name of the house and the street worried him ridiculously. Dreary
  respectability, comfortless decorum, clothes which were threadbare&mdash;he
  found connotations for them by the dozen.</p>

  <p>"Oh no, sir," Mr. Wyatt replied. "For the first ten years Mr. and Mrs.
  Perriton lived a few miles out of the city in the direction of Hoylake. Four
  years ago, however, they moved nearer in to Glebe Villa."</p>

  <p>"Nearer to Perriton's work?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. Nearer to a High School," said Mr. Wyatt; and Mark sat staring
  at his visitor and very still.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" he asked at length in a curiously toneless and quiet
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Nearer to a High School, sir," Mr. Wyatt repeated, raising his voice a
  little. He was under the impression that his explanation had not been
  heard.</p>

  <p>"Why?" Thewliss asked.</p>

  <p>"The Perritons have a daughter. She was born in the year after their
  marriage. She's growing up now. She goes to school."</p>

  <p>The news was a shock to Mark Thewliss. He felt suddenly very small. Whilst
  he had been playing with the idea of a daughter, Mona Lightfoot had got one.
  All his grandeur oozed out of him. He was the wastrel who fritters away the
  day planning and dreaming about the great poem he is going to write, whilst
  some other fellow in a garret is writing it. The girl was growing up too. She
  would be soon at the adorable age&mdash;Angela's age. Mona had outdistanced
  him by years, and since he had only one life he could never catch her up.</p>

  <p>"A daughter!" he murmured in a wondering voice, as though a miracle had
  been revealed to him instead of a perfectly simple, likely, and natural
  process of nature. "What's her name?"</p>

  <p>"Lois," said Mr. Wyatt.</p>

  <p>"Fanciful!" Mark Thewliss exclaimed petulantly. He had never thought of
  "Lois" as a name. Phyllises and Sylvias, yes, but not Loises. And it was an
  attractive name too. The more attractive it looked and sounded, the more he
  was at that moment inclined to resent it. Then he laughed at himself. He had
  that wholesome gift.</p>

  <p>"After all, why shouldn't they call their daughter Lois, if they like the
  name?" he inquired. "Does she match it? Is she pretty?"</p>

  <p>"Takes after the mother, Mr. Thewliss."</p>

  <p>"Then she is."</p>

  <p>Mr. Wyatt pulled at his dragoon's moustache and reflected deeply.</p>

  <p>"I am not much of a judge of female beauty, sir. I take to the ruddy and
  plump myself. But I understand that Miss Lois is considered in Acacia Grove
  rather a crasher. Same big dark eyes and coppery hair as her mother. Tall and
  slim too, and distant like an aristocrat. Yes, sir, that's the general view,
  a crasher. Not what I should call homey, but a crasher."</p>

  <p>Mark laughed cordially. He had got used to the knowledge that Mona had
  outdistanced him. And since she had a daughter, he was delighted that she
  should be a crasher.</p>

  <p>"I must look after them a bit," he said to himself. "I must see if I can't
  put some work in Perriton's way." And the thought that he might protect from
  afar the fortunes of that small family in Liverpool quite restored his
  heart.</p>

  <p>"They are all happy together?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I should say so," Mr. Wyatt returned. "You will remember, of course, that
  your instructions were very precise, Mr. Thewliss. It was essential that the
  Perritons should never have a suspicion that any inquiry about them was being
  made. My investigations, therefore, into so delicate a matter as the domestic
  relationship of the parties were circumscribed."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I understand that," Thewliss agreed.</p>

  <p>"So I never came into actual contact with the Perritons. But from all the
  indications I could gather, there's nothing amiss at all. Mr. Perriton comes
  home regularly to Glebe Villa when his work is done, Mrs. Perriton runs the
  house as well as their straitened means allow, and if there is any need,
  gives at times some help in the office. There is one general servant who has
  been with them for a long while, and so far as I could discover she tells no
  stories of squabbles and rows. There's really no gossip about them at all.
  They make up just the ordinary unnoticeable household of people who are a
  little&mdash;" and Mark Thewliss intervened in a hurry.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, I understand," he said rising from his chair. He had no wish to
  hear that grim word "pinched" applied again to his joyous companion of the
  <i>Sea Flower</i>. "Now I want you to keep me discreetly in touch with that
  family. I want you to go up to Liverpool once every three months, see how
  things are going, without of course in any way revealing your mission, and
  report to me on your return. Can you do that for me?"</p>

  <p>"Quite," said Mr. Wyatt.</p>

  <p>Mark Thewliss held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"And for what you have done, I am very grateful," Thewliss continued. "I
  shall tell Messrs. Hawker, Hawker, and Lyndhurst that I am more than
  satisfied."</p>

  <p>"I thank you, sir," said Mr. Wyatt, and he picked up his hat. "I am glad
  to have been of service, but the work really only needed care. It was
  routine."</p>

  <p>It was unfortunate that Mark Thewliss did not pay a little more attention
  to the limitations of routine. Routine was at once Mr. Wyatt's strength and
  his weakness. Indefatigable in the tracing of facts, he failed in his
  estimate of people. Mark, impressed by his painstaking research, was misled
  into accepting comfortably his judgment of the Perriton household. He could
  no doubt put some work in Henry Perriton's way, and that apparently was as
  all that was needed. Upper Theign, marriage, a daughter&mdash;his way was
  clear in front of him and unclouded with reproach. He went to bed that night
  with a light heart.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash;THE PERRITON HOUSEHOLD</h2>

  <p class="first">Eighteen months later a noticeable event occurred one
  morning at Glebe Villa. Mr. Henry Perriton at the breakfast table lifted his
  head above the edge of his newspaper and addressed his wife. As a rule the
  meal was eaten in a grim silence, Mr. Perriton at one end of the table
  bending forward over his plate to read the news, Mona at the other behind the
  coffee pot, Lois in the middle between them and animosity brooding overhead
  like a thundercloud. But to-day Henry Perriton showed his face and spoke.</p>

  <p>It was not an engaging face. The sandy hair, which had always been thin,
  had for the most part gone with the snows of yesteryear. Only a few
  sedulously cultivated wisps were drawn up from a very low side parting just
  above the left ear and plastered down across the scalp. The pale eyes were
  watery and their dog-like wistfulness of fourteen years ago had vanished with
  his locks. Mr. Joseph Wyatt would certainly have described his features as
  pinched except for the nose which, to keep in a conformity with the watering
  eyes, had grown a little bulbous and in hue inclined to the purple. It was on
  the whole rather an unpleasant insignificance than a face. Nor were his words
  and intonation any more agreeable.</p>

  <p>"So he has got off at last," he said with a sneer. "With a fine lady too!
  Well, well, see what money can do! Give Mr. Long-in-the-tooth a million, and,
  bless my soul, we'ld all swear he hadn't cut his grinders yet. What's a
  crow's-foot in you and me, my dear, is just character in a millionaire. Such
  an affair as it was. Pages and bridesmaids all polished up to their toe-tips
  and a real live balloon-sleeved Bishop&mdash;none of your synthetic
  suffragans&mdash;to give the right apostolic touch to the show. You must read
  the account of it, my dear. Very glowing and sycophantic. But you mustn't
  forget your housework, will you? There's the neck of mutton to be heated up
  for dinner and the dirty linen to be listed."</p>

  <p>Mona never replied. To Lois the acquiescence of her adored mother was
  always a quite unintelligible fact. She wanted Mona to be up and doing even
  in advance of provocation, returning thrust for thrust until her little
  wizened father was pinned to the wall, his limbs jerking helplessly like a
  marionette's. But Lois never enjoyed that engaging spectacle. Her mother
  submitted...and submitted...and submitted.</p>

  <p>This morning perhaps? Lois looked at her mother hopefully. For just for a
  moment husband and wife confronted one another&mdash;frankly enemies. Lois
  saw the blood begin to rise, creeping upwards from the throat over her
  mother's fine worn face, until it stained her forehead. Now at last the fur
  would fly; there would be plain speaking and a battle royal, and her father
  would come out of the fray thoroughly limp and quite cured of his pedantic
  sarcasms. But these desirable events did not happen. Mona, for the thousandth
  time, submitted. But none the less there was a change in that room. The dull
  brooding thundercloud became active. Lois was aware of wave upon wave of
  repugnance and actual detestation passing from each end of the table and
  clashing in mid-air, just where she herself sat; but not above her head. Each
  wave caught her into the swirl, tossed her, buffeted her, drowned her, until
  she sat dizzy with her wits all scattered. Her mother brought her back to her
  senses with a warning look at the clock upon the mantelshelf.</p>

  <p>"Lois darling, if you don't hurry you'll be late for school."</p>

  <p>Mr. Perriton, having broken through his habit of silence, now turned his
  sarcasms upon Lois.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that would never do," he said. "If my daughter couldn't pass her
  examinations in Hindustani and the higher trigonometry at the end of the
  term, the family would be disgraced and all the money I have paid in
  school-fees wasted."</p>

  <p>Lois rose quickly from her chair. Perriton, when he took any notice of her
  at all, used a form of raillery hateful above all to children and soldiers,
  which consists of a mocking tone and long words; and she detested her father
  accordingly. Her mother followed her into the hall, and found her red in the
  face with rage and her eyes full of tears.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't mind, Lois. Your father is in one of his moods," said Mona
  consolingly.</p>

  <p>"He's in his only mood," cried Lois, stamping her foot. "I hate him! I
  hate him."</p>

  <p>"Lois, that's very wicked," said her mother.</p>

  <p>"I know. I am wicked." Indeed she was fairly certain at this time that she
  was a lost soul. For on a Sunday two years before she had been greatly
  impressed by a verse in the Second Lesson from the fifth chapter of St.
  Matthew. And being baited by her father on her return home at the Sunday
  dinner, she had, with a quite fearful audacity, said to him under her breath,
  "Raca," and having said it again was driven on by a sort of pride in her
  inconceivable wickedness to say it again, "Raca!" Now, to say that to your
  brother put you in danger of the council, whatever dreadful torment that
  meant. But for the little girl who said it twice on a Sunday, too, to her
  father, there couldn't be much hope. But she wouldn't take it back. Her
  father had driven her to it. And when after they were all dead and he saw her
  in danger of the council, he might be sorry for what he had done. Oh, yes,
  she was wicked. "How could I help being wicked, with a father who drinks
  himself muzzy every night?"</p>

  <p>Her mother was horrified.</p>

  <p>"Hush!" she said sternly. "How dare you say a thing like that!"</p>

  <p>"It's true, Mummy," Lois insisted stubbornly; and indeed it was the truth.
  It was the explanation of the fact which had given to Mr. Wyatt so favourable
  an impression of the domesticity of the Perriton household. Henry Perriton
  came straight home from his office after the day's work was done. Yes, no
  doubt that he did. He even hurried home. But it was the bottle which drew him
  He drank silently, sullenly, by himself, a creature of disappointment,
  convinced that the world was in a conspiracy to ignore his merits.</p>

  <p>It was true that within the last two years more work had come his way than
  ever before. But even that was now an offence to him. His habits were formed.
  The work came too late, and a good deal of it he actually declined. He
  preferred to grumble over the wrongs the world had done to him. That was a
  good deal more tempting than buckling to and throwing them off.</p>

  <p>Lois took up her attache case&mdash;the attache case was just at this time
  beginning to supersede the satchel amongst all self-respecting
  schoolgirls&mdash;and went off to her class. She was puzzled by her father's
  outburst at the breakfast table, and wondered what a fashionable wedding in
  London could have to do with her beloved mother.</p>

  <p>"But that mystery can wait till I get home," she told herself firmly.</p>

  <p>For she, too, had her own carefully-guarded secret. From her love for her
  mother there had sprung a fine and courageous plan, and for nothing in the
  world would she have missed ten minutes of her schooling.</p>

  <p>Whilst she then toiled at her lessons, later on that morning after the
  orders were given and the household work done, Mona Perriton read word by
  word in the newspaper an account of the marriage at St. Margaret's,
  Westminster, of Mark Thewliss, Esq., of Grosvenor Street and Upper Theign in
  the County of Berkshire, Member of Parliament for the Amworth Division, to
  the Lady Olivia Stanton, daughter of the late Earl of Porlock. The account
  was written by a lady and glowed with enthusiasm. For though Porlock and his
  gee-gees had eaten up the Porlock estates, there were branches of the family
  of wealth and high importance, and these had dutifully rallied now that the
  foolishly obstinate Olivia had forgotten her dead soldier and consented to
  marry a millionaire.</p>

  <p>The affair was altogether very dashing and brilliant. The Duchess of
  Gryborough lent her mansion in Berkeley Square for the reception; Laura
  Viscountess Harmere provided the trousseau; one of the Royal Blood was
  present in the Church; a Bishop joined the happy pair, and after the ceremony
  all London flocked to Berkeley Square, from the Prime Minister to the actor
  of the moment. The dresses were described with the requisite wealth of
  technicalities, the bride in ivory satin and priceless lace which had come
  over with William of Orange, the bridesmaids in pale gold chiffon with amber
  shoes, and two little pages in white velvet court suits carried the bridal
  train. Scotland Yard watched over the presents, and at the close of the
  resounding event, the bride and bridegroom left in a Rolls-Royce car to join
  Mr. Thewliss' auxiliary topsail schooner which was waiting for them in
  Southampton Water.</p>

  <p>"Well, he can sail past the Dean's Elbow this time, and no wedding ring
  need be dropped into the water," she said to herself, but without any
  bitterness, rather indeed with a tender little smile for that foolish
  wondrous month west of where England began. She had gambled with her eyes
  open and she had lost. She had no reproaches to make.</p>

  <p>"This is the end," she said, looking again at the account of the marriage.
  Had she nursed a hope unacknowledged to herself during all these years, that
  at some time, somehow, a miracle would transform her world? That the enormous
  distance between Glebe Villa, Acacia Grove, and Upper Theign in the County of
  Berkshire could be bridged? Or had she some quite other and deeper thought
  hidden away at the back of her mind, some purpose held in reserve against a
  final hammer-stroke of misery?</p>

  <p>"This is the end," she repeated. "This is really the end." Yet at that
  moment, on the opposite side of the street, an unnoticeable man with a
  dragoon's moustache was strolling past her windows, and Lois was hurrying
  home from her school so that she might read the account of that wedding which
  had set the blood flaming in her mother's face.</p>

  <p>Mr. Perriton took his luncheon in a cafe near to his office, so that this
  one hour of the day at Glebe Villa was a treasure to both mother and
  daughter. It was an hour of confidences and gaiety and refreshment; and both
  prepared for it with a pretty foppery as though for some long-anticipated
  festival. No slovenliness must mar it. If a new ribbon had been bought, it
  was at this hour it would make its first appearance. Thus Lois hurrying home
  some ten minutes before her usual time, had the dining-room to herself whilst
  her mother was in her room upstairs.</p>

  <p>"Mark Thewliss," she said to herself in perplexity. She had no doubt that
  this was the man who had got off at last because he was a millionaire. For
  one thing he had married a fine lady, the Lady Olivia Stanton. For another, a
  Bishop had tied the knot, and no Bishop had tied any other knot on that
  particular day. But...Mark Thewliss? Lois had never heard of him. She was
  still a child. She imagined a romance. But she could not bring it into any
  reasonable relationship with fact.</p>

  <p>That her father and Mark Thewliss had both been suitors for her lovely
  mother's hand&mdash;yes, that was all that was intelligible. But that her
  father had won! No! Strange couples, no doubt, she admitted in her youthful
  wisdom, did pass through the gateway of roses into that unknown wilderness
  which was married life. Her mother was a living proof of it. But that Henry
  Perriton had actually triumphed over a rival, like an armoured knight in the
  lists&mdash;no, reason refused the contention.</p>

  <p>For once in a way there was a restraint upon both mother and daughter, and
  the meal went to a sigh instead of to a laugh.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash;LOIS GROWS UP</h2>

  <p class="first">Lois finished her schooling soon after her sixteenth
  birthday and at the end of the summer term. She saw that morning dawn with
  delight, for she had tossed during the last six months in a fever of
  impatience to begin upon the purpose which she had nursed in secrecy. She
  used the very first day of her freedom in its furtherance. For at eleven
  o'clock she set out from Glebe Villa and walked to her father's office at the
  back of the big square in the middle of the city.</p>

  <p>It was not an easy walk for her, however, for her knees shook a little,
  and every now and then she drew in a breath with a great lift of the heart;
  and what had seemed in Acacia Grove a sensible request swelled into an
  enormity as she reached the busy thoroughfares. Not that the stress and
  apprehension were visible to any stranger. Those who turned to watch her as
  she passed saw only a tall slim girl, with an eager, lovely face, the
  radiance of whose youth awakened some tiny sense of pain that it must pass so
  soon, some moment of wonder what the world had in store for her. But the
  anxiety was there, troubling her so deeply that the sequence and the words of
  the little dutiful speeches she had rehearsed began to seem ridiculous, and
  as ineffective as copy-book rhetoric.</p>

  <p>She climbed to the second floor and entered the small outer office in
  which Mona had worked when she had taken employment with Henry Perriton.
  Another stenographer now sat in Mona's place. But that was the only change.
  The same cheap and scanty office furniture stood against dingy walls on the
  same worn drugget, and there was the same lack of busy clients.</p>

  <p>"Can I see my father?" Lois asked.</p>

  <p>"I'll see."</p>

  <p>The stenographer went into the inner room and came out again.</p>

  <p>"Will you go in, please, Miss Perriton?"</p>

  <p>Lois, with her heart beating violently against her ribs, stepped into the
  small room and closed the door. Henry Perriton was standing with his back to
  her at the one window, and he spoke without turning.</p>

  <p>"And to what do I owe the singular honour of a visit from you to these
  unromantic purlieus?" he asked.</p>

  <p>There was no lightness in his tone. He uttered his pedantics
  automatically, his eyes and his attention fixed upon the pavement two floors
  below.</p>

  <p>"Father," Lois blurted out. She had prepared explanations, arguments, all
  justifying diplomatically the final culminating request. They went overboard
  now. She would have floundered over them, would probably have been dismissed
  to get her little speech by heart with a few phrases meant to be cutting. She
  rushed straight upon the aim of her visit.</p>

  <p>"Father, I want thirty pounds."</p>

  <p>And in a second she was no longer nervous, she was terribly frightened.
  Perriton swung round from the window with a strangled cry of sheer
  ungovernable rage. His face had gone white, his eyes glared at her. She had
  never seen hatred before except in the mimicry of stage and screen. She saw
  the real thing now&mdash;naked, appalling, devouring her from head to foot.
  The simple daintiness of her dress was an offence, her look of distinction an
  outrage.</p>

  <p>"Come here!" he said in a whisper from a dry throat.</p>

  <p>Lois shrank away.</p>

  <p>"I'll pay it back," she answered, her voice shaking. "I meant to promise
  that before I asked for the money. But I was nervous and..."</p>

  <p>Mr. Perriton interrupted her savagely.</p>

  <p>"Pay it back! You! Dolls cost money, but they don't pay. Come here!"</p>

  <p>He advanced towards her, and Lois' fear sharpened into a panic. She
  fumbled for the door-handle behind her, not daring to take her eyes from his
  face.</p>

  <p>"Father!" she stammered. She clasped her hands over her throat, thinking
  in the extremity of her terror that he meant to kill her.</p>

  <p>"Father!" And the name set him laughing mirthlessly, hideously, for whilst
  his mouth grinned and his teeth chattered with laughter his eyes were the
  eyes of a creature spitting venom.</p>

  <p>"Father That's a good one," he cried. "Come here&mdash;before it's too
  late."</p>

  <p>If he had taken a step nearer to her she would have screamed. But he
  turned back to the window and again peered out of it.</p>

  <p>"Quick&mdash;" he whispered urgently, making room for her at his
  side&mdash;so urgently that Lois left the protection of the door and crossed
  the room. Then he seized her wrist and pressed her closer to the pane.</p>

  <p>"Look down! Do you see that man on the opposite side of the street? The
  small man with the moustache as big as himself? Watch how carelessly he
  strolls by&mdash;the rotten idiot! He'll turn in a second and have a look at
  our windows. Doesn't he do it well, the ass? Ah, he has seen you! Yes! He's
  crossing the road. He'll stroll back to the door of this building. You'll see
  him when you go out. Sure to! For he has got to see you."</p>

  <p>Lois wondered whether her father's anger had not upset his reason.</p>

  <p>"Why has he got to see me?"</p>

  <p>"To make his report, of course."</p>

  <p>"Report!"</p>

  <p>Lois was losing her fear now. Henry Perriton was dwindling before her
  eyes. From being grand in the terror which he had inspired he was becoming
  little again, the purveyor of unpolished sarcasms which missed their mark,
  which simply rubbed on an old wound rather than pierced with an
  arrow-pang.</p>

  <p>"Yes, my dear, it's surely obvious. You are growing up. Mr. Wyatt there is
  in duty bound to make his report. He must say how pretty you are and how
  smart you look and what little trouble you are likely to give, and how
  everything is for the best in the best of all possible worlds. Of course he
  must report."</p>

  <p>"To whom?"</p>

  <p>For a moment Mr. Perriton hesitated, jerking his head backwards in a kind
  of spasm as though dumbness took him at the very moment of speech. But the
  temptation was too strong. He was boiling with his wrongs and his failures,
  not one of which he attributed to himself.</p>

  <p>"To your father, of course."</p>

  <p>The words were out now. Mr. Perriton was very glad that he had spoken
  them. He was getting a bit of his own back, what? He seemed to hear some
  imaginary man of the world winking at him over a glass of beer and using just
  those words. "Getting a bit of your own back, what? Stout fellow!"</p>

  <p>"Your father, Mark Thewliss, the millionaire. Ah, he's the wise man,"
  Perriton continued. "None of your early marriages for him. He knows better.
  He's going to run, so he strips for the race. Millionaire at forty and
  caterwauling in the House of Commons a couple of years later. Marriage? To be
  sure. But marriage with Her Ladyship of the County Families, and a bishop to
  do the trick. Whilst up there in Liverpool&mdash;by God, he must laugh when
  he thinks of it&mdash;a little overworked accountant carries on his shoulders
  his mistress and his bastard."</p>

  <p>The ugly, abominable word was spoken. Perriton heard a stifled moan, but
  he was still on the flood tide of his rancours. There was no stopping him
  now. He could not have stopped himself. Mona Lightfoot had told him the truth
  before she consented to marry him. Her month upon the Sea Flower with Mark
  Thewliss, her knowledge that a child would be born&mdash;everything. But in
  his desire for her he had accepted the position. He had married with his eyes
  open and no longer a young man. But his passion had withered. The dreams of a
  future broadening out into the ease of a successful professional man in a
  huge business community had not been realised. There was a fatal obstacle
  somewhere, and he found it not at all in himself, but in the burden of a wife
  and a daughter who was another man's child. He was not of the fibre which
  endures. Success must come to him quickly if at all. He could not build.</p>

  <p>"Had I been a free man...What a fool I was..."</p>

  <p>These were the constant useless enfeebling fancies at the back of all his
  thoughts. He began to look upon Mona as a crafty woman who had ensnared him
  to his ruin. He was next door to hate of her, but he actually hated Lois. He
  hated her beauty, the queer look of distinction she had from her mother; he
  grudged every farthing which was spent upon her food, her schooling, her
  clothes. And on the top of it all she had the nerve to march down to his
  office on a busy day&mdash;yes, his delusions carried him even to that
  extravagance&mdash;in her neat brown coat and skirt, a white crpe-de-Chine
  blouse, her Sunday silk stockings and her bright patent leather shoes, and
  ask him for thirty pounds. Just that! Thirty pounds, as if it was tuppence!
  Such a string of virulent complaints broke from him and frothed and tumbled,
  it seemed that all the failures of all the generations were shaking their
  fists at the cloudy power which kept them under.</p>

  <p>"Do you want proof?" he cried. "There it is, below the window, on the
  pavement. Mr. Joseph Wyatt. Mark Thewliss' secret agent. Every year up he
  bobs, stroking his stupid Viking's moustache and thinking himself invisible.
  Three or four times a year. Making little inquiries. All so that he may go
  back and tell Thewliss that we are getting on just the same, and not likely
  to cause him any trouble in his fine new married life."</p>

  <p>"How do you know that?"</p>

  <p>The young voice at his shoulder was now ominously quiet and level, but
  Henry Perriton was not aware of the change. He did not look at her, did not
  think of her, as a being to whom he had dealt out shame and disillusionment
  and a too-swift maturity with the strokes of an axe. Lois was nothing more to
  him than a pair of ears. He crowed.</p>

  <p>"People don't make inquiries about me for long without it coming to my
  ears. Once a Mr. Wyatt may come along and do his spying&mdash;twice perhaps.
  But a third time&mdash;no! I begin to notice him. Mr. Wyatt talks to my
  tradesmen, does he? And he talks to my servant. Then we set a little trap for
  him. Who's at the back of inquiries? Just between friends, you know, over a
  final whisky-and-soda in the bar. The disclosure to stop there, of course.
  Not a word to be breathed, my hand on my heart? And out pops the
  name&mdash;Mark Thewliss&mdash;and nods and winks to underline it."</p>

  <p>The nods and winks had been due to Joseph Wyatt's complete ignorance of
  why Mark Thewliss wanted his reports and to his reluctance to admit his
  ignorance. Wyatt was a slave of routine, carrying out instructions which
  needed a better man in a matter, the very core of which was unknown to his
  employer. For that Lois Perriton was Mark's daughter, the secret cause of all
  the overwhelming troubles which were to follow, may have been known to the
  man in the moon, but was unimagined by either Mark himself or Mr. Joseph
  Wyatt. Hence the nods and winks in the bar following the sound old rule, "If
  you don't know, affect a mystery."</p>

  <p>Mr. Perriton, however, had and could have no doubt that Mark knew it. Nor
  any longer could Lois.</p>

  <p>"So now you know," said Mr. Perriton, but not quite so easily. "I am not
  the man from whom you have the right to ask for thirty pounds."</p>

  <p>He received no confirmation of that statement.</p>

  <p>"Well, have you?"</p>

  <p>And again he had no answer.</p>

  <p>In such men as Henry Perriton the violent passions reach their climax
  soon. Rejoinders may prolong their fury for a little while, but collapse is
  imminent and certain. Mr. Perriton recollected with discomfort that he had
  promised and sworn over and over again that never should the child that was
  to be born know the truth about its birth, if only Mona would marry him; that
  even so Mona had with difficulty been persuaded. It was hard for him to
  realise so long after his desire had withered that this compact had been
  made. But it had been, and he had broken it. He began to feel an
  uneasiness.</p>

  <p>"Well, have you the right, Lois?" There was a note almost of pleading in
  his voice. "You can understand how you must have exasperated me."</p>

  <p>For the third time there was no reply. Mr. Perriton's fingers beat a
  tattoo upon the window-pane. Suppose that Lois, at whom he hesitated to look,
  were to run home and tell her mother in a flood of tears of the scene which
  had occurred, what was going to happen?</p>

  <p>"If she leaves me there'll be a scandal," he said to himself. "The truth
  will come out. And the truth isn't respectable."</p>

  <p>Respectability meant a good deal to Mr. Perriton. That's why he drank
  alone. It meant a good deal, too, to his business. It lay not amongst the
  great houses which wanted their work done by the men most competent but
  amongst smaller people, tradesmen and the like, who looked for respectability
  as much as for competence. It would not do for Mona to leave him&mdash;and
  she would leave him. She was proficient as a secretary and clerk. She could
  make a living for herself and for Lois, too, worse luck! Mr. Perriton felt
  that he stood upon quaking sands.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry that I said what I did, Lois," he said meekly. "You must
  forget it, my dear," and Lois laughed.</p>

  <p>The laugh was a shock to Henry Perriton. Tears he would have welcomed. He
  could have got round tears. Tears would have been his opportunity. But hard,
  rude, contemptuous laughter made his position very difficult. He looked at
  Lois now for the first time since he had dragged her to the window, and he
  tingled with alarm. She was standing erect at the side of the window, her
  hands clenched at her side, her eyes shining pebbles. He had not one clue to
  the thoughts which moved behind them, except this: they were not gentle
  thoughts. Her face was the colour of parchment. Lois had neither beauty nor
  youth at that moment. Nor, on the other hand, had she any look of age. He
  seemed to himself to be face to face with someone eternal.</p>

  <p>"Lois, I was carried away. I have business worries, and your request on
  the top of them...Yes, it was deplorable," he pleaded, and his voice trailed
  lamentably to silence.</p>

  <p>Lois waited until he had finished, and then turned and walked towards the
  door. Her movement shook Mr. Perriton into action. He was at the door before
  Lois, with his back to the panels, gesticulating, stuttering.</p>

  <p>"You won't tell Mona...Promise me! You won't breathe a word to her. It
  would upset everything."</p>

  <p>"But everything is upset," Lois answered.</p>

  <p>"Not everything," babbled Mr. Perriton. "We are both sensible people. We
  can make the best of things, can't we? I've had a hard life, Lois. You'll
  agree when you come to think of it quietly. Don't act in a hurry. We'll talk
  it over together."</p>

  <p>"We'll never talk it over," said Lois.</p>

  <p>Of the shame and distress which overwhelmed her she would not betray a
  sign. She stood implacably erect, conscious for the first time of a strength
  which even then thrilled and uplifted her. After the first stunning blow she
  had very quickly recovered. She meant to have her way now with the little man
  who gibbered out his prayers to her. He didn't matter.</p>

  <p>The enemy was not Henry Perriton, but the man at Upper Theign, who had
  robbed her adored mother of the wide life for which nature had meant her, and
  had made her herself&mdash;well, what she was. Him she would hate by night
  and by day to the last conscious minute of life. She had no reproaches for
  her mother. Her heart, indeed, was even tenderer towards her. She understood
  now the reason of Mona's submission, and, with a flash of insight, her
  constant grief that she could not open up for her daughter the dazzling
  avenues which marriage with Mark Thewliss would have secured.</p>

  <p>"You'll promise me! You'll promise me!" Henry Perriton was reduced to a
  monotonous repetition. "You'll promise me your silence, Lois."</p>

  <p>"On one condition," Lois replied at length. "Yes? Yes?"</p>

  <p>"You must lend me the thirty pounds I came for."</p>

  <p>"I'll give it to you, Lois."</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"I will. With pleasure."</p>

  <p>Lois, with a shrug of her shoulders, ceased to argue. She was going to pay
  it back. Repayment would be the first charge. That for her was the end of the
  matter.</p>

  <p>"I'll bring the money home for you this evening." Lois shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>Mr. Perriton was a little taken aback.</p>

  <p>"You want it now&mdash;this minute?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Very well. I'll write a cheque and send my clerk out to cash it."</p>

  <p>Mr. Perriton sat down at his desk and wrote with a jibe in his mind which
  he dared not utter.</p>

  <p>"She's the daughter of her father, not a doubt of it. That's the way men
  become millionaires. Ask for an hour's credit and you are looking down the
  barrel of a pistol." He sent his secretary with the cheque to the bank, and
  Lois sat down in a chair.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you now why I want the money," she said. "It's the cost of a
  full course of tuition in shorthand, typewriting and the simpler secretarial
  duties. I always meant to be free of you at the first possible moment, even
  when I believed myself to be your daughter."</p>

  <p>"My dear," Mr. Perriton expostulated with an attempt at a smile, "that
  wasn't very nice of you."</p>

  <p>"I am not nice," said Lois coldly.</p>

  <p>The clerk brought the bank-notes into the private office and retired. Mr.
  Perriton counted them out to Lois, who tucked them away into her bag.</p>

  <p>"So that's your plan! To be free and independent," said Mr. Perriton with
  a rueful attempt at jocularity.</p>

  <p>"Half of it," Lois returned shortly. The other half was not for his nor
  for anyone's ears yet. It was much too great a secret even to be whispered
  aloud to herself. She meant to make a little home, somewhere a long way from
  Liverpool, for her mother and herself, where there should be no cheap
  sarcasms, no silent submissions; quite a little home, but so warm with
  happiness and gay with laughter that a kingdom could not match it. For the
  moment, however, she could not dwell upon it. She did not notice Mr. Wyatt
  when she came out again into the street, although he was close to her,
  unconcernedly fondling his dragoon's moustache. She walked along the pavement
  seeing no one, with a heart full of bitterness and humiliation.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash;THE HOLIDAY</h2>

  <p class="first">Amidst the crowd which gathered outside Buckingham Palace on
  the night of July 31st, 1914, like a family in some momentous crisis about
  its chief, stood Lois Perriton. She was then a little over eighteen years
  old; and during the last twelve months she had been employed at a salary of
  three pounds a week in the London office of a society for the protection of
  wild animals. The grim history of a great war was accurately foreseen only by
  the few; and Lois was wondering with a thrill of pleasurable excitement, as
  were so many in that throng, what vast upheavals the cataclysm of to-morrow
  was to bring about, and how they were to affect the tiny section of the world
  in which she moved. Of two things she was sure. One, that she was alive in
  that year of that century; two, that other work than the protection of wild
  animals must be sought for and obtained.</p>

  <p>Efficiency combined with an overmastering purpose&mdash;in Lois' case the
  half of her plan which she had not disclosed to Henry Perriton&mdash;have a
  way of forcing circumstances into their service; and before Christmas had
  come Lois was a clerk in the Intelligence Division of the Admiralty. She had
  long since learnt that of matters of importance it was wise to speak to one
  only. In looks we know that she was a "crasher," and looks in this unfair
  world always help; she had, too, as a basic quality of her being the
  appealing aloofness of her mother. It was inevitable that as the great
  department expanded, she should rise to positions of ever increasing
  confidence.</p>

  <p>She made a few real friends amongst the other girls. She lost the sense of
  humiliation which Perriton's disclosure had caused her, and she, in many
  respects still a child, had exaggerated into a visible brand. She realised
  that whatever her natal stigma, she was herself, and that in this new day of
  stress and endeavour it was only persons themselves that counted. She put
  some of her salary by each week. She saw the fulfilment of her purpose
  drawing nearer and nearer. Though she did not consciously say, "Let the war
  go on," she knew greater happiness during those years than she had known, and
  anticipated the end of them with anxiety.</p>

  <p>In one respect, however, the greater amenities of her life brought with
  them no softening. The man she hated was still the man she hated. He was the
  great blot upon this new fair register of her account with the world. She
  would never see his face if she could help it. If she had to see him, she
  would never speak to him. She would rather go away by herself and say "Raca"
  again, and endure all the terror of the flames which consumed but never ended
  consuming, as she had once done in her childhood. She hated him with bone and
  with muscle.</p>

  <p>Yet on a morning of December, 1917, at twelve o'clock precisely, as she
  was returning to her room with a file of papers in her hand, she came upon a
  long, lean man whose appearance suggested that he was midway in the fifties.
  He was wandering rather helplessly in that network of corridors which housed
  the Intelligence Division. Lois Perriton turned about and, with the
  pleasantly maternal solicitude for the decrepit which the young people of the
  day displayed towards the middle-aged, asked:</p>

  <p>"Can I help you in any way?"</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt you can," the stranger replied, "I am looking for the
  D.N.I."</p>

  <p>"The Director himself?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," returned the visitor. "The great Panjandrum himself with the little
  button on the top. He expects me."</p>

  <p>Lois smiled tolerantly.</p>

  <p>"I'll take you there."</p>

  <p>"It is perhaps out of your way," the unknown hinted.</p>

  <p>"Not a bit," Lois answered with not a little pride. "I work in the
  Director's office."</p>

  <p>And suddenly she saw that he was a little puzzled and that he looked at
  her keenly.</p>

  <p>"Of course none of these old people can get it into their heads that the
  really responsible positions ought to be in the hands of young people. That's
  why the war came," she said to herself. Aloud she merely remarked:</p>

  <p>"It is here," and she opened the door of a large light room with a couple
  of big windows looking out upon the Horse Guards' Parade. The Director, who
  looked more like the abbe he certainly was not than the admiral he certainly
  was, swung round from the tall desk in the middle of the room at which he was
  standing.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," he cried. "You are the very man I was wanting. Will you
  come in with me?"</p>

  <p>He opened the door of an inner room and ushering in his visitor, called to
  his secretary who had been standing at the desk with him: "John, we'll settle
  that matter as soon as I am free."</p>

  <p>For half an hour the two men remained confabulating in the inner room,
  whilst Lois worked at her big table under one of the windows, and officers
  and civilians drifted in and out and talked with the secretary. Then the
  inner door was thrown open again and the admiral stood in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"I want the figures of the high explosives used at the Battle of Jutland.
  Miss Perriton, you know where they are."</p>

  <p>Lois extracted a sheet of paper from a file and carried it into the
  private room. The Director looked at the paper and handed it across the
  table.</p>

  <p>"There you are!"</p>

  <p>The visitor took it and read it slowly.</p>

  <p>"Might I have a copy?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"By all means," the admiral agreed. "Miss Perriton, will you make
  one?"</p>

  <p>"He can have this one," she answered; and as she handed the sheet of paper
  to the visitor he made the most ridiculous remark.</p>

  <p>"She certainly is a crasher."</p>

  <p>He made it with conviction and aloud, as though truth forced the words
  from him. Then he coloured and giggled foolishly, explaining: "Though 'she'
  is a very disrespectful word to apply to the Battle of Jutland. Well, I'll be
  going on my way."</p>

  <p>"Dippy," said Lois to herself.</p>

  <p>It was the second time that the famous head of Mardyke and Campion had had
  that epithet applied to him by a girl.</p>

  <p>Lois returned to her table, the Director resumed at the high desk his
  discussion with his secretary, the visitor retired from the Admiralty. Thus
  father and daughter met for the first time.</p>

  <p>Mark Thewliss, though he had failed to impress Lois Perriton, was at this
  time a very important person. At the outbreak of war his maiden speech had
  been remembered. He had been put in charge of an amalgamation of factories
  for the manufacture of high explosives. Within two years he was a Cabinet
  Minister and a member of the inner War Cabinet. And no man was looking
  forward more eagerly to the defeat of the enemy, or with more definite plans
  for the era of peace. Indeed, the pens were hardly dry in the Gallery of
  Mirrors at Versailles when he resigned from office and was raised to the
  peerage as Baron Thewliss of Upper Theign.</p>

  <p>He was in a hurry. He was too shrewd a man not to understand that so many
  unproductive millions could not be blown into the air without a dreadful
  consequence to the nation's economic life. But he was equally certain that
  through a few years of busy reconstruction, the dreadful consequence would
  not be felt. Meanwhile the hamper of the German patents had gone. Mark
  Thewliss hurried back to Brooke's Market; the bazaars of Fez and Mequinez,
  Marrakesch and Casablanca, the Indies, the countries of Europe hung out fresh
  and entrancing colours for their customers. In the boom years Mardyke and
  Campion boomed mightily.</p>

  <p>But the axe fell upon the Division of Naval Intelligence, and at the end
  of July, 1919, when she had entered upon her twenty-third year, Lois found
  herself out of a job, with a gratuity and two hundred pounds saved besides.
  She had need of a holiday&mdash;how great a need she only knew when the
  holiday was forced on her&mdash;and for once in a way she locked cares,
  purpose, hatred, away in a dark cupboard and gave herself to the natural
  spirits of her youth.</p>

  <p>She was invited to spend a month in Venice by a young woman who, whilst
  her husband was in France, had worked with her in the Admiralty. It was a
  young and joyous party. The yellow bathing sands with their long, lazy days
  and colourful company; the dinners suddenly organised in the open air outside
  some little inn in a tiny square of the town; the silent gliding in a gondola
  at night along black and narrow canals between precipices of lofty and
  decaying palaces, where the gentle splash of the oar was the only sound; the
  new friends; an occasional dash out to the islands in a motor-boat; the life
  and beauty of the Piazza all made up a glamorous month which repeated for
  Lois her mother's cruise on the <i>Sea Flower</i>.</p>

  <p>The same revelation, the same novelty, the same magic. But mother and
  daughter took their hours of loveliness and made of them very different
  things. By one they were set apart as a treasure of good memories, by the
  other as a nursery of resentments.</p>

  <p>On the morning before Lois was to return to England, there appeared on the
  beach of the Lido a French nobleman with a resounding name, whose claim to
  reputation depended upon the circumstance that he had run through three
  immense fortunes of three successive American wives and written a book about
  it afterwards. He was declaiming to a young English Lieutenant-Colonel there
  recovering from wounds, on the vulgarity of the scene.</p>

  <p>"It is all disgusting," he cried. "There is no taste. There is no
  nobility. I go from here to Aix. I shall find the same disheartening medley
  there."</p>

  <p>"Why do you go there?" the Lieutenant-Colonel asked bluntly. "And why do
  you come here?"</p>

  <p>The great nobleman waved his stick.</p>

  <p>"It is the ruin of an era. As a philosopher I like to see "&mdash;and he
  broke off suddenly with a most unphilosophical gleam in his eyes. A girl slim
  and tall, a goddess in a blue bathing suit and green shoes, sauntered past
  them. "<i>Quelle jolie dmarche!</i>" he exclaimed, with all the enthusiasm
  of a connoisseur in such matters.</p>

  <p>The goddess in the bathing suit and the green shoes was Lois Perriton; and
  that night the young Lieutenant-Colonel, whose name was Derek Crayle, sat
  next to her at a dinner-party at the Grand Hotel. He told her of the great
  nobleman's change of humour when he had seen her stroll past him, and having
  thus broken the ice they began to discover how interesting they were compared
  to the rest of the party. Then they both fell upon a gentle melancholy.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what I shall do now," said Derek Crayle. "Of course I can't
  keep my present command. With all the brigadiers about, we've got to tumble
  down the ladder as fast as we went up it. My uncle Tony Westram would like me
  to go on. I should get a company, no doubt."</p>

  <p>"Your trouble's only an eclipse. Mine's an axe," Lois replied ruefully,
  and she told him of her four years and how she had risen from a cellar in the
  basement to the fine room overlooking the Horse Guards Parade.</p>

  <p>"And you mean to say the Admiralty is going to do without you!" cried
  Derek in a stupefaction.</p>

  <p>Lois nodded.</p>

  <p>"It's going to try to."</p>

  <p>"It's mad," said Derek Crayle emphatically.</p>

  <p>This was only one of the points on which the couple found themselves in
  agreement. The old men were coming back again. The world apparently had
  learnt nothing&mdash;absolutely nothing. The moment the danger was over it
  was once more "Make way for the aged." Fine young brilliant tacticians must
  go back to the barrack-square and, still worse, wonderful girls must leave
  the Admiralty. Lois' neighbour on the other side had a continuous view during
  that dinner-party of a charming young white shoulder draped in a pale green
  frock, whilst the lady next to Derek Crayle was offered the contemplation of
  the back of his dinner-jacket. They slipped away together when the company
  rose.</p>

  <p>"I have a gondola at the Luna Steps," Derek Crayle suggested. "What do you
  say? Less stuffy than dancing&mdash;what?"</p>

  <p>Lois nodded and, fetching a gay cloak of lame, she draped it about her
  shoulders. They returned to the Piazza towards midnight and found it
  thronged. A great singer, Venetian-born, had announced that on that night he
  would sing to Venice, and Lois and Derek Crayle had hardly taken their places
  at one of the little tables before the triumphant voice rose, carried aloft
  upon the music of the violins, as a conqueror upon the shields of his
  warriors. Lois drew in her breath with a gasp. The spell-bound silent throng,
  the balm of the air, the moon sailing lustrously white above the domes of St.
  Mark's, and the lovely voice rising and falling and beating against the walls
  of a square itself so beautiful that it seemed made of the texture of a
  dream, swept Lois away into a silent and unearthly ecstasy. Yet all the while
  there was a whisper at her heart.</p>

  <p>"This is the perfect night. You will never know such another. You are only
  vouchsafed this night so that the memory of it may embitter all your days to
  come. You will never come here again."</p>

  <p>As the singer's voice mingled with a woman's in the final duet of "Ada,"
  the whisper grew louder and louder in Lois' hearing. Derek Crayle saw her
  lean back in her chair, her face upturned, her slim white throat bared; and
  for a moment he believed her to have been seized by some intolerable
  distress. She shook her head, however, when he moved towards her, and when
  the song was over and the throng moving from the square she seemed to have
  recovered her high spirits.</p>

  <p>"I was thinking that..." she began, and broke off. "But it was nonsense. I
  shall come back here. I shall bring my mother here." The voice dropped, she
  gazed about her, drawing a deep breath. Then she bade him good night and
  good-bye with an admirable composure.</p>

  <p>Lois left for London on the next morning by the Simplon Express. She
  allowed herself the costliness of that train in the confidence that she would
  find work to her hand. But to her surprise and indignation she found herself
  answering advertisements and tramping round the agencies in vain. There were
  no domestic servants, but the world was full of accomplished young
  secretaries with nothing to do, whilst well-meaning ladies of title were busy
  collecting money to train yet more young women to crowd the already
  over-crowded.</p>

  <p>Lois was here and there offered work at a starvation wage. She obtained
  one engagement at a salary of four pounds a week from an employer who
  required for that remuneration a secretary plus a mistress. Lois departed.
  She then became accountant and book-keeper to an over-hopeful film company.
  After the liquidation of that concern she sold dresses for a few months, or
  rather tried to sell dresses, in one of the little wooden huts which stood in
  the Strand on the site of what is now Bush House; and since she worked
  chiefly upon a commission, both her savings and with them her cherished dream
  faded and grew thin.</p>

  <p>And after that unlucky venture the blank days followed. The crasher, in
  fact, had crashed. She was living in a bed-sitting-room at the back of
  Fitzroy Square, eating meagrely, nursing what was left of her savings, and
  conscious that both her courage and her vitality were dwindling in the heat
  of an exotic summer. There came upon her an overwhelming desire to see again
  her adored mother and herself learn, if by any means she could, something of
  that mother's proud acquiescence. Long ago she had said to herself, when she
  had turned her back on Glebe Villa:</p>

  <p>"I will never go into that house again."</p>

  <p>But in the ruin of her plans the resolve weakened and died. She wrote to
  her mother:</p>

  <p>"I am coming to see you, darling," and, though she strove to hide it, the
  bitterness of her disappointment pierced through the careful phrases and
  wrung her mother's heart.</p>

  <p>Mona sat with the letter upon her knee, looking out upon Acacia Grove, her
  eyes quite blinded with tears. She too had resolved that Lois should never
  return. She was more than ever resolved now. For life in Glebe Villa had gone
  from worse to worse. Quarrels were more frequent, if that could be called a
  quarrel which was a long upbraiding upon one side and a persistent silence
  upon the other; the morose drinker drank deeper; expenses were higher and
  less money was earned.</p>

  <p>"My dear, my dear, I can't let you come here," Mona cried aloud. She gave
  way for a moment to a despairing impression that they were a doomed family.
  Then she argued:</p>

  <p>"It's only because I am stubborn...If I could force myself to be willing
  never to see Lois again, except for some rare moments, surely I could force
  myself, too, to extinguish this last little spark of pride...After all, I
  don't matter now...my darling does."</p>

  <p>She rose up in a bitter spirit. A possibility often pondered, as often
  rejected, and yet always resurgent, was now accepted and to be made definite
  fact. A long debate was at an end; a long and doubtful struggle closed. Mona
  was actually relieved. She put on her hat and sent a telegram to Lois:</p>

  <p><i>Don't come. I shall join you for a few days tomorrow.</i></p>

  <p>She sent this telegram on a morning of the first week of July.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash;THE GREAT EXPERIMENT</h2>

  <p class="first">In June of that year Derek Crayle crossed over from Gissens
  and lodged at Upper Theign. A Mr. Arthur Hoyle, a sharp-visaged, alert little
  cloth manufacturer from Bradford, was also a visitor, and an atmosphere of
  subdued excitement pervaded the house. The most impervious of persons could
  not pass along the corridors without feeling a curious tingle of expectation.
  Some great affair was in the balance. The time was weighty; and Derek, in
  spite of the pellucid air and the cool cradle-song of running water, slept no
  less fitfully than Lois in the parching heat of Fitzroy Square.</p>

  <p>In the early hours of one of these mornings he rose from his bed and
  looked eastwards out of his window. It was still dark. Nightingales and sweet
  perfumes had the wide park to themselves except at one point. Three hundred
  yards away, at the edge of a cluster of elms, a bright light struck upwards
  from a big window in a roof and gave to the leaves which over-canopied it the
  burnished luxuriance of the foliage of Ceylon. Derek Crayle watched that
  lonely illumination with anxiety.</p>

  <p>"It won't do!" he said to himself. "It's high time that I mounted the
  bridge and put a stop to the nonsense."</p>

  <p>He slipped a pair of flannel trousers and a thick jacket over his pyjamas,
  twisted a long scarf round his throat, drew on his high rubber boots and,
  passing along a passage, knocked upon a door.</p>

  <p>"Olivia!" he called in a low voice. "Olivia!" The answer was returned at
  once.</p>

  <p>"Come in, Derek."</p>

  <p>He went into the big bedroom. All the windows were open, all the blinds
  raised. Olivia was wide awake with a lamp burning by her bedside and an open
  book upon the coverlet. She was leaning upon her elbow, her eyes watching her
  visitor with apprehension.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Derek?...Has anything happened?"</p>

  <p>"No, no," Derek Crayle reassured her. "But something's going to happen. I
  want your consent for it to happen. I want to fetch out Hoyle with his
  key."</p>

  <p>Olivia Thewliss turned her head from the two windows in the front of the
  room to the one big window on her left-hand side. From her bed she could see
  the bright glare from the skylight gilding the green boughs above it. She did
  not answer.</p>

  <p>"This is the third night, Olivia. Three nights and days. And he's not a
  young man..."</p>

  <p>"Just for that reason, you see, Derek..." she argued doubtfully. "He won't
  want this ordeal a second time. And besides, he wants the results in his own
  time...Oh, I don't mean the money&mdash;but seeing it done
  everywhere&mdash;his work. He insisted that he shouldn't be interrupted. He
  foresaw that we might want to interrupt him."</p>

  <p>For a few moments both of them stared in silence at the steady light
  across the park.</p>

  <p>"He's putting a heavy strain upon himself," Derek continued stubbornly.
  "It's up to you, Olivia, of course, to say yes or no. But three nights and
  days! It's too long."</p>

  <p>"He had food for that length of time and for longer," Olivia contended.
  "He was prepared to spend that time."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Derek admitted. "But suppose that something happened which he
  wasn't prepared for. He's alone over there. He may have fallen and hurt
  himself. He may have fainted..."</p>

  <p>"He switched on the light yesterday when the dusk came. I don't see any
  reason to fear." She was silent again, staring through the open window across
  the darkness to the square of bright light under the coppice. "Of course,
  it's a long time...a long strain."</p>

  <p>Derek Crayle's anxiety was increasing her own. Olivia had married Mark
  Thewliss without bringing to the marriage, as she had warned him, any passion
  of love. He had wanted her help in the making of his life's completeness, her
  companionship, and she had given him both. Certainly little diffidences had
  disappeared, he had become at home in his new incarnation as a country
  gentleman. He sought her advice, too, on matters of bigger moment, and very
  often took it. There had grown up between the two a strong and solid
  affection, a little stronger perhaps on Olivia's side, because she had not
  given him that child for which as she knew he had poignantly longed.</p>

  <p>There was an element of remorse in her affection, of gratitude too. For he
  had not allowed any complaint of his to wound her. He had given her much, a
  pleasant house, the opportunities of kindness and hospitality, a constant
  consideration, a share in his plans She was no longer pinched, as Mr. Wyatt a
  few years back would have described her; she was no longer a dependent on her
  rich relatives. Great advantages all of them, and making for a comely life.
  And the one return he had wanted&mdash;she had never forgotten his revealing
  glance from herself to Angela at the luncheon table at Gissens&mdash;she had
  not made. She was all the more anxious to-night that Mark should find this
  other hope of his fulfilled.</p>

  <p>"There's a better way," she said. "We must wait till the morning, and it
  will be here very soon now. We've no reason to think that anything has
  happened to Mark. But for your fears I shouldn't be worried at all."</p>

  <p>"Oh! And the lamp burning by your bed? And the open book?" Crayle
  rejoined. "You're as nervous as I am. You know as well as I do that the
  experiment has taken too long."</p>

  <p>Olivia shook her head. She remembered the strict orders Mark Thewliss had
  given.</p>

  <p>"We'll wait until morning. If when the daylight comes the light in the
  laboratory is turned out, then we'll go on waiting. For we shall know that
  Mark has not finished and wishes to be undisturbed. But if the light still
  burns in the broad day, then we shall&mdash;-" she would not say "know." She
  caught the word back, "we shall have a right to fear that some accident may
  have happened. We shall be justified for sending for Hoyle and his key."</p>

  <p>Derek Crayle could get no other answer, though he argued a little more,
  giving her instances from the War of how a man's endurance may snap.</p>

  <p>"I won't listen to you, Derek!" she cried. "Go away and let me sleep."</p>

  <p>Derek grumbled himself out of the room.</p>

  <p>"Women! My word! Gentle, did you say? Compared with 'em, a tank's a
  sponge-cake."</p>

  <p>But Olivia sat up in her bed anxiously looking out. The black cap of the
  night was lifted a little, as though the earth-goddess wanted air and wind to
  blow through her curls. Light seeped in under the tilted rim, the pale
  invader, hung a drapery of mist to the branches of the trees, and mocked the
  dew-drenched meadows with a mimicry of winter frosts. Suddenly the grey was
  shot with lilac, and the lilac hemmed with gold, and to a great noise of
  blackbirds and thrushes and cawing rooks, a burning arc of the sun cut the
  sky. The long, low laboratory which Mark Thewliss had built for himself at
  the edge of the elms was visible now with its shuttered windows and its
  barred door. And as Olivia looked, the yellow glare in the skylight died
  away.</p>

  <p>"That just shows," she said contentedly, "I was right," and she slipped
  down into her bed and went to sleep.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Derek Crayle had crept quietly down the stairs and let himself
  out of the house. He crossed the park towards the laboratory and saw the
  spurt of a match and then the waxing and waning of tobacco in the bowl of a
  pipe. On the edge of the small gravel clearing in front of the laboratory a
  man wrapped in a weather-beaten British warm was smoking, seated on a length
  of tree-trunk.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Brent," said Derek.</p>

  <p>"Mornin', sir," replied Brent.</p>

  <p>"Nothing happened, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"Not a thing."</p>

  <p>"You'll be relieved in half an hour."</p>

  <p>"That's all right, sir. I have done sentry-go under worse conditions,"
  said Brent with a laugh.</p>

  <p>He smoked for a little while in silence. Then he resumed: "They do say
  that if this 'yer experimentation works out O.K. it'll mean a lot o'
  difference."</p>

  <p>"I should think so," returned Crayle. "It'll cheapen production&mdash;put
  pleasant things within easier reach of the public." He was remembering the
  homilies or Mark Thewliss.</p>

  <p>Brent knocked the ashes of his pipe into the palm of his hand and filled
  the bowl again.</p>

  <p>"The public. Yes," he said. "You gentlemen dandles the public and gives it
  plenty o' pap. But the public ain't the sort o' defenceless baby you thinks
  it. You just go on strike for a bit and inconvenience it. It'll learn you.
  What I was thinkin' of was us. It'll mean new machinery, very like, new
  installations."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose it will," said Crayle.</p>

  <p>"Well, there's some firms that can't afford it, see? They'll go under.
  There's Mr. Hoyle, my boss. He's a rich man but he ain't looking forward to
  the moment when Lord Thewliss throws open that door there and says, 'Make a
  statue of me. I've done it!' There's two sides to these questions, Colonel
  Crayle. And I'm incomplete there. For there's a third. I never saw a piece of
  new machinery which didn't make the workman's job just a tiny bit more
  soulless than it was before. You watch, watch, watch, watch, watch and then
  you touch a little lever. Then you watch, watch, watch, watch, watch and
  touch the little lever again. And you do it twice a minute for eight hours a
  day for forty-five years. Foolproof, no doubt, sir, but foolproof and
  soulless are two words for the same thing."</p>

  <p>Derek Crayle was disinclined to enter upon a discussion of economics at so
  unsuitably pristine an hour. He said lightly:</p>

  <p>"Brent, you are the last of the Tories."</p>

  <p>"And that leaves us just where we were before," Brent replied
  unconcernedly. "All these Utopias now, Colonel Crayle! I read about them.
  They clear your slums away, and they wash you, and they dress you in
  health-clothes, and they feed you, and they arrange your marriage and your
  children&mdash;but where's your soul? It's gone&mdash;like that!"</p>

  <p>The morning had come. Brent was pointing towards the yellow glow above the
  sunlight which just at that moment had vanished.</p>

  <p>"And there's my relief."</p>

  <p>Brent tapped the bowl of his pipe against the log, stood up and stretched
  his arms above his head. Along a narrow path from the direction of the house
  a third man was approaching. But before he reached the semicircle of gravel,
  from within the laboratory was heard a loud knocking upon the door.</p>

  <p>Derek Crayle turned back to it with a catch of his breath. Though it was
  just for this sound that he had been hoping, now that it was audible it
  startled him like a clap of thunder.</p>

  <p>"At last!" he cried, and he sent Brent off at a run to the house. He
  stepped forward to the door and shouted cheerfully through the panels:</p>

  <p>"All right, sir! A moment or two! I have sent for Hoyle and the key."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The strange imprisonment of Mark Thewliss in his own laboratory was the
  outcome of that dramatic instinct in him which secured the advertisement and
  made others shoulder the advertising. He had dined six months before in the
  company of half a dozen manufacturers of cloth and silk from the North of
  England, and had there quietly announced that it needed only the perfection
  of a detail or two before he could produce the universal formula for fadeless
  dyes for all materials. One or two of the company had scoffed at the
  pretension of the man, one or two who knew him better plied him with
  questions, one or two, with their feet cemented in old routine and fearful of
  change, were silent and uneasy.</p>

  <p>"You'll patent your discovery, of course," said Hoyle, who was one of the
  company, thrusting his keen face forward.</p>

  <p>"I haven't got as far as thinking about that yet," Mark Thewliss
  replied.</p>

  <p>The two uneasy men, Mr. Benfield and Sir James Copeland, shrugged their
  shoulders and grimaced at one another sourly. The old fox was going to keep
  his discovery to himself until he had made up his mind by which way he could
  squeeze the last penny out of it. But Hoyle kept his sharp eyes for a moment
  or two upon Mark Thewliss' face and then leaned back in his chair, apparently
  not dissatisfied.</p>

  <p>"Of course we should like to know when you are satisfied that you have the
  whole process complete," he said.</p>

  <p>"Yes. That's fair enough," Thewliss replied.</p>

  <p>"And I should like to be satisfied at the same time that the process
  isn't&mdash;well, it's better to use blunt words even at the risk of
  offence&mdash;isn't, to put it plainly, a fake," said one of the
  scoffers.</p>

  <p>He was a Mr. Wisberry from the cluster of cloth-mills in Somersetshire,
  and he was known for his pride in plain language as much as for the
  excellence of his cloth. Mark Thewliss took the affront with a smile.</p>

  <p>"I can meet you there, too. When I am ready I'll let you all know. You
  shall provide me, each of you, with a strip of material to be dyed. You shall
  choose the material. You shall choose the kind of dye. I shall have
  everything removed from my laboratory except what I want for the one process.
  You shall appoint one of you to make sure that there is nothing else there,
  that there are no pieces already dyed, and I will not know what pieces you
  are going to hand over to me to be dyed. Then, when you are satisfied I'll go
  into the laboratory with enough food and drink to last me for a day or two.
  You shall lock me in. You shall set a guard upon the building night and day,
  and when I knock on the door I shall have finished. I'll hand you over your
  strips of materials dyed as you wanted them, and you can submit them to what
  tests you like. I'll guarantee they won't fade."</p>

  <p>The challenge had been accepted, Hoyle had been selected to supervise the
  conditions under which the experiment was to be made; and now in this first
  week of June, six months afterwards, it had been made.</p>

  <p>Hoyle had a very vivid recollection of that dinner party in a private room
  of the hotel at Leeds, as he slipped into his clothes and hurried across the
  park. His face wore a grave look of concern. Had Mark Thewliss failed? Had he
  succeeded? If the latter there would be a vast upset in this particular
  industry. One universal formula! Applicable to all fabrics and all dyes! It
  was gigantic in its conception&mdash;still more gigantic in its consequence.
  It would lead to mass production first of all&mdash;mass production on a
  scale quite unknown. There would have to be immense amalgamations. The little
  special divisions of the industry would be brought together under one roof.
  They would lose their identity. The men who ran them would go under. He
  himself, for all he knew, might be in danger. And sprawling over the top of
  them all, the black Genie from the bottle, Mark Thewliss&mdash;damn
  him!&mdash;yes, Mark Thewliss unless&mdash;yes, by the way, unless...Hoyle
  had had a glimmering notion of a counter-stroke so far back as that dinner
  party.</p>

  <p>"I mustn't forget that," he said to himself, and thereupon ceased to
  hurry.</p>

  <p>There was no need to hurry. He had the key of the laboratory in his
  pocket. The door couldn't be opened until he reached it. He must be on the
  alert with all his wits about him when it was opened. Thewliss was a queer
  card in some ways. A good deal might be learnt by a man who had eyes
  wherewith to see&mdash;a good deal which might be very useful. Mr. Hoyle
  brought a genial and unruffled countenance to the small group before the
  door.</p>

  <p>"So the great experiment is completed," he said. "Now for the
  demonstration," and setting the key in the lock he turned it.</p>

  <p>The door swung inwards on its hinges and the four men looked into a small
  dark vestibule. For a moment their eyes, accustomed to the daylight, could
  distinguish nothing in the gloom of the little shuttered hall. Then they saw
  that it was empty. But an inner door opened at the side upon the big
  laboratory, and as they stood upon the threshold they heard a slow and
  dragging step begin and grow louder.</p>

  <p>"What an actor the fellow is!" was Hoyle's first admiring thought.</p>

  <p>But he dismissed it as Thewliss came into view. For there was no
  affectation of fatigue in Thewliss' bearing. He was white and drawn and
  utterly dispirited. He came forward with the merest ghost of a smile which
  suited well his ghostly face, and he leaned against the pillar of the door
  with the indifference men show when reaction from some great strain has
  turned the whole living world into a fantasy.</p>

  <p>"By God!...he has failed," said Derek Crayle under his breath.</p>

  <p>In a silence so complete he was heard by everyone, even by Mark Thewliss,
  who turned his eyes towards him. But there was no reproach in them and no
  denial. They were the eyes of a man coming out of a coma, mystifying,
  expressionless. In a moment or two he spoke:</p>

  <p>"I am very tired," and as though the sound of his own voice had roused him
  to consciousness, he nodded to Hoyle. "You'll find everything in there," he
  said, with a jerk of his head towards the laboratory behind him.</p>

  <p>"You are satisfied then?" Hoyle asked quietly, and his lips set in a
  straight, rather grim line.</p>

  <p>"Quite! You can take away all the exhibits and test them as you like. We
  are at the beginning of June. You have four months of sunlight. In October
  I'll ask you to agree with me."</p>

  <p>Thewliss moved away from the door. The movement was stiff and heavy. There
  was no spring in his step. He plodded disconsolately towards the house. On
  the other hand Hoyle sprang forward the instant the doorway was clear, and
  vanished into the laboratory.</p>

  <p>"Quick, eh?" said Brent appreciatively. If any clue to Mark's process had
  been left intelligible to a shrewd mind, the secret would assuredly not
  remain a secret long. Derek Crayle followed close upon Hoyle; and drew a
  breath of relief. Hoyle was standing in the centre of the great room, darting
  his eyes now into this corner now into that, and murmuring to himself:</p>

  <p>"Ah! The old fox! Might ha' been spring-cleaned! The old foxy one."</p>

  <p>Indeed, the great room looked ready for use rather than quitted after use.
  But for some utterly charred fragments of paper in the grate and a row of
  dyed strips of material pegged against a wall, there was no indication of the
  three nights and days during which Thewliss had worked there. The retorts,
  the Savalle columns, the dephlegmators stood in their accustomed places. Here
  was an iron vessel with its stirring gear; there another with a leaden
  cooling worm. A furnace and boiler, a reflux condenser, an earthenware
  apparatus for chlorination&mdash;all the paraphernalia of a perfectly
  equipped laboratory stood clean and orderly. In a corner by one of the
  shuttered windows a writing-table was placed with ink and writing-pad, pens
  and blotting paper upon it and a comfortable chair with arms in front of it.
  Hoyle ran to it and, flinging open the shutters of the window, held the pad
  to the light. There might have been the indentations of a pen or pencil
  writing figures and calculations on an upper sheet now removed. There was not
  a mark. If Thewliss had written upon one sheet, he had taken the precaution
  to tear off a good many others with it. Hoyle looked up and saw Derek Crayle
  watching his every movement.</p>

  <p>"Good work, what?" he said with a laugh which had neither joy nor
  sincerity in it. "Tired, too, wasn't he? But not too tired to do the
  housemaid's work before he went home to bed."</p>

  <p>Derek left Mr. Hoyle to pack up the exhibits and went back to the house.
  He was considerably puzzled by Mark's demeanour. That was not the way
  triumphant men behaved, however tired they might be; and certainly Mark had
  no doubt that he had triumphed. Derek felt that he must really look into
  this. The old boy might be sickening of a disease. When Derek reached the
  house, however, Mark had retired to his bath-room; and from his bath-room he
  retired to his bed and made no further appearance until dinner-time.</p>

  <p>Even then he was more than ordinarily quiet and silent, though Olivia
  somehow seemed to understand him and to be sympathetic rather than disturbed.
  Hoyle had gone off to Bradford with his foremen and his samples, and there
  were only the three of them left. Derek waited until the port was set upon
  the table and then his curiosity broke through.</p>

  <p>"I didn't understand you this morning, sir," he said. "You seemed to be
  sorry that you had brought it off."</p>

  <p>Mark Thewliss smiled.</p>

  <p>"Well, in a way...to a degree, I was. I'm not quite sure that I'm not
  sorry now. You see, Derek, I have lived with this particular dream for the
  best part of thirty years. Whenever I've had a free moment, I've given it to
  it. I've been like a dog with a bone too big for him to crack. He buries it
  and the next day scratches it up and has another try and then buries it
  again; and he finds life very interesting. Well, do you see, I've cracked my
  bone, and for the moment I'm finding life pretty empty."</p>

  <p>Olivia dropped her eyes and then reaching out her hand took her husband's,
  shook it affectionately and dropped it again.</p>

  <p>"But you've got all the fun of marketing the thing to come," Derek
  expostulated. "You've got all the fun of seeing it at work, of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know," Mark interrupted, and he turned with a smile to his wife. "I
  delivered a long lecture to you on that very subject, didn't I, Olivia, the
  day we first came over to look at this house? The invention was to do this
  and that. Make people happier, establish peace more surely by putting colour
  more easily within everybody's reach, and the rest of it." He spoke quizzing
  himself and his earlier ambitions. "Yes, I ought to be blown out like a
  balloon over it. But as a matter of fact I feel that I have lost more than I
  have gained. I've come to the end of a big, perhaps a foolishly big dream,
  and "&mdash;he suddenly stretched out his arms on either side of him in a
  gesture very near to despair&mdash;"I've got nothing in the world to take its
  place."</p>

  <p>The poignant desolation, suddenly revealed in a man publicly so
  unemotional and publicly a very emblem of success, shocked Derek Crayle. He
  sat in an uncomfortable silence. With an almost violent movement, Mark tore
  from the breast-pocket of his dinner jacket six small sheets of a strong,
  greyish-blue notepaper and tossed them across the table.</p>

  <p>"There's the formula, Derek, every stage of it. Not quite the half-sheet
  of note-paper, but not so far from it."</p>

  <p>Derek took up the pages. They were covered on both sides with
  hieroglyphics and diamond-shaped figures and capital letters with tiny
  numbers against them and little sums in multiplication and addition; so that
  Derek's head began to turn.</p>

  <p>"I can't make head nor tail of it," he said.</p>

  <p>"You aren't meant to, Derek."</p>

  <p>Crayle turned the sheets over and over.</p>

  <p>"Do you carry all this in your head?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"A good deal of it. Some of it I expect I should have to work out again if
  I lost those papers."</p>

  <p>"Of course this is what Hoyle was looking for," Derek continued, "or some
  part of it." He looked suddenly at Mark Thewliss. "Could Hoyle understand all
  this?"</p>

  <p>"No, but he employs a chemist. The chemist could."</p>

  <p>"Then you want to put this away in a very safe place," said Derek Crayle
  emphatically.</p>

  <p>Mark Thewliss laughed, and this time really laughed.</p>

  <p>"You misjudge Hoyle. He's not really a bad fellow."</p>

  <p>"Oh," said Derek dryly. "Well, some day I shall have to tell you the story
  of the curate's egg."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but I'll choose the day," Mark rejoined in alarm.</p>

  <p>He stretched out his hand across the table and took the six sheets again
  into his keeping.</p>

  <p>"I am not disposed to let Hoyle and the rest of them down over this," he
  said. "It'll mean scrapping a bit of machinery no doubt, and installing
  something new. But we might work an amalgamation on the big scale." He sat
  and fingered the papers for a little while, conning them over and again over.
  "However, there's no hurry. We have four months to think our plans over."</p>

  <p>"And meanwhile you'll keep that formula safe and secret," Derek urged
  earnestly.</p>

  <p>Mark turned towards his wife.</p>

  <p>"My dear, I think Derek takes me for a damnder fool than I am. Shall we
  move?"</p>

  <p>Olivia Thewliss took Derek Crayle with her into the drawing-room. Mark
  Thewliss went away into his library and remained there. After an hour had
  passed Olivia began to look disturbed.</p>

  <p>"What in the world can he be doing?" she said.</p>

  <p>"I'll go and see," replied Derek, jumping up.</p>

  <p>But Olivia held him back.</p>

  <p>"No! Give him a little more time!"</p>

  <p>At the end of another half-hour she gave in.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I would like you to see."</p>

  <p>Derek Crayle hurried across the hall and tried a door. It was locked on
  the inside. He stood for a moment or two gravely troubled. Mark Thewliss had
  shown himself that evening possessed by a curiously disturbing and unfamiliar
  mood. Had the reaction following upon so violent a demand on his vigour
  thrown him off his balance? Derek turned back into the hall and, opening the
  front door, crept round to the library windows. The blinds were lowered, but
  the room behind the blinds blazed with light. Crayle examined the windows. He
  could not see an inch of the room, so completely the blinds covered the
  panes. He went back into the drawing-room.</p>

  <p>"Well?" said Olivia.</p>

  <p>There was actually fear in her eyes and in the upward intonation of her
  voice.</p>

  <p>"The door's locked. The blinds are drawn down. I could see nothing. I
  could hear nothing."</p>

  <p>"Listen!"</p>

  <p>The command came sharply. They stood straining their ears to hear, both of
  them upon the very edge of panic. And then a key grated in a lock, and with a
  little sob of relief Olivia dropped back into her chair as though her knees
  had given under her.</p>

  <p>They heard Mark's step in the hall. Mark pushed open the door and stood
  smiling. The moment heavy with tragedy had passed.</p>

  <p>"I've put the formula away where not even Hoyle could find it," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"Yes! I know!" Derek Crayle grumbled. "In the secret drawer in your
  bureau."</p>

  <p>Mark lit a cigar and sat down, now quite at his ease.</p>

  <p>"So you knew about that secret drawer, did you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I and everybody else in the house. You keep your postage stamps in
  it, don't you?"</p>

  <p>Mark Thewliss laughed aloud.</p>

  <p>"I did. But I'm keeping the formula there now. And if anyone in the house
  opens it for Hoyle's benefit, why Hoyle is welcome to all that he can make
  out of it."</p>

  <p>Derek, however, was not satisfied.</p>

  <p>"Sometimes the best of servants can be bribed. You never know. I don't
  trust Hoyle. If he could get hold of that formula and destroy it, he
  would."</p>

  <p>Mark did not answer for a moment. But he was quite unmoved by any fear of
  what Hoyle might or might not do in any contingency.</p>

  <p>"Derek," he said, "you must ask Olivia about me. She'll tell you that
  however much of a fool I may seem to be, I generally have something up my
  sleeve."</p>

  <p>Olivia rose from her chair.</p>

  <p>"We will renew this discussion to-morrow as we are going down Southampton
  Water," she said.</p>

  <p>"What in the world do you mean?" cried Mark; and suddenly something of his
  alert youth shone again in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I mean that while you have been fussing about your experiments and your
  formulas, and wearing yourself to skin and bones," she said, "I have taken it
  upon myself to have the schooner put into commission. It's at its mooring
  now."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17"></a>XVII. &mdash;STARTLING NEWS</h2>

  <p class="first">For six weeks the schooner cruised. She sailed westwards to
  the Scillies; her white sails gleamed like silver amongst the Hebrides. She
  turned south and anchored in the harbours of Brittany. It was a pleasant
  unadventurous voyage over smooth seas in sunlit weather, and a brown and
  reinvigorated Mark Thewliss returned to Upper Theign. On the morning after
  his arrival, he read through a letter and with a grimace tossed it across the
  breakfast table to his wife.</p>

  <p>"A lecture from Gregory, my dear. The old man's coming down this morning
  full of reproaches. We must send the Rolls to the station for him, give him
  the best lunch we can with a glass of the '96 port, and moderate the
  thunderbolts."</p>

  <p>It was the same Mr. Gregory who had jumped off his stool in the office
  many years ago to open the door for the future partner of Mardyke and
  Campion. But the stooping mind was now matched by the stooping body, and what
  was left of his hair was white. He brought with him documents to be signed
  and letters to be considered.</p>

  <p>"The ordinary correspondence I have dealt with myself, my lord, as general
  manager. But you will find that there are a good many matters here which
  really needed a decision a few weeks ago."</p>

  <p>"Quite so, Gregory."</p>

  <p>For an hour the two men worked busily in the great library overlooking the
  lawn and the river.</p>

  <p>"You'll stay for luncheon, Gregory," said Mark, rising quickly.
  "Meanwhile&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Your lordship is very kind, and meanwhile perhaps for a few minutes I may
  speak my mind," said Mr. Gregory.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said Mark with resignation. He knew the sort of wigging he
  was going to get from the old servant of the firm. He had vainly hoped to
  stave it off until after luncheon.</p>

  <p>"Fire away, Gregory."</p>

  <p>It was an old story, said Mr. Gregory, but with the recent expansion of
  their industry it had even greater force. Since old Mr. Mardyke had gone the
  work was too much for one man, and after all his lordship was no longer so
  young as he had been.</p>

  <p>"Well, I have offered you a partnership half a dozen times, Gregory. Why
  don't you take it and stop bullying me?" Mark asked testily.</p>

  <p>Gregory shook his head stubbornly.</p>

  <p>"I am a born servant, my lord. I can manage a machine, I can't create one.
  I can develop a policy, I can't originate one. I have neither the courage nor
  the imagination. There are only a few things, my lord, in which all men can
  be equal; and one of them is the dignity which comes from knowing clearly to
  what one can't aspire."</p>

  <p>No doctrine could be imagined with which a man of Mark Thewliss' temper
  was less in sympathy. He never heard it without a distaste which it needed
  all his knowledge of Gregory's long and devoted service to overpower.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said. "We must go on as we are."</p>

  <p>"That's not necessary, my lord," Gregory urged. "For you have a born
  master at your elbow."</p>

  <p>Mark looked up and stared.</p>

  <p>"Who?"</p>

  <p>"Colonel Crayle."</p>

  <p>Mark's first thought was to cry out "He? Why I have known him all my life.
  Nonsense!" quite in the spirit of an old fogy.</p>

  <p>But he caught himself up. Derek Crayle? Under thirty&mdash;well, all the
  better for that. And he had commanded four thousand men, had risen to the
  command of them. As it was, Derek half the time made his home with himself
  and Olivia. He already knew a good deal of Mark's affairs.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's a good idea, Gregory. I don't know what Colonel Crayle's
  point of view may be. There won't be much opportunity for him in the army for
  a long time, if ever. I should certainly like him as a partner."</p>

  <p>"I was thinking of him less as a partner," Gregory suggested, "than as a
  director of the Board."</p>

  <p>Mark Thewliss looked at Gregory with interest.</p>

  <p>"You, too, think that we ought to become a company? I have been turning
  that question over in my mind for some time past. We are reaching out pretty
  far as it is, and next year I think we shall reach out a great deal farther
  still. Too much perhaps for one man. Yes! A limited liability company with
  myself as chairman and Derek on the Board, getting ready to follow me? Yes!
  Colonel Crayle may be at Gissens. I'll get him over and have a talk to
  him."</p>

  <p>Derek Crayle was amusing himself amongst the pretty people at Deauville,
  but he turned his back on them when he received a letter from Mark and came
  straight to Upper Theign.</p>

  <p>"I should like to join you," he said. "I have been hoping ever since the
  war ended that you would find room for me."</p>

  <p>"Then if you can manage it, we'll go up to London to-morrow and push the
  business through."</p>

  <p>Three busy weeks followed. There were meetings at the offices of Hawker,
  Hawker and Lyndhurst, arrangements were made with the heirs of Campion and
  the heirs of Mardyke. The staff at Brooke's Market was assembled. Derek
  Crayle was introduced formally, the proposal for the formation of a company
  in which all the employees should be shareholders was explained and accepted.
  There was for the moment to be no offer of shares to the public, but it was
  more than probable that the expansion of their business would in the autumn
  render that course advisable. Early in August the new company was registered,
  and Mark and Derek Crayle returned to Upper Theign. A family dinner party
  took place that night. Angela, who had been married then five years to young
  Lord Ilsenham of the Foreign Office, came over from Gissens with her husband
  and Tony Westram. Mark sat at the head of his table, the genial hero and
  benefactor. Everyone was in the highest spirits. Tony Westram was
  outspoken.</p>

  <p>"Here's your health, Mark. I wish I had some of this port in my cellar. By
  Gad, I did a good stroke of work for my decadent old family when I asked the
  rising M.P. to Gissens."</p>

  <p>"All very well for you to say that, my father," said Angela. "My
  recollections are a sheer humiliation to me. I did all that a properly
  brought up maiden could do, and he just looked at Olivia. I taught him to
  fish&mdash;yes, I gave up a whole day to it, and he looked upon me as a
  daughter."</p>

  <p>Perhaps Olivia flinched for a second at this point. But to her, too, the
  evening was one of pride. There was a scar no doubt still upon her heart.
  There was a graveyard at Pietermaritzburg which she had never seen, never
  would see, and had now learnt not to imagine. On the whole, she had more than
  the happiness which fell to most of the women she knew in the daily ran of
  their lives. They missed one thing of course, both of them, Mark and herself,
  the dream-daughter with the starry eyes. But to-night in the warmth of this
  intimate gathering that aching want was, except for the moment of Angela's
  untimely sally, lulled into oblivion. The party broke up at midnight in a
  boisterous good-humour.</p>

  <p>"By Gad, Mark, this is the best evening I've ever had," cried Tony from
  the motor-car, and, "Don't cry, Uncle," said Derek. "There's still some of
  the port left."</p>

  <p>And so the evening ended. But on the next morning a visitor came to Upper
  Theign who thrust so vital a disturbance into the lives of the people of this
  history that the dinner party was never followed by one like to it, and even
  the remodeling of the firm of Mardyke and Campion to suit the conditions of
  to-day, became to them a matter of no significance.</p>

  <p>It was twelve o'clock. Mark Thewliss was in his library, taking his ease
  over a copy of the day's Times, with a Cabanas Corona cigar to assist him;
  and a card was brought in to him.</p>

  <p>"I can see no one. I am busy," said Mark to his butler.</p>

  <p>Renson the butler stopped. He had a salver in his hand and the card upon
  the salver.</p>

  <p>"It is a lady, my lord."</p>

  <p>"She is collecting money for an orphanage."</p>

  <p>"I think not, my lord," said Renson. He appeared to be firm and Mark
  testily gave way.</p>

  <p>"Oh, very well I Let me see the card!"</p>

  <p>It was Renson the butler, therefore, who was the immediate cause of all
  that was to happen. Had he not been moved by some obscure perception that
  this visitor deserved to be seen, he would have retired with his salver and
  announced that his lordship was too immersed in his affairs to see anyone.
  And had he acted thus, certainly the visitor would have gone away with a head
  held high and death itself at her heart; and never would she have returned.
  But as it was Renson advanced with the salver and Mark Thewliss read the
  card, and was so startled that he sat for a moment or two like a man
  paralysed. Then he said:</p>

  <p>"Of course, I'll see the lady. Thank you, Renson." He gave his butler a
  nod of acknowledgment for his insistence.</p>

  <p>"Very well, my lord."</p>

  <p>But before Renson had reached the door, Mark stopped him.</p>

  <p>"I want five minutes, Renson. Will you show the lady into the
  morning-room, and be careful to tell her that I am asking her to wait so that
  I may hold myself completely at her disposal. When I ring, you'll show her
  in."</p>

  <p>"Very well, my lord."</p>

  <p>Had Renson been a butler of another calibre, he would have said to himself
  cunningly, "Hallo-o-o!" lengthening out the last syllable on a rising
  inflection into an innuendo of illimitable suggestion. But he did not belong
  to that school. He had induced his lordship to be reasonable and he was
  satisfied.</p>

  <p>Mark, left to himself, did not quite understand why his instinct had
  clamoured for those five minutes delay. Some strong need certainly had
  brought Mona Perriton, after twenty-five years of silence, to his door. Mona
  was in a difficulty and a difficulty of very recent date. For Mr. Wyatt's
  latest report was only two months old and it contained nothing which was
  either new or alarming. But Mark was under no apprehension. It was a
  difficulty, obviously, which he could help to dissolve and he was very glad
  that Mona had turned to him. It was just some vague nervousness which had
  made him claim this interval of a few minutes, a medley of half a hundred
  unformulated questions in his mind.</p>

  <p>What was Mona like after these twenty-five years? Was there anything left
  of the nimble high-spirited girl with the moments of real loveliness who had
  decorated the <i>Sea Flower</i> on that cutter's memorable cruise? With what
  a countenance and with what words would he greet her? Ghosts were always
  disconcerting. He crushed the end of his cigar in his ash tray as though he
  were receiving a stranger instead of one in whose company for a month he had
  smoked a pipe. Then he rang the bell and waited, his heart beating
  unreasonably fast. But as the door opened his nervousness left him.</p>

  <p>"How do you do, Mona?"</p>

  <p>"Very well. And you, Mark?"</p>

  <p>"Fine;" and they shook hands.</p>

  <p>It had not been so difficult a business after all. Mona had changed of
  course, as no doubt he himself had done. Twenty-five years must leave their
  fingermarks on forehead and cheek and round the eyes and the mouth. The
  bloom, too, flits to younger faces. And fatigue comes&mdash;yes, perhaps more
  than a due share of it. But the thick copper-coloured hair had not thinned
  nor faded, the eyes had lost none of their mystery, the voice none of its
  melody.</p>

  <p>"Come and sit down here!"</p>

  <p>He pulled up a chair for her.</p>

  <p>"I was afraid that you wouldn't know who I was," Mona said as she sat
  down.</p>

  <p>"I knew very well," Thewliss returned. "At least I guessed it without any
  difficulty."</p>

  <p>It would never do, he realised, to let Mona suspect that he had kept a
  watch upon her. Her pride would be up in arms in a second, demanding that the
  watch should cease.</p>

  <p>"You had mentioned to me that a man called Perriton was your employer, so
  when your card was brought in I hadn't much doubt," he explained.</p>

  <p>"No," she answered.</p>

  <p>She could not remember that she had ever mentioned Henry Perriton's name
  to Mark, but she might have certainly, she reflected. At the lily pond in
  Staple Inn, or on any of a hundred occasions between Poole and the final
  anchorage in Southampton Water.</p>

  <p>"I know something else about you, too, Mona," he said laughing, and yet
  with a note of envy in his voice.</p>

  <p>Mona was too disturbed by his words to apprehend the accent which informed
  them.</p>

  <p>"What do you know, Mark?" she asked, sitting up very straight.</p>

  <p>"That you have what I'd give the world to have, my dear. A perfectly
  crashing daughter."</p>

  <p>The blood rushed into Mona's face, and her eyes shone and her mouth
  laughed. She had dreaded some allusion to her poverty and the unhappiness of
  her home, and she was sitting ready to deny every word of it. But the one
  thing of which he knew was the one glory of her life.</p>

  <p>"Isn't she a darling?" she cried, and stopped in surprise. "How do you
  know anything about Lois, Mark?"</p>

  <p>"When I once went to see the Director of Naval Intelligence at the
  Admiralty during the war, Lois guided my failing limbs to his room, clearly
  under the impression that I was a nonagenerian who might decay before her
  eyes unless she was very quick and helpful. I recognised her by her likeness
  to you, before I heard her name."</p>

  <p>"Thank you!" said Mona. "For she is lovely, isn't she?"</p>

  <p>It wasn't a compliment to herself that she was asking for, but admiration
  for the adorable daughter, from a man who must have seen all the flower of
  young beauty decked out in its most exquisite attire.</p>

  <p>"There's only one word for her," said Mark firmly. "She's a crasher."</p>

  <p>"And very good at her work," the mother insisted.</p>

  <p>"She couldn't have held the position in which I found her for five
  minutes, if she hadn't been," Thewliss agreed.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Mona gratefully. "You have made it very easy for me. If
  I had had to describe Lois to you and persuade you how clever she is, you
  would have thought 'That's the mother talking. I'll have to write off half of
  what she says.' As it is you know that I have been speaking the truth. And
  it's because of Lois that I have come to see you."</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>Mona had come now to the point where she must choose her words.</p>

  <p>"You must know," she began, making the little speech which she had during
  the last two days so often rehearsed, "that although we"&mdash;she could not
  bring herself even at this moment to say Henry and I&mdash;"have a great deal
  to be thankful for and contented with, we aren't terribly well-off. We get
  along all right, but we can't save very much and Lois has to work. Even if
  there were no actual need for her to do so, I am sure that her independence
  would make her insist upon working. Besides, she enjoys it."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mark.</p>

  <p>"Well, I want her to have her opportunity," and that word broke the
  barrier of Mona's reticence.</p>

  <p>She became eloquent as one charged with a mission. She pleaded with the
  passion which brings the right word to the lips and the compelling magic to
  the voice.</p>

  <p>"I can't endure to think that she shall have to live out a whole long,
  dull, insignificant life in some drab town, her youth ebbing away in a mean
  struggle to make a halfpenny go as far as a penny. And she's a glorious girl,
  Mark. For her to lose the spring out of her walk, the light out of her eyes,
  all her radiance&mdash;to become toneless before her youth has half gone! No,
  it would be a shame, a waste&mdash;really a waste of something precious. I
  want her while she works&mdash;and she won't spare herself&mdash;to enjoy a
  wider life than we can help her to, to feel a little more of the grace of it,
  to know a little more of the exquisite dainty side of it than we can show to
  her. And she'll be at home too on that side. She found her own way there
  without our help during the war. She made charming friends for herself. She
  had a salary which enabled her to live daintily&mdash;for she's an excellent
  manager&mdash;but when the war ended, her good days ended too. Does it sound
  brutal and heartless to say that? But it's true of thousands of people, my
  girl amongst them. Since then she's been getting a precarious job every now
  and then and breaking her heart between whiles. So I have come to you, Mark.
  Can you do something?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Mark.</p>

  <p>"You are sure? It'll have to be something real&mdash;with
  responsibility."</p>

  <p>Mark nodded his head.</p>

  <p>"I understand that."</p>

  <p>He rose and, opening a silver cedar-lined box, offered a cigarette to
  Mona.</p>

  <p>"Smoke one and I'll smoke another," he said and as he lit the two
  cigarettes: "I am grateful that you came to me, Mona. And you came just at
  the right moment. We are expanding tremendously. I want help. Just give me a
  moment. There's so much choice that selection's actually difficult."</p>

  <p>He exaggerated the truth no doubt, but he understood that Mona could not
  have brought herself to the point of asking help from him without a heavy
  pain of humiliation. And if she could be persuaded that she was actually
  doing a service the humiliation would be forgotten. He took a turn across the
  room, he stood by the big glass door opening on to the garden, he was
  apparently selecting. In fact he was considering how much time ought
  reasonably to elapse before he could turn round and say with a cry, "I have
  it!" For he had made his selection even while Mona was speaking. He swung the
  glass door backwards and forwards. "I think that'll do," he said to himself,
  and without considering what he was doing he shut the glass door and turned
  the handle.</p>

  <p>"I know," he said, turning back into the room. "Listen to me, Mona! I have
  always been in trouble about a private secretary. I can't bear men, because I
  always think that a man ought to be busy doing something on his own. I have
  tried men and I can't get over a feeling of disdain for them, and with that
  inevitably, of course, a want of confidence. For women, however, it seems to
  me almost ideal work. They identify themselves with your interests as men
  don't do and oughtn't to do; they take your affairs over in a general way.
  When you're likely to go off at the deep end they manage somehow to stop you
  on the very edge of the spring board, and they like responsibility. I once
  had a really good one, but she got married of course, which was all in order.
  Well, I think the best thing your daughter could do is to come to me in that
  capacity. She'll have her own rooms in my house in London, where she can do
  her work and have her friends. She'll have her room here. She'll be one of
  the family and yet quite independent of it when she chooses. What do you
  say?"</p>

  <p>"Mark!" Mona returned. "Do you mean that? It sounds to me wonderful! But
  you are taking her on trust."</p>

  <p>"Not a bit of it, Mona. She's your daughter&mdash;that's one thing. And I
  know her history at the Admiralty&mdash;that's another."</p>

  <p>He mentioned the salary he was prepared to pay. He made it definitely
  high, but not too high.</p>

  <p>"It will be three hundred and fifty pounds a year besides the living and
  travelling expenses. And I promise you, Mona," he added with a smile, "that
  she shall see that pleasanter side of life you want for her. Now when can I
  see her?"</p>

  <p>"She's here."</p>

  <p>"Here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. We came together from London. I left her in the taxi whilst I came
  in to see you. She said that she would wander about the park if I was
  long."</p>

  <p>"We'll send for her," said Mark, getting up and going towards the
  bell.</p>

  <p>"No," Mona answered. "I'll find her myself and tell her the good
  news."</p>

  <p>She rose from her chair. The dreaded interview was over. Her Lois was set
  free from tie squalors of Glebe Villa and from the dreary soul-murdering
  tramp for work. She would have her chance now. She would move in a more
  delicate world amongst gardens and flowers. She would have companions and
  games and good health, and the pride of her independence. That Mona herself
  would lose her daughter she was well aware, but the sense of loss was all
  swallowed up in her joy in Lois' prosperity.</p>

  <p>"I hadn't expected anything half so wonderful, Mark," she said with a warm
  gratitude.</p>

  <p>"It's I who am going to benefit," he returned. "Look at my table!"</p>

  <p>A great mahogany writing-table stood in the centre of the big room. It was
  made for use by two people. There was a knee-hole and two pedestals of
  drawers on either side. Two arm-chairs and two writing-pads faced one another
  across the leather top. But the table to-day was in a sad litter with papers
  and letters, prospectuses and envelopes.</p>

  <p>"Gregory&mdash;that's my manager in London&mdash;hasn't the high opinion
  of me that I have of myself," he said ruefully, "and when I look at my table
  I wonder whether he's right. Miss Perriton will have to put it right."</p>

  <p>"Oh, she'll soon do that "&mdash;Mona began and suddenly broke off.</p>

  <p>Mark Thewliss had made two mistakes that morning. The first; when he had
  unwittingly closed and turned the knob of the French window in his study; the
  second, when to demonstrate his acute need of a secretary he pointed to the
  litter of papers on his table. Had he been content not to embroider an
  arrangement already made, Mona Perriton would have hurried off into the park,
  and the duologue would then and there have ended. As it was Mona's eyes were
  attracted to the table and she saw it, holding down some papers as a weight
  and half hidden by others&mdash;the mallet. Mona recognised it by the big
  capital M burnt into the flat side, and being herself a little over-strung by
  the immediate success of her plan, she blurted out:</p>

  <p>"So you have kept it, Mark," and the recollection of her one dream-like
  holiday came back to her on a golden tide; so that the blood rushed into her
  face, her eyes grew soft, for a moment her youth was hers again.</p>

  <p>"Kept what?" Mark asked in a perplexity.</p>

  <p>"The mallet."</p>

  <p>She reached forward and picked it up.</p>

  <p>"That?" Mark said, still wondering what the pother was about. "I suppose I
  have used it for a paper weight, off and on, for a very long time. Now I come
  to think of it, it must have lain on this big table ever since I came to
  Upper Theign. I have used it&mdash;yes, but I haven't noticed it. I must have
  found it somewhere one day when the wind from the garden was blowing my
  letters all over the room. But where it came from, I can't imagine."</p>

  <p>"I can tell you," said Mona, with an odd smile. She was amused like one
  playing a game.</p>

  <p>Mark fell in with her mood.</p>

  <p>"Let me think!...No!..." He took the mallet out of her hand and turned it
  over. "M for Mark?...No, I can't remember doing that!"</p>

  <p>"You didn't do it."</p>

  <p>Mark's mind was a blank.</p>

  <p>"Who did?"</p>

  <p>"An old boat-builder at Salcombe." And Mark Thewliss dropped the mallet.
  It fell with a heavy thud upon the leather-covered table, turned over twice,
  knocking loudly&mdash;knocking upon the closed doors of memory&mdash;and lay
  still.</p>

  <p>"I had forgotten it altogether," said Mark quietly; and at another time
  Mona would have heard in his voice an urgent appeal that she should forget it
  too. But she heard only the words. She was carried away by a sudden passion,
  born of the recollections which surged up in her at the sight of that mallet,
  strengthened too by Mark's own kindness. He should have his reward for that
  kindness. Lois too would get her profit from it, wouldn't she? Mona
  persisted.</p>

  <p>"The old boat-builder tossed it into the punt. You had your letter
  offering you the partnership. We were racing back to Southampton Water. It
  was a Sunday morning. He threw it into the punt, as he pushed us off from the
  steps&mdash;with a word or two, Mark..."</p>

  <p>"Mona!" he cried sharply, loudly, and she stopped.</p>

  <p>He remembered the little incident now, and the words the old man had used;
  and he did not wish them repeated. Women looked backwards&mdash;men looked
  forwards&mdash;wasn't that the rule of the world? No doubt that old mallet
  had come along with the rest of the <i>Sea Flower's</i> furniture when she
  was dismantled years ago. It had lain here and lain there, in this house and
  that, under his nose, but never recognised, never even really perceived. It
  was bad luck that her eyes should notice it.</p>

  <p>"Mona, I want you to understand," he said gravely; and to stop a
  resurrection which he felt somehow to be dangerous he went beyond the truth.
  "That old mallet has no history for me at all. It would not be lying on my
  table in this house if it had. It has no meaning, no associations. The M! As
  you say, I didn't burn it into the wood. It has nothing to do with me. Shall
  I tell you what it is? It is the initial upon a coffin which has lain
  forgotten, deep in the earth for five-and-twenty years."</p>

  <p>So he spoke and turned away. But the answer came nevertheless, very low
  and gently uttered but very distinct.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mark, but dead things which have lain coffined deep in the earth for
  five-and-twenty-years still have living children."</p>

  <p>And she waited with just a tiny sense of triumph whilst the truth so long
  concealed broke like the dawn upon Mark's brain and heart.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18"></a>XVIII &mdash; DIFFICULTIES&mdash;AND NATURE'S WAY OUT</h2>

  <p class="first">Lois!</p>

  <p>She was his, then&mdash;actually his. Mark began to move about the room,
  almost stumbling like a blind man, putting out a hand and feeling the back of
  a chair here, the edge of a table there. There was a light upon his face
  which none of his success had ever kindled. He was troubled, but divinely
  troubled. The dream of many years, now for many years foregone, was
  fulfilled, the ache to be lulled only by an obsession of work was smoothed
  away. An overcast day had broken up and the rose had bloomed. Lois! And he
  had called the name fantastic! Why, it was an adorable name. Mark
  laughed&mdash;a quiet gurgle of delight. He was thinking:</p>

  <p>"A crasher! Not Mr. Wyatt's style, which was plump and ruddy. And not
  homey! But definitely a crasher! Well, I must see if I can't produce some
  hominess without damaging the crashery."</p>

  <p>He was standing in the window looking out on to the park; and he recalled
  the afternoon when he had first been brought to this house, with his new need
  beginning to clamour for fulfilment. How long ago was that? Twelve years.
  Yes, twelve years. A sense of injustice and resentment all at once soured his
  high pleasure. For twelve years he had been robbed.</p>

  <p>"You ought to have told me of this before, Mona," he said sullenly,
  without turning about to her.</p>

  <p>"When&mdash;before?" she asked in a reasonable cool voice. "Before Lois
  was born perhaps? That was the only time. But you wouldn't have thanked me if
  I had. You didn't want a child in those days, Mark. You didn't even want a
  wife." A faint colour tinged her pale face and her voice now sank to a
  whisper full with confidence. "I'd have starved rather than tell you." She
  caught herself up, disdaining her own words.</p>

  <p>"It's curious how easily that sort of phrase gets itself spoken. Of course
  I shouldn't have starved&mdash;neither I nor Lois. I was quite capable of
  looking after both of us."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Mark agreed, turning now towards her.</p>

  <p>He remembered her pride and her efficiency. She stood with her head erect,
  her form still unbent. No doubt to this day she retained them both.
  Yet&mdash;yet&mdash;he put his perplexity into words.</p>

  <p>"Yet you married Perriton."</p>

  <p>"Yes. I wanted a name for Lois. I wanted her not to be ashamed. Henry was
  very good to me." Mona Perriton began to pick her way through a drift of
  dangerous words. "I didn't cheat him, of course. I told him the
  truth&mdash;that a child was coming, that you were its father. I made him
  take a little time to think it over&mdash;not too long. If we were going to
  marry we couldn't afford too long. He agreed that the child should be his. He
  was very good to me. We were little people as we are now, and we could live
  unnoticed. No one was going to worry about the date of our marriage. We used
  to live in a suburb where nobody knew us and there Lois was born."</p>

  <p>"And Lois herself knows nothing?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. That was the bargain," and she repeated: "Henry has been very
  good to me."</p>

  <p>The phrase stung Mark Thewliss to three separate kinds of anger. Anger
  with himself first of all. Other men had reached higher place and greater
  power than his who had married young and far humbler wives. He stole a glance
  at Mona. The stress of her life had worn her beauty thin before its time, but
  had she been set in the easy places amongst the exquisite things, as he could
  so soon have set her, she would have graced his house as long ago she had
  graced the <i>Sea Flower</i>; and she would have brought Lois with her. Anger
  with Mona in the second place, in that she put him to the humiliation of this
  self-reproach; and most unjust of all a spurt of anger with Olivia, a
  disparagement of her because she had married him and failed where Mona had
  triumphed. If she had triumphed!</p>

  <p>The suspicion slipped into his mind, more because he needed to find a
  fault in some other as well as in himself than for any other reason. Suppose
  that Mona Perriton&mdash;"pinched," that was the word&mdash;had looked about
  her for some warm satin-lined nest in which she could plant her darling and
  had chosen his house! He did not utter the suspicion, but it was in his eyes
  as he looked at her and Mona answered it. He had forgotten that uncomfortable
  gift she had of seeing the mechanism of his thoughts, when most he wanted a
  smoke-cloud to hide it behind.</p>

  <p>"You can easily find out the date of my marriage and the date of Lois'
  birth," she said, and she gave him on the spot the names of the church in
  which she wedded and the suburban parish of Liverpool in which Lois was
  born.</p>

  <p>"Besides," she added, "you mustn't forget that you had already promised
  all and more than I asked for Lois, before I told you she was your daughter.
  There was no reason why I should tell you at all. I didn't mean to when I
  came into this room. I was probably unwise. But I saw the mallet, and it
  brought back dim things too vividly, and&mdash;and&mdash;I suddenly wanted
  you to know." A smile gave back for a moment its beauty to her tired face. "I
  wanted you to be as proud of Lois as I am."</p>

  <p>Mark's indignation died away altogether.</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose that I shall find that so very difficult," he replied
  with a laugh. "I never really doubted that you were telling me the truth,"
  and indeed if he had so doubted, her story chimed so exactly with the
  discoveries of Joseph Wyatt that the doubt could not have endured. "I was
  trying not very successfully to find someone besides myself whom I could
  blame. Sit down again for a moment, Mona."</p>

  <p>He needed a few moments for reflection. The glittering avenues were now
  seen to be paved with flints. There would be delicate walking for all of them
  concerned in this ironic entanglement&mdash;for himself especially. He could
  not acknowledge Lois publicly, as he would have loved to have done, for her
  sake, and for Mona's and for his wife's Olivia's. That way out was closed,
  the door slammed and bolted and barred. There was another way to be sure, but
  it needed time and a good deal of sacrifice on Mona's part and a good deal of
  charity on Olivia's, and even then Lois herself might say "No"&mdash;yes,
  might very well say "No." He had met her but the once in the corridor of the
  Admiralty; but she had given him nevertheless a vivid impression of something
  more than a high independence and a consciousness of strong youth, of armour.
  Yes, that was the word he wanted. Armour damascened and gilded and daintily
  adorned, but armour none the less. Not homey, in a word, but a crasher.</p>

  <p>"Still, if I go to work very carefully," he reflected, "we might all in
  the end agree and I could adopt her."</p>

  <p>Since he and Olivia were growing old in a big and empty house, which
  itself, as he sometimes imagined it, was aching for the ripple and clamour of
  young voices, the adoption of a girl who had made her home there would be the
  most natural and reasonable thing. Only there was Olivia's point of view to
  be considered. He had an awkward little story to tell her&mdash;full of
  humiliation for her. How would she take it? She was a brick, yes, but she was
  the corner stone of this palace of dreams which he was so busily erecting,
  and would she fit into her important place?</p>

  <p>Mark rose with an uneasy jerk from his chair. He was not of the men who go
  to a doctor and hope that the truth will be concealed from them. He wanted to
  know, and at once.</p>

  <p>"I tell you what, Mona. You go and find Lois and bring her here, whilst I
  break the news to my wife."</p>

  <p>Mona drew in her breath with a gasp.</p>

  <p>"The news that you've engaged a secretary," she said insistently.</p>

  <p>Mark shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The news that I've found my daughter."</p>

  <p>And a cry of fear broke with a startling sharpness from Mona's lips.</p>

  <p>"Mark, you can't do that! You mustn't!"</p>

  <p>"Mona, I must."</p>

  <p>Supplications and entreaties were as unnatural in Mona Perriton's mouth as
  a foreign accent, but they streamed from her now. The bridle of acquiescence
  was lifted from her tongue.</p>

  <p>"Mark, you don't understand! If you tell your wife everything she'll hate
  Lois. She will! She'll forgive you, she won't give a thought to me, but
  she'll hate Lois night and day. She'll make her life intolerable."</p>

  <p>"You don't know my wife."</p>

  <p>"I don't have to know her to be sure of that. Here's Lois, tall and slim
  and lovely, in your house, your child and not hers. An ever present reproach
  to her because she has never borne a child to you&mdash;a constant galling
  humiliation. She'll be horrible to Lois! Any woman would&mdash;the best in
  the world. We can all be as venomous as rattlesnakes if we get provocation
  enough, and you're giving her all the provocation in the world."</p>

  <p>She looked eagerly into Mark's face for some sign of acquiescence, but
  though he stood moodily frowning as though he half believed her, he would not
  keep her secret from Olivia.</p>

  <p>"What a fool I was ever to tell it you," she exclaimed. "I have kept it
  myself for twenty-five years and now I must blurt it out like a lunatic.
  Mark, listen!" She took his arm and clung to it:</p>

  <p>"I am warning you. This pleasant life of yours will all be spoilt," and
  Mark gently freed himself from her grasp.</p>

  <p>"I can't help it," he said quietly. "It's the risk we must run. But to
  bring my daughter into my house and not tell my wife? No! I am going to use
  your own words, Mona. I don't cheat, either."</p>

  <p>Mona wrung her hands in a little gesture of despair and was silent. Mark
  crossed to the door. His hand was on the knob when she spoke again but this
  time in a gentle, almost toneless, voice.</p>

  <p>"Wait a moment, will you?"</p>

  <p>As he had asked her for a space for reflection, so she made the same plea
  now. She stood with her eyes upon the carpet at her feet and asking
  herself:</p>

  <p>"Shall I take Lois away? Shall I find her and say that I have failed?
  Wouldn't that be the best way? But what if I do?"</p>

  <p>In time, no doubt, Lois would get a job of work. She might even find one
  immediately, and a good one. But it was all a matter of chance. And here was
  this startling opportunity waiting to be seized. She couldn't refuse it. She
  couldn't go in search of Lois and see the distress cloud her face, and her
  lips perhaps quiver and the tears gather in her eyes. Lois must run the risk
  of the wife's hostility. Mark at all events would be there to protect
  her.</p>

  <p>"I'll go and find Lois," she said. "But remember you hold her in trust
  from me."</p>

  <p>"My dear, I'll not fail you."</p>

  <p>Both of them were grave, both conscious that a vital change had taken
  place in the direction of their lives. As a rule one lustrum melts into the
  next by a gradual development, so that changes of disposition and views and
  obligations which may surprise and even shock the onlooker cause not so much
  as a start to those to whom they happen. Habit unawares smooths out a life.
  But twice these two had stood conscious of a revolution in their
  lives&mdash;once in Salcombe Harbour on board the <i>Sea Flower</i>, a second
  time here at Upper Theign&mdash;with a definite choice to make of which they
  could not foresee the consequences but knew they must be tremendous.</p>

  <p>"You'll do what you can, Mark, I know," she said as he held open the door
  for her. She laid a hand for a second upon his sleeve and passed out into the
  sunlight of the garden.</p>

  <p>Mark closed the library door. On the other side of the room a second door
  opened into Olivia's sitting-room. He took a step or two towards it and
  suddenly drew back, his heart leaping unexpectedly. Through the window he saw
  two young people side by side on the river bank&mdash;Derek Crayle and his
  own daughter Lois.</p>

  <p>He hid behind a window-curtain and watched. Derek was doing all the
  talking, pointing out some feature of interest, then again narrating some
  terrific reminiscence, some great fish played with infinite patience upon a
  pack-thread and&mdash;with a glance towards the laboratory under the
  trees&mdash;some proud word about his partnership. He was talking about
  himself with a complete concentration in the time-honoured way; and she, with
  a smile here and a look of admiration there and a timid little question to
  show at once her ignorance and her interest, was just jollying him along in
  the time-honoured way too. Mark Thewliss chuckled as he watched them. There
  were the glass panes of the french window between him and them, but he had no
  need to hear what they said, so evidently was the age-old story of the young
  man and the maid beginning to be retold.</p>

  <p>Of course here was the solution of his troubles! Whilst he was considering
  clumsy processes like adoption, Nature was taking the matter into her own
  capable hands, flattening down that flinty road for him, telling him to stand
  on one side and see good work well done. Mark laughed aloud in the silent
  room. What a couple they would make! Both of them young and erect and sane
  and sweet with health. They had fallen into a thoughtful mood now, walking
  pensively, exchanging thoughts of an unparalleled profundity. It was all
  according to plan&mdash;but Nature's plan, not his. He turned away from the
  window and sought Olivia in her sitting-room.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19"></a>XIX. &mdash;THE COMPLICATION OF OLIVIA</h2>

  <p class="first">He told her the story from the beginning. Olivia interrupted
  him with a smile of dry good-humour when he described the month's cruise of
  the <i>Sea Flower</i>.</p>

  <p>"I hope you had good weather, Mark," she said.</p>

  <p>"Gorgeous," he replied with a chuckle of relief at the spirit in which she
  took the disclosure of the gay adventure of his youth. But it was all over
  and done with long before he had ever set eyes on her at Gissens, and there
  was nothing in so hoary an affair to cause her a second of inquietude.</p>

  <p>But her face changed as the story was continued; and when she understood
  the purpose on which he had set his heart, such a look of revolt and
  consternation came into her eyes and convulsed her features as Mark had never
  seen in her before.</p>

  <p>"Your daughter?" she said in a low incredulous voice. "You are going to
  bring her into our house between you and me? She's to have her room in your
  offices in London, she's to live with us here. She's to share your
  confidence, to know all your secrets? To push me out?"</p>

  <p>"No," Mark exclaimed. "She couldn't do that!"</p>

  <p>"Couldn't she? You'll see, my dear. She has youth, ability you say, and I
  don't doubt it. Good looks and good manners?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed. You would have been quick to mention it, if she had been
  plain. And your daughter, besides. What you have longed for until even in
  your sleep you have prayed aloud for her coming. What arms have I against
  her?"</p>

  <p>Already it was a war, and the terms of war came naturally to Olivia's
  lips.</p>

  <p>"You need no arms," cried Mark in a quick protest but she took him up.</p>

  <p>"Oh, the fine words! She'll dance about this house, she'll work, and
  she'll laugh, she'll manage you and hector you prettily and you'll love every
  minute of it. You are looking forward to every minute of it. And the fresh
  young face and the fresh young voice will just mean a perpetual shame for
  me."</p>

  <p>The words dropped to a whisper; she made a little despairing gesture with
  her hands and sat silent. She spread about her an aura of desolation. She saw
  the peace and the pleasant security of the lovely house broken up, the house
  itself toppling about her ears. She was exaggerating, thought Mark, she was
  prophesying woes, the Cassandra of a tea-party; but none the less the woes,
  imaginary though he believed them to be, were real enough to her.</p>

  <p>He turned away and stood disconsolately staring out of the window. The
  view it commanded was different from that of his study. He overlooked an
  empty space of grassland and trees. There was no river bank, no gracious
  couple strolling absorbed in the momentous affairs of youth. He missed them
  and must continue to miss them.</p>

  <p>"Of course, Olivia, I shall take back my promise," he said gently and then
  his voice shook. "And I had so built upon it&mdash;even within these few
  minutes since I have known! But it can't be helped. I must find some other
  way of giving a start to that poor little girl."</p>

  <p>The misery of his voice melted Olivia.</p>

  <p>"Poor little girl," she repeated, and added with a poignant sadness: "But
  poor Mark too! And poor Olivia! And poor all of us! She must come, my dear.
  You'ld grieve too much if she didn't. You'ld blame me&mdash;you couldn't help
  blaming me."</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"And you'ld be just in blaming me. God knows, it mightn't be very long
  before you came to loathe the sight of me. It's I who would be the
  interloper."</p>

  <p>Mark began some sort of protest but she would not hear him. She gave him
  her hand with a smile and a sigh:</p>

  <p>"It's settled, Mark. I'll join you in the library. Just give me a minute
  or two;" and she could not forbear from a little stinging phrase to end the
  debate. "It needs a little study to take in a moment gracefully the second
  place."</p>

  <p>"That's all nonsense, Olivia," said Mark, and he drifted uncomfortably out
  of the room, with a regret in his mind that women should build such enormous
  mountains out of such small molehills. They would talk in superlatives. First
  Mona must start the exaggeration with her talk about rattlesnakes and venom.
  Now Olivia must tread upon her heels with lamentations that she was
  dethroned.</p>

  <p>Certainly Olivia was right in this. A revolution had taken place in the
  small society of Upper Theign and its economy was quite upset. Olivia rose
  from her chair and planted herself in front of a long mirror, and shook her
  head dolefully over the image of herself which she saw reflected there. The
  charm of delicate colours was lost from her face. Perhaps Mark had never
  noticed the loss, so gradually they had faded. But he would now that she was
  to stand side by side with youth in all its fine bravery. He would realise it
  incredulously, so startling must be the contrast. Olivia was a handsome woman
  in the early forties who had not been troubled by jealousies and had watched
  the passing of the years with equanimity. But she took the blackest view of
  herself this morning, finding merit neither in her appearance nor her
  record.</p>

  <p>"A barren, middle-aged good-for-nothing," she said, with many nods of the
  head, reprimanding her reflection in the mirror. And catching a trick of
  speech from her husband: "Your name's Mrs. Fiddle-Faddle."</p>

  <p>She tore herself away from her mirror. The glass door of her room stood
  open. She stepped out into the garden. A few minutes in the fresh air and she
  would subdue herself to meeting the interloper with a smiling welcome and a
  frank clasp of the hand. But she shrank from the meeting the more she
  rehearsed it, and the minutes heaped themselves up. She thought that she
  might be the better composed if she approached the library from the garden.
  She would thus have the opportunity of seeing the interloper a little while
  before the actual moment of speaking to her. She walked therefore round the
  angle of the house and stopped in front of the library windows. She had a
  clear view of the room and no one within the room noticed her at all.</p>

  <p>Yet there were three people within the room. Mark, Derek Crayle and Lois
  herself. Derek was a new complication in the tangle of the affair. Olivia had
  not thought of Derek in her confusion, but she made up for it now. She had
  views for Derek&mdash;a marriage suitable to his fine record and his high
  future. Derek was to her a younger brother. No, she wouldn't allow any
  foxiness of Mark's to make a sacrifice of Derek. Certainly not! She was quite
  convinced that it was no wounded feeling of her own which made her so
  determined that Derek should not be entrapped to make glories for Mark's
  daughter. Certainly not.</p>

  <p>"I am thinking coolly and impartially of Derek's happiness," she assured
  herself; and she repeated her assertion several times upon the principle of
  Doctor Cou.</p>

  <p>She watched them. It increased her indignation&mdash;for she was indignant
  now&mdash;that she could not find fault with Lois. She was rather lovely with
  her big dark eyes, her clear oval of a face, and her long, slim legs. Also
  she was well dressed. At the bottom of her heart Olivia had wished for a
  distressing incurable flashiness. But from the girl's plain brown court shoes
  to her little hat she was as trim and spruce as if she had just been unpacked
  from a band-box. Not a bunch of ribbons fluttered, nothing flopped. And she
  was making the men look silly. She certainly was. They were arranging her end
  of the big writing-table, both of them, laughing, setting her blotting-pad
  straight and her chair in position, courting her "gambolling," said Olivia
  disdainfully.</p>

  <p>Inside the room, indeed, Mark was saying:</p>

  <p>"Yes, that'll be your place, Miss Perriton, when you're at work, straight
  opposite to me."</p>

  <p>"Not when I use a typewriter," said Lois.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't mind a typewriter," Mark explained airily. "It never
  distracts my attention."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, it helps me to concentrate," said Derek. "I shall sit here."</p>

  <p>He drew up a chair at the side of the table midway between the two
  ends.</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the kind, Derek," Mark exclaimed. "This isn't your room.
  Besides, the table's solid. There's no place for your legs."</p>

  <p>Olivia could not hear the ridiculous conversation, but she had no need to.
  It was all very evident through the glass of the windows. And the girl stood
  aloof, pleasantly grave and well-mannered and attentive.</p>

  <p>"Making my men look silly," said Lady Thewliss. "I'm not going to have
  it."</p>

  <p>Her indignation was now unendurable. She advanced towards the window, no
  longer shy of the meeting, on the contrary eager for it. She pushed the long
  panel of the window which should have opened inwards. But on this occasion it
  did not open at all. There was a knob on the outside, but it was only a knob.
  The bolt worked within the room, and, as it has been recorded, Mark had shot
  it. Olivia found herself shut out.</p>

  <p>"This is what I said would happen," she reflected. "It's a sign! I am
  pushed out," and she rapped upon the glass.</p>

  <p>But so engrossed were the two men in the new secretary, and so attentively
  was the new secretary watching them, weighing them, that the rapping was
  unheard. She knocked a second time, more loudly, with exasperation tingling
  in her finger-tips. This second time Mark Thewliss heard. He looked up and
  saw Olivia's face beyond the window-pane. He barely suppressed a cry of
  dismay as he hurried forward and flung it open.</p>

  <p>"I bolted it by accident," he said, excusing himself.</p>

  <p>"No doubt, my dear."</p>

  <p>"A long time ago, Olivia. I wasn't thinking. It was before I came to see
  you in your room."</p>

  <p>"That's all right, Mark," Olivia answered. "It's what you would call
  according to plan, isn't it?" She stepped forward. "And this young lady is
  your new secretary, Mark?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. This is Miss Perriton. Lady Thewliss." The shrewd young eyes rested
  quietly on the agitated face of her elder. Lois bowed respectfully.</p>

  <p>"You will make yourself at home here," said Olivia. "It is quiet, but, of
  course, we are often in London, too, and no doubt your presence will bring
  about a change even here."</p>

  <p>The words might have been cordially meant, but they were tipped with
  irony.</p>

  <p>"You'll stay for lunch, Miss Perriton, won't you?" Olivia added.</p>

  <p>"Thank you very much, but my mother is waiting for me. We kept our taxi,
  and have a train to catch."</p>

  <p>"Miss Perriton will be taking up her duties in a week's time," said Mark,
  and as Lois, with another inclination of the head, moved to the door, Derek
  followed her. There was an awkward moment of silence when Mark and Olivia
  were left alone. Then she said:</p>

  <p>"She is very pretty. I congratulate you, Mark. I am sure that she will be
  a great help. Luncheon will be ready in five minutes."</p>

  <p>She went into her own room, whilst Mark plumped himself down in a
  chair.</p>

  <p>"The scientists say that sometime or another the glacial period will
  return to England," he reflected. "By George, they're right, and it's already
  begun."</p>

  <p>He raised his head when Derek returned into the room and said:</p>

  <p>"Derek, I was warned that I was going to do a damned silly thing. But I
  wouldn't listen. I went 'wow-wow' and did it. And after I had done it I knew
  it was a damned silly thing. Does that ever happen to you?"</p>

  <p>"It's normal," said Derek Crayle.</p>

  <p>The gong was sounded in the hall. Derek went out of the room to wash for
  luncheon. Mark Thewliss sat on, very disheartened. He heard Olivia saying
  again:</p>

  <p>"Poor Mark! Poor Olivia! Poor all of us!"</p>

  <p>He wondered uneasily.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch20"
     id="ch20"></a>XX. &mdash;MR. HOYLE TALKS A GOOD DEAL</h2>

  <p class="first">Half-way through the month of October of that year four men
  dined together in a private room of a great railway hotel in Manchester.
  Arthur Hoyle, who had kept the keys of the laboratory at Upper Theign whilst
  Thewliss was demonstrating his new formula, had convoked the other three to
  this city as to a convenient centre. They were all engaged in the manufacture
  of fabrics: Sir James Copeland, of Bradford, Wisberry of Somersetshire, and
  Benfield, who was striving desperately to maintain a small industry of pure
  silk on the border of Cheshire. During the service of dinner they talked flat
  racing and golf and musical comedy; and it was not until the coffee and the
  liqueurs were on the table and the door shut upon the waiter that the
  business of the evening was approached.</p>

  <p>Benfield, an old, thin, tall man with a bald head and an untidy beard,
  leaned forward, anxiously rolling between his lips, with long,
  tobacco-stained fingers, a small cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Well, Hoyle! Let us hear!"</p>

  <p>"There's no doubt about it," Hoyle answered.</p>

  <p>He got up from his chair and took from an attach-case, which was laid
  upon a plush couch against the wall, a parcel wrapped in tissue-paper. He
  carried the parcel back to the table and, unfolding it, displayed the dyed
  strips of different materials which he had carried away with him from Upper
  Theign.</p>

  <p>"It has been a hot summer, as you know," he said. "During the last four
  months these samples have all been exposed continually to the fiercest
  sunlight. Now look at them! The colours are as fresh as they were on the day
  when I took them away from Thewliss' laboratory."</p>

  <p>The strips were passed from hand to hand and examined with a meticulous
  scrutiny.</p>

  <p>"So, you see! Thewliss has brought it off."</p>

  <p>The samples reached the mournful Benfield last of all, and as he laid them
  again upon the table Copeland, of Bradford, a small, round, comfortable man,
  looked up faintly hopeful and asked:</p>

  <p>"There was no trickery, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. What about that?" exclaimed Wisberry. "I put it up to Thewliss
  myself that I shouldn't be easily satisfied."</p>

  <p>"Not a bit."</p>

  <p>Hoyle was the only man of the party who was not sunk fathoms deep in
  gloom. By contrast with the others his voice sounded brisk and even
  cheerful.</p>

  <p>"Apart from the fact that Thewliss isn't a trickster&mdash;we've all got
  to allow that his record puts that idea outside practical politics&mdash;I
  held the key of the laboratory all the time he was at work, and I had men
  besides doing sentinel and regularly relieved. The windows were all shuttered
  and barred from the outside. Thewliss got his daylight and air through a
  skylight in the roof. He was <i>incommunicado</i>, believe me I No, his
  universal formula is O.K."</p>

  <p>Copeland lit a cigar and compressed the sentiments of the small company
  into a brief oath.</p>

  <p>"Damn the fellow."</p>

  <p>Then Mr. Benfield ran his long fingers through his beard and combed out
  some of his tangles.</p>

  <p>"It means a new plant, I take it, even if Thewliss patents his formula and
  let us into his secret."</p>

  <p>Hoyle shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"New processes mean new installations."</p>

  <p>"Then I'm through," said Mr. Benfield. "Down and out."</p>

  <p>"Thewliss is thinking of the public," Hoyle replied.</p>

  <p>"The public won't think of me when I'm being grilled in the Bankruptcy
  Court," said Benfield; and the man from Somersetshire beat impotently upon
  the table with his fist.</p>

  <p>"The public!" he cried. "My eye to the public! I wish I had gone into the
  wine trade." And as his companions curiously wondered at this new twist in
  his thoughts, he continued: "By the Lord, I do. I sit in my house and drink
  the same sort of wine from the same sort of bottles, stopped with the same
  sort of corks, as my great-great-grandfather did in his square-skirted coat
  and his buckled shoes. There's security for you in the wine trade. But with
  us it's all improvements and developments until your brain reels. And nobody
  asks for 'em, mind you! Not a soul!"</p>

  <p>"The public?" asked Mr. Hoyle dryly.</p>

  <p>"The public doesn't, because it doesn't know a thing about 'em until it's
  told. And it needn't be told. But there's always some damned restless,
  uncomfortable fellow like Thewliss who can't leave things alone."</p>

  <p>"You're talking like my foreman Brent," said Hoyle, with a grin. He
  appeared to take some pleasure in sharpening still more the anger of his
  friends against Thewliss.</p>

  <p>"Then your foreman Brent's a damned sensible fellow," Wisberry hotly
  retorted. "Just see how I stand. The Wisberrys have always been small,
  independent men, working their own factory, putting a little bit aside each
  year, taking a little bit of a part in their local affairs, small,
  independent, valuable men and proud of their position. They were never taken
  into big partnerships, they never stood for Parliament or married into
  society or got hoisted up into the peerage. They were small, dignified people
  with hundreds of years of traditions behind them, and contented. Now they've
  got to go. Washed out, amalgamated, one of a string of mills working
  Thewliss' universal formula. Sounds like a quack medicine, don't it? It's a
  rotten day for England when the small masters get sucked into the mangle and
  flattened out into employees."</p>

  <p>Mr. Wisberry leaned back with an indignant snort, very red in the face,
  and puffed at his tobacco-pipe. Hoyle turned towards Copeland.</p>

  <p>"Beyond summing up very correctly our opinion of Thewliss, you haven't
  contributed to the discussion," he said, and Copeland agreed.</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't. And I'll tell you why. I don't want to be bothered any
  more. I'm not a young man. I've worked devilish hard in my time, and I've now
  got a bit of money usefully invested. I'd like to go on as I'm going. A
  morning in the office, a round of golf three or four times a week, a good
  glass of port after my dinner and a long night's rest on the top of it.
  That's what I want, but if I can't have it I'm not going to put up with
  anything else! See? I'll be sorry to see a business I've built up go, but
  I've no children to worry about. I shall sell what I can sell&mdash;goodwill,
  mills, plant and the rest of it for what I can get and slip out."</p>

  <p>Hoyle looked round the table with a grin.</p>

  <p>"Not much fight in any of your fellows," he said unpleasantly.
  "Defeatists&mdash;that's the new word, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"You only break your nails when you fight a steamroller," said the
  melancholy man of the silkworms.</p>

  <p>"Better lie down, and take the knock, eh?" answered Hoyle. "Well,
  personally, I'm against lying down."</p>

  <p>His strong face, with its blunt features, flushed to a dark red, and was
  very masterful.</p>

  <p>"It's all very well for you," Wisberry grumbled. "You can stand the
  racket."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps! I'm not so sure that I can stand it&mdash;alone." He leaned
  towards Wisberry across the rim of the table. He wanted all these men with
  him, and he turned his voice to the notes of sympathy. "I'm all for your
  point of view. You have said many true things. The little independent men
  have built up England. The foreman who has the courage and brains and
  character to become a master, and when he's a master to work till one o'clock
  in the morning, when his comrade stops virtuously at six in the evening. Yes,
  those are the fellows. They're the heart and the strength of England. But
  they're done for. We've got to recognise that a lot of good things are
  passing away. There's not a politician in any party who'll cast a vote or
  make a speech to keep the little independent man alive and kicking.
  Conservatives, Liberals, Labour&mdash;give 'em any sort of fancy name you
  like&mdash;the little independent man means nothing to 'em. What they are
  going to replace him with, as the stay and prop of England, they don't know,
  they don't care, they don't give a thought to.</p>

  <p>"We are governed not by men, but by phrases and gestures and slogans. 'Big
  business' is one of them. Big business means that no man shall work later or
  harder or better than his neighbour. So the little man can't get through.
  Conservatives say it, Liberals say it, Labour men say it. What's the phrase?
  The door is slammed and bolted and barred&mdash;against the little man. He
  must stop work at six and remain a man on a wage, somebody's servant always
  and never his own master. He has got his recreation ground to make up for his
  servitude. We've got to face it. Amalgamations, mass production, each unit of
  production fed with enormous capital and no more little independent men. Yes,
  but listen to me! The little men who've got through, who are in
  being&mdash;they're in a different case. It isn't a question of stopping them
  getting through. It's a question of pushing them back amongst the servants;"
  and he stopped and looked about him, nodding his head encouragingly&mdash;the
  man who knew something, the man with a scheme. "Not quite such an easy job,
  that! No, sir!"</p>

  <p>Of Hoyle's small audience, Copeland, who had severed himself from ambition
  and looked for nothing more than the ease to which his years of work had
  entitled him, was perhaps alone unimpressed by the tirade.</p>

  <p>"What's the great idea?" he scoffed. "Shall we burgle Thewliss' house and
  destroy his formula?"</p>

  <p>"Destroy it, no," Hoyle returned quickly; and even Copeland raised his
  eyebrows in a flash of interest. It was only the destruction of the formula
  which Hoyle accepted as ridiculous. The other half of his joke, the theft of
  it, was left unmentioned&mdash;as too foolish for words? Or as worth so many
  words that it could only be most delicately approached. Copeland felt himself
  pleasantly stimulated, as he might be by a detective novel.</p>

  <p>"Carry on!" he said in quite a different voice.</p>

  <p>Suddenly all the lassitude and the despair had vanished. A new spirit had
  awaked in that room. Three pairs of eyes were fixed upon Hoyle, eyes still
  anxious but no longer hopeless, three chairs were drawn close to the tables,
  three bodies became vibrant and alert. Hoyle had the magnetism of a leader.
  To borrow an expressive phrase from another art, he came over the footlights
  at them&mdash;and held them.</p>

  <p>"To destroy the formula," he declared, and brushed the notion away with a
  wave of the hand, "no good! One thing, I think it's not so complicated but
  that Thewliss can carry the main processes in his head and work out the rest
  again. He has been twenty-five years at it, remember! But even if he
  couldn't, someone else will. I'm a fatalist in these things. Once a thing's
  discovered, it's discovered. Drag a secret out of Nature, she can't hide it
  away again. It'll be whispered somehow, it'll fill the air, and some crafty
  fellow will condense it and get it tangible and solid again, No! Leave that
  out!"</p>

  <p>"What then?" asked the manufacturer from Somerset.</p>

  <p>"Yes, what then?" Hoyle repeated. "Now listen to me and don't for Heaven's
  sake shy at a word I'm going to use," and he leaned forward shaking a
  forefinger. "The important thing for us gathered here is not the formula but
  the psychology&mdash;yes, that's the word you're not to shy at&mdash;of its
  discoverer, Mark Thewliss."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoyle was perhaps a little too disdainful of his companions. They were
  all, even the downhearted Benfield, shrewd enough business men who knew very
  well the importance of the individual factor in a deal and found nothing
  over-cryptic in Hoyle's fine word.</p>

  <p>"Very like," said Copeland. "Let's hear!"</p>

  <p>"I've known Thewliss for donkey's years," Hoyle continued, "did business
  with him when poor old William Mardyke used to wring his hands over his
  piratical young partner. Thewliss was going through the scrum then with his
  head down"&mdash;he turned to Wisberry&mdash;"your independent little man
  working till one o'clock in the morning and up again at six. Scientist first
  of all, mind, but wanting money, high position, the delicacies of life,
  power&mdash;or rather the sensation of power. Not so much doing
  things&mdash;which means power&mdash;as the pleasurable knowledge that you
  can do things if you choose. You can see that difference in the fact that
  though a Cabinet Minister young enough to be able to look forward to the
  highest office, he chucked it, took a peerage and went back to his own work.
  After all, governing is power, real power. But Thewliss had got what he
  wanted, the sensation of it, the tang and savour of it. He's a stag who eats
  only the top of the turnip, wants the fine taste not the meal, and so he went
  off to make real this old dream of his, the formula which is to put colour
  within the reach of the poorest coolie in Seringapatam and make the whole
  world good-humoured."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's the man! Granted," Benfield agreed. "But how are we
  saved?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Wisberry concurred explosively. "It's all high-class, up-to-date
  exposition, old man, and thank you very much for it. But where do we come
  in?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't say 'that's the man,'" Hoyle returned. "I didn't even say it was
  ever all the man, though it was the part of him which stood out. But other
  sides of him are standing out now. He married, he wanted children, and there
  he's failed, you see, and it has broken his spirit a bit. Take that from me!
  He, the great man with all the coolies in lilac robes bowing to him as a
  second Mahomet, and an adoring family saying: 'That's papa, that big swell of
  a fellow!' Not to be! So Thewliss loses his edge. Then there's another
  curious little illuminating scene I was present at. Wait a bit! My throat's
  dry."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoyle rose from his chair and rang the bell. He certainly was thirsty,
  for not only was he talking a great deal more than was his habit, but he was
  talking with his thoughts concentrated on making such a choice of words as
  would best persuade his audience. But he desired even more than the
  satisfaction of his thirst a little space of time during which his three
  guests might memorise the substance of his speech.</p>

  <p>When the waiter appeared he ordered:</p>

  <p>"Four double whiskies and four small sodas."</p>

  <p>Mr. Benfield set up a mild bleat that if he took anything at this hour it
  was a glass of dry sherry, but Copeland, crying: "My word, that accounts for
  a lot," would not allow it. It was only when the four tumblers were
  pleasantly bubbling on the table that Hoyle resumed his argument.</p>

  <p>"That curious little circumstance&mdash;yes," he continued. "I let
  Thewliss out of his laboratory four months ago at the end of his
  demonstration. He rapped on the door and I let him out. It was about four
  o'clock in the morning. Well, I never saw a man more dejected."</p>

  <p>"Tired," Copeland corrected.</p>

  <p>"Tired, of course, but dejected, too. Queer that, eh? He had demonstrated
  under the strictest conditions the absolute success of twenty-five years of
  research and experiment and thought. He was the master of all the dyeing
  industries in the world&mdash;and he was dejected. So dejected that one other
  who was present, a young Colonel Crayle, gasped out that he had failed. But I
  knew better. Thewliss stood in the doorway spreading about him an
  extraordinarily penetrating sense of loneliness. He was lonely, Do you follow
  me, Copeland? You, too, Wisberry? See how it fits exactly in what I told you
  before. He had longed for a child, to crown all his hard work and wealth and
  make it worth while. And the child had been denied him. All right! He had
  still the undiscovered formula to occupy him. But that's done with now. The
  rest of his life was looking a little blank just then. Not very much fun to
  be got out of it. See! Not very much inducement to get busy with marketing
  his discovery."</p>

  <p>Copeland pursed up his lips and nodded his head.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I see that. He'll take his time."</p>

  <p>"And more time still," said Hoyle. "For here's another side of him. He's
  an artist, a craftsman, the old sort of craftsman with a real love of the
  thing he has done, a real reluctance to let it go because it mayn't just
  fulfil the artist's craving for exactness. I've seen him myself touch and
  fondle with his long fingers some fabric or another which has just taken some
  new shade of colour of his creation. The same sort of thing'll happen to him
  now, and more forcibly than before. He's going to put that formula away and
  pull it out again after a bit, to see if he can't simplify it a little more,
  and put it away again and play with it, like one of those Johnnies who paints
  your portrait for the Town Hall and begins by making it like you and then
  takes out and puts in until at the end you're a stranger with a knobbly
  nose."</p>

  <p>Mr. Wisberry chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but the portrait's hung up sooner or later," he said.</p>

  <p>"That's true," Hoyle agreed. "Let me put it this way. He'll be like a poet
  who writes a sonnet and can't let it out of his hands for fear that he might
  want to alter a rhyme or call her Diana instead of Lalage."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but the poem gets published in the end." The man of gloom and
  melancholy repeated Wisberry's objection. "What's the use of a few months'
  reprieve to any of us?"</p>

  <p>"Why, just this!" Hoyle looked carefully behind him to make sure that the
  door was shut. "Suppose that I could get hold of a copy of this formula,
  whilst Thewliss is still playing about with it. I don't say that I can, but
  suppose that I could. We could make a little trust. I could raise what money
  was required. I have got people who believe in me. We could quietly and
  quickly install the new plant required, each in his own factory, and we could
  scoop the pool. We should be first in the field&mdash;a long way first. We
  shouldn't be paying royalties in patents; we should be right there
  underselling everybody and turning out our stuff with double or treble shifts
  at an enormous profit."</p>

  <p>The man from Somersetshire brought his fist into play again.</p>

  <p>"By gum, that sounds good to me."</p>

  <p>Mr. Benfield shook his head, smoothed his long beard and twisted the tip
  of it. Gloom and cold water were his contributions to the gathering.</p>

  <p>"But can you get a copy of the formula?" he asked. "Not you!"</p>

  <p>And very slowly Hoyle produced a little case from the breast of his
  dinner-jacket. He opened it and laid it on the table. From one of the pockets
  he took five sheets of thin paper and unfolded them. They were covered with
  short lines of sentences in a clear microscopic hand, interspersed with
  hieroglyphics and curious lozenge-shaped diagrams.</p>

  <p>"Here it is," he said quietly.</p>

  <p>It was significant of the mastery which Hoyle had established over his
  companions that not one of them doubted the accuracy of the copy. It was
  significant of their own prudence that not one of them asked him how he had
  got hold of it. They accepted the five sheets of exquisite penmanship as the
  devout accept a miracle, and they gazed at the magician who had produced them
  with a reverential awe. They passed the papers from hand to hand, holding
  them gingerly by the edges lest the mark of a thumb should blur a necessary
  figure.</p>

  <p>"By gum!" the man from Somersetshire whispered. "Get in first, eh? Just
  the four of us! It'ld be a treat to see Thewliss' face."</p>

  <p>"Oh, come!" Copeland protested.</p>

  <p>He hated the introduction of personal rancours into the battles of
  business. A man went down&mdash;yes, and very likely you would try to make
  sure that he didn't get up again in a hurry. But not because you hated him.
  It was a jungle fight for life and lordship and food, not a tournament
  between enemies. Wisberry, with his creed of the small man, was introducing a
  foolish and a rather dangerous factor. They had Thewliss' formula. Very well!
  They would exploit it, but not out of animosity to Thewliss. There was
  neither time nor room for nonsense of that kind in the modern commercial
  life.</p>

  <p>"Leave Thewliss alone now!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Benfield, after a flicker of hope, relapsed into despondency as his
  old eyes wandered from diagram to capital letter and from capital letter to
  minute number on the top of it.</p>

  <p>"No use to me this! I can't make head or tail of it."</p>

  <p>"Nor I," Hoyle agreed heartily. "But I've got a laboratory of my own and a
  chemist&mdash;the best in the world and devoted to me. He'll read this off as
  if it was a leader in <i>The Times</i>." He folded up the sheets and put them
  away.</p>

  <p>"It's getting late. Here's what I propose. First my chemist gets to work.
  Then we worry out what's wanted in the way of plant, new and converted, and
  estimate the cost. Then we get the money. I charge myself with that. I know
  where I can get it. Then we quietly get the plant made and installed. And
  within twelve months we shall be working with treble shifts and orders years
  ahead. Is that agreed?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>The monosyllable came heartily from the three men, for even Benfield had a
  glimpse of salvation.</p>

  <p>"Good!"</p>

  <p>Hoyle rose from his chair, and the others followed his example and began
  to pick up their coats and hats from the chairs and sofas about the room.</p>

  <p>"Meanwhile," Hoyle adjured them earnestly, "not a word, not a chuckle even
  to your wives. And in a fortnight or so I'll fix up another meeting in some
  other busy centre where we shan't be noticeable, and come to it with the
  plans."</p>

  <p>The three men separated at the door, Benfield to catch a late train to
  Chesterfield, Wisberry to seek a less costly hotel, Copeland to take a whisky
  and soda in the bar. Hoyle remained alone. He released the spring of the
  blind and looked down from the window upon the lights of the station
  square.</p>

  <p>Big business? Amalgamations? Very well, since they must come, he would be
  at the head of the first of them in his industry. He no more encouraged
  personal animosities than did Copeland. He was simply outwitting Thewliss in
  the way of business. He had no regret either for the means by which he had
  obtained his copy of the formula&mdash;not a thought of the punishment and
  miseries which might befall those from whom he had obtained it. Such
  considerations never entered his mind. He was satisfied.</p>

  <p>Yet he had made two fatal mistakes. His analysis of the man Mark Thewliss
  had been both subtle and true, and but for his ignorance of two vital facts
  his heinous plan might successfully have been based upon it. But if the keen
  edge of life had been blunted for Mark, because he had no child with whom to
  enjoy it, it had grown sharp again. For he had recovered, suddenly and
  unexpectedly, a daughter. And if he had been inclined for lack of a goad
  rather to play with his invention than to exploit it, the goad was now
  supplied. For Mark was taking into partnership his wife's cousin, Derek
  Crayle, who had left the barrack square so that he might not mark time, and
  was not at all disposed to do it in the establishment of Mardyke and
  Campion.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoyle was pleased with his night's work as he looked down upon the
  station lights. But he had not profited himself, and he had done such harm
  upon others as nothing in the world could ever repair.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch21"
     id="ch21"></a>XXI. &mdash;OLIVIA MAKES AN OFFER</h2>

  <p class="first">"Poor Olivia! Poor all of us!" Olivia had exclaimed.</p>

  <p>But during the autumn months of that year no one could have truthfully
  quoted more than the first two words of that pitiful cry. It was only Olivia
  who suffered. The other three, Mark, and Derek Crayle and Lois, walked in a
  misty golden dream, watching their plans take substance and shaping them, as
  every little occasion offered, more and more to their will. It is true that
  Mark was at pains not to parade his joy and pride in this new big daughter
  who had tumbled out of the skies. But he could not conceal them from Olivia,
  who knew his secret.</p>

  <p>Some years before Thewliss had moved from the small house, with the blue
  door which would not open itself to interviewers, into the great square round
  the corner. In this mansion Lois had a little suite of rooms. She was of the
  family; not an entertainment was given but she must grace it. The
  companionable evenings of other years when Mark and Olivia made their plans
  and debated the little incidents of their lives were at an end. There were no
  plans, indeed, in Mark's thoughts at all except plans for Lois, and talk of
  them was taboo. The only occasions on which the pair sat down to dinner alone
  were those on which Lois was taken out to some dinner at a restaurant with a
  dance or a theatre to follow, and since Derek Crayle was as a rule her
  escort, Olivia's pleasure was altogether spoilt. She had welcomed with her
  whole heart Derek's entrance into Thewliss' great undertakings, dreaming of a
  fine marriage for him and a resplendent future. Now she felt that she would
  give anything if only she could return him safe and celibate to the army.</p>

  <p>"She means to marry him. She's an adventuress, that's what she is for all
  her reticence. And Mark's encouraging her. They're going to ruin Derek
  between them!"</p>

  <p>With such unuttered arguments Olivia fed her resentment and jealousy; and
  an estrangement grew up between her and Mark, all the more bitter to her
  because Mark was unaware of it. From the world Mark's secret was well kept.
  Lois was his personal secretary and obviously an efficient one. And if her
  position in the household seemed to some few people unduly privileged, it was
  explained by a conjecture set on foot by Mark himself that she was the
  daughter of an old business associate who had fallen upon evil times.</p>

  <p>"Anyway it won't be long, I think, before Lois is very definitely
  established. Derek's just waiting until the company's a fact and he's
  positively on the Board," Mark said to himself with a chuckle.</p>

  <p>The preparations, indeed, for the reorganisation of the firm of Mardyke
  and Campion did much to make Olivia's woeful forecast true. There were
  conferences at Upper Theign during the week-ends, in Brooke's Market and
  sometimes in Grosvenor Square. Sometimes Sir William Hawker from Ely Place,
  sometimes Gregory the old manager, would be present, but always Mark and
  Derek Crayle and always, too, Lois Perriton, since always a note must be
  taken of the discussions and a confidential summary made.</p>

  <p>Between the three houses the shuttle raced and rattled, weaving the new
  woof, an iridescent fabric for Mark, drab as fustian for Olivia. Once, when
  the conference took place at Upper Theign, she forced herself to enter the
  library and took a seat by the fire. A complete silence overtook the small
  council. She had heard voices eager, argumentative, cheery, when she was on
  the farther side of the door. Now the voices were mute and the speakers at a
  loss. The parable of the locked window was repeated for her at that moment.
  Lois sat at her end of the great table, her burnished head bent studiously
  over her notes, Mark sat at his, and Derek where he had threatened to be,
  between them with no room for his long legs at all. Sir William by the fire.
  They all rose when she came in and that formality seemed to underline their
  silence. She was the intruder, the outcast.</p>

  <p>But she persevered, and with a melancholy counterfeit of a smile she
  asked:</p>

  <p>"Well, at what stage are we now, Mark?"</p>

  <p>Mark was aghast at the thought of the intricate explanations which an
  answer would involve.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my dear," he said, closing with a decisive bang a fat volume on
  company law in which Hawker had been pointing out a passage, "we have come to
  the end for to-day, thank goodness! We have been drafting out some very
  technical clauses for our prospectus, and my head's in a whirl."</p>

  <p>Mark's head was never in a whirl, and he could have proffered no excuse
  more unfortunate. But he was aware that he had blundered, and in a haste to
  repair it he must make his blunder elephantine. He had had a project in his
  thoughts for a little while and, needing a diversion, he must needs suggest
  it now at a moment the most unpropitious.</p>

  <p>"I've been thinking, Olivia. We ought to have a dance here this Christmas.
  Fill up the house with all the young people we know, and hope for snow and
  the appropriate conditions. Lois"&mdash;he had long since called her
  Lois&mdash;"can collect some of the girls who worked with her at the
  Admiralty, and Derek must round up the young men."</p>

  <p>"And I must send out the invitations," Olivia added in a not too pleasant
  voice, as though that function made clear her true position in the house.</p>

  <p>But Lois was quick to add:</p>

  <p>"Oh, Lady Thewliss, of course I'll do that if you'll supply me with a list
  of names, and as for my friends at the Admiralty, they're scattered anywhere
  now."</p>

  <p>Olivia never again repeated her disastrous incursion. All that she had got
  out of it was a knowledge that a ball was to be given at Upper Theign for
  Lois' glorification and enjoyment, and a fresh confirmation that she herself
  was nothing but a pariah in her own house. She was pleased with the vile
  word. She repeated it to herself in front of her mirror.</p>

  <p>"A pariah! That's what you are! Not a nice thing to be, Olivia! But you
  are one!" She sniffed a little and then, as the best of women may do, she
  suddenly saw red. "And we know who has made you one, don't we?" she cried in
  a low tone of fury. She would have liked at that moment to have taken the
  slim young spruce beauty from the library, humiliated her, punished her and
  thrust her out to grovel her way through the world as best she could.</p>

  <p>But Olivia did not dwell long upon these futilities. A more practical way
  of release flashed one day into her mind Lois was the Adventuress&mdash;that
  was fixed and settled&mdash;the real genuine Vamp of which the picture
  palaces were then showing some examples which were assuredly very pale and
  second-rate compared with Lois. The real, true Vamp wasn't white and Spanish
  and fluttering with black draperies. Not a bit of it! She was healthy and
  modish and trim and bafflingly open. Anyway, Lois was an Adventuress and
  Adventuresses had their price. That was the crude thought at the centre of
  Olivia's reasonings.</p>

  <p>She might never have acted upon it, however, had she not gone to a supper
  party at a famous club and seen Derek Crayle and Lois committing the solecism
  of talking joyously whilst they danced. The rest of the throng revolved
  gloomily with dull, set faces and compressed mouths, thinking of their steps,
  slow-moving dervishes, the passionless fanatics of an unending rite. These
  two were openly enjoying themselves. To Olivia it was as though they laughed
  aloud in church, and there was no doubt who was to blame for the
  unseemliness. Olivia, one must see, had reached in her antipathy a point
  where Lois could do nothing but, by the mere fact of her doing it, it became
  an outrage and offence.</p>

  <p>The next morning Lois remained at the house in Grosvenor Square and
  Olivia, passing the library door at eleven o'clock, heard the busy clicking
  of the typewriter. Spurred by her memory of the unseemly dance, she opened
  the door and went in. She stood for a few moments behind the girl, watching
  the nimble movements of her fingers and the words forming in purple upon the
  paper. Then she said:</p>

  <p>"You are very clever at your work, Lois."</p>

  <p>Lois expected bricks, not honey, and was quite taken by surprise.</p>

  <p>"It is very kind of you to say so," she answered and went on with her
  work, wondering what was to come next. "There's a catch somewhere," she said
  to herself.</p>

  <p>"I've thought sometimes that a girl with your ability&mdash;and
  manners&mdash;and looks&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I shall get such a kick on the pants in a minute," thought Lois.</p>

  <p>"Has probably a fortune waiting for her in a country like the United
  States."</p>

  <p>"So that's it," reflected Lois. Aloud she said: "But I don't know a soul
  in the United States."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that wouldn't be a difficulty," said Olivia. "You would go with the
  very best introductions."</p>

  <p>"And I couldn't afford the journey, or the risk of not getting an
  engagement or of not being able to keep it if I did secure it."</p>

  <p>Olivia sat down in a chair at the side of the table.</p>

  <p>"But that needn't trouble you, Lois," she said eagerly. "I'll make an
  arrangement with you, on your own terms. You shan't suffer. Just think it
  over and let me know what you'ld consider fair. You'll be a tremendous
  success in the United States."</p>

  <p>Lois stopped her work and turned upon Olivia a pair of candid, grateful
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"You are very generous to me, Lady Thewliss. I appreciate it very much
  because I had an idea that you didn't like me at all. And if I say no to your
  kind thought to advance me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You refuse&mdash;?" Olivia broke in with a sharp disappointment.</p>

  <p>"I like my work here," Lois returned. "For a year after the War ended I
  had a very unhappy, anxious time, and I don't want it again."</p>

  <p>"But I've told you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know. But when poor girls like myself find a tiny safe corner where
  they won't be trampled underfoot, they've got to stay in it, Lady Thewliss,
  while they can," Lois said gently.</p>

  <p>Olivia was aware that she was not appearing to any advantage, whilst the
  girl, on the other hand, was a pattern of tact and respect. The knowledge
  exasperated her beyond endurance.</p>

  <p>"You won't go, then?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"Not unless I am dismissed," said Lois; and Olivia's patience snapped like
  a dry twig. Her dignity failed her, she made herself small; she hated herself
  for her abasement and Lois, who was the cause of it, more than herself.</p>

  <p>"But I want you to go," she cried helplessly. It was a wail more than a
  cry. "If you understood the difference between this house as it is and as it
  was before you came! I want you out of it. It began the day you came to Upper
  Theign. There were you three, Mark and Derek and you sitting at that table
  laughing, talking, absorbed, and there was I locked out."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Lady Thewliss, the window was locked by accident."</p>

  <p>"Then, yes. But it has been locked deliberately ever since. Oh, don't
  think I'm blind, please! And I must be blind and deaf too if I hadn't
  noticed, when I have broken unexpectedly into your discussions, the sudden
  dead stop, the embarrassment which comes when a stranger interrupts friends
  chatting about familiar things, and the flutter of conversation to hide from
  the stranger that he's in the way. A stranger&mdash;that's what you have made
  of me&mdash;a stranger in my own house. And I won't bear it! You must go. You
  have taken my place. You must give it back to me."</p>

  <p>"I've not tried to take anyone's place," Lois returned with spirit. "I've
  tried to make a little one for myself&mdash;that's all."</p>

  <p>"Lois, you must go."</p>

  <p>Olivia's passion had died down. The words were no longer an order but a
  prayer spoken in a whisper from parched lips and made moving by the petition
  of her eyes. "I can't go on like this."</p>

  <p>She felt huddled in the chair, that in spite of her wealth, her authority,
  her position in the world, she was no match at all for the girl who stood in
  front of her, nameless, poor, inconsiderable but gorgeously armoured by her
  youth.</p>

  <p>Lois, however, was deeply troubled by this outburst. Somehow she should
  have temporised and managed to avoid it. But it had caught her unawares. And
  it had to be reckoned with. Let this scene be repeated, and a little more
  publicly, say before her father, Mark Thewliss, or before Mark Thewliss and
  Derek&mdash;and there could be no guarantee that with a woman in Olivia's
  state of nervous exasperation it wouldn't be repeated&mdash;and she would
  have to go, she would have to insist on going, and she would go before she
  was ready to go. She meant to go in the end, but not before she was
  ready.</p>

  <p>"You must give me a little time, Lady Thewliss," she said softly. "It
  wouldn't be possible, after everyone has been so kind to me, for me to throw
  up a position like this without a good reason to offer. I couldn't say
  straight off without a hint that I had been thinking of it, that I was going
  to try my luck in the United States, could I? I should have to lead up to it.
  Besides, I don't think I want to go there. No! But I will leave, if you'll
  give me time. That I can promise you."</p>

  <p>Olivia had to be content with that promise. She had carried off something,
  at all events, as the price of her abasement. Lois, within a measurable time,
  would go, and go for good. That the old, pleasant, comfortably unemotional
  life of other days, here and at Upper Theign, could ever quite be
  re-established, she was not foolish enough to dream. Mark would be wounded by
  the defection of Lois, Derek, too, and both no doubt would blame her. There
  would be estrangement in place of comradeship for a time&mdash;perhaps for a
  long time. But Lois would have gone, would have taken her youth and her
  distinction and her appeal altogether away to some region where, whatever
  harm they worked would not matter to her. Olivia went out of the library,
  leaving Lois to her work. But the work went slowly now, though Lois did not
  waste her time in upbraiding Olivia. Olivia Thewliss had detested her from
  the outset of their acquaintance. It was no more than natural that she should
  wish to be rid of her.</p>

  <p>"But I shall go in my own time," said Lois. "When I am ready."</p>

  <p>There would have to be a reason given&mdash;a sound, acceptable
  reason&mdash;for her going and for something else besides. Yes, Lois had a
  good deal besides her work to occupy her thoughts that morning.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch22"
     id="ch22"></a>XXII. &mdash;THE NEW CLERK</h2>

  <p class="first">She spent the next morning at Brooke's Market, and at one
  o'clock Derek Crayle knocked upon her door.</p>

  <p>"I have made a discovery," he said with so much pride that he might just
  have dug some pillared gallery of the Second Dynasty out of the sands of
  Egypt. "This is a convenient moment to show it to you. Then perhaps we might
  go and lunch somewhere, don't you think?"</p>

  <p>Lois shook a forefinger at him.</p>

  <p>"I won't be bullied," said Derek. "Put that finger down!"</p>

  <p>"I wasn't thinking of bullying you," replied Lois as she got up and
  slipped on her coat. "I was going to point out to you very respectfully, as
  becomes me, that you are developing with unimaginable speed all the worst
  qualities of the City man. Good directors don't take their girl clerks out to
  luncheon."</p>

  <p>"I am not yet a director, and a glance at your work, Miss Perriton, shows
  me that you'll never be a clerk," said Derek.</p>

  <p>Lois made a most unclerkly grimace at him and pulled a hat down over her
  hair. They went out into Leather Lane and, passing along the side of the
  great Prudential house which now towered where Furnival's Inn had stood, they
  came out into High Holborn. Across the road the oak beams and old windows of
  Staple Inn wavered above the pavement. Derek took his companion by the arm
  and choosing a moment when the traffic opened, guided her across the street.
  Through the gateway of Staple Inn he led her into the second court.</p>

  <p>"There!" he cried, inviting her admiration, "I don't suppose a single
  person from Mardyke and Campion's has ever before taken the trouble to walk
  into Staple Inn and discover this!"</p>

  <p>Lois was silent. She had no enthusiasm with which to answer him.</p>

  <p>"It must be wonderful in summer," he urged, very definitely disappointed;
  and again she looked about her and made no answer.</p>

  <p>It was, to be sure, winter now. There were no lilies dreaming on the still
  water of the pond; no mantle of green leaves decked out the smoky, dark brick
  wall of the old hall, no sunshine warmed the stones. But even on this grey
  day it was a place of beauty and historic peace, where an older England
  preached its wise and silent homily on the little fever of the passions, and
  the great continuous heritage of a God-protected race. "Surely," Derek Crayle
  thought as he gazed ruefully into Lois's still impressive face, "she must
  respond."</p>

  <p>And in a way, an unexpected way, she did. At the first, passionate and
  purposeful as she was to the finger-tips under her tranquil mien, she was
  vaguely moved by the ancient quiet of the court. But she was moved to
  discomfort and doubt. So few years back she was not. So few years yet and she
  would not be. Was it worth while&mdash;the bitter wrath which rankled in her
  breast, the dangerous stratagem, the chill of anxiety? Derek saw her face
  waver and then harden. She had this short, insignificant life to live. Very
  well! But she had to live it. She belonged to that rolling world outside the
  two courts, whose thunders reached her ears. She threw off the spell which
  the place threatened to lay upon her with a gesture of anger.</p>

  <p>"You don't like this court?" Derek asked.</p>

  <p>"It has no message for me," she answered with defiance audible in her
  voice. "I hate it. I shall not come here again."</p>

  <p>Derek Crayle was quite baffled. He was never very secure with her. He had
  always an uneasy impression that her easy good-humoured reticence concealed
  smouldering fires and alien thoughts. But she had never seemed so abstruse as
  she did at this disappointing hour.</p>

  <p>Once past the gateway, however, and back in the jostle of the crowd, she
  turned to him with a look of remorse.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, Derek. I behaved like a perfect idiot," and to make yet more
  amends, "Didn't I hear something about luncheon?"</p>

  <p>"You did." Derek's face resumed its cheerfulness. "We oughtn't to go too
  far. We can go down to the Waldorf. There's another place, too, I have never
  been to along Oxford Street&mdash;Frascati's."</p>

  <p>Lois, for her part, had never been to either of those restaurants, but
  Frascati's lay in the direction she meant to take after luncheon.</p>

  <p>"I am going to choose a frock," she said.</p>

  <p>"For the dance at Upper Theign?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>Crayle stopped a taxi and they drove accordingly to Frascati's. That
  restaurant had no message for Lois any more than the second court of Staple
  Inn. At those two places on a day of summer twenty-five years before her
  birth had been decreed, but no vague sense of association wakened her
  curiosity. She simply hated the one and lunched in the other. The most which
  she owed to this unrealised pilgrimage in her mother's footsteps was a change
  in her plans for that afternoon. For Derek at one moment looked at his
  watch&mdash;a proceeding sufficiently rare when he was in Lois's company to
  provoke a question. As they sat down, however, he had no thought of time.</p>

  <p>"We don't lunch together as often as is good for us," he said, "so we'll
  have a real luncheon," and he summoned the waiter.</p>

  <p>"A couple of sidecars first," he said.</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir."</p>

  <p>"And afterwards, Lois?"</p>

  <p>"Water for me."</p>

  <p>"And half a bottle of Montrachet for me."</p>

  <p>The waiter wrote on his order form and handed two copies of the bill of
  fare to them.</p>

  <p>"Never mind that!" said Derek. "We're to have a good luncheon. So we'll
  have grapefruit, a lobster Newburg, a minute steak with saut potatoes, a
  souffl surprise and coffee."</p>

  <p>Lois gasped.</p>

  <p>"We'll have nothing of the kind," she cried. "We'll have the grapefruit,
  yes, then cutlets and saut potatoes and then coffee. If you think I am going
  to increase my circumference when I'm on my way to my dressmaker, you've
  guessed wrong, Derek."</p>

  <p>It was toward the conclusion of this simple meal that Derek remembered his
  duties and looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"You are full of business this afternoon?" said Lois.</p>

  <p>"It isn't that," Crayle answered. "But Mark's got a new clerk coming."</p>

  <p>"A new clerk!" Lois exclaimed, as she lit a cigarette. "But must you be
  there to receive him?"</p>

  <p>"No. But Mark wants him to have a desk in my room for a bit. It seems he's
  important, eh? I don't know why. Mark's rather mysterious about him."</p>

  <p>"Oh!"</p>

  <p>It was an exclamation of indifference, a dismissal of the subject as a
  matter which did not concern her. But when they rose to go away, Lois said as
  she crushed the end of her cigarette in the saucer of her coffee cup:</p>

  <p>"I think I'll drive back with you. I left a strip of stuff of the colour I
  want for my dress."</p>

  <p>As they drove back they passed a clock, and Lois asked quickly, "What time
  is your new clerk expected?"</p>

  <p>"A quarter to three."</p>

  <p>Lois leaned back in the corner of the cab.</p>

  <p>"If we are not held up, you ought to be in comfortable time," she
  remarked, and she, at all events, was comfortable.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't suppose he's so important that I must stand on the mat with
  my hat off," said Derek with a laugh.</p>

  <p>It happened that there was no traffic block and they arrived at the door a
  minute or so before the time. The new clerk, however, as became a new clerk,
  was punctual to his appointment. For as Lois and Crayle, after crossing the
  big outer office, entered the corridor along which the private offices were
  ranged, he entered the outer office from the street. They heard his voice as
  he asked for Lord Thewliss and the commissionaire's reply.</p>

  <p>"You're expected, sir. Will you come this way?"</p>

  <p>Lois turned and caught a glimpse of a shortish, squarely-built man with a
  red moustache, heavy as a dragoon's. She dropped her handbag, picked it up
  quickly and without a word to Derek slipped into her own room, keeping her
  back to the corridor. Once there, she shut the door and stood with a face
  suddenly grown very white.</p>

  <p>"He couldn't have known me," she reassured herself. "It's dark in the
  corridor and he saw no more than my back."</p>

  <p>But she stood quite still and listened. She heard the solid tread of his
  feet as he passed, and then the door of Mark Thewliss' room at the end of the
  corridor shut.</p>

  <p>So Mr. Joseph Wyatt had come masquerading as a clerk to Mardyke and
  Campion's. No doubt Derek's attendance had been required, so that someone
  with especial authority might introduce Mr. Joseph Wyatt to the staff and
  give him the freedom of the big building. It was not in the nature of Lois to
  run away. She had all that confidence in her ability to meet a difficulty
  which marks the girl of her time. In any case, she must run into Mr. Joseph
  Wyatt very soon. She would meet him then this afternoon, in her own domain,
  and she sat down at her table with a curious little smile upon her face.</p>

  <p>Mr. Joseph Wyatt knew who she was. Had he not made regular pilgrimages to
  Liverpool to make sure that the Perriton family was living its own life
  without plotting to cause trouble to Mark Thewliss? And she knew who he was.
  But she had this tremendous advantage. Mr. Wyatt wasn't aware that she knew
  who he was. It would amuse her to see that self-satisfied little man twirling
  his ridiculous moustache upon the threshold of her room, perhaps asking her
  for her assistance in learning his new duties. He would without doubt be not
  a little surprised to discover her established there. Very likely he might be
  not a little suspicious. But since she knew who and what he was, there were a
  few simple precautions which prudence suggested she should take. For
  instance. She dusted the keys of her typewriting machine, and then locked the
  cover over it and then dusted the cover. She tidied her writing-table and
  carefully wiped it clean. She tore the top sheet from her blotting-pad, held
  it for a moment in doubt as to how she should dispose of it, looked for one
  second at the matchbox, for another at the grate, and finally folded it and
  hid it away in her handbag. Then she wiped the arms of her chair and the rail
  at the top. She had now finished her preparations, and hearing the door at
  the end of the corridor shut again, she drew on her gloves and set her own
  door a trifle ajar.</p>

  <p>She heard Derek speaking:</p>

  <p>"I'll show you round the building now, Mr. Wyatt, and introduce you to the
  staff."</p>

  <p>Lois slipped on her coat and hat. She must not be found in any attitude of
  expectation; she would be going away.</p>

  <p>In the corridor Derek's voice was saying:</p>

  <p>"This is my room which you are to share with me for the moment, and here
  is the office of Mr. Gregory, our manager." A door-handle rattled. "Mr.
  Gregory, may we come in?" and the voice ceased as Mr. Gregory's door closed
  upon him and the new clerk. Lois locked the drawers of her table, after
  making sure that she had left in them no letters which she had handled.
  Before she had finished the guide and his tourist were out in the corridor
  again.</p>

  <p>"This is Miss Perriton's room."</p>

  <p>"This one with the door open?"</p>

  <p>Lois stood with her bunch of keys in her hand stooping at the table, her
  face towards the door, in an attitude of easy curiosity perfectly assumed.
  But her little piece of miming was wasted.</p>

  <p>"And Miss Perriton, I understand, has nothing to do with the staff?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," she heard Derek reply. "She is Lord Thewliss' personal
  secretary."</p>

  <p>"Quite."</p>

  <p>And the two men passed on. Lois stood up with an odd little smile upon her
  face. She could not deny a sensation of relief. She was to be left outside
  the reach of Mr. Wyatt's investigations. She finished locking up the drawers
  of her table, however, and then having given time for the new clerk and his
  cicerone to branch off towards the laboratory, she walked through the outer
  office to the street and turned into High Holborn.</p>

  <p>Even then, however, she did not visit her dressmaker. It was growing dark.
  She stopped a taxi and was driven to the Church of St. James in Piccadilly.
  In a footpath by the side of this church stands a very busy post office. From
  this post office Lois dispatched a telegram, and then walked home to
  Grosvenor Square.</p>

  <p>Lady Thewliss gave a small dinner-party that night at which Derek Crayle
  was present and after which a new violinist was to play. Derek made his way
  to the couch on which Lois was sitting, and in an interval of the music he
  asked how the dress was progressing.</p>

  <p>"I didn't go to the dressmaker's at all," Lois answered. "I want a frock
  of a particular pale shade of green and I mean to see by daylight that the
  colour is exactly right. So I shall go to-morrow morning instead. And how do
  you like your new room-mate?"</p>

  <p>Derek Crayle shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"He's only temporarily with me," he answered, and he smiled. "He paid you
  a great compliment."</p>

  <p>Lois sat up in her chair.</p>

  <p>"But I haven't met him. You didn't bring him to my room."</p>

  <p>"There wasn't any reason to," Derek answered. "But after I had shown him
  round and left him to go back by himself, he forgot which was my door."</p>

  <p>"And went into my room, I suppose," said Lois with a curious smile.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I found him there. He was tremendously impressed by its
  tidiness."</p>

  <p>Lois nodded her head.</p>

  <p>"He would be," she remarked. "What time did he leave the office?" she
  asked unconcernedly, and Derek gave her the hour. It was within ten minutes
  or so of the time when she herself had reached Grosvenor Square. She had not
  been followed, then, to the post office off Piccadilly. But she could not say
  as much the next morning. She went to her dressmaker in Curzon Street at ten
  in the morning and spent the best part of an hour there. On leaving she
  walked up South Audley Street towards Oxford Street, meaning to cross the
  road to a famous store to buy some silk stockings. But she had not taken a
  great many steps before she had an odd impression that she was being
  followed. She looked about her. An errand boy was trundling along a delivery
  tricycle; a taxicab was patrolling in search of a fare. A woman was gazing
  into a shop. There was certainly no one with a dragoon's moustache anywhere
  within view.</p>

  <p>"I am ready to imagine these things," she said, chiding herself. "I shall
  develop the vapours next and go into swoons."</p>

  <p>None the less the impression persisted. She loitered, stopping here and
  there at a window. But if she was being followed it was by an adept. She saw
  no one to confirm her in her alarm. However, Lois was no half-wit herself.
  She so timed her walk that she arrived at the edge of the crossing in Oxford
  Street just as the constable was changing his position to hold up the cross
  traffic and release that going east and west. Lois had just time to sprint
  across the road before the vans and the omnibuses, the cars and the taxis
  which throng Oxford Street and mask one pavement from the other, hurled
  themselves forward like so many deadly missiles released from so many
  gigantic catapults. A glance assured her that she had been the last across
  the road.</p>

  <p>"Safety first," she said gaily to herself. "That's a very good joke," and
  she disappeared into the huge store. All the red moustaches in the world
  might bristle and twirl as much as they pleased, not one of them would glow
  brightly enough to pick her out among the customers who thronged those
  innumerable aisles.</p>

  <p>"Business first, pleasure afterwards," she said, being in an excellent
  good humour. "In the way of maxims, the copybooks have nothing on me."</p>

  <p>She dived accordingly to the basement, and only after ten minutes sought
  pleasure in the buying of the diaphanous pale-hued silk stockings which were
  to intervene between the green of her shoes and the green of her frock when
  Mark Thewliss gave his ball at Upper Theign.</p>

  <p>But the pleasure had evaporated. She thrust her hands into the stockings
  and spread them out without either criticism or satisfaction. She was
  inattentive. She took, in the end, what the saleswoman recommended. She came
  out by the door into Orchard Street, certainly with a little parcel dangling
  from a finger, and certainly too with the bitterest disappointment which had
  ever marred her lovely face.</p>

  <p>"There was a hiatus," she repeated to herself. Yes, indeed. There was a
  hiatus wide enough and deep enough to engulf for ever all her projects and
  ambitions. The tears glistened in her eyes&mdash;a rare event with Lois. Had
  she still been in the copybook mood, she might have said, "Nature abhors a
  vacuum."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch23"
     id="ch23"></a>XXIII. &mdash;THE HIATUS</h2>

  <p class="first">Mark Thewliss explained the hiatus ten days later. It was
  the morning of the first Thursday in December. On Friday his household was to
  move along to Upper Theign and stay there until the New Year was in.
  Thursday, therefore, was the day for winding up all business which could be
  wound up this side of Christmas. By twelve o'clock Mark had cleared away the
  most pressing of his problems and sent a messenger for Derek Crayle. Derek,
  upon answering the summons, found Mark leaning against the mantelshelf with
  his back to the fire, and seated on a chair facing Mark, very correct and
  prim with his feet together and a perfectly impassive face, the partner of
  his room Mr. Joseph Wyatt.</p>

  <p>"Shut the door, Derek, and take a pew," said Mark. "It is high time that I
  explained to you who Mr. Wyatt is and what his particular duties have been in
  my firm."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have been a little perplexed about them myself," said Derek, as he
  dropped into an armchair by the side of the fire-place. "But then I've learnt
  in the last month or two that you can keep secrets up your sleeve with less
  appearance of mystery than any conjurer I've ever met."</p>

  <p>Mark sat down at his table, which stood endwise against the wall on the
  other side of the grate. He had a window behind his left shoulder so that the
  light fell conveniently upon his papers, and he had the fire behind him on
  his right hand.</p>

  <p>"It's gratifying to me to hear those kind words from you, Derek," he said
  agreeably, "for every now and then I've had a suspicion that you thought me a
  damned old fool."</p>

  <p>Derek looked firmly at the head of Mardyke and Campion.</p>

  <p>"A truce to this badinage, sir, if you please."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Mr. Wyatt stared, neither amused nor surprised nor interested,
  into the fire. Occasionally he twisted one of the antlers of his moustache.
  But the gesture was meaningless. He had the look of a wax figure with an
  automatic movement.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Wyatt is not a clerk at all," Mark continued easily. "Nor was he
  engaged because he was an organiser with new methods. That was merely an
  excuse to give him a right of investigation. Mr. Wyatt is a private inquiry
  agent."</p>

  <p>"What?" Derek jumped in his chair. "A private inquiry agent."</p>

  <p>"Quite," said Mr. Wyatt, and he gave both the red horns an upward
  twist.</p>

  <p>"He is in the service of Dickson's, a highly reputable firm recommended to
  me by my lawyers."</p>

  <p>"The best firm in London," Mr. Wyatt said complacently.</p>

  <p>Derek broke in impatiently upon these testimonials. There was a time for
  bouquets, but the time was not now. Derek indeed was more than a little
  scared.</p>

  <p>A private inquiry agent meant more than a mistake, more than something
  honestly lost. There was a secret of immense value, written down on paper,
  hidden away somewhere&mdash;even he was not quite sure where&mdash;a secret
  which he had vainly implored Mark Thewliss to protect. 'What if that had been
  stolen!</p>

  <p>"I'm not doubting the status of your firm, Mr. Wyatt," he cried. "But I
  should like to know what has happened."</p>

  <p>"Something uncommonly unpleasant," replied Mark. But he was more
  uncomfortable than distressed. The injury, it seemed, was to his feelings. He
  was hurt rather than damaged. And Derek was a little reassured.</p>

  <p>Mark Thewliss rose and turned to a safe with a combination lock which
  stood in a recess behind his desk.</p>

  <p>"You don't know the combination which opens this, Derek?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Nor anyone except myself. And I change it once a month. Even Mr. Wyatt
  failed to open it."</p>

  <p>"That is so," Mr. Wyatt agreed. "But those safes have been opened without
  the help of stethoscopes or experience."</p>

  <p>"How?" asked Derek.</p>

  <p>"By chance," answered Mr. Wyatt. "The probabilities against success are
  enormous, calculated mathematically. Yet it has happened, and more often than
  you would imagine. A lucky twist to the right, another to the left, a third
  to the right again, and the tumblers have fallen into their proper places and
  the safe door has swung open. Novices have opened such doors."</p>

  <p>Derek's fear was once more whipped to activity. He watched Mark plant
  himself between the safe door and Wyatt and himself. Both of them could be
  sure by the bend at the elbow that Mark's hand was raised to the lock. But
  his shoulders hid from them his movements. Mark stood back and with a pull at
  the knob opened the thick steel door. He thrust his arm into the safe and
  brought out a long sealed envelope. Then he closed the safe again and carried
  the envelope back to the table. He showed his audience that there was no
  writing upon it at all.</p>

  <p>"This isn't the original envelope," he said. "The one which may have
  something to tell is in Mr. Wyatt's possession. This is of no importance. So
  I open it;" and tearing it open as he spoke, he removed the contents and
  tossed it on to the fire. The contents consisted of five sheets of ivory
  white note-paper, and once more Derek's alarm was quenched. For he remembered
  that the formula which Mark had brought out with him from his laboratory
  after his experiment at Upper Theign had been written out upon greyish blue
  sheets, and that there had been six of them. But his relief was not to
  last.</p>

  <p>"You'll remember, Derek," Mark explained, "that on the evening after I
  finished my demonstration I locked myself up for an hour and a half in the
  library."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"During that hour and a half I copied the various processes out in their
  order, and burnt up into minute ashes the six sheets on which they were
  originally jotted down. These five sheets are the copy," and he showed them
  to Derek. They were covered with minute handwriting and diagrams. "They are
  more compact, you see, and I enclosed them in one of these envelopes, which
  are specially made to hold just these sheets of paper flat."</p>

  <p>He took from a rack in front of him a strong squarish envelope and held it
  out.</p>

  <p>"Do you see?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Then I sealed the envelope, put it away and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And went off in your yacht for a month," Derek interrupted hotly,
  bethinking him of the ridiculous secret drawer in the library table at Upper
  Theign which stood open as often as not for all the staff and any visitor to
  see. He had himself protested on that very evening against the use of that
  drawer as a receptacle for this treasure of a formula.</p>

  <p>"And went off in my yacht for a month," Mark retorted equably, "taking
  with me the seal which I used."</p>

  <p>"There is no copy of it?"</p>

  <p>"None."</p>

  <p>"You are sure?"</p>

  <p>"Quite."</p>

  <p>Derek stared in perplexity at Mark Thewliss. The formula, the work of
  thirty years,</p>

  <p>"Those hopes and fears, surprises and delays,<br>
  That long endeavour, earnest, patient, slow,<br>
  Trembling at last to its assured result"&mdash;</p>

  <p>at dawn of a summer morning in the Berkshire hills, had been tampered
  with. Here was Mr. Joseph Wyatt to prove it.</p>

  <p>Yet Mark spoke with a level voice. There was in him none of that violent
  anger which theft even of some trivial thing arouses. There was no sign that
  he had suffered a loss. Philosophic calm was no doubt an excellent quality,
  but he, Derek, had no use for it. Derek Crayle had set his heart utterly on
  the successful exploitation of the universal formula&mdash;and not on account
  of the profit in money which would come from it. It was to be a resounding
  triumph for Mark Thewliss. Derek's liking for Mark had grown into a form of
  hero-worship, mingled with a curious form of patronage. Mark was in his view
  a great man who wanted a young man to look after him. The formula would
  spread Mark's name, give him such power in his industry as no man had ever
  held, and perhaps fulfil his ideas. Derek was not so sure that they were not
  rather fanciful. Universal peace, through universal good-humour, through
  cheap dyes, through the universal formula, was perhaps a fantastic way of
  breeding the world's great winner. But then Mark might be right. Dreamers
  often were right. Derek was set on Mark's getting his opportunity of proving
  that he was right, if he was right. And here was Mark himself only
  uncomfortable, whilst he, Derek, was boiling with exasperation!</p>

  <p>Mark continued:</p>

  <p>"About a month after I returned to Upper Theign, I brought the envelope up
  to my office here and locked it in the safe."</p>

  <p>"You ought to have sent it to the bank," said Derek reproachfully.</p>

  <p>"I know. I kept saying that myself. I said: Mark, your name's
  Ask-for-Trouble William.' But I just couldn't send it to the bank. There! I
  couldn't," and he smiled very pleasantly across the room at his young
  partner, asking for his indulgence. "I wasn't quite sure, you see, that there
  wasn't some little improvement, some little simplification in the process
  which I could make&mdash;something which would reduce the cost of production.
  So I wanted the formula at hand, near to me, so that if an idea occurred to
  me I could get it out in a second and see if the idea worked before I forgot
  it."</p>

  <p>"And you did get it out, no doubt?" Derek asked.</p>

  <p>"More than once."</p>

  <p>"And each time of course you destroyed the envelope, to make sure that if
  anyone had handled it we should none of us have a chance of finding it out,"
  said Derek, with what seemed to him the most penetrating irony.</p>

  <p>But it was lost apparently on Mark Thewliss, who replied earnestly:</p>

  <p>"No, Derek, no, I can't allow you to do me that injustice. I know that men
  in the sixties must by the nature of things be very, very foolish and
  incompetent. But I never destroyed the envelope, though I am bound to say it
  was mere indolence which made me preserve it. I broke the seal each time. But
  I opened the envelope by slipping my round pencil-case under the flap and
  carefully rolling down to the point until the flap came away. It's a
  perfectly simple process which doesn't take a minute, and it saved me the
  bother of writing out a note about the contents on a new envelope. When I
  wanted to replace it safely&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I should like to hear how you did that," Derek interposed
  meekly.</p>

  <p>"I did it this way. I put the formula back into the envelope, smeared a
  lick of gum on the inside of the flap with the gum-brush"&mdash;he pointed to
  a camel's hair brush which stood in a bottle of gum upon his
  table&mdash;"gummed the flap down and stamped a seal on it again somewhere
  else."</p>

  <p>"I should like to see that envelope," Derek remarked grimly, and Mr.
  Wyatt's left hand rose automatically to his right-hand breast-pocket.</p>

  <p>"All in good time, Mr. Wyatt," said Lord Thewliss. "Let us be
  business-like above all, and do things in their proper order."</p>

  <p>Derek gasped. There are forms of effrontery which would paralyse the most
  adventurous and strike even an orator dumb. In Derek's opinion, Mark Thewliss
  had been guilty of one of them. Derek said not a word.</p>

  <p>"Let us take the written formula first," continued Mark. "Come over here,
  Derek!"</p>

  <p>He laid the sheets flat upon the table with their edges even. Then he
  covered them with a sheet of blotting-paper. Derek crossed the room and stood
  behind his chair, looking down over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Now watch!"</p>

  <p>Thewliss moved the blotting-paper a little to the right, disclosing the
  left-hand edges of the five sheets of note-paper and a little of the edges at
  the top and bottom.</p>

  <p>"You see? Just five sheets of the note-paper I use, one above the other,
  all aligned and as they came from the stationer's shop. My handwriting, too,
  practically in a straight line from top to bottom and with each lateral line
  at practically the same distance from the edge of the paper. Is that
  agreed?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Derek.</p>

  <p>"No doubt about it," Mr. Joseph Wyatt added. But he had not moved from his
  chair in front of the fire. These details were long since familiar to him.
  But his right hand stroked and stroked his upper lip, so that while the left
  horn of his moustache pointed upwards, martial as a Kaiser's, the other
  drooped like a Chinaman's.</p>

  <p>"Good! Now let us look at the other side," said Mark, and he moved the
  blotting-paper from right to left until the right-hand edges of the sheets
  were exposed.</p>

  <p>"Do you see, Derek?"</p>

  <p>For a moment Derek didn't see. For a moment he thought: "Mark began his
  writing a little farther from the left-hand edge of the paper and ended it a
  little nearer to the right-hand edge."</p>

  <p>Then he uttered an exclamation. Mr. Wisberry, of Somersetshire, would have
  cried "By gum!" Colonel Crayle merely stuttered out a feebleness not worth
  recording. He did see now. The edge of the five sheets slanted a little from
  the top, straightened again, and towards the bottom slanted a trifle once
  more, but this time slanted inwards.</p>

  <p>"The sheets have not been cut evenly," exclaimed Derek.</p>

  <p>"And how can that be?" asked Thewliss. "They are cut by a machine, a quire
  at a time at the least. I haven't one other sheet which has the fault these
  five have. No, these right-hand edges have been pared away." And as Derek
  stooped down over his shoulder to examine them, Mark added: "And by a very
  sharp razor held in a very steady hand."</p>

  <p>"But where's the sense of it?" cried Derek. "And how was it done if the
  papers were in the envelope and the seal not broken?"</p>

  <p>"I'll show you," said Mark, and he turned to Joseph Wyatt. "Now will you
  produce the envelope, please?"</p>

  <p>Wyatt took from his pocket a small parcel. It consisted of two oblong
  pieces of stiff cardboard held together by india-rubber bands, and between
  them a wrapper of white linen. He carried the packet to Thewliss' table, and
  removing the oblongs of cardboard, laid the wrapper on the table. He opened
  it and disclosed the ivory white envelope matching in tint and in size the
  sheets of paper on which the formula had been written. The envelope was lying
  with its back upwards, the flap open and the edges of the flap rather thin
  where the pencil-case in loosening it had worn some of the paper away. There
  were three broken seals, each with Thewliss' initials intertwined to make an
  anchor and a cable. Mr. Wyatt had been careful not to touch the envelope with
  his bare hands.</p>

  <p>"I opened the envelope twice, you see," Mark explained. "And each time I
  sealed it afresh."</p>

  <p>"Here or at Upper Theign?" Derek asked.</p>

  <p>"Both times here. The last time a couple of days before Mr. Wyatt was
  called in. That last time I noticed that the edges of the notepaper had been
  shaved on the right-hand side. It was a mere chance that I noticed it. I was
  standing at this table looking down upon the sheets, rather lost in picturing
  in my mind the sequence of the processes, and my eyes must have spotted that
  tiny mutilation for some time before they telegraphed the news to my brain. I
  made sure first of all that the fault occurred only in these sheets, and in
  none of the paper bought at the same time. Then I turned my attention to the
  envelope, and I found by measuring it&mdash;I was careful to put on a pair of
  gloves first&mdash;that the envelope was a tiny bit longer between the point
  of the flap in the middle and the edge on the left-hand side than it was on
  the right-hand side. I made an experiment. The notepaper, as I told you, is
  made to fit exactly into the envelope. Well, a new sheet of paper wouldn't
  just go in flat into that envelope. It would need a tiny fold before it could
  be inserted. And here's the explanation."</p>

  <p>Thewliss put on a glove and lifted the envelope, holding it so that the
  left-hand edge was uppermost.</p>

  <p>"You see! Here's a normal envelope. There's no join or cut. It's just a
  fold of paper pressed. Now look at the right-hand edge."</p>

  <p>He turned the envelope round, and it was just discernible that there were
  two edges, not one, but joined so finely together and smeared so carefully
  with a white, thin, smooth paste which had been allowed to dry and soiled so
  neatly to shade it to the tint of the rest of the envelope that a man who had
  no reason to examine it could hardly have discovered the trick at all.</p>

  <p>"What has happened is clear," said Mark. "Someone with a very sharp razor
  has sliced off the edge of the envelope, extracted the sheets of paper
  without breaking the seal, and when his business with them was finished,
  replaced them in this ingenious way. Mr. Wyatt tells me that it was a method
  practised during the War."</p>

  <p>"During the earlier part of the War," Mr. Wyatt corrected. "It was
  detected, as, indeed, it was bound to be, fairly soon, and other means had to
  be discovered."</p>

  <p>Mark Thewliss folded up the envelope again and returned it to Mr. Wyatt.
  Mark resumed his seat.</p>

  <p>"Now we have got as far as this, Derek: there are no finger-prints on the
  sheets of paper except mine. Whoever extracted them did so probably with a
  pair of tweezers and put on gloves to handle them Mine, of course, are all
  over them. As they are on that envelope. But there are some others on that
  envelope, too."</p>

  <p>"Whose?" cried Derek, and he turned to Joseph Wyatt. "You have found
  out?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Wyatt shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No. By various ruses I have been able to get fair examples from the whole
  staff, but none of them fit."</p>

  <p>"Then we're up against it," said Derek. "At any moment we may find a
  patent taken out which will rob you of your own discovery."</p>

  <p>Mark reflected and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The thief wouldn't dare to do that. It'ld be fraud."</p>

  <p>"You couldn't prove it."</p>

  <p>"Well, we are not at the end of our efforts," Mark resumed. "Although I
  only noticed that intelligent piece of roguery a fortnight ago, it doesn't
  follow that it wasn't there for me to notice it the first time I opened the
  envelope."</p>

  <p>Derek agreed.</p>

  <p>"No, it doesn't. I shouldn't have noticed it myself. It's known, of
  course, that you have invented something which is going to revolutionise the
  dye industry. It's been known ever since July. Very likely someone was on the
  look-out. Very likely that envelope was taken from your safe and put back
  again the day after you brought it up to town."</p>

  <p>"Why not before, Derek?" Mark asked quietly.</p>

  <p>The eyes of the two men met and interchanged a suspicion. There was the
  same thought in the mind of each. Mark a fortnight ago, Derek during these
  last ten minutes&mdash;each of them had instantly selected the most possible
  culprit. And both were rather aghast.</p>

  <p>"At Upper Theign?" said Derek.</p>

  <p>"The formula was there for a couple of months," answered Mark.</p>

  <p>Again both men were silent.</p>

  <p>"There were heaps of opportunities, of course," Derek exclaimed, and there
  was a world of reproach in the cry.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>Mark accepted the censure ruefully.</p>

  <p>"Yes. You were quite right. I was a damned fool about that secret drawer.
  I am sorry. I trusted everybody."</p>

  <p>"I didn't," said Derek.</p>

  <p>"That's so. I remember." Then Mark Thewliss glanced at Mr. Wyatt. "There's
  no reason why we shouldn't use names quite plainly. Wyatt's our man."</p>

  <p>"Quite," said Mr. Wyatt.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then! Here it is!" Mark declared. "Hoyle came to see me twice
  at Upper Theign after I returned from my cruise. Once at the beginning of
  September and once towards the end of that month. On both those occasions the
  formula was in my library there. On either one of them he might have bribed
  one of my servants to get it for him. I hate to think that any of them would
  have consented. But, honestly, I can't see any other possible
  explanation."</p>

  <p>"Hoyle would only have needed the formula for a few hours," Derek Crayle
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"That's all."</p>

  <p>"And it would have been just as easy to replace it afterwards as to take
  it away before."</p>

  <p>"Quite as easy."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do, then?" asked Crayle.</p>

  <p>"I am going to ask Wyatt to come down to Upper Theign. He mustn't follow
  us at once. But with the pressure of reorganisation it'll be quite natural
  that in a few days' time he should come, bringing some important papers for
  our consideration. Then he'll stay and do what he has done here, get the
  fingerprints of the staff, discover if any of them has been spending money,
  and generally investigate the case. I think it's pretty horrible, but it's a
  necessity."</p>

  <p>"Yes, my lord, it's a necessity," said Mr. Wyatt, and he got up from his
  chair. "I shall come to Upper Theign, then, next week."</p>

  <p>They fixed upon Thursday as the day, and with a formal salute Mr. Wyatt
  marched out of the office.</p>

  <p>Derek, however, was not satisfied that the discussion should end in this
  inconclusive way. He had a question still to put and he put it.</p>

  <p>"But suppose the marks on that envelope in Wyatt's pocket were made by
  Hoyle! What then?"</p>

  <p>"There we are done to the wide," said Mark with a grin and a lift of his
  eyebrows. And suddenly in the midst of all his doubts and fears and
  speculations, Derek Crayle was turned off to a quite different consideration.
  How Mark Thewliss had changed in his appearance, in his mind, too, since that
  distant day when Tony Westram had first fetched him down to Gissens! It was
  just that grin, and that lift of the eyebrows, which had swept away the glaze
  of habit from Derek's eyes and enabled him to see acutely, poignantly.
  Compared with that good-humoured elephant trampling his way through the
  world's jungle, Mark was now a different being. His face had taken on the
  spiritual look which comes from great sorrows quietly endured. His face had
  grown thinner, longer. Derek had the impression of a clear flame burning
  behind it, illuminating it. There was something familiar in his aspect,
  familiar but quite out of keeping with this office, with the war of High
  Holborn outside its walls. One had to remember those queer ambitions of
  Mark's&mdash;the spirit of peace spread abroad through colour within the
  reach of everyone&mdash;before one could reconcile the man with the house in
  which he did his work. He looked more and more like&mdash;and Derek Crayle
  seized upon the image of which he was in search&mdash;more and more like some
  old engraving of Don Quixote.</p>

  <p>"Yes, then we are done to the wide," Mark repeated. "For we can't go about
  to get Hoyle's finger-prints," and he brought his fist down with a thump upon
  his table and jumped up from his chair. "But I'd give a great deal if that
  were so and we could be sure of it. I would! You can't imagine the relief it
  would be to me to know that not one of the people who have served me, whom I
  have tried to look after according to my lights, had become traitors and
  turned on me. Hoyle&mdash;yes, he's against me. He doesn't want new
  processes. He wants to go on in the old way. I can understand his going to
  any lengths&mdash;even to stealing my formula for half a dozen hours&mdash;if
  by that means he can beat me. But the people who are about me, my
  people&mdash;no! That makes me miserable. Yes, ridiculous as it may sound,
  actually miserable. I've got to know. Yes! It's a bad business bringing Wyatt
  down to Upper Theign to spy upon my household. It's humiliating. But I've got
  to know!"</p>

  <p>He was speaking like a man greatly troubled, greatly ashamed. The
  discomfort which the possible treachery of his servants caused him seemed to
  have obliterated altogether from his mind the enormous loss in prestige and
  fortune which the appropriation of his discovery by someone else would
  certainly entail.</p>

  <p>"And you don't mind that?" Derek cried in amazement.</p>

  <p>Mark's grin expanded. It took in all his face. It became very human and
  rather pleasantly sly. He went to the door, opened it a trifle and shut it
  again. Then he returned, a mimic conspirator, on tiptoe:</p>

  <p>"Hush!" he whispered, and he really looked like a sleuth in a melodrama.
  "I didn't say a word of this before Wyatt, because I don't want him to slack
  off and take it easy. I want to know the truth. But between you, me and the
  bedpost, Derek, I am not such a damned old fool as you take me for. There
  were six sheets of the blue paper which I brought out from the laboratory and
  showed you after dinner at Upper Theign."</p>

  <p>"Yes, six sheets. I remember."</p>

  <p>"Well, this note-paper is the same size and there are only five
  sheets."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Derek agreed. "And the handwriting couldn't well be smaller than it
  was on the blue paper."</p>

  <p>"So?"</p>

  <p>"So the thief has lost or kept one of the sheets."</p>

  <p>"No," said Mark. "Those five sheets of formula are absolutely useless not
  only to Hoyle, but to any chemist he might set to work on them. For when I
  wrote the process out in the library at Upper Theign behind the locked door,
  I omitted the important stages&mdash;the real me. They are written somewhere
  else, and where nobody except myself will ever find them."</p>

  <p>Derek Crayle sprang up and burst into laughter. He laughed with relief and
  admiration.</p>

  <p>"Who was it said that you had always something up your sleeve? So there's
  a hiatus in the formula. I might have guessed from the absence of real
  distress in you."</p>

  <p>"A hiatus!" Mark repeated. "There's a trinity of hiatuses, and I am sorry
  for the man who tries to make a coherent process out of those sheets of
  notepaper&mdash;all the wet towels between the Minch and the Solent won't
  appease his headache."</p>

  <p>And sitting down once more at his table, Mark Thewliss sealed up his
  ivory-white note-paper once more in an ivory-white envelope and locked it
  away in his safe.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch24"
     id="ch24"></a>XXIV. &mdash;EXIT MR. WYATT</h2>

  <p class="first">"My dear, I must have a clerk down here to-morrow," Mark
  announced casually at luncheon on the Wednesday.</p>

  <p>"Mark!" Olivia exclaimed in dismay. "Not to stay?"</p>

  <p>"Just for a few days&mdash;that's all. It's really necessary."</p>

  <p>"But you are shooting on Saturday and Monday and you have a dance here on
  Monday evening."</p>

  <p>"I know, my dear. But you can put him up anywhere."</p>

  <p>Olivia raised her hands.</p>

  <p>"Isn't that like a man?" she cried to the world at large. "First of all he
  wants a ball, and a shooting party at the same time. But he must have a ball,
  and there's an end of it. So his whole house is upset, except, of course, the
  rooms he uses. Then, when every arrangement is made and every bedroom
  labelled, he announces the arrival of a clerk, as if the house were one of
  those new expanding portmanteaux. We shall have to send the footman out to
  sleep in one of the cottages."</p>

  <p>"That'll do splendidly," said Mark. "You see, it's all easy. Mr. Wyatt
  won't give the least bit of trouble."</p>

  <p>And, indeed, Mr. Wyatt did not. On the contrary, he was the life and soul
  of the housekeeper's room; he made himself welcome in the butler's pantry,
  and in five minutes knew all the maids by their favourite names.</p>

  <p>"Such a one!"</p>

  <p>"A regular comic."</p>

  <p>"Fierce, I call him."</p>

  <p>Such were the admiring terms in which he was described. And Olivia herself
  was forced to admit that the household ran none the less smoothly because of
  this amiable soul with the red moustache who was always ready, when the
  office work was done, to lend a hand or crack a joke. He told the fortunes of
  the whole staff, making each one select a card and put the card in an
  envelope and hand it back to him. Then he put the card in its envelope
  against his heart next to the skin, and sat in a trance until that particular
  destiny was made clear to him. At another time he devised a most gigglesome
  game for the girls. He made them lay their hands flat on a sheet of paper and
  took the contours of their fingers with a pencil, saying, "Now if I catch any
  of you girls asleep, I shall know the size of the gloves I've got to buy
  you."</p>

  <p>Oh, Mr. Wyatt was a wag during these days, and quite the gentleman too.
  And in addition he got as fine a set of fingerprints of the staff at Upper
  Theign as man could wish for. But he was not content.</p>

  <p>There was a corner in the library at Upper Theign which Lois had annexed.
  It had a window and a radiator under the window; and a high double book-case
  set at a right angle to the wall helped to shut it off from the rest of the
  long room. With an arm-chair, a writing table and a chair adapted to it, Lois
  had pitched a little encampment here and set it out with her own treasures; a
  photograph of her mother, an ebony elephant with ivory toes, a travelling
  clock, a doll and such other paraphernalia as are necessary to a young lady
  of to-day. So that even when the house was full she was secure in the privacy
  of this little recess.</p>

  <p>Upper Theign was very full on the Sunday between the first day's shoot and
  the ball; and after tea upon that day Lois, having helped to set the guests
  who wished to play bridge at their bridge-tables, sought this corner of the
  library. There was a letter to be written to Mona at Liverpool, before
  dinner. The library was empty and only dimly lit. Lois went straight to her
  corner and, switching on the light above the table, took some sheets of paper
  from the rack. She was standing at the time, one hand extended towards the
  rack, the other resting upon her blotting pad as she leaned forward; and
  under the fingers of the hand upon the blotting pad she felt some particles
  of grit. It was as if the chimney of a power-station in London had somehow
  transferred itself to the neighbourhood of Upper Theign. She drew her hand
  sharply away, and looking down saw that the whole surface of her white
  blotting pad was thickly sprinkled with a yellow dust. And nowhere else,
  neither on the table itself, nor upon any book on the table nor upon the
  chair was there a trace of any dust at all.</p>

  <p>Lois shivered suddenly, and an odd little moan burst from her throat. Her
  heart seemed to drop dizzily from its place. Her knees shook under her so
  that for a second or two she clung to the table, swaying backwards and
  forwards over it. That little man was persistent. His persistence frightened
  her terribly. The absence of any passion in him, of any animosity towards
  her, made him in an odd way more dangerous. He was just conscientiously and
  thoroughly carrying on his trade, and it was part of his trade to run her
  down. Lois had a feeling of nausea. She trembled in a sombre ice-cold shadow
  of defeat.</p>

  <p>But she had none of her mother's acquiescence. She was a rebel. It was in
  her nature to march out forthwith against perils which had to be met. And in
  a little while she was standing upright with her mind clear. That little man
  must be swept up out of her way. After all, thorough he might be, but he was
  only a commonplace little piece of insignificance with a ridiculous big
  moustache, who knew the rules of his trade. It ought not to be very
  difficult. But whatever she did must be final. She sat down now and took her
  time. In five minutes she had come to her decision. She tore off the top page
  of her blotting sheets, carried it with its layer of yellow powder to the
  fire-place and burnt it. Mr. Wyatt was a cunning little man, too, she
  reflected. In that dimly-lit room she might very easily have done just what
  he wanted her to do, if she had not noticed the dust when she turned up the
  lamp over her table, and tipped it all into the waste-paper basket. Yes, the
  sooner he was out of her way the better&mdash;even if she had to take a big
  risk to get him out.</p>

  <p>As soon as the last of the blotting sheet was nothing but a black rag, she
  rang the bell. To the servant who answered it she said:</p>

  <p>"Robert, do you know where his lordship is?"</p>

  <p>"No, miss. I thought he was here."</p>

  <p>The door opened, however, as he spoke and Mark came into the room.</p>

  <p>"I was asking where I could find you, Lord Thewliss," Lois remarked to him
  with a smile.</p>

  <p>"That's good news," said Mark. "What can I do?"</p>

  <p>"May we have the lights up?"</p>

  <p>"Of course."</p>

  <p>He turned towards the servant, who turned on the lights by the switch at
  the door and went out.</p>

  <p>"That better?"</p>

  <p>"Much."</p>

  <p>A note of gravity in her voice alarmed Mark instantly. Somewhere there was
  a rose-leaf crumpled. That must be smoothed out at once.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter, Lois?" he asked solicitously.</p>

  <p>"I wonder&mdash;" Lois hesitated whilst an uneasy smile parted her lips.
  "Would you think me very impertinent if I asked you to let me say something
  to Mr. Wyatt in your presence?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Mark was startled. He stood and looked at her, and his face grew dark with
  anger. But no one knew better than Lois that the anger was not directed
  against her. He turned and rang the bell.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Lois in a voice of quiet gratitude.</p>

  <p>Mr. Wyatt was summoned peremptorily, and when he came he was asked to step
  forward. There was an ominous note in his employer's voice which Wyatt did
  not like at all. Nor was he at all taken by the aspect of Lois who stood very
  cold and aloof, watching his nervous approach with a pair of big implacable
  mysterious eyes. She was certainly not homey at this moment. She had never
  within his knowledge looked less homey, but she was more amazingly than ever
  a crasher.</p>

  <p>"Only," Mr. Wyatt reflected apprehensively, "I am, I fear, the one who is
  going to be crashed."</p>

  <p>And though he twirled his moustache to a most debonair angle, it was in
  the spirit of a French noble of 1790 concerned to make a comely ending in the
  collar of the guillotine.</p>

  <p>"Miss Perriton has asked me to send for you, Mr. Wyatt," said Mark coldly.
  "She has something which she wishes to say to you."</p>

  <p>"Quite," replied Mr. Wyatt unhappily.</p>

  <p>"A little petition to make, that's all," Lois explained with an appealing
  meekness.</p>

  <p>"Petition!" cried Mark, up in the air in a moment. "My dear Lois, you will
  make no petitions to Mr. Wyatt, I beg of you."</p>

  <p>"No, no, of course not," said Mr. Wyatt.</p>

  <p>"This little one&mdash;yes," Lois entreated. "You'll see how necessary it
  is."</p>

  <p>She turned back to Mr. Wyatt, and though her face smiled her eyes scorched
  him. "I am going to beg you when next you want my fingerprints to come and
  ask me for them openly. I can assure you that you are just as likely to get
  them that way as by setting traps."</p>

  <p>The attack was abrupt and more fatal because of its abruptness. Mr. Wyatt
  had expected a few carefully graduated questions. Did he suspect Miss
  Perriton? If so, of what did he suspect her? But she took his breath away and
  apparently Lord Thewliss', too. For Lord Thewliss gasped and with an accent
  of incredulity cried:</p>

  <p>"Fingerprints? Wyatt has been after yours, Lois?"</p>

  <p>"I may be wrong," Lois answered sweetly, and she described the condition
  of her blotting pad and its complete contrast with the rest of her little
  corner. "I ascribed it to Mr. Wyatt, because I could not think of anyone else
  who was likely to treat me in that&mdash;perhaps furtive&mdash;way. All the
  more I ascribed it to him, because I knew that he had been giving some
  attention to my room at Brooke's Market."</p>

  <p>"What?" cried Mark in a menacing shout. "You did that too, Mr. Wyatt?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I may be wrong," Lois went on very meekly. "I don't want to do
  an injustice to anyone. And if I am wrong, I apologise humbly to Mr.
  Wyatt."</p>

  <p>Mr. Wyatt said to himself:</p>

  <p>"That's my finish," and he contemplated Lois with a reluctant
  admiration.</p>

  <p>He knew now that no words could put so fine an edge to Lord Thewliss'
  exasperation, as words suggesting that she should make a humble apology to
  the private inquiry agent. But she had known it from the first and had used
  it at the last. He had made a bad mistake in not appreciating the authority
  this girl had with Lord Thewliss.</p>

  <p>"I might have known, too," he reflected ruefully, now that all reflection
  was too late. "Those journeys to Liverpool&mdash;my reports. I forgot the
  human element."</p>

  <p>That was the truth. He was a man of measurements and collated facts and
  records searched. He was without inspiration and curiosity. He could follow a
  trail like a dog, but the why and the object were for the dog's master.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Wyatt?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my lord, yes."</p>

  <p>"You accept Miss Perriton's statements?"</p>

  <p>"Quite, my lord, quite."</p>

  <p>"Yet I gave you, as I very clearly remember, some altogether categorical
  instructions. My staff&mdash;yes, but Miss Perriton was definitely excepted
  from my staff."</p>

  <p>"Yes, my lord. That is so."</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Wyatt?"</p>

  <p>Lord Thewliss, who had sat down in an arm-chair, stared blackly at the
  unhappy man and waited for an answer. Mr. Wyatt shifted from one foot to the
  other. The crasher had done for him. He was rolled, bowled and pitched. There
  was a sort of defence, no doubt. He had disobeyed his categorical
  instructions. Why? Because he was certain that the fingerprints upon that
  envelope with the many seals were the fingerprints of a woman. He had kept
  that item to himself. Because of his knowledge he had suspected Lois Perriton
  from the first; and his chief object in transferring his investigations to
  Upper Theign was to secure the irrefutable proof. But he had failed to secure
  it, and he would only make his case the worse now if he told what he knew. No
  one would believe him. It would be an aspersion, a slander, a mere beastly
  act of malevolence and revenge. He said:</p>

  <p>"My lord, I find myself in a very difficult position."</p>

  <p>"That I quite understand," interposed Mark.</p>

  <p>"And the best thing which, under the circumstances, I can do is to thank
  your lordship for your kindness to me over many years and to accept what I
  know must come&mdash;my dismissal from your service."</p>

  <p>He achieved a simple dignity in uttering these words which was quite lost
  upon his audience. Mark was outraged by Mr. Wyatt's impudence. Lois had
  cleared him out of her way, and he no longer existed for her at all. The only
  answer he got was a cold bow from Mark Thewliss and the words:</p>

  <p>"A car shall be ready to take you to the station as soon as you have
  packed your luggage."</p>

  <p>Mr. Wyatt departed without as much as one consoling twist to his
  moustache. The door closed upon him, and Lois, who had been standing lifeless
  as an image of wax, shook her head and moved a step or two away from the
  fire-place.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's that," she said.</p>

  <p>But she was wrong. "That" was not packed in brown paper, tied up with
  string and dispatched in quite that simple and complete finality. That was
  not by any means that. It would have been happier for everybody in that house
  if it had been. But Mark must smooth out the rose leaves.</p>

  <p>"I meant to keep you out of this sordid little horror," he said
  remorsefully, and he told her of the theft of his formula and its
  replacement. "I really did give Wyatt the strictest instructions. I meant you
  to know nothing about it at all."</p>

  <p>"Why did you want to keep me out of it?" Lois asked. She was standing
  erect upon the hearthrug with her hands behind her, looking straight in front
  of her, not at all at him.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>To Mark it was very obvious.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't because I am made of sugar, I hope, and might run away to
  nothing if I was handled."</p>

  <p>There was a note faintly hostile in her voice which distressed Mark
  enormously. She was offended; and that feeling of hers must instantly be
  exorcised.</p>

  <p>"No, of course not," he said, and was at a loss. What he wanted to say was
  that he had an intense distaste that anything ignoble should come near within
  her vision. But it was impossible that he should even begin to say it. He was
  not yet used to her. She was still the wonderful revelation. His pride in her
  still retained the fresh gloss of its novelty, and she herself was glossy and
  exquisite with the reflected sheen of it. All the more reason, therefore,
  that he must stand guard over his phrases lest some little word of tenderness
  should slip out and betray their relationship. As he watched her now, erect,
  her head thrown back, a trifle mutinous, he longed desperately to tell her
  all the truth&mdash;the truth that never must be told.</p>

  <p>He gave her what explanation he could of his orders to Mr. Wyatt.</p>

  <p>"I wanted the theft kept as secret as possible, No harm has actually been
  done. The formula was quite useless without the processes I had omitted. If I
  could discover the culprit I should be glad&mdash;yes. For one thing, I
  object strongly to anyone taking me for a simpleton," he exclaimed with a
  laugh. "But if it got known that I was looking for a thief with the help of a
  private detective, everybody in my service would have gone about imagining
  that I suspected him."</p>

  <p>There Lois might have abandoned the subject. She was safe. But she had
  none of her mother's submission to calamities which could not be remedied,
  and all her mother's courage when some great advantage was to be gained. As
  Mona had gambled years ago in Frascati's restaurant, so Lois did now in the
  library of Upper Theign.</p>

  <p>"Of course I am the one person it's most natural to suspect."</p>

  <p>"You're the last," Mark cried vehemently.</p>

  <p>But Lois would not be persuaded by his vehemence. She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"There's a great fortune in this process. I am a girl without means, a
  dependent," and then she turned her eyes upon him, and with the most natural
  assumption of anxiety searched his face.</p>

  <p>"Do you suspect me?" she asked very quietly.</p>

  <p>For a second or two after she had put her question, Lois really quailed.
  For Mark did not answer. He sat and looked at her with the strangest
  expression. He kept things up his sleeve, didn't he? She recalled Derek
  Crayle's saying about him And there he sat looking at her intently and
  speaking never a word. Was he going to say suddenly, "I don't suspect. I
  know?"</p>

  <p>Lois was frightened, and her fear grew&mdash;until he laughed; laughed
  roundly, like a man who has found a brief and excellent way out of some
  tangle where words are of no avail. He sprang up and slipped his hand beneath
  her arm.</p>

  <p>"I'll convince you that I don't suspect you, Lois." He led her across the
  room to a bookcase. He lifted his hand to a shelf on which were ranged the
  volumes of Robert Browning He took down one of them. "Have you ever read
  this?"</p>

  <p>Lois recited the title aloud.</p>

  <p>"<i>How Pacchiaroto worked in Distemper</i>? No."</p>

  <p>"No, nor Hoyle either. It's one of a great man's distressingly light
  moments. Turn to page 34."</p>

  <p>Lois turned over the leaves, and on the broad margin of the page she saw
  some minute handwriting with algebraical figures dotted in and out amidst the
  writing.</p>

  <p>"Hiatus number one," said Mark.</p>

  <p>He took her arm again and marched her to another bookcase. From a shelf he
  removed a volume and handed it to her.</p>

  <p>"<i>The Plays of Mrs. Aphra Behn</i>," Lois quoted.</p>

  <p>"Nobody but an incipient dramatist would read them willingly, and he
  wouldn't get to page 87."</p>

  <p>Lois turned the leaves and found page 87. Along the top and the bottom of
  the print the minute handwriting was repeated.</p>

  <p>"Hiatus number two," said Mark.</p>

  <p>He replaced the book and&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The other exhibit I have to show you," he announced, "is in the
  particular corner annexed, squatted upon and thereby owned by my
  secretary."</p>

  <p>He guided her towards her corner and suddenly she stopped. It was only for
  a moment&mdash;but let it be held in her extenuation, that without the third
  omitted process the formula was still of no use, still had no value. Mark
  Thewliss felt the drag upon his arm as she drew back. But he was in the mind
  to make the proof of his confidence complete. He led her into her alcove, and
  from the bookcase projecting at the side he took down a battered old school
  book.</p>

  <p>"Xenophon's <i>Anabasis</i>," Lois read.</p>

  <p>"Xenophon's a household name, of course, but only students read him, and
  any student would pass away in disgust if he saw that edition. Page 123. The
  third hiatus."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Lois.</p>

  <p>He lifted the book again on to its high shelf and brought her back to the
  fire-place.</p>

  <p>"Now, Lois! You and I are the only two people in the world who know where
  the missing stages of my universal process are to be found. Not even Derek
  knows."</p>

  <p>"Yes," returned Lois thoughtfully. It seemed that some anxiety still
  troubled her. "But with the help of the rest which we know to have been
  stolen, couldn't those three stages be discovered? I mean by some
  accomplished chemist?"</p>

  <p>Mark shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Possibly, no doubt. But, after all, I am not the only man who has been
  experimenting, and no one else has succeeded."</p>

  <p>"But it is possible," Lois insisted. That it should be possible was a very
  important point for her now that she had been let into the whole secret.</p>

  <p>"No doubt," and Mark laughed again. "Derek dins that possibility into my
  ears twenty times a day. But that's not the important thing. This is. I have
  proved to you that I don't suspect you."</p>

  <p>Again some passing shade of trouble darkened the girl's eyes and fleeted
  across her face. Then she smiled.</p>

  <p>"You have," she said.</p>

  <p>"Good! You've got to run away and dress and so have I, or we shall be late
  for dinner. We nowadays take a little more time than you."</p>

  <p>He hurried out of the room with a nod and a smile. Lois sank down into a
  chair and stared into the fire. Her mother had gambled at Frascati's and had
  lost. Lois had gambled at Upper Theign and had won.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch25"
     id="ch25"></a>XXV. &mdash;THE BALL AT UPPER THEIGN</h2>

  <p class="first">Or so it seemed. But even the cleverest of young people may
  make a mistake under the stress of a sudden panic, as Lois did on the night
  of the ball when she snapped off the electric light. The Monday was a very
  busy day at Upper Theign. There were the men to be got off to the coverts,
  luncheon to be supervised at one of the farm-houses, and the final
  preparations to be made for the ball. Neither Olivia nor Lois had any
  leisure, and by the time when a card inscribed "Lord Thewliss" had been fixed
  upon the outside of the library door to secure him a sanctuary from the
  hubble-bubble of the night, it was time for them to dress for dinner.</p>

  <p>Very soon after dinner the guests began to arrive, and it was not really
  much before midnight when Olivia felt that her duties were fulfilled With her
  mind and her eyes now free she saw that Derek was dancing with Lois Perriton;
  and she recognised with an angry reluctance that in her dress of pale green
  chiffon, with her white skin and coppery hair, her slim, tall figure and her
  lovely face, the girl did make an entrancing picture. All the more eagerly
  therefore she stopped the pair of them as they came round to her.</p>

  <p>"Derek," she said, "I want you to find Mark and see that he takes one of
  the dowagers in to supper. I'm sure that he'll get hold of a pretty girl if
  we don't watch him."</p>

  <p>Derek agreed with a sigh.</p>

  <p>"All right, Olivia." He turned to Lois. "We'll go in a little later,
  please The third dance after this one, what?"</p>

  <p>Lois saw Olivia's face harden.</p>

  <p>"Unless you ought to take in one of the guests," she suggested.</p>

  <p>"I've done my duty," he replied. "This is the first dance I've had with
  you."</p>

  <p>Lois was silent for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Make it the fourth from now," she said.</p>

  <p>Olivia was at that moment claimed for a dance. But as she danced she kept
  her eyes open. She saw Mark lead into the supper-room a matron of the
  county.</p>

  <p>"That's all right," she said to herself.</p>

  <p>She saw Derek dancing with the matron's daughter.</p>

  <p>"That's all right too," she said. "Now whom has Lois picked up?"</p>

  <p>But she could not see Lois anywhere.</p>

  <p>"And that's all right," she concluded, and began to dance with
  enjoyment.</p>

  <p>But Olivia managed her house. Mark, after supper, would clamour for a
  hefty cigar, and would seek the privacy of his library in which contentedly
  to smoke it. And Heaven knew whether in the general upset of the evening the
  fire in that unused room had been tended. So after the next dance she hurried
  across the hall to the library. The better to ensure the room's exclusion, no
  lights were to be burning in it beyond the firelight. Yet when Olivia opened
  the door, a light was burning at the very end of the room in a bay made by
  the projecting bookcases. Olivia no doubt made a trifle of noise as she
  opened and shut the door behind her. And she had just time to see a flicker
  of pale green&mdash;a dress and a satin slipper pushed back with the instep
  bent, as though someone seated in a chair was bending laboriously forward
  over some work at the table. Just for a second she saw ripples of pale green
  like sea-water in a shallow, and then suddenly there was a tiny click. The
  light in the alcove vanished. The library was in darkness but for the ripe
  glow of the fire upon carpet and rug.</p>

  <p>Olivia stood stock-still. What in the world was the meaning of that, she
  asked herself? There was no doubt who was in the alcove at the end of the
  room. But why should Lois switch off the light in a hurry&mdash;in a panic
  because she had heard the door open and shut? Olivia waited just inside the
  door, seized by an odd kind of excitement. She was expectant of she knew not
  what; and the longer she stood in the darkness and waited, the more tense her
  expectation grew. Olivia actually held her breath that she might listen the
  better. But she heard nothing; the girl in the alcove was modulating her
  breathing too, no doubt was listening to make sure whether someone had looked
  into the library and gone away&mdash;or had looked into the library and
  remained. But why? Was it possible&mdash;the question flashed into Olivia's
  mind&mdash;that Lois was not alone in that hidden corner of the house? Olivia
  had not seen Derek during the last dance. Was he there with Lois? Were they
  together, huddled in the darkness in doubt whether they were alone
  again&mdash;in a panic lest they had been caught?</p>

  <p>A cruel little smile distorted Olivia's face. For nothing in the world
  would she move now. This was her house. Youth had more of freedom in these
  days, but there were still standards of conduct. And the breach of them was
  still visited upon the woman&mdash;happily, thought Olivia. She had the right
  to send any girl packing, whoever she might secretly be&mdash;if she caught
  her amongst the vulgarities of an intrigue. The moment must come when they
  would move. Olivia stood with her fingers on the switch ready to flood the
  room with light at just the right moment. She stood with her senses so
  concentrated that the crash of a lump of coal falling from the grate upon the
  hearth startled her like an explosion.</p>

  <p>Did it startle the guilty couple in the alcove too, so that they must clap
  hands to their mouths to cover a cry? Olivia had persuaded herself that there
  were two of them now. The greater therefore was her disappointment, when one
  alone moved slowly forward into the mouth of the alcove, and looked about the
  room&mdash;Lois. Her eyes travelled to the door by which Olivia stood, her
  dress of flame-coloured taffeta relieved against the dark bindings of the
  books; and suddenly Lois stiffened. She stepped forward in a flurry into the
  firelight, and was suddenly aware that she had made a mistake which was
  fatal. For nothing in the world should she have moved and left her table as
  it was. Olivia switched on the light; and the girl and the woman stood
  watching one another like antagonists in an arena.</p>

  <p>Olivia moved towards the bay, stopped suddenly, and turned with a little
  cry of amazement at the impertinence of this girl. For Lois had started
  swiftly back as if she meant to stop her by force. Lois checked herself,
  however; and turned back to the fire.</p>

  <p>"I am alone," she said.</p>

  <p>From the spot which she had reached Olivia could see that the corner by
  the window was empty. Yes, certainly Lois was alone. Why then had Lois had
  that first quick impulse to hinder her? What secret did that corner hide?</p>

  <p>Olivia walked back to the fire-place. Now that she stood side by side with
  Lois, she could see that the girl was trembling from head to foot.</p>

  <p>"It's very curious, isn't it, Lois?" she asked.</p>

  <p>But Lois would not help her by asking in return what was curious. She
  stood with her eyes upon the red coals and suddenly she shuddered
  violently.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that I have a chill," she said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no! It's not a chill. People don't tremble like that from a chill,"
  Olivia answered coldly.</p>

  <p>Again Lois did not help her by any argument. She stretched out her hands
  and took hold of the mantel-shelf; Olivia noticed that she clutched it. She
  noted a foot upon the fender. Olivia saw that it still shook.</p>

  <p>"It's curious that a young lady so popular and so very charmingly dressed
  should hide herself away in a corner of an empty room during a dance."</p>

  <p>There was no answer.</p>

  <p>"It's still more curious," Olivia continued, "that the moment anyone else
  opened the door, she should turn off her light in a panic."</p>

  <p>Lois lifted her head.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that I can do nothing which is right," she said, and Olivia
  laughed.</p>

  <p>"I really shouldn't take that tragic tone," she answered disdainfully.</p>

  <p>She was conscious that she had the mastery of the girl who had upset the
  pleasant order of her life and made her a stranger in her own house. Lois was
  actually trembling before her; she was afraid. Olivia looked her over in her
  dainty equipment and savoured a sharp new pleasure. She was repaid for these
  months of humiliation. There she stood, decked out in her pretty clothes, and
  abjectly afraid, like a child who is going to be punished. Olivia's eyes
  narrowed and she smiled.</p>

  <p>"You can certainly do one thing which is extremely right," she said. "You
  can go back at once to the ball-room."</p>

  <p>It was a command, not a request, and it was precisely the command which
  Lois dreaded at that moment more than anything else in the world. She hadn't
  a doubt that if she obeyed and went out of the room, if the door closed upon
  her, very few seconds would pass before the light above her table in the
  corner would be burning again. Yet how could she refuse? She had a desperate
  thought of saying: "Yes, but I'll put my table straight first." It would take
  a moment only to place a book on a shelf. If the book did not belong to that
  shelf, had a definite place upon another shelf in another part of the
  room&mdash;-that might easily escape notice.</p>

  <p>"But if I do act like this, I shall call Lady Olivia Thewliss' attention
  to what I am doing. She won't understand. But she'll be puzzled and she'll
  set herself to find out."</p>

  <p>Lois could see no escape, unless chance served her. She blamed herself for
  one unnecessary blunder. She had chosen the best time, she had not a doubt of
  that. There had been a moment when she had considered waiting until the house
  was asleep and the lights out. But the danger was greater that way. Someone
  might be still awake, however late the hour. A light seen flashing from a
  window, her step heard upon the stair, the bark of a dog&mdash;and she would
  have been caught without an excuse. These minutes when Mark Thewliss was at
  supper and the room reserved for him&mdash;that had been the likelier way.
  But she had switched the light off in a panic&mdash;that was the stupid
  blunder, and she must pay for it or chance must serve her.</p>

  <p>"Well?" said Olivia. She was at her ease now, more than at her ease. Some
  little strain of cruelty, hidden even from herself until this moment, made
  her contemplate the girl's distress with a delicious enjoyment. "Are you
  going to do what I wish? I am asking nothing more from you than I have a
  right to ask."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Lois answered. "I am going."</p>

  <p>She walked slowly and reluctantly towards the door; and before she reached
  it chance played her its worst turn of all. For it was opened from the
  outside and Mark Thewliss stood upon the threshold. His face broke into a
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Why, the whole family's here, neglecting its duties," he cried, and it is
  difficult to conceive any more inopportune remark. "Ouf!" he added, dropping
  with relief into a big chair. "I'm going to smoke a very large cigar. Lois,
  will you give me one?"</p>

  <p>Lois fetched the box from a sideboard and placed an ash-tray and a stand
  of matches on an occasional table at his elbow. She hardly knew what she was
  doing, her head so span and such a fever of anxiety burned in her. Olivia had
  already moved across the room to the corner, and whilst Mark was selecting a
  cigar from the box which she held for him, she heard the snap of the light
  switch. The light was shining now down upon her writing-table. Lois replaced
  the cigar box, and returning to Mark's side, struck a match, stooped and held
  it to his cigar. And still no word was spoken in that corner of the room. But
  Lois heard the pages of a book rustle, and her heart leapt and stopped.</p>

  <p>Mark inhaled the tobacco and settled back in his chair, surveying this big
  daughter of his with delight. He had never felt so much pride in her, so much
  tenderness for her as at this last moment, before pride and delight and
  tenderness all crashed down in misery.</p>

  <p>"Do you know that Derek's searching the whole house for you, Lois?" he
  asked. "I don't wonder one little bit. There's not a girl here who can hold a
  candle to you."</p>

  <p>"Gibe, gibe, gibe," Lois returned, counterfeiting, not very successfully,
  a playful mockery. "You're jeering at me."</p>

  <p>"Not a bit of it. In that green frock you're a nymph fresh from the seas,"
  he answered, and then at last Olivia's voice broke in.</p>

  <p>She was coming across the room, holding in her hands a book from which a
  sheet of white note-paper protruded.</p>

  <p>"All the more odd, therefore," she said, "that Lois should choose this
  particular time to study the plays of Mrs. Aphra Behn."</p>

  <p>Olivia had drawn a bow at random, and she had pierced a heart. She should
  have been happy. She was appalled. For the heart which she had pierced was
  Mark's. She saw him staring at the book she held like a man who knows that
  some irremediable calamity has befallen him, and yet will not accept it. He
  stretched out a shaking hand and after failing twice to speak, whispered in a
  broken voice she had never heard before:</p>

  <p>"Give it to me! Give it to me!"</p>

  <p>Olivia put the book in his hand. He did not look at her. He looked at no
  one. There was stealth in the eager avoidance of his eyes. A stranger would
  have thought that if anyone were guilty of treachery, it was he himself. His
  fingers fumbled at the pages as though they were numbed with cold, and the
  sheet of paper fluttered down upon the floor. There it remained. There it
  might have remained for God knows how long. For Mark did not dare to touch it
  and Olivia was still held fast in a dreadful spell by the spectacle of the
  misery her words had caused. But suddenly Lois moved very swiftly. She
  stooped on a knee and picked the paper up and laid it on the open pages of
  the book before his eyes. She stood up again, very quiet, and her face like a
  white mask with a pair of burning eyes. All her agitation had gone from her.
  In the anticipation of peril she could feel her heart flutter and sink, her
  legs give beneath her as though her bones melted into water. Now that the
  peril had become actual disaster she was cold and firm as ice itself.</p>

  <p>"Of course it was a joke you were playing on me. You wanted to frighten
  me...and for a moment, upon my word, you did."</p>

  <p>The words came falteringly from Mark Thewliss' mouth, whilst his gaze
  wandered from this to that figure in the carpet's pattern. No one heard the
  door open or was aware that Derek Crayle now stood within the room. No one
  heard the door close again, for, aware at once that some grave business was
  in debate, he shut it behind him ever so noiselessly.</p>

  <p>"That's just what it was, of course&mdash;a laugh at my precautions," Mark
  continued.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"But I'm sure of it. Nothing else would be endurable."</p>

  <p>It was a prayer he was uttering, a prayer winged on a tremulous weak
  laugh. Olivia was mortified by it horribly. Here was her giant of a man
  changed into a craven. She felt that she would never get the odious scene out
  of her memories.</p>

  <p>"No," Lois repeated; and Mark lifted his eyes to her with so sharp a look
  of pain in them that it must surely bring her to her knees.</p>

  <p>But Lois would not see. The truth was out, and nothing could bury it
  again. Her life at Upper Theign was broken off to-night. She threw her
  thoughts forward and imagined them, Olivia, Mark, Derek Crayle and herself,
  sitting together at meals with the spectre of her crime a fifth at the table,
  keeping them company as they walked, making all their talk a formality and an
  effort. The pretence could not last for a week.</p>

  <p>"No. I was in dead earnest," she said.</p>

  <p>"This is your handwriting, Lois?"</p>

  <p>Mark's voice was growing stronger at last.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>Now a note of anger was heard.</p>

  <p>"You were going to sell it?"</p>

  <p>"To Hoyle."</p>

  <p>It seemed that the name uttered in so matter-of-fact a tone restored Mark
  Thewliss. He rose up from his chair and stood erect.</p>

  <p>"Face me, if you can," he cried, and catching Lois by the elbow he swung
  her round.</p>

  <p>His face was terrible in its wrath. Olivia feared that he would strike the
  girl to the ground. But Lois did not shrink from him. She turned and looked
  him in the face.</p>

  <p>"A fine return you make to me," Mark began&mdash;and broke off.</p>

  <p>He would not charge her with ingratitude, would not heap up the items of
  his kindness. He would spare himself that want of dignity. Moreover, just at
  that moment Derek Crayle thought it time to intervene. He moved forward and
  joined the little group.</p>

  <p>"Derek!" cried Mark. "You here? It's as well," and the blood rushed into
  Lois' face, and for the first time she bent her head, so that her eyes might
  not meet Derek's gaze.</p>

  <p>"Look," continued Mark, and he held out the sheet of paper to his
  partner.</p>

  <p>"Lois robbed me," he cried in a gust of anger and grief. "My stolen
  formula."</p>

  <p>And Lois in her turn struck, capping his accusation.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and my mother's stolen happiness. And my stolen birthright. And you,
  my father, robbed us."</p>

  <p>To the other three in the room the words were little less than appalling.
  They stood dismayed, confounded. Yet the young, hard voice had uttered its
  challenge without a trace of Mark's violence. Not a tremor of passion shook
  it. The words dropped one after the other icy-cold, icy-clear, and for a
  while no other word was spoken. Then with a gasp Mark Thewliss asked in a
  whisper&mdash;and how foolish and trivial the question sounded:</p>

  <p>"Then you know&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"I have known for eight years. I was just sixteen when Henry Perriton told
  me that I was your bastard. It's true," she added with a wintry smile, "that
  Henry Perriton was in a bad humour that morning."</p>

  <p>Again silence followed upon her words, but this time it did not last.
  There came suddenly a noise of voices. The door was opened, and the music of
  a dance lilted through the opening and filled the room.</p>

  <p>"It's all right! The room's lit up," a young man exclaimed as, followed by
  another youth and a girl, he entered the room. But even the most impervious
  man that ever breathed could not but have realised that something here was
  gravely amiss.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, sir," he said to Mark Thewliss. "We oughtn't to have barged in
  here."</p>

  <p>For a second or two Thewliss gazed at him blankly, and then recognised him
  for the son of a neighbouring squire.</p>

  <p>"That's all right, Hammond," he said, and managed to produce a smile.
  "Come straight in!"</p>

  <p>Young Hammond's eyes fell upon Lois.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" he exclaimed reproachfully, "I have been looking for you
  everywhere."</p>

  <p>But Derek took a step and hid Lois from him.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, old man. But Miss Perriton promised to have supper with me
  during this dance. I came here to fetch her." He had a suspicion that Lois,
  calmly though she spoke, was nearing the limits of her strength. She was very
  white. "Let us go!" he said.</p>

  <p>For a moment she stood undecided. Then he felt her hand tremble on his arm
  and cling as though she feared that she would fall. There was a look of
  wonder in her eyes, as he led her straight from the room.</p>

  <p>"That was kind," she said gratefully when they stood together in the
  corridor.</p>

  <p>"Kind&mdash;" Derek dismissed the word contemptuously. "Kindness is a word
  for acquaintances."</p>

  <p>Lois stood and gazed at him whilst the wonder grew in her eyes and the
  hardness died out of them. Her hand tightened on his sleeve and at last her
  voice broke.</p>

  <p>"Oh, thank you, Derek," she whispered, and snatching her hand away she
  hurried to the foot of the stairs and thence ran up to her room.</p>

  <p>Derek Crayle was taken by surprise. She was gone before he could stop her.
  He drove his hands ruefully into his pockets.</p>

  <p>"They've made a fine mess of it between them, old Mark, Lois and Olivia,
  too," he reflected, and he followed Lois up the staircase and knocked on her
  door.</p>

  <p>"Lois!" he called in a low voice. But he got no answer. "Lois!" he
  repeated. "You'd better come down and have some supper."</p>

  <p>But Lois was deaf to that invitation too. Derek Crayle turned the handle
  of the door, but the key was turned in the lock. He listened with his ear
  against the panel but he could not hear a sound.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch26"
     id="ch26"></a>XXVI. &mdash;DEREK MAKES A GESTURE</h2>

  <p class="first">"We must go back to our guests," said Mark; and it seemed to
  Olivia that he had aged by ten years. He walked with a heavy tread quite out
  of his character, and his shoulders stooped. Though he looked about the
  ballroom with a smiling face, he had death at his heart. This ball had been
  arranged merely to give pleasure to Lois and enhance the prestige of her
  beauty; all the tedium of preparation and disturbance had been well worth
  while on that account. And now, though the dancing went on in gaiety and
  laughter, she was hidden away somewhere, a detected thief. Mark tortured
  himself with the repetition of that word.</p>

  <p>"You must be going? So soon? It has been a wonderful evening! So glad
  you've enjoyed it. My little girl's a thief." He was afraid lest the words
  should slip out of his mouth before he could catch them back; and once or
  twice, when some departing guests looked at him curiously, finding something
  a little distracted in his manner, he almost believed that he had spoken
  them.</p>

  <p>Olivia was in hardly a better case. She knew very well that Mark was
  stricken to the dust and she took herself to task for her jealousy.</p>

  <p>"I was a beast to that girl," she reflected remorsefully. "If I could hurt
  her a little, I was happy. I should have made a friend of her."</p>

  <p>But what was the use of these reproaches? The dreadful thing had happened.
  Oh, would the night never end?</p>

  <p>It ended, of course. The last carriage drove away, the last visitor
  retired to his room. Mark, Olivia, and Derek Crayle were left standing
  together in the empty ball-room.</p>

  <p>"I am very tired," said Mark. "We will talk to-morrow. To-night I must
  sleep if I can."</p>

  <p>He went wearily out of the room. Olivia followed him with her eyes until
  he had disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Derek," she said, "this is the end of Upper Theign," meaning the end of
  their pleasant, wholesome, equable life in that big manor house which had
  been built for comfort rather than for display. Mark had built for himself a
  dream-palace upon its foundations, and they had not borne its weight.</p>

  <p>"Don't you believe that, Olivia!" Derek returned.</p>

  <p>He had the confidence of his years and his epoch. Those kindly old ones
  had made a mess-up, the dear things. He would have to jump in and put them
  wise in the morning.</p>

  <p>"You go to bed, Olivia," he said. "Let us never forget that things are not
  what they seem and that the darkest hour comes before the dawn. Off you
  go!"</p>

  <p>He bustled her up to her room and went to his own. He drew up the blind
  and saw a great oblong of yellow light thrown out upon the snow of the lawn.
  Lois was still awake then, for the light came from the window of her
  room.</p>

  <p>"She has had no supper either," he said to himself.</p>

  <p>"That won't do."</p>

  <p>He sat for a moment or two upon the edge of his bed, troubled by a very
  disturbing conjecture. Then he went out into the corridor. The whole house
  was in darkness, and silent as a church. He went down into the hall,
  switching the lights on as he went. He saw that the front door was locked and
  the door of every room upon the ground floor which had a window opening on
  the park, and he took the keys away with him upstairs.</p>

  <p>"If anyone wants to catch an early train in the morning," he said, "they
  must first ask my permission&mdash;and I shan't give it;" and with that he
  tumbled into bed and went to sleep.</p>

  <p>There were, however, no very early departures planned On the other hand,
  no one overstayed the reasonable hour, and by ten o'clock Olivia had said
  good-bye to the last of her visitors. She asked her butler, then, where his
  lordship was to be found, and on receiving his reply hurried in a panic into
  the dining-room where Derek was eating a late breakfast.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you can sit there&mdash;munching!" she exclaimed, wringing her hands
  over the callousness of the world.</p>

  <p>"I never munch," Derek uttered with dignity, as he helped himself to
  another plateful of kidneys and bacon. "I eat."</p>

  <p>"Do you know what Mark's doing?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly. I let him out of the house this morning, since he was up
  earlier than the servants. He's out with a keeper and a dog."</p>

  <p>"And a gun;" Olivia shot the word at him with a tragedienne's
  intensity.</p>

  <p>Derek shook a forefinger at her.</p>

  <p>"Now don't go off at the deep end, Olivia! I know what you're thinking and
  it's absurd. Keep tight hold of your wits, my dear. Mark's not that kind of
  man. Have some coffee and I'll instruct you in the ways of life."</p>

  <p>Olivia allowed herself to be placed at the table. She drank some coffee.
  She was a little comforted. If Derek was easy in his mind, perhaps she was a
  little fanciful. But she looked out upon a sheet of bright white snow studded
  with black trees, and she imagined a scarlet patch on the snow and a body
  amongst the trees.</p>

  <p>"Instruct me then!" she cried; and Derek expounded his thesis.</p>

  <p>"When a woman's seriously distressed, and wishes to take her mind off her
  troubles, she goes out and buys a new hat, doesn't she?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;it's one of the ways," Olivia conceded.</p>

  <p>"It's the usual way," Derek asserted.</p>

  <p>"Very well."</p>

  <p>"Men, on the other hand, like old hats. They fit their heads better. They
  buy new ones with reluctance."</p>

  <p>Derek helped himself stodgily to marmalade.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Derek, go on!"</p>

  <p>"When a man's seriously distressed and wishes to take his mind off his
  troubles, he gets a gun and kills a bird. And that's what Mark's doing now.
  It shows a curious divergence in the points of view of the two sexes to which
  philosophers might well devote some of their attention."</p>

  <p>"You think Mark has really gone out shooting this morning?" cried Olivia.
  Her fears were assuaged, even if her scorn of an utterly pachydermatous and
  insensible world was increased.</p>

  <p>Derek nodded.</p>

  <p>"You didn't think that he would just sit at home grousing, did you,
  Olivia?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't anyway think that he would just go out pheasanting," said
  Olivia, and Derek smiled with a smile of patronage.</p>

  <p>"A play upon words! A conceit! Capital, Olivia&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't be such an ass, Derek!" Olivia broke in.</p>

  <p>Derek pointed to the window. Across the snow from the wood at the edge of
  which the laboratory stood, Mark, with his gun in the crook of his arm and
  his Labrador at his heels, was approaching the house, and behind him walked
  the keeper with a couple of pheasants dangling from his hand.</p>

  <p>"Bad man!" said Derek.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Two hens."</p>

  <p>"They're his, anyway."</p>

  <p>Derek groaned aloud.</p>

  <p>"And the Greeks made a woman the deity of sport!" he cried. He was
  incredulous. He was amazed.</p>

  <p>There was amazement, too, in the look Olivia stole at him across the
  table. His flippancy actually disturbed her.</p>

  <p>"I thought&mdash;" she began, and stopped.</p>

  <p>"Tell me your thought, Olivia?"</p>

  <p>Derek retained the mock pomposity of manner, but his voice was suddenly
  wary.</p>

  <p>"I thought you were rather fond of that wicked girl." She had dropped in
  the epithet in order to stir him into some revelation, but she failed
  completely of her object.</p>

  <p>"When the proper time comes, Olivia," he said easily, "I shall leave you
  in no doubt as to whether I am or whether I am not. Hallo!"</p>

  <p>He looked towards the window. For he heard the whirr of an engine and a
  moment later, a motor-car passed the window and drew up at the door. It was
  precisely at that moment that Mark Thewliss entered the room and poured
  himself out a cup of coffee.</p>

  <p>"I thought they had all gone," said Derek.</p>

  <p>"So they have," Olivia returned, and Mark explained.</p>

  <p>"That car has come for Lois. She telephoned to Newbury for it early this
  morning," he said.</p>

  <p>"She is going?" Derek asked.</p>

  <p>An intense relief suddenly possessed Olivia. Lois was going of her own
  accord, and these men of Olivia's were taking her departure very sensibly
  with their quiet voices and placid words. She had probably troubled herself
  needlessly. Upper Theign might again become the comfortable, smooth place it
  once had been.</p>

  <p>But Mark did not answer Derek's question.</p>

  <p>"I have asked her to see me," he said, and Olivia interrupted quickly:</p>

  <p>"Is that worth while?"</p>

  <p>"It's necessary if I am to have one untormented hour from now on until the
  day I die," Mark returned with a quiet simplicity of manner which stamped his
  unusual words with the very seal of truth. "I haven't slept at all. I have
  been going over and over again all the words which were spoken in the library
  last night, and all the looks which went with them."</p>

  <p>"Her words! Her looks!" cried Olivia on the edge of despair. Mark was
  still then under the spell!</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course," he replied. "Her words, her looks," and Olivia was
  spurred to a sudden burst of violence.</p>

  <p>"She stole, Mark. That's the simple truth. There was some high-flown talk
  about her birthright&mdash;" The word "rubbish!" was on Olivia's lips as her
  comment, but she substituted a milder one. "Excuses! She stole, and for
  money."</p>

  <p>Mark winced visibly, but his sleepless night had not been wasted in
  cozening himself.</p>

  <p>"No doubt," he said, "but from an enemy. It was an act of war. And I have
  got to know why. I am the enemy. Ever since I have known that I had a
  daughter, Lois, I have tried to make her what amends I could. She had no
  reason to think she wasn't safe. Of course Perriton's disclosure&mdash;it's
  clear that he broke his word in a fit of anger&mdash;must have been a shock,
  may well have made her feel&mdash;what shall I say? A little&mdash;to put it
  at the worst&mdash;a little tainted compared with her friends. But she's not
  the weak kind which would let that prey on her for long. She hasn't got what
  we call nowadays an inferiority complex. Not a bit of it," and even in that
  hour of his distress there was the shadow of a smile of pride upon his face.
  "The knowledge that she was really my daughter, and that I was doing my best
  after I had found it out, to make what reparation was possible wouldn't turn
  me into the enemy I am, the enemy against whom all tactics are justified, the
  enemy outside the pale. No, there's something more which I don't know, and
  I've got to know it."</p>

  <p>He reached out his hand to the bell-button upon the table as Derek, having
  finished his breakfast, lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"I'll see her now, I think."</p>

  <p>"In the library?" Derek asked`</p>

  <p>"Yes.</p>

  <p>But before he could ring the bell the door was opened. Both Olivia and
  Mark were sitting with their backs to it. But Derek across the table laid his
  cigarette down and the odd look of suspense which showed in his face made the
  other two turn round. Lois had not waited for the summons. She was there in
  the room, now. She was dressed in a warm brown jacket and skirt with a
  jumper, but she had left her coat and hat in the hall. She had put a little
  colour on her cheeks and lips and she was trying to carry off her humiliation
  with a rather pitiful bravado.</p>

  <p>"My judges!" she said, and she made a foolish little mock obeisance and
  sought to produce a jaunty smile. But as a performance it was lamentably a
  failure.</p>

  <p>"Judges," Derek repeated. "Speaking for myself, I'll show you about
  that."</p>

  <p>No one in the room had a notion of what he meant to do, not even Lois.
  Indeed, she braced herself against an attack. He rose from his chair very
  deliberately, walked round the corner of the table straight to her, and
  taking her face between his hands, kissed her upon the mouth. It made an end
  of Lois' jauntiness and bravado. She uttered a sharp cry of pain and dropping
  on to a chair beside the door as though her knees gave under her, she covered
  her face with her hands. There she sat for a little while. Then she stood up
  and, turning to Mark, said, and now very quietly:</p>

  <p>"You wanted to see me before I went away."</p>

  <p>"We'll go into the library," said Mark, as he got up from his chair; and
  Lois opened the door again.</p>

  <p>"I, too," said Derek.</p>

  <p>The girl paused. She did not look at Derek. She looked anywhere except at
  him. But she stood quite still. In the end, however, she uttered no
  objection, and she followed Mark into the hall. Olivia was left alone with
  her dream that the old life would be resumed at Upper Theign and this
  nightmare interval forgotten, splintered to fragments.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch27"
     id="ch27"></a>XXVII. &mdash;FATHER AND DAUGHTER</h2>

  <p class="first">Derek Crayle was well aware that both Mark and Olivia would
  have liked to have brained him with an iron mace, if any such weapon had been
  handy at the moment. He had sought to lighten the tension by a display of
  humour, but he had been too facetious for the occasion; and had he been
  concerned to analyse himself, he would have been quick enough to understand
  that he himself was labouring under that very stress which he was seeking to
  alleviate.</p>

  <p>But he was not concerned with himself. Lois' statement of her relationship
  to Mark had explained to Derek the secret of Mark's devotion to the girl, and
  he understood that unless the tangle was unravelled, Mark would really be
  crippled for the rest of his life. He would be hampered like a soldier in the
  early days of surgery by a wound which would not heal. Lois herself too was
  in no better case. He was certain that hers was not an ordinary crime of
  theft which could be settled out of hand by a magistrate's court. She had
  been warped by Henry Perriton's disclosure; it had preyed upon her,
  distorting her vision, impairing her standards. Possibly there was something
  more which he did not yet know, as he intended to. He was undoubtedly very
  unpopular, but he followed Mark and Lois into the library with an undaunted
  step.</p>

  <p>For if Lois had her luggage hoisted upon the hired car and drove off into
  mists and emptiness, he too was crippled. It was odd and rather hatefully odd
  that a slip of a girl one had never heard of should just be about the house
  for a month or two and leave two quite valuable people crippled if she went
  away again. But since the fact was so he must put a stop to it. He was
  confident that he could. He was of his day, not over-much hampered by
  tradition, and certainly not the spineless idler supposed to be typical of
  his generation. But he lived on a very mountain of self-confidence. He would
  encourage Mark to have his say and Lois to have hers and then he would step
  in and sort all out in its due proportions.</p>

  <p>He took a seat apart therefore by one of the bays of the library, whilst
  Mark stood with his elbow on the mantelpiece and his eyes looking into the
  fire, and Lois a few steps away from him upon the hearthrug.</p>

  <p>"I want you to sit down, Lois," said Mark gently. "I don't want you to go
  away like this to somewhere where I shall never know what's happening to
  you."</p>

  <p>"Will that matter?" Lois asked.</p>

  <p>"Very much."</p>

  <p>Mark spoke almost in a whisper, for he feared that if he raised his voice,
  it would break upon his words.</p>

  <p>"I have no plans beyond going," Lois replied and she looked over to the
  window eager to end this ordeal, to sever herself altogether from this house
  and its associations and disappear across the white carpet of snow into the
  frosty mist of December.</p>

  <p>"Still stay for a moment," Mark urged and he raised his face towards her.
  It was so ravaged by pain and distress, it deepened his request into so
  urgent a prayer that Lois could not but yield to it. But she yielded very
  reluctantly and with a great perplexity in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I don't see why you should wish to say one word more to me as long as you
  live," she returned quietly, and she sat down in one of the great chairs by
  the fire. But she balanced herself upon the edge of it, leaning a little
  forward, like one who has no right to be seated there at all.</p>

  <p>"I believe there's some terrible misunderstanding, which, unless we
  unravel it now, will never be unravelled at all," said Mark, "and I shall be
  tortured by it for the rest of my life."</p>

  <p>Though he spoke with a sincerity so unforced and simple that only one out
  of a thousand could have doubted it, that one was there opposite to him. Lois
  disbelieved and her face hardened.</p>

  <p>"Torture is a big word," she answered.</p>

  <p>"A true one," said Mark.</p>

  <p>"But there can't be a misunderstanding," Lois cried. "It's all as clear as
  daylight. I tried to steal from you and you caught me. You can send me to
  prison, or you can let me go."</p>

  <p>A little cry broke from Mark Thewliss as the hard young voice spoke of
  prison and Derek moved suddenly in his chair. He was sitting behind Lois, and
  though she could not see him she heard the movement, and lifting up a hand
  she said in a low voice,</p>

  <p>"Oh! Don't, don't!"</p>

  <p>She must keep Derek altogether out of her thoughts, until she was free of
  the house, and no one could see the tears fall from her eyes. Otherwise her
  endurance would break. He must be very silent, very still. But she had
  betrayed herself. For both the men the hard crust of her manner was shown to
  be nothing more than the film with which nature covers a wound. Mark took a
  little comfort from the cry.</p>

  <p>"You tried to steal from me?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"For yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Partly. I mean&mdash;of course." Lois threw up her hands as she caught
  her first word back. "What's the use? We just hurt one another more and
  more."</p>

  <p>"We've got to do that, Lois," said Mark. He seated himself in a chair on
  the other side of the hearth. "It will make it easier for you to tell me
  about yourself, if I set you the example. We are neither of us of course free
  from blame. Neither of us perhaps quite so blamable as we should appear to
  people who don't know anything about us."</p>

  <p>And Derek in his corner thought that Mark showed a very pretty dignity in
  thus putting himself at once on the same level as Lois.</p>

  <p>"That you reproach me," Mark continued, "was last night, to use your own
  words, clear as daylight. That you have reason to reproach me I don't deny.
  You used some words last night. Your stolen birthright. I must plead guilty,"
  and there was heard a little protest from the girl, as though she regretted
  in the face of this confession the unclothed words which she had used. "Yes,
  but since I am in the dock," Mark resumed with the ghost of a smile, "I plead
  one thing in extenuation. I have tried to make amends ever since I knew you
  were my daughter."</p>

  <p>But those words, so obviously intended to melt his daughter to a like
  frankness, did nothing but harm. There had been a pleasant touch of grace in
  the discomfort with which Lois had been listening to the apology of a man so
  much older than herself. For it was in that light only that she regarded him.
  He had acquired in her thoughts none of the tender associations of a father.
  But even that sign of grace vanished from her now. The very hardness of the
  frozen ground outside the window had its counterpart in her aspect and her
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Indeed?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. For I had not one suspicion that I had a daughter at all until your
  mother told me of you in this room."</p>

  <p>He saw her body stiffen and her eyes widen in amazement&mdash;amazement at
  his effrontery.</p>

  <p>"You don't believe that," he said.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"It is most important that you should."</p>

  <p>"How can I?"</p>

  <p>What could he plead? His tenderness to her, his care for her enjoyments
  and comfort, his pride in her during these last months? But if resentment had
  blinded her to them, if the little which she may have noticed were set down
  by her to the account of a forced repayment, of what avail were they at all?
  The plea would mean just one more profitless humiliation for him.</p>

  <p>"How can I prove it?" he cried, tossing up his hands in a gesture of
  despair. "I can't. But&mdash;" and he hesitated. But they had come to such a
  pass that the most sacred reticences must go down in their imperious need.
  "But I think your mother would tell you that what I am saying is true."</p>

  <p>Lois flinched as though he had struck her. How she should meet her beloved
  mother was one of the questions she wanted to reserve until she was alone,
  and Upper Theign a thing of the past behind her. She had meant to hear no
  word about her mother from the man who had spoilt her mother's life.</p>

  <p>"She might&mdash;yes," Lois agreed. "She would take the kind view. But,
  you see, my mother doesn't know what I know."</p>

  <p>Suddenly Mark leaned forward. He was looking for the key to her conduct.
  He would not believe that a mere passion for money, even a mere resentment
  against him, had persuaded her so far as theft. There was a secret she was
  holding back. Any word of hers might let it slip.</p>

  <p>"What do you know, Lois? Tell me! Tell me!"</p>

  <p>For a moment Lois seemed a little less positive. What she knew was
  shameful to Mark Thewliss. Yet he urged her to tell it. He was all eagerness
  that she should tell it. There was not a hint of apprehension in his manner.
  He might have been innocent of what to her was the worst part of the whole
  business.</p>

  <p>"I had just left school when Henry Perriton told me that I was your
  daughter," she explained. "I wanted thirty pounds for a course of shorthand
  and typewriting, and I went to his office to borrow the money from him. We
  were poor and I meant to pay it back. But he was in a bad mood that morning
  and he blurted out who I was. But that wasn't all. He dragged me to the
  window and pointed out to me on the pavement opposite your agent Joseph
  Wyatt."</p>

  <p>Mark Thewliss started, but it was only with surprise.</p>

  <p>"Perriton had identified him?"</p>

  <p>"He told me that Wyatt came up to Liverpool four times a year to keep an
  eye on us."</p>

  <p>"That's true."</p>

  <p>"True? You admit it?"</p>

  <p>Lois stared at Mark in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Well then...You see."</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>Mark Thewliss was apparently as perplexed as she. Certainly he betrayed
  none of the discomfort which a man detected in some ignoble precaution might
  be expected to feel. He was either the perfect actor or&mdash;but no, she
  couldn't be wrong.</p>

  <p>"I see nothing except some dreadful mistake which has preyed on you, Lois,
  and warped your life."</p>

  <p>Lois shook her head.</p>

  <p>"There could be only one reason why Joseph Wyatt was spying upon us in
  Liverpool. Henry Perriton gave it to me that morning."</p>

  <p>"Perriton indeed!" cried Mark in a swift burst of anger. "What more harm
  did he do that day?"</p>

  <p>"There could be only one reason," Lois repeated steadily. "You were
  thinking of marrying when you sent Wyatt first of all, weren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. That was why I sent him."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. You knew who I was, you knew about us, that we were poor people.
  You wanted to be sure that we weren't going to trouble you after you were
  married."</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Mark sprang up from his chair. His mouth dropped. He gazed at the girl
  below him in her chair, as though he could not believe his ears.</p>

  <p>"I sent Joseph Wyatt on his journeys to the North to make sure that you
  weren't between you planning to blackmail me? You thought that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;" Mark's voice changed. It lost its high note of protest. It
  sank to gentleness.</p>

  <p>"And you think that, Lois?"</p>

  <p>As once before, during that interview, her self-control broke up.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she cried aloud in a wail of distress. "I did think it
  when we came into this room. Now I don't know."</p>

  <p>For a moment he laid his hand gently upon her shoulder. "I shall tell you
  why I sent Joseph Wyatt."</p>

  <p>Lois nodded her head and Mark resumed his seat. He began to tell her of
  his visit to Tony Westram at Gissens, of his drive back to London, with the
  thoughts of marriage and a country seat in his mind, of the sudden impulse
  which had made him drive to Ely Place and make sure first that all was well
  with Mona Lightfoot. It was a difficult story to tell to Mona's daughter, and
  in the telling of it Mark was even more uneasy than he needed to be. He was
  unconsciously missing something which would have helped him and made more
  smooth the flow of his words. But Lois knew what it was that he missed.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" she said, and she stood up.</p>

  <p>Her movement was hardly deliberate. She wanted to hear his story in all
  its details, and the habit of months asserted itself&mdash;the habit of
  looking after the little things which made for his comfort and helped him
  through the puzzles of his work. She went to a side-table, chose a cigar for
  him from a box of big Cabanas, snicked the end with a silver cutter which lay
  beside the box, and carried it over to Mark.</p>

  <p>"I'll light it for you," she said, and she struck a wooden match and held
  it to the cigar whilst Mark drew at the tobacco until it was evenly alight.
  Then she returned to her chair. The tiny incident struck Derek in his corner
  as oddly significant, because it was so natural, so unpremeditated. Even in
  the midst of this crisis, when father and daughter were pitted against each
  other, the customary routine of life had had its way. Lois had done this
  little service a hundred times. Neither she nor Mark found anything strange
  in its repetition despite the utter change in their relationship. Neither
  indeed seemed to notice it at all. It was not a concession on her part. It
  was hardly an interruption for him.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Lois, and Mark with a greater ease found the words he
  needed.</p>

  <p>"When Wyatt brought me word that Mona was married and had a daughter," and
  the ghost of a smile flickered over his face, "a crasher, he called you, not
  homey, not his type, but a crasher, I understood that there was nothing for
  me to do but to stand aloof and help if I could. There wasn't much I could
  do. I put a little business in Perriton's way. I could and would have put
  more, but he didn't welcome it, and since every time Wyatt returned he was
  confident that your mother was contented and happy."</p>

  <p>He broke off as he saw the look of pain which gave suddenly to Lois' face
  the very aspect of a tragic mask.</p>

  <p>"He told you that!" she exclaimed breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"That my mummie was happy!"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And you believed it!"</p>

  <p>The amazement in her voice grew louder upon every word.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I did. Wasn't I right? Oh!" and his question ended in a moan of
  anxiety.</p>

  <p>"Right!" cried Lois. "If twenty years of patient misery mean happiness,
  then my mother was happy."</p>

  <p>Mark Thewliss was aghast. He had been accustomed to preen himself a little
  over his supervision of Mona Lightfoot's life. Not many men, he would say to
  himself, would have taken so much trouble. But it was well worth while since
  it brought to him once a quarter the comfortable assurance that all was well
  with her. Now his complacency was shattered. He had been feeding on Wyatt's
  lies.</p>

  <p>In his distress he caught at another's evidence.</p>

  <p>"But your mother herself told me in this room, when she brought you here,
  that her life had been wonderful."</p>

  <p>A tender smile softened Lois' face and restored to it its beauty. "I bet
  she did," she answered, and the warmth of her heart and all her pride was in
  the cry. "You knew my mother. She would have died rather than admit to you
  that she had suffered because you&mdash;" She stopped to find a phrase which
  would not bite too savagely, "because you let her go," and try as she would
  she could not keep the bitterness out of her voice.</p>

  <p>There was silence for a little while in the room and then Mark in a voice
  of compunction and abasement whispered:</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Lois."</p>

  <p>"I will."</p>

  <p>It was right that he should know. People couldn't utterly spoil her
  mother's life and get away with it, untroubled and self-satisfied. No,
  indeed! Lois lifted the blinds of Glebe Villa in Acacia Grove, and revealed a
  mean, drunken little man with a cheap gift of sarcasm, and a silent woman
  held to perpetual penance by the threat that the daughter would be told of
  the stigma on her birth. Lois made a good showman that morning. The sordid
  wretchedness of that household in a back street of Liverpool lost none of its
  asperity in the telling.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to be free of it, because I wanted my mother to be free of it,"
  Lois exclaimed. "Oh, how she had put up with it all those years, I couldn't
  imagine! Her courage, her patience! And it was all for my sake! I wanted to
  make a little home for her, to take her away very far from Acacia Grove,
  where we could live together&mdash;oh, like people in a fairy-book."</p>

  <p>Lois had quite forgotten herself. She kindled to that old sweet dream of
  hers as though it were still untried and fresh.</p>

  <p>"And I was seeing my way," she went on, "all through the War I was saving
  money. In a very little while I should be able to say 'Come to me!' But with
  the end of the War, the crash came for me," and the light died out of her
  eyes, and the tender smile turned to bitterness. "I had a year of
  disappointments. My savings were going and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mark finished the sentence for her.</p>

  <p>"And Hoyle came to you with his inducements."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"So that was it."</p>

  <p>Mark had got the secret now, and so vast a load was taken from his heart
  that only then did he understand how deep it had thrust him down.</p>

  <p>"It was for your mother, then," he cried, and he shook himself like a man
  set free. But the very relief in his voice was a warning to the girl. She
  must be wise now for him, for herself. He must make no more pretty images of
  a dream daughter. He should have the whole truth of her so far as her
  self-knowledge enabled her to give it.</p>

  <p>"Not altogether for my mother's sake," she corrected. "No! I was thinking
  of myself too. I used a foolish phrase last night about my birthright. You
  remember! Well, that had been in my thoughts for a long time&mdash;ever since
  I took a holiday a year and a half ago. I hadn't troubled about it before.
  But I went to Venice. It was my first real holiday. The first time I had been
  abroad, and I was taken by some friends to that magical city. For me it was
  day upon day of wonder and&mdash;yes, I'm not frightened by the word&mdash;of
  rapture. But after a while a shabby little thought began to spoil my
  enjoyment. Everyone I met seemed to come there each year as they chose. For
  me it was once and perhaps never again or only after an interval of years. Do
  you understand? I began to blame you, not on my mother's account as I had
  done, but on my own."</p>

  <p>Lois was putting her case crudely, cruelly, as she could not but see from
  the distress upon Mark Thewliss' face.</p>

  <p>"You see, it would have been my birthright to have gone there and to the
  other joyous marvellous places, had&mdash;well, had you married my mother
  instead of leaving her to be wasted with Henry Perriton. There was one day in
  particular. We went in a large party down the lagoon to Chioggia, and on the
  way back picnicked under the stars on another little island whilst some
  Italian sailors sang to us. The warmth of that night, the trembling little
  lanes of starlight on the dark sea, the music, the joyous friendliness of
  everyone&mdash;it was a revelation of loveliness, but of loveliness
  embittered by the thought that such loveliness was really a right of mine, of
  which I had been cheated."</p>

  <p>She saw Mark wince as she uttered the word.</p>

  <p>"Yes! It sounds horribly ignoble to me now," she went on. "But there it
  was. I had that envy of my friends, that resentment against"&mdash;and she
  dropped her voice to a whisper&mdash;"against my father. There was another
  night, my last night. A great singer sang to Venice in the Piazza late at
  night. It was&mdash;unimaginable. The big exquisite square filled with people
  all silent and spellbound, a moonlit sky overhead, St. Mark's cupolas at the
  end and the singer's voice soaring above the moan of the violins&mdash;oh, I
  can remember it now as sheer beauty. But then I thought that I was going home
  to-morrow to tramp from office to office in the search for work. I, Mark
  Thewliss' daughter."</p>

  <p>Behind her Derek Crayle had suddenly a vision of that square and of a
  girl's face that grew wistful and utterly sad, and of a pair of eyes which
  filled with tears, as the last notes of Ada died upon the air. He had often
  wondered what bitter recollections had brought that unforgettable look into
  Lois' face. As for Mark, he could only repeat:</p>

  <p>"I didn't know you were my daughter. I didn't know!"</p>

  <p>But he could have known, if only twenty-five years ago he had not been so
  careful to give a wide berth to the Dean's Elbow. And the knowledge that he
  could have known was staring at both of them. But there was a truth still
  harder for Mark to listen to; and though it was spoken reluctantly and in a
  voice which had now grown gentle and without a note of resentment, the words
  struck the more sharply on that account.</p>

  <p>"You see," she continued, and broke off, "I don't think I can tell you.
  It's all done with now. Let it lie, please."</p>

  <p>But Mark would not.</p>

  <p>"I must know," he said obstinately.</p>

  <p>"I never meant to say a word of this."</p>

  <p>"Better to say it than to let it rankle unsaid."</p>

  <p>"Very well. But it's difficult."</p>

  <p>She paused, seeking words which would express her meaning and yet wrap it
  round with the seemliness which befitted a girl speaking to her father. For
  in this half-hour her heart had softened to him. But they were both in such
  dire straits that there were no words of the kind she wanted, no minimising
  twists of phrase, no suggestions but were liable to be misunderstood. She had
  to lay bare her thought as simply as she could.</p>

  <p>"I thought that we had both, my mother and I, been deprived of our places
  in the world because you were in a hurry. You must have everything yourself,
  and as quickly as possible. You wouldn't marry my mother, wonderful though
  she was, because you must marry in the world of greater opportunity. You
  couldn't be content to leave that to the second generation. For that's the
  way the great families are built up, isn't it? Gradually, generation by
  generation, each one like people on a snow-slope, treading down the snow and
  making it firmer for those who followed. The way of nature. But no, you
  wouldn't have that. It must all be done within your single lifetime, and so
  my mother and I must go to the wall."</p>

  <p>The indictment was not to be denied. Mark Thewliss bent his head before
  it. He had no answer, and silence descended upon the room. For a little while
  he stared into the fire. Suppose that he had shut his eyes and his ears and
  his heart to his consuming passion for the sensation of power! Suppose that
  he had repaid Mona Lightfoot for the sacrifice of herself with what he had to
  give! He speculated upon the different life which would have been his with
  Lois his acknowledged child and woke to wonder whether the speculation was a
  treachery to Olivia or no. He woke, too, to see that Lois was standing
  up.</p>

  <p>"So I tried to steal from you," she said, and she took a step towards the
  door.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch28"
     id="ch28"></a>XXVIII. &mdash;AND THE TERTIUM QUID</h2>

  <p class="first">But Derek Crayle rose up in his corner at the same moment.
  This was his appointed moment. Before Lois could reach the door he was in her
  path.</p>

  <p>"You can't go, my dear, like that. It's not so simple."</p>

  <p>Lois drew back.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Derek," she pleaded, and he shook his head stubbornly.</p>

  <p>"But I must go. After what I've done, even if you and I and my father were
  alone, I shouldn't find it possible to stay. I think that I'm somehow horrid
  in myself. I should see in every kindness a charity, and I can't bear
  charity. But we three are not alone, and it's doubly impossible."</p>

  <p>There was no need for Lois to cross her t's. Even if Olivia buried her
  hatchet and Lois could subdue her nature to meekness, there would be such a
  tension upon all, such a need of circumspection and delicate treading that
  life in that household would be intolerable.</p>

  <p>"I don't say that you mustn't go, Lois," he replied. "But you mustn't just
  go off, You see, you and Mark have said to each other what you had to say. No
  doubt it had to be said. But it's done with. I'm not done with."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Derek!"</p>

  <p>She spoke his name in a whisper, and very tenderly. The last hard tone had
  gone from her voice, her great dark eyes were dewy, her face unutterably
  wistful.</p>

  <p>"I'm beginning, Lois. Or rather, I began when you came into the
  dining-room. I love you very dearly."</p>

  <p>Again Lois raised her hands and buried her face in them. A sob broke from
  her, and in a moment the tears ran out between her fingers.</p>

  <p>"Lois!"</p>

  <p>Derek took a quick step towards her, but she held him off.</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>She turned away to a window and stood with her back to the room, wiping
  her eyes with her handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"I haven't done that since I was a child," she said between a laugh and a
  sob. "I'm so sorry."</p>

  <p>She came forward again into the room and stood a little apart from her
  lover.</p>

  <p>"Dearest," she said, "I thank you and thank you. You've been a darling to
  me. You took me by surprise this morning. I knew, of course, that we were
  great friends. I thought that you were perhaps a little fond of me. But that
  this morning...after what happened last night...you would still take my face
  between your hands and kiss me&mdash;oh, I couldn't believe it! You showed me
  a world I didn't know, which I didn't believe existed. My dear, if I could
  just creep to you and say, 'Yes, we begin, we both begin,' I shouldn't be
  standing here and you there. But I can't say that, Derek."</p>

  <p>Derek began to plead. He used the phrases all lovers use, eternally old
  and eternally new, the everyday words transmuted into gold by the alchemy of
  a passionate heart. All his fine self-confidence had gone. He was going to
  take the tangled skein after Mark had made a bungle of it and unravel it out
  of hand, was he? He found himself desperately crying:</p>

  <p>"I love you, Lois...I love you...There never will be anyone else in the
  world for me but you...I adore you...It was planned ages ago that we should
  meet and love...Together we could do such fine things. It'll be
  wonderful."</p>

  <p>And Lois, all her yearning heart in her eyes, answered with quivering
  lips:</p>

  <p>"It might have been wonderful, Derek."</p>

  <p>"Without you I am lame."</p>

  <p>Slowly she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"With me you would be crippled."</p>

  <p>Years ago, when Henry Perriton had first told Lois that she was Mark
  Thewliss' bastard daughter, she had nursed a morbid fancy that she carried a
  taint upon her like a leper, that she must keep aloof from the other girls of
  her age, that she ought to carry a bell so that its tinkling might warn
  others of her approach. She had grown out of that foolishness, but she had
  the conviction back in her mind now. She remembered how she had fallen at the
  first suggestion of Hoyle, nay, how she had run forward to welcome it, how
  continuously she had planned to bring it to success and the bitterness of her
  disappointment when, answering her telegram, Hoyle had met her in the
  basement of the great Oxford Street store only to tell her of the hiatus
  which made the formula of no worth. She was horribly ashamed. There was a
  taint upon her. She was set apart.</p>

  <p>"Marriage with you, dear one, cannot be," she said. Gently though they
  were spoken, never were words more firm, and never did they expose more
  clearly a breaking heart. "I would not do you so much harm. Oh, yes, it would
  be harm. Again I say I know now a little about myself. Between us there would
  always be the knowledge of this that I had done. You wouldn't hold it over my
  head, as Henry Perriton did with my mother; I know that very well. But I
  haven't my mother's"&mdash;and she sought for a word&mdash;"acquiescence, and
  the dignity of her acquiescence in the things which can't be altered. This
  secret would be there between us. I should feel&mdash;a horrible word, but it
  just says what I mean&mdash;I should feel inferior, and I shouldn't be
  patient, I shouldn't accept. I should visit it on you&mdash;yes, until in
  time you would begin to hate the sight of me and the very sound of my voice
  upon the stairs."</p>

  <p>"I'll take the risk of that, Lois," cried Derek, brushing away her
  argument.</p>

  <p>"I know you would, my dear," she answered. "But I won't. So you must let
  me go."</p>

  <p>She turned hesitatingly towards Mark, who was standing apart by the
  fire.</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry," she said in a low voice, and she added in a voice which
  was lower still: "Father, I beg your pardon."</p>

  <p>Mark reached out his arms to her.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my dear!" he whispered.</p>

  <p>But she did not come into them, and he dropped them to his side.</p>

  <p>"So you really are going?"</p>

  <p>There was so deep a yearning in his eyes that she dared not look at
  them.</p>

  <p>"I must. I must be alone. I am like a child in the dark."</p>

  <p>She moved again towards the door, and now Derek stood away from it. It was
  so clear that no power could stop her. In a few moments the car was heard to
  drive away. The two men were left standing in the library, and upon Mark's
  face was the look of one who would welcome death.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch29"
     id="ch29"></a>XXIX. &mdash;THE ANTHEM</h2>

  <p class="first">"Sunset and evening star<br>
  And one clear call for me,<br>
  And may there be no moaning of the bar<br>
  When I put out to sea."</p>

  <p>The voice of one boy soared, pure and wistful as the music of a flute
  above the others, and seemed to beat with the pinions of an angel about the
  high wood roof. Mark Thewliss, two and a half years older by the measurement
  of days and ten by that of sorrow, sat in the very front of the church, his
  face a pale mask, his eyes drawing unconsciously a little solace and rest
  from the glorious blue of the great painted window above the altar.</p>

  <p>He had planned that a wedding should be held here with its fact of
  reparation and its promise of a long line of men and women who should serve
  the commonwealth, make a new family old, and keep its name sweet and of good
  repute. He peopled the church with rejoicing friends. He saw the bridesmaids
  a delicious cluster of fresh flowers grouped at the foot of the aisle, he
  walked himself up the length of it with a hand upon his arm which clung just
  a trifle more tightly than it ever had clung, so that he might feel the dear
  touch of it through all the rest of his hours. He heard the bells clash
  joyously, rocking the walls. Dreams and vanities! Nothing had gone according
  to plan. For he had been in a hurry. Lois had not stepped an inch beyond the
  truth when she had said that. Success, the sensation of power, the great
  name, the gratitude of unknown people for the great gift of colour which he
  was to put within their reach&mdash;he had been in a hurry to secure these
  fine things, so the church was full of mourners instead of wedding
  guests.</p>

  <p>"But such a tide as moving seems asleep<br>
  Too full for sound and foam<br>
  When that which drew from out the boundless deep<br>
  Turns again home."</p>

  <p>The lovely anthem winged by the young pure voice rose and fell like a
  smooth wave of the sea. Derek had turned again home after that fateful hour
  in the library at Upper Theign. Oh, he had tried to carry on, working at the
  flotation of the company, overdoing his jests, filling with a laborious
  vivacity the emptiness which never could be filled. But he had no heart for
  it. A year and he had come to the end of his acting. He turned again home.
  Mark recalled the evening. It was a Sunday, and they were in the country
  together, Olivia, and Derek and he. Derek had rattled away through dinner
  rather boisterously, and coming into the library had dropped into a chair by
  the fire&mdash;the chair in which Lois had once sat in the formal, still
  attitude of one who was there on probation.</p>

  <p>"I'm through, Mark," he had said, with such a look of weariness upon his
  face that he was not to be gainsaid. "I have tried, you know. I thought that
  I could worry it out, until last week. But last week I began to doubt. And
  once I had begun to doubt, it rushed upon me as a certainty that I couldn't.
  I must go, Mark. I feel like a dog, leaving you. But I can't help it."</p>

  <p>Mark had just nodded his head.</p>

  <p>"No, you can't help it. Derek. Thank you for staying with me so long. What
  are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>He could go out on the staff of the new Commander-in-Chief in India. It
  was the work to which he was bred. He had turned again home.</p>

  <p>Behind Mark Thewliss in the church old Gregory was sitting, and his
  thoughts were wandering. The back of Mark's neck had grown too thin during
  these last months. How long would he go on? He was one of the wiry men. He
  had never put on fat. He was born for a very long life. But when the back of
  the neck goes thin&mdash;there's a bad sign. Happily the company was
  launched, the patents assured, the universal process for making dyes fast a
  triumphant advance, and good men on the directorate. Mardyke and Campion's
  would go on, even though the giant who had built it up fell.</p>

  <p>"Twilight and evening bell<br>
  And after that the dark,<br>
  And may there be no sadness of farewell<br>
  When I embark."</p>

  <p>Thus the choir. It had been broad daylight and Derek in the fullness of
  his strength when he had embarked. Riding down the Khyber Pass from Landi
  Khotal after a tour of inspection on the Afghan border, his escort had been
  bombed by an air-squadron on manoeuvres. A terrible mistake, but mistakes
  must happen, and men on service who die because of them die serving like
  soldiers in battle. Derek was buried out there amongst those far hills "I'm
  through." Yes, he was through now. There was but the memory of his joyous,
  gallant spirit alive in the church.</p>

  <p>"For though from out our bourn of time and place<br>
  The flood may bear me far,<br>
  I hope to see my Pilot face to face<br>
  When I have crossed the bar."</p>

  <p>Mark himself had asked that that anthem should be sung. It was written at
  sea. He had seemed to hear in its rhythm the long-drawn low thunder of a calm
  sea breaking upon a beach. The sea had always been one of the two great
  emotional influences in his life, as though it had a message for him which it
  was always hinting, which one day it would clearly deliver. The sea and Lois,
  his daughter. He wondered whether she was here, hidden amongst the mourners,
  whether when all was over their eyes would meet. Surely if they did, the
  barrier would be down. The great, hoped-for harvest&mdash;that, with Derek
  gone, was lost, but he and she might perhaps glean a few ears from the
  stubble. Surely she would be here, for Love had spoken with its authentic
  voice when she had bidden Derek good-bye on that morning of snow at Upper
  Theign.</p>

  <p>Mark, employing a wiser head than Joseph Wyatt's, had kept touch with his
  daughter's movements. She had disappeared, it is true, but he had held his
  eyes upon Glebe Villa. He had not a doubt that Mona would be written to and
  through Mona he meant by hook or by crook to discover Lois' whereabouts.
  Mona, indeed, made just the move which he expected. On learning the treachery
  of Henry Perriton, she left him. She joined Lois in London and the pair of
  them, at once courageous, independent and efficient, had established
  themselves upon what was left of Lois' savings at Southampton. There they had
  opened a small secretarial office, taking the name of Lightfoot, and almost
  from the first they made it pay. There was no slovenliness in their work, and
  they had no grudge against overtime. Mark, himself, was able in that pleasant
  city of great ships to put secretly a good deal of opportunity in their way.
  He would have made that opportunity had it been necessary. But it was not,
  and it was an immense consolation to Mark and a high cause of pride that even
  without his help their little business made by themselves was prospering. For
  the rest, he did not for a second time seek for any facile assurance that
  their domestic life met with a like success. But so far as he could learn
  they had attained some measure of contentment; they enjoyed at all events the
  loving company of each other and knew perhaps from time to time some moments
  of vivid happiness.</p>

  <p>None the less there had been great love between Lois and Derek, and the
  loss of him must be a heavy cloud upon her now. Surely she was somewhere in
  this church. He waked from his thoughts of her to see the tall Rector
  standing with uplifted hand, and to hear the Benediction. Then two buglers of
  Derek's regiment stepped forward, and the Last Post with its long-drawn
  farewell blown, it sounded, to the loneliest traveller already lost beyond
  infinite spaces, crashed with a heart-shattering volume amongst the pillars
  of the church and was flung back from the walls and high arches in echoes of
  intolerable sadness. The bugle call took Mark Thewliss by storm, and broke
  through his vigilance. Despite the difference in their years, Derek Crayle
  had been the greatest friend he had ever had. Now he was gone. Mark dropped
  his face upon his hands, and so remained, whilst the Funeral March thundered
  and the mourners went from the church.</p>

  <p>Amongst the last to leave was Lois. She had been kneeling in a side aisle
  almost in a line with Mark Thewliss. She stood up and gazed at him a little
  while through the curtain of her tears. She took, indeed, a step across the
  aisle, her heart yearning towards him. Had he lifted his head at that moment,
  their eyes must have met, and nothing thereafter could have held them apart.
  But he did not, and Lois, seeing Olivia at his side, turned away blindly down
  the aisle.</p>

  <p>A few seconds later Mark whispered to his wife:</p>

  <p>"Olivia! I want you to leave me here alone;" and when he was alone, by
  some odd chance, unless it was by some thread of sympathy too fine for mind
  and brain to apprehend, his gaze wandered to the bench where Lois so lately
  knelt. Above the bench, there was a coloured window in memory of Admiral
  Blake, who had once been buried in the Abbey and thence ejected. There were
  tall ships sailing stately across the blue glass, and they held Mark
  Thewliss' eyes. He wondered again whether the sea had not some undelivered
  message for him such as mountaineers listen to on their high pinnacles. His
  thoughts leapt over the years of his big top-sail schooner and homed on the
  little <i>Sea Flower</i>, which, still tended and cherished, had lain this
  many a year in a yard on the Hamble River. A message had been delivered to
  him on that trim and dainty cutter, but clamorous for the sensation of power,
  he had given to it no heed.</p>

  <p>During the evening, after a long silence, he told Olivia suddenly that for
  a little while he must go away. Olivia nodded her head. During the last two
  years a constraint had grown up between them, setting a check upon their
  tongues and a formality upon their manners. There were subjects to be
  avoided, so vast a difference separated their angles of view. Questions were
  dangerous, for no one could tell whither they might lead. The pair had
  drifted apart. Olivia returned very gently:</p>

  <p>"Yes. This has been a troublesome time for you. Go, Mark!" and for a week
  he was very busy.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch30"
     id="ch30"></a>XXX. &mdash;THE LAST CRUISE</h2>

  <p class="first">At six o'clock on a Tuesday morning, <i>Sea Flower</i>, trim
  and spruce as a girl at the dance of the season, slipped down Southampton
  Water with a fair wind upon her beam. It was the month of August, the sky
  already bleached by the sun, seemed to have lent its blue to the sea, and the
  little waves of the Sound, embroidered with gold, sang under the forefoot of
  the cutter. Mark sat alone at the tiller, was the only inhabitant of his
  ship; and already his troubled soul was smoothing out. There was an
  exhilaration in his blood, and a world-old vanity stirred within him.</p>

  <p>"I am just as useful as I ever was. I can cook as good a breakfast as my
  <i>chef</i> and set my sails properly into the bargain." He felt his years
  dropping one by one from his shoulders. He bore to the left of the Dean's
  Elbow where once, unseen by him, Mona Lightfoot had slipped a wedding ring
  from her finger and watched it waver and sink into green darkness. Now the
  tall spire of Ryde Church stood high above the ridge of the island. Mark
  shook out his mainsheet and bore away between Calshot and the Brambles past
  Gurnard's Bay, and the long pier of Yarmouth and the high slope of purple
  heather above the Needles. The wind dropped when he was opposite to the sand
  cliffs of Bournemouth, but freshened again towards sunset, blowing from the
  east as it had done throughout the day. Mark bore up between the striped
  buoys and the black cones to the white landing gates of Brownsea, tacked
  round the elbow of the channel and sailed free northwards to Poole. He had
  never once put into those shallow waters since he and Mona Lightfoot had made
  their cruise to the west; and but for the "Margate Hoy," the little tavern of
  dingy yellow upon the quay, he would hardly have known the place again. Then
  it had been a decrepit little town dying, as it were, upon its feet. Now
  colliers for the new electric light works crowded the wharves, the streets
  were ajostle with tourists driven out by the high prices of Bournemouth, and
  motor-boats ran them to Studland Bay on moonlight trips.</p>

  <p>Mark dropped his anchor and went ashore in his punt to do his marketing.
  He was more tired than he would admit, and the exhilaration of the morning
  had gone from him. There were too many memories awakened by the stones of
  that small town, and he hurried back to his cutter, cooked his dinner, and
  sat in his cabin, very lonely and very old. But though the glamour of this
  fantastic expedition had vanished, Mark was obstinate. Farther to the west,
  west of St. Alban's head&mdash;"where England begins," as he remembered with
  a smile perhaps in the West Bay beyond the Bill, a cool silent night would
  restore it and, chasing the years away, make him brother with the stars.</p>

  <p>But the wind held light all the next day, and died away before the
  evening. The cutter was becalmed opposite to the ochre-coloured coastguard
  station on the cliff at the narrow entrance to Lulworth Cove. There she hung
  and a mist came up from the south thick as wool, so that not even a star was
  visible. The <i>Sea Flower</i> drifted in with the tide, and Mark, seated in
  the cockpit by the tiller, could hear the voices of people talking upon the
  beach. Then as the tide ebbed, the voices diminished and soon there was no
  sound at all but an occasional creak of the gaff or the boom. There settled
  upon Mark a profound discouragement. This last emancipation was denied to
  him. He would never go west now and see the Bishop Lighthouse rising from the
  spume of the Atlantic. The gates were closing on him. He would leave the
  <i>Sea Flower</i> at Weymouth in the morning, and take the train back to his
  home. Some odd questions, with which he had never troubled before, presented
  themselves suddenly. What had he got out of his life? He remembered a story
  told of the great actor whose manner and voice he had once so proudly copied.
  He was asked just that question: "What had he got out of it?" and he had
  answered, so the story ran, "A good cigar, a good glass of wine, a good
  friend."</p>

  <p>Mark could say as much. Could he say more? That idea of his that bright
  colours made for the peace of the world? He had been so sure of it. With the
  success of his formula he had done something real towards proving his faith
  in it. But wasn't the whole idea rather romantic, the dream of a man with his
  head in the clouds? The fog wrapped him about, cold and heavy, numbing body
  and brain. He couldn't tell. He gave up trying to tell, and fell to
  speculating whether he would live his life over again if the chance were
  given to him. After all, what had he lived for. The sensation of power? Yes,
  everything had been sacrificed to that. Yet&mdash;he knew it now&mdash;he had
  never enjoyed that sensation half so completely as on a day of storm nearly
  thirty years ago when he had sailed the <i>Sea Flower</i>, with a gale behind
  him, across the West Bay to Lulworth Cove. That day rolled itself out upon
  the thick fog like a brilliant film in a dark theatre. He and Mona and the
  gale piling up the water behind him and roaring against his shred of sail.
  Would he go through all his life again? He thought with terror of the
  mistakes which he had just not made, and with bitter regret of those which he
  had. He thought of Mona...and of Lois...and in the end he threw all these
  questions from him.</p>

  <p>"I am very tired," he spoke aloud those last words of so many people, and
  he dropped his head upon his arm.</p>

  <p>The next morning the fog had cleared away, and boatmen early upon the
  beach of the cove saw a small cutter drift with the tide, and a faint wind of
  dawn within the ring of cliffs. Coming up into the wind and falling off it
  crossed the great well of sea and grounded gently on the pebbles, as though
  it carried a sacred burden. It carried an old dead man whose hand was still
  clasped about the tiller.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>A few days later, Sir William Hawker presented himself at the office of
  "Lightfoot's," in Southampton, and handed to Mona a letter.</p>

  <p>"It has been in my safe these last two years," he said, and Mona broke the
  seal and read. It was very short and with the tears in her eyes, Mona passed
  it to Lois.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Hawker will bring you this himself, it ran. I have made a
  provision for you both in my will, and with all my heart I beg you to accept
  it. Lois is young. She has her life ahead of her. For her sake then! Did I
  recite to you, Mona, in the West Bay these words?<br>
  <br>
  "Hereafter, in a better world than this,<br>
  I shall desire more love and knowledge of you."<br>
  <br>
  Mark.</p>
